<text>Georgia Gibbs (born Frieda Lipschitz; August 17, 1918December 9, 2006) was an American popular singer and vocal entertainer rooted in jazz. Already singing publicly in her early teens, Gibbs achieved acclaim and notoriety in the mid-1950s copying songs originating with the black rhythm and blues community and later became a featured vocalist for many radio and television variety and comedy programs. Her key attribute was tremendous versatility and an uncommon stylistic range from melancholy ballad to uptempo swinging jazz and rock and roll.

==Early life==
Gibbs was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, the youngest of four children of Russian Jewish descent. Her father died when she was six months old, and she and her three siblings spent the next seven years in a local Jewish orphanage.

Revealing a natural talent for singing at a young age, Frieda was given the lead in the orphanage&#x27;s yearly variety show. When her mother, who had visited her every other month, found employment as a midwife, she came back for Frieda, but her job often forced her to leave her daughter for weeks at a time with only a Philco radio for company.

==Career==
While still in Worcester at age 13, Frieda auditioned for a job at the Plymouth Theatre, one of the prime vaudeville houses in Boston. The Plymouth&#x27;s manager had already heard her sing on the local Worcester radio station, and Gibbs was hired and moved to Boston, eventually landing at the Raymor Ballroom. She joined the Hudson-DeLange Orchestra in 1936 (age 17), and toured with them for 10 months as Fredda Gibson. &quot;You don&#x27;t really know loneliness unless you do a year or two with a one-night band&quot;, Gibbs said of her life on the big-band circuit, &quot;Sing until about 2 a.m. Get in a bus and drive 400 miles. Stop in the night for the greasy hamburger. Arrive in a town. Try to sleep. Get up and eat.&quot;

She found steady work on radio shows including &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, &quot;Melody Puzzles&quot;, and &quot;The Tim And Irene Show&quot; and freelanced in the late 1930s and early 1940s singing with the bands of Tommy Dorsey, Hal Kemp, Artie Shaw, and Frankie Trumbauer. While a &quot;Billboard&quot; article reports that her first time on disk was with Trumbauer&#x27;s orchestra (&quot;The Laziest Gal in Town&quot; on Brunswick Records), liner notes from a 1998 Simitar compilation report her appearance on some of DeLange&#x27;s recordings on Brunswick, and a recording exists with Hal Kemp from 1939. She first charted with Shaw&#x27;s band in 1942 on &quot;Absent Minded Moon&quot; (Victor 27779), which received a lukewarm review at the time. Gibbs was the first singer to record &quot;The Laziest Gal in Town&quot;, a Cole Porter song which was made much more famous in the 1960s by Nina Simone.

In 1943, with her name changed to Georgia Gibbs, she began appearing on the &quot;Camel Caravan&quot; radio program, hosted by Jimmy Durante and Garry Moore, where she remained a regular performer until 1947. It was Moore who bestowed upon her the famous nickname &quot;Her Nibs, Miss Georgia Gibbs,&quot; ironically using the title to describe the singer of diminutive stature who had an enormous &quot;authoritative&quot; prominence in American pop music.

Gibbs signed with Majestic Records in 1946 cutting multiple records including the first of three recordings of &quot;Ballin&#x27; The Jack&quot; (she re-recorded the song in 1950 and 1954). but her first solo hit single, &quot;If I Knew You Were Comin&#x27; I&#x27;d&#x27;ve Baked a Cake&quot; (on the Coral label) did not come until 1950. The recording got airplay but the disc failed to sell anything. During this period she also was the featured vocalist on tours with comedians Danny Kaye and Sid Caesar. Success as a singer outside of radio and variety shows continued to elude her, as noted in a 1952 &quot;Time&quot; article:

Through 1949 and 1950 she appeared on TV shows &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; and &quot;All Star Revue&quot;. In 1951 she signed with Mercury Records where she ultimately had success &quot;sticking with plain Georgia Gibbs&quot;. Possessed of a versatile voice, she cut a long list of well-received records in every category from torch songs to rock-and-roll, jazz, swing, old fashioned ballads and cha-chas. The most successful, 1952&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Of Fire&quot;, which she performed on &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot; in that spring, reached No. 1 on the pop music chart. The disc sold in excess of one million copies giving Gibbs her first gold disc. &quot;Kiss of Fire&quot; borrows the tune of the tango &quot;El Choclo&quot; by Ángel Villoldo, and the lyrics, arrangement and delivery communicate passion on a Wagnerian scale.

Like many singers, Gibbs preferred ballads as there was more opportunity to showcase her vocal abilities, although she became mostly associated with uptempo novelty songs. Some ballads she cut included &quot;My Melancholy Baby&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot;, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;, and &quot;You Keep Coming Back Like a Song&quot;. Yet she could also belt out fast jazz numbers like &quot;Red Hot Mama&quot;, &quot;A-Razz-A-Ma-Tazz&quot;; jive with tunes like &quot;Ol Man Mose&quot;, &quot;Shoo Shoo Baby&quot;; or rock out with &quot;I Want You to Be My Baby&quot;. Her &quot;Swingin&#x27; With Her Nibs&quot; album (1956) demonstrated her natural affinity for improvisation as well.

In 1957, Gibbs signed with RCA Victor going on to chart with over 40 songs before retirement from singing, and was briefly successful doing rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll songs as well. Her Mercury record &quot;Silent Lips&quot; was a big hit in Sweden (September 1958-March 1959) peaking at number 5 in the best-selling charts, and there were even several Swedish cover versions of that song, &quot;Ingenting&quot; by among others Towa Carson, Lill-Babs and Britt Rylander. Also &quot;The Hula Hoop Song&quot; did well in Sweden (February–March 1959) peaking at number 12. She continued to appear on many television shows including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, and hosted one of her own, &quot;Georgia Gibbs and her Million Record Show&quot;. She cut her final album &quot;Call Me&quot;, in 1966 and rarely performed after that.

Some notoriety followed Gibbs for her cover versions of music popularized by black performers, such as Etta James&#x27;s &quot;The Wallflower&quot; (recorded by Gibbs with modified lyrics under the title &quot;Dance With Me Henry&quot;, released March 26, 1955) and LaVern Baker&#x27;s &quot;Tweedle Dee&quot; (which outsold Baker&#x27;s version, prompting complaint from her). Decades later, Gibbs commented that she, like most artists of the day, had no say in their choice of material and arrangements. A widely told story has LaVern Baker taking out a life insurance policy on herself in advance of a flight to Australia and naming Georgia Gibbs as the beneficiary. &quot;You need this more than I do,&quot; Baker is said to have written to Gibbs, &quot;because if anything happens to me, you&#x27;re out of business.&quot;Whitened pop covers of black R&amp;B and blues songs were a mid-1950s fad and many singers and groups had hits with them, including Pat Boone, the McGuire Sisters, the Chordettes, and the Crew Cuts. At the time these covers served a business purpose since white radio stations seldom played black pop and they brought many of the songs to a wider audience but would later come to be attacked by rock critics as a mutilation of the original recordings. Gibbs happened to be the subject of immediate criticism due to the negative reaction of the originators of the R&amp;B songs she covered.

==Personal life==
In 1970 she married foreign correspondent and author Frank Gervasi, biographer of Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, and whose books include &quot;To Whom Palestine?&quot;, &quot;The Case for Israel&quot;, &quot;The Real Rockefeller&quot; and &quot;The Violent Decade&quot;. They had first met in Paris in the 1930s, but lost touch with one another for 12 years. The marriage lasted until his death in 1990; they had one child who predeceased Georgia. 

Georgia Gibbs died of leukemia on December 9, 2006, aged 88, at New York&#x27;s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Survivors included grandson Sacha Gervasi (from her husband&#x27;s previous marriage), her brother Robert Gibson and nieces Patty Turk, Jody (Babydoll) Gibson, and Jody&#x27;s sister Amy. Gibbs&#x27; last interview, conducted by Greg Adams, was subsequently published online.

==Legacy==
Interest in Gibbs&#x27; work has enjoyed a revival with the re-issue on CD of long unavailable material. In her 2006 book, &quot;Great Pretenders: My Strange Love Affair With 50s Pop Music&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; music critic Karen Schoemer wrote: &quot;What really turned me around, though, were her R&amp;B covers... Georgia was the rare fifties canary with a genuine flair for rock and roll... by the time I was through listening... I had a healthy new respect for Georgia, and a sense of indignation over her neglect by critics.&quot;

<doc id="304356" wikidata="Q1349597" url="?curid=304356" title="Black Sox Scandal">
<text>The Black Sox Scandal was a game-fixing scandal in Major League Baseball (MLB) in which eight members of the Chicago White Sox were accused of intentionally losing the 1919 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for payment from a gambling syndicate, possibly led by organized crime figure Arnold Rothstein. There is strong evidence both for and against Rothstein&#x27;s involvement; however, there is no conclusive indication that the gambling syndicate&#x27;s actions were directed by organized crime. In response, the National Baseball Commission was dissolved and Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was appointed to be the first commissioner of baseball, given absolute control over the sport to restore its integrity.

Despite acquittals in a public trial in 1921, Commissioner Landis permanently banned all eight players from professional baseball. The Baseball Hall of Fame eventually defined the punishment as banishment from consideration for the Hall. Despite requests for reinstatement in the decades that followed (particularly in the case of Shoeless Joe Jackson), the ban remains in force.

==Background==
===Tension in the clubhouse and Charles Comiskey===

In 1919, Charles Comiskey, the owner of the Chicago White Sox and a prominent Major League Baseball (MLB) player from 1882 to 1894, was widely resented by his players for his miserliness. As a player, Comiskey had taken part in the Players&#x27; League labor rebellion in 1890 and long had a reputation for underpaying his players, even though they were one of the top teams in the league and had already won the 1917 World Series.

Because of baseball&#x27;s reserve clause, any player who refused to accept a contract was prohibited from playing baseball on any other professional team under the auspices of &quot;Organized Baseball&quot;. Players could only change teams with permission from their current team, and without a union, the players had no bargaining power. Comiskey was probably no worse than most owners of the time; in fact, the White Sox had the largest team payroll in 1919. In the era of the reserve clause, gamblers could find players on many teams looking for extra cash—and they did.

The White Sox clubhouse was divided into two factions. One group resented the more straitlaced players (later called the &quot;Clean Sox&quot;), a group that included players like second baseman Eddie Collins, a graduate of Columbia College of Columbia University; catcher Ray Schalk, and pitchers Red Faber and Dickie Kerr. By contemporary accounts, the two factions rarely spoke to each other on or off the field, and the only thing they had in common was a resentment of Comiskey.

===The conspiracy===

On September 18, 1919, White Sox player Chick Gandil met with Joe &quot;Sport&quot; Sullivan, a Boston bookmaker, at the Hotel Buckminster near Fenway Park. The two men discussed plans to throw their upcoming series with the Cincinnati Reds for $80,000. Two days later, a meeting of White Sox players—including those committed to going ahead and those just ready to listen—took place in Gandil&#x27;s room at the Ansonia Hotel in New York City. Buck Weaver, the team&#x27;s third baseman, was the only player to attend the meetings who did not receive money; nevertheless, he was later banned along with the others for knowing about the fix but not reporting it.

Although he hardly played in the series, utility infielder Fred McMullin heard about the fix and threatened to report the others unless he was in on the payoff. As a small coincidence, McMullin was a former teammate of the retired player William &quot;Sleepy Bill&quot; Burns, who had a minor role in the fix. Both had played for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), and Burns had previously pitched for the White Sox in 1909 and 1910. Star outfielder &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; Jackson was mentioned as a participant but did not attend the meetings, and his involvement remains disputed.

The scheme got an unexpected boost when the straitlaced Faber could not pitch due to getting sick with the flu. Years later, Schalk said the fix would not have happened if Faber had been available. According to Schalk, since Faber was the ace of the staff, he would almost certainly have gotten starts that went instead to two of the alleged conspirators, pitchers Eddie &quot;Knuckles&quot; Cicotte and Lefty Williams.

==Conduct of the World Series==

On October 1, the day of Game One, there were rumors amongst gamblers that the World Series was fixed, and a sudden influx of money being bet on Cincinnati caused the odds against them to fall rapidly. These rumors also reached the press box where several correspondents, including Hugh Fullerton of the &quot;Chicago Herald and Examiner&quot; and ex-player and manager Christy Mathewson, resolved to compare notes on any plays and players that they felt were questionable. However, most fans and observers were taking the series at face value. On October 2, the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot; published a poem which would quickly prove to be ironic:

&lt;poem&gt;
Still, it really doesn&#x27;t matter,
After all, who wins the flag.
Good clean sport is what we&#x27;re after,
And we aim to make our brag
To each near or distant nation
Whereon shines the sporting sun
That of all our games gymnastic
Base ball is the cleanest one!
&lt;/poem&gt;

After throwing a strike with his first pitch of the Series, Cicotte&#x27;s second pitch struck Cincinnati leadoff hitter Morrie Rath in the back, delivering a pre-arranged signal confirming the players&#x27; willingness to go through with the fix. In the fourth inning, Cicotte made a lousy throw to Swede Risberg at second base. Sportswriters found the unsuccessful double play to be suspicious.

Williams lost three games, a Series record. Kerr, a rookie who was not part of the fix, won both of his starts. But the gamblers were now reneging on their promised progress payments (to be paid after each game lost), claiming that all the money was let out on bets and was in the hands of the bookmakers. After Game Five, angry about the non-payment of promised money, the players involved in the fix attempted to doublecross the gamblers and won Games 6 and 7 of the best-of-nine Series. Before Game Eight, threats of violence were made on the gamblers&#x27; behalf against players and family members. Williams started Game Eight but gave up four straight one-out hits for three runs before manager Kid Gleason relieved him. The White Sox lost Game Eight (and the series) on October 9, 1919. Besides Weaver, the players involved in the scandal received $5,000 each () or more, with Gandil taking $35,000 ().

==Fallout==
===Grand jury (1920)===
Rumors of the fix dogged the White Sox throughout the 1920 season as they battled the Cleveland Indians for the American League pennant, and stories of corruption touched players on other clubs as well. At last, in September 1920, a grand jury was convened to investigate; Cicotte confessed to his participation in the scheme to the grand jury on September 28.

On the eve of their final season series, the White Sox were in a virtual tie for first place with the Indians. The Sox would need to win all three of their remaining games and then hope for Cleveland to stumble, as the Indians had more games left to play than the Sox. Despite the season being on the line, Comiskey suspended the seven White Sox still in the majors (Gandil had not returned to the team in 1920 and was playing semi-pro ball). He later said he had no choice but to suspend them, even though this action likely cost the Sox any chance of winning a second pennant. The Sox lost two of the three games in the final series against the St. Louis Browns and finished in second place, two games behind the Indians, who went on to win the 1920 World Series.

The grand jury issued its decision on October 22, 1920, and eight players and five gamblers were implicated. The indictments included nine counts of conspiracy to defraud. The ten players not implicated in the gambling scandal, as well as manager Kid Gleason, were each given $1,500 bonus checks () by Comiskey in the fall of 1920, the amount equaling the difference between the winners&#x27; and losers&#x27; share for participation in the 1919 Series.

===Trial (1921)===

The trial commenced in Chicago on June 27, 1921, but was delayed by Judge Hugo Friend because two defendants, Ben Franklin and Carl Zork, claimed to be ill. Right fielder Shano Collins was named as the wronged party in the indictments, accusing his corrupt teammates of having cost him $1,784 as a result of the scandal. Before the trial, key evidence went missing from the Cook County courthouse, including the signed confessions of Cicotte and Jackson, who subsequently recanted their confessions. Some years later, the missing confessions reappeared in the possession of Comiskey&#x27;s lawyer.

On July 1, the prosecution announced that Burns, who was under indictment for his part in the scandal, had turned state&#x27;s evidence and would testify. During jury selection on July 11, several members of the current White Sox team, including Gleason, visited the courthouse, chatting and shaking hands with the indicted ex-players; at one point they even tickled Weaver, who was known to be quite ticklish. Jury selection took several days, but on July 15 twelve jurors were finally empaneled in the case.

Trial testimony began on July 18, when prosecutor Charles Gorman outlined the evidence he planned to present against the defendants:
The spectators added to the bleacher appearance of the courtroom, for most of them sweltered in shirtsleeves, and collars were few. Scores of small boys jammed their way into the seats, and as Mr. Gorman told of the alleged sell-out, they repeatedly looked at each other in awe, remarking under their breaths: &#x27;What do you think of that?&#x27; or &#x27;Well, I&#x27;ll be darned.&#x27;
Comiskey was then called to the stand, and became so agitated with questions being posed by the defense that he rose from the witness chair and shook his fist at the defendants&#x27; counsel, Ben Short.

The most explosive testimony began the following day, July 19, when Burns admitted that members of the White Sox had intentionally fixed the 1919 World Series; Burns mentioned the involvement of organized crime figure Arnold Rothstein, among others, and testified that Cicotte had threatened to throw the ball clear out of the park if needed to lose a game. After additional testimony and evidence, on July 28 the defense rested and the case went to the jury. The jury deliberated for less than three hours before returning verdicts of not guilty on all charges for all of the accused players.

===Landis appointed Commissioner, bans all eight players (1921)===
Long before the scandal broke, many of baseball&#x27;s owners had nursed longstanding grievances with the way the game was then governed by the National Baseball Commission. The Black Sox scandal and the damage it caused to the game&#x27;s reputation gave owners the resolve to make significant changes to the governance of the sport. Their original plan was to appoint the widely respected federal judge and noted baseball fan Kenesaw Mountain Landis to head a reformed three-member commission comprising men unconnected to baseball. However, Landis made it clear to the owners that he would only accept an appointment as the game&#x27;s &quot;sole&quot; commissioner, and even then only on the condition that he be granted essentially unchecked power over the sport. Desperate to clean up the game&#x27;s image, the owners agreed to his terms and vested him with virtually unlimited authority over everyone in the major and minor leagues. It was controversial at the time for MLB to move toward a single commissioner with sole governance on behalf of the owners.

Upon taking office before the 1921 season, one of Landis&#x27;s first acts as commissioner was to use his new powers to place the eight accused players on an &quot;ineligible list&quot;, a decision that effectively left them suspended indefinitely from all of &quot;organized&quot; professional baseball (although not from semi-pro barnstorming teams). Following their acquittals, Landis quickly quashed any prospect that he might reinstate the implicated players. On August 3, 1921, the day after the acquittals, Landis issued his own verdict:

Making use of a precedent that had previously seen Babe Borton, Harl Maggert, Gene Dale and Bill Rumler banned from the PCL for fixing games, Landis made it clear that all eight accused players would remain on the &quot;ineligible list&quot;, banning them from organized baseball. The commissioner took the position that while the players had been acquitted in court, there was no dispute they had broken the rules of baseball, and none of them could ever be allowed back in the game if it were to regain the public&#x27;s trust. Comiskey supported Landis by giving the seven who remained under contract to the White Sox their unconditional release.

Following the commissioner&#x27;s statement, it was universally understood that all eight implicated players were to be banned from Major League Baseball for life. Two other players believed to be involved were also banned. One of them was Hal Chase, who had been effectively blackballed from the majors in 1919 for a long history of throwing games and had spent 1920 in the minors. Though it has never been confirmed, Chase was rumored to have been a go-between for Gandil and the gamblers. Regardless of this, it was understood that Landis&#x27; announcement not only formalized his 1919 blacklisting from the majors but barred him from the minors as well.

Landis, relying upon his years of experience as a federal judge and attorney, used this decision (the &quot;case&quot;) as the founding precedent (of the reorganized majors) for the Commissioner of Baseball to be the highest and final authority over baseball as an organized, professional sport in the United States. He established the precedent that the league invested the commissioner with plenary power and the responsibility to determine the fitness or suitability of anyone, anything, or any circumstance, to be associated with professional baseball, past, present and future.

====Banned players====

Landis banned eight members of the 1919 White Sox team for their involvement in the fix:
* Arnold &quot;Chick&quot; Gandil, first baseman. The ringleader of the players who were in on the fix. He did not play in the majors in 1920; he played semi-pro ball instead. In a 1956 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article, Gandil expressed remorse for the scheme. Still, he wrote that the players had actually abandoned the scheme when it became apparent that they would be watched closely. According to Gandil, the players&#x27; numerous errors resulted from fear of being watched. However, he conceded that the players deserved to be banned just for talking to the gamblers. Gandil died in 1970.
* Eddie Cicotte, pitcher. Admitted involvement in the fix. Cicotte died in 1969.
* Oscar &quot;Happy&quot; Felsch, center fielder. Felsch died in 1964.
* &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson, the star outfielder and one of the best hitters in the game, confessed in sworn grand jury testimony to having accepted $5,000 in cash from the gamblers. It was also Jackson&#x27;s sworn testimony that he never met or spoke to any of the gamblers and was only told about the fix through conversations with other Sox players. The other participants informed Jackson that he would receive $20,000 cash divided into equal payments after each loss. Jackson testified that he played to win in the entire Series and did nothing on the field to throw any of the games in any way. His roommate, pitcher Lefty Williams, brought $5,000 in cash to their hotel room after losing Game Four and threw it down as they were packing to travel back to Cincinnati; this was the only money that Jackson received at any time. Jackson later recanted his confession and professed his innocence to no effect until he died in 1951. The extent of his collaboration with the scheme is hotly debated.
* Fred McMullin, utility infielder. McMullin would not have been included in the fix had he not overheard the other players&#x27; conversations. His role as team scout may have had more impact on the fix since he saw minimal playing time in the series. McMullin died in 1952.
* Charles &quot;Swede&quot; Risberg, shortstop. Risberg was Gandil&#x27;s assistant and the &quot;muscle&quot; of the playing group. He went 2-for-25 at the plate and committed four errors in the series. Risberg died in 1975, being the last living Black Sox player.
* George &quot;Buck&quot; Weaver, third baseman. Weaver attended the initial meetings, and while he did not go in on the fix, he knew about it. In an interview in 1956, Gandil said that it was Weaver&#x27;s idea to get the money upfront from the gamblers. Landis banished Weaver on this basis, stating, &quot;Men associating with crooks and gamblers could expect no leniency.&quot; On January 13, 1922, Weaver unsuccessfully applied for reinstatement. Like Jackson, he continued to profess his innocence to successive baseball commissioners to no effect until he died in 1956.
* Claude &quot;Lefty&quot; Williams, pitcher. Went 0–3 with a 6.63 ERA for the series. Only one other pitcher in baseball history, reliever George Frazier of the 1981 New York Yankees, has ever lost three games in one World Series. The third game Williams lost was Game Eight – baseball&#x27;s decision to revert to a best-of-seven Series in 1922 significantly reduced the opportunity for a pitcher to obtain three decisions in a Series. Williams died in 1959.

Also banned was Joe Gedeon, second baseman for the St. Louis Browns. A friend of Risberg, Gedeon learned about the fix from Risberg and placed bets on Cincinnati. He informed Comiskey of the fix after the Series to gain a reward. Instead, Landis banned him for life along with the eight White Sox, and Gedeon died in 1941.

The indefinite suspensions imposed by Landis in connection to the scandal were the most suspensions of any duration to be simultaneously imposed until 2013, when thirteen players were suspended for between 50 and 211 games in connection with the doping Biogenesis scandal.

====Joe Jackson====

The extent of Jackson&#x27;s part in the scheme remains controversial. He had a Series-leading .375 batting average—including the Series&#x27; only home run—threw out five baserunners and handled thirty chances in the outfield with no errors. In general, players perform worse in games their team loses, and Jackson batted worse in the five games that the White Sox lost, with a batting average of .286 in losing games. This was still an above-average batting average (the National and American Leagues hit a combined .263 in the 1919 season). Jackson hit .351 for the season, fourth-best in the major leagues (his .356 career batting average is the fourth-best in history, surpassed only by Ty Cobb, Oscar Charleston and Rogers Hornsby) – each a MLB batting average leader. Three of his six RBIs came in the losses, including the aforementioned home run, and a double in Game Eight when the Reds had a significant lead and the series was all but over. Still, in that game, a long foul ball was caught at the fence with runners on second and third, depriving Jackson of a chance to drive in the runners.

One play in particular has been subjected to scrutiny. In the fifth inning of Game Four, with a Cincinnati player on second, Jackson fielded a single hit to left field and threw home, which was cut off by Cicotte. Gandil, another leader of the fix, later admitted to yelling at Cicotte to intercept the throw. The run scored, and the Sox lost 2–0. Cicotte, whose guilt is undisputed, made two errors in that fifth inning alone.

Years later, all the implicated players said that Jackson was never present at their meetings with the gamblers. Williams, Jackson&#x27;s roommate, later said they only mentioned Jackson in hopes of giving them more credibility with the gamblers.

===Aftermath===
After being banned, Risberg and several other members of the Black Sox tried to organize a three-state barnstorming tour. However, they were forced to cancel those plans after Landis let it be known that anyone who played with or against them would also be banned from baseball for life. They then announced plans to play a regular exhibition game every Sunday in Chicago, but the Chicago City Council threatened to cancel the license of any ballpark that hosted them.

With seven of their best players permanently sidelined, the White Sox crashed into seventh place in 1921 and would not be a factor in a pennant race again until 1936, five years after Comiskey&#x27;s death. They would not win another American League championship until 1959 (a then-record forty-year gap) nor another World Series until , prompting some to comment about a Curse of the Black Sox.

===Name===
Although many believe the Black Sox name to be related to the dark and corrupt nature of the conspiracy, the term &quot;Black Sox&quot; may already have existed before the fix. There is a story that the name &quot;Black Sox&quot; derived from Comiskey&#x27;s refusal to pay for the players&#x27; uniforms to be laundered, instead insisting that the players themselves pay for the cleaning. As the story goes, the players refused, and subsequent games saw the White Sox play in progressively filthier uniforms as dirt, sweat, and grime collected on the white, woolen uniforms until they took on a much darker shade. Comiskey then had the uniforms washed and deducted the laundry bill from the players&#x27; salaries. On the other hand, Eliot Asinof in his book &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; makes no such connection, mentioning the filthy uniforms early on but referring to the term &quot;Black Sox&quot; only in connection with the scandal.

<text>In neuroanatomy, the mandibular nerve (V) is the largest of the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve, the fifth cranial nerve (CN V). Unlike the other divisions of the trigeminal nerve (ophthalmic nerve, maxillary nerve) which contain only afferent fibers, the mandibular nerve contains both afferent and efferent fibers. These nerve fibers innervate structures of the lower jaw and face, such as the tongue, lower lip, and chin. The mandibular nerve also innervates the muscles of mastication.

==Structure==

=== Course ===
The large sensory root of mandibular nerve emerges from the lateral part of the trigeminal ganglion and exits the cranial cavity through the foramen ovale. The motor root (Latin: &quot;radix motoria&quot; s. &quot;portio minor&quot;), the small motor root of the trigeminal nerve, passes under the trigeminal ganglion and through the foramen ovale to unite with the sensory root just outside the skull.

The mandibular nerve immediately passes between tensor veli palatini, which is medial, and lateral pterygoid, which is lateral, and gives off a meningeal branch (nervus spinosus) and the nerve to medial pterygoid from its medial side. The nerve then divides into a small anterior division and a large posterior division.

===Branches===
The mandibular nerve gives off the following branches:
* From the main trunk (before the division):
** meningeal branch (nervus spinosus) (sensory)
** medial pterygoid nerve (motor)
* From the anterior division:
** masseteric nerve (mixed)
** deep temporal nerves (mixed)
** buccal nerve (sensory)
** lateral pterygoid nerve (motor)
* From the posterior division:
** auriculotemporal nerve (sensory)
** lingual nerve (sensory)
** inferior alveolar nerve (mixed) 
***mylohyoid nerve (motor)
***incisive branch (sensory)
***mental nerve (sensory)

<text>Agustín Moreto y Cavana (April, 1618, Madrid28 October 1669), was a Spanish Catholic priest and dramatist.

==Biography==
Of Italian descent, his exact date of birth is unknown, but he was baptized at Madrid on 9 April 1618. He attended the University of Alcalá de Henares between 1634 and 1637, studying logic and physics and receiving his Licentiate in December 1639. By 1643, he had been ordained a cleric in minor orders, with a benefice, and had also, in all probability, begun his dramatic writing. By the middle of the century he was already a recognized literary figure and a member of the Academia Castellana. He published the first volume of his comedies (called the &quot;Primera Parte&quot;) in 1654; &quot;El desdén, con el desdén&quot; (literally &quot;Disdain with Disdain&quot;), one of his most popular and famous comedies, first appeared in print in this edition.

He lived in Madrid till 1654, when he moved to Toledo, and became chaplain to the primate Baltasar de Moscoso y Sandoval. Sometime after 1657, Agustín was ordained a priest, at which time he seems to have cut back on his dramatic activity. At the Archbishop&#x27;s request, he entered the Brotherhood of San Pedro in 1659 in order to help administer the Hospital of San Nicolás. He lived in the hospital grounds until his death ten years later, leaving unfinished his final work, a play about St. Rose of Lima. He was buried in the Church of St. John the Baptist in Toledo. His play, &quot;Santa Rosa&quot;, was completed by Pedro Francisco de Lanini. The second and third volumes of his collected works appeared in 1676.

The most celebrated of his pieces is &quot;El Desdén con el Desdén&quot;, imitated by Molière in &quot;La Princesse d&#x27;Elide&quot;, by Carlo Gozzi in &quot;La principessa filosofa&quot;, and by Schreyvogel in &quot;Donna Diana&quot;. It is characteristic that four episodes in &quot;El Desdén con el Desdén&quot; are taken from four separate plays of Lope de Vega&#x27;s (&quot;La vengadora de las mujeres&quot;, &quot;Los milagros del desprecio&quot;, &quot;De corsario a corsario&quot;, and &quot;La Hermosa fea&quot;).

Moreto borrowed from Castro, Tirso de Molina and others to a considerable extent, but his adaptation shows great dexterity and charm.

==Musical adaptations==
Emil von Reznicek wrote an opera &quot;Donna Diana&quot; in 1894, based on &quot;El Desdén con el Desdén&quot;. Its overture remains a popular concert piece. Carl Maria von Weber also wrote incidental music to the play in 1817.

<doc id="304361" wikidata="Q893130" url="?curid=304361" title="Boot disk">
<text>A boot disk is a removable digital data storage medium from which a computer can load and run (boot) an operating system or utility program. The computer must have a built-in program which will load and execute a program from a boot disk meeting certain standards.

While almost all modern computers can boot from a hard drive containing the operating system and other software, they would not normally be called boot disks (because they are not removable media). Fixed drives (such as hard drives) that are bootable may be called &quot;boot drives&quot;. CD-ROMs are the most common forms of media used, but other media, such as magnetic or paper tape drives, ZIP drives, and more recently USB flash drives can be used. The computer&#x27;s BIOS must support booting from the device in question.

One can make one&#x27;s own &quot;boot disk&quot; (typically done to prepare for when the system won&#x27;t start properly).

== Uses ==
Boot disks are used for:

* Operating system installation
* Data recovery
* Data purging
* Hardware or software troubleshooting
* BIOS flashing
* Customizing an operating environment
* Software demonstration
* Running a temporary operating environment, such as when using a Live USB drive.
* Administrative access in case of lost password is possible with an appropriate boot disk with some operating systems
* Games (e.g. for Amiga home computers, running MS-DOS video games on modern computers by using a bootable MS-DOS or FreeDOS USB flash drive).

== Process ==
The term &quot;boot&quot; comes from the idea of lifting oneself by one&#x27;s own bootstraps: the computer contains a tiny program (bootstrap loader) which will load and run a program found on a boot device. This program may itself be a small program designed to load a larger and more capable program, i.e., the full operating system. To enable booting without the requirement either for a mass storage device or to write to the boot medium, it is usual for the boot program to use some system RAM as a RAM disk for temporary file storage.

As an example, any computer compatible with the IBM PC is able with built-in software to load the contents of the first 512 bytes of a floppy and to execute it if it is a viable program; boot floppies have a very simple loader program in these bytes. The process is vulnerable to abuse; data floppies could have a virus written to their first sector which silently infects the host computer if switched on with the disk in the drive.

== Media ==
Bootable floppy disks (&quot;boot floppies&quot;) for PCs usually contain DOS or miniature versions of Linux. The most commonly available floppy disk can hold only 1.4 MB of data in its standard format, making it impractical for loading large operating systems. The use of boot floppies is in decline, due to the availability of other higher-capacity options, such as CD-ROMs or USB flash drives.

==Device selection==
A modern PC is configured to attempt to boot from various devices in a certain order. If a computer is not booting from the device desired, such as the floppy drive, the user may have to enter the BIOS Setup function by pressing a special key when the computer is first turned on (such as , , , or ), and then changing the boot order. More recent BIOSes permit the interruption of the final stage of the boot process and invoke the Boot Menu by pressing a function key (usually or ). This results in a list of bootable devices being presented, from which a selection may be made.

Apple silicon Macs display the Boot Menu when the power button is pressed and held, the older Mac computers with Intel processors will display the Boot Menu if user presses the or while the machine is starting.

== Requirements ==
Different operating systems use different boot disk contents. All boot disks must be compatible with the computer they are designed for.

; MS-DOS/PC DOS/DR-DOS:
*A valid boot sector in form of a volume boot record (VBR)
*IO.SYS or IBMBIO.COM
*MSDOS.SYS or IBMDOS.COM
*COMMAND.COM
All files must be for the same version of the operating system. Complete boot disks can be prepared in one operation by an installed operating system; details vary.

; FreeDOS:
*A valid boot sector on the disk
*COMMAND.COM
*KERNEL.SYS

; Linux:
*A bootloader such as SYSLINUX or GRUB
*Linux kernel
*Initial ram disk (initrd)

; Windows Preinstallation Environment:
*Windows Boot Manager
*BOOT.WIM

<doc id="304366" wikidata="Q457209" url="?curid=304366" title="Guillén de Castro y Bellvis">
<text>Guillén de Castro y Mateo (1569 – 28 July 1631) was a Spanish dramatist of the Spanish Golden Age. He was distinguished member of the &quot;Nocturnos&quot;, a Spanish version of the &quot;Academies&quot; in Italy.

==Life==
A Valencian by birth, he soon achieved a literary reputation. In 1591 he joined a local literary academy called the &quot;Nocturnos&quot;. At one time a captain of the coast guard, at another the protégé of Benavente, viceroy of Naples, who appointed him governor of Scigliano, patronized by Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna and Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, Castro was nominated a knight of the order of Santiago in 1623. He settled at Madrid in 1626, but died there in such poverty that his funeral expenses were defrayed by charity.

== Career ==
He probably made the acquaintance of Lope de Vega at the festivals (1620–1622) held to commemorate the beatification and canonization of St Isidore, the patron saint of Madrid. On the latter occasion Castro&#x27;s &quot;octavas&quot; were awarded the first prize. Lope de Vega dedicated to him a celebrated play entitled &quot;Las Almenas de Toro&quot; (1619), and when Castro&#x27;s &quot;Comedias&quot; were published in 1618-1621 he dedicated the first volume to Lope de Vega&#x27;s daughter.

The drama that has made Castro&#x27;s reputation is &quot;Las Mocedades del Cid&quot; (c. 1605–1615), to the first part of which Pierre Corneille was largely indebted for the materials of his tragedy. The two parts of this play, like all those by Castro, have the genuine ring of the old romances; and, from their intense nationality, no less than for their primitive poetry and flowing versification, were among the most popular pieces of their day.

Castro&#x27;s &quot;Fuerza de la costumbre&quot; is the source of &quot;Love&#x27;s Cure&quot;, a play in the John Fletcher canon. He is also the reputed author of &quot;El Prodigio de los Montes&quot;, from which Calderón derived &quot;El Mágico prodigioso&quot;. Sometime between 1605 and 1608, Castro wrote a &quot;comedia&quot; titled &quot;Don Quixote de la Mancha&quot;, a play based upon some parts of Cervantes&#x27; novel of the same name. The play includes a dramatisation of the story of Cardenio in the novel. Some critics believe that Castro&#x27;s play may be a link between the Cardenio story in Cervantes&#x27; novel and William Shakespeare and John Fletcher&#x27;s (now lost) 1612 play &quot;Cardenio&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Guardian&quot; was a net laying ship of the Royal Navy, launched in 1932 and scrapped in 1962. She was also equipped for target towing and gunnery photography. A second net-layer, , was built to a modified design. Launched in 1936 &quot;Protector&quot; was scrapped in 1970.

==Service history==
&quot;Guardian&quot; was ordered as part of the 1930 naval programme, the first purpose built netlayer for the Royal Navy. She was laid down at Chatham Dockyard on 15 October 1931, was launched on 1 September 1932 and completed on 13 June 1933.

&quot;Guardian&quot; served in the Indian Ocean between 1941 and 1942. She took part in the invasion of Madagascar and helped build a base in the Maldives at Addu Atoll in 1942 in case Ceylon fell into Japanese hands. She also built two more bases for the protection of merchant ships assembling for convoys: one was near Mombasa and the other near Cape Town. &quot;Guardian&quot; then returned to Gibraltar and took part in the invasion of Algeria at Oran (Mers-el-Kebir) in 1942. Afterwards, she returned to Belfast for a refit and the fitting of additional anti-aircraft weaponry. Later, she took part in the invasions of Sicily (Operation Husky) and Italy.

In 1952, &quot;Guardian&quot; was taken out of the Reserve Fleet storage on the River Tamar between Devonport and Saltash and towed to Newport for a refit and modernisation, which was completed in 1954. She was then mothballed and returned to rejoin the reserve fleet at Plymouth.

<text>A tall ship is a large, traditionally-rigged sailing vessel. Popular modern tall ship rigs include topsail schooners, brigantines, brigs and barques. &quot;Tall ship&quot; can also be defined more specifically by an organization, such as for a race or festival.

==History==

Traditional rigging may include square rigs and gaff rigs, usually with separate topmasts and topsails. It is generally more complex than modern rigging, which utilizes newer materials such as aluminum and steel to construct taller, lightweight masts with fewer, more versatile sails. Most smaller, modern vessels use the Bermuda rig. 

Author and master mariner Joseph Conrad (who spent 1874 to 1894 at sea in tall ships and was quite particular about naval terminology) used the term &quot;tall ship&quot; in his works; for example, in &quot;The Mirror of the Sea&quot; in 1906. 

Henry David Thoreau also references the term &quot;tall ship&quot; in his first work, &quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot;, quoting &quot;Down out at its mouth, the dark inky main blending with the blue above. Plum Island, its sand ridges scolloping along the horizon like the sea-serpent, and the distant outline broken by many a tall ship, leaning, still, against the sky.&quot; He does not cite this quotation, but the work was written in 1849.

While Sail Training International (STI) has extended the definition of &quot;tall ship&quot; for the purpose of its races to embrace any sailing vessel with more than waterline length and on which at least half the people on board are aged 15 to 25.

==Sail Training International==
In the 21st century, &quot;tall ship&quot; is often used generically for large, classic, sailing vessels, but is also a technically defined term by Sail Training International for its purposes and STI helped popularize the term. The exact definitions have changed somewhat over time, and are subject to various technicalities, but by 2011 there were 4 classes (A, B, C, and D). There are only two size classes, A is over 40 m LOA, and B/C/D are 9.14 m to under 40 m LOA. The definitions have to do with rigging: class A is for square sail rigged ships, class B is for &quot;traditionally rigged&quot; ships, class C is for &quot;modern rigged&quot; vessels with no &quot;spinnaker-like sails&quot;, and class D is the same as class C but carrying a spinnaker-like sail.

===Class A===

All square-rigged vessels (barque, barquentine, brig, brigantine or ship rigged) and all other vessels more than 40 metres length overall (LOA), regardless of rig. STI classifies its A Class as &quot;all square-rigged vessels and all other vessels over length overall (LOA)&quot;, in this case STI LOA excludes bowsprit and aft spar. STI defines LOA as &quot;Length overall measured from the fore side of stem post
to aft side of stern post, counter or transom&quot;.

===Class B===
Traditionally rigged vessels (i.e. gaff rigged sloops, ketches, yawls and schooners) with an LOA of less than 40 metres and with a waterline length (LWL) of at least 9.14 metres, one good example is &quot;Spirit of Bermuda&quot;.

===Class C===
Modern rigged vessels (i.e. Bermudan rigged sloops, ketches, yawls and schooners) with an LOA of less than 40 metres and with a waterline length (LWL) of at least 9.14 metres not carrying spinnaker-like sails.

===Class D===
Modern rigged vessels (i.e. Bermudan-rigged sloops, ketches, yawls and schooners) with an LOA of less than 40 metres and with a waterline length (LWL) of at least 9.14 metres carrying spinnaker-like sails. There are also a variety of other rules and regulations for the crew, such as ages, and also for a rating rule. There are other sail festivals and races with their own standards, the STI is just one set of standards for their purposes.

==Earlier description of classes==
An older definition of class &quot;A&quot; by the STI was &quot;all square-rigged vessels over 120′ (36.6 m) length overall (LOA). Fore and aft rigged vessels of 160′ (48.8 m) (LOA) and over&quot;. By LOA they meant length excluding bowsprit and aft spar.

Class &quot;B&quot; was &quot;all fore and aft rigged vessels between 100 and 160 feet in length, and all square rigged vessels under 120′ (36.6 m) (LOA)&quot;.

See also a list of class &quot;A&quot; ships with lengths including bowsprit.

==Lost tall ships==
Tall ships are sometimes lost, such as by a storm at sea. Some examples of lost tall ships include:

* &quot;Asgard II&quot;, an Irish national sail training ship, commissioned in 1982, was lost in 2008 off the French coast. The two-masted brigantine is thought to have collided with a submerged object.
* &quot;Astrid&quot; ran aground in 2013 off Ireland, and then broke up in 2014 after being salvaged
* &quot;Bounty&quot;, a full-rig ship lost off the North Carolina coast as Hurricane Sandy approached in 2012.
* &quot;Concordia&quot;, a triple-mast barquentine built in 1992 and operated by Canada as a school ship; lost at sea in 2010, in a squall.
* &quot;Endeavour II&quot;, built in 1968; wrecked in a 1971 gale off New Zealand
* &quot;Fantome&quot;, a former yacht built in 1927, then operated as a cruise ship. Was lost in Hurricane Mitch in 1998.
* &quot;Lennie&quot;, built in 1871, ran aground on Digby Neck in 1889.
* &quot;Marques&quot;, built in 1917; was lost in a 1984 Tall Ships Race.

<text>Carlo, Count Gozzi (; 13 December 1720 – 4 April 1806) was an Italian (Venetian) playwright and champion of &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;.

==Early life ==
Gozzi was born and died in Venice; he came from a family of minor Venetian aristocracy, the Tiepolos. At a young age, his parents were no longer able to support him financially, so he joined the army in Dalmatia. Three years later, he had returned to Venice and joined the Granelleschi Society. This society was dedicated to preserving Tuscan literature from the influence of foreign culture; it was particularly interested in handing down traditional Italian comedic performance: the &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;.

==Works ==
Pietro Chiari and Carlo Goldoni, two Venetian writers, were moving away from the old style of Italian theatre, which threatened the work of the Granelleschi Society. In 1757 Gozzi defended &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; by publishing a satirical poem, &quot;La tartana degli influssi per l&#x27;anno 1756&quot;; and in 1761, in his comedy based on a fairy tale, &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot; or &quot;Analisi riflessiva della fiaba L&#x27;amore delle tre melarance&quot;, he parodied Chiari and Goldoni. He engaged the Sacchi company of players, a Commedia dell&#x27;arte troupe who had had dwindling engagements because of Chiari and Goldoni&#x27;s efforts. Their acting was informed by personal vendetta, making the play an extraordinary success. Gozzi donated his play and the rest of his fairy tales to Sacchi&#x27;s troupe, in effect saving the company. Gozzi&#x27;s efforts on behalf of the genre were anachronistic, since Gozzi wrote out all his scripts. whereas traditional Commedia dell&#x27;arte was always improvised.

Struck by the effect produced on the audience by the introduction of the supernatural or mythical element, which he had merely used as a convenient medium for his satirical purposes, Gozzi produced a series of dramatic pieces based on fairy tales. These were hugely popular, but after Sacchi&#x27;s company disbanded, they were unjustly neglected. Gozzi&#x27;s fairy tales drew influence from &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, and the popularity of them caused a revival of Commedia dell&#x27;arte in Italy. These fairy tales were much praised by Goethe, Schlegel brothers, Hoffmann, Madame de Staël, Sismondi and Ostrovsky. One of them, &quot;Turandot&quot; or &quot;La Turandotte&quot;, was translated by Friedrich Schiller and staged by Goethe in Weimar in 1802 with great success. Gozzi was acclaimed throughout most of Europe, but was less esteemed in his own homeland.

In the last years of Gozzi&#x27;s life he had begun to experiment by producing tragedies with largely comical influences, but these endeavors were met with harsh critical response. He then began to work in Spanish drama, and found minor success before his death. He was buried in the church of San Cassiano in Venice.

==Personal life ==
His feuds with Carlo Goldoni and Pietro Chiari between 1756-1762 were legion. They argued over the changing style of Italian theatre and Gozzi&#x27;s concern about losing &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;.

He was the titular protector of the actress Teodora Ricci. When Pier Antonio Gratarol, a member of Venetian society whom Gozzi&#x27;s &quot;Draghe d&#x27;Amore&quot; was partially based on, had an affair with her, Gozzi was instrument in Gratrol&#x27;s exile.

The writer Gasparo Gozzi was his brother.

His collected works were published under his own superintendence at Venice in 1792, in 10 volumes.

A number of twentieth-century stage works were inspired by Gozzi&#x27;s plays. These include treatments of &quot;Turandot&quot; by Karl Vollmöller and Bertolt Brecht, operas based on the same story by Ferruccio Busoni, and, more famously, Giacomo Puccini, Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love of Three Oranges&quot;, Alfredo Casella&#x27;s &quot;La donna serpente&quot; and Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s &quot;König Hirsch&quot;. He shares his tomb with his brother Gasparo Gozzi at the San Michele cemetery on the Isola di San Michele.

<text>The Battle of Toulon took place on 21 and 22 February 1744 NS near the French Mediterranean port of Toulon. Although France was not yet at war with Britain, ships from their Levant Fleet supported an attempt by a Spanish force trapped in Toulon to break through the British Mediterranean Fleet.

The initial engagement on 21 February was indecisive, and the British continued their pursuit until midday on 22nd before their commander, Admiral Thomas Mathews, called off the chase. With several of his ships in need of repair, he withdrew to Menorca, which meant the British Royal Navy temporarily lost control of the waters around Italy and allowed the Spanish to take the offensive against Savoy.

In his report, Mathews blamed his subordinate Richard Lestock for the failure to secure victory, and the issue was hotly debated in Parliament. At the subsequent court-martial, Mathews was held responsible and dismissed from the navy in June 1747, while Lestock&#x27;s political connections meant he was cleared of all charges. Another seven captains were removed from command for failing to engage the enemy and the investigation led to changes that required individual captains to be far more aggressive.

==Background==
The immediate cause of the War of the Austrian Succession was the death in 1740 of Emperor Charles VI, last male Habsburg. This left his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, as heir to the Habsburg monarchy, whose laws excluded women from the succession. The 1713 Pragmatic Sanction waived this and allowed her to inherit, but this was challenged by Charles Albert of Bavaria, the closest male heir.

While the House of Habsburg was the largest single component of the Holy Roman Empire, its pre-eminent position was challenged by rivals like Bavaria, Saxony and Prussia. With the help of France, these states turned a dynastic dispute into a European conflict and in January 1742 Charles of Bavaria became the first non-Habsburg Emperor in nearly 300 years. He was opposed by Maria Theresa and the so-called Pragmatic Allies, which in addition to Austria included Britain, Hanover and the Dutch Republic.

Although French and British troops fought against each other at Dettingen in June 1743, the two kingdoms were not yet formally at war. In contrast, Spain and Britain had been fighting the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear since 1739, primarily in Spanish America, but also in the Mediterranean, where in 1742 a Spanish squadron led by Juan José Navarro took refuge in the French naval base of Toulon and were prevented from leaving by the British Mediterranean Fleet under Admiral Thomas Mathews. In the 1743 Treaty of Fontainebleau, Louis XV of France and his uncle Philip V of Spain, agreed to a joint invasion of Britain and by late January 1744, more than 12,000 French troops and transports had been assembled at Dunkirk.

In an attempt to divert British naval resources from the invasion route, Navarro was ordered to force his way out of Toulon and make for the Atlantic, supported by the French Levant Fleet under Claude Bruyère. 
Their opponent, Thomas Mathews, had entered the Royal Navy in 1690 and enjoyed a solid if unspectacular career before being appointed Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean in 1742. He had a poor relationship with his deputy Richard Lestock, a fact recognised by both officers who had each separately requested that Lestock be reassigned, a request ignored by the Admiralty. The tension between the two men meant Mathews failed to properly discuss tactics with his subordinate prior to the battle, a factor which partially contributed to the later confusion over orders.

==Battle==
On 21 February 1744, the combined Franco-Spanish fleet of twenty-seven ships of the line and three frigates put to sea with Mathews in pursuit. The British ships were generally larger and more heavily armed than their opponents, carrying over 25% more cannons overall. Both fleets adopted the traditional formation of vanguard, centre and rear, with Navarro and the Spanish ships in front, followed by two French squadrons. On the British side, Mathews led the van, William Rowley the centre, and Lestock the rear.

Light winds made manoeuvring difficult and caused the two fleets to become spread out but around 11:30 early in the evening of 21 February, the fleets began to approach each other and prepare for battle, with Mathews signalling his ships to form line of battle. Since the line had not been properly formed as night fell, Mathews hoisted the signal to come to or halt by turning into the wind, intending his ships to first finish forming the line. The van and centre squadrons complied with this instruction, but the rear under Lestock obeyed the order to halt immediately, without having formed the line.

By daybreak on 23 February, the rear of the British fleet was separated by a considerable distance from the van and centre. Mathews signalled Lestock to make more sail, reluctant to start the attack with his ships still disorganised, but the slowness of his response caused the Franco-Spanish force to start to slip away to the south. Mathews feared they would escape him and pass through the Strait of Gibraltar to join the French force gathered at Brest for the planned invasion of Britain.

Knowing his duty was to attack, Mathews hoisted the signal to engage the enemy aboard his flagship , and at 1:00 pm left the line to attack the Spanish rear, followed by Captain James Cornewall aboard . His earlier signal to form line of battle was still flying, causing confusion among his subordinates. Some followed Mathews, but others were either uncertain which orders to follow, or in Lestock&#x27;s case, allegedly unwilling to do so.

Outnumbered and largely unsupported, &quot;Namur&quot; and &quot;Marlborough&quot; successfully engaged their opposite numbers, but suffered considerable damage. At the rear of the ships being attacked, five more Spanish ships followed, at some distance due to the slow speed of the one ahead: &quot;Brillante, San Fernando, Halcon, Soberbio&quot; and &quot;Santa Isabel&quot;. There was some exchange of fire between these and the lead ships of the British rear. Most of Lestock&#x27;s ships in the rear remained inactive during the battle.

The main action was being fought around &quot;Real Felipe&quot;, Navarro&#x27;s flagship. &quot;Marlborough&quot; purposefully crossed the Spanish line, but suffered such severe damage that she was deemed to be on the verge of sinking. The &quot;Hercules&quot;, astern of the &quot;Real Felipe&quot;, vigorously fought off three British ships. The &quot;Constante&quot;, immediately ahead of the flagship, repelled the attack of a British ship-of-the-line, which was promptly replaced by two more, with which she continued to fight for nearly three hours.

The French ships came about at 5:00 pm to aid the Spanish, a manoeuvre interpreted by some of the British commanders as an attempt to double the British line and surround them. The Spanish, still on the defensive, neglected to capture the defenceless &quot;Marlborough&quot;, though they did retake the &quot;Poder&quot;, which had previously surrendered to the British. The Franco-Spanish fleet then resumed their flight to the southwest, and it was not until 23 February that the British were able to regroup and resume the pursuit. They caught up with the enemy fleet again, which was hampered by towing damaged ships, and the unmanoeuvrable &quot;Poder&quot; was abandoned and scuttled by the French. By now the British had closed to within a few miles of the enemy fleet, but Mathews again signalled for the fleet to come to. The following day, 24 February, the Franco-Spanish fleet was almost out of sight, and Mathews returned to Hyères and sailed from there to Port Mahon, where he arrived in early March.

==Aftermath==
While the battle was indecisive, Mathews&#x27; withdrawal to Menorca temporarily lifted the blockade of the Gallispan army in Northern Italy, allowing them to take the offensive. However, it also led to recriminations among their opponents, with the Spanish viewing it as a near victory undone by the poor performance of the French. Navarro was given the title &quot;Marqués de la Victoria&quot; by Philip V of Spain, who insisted de la Bruyère be removed from command. The animosity generated by these actions minimised future co-operation between the Spanish and French. Navarro and his ships spent the rest of war trapped in Cartagena by Rowley, who succeeded Mathews as commander in the Mediterranean.

France declared war on Britain and Hanover in March, then invaded the Austrian Netherlands in May. These consequences were blamed on the alleged failure of the British fleet to defeat an inferior opponent, although modern historians argue they had been agreed in October 1743 and were unaffected by Toulon. Parliament demanded a public enquiry, and at the subsequent court-martial, seven captains were cashiered for failing to do their &quot;utmost&quot; to engage the enemy as required by the Articles of War, another two were acquitted, while one died before trial.

Mathews was also court-martialled on charges of having brought the fleet into action in a disorganised manner and failing to attack the enemy when the conditions were advantageous. Although his personal courage was not in question, he was found guilty of failing to comply with the official &quot;Fighting Instructions&quot; which required him to engage in &quot;Line of battle&quot;, and dismissed from the navy in June 1747. Despite ignoring his commander&#x27;s orders, Lestock was acquitted because in doing so he followed the precise letter of the instructions and was promoted Admiral of the Blue, although he died shortly afterwards in December 1746.

The judgements were unpopular with the public, a contemporary declaring &quot;The nation could not be persuaded...Lestock should be pardoned for not fighting, and Mathews cashiered for fighting&quot;. His acquittal was largely due to political connections, and Parliament responded in 1749 by enhancing the autonomy of the naval courts. At the same time, Article XII of the &quot;Fighting Instructions&quot; was amended to be far more specific in the penalty for not engaging the enemy, a change that later resulted in the execution of Admiral Byng.

<text>Charles Rodway Clarke (born 21 September 1950) is a British Labour Party politician who held various Cabinet positions under Prime Minister Tony Blair from 2001 to 2006, lastly as Home Secretary from December 2004 to May 2006. Clarke was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Norwich South from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==

The son of Civil Service Permanent Secretary Sir Richard Clarke, Charles Rodway Clarke was born in London on Thursday, 21 September 1950. He attended the fee-paying Highgate School where he was Head Boy. He then studied Mathematics and Economics at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he also served as the president of the Cambridge Students&#x27; Union.

A member of the Broad Left faction, he was president of the National Union of Students from 1975 to 1977. Clarke had joined the Labour Party by then and was active in the Clause Four group. Clarke was the British representative on the Permanent Commission for the World Youth Festival (Cuba) from 1977 to 1978.

===Local government===
He was elected as a local councillor in the London Borough of Hackney, being chair of its Housing Committee and vice chair of economic development from 1980 to 1986. He worked as a researcher, and later chief of staff, for Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock from February 1981 to 1992. He was Kinnock&#x27;s chief of staff from 1985 onwards.

His long association with Kinnock and with the general election defeat in 1992 was expected to handicap him in his career, but Clarke bounced back. He spent the mid-1990s away from national politics, working in the private sector – from 1992 to 1997, he was chief executive of Quality Public Affairs, a public affairs management consultancy – and subsequently emerged as a high flyer under the Labour leadership of Tony Blair.

==Member of Parliament==
Elected to the House of Commons in the Labour landslide of 1997, Clarke served just over a year on the back benches, before joining the government as a junior education minister in July 1998. He moved to the Home Office in 1999, and joined the Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio and Party Chair following the 2001 general election.

===Education Secretary===
He returned to Education as Secretary of State on 24 October 2002, after the resignation of Estelle Morris. As Education Secretary, he defended Oxbridge, encouraged the establishment of specialist secondary schools, and allegedly suggested that the state should not fund &quot;unproductive&quot; humanities research.

In 2003, he said in a speech to University College, Worcester: &quot;Universities exist to enable the British economy and society to deal with the challenges posed by the increasingly rapid process of global change.&quot; He explained:

He also oversaw the introduction of Bills to enable universities in parts of Britain to charge top-up fees, despite a Labour manifesto commitment that it would not introduce such fees and indeed had &#x27;legislated to prevent them&#x27;.

===Home Secretary===
Following the first resignation of David Blunkett on 15 December 2004, Clarke was appointed Home Secretary, one of the senior positions in the Cabinet.

He was swiftly at the centre of attention for his advocacy of proposals for countering terrorism. Critics suggest that his reforms to the judicial system undermine centuries of British legal precedent dating back to the 1215 Magna Carta, particularly the right to a fair trial and trial by jury. He was also criticised for the Identity Cards Act 2006, seen by some as serious infringement of privacy, but Clarke insisted that identity cards were necessary to combat terrorism.

During the 2005 British Presidency of the European Union, Clarke pressed other member states to pass a directive to require communications data to be stored for law enforcement purposes. The directive was criticised as infringing civil liberties and privacy, and critics also noted that the directive had been approved very quickly.

In 2006, Clarke scrapped an ex-gratia discretionary scheme under which compensation to those wrongly convicted of a criminal offence could be awarded. Professor John Spencer QC, of Cambridge University described the move as &quot;monstrous&quot;.

===Foreign prisoners scandal===
On 25 April 2006 it emerged that 1,023 foreign prisoners had been freed without being considered for deportation. Among the offenders, five had been convicted of committing sex offences against children, seven had served time for other sex offences, 57 for violent offences and two for manslaughter. There were also 41 burglars, 20 drug importers, 54 convicted of assault and 27 of indecent assault.

Former Home Secretary David Blunkett supported Clarke but said that &quot;heads should roll&quot; over the scandal, though many of the releases had occurred during his period as Home Secretary. The Home Office later stated that 288 were released from prison between August 2005 and March 2006, which implied that prisoners continued to be released after the matter had been brought to the attention of the government.

===Out of government===
The foreign prisoners scandal led many to call for Clarke&#x27;s resignation, not only from the opposition; Clarke reportedly offered to resign, but Tony Blair, the prime minister, refused to accept. However, in the wake of a poor Labour performance in the local council elections of 4 May 2006, Clarke was dismissed in a cabinet reshuffle, labelled biggest cabinet upheaval in the history of the Blair governments, and was replaced by Defence Secretary John Reid. Having reputedly turned down the offer of Defence Secretary by Tony Blair, Clarke became a backbencher.

At the end of June 2006, he did a series of interviews in which he criticised John Reid for claiming that the Home Office was &quot;unfit for purpose&quot;, and that the Prime Minister ought to have defended him to enable him to continue seeing through the reforms he had initiated when first appointed to the post. However, he did state that although Tony Blair had lost his sense of purpose, he wanted to see Blair continue as PM.

In September 2006, Clarke took up a consultancy post with a leading London law firm, leading to speculation he anticipated not returning to frontline politics.

===Labour leadership controversy===
On 8 September 2006, Clarke gave an interview to the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in which he criticised the &#x27;presumption&#x27; that Gordon Brown would succeed Tony Blair as prime minister, helping trigger further disputes about the Labour leadership. Clarke said of Brown&#x27;s reaction to the leadership crisis, &quot;A lot of people are very upset and cross about that. It was absolutely stupid – a stupid, stupid thing to do.&quot; He named Alan Milburn as a politician who had the stature to be prime minister instead of Brown.

Clarke furthered his attack on Brown in an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on the following day, accusing Brown of being &quot;a control freak&quot;, &quot;deluded&quot; and &quot;uncollegiate&quot;.

Clarke with Alan Milburn set up The 2020 Vision website to discuss the direction of the Labour party after Tony Blair ceased being prime minister. Some observers saw this as a way for Gordon Brown&#x27;s political opponents to create an axis against him. The website has since closed.

On 23 March 2008, Clarke published a list of 35 Labour held constituencies vulnerable to other parties if fewer than 7,500 voters switched parties away from Labour. This was interpreted by many as an attempt to force a leadership change on the Labour party.

On 4 September 2008, Clarke once again attacked Gordon Brown&#x27;s performance as leader of the Labour Party and prime minister, claiming that he only had &quot;months&quot; to improve or else should face a leadership contest. However, when asked whether he would stand as a &quot;Stalking horse&quot; to draw out stronger candidates, he confirmed that he would not.

On 1 May 2009, Clarke joined David Blunkett in criticising Gordon Brown&#x27;s leadership and declared that he was &quot;ashamed&quot; to be a Labour MP, citing the Damian McBride scandal. In September 2009, Clarke gave a speech in which he said that Brown should stand down as prime minister to help the Labour Party avoid &quot;a hammering&quot; at the 2010 General Election.

==Life after Parliament==

Clarke lost his Parliamentary seat in the 2010 General Election by a margin of just 300 votes, and declared he was unlikely to stand again for Parliament.

On 20 September 2010, it was announced that Clarke had been appointed Visiting Professor to the School of Political, Social and International Studies at the University of East Anglia. The appointment was part-time and for an initial period of three years. Since November 2010, Clarke has also been Visiting Professor of Politics and Faith in the Department of Politics, Philosophy and Religion at Lancaster University. He is a Council Member of the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Clarke is a Senior Network Member at the European Leadership Network (ELN).

===Too difficult box===
Clarke introduced the idea of the &quot;too difficult box&quot;— an explanation why politicians often opt out of taking action to fix many serious political issues. It is focused on UK politics, but the book suggests that the principles apply to other countries. Clarke originally expounded his ideas in a series of lectures at the University of East Anglia in 2011. In 2014, he launched the book &quot;The &#x27;Too Difficult&#x27; Box: The Big Issues Politicians Can&#x27;t Crack&quot;. The introduction, conclusion and a chapter on immigration is written by Clarke. The rest of the book contains individual chapters (edited by Clarke) by past or current politicians or political commentators—each chapter covering a specific political issue considered to be in the too difficult box. 

Some reasons Clarke that gives explaining why politicians find some issues too difficult to deal with are: difficulty identifying the problem; difficulty identifying the solution; difficulty working out how to implement a solution; difficulty overcoming vested interests; existing legal constraints; the lengthy process required to bring in legislation; and a lack of political energy.

==Personal life==
Clarke married Carol Pearson, granddaughter of August Maramaa in Hackney, London, in 1984. They have two sons, both born in Hackney: Christopher Richard Clarke (born 1987) and Matthew Jack Clarke (born 1990). Previously resident in Norwich, they now live in Cambridge. Clarke speaks Cuban Spanish (a legacy of his student links with Cuba), French, and German.

In 2004, he became a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society to acknowledge its contribution to education and in memory of his father, who had been a statistician. Clarke is an avid supporter of Norwich City Football Club.

In July 2018 he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) from the University of East Anglia.

<text>Stolen Kisses () is a 1968 French romantic comedy-drama film directed by François Truffaut, starring Jean-Pierre Léaud, Delphine Seyrig, and Claude Jade. It continues the story of the character Antoine Doinel, whom Truffaut had previously depicted in &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (1959) and the short film &quot;Antoine and Colette&quot; (1962). In this film, Antoine begins his relationship with Christine Darbon, which is depicted further in the last two films in the series, &quot;Bed &amp; Board&quot; (1970) and &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1979).

The original French title of the film comes from a line in Charles Trenet&#x27;s song &quot;Que reste-t-il de nos amours ?,&quot; which is also used as the film&#x27;s signature tune. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

The film begins with a pan onto the locked gates of the Cinémathèque Française, then based at the Palais de Chaillot. On the gates, there is a sign &#x27;Relache&#x27; (&#x27;Closed&#x27;). This is Truffaut&#x27;s reference to the Affaire Langlois when the head of the Cinémathèque had been fired by the French government. He was eventually reinstated after filmmakers such as Truffaut used all their wiles to foment protest.

==Plot==
Antoine Doinel, now a young man, is discharged from the army as unfit, because he prefers to read novels and write to his sweetheart, violinist Christine Darbon, than to obey his superiors. He has written to Christine voluminously (but, she says, not always nicely) while in the military, sometimes more than once a day. However, she never wrote him back.

Christine is away skiing with friends when Antoine arrives, and her parents must entertain him themselves, though glad to see him. After learning that Antoine needs a job, Christine&#x27;s parents help him get hired as a night clerk in the Hôtel Alsina, where he spends most of his time reading. Christine goes to see him there, and, after not seeing each other for such a long time, they seem to hit it off. One morning, a man accompanied by a private detective makes Antoine lead them to a room where a woman has recently checked in. The woman turns out to be the man&#x27;s wife and is sharing the bed with someone else when Antoine and company enter her room. Furious, the woman&#x27;s husband starts trashing the room. Antoine gets blamed for the resulting commotion and loses his job. However, he later strikes up a friendship with the detective and gets hired at the latter&#x27;s agency.

Antoine&#x27;s detective friend teaches him the tricks of trade. The job, however, separates Antoine from Christine, as trying to pay attention to her and shadow people at the same time starts to be too much for him. One evening, Georges Tabard, the owner of a shoe store, visits the agency wanting to find out why no one seems to like him. Despite never having worked in a store and being quite clumsy, Antoine poses as a stock boy to solve that mystery. Soon, he falls for Georges&#x27;s wife, Fabienne, who willingly seduces him. Smitten with her and seeing his current romantic situation as hopeless, Antoine breaks up with Christine, saying he has never &quot;admired&quot; her. The agency starts to suspect that Fabienne is cheating on their client, and Antoine is forced to come clean. The same day he is fired from the agency, his detective mentor passes away.

Antoine eventually becomes a TV repairman and avoids Christine at all costs. One day, his poor driving skills make him crash a van with the car of Christine&#x27;s dad. However, no one gets harmed. Christine&#x27;s dad forgives him and later talks to his daughter about Antoine&#x27;s new job. To win him back, Christine deliberately disables her TV and calls Antoine&#x27;s company for repairs while her parents are away. The company sends Antoine, whose lack of skills makes him try for hours to fix a TV that is only missing a tube. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Christine reconciles with Antoine, and the two have sex. The next morning, without saying a word, Antoine propose to her, and she accepts.

The newly engaged Antoine and Christine later stroll in a park. A man who has trailed Christine for days approaches the couple and declares his love for Christine. He describes his love as &quot;permanent&quot; and unlike the &quot;temporary&quot; love of &quot;temporary people.&quot; When he walks away, Christine presumes that the man is insane. Antoine, recognising similarities in much of his own behaviour, admits, &quot;He must be.&quot;

==References to other Truffaut films==
* Early in the film, Doinel can be seen reading a French translation of the 1947 William Irish (Cornell Woolrich) novel &quot;Waltz into Darkness&quot;, the source of Truffaut&#x27;s next film, &quot;Mississippi Mermaid&quot;.
* In the first scene, Doinel reads &quot;Le Lys dans la vallée&quot; (&quot;The Lily in the Valley&quot;). It is another of Balzac&#x27;s books. 
* The character Colette Tazzi and her husband Albert make a brief cameo appearance. She chides Doinel for not contacting her, saying he did not use to be &quot;afraid of the telephone&quot;. This is a reference to the plot of the 1962 &quot;Antoine and Colette&quot;.

<doc id="304393" wikidata="Q5466622" url="?curid=304393" title="Fop">
<text>Fop was a pejorative term for a man excessively concerned with his appearance and clothes in 17th-century England. Some of the many similar alternative terms are: &quot;coxcomb&quot;, &quot;fribble&quot;, &quot;popinjay&quot; (meaning &#x27;parrot&#x27;), &quot;dandy&quot;, &quot;fashion-monger&quot;, and &quot;ninny&quot;. &quot;Macaroni&quot; was another term of the 18th century more specifically concerned with fashion.

The pejorative term today carries the connotation of a person, usually male, who is overly concerned with trivial matters (especially matters of fashion) and who affects elite social standing. The term also appears in reference to deliberately camp styles based on eighteenth-century looks.

== Origins ==

The word &quot;fop&quot; is first recorded in 1440 and for several centuries just meant a fool of any kind; the Oxford English Dictionary notes first use with the meaning of &quot;one who is foolishly attentive to and vain of his appearance, dress, or manners; a dandy, an exquisite&quot; in 1672. An early example of the usage is in the Restoration drama &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Fortune&quot;, in which a woman dismisses a potential suitor by saying &quot;Go, you are a fop.&quot;

=== In literature and culture ===
The fop was a stock character in English literature and especially comic drama, as well as satirical prints. He is a &quot;man of fashion&quot; who overdresses, aspires to wit, and generally puts on airs, which may include aspiring to a higher social station than others think he has. He may be somewhat effeminate, although this rarely affects his pursuit of an heiress. He may also overdo being fashionably French by wearing French clothes and using French vocabulary. An example of the so-called Frenchified fop is Sir Novelty Fashion in Colley Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; (1696). Fop characters appear in many Restoration comedies, including sir Fopling Flutter in George Etherege&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Mode, or Sir Fopling Flutter&quot; (1676), Aphra Behn&#x27;s diatribe against politic marriages, &quot;The Town Fop&quot; (1676, published 1677), and Lord Foppington in &quot;The Relapse&quot; (1696) by John Vanbrugh. Vanbrugh planned &quot;The Relapse&quot; around particular actors at the Drury Lane Theatre, including Colley Cibber, who played Lord Foppington. A fop is also referred to as a &quot;&quot;, as in the Restoration comedies &quot;The Beaux&#x27; Stratagem&quot; (1707) by George Farquhar, &quot;The Beau Defeated&quot; (1700) by Mary Pix, or the real-life Beau Nash, master of ceremonies at Bath, or Regency celebrity Beau Brummell. The sexual recklessness of &quot;beau&quot; may imply homosexuality.

Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; contains the word, in the general sense of a fool, and before him Thomas Nashe, in &quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Will and Testament&quot; (1592, printed 1600): &quot;the Idiot, our Playmaker. He, like a Fop &amp; an Ass must be making himself a public laughing-stock.&quot; Osric, in &quot;Hamlet&quot; has a great deal of the fop&#x27;s affected manner, and much of the plot of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; revolves around tricking the puritan Malvolio into dressing as a fop. &quot;Fop&quot; was widely used as a derogatory epithet for a broad range of people by the early years of the 18th century; many of these might not have been considered showy lightweights at the time, and it is possible that its meaning had been blunted by this time.

=== Media of the twentieth century ===

Pulp fiction in the first decade of the twentieth century introduced the secretive action hero who poses as a fop to conceal his identity. In 1903 &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, protagonist of the novels by Emma Orczy, set the prototype. Sir Percy poses as an overdressed and empty-headed socialite who is the last person anyone would imagine rescuing people from the feared guillotine of the French Revolution. A similar image is cultivated by Don Diego de la Vega, who rights wrongs as Zorro (1919) in stories by Johnston McCulley. The trend continued with the pulp fiction and radio heroes of the 1920s and 1930s and expanded with the arrival of comic books. The original characterisation of Bruce Wayne in the &quot;Batman&quot; series carried the trend forward.

In Thomas Mann&#x27;s 1912 novella &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (as well as the opera by Benjamin Britten and the film by Luchino Visconti) a fop is derided by the main character, Gustave von Aschenbach; ironically so, as Aschenbach ultimately dresses in this manner himself. Some of the &quot;bright young things&quot; of the 1920s were decidedly &quot;foppish&quot; in manner and appearance, while, towards the late 1960s, male fashion became notably foppish in style, evocative loosely of the Georgian and Victorian eras. Pop stars often dressed in what might be termed foppish clothing, with the Kinks&#x27; song &quot;Dedicated Follower of Fashion&quot; (1966) capturing well the spirit of the time. While many characters from popular culture had a tendency to foppish appearance, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot;, the third incarnation of Doctor Who and &quot;Jason King&quot;, they tended not to exhibit mannerisms associated with fops. In Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot;, in the French Revolution sequence, one of the king&#x27;s court is referred to as &quot;Popinjay&quot;. In popular series Blackadder the Third, Hugh Laurie portrayed George, Prince Regent as a distinctly childish fop in contrast to his shrewd and sarcastic butler E. Blackadder (played by Rowan Atkinson).

The British Fops, or Lucien Callow (Mark McKinney) and Fagan (David Koechner), appeared in several episodes during the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; 1995–1996 seasons. The characters first appeared on Weekend Update as the presidents of the Norm Macdonald fan-club, but later appeared in several other sketches, namely monologues. The Fops would appear in late Restoration period clothing and used a silly take on the period&#x27;s language, mannerisms, culture, and sexual attitudes.

=== Media of the twenty-first century ===

Early examples of the fop in media of the twenty-first century include the hair-obsessed Ulysses Everett McGill (played by George Clooney) in the Coen brothers film &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot; (2000) and the character of Jack Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp) in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series. Depp&#x27;s style has been termed &quot;grunge fop&quot;. The actor&#x27;s mannerisms caused concerns among executives at the Walt Disney Company but prevailed, thereby creating a new generation of fans of the fop.

In Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot;, character Graham Lister regularly refers to Reeves as &quot;the Fop&quot;. In Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2012 slavery epic &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, Jamie Foxx&#x27;s title character, when allowed to choose his own clothing for the first time in his life, chose a decidedly foppish outfit which immediately earned him the nickname &quot;Fancypants&quot;.

In the 2007 video game &quot;Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney&quot;, Detective Ema Skye constantly refers to the prosecutor Klavier Gavin as a &quot;glimmerous fop&quot; due to the bling that he would typically wear and his obsession with his appearance. The term fop is also used occasionally to refer to other characters, particularly being picked up by Apollo Justice due to the detective&#x27;s habit of saying it.

Other examples include Patrick Bateman, the protagonist of the novel &quot;American Psycho&quot;, and the clothes-obsessed Prince Kai in the book &quot;Firebood&quot; by Elly Blake (2017).

=== Fop rock ===

A more recent and minor trend is &quot;fop rock&quot;, a form of camp in which the performers don 18th-century wigs, lace cravats, and similar costume elements to perform. The style appears to owe something to glam rock, visual kei, and the New Romantic movement. The look was pioneered in the 1960s by Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders. Adam Ant of Adam and the Ants picked up the trend, occasionally performing in elaborate highwayman outfits. Other notable examples would be Falco&#x27;s performance as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the song &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot; (a No. 1 hit in the US, the UK and Canada in 1986), Japanese rock group Malice Mizer, and Boston-based band The Upper Crust. Mid-2000s glam rock revivalists White Hot Odyssey also affected 18th century-style wigs and clothing for their live performances. Prince was known for his foppish clothing in the mid-1980s, with ruffled shirts, tight pants and high-heeled boots.

<text>Gasparo, count Gozzi (4 December 1713 – 26 December 1786) was a Venetian critic and dramatist.
==Life and works==
Gasparo Gozzi was the first of eleven children born to the Venetian Count Jacopo Antonio and Angela Tiepolo, who was also of noble family. His younger brother was Carlo Gozzi. After early studies at home with tutors, he entered the College of Murano, where he acquired a solid liberal arts education and then followed courses in mathematics and law, although his interests were already firmly turned to literature.

In 1739, he married the poet Luisa Bergalli, by whom he was eventually to have five children. In 1747 they undertook the management of the theatre of Sant&#x27;Angelo in Venice, with Gozzi supplying the performers with dramas chiefly translated from the French. The idea had been to remedy their precarious financial situation but the theatre lost money and they had to give it up the following year, although he continued his work as a dramatist.

Gozzi went on to build a reputation for works of moral seriousness in both prose and verse, in particular the 14 prose &quot;Dialoghi dell’isola di Circe&quot; (Dialogues from Circe&#x27;s Island) that were published over the four-year period (1760–64). These drew their inspiration from Giovan Battista Gelli&#x27;s &quot;La Circe&quot; dialogues of two centuries earlier. Ulysses has been given leave by Circe to talk to the men on her island that have changed into beasts. These include figures from fable (The fox and the crow, XIII) and from myth and give a picture of society at variance. Far from needing the intervention of Circe, the victims find their natural condition as soon as they set foot on the island. The sole exception is the bear, a satirist who had dared to criticize Circe and had been changed as a punishment (IX). It is this noble critic of the human condition (representing Gozzi himself) who is the only one that wishes to regain his human form.

In 1760 Gozzi had launched the &quot;Gazzetta Veneta&quot; as a Venetian equivalent of the English Spectator, followed by &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Veneto&quot;. Although neither were particularly successful, he had made himself known as one of the ablest critics and purest and most elegant stylists in Italy. From 1762 he was compensated for the disappointment of his journalistic failure by receiving his first public offices of some importance, first in the University of Padua and then for the Republic. In this role he wrote, among other things, three reports on the state of the art of printing in Venice. The first outlined Venetian publishing history from its origins to the eighteenth century, researching the causes of this decline and proposing remedies, while the others envisaged projects for its successful future development. For a considerable period he was censor of the press in Venice, and in 1774 he was appointed to reorganize the university system at Padua, where he remained till his death. His tomb is at the San Michele cemetery on the Isola di San Michele, along with his brother Carlo Gozzi&#x27;s grave. 

==Works==
His principal writings are:
*&quot;Lettere famigliari&quot; (1755), a collection of short racy pieces in prose and verse, on subjects of general interest
*&quot;Sermoni&quot;, poems in blank verse after the manner of Horace (the first 12 published in 1763, six more added posthumously)
*&quot;Giudizio degli antichi poeti sopra la moderna censura di Dante&quot; (1755), a defence of the great poet against the attacks of Bettinelli.
He also translated various works from the French and English, including Jean-François Marmontel&#x27;s &quot;Tales&quot; and Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Criticism&quot;. His collected works were published at Venice, 1794–1798, in 12 volumes, and several editions have appeared since.

<doc id="304403" wikidata="Q380244" url="?curid=304403" title="Siemens and Halske T52">
<text>The Siemens &amp; Halske T52, also known as the Geheimschreiber (&quot;secret teleprinter&quot;), or &quot;Schlüsselfernschreibmaschine&quot; (SFM), was a World War II German cipher machine and teleprinter produced by the electrical engineering firm Siemens &amp; Halske. The instrument and its traffic were codenamed &quot;Sturgeon&quot; by British cryptanalysts.

While the Enigma machine was generally used by field units, the T52 was an online machine used by Luftwaffe and German Navy units, which could support the heavy machine, teletypewriter and attendant fixed circuits. It fulfilled a similar role to the Lorenz cipher machines in the German Army.

The British cryptanalysts of Bletchley Park codenamed the German teleprinter ciphers Fish, with individual cipher-systems being given further codenames: just as the T52 was called &quot;Sturgeon&quot;, the Lorenz machine was codenamed &quot;Tunny&quot;.

==Operation==
The teleprinters of the day emitted each character as five parallel bits on five lines, typically encoded in the Baudot code or something similar. The T52 had ten pinwheels, which were stepped in a complex nonlinear way, based in later models on their positions from various relays in the past, but in such a way that they could never stall. Each of the five plaintext bits was then XORed with the XOR sum of 3 taps from the pinwheels, and then cyclically adjacent pairs of plaintext bits were swapped or not, according to XOR sums of three (different) output bits. The numbers of pins on all the wheels were coprime, and the triplets of bits that controlled each XOR or swap were selectable through a plugboard.

This produced a much more complex cipher than the Lorenz machine, and also means that the T52 is not just a pseudorandom number generator-and-XOR cipher. For example, if a cipher clerk erred and sent two different messages using exactly the same settings—a &quot;depth of two&quot; in Bletchley jargon—this could be detected statistically but was not immediately and trivially solvable as it would be with the Lorenz.

==Models==

Siemens produced several and mostly incompatible versions of the T52: the T52a and T52b, which differed only in their electrical noise suppression, and the T52c, T52d and T52e. While the T52a/b and T52c were cryptologically weak, the last two were more advanced devices; the movement of the wheels was intermittent, the decision on whether or not to advance them being controlled by logic circuits which took input data from the wheels themselves.

In addition, a number of conceptual flaws, including very subtle ones, had been eliminated. One such flaw was the ability to reset the keystream to a fixed point, which led to key reuse by undisciplined machine operators.

==Cryptanalysis==
Following the occupation of Denmark and Norway, the Germans started to use a teleprinter circuit which ran through Sweden. The Swedes immediately tapped the line, in May 1940, and the mathematician and cryptographer Arne Beurling cracked the two earliest models in two weeks, using just pen and paper (a feat later replicated by Bill Tutte at Bletchley Park with the Lorenz teleprinter device used by the German High Command). The telephone company Ericsson manufactured a number of T52 analogue machines that could decode the messages once the key settings had been found by hand. The Swedes then read traffic in the system for three years, not only between Berlin and Oslo, but also between Germany and the German forces in Finland, and of course the German embassy in Stockholm. In total, the Swedes intercepted 500,000 German messages and decrypted 350,000. However, poor security meant the Germans eventually became aware of this. An improvement in T52 security in 1942 was defeated by the Swedes. However, a second upgrade in mid-1943 was not, and the flow of decrypted messages came to an end.

The British first detected T52 traffic in the summer and autumn of 1942 on a link between Sicily and Libya, codenamed &quot;Sturgeon&quot;, and another from the Aegean to Sicily, codenamed &quot;Mackerel&quot;. Operators of both links were in the habit of enciphering several messages with the same machine settings, producing large numbers of depths. These depths were analysed by Michael Crum.

The British at Bletchley Park later also broke into Sturgeon, although they did not break it as regularly as they broke Enigma or Tunny. This was partly because the T52 was by far the most complex cipher of the three, but also because the Luftwaffe very often retransmitted Sturgeon messages using easier-to-attack (or already broken) ciphers, making it unnecessary to attack Sturgeon.

<text>Nacho is the common short form of the Spanish name Ignacio. The feminine form is Nacha, for the given name Ignacia.

==Origin==
Although there is no official record for it, it seems to be connected with the visit of Ignacio de Loyola to Rome in 1538 to get the Pope&#x27;s approval for his foundation of the Company of Jesus. During his stay in Italy, the Italian pronunciation of his Spanish name, Ignacio, led to the form Nacho and remained as a familiar way to address people named Ignacio. Since then, Jesuits are commonly called &quot;nachos&quot;.

<text>Dawn Marie Psaltis (born November 3, 1970) is an American nurse and retired professional wrestler, professional wrestling valet, and actress. She is perhaps best known for her appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and the SmackDown! brand of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under her wrestling ring name Dawn Marie.

Before she entered the wrestling industry, Psaltis made her living in real estate. After deciding to pursue a career in modeling or acting, Psaltis began managing wrestlers on the independent circuit after meeting a wrestling promoter. She signed a deal with ECW after what was supposed to be a three-week stint. She managed The Impact Players and Simon and Swinger until ECW&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2001.

Psaltis then joined WWE, where her most notable feud involved her marrying Al Wilson, the real-life father of her rival Torrie Wilson. She was released from her WWE contract in 2005 after revealing that she was pregnant, which resulted in her filing a lawsuit against her employers. Currently, Psaltis works as a nurse.

==Early life==
Psaltis was raised by her father, a zoologist, and together, they spent their time camping and hunting. In her youth, she was a fan of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), admiring wrestlers such as Bob Backlund, Jimmy Snuka, and Roddy Piper. Psaltis graduated from the New York University Stern School of Business at the age of 22. She then went on to work for a real estate consultancy firm in Manhattan, New York, reaching the position of Director of International Real Estate.

After meeting an ex-boyfriend who had aspired to play football professionally and finding out that he had been signed by the Chicago Bears, Psaltis decided that she wanted to pursue a career in entertainment. She resigned from the firm and moved into the entertainment industry with the goal of becoming either a model or a professional actress.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1995–1998) ===
While signing modeling posters for Jonathan Gold, a talent agent and professional wrestling promoter, Psaltis jokingly told Gold that she would be interested in pursuing a career in wrestling. Gold took her comment at face value and later contacted Psaltis, informing her that she was scheduled to appear at a wrestling show in New Jersey. With some trepidation, she went to the show and managed Tony Atlas in his match against Jimmy Snuka. Psaltis made her professional wrestling debut in January 1995. She met her future fiancé Simon Diamond during her time in the independent wrestling promotions. She also met Buddy Landell and Devon Storm, both of whom helped train her. Psaltis spent four years working on the northeastern independent circuit, appearing with promotions such as Maryland Championship Wrestling and the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1998–2001) ===
In 1998, Psaltis was informed that Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) employee Buh Buh Ray Dudley was interested in bringing her into ECW. At the behest of Dudley, Psaltis traveled to the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where ECW promoter Paul Heyman told her that he would book her for several appearances in an angle with Lance Storm. She debuted in ECW on August 28, 1998, as the manager of Storm, feuding with Chris Candido and his manager, Tammy Lynn Sytch. Although she was only supposed to have a three-week role in the company, Heyman was impressed by the chemistry between Psaltis and Storm and offered her a contract, which she accepted. Psaltis created her character to be in love with Storm and clumsy rather than glamorous.

Storm and Psaltis feuded with Candido and Sytch for several months, during which time Psaltis was renamed Tammy Lynn Bytch to spite Candido and his manager. After the respective feuds ended, she used the ring name Dawn Marie Bytch, which was eventually shortened to simply Dawn Marie. After Storm formed a tag team with Justin Credible known as the Impact Players in the summer of 1999, she managed both men, helping them win the ECW Tag Team Championship on two occasions. Psaltis continued to manage Storm until he left ECW for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in May 2000. Psaltis was also offered a contract by WCW, but declined to leave ECW in order to remain with her fiancé, ECW wrestler Simon Diamond. She also had two years left on her ECW contract.

Storm then departed ECW, and Psaltis became a color commentator on ECW pay-per-views and the television series &quot;ECW on TNN&quot;. On December 3, 2000, at the Massacre on 34th Street pay-per-view, as part of a new angle, she announced that she would become the manager of the winner of the opening match pitting Simon Diamond and Swinger against Christian York and Joey Matthews. Although York and Matthews won the bout, Psaltis opted to join forces with Diamond and Swinger, whom she managed until ECW declared bankruptcy in April 2001.

=== Independent circuit (2001–2002) ===
Following the bankruptcy of ECW, Psaltis returned to the independent circuit, managing Diamond. The duo made several appearances alongside Swinger with the short lived X Wrestling Federation in November 2001. During her time on the independent circuit, she trained as a wrestler under Simon Diamond and Mikey Whipwreck. Also in 2001, Psaltis worked as a stock trader, and in 2002, she co-hosted a syndicated wrestling radio show known as the &quot;Piledriver Rock and Wrestling Radio Show&quot;.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2002–2005) ===

In April 2002, Psaltis began negotiating with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), eventually agreeing to a deal. She made her World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) television debut on the May 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as Vince McMahon&#x27;s legal assistant. She debuted with the name &quot;Dawn Marie Rinaldi&quot; although it was quickly shortened to the original &quot;Dawn Marie&quot;. In her initial storyline, she briefly feuded with Stacy Keibler over McMahon&#x27;s affections until McMahon turned over the General Manager position to his daughter, Stephanie McMahon, which was followed shortly by Keibler&#x27;s departure for the Raw brand.

Psaltis would begin a controversial feud with Torrie Wilson in 2002. On the October 17 episode of &quot;Smackdown!&quot;, Marie picked up her first victory when she teamed up with Matt Hardy to defeat Rikishi and Torrie Wilson. In response, Wilson defeated Psaltis at No Mercy in October. In the course of the angle, Psaltis developed a relationship with Wilson&#x27;s real-life father Al Wilson. On the edition of November 7 of &quot;Smackdown!&quot;, Psaltis became engaged to Al. In December, Psaltis would attempt to bribe Wilson by inviting her to a hotel one night; if she arrived, she would break off the engagement. Footage of the event would later be shown at the Armageddon pay-per-view. Despite this, as part of the angle, the couple remained engaged, and the two got married on the January 2, 2003 episode of &quot;Smackdown!&quot;. Al then, in storyline, died from a heart attack after having rigorous sex numerous times in succession on their honeymoon. Wilson defeated Psaltis to seemingly end their feud at the Royal Rumble in 2003 in what was billed as a &quot;Stepmother vs. Stepdaughter match&quot;. On Smackdown on March 13, 2003, Dawn Marie flashed the crowd, unbuttoning her outfit and opening it completely. Numerous YouTube videos were made of this episode. In May 2004, Psaltis renewed her feud with Wilson. As part of the feud, the two had a match with Wilson&#x27;s career on the line when the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; General Manager at the time, Kurt Angle, made the stipulation for the match at Judgment Day, which Wilson won.

After being on hiatus from &quot;SmackDown!&quot; programming, Psaltis returned in September 2004 and began a new storyline with Miss Jackie, involving whether she and Jackie&#x27;s fiancée, Charlie Haas, had an affair. This angle led up to a match between the two at Armageddon, with Haas as the guest referee. Psaltis won the match, but afterward, Haas confirmed their affair and broke off both relationships.

At the No Way Out pay-per-view, on February 20, 2005, Dawn Marie entered a feud with Michelle McCool after McCool attacked Marie during the Divas Contest where Marie and Torrie Wilson co-hosted the contest. On the March 3 episode of &quot;Smackdown!&quot;, Marie teamed up with Rene Dupree in losing effort to Big Show and McCool in a mixed tag team match. On the March 24 episode of &quot;Smackdown!&quot;, Dawn Marie pinned McCool by using the ropes for leverage. On the April 14 episode of &quot;Smackdown!&quot;, Dawn Marie was defeated by Torrie in a Divas Match, this would turn out to be Marie&#x27;s last match. Her last in-ring appearance with the company was at ECW One Night Stand, managing Lance Storm for his match against Chris Jericho. Her final appearance on WWE programming was during the June 19, 2005 episode of &quot;WWE Byte This!&quot;. On July 6, 2005, she was released from her WWE contract while on maternity leave.

=== Independent circuit (2005–2012)===

After leaving WWE, on November 5, 2005, a visibly pregnant Psaltis appeared at the ECW reunion event Hardcore Homecoming: November Reign, which was unaffiliated with World Wrestling Entertainment, holding the key for the main event steel cage match between Jerry Lynn and Justin Credible. The match was won by Justin Credible after Psaltis, Jason Knight, and Lance Storm interfered on his behalf. In June 2006, she managed Johnny Candido in a match for the National Wrestling Superstars promotion.

On March 8, 2008, Marie made her debut for Women Superstars Uncensored as a special guest referee for match between Alexa Thatcher and Cindy Rogers versus Nikki Roxx and Alere Little Feather. Marie made her in-ring debut on the March 22, 2008 episode of &quot;Women Superstars Uncensored&quot;, competing in the WSU/NWS J-Cup Tournament and being managed by the villainous Tammy Lynn Sytch, but losing to Becky Bayless in the first round. On the June 21 episode of &quot;Women Superstars Uncensored&quot;, Marie was defeated by Becky Bayless following the match it was then turned in a tag team match where she teamed up with Portia Perez in a winning effort defeating Bayless and Angelina Love.
On the August 23, 2008 episode of &quot;Women Superstars Uncensored&quot;, Marie&#x27;s final match was where she competed in a no-contest with Trixie Lynn, Marie was scheduled to face Becky Bayless but was changed due to Bayless being signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.

In July 2009, Psaltis signed with Dragon Gate USA as the &quot;Live Event Hostess&quot;, a role similar to that of the ring announcer. Marie made appearance for UWE at their pay-per-view Meltdown&#x27;, on July 21, 2012, managing Kevin Murphy and Richie Nightmare against &quot;The Thrill Seeker&quot; Sage Strong and The Mercenary whom was managed by Tommy Dreamer.

On the March 6, 2010 episode of &quot;Women Superstars Uncensored&quot;, Marie was inducted into the &quot;Women Superstars Uncensored&quot; Hall of Fame by Alicia.

Marie took part in the World Wrestling Fan Xperience showcase in 2012.

===Return to WWE (2024)===
At NXT Halloween Havoc on October 27, 2024, NXT general manager Ava announced that Marie would make her return to WWE as a special guest referee for a hardcore match between Jaida Parker and Lola Vice at &quot;NXT&quot; 2300 following which she made an appearance on the November 6 episode of 
&quot;NXT&quot;. This was her first appearance in WWE since her departure in 2005 and her first appearance on the NXT brand.

==Other media==
Psaltis starred in &quot;The Vampire Carmilla&quot;, a 1999 independent film. In 2008, she appeared in the second installment of Paul Heyman&#x27;s &quot;The Heyman Hustle&quot; video blog, which featured her and Heyman on the streets of New York City during the winter season, with Psaltis wearing only a bikini under a fur coat. Psaltis appears as a playable character in the games &quot;ECW Hardcore Revolution&quot;, &quot;ECW Anarchy Rulz&quot; and &quot;WWE WrestleMania XIX&quot;.

==Personal life==
While wrestling in ECW, Psaltis took one college class a semester because of her love of learning and reading. She also took acting classes with the intention of becoming an actress after her career in professional wrestling was over. After her wrestling career, Psaltis became a nurse.

Psaltis began dating Simon Diamond in October 1998. Before dating, the two had been good friends for almost two years. They had planned to be married by the end of 2000 or into 2001. They did not wed, but stayed engaged for several years afterwards. After seven years together, their relationship had come to an end.

Later, Psaltis met Matthew DaMatta, whom she married in 2005 in Las Vegas. In 2005, Psaltis gave birth to her first child. In January 2006, she filed a complaint against WWE with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that her contract had been wrongfully terminated as a result of her pregnancy and that she had suffered mental duress as a result of the release. The case was reportedly settled in late 2007. Psaltis gave birth to her second child in 2009.

<text>The Chiranjivi (; ) are a group of immortals who are believed to remain alive on Earth until the end of the current age known as the Kali Yuga, according to Hindu literature.

==Etymology and scriptural context==
The term is a combination of &quot;chiram&quot;, or &#x27;permanent&#x27;, and &quot;jīvi&quot;, or &#x27;lived&#x27;. It is similar to &quot;amaratva&quot;, which refers to true immortality. At the end of the last manvantara (age of Manu), an asura named Hayagriva attempted to become immortal by swallowing the sacred pages of the &quot;Vedas&quot;, as they escaped from the mouth of Brahma. The scripture was retrieved by the first avatar of Vishnu (Matsya). Other incarnations of Vishnu (Narasimha and Rama) also later fought and killed Hiranyakashipu and Ravana, both of whom tried to become immortal through obeisance to Brahma and Shiva, respectively. In one sense, immortal can mean &quot;to live eternally until the destruction of universes&quot;, i.e., all physical bodies are foretold to become immaterial at the end of time, along with the Brahma himself, with the destruction of the universe.

== List ==

The extant &quot;Puranas&quot;, the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; generally describe seven immortal personalities in the Hindu pantheon. Some scholars opine the count to be eight. Each Chiranjivi represents a different attribute of man, which as long as they live, will exist amongst humanity. 
Other individuals who are sometimes additionally included to the list are the following:
==&quot;Chiranjivi Shloka&quot;==
The &quot;Chiranjivi Shloka&quot; is a hymn that names the Chiranjivi and states the effects of their meditation:

<text>Mohammad Abdus Salam (; ; 29 January 192621 November 1996) was a Pakistani theoretical physicist. He shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg for his contribution to the electroweak unification theory. He was the first Pakistani and the first scientist from an Islamic country to receive a Nobel Prize and the second from an Islamic country to receive any Nobel Prize, after Anwar Sadat of Egypt.

Salam was scientific advisor to the Ministry of Science and Technology in Pakistan from 1960 to 1974, a position from which he played a major and influential role in the development of the country&#x27;s science infrastructure. Salam contributed to numerous developments in theoretical and particle physics in Pakistan. He was the founding director of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), and responsible for the establishment of the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG). For this, he is viewed as the &quot;scientific father&quot; of this program. In 1974, Abdus Salam departed from his country in protest after the Parliament of Pakistan unanimously passed a parliamentary bill declaring members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, to which Salam belonged, non-Muslim. In 1998, following the country&#x27;s Chagai-I nuclear tests, the Government of Pakistan issued a commemorative stamp, as a part of &quot;Scientists of Pakistan&quot;, to honour the services of Salam.

Salam&#x27;s notable achievements include the Pati–Salam model, a Grand Unified Theory he proposed along with Jogesh Pati in 1974, magnetic photon, vector meson, work on supersymmetry and most importantly, electroweak theory, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize. Salam made a major contribution in quantum field theory and in the advancement of Mathematics at Imperial College London. With his student, Riazuddin, Salam made important contributions to the modern theory on neutrinos, neutron stars and black holes, as well as the work on modernising quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. As a teacher and science promoter, Salam is remembered as a founder and scientific father of mathematical and theoretical physics in Pakistan during his term as the chief scientific advisor to the president. Salam heavily contributed to the rise of Pakistani physics within the global physics community. Up until shortly before his death, Salam continued to contribute to physics, and to advocate for the development of science in third-world countries.

==Biography==

===Youth and education===
Abdus Salam was born on 29 January 1926 in the Punjab Province of British India (now in Pakistan) into a Punjabi family professing Ahmadi Islam. He belonged to the Rajput community, his son Ahmad Salam later recounting that he would tell him stories of Rajput cultural history &quot;of which he was very proud&quot;; as per Jagjit Singh in his biography of Salam, his family traced its genealogy back to a Rajput prince named Buddahn who converted to Islam at the hands of a Sufi preacher and later founded the city of Jhang around the year 1160. Salam was the son of Chaudhary Muhammad Hussain, a school teacher of Jhang and Hajirah who belonged to Faizullah Chak near Batala.

The name Choudhary Muhammad Hussain gave his son was Abd al-Salam which means &quot;Servant of God&quot;. Abd means servant and Salam is one of the 99 names of God in the Qur&#x27;an. In English, his name is usually transliterated as Abdus Salam, which should be understood as a single given name. His father followed the custom of not giving a surname. Later in his life he added Mohammad to his name.
Salam established an early reputation throughout Punjab for outstanding brilliance and academic achievement. At age 14, Salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the entrance examination at the Punjab University. He won a full scholarship to the Government College University of Lahore. Salam was a versatile scholar, interested in Urdu and English literature in which he excelled. After a month in Lahore, he went to Bombay to study. In 1947, he came back to Lahore. But he soon picked up Mathematics as his concentration. Salam&#x27;s mentor and tutors wanted him to become an English teacher, but Salam decided to stick with Mathematics. As a fourth-year student there, he published his work on Srinivasa Ramanujan&#x27;s problems in mathematics, and took his B.A. in Mathematics in 1944. His father wanted him to join the Indian Civil Service (ICS). In those days, the ICS was the highest aspiration for young university graduates and civil servants occupied a respected place in civil society. Respecting his father&#x27;s wish, Salam tried for the Indian Railways but did not qualify for the service as he failed the medical optical tests. The results further concluded that Salam failed a mechanical test required by railway engineers to gain a commission in the Railways, and that he was too young to compete for the job. Therefore, the Railways rejected Salam&#x27;s job application. While in Lahore, Salam went on to attend the graduate school of Government College University. He received his MA in Mathematics from the Government College University in 1946. That same year, he was awarded a scholarship to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he completed a BA degree with Double First-Class Honours in Mathematics and Physics in 1949. In 1950, he received the Smith&#x27;s Prize from Cambridge University for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to Physics. After finishing his degrees, Fred Hoyle advised Salam to spend another year in the Cavendish Laboratory to do research in experimental physics, but Salam had no patience for carrying out long experiments in the laboratory. Salam returned to Jhang and renewed his scholarship and returned to the United Kingdom to do his doctorate.

He obtained a PhD degree in theoretical physics from the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge. His doctoral thesis titled &quot;Developments in quantum theory of fields&quot; contained comprehensive and fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics. By the time it was published in 1951, it had already gained him an international reputation and the Adams Prize.
During his doctoral studies, his mentors challenged him to solve within one year an intractable problem which had defied such great minds as Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman. Within six months, Salam had found a solution for the renormalization of meson theory. As he proposed the solution at the Cavendish Laboratory, Salam had attracted the attention of Hans Bethe, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Dirac.

===Academic career===

After receiving his doctorate in 1951, Salam returned to Lahore at the Government College University as a Professor of Mathematics where he remained till 1954. In 1952, he was appointed professor and Chair of the Department of Mathematics at the neighbouring University of the Punjab. In the latter capacity, Salam sought to update the university curriculum, introducing a course in Quantum mechanics as a part of the undergraduate curriculum. However, this initiative was soon reverted by the Vice-Chancellor, and Salam decided to teach an evening course in Quantum Mechanics outside the regular curriculum. While Salam enjoyed a mixed popularity in the university, he began to supervise the education of students who were particularly influenced by him. As a result, Riazuddin remained the only student of Salam who had the privilege to study under Salam at the undergraduate and post-graduate level in Lahore, and post-doctoral level in Cambridge University. In 1953, Salam was unable to establish a research institute in Lahore, as he faced strong opposition from his peers. In 1954, Salam took fellowship and became one of the earliest fellows of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences. As a result of 1953 Lahore riots, Salam went back to Cambridge and joined St John&#x27;s College, and took a position as a professor of mathematics in 1954. In 1957, he was invited to take a chair at Imperial College, London, and he and Paul Matthews went on to set up the Theoretical Physics Group at Imperial College. As time passed, this department became one of the prestigious research departments that included well known physicists such as Steven Weinberg, Tom Kibble, Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, Riazuddin, and John Ward.

In 1957, Punjab University conferred Salam with an Honorary doctorate for his contribution in Particle physics. The same year with help from his mentor, Salam launched a scholarship programme for his students in Pakistan. Salam retained strong links with Pakistan, and visited his country from time to time. At Cambridge and Imperial College he formed a group of theoretical physicists, the majority of whom were his Pakistani students. At age 33, Salam became one of the youngest persons to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1959. Salam took a fellowship at the Princeton University in 1959, where he met with J. Robert Oppenheimer and to whom he presented his research work on neutrinos. Oppenheimer and Salam discussed the foundation of electrodynamics, problems and their solution. His dedicated personal assistant was Jean Bouckley. In 1980, Salam became a foreign fellow of the Bangladesh Academy of Sciences.

===Scientific career===
Early in his career, Salam made an important and significant contribution in quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory, including its extension into particle and nuclear physics. In his early career in Pakistan, Salam was greatly interested in mathematical series and their relation to physics. Salam had played an influential role in the advancement of nuclear physics, but he maintained and dedicated himself to mathematics and theoretical physics and focused Pakistan to do more research in theoretical physics. However, he regarded nuclear physics (nuclear fission and nuclear power) as a non-pioneering part of physics as it had already &quot;happened&quot;. Even in Pakistan, Salam was the leading driving force in theoretical physics, with many scientists he continued to influence and encourage to keep their work on theoretical physics.

Salam had a prolific research career in theoretical and high-energy physics. Salam had worked on theory of the neutrino – an elusive particle that was first postulated by Wolfgang Pauli in the 1930s. Salam introduced chiral symmetry in the theory of neutrinos. The introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role in subsequent development of the theory of electroweak interactions. Salam later passed his work to Riazuddin, who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos. Salam introduced the massive Higgs bosons to the theory of the Standard Model, where he later predicted the existence of proton decay. In 1963, Salam published his theoretical work on the vector meson. The paper introduced the interaction of vector meson, photon (vector electrodynamics), and the renormalisation of vector mesons&#x27; known mass after the interaction. In 1961, Salam began to work with John Clive Ward on symmetries and electroweak unification. In 1964, Salam and Ward worked on a Gauge theory for the weak and electromagnetic interaction, subsequently obtaining SU(2) × U(1) model. Salam was convinced that all the elementary particle interactions are actually the gauge interactions. In 1968, together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam formulated the mathematical concept of their work. While in Imperial College, Salam, along with Glashow and Jeffrey Goldstone, mathematically proved the Goldstone&#x27;s theorem, that a massless spin-zero object must appear in a theory as a result of spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry. In 1967-8, Salam and Weinberg incorporated the Higgs mechanism into Glashow&#x27;s discovery, giving it a modern form in electroweak theory, and thus theorised half of the Standard Model. In 1968, together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam finally formulated the mathematical concept of their work.

In 1966, Salam carried out pioneering work on a hypothetical particle. Salam showed the possible electromagnetic interaction between the Magnetic monopole and the C-violation, thus he formulated the magnetic photon.

Following the publication of PRL Symmetry Breaking papers in 1964, Steven Weinberg and Salam were the first to apply the Higgs mechanism to electroweak symmetry breaking. Salam provided a mathematical postulation for the interaction between the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry theory.

In 1972, Salam began to work with Indian-American theoretical physicist Jogesh Pati. Pati wrote to Salam several times expressing interest to work under Salam&#x27;s direction, in response to which Salam eventually invited Pati to the ICTP seminar in Pakistan. Salam suggested to Pati that there should be some deep reason why the protons and electrons are so different and yet carry equal but opposite electric charge. Protons are composed of quarks, but the electroweak theory was concerned only with the electrons and neutrinos, with nothing postulated about quarks. If all of nature&#x27;s ingredients could be brought together in one new symmetry, it might reveal a reason for the various features of these particles and the forces they feel. This led to the development of Pati–Salam model in particle physics. In 1973, Salam and Jogesh Pati were the first to notice that since Quarks and Leptons have very similar SU(2) × U(1) representation content, they all may have similar entities. They provided a simple realisation of the quark-lepton symmetry by postulating that lepton number was a fourth quark colour, dubbed &quot;violet&quot;.

Physicists had believed that there were four fundamental forces of nature: the gravitational force, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and the electromagnetic force. Salam had worked on the unification of these forces from 1959 with Glashow and Weinberg. While at Imperial College London, Salam successfully showed that weak nuclear forces are not really different from electromagnetic forces, and two could inter-convert. Salam provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental forces of nature, weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic forces, one into another. Glashow had also formulated the same work, and the theory was combined in 1966. In 1967, Salam proved the electroweak unification theory mathematically, and finally published the papers. For this achievement, Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979. The Nobel Prize Foundation paid tribute to the scientists and issued a statement saying: &quot;For their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current&quot;. Salam took the Nobel Prize medal to the house of his former professor, Anilendra Ganguly, who taught him at the Sanatan Dharma College in Lahore, and placed the medal around his neck, stating &quot;Mr Anilendra Ganguly this medal is a result of your teaching and love of mathematics that you instilled in me&quot;. In the 1970s Salam continued trying to unify forces by including the strong interaction in a grand unified theory.

==Government work==

Abdus Salam returned to Pakistan in 1960 to take charge of a government post given to him by President Ayub Khan. From her independence in 1947 after the Partition of India, Pakistan has never had a coherent science policy, and total expenditure on research and development was only ~1.0% of Pakistan&#x27;s GDP. Even the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission headquarters was located in a small room, and less than 10 scientists were working on fundamental physics concepts. Salam replaced Salimuzzaman Siddiqui as the Science Advisor, and became first Member (technical) of PAEC. Salam expanded the web of physics research and development in Pakistan by sending more than 500 scientists abroad. In 1961 he approached President Khan to set up the country&#x27;s first national space agency, thus on 16 September 1961 the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission was established, with Salam as its first director. Before 1960, very little work on scientific development was done, and Salam called Ishfaq Ahmad, a nuclear physicist, who had left for Switzerland where he joined CERN, back to Pakistan. With the support of Salam, PAEC established PAEC Lahore Center-6, with Ishfaq Ahmad as its first director. In 1967, Salam became a central and administrative figure to lead the research in Theoretical and Particle physics. With the establishment of the Institute of Physics at Quaid-e-Azam University, research in theoretical and particle physics was engaged. Under Salam&#x27;s direction, physicists tackled the greatest outstanding problems in physics and mathematics and their physics research reached a point that prompted worldwide recognition of Pakistani physicists.

From the 1950s, Salam had tried establishing high-powered research institutes in Pakistan, though he was unable to do so. He moved PAEC Headquarters to a bigger building, and established research laboratories all over the country. On the direction of Salam, Ishrat Hussain Usmani set up plutonium and uranium exploration committees throughout the country. In October 1961, Salam travelled to the United States and signed a space co-operation agreement between Pakistan and US. In November 1961, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) started to build a space facility – Flight Test Center (FTC) – at Sonmiani, a coastal town in Balochistan Province. Salam served as its first technical director.

Salam played an influential and significant role in Pakistan&#x27;s development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. In 1964, he was made head of Pakistan&#x27;s IAEA delegation and represented Pakistan for a decade. The same year, Salam joined Munir Ahmad Khan – his lifelong friend and contemporary at Government College University. Khan was the first person in the IAEA that Salam had consulted about the establishment of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), a research physics institution, in Trieste, Italy. With an agreement signed with IAEA, the ICTP was set up with Salam as its first director. At IAEA, Salam had advocated the importance of nuclear power plants in his country. It was due to his effort that in 1965, Canada and Pakistan signed a nuclear energy co-operation deal. Salam obtained permission from President Ayub Khan – against the wishes of his own government functionaries – to set up the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. Also in 1965, led by Salam, the United States and Pakistan signed an agreement in which the US provided Pakistan with a small research reactor (PARR-I). Salam had a long-held dream to establish a research institute in Pakistan, which he had advocated for on many occasions. In 1965 again, Salam and architect Edward Durell Stone signed a contract for the establishment of the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) at Nilore, Islamabad.

===Space programme===

In early 1961, Salam approached President Khan to lay the foundations of Pakistan&#x27;s first executive agency to co-ordinate space research. By executive order on 16 September 1961 the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) was established with Salam founding director. Salam immediately travelled to the United States, where he signed a space co-operation agreement with the US Government. In November 1961, NASA built the Flight Test Center in Balochistan Province. During this time, Salam visited the Pakistan Air Force Academy where he met with Air Commodore (Brigadier-General) Wladyslaw Turowicz – a Polish military scientist and an aerospace engineer. Turowicz was made the first technical director of the space centre, and a programme of rocket testing ensued. In 1964, while in the US Salam visited the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and met with nuclear engineers Salim Mehmud and Tariq Mustafa. Salam signed another agreement with the NASA which launched a programme to provide training to Pakistan&#x27;s scientists and engineers. Both nuclear engineers returned to Pakistan and were inducted into SUPARCO.

===Nuclear weapons programme===

Salam knew the importance of nuclear technology in Pakistan, for civilian and peaceful purposes. But, according to his biographers, Salam played an ambiguous role in Pakistan&#x27;s own atomic bomb project. As late as the 1960s, Salam made an unsuccessful proposal for the establishment of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, but it was deferred on economic grounds by Ayub Khan. According to Rehman, Salam&#x27;s influence in nuclear development was diminished as late as 1974, and he became critical of Bhutto&#x27;s control over science. But Salam personally did not terminate his connection with the scientists working in the theoretical physics division at PAEC. As early as 1972–73, he had been a great advocate for the atomic bomb project, but subsequently took a stance against it after he fell out with Bhutto over the Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan which declared the Ahmaddiya denomination to be non-Islamic.

In 1965, Salam led the establishing of the nuclear research institutePINSTECH. In 1965, the plutonium Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor (PARR-I) went critical under Salams&#x27; leadership. In 1973, Salam proposed the idea of establishing an annual college to promote scientific activities in the country to the Chairman of PAEC, Munir Khan, who accepted and fully supported the idea. This led to the establishment of the International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs (INSC), where each year since 1976 scientists from all over the world come to Pakistan to interact with local scientists. The first annual INSC conference was held on advanced particle and nuclear physics.

In November 1971, Salam met with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in his residence, and following Bhutto&#x27;s advice, went to the United States to avoid the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Salam travelled to the US and returned to Pakistan with scientific literature about the Manhattan Project, and calculations involving atomic bombs. In 1972, the Government of Pakistan learned about the development status of the first atomic bomb completed under the Indian nuclear programme. On 20 January 1972, Salam, as Science Advisor to the President of Pakistan, managed and participated in a secret meeting of nuclear scientists with former Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in Multan, known as the &#x27;Multan Meeting&#x27;. At this meeting Bhutto orchestrated the development of a deterrence programme. At the meeting, only I. H. Usmani protested, believing that the country had neither the facilities or talent to carry out such an ambitious and technologically demanding project, whilst Salam remained quiet. Here, Bhutto entrusted Salam and appointed Munir Khan as Chairman of PAEC, and head of the atomic bomb program, as Salam had supported Khan. A few months after the meeting, Salam, Khan, and Riazuddin, met with Bhutto in his residence where the scientists briefed him about the nuclear weapons program. After the meeting, Salam established the &#x27;Theoretical Physics Group&#x27; (TPG) in PAEC. Salam led groundbreaking work at TPG until 1974.

An office was set up for Salam in the Prime Ministers&#x27; Secretariat by order of Bhutto. Salam immediately started to motivate and invite scientists to begin work with PAEC in the development of fission weapons. In December 1972, two theoretical physicists working at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics were asked by Salam to report to Munir Ahmad Khan, the scientific director of the program. This marked the beginning of the TPG, reporting directly to Salam. The TPG, in PAEC, was assigned to conduct research in fast neutron calculations, hydrodynamics (how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave), problems of neutron diffusion, and the development of theoretical designs of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapon devices. Later, the TPG under Riazuddin began to directly report to Salam, and the work on the theoretical design of the nuclear weapon was completed in 1977. In 1972, Salam formed the Mathematical Physics Group, under Raziuddin Siddiqui, that was charged, with TPG, with carrying out research in the theory of simultaneity during the detonation process, and the mathematics involved in the theory of nuclear fission. Following India&#x27;s surprise nuclear testPokhran-I – in 1974, Munir Ahmad Khan had called a meeting to initiate work on an atomic bomb. Salam was there and Muhammad Hafeez Qureshi was appointed head of the Directorate of Technical Development (DTD) in PAEC.

The DTD was set up to co-ordinate the work of the various specialised groups of scientists and engineers working on different aspects of the atomic bomb. The word &quot;bomb&quot; was never used in this meeting, but the participants fully understood what was being discussed. In March 1974, Salam and Khan also established the Wah Group Scientist that was charged with manufacturing materials, explosive lenses and triggering mechanism development of the weapon. Following the setting up of DTD, Salam, Riazuddin and Munir Ahmad Khan, visited the Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF) where they held talks with senior military engineers led by POF chairman Lieutenant-General Qamar Ali Mirza. It was there that the Corps of Engineers built the Metallurgical Laboratory in Wah Cantonment in 1976. Salam remained associated with the nuclear weapons programme until mid-1974, when he left the country after Ahmadi were declared non-Muslims by the Pakistani Parliament. His own relations with Prime minister Bhutto fell out and turned into open hostility after the Ahmadiyya Community was declared as not-Islamic; he lodged a public and powerful protest against Bhutto regarding this issue and gave great criticism to Bhutto over his control over science. In spite of this, Salam maintained close relations with the theoretical physics division at PAEC who kept him informed about the status of the calculations needed to calculate the performance of the atomic bomb, according to Norman Dombey. After seeing Indian aggression, the Siachen conflict in Northern Pakistan, followed by India&#x27;s Operation Brasstacks in Southern Pakistan, Salam again renewed his ties with senior scientists working in the atomic bomb projects, who had kept him informed about the scientific development of the program. In the 1980s, Salam personally approved many appointments and a large influx of Pakistani scientists to the associateship program at ICTP and CERN, and engaged in research in theoretical physics with his students at the ICTP.

In 2008, Indian scholar Ravi Singh noted in his book &quot;The Military Factor in Pakistan&quot; that, &quot;in 1978, Abdus Salam with PAEC officials, paid a secret visit to China, and was instrumental in initiating industrial nuclear cooperation between the two countries.&quot; Although he had left the country, Salam did not hesitate to advise the PAEC and Theoretical and Mathematical Physics Group on important scientific matters, and kept his close association with TPG and PAEC.

==Advocacy for science==

In 1964, Salam founded the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, in Italy and served as its director until 1993. In 1974, he founded the International Nathiagali Summer College (INSC) to promote science in Pakistan. The INSC is an annual meeting of scientists from all over the world who come to Pakistan and hold discussions on physics and science. Even today, the INSC holds annual meetings, and Salam&#x27;s pupil Riazuddin has been its director since its start.

In 1997, the scientists at ICTP commemorated Salam and renamed ICTP as the &quot;Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics&quot;. Throughout the years, he served on a number of United Nations committees concerning science and technology in developing countries. Salam also founded the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) and was a leading figure in the creation of a number of international centres dedicated to the advancement of science and technology.

During a visit to the Institute of Physics at Quaid-i-Azam University in 1979, Salam explained after receiving an award: &quot;Physicists believed there are four fundamental forces of nature; the gravitational force, the weak and strong nuclear force, and the electromagnetic force&quot;. Salam was a firm believer that &quot;scientific thought is the common heritage of mankind&quot;, and that developing nations needed to help themselves, and invest in their own scientists to boost development and reduce the gap between the Global South and the Global North, thus contributing to a more peaceful world.

In 1981, Salam became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

Although Salam left Pakistan, he did not terminate his connection to home. He continued inviting Pakistan&#x27;s scientists to ICTP, and maintained a research programme for them. Many prominent scientists, including Ghulam Murtaza, Riazuddin, Kamaluddin Ahmed, Faheem Hussain, Raziuddin Siddiqui, Munir Ahmad Khan, Ishfaq Ahmad, and I. H. Usmani, considered him as their mentor and a teacher.

==Personal life==
Abdus Salam was a very private individual, who kept his public and personal lives quite separate. He married twice; first time to a cousin, the second time as well in accordance with Islamic law. At his death, he was survived by three daughters and a son by his first wife, and a son and daughter by his second, Professor Dame Louise Johnson, formerly Professor of molecular biophysics at Oxford University. Two of his daughters are Anisa Bushra Salam Bajwa and Aziza Rahman.

===Religion===
Salam was an Ahmadi, who saw his religion as a fundamental part of his scientific work. He once wrote that &quot;the Holy Quran enjoins us to reflect on the verities of Allah&#x27;s created laws of nature; however, that our generation has been privileged to glimpse a part of His design is a bounty and a grace for which I render thanks with a humble heart.&quot;&quot;

During his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in Physics, Salam quoted verses from the Quran and stated:
In 1974, the Pakistan parliament made the Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan that declared Ahmadis to be . In protest, Salam left Pakistan for London. After his departure, he did not completely cut his ties to Pakistan, and kept a close association with the Theoretical Physics Group as well as academic scientists from the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.

===Death===

Abdus Salam died on 21 November 1996 at the age of 70 in Oxford, England, from progressive supranuclear palsy. His body was returned to Pakistan and kept in Darul Ziafat, where some 13,000 men and women visited to pay their last respects. Approximately 30,000 people attended his funeral prayers.

Salam was buried in Bahishti Maqbara, a cemetery established by the Ahmadiyya Community at Rabwah, Punjab, Pakistan, next to his parents&#x27; graves. The epitaph on his tomb initially read &quot;First Muslim Nobel Laureate&quot;. The Pakistani government removed &quot;Muslim&quot; and left only his name on the headstone. They are the only nation to officially declare that Ahmadis are non-Muslim. The word &quot;Muslim&quot; was initially obscured on the orders of a local magistrate before moving to the national level. Under Ordinance XX of 1984, being an Ahmadi, he was considered a non-Muslim according to the definition provided in the Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan.

===Legacy===

Salam&#x27;s work in Pakistan has been far reaching and regarded as highly influential. He is remembered by his peers and students as the &quot;father of Pakistan&#x27;s school of Theoretical Physics&quot; as well as Pakistan&#x27;s science. Salam was a charismatic and iconic figure, a symbol among them of what they were working or researching toward in their fields. His students, fellow scientists and engineers, remembered him as brilliant teacher, and engaging researcher who would also influence others to do the same. The International Centre for Theoretical Physics established by Salam has continued to train scientists from developing countries. Salam founded the Space Research Commission of and was its first director. In 1998, the Government of Pakistan issued a commemorative stamp to honour Salam as part of its &quot;Scientists of Pakistan&quot; series. His alma mater, Government College Lahore, now a university, has the &quot;Abdus Salam Chair in Physics&quot; and Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences named after him. &quot;The Abdus Salam Chair&quot; was also established in his honour at the Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering in the Lahore University of Management Sciences. He made a significant contribution towards the 2012 success in the search for the Higgs boson.

Salam has been commemorated by noted and prominent Pakistani scientists, who were also his students. Many scientists have recalled their college experiences. Ghulam Murtaza, a professor of plasma physics at the Government College University and student of Salam, wrote:

When Dr. Salam was to deliver a lecture, the hall would be packed and although the subject was Particle Physics, his manner and eloquence was such as if he was talking about literature. When he finished his lectures, listeners would often burst into spontaneous applause and give him a standing ovation. People from all parts of the world would come to Imperial College and seek Dr. Salam&#x27;s help. He would give a patient hearing to everyone including those who were talking nonsense. He treated everyone with respect and compassion and never belittled or offended anyone. Dr. Salam&#x27;s strength was that he could &quot;sift jewels from the sand&quot;.

Ishfaq Ahmad, a lifelong friend of Salam recalls:

Dr Salam was responsible for sending about 500 physicists, mathematicians and scientists from Pakistan, for PhD&#x27;s to the best institutions in UK and USA.

In August 1996 another lifelong friend, Munir Ahmad Khan, met Salam in Oxford. Khan, who headed the nuclear weapons and nuclear energy programmes, said:

My last meeting with Abdus Salam was only three months ago. His disease had taken its toll and he was unable to talk. Yet he understood what was said. I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings as if he wanted to thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him. 

However, Salam&#x27;s legacy is often ignored in the Pakistani education system despite his achievements. According to the documentary &#x27;Salam: The First ****** Nobel Laureate,&#x27; very few young Pakistanis have heard of him, and his name is not mentioned in Pakistani school textbooks. In 2020, a group of students belonging to the State Youth Parliament desecrated an image of Salam that was present at a college in Gujranwala, while chanting slogans against the Ahmadiyya community. This deliberate effort to stifle mention of Salam is attributed to Salam belonging to the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, who have faced state-sponsored discrimination since the 1970s.

==Documentaries on Abdus Salam==
;Salam – the film
LLC started formally researching and developing a film on the science and life of Abdus Salam in 2004, two years after the producers had conceived of the idea. A fundraising teaser was released by Kailoola Productions to coincide with Salam&#x27;s birth anniversary on 29 January 2017. The post-production phase of this documentary film, pending funding, is estimated at US$150,000. The film &quot;Salam: The First ****** Nobel Laureate&quot;, directed by the Indian-American documentary filmmaker Anand Kamalakar, was announced in 2018 and released on Netflix in October 2019.

;Abdus Salam
Pilgrim Films released &quot;The Dream of Symmetry&quot; in September 2011. Their press release describes it as presenting &quot;the extraordinary figure of Abdus Salam, who not only was an outstanding scientist but also a generous humanitarian and a valuable person. His rich and busy life was an endless quest for symmetry, that he pursued in the universe of physical laws and in the world of human beings.&quot;

==Honours==

Salam was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1979, and the American Philosophical Society in 1992. In 1997, scientists at ICTP renamed the institute as the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics in the honour of Salam. Salam&#x27;s services have been recognised in Pakistan, as his students have openly spoken and stressed the importance of Science and Technology in Pakistan. In 1999, per the recommendation of Ishfaq Ahmad, the Government of Pakistan led the establishment of the Abdus Salam Chair in Physics at the Government College University. On 22 November 2009, the Director of the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics gifted the original Nobel Prize Certificate to his alma mater. In 2011, GCU&#x27;s Salam Chair in Physics held a one-day-long conference that was attributed to Abdus Salam. Salam&#x27;s students Ghulam Murtaza, Pervez Hoodbhoy, Riazuddin and Tariq Zaidi discussed the life and works of Salam, and brought to light his achievements in Pakistan and Physics. While covering the media converge on Salam&#x27;s tribute, &quot;The News International&quot;, referred to Salam as the &quot;great Pakistan scientist&quot;.

In 1998, the Edward A. Bouchet-ICTP Institute was renamed as the Edward Bouchet Abdus Salam Institute. In 2003, the Government of Punjab created an institute of excellence for the Mathematical Sciences, the Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences, in Salam&#x27;s Alma mater – Government College University.
 In 2008, in an opinion piece, &quot;Daily Times&quot; called Salam &quot;one of the greatest scientists Pakistan has ever produced&quot;.

In 2015, the Academy of Young Researchers and Scholars, Lahore, renamed its library as the &quot;Abdus Salam Library&quot;. In the town of Vaughan, Ontario, Canada, near the headquarters of the Canadian branch of the Ahmadiyya Community, of which Abdus Salam was a member, the community has named a street after him, &#x27;Abdus Salam Street&#x27;, while at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland there is &#x27;Route Salam&#x27;. Additionally, there are two annual Abdus Salam science fairs, one held in Canada and the other in the US. Each is organised as a National event for young scientists from the Ahmadiyya Community in an effort to motivate youth toward scientific endeavour.

On 6 December 2016, Pakistan&#x27;s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif approved the renaming of Quaid-i-Azam University&#x27;s (QAU) physics centre to the Professor Abdus Salam Center for Physics. It was also announced that the &quot;Professor Abdus Salam Fellowship&quot; will be established, which will include five annual fully funded Pakistani PhD students in the field of Physics in &quot;leading international universities&quot;.

In November 2020, English Heritage erected a blue plaque in Salam&#x27;s honour in Campion Road, Putney, London, at the house that was his London home for almost 40 years.

In June 2023, Imperial College, London announced the renaming of its Imperial College Central Library as the Abdus Salam Library.

===Awards named after Salam===
The Abdus Salam Award (also called the Salam Prize) is an award established to recognise high achievements and contributions in physical and natural sciences. In 1979, Riazuddin, Fayyazuddin and Asghar Qadir met with Salam, and presented the idea of creating an award to appreciate scientists, resident in Pakistan, in their respective fields. Salam donated the money he had won as he felt that he had no right use for the prize money. It was endowed by Asghar Qadir, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin in 1980, and it was first awarded in 1981. The winners are selected by a committee (consisted of Aghar Qadir, Fayyazuddin, Riazuddin, and others) of the Center for Advanced Mathematics and Physics (CAMP), which administers the award. The Abdus Salam Medal is presented by the Third World Academy of Sciences in Trieste, Italy. First given in 1995, the award is presented to the people who have served the cause of science in the Developing World. The Abdus Salam Shield of Honor in Mathematics was initiated by the National Mathematical Society of Pakistan to promote and recognize quality research in Mathematics in 2015. It was awarded for the first time in 2016.

<text>The Birds is a 1963 American natural horror-thriller film produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, released by Universal Pictures and starring Jessica Tandy, Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette, and introducing Tippi Hedren in her film debut. Loosely based on the 1952 short story of the same name by Daphne du Maurier, it focuses on a series of sudden and unexplained violent bird attacks on the people of Bodega Bay, California, over the course of a few days. The screenplay is by Evan Hunter, who was told by Hitchcock to develop new characters and a more elaborate plot while keeping du Maurier&#x27;s title and concept of unexplained bird attacks.

While it initially received mixed reviews when originally released, its reputation improved over time and it has since been considered to be one of the greatest horror films of all time. At the 36th Academy Awards, Ub Iwerks was nominated for Best Special Effects for his work on the film. The award, however, went to the only other nominee, Emil Kosa Jr., for &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. Hedren won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress for her role in the film.

In 2016, &quot;The Birds&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress, and selected for preservation in its National Film Registry.

== Plot ==
At a San Francisco pet store, socialite Melanie Daniels meets lawyer Mitch Brenner, who wants to buy lovebirds for his sister Cathy&#x27;s 11th birthday. Recognizing Melanie from her court appearance regarding a practical joke gone awry, Mitch pretends to mistake her for a shop employee. Mitch tests Melanie&#x27;s knowledge of birds, which she fails. He discloses his prior knowledge of her and leaves without buying anything. Intrigued, Melanie buys the lovebirds and drives to Bodega Bay after learning Mitch has gone to his family&#x27;s farm for the weekend. Melanie is directed to a teacher at Bodega, Annie Hayworth, to learn Cathy&#x27;s name. Annie is Mitch’s ex-lover, but their relationship ended due to his overbearing mother, Lydia, who dislikes any woman in Mitch&#x27;s life.

Melanie rents a boat and crosses the bay to discreetly leave the lovebirds at the Brenner farm. Mitch spots Melanie as she leaves and drives to meet her at the dock. As Melanie approaches the wharf, a gull attacks her. Mitch tends to her head wound inside a diner. Lydia arrives and meets Melanie, whom Mitch invites to dinner. At the farm, Lydia&#x27;s hens are refusing to eat. Lydia dislikes Melanie due to her exaggerated reputation, as reported in gossip columns. Mitch invites Melanie, who is staying with Annie, to Cathy&#x27;s birthday party being held the next day. Later, there is a thud at Annie&#x27;s front door. A dead gull is found at the threshold.

At Cathy&#x27;s party, Melanie tells Mitch about her troubled past and her mother running off with another man when she was Cathy&#x27;s age. During a game, the children are attacked by gulls. Later that evening, as Melanie dines with the Brenners, sparrows swarm the house through the chimney. Mitch insists she delay driving back to San Francisco and stay the night. The next morning, Lydia visits her neighbor to discuss why their chickens will not eat. She discovers broken windows in his bedroom and his eyeless corpse, pecked by birds, and flees in horror. While recovering at home, Lydia fears for Cathy&#x27;s safety, and Melanie offers to pick her up at school. As Melanie waits outside the schoolhouse, a flock of crows engulfs the jungle gym behind her. Anticipating an attack, she warns Annie. Rather than leaving the students in the building with its large windows, they evacuate them, and the crows attack. Mitch finds Melanie at the diner. When gulls attack a gas station attendant, Mitch and other men assist him outside. The spilled gasoline is ignited by an unaware bystander&#x27;s match, causing an explosion. During the escalating fire, Melanie and others rush out, but more gulls attack. Melanie takes refuge in a telephone booth. Mitch saves her, and they return to the diner. A distraught woman blames Melanie for the attacks, claiming (from what others told her) they began with her arrival. Mrs. Bundy, an ornithologist who scoffed at the reports of birds attacking, sits in stunned silence.

Mitch and Melanie go to Annie&#x27;s house to fetch Cathy. They find Annie&#x27;s body outside; she was killed by the crows while protecting Cathy. They take a traumatized Cathy home. That night, Melanie and the Brenners barricade themselves in the family home, which is attacked by birds that nearly breach the boarded-up doors and windows. During a lull, Melanie investigates a fluttering sound in the attic bedroom. After discovering that the birds have pecked their way in through the roof, Melanie is attacked, trapping her until Mitch pulls her out. Mitch insists they all drive to San Francisco to take Melanie, now injured, traumatized and catatonic, to a hospital.

As Mitch readies Melanie&#x27;s car for their escape, a sea of birds has gathered around the Brenner house. Mitch quietly moves the car out. The car radio reports bird attacks on nearby communities including Santa Rosa and Sebastopol and that the military may intervene. Cathy retrieves her lovebirds (the only birds who do not attack) from the house and joins Mitch and Lydia as they escort Melanie past a mass of birds and into the car. The car slowly drives away as the birds watch.

== Cast ==

Alfred Hitchcock makes his signature cameo as a man walking dogs out of the pet shop at the beginning of the film. They were two of his own Sealyham Terriers Geoffrey and Stanley.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The screenplay for the film is based on Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s novella &quot;The Birds&quot;, which was first published in her 1952 short story collection &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;. The protagonist of the novella is a farm hand living in Cornwall, and the conclusion of the story is far more pessimistic than that of the film. It was adapted by Evan Hunter, who had written previously for &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, and the television anthology series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. The relationship between Hunter and Hitchcock during the creation of &quot;The Birds&quot; was documented by the writer in his 1997 autobiography, &quot;Me and Hitch&quot;, which contains a variety of correspondence between the writer, director and Hitchcock&#x27;s assistant, Peggy Robertson.

&quot;The Birds&quot; is also partly inspired by the true events of a mass bird attack on the seaside town of Capitola in California on August 18, 1961, when &quot;Capitola residents awoke to a scene that seemed straight out of a horror movie. Hordes of seabirds were dive-bombing their homes, crashing into cars and spewing half-digested anchovies onto lawns&quot;. Alfred Hitchcock heard of this event and used it as research material for this film which was then in progress. The real cause of the birds&#x27; behavior was toxic algae, but that was not known back in the 1960s. In the film, the characters make reference to a similar bird attack &quot;last year&quot; in Santa Cruz, which is an implied reference to the Capitola attack.

===Writing===
Hunter began working on the screenplay in September 1961. He and Hitchcock developed the story, suggesting foundations such as the townspeople having a guilty secret to hide, and the birds an instrument of punishment. He suggested that the film begin using some elements borrowed from the screwball comedy genre, then have it evolve into &quot;stark terror&quot;. This appealed to Hitchcock, according to the writer, because it conformed to his love of suspense: the title and the publicity would have already informed the audience that birds attack, but they do not know when. The initial humor followed by horror would turn the suspense into shock. At first, Hunter wanted the protagonist to be a school teacher, but this ended up being the basis for Annie Hayworth&#x27;s character instead. Hunter organised his scripts by shots instead of scenes, although this did not affect the final film.

Hitchcock solicited comments from several people regarding the first draft of Hunter&#x27;s screenplay. Consolidating their criticisms, Hitchcock wrote to Hunter, suggesting that the script (particularly the first part) was too long, contained insufficient characterization in the two leads, and that some scenes lacked drama and audience interest. Hitchcock, at later stages, consulted with his friends, Hume Cronyn (whose wife Jessica Tandy was playing Lydia), and V. S. Pritchett, who both offered lengthy reflections on the work. This is something that Hunter found difficult. Hitchcock cut the last 10 pages of the screenplay, although some sources say possibly more, in order to create a more ambiguous ending. Originally, he wanted the film to end without a &quot;The End&quot; card, but he was forced to include one before the film&#x27;s full release.

=== Filming and special effects ===
Many exterior scenes were filmed on location at Bodega Bay, California.

The majority of the birds seen in the film are real, although it is estimated that more than $200,000 was spent on the creation of mechanical birds for the film. Ray Berwick was in charge of the live birds used in the production, training and catching many of them himself. Some of the &quot;crows&quot; were actually ravens. The gulls were caught in the San Francisco garbage dump and the sparrows were caught by John &quot;Bud&quot; Cardos. However, the captured sparrows had to be used alongside birds from pet shops to achieve full effect in the scene where they invade the house.

Once the crow attack and attic scenes were assembled by the film&#x27;s editor, George Tomasini, they were sent to the special effects department for enhancement. The film required myriad special effects and Hitchcock commissioned the help of various studios. The special effects shots of the attacking birds were completed at Walt Disney Studios by animator/technician Ub Iwerks, who used the sodium vapor process (&quot;yellow screen&quot;), which he had helped to develop. The SV process films the subject against a screen lit with narrow-spectrum sodium vapor lights. Unlike most compositing processes, SVP shoots two separate elements of the footage simultaneously using a beam-splitter. One reel is regular film stock and the other a film stock with emulsion sensitive only to the sodium vapor wavelength. This results in very precise matte shots compared to blue screen special effects, necessary due to &quot;fringing&quot; of the image from the birds&#x27; rapid wing flapping. At Disney, Iwerks worked on the following scenes: the children&#x27;s party, Melanie driving to Bodega Bay, and the first two cuts of the crow attack sequence. One of the biggest challenges facing Iwerks was the scene where a number of sparrows fly in through the chimney of the family home. Utilizing an optical printer, his superposition of a group of small birds flying inside an enclosed glass booth made it possible to multiply the birds in the living room. Most of the special effects work done at Disney was completed in the Process Lab on printer 10, which was made from Iwerks&#x27; own original design.

At Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Bob Hoag was put in charge of the optical effects for the sequence where Melanie hides inside a telephone booth as it is attacked by the birds. Hitchcock had requested that Hoag remove any shot where Melanie looked placid and urged that she be in constant movement instead. Hoag, along with a team of 30, worked together on the blue backing and sodium matte shots. Linwood Dunn, a founder of Film Effects of Hollywood, was commissioned to work on the attic scene. He was asked to produce a rough cut of the sequence before Hitchcock left for Berlin in December 1962. Bill Abbott, at Fox, was in charge of the optical effects for the crow attack sequence, which would take six weeks to finish. Abbott organised two teams—both working 11 hours a day—to work on the sequence simultaneously. Abbott&#x27;s biggest challenge was size ratio, as he had to ensure that the birds looked like they were attacking the children. He achieved this by placing the birds within frame and zooming in on them to make them the correct size in proportion to the children. At Universal Pictures, associate editor Ross Hoffman and matte artist Albert Whitlock both worked on designing the town&#x27;s backdrop, including the birds in the trees and the scenery for the river shots of Melanie&#x27;s car arriving in Bodega Bay. &quot;The Birds&quot; featured 370 effects shots, the final shot being a composite of 32 separate elements.

== Soundtrack ==

Hitchcock decided to do without any conventional incidental score. Instead, he made use of sound effects and sparse source music in counterpoint to calculated silences. He wanted to use the electroacoustic Mixtur-Trautonium to create the bird calls and noises. He had first encountered this predecessor to the synthesizer on Berlin radio in the late 1920s. It was invented by Friedrich Trautwein, and further developed by Oskar Sala into the Trautonium, which would create some of the bird sounds for this film.

The director commissioned Sala and Remi Gassmann to design an electronic soundtrack. They are credited with &quot;electronic sound production and composition&quot;, and Hitchcock&#x27;s previous musical collaborator, Bernard Herrmann, is credited as &quot;sound consultant&quot;.

Source music includes the first of Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Deux arabesques&quot;, which Tippi Hedren&#x27;s character plays on piano, and &quot;Nickety Nackety Now Now Now&quot; by folk musician Chubby Parker, which is sung by the schoolchildren.

== Analysis ==
=== Themes ===
Among the central themes explored in &quot;The Birds&quot; are those of love and violence. The representation of the birds in the film constantly changes to reflect the development of these themes, and the story itself. At first, the lovebirds in the pet store signify the blossoming love between Melanie and Mitch, and the sexual tension between the two. However, the birds&#x27; symbolism changes once they begin to attack Bodega Bay. Hitchcock stated in an interview that the birds in the film rise up against the humans to punish them for taking nature for granted.

Humanities scholar Camille Paglia wrote a monograph about the film for the BFI Film Classics series. She interprets it as an ode to the many facets of female sexuality and, by extension, nature itself. She notes that women play pivotal roles in it. Mitch is defined by his relationships with his mother, sister, and ex-lover—a careful balance that is disrupted by his attraction to the beautiful Melanie.

=== Style ===
Montage editing and slow pacing are used within the film to build suspense and elicit a greater emotional response from the audience during the attack scenes: &quot;The pattern of &quot;The Birds&quot; was deliberately to go slow&quot;. This is exemplified in the scene where the birds gradually gather outside of the school, while an unobservant Melanie sits and waits on the bench. The camera then cuts between her and the increasing number of birds that swoop down onto the jungle gym behind her until they finally attack.

Eyeline matches and point-of-view (POV) shots within the film encourage audience identification with particular characters and their subjective experiences. This is achieved by cutting between the character and the object of their gaze. For example, when Melanie crosses the bay near the beginning of the film, the camera cuts between close-ups of her face and shots of the Brenner house from her perspective, as she watches Mitch fall for her prank.

The focus on editing and visuals rather than dialogue is also an element of pure cinema that Hitchcock largely uses throughout his work.

===Hitchcock&#x27;s behavior towards Hedren===
More than fifty years after the film was released, it emerged in a series of interviews that Alfred Hitchcock may have behaved inappropriately towards Tippi Hedren during the filming of &quot;The Birds&quot;. Hedren said there were several incidents where she was subjected to sexual harassment from the famed director. Cast and crew described his behaviour on occasion as &quot;obsessive&quot; and Hedren claimed that &quot;he suddenly grabbed me and put his hands on me. It was sexual&quot;. She stated that she rejected Hitchcock&#x27;s advances on numerous occasions. Following the rejection, Hedren was injured during the filming of the phone booth attack scene, consequently suffering cuts to her face from a pane of glass shattering on her. She said she was misled about the logistics of the final attack sequence because mechanical birds were replaced with real ones at the last minute.

There has been speculation that &quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s deliberate inflicting of injury was revenge for Hedren&#x27;s spurning of his advances&quot;. Hitchcock also signed Hedren to a seven-year contract, which she stated restricted her ability to work. These allegations were not brought to light until after Hitchcock&#x27;s death. Although they have never been confirmed, they have widely been reported, including by Hedren&#x27;s co-star, Rod Taylor.

Hedren would later claim during a 2016 interview with Larry King that the sexual advances &quot;didn&#x27;t happen until we were almost finished with &quot;Marnie&quot;&quot;, that they had not started during &quot;The Birds&quot;, and that up until the end of &quot;Marnie&quot; Hitchcock had been &quot;easy to work with&quot;, but in her memoir released around the same time, she repeated the earlier allegations, though clarified that the sexual assaults didn&#x27;t begin until &quot;Marnie&quot;.

The controversy of this relationship is explored in the 2012 HBO/BBC film &quot;The Girl&quot;. Hedren&#x27;s daughter Melanie Griffith claims that Hitchcock&#x27;s abuse extended to her when he played a &quot;prank&quot; by gifting six-year-old Melanie with a wax figure of her mother in a miniature coffin.

== Release ==
The film premiered March 28, 1963, in New York City. The Museum of Modern Art hosted an invitation-only screening as part of a 50-film retrospective of Hitchcock&#x27;s film work. The MoMA series had a booklet with a monograph on the director written by Peter Bogdanovich. The film was screened out of competition in May at a prestigious invitational showing at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival with Hitchcock and Hedren in attendance.

As a special favor to Hedren, Hitchcock allowed her to take a copy of the film with her when she visited her hometown of Minneapolis after the film premiered in New York City. On April 1, Hedren hosted her parents and about 130 residents of Lafayette, Minnesota, where her parents lived when she was born, to an exclusive screening of the film at the local neighborhood theater Hedren frequented in her youth, The Westgate, in Morningside, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, where Hedren grew up. The theater was demolished in 2019.

== Reception == 
&quot;The Birds&quot; received mixed reviews upon its initial release. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was positive, calling it &quot;a horror film that should raise the hackles on the most courageous and put goose-pimples on the toughest hide&quot;. Crowther was unsure whether the birds were meant to be an allegory because &quot;it isn&#x27;t in Mr. Hitchcock&#x27;s style to inject allegorical meanings or social significance in his films&quot;, but he suggested that they could represent the Furies of Greek mythology who pursued the wicked upon the earth. 
The book&#x27;s author Daphne du Maurier disliked the film because Hitchcock changed the location from a farm in England to a sleepy beach community in Northern California.

Andrei Tarkovsky considered it a masterpiece and named it one of the 77 essential works of cinema.

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; called &quot;The Birds&quot; &quot;the worst thriller of his [Hitchcock&#x27;s] that I can remember&quot;.

Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;gorgeous good fun&quot; in the vein of Hitchcock&#x27;s earlier black comedy &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot;, adding: &quot;I haven&#x27;t had this kind of merriment since King Kong toppled from the Empire State Building&quot;. &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;For all the brilliance of scenes like the attack down the chimney, one rarely has a chance to suspend disbelief&quot;, but the review still thought that &quot;there is still a great deal more to enjoy than carp at&quot;. The film ranked second on &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;&#x27;s Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1963. Andrew Sarris of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; praised the film, writing: &quot;Drawing from the relatively invisible literary talents of Daphne du Maurier and Evan Hunter, Alfred Hitchcock has fashioned a major work of cinematic art&quot;.

Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was among the critics who panned the film, writing that Hitchcock &quot;was once widely quoted as saying he hated actors. After his 1960 &quot;Psycho&quot; and now &quot;The Birds&quot;, it must be fairly obvious that he has extended his abhorrence to the whole human race. For reasons hardly justified either dramatically or aesthetically, the old master has become a master of the perverse. He has gone all out for shock for shock&#x27;s sake, and it is too bad&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; published a mixed assessment, writing that while the film was &quot;slickly executed and fortified with his characteristic tongue-in-cheek touches&quot;, Hitchcock &quot;deals more provocatively and effectively in human menace. A fantasy framework dilutes the toxic content of his patented terror-tension formula, and gives the picture a kind of sci-fi exploitation feel, albeit with a touch of production gloss&quot;. Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;a sorry failure. Hard as it may be to believe of Hitchcock, it doesn&#x27;t arouse suspense, which is, of course, what justifies and transforms the sadism that lies at the heart of every thriller. Here the sadism is all too nakedly, repellently present&quot;.

It is the only Hitchcock movie to have been featured in &quot;Mad&quot; (as &quot;For the Birds&quot;, issue 82, October 1963, by Mort Drucker, Arnie Kogen, and Lou Silverstone). In the &quot;Mad&quot; spoof, it is &quot;revealed&quot; that the birds are controlled by Burt Lancaster as revenge for his not having won an Academy Award that year for his starring role in &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot;.

The film&#x27;s first television broadcast was in Canada on CTV television on December 30, 1967. Its subsequent U.S. appearance was on NBC television on January 6, 1968, and became the most watched film on television surpassing &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; with a Nielsen rating of 38.9 and an audience share of 59%. The record was beaten in 1972 by &quot;Love Story&quot;.

With the passage of time, much like many other of Hitchcock&#x27;s works, the film&#x27;s standing among critics has much improved. The film has been very influential on the horror genre inspiring filmmakers like Guillermo del Toro and John Carpenter. On Rotten Tomatoes it has a 93% rating based on reviews from 59 critics, with an average rating of 8.20/10, and the website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Proving once again that build-up is the key to suspense, Hitchcock successfully turned birds into some of the most terrifying villains in horror history&quot;. On Metacritic, it has a score of 90 out of 100, based on reviews from 15 critics. Film critic David Thomson refers to it as Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;last unflawed film&quot;. Italian film maker Federico Fellini ranked the film among his top ten favourite films of all-time list. Akira Kurosawa included the film in his Top 100 Favourite Films of All Time list. In 2000, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the scene where the crows gather on the climbing frame at No. 16 on their list of &quot;The top 100 film moments&quot;. The scenes where birds are attacking humans viciously were collectively ranked at No. 96 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;. In 2021, the film was ranked at No. 29 by &quot;Time Out&quot; on their list of &quot;The 100 best horror movies&quot;.

The film was honored by the American Film Institute as the seventh greatest thriller in American cinema.

===Accolades===
At the 36th Academy Awards, the film&#x27;s special effects supervisor, Ub Iwerks was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Special Effects but lost to &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. Hedren received the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress in 1964, tying with Ursula Andress and Elke Sommer. She also received the Photoplay Award as Most Promising Newcomer. The film ranked No. 1 of the top 10 foreign films selected by the Bengal Film Journalists&#x27; Association Awards. Hitchcock also received the Association&#x27;s Director Award for the film.

It also won the Horror Hall of Fame Award in 1991.

== Remake ==
A planned remake was announced in 2007, starring Naomi Watts and directed by Martin Campbell with a script by Stiles White and Juliet Snowden.

In 2017, the BBC announced it would be creating a television miniseries that followed du Maurier&#x27;s original novel. The series will be written by Conor McPherson and produced by David Heyman&#x27;s Heyday Television.

== Sequel ==
A poorly received television sequel, &quot;The Birds II: Land&#x27;s End&quot;, was released in 1994. Director Rick Rosenthal removed his name from credit and used the Hollywood pseudonym Alan Smithee. The sequel featured entirely new characters and a different setting, with Bodega Bay only mentioned once. Tippi Hedren returned in a supporting role, but not as her original character.

<text>Willard Tobe Hooper (; January 25, 1943 – August 26, 2017) was an American filmmaker, best known for his work in the horror genre. The British Film Institute cited Hooper as one of the most influential horror filmmakers of all time.

Born in Austin, Texas, Hooper&#x27;s feature film debut was the independent &quot;Eggshells&quot; (1969), which he co-wrote with Kim Henkel. The two reunited to co-write &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974), which Hooper also directed. The film went on to become a classic of the genre, and was described in 2010 by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;one of the most influential films ever made.&quot; Hooper subsequently directed the horror film &quot;Eaten Alive&quot; (1976), followed by the 1979 miniseries &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, an adaptation of the novel by Stephen King. Following this, Hooper signed on to direct &quot;The Funhouse&quot; (1981), a major studio slasher film distributed by Universal Pictures. The following year, he directed the supernatural horror &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, produced by Steven Spielberg.

In the mid-1980s, Hooper directed two science fiction horror films: &quot;Lifeforce&quot; (1985) and &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; (1986), followed by &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; (1986), a big-budget sequel to his original film. The 1990s saw Hooper directing various horror and sci-fi projects, including &quot;Spontaneous Combustion&quot; (1990), which he also co-wrote; the television anthology film &quot;Body Bags&quot; (1993); and &quot;The Mangler&quot; (1995), another adaptation of a Stephen King story.

Hooper directed several projects throughout the 2000s, including the monster film &quot;Crocodile&quot; (2000), an episode of the sci-fi miniseries &quot;Taken&quot; (2002), and two episodes of &quot;Masters of Horror&quot; (2005–2006).

==Early life==
Hooper was born January 25, 1943, in Austin, Texas, to Lois Belle (&quot;née&quot; Crosby) and Norman William Ray Hooper, who owned a theater in San Angelo. The film &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; explores hicksploitation themes related to his childhood. He first became interested in filmmaking when he used his father&#x27;s 8 mm camera at the age of nine. He went to college at the University of Texas, Austin. He was present at the college on August 1, 1966, when Charles Whitman opened fire on random people from the University&#x27;s clock tower, fatally shooting a police officer that was close by Hooper.

==Career==
Hooper spent the 1960s as a college professor and documentary cameraman. His 1965 short film &quot;The Heisters&quot; was invited to be entered in the short subject category for an Academy Award, but was not finished in time for the competition that year. His first feature film, &quot;Eggshells&quot; (1969), was made for $40,000.

Soon after, Hooper leapt to fame with &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974). He combined elements from a story he wrote about isolation and darkness with the inspiration of graphic news coverage of violence, with his belief that people were the true monsters being a key element for the film. Along with Kim Henkel, they co-wrote a screenplay that had elements based on the murders of Ed Gein and Elmer Wayne Henley while forming a company named Vortex, Inc. They produced the film alongside Jay Parsley and Richard Saenz. The low budget (roughly less than $140,000) meant that the film was shot seven days a week, having shooting times up to 16 hours a day, dealing with brutally hot temperatures, high humidity and limited special effects. Hooper had to deal with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) with the rating; he had hoped the limited amount of gore seen in the film would give it a PG, but the original print was given an X rating. After some cuts, it was given an R rating. The film was cited as one of the scariest films of all time, with film critic Roger Ebert, despite awarding it only two out of four stars, describing it as a &quot;weird, off-the-wall achievement.&quot; It was also a huge commercial success, making $30 million in the United States and Canada, while being one of the highest grossing independent films of the 1970s.

Hooper&#x27;s next film was &quot;Eaten Alive&quot; (1976), co-written by Henkel and producers Alvin L. Fast and Mardi Rustam. As with &quot;Massacre&quot;, the film was inspired by serial killings, this time the murderer Joe Ball, who killed at least two people in the 1930s and whose crimes led to his nicknames of &#x27;The Alligator Man&#x27; and &#x27;The Butcher of Elmendorf&#x27;. The movie was filmed on sound-stages in California. Hooper provided the music alongside Wayne Bell - but walked off the production before shooting completed.

Hooper had his biggest budget yet with the television mini-series of &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; (1979), filmed on a budget of $4 million for CBS while being released theatrically in some countries. It was a screening of &quot;Massacre&quot; that led producer Richard Kobritz to hire Hooper as director. He shot the film from July to August 1979, although the film differed from the source material (particularly with the violence and graphic scenes) in order to meet broadcast standards. He described it as &#x27;very spooky - it suggests things and always has the overtone of the grave. It affects you differently than my other horror films. It&#x27;s more soft-shelled...it has atmosphere which creates something you cannot escape - the reminder that our time is limited and all the accoutrements that go with it, such as the visuals.&#x27; Hooper then went on to make &quot;The Funhouse&quot; (1981) about teenagers who are stalked by a killer in a carnival fun-house. 

In 1982, Hooper made &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, based on a story by Steven Spielberg. Hooper was selected by Spielberg to direct based on his prior work, Spielberg having co-written the screenplay and co-produced the film. It was Hooper who collaborated with Spielberg to make it more of a ghost story than the original science-fiction-based treatment had been, as it had originally been conceived as a sequel to &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;.

Cannon Films approached Hooper with the offer of a three-picture deal. He made &quot;Lifeforce&quot; (1985), &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; (1986). Hooper also began working steadily in television.

Hooper&#x27;s later works included &quot;Spontaneous Combustion&quot; (1990); the television movie &quot;I&#x27;m Dangerous Tonight&quot; (1990); and &quot;Night Terrors&quot; (1993). He directed an installment of the made-for-television feature &quot;Body Bags&quot; (1993). His works also include &quot;The Mangler&quot; (1995), &quot;The Apartment Complex&quot; (1999), &quot;Crocodile&quot; (2000), &quot;Toolbox Murders&quot; (2004), and &quot;Mortuary&quot; (2005).

Hooper was asked to contribute to the series &quot;Masters of Horror&quot;; he responded by directing &quot;Dance of the Dead&quot; (2005) with Robert Englund in the first season, and &quot;The Damned Thing&quot; in the second season.

In 2010, writer and actor Mark Gatiss interviewed Hooper for the third episode of his BBC documentary series &quot;A History of Horror&quot;.

Hooper&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Midnight Movie&quot;, was published on Three Rivers Press in 2011.

His supernatural thriller film &quot;Djinn&quot; premiered at the 2013 Abu Dhabi Film Festival.

==Personal life==
Hooper was married three times. He married his first wife, Maev Margaret Noonan, in 1961. They divorced in 1969, producing one son, William Tony Hooper, who was born approximately 1966. In the Fall of 1979 issue of &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; magazine, Hooper declared &quot;I&#x27;m divorced. I was married very young and been divorced about eight years.&quot; At the time of the interview, his son was 13 and lived with him in Los Angeles.

Hooper married again in 1983 to Carin Berger (daughter of actor William Berger), but they divorced in 1990. He later married Rita Marie Bartlett in 2008, but they divorced in 2010.

==Death==
Hooper died of natural causes in Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, on August 26, 2017, at the age of 74.

==Legacy==
Filmmakers who have been influenced by Hooper include Hideo Nakata, Wes Craven, Rob Zombie, Alexandre Aja, Jack Thomas Smith, Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Nicolas Winding Refn. Ridley Scott said that his work on &quot;Alien&quot; was influenced more by Hooper&#x27;s &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; than any other genre film.

<text>Refried beans (from , ) is a dish of cooked and mashed beans that is a traditional staple of Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, although each cuisine has a different approach when making the dish. Refried beans are also popular in many other Latin American countries. The English &quot;refried beans&quot; is a mistranslation, since the essence of &quot;frijoles refritos&quot; is the reheating and mashing of the beans.

In this dish, after being boiled and then mashed into a paste, the beans are fried or baked, though as they are fried only once, the term &quot;&quot;re&quot;fried&quot; is misleading. As described by Rick Bayless, &quot;they&#x27;re &quot;refritos&quot;—not fried &quot;again&quot;, as you might assume, but &#x27;well fried&#x27; or &#x27;intensely fried&#x27;.&quot;

==Ingredients and preparation==
In Northern Mexico and Tex-Mex cuisine, refried beans are usually prepared with pinto beans, but many other varieties of bean are used in other parts of Mexico, such as black, Peruano, or red kidney beans. The raw beans can be cooked when dry or soaked overnight, then stewed, drained of most of the remaining liquid, and converted into a paste with a masher (such as a potato masher), or pressed through a fine mesh sieve (to remove the skins). Some of the drained liquid, or chicken or vegetable stock, is added if the consistency is too dry. The paste is then baked or fried, usually with onion and garlic in a small amount of lard, vegetable oil, bacon drippings or butter, and seasoned to taste with salt and spices. In Mexico, lard is most often used, and this has a large effect on flavor. Epazote is a common herb used to add flavor to the dish. It is also a carminative (i.e. it reduces the intestinal gas associated with beans).

==Usage==

In home cooking, refried beans are often served as a side dish accompanying a larger meal or rolled in a tortilla to form a bean burrito.

In the United States, refried beans are most commonly made from pinto beans. They are served as a side dish with most Tex-Mex restaurant meals. They also have become very popular as a dip for maize tortilla chips. Refried beans are also a primary ingredient in many tostada, chimichanga, and pupusa recipes. Additionally, they are a typical ingredient in layered dips, such as seven-layer dip, or in nachos.

<text>I Am Mary Dunne is a novel, first published in 1968, by Northern Irish-Canadian writer Brian Moore about one day in the life of a beautiful and well-to-do 31-year-old Canadian woman living in New York City with her third husband, a successful playwright. Triggered by seemingly unimportant occurrences, the protagonist / first person narrator remembers her past in a series of flashbacks, which reveal her insecurities, her bad conscience concerning her first two husbands, and her fear that she is on the brink of insanity.

&quot;I Am Mary Dunne&quot; has been described as &quot;perhaps [Brian Moore&#x27;s] best book&quot;. Robert Fulford, writing in Canada&#x27;s &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, calls it &quot;[a] feminist novel written before the wave of feminist novels began&quot;.

In its original draft, &quot;I Am Mary Dunne&quot; was called &quot;A Woman of No Identity&quot;.

<text>Xtul, (pronounced ), is a small village in the state of Yucatán, Mexico. It is on the north Gulf of Mexico coast, located west of the city of Progreso inside of the Progreso municipality, about halfway along the road between Sisal and Progreso. The village, like a few others located on the gulf coast, was a location where salt was harvested from the tidal pools in the area; the salt trade in this area dates back to Pre-Columbian times.

Xtul is noted as the location where some 30 members of The Process Church of The Final Judgment went in 1966. They set up camp in an abandoned salt factory. While there they were hit by Hurricane Inez.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurricane Inez (09/21 - 10/11)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting storm lasted for three days. It was during this time that the basic theology of The Process Church was formed, and later written as &quot;The Xtul Dialogues&quot;.

<doc id="304458" wikidata="Q1508248" url="?curid=304458" title="George Seldes">
<text>Henry George Seldes ( ; November 16, 1890 – July 2, 1995) was an American investigative journalist, foreign correspondent, editor, author, and media critic best known for the publication of the newsletter &quot;In Fact&quot; from 1940 to 1950. He was an investigative reporter of the kind known in early 20th century as a muckraker, using his journalism to fight injustice and justify reform.

Influenced by Lincoln Steffens and Walter Lippmann, Seldes&#x27;s career began when he was hired at the &quot;Pittsburgh Leader&quot; at the age of 19. In 1914, he was appointed night editor of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post&quot;. In 1916, he went to the United Press in London. In 1917, during World War I, he moved to France to work at the Marshall Syndicate, where he was a member of the press corps of the American Expeditionary Force. After the War, Seldes spent ten years as a reporter for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. In 1922, he interviewed Vladimir Lenin. He was twice expelled from countries he was reporting from: in 1923 from the Soviet Union, along with three colleagues, for disguising news reports as personal letters, and in 1925 from Italy, for implicating Benito Mussolini in opposition leader Giacomo Matteotti&#x27;s murder. He would leave the &quot;Tribune&quot; when he battled with its owner and publisher, Robert R. McCormick, over the paper altering his 1927 articles on Mexico criticizing the use of their mineral rights by American companies, which he considered to be censorship.

In 1929, Seldes became a freelance reporter and author, subsequently writing a series of books and criticism about his years as a foreign correspondent, and the issues of censorship, suppression and distortion in the press. During the late 1930s he had one more stint as a foreign correspondent, on a freelance basis, in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. In 1940, Seldes co-founded a weekly newsletter, &quot;In Fact&quot;, where he attacked corporate malfeasance, often using government documents from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). He exposed the health hazards of cigarettes and attacked the mainstream press for suppressing them, blaming the newspapers&#x27; heavy dependence on cigarette advertising. He cited J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI for anti-union campaigns, and brought attention to the National Association of Manufacturers&#x27; use of advertising dollars to produce news stories favorable to its members and suppress unfavorable ones.

Having both staunch admirers and strong critics, Seldes influenced some younger journalists. He received an award for professional excellence from the Association for Education in Journalism in 1980 and a George Polk Award for his life&#x27;s work in 1981. Seldes also served on the board of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR).

==Early years==
Henry George Seldes, named after economist Henry George, was born on November 16, 1890, to Jewish émigrés from Russia in Alliance Colony (now Pittsgrove Township), an agricultural community in rural southern New Jersey. His mother, Anna Saphro, died in 1896 when he and his younger brother, Gilbert, were still young. George&#x27;s father, George Sergius Seldes, was a pharmacist and a strongly opinionated and radically philosophical man who was a libertarian and corresponded with Leo Tolstoy and Peter Kropotkin, being interested in the latter&#x27;s ideas on mutual aid. He influenced every aspect of his sons&#x27; lives, pushing them to &quot;read books that you will reread—and that you will never outgrow,&quot; and refusing to force religion upon children who were &quot;too young to understand it,&quot; instilling a free-thinking attitude in his sons.

When he was 19, Seldes went to work at the &quot;Pittsburgh Leader&quot;. An early scoop of his for this paper was when three-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan expelled Seldes from Bryan&#x27;s hotel room. He also interviewed a saleswoman who had filed a rape complaint against the son of the owner of a large department store, but the story was not published, and Seldes became outraged when the advertising department of the newspaper blackmailed the owner into buying more advertising. In 1914, he was appointed night editor of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post&quot;. As a young journalist, he was influenced by the investigative journalism of muckraker Lincoln Steffens, whom he met in 1919; he was also influenced by Walter Lippman. Just before World War I, he&#x27;d study for a year at Harvard University, at the instigation of his brother Gilbert.

==World War I==
In 1916, Seldes moved to London where he worked for the United Press. When the United States joined the First World War in 1917, Seldes was sent to France where he worked, first briefly as the managing editor of the Army edition of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, based in Paris, then as the war correspondent for the Marshall Syndicate. He became a member of the press corps of the American Expeditionary Forces in France, section G-2D, and as such was commissioned as an officer, as were all journalists in that group.

At the end of the war, he obtained an exclusive interview with Paul von Hindenburg, the supreme commander of the German Army, in which Hindenburg supposedly acknowledged the role America had played in defeating Germany. &quot;The American infantry,&quot; said Hindenburg, according to Seldes, &quot;won the World War in battle in the Argonne.&quot; Seldes and the others were accused of breaking the Armistice and were court martialed. They were also forbidden to write anything about the interview and it never appeared in American news media. Seldes believed that blocking publication of this interview proved tragic. Unaware of Hindenburg&#x27;s direct testimony of Germany&#x27;s military defeat, Germans adopted the &quot;Dolchstoss&quot; or stab-in-the-back myth that Germany had only lost the war because it was betrayed at home by &quot;the socialists, the Communists and the Jews,&quot; which served as Nazism&#x27;s explanation for Germany&#x27;s defeat. &quot;If the Hindenburg interview had been passed by Pershing&#x27;s censors at the time, it would have been headlined in every country civilized enough to have newspapers and undoubtedly would have made an impression on millions of people and became an important page in history,&quot; wrote Seldes. &quot;I believe it would have destroyed the main planks on which Hitler rose to power, it would have prevented World War II, the greatest and worst war in all history, and it would have changed the future of all mankind.&quot;

However, it was Hindenburg himself, who in a hearing before a committee of the German National Assembly investigating the causes of the World War and Germany&#x27;s defeat, on November 18, 1919, a year after the war&#x27;s end, declared, &quot;As an English general has very truly said, the German Army was &#x27;stabbed in the back&#x27;,&quot; grossly misrepresenting General Frederick Maurice&#x27;s book, &quot;The Last Four Months.&quot; It was particularly this testimony of Hindenburg that led to the widespread &quot;Dolchstoßlegende&quot; in post-World War I Germany.

Seldes claimed that the Battle of Saint-Mihiel never happened. In his account, General Pershing planned to capture the city, but on September 1 the Germans decided to remove their forces from Saint-Mihiel to reinforce other positions. Seldes claimed no shots were fired as the first Americans, he among them, entered the city on September 13 to be greeted as liberators before General Pershing, Pétain, and other high-ranking officers arrived. The thousands of German prisoners captured, he wrote, were taken as they mistakenly arrived at the train station days later to relieve the German troops that had left days earlier.

==Lenin and Mussolini==
Seldes spent the next ten years as an international reporter for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. At the instigation of war correspondent Floyd Gibbons, he dropped the name &quot;Henry&quot;, and started covering international affairs, despite originally being relunctant to do so. He interviewed Lenin in 1922. He and three other reporters were expelled in 1923 when Soviet authorities, who routinely censored foreign reporters&#x27; telegraphed dispatches, found articles by the four reporters, disguised as personal letters, being smuggled out in a diplomatic mailpouch to avoid censorship. The expulsion was facilitated, according to Seldes, after his publisher and owner, &quot;Colonel&quot; Robert R. McCormick, failed to show sufficient respect when writing to the Soviets to protest censorship.

In 1925, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; sent him to Italy where he wrote about Benito Mussolini and the rise of fascism. (Mussolini had served as Seldes&#x27;s stringer before the former took power.) He investigated the murder of Giacomo Matteotti, the head of the parliamentary section of the Italian Unitary Socialist Party. His article implicated Mussolini in the killing, and Seldes was expelled from Italy. He wrote an account of Italian censorship and intimidation of American reporters for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

In 1927, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; sent Seldes to Mexico, but his articles criticizing American corporations for their use of that country&#x27;s mineral rights were not well received. Seldes returned to Europe, but found that his work increasingly censored to fit the political views of the newspaper&#x27;s owner, McCormick.

==Freelance==
Disillusioned, Seldes left the &quot;Tribune&quot; and went to work as a freelance writer. In his first two books, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Print That!&quot; (1929) and &quot;Can These Things Be!&quot; (1931), Seldes included material that he had not been allowed to publish in the &quot;Tribune&quot;. His next book, &quot;World Panorama&quot; (1933), was a narrative history of the interbellum period. In 1932 he married Helen Larkin Wiesman (later Seldes), who died in the late 1970s.

In 1934, Seldes published a history of the Roman Catholic Church, &quot;The Vatican&quot;. This was followed by an exposé of the global arms industry, &quot;Iron, Blood and Profits&quot; (1934) and an account of Benito Mussolini, &quot;Sawdust Caesar&quot; (1935).

Two books on the newspaper business established his enduring reputation as a critic of the press: &quot;Freedom of the Press&quot; (1935) and &quot;Lords of the Press&quot; (1938). He took the title of the latter from a speech by Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes: &quot;Our ancestors did not fight for the right of a few Lords of the Press to have almost exclusive control of and censorship over the dissemination of news and ideas.&quot; He believed &quot;that advertisers were a far greater threat to journalistic freedom than government censorship.&quot; The press and news, he wrote, &quot;are coming more and more under the domination of a handful of corporate publishers who may print such news as they wish to print and omit such news as they do not wish to print.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; was initially positive in its response: &quot;A rambling but effective attack on U. S. newspapers, charging coloring, distortion or suppression of vital news, containing some enlightening instances of journalistic malpractices as George Seldes encountered them during his career as correspondent.&quot; Later, &quot;Time&quot; called him a muckraker, meaning a biased and crusading critic, when it called another writer&#x27;s work &quot;refreshingly fair and accurate (especially in comparison with muckraking books like George Seldes&#x27; Lords of the Press).&quot; Seldes told of his pursuit of a tobacco study that he would make public years later, though the author of the study denied his account and claimed his work had been widely cited in the press.

With his wife Helen, he also reported on the Spanish Civil War on a freelance basis for three years and later said that American reporters too readily accepted what the Franco side wanted them to believe. His disgust at the American press for their Civil War coverage motivated him to start his own newsletter, &quot;In Fact&quot;. The Seldeses saw the Civil War as a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for what came to be World War II.

On August 4, 1939, Seldes, along with 400 other writers and intellectuals, signed a letter condemning anti-Soviet attitudes in the United States, called for better relations between the two countries, described the Soviet Union as a supporter of world peace, and said, &quot;The Soviet Union considers political dictatorship a transitional form and has shown a steadily expanding democracy&quot;. The letter was published in September 1939, shortly after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact had become known in the United States, and later in September, same month that the Soviet invasion of Poland began.

On his return to the United States in 1940, Seldes published &quot;Witch Hunt&quot;, an account of the persecution of people with left-wing political views in America, and &quot;The Catholic Crisis&quot;, which sought to demonstrate the close relationship between the Catholic Church and fascist organizations in Europe. When &quot;Time&quot; reviewed the latter, it noted several of Seldes&#x27; works and said he &quot;stuck out his tongue at Benito Mussolini ... thumbed his nose at U. S. journalism ... and uttered some hoarse Bronx cheers at the Roman Catholic Church.&quot; The review complained that his detailed accounts of church activities were &quot;in part damaging&quot; but &quot;not all germane to the subject.&quot;

==&quot;In Fact&quot;==
From 1940 to 1950, Seldes published a political newsletter, &quot;In Fact&quot; which originally had the full name &quot;In Fact: For the millions who want a free press&quot; and later &quot;In Fact: An Antidote for Falsehood in the Daily Press&quot;, &quot;a four-page weekly compendium of news other newspapers wouldn&#x27;t print.&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; editor and later press critic Ben Bagdikian and former &quot;New York Post&quot; reporter Victor Weingarten said, &quot;When Seldes was no longer printed by the mainstream press, he was an important conduit to the journalistic community, who knew that there were flaws in the system, but often couldn&#x27;t get printed in their own newspapers, because the press cannot be a watchdog on itself. So they fed stories critical of the press to Seldes.&quot; Seldes himself said that more than 200 newspapermen gave him stories every week. However, the most commonly used sources were government documents from the &quot;Congressional Report&quot;, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other specialized public resources, which were seldom relied upon by the mainstream media. At the height of its popularity it had a circulation of 176,000.

One of the first articles published in the newsletter concerned the dangers of cigarette smoking. Seldes later explained that at the time, &quot;The tobacco stories were suppressed by every major newspaper. For ten years we pounded on tobacco as being one of the only legal poisons you could buy in America.&quot; At a time when tobacco companies were major advertisers, Seldes discussed the contents of a study, &quot;Tobacco Smoking and Longevity,&quot; which he said had been suppressed since 1939. Throughout the 10-year run of &quot;In Fact&quot;, Seldes published more than 50 stories on the health effects of tobacco and the cigarette industry&#x27;s attempts at suppressing such news.

Among the favorite targets of &quot;In Fact&quot; was the National Association of Manufacturers. Defense analyst Daniel Ellsberg, who subscribed to &quot;In Fact&quot; while an undergraduate at Harvard, said, &quot;I heard about the National Association of Manufacturers first from Seldes and more from Seldes than I ever heard again. If you were to read the press itself, you&#x27;d hardly become aware that such organizations existed, that businessmen worked together to pursue their own interests.&quot; &quot;In Fact&quot; also attacked Charles Lindbergh for his Nazi sympathies, the American Legion for helping to break strikes, and labeled many captains of industry as &quot;native fascists.&quot; Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said, &quot;[Seldes] used the word fascism to reflect an authoritarian state of mind that tended to stifle free speech and dissent and also tended to believe that might was right.&quot;

&quot;In Fact&quot; immediately attracted the attention of government authorities. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered an FBI investigation of Seldes and &quot;In Fact&quot; in 1940. Articles claiming that the FBI was infiltrating unions and monitoring union activities resulted in FBI surveillance of Seldes and his publication. J. Edgar Hoover sent Seldes a 15-page letter denying such FBI activities. The FBI subsequently questioned &quot;In Fact&quot; subscribers, particularly servicemen and women, and had U.S. postal officials reporting to the FBI on Seldes&#x27; mail correspondence. &quot;In Fact&quot; lost many of its subscribers in the late 1940s. Seldes later claimed that his critical coverage of Yugoslavia got the publication banned from Communist Party bookstores. The political climate discouraged subscriptions on the part of less ideologically committed readers as well. &quot;In Fact&quot; ceased publication in 1950. &quot;I. F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, which started publication in 1953, took &quot;In Fact&quot; as its model.

In addition to writing his newsletter, Seldes continued to publish books. They included &quot;Facts and Fascism&quot; (1943) and &quot;One Thousand Americans&quot; (1947), an account of the people who controlled America. &quot;Time&quot; called &quot;One Thousand Americans&quot; &quot;a collection of truths, half-truths and untruths about the U.S. press and industry.&quot; &quot;One Thousand Americans&quot; introduced a wide audience to the Business Plot, a supposed plan of America&#x27;s corporate elite to overthrow the U.S. government in the early 1930s.

Seldes published &quot;The People Don&#x27;t Know&quot; on the origins of the Cold War in 1949.

==Politics and later career==
According to KGB documents, Seldes was a longtime secret member of the U.S. Communist Party since well before 1940 who was valued for his &quot;major connections&quot; in Washington.

Seldes later wrote that &quot;In Fact&quot; was founded at the instigation of the U.S. Communist Party leadership, but he wrote that the party worked through his partner Bruce Minton (also known as Richard Bransten) without his knowledge. Seldes wrote that he was unaware that Minton was a party member who received the funds to start &quot;In Fact&quot; from the Communist Party. While his political positions often were similar to those in the Party in 1940, by 1948 Seldes was writing in positive terms of the anti-Soviet communism of Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia, which earned him the wrath of many Communist Party loyalists in the United States. As the Cold War took shape at the end of the decade, Seldes lost readership from both the Communists and the anti-liberal-left sentiment that was sweeping the country, including a trade union movement that had contained some of his largest audience. The nationwide atmosphere of McCarthyism and red-baiting further diminished his subscribers&#x27; numbers, and he was financially forced to close &quot;In Fact&quot;, which never accepted advertising, in October 1950.

Senator Joseph McCarthy subpoenaed Seldes in 1953. Seldes vehemently denied Communist Party membership and was &quot;cleared&quot; by McCarthy&#x27;s Senate subcommittee, but Seldes&#x27;s greatest influence on readers had already passed. Seldes did publish &quot;Tell the Truth and Run&quot; in 1953, but otherwise found it difficult to publish his work throughout the 1950s. He was approached, however, by an old friend and colleague, I.F. Stone, for advice on how to start a small independent investigative newspaper. &quot;I.F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot; premiered in 1953, picking up where Seldes had left off.

Largely dropping his own writing, he developed an anthology called &quot;The Great Quotations&quot; and received rejections from 20 publishers. It sold more than a million copies when it appeared in 1961.

In a letter to &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1974, he appraised the state of American journalism as much improved in his lifetime:

The press deserved the attacks and criticisms of Will Irwin (1910) and Upton Sinclair (1920) and the muckrakers who followed, and it needs today the watchdog and gadfly activities of the new critical weeklies, but all in all it is now a better medium of mass information ... The 1972 Watergate disclosures, it is true, were made by only a score of the members of the mass media, but I remember Teapot Dome when only one of our 1,750 dailies (the &quot;Albuquerque Morning Journal&quot;) dared to tell the truth about White House corruption. We have come a long way since.

He published &quot;Never Tire of Protesting&quot; in 1968 and &quot;Even the Gods Can&#x27;t Change History&quot; in 1976.

The Association for Education in Journalism gave him an award for professional excellence in 1980. In 1981 he received the George Polk Award for his life&#x27;s work.

He published his autobiography, &quot;Witness to a Century&quot; in 1987. He wrote, &quot;And so [my brother] Gilbert and I, brought up without a formal religion, remained throughout our lifetimes just what Father was, freethinkers. And, likewise, doubters and dissenters and perhaps Utopians. Father&#x27;s rule had been &#x27;Question everything, take nothing for granted,&#x27; and I never outlived it, and I would suggest it be made the motto of a world journalists&#x27; association.&quot;

In 1981, Seldes appeared in Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Reds&quot;, a film about the life of journalist John Reed. Seldes appears as one of the film&#x27;s &quot;witnesses&quot; commenting on the historical events depicted in the film.

Seldes served on the board of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR).

Martin A. Lee and Norman Solomon used a quote from Seldes as an epigraph for their book &quot;Unreliable Sources&quot;: &quot;The most sacred cow of the press is the press itself.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
According to journalist Randolph T. Holhut, when he met Seldes in 1992, the latter had suffered a stroke &quot;a couple of years earlier&quot;, which had &quot;slowed him somewhat&quot;, had good memory of the past but not the present, required round-the-clock care and was unable to walk alone, &quot;tired easily and [...] spent much of each day sleeping&quot;, and still could see but not hear.

Seldes died on July 2, 1995, in Windsor, Vermont, at 104. A delegation of journalists attended the memorial service at his home in Hartland Four Corners, Vermont, read from his books and watched an excerpt from &quot;Tell the Truth and Run: George Seldes and the American Press,&quot; a documentary in progress.

The documentary was produced and directed by Rick Goldsmith and premiered the following year, in 1996. It covered Seldes&#x27;s life and career, and revived the life and work of a man who for four decades had been largely forgotten. The film looked at Seldes&#x27;s life and work, especially the theme of censorship and suppression in America&#x27;s news media. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, and received many other accolades, including the John O&#x27;Connor Film Award from the American Historical Association.

==Critical reception==
Seldes had both staunch admirers and strong critics. Some of his contemporaries and later historians have judged much of his work harshly. One critic thought I. F. Stone &quot;was light years beyond Seldes.&quot; Others cited his political bias and preconceptions. A study of the Dies Committee said that Seldes&#x27;s account in &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; suffered from his view that everything the Committee did was wrong. Another warned that &quot;The Catholic Crisis&quot; &quot;should be read with great caution in view of the author&#x27;s latent anti-Catholic and pro-Communist bias.&quot; Another cited Seldes as a writer with &quot;an agenda.&quot; Still another evaluated &quot;Iron, Blood, and Profits&quot; as &quot;less sober&quot; than other works on the subject of international arms dealing. Of his biography of Mussolini, another wrote: &quot;many of his sources were unreliable and his book was almost devoid of logical order.&quot; A more appreciative assessment said &quot;Freedom of the Press&quot; was &quot;one-sided, but well deserves careful reading.&quot; Summing up Seldes&#x27;s work, another wrote that &quot;until 1947 [Seldes] followed the Stalinist line so closely that any author must use him with the utmost care.&quot;

A. J. Liebling said on him, &quot;[George Seldes is] about as subtle as a house falling in. He makes too much of the failure of newspapers to print exactly what George Seldes would have printed if he were the managing editor. But he is a useful citizen. In fact is a fine little gadfly, representing an enormous effort for one man and his wife&quot;.

According to historian Helen Fordham, Seldes&#x27;s career demonstrates that those who crusade too vehemently may violate standards of impartiality and objectivity. As a result, their work may and be labelled as radical and subversive.

But a whole generation of journalists and activists were influenced greatly by Seldes. Long-time &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Colman McCarthy said, &quot;[...] I&#x27;m always amused when they call somebody &#x27;one-sided&#x27;. Seldes offered one side – the side you weren&#x27;t getting elsewhere. [...] He was a reporter who didn&#x27;t worry about being objective. He worried about what he would choose to write&quot;. Nader said of Seldes, &quot;He was like a doctor. He reported about disease in the political economy, and the gross inequities of power, and the abuses and the exploitation. [...] I always wanted to be a crusading lawyer, and he gave me some materials to contemplate crusading about.&quot; Journalist Nat Hentoff said, &quot;He took what should be the most honorable term in journalism – muckraking – and made it work again. [...] A lot of journalists of his generation and the generation or two that followed, did more, took risks, because [Seldes] was the model. And the fact that he was there made them feel like whores if they didn&#x27;t do more.&quot;

Randolph T. Holhut considered Seldes, alongside Lincoln Steffens and I. F. Stone, one of &quot;three great independent journalists&quot; of the 20th century, as well as &quot;the living link between Steffens and Stone&quot;, lamenting that his career has been &quot;overlooked&quot; in comparison to the latter two, and stating that &quot;the story of George Seldes is the story of the Twentieth Century&quot;.

People such as Peggy Charren and I. F. Stone also claimed influence from Seldes.

==Family==
The writer and critic Gilbert Seldes was George Seldes&#x27;s younger brother. Actress Marian Seldes was his niece; his nephew was the literary agent Timothy Seldes.

He was married to Helen Larkin Seldes, née Wiesman, from 1932 to her death in 1979, at the age of 74, in Spain, while they were tourists there, of a rare blood condition. Helen was 15 years younger than George. His niece Marian stated, in the documentary &quot;Tell the Truth and Run&quot;, that he waited for his wife. According to George himself, they first met at a party in Paris, where she told him she wanted to go to Moscow to work in biochemistry, but he tried to dissuade her by giving her an account of how people lived badly in Russia, only for her to respond that she never wanted to see him again. They met a second time at another party, where she told him that his and other accounts dissuaded her from moving to Moscow; he invited her to dinner at a restaurant, then took her to his home, and from then they started living together, marrying after a while.

==Footnotes==
:aa. Asked how to say his name, he told the &quot;Literary Digest&quot; in 1936: &quot;Nine persons out of ten mispronounce our name. If it had an &quot;n&quot; instead of an &quot;s&quot; as the final letter there would be no difficulty. The name is pronounced like &quot;Selden&quot; with the last letter an &quot;s&quot;&quot;: .
:ab. According to Minton the Party wanted an American version of Claud Cockburn&#x27;s muckraking London political weekly, &quot;The Week&quot;.

<text>Guilin (Standard Zhuang: &quot;Gveilinz&quot;), formerly romanized as Kweilin, is a prefecture-level city in the northeast of China&#x27;s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It is situated on the west bank of the Li River and borders Hunan to the north. Its name means &quot;forest of sweet osmanthus&quot;, owing to the large number of fragrant sweet osmanthus trees located in the region. The city has long been renowned for its scenery of karst topography.

Guilin is one of China&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations, and the epithet &quot;By water, by mountains, most lovely, Guilin&quot; () is often associated with the city. The State Council of China has designated Guilin a National Famous Historical and Cultural City, doing so in the first edition of the list.

== History ==
Before the Qin dynasty, the Guilin region was settled by the Baiyue people. In 314 BC, a small settlement was established along the banks of the Li River.

During the Qin dynasty&#x27;s (221–206 BC) campaigns against the state of Nanyue, the first administration was set up in the area around Guilin. The modern city was located within the Guilin Commandery, which is the origin of the modern name &quot;Guilin&quot;.

In 111 BC, during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty, Shi&#x27;an County () was established, which could be regarded as the beginning of the city.

In AD 507, the town was renamed Guizhou (Gui Prefecture, ).

In 634, Lingui County was established at the modern site of Guilin, under Gui Prefecture. In 868, Pang Xun rebelled against the Tang from Gui Prefecture.

Guilin prospered in the Tang and Song dynasties but remained a county. The city was also a nexus between the central government and the southwest border, and it was where regular armies were placed to guard that border. Canals were built through the city so that food supplies could be directly transported from the food-productive Yangtze plain to the farthest southwestern point of the empire.

In 997, Guangnan West Circuit, the predecessor of modern Guangxi, was established, with Guizhou as the capital. In 1133, Guizhou was renamed Jingjiang Prefecture (). In 1367, the name was changed to Guilin Prefecture ().

In 1921, Guilin became one of the headquarters of the Northern Expeditionary Army led by Sun Yat-sen. In 1940, Guilin City was established. Guilin was the provincial capital of Guangxi before 1912 and from 1936 to 1949.

Guilin became one of the most important military, transport, and cultural centers of China during World War II. The city drastically expanded as refugees from all over China poured in, and by 1944 its population had grown from 70,000 pre-war to more than 500,000. It hosted intellectuals and artists including Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, Tian Han, Xu Beihong, Feng Zikai and many others.

In 1950, the provincial capital of Guangxi was moved from Guilin to Nanning.

In 1981, Guilin was listed by the State Council as one of the four cities (the other three being Beijing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou) where the protection of historical and cultural heritage, as well as natural scenery, should be treated as a priority project.

<text>&quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot; is a song written by American musician Billy Joel. The song was released as a single on September 18, 1989, and later released as part of Joel&#x27;s album &quot;Storm Front&quot; on October 17, 1989. A list song, its fast-paced lyrics include a series of brief references to 119 significant political, cultural, scientific, and sporting events between 1949 (the year of Joel&#x27;s birth) and 1989, in mainly chronological order.

The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and, in late 1989, became Joel&#x27;s third single to reach number one in the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Storm Front&quot; became Joel&#x27;s third album to reach number one in the US. &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;, particularly in the 21st century, has become the basis of many pop culture parodies, and continues to be repurposed in various television shows, advertisements, and comedic productions. Despite its early success, Joel later noted his dislike of the song musically, and it was critically panned as one of his worst by later generations of music critics.

== History ==
Joel conceived the idea for the song when he had just turned 40. He was in a recording studio and met a 21-year-old friend of Sean Lennon who said &quot;It&#x27;s a terrible time to be 21!&quot;. Joel replied: &quot;Yeah, I remember when I was 21 – I thought it was an awful time and we had Vietnam, and y&#x27;know, drug problems, and civil rights problems and everything seemed to be awful&quot;. The friend replied: &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it&#x27;s different for you. You were a kid in the fifties and everybody knows that nothing happened in the fifties&quot;. Joel retorted: &quot;Wait a minute, didn&#x27;t you hear of the Korean War or the Suez Canal Crisis?&quot; Joel later said those headlines formed the basic framework for the song.

Joel later criticized the song on strictly musical grounds. In 1993, when discussing it with documentary filmmaker David Horn, Joel compared its melodic content unfavorably to his song &quot;The Longest Time&quot;: &quot;Take a song like &#x27;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&#x27;. It&#x27;s really not much of a song ... If you take the melody by itself, terrible. Like a dentist drill.&quot;

When asked if he deliberately intended to chronicle the Cold War with his song he responded: &quot;It was just my luck that the Soviet Union decided to close down shop [soon after putting out the song]&quot;, and that this span &quot;had a symmetry to it, it was 40 years&quot; that he had lived through. He was asked if he could do a follow-up about the next couple of years after the events that transpired in the original song, and he commented: &quot;No, I wrote one song already and I don&#x27;t think it was really that good to begin with, melodically&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Upon its release, &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot; was met with a mixed response. David Giles from &quot;Music Week&quot; wrote, &quot;Promising return which finds Joel in rockier mood with a very wordy song cramming in references to virtually every major figure and event in the twentieth century. After all that, the message of the lyrics is foggy and confused, but this should certainly see him back in the charts.&quot;

Though the lyrics are rapid-fire with several people and events mentioned in each stanza, there is widespread agreement on the meaning of the lyrics. Steven Ettinger wrote:

After a cover by Fall Out Boy was released in 2023 to negative critical reception, the song was once again brought to the forefront, and modern critics panned even the original song as one of Joel&#x27;s worst in his entire catalog.

== Music video ==

A music video for the song was directed by Chris Blum. The video begins with a newly married couple entering their 1940s-style kitchen, and shows events in their domestic life over the next four decades, including the addition and growth of their children and grandchildren, the 1950s housewife burning dinner, a distraught 1960s housewife whose disinterested husband and children won&#x27;t eat her cooking, popping pills, the hippie counterculture children burning their bras and draft cards while smoking marijuana in the kitchen, and the eventual death of the family&#x27;s father. The passage of time is also depicted by periodic redecoration and upgrades of the kitchen, while an unchanging Billy Joel looks on in the background. Joel is also shown banging on a table in front of a burning backdrop depicting various images that include the execution of Nguyễn Văn Lém and the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald, among others.

== Derivations ==
Many parodies and takeoffs have been based on the song (often expanding to events that have occurred since 1989). These parodies include &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; parody &quot;They&#x27;ll Never Stop the Simpsons&quot; at the end of the 2002 &quot;Gump Roast&quot; episode, and the San Francisco a cappella group The Richter Scales&#x27; 2007 Webby Award-winning parody &quot;Here Comes Another Bubble&quot;.

On May 17, 1990, the Irish rock band the Memories reached number one on the Irish Singles Chart with their version of the song entitled &quot;The Game (Italia &#x27;90)&quot; which celebrated Republic of Ireland&#x27;s qualification for the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. Billy Joel partially covered the Memories version when he performed in Dublin.

In 2004, Boris Novković and Dino Dvornik released a song &quot;Malo nas je, al&#x27; nas ima&quot; (&quot;We Are Few, But We Exist&quot;), listing Croatian VIPs and events.

In 2006, Coca-Cola sampled the song to make an anthem for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Latin America, changing the lyrics according to the country.

In 2007, JibJab released an installment of their then-annual &quot;Year in Review&quot; videos, which was set to the tune of &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;.

YouTuber Dane Boedigheimer, known as the creator of the popular comedic web series &quot;Annoying Orange&quot;, produced a parody as part of YouTube&#x27;s Comedy Week in 2013 titled &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Viral&quot;, although the video&#x27;s audio was later replaced for copyright infringement despite being considered fair use as a work of parody.

Pop band Milo Greene performed a version of the song in June 2013 for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; A.V. Undercover series.

In 2019, talk show host Jimmy Fallon performed a version of the song for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, which highlights characters and moments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since &quot;Iron Man&quot;, leading to &quot;&quot;, with backup by cast members Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Mark Ruffalo, Paul Rudd, Danai Gurira, Karen Gillan and Brie Larson.

On June 28, 2023, Fall Out Boy released their own version of the song with updated lyrics that references events that happened from 1989 to 2023. Unlike Joel&#x27;s original, Fall Out Boy&#x27;s version did not list events in chronological order. On September 12, 2023, the band performed it at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was widely panned by fans and critics, especially for its lack of chronological sequencing present in Joel&#x27;s original and its omission of some events and people, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic. Fall Out Boy bassist and lead songwriter, Pete Wentz, said in an interview regarding the exclusion, &quot;It’s like, [COVID-19]&#x27;s all anybody talked…[sic] You know what I mean? I don’t know.&quot;

<text>A case study is an in-depth, detailed examination of a particular case (or cases) within a real-world context. For example, case studies in medicine may focus on an individual patient or ailment; case studies in business might cover a particular firm&#x27;s strategy or a broader market; similarly, case studies in politics can range from a narrow happening over time like the operations of a specific political campaign, to an enormous undertaking like world war, or more often the policy analysis of real-world problems affecting multiple stakeholders.

Generally, a case study can highlight nearly any individual, group, organization, event, belief system, or action. A case study does not necessarily have to be one observation (N=1), but may include many observations (one or multiple individuals and entities across multiple time periods, all within the same case study). Research projects involving numerous cases are frequently called cross-case research, whereas a study of a single case is called within-case research.

Case study research has been extensively practiced in both the social and natural sciences.

== Definition ==
There are multiple definitions of case studies, which may emphasize the number of observations (a small N), the method (qualitative), the thickness of the research (a comprehensive examination of a phenomenon and its context), and the naturalism (a &quot;real-life context&quot; is being examined) involved in the research. There is general agreement among scholars that a case study does not necessarily have to entail one observation (N=1), but can include many observations within a single case or across numerous cases. For example, a case study of the French Revolution would at the bare minimum be an observation of two observations: France before and after a revolution. John Gerring writes that the N=1 research design is so rare in practice that it amounts to a &quot;myth&quot;.

The term &quot;cross-case&quot; research is frequently used for studies of multiple cases, whereas &quot;within-case&quot; research is frequently used for a single case study.

John Gerring defines the case study approach as an &quot;intensive study of a single unit or a small number of units (the cases), for the purpose of understanding a larger class of similar units (a population of cases)&quot;. According to Gerring, case studies lend themselves to an idiographic style of analysis, whereas quantitative work lends itself to a nomothetic style of analysis. He adds that &quot;the defining feature of qualitative work is its use of noncomparable observations—observations that pertain to different aspects of a causal or descriptive question&quot;, whereas quantitative observations are comparable.

According to John Gerring, the key characteristic that distinguishes case studies from all other methods is the &quot;reliance on evidence drawn from a single case and its attempts, at the same time, to illuminate features of a broader set of cases&quot;. Scholars use case studies to shed light on a &quot;class&quot; of phenomena.

== Research design ==

As with other social science methods, no single research design dominates case study research. Case studies can use at least four types of designs. First, there may be a &quot;no theory first&quot; type of case study design, which is closely connected to Kathleen M. Eisenhardt&#x27;s methodological work. A second type of research design highlights the distinction between single- and multiple-case studies, following Robert K. Yin&#x27;s guidelines and extensive examples. A third design deals with a &quot;social construction of reality&quot;, represented by the work of Robert E. Stake. Finally, the design rationale for a case study may be to identify &quot;anomalies&quot;. A representative scholar of this design is Michael Burawoy. Each of these four designs may lead to different applications, and understanding their sometimes unique ontological and epistemological assumptions becomes important. However, although the designs can have substantial methodological differences, the designs also can be used in explicitly acknowledged combinations with each other.

While case studies can be intended to provide bounded explanations of single cases or phenomena, they are often intended to raise theoretical insights about the features of a broader population.

=== Case selection and structure ===

Case selection in case study research is generally intended to find cases that are representative samples and which have variations on the dimensions of theoretical interest. Using that is solely representative, such as an average or typical case is often not the richest in information. In clarifying lines of history and causation it is more useful to select subjects that offer an interesting, unusual, or particularly revealing set of circumstances. A case selection that is based on representativeness will seldom be able to produce these kinds of insights.

While a random selection of cases is a valid case selection strategy in large-N research, there is a consensus among scholars that it risks generating serious biases in small-N research. Random selection of cases may produce unrepresentative cases, as well as uninformative cases. Cases should generally be chosen that have a high expected information gain. For example, outlier cases (those which are extreme, deviant or atypical) can reveal more information than the potentially representative case. A case may also be chosen because of the inherent interest of the case or the circumstances surrounding it. Alternatively, it may be chosen because of researchers&#x27; in-depth local knowledge; where researchers have this local knowledge they are in a position to &quot;soak and poke&quot; as Richard Fenno put it, and thereby to offer reasoned lines of explanation based on this rich knowledge of setting and circumstances.

Beyond decisions about case selection and the subject and object of the study, decisions need to be made about the purpose, approach, and process of the case study. Gary Thomas thus proposes a typology for the case study wherein purposes are first identified (evaluative or exploratory), then approaches are delineated (theory-testing, theory-building, or illustrative), then processes are decided upon, with a principal choice being between whether the study is to be single or multiple, and choices also about whether the study is to be retrospective, snapshot or diachronic, and whether it is nested, parallel or sequential.

In a 2015 article, John Gerring and Jason Seawright list seven case selection strategies:

# Typical cases are cases that exemplify a stable cross-case relationship. These cases are representative of the larger population of cases, and the purpose of the study is to look &quot;within&quot; the case rather than compare it with other cases.
# Diverse cases are cases that have variations on the relevant X and Y variables. Due to the range of variation on the relevant variables, these cases are representative of the full population of cases.
# Extreme cases are cases that have an extreme value on the X or Y variable relative to other cases.
# Deviant cases are cases that defy existing theories and common sense. They not only have extreme values on X or Y (like extreme cases) but defy existing knowledge about causal relations.
# Influential cases are cases that are central to a model or theory (for example, Nazi Germany in theories of fascism and the far-right).
# Most similar cases are cases that are similar on all the independent variables, except the one of interest to the researcher.
# Most different cases are cases that are different on all the independent variables, except the one of interest to the researcher.
For theoretical discovery, Jason Seawright recommends using deviant cases or extreme cases that have an extreme value on the X variable.

Arend Lijphart, and Harry Eckstein identified five types of case study research designs (depending on the research objectives), Alexander George and Andrew Bennett added a sixth category:

# Atheoretical (or configurative idiographic) case studies aim to describe a case very well, but not to contribute to a theory.
# Interpretative (or disciplined configurative) case studies aim to use established theories to explain a specific case.
# Hypothesis-generating (or heuristic) case studies aim to inductively identify new variables, hypotheses, causal mechanisms, and causal paths.
# Theory testing case studies aim to assess the validity and scope conditions of existing theories.
# Plausibility probes, aim to assess the plausibility of new hypotheses and theories.
# Building block studies of types or subtypes, aim to identify common patterns across cases.

Aaron Rapport reformulated &quot;least-likely&quot; and &quot;most-likely&quot; case selection strategies into the &quot;countervailing conditions&quot; case selection strategy. The countervailing conditions case selection strategy has three components:

# The chosen cases fall within the scope conditions of both the primary theory being tested and the competing alternative hypotheses.
# For the theories being tested, the analyst must derive clearly stated expected outcomes.
# In determining how difficult a test is, the analyst should identify the strength of countervailing conditions in the chosen cases.

In terms of case selection, Gary King, Robert Keohane, and Sidney Verba warn against &quot;selecting on the dependent variable&quot;. They argue for example that researchers cannot make valid causal inferences about war outbreaks by only looking at instances where war did happen (the researcher should also look at cases where war did not happen). Scholars of qualitative methods have disputed this claim, however. They argue that selecting the dependent variable can be useful depending on the purposes of the research. Barbara Geddes shares their concerns with selecting the dependent variable (she argues that it cannot be used for theory testing purposes), but she argues that selecting on the dependent variable can be useful for theory creation and theory modification.

King, Keohane, and Verba argue that there is no methodological problem in selecting the explanatory variable, however. They do warn about multicollinearity (choosing two or more explanatory variables that perfectly correlate with each other).

==Uses==
Case studies have commonly been seen as a fruitful way to come up with hypotheses and generate theories. Case studies are useful for understanding outliers or deviant cases. Classic examples of case studies that generated theories includes Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution (derived from his travels to the Easter Island), and Douglass North&#x27;s theories of economic development (derived from case studies of early developing states, such as England).

Case studies are also useful for formulating concepts, which are an important aspect of theory construction. The concepts used in qualitative research will tend to have higher conceptual validity than concepts used in quantitative research (due to conceptual stretching: the unintentional comparison of dissimilar cases). Case studies add descriptive richness, and can have greater internal validity than quantitative studies. Case studies are suited to explain outcomes in individual cases, which is something that quantitative methods are less equipped to do.

Case studies have been characterized as useful to assess the plausibility of arguments that explain empirical regularities. Case studies are also useful for understanding outliers or deviant cases.

Through fine-gained knowledge and description, case studies can fully specify the causal mechanisms in a way that may be harder in a large-N study. In terms of identifying &quot;causal mechanisms&quot;, some scholars distinguish between &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong chains&quot;. Strong chains actively connect elements of the causal chain to produce an outcome whereas weak chains are just intervening variables.

Case studies of cases that defy existing theoretical expectations may contribute knowledge by delineating why the cases violate theoretical predictions and specifying the scope conditions of the theory. Case studies are useful in situations of causal complexity where there may be equifinality, complex interaction effects and path dependency. They may also be more appropriate for empirical verifications of strategic interactions in rationalist scholarship than quantitative methods. Case studies can identify necessary and insufficient conditions, as well as complex combinations of necessary and sufficient conditions. They argue that case studies may also be useful in identifying the scope conditions of a theory: whether variables are sufficient or necessary to bring about an outcome.

Qualitative research may be necessary to determine whether a treatment is as-if random or not. As a consequence, good quantitative observational research often entails a qualitative component.

==Limitations==
&quot;Designing Social Inquiry&quot; (also called &quot;KKV&quot;), an influential 1994 book written by Gary King, Robert Keohane, and Sidney Verba, primarily applies lessons from regression-oriented analysis to qualitative research, arguing that the same logics of causal inference can be used in both types of research. The authors&#x27; recommendation is to increase the number of observations (a recommendation that Barbara Geddes also makes in &quot;Paradigms and Sand Castles&quot;), because few observations make it harder to estimate multiple causal effects, as well as increase the risk that there is measurement error, and that an event in a single case was caused by random error or unobservable factors. KKV sees process-tracing and qualitative research as being &quot;unable to yield strong causal inference&quot; because qualitative scholars would struggle with determining which of many intervening variables truly links the independent variable with a dependent variable. The primary problem is that qualitative research lacks a sufficient number of observations to properly estimate the effects of an independent variable. They write that the number of observations could be increased through various means, but that would simultaneously lead to another problem: that the number of variables would increase and thus reduce degrees of freedom. Christopher H. Achen and Duncan Snidal similarly argue that case studies are not useful for theory construction and theory testing.

The purported &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; problem that KKV identify is widely considered flawed; while quantitative scholars try to aggregate variables to reduce the number of variables and thus increase the degrees of freedom, qualitative scholars intentionally want their variables to have many different attributes and complexity. For example, James Mahoney writes, &quot;the Bayesian nature of process of tracing explains why it is inappropriate to view qualitative research as suffering from a small-N problem and certain standard causal identification problems.&quot; By using Bayesian probability, it may be possible to makes strong causal inferences from a small sliver of data.

KKV also identify inductive reasoning in qualitative research as a problem, arguing that scholars should not revise hypotheses during or after data has been collected because it allows for ad hoc theoretical adjustments to fit the collected data. However, scholars have pushed back on this claim, noting that inductive reasoning is a legitimate practice (both in qualitative and quantitative research).

A commonly described limit of case studies is that they do not lend themselves to generalizability. Due to the small number of cases, it may be harder to ensure that the chosen cases are representative of the larger population.

As small-N research should not rely on random sampling, scholars must be careful in avoiding selection bias when picking suitable cases. A common criticism of qualitative scholarship is that cases are chosen because they are consistent with the scholar&#x27;s preconceived notions, resulting in biased research. Alexander George and Andrew Bennett also note that a common problem in case study research is that of reconciling conflicting interpretations of the same data. Another limit of case study research is that it can be hard to estimate the magnitude of causal effects.

==Teaching case studies==
Teachers may prepare a case study that will then be used in classrooms in the form of a &quot;teaching&quot; case study (also see case method and casebook method). For instance, as early as 1870 at Harvard Law School, Christopher Langdell departed from the traditional lecture-and-notes approach to teaching contract law and began using cases pled before courts as the basis for class discussions. By 1920, this practice had become the dominant pedagogical approach used by law schools in the United States. 
Outside of law, teaching case studies have become popular in many different fields and professions, ranging from business education to science education. The Harvard Business School has been among the most prominent developers and users of teaching case studies. Teachers develop case studies with particular learning objectives in mind. Additional relevant documentation, such as financial statements, time-lines, short biographies, and multimedia supplements (such as video-recordings of interviews) often accompany the case studies. Similarly, teaching case studies have become increasingly popular in science education, covering different biological and physical sciences. The National Center for Case Studies in Teaching Science has made a growing body of teaching case studies available for classroom use, for university as well as secondary school coursework.

<doc id="304477" wikidata="Q333264" url="?curid=304477" title="Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury">
<text>Christopher Robert Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury, (born 24 July 1951) is a British politician and a peer; a former Member of Parliament (MP) and Cabinet Minister; and former chairman of the Environment Agency. For the majority of his career he was a Labour Party member. He was the first openly gay male British MP, coming out in 1984, and in 2005, the first MP to acknowledge that he is HIV positive. Since 2015 he has been Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge.

==Early life and education==
Chris Smith was born in Barnet, London, and educated at George Watson&#x27;s College in Edinburgh and Pembroke College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he gained a first class honours degree in English, and a PhD degree with a thesis on Coleridge and Wordsworth; he was also president of the Cambridge Union Society. Furthermore, he attended Harvard University as a Kennedy Scholar.

==Member of Parliament==
He worked for a housing charity and became a councillor in the London Borough of Islington. He came third at Epsom and Ewell in the 1979 general election before narrowly winning the seat of Islington South and Finsbury at the 1983 general election, defeating George Cunningham, who had ultimately defected to the Social Democrats from Labour. Cunningham stood again at the 1987 general election when Smith retained the seat.

In 1984, he became Britain&#x27;s first gay MP to choose to &quot;come out&quot;. There had been several gay MPs before this whose homosexuality had been common knowledge in some circles, including their constituents in some cases, but they had not been completely open about it. (In 1975 Maureen Colquhoun had been effectively &quot;outed&quot; by press revelations.) During a rally in Rugby, Warwickshire, against a possible ban on gay employees by the town council, Smith began his speech: &quot;Good afternoon, I&#x27;m Chris Smith, I&#x27;m the Labour MP for Islington South and Finsbury and I&#x27;m gay.&quot; This was unscripted, and the decision to include it in his speech was made at the last minute. He immediately received a standing ovation from most of the audience.

He became an opposition whip in 1986, a shadow Treasury minister from 1987 to 1992, and shadowed the environment, heritage, pensions and health portfolios between 1992 and 1997.

===Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport===
In 1997, he was appointed to Tony Blair&#x27;s Cabinet as the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. As a Minister known to have a close connection with the arts scene in Britain, his time at DCMS is generally regarded as a success, for many projects funded through the National Lottery came to fruition. There were controversies, such as his approval during his first week as minister of the appointment of Mary Allen to the Royal Opera House. In this case, a Select Committee report later found that he had exceeded his authority and had improperly failed to seek advice from his Permanent Secretary. In 2000, he managed to secure a tax rebate that enabled many museums to give free admission. 
He held this position throughout the Labour government&#x27;s first term, but was sacked and returned to the back benches after the 2001 election, being replaced by Tessa Jowell.

===Appointment to the House of Lords===
After over 20 years in Parliament, Smith stepped down from the House of Commons at the 2005 general election. It was announced on 30 April 2005 that he was to be created a life peer, and the title was gazetted on 22 June 2005 as Baron Smith of Finsbury, &quot;of Finsbury in the London Borough of Islington&quot;.

==Retirement from politics==
Smith was appointed Chair of the London Cultural Consortium (successor body to the Cultural Strategy Group) by Ken Livingstone, the then Mayor of London, and served from 2005 to 2008. He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship in 2010 from the University of Cumbria. In November 2006, he was appointed as Chairman of the Advertising Standards Authority. He was one of the founding directors of the Clore Leadership Programme, an initiative aimed at helping to train and develop new leaders of Britain&#x27;s cultural sector. He is also currently Chairman of the Wordsworth Trust.

Smith is a keen mountaineer, and was the first MP to climb all the 3,000 ft &quot;Munros&quot; in Scotland; in April 2004, he was elected President of the Ramblers&#x27; Association. He is a patron of London-based HIV charity The Food Chain, and also Patron of HIV support charity The National Long-Term Survivors Group (NLTSG). He is also an honorary life member of BAFTA.

Smith was announced as the new Chairman of the Environment Agency on 8 May 2008, and took up the new role in mid-July. In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; in August that year he said Britain faced hard choices over which coasts to defend and which to leave to the sea, because it would not be possible to save all coastal homes from sea erosion. Lord Smith was re-appointed as Chair of the Environment Agency for a further three years by Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman in 2011. On re-appointment he received £100,813 &quot;pro rata&quot; for 2011–12, based on working three days a week. Lord Smith continued in this role until 13 July 2014.

Smith became a vice-president of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality in February 2009.

In December 2014, it was announced that Lord Smith would become the next Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge in 2015, succeeding Sir Richard Dearlove. He oversaw the receipt of the biggest single donation ever received by the University of Cambridge in 2015, when Ray Dolby donated £35m towards an expansion of the College grounds. He accepted an invitation to become the Chairman of Trustees of the Cambridge Union Society in 2015.

He is currently listed as the Chairman of the Task Force on Shale Gas.

== Personal life ==
In 2006, Smith entered a civil partnership with Dorian Jabri, his partner since 1989. The couple separated in 2012. Smith was a director of the Finsbury-based world jazz ensemble Grand Union Orchestra for a period in the mid-1990s.

=== HIV status ===
In 2003, Smith was contacted by a reporter from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; asking for a comment on his health but declined, citing the Press Complaints Code. However, two years later, in 2005, he contacted the paper&#x27;s editor and revealed in a story, titled &quot;Why This is the Time to Break my HIV Silence&quot;, he had been diagnosed as HIV-positive as long ago as 1987. He stated he had decided to go public following Nelson Mandela&#x27;s announcement of his son&#x27;s death from AIDS.

== Legacy ==
In 2010, the LGBT+ Labour campaign fund Dorothy&#x27;s List was renamed the Chris Smith List in his honour.

<doc id="304483" wikidata="Q180764" url="?curid=304483" title="Edict of Milan">
<text>The Edict of Milan (; , &quot;Diatagma tōn Mediolanōn&quot;) was the February, AD 313 agreement to treat Christians benevolently within the Roman Empire. Western Roman Emperor Constantine I and Emperor Licinius, who controlled the Balkans, met in Mediolanum (modern-day Milan) and, among other things, agreed to change policies towards Christians following the edict of toleration issued by Emperor Galerius two years earlier in Serdica. The Edict of Milan gave Christianity legal status and a reprieve from persecution but did not make it the state church of the Roman Empire, which occurred in AD 380 with the Edict of Thessalonica, when Nicene Christianity received normative status.

The document is found in Lactantius&#x27;s &quot;De mortibus persecutorum&quot; and in Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s &quot;History of the Church&quot; with marked divergences between the two. Whether or not there was a formal &#x27;Edict of Milan&#x27;  is no longer really debated among scholars, who generally reject the story as it has come down in church history.

The version found in Lactantius is not in the form of an edict. It is a letter from Licinius to the governors of the provinces in the Eastern Empire that he had just conquered by defeating Maximinus later that same year and issued in Nicomedia.

==Background==
The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety &quot;(pietas)&quot; in maintaining good relations with the gods. The Romans were known for the great number of deities that they honored. The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula introduced some religious practices such as the cult of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks, adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. According to legends, most of Rome&#x27;s religious institutions could be traced to its founders; this archaic religion was the foundation of the &quot;mos maiorum&quot;, &quot;the way of the ancestors&quot; or simply &quot;tradition&quot;, viewed as central to Roman identity. Through and , the religions of other peoples incorporated into the Roman Empire co-existed within the Roman theological hierarchy.

The Judeo-Christian insistence on their god being the only God and in believing all other gods were false gods could not be fitted into the system. Their scruples prevented them swearing loyalty oaths directed at the emperor&#x27;s divinity. More particularly, the refusal of Christians to pay the Jewish tax was perceived as a threat not just to the state cult but to the state itself. That led to various forms of persecution. Emperor Decius (r. 249–251) issued edicts that imposed hard restrictions on Christians, a policy continued by his successor Valerian. With the accession of Gallienus (r. 253–268), the Church enjoyed a period of nearly 40 years with no official sanctions against Christians, which Eusebius described as the &quot;little&quot; peace of the Church. In 311, Galerius published an edict from Nicomedia that officially ended the persecutions.

== Edict of Toleration by Galerius ==

Since the fall of the Severan dynasty in AD 235, rivals for the imperial throne had bid for support by either favouring or persecuting Christians. The Edict of Toleration by Galerius had been issued by the emperor Galerius from Serdica and was posted at Nicomedia on 30 April 311. By its provisions, Christians who had &quot;followed such a caprice and had fallen into such a folly that they would not obey the institutes of antiquity&quot; were granted an indulgence.

== Text == 
The actual letters have never been retrieved. However, they are quoted at length in Lactantius&#x27;s &quot;On the Deaths of the Persecutors&quot; (&quot;De mortibus persecutorum&quot;), which gives the Latin text of both Galerius&#x27;s edict of toleration as posted at Nicomedia on 30 April 311 and of Licinius&#x27;s letter of toleration and restitution addressed to the governor of Bithynia and posted at Nicomedia on 13 June 313. The latter states:

Eusebius of Caesarea translated both documents into Greek in his &quot;History of the Church&quot; (&quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;). His version of the letter of Licinius must derive from a copy posted in the province of Palaestina Prima (probably at its capital, Caesarea) in the late summer or early autumn of 313, but the origin of his copy of Galerius&#x27;s edict of 311 is unknown since that does not seem to have been promulgated in Caesarea. In his description of the events in Milan in his &quot;Life of Constantine&quot;, Eusebius eliminated the role of Licinius, whom he portrayed as the evil foil to his hero Constantine.

The Edict of Milan was in effect directed against Maximinus Daza, the Caesar in the East who styled himself as Augustus. Having received Emperor Galerius&#x27;s instruction to repeal the persecution in 311, Maximinus had instructed his subordinates to desist, but he had not released Christians from prisons or virtual death sentences in the mines, as Constantine and Licinius had both done in the West.

After Galerius&#x27;s death, Maximinus was no longer constrained and enthusiastically took up renewed persecutions in the eastern territories under his control, encouraging petitions against Christians. One of those petitions, addressed not only to Maximinus but also to Constantine and Licinius, is preserved in a stone inscription at Arycanda in Lycia, and is a &quot;request that the Christians, who have long been disloyal and still persist in the same mischievous intent, should at last be put down and not be suffered by any absurd novelty to offend against the honour due to the gods.&quot;

The edict is popularly thought to concern only Christianity and even to make it the official religion of the Empire (which did not occur until the Edict of Thessalonica in 380). Indeed, the edict expressly grants religious liberty to Christians, who had been the object of special persecution, but also goes even further and grants liberty to all other religions:

Since Licinius composed the edict with the intent of publishing it in the east upon his hoped-for victory over Maximinus, it expresses the religious policy accepted by Licinius, a pagan, rather than that of Constantine, who was already a Christian. Constantine&#x27;s own policy went beyond merely tolerating Christianity. He tolerated paganism and other religions but actively promoted Christianity.

==Religious statement==
Although the Edict of Milan is commonly presented as Constantine&#x27;s first great act as a Christian emperor, it is disputed whether the Edict of Milan was an act of genuine faith. The document could be seen as Constantine&#x27;s first step in creating an alliance with the Christian God, whom he considered the strongest deity. At that time, he was concerned about social stability and the protection of the empire from the wrath of the Christian God: in this view, the edict could be a pragmatic political decision rather than a religious shift. However, the majority of historians believe that Constantine&#x27;s adoption of Christianity was genuine, and that the Edict of Milan was merely the first official act of Constantine as a dedicated Christian. This view is supported by Constantine&#x27;s ongoing favors on behalf of Christianity during the rest of his reign.

== Peace of the Church ==
Galerius&#x27;s earlier edict did nothing to restore the confiscated property of Christians. That was left to the Edict of Milan. Instructions were given for Christians&#x27; meeting places and other properties to be returned and compensation to be paid by the state to the current owners:

It directed the provincial magistrates to execute the order at once with all energy so that public order may be restored and the continuance of divine favour may &quot;preserve and prosper our successes together with the good of the state.&quot; Constantine ordered for the restitution to be at the expense of the state. For Christians, the immunities and guaranties contained in the act had most important results. For the first time, it became possible to observe publicly the liturgy in its fullness and to attempt seriously and earnestly to mould the life of the empire according to Christian ideals and standards. The joy of the Christians at this change in their public status is expressed by Eusebius in his &quot;Church History&quot; (X, ii).

This period of Church history is also known as the &quot;Peace of the Church&quot;. Eusebius says that it stated that &quot;it has pleased us to remove all conditions whatsoever.&quot; The edict further demanded that individual Romans right any wrongs towards Christians: &quot;...the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception.&quot; The exhortation to right historic wrongs may also reflect the leaders&#x27; desires to avoid unfavourable consequences such as social unrest and further conquests. Koszarycz says that Constantine was superstitious and believed in the existence of the non-Christian gods enough that they did not want to offset the balance of good and evil. It was believed that the sooner that balance was restored by the Romans establishing a state of justice with the Christians, the sooner the state would become stable.

The term &quot;Peace of the Church&quot; has sometimes been applied in Great Britain and Ireland to the ending of persecution that followed Catholic emancipation between 1778 and 1926. In Germany, it can refer to life after the Kulturkampf, which lasted from 1871 to 1878.

<doc id="304484" wikidata="Q1072060" url="?curid=304484" title="Chicago school (architecture)">
<text>The Chicago School refers to two architectural styles derived from the architecture of Chicago. In the history of architecture, the first Chicago School was a school of architects active in Chicago in the late 19th, and at the turn of the 20th century. They were among the first to promote the new technologies of steel-frame construction in commercial buildings, and developed a spatial aesthetic which co-evolved with, and then came to influence, parallel developments in European Modernism. Much of its early work is also known as Commercial Style.

A &quot;Second Chicago School&quot; with a modernist aesthetic emerged in the 1940s through 1970s, which pioneered new building technologies and structural systems, such as the tube-frame structure.

==First Chicago School==

While the term &quot;Chicago School&quot; is widely used to describe buildings constructed in the city during the 1880s and 1890s, this term has been disputed by scholars, in particular in reaction to Carl Condit&#x27;s 1952 book &quot;The Chicago School of Architecture&quot;. Historians such as H. Allen Brooks, Winston Weisman and Daniel Bluestone have pointed out that the phrase suggests a unified set of aesthetic or conceptual precepts, when, in fact, Chicago buildings of the era displayed a wide variety of styles and techniques. Contemporary publications used the phrase &quot;Commercial Style&quot; to describe the innovative tall buildings of the era, rather than proposing any sort of unified &quot;school.&quot;

Some of the distinguishing features of the Chicago School are the use of steel-frame buildings with masonry cladding (usually terra cotta), allowing large plate-glass window areas and limiting the amount of exterior ornamentation. Sometimes elements of neoclassical architecture are used in Chicago School skyscrapers. Many Chicago School skyscrapers contain the three parts of a classical column. The lowest floors functions as the base, the middle stories, usually with little ornamental detail, act as the shaft of the column, and the last floor or two, often capped with a cornice and often with more ornamental detail, represent the capital.

The &quot;Chicago window&quot; originated in this school. It is a three-part window consisting of a large fixed center panel flanked by two smaller double-hung sash windows. The arrangement of windows on the facade typically creates a grid pattern, with some projecting out from the facade forming bay windows. The Chicago window combined the functions of light-gathering and natural ventilation; a single central pane was usually fixed, while the two surrounding panes were operable. These windows were often deployed in bays, known as &quot;oriel windows&quot;, that projected out over the street.

Architects whose names are associated with the Chicago School include Henry Hobson Richardson, Dankmar Adler, Daniel Burnham, William Holabird, William LeBaron Jenney, Martin Roche, John Root, Solon S. Beman, and Louis Sullivan. Frank Lloyd Wright started in the firm of Adler and Sullivan but created his own Prairie Style of architecture.

The Home Insurance Building, which some regarded as the first skyscraper in the world, was built in Chicago in 1885 and was demolished in 1931.

==Second Chicago School==

In the 1940s, a &quot;Second Chicago School&quot; emerged from the work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and his efforts of education at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. Mies sought to concentrate on neutral architectural forms instead of historicist ones, and the standard Miesian building is characterized by the presence of large glass panels and the use of steel for vertical and horizontal members.

The Second Chicago School&#x27;s first and purest expression was the 860–880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments (1951) and their technological achievements. The structural engineer for the Lake Shore Drive Apartments project was Georgia Louise Harris Brown, who was the first African-American to receive an architecture degree from the University of Kansas, and second African-American woman to receive an architecture license in the United States.

Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, a Chicago-based architectural firm, was the first to erect buildings conforming to the features of the Second Chicago School. Myron Goldsmith, Bruce Graham, Walter Netsch, and Fazlur Khan were among its most influential architects. The Bangladeshi-born structural engineer Khan introduced a new structural system of framed tubes in skyscraper design and construction. The tube structure, formed by closely spaced interconnected exterior columns, resists &quot;lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation.&quot; About half the exterior surface is available for windows. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity. The first building to apply the tube-frame construction was the DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building, which Khan designed and was completed in Chicago by 1963. This laid the foundations for the tube structures of many other later skyscrapers, including his own John Hancock Center and Willis Tower.

Today, there are different styles of architecture all throughout the city, such as the Chicago School, neo-classical, art deco, modern, and postmodern.

<doc id="304487" wikidata="Q1381974" url="?curid=304487" title="Matthew Tindal">
<text>Matthew Tindal (1657 – 16 August 1733) was an eminent English deist author. His works, highly influential at the dawn of the Enlightenment, caused great controversy and challenged the Christian consensus of his time.

==Life==
Tindal was baptised on 12 May 1657 at Bere Ferrers in Devon, son of the Reverend John Tindal, who was rector of the parish, and his wife Anne Halse. Through his mother, he was a first cousin of Thomas Clifford, 1st Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, and therefore descended from the Clifford and Fortescue families.

Tindal studied arts and law at Lincoln College, Oxford, under the high churchman George Hickes, Dean of Worcester, and then at Exeter College, Oxford; in 1678 he was elected fellow of All Souls College. In a timely profession of faith, in 1685 he saw &quot;that upon his High Church notions a separation from the Church of Rome could not be justified,&quot; and accordingly he joined the latter. But discerning &quot;the absurdities of popery,&quot; he returned to the Church of England at Easter 1688.

Between the early 1690s and his death in 1733, Tindal made major contributions in various areas. As Deputy Judge Advocate of the Fleet he had a large influence on the case law on piracy, such as his contributions to the 1693–1694 trial of John Golden. His timely pamphlet on the freedom of the press was hugely influential in the ending of the legal requirement that all publications be licensed before being printed. His book &quot;Rights of the Christian Church&quot; had an immense impact on church/state relations and on the growth of freethinking. Tindal&#x27;s &quot;Christianity as old as the Creation&quot; (1730) was the ultimate statement of the deist understanding of Christianity and was highly influential in England and on the Continent.

==Works==
===Early works===
His early works were an &quot;Essay of Obedience to the Supreme Powers&quot; (1694); an &quot;Essay on the Power of the Magistrate and the Rights of Mankind in Matters of Religion&quot; (1697); and &quot;The Liberty of the Press&quot; (1698). The first of his two larger works, &quot;The Rights of the Christian Church asserted against the Romish and all other priests who claim an independent power over it, pt. i.&quot;, appeared anonymously in 1706 (2nd ed., 1706; 3rd, 1707; 4th, 1709). The book was regarded in its day as a forcible defence of the Erastian theory of the supremacy of the state over the Church, and at once provoked criticism and abuse.

After several attempts to proscribe the work had failed, a case against the author, publisher and printer succeeded on 14 December 1707, and another against a bookseller for selling a copy the next day. The prosecution did not prevent the issue of a fourth edition and gave the author the opportunity of issuing &quot;A Defence of the Rights of the Christian Church&quot;, in two parts (2nd ed., 1709). The book was, by order of the House of Commons, burned, along with Sacheverell&#x27;s sermon, by the common hangman (1710). It continued to be the subject of denunciation for years, and Tindal believed he was charged by Dr Gibson, bishop of London, in a &quot;Pastoral Letter&quot;, with having undermined religion and promoted atheism and infidelity — a charge to which he replied in the anonymous tract, &quot;An Address to the Inhabitants of London and Westminster&quot;, a second and larger edition of which appeared in 1730. In this tract he makes a valiant defence of the deists, and anticipates here and there his &quot;Christianity as Old as the Creation&quot;.

===&quot;Christianity as Old as the Creation&quot;===

&quot;Christianity as Old as the Creation; or, the Gospel a Republication of the Religion of Nature&quot; (London, 1730, 2nd ed., 1731; 3rd, 1732; 4th, 1733), came to be regarded as the &quot;Bible&quot; of deism. It was really only the first part of the whole work, and the second, though written and entrusted in manuscript to a friend, never saw the light. The work evoked many replies, of which the ablest were by James Foster (1730), John Conybeare (1732), John Leland (1733) and Bishop Butler (1736).

&quot;Christianity as Old as the Creation&quot; was translated into German by J. Lorenz Schmidt (1741), and from it dates the influence of English deism on German theology. Tindal had probably adopted the principles it expounds before he wrote his essay of 1697. He claimed the name of &quot;Christian deist&quot;, holding that true Christianity is identical with the eternal religion of nature.

Waring states that Tindal&#x27;s &quot;Christianity as Old as the Creation&quot; (1730) &quot;became, very soon after its publication, the focal center of the deist controversy. Because almost every argument, quotation, and issue raised for decades can be found here, the work is often termed &#x27;the deist&#x27;s Bible&#x27;.&quot;

Unlike the earlier system of Lord Herbert of Cherbury which relied on the notion of innate ideas, Tindal&#x27;s system was based on the empirical principles of Locke. It assumed the traditional deistic antitheses of external and internal, positive and natural, revelations and religions. It starts from the assumptions that true religion must, from the nature of God and things, be eternal, universal, simple and perfect; that this religion can consist of nothing but the simple and universal duties towards God and man, the first consisting in the fulfilment of the second—in other words, the practice of morality.

The author&#x27;s moral system, is essentially utilitarian. True revealed religion is simply a republication of the religion of nature or reason, and Christianity, if it is the perfect religion, can only be that republication, and must be as old as creation. The special mission of Christianity, therefore, is simply to deliver men from the superstition which had perverted the religion of nature. True Christianity must be a perfectly &quot;reasonable service,&quot; reason must be supreme, and the Scriptures as well as all religious doctrines must submit; only those writings can be regarded as divine Scripture which tend to the honour of God and the good of man.

Tindal&#x27;s &#x27;deist Bible&#x27; redefined the foundation of deist epistemology as knowledge based on experience or human reason. This effectively widened the gap between traditional Christians and what he called &quot;Christian deists&quot; since this new foundation required that revealed truth be validated through human reason. In &quot;Christianity as Old as the Creation&quot;, Tindal articulates many prominent facets of deism that have continued to characterize that belief through subsequent centuries unto the present day:

*He argues against special revelation: &quot;God designed all Mankind should at all times know, what he wills them to know, believe, profess, and practice; and has given them no other Means for this, but the Use of Reason.&quot;

<text>In art, watermedia is the general term for media that are distinguished from oil or other media by being diluted with water when used. Watermedia include watercolors, gouache and acrylic, amongst others. It is sometimes combined with other media, commonly collage.

There are some unusual examples of water media being diluted with Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, tequila and sweat instead of water, and painter Johnny O&#x27;Brady has &quot;added tea to [his] brush water&quot;.

There are several watermedia societies.

Watercolor

Watercolor painting allows artists to use many techniques, including wet-on-wet painting, in which the paint moves freely on wet paper. Another approach to watercolor painting is a wet-on-dry technique, which is when wet paint is applied to dry paper. Many artists use a few additional effects and methods for this painting medium: the dry-brush effect, edge darkening, intentional backgrounds, and flow patterns. Technology is even impacting modern watercolor with scientists attempting to create computers that are capable of making their watercolor paintings.

Watercolor painting has even been proven to help cancer patients. A study conducted by medical professionals from the Department of Medical Oncology of Akdeniz University and Medical Park Hospital in Turkey was created to determine if painting art therapy is effective in lowering levels of depression in cancer patients. Patients undergoing chemotherapy were split into a control and tested group. The tested group participated in the art therapy program and painted with watercolor paint during their treatment. Participants were given a questionnaire that evaluated their quality of life and depression levels before and after their treatments. Watercolor painting was found to boost the moods of patients significantly. Quality of life scores for patients who had painted increased while depression levels dropped dramatically compared to patients who did not participate in the art therapy program.

<text>Laurence Roderick Llewelyn-Bowen (born 11 March 1965) is an English interior designer and television personality best known for appearing on the BBC programme &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;.

==Name==
He is sometimes credited as &quot;Laurence Llewelyn&quot;, and the components of his name are sometimes misspelled as &quot;Lawrence&quot;. On &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;, he is occasionally jocularly styled &quot;Lord Laurence&quot;, a play on Laurence Olivier and Llewelyn-Bowen&#x27;s flamboyance.

==Early life and education==
Laurence Roderick Bowen was born in 1965 in Kensington, London, to parents Trefor Llewellyn Bowen and Patricia (née Wilks). His father, an orthopaedic surgeon at Harley Street and, under the NHS, at St James&#x27; Hospital, Balham, South London, died of leukaemia in 1974, aged 42, when Laurence was nine. He went to primary school at Julians, in Leigham Court Road, Streatham, where his favourite subject was art, especially needlework. His mother, a teacher, died in 2002. He has a brother called Edward and a sister called Frances. He is of Welsh descent.

According to his website, Llewelyn-Bowen was educated at Alleyn&#x27;s School in Dulwich and later graduated from the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts (which became a constituent college of the University of the Arts London) in 1986 with an unspecified Fine Art degree.

==Early career==
After graduating, Llewelyn-Bowen worked for the Harefield Group of Companies and the interior design firm Peter Leonard Associates. In 1989 he started his own design consultancy.

==Television ==
Llewelyn-Bowen presented the BBC and Channel 4 television series &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;.

On 14 April 2009 he presented a documentary on BBC One in the West region in which he went &quot;In Search of England&#x27;s Green &amp; Pleasant Land&quot;. The programme explored the threats to the rural way of life from urban creep and the loss of local services.

A study of Llewelyn-Bowen&#x27;s family tree featured in the BBC One show &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which was first aired on 29 September 2008. It showed that Llewelyn-Bowen&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family had a seafaring history.

Between 2009 and 2011 Llewelyn-Bowen appeared on every episode of the ITV show &quot;House Gift&quot;.

Llewelyn-Bowen appeared as a judge on the 2010 series of the ITV reality talent show &quot;Popstar to Operastar&quot; as a critic alongside Meat Loaf, and classically trained mentors Katherine Jenkins and Rolando Villazón. The series was hosted by Myleene Klass and Alan Titchmarsh.

The series was licensed to streaming service, Netflix, in the U.S. and rebranded as &quot;Hidden Houses&quot;, premiering on the service on 31 December 2016.

He features frequently in the BBC programme, &quot;DIY SOS: The Big Build&quot; as a designer.

In 2017, he joined Australia&#x27;s Seven Network reality renovation series &quot;House Rules&quot; as a new judge.

In 2025, Llewelyn-Bowen will be a contestant on Netflix&#x27;s reality competition television series, &quot;Celebrity Bear Hunt&quot;.
===&quot;Stepping Out&quot;===

==Radio==
In 2008 he began hosting a Sunday morning radio show &quot;The Sunday Spa&quot; on Classic FM.

==Early 2000s==
In 2002 Llewelyn-Bowen made a cameo appearance in the comedy series &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, in which he comes to decorate the garden of one of the characters. He acts as a depressed, smoking, and comically bald version of himself, and is killed by a collapsing wall.

In 2004 Llewelyn-Bowen designed the interior of the Inc Bar in Greenwich, England in a former 1830s music hall. The design features Larry&#x27;s Bar, named after Llewelyn-Bowen and &quot;the Divan&quot;, a dimly lit nook, a sort of make-out room.

He has also presented a three-part BBC special &quot;Taste&quot; (2002), about the history of interior design, and in autumn 2005 he began presenting the weekly BBC1 travel show &quot;Holiday 2006&quot;. His books include &quot;Fantasy Rooms: Inspirational Designs from the BBC Series&quot; (1999), &quot;Display&quot; (2001), &quot;&quot;Home Front&quot;: Inside Out&quot; (2002), &quot;Design Rules&quot; (2003) and &quot;A Pinch of Posh&quot; (2006) co-written with his wife, Jackie. He has also made a guest appearance on &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;&#x27; American counterpart, &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;.

In March 2005 he starred in a one-off mockumentary as a prospective candidate for Parliament. His party, the Purple Party, &quot;lobbied&quot; for a restoration of Britain&#x27;s heritage, and several extreme architectural measures such as tearing down all buildings that did not conform to their surroundings.

==&quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; controversy==

In January 2006, Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife Jackie were offered a place on the Valentine&#x27;s Day celebrity couples edition of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; They appeared on the show managing to reach the £1 million question, before answering it incorrectly and dropping from £500,000 down to £32,000 (a loss of £468,000). For the first time ever, Celador allowed Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife to retry the show after the company claimed that the last question &quot;didn&#x27;t meet their standards&quot;.

The original, allegedly misleading question was &quot;Translated from the Latin, what is the motto of the United States?&quot; The answer given was &quot;In God We Trust&quot; which is originally English and has in fact been the motto of the United States since 1956. The intended answer had been &quot;Out of Many, One&quot; which is a translation of the Latin phrase &quot;E pluribus unum&quot;, which is found on the Great Seal, however it is not actually the current United States motto. &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; had been the de facto motto but was never legally declared as such.

After returning and being shown a different £1 million question, the couple decided not to risk losing £468,000 for the second time and won £500,000 for their chosen charity, The Shooting Star Children&#x27;s Hospice, of which Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife are both patrons. This amount is the highest amount that any celebrity couple has won on any British edition of &quot;Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?&quot; Their new question was about the first man to travel to space twice, and the correct answer to the question was Gus Grissom.

==Work since 2007==

In 2007 he designed Decodance for Blackpool Illuminations, featuring six illuminated burlesque beauties.

In November 2007 he and his family were depicted in the Living TV series &quot;To the Manor Bowen&quot;. Llewelyn-Bowen designed a line of wallpaper in collaboration with the British Home Decor Company Graham &amp; Brown.

In 2008 he returned to Blackpool Illuminations to design Venus Reborn, a theatric tableau with a 15-minute show of sound, light and water effects.

In 2009 Llewelyn-Bowen released two ranges of papercrafting products in conjunction with Trimcraft, called Retro Rose and Venaissence.

Llewelyn-Bowen was the Creative Director For the 2010 Blackpool Illuminations, designing new illuminations including dinosaurs, vampires and ghouls.

Llewelyn-Bowen has been head judge on reality TV show &quot;The Apartment&quot; since 2012.

Llewelyn-Bowen was also a radio presenter for Classic FM until June 2015 when he was replaced by Alexander Armstrong.

In November 2014 he designed a Christmas attraction, &quot;Magical Journey&quot;, at the Belfry Golf Club near Sutton Coldfield, which was heavily criticised, receiving hundreds of complaints and the epithet &quot;Tragic Journey&quot; on its opening day; the event closed down in mid-December, and apologies were sent to ticket holders who were advised to contact their banks for refunds.

Since 2017 he has appeared on the Australian TV series &quot;House Rules&quot; in seasons 5–8 as one of three judges, co-starring with &quot;Home Beautiful&quot; editor in chief Wendy Moore, and award-winning Australian architect Drew Heath. In 2020, Moore and Heath were replaced by interior designer Kyly Clarke and builder Saul Myers.

In 2017, he was co-presenter alongside Neville Knott on the Irish TV3 lifestyle program &quot;Showhouse Showdown&quot; (Vision Independent Productions).

In 2019, he took part in the BBC series &quot;Celebrity Painting Challenge&quot; and he became a judge alongside Juliet Ashworth in the Australian programme Instant Hotel.

From 2019 to 2024, he appeared in a comedic advertising campaign for online bathroom retailer Victorian Plumbing in the UK.

Since 17 August 2021 he has re-appeared as resident designer on the reboot of the popular 90s makeover show Changing Rooms on Channel 4 with new host Anna Richardson. In 2022 he appeared in &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; as part of a group of celebrities with different religious affiliations who travelled in the footsteps of Saint Columba. Llewelyn-Bowen participated as a &quot;non-conforming pagan&quot;.

He switched on the Blackpool Illuminations on 2 September 2022 replacing Johnny Vegas who had to pull out at short notice.

==Personal life==
Until 2004 Llewelyn-Bowen lived in Kidbrooke, South East London. He, his wife Jackie and their two daughters, born 1995 and 1998, moved to a 17th-century, grade-II listed manor house in Siddington, a small village near Cirencester, Gloucestershire in April 2007.

He is related to Emanuel Bowen, map maker to King George II.

<text>Government House, colloquially known as Yarralumla, is the official residence of the governor-general of Australia. It is located in the suburb of Yarralumla in the Australian capital city of Canberra, in the Australian Capital Territory. The main residence is set amid of parkland. The house and its associated grounds were added to the Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.

At Government House, the governor-general of Australia presides over meetings of the Federal Executive Council, and holds investitures to present honours within the Order of Australia and associated Australian military, bravery and civil decorations. The governor-general also receives visiting heads of state and other dignitaries and the credentials of ambassadors to Australia, and entertains people from all walks of life.

==History==
American architect Walter Burley Griffin included provision for an impressive, purpose-built Government House in his plans for the modern city of Canberra. It was to be placed in a dedicated government precinct and provided with scenic views taking in Canberra&#x27;s landscaped open spaces and central lake; but, as with so much of Burley Griffin&#x27;s planning for the national capital, financial considerations intervened and the envisaged work never eventuated.

The core part of the current vice-regal structure began life as a double-gabled Victorian-era house, erected in 1891 by grazier Frederick Campbell at what was then the hub of a working sheep station. Previously, the site taken up by the present-day Government House was occupied by an elegant, Georgian-style homestead with shady verandahs on two sides, a shingle-clad roof and rows of French windows replete with shutters. The original single-storey homestead had been continuously occupied by the interrelated Murray and Gibbes families from 1837 through to the end of 1881.

===Private ownership===
Following the entry of European explorers into the Limestone Plains area, pastoralists followed during the 1820s, and Johnston and Taylor were the first to graze stock in the Yarralumla area. A grant of the land was made to Henry Donnison in 1828, but he soon sold it to William Dawes who in turn sold it to Francis Mowatt in 1832. Mowatt established an agricultural and dairying property and built a homestead. In 1837 Terence Aubrey Murray and Thomas Walker acquired the property. Walker subsequently left the partnership and Murray increased the size of Yarralumla. He held large grazing lands in the Lake George area and became a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the 1840s. As a member of the Legislative Assembly, Murray served as a minister in the New South Wales Government, and was appointed President of the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1862. Murray planted the Himalayan or Deodar Cedar at Yarralumla around 1840, and decorative shrubs and trees among the native eucalypts that dotted the homestead&#x27;s curtilage.

Augustus Onslow Manby &quot;Gussie&quot; Gibbes purchased the Yarralumla sheep station and its homestead from his brother-in-law, Sir Terence Aubrey Murray, on 1 July 1859 for approximately £20,000. &quot;Gussie&quot; Gibbes made improvements to the property and as well as running extensive flocks of sheep on the estate, he bred horses for the Indian market and collected land rents from tenant farmers.

Gussie Gibbes&#x27; health declined during the early 1880s. He sold his rural holdings and travelled overseas for an extended period with his niece and housekeeper, Leila Murray. On 8 November 1881, Frederick Campbell — who had been managing the neighbouring Duntroon sheep station for his uncle and aunt — purchased Yarralumla from his friend Gibbes for £40,000.

Unlike Gibbes, Campbell was a married man with a growing family that needed to be accommodated. He partially demolished the old Yarralumla homestead in 1890 and, the following year, finished building a three-storey, red-brick house on the site. In 1899, Campbell razed what was left of the original homestead, replacing it with a substantial brick extension to the main house. An impressive wooden shearing shed was also built by Campbell in the 1890s to service Yarralumla&#x27;s flocks of sheep. The shearing shed is situated near the banks of the Molonglo River, below the Scrivener Dam.

===Government House===

The Commonwealth Government bought the Yarralumla estate from Campbell in 1913. It decided to use Campbell&#x27;s vacated home as a temporary residence for the governor-general of Australia. Consequently, another three-storey block was erected behind the existing one and a new entrance hall was constructed on the southern frontage. A stable block was constructed to the west of the structure and cottages built for staff. For a period of time, the house was used as the residence of John Goodwin, the officer-in-charge of the Federal Capital Territory. Since the 1920s, the building has been extended and refurbished several more times, but the basic structure of the 1891 house can still be seen clearly when viewed from the south.

Lord Stonehaven was the first governor-general to live in the house, being in attendance at the opening of the new Provisional Parliament House (now Old Parliament House) in Canberra in 1927. Australian-born Sir Isaac Isaacs was the first governor-general to live at Government House for the entirety of his term. The house remained relatively small when compared to Government House in Melbourne, and successive governors-general and their wives complained about its inadequacies as a place for formal entertaining. Plans for a much grander — and permanent — vice-regal residence were never implemented as a consequence of the economic hardship caused by the Great Depression of the late 1920s and 1930s. The grave crisis posed to Australia&#x27;s security during the Second World War also halted further work.

Due to the First World War and the adverse post-war economic conditions that prevailed in its immediate wake, the federal government did not move to Canberra from Melbourne until 1927. It was only at this time that the governor-general began to use Yarralumla as his official seat, albeit on a limited basis at first. However, the Federal Cabinet did meet at Government House (then known as Yarralumla House) on 30 January 1924, on that occasion chaired by the acting Prime Minister, Earle Page. This was still three years before the opening of Parliament House and Canberra becoming the National Capital. Between 1927 and 1930 the governor-general continued to live principally at Melbourne&#x27;s Government House, residing at Yarralumla only during those periods of the year when the Parliament of Australia was sitting. In 1930, Melbourne&#x27;s Government House was finally returned to the Victorian State Government for use by the Governor of Victoria.

In 1927, the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth) stayed in the house when they visited Canberra to open the Provisional Parliament House. Prior to their arrival, extensive improvements were made to ensure that the building would provide a standard of accommodation appropriate for members of the royal family. These improvements were overseen by the then Commonwealth Architect, John Smith Murdoch. The interiors of the refurbished house, along with much of their furniture, were designed by Ruth Lane Poole, of the Federal Capital Commission. They are in keeping with the prevailing Inter-war Stripped Classical style, with more formal interiors provided for the official reception rooms, and a lighter scheme prevailing in the private residential rooms.

A private sitting room was built in 1933 at the request of Lady Isaacs over the south entrance porch, which looks south across the gardens to the Brindabella Ranges and the foothills of the Australian Alps beyond.

In 1939, Government House was again extensively renovated and expanded in the Inter-war Stripped Classical style typical of Canberra&#x27;s early public buildings, to a design by E. H. Henderson, Chief Architect of the Works and Services Branch of the Department of the Interior. Lord Gowrie lived in the residence at this time, and it was not regarded as being large enough to meet the demands made of it. The 1899 Campbell extension was therefore demolished and a new, more substantial replacement erected. The drawing room was made larger, while more bedrooms were installed on the second storey, and a &quot;state entrance&quot; built on the northern side. Further alterations to the existing building were also made, adding a nursery on the third-storey and extending the dining room.

All these changes to Yarralumla had been spurred by the impending appointment of Prince George, Duke of Kent as the next governor-general. He was due to succeed Lord Gowrie in early 1945. However, the Duke died in an aircraft crash in Scotland in 1942 while on active service in World War II, and his elder brother, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, was appointed in his place. The changes were completed in time for the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.

In the 1990s, a new chancery building, designed by Roger Pegrum in an Inter-war Stripped Classical design, was constructed to house the offices of the Official Secretary to the Governor-General and associated administrative staff.

==Grounds==

Government House is situated in the south-western part of Canberra, in the suburb of Yarralumla. It is located on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin on a north–south orientation and is reached by Dunrossil Drive — named after the only Australian governor-general to die in office, Lord Dunrossil. At the entrance to the grounds are iron gates, decorated with the Royal and Commonwealth coats of arms, and a gatekeeper&#x27;s cottage. The curving drive leads to the house through ornamental lawns and gardens.

=== Residence ===
Government House consists of a central brick block, erected by Frederick Campbell in 1890–1891 on the remnants of an 1830s homestead. The house was enlarged in 1899 and again during the 1920s. Further additions were made to it in the 1930s and 1940s. All of these structures were rendered with a layer of cement and painted cream. The roof tiles are green.

The &quot;State Entrance&quot; to Government House is located on its eastern facade, and is protected by a porte-cochère, within which there is a set of steps leading up to the main entry doors.

Running along the centre of the house is the wood-panelled &quot;State Entrance Hall&quot;, lined with Australian artworks and furniture, including a study by multiple Archibald Prize-winner Sir William Dargie for the &quot;Wattle Portrait&quot; of Queen Elizabeth II and a study for a portrait, again by Dargie, of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

Official ceremonies, such as the swearing-in of Cabinet ministers, the presentation of honours and the holding of receptions, take place in the drawing room, which is hung with paintings by Australian artists and contains examples of early Australian furniture.

The drawing room leads through to the private entrance, which is composed of a series of rooms leading from the south façade (with views of the Brindabella Ranges) through to the &quot;State Entrance Hall&quot;. Again, these rooms are hung with paintings by Australian artists and contain antique furniture and other items of interest.
The private entrance is only used by the monarch and the current prime minister. As such, an incoming prime minister enters through the state entrance to receive their commission while they leave through the private entrance. Conversely, where a prime minister comes to Government House to resign after losing an election or the leadership of their party, they enter through the private entrance and exit through the state entrance.

Beyond the private entrance are a morning room and a small dining room. This small dining room features a series of paintings by Australian indigenous artists. These rooms lead back to the &quot;State Entrance Hall&quot;.

On the lakefront side of the house is the &quot;State Dining Room&quot;. It features a large bay window overlooking Lake Burley Griffin, which leads out on to a terrace. Also on the ground floor, and commanding views of the lake, are the governor-general&#x27;s study, where the vice-regal incumbent works and receives visitors, and a sitting room with an attached vestibule which links with a number of offices and service rooms.

The upper floors of Government House contain the governor-general&#x27;s private residence and guest rooms.

The furnishings and decoration of Government House represent a wide spectrum of Australian artists and craftspeople, ranging from colonial times to the present day and expressing a rich variety of styles. It also houses a large collection of artworks by Australian indigenous artists. Cultural institutions including the National Gallery of Australia, the National Library of Australia and The Australiana Fund, have lent much of the furniture and art objects gracing the house.

Artists with works displayed in Government House include E. Phillips Fox, Tom Roberts, Sir Arthur Streeton, Sir William Dargie, Margaret Preston, Rupert Bunny, Nicholas Chevalier, William Beckwith McInnes, Elioth Gruner, Sir Lionel Lindsay, Sir Bertram Mackennal, Sir Hans Heysen, Lloyd Rees, Fred Williams, Arthur Boyd, Sir Sidney Nolan, Leonard French, Justin O&#x27;Brien, Ray Crooke, John Dowie, Johnny Warangkula Tjupurrula, Margaret Olley, Pro Hart, Yala Yala Gibbs Tjungarrayi, Charlie Tjararu Tjungarrayi and Paddy Japaljarri Sims.

=== Gardens ===
Extensive landscaped grounds surround the house. They were first devised and put in place by the horticulturalist Charles Weston. Many of the trees in the gardens have been planted by visiting dignitaries. The grounds include extensive plantations of trees and sweeping lawns, which provide vistas towards Black Mountain in the north and the Brindabella Ranges in the south.

The &quot;Wild Garden&quot; or &quot;English Garden&quot; was laid out by Lady Gowrie, and includes a memorial to Patrick Hore-Ruthven, the only surviving son of governor-general Lord and Lady Gowrie, who was killed in the Second World War. The design of this garden was influenced by the work of Edna Walling and Paul Sorenson. Other gardens have been laid out by successive governors-general and their spouses. The lakeside lawn and terraces, for instance, were developed at the time Lake Burley Griffin was filled with water in the early 1960s, during the vice-regal tenure of Lord De L&#x27;Isle. Further developments to the terraces were undertaken during the term of Sir Ninian Stephen in the 1980s.

A rhododendron grove was designed and planted in the 1970s by Otto Ruzicka, and is called the &quot;Hasluck Garden&quot; after governor-general Sir Paul and his vice-regal consort, Dame Alexandra Hasluck.

In addition, large numbers of bulbs were planted along the eastern side of the &quot;Vista Lawn&quot; to the south of the house in the 1990s at the suggestion of Dallas Hayden, wife of governor-general Bill Hayden. The Bravery Garden was established in the grounds of Government House, suggested by Sir William and Lady Deane and inspired by John Thurgar and Hedonna Thurgar, founders of the Australian Bravery Association. The garden displays different Australian civilian and military decorations, including the Victoria Cross, and the civilian equivalent, the Cross of Valour, all nestled in plantings of mostly Australian and New Zealand plants. In 2014 a hedge of &#x27;Gallipoli Centenary Rose&#x27; was planted. 

About south of the house there is a slight depression in Yarralumla&#x27;s &quot;Vista Lawn&quot;. It marks the location of a filled-in brick and cement vault which once contained the bodies of two of the property&#x27;s colonial-era inhabitants, Elizabeth Gibbes (-1874) and her husband, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787-1873). Originally, the subterranean vault was surrounded by a stand of yews and hawthorns. In 1880, the coffins containing the remains of the Colonel and Mrs Gibbes were removed from the vault by their son &quot;Gussie&quot; Gibbes and reinterred at St John the Baptist Church, Reid. In the same churchyard, just a few paces from the Gibbes&#x27; burial plot, lies the grave of Lord Dunrossil (1893-1961), Australia&#x27;s 14th governor-general, who died during his Yarralumla tenure.

==Cultural depictions==
The heritage-listed elm trees that line Dunrossil Drive inspired the symphonic poem &quot;Dunrossil Elms&quot; by Australian composer Alexander Voltz, which won the Symphonic Category of the 2024 George Enescu International Competition.

<doc id="304507" wikidata="Q2578020" url="?curid=304507" title="William Bellenden">
<text>William Bellenden (c. 1550c. 1633) was a Scottish classical scholar.

James I of England and Ireland; VI of Scotland appointed him &quot;magister libellorum supplicum&quot; or master of requests. King James is also said to have provided Bellenden with the means of living independently at Paris, where he became professor at the university, and advocate in the parliament.

==Works==
The first of the works by which he is known was published anonymously in 1608, with the title &quot;Ciceronis Princeps&quot;, a laborious compilation of all Cicero&#x27;s remarks on the origin and principles of regal government, digested and systematically arranged. In 1612 there appeared a similar work, devoted to the consideration of consular authority and the Roman senate, &quot;Ciceronis Consul, Senator, Senatusque Romanus&quot;. His third work, &quot;De Statu Prisci Orbis&quot;, 1615, is a good outline of general history. All three works were combined in a single large volume, entitled &quot;De Statu Libri Tres&quot;, 1615, which was first brought into due notice by Dr Samuel Parr, who, in 1787, published an edition with a preface, famous for the elegance of its Latinity, in which he eulogized Burke, Fox and Lord North as the &quot;three English luminaries.&quot;

The greatest of Bellenden&#x27;s works is the extensive treatise &quot;De Tribus Luminibus Romanorum&quot;, printed and published posthumously at Paris in 1633. The book is unfinished, and treats only of the first luminary, Cicero; the others intended were apparently Seneca and Pliny. It contains a most elaborate history of Rome and its institutions, drawn from Cicero, and thus forms a storehouse of all the historical notices contained in that voluminous author. It is said that nearly all the copies were lost on the passage to England. One of the few that survived was placed in the university library at Cambridge, and freely drawn upon by Conyers Middleton, the librarian, in his &quot;History of the Life of Cicero&quot;. Both Joseph Warton and Dr Parr accused Middleton of deliberate plagiarism, which was the more likely to have escaped detection owing to the small number of existing copies of Bellenden&#x27;s work.

<doc id="304513" wikidata="Q2521791" url="?curid=304513" title="Vibrating alert">
<text>A vibrating alert is a feature of communications devices to notify the user of an incoming connection or message. It is particularly common on mobile phones and pagers and usually supplements the ring tone. Most 21st-century mobile phones include a vibrating alert feature, as do smartwatches.

Vibrating alerts are primarily used when a user cannot hear the ringtone (a noisy environment or through hearing loss) or wants a more discreet notification (such as in a theatre). However, when a device is placed on a hard surface, the noise caused by a vibrating alert can often be as loud or louder than a ringtone. 

The vibrations are produced by an electronic component called a vibration motor (alternatively called a &quot;haptic actuator&quot;). This component typically consists of a small electric motor with an off-center weight fixed to its output shaft.

<text>Saverio Bettinelli (18 July 1718 – 13 September 1808) was an Italian Jesuit priest and writer. He became known as a polymath, dramatist, polemicist, poet, and literary critic. He was a friend of some of the leading authors of his times: Voltaire, Francesco Algarotti, Vincenzo Monti and Ippolito Pindemonte. Théodore Tronchin, Guillaume du Tillot, Melchiorre Cesarotti, Giacomo Filippo Durazzo, Pietro Verri, Giammaria Mazzucchelli and Francesco Maria Zanotti were among his correspondents.

==Life==
He was born at Mantua; there and later in Bologna, he studied under the Jesuits, till entering in novitiate in 1736, then formally consecrated as a priest in 1738.

He first taught literature from 1739 to 1744 at Brescia, where Cardinal Quirini, Count Federico Mazzuchelli, Count Duranti and other scholars, formed an illustrious academy. He next went to Bologna, to study divinity. There he was in contact with the circle including the poet Marini, Algarotti, and Zanotti. At the age of thirty he went to Venice, where he became professor of rhetoric. There he wrote the satirical poem &quot;Le raccolte&quot; (1751), in which he called for a reform of the Italian poetic tradition, aimed at both the literary elite and the public. The superintendence of the college of nobles at Parma was entrusted to him in 1751; and he had principal charge of the studies of poetry and history, and the entertainments of the theatre. He remained there eight years, visiting, at intervals, other cities of Italy, often on the affairs of his order.

In 1755-1758 he undertook a series of journeys. First travelling to Germany in 1755, proceeded as far as Strasbourg and Nancy. He returned to Italy as a tutor to the sons of the Prince of Hohenlohe. The year following, he journeyed again to France, along with the eldest of his pupils; and during this excursion he wrote his famous &quot;Lettere dieci di Virgilio agli Arcadi&quot;, which were published at Venice. Bettinelli was also a poet of arcadic verse, collected in his &quot;Versi sciolti&quot; of 1758 and inspired by Frugoni and Algarotti, and of some tragedies including &quot;Gionata&quot; (1774), &quot;Demetrio Poliorcete&quot; (1758), &quot;Serse&quot; (1764) that were put on for the jesuit theater. In 1758 he went to Lorraine, to the court of King Stanislaus, who sent him on a matter of business to visit Voltaire. He would also meet in France with Rousseau and Helvétius.

From Geneva he returned to Parma, where he arrived in 1759. He afterwards lived for some years at Verona and Modena, and he had just been appointed professor of rhetoric there, when, in 1773, the suppression of the Jesuit Order occurred in Italy, he had to abandon his teaching post at Modena, Bettinelli returned home, and resumed his literary labours with new ardor. The siege of Mantua by the French compelled him to leave the city, and he retired to Verona, where he formed an intimate friendship with the chevalier Ippolito Pindemonte.

His major works are the literary criticisms and observations of culture. In 1757, he penned a series of letters addressed to Virgil in which he criticized the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, and affirmed that &quot;Among the erudite books, only certain parts from the Divine Comedy should be included, and these would form no more than five cantos&quot; Voltaire was to praise his idiosyncratic opinions.

In 1766 he wrote &quot;Lettere inglesi&quot; where he proposes good taste in modern literature. In &quot;Dell&#x27;entusiasmo delle belle arti&quot; (&quot;On Enthusiasm in the Fine Arts&quot;, 1769), he exalts enthusiasm as a source of inspiration for fantasy in art according to a tendency that was pre-romantic. Among his main works is an influential sketch of the progress of literature, science, fine arts, industry, and customs in Italy, originally titled &quot;Risorgimento negli studi, nelle, Arti e ne&#x27; Costumi dopo di Mille&quot; (The Revival of Italy in Scholarship, Arts and Customs After 1000, 1773).

In 1797 Bettinelli returned to Mantua. Though nearly eighty years old, he resumed his labors and his customary manner of life. He undertook in 1799 a complete edition of his works, which was published at Venice in 24 vols. At this death at the age of 90 years, he still retained his gaiety and vivacity of mind.

<text>Joseph Fidler Walsh (born Joseph Woodward Fidler; November 20, 1947) is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Best known as a member of the rock band Eagles, his five-decade career includes solo work and stints in other bands: James Gang, Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band, and New Zealand&#x27;s Herbs. He was part of the supergroup The Best and had success as a solo artist and prolific session musician, appearing on other artists&#x27; recordings. In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him No. 54 on its list of &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

In the mid-1960s, after attending Kent State University, Walsh played with several local Ohio bands before reaching national fame with the James Gang, whose hit &quot;Funk #49&quot; showcased his skills. Roger Abramson signed the James Gang to BPI in Cleveland. After leaving the James Gang in 1972, Walsh formed Barnstorm with Joe Vitale and Kenny Passarelli. Though the band produced three albums, their work was marketed as Walsh solo projects. The last Barnstorm album, &quot;So What&quot; (1974), featured significant contributions from Eagles members.

At producer Bill Szymczyk&#x27;s suggestion, Walsh joined the Eagles in 1975 as guitarist and keyboardist, replacing founding member Bernie Leadon. His first album with them was &quot;Hotel California&quot;. In 1998, a &quot;Guitarist&quot; magazine reader&#x27;s poll named the solos by Walsh and Don Felder on &quot;Hotel California&quot; the best guitar solos ever. &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked it eighth in the Top 100 Guitar Solos. As a member of the Eagles, Walsh was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001. The Eagles are one of the most influential bands of the 1970s and remain one of the best-selling American bands in history. Walsh&#x27;s contributions to music have been praised by rock legends like Jimmy Page, George Harrison, Eric Clapton, and Pete Townshend.

Walsh has released 12 solo studio albums, six compilation albums, and two live albums. His solo hits include &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;, &quot;Life&#x27;s Been Good&quot;, &quot;All Night Long&quot;, &quot;A Life of Illusion&quot;, and &quot;Ordinary Average Guy&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Walsh was born on November 20, 1947, in Wichita, Kansas. His father, Lt. Robert Newton Fidler, was a pilot for the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star in the United States Air Force and died in a plane crash in Okinawa on July 22, 1949. Walsh&#x27;s mother, Helen, was a classically trained pianist of Scottish and German ancestry.

Walsh was adopted by his stepfather at the age of five and given his stepfather&#x27;s surname, but retained Fidler as his middle name. In the 1950s, it was common practice for children to take the name of their stepfather for Social Security, school registration, and health records. Walsh and his family lived in Columbus, Ohio, for a number of years during his youth. When he was twelve, his family moved to New York City. Later, Walsh moved to Montclair, New Jersey and attended Montclair High School, where he played oboe in the school band.

Walsh acquired his first guitar at the age of 10, and upon learning the Ventures&#x27; &quot;Walk Don&#x27;t Run&quot;, decided that he wanted to pursue a career as a guitarist. Inspired by the success of the Beatles, he replaced Bruce Hoffman as the bass player in the locally popular group the Nomads in Madison, New Jersey, beginning his career as a rock musician.

After high school, Walsh briefly attended Kent State University, where he spent time in various bands playing around the Cleveland, Ohio, area, including the Measles. The Measles recorded for Super K Productions&#x27; Ohio Express the songs &quot;I Find I Think of You&quot;, &quot;And It&#x27;s True&quot;, and &quot;Maybe&quot; (an instrumental version of &quot;And It&#x27;s True&quot;). He planned to major in English and minor in music. Walsh has also stated he was present during the Kent State massacre in 1970. Walsh commented in 2012: &quot;Being at the shootings really affected me profoundly. I decided that maybe I don&#x27;t need a degree that bad.&quot; After one term, he dropped out of college to pursue his musical career.

==Musical career==

===1965–1967: The Measles ===
The Measles, an Ohio garage bar band, were formed in 1965 by four Kent State University students, one of whom was Joe Walsh. Two tracks on the Ohio Express&#x27;s &quot;Beg Borrow and Steal&quot; album, &quot;I Find I Think Of You&quot; and &quot;And It&#x27;s True&quot; (both featuring Joe Walsh vocals), were actually recorded by the Measles, led by Walsh. Additionally, an instrumental version of &quot;And It&#x27;s True&quot; was recorded by the Measles, re-titled &quot;Maybe&quot; and released as the B-side of the &quot;Beg Borrow and Steal&quot; single.

===1968–1971: James Gang===

Around Christmas 1967, James Gang guitarist Glenn Schwartz, who turned out to be AWOL from the army and was breaking up with his wife, decided to leave the band to move to California, where he ended up forming the band Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. Days later, Walsh, a friend of Schwartz&#x27;s, knocked on Jim Fox&#x27;s door and asked to be given a tryout as Schwartz&#x27;s replacement. Walsh was accepted and the band continued as a five piece for a short time until Phil Giallombardo, who was still in high school at the time, left. Bill Jeric and Walsh worked together on guitar parts, but Jeric left as well in the spring of 1968. He was replaced by a returning Ronnie Silverman, who had been discharged from the military.

In May 1968, the group played a concert in Detroit at the Grande Ballroom, opening for Cream. At the last minute, Silverman told the others that he would not join them at the show. The band, desperately in need of the money, took to the stage as a trio. They liked their sound as a threesome and decided to remain that way.

In 1968, the band signed with manager Mark Barger, who was handling the career of fellow Ohio outfit the Lemon Pipers, who had just scored a big hit with &quot;Green Tambourine.&quot; Barger put the Gang in touch with ABC Records staff producer Bill Szymczyk, who signed them to ABC&#x27;s new Bluesway Records subsidiary in January 1969.

They released their debut album, &quot;Yer&#x27; Album&quot;, in 1969. In November 1969, bassist Tom Kriss decided he was no longer into the music and left to be replaced by Dale Peters, who was brought in from a group called the Case of E.T. Hooley. The addition of Peters created the most successful incarnation of the James Gang. Walsh proved to be the band&#x27;s star attraction, noted for his innovative rhythm playing and creative guitar riffs. In particular he was known for hot-wiring the pickups on his electric guitars to create his trademark &quot;attack&quot; sound. The James Gang had several minor hits and became an early album-oriented rock staple for the next two years. It was during 1969 that Walsh sold his Les Paul Guitar to Jimmy Page. Later in 1969, the group&#x27;s record producer, Szymczyk, arranged for the band to appear in the &quot;electric Western&quot; film &quot;Zachariah&quot;, with two James Gang songs, &quot;Laguna Salada&quot; and &quot;Country Fever&quot;, also being used. For the recording of these two songs, vocalist Kenny Weiss was brought in to allow Walsh to focus on his guitar playing; he was gone by the time the group arrived in Mexico to shoot their movie scenes. &quot;Laguna Salada&quot; and &quot;Country Fever&quot; later reappeared as bonus tracks on the 2000 re-release of &quot;The James Gang Greatest Hits&quot;.

Shortly before the release of their second album &quot;James Gang Rides Again&quot;, they opened a show for the Who in Pittsburgh. Their guitarist Pete Townshend met with the James Gang before they left, impressed enough to invite them on the Who&#x27;s subsequent European tour. When Walsh was asked about it, he said, &quot;Pete&#x27;s a very melodic player and so am I. He told me that he appreciated my playing. I was flattered beyond belief because I didn&#x27;t think I was that good.&quot;

The James Gang&#x27;s next two albums, &quot;James Gang Rides Again&quot; (1970) and &quot;Thirds&quot; (1971), produced such classics as &quot;Funk #49&quot; and &quot;Walk Away&quot;. The album &quot;James Gang Live at Carnegie Hall&quot; was Walsh&#x27;s last album with them, as he became dissatisfied with the band&#x27;s limitations.

The two remaining members, Peters and Fox, carried on with lead vocalist Roy Kenner and guitarist Domenic Troiano (both ex-members of the Canadian band Bush) for two albums, &quot;Straight Shooter&quot; and &quot;Passin&#x27; Thru&quot;, both released in 1972. But in recent interviews, Fox stated that things did not work out musically with Troiano as hoped, so Troiano left the band in 1973 and later, in late 1974, joined the Guess Who. Guitarist Tommy Bolin was then brought into the band, after being recommended by Walsh.

===1971–1975: Barnstorm===
In December 1971, after Walsh left the James Gang, Steve Marriott, frontman guitarist of Humble Pie, invited Joe to move to England and join his band, which Peter Frampton had left, but Walsh declined. Instead he moved to Colorado and formed a band called Barnstorm, with drummer and multi-instrumentalist Joe Vitale, and bassist Kenny Passarelli, although both of their albums credited Walsh as a solo artist. They started recording their debut album immediately after forming, but at the time there were only Walsh and Vitale on these sessions. Chuck Rainey did the first bass tracks on the album but these were soon replaced by Passarelli. Walsh and Barnstorm released their debut album, the eponymous &quot;Barnstorm&quot;, in October 1972. After taking a cue from Townshend, Walsh utilized the ARP Odyssey synthesizer to great effect on such songs as &quot;Mother Says&quot; and &quot;Here We Go&quot;. Walsh also experimented with acoustic guitar, slide guitar, effects pedals, fuzzbox, talk box, and keyboards as well as running his guitar straight into a Leslie speaker 122 to get swirly, organ-like guitar tones. The album was a critical success, but had only moderate commercial success. The follow-up, &quot;The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get&quot;, released in June 1973, was marketed under Walsh&#x27;s name (although officially a Barnstorm album) and was their commercial breakthrough. It peaked at No. 6 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The first and leading single, &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;, received heavy airplay and reached No. 23 on the US Top 40 chart. It featured new member, keyboardist Rocke Grace, and Walsh shared the vocals and songwriting with the other three members of the band. As a result, a variety of styles are explored on this album. There are elements of blues, jazz, folk, pop, and Caribbean music. In 1974, Barnstorm disbanded and Walsh continued as a solo artist.

In late 1974, Walsh played slide guitar on Vitale&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Roller Coaster Weekend&quot;. Walsh was taught the slide technique by Duane Allman, who played on Eric Clapton&#x27;s Layla of Derek and the Dominos.

Barnstorm&#x27;s last tour was in the spring of 1975, shortly after Joe joined Eagles.

===1975–1980: Eagles===
In 1975, Walsh was invited to join the Eagles as founding member Bernie Leadon&#x27;s replacement. There was some initial concern as to Walsh&#x27;s ability to fit in with the band, as he was considered far too &quot;wild&quot; for the Eagles, especially by their drummer and co-lead vocalist, Don Henley.

Released on December 8, 1976, &quot;Hotel California&quot; was the band&#x27;s fifth studio album and the first to feature Walsh. The album took a year and a half to complete, a process which, along with touring, drained the band.

The second single from the album was the eponymous title track, which topped the charts in May 1977 and became one of the Eagles&#x27; signature songs next to &quot;Take It Easy&quot; and &quot;Desperado&quot;. It features Henley on lead vocals, with a guitar duet performed by Felder and Walsh.

The hard rock &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot;, released on May 3, 1977, was based on a riff by Walsh. It reached No. 11 on the charts and helped establish Walsh&#x27;s position in the band.

&quot;Hotel California&quot; was the last album to feature founding member Randy Meisner, who abruptly left the band after the 1977 tour. He was replaced by the same musician who had succeeded him in Poco: Timothy B. Schmit.

In 1977, the band, minus Don Felder, performed instrumental work and backing vocals for Randy Newman&#x27;s album &quot;Little Criminals,&quot; including &quot;Short People&quot;, which has backing vocals by Frey and Schmit.

The Eagles went into the recording studio in 1977 to begin work on their next album, &quot;The Long Run.&quot; The album took two years to complete. &quot;The Long Run&quot; was released on September 24, 1979. Considered a disappointment by some music critics for failing to live up to &quot;Hotel California,&quot; it proved a huge commercial hit nonetheless; the album topped the charts and sold 7 million copies. In addition, it included three Top 10 singles—&quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;, the title track and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Tell You Why&quot;. &quot;In the City&quot; by Walsh also received considerable airplay. The band also recorded two Christmas songs during these sessions, &quot;Funky New Year&quot; and &quot;Please Come Home for Christmas&quot; which was released as a single in 1978 and reached No. 18 on the charts. In 1980, the band broke up.

===1973–2012: solo career===

Walsh has released twelve solo studio albums.

In December 1974, Walsh released his first solo album that was not considered a Barnstorm project, &quot;So What&quot;, which contained more introspective material such as &quot;Help Me Through the Night&quot; and &quot;Song for Emma&quot;, a tribute to Walsh&#x27;s daughter who had been killed in a car accident that April. On a few tracks, Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Randy Meisner of the Eagles contributed backing vocals.

In March 1976, Walsh released a live album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Argue with a Sick Mind&quot;, which also featured the Eagles.

As the Eagles struggled to record their follow-up to &quot;Hotel California&quot;, Walsh re-ignited his solo career with the critically well-received album, &quot;But Seriously, Folks...&quot; in May 1978. It contained the single &quot;Life&#x27;s Been Good&quot;, his comedic depiction of rock stardom, which peaked at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and remains to date his biggest solo hit. Walsh also contributed &quot;In the City&quot; to &quot;The Warriors&quot; soundtrack in 1979, a song penned and sung by Walsh that was later rerecorded for the Eagles&#x27; studio album, &quot;The Long Run&quot;.

Following the breakup of the Eagles in July 1980, Walsh continued to release solo albums throughout the 1980s, but sales did not meet the same level of his earlier successes.

&quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot; was Walsh&#x27;s first album since the demise of the Eagles, and it peaked at No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album only spawned one single, &quot;A Life of Illusion&quot;, which became one of Walsh&#x27;s most popular songs. The single also topped the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, in 1981.

&quot;A Life of Illusion&quot; was recorded in 1973 with Walsh&#x27;s first solo band Barnstorm but was not completed. The overdubs and final mixes were completed during the &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot; sessions and released on the album. The promotional video for the track shows the making of the album&#x27;s cover. This song also appeared in the opening credits of &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot; and appears as the first song on its soundtrack.

In May 1983, Walsh released &quot;You Bought It – You Name It&quot;; the album was received negatively by the majority of music critics, while other reviewers noted good points to the album. It was also not as successful as Walsh&#x27;s previous albums, peaking at No. 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Walsh found moderate success with the single &quot;Space Age Whiz Kids&quot;, about the pinnacle of the 1980s video arcade craze. The album contains hard rock songs such as &quot;I Can Play That Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and a cover of the Dick Haymes track, &quot;Love Letters&quot;. It also contains more introspective material such as &quot;Class of &#x27;65&quot;, and contains a song titled &quot;I.L.B.T.s&quot;, an acronym for &quot;I Like Big Tits&quot;.

Walsh&#x27;s new girlfriend Stevie Nicks was involved in his next album, &quot;The Confessor&quot;. Her old friend Keith Olsen was hired to produce the album and the musicians were prolific LA session musicians including Jim Keltner, Mike Porcaro, Waddy Wachtel, Randy Newman, Alan Pasqua, and many other musicians with whom Walsh had never worked.

In 1987, Walsh released his final solo album of the 1980s, &quot;Got Any Gum?&quot;, which was produced by Terry Manning, and features vocal contributions from JD Souther and Survivor&#x27;s lead vocalist Jimi Jamison, but the album was a commercial disappointment.

In 1991, &quot;Ordinary Average Guy&quot;, his ninth solo studio album, and its title track single, were released on the Epic label. The album features Ringo Starr, Jimi Jamison, and drummer Joe Vitale from Walsh&#x27;s former band Barnstorm. Vitale also sings the lead vocals on the final track of the album, &quot;School Days&quot;.

In 1992, Walsh released what appeared to be his final album (until 2012), &quot;Songs for a Dying Planet&quot;, his tenth solo studio album. Like its predecessor, it was released on the Epic label. Keen to re-establish himself after receiving some poor reviews for his previous album, Walsh enlisted his former producer Bill Szymczyk. His song &quot;Vote for Me&quot; was a minor success, peaking at No. 10 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

Walsh&#x27;s song &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; was released in 2012 and details his struggles with alcohol and drug abuse earlier in his career. The song appeared on Walsh&#x27;s album &quot;Analog Man&quot;, which was released on June 5, 2012. The album was co-produced by Jeff Lynne, with Tommy Lee James co-writing some of the album&#x27;s tracks.

===Eagles reunions with Walsh===

An Eagles country tribute album titled &quot;Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles&quot; was released in 1993, thirteen years after the split. Travis Tritt insisted on having the &quot;Long Run&quot;-era Eagles in his video for &quot;Take It Easy&quot; and they agreed. Following years of public speculation, the band formally reunited the following year. The lineup comprised the five &quot;Long Run&quot;-era members—Frey, Henley, Walsh, Felder, and Schmit—supplemented by Scott Crago (drums), John Corey (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), Timothy Drury (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), and Al Garth (saxophone, violin) on stage.

&quot;For the record, we never broke up, we just took a 14-year vacation&quot;, announced Frey at their first live performance in April 1994. The ensuing tour spawned a live album titled &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; (named for Henley&#x27;s recurring statement that the band would get back together &quot;when hell freezes over&quot;), which debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. It included four new studio songs, with &quot;Get Over It&quot; and &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive&quot; both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved as successful as the tour, selling 6 million copies in the U.S. The tour was interrupted in September 1994 because of Frey&#x27;s serious recurrence of diverticulitis, but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996.

In 1998, the Eagles, including Walsh, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For the induction ceremony, all seven Eagles members (Walsh along with Frey, Henley, Leadon, Meisner, Felder, and Schmit) played together for two songs, &quot;Take It Easy&quot; and &quot;Hotel California&quot;. Several subsequent reunion tours followed (without Leadon or Meisner), notable for their record-setting ticket prices.

The concert recordings were released on CD as part of the four-disc &quot;Selected Works: 1972–1999&quot; box set in November 2000. Along with the millennium concert, this set included the band&#x27;s hit singles, album tracks and outtakes from &quot;The Long Run&quot; sessions. &quot;Selected Works&quot; received platinum certification from the RIAA in 2002.

The lineup consisting of Walsh with Frey, Henley and Schmit toured beginning in 2001, and a greatest hits album including the entire Eagles career, &quot;The Very Best Of&quot;., was released in 2003. A live two-disc DVD, &quot;Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne,&quot; including Walsh and featuring two new songs: Frey&#x27;s &quot;No More Cloudy Days&quot; and Walsh&#x27;s &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; was released in 2005.

In 2007, the Eagles, including Walsh, released a single, &quot;How Long&quot;, written by JD Souther. Later that year, the Walsh-era Eagles released &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot;, their first album of all-new material since 1979. The album debuted at number 1 in the U.S., the UK, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Norway. It became their third studio album and seventh release overall to be certified at least seven times platinum by RIAA. The Eagles, including Walsh, began a world tour in support of &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot; in 2008.

===Other bands===
In late 1984, Walsh was contacted by Australian musician Paul Christie, the former bassist for Mondo Rock. Christie invited him to come to Australia to perform with the Party Boys, an all-star band with a floating membership of well-known Australian rock musicians, including the critically acclaimed guitarist Kevin Borich, with whom Walsh became good friends. Walsh accepted and performed with the Party Boys on their late-1984–early-1985 Australian tour and appeared on their live album, &quot;You Need Professional Help&quot;. He remained in Australia for some time after the tour, putting together the short-lived touring band &quot;Creatures From America&quot;, with Waddy Wachtel (guitar), Rick Rosas (bass guitar), and Australian drummer Richard Harvey (Divinyls, the Party Boys). In 1987, Walsh returned to the United States to work on his album &quot;Got Any Gum?&quot;, which was produced by Terry Manning and features vocal contributions from JD Souther and Survivor&#x27;s lead singer Jimi Jamison. After the album&#x27;s commercial disappointment, Walsh decided to return to Australia in 1989 to tour with another incarnation of the Party Boys. Walsh also toured with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band in 1989 and 1992, alternating a handful of his best-known songs with Starr&#x27;s and tunes by other members of the All-Starr Band. In 1989, Walsh recorded an &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; with the R&amp;B musician Dr. John. Also in 1989 Walsh filmed a live concert from the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles with Etta James and Albert Collins, called &quot;Jazzvisions: Jump the Blues Away&quot;.

While producing their &quot;Homegrown&quot; album in 1989, Walsh briefly joined New Zealand reggae band Herbs. Although he had left by the time of its 1990 release, he still appears as lead singer on two tracks, &quot;Up All Night&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;. The album includes the first recording of his &quot;Ordinary Average Guys&quot; (sung by late Herbs and Be Bop Deluxe bassist Charlie Tumahai), which subsequently became a solo hit for Walsh as &quot;Ordinary Average Guy&quot;.

In late 1990, Walsh was part of a band called the Best, along with keyboardist Keith Emerson, bassist John Entwistle, guitarist Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter and drummer Simon Phillips. The band performed several shows in Hawaii and Japan, with a live video resulting.

In 1993, Walsh teamed up with Glenn Frey for the &quot;Party of Two&quot; tour in the United States. Also in 1993, Walsh, Terry Reid, Nicky Hopkins, Rick Rosas, and Phil Jones put together an informal group called the Flew. They played one show at The Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. This was Nicky Hopkins&#x27; last public performance before his passing.

In 1996, James Gang did a reunion for President Bill Clinton. The band consisted of their &quot;classic&quot; lineup (Walsh, Peters, Fox); they performed at the Cleveland State University Convocation Center on November 4, 1996.

In 1998, ABC wanted to use a classic rock song rock for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; that year, so they asked Walsh to rewrite the lyrics to &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot; for the quarterback John Elway of the Denver Broncos. &quot;Rocky Mountain Elway&quot; was the new title of the song and Walsh appeared in a video that ABC showed on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

===2000s and 2010s===
In June 2004, Walsh performed at Eric Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads Guitar Festival in Dallas, Texas. He was also featured in September 2004 at the Strat Pack, a concert held in London, England, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar. In 2006, Walsh reunited with Jim Fox and Dale Peters of the James Gang for new recordings and a 15-date summer reunion tour. The tour lasted into the fall.

In 2008, Walsh appeared on the &quot;Carvin 60th Anniversary Celebration DVD&quot; as a celebrity endorser. In the recorded interview, he highly praised Carvin Guitars and claims that the bridge design is &quot;just like the first Les Paul models. I can&#x27;t even get Gibson to reissue it.&quot;

Kent State University awarded Walsh an honorary degree in music in December 2001. In May 2012, the Berklee College of Music awarded Walsh, along with other members of the Eagles, an honorary doctorate for his accomplishments in the field of music.

==Notable appearances==

In 1974, Walsh produced Dan Fogelberg&#x27;s &quot;Souvenirs&quot; album and played the guitar, electric guitar, 12 string guitar, ARP bass and provided backing vocals. He also contacted Graham Nash to sing harmony vocals on &quot;Part of the Plan&quot;, which helped send the album to No. 17 on the 1975 &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.

In 1973 Walsh supplied the slide guitar solo on Michael Stanley&#x27;s song &quot;Rosewood Bitters&quot;. Walsh later lifted part of that solo and used it prominently in the Eagles&#x27; hit &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot;.

In 1981, Walsh and former Barnstorm bandmate Joe Vitale went to work on old friend John Entwistle&#x27;s fifth solo album &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot;, whenever they were free to work on it. The album turned out to become John Entwistle&#x27;s best-charting solo album, with hit singles &quot;Talk Dirty&quot; and &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot;.

Walsh was a background musician (1st guitar solo) on Eagles bandmember Don Henley&#x27;s 1982 hit &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; (listed as such in the liner notes of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Still&quot; and &quot;Actual Miles: Henley&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;). Walsh has also contributed to albums by Ringo Starr; America; REO Speedwagon; Jay Ferguson; Andy Gibb; Wilson Phillips; Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer; and Steve Winwood; and to the Richard Marx hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Mean Nothing&quot;.

Walsh was a regular guest DJ on Los Angeles radio station KLOS during the mid-1980s. They had a Saturday evening feature, with celebrity guest-hosts taking over the microphone (Walsh was the guest host far more frequently than any other). He was also a frequent guest and guest-host of Detroit and Chicago radio personality Steve Dahl.

Onscreen, Walsh has appeared in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, &quot;Promised Land&quot;, &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, &quot;Duckman&quot;, &quot;MADtv&quot;, &quot;Live from Daryl&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;Rock the Cradle&quot;, &quot;Zachariah&quot;., and &quot;The Conners&quot;

In October 2004, Walsh undertook speaking engagements in New Zealand to warn against the dangers of substance abuse. He said the visit was a &quot;thank you&quot; to people who took him to Otatara Pa when he toured New Zealand with reggae band Herbs while under heavy alcohol and cocaine addictions in 1989, an experience he has cited as the beginning of a long journey back to good health. At Otatara Pa in 2004 Walsh said, &quot;This is a special place, and it is very special to me. It was here on a visit many years ago, up on the hills, that I had a moment of clarity. I don&#x27;t understand it, but I reconnected with my soul, and I remembered who I used to be. I admitted I had problems and I had to do something about it. It was the beginning of my recovery from my addiction to alcohol and drugs, and when I got back to America it gave me the courage to seek help.&quot;

On February 12, 2012, Walsh appeared on stage with Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Dave Grohl, and McCartney&#x27;s band at the Staples Center in Los Angeles to close out the Grammy Awards. Walsh also appeared on the 60th Episode of &quot;Live from Daryl&#x27;s House&quot; with Daryl Hall, which premiered on November 15, 2012.

On February 9, 2014, Walsh was featured in several songs on the CBS special &quot;The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to the Beatles&quot;.

In 2014, Walsh made a guest appearance on Foo Fighters&#x27; eighth studio album &quot;Sonic Highways&quot;.

On May 24, 2016, Walsh appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Voice&quot; in which he played slide guitar, talk box and performed Rocky Mountain Way with contestant Laith Al-Sall

 On September 3, 2022, Walsh appeared in London, with recently reunited James Gang, at the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium which was simulcasted live and worldwide on the web, television and streaming platforms; notably, on streaming service Paramount + which aired a live complete/full version of the 339 minute concert that was uncut without commercials. For their final song, Dave Grohl played with James Gang on &#x27;Funk #49&#x27; as a 2nd/backup drummer. Walsh sang lead vocals and played lead guitar (a PRS), including slide guitar, for 3 songs.

Walsh also appeared with the James Gang at the September 27, 2022, Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, near Los Angeles As in London, their three-song set consisted of &quot;Walk Away&quot;, &quot;The Bomber: Closet Queen / Boléro / Cast Your Fate to the Wind&quot; and &quot;Funk #49&quot; with Dave Grohl as the second drummer on the latter.

At the 2022 VetsAid benefit, Joe Walsh did double duty, performing a nine-song set with the James Gang then returning for a four-song finale backed by Nathan East, Joe Vitale and Tom Bukovac. Walsh was joined by Dave Grohl, who played guitar on &quot;Life&#x27;s Been Good.&quot; On &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;, Dave Grohl played drums, the Breeders sang backing vocals and Roy Orbison III, godson of Walsh and grandson of Roy Orbison, played guitar.

==Influences==
Walsh cites influences from rock and pop bands and guitarists, many of whom he has encountered on concert tours: Les Paul, Jimi Hendrix, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, Jeff Beck, the Beatles, Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin, Ritchie Blackmore and Deep Purple, Manfred Mann, Duane Allman and the Allman Brothers, Ronnie Wood and the Faces, Pete Townshend and the Who, and the Ventures. In turn, he has influenced Dan Fogelberg, Maroon 5, Kenny Chesney, Jonny Lang, Blitzen Trapper, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, and George Thorogood. Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band taught Walsh how to play the slide guitar.

==Public service==
Walsh is active in charity work and has performed in a number of concerts to raise money for charitable causes. He has also been a personal contributor to a number of charity causes including halfway houses for displaced adult women in Wichita, Kansas. Walsh funded the first talent-based scholarship at Kent State University in 2008.

Walsh&#x27;s love of Santa Cruz Island grew into a lifelong commitment to conserve the environment there, and he has been active in preserving the island&#x27;s parks. He is President of the Santa Cruz Island Foundation, and has served on the Foundation&#x27;s board since the 1980s.

Walsh had often joked about running for office, announcing a mock presidential campaign in 1980 and a vice presidential campaign in 1992. Walsh ran for President of the United States in 1980, promising to make &quot;Life&#x27;s Been Good&quot; the new national anthem if he won, and ran on a platform of &quot;Free Gas For Everyone&quot;. Though Walsh was only 32 at the time of the election and thus would not have met the 35-year-old requirement to actually assume office, he said that he wanted to raise public awareness of the election. In 1992 Walsh ran for vice president with Rev. Goat Carson under the slogan &quot;We Want Our Money Back!&quot;

In an interview to promote his album &quot;Analog Man&quot; in 2012, Walsh revealed he was considering a serious bid for political office. &quot;I think I would run seriously, and I think I would run for Congress&quot;, Walsh told WASH in Washington, D.C. &quot;The root of the problem is that Congress is so dysfunctional. We&#x27;re dead in the water until Congress gets to work and passes some new legislation to change things.&quot;

In 2017, Walsh contacted others in the music industry, including the Zac Brown Band, Gary Clark Jr., and Keith Urban, to try to organize and perform what became VetsAid – a concert series along the lines of Willie Nelson&#x27;s Farm Aid.

==Personal life==

 Walsh has been married five times. He was married briefly to Margie Walsh in the 1960s, to Stefany Rhodes from 1971 to 1978, to Juanita Boyer from 1980 to 1988, and to Denise Driscoll from 1999 to 2006. Walsh married Marjorie Bach (sister of Barbara Bach and sister-in-law of Ringo Starr) in Los Angeles on December 13, 2008. His sister-in-law Susan Walsh has been a missing person since 1996.

Walsh&#x27;s daughter Lucy Walsh is a musician who has worked with Ashlee Simpson and others. She released her debut solo album, &quot;Lost in the Lights&quot;, in 2007.

Walsh&#x27;s eldest daughter, Emma Kristen, was born on April 29, 1971, and died on April 1, 1974, just shy of 3 years of age from injuries in a car accident on her way to nursery school. Her story inspired the track &quot;Song for Emma&quot; on Walsh&#x27;s solo album &quot;So What&quot; released later that year. In her memory, he had a fountain and memorial plaque placed in a park in which she played, North Boulder Park in Boulder, Colorado. He has said that the album name &quot;So What&quot; was a result of Emma&#x27;s death, that nothing else seemed meaningful or important in the months that followed. The strain eventually contributed to Walsh&#x27;s divorce from his second wife Stefany. While touring with singer Stevie Nicks in 1984, Walsh took Nicks to the park&#x27;s fountain; this inspired Nicks to write &quot;Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You?&quot; on her 1985 album &quot;Rock A Little&quot;. Nicks told the UK&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2007 that Walsh had been &quot;the great love of my life.&quot; &quot;Joe and I broke up because of the coke&quot;, she elaborated to &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;He told my friend and singer Sharon &quot;[Celani]&quot;, &#x27;I&#x27;m leaving Stevie, because I&#x27;m afraid that one of us is going to die. And the other one won&#x27;t be able to save the other person, because our cocaine habit has become so over the top now that neither of us can live through this. So the only way to save both of us is for me to leave.&#x27;&quot;

===Neurodiversity===

Walsh has mentioned having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and Asperger syndrome.

===Alcohol and drug addiction===

Walsh admits to struggling with alcohol and drug addictions for most of his early career and has been in recovery since 1993. In 1989, while touring with New Zealand band Herbs, Walsh experienced an &quot;epiphany&quot; during a visit to Otatara Pa, an ancient Māori pā site in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region. In 2004, on a return visit to New Zealand, Walsh described the experience and hailed it as the beginning of his recovery from his addiction. Walsh related the story that in 1994, he woke up after blacking out on an airplane to Paris. When he arrived, he had his passport, but did not remember getting on the plane. That was his turning point, and he has been sober ever since.

===Amateur radio===

While living in New York City, Walsh began a lifelong interest in amateur radio. He holds an Amateur Extra Class Amateur Radio License, and his station callsign is WB6ACU. In 2006, he donated an autographed guitar to the ARRL in Newington, Connecticut, for its charity auction. He has also been involved with the group&#x27;s &quot;Big Project&quot;, which brings amateur radio into schools. Walsh has included Morse Code messages in his albums on two occasions: on the album &quot;Barnstorm&quot;, (&quot;Register and Vote&quot;); and on &quot;Songs for a Dying Planet&quot;, (&quot;Register and Vote for Me&quot;). Walsh provides the theme song (which includes Morse code) for the TWiT podcast Ham Nation (debuting in 2011), and he appeared as a guest in the first podcast, as well as episode 400.

==Instruments==
Jimmy Page&#x27;s sunburst 1959 Gibson Les Paul, better known as his &quot;Number 1&quot;, was originally Walsh&#x27;s; Walsh sold it to Page in 1969.

In 1970, Walsh gave a 1959 Gretsch 6120 to the Who&#x27;s lead guitarist Pete Townshend. Townshend used the Gretsch in the studio to record tracks on albums such as &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;.

<doc id="304519" wikidata="Q3883891" url="?curid=304519" title="Verismo">
<text>In opera, , from , meaning &#x27;true&#x27;, was a post-Romantic operatic tradition associated with Italian composers such as Pietro Mascagni, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Umberto Giordano, Francesco Cilea and Giacomo Puccini.

&quot;Verismo&quot; as an operatic genre had its origins in an Italian literary movement of the same name. This was in turn related to the international literary movement of naturalism as practised by Émile Zola and others. Like naturalism, the &quot;verismo&quot; literary movement sought to portray the world with greater realism. In so doing, Italian &quot;verismo&quot; authors such as Giovanni Verga wrote about subject matter, such as the lives of the poor, that had not generally been seen as a fit subject for literature.

== History ==
A short story by Verga called &quot;&quot; (), then developed into a play by the same author, became the source for what is usually considered to be the first &quot;verismo&quot; opera: &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; by Mascagni, which premiered on 17 May 1890 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. Thus begun, the operatic genre of &quot;verismo&quot; produced a handful of notable works such as &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, which premiered at Teatro Dal Verme in Milan on 21 May 1892, and Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; (premiering at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900). The genre peaked in the early 1900s, and lingered into the 1920s.

== Characteristics ==
In terms of subject matter, generally &quot;[v]erismo operas focused not on gods, mythological figures, or kings and queens, but on the average contemporary man and woman and their problems, generally of a sexual, romantic, or violent nature.&quot; However, three of the small handful of &quot;verismo&quot; operas still performed today take historical subjects: Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; and Cilea&#x27;s &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;. In &quot;Opera After the Zero Hour: The Problem of Tradition and the Possibility of Renewal in Postwar West Germany,&quot; the music historian Emily Richmond Pollock writes that verismo&#x27;s musical language reflects an aesthetic that emphasizes &quot;the power of moment-by-moment emotional expressiveness that requires harmonic and formal flexibility, muscular but relatively unornamented vocal lines, and a fully developed orchestration full of high-contrast timbres.&quot; &quot;Musically, verismo composers consciously strove for the integration of the opera&#x27;s underlying drama with its music.&quot; These composers abandoned the &quot;recitative and set-piece structure&quot; of earlier Italian opera. Instead, the operas were &quot;through-composed,&quot; with few breaks in a seamlessly integrated sung text. While &quot;verismo&quot; operas may contain arias that can be sung as stand-alone pieces, they are generally written to arise naturally from their dramatic surroundings, and their structure is variable, being based on text that usually does not follow a regular strophic format.

== Works ==
The most famous composers who created works in the &quot;verismo&quot; style were Giacomo Puccini, Pietro Mascagni, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Umberto Giordano and Francesco Cilea. There were, however, many other &quot;veristi&quot;: Franco Alfano, Alfredo Catalani, Gustave Charpentier (&quot;Louise&quot;), Eugen d&#x27;Albert (&quot;Tiefland&quot;), Ignatz Waghalter (&quot;Der Teufelsweg&quot; and &quot;Jugend&quot;), Alberto Franchetti, Franco Leoni, Jules Massenet (&quot;La Navarraise&quot;), Licinio Refice, Spyridon Samaras, Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari (&quot;I gioielli della Madonna&quot;), and Riccardo Zandonai.

== Style confusion ==
There has long been some confusion over the meaning of the term &quot;verismo&quot;. In addition to referring to operas written in a realistic style, &quot;verismo&quot; may also be used more broadly to refer to the entire output of the composers of the &quot;giovane scuola&quot; (&quot;young school&quot;), the generation of Italian composers who were active during the period that the &quot;verismo&quot; style was created. One author (Alan Mallach) has proposed the term &quot;plebeian opera&quot; to refer to operas that adhere to the contemporary and realistic subject matter for which the term &quot;verismo&quot; was originally coined. At the same time, Mallach questions the value of using a term such as &quot;verismo&quot;, which is supposedly descriptive of the subject and style of works, simply to identify an entire generation&#x27;s music-dramatic output. For most of the composers associated with &quot;verismo&quot;, traditionally veristic subjects accounted for only some of their operas. For instance, Mascagni wrote a pastoral comedy (&quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot;), a symbolist work set in Japan (&quot;Iris&quot;), and a couple of medieval romances (&quot;Isabeau&quot; and &quot;Parisina&quot;). These works are far from typical &quot;verismo&quot; subject matter, yet they are written in the same general musical style as his more quintessential veristic subjects. In addition, there is disagreement among musicologists as to which operas are &quot;verismo&quot; operas, and which are not. (Non-Italian operas are generally excluded). Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, Cilea&#x27;s &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;, Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, and Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Il tabarro&quot; are operas to which the term &quot;verismo&quot; is applied with little or no dispute. The term is sometimes also applied to Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;. Because only four &quot;verismo&quot; works not by Puccini continue to appear regularly on stage (the aforementioned &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; and &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;), Puccini&#x27;s contribution has had lasting significance to the genre.

Some authors have attempted to trace the origins of &quot;verismo&quot; opera to works that preceded &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, such as Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, or Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;. In fact, much of Verdi’s style is accredited with influencing verismo-style opera. His use of suspense is reflective of a move towards greater intensity at the climax of arias. Modest Moussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; should not be ignored as an antecedent of &quot;verismo&quot;, especially because of Moussorgsky&#x27;s focus on peasants, alongside princes and other aristocracy and church leaders, and his deliberate relating of the natural speech inflexions of the libretto to the rhythms of the sung music, different from, for example, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s use of Pushkin&#x27;s verse as a libretto.

==&quot;Verismo&quot; singers==
The &quot;verismo&quot; opera style featured music that showed signs of more declamatory singing, in contrast to the traditional tenets of elegant, 19th-century bel canto singing that had preceded the movement, which were purely based on markings in the written music of authors preceding this &quot;era&quot;. Opera singers adapted to the demands of the &quot;new&quot; style. The most extreme exponents of &quot;verismo&quot; vocalism sang habitually in a vociferous fashion, were focusing on the passionate aspect of music. They would &#x27;beef up&#x27; the timbre of their voices, use greater amounts of vocal fold mass on their top notes, and often employ a conspicuous vibrato in order to accentuate the emotionalism of their ardent interpretations.

Some prominent practitioners of &quot;verismo&quot; singing during the movement&#x27;s Italian lifespan (1890 to circa 1930) include the sopranos Eugenia Burzio, Lina Bruna Rasa and Bianca Scacciati, the tenors Aureliano Pertile, Cesar Vezzani and Amadeo Bassi, and the baritones Mario Sammarco and Eugenio Giraldoni. Their method of singing can be sampled on numerous 78-rpm gramophone recordings.

Great early-20th century international operatic stars Enrico Caruso, Rosa Ponselle and Titta Ruffo developed vocal techniques which harmoniously managed to combine fundamental bel canto precepts with a more &#x27;modern&#x27;, straightforward mode of ripe-toned singing when delivering &quot;verismo&quot; music, and their example has influenced operatic performers down to this day (see Scott ).

<text>Carlo Innocenzo Frugoni (21 November 1692 – 20 December 1768) was an Italian poet and librettist. As a poet Frugoni was one of the best of the school of the Arcadian Academy, and his lyrics and pastorals had great facility and elegance. His collected works were published at Parma in 10 volumes in 1799, and a more complete edition appeared at Lucca in the same year in 15 volumes.

==Biography==
Born at Genoa, he was originally destined for the church and at the age of fifteen, against his will, was shut up in a convent. In the following year he was forced to make monastic vows, but had no liking for this life. He acquired considerable reputation as an elegant writer both of Latin and Italian prose and verse; and from 1716 to 1724 he filled the chairs of rhetoric at Brescia, Rome, Genoa, Bologna and Modena successively, attracting by his brilliant fluency a large number of students at each university.

Through Cardinal Bentivoglio he was recommended to Antonio Francesco Farnese, Duke of Parma, who appointed him his poet laureate; and he remained at the court of Parma until Antonio&#x27;s death, after which he returned to Genoa. Shortly afterwards, through Bentivoglio&#x27;s influence, he obtained from the pope the remission of his monastic vows, and succeeded in recovering a portion of his paternal inheritance. After the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle he returned to the court of Parma, and there devoted the later years of his life chiefly to poetical composition.

He corresponded with Francesco Algarotti during the genesis of Jean Racine&#x27;s dramatic tragedy entitled &quot;Phèdre&quot; into &quot;Ippolito ed Aricia&quot; an opera by Tommaso Traetta. Among his pupils was the abate Marco Cappello, who wrote mainly burlesque poetry.

<text>Guido Bentivoglio d&#x27;Aragona (4 October 15797 September 1644) was an Italian cardinal, statesman and historian.

==Early years==
A member of the Ferrara branch of the influential Bentivoglio family of Bologna, he was the younger son of marchese Cornelio Bentivoglio and Isabella Bendidio. After studying at the universities of Ferrara and Padua, where in 1598 he received a doctorate &quot;utroque jure&quot;— in both civil and canon law— he returned to Ferrara, to the humanistic studies that honed his elegant writing style. There Pope Clement VIII, on a visit to the city that had recently fallen under direct papal control, made him his private chamberlain, and he returned with Clement to Rome.

==Nuncio in Brussels and Paris==
Under Clement&#x27;s successor, Pope Paul V, he was appointed titular archbishop of Rhodes, 14 May 1607, with a dispensation for being three months shy of the canonical age and not having yet received the sacred orders, in order to give him appropriate credentials as nuncio at the court of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella in the Habsburg Netherlands, (1 June 160724 October 1615).

He arrived in Brussels when negotiations between the Habsburgs and the Dutch Republic to end the Eighty Years&#x27; War were about to begin. Following the conclusion of the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce in April 1609, he was greatly concerned with the position of Catholicism in the Republic. Accredited to a Habsburg court, he likewise took a keen interest in the final stages of the reign and the succession of Emperor Rudolf II. 
Three more topics occupied a great deal of his time: the struggle over the Jülich-Cleves inheritance, which was set to ignite the Thirty Years War, the flight of the prince de Condé from France in objection to Henri IV&#x27;s divorce and remarriage, and the degree of toleration for Catholics in England and Ireland under James I. His correspondence reveals Bentivoglio as &quot;the skilled diplomatist, polished by constant intercourse with the most refined society, as well as the observer,&quot; according to Ludwig Pastor.

Afterwards he was nuncio to the Court of France (9 July 16161621), where he witnessed the uproars of the Regency of Queen Marie de&#x27; Medici, the fall of Concino Concini in the coup operated by Louis XIII and his favorite Charles d&#x27;Albert, the discord between the Queen-Mother and her son and the first Huguenot rebellions. The King rewarded his services as nuncio with the appointment on 11 July 1622 to the bishopric of Riez, a position from which Bentivoglio would resign on 16 October 1625.

==Cardinal in Rome==
In accordance to custom, Bentivoglio was made a cardinal on 11 January 1621 at the end of his mission at the Court of France. His first titular church was the San Giovanni a Porta Latina (installed 17 May 1621). He subsequently switched to the Santa Maria del Popolo (installed 26 October 1622), the Santa Prassede (installed 7 May 1635) and the Santa Maria in Trastevere (installed 28 March 1639). On 1 July 1641, his intimate friend, Pope Urban VIII appointed him to the suburbicarian see of Palestrina. Until his nomination to the order of cardinal-bishops, Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu had entrusted him with the post of Cardinal protector of France.

On 22 June 1633, Cardinal Bentivoglio was one of the signers of the papal condemnation of Galileo. An able writer and skilful diplomat, Bentivoglio was marked out as Urban&#x27;s successor, but he died suddenly after the opening of the 1644 Papal conclave. He is buried in the church of San Silvestro al Quirinale, Rome.

==Patron of the arts==
Bentivoglio took Girolamo Frescobaldi with him to Brussels as his household composer.

On his return to Rome in 1621 Bentivoglio bought Cardinal Scipione Borghese&#x27;s new palazzo on the Quirinale. Filippo Baldinucci, the biographer of Claude Lorrain, asserts that Cardinal Bentivoglio launched the artist&#x27;s career by purchasing two landscapes by him, which brought the artist to the attention of Urban VIII.

He commissioned his portrait from Anthony van Dyck (&quot;illustration&quot;). His portrait bust was sculpted by François Duquesnoy &quot;Il Fiammingo&quot;, a Flemish sculptor active in Rome.

<text>José Gregorio Hernández Cisneros OFS (; 26 October 1864 – 29 June 1919) was a Venezuelan physician. Born in Isnotú, Trujillo State, he became a highly renowned doctor, more so after his death. He was beatified by the Catholic Church in 2021, and his canonization was announced in early 2025.

== Early life and education ==
José Gregorio Hernández Cisneros was born on 26 October 1864 in Isnotú, a small village in the state of Trujillo in Venezuela.

He spent the entirety of his childhood in his hometown, where his mother worked as a housekeeper and his father sold pharmaceuticals and livestock. Hernández was baptised on 30 January 1865 in what is now the parish Church of Niño Jesús de Escuque. He received the sacrament of Confirmation on 6 December 1867 from Juan Bonet, Bishop of Mérida.

At the age of thirteen, José Gregorio told his parents of his desire to go to law school and become a lawyer, but was persuaded by his mother to pursue a career in medicine instead. So, in 1878, he set off on the long and difficult journey from the Andes Mountain Range in Trujillo to Caracas. He enrolled in &quot;Colegio Villegas&quot;, one of the country&#x27;s most prestigious schools at the time, where, in 1882, he graduated with a baccalaureate in philosophy. 

After completing his high school education, Hernández enrolled in the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas to begin his medical studies. Throughout his six years at the university, he was described by his professors as a student of outstanding academic performance and conduct.

== Career ==
In 1888 Hernández graduated as a medical doctor at the Central University of Venezuela. The Venezuelan government awarded him a grant to continue his studies in Europe. Hernández traveled to Paris, where he studied other fields of medicine such as: bacteriology, pathology, microbiology, histology, and physiology. Following his return to Venezuela, he became a leading doctor at the &quot;Hospital José María Vargas&quot;.

Between 1891 and 1916, Hernández dedicated himself to teaching, to medicine, and to religious practice. He made two attempts to begin studies for the priesthood, but his fragile physical conditions would ultimately stand in his way. In 1908, he studied for ten months at the Monastery of Lucca in Italy. Then, in 1913, in a further attempt, he enrolled at the Pontifical Latin American College in Rome, but again for health problems obliged him to return to Venezuela. Hernández treated the poor for free and even bought them medicines with his own money. Among his scientific publications are &quot;The Elements of Bacteriology&quot; (1906), &quot;About the Angina Pectoris of Malaric Origin&quot; (1909) and &quot;The Elements of Philosophy&quot; (1912).

With the arrival in 1918 of the highly contagious Spanish flu in Venezuela, Hernández treated patients in Caracas who had caught it. Hernández died in 1919, after being struck by a motorist.

His major relics are venerated in the &quot;La Candelaria&quot; Catholic Church in Caracas.

== Beatification ==
After his death, Hernández&#x27; fame began to spread. Claims were made around the country that miracles had been experienced in cases where his intercession before God had been invoked. Eventually, his name became known all over Latin America and Spain. His healing help is often invoked by both doctors and patients. He is also called upon for protection during overland journeys.

In 1949, Venezuelan Catholic Church officials began the process of determining whether or not Hernández was eligible for sainthood. In 1985 the Holy See granted him the title of &quot;Venerable&quot;. The next step in the process for Hernández was that of beatification. 

On 26 August 2014, the Catholic Bishops Conference of Venezuela called on all Catholics to attend Mass and thank God &quot;for the life and example of this great Venezuelan, with great hope and implore the grace of his speedy beatification&quot; on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Hernández&#x27; birth (Sunday, 26 October 2014).

In June 2020, Pope Francis decided in favor of the beatification of José Gregorio Hernández, after the recovery of a girl who had been shot in the head, had been recognized as a miracle attributed to him. The solemn proclamation was made at a Mass celebrated on 30 April 2021 in the church of the Collegio La Salle of Caracas by the apostolic nuncio Archbishop Aldo Giordano.

On 25 February 2025, Pope Francis announced that Hernández will be canonized.

==Legacy==

Blessed José Gregorio Hernández is also revered by Venezuela&#x27;s alternative and syncretic religion, the cult of Maria Lionza. Historian Steven Palmer also has drawn parallels between the Hernández cult and that of the assassinated Costa Rican physician and politician Ricardo Moreno Cañas.

A private university in Maracaibo, Universidad Dr. José Gregorio Hernández (launched in 2003), is named for him. In 2011, Hernández&#x27; birthday, 26 October, was declared a &quot;day of national celebration&quot;. 

Hernández is also an important folk figure and is commonly portrayed in naïve art.

<doc id="304535" wikidata="Q920200" url="?curid=304535" title="Charles Starkweather">
<text>Charles Raymond Starkweather (November 24, 1938 – June 25, 1959) was an American spree killer who murdered eleven people in Nebraska and Wyoming between November 1957 and January 1958, when he was nineteen years old. He killed ten of his victims between January 21 and January 29, 1958, the date of his arrest. During his spree in 1958, Starkweather was accompanied by his fourteen-year-old girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate.

Both Starkweather and Fugate were convicted on charges for their parts in the homicides; Starkweather was sentenced to death and executed seventeen months after the events. Fugate served seventeen years in prison, gaining release in 1976. Starkweather&#x27;s execution by electric chair in 1959 was the last execution in Nebraska until 1994.

Criminologists and psychologists have analyzed the Starkweather case in an attempt to understand spree killers&#x27; motivations and precipitating factors. It also became notorious as one of the earlier crime scandals that reached national prominence, much like the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s son with the media outlets covering the case at the time openly condemning Starkweather.

==Early life==
Starkweather was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the fourth of seven children of Guy and Helen Arnold Starkweather. The Starkweathers were a working-class family; Starkweather&#x27;s father was a carpenter who was often unemployed due to rheumatoid arthritis in his hands; Helen worked as a waitress to supplement the family&#x27;s income. Guy Starkweather admitted at Charles&#x27;s trial to having pushed his son into a window; later his wife would divorce him on the grounds of extreme cruelty. The family was downwardly mobile: Starkweather&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, George Anson Starkweather, was a member of the United States House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s 21st district from 1847–1849.

Starkweather attended Saratoga Elementary School, Irving Junior High School, and Lincoln High School. In contrast to his family life, Starkweather later recalled nothing positive of his time at school. He was born with genu varum, a mild birth defect that caused his legs to be misshapen, and claimed he was teased by classmates because he had a speech impediment. His elementary school teacher did not recall his being teased.

As he grew older and stronger, the only subject in which Starkweather excelled was physical education, where he found an outlet for his rage against those who bullied him. Starkweather then began to bully those who had once picked on him. Eventually, he felt rage against anyone he disliked. Author Ginger Strand argues that his writings from prison suggest a strong element of class envy and bitterness. Starkweather went from being one of the most well-behaved teenagers in the community to one of the most troubled. His high school friend Bob von Busch would later recall:
By the time Starkweather dropped out of school, his parents and family were reportedly afraid of him due to his violent outbursts.

==Relationship with Caril Ann Fugate==

In 1956, at eighteen, Starkweather was introduced to thirteen-year-old Caril Ann Fugate. Starkweather dropped out of high school in his senior year and took a job at a newspaper warehouse because it was near Fugate&#x27;s school; he began to visit her every day after school. Starkweather taught Fugate how to drive, and one day she crashed the car belonging to Starkweather&#x27;s father, who banished Starkweather from the family home. Starkweather quit his warehouse job and became a garbage collector.

Starkweather began developing a nihilistic worldview, believing that his current situation was the final determinant of how he would live the rest of his life while striving only to satisfy his biological needs and acquire power over others. He began plotting bank robberies, and settled on a personal philosophy: &quot;Dead people are all on the same level&quot;.

==First murder==
Late on November 30, 1957, Starkweather became angry at Robert Colvert, a service station attendant in Lincoln, for refusing to sell him a stuffed animal on credit. He returned several times during the night to purchase small items until finally, brandishing a shotgun, he forced Colvert to give him $100 from the till. He drove Colvert to a remote area, where they struggled over the gun, injuring Colvert before Starkweather killed him with several shots to the head.

==1958 murder spree==
On January 21, 1958, Starkweather went to Fugate&#x27;s home. Fugate&#x27;s mother and stepfather, Velda and Marion Bartlett, told him to stay away. He fatally shot them, then clubbed to death their two-year-old daughter Betty Jean. He hid the bodies in an outhouse and chicken coop behind the house.

Starkweather later said that Caril was there the entire time, but she said that when she arrived home, Starkweather met her with a gun and said that her family was being held hostage. She said Starkweather told her that if she cooperated with him, her family would be safe; otherwise, they would be killed. A note reading &quot;Everybody is sick with the flu&quot; was placed in the family home&#x27;s window. The pair remained in the house until shortly before the police, alerted by Fugate&#x27;s suspicious grandmother, arrived on January 27. When the police broke in, they found no one there and the house in apparent order. A few days later, Charles&#x27;s brother Rodney and his friend Bob Von Busch searched the house and premises, finding the stashed bodies. The police issued an alert to pick up both Starkweather and Fugate.

Starkweather and Fugate drove to the farmhouse of seventy-year-old August Meyer, one of his family&#x27;s friends who lived in Bennet, Nebraska. Starkweather killed him with a shotgun blast to the head. He also killed Meyer&#x27;s dog.

Fleeing the area, the pair drove their car into mud and abandoned it. When Robert Jensen and Carol King, two local teenagers, stopped to give them a ride, Starkweather forced them to drive back to an abandoned storm cellar in Bennet. He shot Jensen in the back of the head. He attempted to rape King, but King put up too much resistance for him to do so. He became angry with her and fatally shot her as well. Starkweather later admitted shooting Jensen, but claimed that Fugate shot King. Fugate said she had stayed in the car the entire time. The two fled Bennet in Jensen&#x27;s car.

Starkweather and Fugate drove to a wealthy section of Lincoln, where they entered the home of industrialist Chester Lauer Ward and his wife Clara. Starkweather stabbed their maid Ludmila &quot;Lilyan&quot; Fencl to death, then waited for Lauer and Clara to return home. Starkweather killed the family dog by breaking its neck to keep it from alerting the Wards. Clara arrived first alone and was also stabbed to death. Starkweather later admitted to having thrown a knife at Clara but insisted that Fugate had stabbed her numerous times, killing her. When Lauer Ward returned home that evening, Starkweather shot and killed him. While Starkweather and Fugate were in the house, the Wards&#x27; newspapers arrived, and they cut out the front-page pictures of themselves and Fugate&#x27;s dead family. These pictures were found on them later, casting doubt on Caril&#x27;s claim that she didn&#x27;t know her family was dead. Starkweather and Fugate filled Ward&#x27;s black 1956 Packard with stolen jewelry from the house and fled Nebraska.

The murders of the Wards and Fencl caused an uproar within Lancaster County. The flames of public fear were fanned by the era&#x27;s ongoing panic about &quot;juvenile delinquency.&quot; Law enforcement agencies in the region sent their officers on a house-to-house search for the perpetrators. Governor Victor Emanuel Anderson contacted the Nebraska National Guard, and the Lincoln chief of police called for a block-by-block search of that city. After several sightings of Starkweather and Fugate were reported, the Lincoln Police Department was accused of incompetence for being unable to capture the pair. Vigilante gangs were formed, and local sheriff Merle Karnopp started forming a posse by arming men he found in bars.

Needing a new car because of Ward&#x27;s Packard having been identified, the couple came upon traveling salesman Merle Collison sleeping in his Buick along the highway outside Douglas, Wyoming. After Collison was awakened, he was fatally shot. Starkweather later accused Fugate of performing a coup-de-grace after his shotgun jammed. Starkweather claimed Fugate was the &quot;most trigger-happy person&quot; he had ever met. Fugate denied ever having killed anyone.

The salesman&#x27;s car had a parking brake, which was something new to Starkweather. While he attempted to drive away, the car stalled because the brake had not been released. He tried to restart the engine, and a passing motorist, geologist Joe Sprinkle, stopped to help. Starkweather threatened him with the rifle, and an altercation ensued. At that moment, Natrona County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy William Romer arrived on the scene. Fugate ran to him, yelling something to the effect of: &quot;It&#x27;s Starkweather! He&#x27;s going to kill me!&quot;

Starkweather drove off and was involved in a car chase with three officers—Romer, Douglas Police Chief Robert Ainslie, and Converse County Sheriff Earl Heflin—exceeding speeds of . A bullet fired by Heflin shattered the windshield and flying glass cut Starkweather deep enough to cause bleeding. He stopped, surrendered, and was taken into custody near Douglas on January 29, 1958. Heflin said, &quot;He thought he was bleeding to death. That&#x27;s why he stopped. That&#x27;s the kind of yellow son of a bitch he is.&quot;

==Trial and execution==
Starkweather chose to be extradited from Wyoming to Nebraska. He and Fugate arrived there in late January 1958. He believed that either state would have executed him. He was not aware, however, that Milward Simpson, Wyoming&#x27;s governor at the time, opposed the death penalty. Starkweather first said that he had kidnapped Fugate and that she had nothing to do with the murders. However, he changed his story several times. He testified against her at her trial, saying that she was a willing participant.

Fugate has always maintained that Starkweather was holding her hostage by threatening to kill her family, claiming she was unaware they were already dead. Judge Harry A. Spencer did not believe Fugate was held hostage by Starkweather, as he determined she had had numerous opportunities to escape. When Starkweather was first taken to the Nebraska penitentiary after his trial, he said that he believed that he was supposed to die. He said if he was to be executed, then Fugate should be also.

Starkweather was convicted, after the jury deliberated for only 22 hours, for the murder of Jensen, the only murder for which he was tried. On May 23, 1958, he was sentenced to death, and Starkweather was executed in the electric chair at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln, Nebraska, at 12:04 a.m. on June 25, 1959. Half an hour before the execution, the doctor who was supposed to pronounce Starkweather dead, B.A. Finkel, himself suffered a fatal heart attack. Starkweather gave no last words but in a letter from prison to his parents, wrote: &quot;but dad I&#x27;m not real sorry for what I did cause for the first time me and Caril have (sic) more fun.&quot; He was reportedly indifferent about his impending death and had become resigned to his fate.

Following the execution, Starkweather was buried in Wyuka Cemetery in Lincoln, as are five of his victims, including the Wards.

Fugate was convicted as an accomplice and received a life sentence on November 21, 1958. She was paroled in June 1976 after serving seventeen-and-a-half-years at the Nebraska Correctional Center for Women in York, Nebraska. She settled in Hillsdale, Michigan.

* Author Harry N. MacLean released a non-fiction book about the killings entitled &quot;Starkweather, The Untold Story Of The Killing Spree That Changed America&quot; (2023). MacLean lived in Lincoln at the time and knew several of the victims.

===Visual arts===
* In 2011, art photographer Christian Patterson released &quot;Redheaded Peckerwood&quot;, a collection of photos made each January from 2005 to 2010 along the 500-mile route traversed by Starkweather and Fugate. The book includes reproductions of documents and photographs of objects that belonged to Starkweather, Fugate, and their victims. Patterson had discovered several of these objects while making his photographs and they had never been seen publicly before or identified with these figures.
* The comic book series &quot;Northlanders&quot; referred to the murder spree in its 2010 story arc &quot;Metal&quot;.

<text>Philip Romolo Neri ( ; , ; 22 July 151526 May 1595), sometimes referred to as the Second Apostle of Rome after Saint Peter, was an Italian Catholic priest who founded the Congregation of the Oratory, a society of secular clergy dedicated to pastoral care and charitable work. Neri&#x27;s spiritual mission emphasized personal holiness and direct service to others, particularly through the education of young people and care for the poor and sick. His work played a significant role in the Counter-Reformation, especially within the city of Rome.

Neri&#x27;s early life in Florence and later move to Rome in 1533 marked the beginning of his dedication to missionary work. He initially gained prominence for his pastoral care and efforts to minister to marginalized communities, including prostitutes and the destitute. His passion for reform and personal holiness drew many followers, leading to the formation of the Church of the Most Holy Trinity of the Pilgrims and the Congregation of the Oratory. The Oratory became a center of spiritual renewal and pastoral innovation, focusing on prayer, music, and informal spiritual gatherings that combined religious instruction with personal reflection.

As a spiritual leader, Neri was noted for his humility, humor, piety, and ability to inspire deep devotion among both clergy and laypeople. His friendship with figures such as Ignatius of Loyola and influence over the Society of Jesus played a role in the broader movement of Church reform. Neri also engaged in limited political activity, most notably when he intervened to secure the reconciliation of Henry IV of France with the Church.

Canonized in 1622, Philip Neri remains a significant figure in Catholic tradition. His feast day is celebrated on 26 May, and he is venerated for his contributions to personal spirituality and the Catholic Church. His legacy is associated with the Seven Churches Walk, a pilgrimage he initiated, and his promotion of musical forms such as the &quot;laude&quot; and oratorios, which had lasting impacts on sacred music.

==Early life==
Philip was the son of Francesco di Neri, a lawyer, and his wife Lucrezia da Mosciano, whose family were nobility in the service of the state. He was carefully brought up, and received his early teaching from the friars at San Marco, the famous Dominican monastery in Florence. He was accustomed in later life to ascribing most of his progress to the teaching of two of them, Zenobio de&#x27; Medici and Servanzio Mini. At the age of 18, in 1533, Philip was sent to his uncle, Romolo, a wealthy merchant at San Germano (now Cassino), a then Neapolitan town near the base of Monte Cassino, to assist him in his business, and with the hope that Philip might inherit Romolo&#x27;s fortune. Philip did gain Romolo&#x27;s confidence and affection, but during his stay he also experienced a religious conversion. From then onward, Philip no longer cared for the things of this world. In 1533, he left San Germano to live in Rome. 

==Founding of the Oratory==

===Mission work===
After arriving in Rome, Philip became a tutor in the house of a Florentine aristocrat named Galeotto Caccia. After two years he began to pursue his studies (for three years) under the guidance of the Augustinians. Following this, he began those labors amongst the sick and poor which, in later life, gained him the title of &quot;Apostle of Rome&quot;. He also ministered to the prostitutes of the city. In 1538 he entered into the home mission work for which he became famous, traveling throughout the city, seeking opportunities of entering into conversation with people, and of leading them to consider the topics he set before them. For seventeen years Philip lived as a layman in Rome, probably without thinking of becoming a priest. Around 1544, he made the acquaintance of Ignatius of Loyola. Many of Philip&#x27;s disciples found their vocations in the infant Society of Jesus.

===Confraternity of the Holy Trinity===
In 1548, together with his confessor, Persiano Rossa, Philip founded the Confraternity of the Most Holy Trinity of Pilgrims and Convalescents (), whose primary object was to minister to the needs of the thousands of poor pilgrims who flocked to Rome, especially in jubilee years, and also to relieve the patients discharged from hospitals but who were still too weak for labor. Members met for prayer at the Church of San Salvatore in Campo where the devotion of the Forty Hours of Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament was first introduced into Rome.

===The Oratory===
In 1551, Philip received all the minor orders, and was ordained deacon and finally priest (on 23 May). He thought of going to India as a missionary but was dissuaded by his friends who saw that there was abundant work to be done in Rome. Accordingly, he settled down, with some companions, at the Hospital of San Girolamo della Carità. There in 1556 he tentatively founded the Congregation of the Oratory, an institute with which his name is especially connected. The scheme at first was no more than a series of evening meetings in a hall (the Oratory), at which there were prayers, hymns, and readings from Scripture, the church fathers, and the Martyrology, followed by a lect of some religious question proposed for consideration. The musical selections (settings of scenes from sacred history) were called &quot;oratorios&quot;. Giovanni Palestrina was one of Philip&#x27;s followers and composed music for the services. The program developed, and the members of the society undertook various kinds of mission work throughout Rome, notably the preaching of sermons in different churches every evening, a completely new idea at that time. He also spent much of his time hearing confessions and effected many conversions in this way.

In 1564, the Florentines requested that Philip leave San Girolamo to oversee their newly built church in Rome, San Giovanni dei Fiorentini. He was at first reluctant, but by consent of Pope Pius IV he accepted while remaining in charge of San Girolamo where the exercises of the Oratory were kept up. At this time the new society included among its members Caesar Baronius (the ecclesiastical historian), Francesco Maria Tarugi (afterward Archbishop of Avignon), and Ottavio Paravicini – all of whom later became cardinals – and also Gallonius (Antonio Galloni, author of a well-known work on the &quot;Sufferings of the Martyrs&quot;), Ancina, Bordoni, and other men of ability and distinction. In 1574, the Florentines built a large oratory or mission room for the society, next to San Giovanni – to save them the fatigue of the daily journey to and from San Girolamo, and to provide a more convenient place of assembly – and the headquarters were transferred there.

As the community grew, and its mission work extended, the need for a church entirely its own made itself felt, and the small parish church of Santa Maria in Vallicella, conveniently situated in the middle of Rome, was offered and accepted. The building, however, not large enough for their purpose, was pulled down, and a splendid church was erected on the site. It was immediately after taking possession of their new quarters that Philip formally organized, under permission of a papal bull dated 15 July 1575, a community of secular priests, called the Congregation of the Oratory. The new church was consecrated early in 1577, and the clergy of the new society at once resigned the charge of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini; Philip himself did not leave San Girolamo until 1583, and then only by an injunction of the pope that he, as the superior, should reside at the chief house of his congregation. He was at first elected for a term of three years (as was common in modern societies) but in 1587 was nominated superior for life. He was, however, entirely free from personal ambition, and had no desire to be superior general over several dependent houses, so he desired that all congregations formed on his model outside Rome should be autonomous, governing themselves, and with no provision for Philip to retain control over any new foundation they might themselves make elsewhere – a regulation afterward formally confirmed by a brief of Gregory XV in 1622.

==Political activity==

Although Philip refrained from becoming involved in political matters, he broke this rule in 1593–1595 when he persuaded Pope Clement VIII to revoke the ex-communication and anathema pronounced against Henry IV of France and the refusal to receive his ambassador, even though the king had formally renounced Calvinism. Philip saw that the pope&#x27;s attitude was more than likely to drive Henry to relapse and rekindle the civil war in France, and directed Caesar Baronius, a member of the Oratory who was then the pope&#x27;s confessor, to refuse the pope absolution and to resign the office of confessor unless the pope withdrew the anathema. Clement yielded at once, though the whole College of Cardinals had supported his policy; and Henry, who did not learn the facts until several years afterward, testified lively gratitude for the timely and political intervention. Philip continued in the government of the Oratory until his death. He was succeeded by Baronius.

==Personal character==
Philip Neri embodied several contradictions, combining popular veneration with intensely individual piety. He became deeply involved with the Church while seeking to reform a corrupt Rome and an indifferent clergy.

Philip possessed a playful sense of humor, combined with a shrewd wit. He considered a cheerful temper to be more Christian than a melancholy one, and carried this spirit into his whole life: &quot;A joyful heart is more easily made perfect than a downcast one.&quot; This was the secret of Neri&#x27;s popularity and his place in the folklore of the Roman poor. Many miracles were attributed to him. When his body was examined after death, it was found that two of his ribs had been broken, which was attributed at the time to the expansion of his heart while fervently praying in the catacombs about the year 1545. Benedict XIV, who reorganized the rules for canonization, decided that Philip&#x27;s enlarged heart was caused by an aneurysm. Ponnelle and Bordet, in their 1932 biography &quot;St. Philip Neri and the Roman Society of His Times (1515–1595)&quot;, conclude that it was partly natural and partly supernatural. What is certain is that Philip himself and his penitents associated it with divine love.

&quot;Practical commonplaceness,&quot; says Frederick William Faber in his panegyric on Philip, &quot;was the special mark that distinguishes his form of ascetic piety from the types accredited before his day. He looked like other men. ...He was emphatically a modern gentleman, of scrupulous courtesy, and sportive gaiety, acquainted with what was going on in the world, taking a real interest in it, giving and getting information, very neatly dressed, with a shrewd common sense always alive about him, in a modern room with modern furniture, plain, it is true, but with no marks of poverty about it – in a word, with all the ease, the gracefulness, the polish of a modern gentleman of good birth, considerable accomplishments, and widespread knowledge.&quot;

Accordingly, Philip was ready to meet the needs of his day to an extent and in a manner which even the versatile Jesuits, who much desired to enlist him in their company, did not rival; and, though an Italian priest and head of a new religious order, his genius was entirely unmonastic and unmedieval – frequent and popular preaching, unconventional prayer, and unsystematized, albeit fervent, private devotion.

Philip prayed, &quot;Let me get through today, and I shall not fear tomorrow.&quot;

Philip had no difficulties in respect of the teaching of his Church. His great merit was the instinctive tact that showed him that the system of monasticism could never be the leaven of secular life in the world of his day, but that something more homely, simple, and every day in character was needed for the new times then emerging.

==Death and veneration==
Philip Neri died around the end of the day on 25 May 1595, the Feast of Corpus Christi that year, after having spent the day hearing confessions and receiving visitors. About midnight he began hemorrhaging, and Baronius read the commendatory prayers over him. Baronius asked that he bless his spiritual sons before dying and, though he could no longer speak, he blessed them with the sign of the cross and died.

Philip Neri was beatified by Paul V in 1615 and canonized by Pope Gregory XV in 1622. His memorial is celebrated on 26 May. His body is venerated in the Chiesa Nuova (&quot;New Church&quot;) in Rome.

Philip Neri is one of the influential figures of the Counter-Reformation and is noted for converting to personal holiness many of the influential people within the church itself. His attitude to animals is referred to in the Catechism of the Catholic Church as offering an example to be followed, alongside the gentleness shown to animals shown by St. Francis.

Philip is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 26 May.

==Legacy==
===The Oratory===
The congregation Philip Neri founded is of an original stamp, little resembling a monastery of the older type, and its rules (not drawn up by Philip Neri, but approved by Pope Paul V in 1612) leave considerable freedom of action compared with traditional religious foundations.

The Congregation of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri is a pontifical society of apostolic life of Catholic priests and lay brothers who live together in a community bound together but without formal vows. They are commonly referred to as Oratorians (Oratorian Fathers). Oratorians commit themselves to membership in a particular, independent, self-governing local community (an Oratory, usually named for the place in which it is located). In some locations, the local Oratory has been designated to administer a particular parish; others may be tasked with campus ministry.

===The French Oratory===
The Oratory movement spread in the early period, especially in Italy. In France, a separate and distinct foundation from the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri was founded, though inspired by St Philip&#x27;s model. Best known as the French Oratory, it was founded in 1611 in Paris, France, by Pierre de Bérulle (1575–1629), later a cardinal of the Catholic Church. The French Oratory had a determinant influence on the French school of spirituality throughout the 17th century. Unlike St Philip&#x27;s Oratory, it operates under the central authority of a Superior General. Early members included Nicolas Malebranche, Louis Thomassin, Jules Mascaron and Jean Baptiste Massillon. Suppressed at the French Revolution, it was revived by Pierre Pététot, curé of St Roch, in 1852, as the &quot;Oratory of Jesus and Mary Immaculate&quot;.

===Music===
Philip Neri encouraged the singing of the &quot;Lauda spiritual&quot; (laude) in his oratory services. The prominent composers Tomás Luis de Victoria and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina probably participated in this music. Historian Francesco Danieli speculates that this would have produced a unique and varied aesthetic experience. 

===Seven Churches Walk===
Philip sometimes led &quot;excursions&quot; to other churches, often with music and a picnic on the way. In 1553, Neri started the tradition of making a one-day pilgrimage to seven churches, starting from St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica and ending at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. 

The tradition of visiting all seven churches was started by Neri to combine conviviality and the sharing of a common religious experience through discovering the heritage of the early saints. Neri drew up an itinerary that included visits to St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, then St. Paul Outside-the-Walls, St. Sebastian&#x27;s, St. John Lateran, Holy Cross-in-Jerusalem, St. Lawrence-Outside-the Walls, and finally St. Mary Major. He and a few friends and acquaintances would gather before dawn and set out on their walk. At each church, there would be prayer, hymn singing, and a brief sermon by Neri.

A simple meal was pre-arranged at the gardens of the Villa Mattei. The Mattei family opened their grounds for pilgrims to rest and provided them with bread, wine, cheese, eggs, apples, and salami. During these &quot;picnics&quot;, musicians would play and singers would perform. 

The street which links Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls with San Sebastiano fuori le mura is still called &quot;Via Delle Sette Chiese&quot; (Seven Churches Walk). These pilgrimages were designed to be a counterpoint to the raucous behavior of Carnival. The Walks became very popular and began to attract others. From this developed the custom of visiting seven churches on Maundy Thursday. In Rome, the Seven Church Walk is traditionally done on Wednesday of Holy Week.

==In popular culture==
Johnny Dorelli played Philip Neri in a 1983 Italian movie &quot;State buoni se potete.&quot;

Gigi Proietti played Philip Neri in a 2010 Italian movie made for television, &quot;Saint Philip Neri: I Prefer Heaven&quot;.

<doc id="304548" wikidata="Q277230" url="?curid=304548" title="98 Degrees">
<text>98 Degrees (stylized as 98°) is a vocal group consisting of brothers Nick and Drew Lachey, Jeff Timmons, and Justin Jeffre. Their first Christmas album, &quot;98 Degrees This Christmas,&quot; has sold over two million copies and is widely recognized as one of the most successful holiday albums ever.

The American pop and R&amp;B group was started independently by Jeff Timmons in Los Angeles, California, although all of its members originate from Ohio. Unlike most boy bands, they were later picked up by a record label, rather than being assembled by a label or a producer. They have sold over 10 million records worldwide and achieved eight top 40 singles in the U.S. Between late 1997 and 2000, the group reached top-twenty status on the &quot;Billboard&quot; U.S. Hot 100 chart, with their debut single &quot;Invisible Man&quot; peaking at No. 12, and 1999&#x27;s pop/R&amp;B cover of the country ballad &quot;I Do (Cherish You)&quot; peaking at No. 13. The group successfully charted in the U.S. top five with &quot;Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche)&quot;, &quot;Because of You&quot;, &quot;The Hardest Thing&quot;, and &quot;Thank God I Found You&quot;—the latter as a guest artist backing Mariah Carey to give 98 Degrees their only number-one song, which earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

Beginning with an August 2012 performance at the Mixtape Festival in Hershey, Pennsylvania, the group reunited and continues to record new music.

==History==

===Formation===
The founding members of 98 Degrees met after Massillon, Ohio native Jeff Timmons decided to quit college and pursue a music career with best friend Jeremy Volk. He studied psychology at Kent State University in his home state of Ohio, and planned on a career playing football in the NFL. In 1995 he sang at a college party with three friends and received a positive reaction from the female audience about his voice. The following day he left college and headed out to Los Angeles, California. &quot;It was a pretty hasty decision, looking back, but I was young and dumb. Sometimes ignorance is bliss,&quot; he said in 2004. He met a former student of the Cincinnati School for Creative and Performing Arts who passed his name on to another graduate, Nick Lachey, who was attending Miami (of Ohio) University to study sports medicine. Lachey flew to Los Angeles and, after hitting it off, decided to form a boyband. Lachey suggested inviting one of his friends, Justin Jeffre, to join them. Jeffre, a history student at University of Cincinnati, had attended SCPA with Lachey and they had performed together before in various outfits such as a barbershop quartet at the amusement park Kings Island and a cover band. The final member to join the band was Lachey&#x27;s younger brother Drew, who was working in New York City as an emergency medical technician, as a replacement for founding member Jonathan Lippmann.

After rejecting a series of names (including Just Us and Next Issue), upon the suggestion by their manager Paris D&#x27;Jon, they decided on &quot;98 Degrees&quot; describing body temperature and their music.

===Signing to Motown records===
Taking a series of jobs including landscaping, working as club security officers and delivering take-out food, the band refined its harmonies and presentation, looking to groups such as Boyz II Men, Take 6, and Jodeci for inspiration. The new group also made the rounds of auditions in Los Angeles and gradually built up its contacts in the music industry. The group&#x27;s wait for a manager and a recording contract did not take long, as they seized an opportunity to perform during a radio broadcast of a Boyz II Men concert, which they attended in the hope of passing a demo tape to the band. They were discovered by music manager Paris D&#x27;Jon, who was co-managing Montell Jordan at the time.

Just before the group signed their deal founding member Jonathan Lippman departed the group due to his religious beliefs, he later went on to form CCM group True Vibe.

The group&#x27;s emergence at a time when teen-oriented acts like the Spice Girls, the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC were just hitting the top of the charts around the world compelled them to differentiate themselves from the mere &quot;boy band&quot; status that they derided. From the start, they emphasized that they wrote much of their own material, which reflected R&amp;B influences more than mainstream pop roots. Drew Lachey commented in an interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in April 1999, &quot;Anybody who has listened to Backstreet [Boys]&#x27;s album, our album and *NSYNC&#x27;s album will definitely see that there are major differences musically between groups, not to mention the fact that we were signed to Motown, which gives us a little more credibility as far as R&amp;B and soul music goes. Not to mention that we’ve been influenced by more of those type of artists.&quot; Directly referring to NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys, he added, &quot;We are singers, songwriters, and producers all in one, not just one of those manufactured pop groups that is put together as a marketing scheme. We are actually in this for the music, which is our first love. That is the major difference.&quot;

===1997: First album===

With their debut single, &quot;Invisible Man&quot; which peaked at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, achieving gold-record status after its July 1997 release, 98 Degrees was off to a promising start. Although critical response to the debut of the group was mixed, a Billboard review of their first single noted their vocal abilities, and the addition of a new track helped to keep the band in the public eye. The group also toured extensively, including concert dates in Asia. They also opened for several dates of Janet Jackson&#x27;s Velvet Rope Tour, exposing them to a wider audience.

===1998-1999: Breakthrough===
After building popularity with their appearance in the animated Disney movie &quot;Mulan&quot;, and singing &quot;True to Your Heart&quot;, a duet with labelmate Stevie Wonder, their album &quot;98 Degrees and Rising&quot; went 4× platinum in 1998. Production credit included Atlanta-based producer and Babyface co-writing partner Daryl Simmons. Musician credits on the breakthrough album featured Atlanta-based session musician and former Earth, Wind &amp; Fire guitarist Dick Smith. After the second album, 98 Degrees left Motown for its parent company, Universal Records.

The band&#x27;s first major hit was &quot;Because of You&quot; (number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number five on the Canadian Singles Chart) and went platinum. &quot;The Hardest Thing&quot; followed the success by reaching No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold.

In 1999, 98 Degrees released their Christmas album &quot;This Christmas&quot;, which spawned the top 40 single &quot;This Gift&quot;. Within a month after its release the album was certified platinum. The group appeared as featured guests on Amy Grant&#x27;s 1999 CBS Christmas special, &quot;A Christmas to Remember&quot;. Nick Lachey was featured on Jessica Simpson&#x27;s album on the track &quot;Where You Are&quot;, which was released as a single and reached the top 40. The group appeared in the album called &quot;&quot; with their song &quot;The Love That You&#x27;ve Been Looking For&quot;.

===2000–2002: &quot;Revelation&quot;===
The group scored a &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 hit in the U.S. with the single &quot;Thank God I Found You&quot;, a collaboration with Mariah Carey and Joe. The single went gold, selling 700,000 copies. It stayed at No. 1 on the Hot 100 for one week and the top 200 singles sales chart for 51 weeks. The single went to the top 10 in the UK charts and the group also received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for the same song.

In the summer of 2000, 98 Degrees released the first single of their new album &quot;Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche)&quot;, the single went to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified gold. In September 2000, the band&#x27;s album &quot;Revelation&quot; was released. &quot;Revelation&quot; peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and went 2× Platinum. The band&#x27;s next singles were &quot;My Everything&quot; and &quot;The Way You Want Me To&quot;, the former reaching the Top 40.

In September 2001, the band appeared at Madison Square Garden alongside Luther Vandross and Usher singing Michael Jackson&#x27;s hit song &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;. The performance was part of a show to celebrate Michael Jackson&#x27;s 30 years as a solo artist.

In 2002, 98 Degrees released a compilation album called &quot;The Collection&quot;, with the new single &quot;Why (Are We Still Friends)&quot;. At that point the group had sold over 10 million records and released 12 singles.

===2003–2012: Hiatus===
In 2003, the group went on hiatus. At the time, Drew Lachey stated that 98 Degrees had not broken up. During the hiatus, Drew and his wife had their first daughter shortly after he won the second season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Nick Lachey married singer Jessica Simpson and released two solo albums, &quot;SoulO&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Left of Me&quot;. Timmons released the solo album &quot;Whisper That Way&quot; and participated in the VH1 reality TV series, &quot;Mission Man Band&quot;. Jeffre ran for mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio, and worked on independent media projects.

The band reunited in 2004 to perform on &quot;Nick &amp; Jessica&#x27;s Family Christmas&quot; TV special. In September 2005, 98 Degrees performed at Club Purgatory in Over-the-Rhine to support Jeffre in his candidacy for mayor of Cincinnati.

===2012–present: Reunion, &quot;2.0&quot; and &quot;Let It Snow&quot;===
On June 20, 2012, Nick and Drew Lachey announced on Ryan Seacrest that the group would reunite for a one-time performance at Mixtape Festival in Hershey, PA in August. The group also performed at &quot;The Today Show&quot; on August 17.

In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on July 26, 2012, Drew Lachey revealed that a week before, the group had their first rehearsal in over a decade. He also explained the group decided to come back together because they were all at that place in their lives where they felt comfortable committing to being in a group again, and they also felt the timing was right because the pop music genre has come back around. &quot;Music is very cyclical. You go through rock stages, R&amp;B stages, rap stages... It&#x27;s an uphill battle if you try and do pop during a rap stage,&quot; says Lachey. Regarding the group&#x27;s future, he said at this time, they currently have no plan beyond their performances at &quot;The Today Show&quot; and the Mixtape Festival. However, in September 2012, he revealed the group was going to go back into the studio to record a new album in October.

On January 22, 2013, the group appeared on &quot;The View&quot; along with New Kids on the Block and Boyz II Men to announce their joint tour would take place in summer 2013. This tour is named &quot;The Package&quot; and the 12 members on tour (Boyz II Men with 3 members, NKOTB with 5 members and 98 Degrees with 4 members) jokingly refer to themselves as &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;. The North American tour began on May 28, 2013. The band also performed a song during the season finale of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Sing-Off&quot;, which Nick Lachey hosts, on December 23, 2013.

The band released their new album, &quot;2.0&quot;, their first studio album in 13 years, on May 7, 2013.

In summer 2016, they regrouped again to headline the My2K Tour, their first headlining tour in 15 years. They were supported by O-Town, Ryan Cabrera, and Dream, putting together a bill of pop acts that were first popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s at larger venues.

In 2017, they returned to Universal Music and put out their second Christmas album, &quot;Let it Snow&quot;, because of their 20th anniversary. They promoted it with a series of concerts across the United States called the &quot;At Christmas Tour&quot;.

On November 23, 2017, the band made a 90-second musical appearance in Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, performed in New York City.

On May 21, 2018, the band made a musical appearance at Miss USA, singing &quot;The Hardest Thing&quot; and &quot;I Do&quot;, as the three final girls did their last walk on the stage.

From October 15 to October 16, 2018, 98 Degrees appeared at Epcot at Walt Disney World as part of the Eat To The Beat concert series during the annual Food and Wine Festival.

On July 9, 2021, the band released a new single titled &quot;Where Do You Want To Go&quot;. They joined Canadian country singer Brett Kissel on the single &quot;Ain&#x27;t the Same&quot; in April 2022.

<text>Phallaceae is a family of fungi, commonly known as stinkhorns, within the order Phallales. Stinkhorns have a worldwide distribution, but are especially prevalent in tropical regions. They are known for their foul-smelling, sticky spore masses, or gleba, borne on the end of a stalk called the receptaculum. The characteristic fruiting-body structure, a single, unbranched receptaculum with an externally attached gleba on the upper part, distinguishes the Phallaceae from other families in the Phallales. The spore mass typically smells of carrion or dung, and attracts flies, beetles and other insects to help disperse the spores. Although there is great diversity in body structure shape among the various genera, all species in the Phallaceae begin their development as oval or round structures known as &quot;eggs&quot;. The appearance of Phallaceae is often sudden, as gleba can erupt from the underground egg and burst open within an hour. According to a 2008 estimate, the family contains 21 genera and 77 species.

==Description==
Species of stinkhorns have gasteroid, or internally produced, spores. Fruiting bodies originate as a gelatinous, spherical, or egg-shaped structure that may be completely or partially buried underground. The peridium, the outer layer of the egg, is white, or purple/red, with two or three layers. The outer layer is thin, membranous, and elastic, while the inner layer is thicker, gelatinous, and continuous. At maturity, the peridium opens up and remains as a volva at the base of the receptaculum.

This porous mushroom is among the fastest growing in the world, extending by 5 mm per minute, so fast that a crackling sound can be heard. Technically it is not really growing, as it uses a form of cellular origami to increase its size by absorbing water.

The fertile portion of the fruiting body is often borne on the end of a wide, fleshy or spongy stalk (as in the Phallales), which may be cylindrical, star-shaped, or reticulate (forming a network). They may be brightly colored, sometimes with a lattice- or veil-like membrane enclosing and protecting the spores. The spore-containing substance, the gleba, is typically gelatinous, often foul-smelling, and deliquescent (becoming liquid from the absorption of water). The gleba is formed on the exterior face of the cap or the upper part of the receptacle.

The basidia are small and narrowly club-shaped or , short-lived (evanescent), with four to eight sterigmata. The spores are usually ellipsoid or cylindrical in shape, hyaline or pale brown, smooth, more or less smooth-walled, and truncated at the base.

The gelatinous layer of the stinkhorn &quot;(Clathrus ruber)&quot; contains high concentrations of potassium, calcium, manganese, and iron. A moderate amount of calcium is found in the receptacle and gleba as well as a high amount of manganese is also found in the gleba. Retaining a high potassium concentration is important for the growth of the stem of the fruiting body called the , where potassium plays a key component in regulating osmotic pressure. This osmotic pressure helps maintain the shape of the carpophore. The calcium found in the gelatinous layer contributes to the slimy characteristics of the gel and protects the carpophore during growth. The strong adhesive gelatinous layer consists of polysaccharides that are formed by the sequestration of calcium ions. The high manganese and iron concentrations in the gelatinous layer and gleba are theorized to produce enzymes that produce sugars and odorous compounds that play a role in attracting insects.

Stinkhorns are edible, but only at the egg stage when the smell is less strong. The inner layer can be cut out with a knife and eaten raw – it is crisp and crunchy with a radish-like taste. 

The mushrooms also contains several pharmaceutical compounds with potential for cancer treatment.

==Genera==

; &quot;Anthurus&quot; :Fruiting bodies have a short stalk from which arises a spore-bearing structure (the receptaculum) of 5–8 arched arms. These arms, initially joined at the top, disconnect and curve irregularly to expose the inner surface of each arm, which is covered with green spore-containing gleba. Spores are 3–4 × 1–1.5 μm.
; &quot;Aporophallus&quot; 
; &quot;Aseroë&quot; :Mature fruiting bodies contain a roughly cylindrical white or pinkish stalk approximately 6 × 2 cm, with a volva at the base. At the top is a bright red disc with a variable number of arms, typically 3–7 cm long. The gleba found on the disc and inner side of the arms is slimy, foetid, and green colored. Spores are hyaline, with dimensions of 4–6 1.5–2 μm. &quot;Aseroë rubra&quot;, an Australian and Pacific species which has spread to Europe and North America.
;&quot;Blumenavia&quot; 
; &quot;Clathrus&quot; :Fruiting bodies are latticed (clathrate), and made of hollow tubular arms that originate from the basal tissue within the volva. Spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, with dimensions of 4–6 ×1.5–2.5 μm. Examples include &quot;Clathrus ruber&quot;, the lattice stinkhorn, &quot;Clathrus archeri&quot;, the octopus stinkhorn, and &quot;Clathrus columnatus&quot;, the columned stinkhorn.
;&quot;Colus&quot; : A genus of four species with fruit bodies that are a short stalk from which six columns arise, joining at the top to form a red, arching, clathrate receptaculum. The gleba is smeared on the inside surface of the receptaculum.
; &quot;Echinophallus&quot; 
; &quot;Endophallus&quot; : Contains a single species, &quot;E. yunnanensis&quot; found in China, that resembles &quot;Phallus&quot; except for a peridium that is separated from the base of the stem and which does not persist as a volva.
; &quot;Ileodictyon&quot; :Fruiting bodies are latticed (clathrate), and have gelatinous arms that lie sessile within the volva. Spores are elliptical, and have dimensions of 4–6 1.5–2.5 μm. The New Zealand native, &quot;Ileodictyon cibarium&quot;, known as the basket fungus, has a fruiting body shaped somewhat like a round or oval ball with interlaced or latticed branches.
; &quot;Itajahya&quot; :Characters in this genus include a white calyptra (tissue which covers the top of the fruiting body to which the gleba is attached), lamellate plates covered with gleba. The gleba has a white mottled surface, and the pileus appears wig-like when removed of the gleba. The thick, stout stalk has many chambered walls.
; &quot;Kobayasia&quot; : This genus circumscribes the single species &quot;Kobayasia nipponica&quot;, found in Japan in 1958.
; &quot;Laternea&quot; :

; &quot;Ligiella&quot; :Fruiting bodies are 4.5–6.5 cm long, 2.2–5 cm in diameter, and have four or five thick white chambered arms that are joined at the top, but free at the base. This monotypic genus, containing the single species &quot;L. rodrigueziana&quot;, is known only from Costa Rica.
; &quot;Lysurus&quot; :Fruiting bodies consist of a long stalk with 3 or 4 short, thick arms. These arms, initially joined together, but usually separate at maturity, are covered with the brownish-olivaceous gleba. Spores are ellipsoidal, with dimensions of 4–5 × 1.5–2 μm.
; &quot;Mutinus&quot; :The mature fruiting body has a spongy, cylindrical hollow stalk which ends in a slender, tapered, sometimes curved head covered with the dark olivaceous, slimy gleba. In older specimens, the gleba may be washed or worn off to show the orange or red color of the head itself. Notable species include the dog stinkhorn &quot;Mutinus caninus&quot;.
; &quot;Neolysurus&quot; : This genus contains the single species &quot;Neolysurus arcipulvinus&quot;, described from Costa Rica. The stipe and arms have a tubular construction, similar to species from &quot;Lysurus&quot;. &quot;Neolysurus&quot; is unique in having a long stipe, ending in arms or columns that branch and interconnect to support a cushion-shaped, olive green gleba. The glebal cushion is divided into polygonal compartments by a fine pinkish white, solid mesh. The hymenium is continuous between the mesh.
; &quot;Phallus&quot; :In species of &quot;Phallus&quot;, the receptaculum is a tall unbranched stalk that ends in a cap-like structure that bears the gleba. Notable species include &quot;Phallus impudicus&quot;, the common stinkhorn, &quot;Phallus hadriani&quot;, &quot;Phallus ravenelii&quot;, and &quot;Phallus indusiatus&quot; (syn. &quot;Dictyophora indusiata&quot;), the Chinese &quot;bamboo fungus&quot;, eaten as a food in southwestern China after the foul smelling cap is removed.
; &quot;Protubera&quot; :Fruiting bodies are egg-shaped, 2.2–3.5 cm in diameter by 3–4 cm high, with a dull white, soft exoperidium (roughly 1 mm thick) and a grayish exoperidium (3–4 mm thick). The gleba is contained within internal chambers that are separated by whitish, gelatinous tissue that originates from a columella-like, gelatinous central core. Spores are elliptical, smooth, nearly hyaline, and 3.5–4.5 1.5–2 μm.
; &quot;Protuberella&quot; :This genus resembles the &quot;Protubera&quot;, except that the tissue is &quot;gelatinous fleshy in the peridium and not so distinctly gelatinous as in &quot;Protubera maracuja&quot;, they are less gelatinous in the nature of the sterile strands than those of &quot;P. maracuja&quot;&quot;. Spores are clylindric, thin-walled, and 3.7–5 2–2.5 μm. This monotypic genus contains the single species &quot;Protuberella borealis&quot;, known only from Asia.
;&quot;Pseudoclathrus&quot; 
; &quot;Pseudocolus&quot; 
; &quot;Staheliomyces&quot; 

== Volatile compounds ==
The number and type of volatile compounds produced by stinkhorn mushrooms changes throughout its life course. When the stinkhorn is still in its egg stage, the total amount of volatile substances is relatively low. The sulfuric odorous compounds (that attract insects) is absent. During this stage the mushroom’s veil covers up the slime covered cap that contains the spores. When the stinkhorn grows into a more mature-fruit body, there are over twenty-two volatile compounds found in the mature-fruit bodies including dimethyl oligosulfides, aroma-active phenylalanines and various terpenoids that act as insect attractants. In an over-ripe stinkhorn, forty-one volatile components are present, many of which also act as insect attractants. Dimethyl oligosulfides are not as commonly found in over-ripe fruit as they were in the mature fruit bodies since many of the insects already carried the smelly slime away.

The stinkhorn contains compounds of carrion, such as oligosulfides, and of feces, such as phenol, indole and p-cresol. This provides evidence for mimicry of carrion and feces and convergence in the putrid scents of fungus. The stinkhorn’s scent is similar to that of rotten meat and dog feces. This scent profile supports the assumption that the stinkhorn mimics fly brood sites and food sources. The flies are being lured in by the exploitation of their innate attraction to smell of the decaying animal matter that the stinkhorn gives off.

<text>Mima Jaušovec (; born 20 July 1956) is a Slovenian former professional tennis player. Competing for Yugoslavia, she won the 1977 French Open singles championship.

==Early life==
Jaušovec was born in Maribor, in present-day Slovenia, when it was part of Yugoslavia.

==Career==
As a girl, she was coached by Jelena Genčić. In singles, Jaušovec reached a career high of No. 6 in 1982. Her only Grand Slam triumph came in the 1977 French Open singles championship. In 1978, she again reached the final but was defeated by Virginia Ruzici. In 1983, she reached her third French Open singles final, losing to Chris Evert. Jaušovec&#x27;s other tournament wins include the 1976 Italian Open and the 1978 German Open.

Jaušovec teamed with Ruzici to win the women&#x27;s doubles title at the 1978 French Open. They defeated Lesley Turner Bowrey and Gail Sherriff Lovera in the final. In the same year, Jaušovec and Ruzici were the runners-up at Wimbledon, losing to Kerry Melville Reid and Wendy Turnbull.
Jaušovec&#x27;s other victories at Grand Slam tournaments include wins over Martina Navratilova at the 1974 Wimbledon Championships, Virginia Wade at 1976 US Open, Wendy Turnbull at 1978 Wimbledon Championships, Evonne Goolagong at 1980 Australian Open, Andrea Jaeger at 1981 Wimbledon Championships, and Sylvia Hanika at 1983 French Open.

Jaušovec retired from playing in 1988. Today, she is the head coach of the Slovenian national female tennis team. She was an unsuccessful candidate of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia for the 2004 European Parliament election.

<text>Distance fog is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to enhance the perception of distance by shading distant objects differently.

Because many of the shapes in graphical environments are relatively simple, and complex shadows are difficult to render, many graphics engines employ a &quot;fog&quot; gradient so objects further from the camera are progressively more obscured by haze and by aerial perspective. This technique simulates the effect of light scattering, which causes more distant objects to appear lower in contrast, especially in outdoor environments.

Visibility in a natural haze declines exponentially, not linearly, with distance due to scattering. The colour of the light being scattered into the viewing path affects the colour of the haze; blue under blue skies, reddish near sunset, as with alpenglow. These more subtle details are represented in some graphics.

&quot;Fogging&quot; is another use of distance fog in mid-to-late 1990s games, when processing power was not enough to render far viewing distances, and clipping was employed. Clipping could be very distracting since bits and pieces of polygons would flicker in and out of view instantly, and by applying a medium-ranged distance fog, the clipped polygons would appear at a sufficiently far distance that they were obscured by the fog, fading in as the player approached.

<doc id="304558" wikidata="Q283487" url="?curid=304558" title="Taking Back Sunday">
<text>Taking Back Sunday is an American rock band from Amityville, New York, formed by guitarist Eddie Reyes and bassist Jesse Lacey in 1999. The band&#x27;s current members are Adam Lazzara (lead vocals), John Nolan (lead guitar, keyboards, vocals) and Shaun Cooper (bass guitar), accompanied by Nathan Cogan (guitar) for their live performances. The band&#x27;s former members include Lacey, Reyes, drummer Mark O&#x27;Connell, bassist Matthew Rubano, and guitarist-vocalists Fred Mascherino and Matthew Fazzi.

Lacey quit Taking Back Sunday in 1999 and in 2000 formed the rock band Brand New, with whom Taking Back Sunday would become embroiled in a highly publicized feud. Lazzara replaced original vocalist Antonio Longo prior to the release of the band&#x27;s 2002 debut album &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot;. Nolan and Cooper left the band in 2003 to form Straylight Run before returning in 2010. The band&#x27;s breakthrough album, 2006&#x27;s &quot;Louder Now&quot;, featured the popular lead single &quot;MakeDamnSure&quot;, sold over 900,000 copies, and peaked at No. 2 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, surpassing the band&#x27;s previous &quot;Billboard 200&quot; peak in 2004 at No. 3 with &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot;.

They released their eighth studio album, &quot;152&quot;, in 2023.

==History==

===Early years (1999–2002)===
Guitarist Eddie Reyes, who had played in the Movielife, Mind Over Matter and Inside, and guitarist Jesse Lacey of the Rookie Lot founded Taking Back Sunday in Amityville, New York, in November 1999. The band&#x27;s name was taken from a song by Long Island band the Waiting Process. Lacey moved to bass with the addition of guitarist John Nolan. The group also included vocalist Antonio Longo of One True Thing and drummer Steven DeJoseph. At a party, Nolan reportedly romanced Lacey&#x27;s girlfriend, after which Lacey left the band. Lacey formed Brand New a year later. Nolan contacted Adam Lazzara to fill in on bass, which resulted in Lazzara moving from North Carolina to New York. Lazzara had met the band when they played a show near his hometown in North Carolina.

DeJoseph was unable to tour extensively because of personal issues and was waiting until the band had another drummer before leaving the group. Mark O&#x27;Connell, a friend of Reyes, heard about the opening and joined the group. After recording Taking Back Sunday&#x27;s self-titled EP, Longo left the band and eventually played with The Prizefighter and the Mirror. In December 2000, Lazzara switched from bass to lead vocals. He never thought he would become the group&#x27;s singer: &quot;I remember getting into [Reyes&#x27;] Windstar with that [EP] and just driving around singing those songs, just to make myself actually do it.&quot; O&#x27;Connell suggested that the group needed a bassist, and brought in Shaun Cooper. Lazzara spoke of his initial thoughts on Cooper&#x27;s talent in an interview with AP magazine, saying with Cooper it was &quot;the best bass playing I&#x27;d ever seen in my life. I was like, &quot;Oh my God, people can do that?&#x27;&quot; In February 2001, Taking Back Sunday released a five-track demo before touring for a year.

While performing as an unsigned band, they received contract offers from labels that ultimately amounted to nothing. These included Triple Crown Records, who was apprehensive as they had just signed Brand New, and Drive-Thru Records&#x27; offer resulted from co-owner Richard Reines having mistaken Nolan for Lacey. Eventually, a friend of the band shared a demo with Victory Records sales and A&amp;R representative Angel Juarbe. Jurabe then sent a copy to Victory founder Tony Brummel, who asked to see a live performance. Within two weeks of seeing them live, a contract was written up, and the band signed to Victory in December 2001.

===Victory Records era: &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot; and &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot; (2002–2005)===

Although other labels expressed interest in Taking Back Sunday, Victory Records encouraged them to make an album. The band&#x27;s debut effort was recorded over a period of two weeks in December 2001 at Big Blue Meenie Recording Studio in New Jersey with producer Sal Villanueva. Lazzara fell ill around Christmas, and the sessions were delayed one to two weeks; recording concluded in early January 2002, and ended up costing $10,000. The debut album&#x27;s name was revealed in February to be &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot;; prior to the release of their debut, a music video for &quot;Great Romances of the 20th Century&quot; was released on March 4, 2002. It was directed by Christian Winters, a friend of the band. Winters made the video before the group signed with Victory, and the record company enjoyed it. The song was distributed to radio stations on March 12, and the full album was released on March 25. A video for &quot;Cute Without the &#x27;E&#x27; (Cut from the Team)&quot; followed on December 10, 2002, and &quot;You&#x27;re so Last Summer&quot; on November 24, 2003, following a radio release the previous September. Both videos were also directed by Winters.

Lazzara was suffering from a drinking problem around this time and cheated on Nolan&#x27;s sister, Michelle, who he had been dating for a while. After playing Skate &amp; Surf Festival in late April 2003, Lazzara apologized to Nolan later that evening. However, Nolan later learned the apology had been insincere, and both Nolan and Cooper officially told the other three band members they were leaving the band two days later. Nolan publicly reasoned that his departure resulted from exhaustion from touring; Lazzara reiterated this reason, and revealed Cooper had left because he did not want to be in the band without Nolan. In truth, Nolan later revealed there was constant fighting within the group, with each member feeling they were not receiving enough credit for the group&#x27;s success.

John and Michelle Nolan formed Straylight Run with Cooper and Breaking Pangaea drummer Will Noon in the wake of the split from Taking Back Sunday. Taking Back Sunday underwent a short period where they were unsure what to do next, and even briefly considered breaking up. The band was due to tour the United Kingdom with Brand New in May and June 2003; however, all the shows were cancelled because of rumors of the band breaking up. Eventually, it was decided the band would continue; the two departed Taking Back Sunday members were replaced by Breaking Pangaea frontman Fred Mascherino on guitar and vocals as well as O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s longtime friend Matt Rubano on bass.

After their co-headlining tour with Saves the Day concluded in November 2003, Taking Back Sunday immediately commenced work on a second album. Recording for the second album began on March 1, with Lou Giordano at the helm as producer. Taking Back Sunday self-financed the recording sessions, two weeks of which took place at Mission Sound in Brooklyn, New York. The remainder of the album was completed at Water Music in Hoboken, New Jersey, and recording was officially finished by April. At the suggestion of Giordano, the band experimented with instruments aside from the group&#x27;s usual instrumentation.

The record, titled &quot;Where You Want To Be&quot;, was released on July 27, 2004, on Victory Records. Despite sounding slightly different from &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot; as a result of Giordano&#x27;s guidance, the new album managed to do well commercially; preceded by the single &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot; on June 22, &quot;Where You Want To Be&quot; was propelled to the No. 3 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart at its debut, with around 163,000 copies sold. It became one of the best-selling independent rock albums within a year, selling 634,000 copies by June 2005. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed &quot;Where You Want To Be&quot; as one of the top fifty records of 2004. Instead of spending marketing money towards trying to get radio play, Victory Records deployed a street team handing out sampler CDs and fliers to promote the album. It remains Victory&#x27;s highest chart peak for an album.

Tom DeLonge of Blink-182 directed the music video for &quot;This Photograph is Proof (I Know You Know)&quot;; Blink-182 had invited the band to open for them during their North American tour in 2004. Taking Back Sunday toured frequently for eight months in support of &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot;, including an appearance at the Reading Festival.

===Major label debut: &quot;Louder Now&quot; (2005–2007)===
Production on Taking Back Sunday&#x27;s third album began in April 2005, when Lazzara that the band was in &quot;the early stages&quot; of writing new songs. During this time, they were on a co-headlining tour with Jimmy Eat World; they would introduce two new tracks, &quot;Error: Operator&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?&quot; during these shows. On June 10, 2005, it was announced that the band had signed with major label Warner Bros. Records and would begin recording their third album later in 2005. &quot;Error: Operator&quot; would become the first song from the upcoming album to be released when it was added to the video-game adaption of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;; it was later added to the film&#x27;s soundtrack as well.

On September 21, 2005, it was announced that Taking Back Sunday had begun recording their third album. With Eric Valentine at the helm, recording commenced at Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles. The group chose Valentine because he had produced Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; (2002) and Third Eye Blind&#x27;s self-titled album (1997). The band had attempted to secure Valentine as producer for &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot;, but were unable to. During the sessions, the band strived to take a more rock-oriented instrumental approach without compromising their whole compositional style. By January 2006, the album was completed, and the album&#x27;s title was revealed the following month as &quot;Louder Now&quot;.

&quot;Louder Now&quot; was released on April 25, 2006 through Warner Bros. Records. The members&#x27; comments on the album reflected the dramatic change the band had undergone in the two years since their last release. Matt Rubano noted that the move to a major label was not something the band took lightly, but it was a move that made sense given the band&#x27;s tumultuous past.

On October 30, 2006, the band&#x27;s former record label, Victory Records, released &quot;Notes from the Past&quot;, which featured four songs from &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot;, six songs from &quot;Where You Want To Be&quot;, and two B-sides: &quot;The Ballad of Sal Villanueva&quot; and &quot;Your Own Disaster (&#x27;04 mix)&quot;. The band then released &quot;Louder Now: Part Two&quot; on November 20, 2007, a DVD of unreleased live concert footage from their show at Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California, which included special features such as the video for &quot;Twenty-Twenty Surgery&quot;, made to be released in Europe. In 2007, the band contributed the song &quot;What&#x27;s It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?&quot; to for the science fiction action film &quot;Transformers&quot;, although the song did not appear in the film.

===Departure of Fred Mascherino and &quot;New Again&quot; (2007–2010)===
In October 2007, the band announced that Taking Back Sunday and guitarist Fred Mascherino would be parting ways, which came after he decided to focus on his then upcoming solo album with The Color Fred. He was later replaced by Matthew Fazzi, who would provide guitar and backing vocals. Mascherino went on to reveal in later interviews: &quot;There were just problems between the five of us about writing, who was going to do it and how we were going to do it, we weren&#x27;t being very productive because we were fighting too much about that stuff. The band was more about cooking food than making music.&quot; This statement inspired the band to write the track &quot;Capital M-E&quot;, which features lyrical references to Mascherino&#x27;s departure and the comments he made afterward. In 2010, Fred Mascherino posted a picture of himself and Adam Lazzara with the caption, &quot;Today was a good day&quot; indicating that he and Lazzara have since made up and are on good terms again.

On November 6, 2008, Taking Back Sunday revealed in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that their fourth studio album was to be titled &quot;New Again&quot; and would feature the tracks &quot;Winter Passing&quot;, &quot;Lonely Lonely&quot;, &quot;Catholic Knees&quot;, and &quot;Carpathia&quot;. They stated that &quot;Winter Passing&quot; was &quot;... a slow dance like the last song at your 8th grade dance [that] moves more like an R&amp;B tune than a rock and roll song&quot;, and that &quot;Carpathia&quot; will include the first bass solos in any Taking Back Sunday song. They also commented that &quot;Catholic Knees&quot; is &quot;one of the heavier songs we&#x27;ve ever written&quot;, and that &quot;Lonely Lonely&quot; is &quot;relentless – two and a half minutes of punching you in the face&quot;. In the build-up to the release of &quot;New Again&quot;, the band released a number of tracks—the first of which was &quot;Carpathia&quot;—on December 21, 2008, as free digital downloads to those who purchased the band&#x27;s &quot;Christmas holiday set&quot;, with a physical limited vinyl release of the track as well as a live version of &quot;Catholic Knees&quot; released on April 18, 2009. The title track &quot;New Again&quot; followed as a free single download from the band&#x27;s website on April 16, 2009, followed by the first full single &quot;Sink into Me&quot;, released on April 20, 2009, premiering on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Zane Lowe show, and being made available digitally short after. On May 16, 2009, &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; was released to stream on the band&#x27;s MySpace. Every Monday, the band released a new song on their MySpace from &quot;New Again&quot; labeling it &quot;New Music Monday&quot;.

During their tour supporting &quot;New Again&quot;, the band played in Dublin, Ireland where guitarist Matt Fazzi fractured his foot. Despite this, the show in Belfast, Northern Ireland went on and the rest of the tour was completed, which included stops in the UK at Sonisphere Festival and the Kerrang! awards show. On August 18, 2009, the band released a digital live album entitled &quot;Live from Bamboozle &#x27;09&quot;. The album consists of 13 live tracks recorded at The Bamboozle, where they played in May of the same year. In September 2009, the band announced they will be co-headlining with The All-American Rejects and Anberlin for a full US tour. They are also set to release a live acoustic DVD around spring 2010 following the tour.

&quot;Winter Passing&quot; did not make it to the final release of &quot;New Again&quot;; it was released on February 12, 2010 on their official website.

Throughout February and March the band played the Australian Soundwave tour, playing songs from various albums to crowds of almost 30,000.

===&quot;Taking Back Sunday&quot; and lineup change (2010–2012)===
On March 29, 2010, Matt Rubano and Matthew Fazzi announced that they were no longer members of Taking Back Sunday.

On April 12, after some social media hints, the band made an official announcement confirming that John Nolan and Shaun Cooper had re-joined the band. It was announced that they would soon begin the recording process of their fifth studio album with &quot;Louder Now&quot; producer Eric Valentine. On the same day, Adam Lazzara did an interview with &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, in which he discussed how the original line-up got back together and how both Matt Rubano and Matt Fazzi were not fired, but rather &quot;let go&quot;. The band finished writing in El Paso with around 15 songs completed, according to Mark O&#x27;Connell. Pre-production on the new album began on August 17, 2010, the same day their live acoustic album &quot;Live from Orensanz&quot; was released. On December 20, 2010, the band put out a new Christmas song entitled &quot;Merry Christmas I Missed You So Much&quot;. On April 6, 2011, the band played at Maxwell&#x27;s in Hoboken, New Jersey, to record footage for an upcoming video for the song &quot;El Paso&quot;. &quot;Faith (When I Let You Down)&quot; was released as the official first single from the album on May 3, 2011, with an acoustic version of &quot;Great Romances of the 20th Century&quot; as the b-side. On June 7, 2011, the second official single &quot;This Is All Now&quot; was released on iTunes, with the b-side being an acoustic version of &quot;Ghost Man on Third&quot;. On June 26, 2011, in an interview with Robert Herrera of Punkvideosrock.com, Mark and Shaun stated that the reason they returned to their original lineup was because they no longer felt it was Taking Back Sunday without the original members. Mark stated they were miserable as a band, weren&#x27;t having fun, and didn&#x27;t like the direction the band was going so they decided to reach out to the original members and after meeting with the band in Texas found that &quot;the chemistry was still there.&quot;

On July 8, 2011, Taking Back Sunday released an official music video for &quot;Faith (When I Let You Down)&quot;. On November 3, 2011, Taking Back Sunday released an official music video for &quot;You Got Me&quot;. Taking Back Sunday played Warped Tour 2012 at all locations. In honor of Record Store Day 2012, the band released a limited press vinyl LP entitled &quot;We Play Songs&quot;, featuring four live acoustic tracks.

===&quot;TAYF10&quot; anniversary tour (2012–2013)===
Taking Back Sunday embarked on a &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot; 10th anniversary tour for 2012, during which the band performed their debut album in its entirety. The full US tour featured Bayside as main support, with Transit, Man Overboard and Gabriel the Marine as special guests. An audio and video recording of the acoustic version of the tour was released for digital download through the band&#x27;s website on June 18, 2013.

On June 7, 2013, 2:33PM, Taking Back Sunday took to Twitter to confirm that the recording of their 6th studio album had begun; they tweeted: &quot;Phase one of recording the new record starts now... Happy Friday!&quot; The band, who are working alongside producers Marc Jacob Hudson and Ray Jeffrey, have confirmed that pre-production of the 6th studio record has been completed, and that drum and bass tracking has begun.

On August 29, 2013, Adam Lazzara and John Nolan performed an acoustic set at the Leaky Lifeboat Inn, in Seaford, New York, where they debuted a new song with a working title, &quot;The Bird You Cannot Change&quot;.

From October 25 through November 2, Underoath vocalist Spencer Chamberlain began filling in on lead vocals following the premature birth of Adam Lazzara&#x27;s son. On November 8, Lazzara and Nolan performed at the Staller Center for the Arts at Stony Brook University as an acoustic act. This featured the appearance of a Stony Brook violinist named Dylan Ebrahimian who also will appear on Taking Back Sunday&#x27;s next album due in 2014.

===&quot;Happiness Is&quot;, &quot;Tidal Wave&quot; and departure of Eddie Reyes (2014–2019)===
On January 11, 2014, Taking Back Sunday revealed that a new album, &quot;Happiness Is&quot;, was available for pre-order on iTunes, as was a new track: &quot;Flicker, Fade&quot;. &quot;Happiness Is&quot; was released on March 18, 2014, through Hopeless Records.

On June 27, 2016, the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Tidal Wave&quot;, was announced for release on September 16. Material for the album was written in between tours for &quot;Happiness Is&quot;.

On April 13, 2018, it was announced that founding guitarist Eddie Reyes has parted ways with the band. This was later confirmed by Reyes, stating the reason for his departure was due to his battle with alcoholism and hoped to join the band again in the future. In the meantime, he has also stated to have started a new band.

On the subject of ever touring with previous members of Taking Back Sunday, John Nolan said in an interview: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s something that really interests us. This lineup has been together for three albums now and we&#x27;re really focused on continuing to develop and evolve together. Revisiting old songs with past band members just seem like an exercise in nostalgia.&quot;

On January 11, 2019, the band released a compilation album called &quot;Twenty&quot; to celebrate their 20th anniversary, along with a worldwide tour.

In 2019, for their 20th Anniversary tour, the band employed the use of a specially made coin to flip at shows in locations where they were playing two nights in a row. The coin toss decided the second album to be played the first night of the pair of shows, either &quot;Louder Now&quot; or &quot;Where You Want to Be&quot;. &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot; was played each night.

In December 2019, John Nolan said that the band was not currently on a label, indicating that they left Hopeless Records.

===&quot;152&quot; (2020–present)===
In February 2020, the band returned to the studio to begin work on their eighth studio album. Further sessions were cancelled or otherwise postponed, however, on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2021, Lazzara and Nolan collaborated on a song with Q-Unique, DJ Eclipse and the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s Cappadonna, titled &quot;Verrazzano Villains&quot;. In October 2021, the band shared a cover of the Weezer song &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot;. The band returned to touring in 2022, including UK dates with Alkaline Trio and North American dates in support of My Chemical Romance. Also in 2022, the band reissued &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot; for its 20th anniversary, and released two collaborative singles: &quot;Loved You a Little&quot; with The Maine, and &quot;Just Us Two&quot; with Steve Aoki.

In June 2023, the band released their first original new music in over four years, a single titled &quot;The One&quot;. &quot;152&quot;, the band&#x27;s eighth studio album, was released on October 27, 2023, via Fantasy Records. The band performed at Coachella 2024 in April. On December 7, 2024, Fred Mascherino performed with the band for the first time since 2007, at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey. Mascherino played guitar and sang &quot;Liar (It Takes One to Know One)&quot; and &quot;MakeDamnSure,&quot; trading vocals with Nolan on the latter.

In December 2024, former member Eddie Reyes claimed on a podcast that drummer Mark O&#x27;Connell, who had been in Taking Back Sunday since 2001, was no longer in the band. O&#x27;Connell formally announced his departure on January 7, 2025. He wrote in a statement, &quot;Over the past few years, I’ve focused on my family and personal growth, including committing to my sobriety. Unfortunately, during this time, I didn’t always feel the support I needed from those I thought of as brothers, and creative differences made it hard to move forward together.&quot;

==Musical style and influences==
Taking Back Sunday has been described as emo, post-hardcore, pop-punk, and alternative rock. The band has also veered into the sounds of pop rock, and emo pop. Charles Spano of AllMusic described the band as a &quot;New York-based emo band that blend[s] Southern California post-punk, nu metal and old school hardcore.&quot; Despite this, Lazzara has rejected the labeling of his band as an emo group.

In a 2003 interview, Shaun Cooper stated that there was little overlap between each members&#x27; influences: &quot;Eddie is a big Quicksand fan, John The Smiths and Morrissey, Adam is a big Lifetime fan, Mark loves Hatebreed, and I love punk rock like (...) Rancid, Dropkick, and all those bands. It is just a big mixture.&quot; Shaun Cooper and Mark O&#x27;Connell have also cited Screeching Weasel and the Queers, while John Nolan&#x27;s influences range from Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Built to Spill to the Get Up Kids and the Promise Ring. Jay-Z also significantly impacted Lazarra and Nolan&#x27;s vocal deliveries. During his time with the band, Ed Reyes&#x27; guitar playing drew from Bad Religion guitarist Brian Baker, Walter Schreifels of Quicksand, and the Cure frontman Robert Smith. Since then, Taking Back Sunday have cited Radiohead, Nirvana, the Clash, and Ramones as influences or inspirations.
