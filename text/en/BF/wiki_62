<text>The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is a complex of genes on chromosome 6 in humans that encode cell-surface proteins responsible for regulation of the immune system. The HLA system is also known as the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) found in many animals.

Mutations in HLA genes may be linked to autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes, and celiac disease. The HLA gene complex resides on a 3 Mbp stretch within chromosome 6, p-arm at 21.3. HLA genes are highly polymorphic, which means that they have many different alleles, allowing them to fine-tune the adaptive immune system. The proteins encoded by certain genes are also known as &quot;antigens&quot;, as a result of their historic discovery as factors in organ transplants.

HLAs corresponding to MHC class I (A, B, and C), all of which are the HLA Class1 group, present peptides from inside the cell. For example, if the cell is infected by a virus, the HLA system brings fragments of the virus to the surface of the cell so that the cell can be destroyed by the immune system. These peptides are produced from digested proteins that are broken down in the proteasomes. In general, these particular peptides are small polymers, of about 8-10 amino acids in length. Foreign antigens presented by MHC class I attract T-lymphocytes called killer T-cells (also referred to as CD8-positive or cytotoxic T-cells) that destroy cells. Some new work has proposed that antigens longer than 10 amino acids, 11-14 amino acids, can be presented on MHC I, eliciting a cytotoxic T-cell response. MHC class I proteins associate with β2-microglobulin, which, unlike the HLA proteins, is encoded by a gene on chromosome 15.

HLAs corresponding to MHC class II (DP, DM, DO, DQ, and DR) present antigens from outside of the cell to T-lymphocytes. These particular antigens stimulate multiplication of T-helper cells (also called CD4-positive T cells), which in turn stimulate antibody-producing B-cells to produce antibodies to that specific antigen. Self-antigens are suppressed by regulatory T cells. Predicting which (fragments of) antigens will be presented to the immune system by a certain HLA type is difficult, but the technology involved is improving.

HLAs corresponding to MHC class III encode components of the complement system.

HLAs have other roles. They are important in disease defense. They are the major cause of organ transplant rejection. They may protect against cancers or fail to protect (if down-regulated by an infection). HLA may also be related to people&#x27;s perception of the odor of other people, and may be involved in mate selection, as at least one study found a lower-than-expected rate of HLA similarity between spouses in an isolated community.

Aside from the genes encoding the six major antigen-presenting proteins, many other genes, many involved in immune function, are located on the HLA complex. Diversity of HLAs in the human population is one aspect of disease defense, and, as a result, the chance of two unrelated individuals with identical HLA molecules on all loci is extremely low. HLA genes have historically been identified as a result of the ability to successfully transplant organs between HLA-similar individuals.

==Functions==
The proteins encoded by HLAs are those on the outer part of body cells that are (in effect) unique to that person. The immune system uses the HLAs to differentiate self cells and non-self cells. Any cell displaying that person&#x27;s HLA type belongs to that person and is therefore not an invader.

===In infectious diseases===
When a foreign pathogen enters the body, specific cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs) engulf the pathogen through a process called phagocytosis. Proteins from the pathogen are digested into small pieces (peptides) and loaded on to HLA antigens (to be specific, MHC class II). They are then displayed by the antigen-presenting cells to CD4+ helper T cells, which then produce a variety of effects and cell-to-cell interactions to eliminate the pathogen.

Through a similar process, proteins (both native and foreign, such as the proteins of viruses) produced inside most cells are displayed on HLAs (to be specific, MHC class I) on the cell surface. Infected cells can be recognized and destroyed by CD8+ T cells.

The image off to the side shows a piece of a poisonous bacterial protein (SEI peptide) bound within the binding cleft portion of the HLA-DR1 molecule. In the illustration far below, a different view, one can see an entire DQ with a bound peptide in a similar cleft, as viewed from the side. Disease-related peptides fit into these &quot;slots&quot; much like a hand fits into a glove.

When bound, peptides are presented to T-cells. T-cells require presentation via MHC molecules to recognize foreign antigens—a requirement known as MHC restriction. T-cells have receptors that are similar to B-cell receptors, and each T-cell recognizes only a few MHC class II-peptide combinations. Once a T-cell recognizes a peptide within an MHC class II molecule, it can stimulate B-cells that also recognize the same molecule in their B-cell receptors. Thus, T-cells help B-cells make antibodies to the same foreign antigens. Each HLA can bind many peptides, and each person has 3 HLA types and can have 4 isoforms of DP, 4 isoforms of DQ and 4 Isoforms of DR (2 of DRB1, and 2 of DRB3, DRB4, or DRB5) for a total of 12 isoforms. In such heterozygotes, it is difficult for disease-related proteins to escape detection.

===In graft rejection===
Any cell displaying some other HLA type is &quot;non-self&quot; and is seen as an invader by the body&#x27;s immune system, resulting in the rejection of the tissue bearing those cells. This is particularly important in the case of transplanted tissue, because it could lead to transplant rejection. Because of the importance of HLA in transplantation, the HLA loci are some of the most frequently typed by serology and PCR. It has been shown that high resolution HLA typing (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DPB1) may be relevant in transplantation to identify a full match, even when the donor is related.
===In autoimmunity===
HLA types are inherited, and some of them are connected with autoimmune disorders and other diseases. People with certain HLA antigens are more likely to develop certain autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), myasthenia gravis, inclusion body myositis, Sjögren syndrome, and narcolepsy.

HLA typing has led to some improvement and acceleration in the diagnosis of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes; however, for DQ2 typing to be useful, it requires either high-resolution B1*typing (resolving *02:01 from *02:02), DQA1*typing, or DR serotyping. Current serotyping can resolve, in one step, DQ8. HLA typing in autoimmunity is being increasingly used as a tool in diagnosis. In celiac disease, it is the only effective means of discriminating between first-degree relatives that are at risk from those that are not at risk, prior to the appearance of sometimes-irreversible symptoms such as allergies and secondary autoimmune disease.

===In cancer===
Some HLA-mediated diseases are directly involved in the promotion of cancer. Gluten-sensitive enteropathy is associated with increased prevalence of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, and DR3-DQ2 homozygotes are within the highest risk group, with close to 80% of gluten-sensitive enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma cases. More often, however, HLA molecules play a protective role, recognizing increases in antigens that are not tolerated because of low levels in the normal state. Abnormal cells might be targeted for apoptosis, which is thought to mediate many cancers before diagnosis.

===In mate selection===
There is evidence for non-random mate choice with respect to certain genetic characteristics. This has led to a field known as genetic matchmaking.

==Classification==

MHC class I proteins form a functional receptor on most nucleated cells of the body.

There are three major and three minor MHC class I genes in HLA.

Major MHC class I
* HLA-A
* HLA-B
* HLA-C

Minor genes are HLA-E, HLA-F and HLA-G. β2-microglobulin binds with major and minor gene subunits to produce a heterodimer.

There are three major and two minor MHC class II proteins encoded by the HLA.
The genes of the class II combine to form heterodimeric (αβ) protein
receptors that are typically expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.

Major MHC class II proteins only occur on antigen-presenting cells, B cells, and T cells.
* HLA-DP
** α-chain encoded by HLA-DPA1 locus
** β-chain encoded by HLA-DPB1 locus
* HLA-DQ
** α-chain encoded by HLA-DQA1 locus
** β-chain encoded by HLA-DQB1 locus
* HLA-DR
** α-chain encoded by HLA-DRA locus
** 4 β-chains (only 3 possible per person), encoded by HLA-DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5 loci

The other MHC class II proteins, DM and DO, are used in the internal processing of antigens, loading the antigenic peptides generated from pathogens onto the HLA molecules of antigen-presenting cell.

===Nomenclature===
Modern HLA alleles are typically noted with a variety of levels of detail. Most designations begin with HLA- and the locus name, then * and some (even) number of digits specifying the allele. The first two digits specify a group of alleles, also known as supertypes. Older typing methodologies often could not completely distinguish alleles and so stopped at this level. The third through fourth digits specify a nonsynonymous allele. Digits five through six denote any synonymous mutations within the coding frame of the gene. The seventh and eighth digits distinguish mutations outside the coding region. Letters such as L, N, Q, or S may follow an allele&#x27;s designation to specify an expression level or other non-genomic data known about it. Thus, a completely described allele may be up to 9 digits long, not including the HLA-prefix and locus notation.

===Variability===

MHC loci are some of the most genetically variable coding loci in mammals, and the human HLA loci are no exceptions. Despite the fact that the human population went through a constriction several times during its history that was capable of fixing many loci, the HLA loci appear to have survived such a constriction with a great deal of variation. Of the 9 loci mentioned above, most retained a dozen or more allele-groups for each locus, far more preserved variation than the vast majority of human loci. This is consistent with a heterozygous or balancing selection coefficient for these loci. In addition, some HLA loci are among the fastest-evolving coding regions in the human genome. One mechanism of diversification has been noted in the study of Amazonian tribes of South America that appear to have undergone intense gene conversion between variable alleles and loci within each HLA gene class. Less frequently, longer-range productive recombinations through HLA genes have been noted producing chimeric genes.

Six loci have over 100 alleles that have been detected in the human population. Of these, the most variable are HLA B and HLA DRB1. As of 2012, the number of alleles that have been determined are listed in the table below. To interpret this table, it is necessary to consider that an allele is a variant of the nucleotide (DNA) sequence at a locus, such that each allele differs from all other alleles in at least one (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP) position. Most of these changes result in a change in the amino acid sequences that result in slight to major functional differences in the protein.

There are issues that limit this variation. Certain alleles like DQA1*05:01 and DQA1*05:05 encode proteins with identically processed products. Other alleles like DQB1*0201 and DQB1*0202 produce proteins that are functionally similar. For class II (DR, DP and DQ), amino acid variants within the receptor&#x27;s peptide-binding cleft tend to produce molecules with different binding capability.

However, the gene frequencies of the most common alleles (&gt;5%) of HLA-A, -B, -C and HLA-DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1 from South America have been reported from the typing and sequencing carried out in genetic diversity studies and cases and controls. In addition, information on the allele frequencies of HLA-I and HLA-II genes for the European population has been compiled. In both cases the distribution of allele frequencies reveals a regional variation related with the history of the populations.

====Sequence feature variant type (SFVT)====
The large extent of variability in HLA genes poses significant challenges in investigating the role of HLA genetic variations in diseases. Disease association studies typically treat each HLA allele as a single complete unit, which does not illuminate the parts of the molecule associated with disease. Karp D. R. et al. describes a novel sequence feature variant type (SFVT) approach for HLA genetic analysis that categorizes HLA proteins into biologically relevant smaller sequence features (SFs), and their variant types (VTs). Sequence features are combinations of amino acid sites defined based on structural information (e.g., beta-sheet 1), functional information (e.g., peptide antigen-binding), and polymorphism. These sequence features can be overlapping and continuous or discontinuous in the linear sequence. Variant types for each sequence feature are defined based upon all known polymorphisms in the HLA locus being described. SFVT categorization of HLA is applied in genetic association analysis so that the effects and roles of the epitopes shared by several HLA alleles can be identified. Sequence features and their variant types have been described for all classical HLA proteins; the international repository of HLA SFVTs will be maintained at IMGT/HLA database. A tool to convert HLA alleles into their component SFVTs can be found on the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) website.

====Common, well-documented and rare alleles====
Although the number of individual HLA alleles that have been identified is large, approximately 40% of these alleles appear to be unique, having only been identified in single individuals. Roughly a third of alleles have been reported more than three times in unrelated individuals. Because of this variation in the rate at which of individual HLA alleles are detected, attempts have been made to categorize alleles at each expressed HLA locus in terms of their prevalence. The result is a catalog of common and well-documented (CWD) HLA alleles, and a catalogue of rare and very rare HLA alleles.

Common HLA alleles are defined as having been observed with a frequency of at least 0.001 in reference populations of at least 1500 individuals. Well-documented HLA alleles were originally defined as having been reported at least three times in unrelated individuals, and are now defined as having been detected at least five times in unrelated individuals via the application of a sequence-based typing (SBT) method, or at least three times via a SBT method and in a specific haplotype in unrelated individuals. Rare alleles are defined as those that have been reported one to four times, and very rare alleles as those reported only once.

=====Table of HLA alleles in each prevalence category=====
While the current CWD and rare or very rare designations were developed using different datasets and different versions of the IMGT/HLA Database, the approximate fraction of alleles at each HLA locus in each category is shown below.
===Examining HLA types===
====Serotype and allele names====
There are two parallel systems of nomenclature that are applied to HLA. The first, and oldest, system is based on serological (antibody based) recognition. In this system, antigens were eventually assigned letters and numbers (e.g., HLA-B27 or, shortened, B27). A parallel system that allowed more refined definition of alleles was developed. In this system, an &quot;HLA&quot; is used in conjunction with a letter, *, and a four-or-more-digit number (e.g., HLA-B*08:01, A*68:01, A*24:02:01N N=Null) to designate a specific allele at a given HLA locus. HLA loci can be further classified into MHC class I and MHC class II (or rarely, D locus). Every two years, a nomenclature is put forth to aid researchers in interpreting serotypes to alleles.

====Serotyping====

In order to create a typing reagent, blood from animals or humans would be taken, the blood cells allowed to separate from the serum, and the serum diluted to its optimal sensitivity and used to type cells from other individuals or animals. Thus, serotyping became a way of crudely identifying HLA receptors and receptor isoforms. Over the years, serotyping antibodies became more refined as techniques for increasing sensitivity improved and new serotyping antibodies continue to appear. One of the goals of serotype analysis is to fill gaps in the analysis. It is possible to predict based on &#x27;square root&#x27;,&#x27;maximum-likelihood&#x27; method, or analysis of familial haplotypes to account for adequately typed alleles. These studies using serotyping techniques frequently revealed, in particular for non-European or north East Asian populations many null or blank serotypes. This was particularly problematic for the Cw locus until recently, and almost half of the Cw serotypes went untyped in the 1991 survey of the human population.

There are several types of serotypes. A broad antigen serotype is a crude measure of identity of cells. For example, HLA A9 serotype recognizes cells of A23- and A24-bearing individuals. It may also recognize cells that A23 and A24 miss because of small variations. A23 and A24 are split antigens, but antibodies specific to either are typically used more often than antibodies to broad antigens.

====Cellular typing====
A representative cellular assay is the mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) and used to determine the HLA class II types. The cellular assay is more sensitive in detecting HLA differences than serotyping. This is because minor differences unrecognized by alloantisera can stimulate T cells. This typing is designated as Dw types. Serotyped DR1 has cellularly defined as either of Dw1 or of Dw20 and so on for other serotyped DRs. Table shows associated cellular specificities for DR alleles. However, cellular typing has inconsistency in the reaction between cellular-type individuals, sometimes resulting differently from predicted. Together with difficulty of cellular assay in generating and maintaining cellular typing reagents, cellular assay is being replaced by DNA-based typing method.

====Gene sequencing====
Minor reactions to subregions that show similarity to other types can be observed to the gene products of alleles of a serotype group. The sequence of the antigens determines the antibody reactivities, and so having a good sequencing capability (or sequence-based typing) obviates the need for serological reactions. Therefore, different serotype reactions may indicate the need to sequence a person&#x27;s HLA to determine a new gene sequence.

Broad antigen types are still useful, such as typing very diverse populations with many unidentified HLA alleles (Africa, Arabia, Southeastern Iran and Pakistan, India). Africa, Southern Iran, and Arabia show the difficulty in typing areas that were settled earlier. Allelic diversity makes it necessary to use broad antigen typing followed by gene sequencing because there is an increased risk of misidentifying by serotyping techniques.

In the end, a workshop, based on sequence, decides which new allele goes into which serogroup either by sequence or by reactivity. Once the sequence is verified, it is assigned a number. For example, a new allele of B44 may get a serotype (i.e. B44) and allele ID i.e. B*44:65, as it is the 65th B44 allele discovered. Marsh et al. (2005) can be considered a code book for HLA serotypes and genotypes, and a new book biannually with monthly updates in &quot;Tissue Antigens&quot;.

====Phenotyping====
Gene typing is different from gene sequencing and serotyping.
With this strategy, PCR primers specific to a variant region of DNA are used (called sequence-specific primers). If a product of the right size is found, the assumption is that the HLA allele has been identified. New gene sequences often result in an increasing appearance of ambiguity. Because gene typing is based on SSP-PCR, it is possible that new variants, in particular in the class I and DRB1 loci, may be missed.

For example, SSP-PCR within the clinical situation is often used for identifying HLA phenotypes. An example of an extended phenotype for a person might be:

A*01:01/*03:01, C*07:01/*07:02, B*07:02/*08:01, DRB1*03:01/*15:01, DQA1*05:01/*01:02, DQB1*02:01/*06:02

In general, this is identical to the extended serotype:
A1,A3,B7,B8,DR3,DR15(2), DQ2,DQ6(1)

For many populations, such as the Japanese or European populations, so many patients have been typed that new alleles are relatively rare, and thus SSP-PCR is more than adequate for allele resolution. Haplotypes can be obtained by typing family members in areas of the world where SSP-PCR is unable to recognize alleles and typing requires the sequencing of new alleles. Areas of the world where SSP-PCR or serotyping may be inadequate include Central Africa, Eastern Africa, parts of southern Africa, Arabia, S. Iran, Pakistan, and India.

====Haplotypes====
An HLA haplotype is a series of HLA &quot;genes&quot; (loci-alleles) by chromosome, one passed from the mother and one from the father.

The phenotype exampled above is one of the more common in Ireland and is the result of two common genetic &quot;haplotypes&quot;:

A*01:01 ; C*07:01 ; B*08:01 ; DRB1*03:01 ; DQA1*05:01 ; DQB1*02:01
(By serotyping A1-Cw7-B8-DR3-DQ2)

which is called &#x27; &#x27;super B8&#x27; &#x27; or &#x27; &#x27;ancestral haplotype&#x27; &#x27; and

A*03:01 ; C*07:02 ; B*07:02 ; DRB1*15:01 ; DQA1*01:02 ; DQB1*06:02
(By serotyping A3-Cw7-B7-DR15-DQ6 or the older version &quot;A3-B7-DR2-DQ1&quot;)

These haplotypes can be used to trace migrations in the human population because they are often much like a fingerprint of an event that has occurred in evolution. The Super-B8 haplotype is enriched in the Western Irish, declines along gradients away from that region, and is found only in areas of the world where Western Europeans have migrated. The &quot;A3-B7-DR2-DQ1&quot; is more widely spread, from Eastern Asia to Iberia. The Super-B8 haplotype is associated with a number of diet-associated autoimmune diseases. There are 100,000s of extended haplotypes, but only a few show a visible and nodal character in the human population.

==Role of allelic variation==
Studies of humans and animals imply a heterozygous selection mechanism operating on these loci as an explanation for this variability. One proposed mechanism is sexual selection in which females are able to detect males with different HLA relative to their own type. While the DQ and DP encoding loci have fewer alleles, combinations of A1:B1 can produce a theoretical potential of 7,755 DQ and 5,270 DP αβ heterodimers, respectively. While nowhere near this number of isoforms exist in the human population, each individual can carry 4 variable DQ and DP isoforms, increasing the potential number of antigens that these receptors can present to the immune system.

Studies of the variable positions of DP, DR, and DQ reveal that peptide antigen contact residues on class II molecules are most frequently the site of variation in the protein primary structure. Therefore, through a combination of intense allelic variation and/or subunit pairing, the class II peptide receptors are capable of binding an almost endless variation of peptides of 9 amino acids or longer in length, protecting interbreeding subpopulations from nascent or epidemic diseases. Individuals in a population frequently have different haplotypes, and this results in many combinations, even in small groups. This diversity enhances the survival of such groups, and thwarts evolution of epitopes in pathogens, which would otherwise be able to be shielded from the immune system.

==Antibodies==
HLA antibodies are typically not naturally occurring, and with few exceptions are formed as a result of an immunologic challenge to a foreign material containing non-self HLAs via blood transfusion, pregnancy (paternally inherited antigens), or organ or tissue transplant.

Antibodies against disease-associated HLA haplotypes have been proposed as a treatment for severe autoimmune diseases.

Donor-specific HLA antibodies have been found to be associated with graft failure in renal, heart, lung, and liver transplantation. These donor-specific HLA antibodies can exist pretransplant as consequence of sensitization to prior transplants or through pregnancies, but also occur de novo post-transplantation. There is a clear link between the risk of HLA antibody sensitisation and the donor-recipient HLA (molecular) mismatch.

==HLA matching for sick siblings==

In some diseases requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be used to give rise to a sibling with matching HLA, although there are ethical considerations.

<text>A spinning top, or simply a top, is a toy with a squat body and a sharp point at the bottom, designed to be spun on its vertical axis, balancing on the tip due to the gyroscopic effect.

Once set in motion, a top will usually wobble for a few seconds, spin upright for a while, then start to wobble again with increasing amplitude as it loses energy, and finally tip over and roll on its side.

Tops exist in many variations and materials, chiefly wood, metal, and plastic, often with a metal tip. They may be set in motion by twirling a handle with the fingers, by pulling a rope coiled around the body, or through a built-in auger (spiral plunger).

Such toys have been used since antiquity in solitary or competitive games, where each player tries to keep one&#x27;s top spinning for as long as possible or achieve some other goal. Some tops have faceted bodies with symbols or inscriptions, and are used like dice to inject randomness into games or for divination and ritual purposes.

The ubiquity of spinning tops lends to the fact that the toy is used to name many living things such as &quot;Cyclosa turbinata&quot;, whose name comes from the Latin roots for spinning top.

==History==

===Origins===
Spinning tops emerged independently in various cultures worldwide and are considered among the oldest known toys discovered by archaeologists. They have been unearthed on every continent except Antarctica. For instance, tops dating back to around 1250 BCE were found in China, while a carved wooden top from approximately 2000 BCE was discovered in Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb. Tops were used as toys in ancient Rome. 

Besides toys, tops have also historically been used for gambling and prophecy. Some role-playing games use tops to augment dice in generating randomized results; it is in this case referred to as a spinner.

Gould mentions maple seeds, celts (leading to rattlebacks), the fire-drill, the spindle whorl, and the potter&#x27;s wheel as possible predecessors to the top, which he assumes was invented or discovered multiple times in multiple places.

===Color demonstrations with tops===
A top may be used to demonstrate visual properties, such as by James David Forbes and James Clerk Maxwell in Maxwell&#x27;s disc (see color triangle). By rapidly spinning the top, Forbes created the illusion of a single color that was a mixture of the primaries:

Maxwell took this a step further by using a circular scale around the rim with which to measure the ratios of the primaries, choosing vermilion, emerald, and ultramarine.

==Spinning methods==
===Finger twirling===
Smaller tops have a short stem, and are set in motion by twirling it using the fingers. A thumbtack may also be made to spin on its tip in the same way.

===Strings and whips===

A typical fist-sized model, traditionally made of wood with a blunt iron tip, is meant to be set in motion by briskly pulling a string or rope tightly coiled around the body. The rope is best wound starting near the tip and progressing up along the widening body, so that the tension of the string will remain roughly constant while the top&#x27;s angular speed increases.

These tops may be thrown forward while firmly grasping the end of the string and pulling it back. The forward momentum of the top contributes to the string&#x27;s tension and thus to the final spin rate.

In some throwing styles, the top is thrown upside-down, but the first loop of the rope is wound around a stubby &quot;head&quot;. Then, the sudden yank on the head as the string finishes unwinding causes the spinning top to flip over and land on its tip.

Alternatively, tops of this class may be started by hand but then accelerated and kept in motion by striking them repeatedly with a small whip.

===Augers===
Some larger models are set in motion by means of a built-in metal auger (spiral plunger). In these models, the actual top may be enclosed in a hollow metal shell, with the same axis but decoupled from it; so that the toy may appear to be stationary but &quot;magically&quot; balanced on its tip.

===Magnetic fields===
Some modern tops are kept perpetually in motion by spinning magnetic fields from a special ground plate.

== Notable types ==

Gould classifies tops into six main types: twirler, supported top, peg-top, whip-top, buzzer, and yo-yo.

* Competing tops
** Battling Tops
** Beigoma, in Japan
** Beyblade
** Gasing pangkah, in Malaysia
** Spin Fighters
** Tuj lub, among Hmong people
* Gaming and other tops
**Dreidel, traditionally played during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. 
** Lattu, a throwing top used in India and Bangladesh.
**Levitating top
**Perinola, a six-sided top, very similar to the dreidel, that is used for a similar game in Latin America.
**Rattleback, or celt, a top that reverses its spin direction
**Teetotum
**Tippe top
**Trompo, or &quot;Whipping top&quot;
**Wizzzer

Modern tops have several sophisticated improvements, such as ball bearings of ruby or a hard ceramic like tungsten carbide, that reduces the friction with the ground surface. Functional art tops have become collectibles built using varied techniques in metal-working, glass-working, and wood-working.

==Physics==

The motion of a top is described by equations of rigid body dynamics, specifically the theory of rotating rigid bodies. 

Because of the small contact area between the tip and the underlying surface, and the large rotational inertia of its body, a top that is started on a hard surface will usually keep spinning for tens of seconds or more, even without additional energy input.

Typically the top will at first wobble until friction and torque between the tip and the underlying surface force it to spin with the axis steady and upright. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, longstanding scientific studies (and easy experimentations reproducible by anyone) show that reducing the friction increases the time needed to reach this stable state (unless the top is so unbalanced that it falls over before reaching it). After spinning upright (in the so-called &quot;sleep&quot; position) for an extended period, the angular momentum will gradually lessen (mainly due to friction), leading to ever increasing precession, finally causing the top to topple and roll some distance on its side. In the &quot;sleep&quot; period, and only in it, provided it is ever reached, less friction means longer &quot;sleep&quot; time (whence the common error that less friction implies longer global spinning time).

The total spinning time of a top is generally increased by increasing its moment of inertia and lowering its center of gravity. These variables however are constrained by the need to prevent the body from touching the ground.

Asymmetric tops of virtually any shape can also be created and designed to balance.

An exhaustive description of the mathematics and physics of the top can be found in the four volume monograph of Felix Klein et al.

==Competitions==

There are many official competitions for top spinning as a sport, such as the U. S. National Championships and the World Championships. During the COVID-19 pandemic contests would be often held online, with contestants submitting videos.

== In popular culture ==
The Jean Shepherd story &quot;Scut Farkas and the Murderous Mariah&quot; revolves around top-spinning in the fictional Depression-era American city of Hohman, Indiana. The bully and the named top in the title are challenged by Shepherd&#x27;s ongoing protagonist Ralph and a so-called &quot;gypsy top&quot; of similar design to Mariah named Wolf.

The Top is a short story by bohemian writer Franz Kafka.

Rock band The Cure released The Top album in 1984, named, and at least partially inspired, by the toy of the same name. The album includes the title track in which the sound of a spinning top can be heard at the beginning of the song. 

The top is a focal element and metaphysical symbol in the movie &quot;Inception&quot; (2010), directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Leonardo DiCaprio. In the final shot, the camera moves over the spinning top just before it appears to be wobbling.

In 2022, an Armenian-styled spinning top, with the song &quot;Spin the Magic&quot;, was chosen as the theme art and the main motif for the 20th edition of Junior Eurovision Song Contest, which will be held in Yerevan, Armenia.

<text>An audio format is a medium for sound recording and reproduction. The term is applied to both the physical recording media and the recording formats of the audio content—in computer science it is often limited to the audio file format, but its wider use usually refers to the physical method used to store the data. Note on the use of analog compared to digital in this list; the definition of digital used here for early formats is that which is represented using discrete values rather than fluctuating variables. A piano roll is digital as it has discrete values, that being a hole for each key, unlike a phonograph record which is analog with a fluctuating groove. 

Music is recorded and distributed using a variety of audio formats, some of which store additional information.

<text>Elcaset is a short-lived audio format jointly developed by Sony, Panasonic, and Teac in 1976, building on an idea introduced 20 years earlier in the RCA tape cartridge.

==History==
In 1976, it was widely felt that the compact cassette was never likely to be capable of the same levels of performance that was available from reel-to-reel systems, yet clearly the cassette had advantages in terms of convenience. The Elcaset system was intended to marry the performance of reel-to-reel with cassette convenience, but be more of a compromise on size between the two than the RCA cassette is. The name &quot;Elcaset&quot; may simply mean L-cassette, or large cassette, since the &quot; tape inside is double the &quot; width found in compact cassettes. They were divided into four tracks.

The system is technically sound, but a nearly complete failure in the marketplace, with a very low take-up by a few audiophiles only. Apart from the problem of the bulky cassettes, the performance of compact cassettes had improved dramatically with the use of new materials such as chromium dioxide, Dolby B noise reduction, and better manufacturing quality. For most people, the quality of compact cassettes was adequate, and the benefits of the expensive Elcaset system limited. Audiophiles turned away from Elcaset and towards high-end compact cassette decks from companies like Nakamichi, which began making very high-quality tape decks using the compact audio cassette in late 1973, even three years before the Elcaset was released. The tapes they made could be played on any compact cassette machine. Also, the Elcaset machines were expensive. Elcaset was featured at the 1978 Northern Audio Fair in Harrogate, Yorks (three hotels along Ripon Road) and was to be seen at UK audio retailers in that year but promotion withered towards the end of that year and Elcaset machines were disappearing during early 1979.
The Elcaset system was abandoned in 1980, when all the remaining systems were sold off in Finland.
In 2017, musician Jeremy Heiden released his album &quot;Blue Wicked&quot; on Elcaset, along with several other older formats, including MiniDisc, Digital Compact Cassette, and Compact Cassette.

==Specifications==

The cassette itself looks similar to a compact cassette, only larger—about twice the size. Like the earlier RCA tape cartridge, it contained tape running at , twice the width and twice the speed of a compact cassette, providing greater frequency response and dynamic range with lower high-frequency noise than the compact cassette. Another notable difference from compact cassettes is that the tape is withdrawn from the cassette when run through the transport mechanism so that the manufacturing tolerances of the cassette shell will not affect sound quality. The top-of-the-line Elcaset decks also have all the features of deluxe open-reel decks, such as separate heads for erasing, recording, and playback; remote control, and heavy-duty transports for low wow &amp; flutter.

<text>A dive computer, personal decompression computer or decompression meter is a device used by an underwater diver to measure the elapsed time and depth during a dive and use this data to calculate and display an ascent profile which, according to the programmed decompression algorithm, will give a low risk of decompression sickness. A secondary function is to record the dive profile, warn the diver when certain events occur, and provide useful information about the environment. Dive computers are a development from decompression tables, the diver&#x27;s watch and depth gauge, with greater accuracy and the ability to monitor dive profile data in real time.

Most dive computers use real-time ambient pressure input to a decompression algorithm to indicate the remaining time to the no-stop limit, and after that has passed, the minimum decompression required to surface with an acceptable risk of decompression sickness. Several algorithms have been used, and various personal conservatism factors may be available. Some dive computers allow for gas switching during the dive, and some monitor the pressure remaining in the scuba cylinders. Audible alarms may be available to warn the diver when exceeding the no-stop limit, the maximum operating depth for the gas mixture, the recommended ascent rate, decompression ceiling, or other limit beyond which risk increases significantly.

The display provides data to allow the diver to avoid decompression, or to decompress relatively safely, and includes depth and duration of the dive. This must be displayed clearly, legibly, and unambiguously at all light levels. Several additional functions and displays may be available for interest and convenience, such as water temperature and compass direction, and it may be possible to download the data from the dives to a personal computer via cable or wireless connection. Data recorded by a dive computer may be of great value to the investigators in a diving accident, and may allow the cause of an accident to be discovered.

Dive computers may be wrist-mounted or fitted to a console with the submersible pressure gauge. A dive computer is perceived by recreational scuba divers and service providers to be one of the most important items of safety equipment. It is one of the most expensive pieces of diving equipment owned by most divers. Use by professional scuba divers is also common, but use by surface-supplied divers is less widespread, as the diver&#x27;s depth is monitored at the surface by pneumofathometer and decompression is controlled by the diving supervisor. Some freedivers use another type of dive computer to record their dive profiles and give them useful information which can make their dives safer and more efficient, and some computers can provide both functions, but require the user to select which function is required.

== Purpose ==
The primary purpose of a decompression computer is to facilitate safe decompression by an underwater diver breathing a suitable gas at ambient pressure, by providing information based on the recent pressure exposure history of the diver that allows an ascent with acceptably low risk of developing decompression sickness. Dive computers address the same problem as decompression tables, but are able to perform a continuous calculation of the theoretical partial pressure of inert gases in the body based on the actual depth and time profile of the diver and the decompression model used by the computer. As the dive computer automatically measures depth and time, it is able to warn of excessive ascent rates and missed decompression stops and the diver has less reason to carry a separate dive watch and depth gauge. Many dive computers also provide additional information to the diver including ambient temperature, partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas at ambient pressure, accumulated oxygen toxicity exposure data, a computer-readable dive log, and the pressure of the remaining breathing gas in the diving cylinder. This recorded information can be used for the diver&#x27;s personal log of their activities or as important information in medical review or legal cases following diving accidents.

Because of the computer&#x27;s ability to continually re-calculate based on changing data, the diver benefits by being able to remain underwater for longer periods at acceptable risk. For example, a recreational diver who plans to stay within &quot;no-decompression stop&quot; limits can in many cases simply ascend a few feet each minute, while continuing the dive, and still remain within reasonably safe limits, rather than adhering to a pre-planned bottom time and then ascending directly. Multi-level dives can be pre-planned with traditional dive tables or personal computer and smartphone apps, or on the fly using waterproof dive tables, but the additional calculations become complex, and the plan may be cumbersome to follow, and the risk of errors rises with profile complexity. Computers allow for a certain amount of spontaneity during the dive, and automatically take into account deviations from the dive plan.

Dive computers are used to safely calculate decompression schedules in recreational, scientific, and military diving operations. There is no reason to assume that they cannot be valuable tools for commercial diving operations, especially on multi-level dives.

== Components ==

Some components are common to all models of dive computer as they are essential to the basic function:















Additional components may be necessary for additional or extended features and functionality.














== Function ==

Dive computers are battery-powered computers within a watertight and pressure resistant case. These computers track the dive profile by measuring time and pressure. All dive computers measure the ambient pressure to model the concentration of gases in the tissues of the diver. More advanced dive computers provide additional measured data and user input into the calculations, for example, the water temperature, gas composition, altitude of the water surface, or the remaining pressure in the diving cylinder. Dive computers suitable for calculating decompression for rebreather diving need to measure the oxygen partial pressure in the breathing loop. A dive computer may be used as the control unit for an electronically controlled closed circuit rebreather, in which case it will calculate oxygen partial pressure in the loop using the output from more than one oxygen sensor.

The computer uses the pressure and time input in a decompression algorithm to estimate the partial pressure of inert gases that have been dissolved in the diver&#x27;s tissues. Based on these calculations, the computer estimates when a risk-free direct ascent to the surface is no longer possible, and what decompression stops would be needed based on the profile of the dive up to that time and recent hyperbaric exposures which may have left residual dissolved gases in the diver.

Many dive computers are able to produce a low risk decompression schedule for dives that take place at altitude, which requires longer decompression than for the same profile at sea level, because the computers measure the atmospheric pressure before the dive and take this into account in the algorithm. Many dive computers continuously monitor the pressure as long as the battery has a charge, so when divers travel before or after diving and particularly when they fly, they should transport their dive computer with them in the same pressure regime (carry on baggage, not checked in and carried in the hold) so that the computer can measure the pressure profile that their body has undergone and take it into account in consequent dives. Older computers that are powered down completely when switched off will not benefit by this process.

Many computers have some way for the user to adjust decompression conservatism. This may be by way of a &quot;personal factor&quot;, which makes an undisclosed change to the algorithm arbitrarily decided by the manufacturer, or the setting of gradient factors, a way of reducing the permitted supersaturation of tissue compartments by specific ratios, which is well defined in the literature, leaving the responsibility for making informed decisions on personal safety to the diver.

=== Algorithms ===
The decompression algorithms used in dive computers vary between manufacturers and computer models. Examples of decompression algorithms are the Bühlmann algorithms and their variants, the Thalmann VVAL18 Exponential/Linear model, the Varying Permeability Model, and the Reduced Gradient Bubble Model. The proprietary names for the algorithms do not always clearly describe the actual decompression model. The algorithm may be a variation of one of the standard algorithms, for example, several versions of the Bühlmann decompression algorithm are in use. The algorithm used may be an important consideration in the choice of a dive computer. Dive computers using the same internal electronics and algorithms may be marketed under a variety of brand names.

The algorithm used is intended to inform the diver of a decompression profile that will keep the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) to an acceptable level. Researchers use experimental diving programmes or data that has been recorded from previous dives to validate an algorithm. The dive computer measures depth and time, then uses the algorithm to determine decompression requirements or estimate remaining no-stop times at the current depth. An algorithm takes into account the magnitude of pressure reduction, breathing gas changes, repetitive exposures, rate of ascent, and time at altitude. Algorithms are not able to reliably account for age, previous injury, ambient temperature, body type, alcohol consumption, dehydration, and other factors such as patent foramen ovale, because the effects of these factors have not been experimentally quantified, though some may attempt to compensate for these by factoring in user input, and for diver peripheral temperature and workload by having sensors that monitor ambient temperature and cylinder pressure changes as a proxy. Water temperature is known to be a poor proxy for body temperature, as it does not account for the effectiveness of the diving suit or heat generated by work or active heating systems.

====Choice of algorithm====

There is no conclusive evidence that any currently used algorithm is significantly better than the others, and by selective setting of the constants, most of them can be made to produce very similar ascent and decompression profiles for a given ingassing profile. When used in the recreational diving range of no-stop exposures on factory settings, it is likely that they are all acceptably safe, though some will clearly be more conservative than others. The question of whether the diver gains anything of value from the higher conservatism is an open question, when the rate of symptomatic decompression sicknesss is very low and the external risk factors are not yet amenable to computational analysis. Some manufacturers use their unverified and undisclosed modified algorithms as selling points, usually without making any specific claims about their effectiveness, and the user is in no position to make an educated choice due to the vagueness of the claims.

* Shearwater: Bühlmann ZH-L16C with optional VPM-B, VPM-B/GFS and DCIEM. The standard package is Bühlmann with user selectable gradient factors, and the option to enable VPM software which may be used in open-circuit tech and rebreather modes, or enable DCIEM which may be used in air and single-gas nitrox modes. VPM-B/GFS is a combination of the two models which applies the ceiling from the more conservative model for each stop. The current decompression ceiling may be displayed as an option and the algorithm will calculate decompression at any depth below the ceiling. The GFS option is a hybrid that automatically chooses the decompression ceiling from the more conservative of the VPM-B profile and a Bühlmann ZH-L16C profile. For the Bühlmann profile a single gradient factor is used, adjustable over a range of 70% (most conservative) to 99% (least conservative), the default is 90%. The DCIEM model differs from ZH-L16C and VPM which are parallel models and assume that all compartments are exposed to ambient partial pressures and no gas interchange occurs between compartments. A serial model assumes that the diffusion takes place through a series of compartments, and only one is exposed to the ambient partial pressures.
* Suunto: RGBM based algorithm with conservatism settings, known to be a comparatively conservative algorithm. There are various versions used in different models. The technical computers use an algorithm that claims flexibility through the use of continuous decompression, which means the current ceiling is displayed instead of a stop depth.

:Shearwater Research has supplied dive computers to the US Navy with an exponential/linear algorithm based on the Thalmann algorithm since Cochran Undersea Technology closed down after the death of the owner. This algorithm is not as of 2024 available to the general public on Shearwater computers, although the algorithm is freely available and known to be lower risk than the Buhlmann algorithm for mixed gas and constant set-point CCR diving at deeper depths, which is the primary market for Shearwater products.

=== Display information ===


Dive computers provide a variety of visual dive information to the diver, usually on a LCD or OLED display. More than one screen arrangement may be selectable during a dive, and the primary screen will display by default and contain the safety critical data. Secondary screens are usually selected by pressing one or two buttons one or more times, and may be transient or remain visible until another screen is selected. All safety critical information should be visible on any screen that will not automatically revert within a short period, as the diver may forget how to get back to it and this may put them as significant risk. Some computers use a scroll through system which tends to require more button pushes, but is easier to remember, as eventually the right screen will turn up, others may use a wider selection of buttons, which is quicker when the sequence is known, but easier to forget or become confused, and may demand more of the diver&#x27;s attention, :

Most dive computers display the following basic dive profile and no-stop status information during the dive. This information includes safety critical information, and is usually displayed on the default underwater display, and some may be shown on all underwater displays:
*Current depth (derived from ambient pressure).
*Maximum depth reached on the current dive.
*No-stop time, the time remaining at the current depth without the need for decompression stops on ascent.
*Elapsed dive time of the current dive.

Many dive computers also display additional information. Some of this is safety-critical for decompression, and would usually be displayed on all screens available underwater, or have a timed default return to the primary screen: Most of the non-critical information is likely to be useful on at least some dives, and may be displayed on a secondary screen layout which can be selected during the dive.
*Total ascent time, or time to surface (TTS) assuming immediate ascent at recommended rate, and decompression stops as indicated. When multiple gases are enabled in the computer, the time to surface may be predicted based on the optimum gas being selected, during ascent, but the actual time to surface will depend on the actual gas selected, and may be longer than the displayed value. This does not invalidate the decompression calculation, which accounts for the actual exposure and gas selected.
*Required decompression stop depth and time, also assuming immediate ascent at recommended rate. The depth and duration of the first stop are usually displayed prominently.
*Ambient temperature, (actually temperature of the pressure transducer). This may be a default display or a user selected setting, and may not be on the primary display, as it is not safety-critical information.
*Current ascent rate. This may be displayed as an actual speed of ascent, or a relative rate compared to the recommended rate.
*Dive profile (often not displayed during the dive, but transmitted to a personal computer). Not a safety-critical information, so usually on a temporary secondary display if available
*Gas mixture in use, as selected by the user. 
*Oxygen partial pressure at current depth, based on selected gas mixture.
*Cumulative oxygen toxicity exposure (CNS), computed from measured pressure and time and selected gas mixture.
*Battery charge status or low battery warning.
*Time of day, often with a 12hour or 24 hour format option.
*Compass heading, using a flux gate sensor, with tilt corrections. When available this is usually combined with displays of all safety critical data, so that it does not have to automatically revert to the primary display layout.

A few computers will display additional information on decompression status after the no-stop limit has been exceeded. These data may be selected as optional display settings by the diver, and may require a more comprehensive understanding of decompression theory and modelling than provided by recreational diver training. They are intended as information that may help a technical diver make a more informed decision while dealing with a contingency that affects decompression risk. 
*At depth + 5 minutes, (@+5), shows the effect on time to surface of remaining at the current depth on the current breathing gas for five more minutes. The display will show the amended TTS.
*Delta + 5 (Δ+5) is the change in time to surface if remaining at the same depth on the same gas for 5 minutes longer. This value will be positive if ingassing, negative if outgassing, and 0 if the extra exposure has no net effect on computed decompression obligation. This is useful for multi-level dives, where it helps estimate whether there will still be enough breathing gas for the ascent.
*Decompression ceiling, the depth at which calculated supersaturation of the controlling tissue is at the maximum permissible level according to the algorithm. This is the shallowest depth to which the diver can ascend with acceptable decompression risk according to the chosen constraints. This depth will be equal to or shallower than the current obligatory stop depth and deeper than the next obligatory stop. When decompression is completed, the ceiling will be zero.
*Current gradient factor (GF99), an indication of the diver&#x27;s current proximity to the baseline M-value of the algorithm in the limiting tissue. If it exceeds 100% then the diver is oversaturated according to the algorithm&#x27;s least conservative setting. This value will slowly decrease at each decompression stop, and increase during the ascent to the next stop. This functionality may be useful in a contingency when the diver needs to exit the water as soon as possible but at a reasonable decompression risk. Responsible use of this feature requires a good understanding of the theory of decompression and how it is modeled by the computer.
*Surfacing gradient factor, The calculated gradient factor for the controlling tissue if the diver were to surface directly from the current depth, without any stops. The figure shown is a percentage of the calculated M-value at that stage of the dive. If it exceeds 99%, the risk of DCS is higher than for the baseline M-value, and if lowe, then the risk is lower than for the baseline M-value, When indicated decompression clears, it will be at the GF-Hi value the diver selected, This is an optional way of monitoring decompression status which could be useful in an emergency.

Some computers, known as air-integrated, or gas-integrated, are designed to display information from a diving cylinder pressure sensor, such as:
*Gas pressure.
*Estimated remaining air time (RAT) based on available gas, rate of gas consumption and ascent time.

Some computers can provide a real time display of the oxygen partial pressure in the rebreather. This requires an input from an oxygen cell. These computers will also calculate cumulative oxygen toxicity exposure based on measured partial pressure.

Some computers can display a graph of the current tissue saturation for several tissue compartments, according to the algorithm in use.

Some information, which has no practical use during a dive, is only shown at the surface to avoid an information overload of the diver during the dive:
*&quot;Time to Fly&quot; display showing when the diver can safely board an airplane.
*Desaturation time, the estimated time required to return all tissues to surface pressure dissolved gas equilibrium.
*A log of key information about previous dives – date, start time, maximum depth, duration, and possibly others.
*Maximum non-decompression bottom times for subsequent dives based on the estimated residual concentration of the inert gases in the tissues.
*Dive planning functions (no decompression time based on current tissue loads and user-selected depth and breathing gas).

Warnings and alarms may include:
*Maximum operating depth exceeded
*No decompression limit approaching
*No decompression limit exceeded
*Excessive ascent rate
*Decompression ceiling violation
*Omitted decompression
*Low cylinder pressure (where applicable)
*Oxygen partial pressure high or low
*Maximum depth violation

=== Audible information ===
Many dive computers have warning buzzers that warn the diver of events such as:
* Excessive ascent rates.
* Missed decompression stops.
* Maximum operation depth exceeded.
* Oxygen toxicity limits exceeded.
* Decompression ceiling violation, or stop depth violation
Some buzzers can be turned off to avoid the noise.

=== Data sampling, storage and upload ===
Data sampling rates generally range from once per second to once per 30 seconds, though there have been cases where a sampling rate as low as once in 180 seconds has been used. This rate may be user selectable. Depth resolution of the display generally ranges between 1m and 0.1m. The recording format for depth over the sampling interval could be maximum depth, depth at the sampling time, or the average depth over the interval. For a small interval these will not make a significant difference to the calculated decompression status of the diver, and are the values at the point where the computer is carried by the diver, which is usually a wrist or suspended on a console, and may vary in depth differently to the depth of the demand valve, which determines breathing gas pressure, which is the relevant pressure for decompression computation.

Temperature resolution for data records varies between 0.1 °C to 1 °C. Accuracy is generally not specified, and there is often a lag of minutes as the sensor temperature changes to follow the water temperature. Temperature is measured at the pressure sensor, and is needed primarily to provide correct pressure data, so it is not a high priority for decompression monitoring to give the precise ambient temperature in real time.

Data storage is limited by internal memory, and the amount of data generated depends on the sampling rate. Capacity may be specified in hours of run time, number of dives recorded, or both. Values of up to 100 hours were available by 2010. This may be influenced by sampling rate selected by the diver.

By 2010, most dive computers had the ability to upload the data to a PC or smartphone, by cable, infrared or Bluetooth wireless connection.

== Special purpose dive computers ==

Some dive computers are able to calculate decompression schedules for breathing gases other than air, such as nitrox, pure oxygen, trimix or heliox. The more basic nitrox dive computers only support one or two gas mixes for each dive. Others support many different mixes. When multiple gases are supported, there may be an option to set those which will be carried on the dive as active, which sets the computer to calculate the decompression schedule and time to surface based on the assumption that the active gases will be used when they are optimal for decompression. Calculation of tissue gas loads will generally follow the gas actually selected by the diver, unless there is multiple cylinder pressure monitoring to enable automatic gas selection by the computer.

Most dive computers calculate decompression for open circuit scuba where the proportions of the breathing gases are constant for each mix: these are &quot;constant fraction&quot; dive computers. Other dive computers are designed to model the gases in closed circuit scuba (diving rebreathers), which maintain constant partial pressures of gases by varying the proportions of gases in the mixture: these are &quot;constant partial pressure&quot; dive computers. These may be switched over to constant fraction mode if the diver bails out to open circuit. There are also dive computers which monitor oxygen partial pressure in real time in combination with a user nominated diluent mixture to provide a real-time updated mix analysis which is then used in the decompression algorithm to provide decompression information.

===Freediving computers===

A freediving computer, or general purpose dive computer in freediving mode, will record breath hold dive details automatically while the diver is underwater, and the length of the surface interval between dives. It records each dive, so there is a record of the number of dives. This is useful to ensure adequate surface interval to clear carbon dioxide buildup.

Surface interval times are also useful to monitor to avoid taravana, the freediving decompression sickness. A dive computer is also the most effective way to notify the diver of the depth at which free-fall should start by a free-fall alarm. monitoring descent and ascent speed, and verifying maximum depth are also useful when training for efficiency. 

Two types of freediving computer are available, the ones that are dedicated to freediving, and those that are also scuba decompression computers, with a freediving mode. A stopwatch is useful for timing static apnea, rechargeable batteries are an option in some models, and GPS can be useful for spearfishers who wish to mark a place and return to it later. A few models offer a heart rate monitor.

== Additional functionality and features ==


Some dive computers provide additional functionality, generally a subset of those listed below:
* Breathing gas oxygen analyser
* Electronic compass
* Gas blending calculator
* Global navigation satellite receiver (only works at the surface)
* Light-meter
* Lunar phase indicator (useful for estimating tidal conditions)
* Magnetometer (for detecting ferrous metal)
* Pitch and roll angle
* Stopwatch
* Time of day in a second time zone
* Time to surface after another 5 minutes at current depth on current gas.
* Gauge mode (overrides decompression monitoring, and just records and displays depth and time and leaves the diver to control decompression by following tables). Selecting gauge mode may reset the tissue saturation records to default, which invalidates any further decompression calculations until the diver has fully desaturated.
* (AI), also known as : – Some dive computers are designed to measure, display, and monitor pressure in one or more diving cylinders. The computer is either connected to the first stage by a high pressure hose, or uses a wireless on the regulator first stage to provide a wireless data signal indicating remaining cylinder pressure, The signals are encoded to eliminate the risk of one diver&#x27;s computer picking up a signal from another diver&#x27;s transducer, or interference from other sources. Some dive computers can receive a signal from more than one remote pressure transducer. The Ratio iX3M Tech and others can process and display pressures from up to 10 transmitters.
* Workload modification of decompression algorithm based on gas consumption rate from integrated gas pressure monitor.
* Heart rate monitor from remote transducer. This can also be used to modify the decompression algorithm to allow for an assumed workload.
* Graphic display of calculated tissue compartment inert gas tensions during and after the dive.
* Indication of computed decompression ceiling in addition to the more usual next stop depth. The effects on decompression risk of following the ceiling rather than remaining below the stop depth is not known, but stop depths are arbitrarily chosen for the calculation of decompression tables, and time spent at any depth below the indicated ceiling depth is processed by the same algorithm.
* Display of supersaturation of limiting tissue as a percentage of M-value in the event of an immediate ascent. This is an indicator of decompression risk in the event of an emergency ascent.
* Display of current supersaturation of limiting tissue as a percentage of M-value during ascent. This is an indication of decompression stress and risk in real time.
* Multiple active gases for open circuit and closed circuit diluent. 
* Deactivation of gas options during dive in case of lost gas. This will trigger the computer to recalculate the estimated time to surface without the deactivated gases. 
* Definition of a new gas during the dive to allow calculations for decompression on gas supplied by another diver.
* Battery charge status.
* Alternative decompression algorithms.
Features and accessories of some models:
* Piezo-electric buttons (no moving parts)
* User input by directional tapping 
* Rechargeable batteries.
* Wireless charging.
* Optional battery types. For example the Shearwater Perdix and Petrel 2 can use 1.5V alkaline cells or 3.6V lithium cells provided they have the same physical format (AA).
* User changeable batteries.
* Battery redundancy.
* User selected display colours (useful for the colour-blind), and variable brightness.
* Screen inversion for ambidextrous use of units with plug-in cable connections for oxygen monitors.
* Mask or mouthpiece mounted head-up display. (NERD)
* Wireless downloading of dive log data.
* Firmware upgrades over the Internet via Bluetooth or USB cable from smart phone or personal computer.
* Display prompts for changing settings.
* Twin straps or bungee straps for improved security.
* Strap extensions for wristwatch format computers to allow for fitting over the forearm on bulky diving suits.
* Aftermarket straps, for improved security.
* Screen protectors, in the form of a self-adhesive transparent plastic film or a rigid transparent plastic cover.
* Software for downloading, display and analysis of logged data. Most downloadable dive computers have a proprietary application, and many can also interface with open source software such as Subsurface. Some can down and upload via a smartphone to the cloud.

===Housed smartphones===
Smartphones in underwater housings running a decopression monitoring app may be able to take photos or video as well, provided the housing is suitable.

== Safety and reliability ==
The ease of use of dive computers can allow divers to perform complex dives with little planning. Divers may rely on the computer instead of dive planning and monitoring. Dive computers are intended to reduce risk of decompression sickness, and allow easier monitoring of the dive profile. Where present, breathing gas integration allows easier monitoring of remaining gas supply, and warnings can alert the diver to some high risk situations, but the diver remains responsible for planning and safe execution of the dive plan. The computer cannot guarantee safety, and only monitors a fraction of the situation. The diver must remain aware of the rest by personal observation and attention to the ongoing situation. A dive computer can also fail during a dive, due to malfunction or misuse.

=== Failure modes and probability of failure ===
It is possible for a dive computer to malfunction during a dive. Manufacturers are not obliged to publish reliability statistics, and generally only include a warning in the user manual that they are used at the diver&#x27;s own risk. Reliability has markedly improved over time, particularly for the hardware.

==== Hardware failures ====
Mechanical and electrical failures: 
* Leaks allowing ingress of water to the electronic components, may be caused by:
** Cracked faceplate, which is more likely with hard, scratch-resistant glass and sapphire used on watch format units. They are strong, but brittle, and can shatter under impact with a sufficiently hard point contact. 
** Seal failures can occur at joints, probably most often at the battery closure, as it is usually the most often disturbed. Computers with user serviceable batteries often use a double O-ring barrel seal to provide a more reliable seal.
* Button failures are one of the more frequent problems, some models are particularly susceptible. Occasionally the failure is in the form of leaks, but more often the switch fails open, which is sometimes a fatigue problem. Pressure sensitive switches with no moving parts are sometimes used to avoid this problem. 
* Circuitry failures, other than switch failures, often due to water or battery leaks causing internal corrosion.
* Battery failure, such as running down unexpectedly, leaking, or failing to charge properly. Internal rechargeable batteries exchange a lower risk of water leaks for a higher risk of battery degradation over time.
* Non-rechargeable lithium batteries can explode if incorrectly used in a dive computer with charging facilities.
==== Software failures and reliability issues==== 
There have been several instances where dive computers have been recalled due to significant safety issues in the software or factory calibration. Earlier dive computers had to have software upgrades at the factory or an approved agent. This has changed and as of 2024, it is common to be able to update firmware over the internet, via bluetooth or a similar procedure.

A series of Uwatec Aladin Air X NitrOx dive computers made in 1995 was recalled in 2003 due to faulty software which miscalculated desaturation time, leading to at least seven cases of DCS attributed to their use. This is not the only recall for faulty software or calibration, Suunto D6 and D9s were recalled in 2006, Oceanic Versa Pro 2A in 2006, and Dacor Darwin computers in 2005, but no injuries were reported, and the units were recalled relatively soon after the problems were reported. The Uwatec Aladin Air X Nitrox recall occurred during a class action suit and after several related lawsuits against the company and several alleged cover-ups, starting as early as 1996. The case was settled on the eve of trial.

=== Inherent risk ===
The main problem in establishing decompression algorithms for both dive computers and production of decompression tables, is that the gas absorption and release under pressure in the human body is still not completely understood. Furthermore, the risk of decompression sickness also depends on the physiology, fitness, condition and health of the individual diver. The safety record of most dive computers indicates that when used according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions, and within the recommended depth range, the risk of decompression sickness is low.

Personal settings to adjust conservatism of the algorithm are available for most dive compters. They may be input as undisclosed personal factors, as reductions to M-values by a fixed ratio, by gradient factor, or by selecting a bubble size limit in VPM and RGBM models. The personal settings for recreational computers tend to be additional to the conservatism factors programmed into the algorithm by the manufacturer. Technical diving computers tend to allow a wider range of choice at the user&#x27;s discretion, and provide warnings that the diver should ensure that they understand what they are doing and the associated risk before adjusting from the moderately conservative factory settings.

=== Human error ===

Many dive computers have menus, various selectable options and various display modes, which are controlled by a small number of buttons. Control of the computer display differs between manufacturers and in some cases between models by the same manufacturer. The diver may need information not displayed on the default screen during a dive, and the button sequence to access the information may not be immediately obvious. If the diver becomes familiar with the control of the computer on dives where the information is not critical before relying on it for more challenging dives there is less risk of confusion which may lead to an accident.

Most dive computers are supplied with default factory settings for algorithm conservatism, and maximum oxygen partial pressure, which are acceptably safe in the opinion of the manufacturer&#x27;s legal advisors. Some of these may be changed to user preferences, which will affect risk. The user manual will generally provide instructions for adjusting and resetting to factory default, with some information on how to choose appropriate user settings. Responsibility for appropriate use of user settings lies with the user who makes or authorises the settings. There is a risk of the user making inappropriate choices due to lack of understanding or input error.

In some cases it can be easy to select the wrong setting by accidentally double pressing the same button with cold fingers encased in thick gloves. The process of correcting the setting can be unfamiliar and take a considerably greater number of buttons pressed at a time when there are other important matters to attend to. An example of this type of error would be accidentally selecting oxygen as the breathing gas instead of a travel gas because oxygen is at the top of the gas options list. This is an error that must be corrected as soon as possible as it will set off alarms and cause unsafe decompression calculation errors. Confirmation messages during gas switches can reduce the risk of user error at the cost of an extra button press.

=== Management and mitigation strategies ===
If the diver has been monitoring decompression status and is within the no-decompression limits, a computer failure can be acceptably managed by simply surfacing at the recommended ascent rate, and if possible, doing a short safety stop near the surface. If, however the computer could fail while the diver has a decompression obligation, or cannot make a direct ascent, some form of backup is prudent. The dive computer can be considered safety-critical equipment when there is a significant decompression obligation, as failure without some form of backup system can expose the diver to a risk of severe injury or death.

The diver may carry a backup dive computer. The probability of both failing at the same time is orders of magnitude lower. Use of a backup which is the same model as the primary simplifies use and reduces the probability of user error, particularly under stress, but makes the equipment redundancy less statistically independent. Statistics for failure rates of dive computers do not appear to be publicly available.

If diving to a well regulated buddy system where both divers follow closely matched dive profiles, using the same gases, the buddy&#x27;s dive computer may be sufficient backup.

A dive profile can be planned before the dive, and followed closely to allow reversion to the planned schedule if the computer fails. This implies the availability of a backup timer and depth gauge, or the schedule will be useless. It also requires the diver to follow the planned profile conservatively. 

Some organisations such as the American Academy of Underwater Sciences have recommended that a dive plan should be established before the dive and then followed throughout the dive unless the dive is aborted. This dive plan should be &quot;within the limits of the decompression tables&quot; to increase the margin of safety, and to provide a backup decompression schedule based on the dive tables in case the computer fails underwater. The disadvantage of this extremely conservative use of dive computers is that when used this way, the dive computer is merely used as a bottom timer, and the advantages of real time computation of decompression status – the original purpose of dive computers – are sacrificed. This recommendation is not in the 2018 version of the &quot;AAUS Standards for Scientific diving: Manual&quot;.

A diver wishing to further reduce the risk of decompression sickness can take additional precautionary measures, such as one or more of: 
* Use a dive computer with a relatively conservative decompression model.
* Induce additional conservatism in the algorithm by selecting a more conservative personal setting or using a higher altitude setting than the actual dive altitude indicates. 
* Add additional deep safety stops during a deep dive (the efficacy of this approach has not been supported by experiment)
* Make a slow ascent. This will reduce decompression stress in the earlier parts of the ascent, but will make the total time to surface longer if the decompression stress later in the ascent is not to be increased.
* Add additional shallow safety stops, or stay longer at the stops than required by the computer
* Have a long surface interval between dives. This will decrease risk provided the outgassing calculations of the algorithm are accurate or conservative.
* If using a backup computer, run one on a low conservatism setting as an indication of fastest acceptable risk ascent for an emergency, and the other at the diver&#x27;s preferred conservatism for personally acceptable risk when there is no contingency and no rush to surface. The diver can always elect to do more decompression than indicated as necessary by the computer for a lower risk of decompression sickness without incurring a penalty for later dives. Some dive computers can be set to a different gradient factor during a dive, which has the same effect if the diver can remember under stress how to make the adjustment, and some computers can be set to display the maximum tissue supersaturation value for an immediate ascent.
* Continue to breathe oxygen enriched gas after surfacing, either in the water while waiting for the boat, after exiting the water, or both.

=== Management of violations ===

Violations of the safety limits as indicated by the computer display may occur during a dive for various reasons, including user error and circumstances beyond the diver&#x27;s control. How this is handled depends on the decompression model, how the algorithm implements the model, and how the manufacturer chooses to interpret and apply the violation criteria.

Many computers go into a &quot;lockout mode&quot; for 24 to 48 hours if the diver violates the safety limits set by the manufacturer, to discourage continued diving after what the manufacturer deems an unsafe dive. Once in lockout mode, these computers will not function until the lockout period has ended. This is usually a reasonable response if lockout is initiated after the dive, as the algorithm will have been used out of scope and the manufacturer will reasonably prefer to avoid further responsibility for its use until tissues can be considered desaturated. When lockout happens underwater it will leave the diver without any decompression information at the time when it is most needed. For example, the Apeks Quantum will stop displaying the depth if the 100 m depth limit is exceeded, but will lock out 5 minutes after surfacing for a missed decompression stop. The Scubapro/Uwatec Galileo technical trimix computer will switch to gauge mode at 155 m after a warning, after which the diver will get no decompression information. Other computers, for example Delta P&#x27;s VR3, Cochran NAVY, and the Shearwater range will continue to function, providing &#x27;best guess&#x27; functionality while warning the diver that a stop has been missed, or a ceiling violated.

Some dive computers are extremely sensitive to violations of indicated decompression stop depth. The HS Explorer is programmed to credit time spent even slightly (0.1 metre) above the indicated stop depth at only 1/60 of the nominal rate. There is no theoretical or experimental basis claimed as justification for this hard limit. Others, such as the Shearwater Perdix, will fully credit any decompression done below the calculated decompression ceiling, which may be displayed as a user selectable option, and is always equal to or shallower than the indicated stop depth. This strategy is supported by the mathematics of the model, but little experimental evidence is available on the practical consequences, so a warning is provided. A violation of the computed decompression ceiling elicits an alarm, which self cancels if the diver immediately descends below the ceiling. The Ratio iX3M will provide a warning if the indicated stop depth is violated by 0.1 m or more, but it is not clear how the algorithm is affected. In many cases the user manual does not provide information on how sensitive the algorithm is to precise depth, what penalties may be incurred by minor discrepancies, or what theoretical basis justifies the penalty. Over-reaction to stop depth violation puts the diver at an unnecessary disadvantage if there is an urgent need to surface, and no computer can guarantee freedom from decompression sickness even if the displayed surfacing profile is followed exactly.

More complex functionality is accompanied by more complex code, which is more likely to include undiscovered errors, particularly in non-critical functions, where testing may not be so rigorous. The trend is to be able to download firmware updates online to eliminate bugs as they are found and corrected. In earlier computers, some errors required factory recall.

There are circumstances in which a lockout on surfacing is not an appropriate, helpful, safe or reasonable response. If a cave diver surfaces inside a cave, and the computer locks out following a violation, the diver may be in a position where they have no option but to make the return dive without the information the computer could reasonably be expected to provide, putting the diver at considerably more severe risk than strictly necessary. This is a very rare occurrence, but it is a failure that a backup computer with similar functionality cannot mitigate. Depending on circumstances and the specific computer, it may be possible to set it to gauge mode, which would at least provide depth and time data.

=== Redundancy ===
A single computer shared between divers cannot accurately record the dive profile of the second diver, and therefore their decompression status will be unreliable and probably inaccurate. In the event of computer malfunction during a dive, the buddy&#x27;s computer record may be the best available estimate of decompression status, and has been used as a guide for decompression in emergencies. Further diving after an ascent in these conditions exposes the diver to an unknown additional risk. Some divers carry a backup computer to allow for this possibility. The backup computer will carry the full recent pressure exposure history, and continued diving after a malfunction of one computer will not affect risk provided that the second computer continues to function correctly. It is also possible to set the conservatism on the backup computer to allow for the fastest acceptable ascent in case of an emergency, with the primary computer set for the diver&#x27;s preferred risk level if this feature is not available on the computer. Under normal circumstances the primary computer will be used to control the ascent.
===Ethical questions===
Some questions have been raised in the diving community regarding the ethics of certain practices by dive computer manufacturers. In the continued absence of normative standards for the design and testing of dive computers, these have remained open, and the choice must be made by the user based on the information made available by the manufacturer, which may not be much.

*Is it ethical for the computer manufacturer to not divulge the details of the decompression model used in a dive computer? How does this affect the ability of the diver to make an informed acceptance of risk? What are the criteria for effectiveness and risk acceptability?
*What is an acceptable level of risk? It is generally recognised that with the current technology and understanding of decompression physiology, a zero risk algorithm is not reasonably practicable. Different sectors of the diving community accept different levels of decompression risk, and within the recreational sector, different divers accept different levels of risk.
*What would be an acceptable validation protocol? Should dive computers be validated on human subjects using Doppler monitoring? If so, what types of profile should be used, and how would meaningful rejection criteria be chosen? 
*Should validation be done by an independent agency?
*Is it acceptable to lock out decompression monitoring functionality during a dive in the event of a profile violation, leaving the diver without any indication of a reasonable safe ascent profile at a time when it is most needed?

== History ==

In 1951 the Office of Naval Research funded a project with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography for the theoretical design of a prototype decompression computer. Two years later, two Scripps researchers, Groves and Monk, published a paper specifying the required functionalities for a decompression device to be carried by the diver: It must calculate decompression during a multilevel dive; it must take into account residual nitrogen loading from previous dives; and, based on this information, specify a safe ascent profile with better resolution than decompression tables. They suggested using an electrical analog computer to measure decompression and air consumption.
=== Pneumatic analogues ===
The prototype mechanical analogue Foxboro Decomputer Mark I, was produced by the Foxboro Company in 1955, and evaluated by the US Navy Experimental Diving Unit in 1957. The Mark 1 simulated two tissues using five calibrated porous ceramic flow resistors and five bellows actuators to drive a needle which indicated decompression risk during an ascent by moving towards a red zone on the display dial. The US Navy found the device to be too inconsistent.

The first recreational mechanical analogue dive computer, the &quot;decompression meter&quot; was designed by the Italians De Sanctis and Alinari in 1959 and built by their company named SOS, which also made depth gauges. The decompression meter was distributed directly by SOS and also by scuba diving equipment firms such as Scubapro and Cressi. It was very simple in principle: a waterproof bladder filled with gas inside the casing bled into a smaller chamber through a semi-porous ceramic flow resistor to simulate a single tissue in- and out-gassing. The chamber pressure was measured by a bourdon tube gauge, calibrated to indicate decompression status. The device functioned so poorly that it was eventually nicknamed &quot;bendomatic&quot;.

In 1965, R. A. Stubbs and D. J. Kidd applied their decompression model to a pneumatic analogue decompression computer, and in 1967 Brian Hills reported development of a pneumatic analogue decompression computer modelling the thermodynamic decompression model. It modelled phase equilibration instead of the more commonly used limited supersaturation criteria and was intended as an instrument for on-site control of decompression of a diver based on real-time output from the device. Hills considered the model to be conservative.

Several mechanical analogue decompression meters were subsequently made, some with several bladders for simulating the effect on various body tissues, but they were sidelined with the arrival of electronic computers.

The Canadian DCIEM pneumatic analogue computer of 1962 simulated four tissues, approximating the DCIEM tables of the time.

The 1973 GE Decometer by General Electric used semi-permeable silicone membranes instead of ceramic flow resistors, which allowed deeper dives.

The Farallon Decomputer of 1975 by Farallon Industries, California simulated two tissues, but produced results very different from the US Navy tables of the time, and was withdrawn a year later.

=== Electrical analogues ===
At the same time as the mechanical simulators, electrical analog simulators were being developed, in which tissues were simulated by a network of resistors and capacitors, but these were found to be unstable with temperature fluctuations, and required calibration before use. They were also bulky and heavy because of the size of the batteries needed. The first analogue electronic decompression meter was the Tracor, completed in 1963 by Texas Research Associates.

=== Digital ===
The first digital dive computer was a laboratory model, the XDC-1, based on a desktop electronic calculator, converted to run a DCIEM four-tissue algorithm by Kidd and Stubbs in 1975. It used pneumofathometer depth input from surface-supplied divers.

From 1976 the diving equipment company Dacor developed and marketed a digital dive computer which used a table lookup based on stored US Navy tables rather than a real-time tissue gas saturation model. The Dacor Dive Computer (DDC), displayed output on light-emitting diodes for: current depth; elapsed dive time; surface interval; maximum depth of the dive; repetitive dive data; ascent rate, with a warning for exceeding 20 metres per minute; warning when no-decompression limit is reached; battery low warning light; and required decompression.

The Canadian company CTF Systems Inc. then developed the XDC-2 or CyberDiver II (1980), which also used table lookup, and the XDC-3, also known as CyberDiverIII, which used microprocessors, measured cylinder pressure using a high-pressure hose, calculated tissue loadings using the Kidd-Stubbs model, and remaining no-stop time. It had an LED matrix display, but was limited by the power supply, as the four 9 V batteries only lasted for four hours and it weighed 1.2 kg. About 700 of the XDC models were sold from 1979 to 1982.

In 1979 the XDC-4 could already be used with mixed gases and different decompression models using a multiprocessor system, but was too expensive to make an impact on the market.

In 1982/1983, the Hans Hass-&quot;DecoBrain I&quot;, designed by &quot;Divetronic AG&quot;, a Swiss start-up, became the first decompression diving computer, capable of displaying the information that today&#x27;s diving computers do. It worked with a stored decompression table. The DecoBrain II was based on Albert A. Bühlmann&#x27;s 16 compartment (ZH-L12) tissue model, which Jürg Hermann, an electronic engineer, implemented in 1981 on one of Intel&#x27;s first single-chip microcontrollers as part of his thesis at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.

The 1984 Orca Edge was an early example of a dive computer. Designed by Craig Barshinger, Karl Huggins and Paul Heinmiller, the EDGE did not display a decompression plan, but instead showed the ceiling or the so-called &quot;safe-ascent-depth&quot;. A drawback was that if the diver was faced by a ceiling, he did not know how long he would have to decompress. The Edge&#x27;s large, unique display, however, featuring 12 tissue bars permitted an experienced user to make a reasonable estimate of his or her decompression obligation.

In the 1980s the technology quickly improved. In 1983 the Orca Edge became available as the first commercially viable dive computer. The model was based on the US Navy dive tables but did not calculate a decompression plan. However, production capacity was only one unit a day.

In 1984 the US Navy diving computer (UDC) which was based on a 9 tissue model of Edward D. Thalmann of the Naval Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU), Panama City, who developed the US Navy tables. &quot;Divetronic AG&quot; completed the UDC development – as it had been started by the chief engineer Kirk Jennings of the Naval Ocean System Center, Hawaii, and Thalmann of the NEDU – by adapting the Deco Brain for US Navy warfare use and for their 9-tissue MK-15 mixed gas model under an R&amp;D contract of the US Navy.

Orca Industries continued to refine their technology with the release of the Skinny-dipper in 1987 to do calculations for repetitive diving. They later released the Delphi computer in 1989 that included calculations for diving at altitude as well as profile recording.

In 1986 the Finnish company, Suunto, released the SME-ML. This computer had a simple design, with all the information on display. It was easy to use and was able to store 10 hours of dives, which could be accessed any time. The SME-ML used a 9 compartment algorithm used for the US Navy tables, with tissues half times from 2.5 to 480 minutes. Battery life was up to 1500 hours, maximum depth 60 m.

In 1987 Swiss company UWATEC entered the market with the Aladin, which was a bulky and fairly rugged grey device with quite a small screen, a maximum depth of 100 metres, and an ascent rate of 10 metres per minute. It stored data for 5 dives and had a user replaceable 3.6 V battery, which lasted for around 800 dives. For some time it was the most commonly seen dive computer, particularly in Europe. Later versions had a battery which had to be changed by the manufacturer and an inaccurate battery charge indicator, but the brand remained popular.

The c1989 Dacor Microbrain Pro Plus claimed to have the first integrated dive planning function, the first EEPROM storing full dive data for the last three dives, basic data for 9999 dives, and recorded maximum depth achieved, cumulative total dive time, and total number of dives. The LCD provides a graphic indication of remaining no-decompression time.

=== General acceptance ===
Even by 1989, the advent of dive computers had not met with what might be considered widespread acceptance. Combined with the general mistrust, at the time, of taking a piece of electronics that your life might depend upon underwater, there were also objections expressed ranging from dive resorts felt that the increased bottom time would upset their boat and meal schedules, to that experienced divers felt that the increased bottom time would, regardless of the claims, result in many more cases of decompression sickness. Understanding the need for clear communication and debate, Michael Lang of the California State University at San Diego and Bill Hamilton of Hamilton Research Ltd. brought together, under the auspices of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences a diverse group that included most of the dive computer designers and manufacturers, some of the best known hyperbaric medicine theorists and practitioners, representatives from the recreational diving agencies, the cave diving community and the scientific diving community.

The basic issue was made clear by Andrew A. Pilmanis in his introductory remarks: &quot;It is apparent that dive computers are here to stay, but are still in the early stages of development. From this perspective, this workshop can begin the process of establishing standard evaluation procedures for assuring safe and effective utilization of dive computers in scientific diving.&quot;

After meeting for two days the conferees were still in, &quot;the early stages of development,&quot; and the &quot;process of establishing standard evaluation procedures for assuring safe and effective utilization of dive computers in scientific diving,&quot; had not really begun. University of Rhode Island diving safety officer Phillip Sharkey and Orca Edge&#x27;s Director of Research and Development, Paul Heinmiller, prepared a 12-point proposal that they invited the diving safety officers in attendance to discuss at an evening closed meeting. Those attending included Jim Stewart (Scripps Institution of Oceanography), Lee Somers (University of Michigan), Mark Flahan (San Diego State University), Woody Southerland (Duke University), John Heine (Moss Landing Marine Laboratories), Glen Egstrom (University of California, Los Angeles), John Duffy (California Department of Fish and Game), and James Corry (United States Secret Service). Over the course of several hours the suggestion prepared by Sharkey and Heinmiller was edited and turned into the following 13 recommendations:

# Only those makes and models of dive computers specifically approved by the Diving Control Board may be used. 
# Any diver desiring the approval to use a dive computer as a means of determining decompression status must apply to the Diving Control Board, complete an appropriate practical training session and pass a written examination. 
# Each diver relying on a dive computer to plan dives and indicate or determine decompression status must have his own unit. 
# On any given dive, both divers in the buddy pair must follow the most conservative dive computer. 
# If the dive computer fails at any time during the dive, the dive must be terminated and appropriate surfacing procedures should be initiated immediately. 
# A diver should not dive for 18 hours before activating a dive computer to use it to control his diving. 
# Once the dive computer is in use, it must not be switched off until it indicates complete outgassing has occurred or 18 hours have elapsed, whichever comes first. 
# When using a dive computer, non-emergency ascents are to be at the rate specified for the make and model of dive computer being used. 
# Ascent rates shall not exceed 40 fsw/min in the last 60 fsw. 
# Whenever practical, divers using a dive computer should make a stop between 10 and 30 feet for 5 minutes, especially for dives below 60 fsw. 
# Only 1 dive on the dive computer in which the NDL of the tables or dive computer has been exceeded may be made in any 18-hour period. 
# Repetitive and multi-level diving procedures should start the dive, or series of dives, at the maximum planned depth, followed by subsequent dives of shallower exposures. 
# Multiple deep dives require special consideration.
As recorded in &quot;Session 9: General discussion and concluding remarks:&quot; 
Mike Lang next lead the group discussion to reach consensus on the guidelines for use of dive computers. These 13 points had been thoroughly discussed and compiled the night before, so that most of the additional comments were for clarification and precision. The following items are the guidelines for use of dive computers for the scientific diving community. It was again reinforced that almost all of these guidelines were also applicable to the diving community at large.

After the AAUS workshop most opposition to dive computers dissipated, numerous new models were introduced, the technology dramatically improved and dive computers soon became standard scuba diving equipment. Over time, some of the 13 recommendations became irrelevant, as more recent dive computers continue running while they have battery power, and switching them off mainly turns off the display.

=== Further development ===
c1996, Mares marketed a dive computer with spoken audio output, produced by Benemec Oy of Finland, and the Thamann VVAL 18 decompression model was tested in the Cochran dive computer.

c2000, HydroSpace Engineering developed the HS Explorer, a Trimix computer with optional PO2 monitoring and twin decompression algorithms, Bühlmann, and the first full RGBM implementation.

In 2001, the US Navy approved the use of Cochran NAVY decompression computer with the VVAL 18 Thalmann algorithm for Special Warfare operations.

In 2008, the Underwater Digital Interface (UDI) was released to the market. This dive computer, based on the RGBM model, includes a digital compass, an underwater communication system that enables divers to transmit preset text messages, and a distress signal with homing capabilities.

By 2010 the use of dive computers for decompression status tracking was virtually ubiquitous among recreational divers and widespread in scientific diving. 50 models by 14 manufacturers were available in the UK.

The variety and number of additional functions available has increased over the years.

Wristwatch format housings have become common. They are compact and can also serve as daily wear wristwatches, but the display area is limited by the size of the unit and may be difficult to read for divers with poorer vision, and control buttons are necessarily small and may be awkward to use with thick gloves. Battery life may also be limited by the available volume.

====Smartphone housings====
Waterproof housings are marketed which use a smartphone, depth and temperature sensors and a decompression app to provide dive computer capabilities. Depth ratings vary, but 80msw is claimed for some. Bluetooth wireless communications have been used for communication between the smartphone and external sensors. Specifications may not mention any validation tests or compliance with standards relevant to diving equipment. A variety of features are offered based on the smartphone platform. Android and iOS operating systems are supported.

== Validation ==
&quot;Verification&quot; is the determination that a dive computer functions correctly, in that it correctly executes its programmed algorithm, and this would be a standard quality assurance procedure by the manufacturer, while &quot;validation&quot; confirms that the algorithm provides the accepted level of risk. The risk of the decompression algorithms programmed into dive computers may be assessed in several ways, including tests on human subjects, monitored pilot programs, comparison to dive profiles with known decompression sickness risk, and comparison to risk models.

===Performance of dive computers exposed to profiles with known human subject results.===
Studies (2004) at the University of Southern California&#x27;s Catalina hyperbaric chamber ran dive computers against a group of dive profiles that have been tested with human subjects, or have a large number of operational dives on record.

The dive computers were immersed in water inside the chamber and the profiles were run. Remaining no-decompression times, or required total decompression times, were recorded from each computer 1 min prior to departure from each depth in the profile. The results for a 40 msw &quot;low risk&quot; multi-level no-decompression dive from the PADI/DSAT RDP test series provided a range of 26 min of no-decompression time remaining to 15 min of required decompression time for the computers tested. The computers which indicated required decompression may be regarded as conservative: following the decompression profile of a conservative algorithm or setting will expose the diver to a reduced risk of decompression, but the magnitude of the reduction is unknown. Conversely the more aggressive indications of the computers showing a considerable amount of remaining no-decompression time will expose the diver to a greater risk than the fairly conservative PADI/DSAT schedule, of unknown magnitude.

=== Comparative assessment and validation ===
Evaluation of decompression algorithms could be done without the need for tests on human subjects by establishing a set of previously tested dive profiles with a known risk of decompression sickness. This could provide a rudimentary baseline for dive computer comparisons. As of 2012, the accuracy of temperature and depth measurements from computers may lack consistency between models making this type of research difficult.

==== Accuracy of displayed data ====
European standard &quot;EN13319:2000 Diving accessories - Depth gauges and combined depth and time measuring devices - Functional and safety requirements, test methods&quot;, specifies functional and safety requirements and accuracy standards for depth and time measurement in dive computers and other instruments measuring water depth by ambient pressure. It does not apply to any other data which may be displayed or used by the instrument.

Temperature data are used to correct pressure sensor output, which is non-linear with temperature, and are not as important as pressure for the decompression algorithm, so a lesser level of accuracy is required. A study published in 2021 examined the response time, accuracy and precision of water temperature measurement computers and found that 9 of 12 models were accurate within 0.5 °C given sufficient time for the temperature to stabilise, using downloaded data from open water and wet chamber dives in fresh- and seawater. High ambient air temperature is known to affect temperature profiles for several minutes into a dive, depending on the location of the pressure sensor, as the heat transfer from computer body to the water is slowed by factors such as poor thermal conductivity of a plastic housing, internal heat generation, and mounting the sensor orifice in contact with the insulation of the diving suit. An edge-mounted sensor in a small metal housing will follow ambient temperature changes much faster than a base mounted sensor in a large, thick-walled plastic housing, while both provide accurate pressure signals.

An earlier survey of 49 models of decompression computer published in 2012 showed a wide range of error in displayed depth and temperature. Temperature measurement is primarily used to ensure correct processing of the depth transducer signal, so measuring the temperature of the pressure transducer is appropriate, and the slow response to external ambient temperature is not relevant to this function, provided that the pressure signal is correctly processed.

Nearly all of the tested computers recorded depths greater than the actual pressure would indicate, and were markedly inaccurate (up to 5%) for some of the computers. There was considerable variability in permitted no-stop bottom times, but for square profile exposures, the computer-generated values tended to be more conservative than tables at depths shallower than 30 m, but less conservative at 30–50 m. The no-stop limits generated by the computers were compared to the no-stop limits of the DCIEM and RNPL tables. Variation from applied depth pressure measured in a decompression chamber, where accuracy of pressure measurement instrumentation is periodically calibrated to fairly high precision (±0.25%), showed errors from -0.5 to +2m, with a tendency to increase with depth.

There appeared to be a tendency for models of computer by the same manufacturer to display a similar variance in displayed pressure, which the researchers interpreted as suggesting that the offset could be a deliberate design criterion, but could also be an artifact of using similar components and software by the manufacturer. The importance of these errors for decompression purposes is unknown, as ambient pressure, which is measured directly, but not displayed, is used for decompression calculations. Depth is calculated as a function of pressure, and does not take into account density variations in the water column. Actual linear distance below the surface is more relevant for scientific measurement, while displayed depth is more relevant to forensic examinations of dive computers, and for divers using the computer in gauge mode with standard decompression tables, which are usually set up for pressure in feet or metres of water column .

== Ergonomic considerations ==


If the diver cannot effectively use the dive computer during a dive it is of no value except as a dive profile recorder.
To effectively use the device the ergonomic aspects of the display and control input system (User interface) are important. Misunderstanding of the displayed data and inability to make necessary inputs can lead to life-threatening problems underwater. The operating manual is not available for reference during the dive, so either the diver must learn and practice the use of the specific unit before using it in complex situations, or the operation must be sufficiently intuitive that it can be worked out on the spot, by a diver who may be under stress at the time. Although several manufacturers claim that their units are simple and intuitive to operate, the number of functions, layout of the display, and sequence of button pressing is markedly different between different manufacturers, and even between different models by the same manufacturer. Number of buttons that may need to be pressed during a dive generally varies between two and four, and the layout and sequence of pressing buttons can become complicated. Experience using one model may be of little use preparing the diver to use a different model, and a significant relearning stage may be necessary. Previous experience may even be a disadvantage when the knowledge of one system may confuse the diver who needs to use a different system under stress. Both technical and ergonomic aspects of the dive computer are important for diver safety. Underwater legibility of the display may vary significantly with underwater conditions and the visual acuity of the individual diver. If labels identifying output data and menu choices are not legible at the time they are needed, they do not help. Legibility is strongly influenced by text size, font, brightness, and contrast. Colour can help in recognition of meaning, such as distinguishing between normal and abnormal conditions, but may detract from legibility, particularly for the colour-blind, and a blinking display demands attention to a warning or alarm, but is distracting from other information.

Several criteria have been identified as important ergonomic considerations:
*Ease of reading critical data, including:
**No decompression time remaining
**Current depth
**Elapsed time since the beginning of the dive (run time)
**If decompression is required, total time to surface, and depth of the next required decompression stop
**If gas integration is the only way to monitor the remaining gas supply, the remaining gas pressure.
*Ease of reading and accessibility of the primary screen display. Misinterpretation of the display data can be very dangerous. This can occur for various reasons, including lack of identifying information and poor legibility. Ease of returning to the primary screen from alternative display options is also important. If the diver cannot remember how to get back to the screen which displays safety-critical information, their safety may be severely compromised. Divers may not fully understand and remember the operating instructions, as they tend to be complicated. Under stress complicated procedures are more likely to be forgotten or misapplied. Alternative screens may revert to the primary screen automatically after a time sufficient to read the auxiliary information. Critical information may be displayed on all stable screen options during a dive as a compromise. It is preferable for the data to be visible by default, and not require illumination by a dive light or internal lighting that needs a button pressed to light up. Some manufacturers offer similar functionality in optional compact and larger screen formats. 
*Ease of use and understanding of the user manual.
*Ease of reading and clarity of meaning of warnings. These may be provided by simple symbol displays, by audible alarms, flashing displays, text messages, colour coding or combinations of these. Alarms should clearly indicate the problem, so the diver need not waste time trying to work out what is at fault, and can take immediate action to correct the problem. To this end, descriptive text indicating the problem and the recommended action to be taken is more useful and less confusing than a flashing symbol, though a flashing symbol can be good for drawing attention to the problem.
*Head-up displays can be used to provide the diver with a view of critical information which is always visible. These can be mounted on the mask, or on the mouthpiece assembly. Head-up displays require special near-eye 0ptics to allow correct focus on the display. In conditions of very low visibility, a head-up display has the advantage that the diver&#x27;s ability to see the display is not affected by turbidity. It also lets the diver monitor all displayed dive data without interrupting their work.
*For more technical applications, ease of making gas switches to both preset gas mixes carried by the diver, and non-preset mixes, which might be supplied by another diver.
*Ease of accessing alternative screen data, much of which is not directly important for safety, but may affect the success of the dive in other ways, like use of compass features.
*Legibility of the display under various ambient conditions of visibility and lighting, and for varying visual acuity of the diver, which may include fogging of the mask or even loss of the mask.

===Form factor===
There are four commonly used form factors:
*Wristwach housings are compact, light, and may be used as daily use wristwatches. Freediving computers are usually in this format, but it is also popular for scuba.
*Circular housings (puck) fit into most diving instrument consoles and have optional wrist mounts. The shape and size were determined by the common sizes of analog mechanical diving instruments (depth gauges and pressure gauges) which commonly used console mounts.
*Rectangular housings (brick) are intended for wrist mounting, using a larger screen size for easier-to-read displays or more information on the screen. They often have a curved back surface to conform more closely with the surface of the forearm for stability, and two straps for security. There are also asymmetrically styled housings with similar characteristics and features. This may be the most popular format for technical diving.
*Smartphone housings are sized to accept a reasonable range of phone models and are therefore necessarily larger. The display area is inherently large, and display quality depends on the smartphone used. They may be wrist mounted or carried in the hand with a safety lanyard, particularly if they are also used as cameras.

== Manufacturing and performance standards ==
Standards relevant in the European Union:
*When a dive computer is integrated with a cylinder pressure gauge it has to be certified according to EN250 (respiratory equipment) and the PPE Directive becomes mandatory.
*The EMC directive (89/336/EEC) for electrical appliances, requires that they do not cause electrical interference, and are not susceptible to it.
*EN13319:2000: covers equipment for measuring depth and time, but explicitly excludes monitoring of decompression obligation.
*PPE Directive 89/686/EEC is intended to harmonize products to provide a high level of protection and safety, but dive computers are not listed in the directive under section 3.11 - additional requirements specific to particular risks – safety devices for diving equipment. Several other classes of diving equipment such as respiratory equipment (EN250:2002), buoyancy compensators (EN1809:1999), combined buoyancy and rescue devices (EN12628:2001), respiratory equipment for compressed nitrox and oxygen (EN13949:2004), rebreathers (EN14143:2004), and dry suits (EN14225-2:2005) fall under the PPE directive.)
*The general quality assurance standard ISO9001 
== Operational considerations for use in commercial diving operations ==
Their acceptance of dive computers for use in commercial diving varies between countries and industrial sectors. Validation criteria have been a major obstacle to acceptance of diving computers for commercial diving. Millions of recreational and scientific dives each year are successful and without incident, but the use of dive computers remains prohibited for commercial diving operations in several jurisdictions because the algorithms used cannot be guaranteed safe to use, and the legislative bodies who can authorise their use have a duty of care to workers. Manufacturers do not want to invest in the expensive and tedious process of official validation, while regulatory bodies will not accept dive computers until a validation process has been documented.

&quot;Verification&quot; is the determination that a dive computer functions correctly, in that it correctly executes its programmed algorithm, while &quot;validation&quot; confirms that the algorithm provides the accepted level of risk.

If the decompression algorithm used in a series of dive computers is considered to be acceptable
for commercial diving operations, with or without additional usage guidelines, then there are
operational issues that need to be considered:
# The computer must be simple to operate or it will probably not be accepted.
# The display must be easily read in low visibility conditions to be effectively used.
# The display must be clear and easily understood, even if the diver is influenced by nitrogen narcosis, to reduce the risk of confusion and poor decisions.
# The decompression algorithm should be adjustable to more conservative settings, as some divers may want a more conservative profile.
# The dive computer must be easy to download to collect profile data so that analysis of dives can be done.

==Rebreather control and monitor hardware==

The functional requirements of an electronically controlled closed circuit rebreather are very similar to the functions and capacity of technical diving decompression computers for rebreather diving, and some rebreather manufacturers use dive computer hardware repackaged by dive computer manufacturers as rebreather control and monitoring units. The software may be modified to provide the display of multiple oxygen cell readings, warnings, alarms and voting logic, and the dive computer hardware may be hard-wired to the rebreather control hardware.

== Bottom timer ==

A bottom timer, or dive timer, is an electronic device that records the depth at specific time intervals during a dive, and displays current depth, maximum depth, elapsed time and may also display water temperature and average depth. It does not calculate decompression data at all, and is equivalent to gauge mode on many dive computers.

==Training and certification==
The approach to training in the use of a dive computer has changed over time. Originally a dive computer was considered special equipment, and the user was responsible for ensuring that they knew how to use it correctly. The AAUS recommendations from the Dive Computer Workshop of 1989 stipulated passing a written exam before scientific divers should be allowed to use personal dive computers in the field. As they became more common, and the usual way of monitoring the dive, minimal instruction on the use of the computer became integrated into dive training as part of the training for a given certification. This is complicated by the probability of more than one model being used by the learners on a given course, except where the school supplied the computers. Since late 2009, it has been an option for PADI Open Water Diver courses, to do a dive computer section in place of learning to use the dive tables. A booklet is supplied on how to use and select a dive computer. SDI was an early adopter of use of dive computers in training from entry level, and offers the course named SDI Computer Diver intended for divers certified through agencies which used traditional dive tables for planning during their training, and have not been formally trained in the use of dive computers.

In 2024 Scuba Schools International (SSI) announced a training program called &quot;Computer Diver&quot; which covers the basic functionality, setup and operation of dive computers. The training is considered appropriate for ages 10 and up, to a maximum depth of 30 m, and is expected to take 3 to 6 hours.

Similarly, PADI schools offer a course called &quot;Computer Diving Specialist&quot;, which has a prerequisite certification of PADI Open Water Diver, the minimum level certification for autonomous recreational diving. The course comprises up to three classroom sessions and an optional open water dive for a beginner with a minimum experience of four open water dives limited to 18 metres to become a specialist by PADI standards.

There is a wide variation in detail of operation for each manufacturer, and in many cases between the models available from each manufacturer, so only the basic information and principles are portable between models, and significant relearning is required to be able to use a new computer safely. This situation could be improved by an internationally accepted standard for user interfaces for critical functions. The information required to safely operate most dive computers is normally extracted from the owner&#x27;s manual by the user, and in many cases from videos freely available on the internet. In most such situations there is no competence assessment, and the user finds out by trial and error, while diving, what they have failed to understand or remember.

<text>Matthew Nicholas Hales (born 17 January 1972) is an English singer, songwriter, musician and record producer who has been performing professionally under the name Aqualung since the early 2000s. Aqualung is best known in the UK for his song &quot;Strange and Beautiful&quot;, which was featured on a television advertisement for the new Volkswagen Beetle during the summer of 2002 and went on to become a top 10 hit on the UK Singles Chart later that year. In the United States, Aqualung is also known for the song &quot;Brighter Than Sunshine&quot;, which had considerable airplay and was used in the film &quot;A Lot Like Love&quot; and various television spots. Hales has released seven albums as Aqualung. The most recent, &quot;Dead Letters&quot;, appeared in 2022.

As a songwriter and record producer, Hales has collaborated with Lianne La Havas, Bat for Lashes, Tom Chaplin, Mika, Daniel Wilson, Kina Grannis, Andreya Triana, the Fray, Kwabs, Jason Mraz, Reignwolf, Sara Bareilles, Jacob Banks, Paloma Faith, Disclosure, Alex Clare, Mansionair, Mikky Ekko, For King &amp; Country and many others.

Hales&#x27; work has earned him various awards and nominations, including two Grammy and three Ivor Novello nominations.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Hales grew up in Southampton, where his parents ran an independent record shop. He aspired to be a musician from an early age, writing songs using the family piano when he was just 4 years old. When he was 16, Hales was awarded a scholarship to study music composition at Winchester College. Within a year, he wrote his first symphony titled &quot;Life Cycle&quot;, and formed his first band, which carried several different names during its lifespan. In the spring of 1990, the band (known at the time as Mecano Pig) produced their debut self-titled album, but broke up soon afterwards. That same year, Hales moved to London to study music at City University, and in 1992 formed a new band with his brother Ben called Gravel Monsters.

===RUTH / the 45s===
Gravel Monsters became a quartet that featured Matt &amp; Ben Hales, Matt Vincent-Brown, and Stephen Cousins. The band&#x27;s name was changed to RUTH in 1992, and although it enjoyed a minor hit in 1997 (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;) which earned them a loyal fan base, the indie rock quartet failed to find commercial success in their seven years together. Arc Records released RUTH&#x27;s debut album &quot;Harrison&quot; in 1999. After the band parted ways with Arc Records in the Summer of 2000, they renamed themselves the 45s and signed a short-term contract with Mercury Records (part of the Universal Music Group). Despite releasing two well-received singles, the label declined to renew the band&#x27;s contract in March 2002, leading the band to split up. It was at this moment that Matt Hales began to concentrate on a solo project that he would call Aqualung. In 2003, a double CD, &quot;Donut (A Collection of Songs for Fellow Appreciators of RUTH)&quot; was compiled by the bands&#x27;s former guitarist Ben Hales and independently released on the Vanity Press label. It featured re-mastered studio, demo and live tracks on one CD and three promo videos on a second CD.

===Aqualung===

Almost immediately after the 45s split, Aqualung&#x27;s debut single &quot;Strange and Beautiful (I&#x27;ll Put a Spell on You)&quot; gained popularity when it was used as the soundtrack on a television commercial for the new Volkswagen Beetle. It was released as a single on B-Unique Records in September 2002, and reached No. 7 on the UK Singles Chart. Later that month, B-Unique released the eponymous debut album &quot;Aqualung&quot;, which according to the sleeve notes was recorded entirely in Hales&#x27; hallway. It peaked at No. 15 on the UK Albums Chart, and achieved gold status before the year&#x27;s end. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Good Times Gonna Come&quot; was released on 2 December 2002. It was featured on the British television show &quot;Skins&quot;, and reached No. 71 on the UK Singles Chart. Several singles followed into the next year, as did Aqualung&#x27;s second album &quot;Still Life&quot;, which spawned the single &quot;Brighter Than Sunshine&quot;. The song attracted the attention of film and television music supervisors in both Europe and North America, and was featured in the television show &quot;&quot; and the motion picture &quot;A Lot Like Love&quot;. &quot;Brighter Than Sunshine&quot; enjoyed Top 40 airplay success in the United States, leading Aqualung to a worldwide recording contract with Columbia Records in 2005, and the US release of &quot;Strange and Beautiful&quot;, a compilation of tracks from his first two UK albums. It reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart, eventually selling more than 250,000 copies in the US. Throughout the mid and late 2000s, Aqualung&#x27;s music was used in television shows such as &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, &quot;Cold Case&quot;, &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Eli Stone&quot;, and &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;.

Hales and his touring band spent the next two years performing throughout North America, participating in the Hotel Cafe Tour, which also featured Cary Brothers, Meiko, Greg Laswell, Tom McRae, Joe Purdy, and Jim Bianco. While on the road, Hales would routinely switch up the Aqualung show with different musicians, settings, and approaches. The diverse elements he explored during these tours (including the use of an echo device called the Memory Man) subsequently drove the creative process behind what would become Aqualung&#x27;s next album, &quot;Memory Man&quot;. It was released in March 2007, and the liner notes credit Hales with playing the following instruments: piano, Fender Rhodes, glockenspiel, electric guitar, Stairwell Drums, harmonium, Moog bass and vocoder. Hales completed his first UK tour since his debut album was released, and concluded the run at the newly re-opened Tabernacle, Notting Hill.

2008 brought the release of &quot;Words and Music&quot;, Hales&#x27; first album for Verve Forecast Records. It featured acoustic versions of two songs from his debut album &quot;Aqualung&quot;, as well as new songs written in a similar style. In 2010, Hales moved to Los Angeles, to begin the production of his sixth studio album titled &quot;Magnetic North&quot;. In reference to the album on his Facebook page, Hales said, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to describe. It&#x27;s like 12 kids who you would never guess were in the same family until you hear them speaking.&quot; The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Fingertip&quot; was released on 2 March 2010, and reviews of &quot;Magnetic North&quot; make reference to the indication of Los Angeles&#x27; influence on Hales as a writer, with songs containing words like &quot;California&quot;, &quot;Sundowning&quot;, and &quot;Hummingbird&quot;, which were not used prior to his moving Stateside. In 2013, Hales announced on his Facebook page that he had begun work on a new Aqualung album. Also in 2013, Aqualung was featured on the song &quot;Surrounded&quot; on the album &quot;A Song Across Wires&quot; by EDM artist BT.

===Songwriter and producer===
As early as 2004, Hales began collaborating with other artists as a songwriter and producer. He co-wrote &quot;UR&quot; by Tiësto which featured his lead vocal, and was released as a single and featured on the album &quot;Just Be&quot;. He worked with Leona Lewis on her album &quot;Echo&quot; in 2009, and in 2010 he co-wrote songs appearing on albums by Brooke Fraser, Christophe Willem, and Boyzone.

After co-writing and producing the song &quot;Pick Up Your Tricks&quot; with Australian pop rock band Amy Meredith in 2011, Hales wrote and produced &quot;Cold&quot; which featured himself and Lucy Schwartz and appeared on &quot;The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1&quot; soundtrack, which sold more than 500,000 copies in the United States.

2012 proved to be the breakout year for Hales in the recording studio. He co-wrote and produced &quot;Is Your Love Big Enough?&quot; by British singer/songwriter Lianne La Havas. It debuted at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart, was named iTunes UK album of the year, and was nominated at the 2012 Barclaycard Mercury Prize. In addition to this, Hales co-wrote &quot;Everything Is Sound&quot; on Jason Mraz&#x27;s Grammy nominated album &quot;Love Is a Four Letter Word&quot;, and worked with Paloma Faith on the single &quot;Just Be&quot; from her album &quot;Fall to Grace&quot;. He also co-wrote and produced Diane Birch&#x27;s single &quot;Unfucked&quot;, and the single &quot;Same Heart (feat. Tom Chaplin)&quot; by Laura Jansen. Hales has recently spent time in the studio collaborating with Christina Perri, the Fray, Sara Bareilles, Birdie, Alex Clare, Katharine McPhee, Ginny Blackmore, Kina Grannis, Matt Nathanson, among others.

The 2022 release of the &quot;Dead Letters&quot; studio album followed a move from Los Angeles back to the United Kingdom, where Hales was reunited with his childhood piano.

<doc id="302033" wikidata="Q1054694" url="?curid=302033" title="Frequency response">
<text>In signal processing and electronics, the frequency response of a system is the quantitative measure of the magnitude and phase of the output as a function of input frequency. The frequency response is widely used in the design and analysis of systems, such as audio and control systems, where they simplify mathematical analysis by converting governing differential equations into algebraic equations. In an audio system, it may be used to minimize audible distortion by designing components (such as microphones, amplifiers and loudspeakers) so that the overall response is as flat (uniform) as possible across the system&#x27;s bandwidth. In control systems, such as a vehicle&#x27;s cruise control, it may be used to assess system stability, often through the use of Bode plots. Systems with a specific frequency response can be designed using analog and digital filters.

The frequency response characterizes systems in the frequency domain, just as the impulse response characterizes systems in the time domain. In linear systems (or as an approximation to a real system neglecting second order non-linear properties), either response completely describes the system and thus there is a one-to-one correspondence: the frequency response is the Fourier transform of the impulse response. The frequency response allows simpler analysis of cascaded systems such as multistage amplifiers, as the response of the overall system can be found through multiplication of the individual stages&#x27; frequency responses (as opposed to convolution of the impulse response in the time domain). The frequency response is closely related to the transfer function in linear systems, which is the Laplace transform of the impulse response. They are equivalent when the real part formula_1 of the transfer function&#x27;s complex variable formula_2 is zero.

== Measurement and plotting ==
Measuring the frequency response typically involves exciting the system with an input signal and measuring the resulting output signal, calculating the frequency spectra of the two signals (for example, using the fast Fourier transform for discrete signals), and comparing the spectra to isolate the effect of the system. In linear systems, the frequency range of the input signal should cover the frequency range of interest.

Several methods using different input signals may be used to measure the frequency response of a system, including:
* Applying constant amplitude sinusoids stepped through a range of frequencies and comparing the amplitude and phase shift of the output relative to the input. The frequency sweep must be slow enough for the system to reach its steady-state at each point of interest
* Applying an impulse signal and taking the Fourier transform of the system&#x27;s response
* Applying a wide-sense stationary white noise signal over a long period of time and taking the Fourier transform of the system&#x27;s response. With this method, the cross-spectral density (rather than the power spectral density) should be used if phase information is required

The frequency response is characterized by the &quot;magnitude&quot;, typically in decibels (dB) or as a generic amplitude of the dependent variable, and the &quot;phase&quot;, in radians or degrees, measured against frequency, in radian/s, Hertz (Hz) or as a fraction of the sampling frequency.

There are three common ways of plotting response measurements:
* Bode plots graph magnitude and phase against frequency on two rectangular plots
* Nyquist plots graph magnitude and phase parametrically against frequency in polar form
* Nichols plots graph magnitude and phase parametrically against frequency in rectangular form

For the design of control systems, any of the three types of plots may be used to infer closed-loop stability and stability margins from the open-loop frequency response. In many frequency domain applications, the phase response is relatively unimportant and the magnitude response of the Bode plot may be all that is required. In digital systems (such as digital filters), the frequency response often contains a main lobe with multiple periodic sidelobes, due to spectral leakage caused by digital processes such as sampling and windowing.

===Nonlinear frequency response===
If the system under investigation is nonlinear, linear frequency domain analysis will not reveal all the nonlinear characteristics. To overcome these limitations, generalized frequency response functions and nonlinear output frequency response functions have been defined to analyze nonlinear dynamic effects. Nonlinear frequency response methods may reveal effects such as resonance, intermodulation, and energy transfer.

==Applications==
In the audible range frequency response is usually referred to in connection with electronic amplifiers, microphones and loudspeakers. Radio spectrum frequency response can refer to measurements of coaxial cable, twisted-pair cable, video switching equipment, wireless communications devices, and antenna systems. Infrasonic frequency response measurements include earthquakes and electroencephalography (brain waves).

Frequency response curves are often used to indicate the accuracy of electronic components or systems. When a system or component reproduces all desired input signals with no emphasis or attenuation of a particular frequency band, the system or component is said to be &quot;flat&quot;, or to have a flat frequency response curve. In other case, we can be use 3D-form of frequency response surface.

Frequency response requirements differ depending on the application. In high fidelity audio, an amplifier requires a flat frequency response of at least 20–20,000 Hz, with a tolerance as tight as ±0.1 dB in the mid-range frequencies around 1000 Hz; however, in telephony, a frequency response of 400–4,000 Hz, with a tolerance of ±1 dB is sufficient for intelligibility of speech.

Once a frequency response has been measured (e.g., as an impulse response), provided the system is linear and time-invariant, its characteristic can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy by a digital filter. Similarly, if a system is demonstrated to have a poor frequency response, a digital or analog filter can be applied to the signals prior to their reproduction to compensate for these deficiencies.

The form of a frequency response curve is very important for anti-jamming protection of radars, communications and other systems.

Frequency response analysis can also be applied to biological domains, such as the detection of hormesis in repeated behaviors with opponent process dynamics, or in the optimization of drug treatment regimens.

<doc id="302036" wikidata="Q588449" url="?curid=302036" title="Fyodor Dan">
<text>Fyodor Ilyich Dan (; 19 October O.S. 7 October] 1871 – 22 January 1947), original surname Gurvich, was a Russian political activist and journalist who helped found the Menshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.

==Background==
Fyodor Dan was born to a Jewish family in St. Petersburg, where his father owned a pharmacy. From 1889 to 1895 he studied at the Imperial University of Dorpat.

In 1895 he graduated from the medical faculty of Yuryev University (now University of Tartu) and became a doctor. He participated in the social democratic movement from 1894

==Career==
Dan was a lifelong socialist activist and journalist. He was a member of the St. Petersburg Union of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class and was one of the organizers of the textile workers&#x27; strike. In 1896 he was arrested and deported for 5 years to the Vyatka province.

===Menshevism===

In the summer of 1901 he emigrated to Berlin, where he joined the Iskra assistance group. On his return, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1902 and went to London for their Second Congress in 1903. Dan aligned himself with Julius Martov who wanted to have a larger party of activists, rather than Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s conception of a smaller party of professional revolutionaries.

In 1904 he wrote the first official history of the early years of the RSDLP. Dan helped Martov form the Mensheviks, returning to Russia in 1912. He was an active member of the irregular freemasonic lodge, the Grand Orient of Russia&#x27;s Peoples. From 1913 he worked legally in Russia. Editor of the newspaper Golos Sotsial-Demorata and was a member of the Menshevik Central Committee. In 1915 he was arrested and exiled to Siberia. He was pardoned and mobilized as a military doctor with the outbreak of WWI.

=== Russian Revolution ===

After the February Revolution of 1917 he became an ideologist of &quot;revolutionary defencism&quot;. One of the most notable figures of the period, he was a member of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the 1st convocation. After the October Revolution he worked as a doctor. At the 7th (December 1919) and 8th (December 1920) All-Russian Congresses of Soviets, he was a speaker on behalf of the Mensheviks.

===Exile===
Dan was arrested on the order of the Soviet authorities in 1921 and after a year in prison was sent into exile on charges of being an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;. In 1923 he participated in the creation of the Socialist Workers&#x27; International. In the same year he was deprived of Soviet citizenship. After the death of Julius Martov in 1923, until 1940, he headed the Foreign Delegation of the Menshevik faction of the RSDLP.

When the Soviet Union was attacked in 1941, Dan gave his support to the country. In his book &quot;The Origins of Bolshevism&quot; (1943) he argued that Bolshevism was the carrier of socialism, whilst still arguing for political liberalisation in the Soviet Union.

== Life ==
Fyodor Dan was married to Martov&#x27;s sister Lydia Cederbaum. Their daughter Anna died in infancy.

==Death==
Dan left France during the Second World War for refuge in the United States. He died in New York City on January 22, 1947.

<text>was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Toyoda was born in what is now part Kitsuki city, Ōita Prefecture. He graduated from the 33rd class of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1905, ranked 26th out of 176 cadets. He served his midshipman duty aboard the cruisers and , and after being commissioned as an ensign on 20 December 1906, he was assigned to the destroyer . He was promoted to sub-lieutenant on 25 September 1908.

Toyoda returned to school, becoming a torpedo and naval artillery expert. As a lieutenant from 1 December 1911, he served on the battlecruiser . He graduated from the Naval War College (Japan) with honors in 1915, and was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 April 1917. From 1917 to 1919, he was &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Admiral Motaro Yoshimatsu (:ja:吉松茂太郎). From 1919 to 1922, he was sent as naval attaché to the United Kingdom, during which time he was promoted to commander on 1 December 1921.

After his return to Japan, Toyoda was assigned as executive officer on the cruiser . He subsequently served in a number of staff positions, was promoted to captain on 1 December 1925, and received his first command: the cruiser in 1926. In December 1930, he became captain of the battleship . During the London Naval Conference, he accompanied Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to London in 1931. On 1 December 1931, Toyoda was promoted to rear admiral.

From December 1931 to February 1933, Toyoda was chief of the Second Section of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, and promoted to vice admiral on 15 November 1935.

From 1935 to 1937, Toyoda was Director of the Bureau of Naval Affairs, and on 20 October 1937, became Commander-in-Chief of the IJN 4th Fleet. He subsequently became Commander in Chief of the IJN 2nd Fleet on 15 November 1938. Both fleets were active in the Second Sino-Japanese War in support of the invasion of China. From 1939 to 1941, he was Director of Naval Shipbuilding Command.

===World War II===
Promoted to full admiral on 18 September 1941, at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Toyoda was Commander-in-Chief of the Kure Naval District. Toyoda was strongly opposed to the war with the United States, which he viewed from the start as &quot;unwinnable&quot;.

On 10 November 1942, Toyoda became a member of the Supreme War Council, where he made a strong (but mostly unsuccessful) effort to increase funding and the capacity of Japan&#x27;s industry toward naval aviation, over the opposition to the Army-dominated Imperial General Headquarters. On 21 April 1943, Toyoda was reassigned (i.e. demoted) from the Supreme War Council to command of Yokosuka Naval District.

After the death of Admiral Mineichi Koga, Toyoda was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet on 3 May 1944. In June of the same year, he drafted and implemented &quot;Plan &quot;A-Go&quot;&quot; which resulted in the decisive defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy under the command of Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. He followed with &quot;Plan &quot;Sho-Go&quot;&quot;, which again resulted in another major defeat at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Toyoda was aware that both strategies had significant risks, but because the fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy was nearing the point of being unusable due to a lack of gasoline and other essential supplies, he believed that the possibility of profit outweighed the danger of losing the fleet. In the end, however, Toyoda&#x27;s aggressive defensive strategy did not pay off. Nonetheless, Toyoda continued with the same strategy, approving &quot;Plan &quot;Ten-Go&quot;&quot; to send the battleship on its one-way final mission to Okinawa.

Toyoda replaced Koshirō Oikawa as Chief of the Navy General Staff, after the latter resigned, and was the final supreme commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy from 29 May 1945 onward.

Toyoda participated in numerous Imperial Conferences concerning the surrender of Japan. Initially, the Navy Minister, Mitsumasa Yonai, hoped that Toyoda would be able to exert a moderating influence over Army Chief of Staff Yoshijirō Umezu (since both came from the same district of Japan). However, Toyoda joined Umezu in his protestations against the Potsdam Proclamation of 26 July. Toyoda was for termination of the war but insisted that the government push for more favorable terms. After the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Toyoda&#x27;s position became even more hardline. He argued that the Japanese people should defend the Japanese home islands until the last man.

===Post-war===
After the war, Toyoda was interrogated by Rear Admiral Ralph A. Ofstie in Tokyo on 14 November 1945. He was viewed as &quot;highly intelligent and widely informed&quot;, and was observed to be a strong critic of the amount of political power the Army held in the Japanese government. He also expressed his opinion that the war with China should have been ended &quot;even at some sacrifice&quot; so that the men and resources could be redeployed to the Pacific theater.

Toyoda was subsequently arrested by SCAP occupation authorities and held in Sugamo Prison. In 1948, Toyoda was charged with war crimes &quot;for violating the laws and customs of war&quot;. He pleaded &#x27;not guilty&#x27; to all of the charges. He was acquitted and later released in 1949. He was the only member of the Japanese armed forces charged with war crimes to be acquitted.

Toyoda published his memoirs in 1950, and died in 1957 of a heart attack at the age of 72.

<doc id="302038" wikidata="Q5293781" url="?curid=302038" title="Donn Beach">
<text>Donn Beach (born Ernest Raymond Gantt; February 22, 1907 – June 7, 1989) was an American adventurer, businessman, and World War II veteran who was the &quot;founding father&quot; of tiki culture. He is known for opening the first prototypical tiki bar, Don’s Beachcomber, during the 1930s in Hollywood, California, which was expanded to a chain of dozens of restaurants throughout the United States. He later built the International Market Place and additional establishments in what was then the Territory of Hawaii. He married three times.

==Early life==
Gantt was born in 1907, with some sources indicating he was born in New Orleans and growing up in Limestone County, Texas and others indicating that he was born in Texas. A U.S. Census document from 1910 has him living in Limestone County, Texas at the age of 3. The same 1910 census document lists him as being born in Texas, and his mother, Molly Gant, as having a father who was born in Louisiana. In a 1987 interview for The &quot;Watumull Foundation Oral History Project&quot;, Beach claims that he spent his early school days in Mandeville, Louisiana, as well as the Colony of Jamaica and Texas.

By his own account from an interview, he started first working with his mother running boarding houses when he was sixteen. Four years later he claims to have left home and traveled around the world. Upon returning, he left Texas again in 1929, traveling as a supercargo employee for the captain of a yacht heading to Sydney, Australia, by way of Hawaii. He then spent at least an additional year island hopping on freighters throughout the South Pacific.

The interview was given only three years before his death, and many dates are difficult to align. Because he had a reputation as a fabulist &quot;spinner of tall tales&quot;, some claim that his accounts of living in the South Pacific are &quot;almost certainly not true&quot;. Others, such as Edward Brownlee and Arnold Bitner, corroborate parts of his accounts.

== Don the Beachcomber ==

When Prohibition ended in 1933, he opened a bar in Hollywood called &quot;Don&#x27;s Beachcomber&quot; at 1722 N. McCadden Place. With its success he began calling himself Don the Beachcomber (the eventual name of his establishment), and also legally changed his name to Donn Beach. A former Los Angeles councilman alleged that one reason for the name change was to distance himself from past bootlegging and the former operation of an illegal speakeasy called &quot;Ernie&#x27;s Place&quot;. In 1937, the bar moved across the street to 1727 N. McCadden Pl., expanded into a restaurant, and its name was changed to Don The Beachcomber. He mixed potent rum cocktails at both of these tropically-decorated locations, which he referred to as &quot;Rhum Rhapsodies&quot;. A January 15, 1935 classified ad, in the Los Angeles Evening Citizens News, listed the Café at 1722 N. McCadden Place for lease.

One of the first such cocktails he invented was the Sumatra Kula. The rum-laden and potent Zombie cocktail may be his best known drink; it quickly grew in popularity and a copy of it was served at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair by Monte Proser (later of the mob-tied Copacabana). Proser continued to steal Beach&#x27;s ideas, opening &quot;Beachcomber&quot; restaurants on the East coast. Such imitation of Beach&#x27;s work was common. He is generally credited with establishing the entire tiki drink genre, creating dozens of other recipes such as the Cobra&#x27;s Fang, Tahitian Rum Punch, Three Dots and a Dash, Navy Grog, and many others. Beach&#x27;s drink menus featured up to 60 different cocktails.

Because of post-prohibition laws, food also needed to be served. Customers ate what seemed like wonderfully-exotic cuisines, but, in actuality, were mostly standard Cantonese dishes served with flair that he called South Seas Island food. The first pu pu platter was probably served at Don the Beachcomber, as was Rumaki. The restaurant was decorated in a tropical island motif with bamboo and materials he had accumulated from his travels and work on movie sets. In trying to create an escapist atmosphere, he even had the sound of fake rain falling on his roof incorporated into the bar, and shared leis with his customers. An early motto for the bar was &quot;If you can&#x27;t get to paradise, I&#x27;ll bring it to you!&quot;

Beach&#x27;s restaurant was popular with Hollywood actors, some of whom became frequent customers and friends. A book written about Beach mentions stars such as Marlene Dietrich, Bing Crosby, Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. One account about David Niven had the actor anonymously placing a $100 bill in a sealed envelope for Donn at the Garden of Allah Hotel during a time when Beach was completely broke. As the bar continued to grow in popularity with celebrities, monogrammed bamboo chopstick cases were made for them to make them feel at home.

In the 1930s Beach also met and married Sunny Sund (birth name Cora Irene Sund), a waitress and aspiring entrepreneur from Minnesota. She would eventually become his business partner and manager, enlarging and professionalizing the restaurant. They divorced in 1940, the same year Sunny opened a Beachcomber branch in Chicago. She ran and expanded the operation while he was in the Army Air Corps from 1942 to 1945. Sund remarried to William Casparis in 1947.

==World War II==
Gantt was a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army Air Forces in World War II. He was awarded a Purple Heart when he was injured during a U-boat attack on a ship. After recovery, he worked as the operator of officer rest-and-recreation centers. He created some Air Corps-themed cocktail names as a result, including the Q.B. Cooler and the Test Pilot. A B-26 Bomber bore a &quot;Don the Beachcomber driftwood sign&quot; and likeness painted onto its fuselage during the war. The plane was shot down over France a week before D-Day. The crew members parachuted out, were immediately captured, and then held 11 months in German POW camps before being liberated.

He was awarded the merit version of the Bronze Star while setting up rest camps for combat-weary airmen of the 12th and 15th Air Forces in Capri, Nice, Cannes, the French Riviera, Venice, the Lido and Sorrento at the order of his friend, Lieutenant General Jimmy Doolittle.

==Post-war tiki fad==
Tiki restaurants enjoyed a tremendous burst of fad popularity in the 1940s and 1950s and there were several Don the Beachcomber restaurants across the country. Victor J. Bergeron had opened a competing version called Trader Vic&#x27;s in the late 1930s in the San Francisco Bay Area and the two men were (sometimes) amicable rivals for many years. Each claimed to have created the Mai Tai (the Tahitian word for &quot;good&quot;), a popular rum based cocktail that Beach said was a knock-off of his Q.B. Cooler. 

Sund continued to expand Don the Beachcomber under her management. She turned it into one of the nation&#x27;s first chains of themed restaurants, with 16 locations at its height. Her popular Chicago Don the Beachcomber was named one of the top 50 US restaurants in 1947. Donn also created his first &quot;Polynesian Village&quot; at his Encino, California ranch, where he continued to entertain many Hollywood celebrities with extravagant luaus.

==Transition to Hawaii==
When Beach and Sund divorced in 1940 they had remained business partners. In 1945 he signed control of the restaurants over to her, retaining a role as consultant and figurehead. As part of the settlement, Beach was not allowed to open a Don the Beachcomber within the United States. Some believe he may have been forced out in part by the mob. The Chicago Don the Beachcomber had become entangled with Mafia associates.

Beach then moved to the Territory of Hawaii, where he continued his burgeoning entertainment and tiki-themed enterprises. He settled in Waikiki, where he opened his second &quot;Polynesian Village&quot;, known as Waikiki Village. As the creator of the International Market Place, for its construction he placed his offices in the limbs of an enormous banyan tree that was in the market&#x27;s center. The village was dotted with many thatch huts and wood carvings made by one of Beach&#x27;s friends, &quot;Mick&quot; Brownlee. The International Market Place would also feature the Dagger Bar, and a series of &quot;Don the Beachcomber&quot; restaurants. The bar was named after a dagger that was allegedly a trophy that Beach brought back from his time in WWII, a reproduction of an imperial Roman-style Puglia knife that he had gotten in Italy.

The market flourished, and Beach&#x27;s impact on tourism was such that many viewed his contributions as profoundly important. He was honored with a House Resolution Tourism Award in 1957. Beach and Pete Wimberly also played an important role in establishing preservation laws for the Lahaina Historic District, which was later designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1962. At its height, the International Market Place encompassed 50 shops, night clubs, and restaurants, three of which were owned by Beach himself.

Beach remarried in the early 1960s to a Costa Rican woman who would become Carla Beach. The relationship was described as tempestuous and harmful to Beach&#x27;s businesses and they divorced. She later became an actress who went by the name Carla Beachcomber and Carla Beachcomber Lutz.

After the divorce Beach met and married a younger woman of partial Maori ancestry from New Zealand who would become his third wife, Phoebe Beach. He built an elaborate houseboat, the &quot;Marama&quot;, a prototype for what he hoped would be floating housing in Hawaii, but failed to get the zoning for it. He eventually shipped the houseboat to Moorea, and lived there in retirement for a number of years before a succession of hurricanes destroyed it.

In 1989 he died of liver cancer and was buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu.

<text>Game Genie is a line of video game cheat cartridges originally designed by Codemasters, sold by Camerica and Galoob. The first device in the series was released in 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, with subsequent devices released for the Super NES, Game Boy, Genesis, and Game Gear. All Game Genie devices temporarily modify game data, allowing the player to do things unintended by developers such as, depending on the game, cheating, manipulating various aspects of games, and accessing unused assets and functions. Five million units of the original Game Genie products were sold worldwide, and most video game console emulators for the platforms it was on feature Game Genie code support. Emulators that have Game Genie support also allow a near-unlimited number of codes to be entered whereas the actual products have an upper and lower limit, between three and six codes.

In 1993, Codemasters began development on a &quot;Game Genie 2&quot; with Galoob to market and distribute the device in North America, but no Game Genie devices were released for the fifth generation of consoles. Other companies have produced similar hacking devices such as the Code Breaker, Action Replay, and Game Shark. The Game Genie brand was later revived by the company Hyperkin, who released cheat systems for newer consoles.

Codemasters later implemented similar cheat systems in some of their later games post-Game Genie, such as &quot;TOCA Touring Car Championship&quot; and &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot;.

==Operation and design==
The original Game Genie systems were pass-through devices that attached between a cartridge and the console. Upon starting the console, the player is presented with a menu to enter a series of characters, referred to as a &quot;code&quot;, that reference addresses in the ROM of the cartridge. Each code contains an integer value that is read by the system in place of the data actually present on the cartridge.

Because the Game Genie patches the program code of a game, the codes are sometimes referred to as patch codes. These codes can have a variety of effects. Most published codes give the player some form of invulnerability, infinite ammunition, level skipping, or other modifications that allow the player to be more powerful than intended by the developers. In other cases, codes can make the game more difficult or even unlock game features that developers had scrapped and rendered unreachable in normal play.

The Game Genie was packaged with a booklet of codes that could be used across various games. However, this booklet became outdated as Galoob developed new codes and new games were released. In response to this, Galoob created a paid subscription service where subscribers would receive new code booklets quarterly. In addition, Galoob also ran advertisements in certain gaming publications, such as &quot;GamePro&quot;, that featured codes for newer games.

To create new codes, it is possible to enter random codes into a Game Genie. This evolutionary approach is equivalent to using random POKE operations. Usually, entering random codes will result in no noticeable change in the game or freezing the game and possibly corrupting save data, but a useful difference may appear in the game if this process is repeated many times. Once a useful code is discovered, making slight modifications to this code has a much higher probability of producing additional useful codes. With ROM files, emulators, and compilers for these games and systems, it has become possible to reverse engineer games to find specific ROM data to modify. This information can be directly converted into Game Genie codes.

The Game Genie is covered by US Patent #5112051, &quot;Interfacing device for a computer games system&quot;, filed 30 May 1990. This patent expired on 30 May 2010, according to current US patent law.

===NES===

The NES Game Genie attaches to the end of the NES cartridge, causing the cartridge to protrude from the console when fully inserted, making the depression impossible. Therefore, the Game Genie was designed in such a way that it did not need to be depressed in order to start the game. This design put even more stress on the LIF socket than standard game insertion, bending pins and eventually causing units to be unplayable without the Game Genie present.

The Game Genie&#x27;s shape made it difficult to insert into a New-Style NES without applying excessive force. Galoob addressed this problem by creating an adapter which was offered to Game Genie owners for free. 

There also exists a version of the Game Genie for the Family Computer, distributed by Realtec and sold in areas where Famiclones were common.

===Super NES===

The Super NES edition is incompatible with certain games, such as &quot;Star Fox&quot; and &quot;Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars&quot;, as these games use pins that went unused in most games. It also has problems with the SNS-101, as only two codes can be used at a time. There are three known versions of the SNES Game Genie (v1, v1.1, v2). When comparing the PCBs of v1 and v2, v2 has much fewer components. All three versions look exactly the same on the outside, but when v1.1 is booted up, it will have dashes present before any code is entered. The only way to tell v1 and v2 apart is by opening the case and checking the PCB.

===Game Boy===

The Game Boy edition similarly has a slot for cartridges while itself needing to be inserted into the console&#x27;s game slot. It has two face buttons for toggling codes on/off or to return to the code input screen. This edition also houses a compartment to contain a very small code booklet in the back.

The physical design made it difficult to be used with any version of the Game Boy other than the original. Although it could be made to work, if one attempted to use the Game Genie on the Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Light, or Game Boy Advance, they would find the large top portion of the Game Genie would come into contact with the top of the handheld before it was fully engaged. Therefore, the Game Genie would need to be bent backwards in order to function, placing strain on the mechanism that allows it to be pressed down far enough to reach the cartridge contacts. Despite this history, it will work with the Game Boy Advance SP. A standard unit will not fit in a Super Game Boy, but with some minor modification to the plastic, it can fit and work normally. There was also a third party &quot;Super Game Boy to Game Genie Adapter&quot;, allowing the player to connect the Game Genie to a Super Game Boy cartridge.

The unit is also not compatible with Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance cartridges (which will not physically fit into the unit).

===Sega Genesis===

On the Genesis/Mega Drive, the Game Genie can function as a country converter cartridge since most of these games are only &quot;locked&quot; to their respective regions by the shape of the cartridges and/or a set of a few bytes in the header of the ROM. Some games do not work with the Genesis Game Genie. The unit is also not compatible with Sega 32X cartridges (see &quot;legal issues&quot; below).

===Game Gear===
The Game Gear version of the Game Genie had a more complicated design than those for other systems. When inserted into the cartridge slot, another slot would pop up to insert the Game Gear cartridge. It also had a compartment which contained a book of codes. The codes were printed on sticky labels to put on the back of the Game Gear cartridge. When entering codes, the player could easily see what to type in rather than looking through the book.

In the code input menu for the Game Gear Game Genie, a player typing the word &quot;DEAD&quot; will cause the screen to move up and down, possibly as an Easter egg.

Again, some games do not work with this version of the Game Genie (see &quot;legal issues&quot; below).

==Legal issues==

The introduction of the original NES Game Genie was met by firm opposition from Nintendo. Nintendo sued Galoob in the case &quot;Galoob v. Nintendo&quot;, claiming that the Game Genie created derivative works in violation of copyright law. Sales of the Game Genie initially stopped in the U.S., but not in Canada. In many gaming magazines at the time, Galoob placed Game Genie ads saying &quot;Thank You Canada!&quot; After the courts found that use of the Game Genie did not result in a derivative work, Nintendo could do nothing to stop the Game Genie from being sold in the U.S.

Around the time of the lawsuit from Galoob, Nintendo tried to use other methods to thwart the Game Genie, using ROM checksum in later titles intended to detect the cheat modifications. These measures were partially successful but some could be bypassed with additional codes. Later versions of the Game Genie had the ability to hide Genie modifications from checksum routines.

Conversely, Sega fully endorsed the Game Genie, with their official seal of approval.

==Game Genie 2==

A substantially more powerful device was developed by Codemasters for the Super NES, with many improvements including the ability for users to find their own cheat codes, to selectively activate cheats during gameplay using the game controller, to switch games into a slow-motion mode, as well as automatically save and restore the high-scores from games into battery-backed memory on the Game Genie device itself. A fully working prototype of the device was completed, but was not brought to market due to changes in market conditions. One prototype is known to remain in existence, in the possession of Richard Aplin, one of its original creators.

<doc id="302045" wikidata="Q3334344" url="?curid=302045" title="NES Advantage">
<text>The NES Advantage is an arcade style controller manufactured by Asciiware and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. The device is meant to rest on a flat surface at a comfortable level, such as a tabletop or the floor, with the player seated behind it. This way, it can be used like an arcade game joystick—with the left hand using the joystick and the right hand operating the buttons.

==Features==
The NES Advantage features adjustable turbo controls for the A and B buttons which could be toggled on or off with a button; users can adjust the rate of the turbo (i.e., how quickly the A or B button is pressed) by adjusting the respective turbo dials located above each button. The Advantage features a pseudo–slow motion feature, which users can toggle on and off by pressing the &quot;slow&quot; button. However, the slow motion feature does not work with all games, including games compatible with the NES Zapper or R.O.B. accessories. The slow button works by very rapidly pressing a virtual start button, which could lead to problems when the player attempts to do an action while the game is paused (e.g., jumping or firing). This feature was not compatible with games with start menus or pause screens. The slow motion feature was unique at release, though it became a popular feature on later controllers. The controller has two wires to plug into both controller ports. By toggling a switch between &quot;Player 1&quot; and &quot;Player 2&quot;, the Advantage can be shared with another player for games where two players alternate gameplay.

===Design===
The NES Advantage is designed to simulate the look and feel of cabinet arcade game controls, the idea being to make gaming at home feel more like gaming in a video arcade. However, unlike actual arcade cabinets, the NES Advantage uses rubber switches for the buttons and joystick (like a controller), rather than microswitches. The device has a rugged plastic exterior case with a stainless steel bottom plate, and four rubber feet to prevent skidding. Due to the shape, size and styling the Advantage looks and feels very similar to the NES itself.

==In popular culture==
In the film &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, an NES Advantage was used to guide the Statue of Liberty to the center of the city during the climax of the movie.

In the 1989 television series &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;, the main character Kevin Keene can be seen in a live-action sequence playing &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;, and another one playing &quot;The Adventures of Bayou Billy&quot;, both with an NES Advantage.

Christina Aguilera uses one in the video for &quot;Your Body&quot;.

==Reception==
Upon the Advantage&#x27;s initial release in 1987, it was well received as a great way to get the &quot;arcade experience&quot; at home. Since its successful release in the &#x27;80s, the NES Advantage has received little media attention, but has continued to be regarded as one of the best NES accessories ever produced.

<doc id="302049" wikidata="Q2339470" url="?curid=302049" title="NES Zapper">
<text>The Zapper is an electronic light gun accessory launched within the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in North America on October 18, 1985. It is a cosmetic redesign by Nintendo of America&#x27;s head designer Lance Barr, based on Gunpei Yokoi&#x27;s , which had been released in Japan for the Famicom on February 18, 1984. The Zapper requires compatible NES games, such as &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;, &quot;Wild Gunman&quot;, and &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;. Its internal optical sensor allows the player to aim at a television set and accurately shoot at in-game targets.

The Zapper bridged Nintendo&#x27;s existing library of hit arcade light-gun shooter games into the NES&#x27;s launch library. As distinct toys, the Zapper and R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy) were key to the identity of the NES bundle, for positioning the NES&#x27;s 1985–1986 launch into the North American toy market instead of into the crashed video game market.

==Design==

The Video Shooting Series light gun was designed for Famicom by Gunpei Yokoi and Satoru Okada of Nintendo R&amp;D1, modeled realistically after a revolver. Its technology was based on the light gun toy used in Nintendo Beam Gun toy line, which in turn was based on the Colt Single Action Army revolver. The Video Shooting Series light gun is a double-action revolver with a moving hammer, which is automatically fired with a loud bang when the trigger is pulled without needing to cock the hammer. 

In North America, it was redesigned as the Zapper by Nintendo of America&#x27;s head designer Lance Barr, to match the NES&#x27;s color scheme and to resemble a futuristic science fiction ray gun. It has a dark gray barrel and grip. In 1988, the Federal Toy Gun Law required that toy guns be distinct from real guns, so the orange revision was released in the same year.

==History==

The Video Shooting Series light gun was released for Famicom in Japan on February 18, 1984, bundled with &quot;Wild Gunman&quot;, and a holster accessory was released.

===North America===

In January 1985, at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nintendo of America presented the Advanced Video System, a prototype American redesign of the Famicom, which was pitched as a high-end piece of consumer electronics. Its bundle of wireless peripherals includes a computer keyboard, music keyboard, and a combination light wand and gun. The &quot;combination light wand and gun&quot; has an adjustable handle for either mode. However, North American retailers were still apprehensive to re-enter the video game market after the video game crash of 1983, placing no orders.

After the poor reception at the Consumer Electronics Show, Nintendo revised its marketing strategy to avoid the crashed video game market in favor of the toy market, redesigning it as the Nintendo Entertainment System. Expensive wireless technology was abandoned, and the light gun and wand became the wired Zapper. The NES ports of Nintendo&#x27;s existing hit arcade games &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; and &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; were used to position the NES as a gun game instead of a video game system, and Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1 developed the R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy) accessory toy. On October 18, 1985, the NES was launched in the New York City test market, bundled with the Control Deck, Zapper, R.O.B., two controllers, &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;, and &quot;Gyromite&quot;. After successful launch in New York, the NES was gradually rolled out to other major markets in the United States, starting with Los Angeles in February 1986 and followed by other major American cities, culminating in the nationwide launch in July 1986.

In June 1986, the original launch bundle was rebranded as the Deluxe Set, and a cheaper bundle was launched with two controllers and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; Now no longer bundled with every system, the Zapper and R.O.B. were made available for individual sale. In January 1988, at the Winter CES, the orange Zapper revision was announced (as had been required by the Federal Toy Gun Law of 1987) within the new Action Set bundle of the NES. Also announced was the third-party Zapper game &quot;Freedom Force&quot;. In June, at the Summer CES, the Power Set was announced for release that year, bundling the orange Zapper. In 1989, the orange Zapper was released.

===Accessories and third-party counterparts===

In North America, Bondwell released the Deluxe Sighting Scope, an accessory for the NES Zapper, under the brand name QuickShot. The scope is a sight that snaps onto the top of the NES Zapper.

In 1988, the Video Shooter was released in the United States by Placo Toys. The Video Shooter is a wireless light gun controller for the NES. The infrared receiver is a rigid panel plugged directly into the controller port of the NES; it was designed with the intention that the NES would be placed on top of the television in order to detect the Video Shooter. Multiple Video Shooters can be used with a single receiver. When the gun is fired, a red light on the back of the gun is illuminated to indicate that a shot has been fired. The gun has a clear plastic sight on top of the gun to assist in aiming shots.

In late 1988, the Video Blaster was released in North America by Camerica. The Video Blaster has the same shape as the Famicom light gun, but different colors and is compatible with the NES controller port rather than the Famicom extension port. The Famicom light gun included weights to make it heavier, which this controller lacks; however, because the two controllers use the same mold, the Famicom light gun&#x27;s weights can be transplanted to the Video Blaster to give it the same feel. The tip of the Video Blaster&#x27;s barrel is painted orange, but this coloration is much less prominent than other light guns released in the United States after the passage of the Federal Toy Gun Law.

On February 20, 1989, Bandai released the Hyper Shot in Japan. In addition to functioning as a light gun, the controller has equivalents to most of the Famicom controller&#x27;s buttons; it has B, Start and Select buttons, as well as a stick to input directions, but no A button. The controller was bundled with &quot;Space Shadow&quot;. When used with &quot;Space Shadow&quot;, the Hyper Shot can output game audio from its built-in speaker and use haptic feedback to simulate the recoil of firing a gun; while the Hyper Shot can be used as a controller and light gun for any game, &quot;Space Shadow&quot; is the only game to support the speaker and haptic feedback. &quot;Space Shadow&quot; requires the Hyper Shot and cannot be played with other light guns, as the game expects button input to come from the Famicom expansion port (which only the Hyper Shot can provide).

In 1989, Nexoft released The Dominator ProBeam in the United States, a wireless version of the NES Zapper. Unlike other third-party light gun products, the ProBeam is officially licensed by Nintendo, bearing the Nintendo Seal of Quality. The ProBeam uses the same infrared NES receiver as Nexoft&#x27;s The Dominator MasterControl, a wireless controller including a joystick. The receiver connects to the NES via a cable connected to the controller port; the instructions recommend placing the NES and receiver on top of the television. The ProBeam is bright orange and has a built-in scope with crosshairs. It is heavier than the NES Zapper, but has a grip under the barrel to allow it to be wielded using two hands.
In 1990, Konami released the LaserScope, a headset accessory for use with the NES Zapper, in the United States and Japan. It is voice-activated, firing a shot whenever the wearer says &quot;fire&quot;, although some reviewers criticized its ability to do so. The headset also includes stereo headphones for use with the NES and an eyepiece with a crosshair that sits in front of the wearer&#x27;s right eye. It was designed for the game &quot;Laser Invasion&quot;, but works with any game compatible with the NES Zapper. In the United States, &quot;Laser Invasion&quot; came with a coupon for a $5 discount for the LaserScope.

==Gameplay==
The Zapper can be pointed at a television set to interact with on-screen targets in games that support it. Games and game modes that support the Zapper are primarily shooting gallery games, although the sidescrolling platformers &quot;Gumshoe&quot; and &quot;Baby Boomer&quot; also support it. In some games, it can be used on the title screen to select a mode and start the game. Some games require the Zapper to be played (such as &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;, &quot;To the Earth&quot;, and &quot;Shooting Range&quot;), some can be played using either the Zapper or a controller (such as &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; and &quot;Mechanized Attack&quot;), and some have specific shooting-oriented levels that can be played using either the Zapper or a controller (such as &quot;The Adventures of Bayou Billy&quot;, &quot;Track &amp; Field II&quot;, and &quot;Chiller&quot;).

Some NES games were co-promoted with or designed for particular alternative light gun accessories. In North America, &quot;Laser Invasion&quot; came with a coupon for a discount for the LaserScope headset, although it can also be played with the regular Zapper. The Japan-only &quot;Space Shadow&quot; was bundled with, and can uniquely use the speakers and haptic feedback of, the Hyper Shot light gun.

==Operation==

When the Zapper&#x27;s trigger is pressed, the game causes the entire screen to become black for one frame. Then, on the next frame, all valid targets that are on screen are drawn all white as the rest of the screen remains black. The Zapper detects this change in light level and determines if any of the targets are in its hit zone. If a target is hit, the game determines which one was hit based on the time of the flash, as each target flashes for one video frame, one after another.

The Zapper can only be used on CRT displays; it will not work on LCDs, plasma displays or other flat panel displays due to display lag.

==Reception==
In February 1988, in a review of &quot;Gotcha! The Sport!&quot;, &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; magazine commented that there was &quot;always demand for a gun game [...] We know our Nintendo owners love games they can use with their Zappers&quot;. In July 1988, &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; opined that &quot;Freedom Force&quot; was Sunsoft&#x27;s &quot;best game yet. And they&#x27;ve made the best use yet of the Zapper light gun by building a game around a theme that&#x27;s as topical as the evening news: the taking of hostages by terrorists&quot;. Most of its survey respondents who own a game console also had a light gun. In August 1988, &quot;Antic&quot; magazine praised the Zapper&#x27;s accuracy compared to the poor horizontal accuracy of the Atari XG-1 light gun, saying &quot;if something is lined up in [Zapper&#x27;s] sights, that&#x27;s exactly what you hit&quot;.

Regarding Nintendo&#x27;s Trojan Horse strategy to convince retailers to stock the NES by marketing it as a toy for its launch, historian Chris Kohler said &quot;The gambit worked like a charm, and nobody missed R.O.B. or the Zapper once players realized that games played with the standard video game controller, like &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, were much more fun.&quot; Other commentators give more weight more to the promise to buy back any unsold stock. In the 2001 book &quot;The Ultimate History of Video Games&quot;, Steven L. Kent argues that &quot;most of the 500 retailers who sold the NES that Christmas might not have taken the merchandise if it were not for a risky offer made by [Nintendo of America President Minoru] Arakawa himself—a money-back guarantee.&quot;

==Legacy==
The Wii Zapper peripheral for the Wii console is a plastic casing for the Wii Remote attached to a Nunchuk that is held like a gun for point-and-shoot gameplay. It is not technically or visually similar to the Zapper. The Wii U Virtual Console re-releases of NES games can use the Wii Remote&#x27;s pointer as a virtual Zapper.

The Wii U game &quot;Splatoon&quot; and its Nintendo Switch sequels &quot;Splatoon 2&quot; and &quot;Splatoon 3&quot; all include several N-ZAP weapons, which are heavily based on the Zapper&#x27;s design. The N-ZAP &#x27;85 and N-ZAP &#x27;89 use the gray and orange colors of the Zapper respectively. The N-ZAP &#x27;83 appears in &quot;Splatoon&quot; and &quot;Splatoon 2&quot; only, with the red and gold from the original Famicom controller, but shaped like the Zapper.

<doc id="302051" wikidata="Q1820469" url="?curid=302051" title="Les Baxter">
<text>Leslie Thompson Baxter (March 14, 1922 – January 15, 1996) was an American musician, composer and conductor. After working as an arranger and composer for swing bands, he developed his own style of easy listening music, known as exotica and scored over 250 radio, television and motion pictures numbers.

==Early life==

Baxter studied piano at the Detroit Conservatory of Music before moving to Los Angeles for further studies at Pepperdine College. From 1943 on he played tenor and baritone saxophone for the Freddie Slack big band. Abandoning a concert career as a pianist, he turned to popular music as a singer. At the age of 23 he joined Mel Tormé&#x27;s Mel-Tones, singing on Artie Shaw records such as &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot;

==Career==
Baxter then turned to arranging and conducting for Capitol Records in 1950, and conducted the orchestra in two early Nat King Cole hits, &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and &quot;Too Young&quot;. He also recorded Yma Sumac&#x27;s first album: &quot;Voice of the Xtabay&quot;, which can be considered one of the first recordings of exotica. In 1951 he made the original recording of &quot;Quiet Village&quot; which years later became a hit for Martin Denny. In 1953 he scored his first movie, the sailing travelogue &quot;Tanga Tika&quot;.

With his own orchestra, he released a number of hits including &quot;Ruby&quot; (1953), &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; (1955), and &quot;The Poor People of Paris&quot; (1956), and is remembered for a version of &quot;Sinner Man&quot; (1956), definitively setting the sound with varying tempos, orchestral flourishes, and wailing background vocals.

&quot;Unchained Melody&quot; was the first million seller for Baxter and was awarded a gold disc.

&quot;The Poor People of Paris&quot; also sold over one million copies. He also achieved success with concept albums of his own orchestral suites: &quot;Le Sacre Du Sauvage&quot;, &quot;Festival Of The Gnomes&quot;, &quot;Ports Of Pleasure&quot;, and &quot;Brazil Now&quot;, the first three for Capitol and the fourth on Gene Norman&#x27;s Crescendo label. The list of musicians on these recordings includes Plas Johnson and Clare Fischer.

In the 1960s, he formed Les Baxter&#x27;s Balladeers, a conservative folk group in suits that at one time featured a young David Crosby. Later he used some of the same singers from that group for a studio project called The Forum. They had a minor hit in 1967 with their song &quot;The River Is Wide&quot; which implemented the Wall of Sound technique originally developed by Phil Spector. He worked in radio as musical director of &quot;The Halls of Ivy&quot; and the Bob Hope and Abbott and Costello shows.

Baxter worked in films in the 1960s and 1970s. He worked on movie scores for B-movie studio American International Pictures where he composed scores for Roger Corman&#x27;s Edgar Allan Poe films and other horror and beach party films including &quot;House of Usher&quot;, &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;, &quot;The Raven&quot;, &quot;Muscle Beach Party&quot; and &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot;. He also composed a new score for the theatrical release of the 1970 horror film &quot;Cry of the Banshee&quot; after AIP rejected Wilfred Josephs&#x27;s original one. Howard W. Koch recalled that Baxter composed, orchestrated and recorded the entire score of &quot;The Yellow Tomahawk&quot; (1954) in a total of three hours for $5,000.

When soundtrack work fell off in the 1980s, he scored music for theme parks such as SeaWorld.

Baxter died in Newport Beach, California at the age of 73. He was buried at Pacific View Memorial Park, in Corona del Mar, California.

==Controversy==

According to Milt Bernhart, Nelson Riddle was a ghostwriter for Baxter when Baxter was working for Nat King Cole, although while Baxter was working and was credited as a conductor for Nat King Cole, he never was officially credited as a composer or arranger. Bernhart states that Riddle told him that Baxter did not write the material on his exotica albums. Bernhart states that, while working for Baxter on recording a score for a Roger Corman film, it was apparent that Baxter could not conduct competently and &quot;couldn&#x27;t read the scores.&quot; According to Bernhart, &quot;Someone else had written [the music].&quot; But Baxter went on to write symphonies for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and guest conduct at the Hollywood Bowl.

Nelson Riddle held a grudge against Baxter for supposedly taking credit for Riddle&#x27;s arrangements on two Nat King Cole hit recordings. According to André Previn, when collaborating once with Baxter, in the time Previn and Riddle had finished their parts, Baxter had written just one bar for woodwinds and included a note for the oboe that does not exist on the instrument.

Gene Lees states that the exotica albums were written by Albert Harris and the material recorded with Yma Sumac was written by Pete Rugolo. According to Rugolo, he was paid $50 per arrangement to ghost for Les Baxter and that he &quot;did a whole album with Yma Sumac&quot;.

In a 1981 interview with &quot;Soundtrack&quot; magazine, Baxter said that these sorts of statements were the results of a smear campaign by a disgruntled orchestrator. According to Baxter, this resulted in Baxter being denied the chance to score for a major motion picture. The job went instead to Baxter&#x27;s friend Bronisław Kaper. Baxter said that he would give his compositions to orchestrators to arrange in order to cope with his hectic schedule.

Baxter&#x27;s frequent conductor and orchestrator Hall Daniels also said the criticisms were the result of &quot;sour grapes&quot; by people who held a grudge against Baxter for one reason or another.

Skip Heller spent time working for and studying under Baxter where he witnessed various score sheets of original Baxter compositions, including Yma Sumac&#x27;s &quot;Xtabay&quot; and &quot;Tumpa&quot;. According to Heller, they were all in Baxter&#x27;s own handwriting.

Furthermore, the Les Baxter papers, which are housed at the University of Arizona, show a significant number of arrangements in his own hand.

Baxter has a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6314 Hollywood Blvd.

<text>Audio system measurements are used to quantify audio system performance. These measurements are made for several purposes. Designers take measurements to specify the performance of a piece of equipment. Maintenance engineers make them to ensure equipment is still working to specification, or to ensure that the cumulative defects of an audio path are within limits considered acceptable. Audio system measurements often accommodate psychoacoustic principles to measure the system in a way that relates to human hearing.

== Subjectivity and frequency weighting ==
Subjectively valid methods came to prominence in consumer audio in the UK and Europe in the 1970s, when the introduction of compact cassette tape, dbx and Dolby noise reduction techniques revealed the unsatisfactory nature of many basic engineering measurements. The specification of weighted CCIR-468 quasi-peak noise, and weighted quasi-peak wow and flutter became particularly widely used and attempts were made to find more valid methods for distortion measurement.

Measurements based on psychoacoustics, such as the measurement of noise, often use a weighting filter. It is well established that human hearing is more sensitive to some frequencies than others, as demonstrated by equal-loudness contours, but it is not well appreciated that these contours vary depending on the type of sound. The measured curves for pure tones, for instance, are different from those for random noise. The ear also responds less well to short bursts, below 100 to 200 ms, than to continuous sounds such that a quasi-peak detector has been found to give the most representative results when noise contains click or bursts, as is often the case for noise in digital systems. For these reasons, a set of subjectively valid measurement techniques have been devised and incorporated into BS, IEC, EBU and ITU standards. These methods of audio quality measurement are used by broadcast engineers throughout most of the world, as well as by some audio professionals, though the older A-weighting standard for continuous tones is still commonly used by others.

No single measurement can assess audio quality. Instead, engineers use a series of measurements to analyze various types of degradation that can reduce fidelity. Thus, when testing an analogue tape machine it is necessary to test for wow and flutter and tape speed variations over longer periods, as well as for distortion and noise. When testing a digital system, testing for speed variations is normally considered unnecessary because of the accuracy of clocks in digital circuitry, but testing for aliasing and timing jitter is often desirable, as these have caused audible degradation in many systems.

Once subjectively valid methods have been shown to correlate well with listening tests over a wide range of conditions, then such methods are generally adopted as preferred. Standard engineering methods are not always sufficient when comparing like with like. One CD player, for example, might have higher measured noise than another CD player when measured with a RMS method, or even an A-weighted RMS method, yet sound quieter and measure lower when 468-weighting is used. This could be because it has more noise at high frequencies, or even at frequencies beyond , both of which are less important since human ears are less sensitive to them (see Noise shaping). This effect is how Dolby B works and why it was introduced. Cassette noise, which was predominately high frequency and unavoidable given the small size and speed of the recorded track could be made subjectively much less important. The noise sounded quieter, but failed to measure much better unless 468-weighting was used rather than A-weighting.

== Measurable performance ==

=== Analog electrical ===
; Frequency response 
: This measurement tells you over what frequency range output level for an audio component will remain reasonably constant (either within a specified decibel range or with reference to amplitude at 1 kHz). Preamplifiers may also contain equalizers for example to play LPs requiring RIAA frequency response correction, in which case the specification may describe how closely the response matches the standard. On the other hand, frequency range is a term sometimes used of loudspeakers and other transducers to indicate the frequencies that are usable, without necessarily specifying a decibel range. Power bandwidth is also related to frequency responseindicating the range of frequencies usable at high power.
: A component having a &quot;flat&quot; frequency response will reproduce content at all frequencies across the specified frequency range at the same intensity. The frequency range often specified for audio components is between to 20 kHz, which broadly reflects the human hearing range. Well-designed solid-state amplifiers and CD players may have a frequency response that varies by only 0.2 dB between 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Loudspeakers tend to have considerably less flat frequency responses than this.

; Total harmonic distortion (THD) 
: Music material contains distinct tones, and some types of distortion involve spurious tones at double or triple the frequencies of those tones. Such harmonically related distortion is called harmonic distortion. For high fidelity, this is usually expected to be &lt;1% for electronic devices; mechanical elements such as loudspeakers usually have inescapable higher levels. Low distortion is relatively easy to achieve in electronics with use of negative feedback, but the use of high levels of feedback in this manner has been the topic of controversy among audiophiles. Essentially all loudspeakers produce more distortion than electronics, and 1–5% distortion is not unheard of at moderately loud listening levels. Human ears are less sensitive to distortion in the low frequencies, and levels are usually expected to be under 10% at loud playback. Distortion that creates only even-order harmonics for a sine wave input is sometimes considered less intrusive than odd-order distortion.

; Output power
: Output power for amplifiers is ideally measured and quoted as maximum Root Mean Square (RMS) power output per channel, at a specified distortion level at a particular load, which, by convention and government regulation, is considered the most meaningful measure of power available on music signals, though real, non-clipping music has a high peak-to-average ratio, and usually averages well below the maximum possible. The commonly given measurement of PMPO (peak music power out) is largely meaningless and often used in marketing literature; in the late 1960s there was much controversy over this point and the US Government (FTA) required that RMS figures be quoted for all high fidelity equipment. Music power has been making a comeback in recent years. &quot;See also Audio power.&quot;
: Power specifications require the load impedance to be specified, and in some cases two figures will be given (for instance, the output power of a power amplifier for loudspeakers will be typically measured at 4 and 8 ohms).

; Intermodulation distortion (IMD) : Distortion that is not harmonically related to the signal being amplified is intermodulation distortion. It is a measure of the level of spurious signals resulting from unwanted combination of different frequency input signals. This effect results from non-linearities in the system. Sufficiently high levels of negative feedback can reduce this effect in an amplifier. Many believe it is better to design electronics in a way to minimize feedback levels, though this is difficult to achieve while meeting other high-accuracy requirements. Intermodulation in loudspeaker drivers is, as with harmonic distortion, almost always larger than in most electronics. IMD increases with cone excursion. Reducing a driver&#x27;s bandwidth directly reduces IMD. This is achieved by splitting the desired frequency range into separate bands and employing separate drivers for each band of frequencies, and feeding them through a crossover filter network. Steep slope crossover filters are most effective at IMD reduction, but may be too expensive to implement using high-current components and may introduce ringing distortion. Intermodulation distortion in multi-driver loudspeakers can be greatly reduced with the use of active crossover, though it significantly increases system cost and complexity.

; Noise : The level of unwanted noise generated by the system itself, or by interference from external sources added to the signal. Hum usually refers to noise only at power line frequencies (as opposed to broadband white noise), which is introduced through induction of power line signals into the inputs of gain stages, from inadequately regulated power supplies, or poor grounding of components. 

; Crosstalk : The introduction of noise (from another signal channel) caused by ground currents, stray inductance or capacitance between components or lines. Crosstalk reduces, sometimes noticeably, separation between channels (e.g., in a stereo system). A crosstalk measurement yields a figure in dB relative to a nominal level of signal in the path receiving interference. Crosstalk is normally only a problem in equipment that processes multiple audio channels in the same chassis.

; Common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) : In balanced audio systems, there are equal and opposite signals (difference-mode) in inputs, and any interference imposed on both leads will be subtracted, canceling out that interference (i.e., the common-mode). CMRR is a measure of a system&#x27;s ability to ignore such interference and especially hum at its input. It is generally only significant with long lines on an input, or when some kinds of ground loop problems exist. Unbalanced inputs do not have common mode resistance; induced noise on their inputs appears directly as noise or hum.

; Dynamic range &quot;and&quot; Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) : The difference between the maximum level a component can accommodate and the noise level it produces. Input noise is not counted in this measurement. It is measured in dB.
: &quot;Dynamic range&quot; refers to the ratio of maximum to minimum loudness in a given signal source (e.g., music or programme material), and this measurement also quantifies the maximum dynamic range an audio system can carry. This is the ratio (usually expressed in dB) between the noise floor of the device with no signal and the maximum signal (usually a sine wave) that can be output at a specified (low) distortion level.
:Since the early 1990s it has been recommended by several authorities including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media or muting circuits.

: &quot;Signal-to-noise ratio&quot; (SNR), however, is the ratio between the noise floor and an arbitrary reference level or alignment level. In &quot;professional&quot; recording equipment, this reference level is usually +4 dBu (IEC 60268-17), though sometimes 0 dBu (UK and Europe – EBU standard Alignment level). &#x27;Test level&#x27;, &#x27;measurement level&#x27; and &#x27;line-up level&#x27; mean different things, often leading to confusion. In &quot;consumer&quot; equipment, no standard exists, though −10 dBV and −6 dBu are common.
: Different media characteristically exhibit different amounts of noise and headroom. Though the values vary widely between units, a typical analogue cassette might give 60 dB, a CD almost 100 dB. Most modern quality amplifiers have &gt;110 dB dynamic range, which approaches that of the human ear, usually taken as around 130 dB. See Programme levels.

; Phase distortion&quot;, &quot;Group delay&quot;, and &quot;Phase delay : A perfect audio component will maintain the phase coherency of a signal over the full range of frequencies. Phase distortion can be extremely difficult to reduce or eliminate. The human ear is largely insensitive to phase distortion, though it is exquisitely sensitive to relative phase relationships within heard sounds. The complex nature of our sensitivity to phase errors, coupled with the lack of a convenient test that delivers an easily understood quality rating, is the reason that it is not a part of conventional audio specifications. Multi-driver loudspeaker systems may have complex phase distortions, caused or corrected by crossovers, driver placement, and the phase behaviour of the specific driver.

; Transient response : A system may have low distortion for a steady-state signal, but not on sudden transients. In amplifiers, this problem can be traced to power supplies in some instances, to insufficient high-frequency performance or to excessive negative feedback. Related measurements are slew rate and rise time. Distortion in transient response can be hard to measure. Many otherwise good power amplifier designs have been found to have inadequate slew rates, by modern standards. In loudspeakers, transient response performance is affected by the mass and resonances of drivers and enclosures and by group delay and phase delay introduced by crossover filtering or inadequate time alignment of the loudspeaker&#x27;s drivers. Most loudspeakers generate significant amounts of transient distortion, though some designs are less prone to this (e.g. electrostatic loudspeakers, plasma arc tweeters, ribbon tweeters and horn enclosures with multiple entry points).

; Damping factor : A higher number is generally believed to be better. This is a measure of how well a power amplifier controls the undesired motion of a loudspeaker driver. An amplifier must be able to suppress resonances caused by mechanical motion (e.g., inertia) of a speaker cone, especially a low-frequency driver with greater mass. For conventional loudspeaker drivers, this essentially involves ensuring that the output impedance of the amplifier is close to zero and that the speaker wires are sufficiently short and have sufficiently large diameter. Damping factor is the ratio of the output impedance of an amplifier and connecting cables to the DC resistance of a voice coil, which means that long, high resistance speaker wires will reduce the damping factor. A damping factor of 20 or greater is considered adequate for live sound reinforcement systems, as the SPL of inertia-related driver movement is 26 dB less than signal level and won&#x27;t be heard. Negative feedback in an amplifier lowers its effective output impedance and thus increases its damping factor.

=== Mechanical ===
; Wow and flutter : These measurements are related to physical motion in a component, largely the drive mechanism of analogue media, such as vinyl records and magnetic tape. &quot;Wow&quot; is slow speed (a few Hz) variation, caused by longer-term drift of the drive motor speed, whereas &quot;flutter&quot; is faster speed (a few tens of Hz) variations, usually caused by mechanical defects such as out-of-roundness of the capstan of a tape transport mechanism. The measurement is given in % and a lower number is better.

; Rumble : The measure of the low frequency (many tens of Hz) noise contributed by the turntable of an analogue playback system. It is caused by imperfect bearings, uneven motor windings, vibrations in driving bands in some turntables, room vibrations (e.g., from traffic) that is transmitted by the turntable mounting and so to the phono cartridge. A lower number is better.

=== Digital ===

Note that digital systems do not suffer from many of these effects at a signal level, though the same processes occur in the circuitry since the data being handled is &quot;symbolic&quot;. As long as the symbol survives the transfer between components, and can be perfectly regenerated (e.g., by pulse shaping techniques) the data itself is perfectly maintained. The data is typically buffered in a memory, and is clocked out by a very precise crystal oscillator. The data usually does not degenerate as it passes through many stages, because each stage regenerates new symbols for transmission.

Digital systems have their own problems. Digitizing adds noise, which is measurable and depends on the audio bit depth of the system, regardless of other quality issues. Timing errors in sampling clocks (jitter) result in non-linear distortion (FM modulation) of the signal. One quality measurement for a digital system (Bit Error Rate) relates to the probability of an error in transmission or reception. Other metrics on the quality of the system are defined by sample rate and bit depth. In general, digital systems are much less prone to error than analogue systems; However, nearly all digital systems have analogue inputs and/or outputs, and certainly all of those that interact with the analogue world do so. These analogue components of the digital system can suffer analogue effects and potentially compromise the integrity of a well designed digital system.

; Jitter : A measurement of the variation in period (periodic jitter) and absolute timing (random jitter) between measured clock timing versus an ideal clock. Less jitter is generally better for sampling systems.

; Sample rate : A specification of the rate at which measurements are taken of the analogue signal. This is measured in samples per second, or hertz. A higher sampling rate allows a greater total bandwidth or pass-band frequency response and allows less-steep anti-aliasing/anti-imaging filters to be used in the stop-band, which can in turn improve overall phase linearity in the pass-band.

; Bit depth : In Pulse-code modulation audio, the bit depth is the number of bits of information in each sample. Quantization, a process used in digital audio sampling, creates an error in the reconstructed signal. The Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio is a multiple of the bit depth.

:Audio CDs use a bit depth of 16-bits, while DVD-Video and Blu-ray discs can use 24-bit audio. The maximum dynamic range of a 16-bit system is about 96 dB, while for 24 bit it is about 144 dB.

:Dither can be used in audio mastering to randomize the quantization error, and some dither systems use Noise shaping to spectral shape of the quantization noise floor. The use of shaped dither can increase the effective dynamic range of 16-bit audio to around 120 dB.

:To calculate the maximum theoretical dynamic range of a digital system (Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR)) use the following algorithm for bit depth Q:
:formula_1

:Example: A 16-bit system has 216 different possibilities, from 0 – 65,535. The smallest signal without dithering is 1, so the number of different levels is one less, 216 − 1. 
:So for a 16-bit digital system, the Dynamic Range is 20·log(216 − 1) ≈ 96 dB.

; Sample accuracy/synchronisation : Not as much a specification as an ability. Since independent digital audio devices are each run by their own crystal oscillator, and no two crystals are exactly the same, sample rate will be slightly different. This will cause the devices to drift apart over time. The effects of this can vary. If one digital device is used to monitor another digital device, this will cause dropouts or distortion in the audio, as one device will be producing more or less data than the other per unit time. If two independent devices record at the same time, one will lag the other more and more over time. This effect can be circumvented with a word clock synchronization. It can also be corrected in the digital domain using a drift correction algorithm. Such an algorithm compares the relative rates of two or more devices and drops or adds samples from the streams of any devices that drift too far from the master device. Sample rate will also vary slightly over time, as crystals change in temperature, etc. See also clock recovery

; Linearity : &quot;Differential non-linearity&quot; and &quot;integral non-linearity&quot; are two measurements of the accuracy of an analog-to-digital converter. Basically, they measure how close the threshold levels for each bit are to the theoretical equally-spaced levels.

==Automated sequence testing==
Sequence testing uses a specific sequence of test signals, for frequency response, noise, distortion etc., generated and measured automatically to carry out a complete quality check on a piece of equipment or signal path. A single 32-second sequence was standardized by the EBU in 1985, incorporating 13 tones (40 Hz–15 kHz at −12 dB) for frequency response measurement, two tones for distortion (1024 Hz/60 Hz at +9 dB) plus crosstalk and compander tests. This sequence, which began with a 110-baud FSK signal for synchronizing purposes, also became CCITT standard O.33 in 1985.

Lindos Electronics expanded the concept, retaining the FSK concept, and inventing segmented sequence testing, which separated each test into a &#x27;segment&#x27; starting with an identifying character transmitted as 110-baud FSK so that these could be regarded as &#x27;building blocks&#x27; for a complete test suited to a particular situation. Regardless of the mix chosen, the FSK provides both identification and synchronization for each segment, so that sequence tests sent over networks and even satellite links are automatically responded to by measuring equipment. Thus TUND represents a sequence made up of four segments which test the alignment level, frequency response, noise and distortion in less than a minute, with many other tests, such as Wow and flutter, Headroom, and Crosstalk also available in segments as well as a whole.

The Lindos sequence test system is now a &#x27;de facto&#x27; standard in broadcasting and many other areas of audio testing, with over 25 different segments recognized by Lindos test sets, and the EBU standard is no longer used.

== Unquantifiable? ==

Many audio components are tested for performance using objective and quantifiable measurements, e.g., THD, dynamic range and frequency response. Some take the view that objective measurements are useful and often relate well to subjective performance, i.e., the sound quality as experienced by the listener. Floyd Toole has extensively evaluated loudspeakers in acoustical engineering research. In a peer reviewed scientific journal, Toole has presented findings that subjects have a range of abilities to distinguish good loudspeakers from bad, and that blind listening tests are more reliable than sighted tests. He found that subjects can more accurately perceive differences in speaker quality during monaural playback though a single loudspeaker, whereas subjective perception of stereophonic sound is more influenced by room effects. One of Toole&#x27;s papers showed that objective measurements of loudspeaker performance match subjective evaluations in listening tests.

Some argue that because human hearing and perception are not fully understood, listener experience should be valued above everything else. This is often encountered in the world of home audio publications. The usefulness of blind listening tests and common objective performance measurements, e.g., THD, are questioned. For instance, crossover distortion at a given THD is much more audible than clipping distortion at the same THD, since the harmonics produced are at higher frequencies. This does not imply that the defect is somehow unquantifiable or unmeasurable; just that a single THD number is inadequate to specify it and must be interpreted with care. Taking THD measurements at different output levels would expose whether the distortion is clipping (which increases with level) or crossover (which decreases with level).

Whichever the view, some measurements have been historically favoured. For example, THD is an average of a number of harmonics equally weighted, even though research identifies that lower order harmonics are harder to hear at the same level, compared with higher-order ones. In addition, even-order harmonics are said to be generally harder to hear than odd order. A number of formulas that attempt to correlate THD with actual audibility have been published, however, none have gained mainstream use.

The mass market consumer magazine &quot;Stereophile&quot; promotes the claim that home audio enthusiasts prefer sighted tests than blind tests.

<text>Martin Denny (April 10, 1911 – March 2, 2005) was an American pianist, composer, and arranger. Known as the &quot;father of exotica,&quot; he was a multi-instrumentalist and could play a number of percussion instruments. In a long career that saw him performing up to 3 weeks prior to his death, he toured the world popularizing his brand of lounge music which included exotic percussion, imaginative rearrangements of popular songs, and original songs that celebrated Tiki culture.

==Biography==
Denny was born in New York City and raised in Los Angeles. He studied classical piano and toured South America for four and a half years in the 1930s with the Don Dean Orchestra. This tour began Denny&#x27;s fascination with Latin rhythms. Denny collected a large number of ethnic instruments from all over the world, which he used to spice up his stage performances.

After serving in the United States Army Air Forces in World War II, Denny returned to Los Angeles in 1945 where he studied piano and composition under Dr. Wesley La Violette and orchestration under Arthur Lange at the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. He later studied at the University of Southern California.

In January 1954, Don the Beachcomber brought Denny to Honolulu, for a two-week engagement. He stayed to form his own combo in 1955, performing under contract at the Shell Bar in the Hawaiian Village on Oahu and soon signing to Liberty Records. The original combo consisted of Augie Colon on percussion and birdcalls, Arthur Lyman on vibes, John Kramer on string bass, and Denny on piano. Lyman soon left to form his own group and future Herb Alpert sideman and Baja Marimba Band founder Julius Wechter replaced him. Harvey Ragsdale later replaced Kramer.

&quot;We traveled a lot on the Mainland, but we came back every 12 weeks because the guys had their families here [in Hawaii],&quot; recalled Denny. In 1955, the musician met his future wife, June, and married her the following year. His daughter, Christina was born a few years later. &quot;I loved the lifestyle and my career was built here,&quot; said Denny.

Denny described the music his combo played as &quot;window dressing, a background&quot;. He built a collection of strange and exotic instruments with the help of several airline friends. They would bring Denny back these instruments and he would build arrangements around them. His music was a combination of ethnic styles: South Pacific, the Orient and Latin rhythms.

During an engagement at the Shell Bar, Denny discovered what would become his trademark and the birth of &quot;exotica&quot;. The bar had a very exotic setting: a little pool of water right outside the bandstand, rocks and palm trees growing around, very quiet and relaxed. As the group played at night, Denny became aware of bullfrogs croaking. The croaking blended with the music and when the band stopped, so did the frogs. He thought it was a coincidence at first, but when he tried the tune again later, the same thing happened. This time, his bandmates began doing all sorts of tropical bird calls as a gag. The band thought it nothing more than a joke. The next day, someone approached Denny and asked if he would do the arrangement with the birds and frogs. He agreed. At rehearsal, he had the band do &quot;Quiet Village&quot; with each doing a bird call spaced apart. Denny did the frog part on a grooved cylinder and the whole thing became incorporated into the arrangement of &quot;Quiet Village&quot;. It sold more than one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.

The album jacket was an influential factor guiding the fantasy of Denny&#x27;s music. Denny&#x27;s first dozen albums featured model Sandy Warner on the cover. 

The &quot;Exotica&quot; album was recorded in December 1956 and released in 1957. In 1958, Dick Clark hosted Denny on American Bandstand. &quot;Quiet Village&quot; reached #2 on Billboard&#x27;s charts in 1959 with the &quot;Exotica&quot; album reaching #1. He rode the charts of Cashbox and Variety also. Denny had as many as three or four albums on the charts simultaneously during his career. He had national hits with &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, &quot;The Enchanted Sea&quot;, and &quot;Ebb Tide&quot;.

Denny died in Honolulu on March 2, 2005, aged 93. Following a private memorial service, his ashes were scattered at sea.

==Legacy==
His combo spawned two successful offshoots: Julius Wechter (of Tijuana Brass and Baja Marimba Band fame) and exotica vibist Arthur Lyman.

Denny&#x27;s &quot;Firecracker&quot; is well known in Japan as the number which inspired Haruomi Hosono to establish Yellow Magic Orchestra; a &quot;subversive&quot; version of the song, according to Hosono, appears on the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album and was released as a single to promote it, charting at No. 60 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Singles charts. The song was later adapted into Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Real&quot;.

Former Psychic TV member Fred Giannelli released an album in 1991 entitled &quot;Fred&quot;; the second track on that album is &quot;Mr. Denny&quot;, an instrumental tribute to Martin Denny that features excerpts of an interview with him. 

Denny&#x27;s recordings are prominently featured in the 1999 film &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, based on the Kurt Vonnegut novel. This is primarily because the car dealership featured in the film is having a Hawaiian-based promotion.

Denny&#x27;s music is a recurring theme in the Sandman Slim series of fantasy novels by Richard Kadrey, where his music is always playing on the jukebox in the Bamboo House of Dolls, &quot;LA&#x27;s only punk tiki bar&quot;.

<text>A Monte Cristo sandwich is an egg-dipped (or batter-dipped) ham and cheese sandwich that is pan or deep fried. It is a variation of the French &quot;croque monsieur&quot;.

==History==
The first documented reference to a &quot;Monte Cristo Sandwich&quot; was in an American restaurant industry publication in 1923. From the 1930s to the 1960s, American cookbooks commonly had recipes for similar croque monsieur variants, under such names as &quot;French sandwich&quot;, &quot;toasted ham sandwich&quot;, and &quot;French toasted cheese sandwich&quot;. Though it is commonly claimed that the Monte Cristo sandwich was developed in the 1960s in Southern California, mentions of the sandwich by name in earlier decades and similar recipes appearing in cookbooks cast doubt on this claim. Nevertheless, the sandwich developed a larger popularity in the region, and it rose in popularity nationally after the Blue Bayou Restaurant in Disneyland began to serve the sandwich. The sandwich is heavily associated with the Bennigan&#x27;s restaurant chain.

==Description==
Depending on the regional variation, the sandwich can either be savory or a mixture of savory and sweet. In its most basic form, it is dipped in beaten egg and pan-fried, though it may also be deep-fried in beer or pancake batter. Regional variations may include sliced turkey or caramelized onions. Some variants are served grilled; in other variations, the Monte Cristo is served as an open sandwich, with only the bread egg-dipped and pan fried. In such cases, the fully assembled sandwich is then usually heated slightly under a grill or broiler. In sweeter variations, the Monte Cristo is often covered in powdered sugar and served with maple syrup or preserves.

<text>A croque monsieur () is a hot sandwich made with ham and cheese. The word &quot;croque&quot; is French for &quot;crunch&quot;.

== History ==
There are references to the dish before the end of the 19th century. In 1891, mentions them:
In the early 1900s, bistro owner popularized the name croque-monsieur by satirically using it after being accused of having human meat in his pork sandwiches.

==Preparation==
A croque monsieur is traditionally made with baked or boiled ham and sliced cheese between slices of &quot;pain de mie&quot;, topped with grated cheese and lightly salted and peppered, and then baked in an oven or fried in a frying pan. The bread may optionally be browned by grilling after being dipped in beaten egg. Traditionally Gruyère is used, but sometimes Comté or Emmental cheese as well. Some brasseries also add béchamel sauce.

Croque monsieur may be baked or fried so that the cheese topping melts and forms a crust.

==Variations==
A croque monsieur served with a poached or lightly fried egg on top is known as a &quot;croque madame&quot; (or, in parts of Normandy, as a &quot;croque-à-cheval&quot;). According to the &quot;Petit Robert&quot; dictionary, the name dates to around 1960. The name &quot;croque-mademoiselle&quot; is associated with its lighter, vegetarian version: made of the same bread, but with ordinary melting cheese, accompanied with chives, cucumber and lettuce.

In the United Kingdom, a ham-and-cheese hot snack is called a &quot;toastie&quot;, and toastie makers are available to buy. In the United States, the Monte Cristo (a ham-and-cheese sandwich often dipped in egg and fried) is popular fare in diners.

Variants of the sandwich with substitutions or additional ingredients are given names modeled on the original croque-monsieur, for example:

<doc id="302075" wikidata="Q2463769" url="?curid=302075" title="Mornay sauce">
<text>A Mornay sauce is a béchamel sauce with grated cheese added. The usual cheeses in French cuisine are Parmesan and Gruyère, but other cheeses may also be used. In French cuisine, it is often used in fish dishes. In American cuisine, a Mornay sauce made with cheddar is commonly used for macaroni and cheese.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name is uncertain. It may be named after Philippe, duc de Mornay (1549–1623), the French diplomat and writer, but a cheese sauce during this time would have to have been based on a velouté sauce because béchamel had not yet been developed, so the cheese sauce that the Duke would have known was different from the contemporary version.

&quot;Sauce Mornay&quot; does not appear in &quot;Le cuisinier Royal&quot;, 10th edition, 1820, perhaps because &quot;sauce Mornay&quot; is not older than the seminal Parisian restaurant Le Grand Véfour, where &quot;sauce Mornay&quot; was introduced.

==Ingredients==
Mornay sauce is a smooth sauce made from béchamel sauce (butter, flour, milk), grated cheese, salt, and pepper, and often enriched with egg yolk. When used for fish, the sauce is generally thinned with fish broth. The cheese may be Parmesan and Gruyère, Parmesan alone, Gruyère alone, or various other cheeses.

<doc id="302078" wikidata="Q413531" url="?curid=302078" title="Erucic acid">
<text>Erucic acid is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, denoted 22:1ω9. It has the chemical formula: . It is prevalent in wallflower seed and other plants in the family Brassicaceae, with a reported content of 20 to 54% in high erucic acid rapeseed oil and 42% in mustard oil. Erucic acid is also known as &quot;cis&quot;-13-docosenoic acid and the trans isomer is known as brassidic acid.

== Uses ==
Erucic acid is a precursor to brassylic acid, a C13-dicarboxylic acid that is used to make specialty polyamides and polyesters. The conversion entails ozonolysis, which selectively cleaves the C=C bond in erucic acid:

CH3(CH2)7CH\dCH(CH2)11CO2H + O3 + 0.5 O2 -&gt; CH3(CH2)7CO2H + HO2C(CH2)11CO2H

Amides of erucic acid are used as lubricants and surfactants.

Hydrogenation of erucic acid gives behenyl alcohol, , a pour point depressant (enabling liquids to flow at a lower temperature), and silver behenate, for use in photography.

== Sources of erucic acid ==

The name &quot;erucic&quot; means &quot;of or pertaining to &quot;Eruca&quot;&quot;, which is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. The genus includes colewort (&quot;E. sativa&quot;), which today is better known as arugula (US) or rocket (UK).

Erucic acid is produced naturally (together with other fatty acids) across a great range of green plants, but especially so in members of the genus &quot;Brassica&quot;. For industrial purposes and production of erucic acid, rapeseed is used; for food purposes a &#x27;low-erucic acid rapeseed&#x27; (LEAR) has been developed (canola), which contains fats derived from oleic acid instead of erucic acid.

== Biochemistry ==

Erucic acid is produced by elongation of oleic acid via oleoyl-coenzyme A and malonyl-CoA. Erucic acid is broken down into shorter-chain fatty acids in the human liver by the long-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase enzyme.

== Health effects ==

As early as 1977, the use of rapeseed oil was deemed safe as a food additive in the United States. 

In 2003, Food Standards Australia set a provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) for an average adult of about 500 mg/day of erucic acid, extrapolated based on &quot;the level that is associated with increased myocardial lipidosis in nursing pigs.&quot; &quot;There is a 120-fold safety margin between this level and the level that is associated with increased myocardial lipidosis in nursing pigs. The dietary exposure assessment has concluded that the majority of exposure to erucic acid by the general population would come from the consumption of colza oil. The dietary intake of erucic acid by an individual consuming at the average level is well below the PTDI; therefore, there is no cause for concern in terms of public health and safety. However, the individual consuming at a high level has the potential to approach the PTDI. This would be particularly so if the level of erucic acid in colza oil were to exceed 2% of the total fatty acids.&quot;

Food-grade rapeseed oil (also known as canola oil, rapeseed 00 oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, LEAR oil, and rapeseed canola-equivalent oil) is regulated to a maximum of 2% erucic acid by weight in the US and Europe.

<doc id="302082" wikidata="Q1969558" url="?curid=302082" title="Otomo Yoshihide">
<text>is a Japanese composer and multi-instrumentalist. He mainly plays guitar, turntables, and electronics.

He first came to international prominence in the 1990s as the leader of the experimental rock group Ground Zero, and has since worked in a variety of contexts, ranging from free improvisation to noise, jazz, avant-garde and contemporary classical. He is also a pioneering figure in the EAI-scene, and is featured on important records on labels like Erstwhile Records. He has composed music for many films, television dramas, and commercials. In 2017, Otomo became the 2nd Guest Artistic Director of The Sapporo International Art Festival 2017.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Otomo was born in Yokohama in 1959, but due to his father&#x27;s job, moved to Fukushima when he was nine years old. In high school, he frequented jazz cafés and started his own band. After entering university, he began studying under the improvisational jazz guitarist, Masayuki Takayanagi. He began performing around the world and released his first album in 1991 in Hong Kong. It was when the music he composed for a 1994 Hong Kong film was well received at the Cannes Film Festival that he also began to work as a composer.

===Film and television===
Otomo has composed music for a number of films and television programs, including Naoki Kato&#x27;s &quot;Abraxas&quot;, Tsuyoshi Inoue&#x27;s &quot;The Town&#x27;s Children&quot;, and Ryuichi Hiroki&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Elephant&quot;. He composed the music for the 2013 NHK morning television drama &quot;Amachan&quot; and it became his most commercially successful work up to that point. The soundtrack for &quot;Amachan&quot; reached number 5 on the Oricon Albums Chart, and Kyōko Koizumi&#x27;s version of the song &quot;Shiosai no Memorī&quot; from the drama, composed by Otomo, reached number 2 on the Oricon Singles Chart. He performed live on New Year&#x27;s Eve at the 2013 &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;.

<doc id="302084" wikidata="Q230533" url="?curid=302084" title="Decolonization">
<text>Decolonization is the undoing of colonialism, the latter being the process whereby imperial nations establish and dominate foreign territories, often overseas. The meanings and applications of the term are disputed. Some scholars of decolonization focus especially on independence movements in the colonies and the collapse of global colonial empires. 

As a movement to establish independence for colonized territories from their respective metropoles, decolonization began in 1775 in North America. Major waves of decolonization occurred in the aftermath of the First World War and most prominently after the Second World War.

Critical scholars extend the meaning beyond independence or equal rights for colonized peoples to include broader economic, cultural and psychological aspects of the colonial experience. Extending the meaning of decolonization beyond political independence has been disputed and received criticism.

==Scope==
The United Nations (UN) states that the fundamental right to self-determination is the core requirement for decolonization, and that this right can be exercised with or without political independence. A UN General Assembly Resolution in 1960 characterised colonial foreign rule as a violation of human rights. In states that have won independence, Indigenous people living under settler colonialism continue to make demands for decolonization and self-determination.

Although discussions of hegemony and power, central to the concept of decolonization, can be found as early as the writings of Thucydides, there have been several particularly active periods of decolonization in modern times. These include the decolonization of Africa, the breakup of the Spanish Empire in the 19th century; of the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires following World War I; of the British, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Belgian, Italian, and Japanese Empires following World War II; and of the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War.

Early studies of decolonisation appeared in the 1960s and 1970s. An important book from this period was &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; (1961) by Martiniquan author Frantz Fanon, which established many aspects of decolonisation that would be considered in later works. Subsequent studies of decolonisation addressed economic disparities as a legacy of colonialism as well as the annihilation of people&#x27;s cultures. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o explored the cultural and linguistic legacies of colonialism in the influential book &quot;Decolonising the Mind&quot; (1986).

&quot;Decolonization&quot; has also been used to refer to the intellectual decolonization from the colonizers&#x27; ideas that made the colonized feel inferior. Issues of decolonization persist and are raised contemporarily. In the Americas and South Africa, such issues are increasingly discussed under the term decoloniality.

== Independence movements ==
In the two hundred years following the American Revolutionary War in 1783, 165 colonies have gained independence from Western imperial powers. Several analyses point to different reasons for the spread of anti-colonial political movements. Institutional arguments suggest that increasing levels of education in the colonies led to calls for popular sovereignty; Marxist analyses view decolonization as a result of economic shifts toward wage labor and an enlarged bourgeois class; yet another argument sees decolonization as a diffusion process wherein earlier revolutionary movements inspired later ones. Other explanations emphasize how the lower profitability of colonization and the costs associated with empire prompted decolonization. Some explanations emphasize how colonial powers struggled militarily against insurgents in the colonies due to a shift from 19th century conditions of &quot;strong political will, a permissive international environment, access to local collaborators, and flexibility to pick their battles&quot; to 20th century conditions of &quot;apathetic publics, hostile superpowers, vanishing collaborators, and constrained options&quot;. In other words, colonial powers had more support from their own region in pursuing colonies in the 19th century than they did in the 20th century, where holding on to such colonies was often understood to be a burden.

A great deal of scholarship attributes the ideological origins of national independence movements to the Age of Enlightenment. Enlightenment social and political theories such as individualism and liberalism were central to the debates about national constitutions for newly independent countries. Contemporary decolonial scholarship has critiqued the emancipatory potential of Enlightenment thought, highlighting its erasure of Indigenous epistemologies and failure to provide subaltern and Indigenous people with liberty, equality, and dignity.

=== American Revolution ===
Great Britain&#x27;s Thirteen North American colonies were the first to declare independence, forming the United States of America in 1776, and defeating Britain in the Revolutionary War.

=== Haitian Revolution ===
The Haitian Revolution was a revolt in 1789 and subsequent slave uprising in 1791 in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. In 1804, Haiti secured independence from France as the Empire of Haiti, which later became a republic.

=== Spanish America ===

The chaos of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe cut the direct links between Spain and its American colonies, allowing for the process of decolonization to begin.

With the invasion of Spain by Napoleon in 1806, the American colonies declared autonomy and loyalty to King Ferdinand VII. The contract was broken and each of the regions of the Spanish Empire had to decide whether to show allegiance to the Junta of Cadiz (the only territory in Spain free from Napoleon) or have a junta (assembly) of its own. The economic monopoly of the metropolis was the main reason why many countries decided to become independent from Spain. In 1809, the independence wars of Latin America began with a revolt in La Paz, Bolivia. In 1807 and 1808, the Viceroyalty of the River Plate was invaded by the British. After their 2nd defeat, a Frenchman called Santiague de Liniers was proclaimed a new Viceroy by the local population and later accepted by Spain. In May 1810 in Buenos Aires, a Junta was created, but in Montevideo it was not recognized by the local government who followed the authority of the Junta of Cadiz. The rivalry between the two cities was the main reason for the distrust between them. During the next 15 years, the Spanish and Royalist on one side, and the rebels on the other fought in South America and Mexico. Numerous countries declared their independence. In 1824, the Spanish forces were defeated in the Battle of Ayacucho. The mainland was free, and in 1898, Spain lost Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Spanish–American War. Puerto Rico became an unincorporated territory of the US, but Cuba became independent in 1902.

=== Portuguese America ===

The Napoleonic Wars also led to the severing of the direct links between Portugal and its only American colony, Brazil. Days before Napoleon invaded Portugal, in 1807 the Portuguese royal court fled to Brazil. In 1820 there was a Constitutionalist Revolution in Portugal, which led to the return of the Portuguese court to Lisbon. This led to distrust between the Portuguese and the Brazilian colonists, and finally, in 1822, to the colony becoming independent as the Empire of Brazil, which later became a republic.

=== British Empire ===
The emergence of Indigenous political parties was especially characteristic of the British Empire, which seemed less ruthless than, for example, Belgium, in controlling political dissent. Driven by pragmatic demands of budgets and manpower the British made deals with the local politicians. Across the empire, the general protocol was to convene a constitutional conference in London to discuss the transition to greater self-government and then independence, submit a report of the constitutional conference to parliament, if approved submit a bill to Parliament at Westminster to terminate the responsibility of the United Kingdom (with a copy of the new constitution annexed), and finally, if approved, issuance of an Order of Council fixing the exact date of independence.

After World War I, several former German and Ottoman territories in the Middle East, Africa, and the Pacific were governed by the UK as League of Nations mandates. Some were administered directly by the UK, and others by British dominions – Nauru and the Territory of New Guinea by Australia, South West Africa by the Union of South Africa, and Western Samoa by New Zealand.
Egypt became independent in 1922, although the UK retained security prerogatives, control of the Suez Canal, and effective control of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The Balfour Declaration of 1926 declared the British Empire dominions as equals, and the 1931 Statute of Westminster established full legislative independence for them. The equal dominions were six– Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, the Irish Free State, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa; Ireland had been brought into a union with Great Britain in 1801 creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922. However, some of the Dominions were already independent de facto, and even de jure and recognized as such by the international community. Thus, Canada was a founding member of the League of Nations in 1919 and served on the council from 1927 to 1930. That country also negotiated on its own and signed bilateral and multilateral treaties and conventions from the early 1900s onward. Newfoundland ceded self-rule back to London in 1934. Iraq, a League of Nations mandate, became independent in 1932.

In response to a growing Indian independence movement, the UK made successive reforms to the British Raj, culminating in the Government of India Act 1935. These reforms included creating elected legislative councils in some of the provinces of British India. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, India&#x27;s independence movement leader, led a peaceful resistance to British rule. By becoming a symbol of both peace and opposition to British imperialism, many Indians began to view the British as the cause of India&#x27;s problems leading to a newfound sense of nationalism among its population. With this new wave of Indian nationalism, Gandhi was eventually able to garner the support needed to push back the British and create an independent India in 1947.
Africa was only fully drawn into the colonial system at the end of the 19th century. In the north-east the continued independence of the Ethiopian Empire remained a beacon of hope to pro-independence activists. However, with the anti-colonial wars of the 1900s (decade) barely over, new modernizing forms of Africa nationalism began to gain strength in the early 20th century with the emergence of Pan-Africanism, as advocated by the Jamaican journalist Marcus Garvey (1887–1940) whose widely distributed newspapers demanded swift abolition of European imperialism, as well as republicanism in Egypt. Kwame Nkrumah (1909–1972) who was inspired by the works of Garvey led Ghana to independence from colonial rule.

Independence for the colonies in Africa began with the independence of Sudan in 1956, and Ghana in 1957. All of the British colonies on mainland Africa became independent by 1966, although Rhodesia&#x27;s unilateral declaration of independence in 1965 was not recognized by the UK or internationally.

Some of the British colonies in Asia were directly administered by British officials, while others were ruled by local monarchs as protectorates or in subsidiary alliance with the UK.

In 1947, British India was partitioned into the independent dominions of India and Pakistan. Hundreds of princely states, states ruled by monarchs in a treaty of subsidiary alliance with Britain, were integrated into India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan fought several wars over the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. French India was integrated into India between 1950 and 1954, and India annexed Portuguese India in 1961, and the Kingdom of Sikkim merged with India by popular vote in 1975.

====Violence, civil warfare, and partition====

Significant violence was involved in several prominent cases of decolonization of the British Empire; partition was a frequent solution. In 1783, the North American colonies were divided between the independent United States, and British North America, which later became Canada.

The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India against British East India Company. It was characterized by massacres of civilians on both sides. It was not a movement for independence, however, and only a small part of India was involved. In the aftermath, the British pulled back from modernizing reforms of Indian society, and the level of organised violence under the British Raj was relatively small. Most of that was initiated by repressive British administrators, as in the Amritsar massacre of 1919, or the police assaults on the Salt March of 1930. Large-scale communal violence broke out between Hindus and Muslims and between Muslims and Sikhs after the British left in 1947 in the newly independent dominions of India and Pakistan. Much later, in 1970, further communal violence broke out within Pakistan in the detached eastern part of East Bengal, which became independent as Bangladesh in 1971.

Cyprus, which came under full British control in 1914 from the Ottoman Empire, was culturally divided between the majority Greek element (which demanded &quot;enosis&quot; or union with Greece) and the minority Turks. London for decades assumed it needed the island to defend the Suez Canal; but after the Suez crisis of 1956, that became a minor factor, and Greek violence became a more serious issue. Cyprus became an independent country in 1960, but ethnic violence escalated until 1974 when Turkey invaded and partitioned the island. Each side rewrote its own history, blaming the other.

Palestine became a British mandate from the League of Nations after World War I, initially including Transjordan. During that war, the British gained support from Arabs and Jews by making promises to both (see McMahon–Hussein Correspondence and Balfour Declaration). Decades of ethno—religious violence reached a climax with the UN Partition Plan and the ensuing war. The British eventually pulled out, and the former Mandate territory was divided between Israel, Jordan and Egypt.

===French Empire===


After World War I, the colonized people were frustrated at France&#x27;s failure to recognize the effort provided by the French colonies (resources, but more importantly colonial troops – the famous &quot;tirailleurs&quot;). Although in Paris the Great Mosque of Paris was constructed as recognition of these efforts, the French state had no intention to allow self-rule, let alone grant independence to the colonized people. Thus, nationalism in the colonies became stronger in between the two wars, leading to Abd el-Krim&#x27;s Rif War (1921–1925) in Morocco and to the creation of Messali Hadj&#x27;s Star of North Africa in Algeria in 1925. However, these movements would gain full potential only after World War II.

After World War I, France administered the former Ottoman territories of Syria and Lebanon, and the former German colonies of Togoland and Cameroon, as League of Nations mandates. Lebanon declared its independence in 1943, and Syria in 1945.

In some instances, decolonization efforts ran counter to other concerns, such as the rapid increase of antisemitism in Algeria in the course of the nation&#x27;s resistance to French rule.

Although France was ultimately a victor of World War II, Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of France and its North African colonies during the war had disrupted colonial rule. On 27 October 1946, France adopted a new constitution creating the Fourth Republic, and substituted the French Union for the colonial empire. However power over the colonies remained concentrated in France, and the power of local assemblies outside France was extremely limited. On the night of 29 March 1947, a Madagascar nationalist uprising led the French government headed by Paul Ramadier (Socialist) to violent repression: one year of bitter fighting, 11,000–40,000 Malagasy died.

In late 1946, Vietnam of French Indochina withdrew from the French Union, leading to the Indochina War (1946–54). France later recognized independence of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in 1949. France also recognized the unity of Vietnam and supported the anti-communist faction in this country against the expansion of communism in the name of anti-colonialism, the war thus became part of the world-wide Cold War. Cambodia and Laos became fully independent in late 1953, Vietnam became fully independent on 4 June 1954, and the Geneva Accords of 21 July 1954 left Vietnam divided into the North and South with the fact that France recognized communists gaining the North. After North Vietnamese military victory, Vietnam would be united under communism on 2 July 1976.

In 1956, Morocco and Tunisia gained their independence from France. In 1960, eight independent countries emerged from French West Africa, and five from French Equatorial Africa. The Algerian War of Independence raged from 1954 to 1962. To this day, the Algerian war – officially called a &quot;public order operation&quot; until the 1990s – remains a trauma for both France and Algeria. Philosopher Paul Ricœur has spoken of the necessity of a &quot;decolonisation of memory&quot;, starting with the recognition of the 1961 Paris massacre during the Algerian war, and the decisive role of African and especially North African immigrant manpower in the &quot;Trente Glorieuses&quot; post–World War II economic growth period. In the 1960s, due to economic needs for post-war reconstruction and rapid economic growth, French employers actively sought to recruit manpower from the colonies, explaining today&#x27;s multiethnic population.

=== After 1918 ===
==== United States ====
A union of former colonies itself, the United States approached imperialism differently from the other Powers. Much of its energy and rapidly expanding population was directed westward across the North American continent against English and French claims, the Spanish Empire and Mexico. The Native Americans were sent to reservations, often unwillingly. With support from Britain, its Monroe Doctrine reserved the Americas as its sphere of interest, prohibiting other states (particularly Spain) from recolonizing the newly independent polities of Latin America. However, France, taking advantage of the American government&#x27;s distraction during the Civil War, intervened militarily in Mexico and set up a French-protected monarchy. Spain took the step to occupy the Dominican Republic and restore colonial rule. The Union victory in the Civil War in 1865 forced both France and Spain to accede to American demands to evacuate those two countries. America&#x27;s only African colony, Liberia, was formed privately and achieved independence early; Washington unofficially protected it. By 1900, the U.S. advocated an Open Door Policy and opposed the direct division of China.

After 1898 direct intervention expanded in Latin America. The United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire in 1867 and annexed Hawaii in 1898. Following the Spanish–American War in 1898, the US added most of Spain&#x27;s remaining colonies: Puerto Rico, Philippines, and Guam. Deciding not to annex Cuba outright, the U.S. established it as a client state with obligations including the perpetual lease of Guantánamo Bay to the U.S. Navy. The attempt of the first governor to void the island&#x27;s constitution and remain in power past the end of his term provoked a rebellion that provoked a reoccupation between 1906 and 1909, but this was again followed by devolution. Similarly, the McKinley administration, despite prosecuting the Philippine–American War against a native republic, set out that the Territory of the Philippine Islands was eventually granted independence. In 1917, the U.S. purchased the Danish West Indies (later renamed the US Virgin Islands) from Denmark and Puerto Ricans became full U.S. citizens that same year. The US government declared Puerto Rico the territory was no longer a colony and stopped transmitting information about it to the United Nations Decolonization Committee. As a result, the UN General Assembly removed Puerto Rico from the U.N. list of non-self-governing territories. Four referendums showed little support for independence, but much interest in statehood such as Hawaii and Alaska received in 1959.

The Monroe Doctrine was expanded by the Roosevelt Corollary in 1904, providing that the United States had a right and obligation to intervene &quot;in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence&quot; that a nation in the Western Hemisphere became vulnerable to European control. In practice, this meant that the United States was led to act as a collections agent for European creditors by administering customs duties in the Dominican Republic (1905–1941), Haiti (1915–1934), and elsewhere. The intrusiveness and bad relations this engendered were somewhat checked by the Clark Memorandum and renounced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Good Neighbor Policy&quot;.

The Fourteen Points were preconditions addressed by President Woodrow Wilson to the European powers at the Paris Peace Conference following World War I. In allowing allies France and Britain the former colonial possessions of the German and Ottoman Empires, the US demanded of them submission to the League of Nations mandate, in calling for &quot;V. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable government whose title is to be determined.&quot; See also point XII.

After World War II, the U.S. poured tens of billions of dollars into the Marshall Plan, and other grants and loans to Europe and Asia to rebuild the world economy. At the same time American military bases were established around the world and direct and indirect interventions continued in Korea, Indochina, Latin America (&quot;inter alia&quot;, the 1965 occupation of the Dominican Republic), Africa, and the Middle East to oppose Communist movements and insurgencies. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States has been far less active in the Americas, but invaded Afghanistan and Iraq following the September 11 attacks in 2001, establishing army and air bases in Central Asia.

==== Japan ====

Before World War I, Japan had gained several substantial colonial possessions in East Asia such as Taiwan (1895) and Korea (1910). Japan joined the allies in World War I, and after the war acquired the South Seas Mandate, the former German colony in Micronesia, as a League of Nations Mandate. Pursuing a colonial policy comparable to those of European powers, Japan settled significant populations of ethnic Japanese in its colonies while simultaneously suppressing Indigenous ethnic populations by enforcing the learning and use of the Japanese language in schools. Other methods such as public interaction, and attempts to eradicate the use of Korean, Hokkien, and Hakka among the Indigenous peoples, were seen to be used. Japan also set up the Imperial Universities in Korea (Keijō Imperial University) and Taiwan (Taihoku Imperial University) to compel education.

In 1931, Japan seized Manchuria from the Republic of China, setting up a puppet state under Puyi, the last Manchu emperor of China. In 1933 Japan seized the Chinese province of Rehe, and incorporated it into its Manchurian possessions. The Second Sino-Japanese War started in 1937, and Japan occupied much of eastern China, including the Republic&#x27;s capital at Nanjing. An estimated 20 million Chinese died during the 1931–1945 war with Japan.

In December 1941, the empire of Japan joined World War II by invading the European and U.S. colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, including French Indochina, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, Portuguese Timor, and others. Following its surrender to the Allies in 1945, Japan was deprived of all its colonies with a number of them being returned to the original colonizing Western powers. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan in August 1945, and shortly after occupied and annexed the southern Kuril Islands, which Japan still claims.

=== After 1945 ===
==== Planning for decolonization ====
=====U.S. and Philippines=====
In the United States, the two major parties were divided on the acquisition of the Philippines, which became a major campaign issue in 1900. The Republicans, who favored permanent acquisition, won the election, but after a decade or so, Republicans turned their attention to the Caribbean, focusing on building the Panama Canal. President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat in office from 1913 to 1921, ignored the Philippines, and focused his attention on Mexico and Caribbean nations. By the 1920s, the peaceful efforts by the Filipino leadership to pursue independence proved convincing. When the Democrats returned to power in 1933, they worked with the Filipinos to plan a smooth transition to independence. It was scheduled for 1946 by Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934. In 1935, the Philippines transitioned out of territorial status, controlled by an appointed governor, to the semi-independent status of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Its constitutional convention wrote a new constitution, which was approved by Washington and went into effect, with an elected governor Manuel L. Quezon and legislature. Foreign Affairs remained under American control. The Philippines built up a new army, under general Douglas MacArthur, who took leave from his U.S. Army position to take command of the new army reporting to Quezon. The Japanese occupation 1942 to 1945 disrupted but did not delay the transition. It took place on schedule in 1946 as Manuel Roxas took office as president.

=====Portugal=====

As a result of its pioneering discoveries, Portugal had a large and particularly long-lasting colonial empire which had begun in 1415 with the conquest of Ceuta and ended only in 1999 with the handover of Portuguese Macau to China. In 1822, Portugal lost control of Brazil, its largest colony.

From 1933 to 1974, Portugal was an authoritarian state (ruled by António de Oliveira Salazar). The regime was fiercely determined to maintain the country&#x27;s colonial possessions at all costs and to aggressively suppress any insurgencies. In 1961, India annexed Goa and by the same year nationalist forces had begun organizing in Portugal. Revolts (preceding the Portuguese Colonial War) spread to Angola, Guinea Bissau and Mozambique. Lisbon escalated its effort in the war: for instance, it increased the number of natives in the colonial army and built strategic hamlets. Portugal sent another 300,000 European settlers into Angola and Mozambique before 1974. That year, a left-wing revolution inside Portugal overthrew the existing regime and encouraged pro-Soviet elements to attempt to seize control in the colonies. The result was a very long and extremely difficult multi-party Civil War in Angola, and lesser insurrections in Mozambique.

===== Belgium =====
Belgium&#x27;s empire began with the annexation of the Congo in 1908 in response to international pressure to bring an end to the terrible atrocities that had taken place under King Leopold&#x27;s privately run Congo Free State. It added Rwanda and Burundi as League of Nations mandates from the former German Empire in 1919. The colonies remained independent during the war, while Belgium was occupied by the Germans. There was no serious planning for independence, and exceedingly little training or education provided. The Belgian Congo was especially rich, and many Belgian businessmen lobbied hard to maintain control. Local revolts grew in power and finally, the Belgian king suddenly announced in 1959 that independence was on the agenda – and it was hurriedly arranged in 1960, for country bitterly and deeply divided on social and economic grounds.

===== Netherlands =====

The Netherlands had spent centuries building up its empire. By 1940 it consisted mostly of the Dutch East Indies, corresponding to what is now Indonesia. Its massive oil reserves provided about 14 percent of the Dutch national product and supported a large population of ethnic Dutch government officials and businessmen in Batavia (now Jakarta) and other major cities. The Netherlands was overrun and almost starved to death by the Nazis during the war, and Japan sank the Dutch fleet in seizing the East Indies. In 1945 the Netherlands could not regain these islands on its own; it did so by depending on British military help and American financial grants. By the time Dutch soldiers returned, an independent government under Sukarno was in power, originally set up by the Empire of Japan. The Dutch both abroad and at home generally agreed that Dutch power depended on an expensive war to regain the islands. Compromises were negotiated, but were trusted by neither side. When the Indonesian Republic successfully suppressed a large-scale communist revolt, the United States realized that it needed the nationalist government as an ally in the Cold War. Dutch possession was an obstacle to American Cold War goals, so Washington forced the Dutch to grant full independence. A few years later, Sukarno nationalized all Dutch East Indies properties and expelled all ethnic Dutch—over 300,000—as well as several hundred thousand ethnic Indonesians who supported the Dutch cause. In the aftermath, the Netherlands prospered greatly in the 1950s and 1960s but nevertheless public opinion was bitterly hostile to the United States for betrayal. The Dutch government eventually gave up on claims to Indonesian sovereignty in 1949, after American pressure. The Netherlands also had one other major colony, Dutch Guiana in South America, which became independent as Suriname in 1975.

==== United Nations trust territories ====
When the United Nations was formed in 1945, it established trust territories. These territories included the League of Nations mandate territories which had not achieved independence by 1945, along with the former Italian Somaliland. The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands was transferred from Japanese to US administration. By 1990 all but one of the trust territories had achieved independence, either as independent states or by merger with another independent state; the Northern Mariana Islands elected to become a commonwealth of the United States.

==== The emergence of the Third World (1945–present) ====

Newly independent states organised themselves in order to oppose continued economic colonialism by former imperial powers. The Non-Aligned Movement constituted itself around the main figures of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, Sukarno, the Indonesian president, Josip Broz Tito the Communist leader of Yugoslavia, and Gamal Abdel Nasser, head of Egypt. In 1955 these leaders gathered at the Bandung Conference along with Sukarno, the leader of Indonesia, and Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 1960, the UN General Assembly voted on the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The next year, the first Non-Aligned Movement conference was held in Belgrade (1961), and was followed in 1964 by the creation of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) which tried to promote a New International Economic Order (NIEO). The NIEO was opposed to the 1944 Bretton Woods system, which had benefited the leading states which had created it, and remained in force until 1971 after the United States&#x27; suspension of convertibility from dollars to gold. The main principles of the NIEO are:

# The sovereign equality of all States, with non-interference in their internal affairs, their effective participation in solving world problems and the right to adopt their own economic and social systems;
# Full sovereignty of each State over its natural resources and other economic activities necessary for development, as well as regulation of transnational corporations;
# Just and equitable relationship between the price of raw materials and other goods exported by developing countries, and the prices of raw materials and other goods exported by the developed countries;
# Strengthening of bilateral and multilateral international assistance to promote industrialization in the developing countries through, in particular, the provisioning of sufficient financial resources and opportunities for transfer of appropriate techniques and technologies.
The UNCTAD however was not very effective in implementing the NIEO, and social and economic inequalities between industrialized countries and the Third World grew throughout the 1960s until the 21st century. The 1973 oil crisis which followed the Yom Kippur War (October 1973) was triggered by the OPEC which decided an embargo against the US and Western countries, causing a fourfold increase in the price of oil, which lasted five months, starting on 17 October 1973, and ending on 18 March 1974. OPEC nations then agreed, on 7 January 1975, to raise crude oil prices by 10%. At that time, OPEC nations – including many who had recently nationalized their oil industries – joined the call for a New International Economic Order to be initiated by coalitions of primary producers. Concluding the First OPEC Summit in Algiers they called for stable and just commodity prices, an international food and agriculture program, technology transfer from North to South, and the democratization of the economic system. But industrialized countries quickly began to look for substitutes to OPEC petroleum, with the oil companies investing the majority of their research capital in the US and European countries or others, politically sure countries. The OPEC lost more and more influence on the world prices of oil.

The second oil crisis occurred in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Then, the 1982 Latin American debt crisis exploded in Mexico first, then Argentina and Brazil, which proved unable to pay back their debts, jeopardizing the existence of the international economic system.

The 1990s were characterized by the prevalence of the Washington consensus on neoliberal policies, &quot;structural adjustment&quot; and &quot;shock therapies&quot; for the former Communist states.

====Decolonization of Africa====

The decolonization of North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa took place in the mid-to-late 1950s, very suddenly, with little preparation. There was widespread unrest and organized revolts, especially in French Algeria, Portuguese Angola, the Belgian Congo and British Kenya.

In 1945, Africa had four independent countries – Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia, and South Africa.

After Italy&#x27;s defeat in World War II, France and the UK occupied the former Italian colonies. Libya became an independent kingdom in 1951. Eritrea was merged with Ethiopia in 1952. Italian Somaliland was governed by the UK, and by Italy after 1954, until its independence in 1960.

By 1977, European colonial rule in mainland Africa had ended. Most of Africa&#x27;s island countries had also become independent, although Réunion and Mayotte remain part of France. However the black majorities in Rhodesia and South Africa were disenfranchised until 1979 in Rhodesia, which became Zimbabwe-Rhodesia that year and Zimbabwe the next, and until 1994 in South Africa. Namibia, Africa&#x27;s last UN Trust Territory, became independent of South Africa in 1990.

Most independent African countries exist within prior colonial borders. However Morocco merged French Morocco with Spanish Morocco, and Somalia formed from the merger of British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland. Eritrea merged with Ethiopia in 1952, but became an independent country in 1993.

Most African countries became independent as republics. Morocco, Lesotho, and Eswatini remain monarchies under dynasties that predate colonial rule. Burundi, Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia gained independence as monarchies, but all four countries&#x27; monarchs were later deposed, and they became republics.

African countries cooperate in various multi-state associations. The African Union includes all 55 African states. There are several regional associations of states, including the East African Community, Southern African Development Community, and Economic Community of West African States, some of which have overlapping membership.

* : Netherlands Antilles, Suriname (1954, both becoming constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), 1975 (independence of Suriname)
* : Greenland (1979, became an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark).

==== Decolonization of Asia ====

Japan expanded its occupation of Chinese territory during the 1930s, and occupied Southeast Asia during World War II. After the war, the Japanese colonial empire was dissolved, and national independence movements resisted the re-imposition of colonial control by European countries and the United States.

The Republic of China regained control of Japanese-occupied territories in Manchuria and eastern China, as well as Taiwan. Only Hong Kong and Macau remained in outside control until both places were transferred to the People&#x27;s Republic of China by the UK and Portugal in 1997 and 1999.

The Allied powers divided Korea into two occupation zones, which became the states of North Korea and South Korea. The Philippines became independent of the U.S. in 1946.

The Netherlands recognized Indonesia&#x27;s independence in 1949, after a four-year independence struggle. Indonesia annexed Netherlands New Guinea in 1963, and Portuguese Timor in 1975. In 2002, former Portuguese Timor became independent as East Timor.

The following list shows the colonial powers following the end of hostilities in 1945, and their colonial or administrative possessions. The year of decolonization is given chronologically in parentheses.
* : Transjordan (1946), British India and Pakistan (1947); British Mandate of Palestine, Burma and Ceylon (1948); British Malaya (1957); Kuwait (1961); Kingdom of Sarawak, North Borneo and Singapore (1963); Maldives (1965); Aden (1967); Bahrain, Qatar and United Arab Emirates (1971); Brunei (1984); Hong Kong (1997)

* : Indonesia (1949)

==== Decolonization in Europe ====
Italy had occupied the Dodecanese islands in 1912, but Italian occupation ended after World War II, and the islands were integrated into Greece. British rule ended in Cyprus in 1960, and Malta in 1964, and both islands became independent republics.

Soviet control of its non-Russian member republics weakened as movements for democratization and self-government gained strength during the late 1980s, and four republics declared independence in 1990 and 1991. The Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt in August 1991 accelerated the breakup of the USSR, which formally ended on 26 December 1991. The Republics of the Soviet Union became sovereign states—Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus (formerly called Byelorussia,) Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Historian Robert Daniels says, &quot;A special dimension that the anti-Communist revolutions shared with some of their predecessors was decolonization.&quot; Moscow&#x27;s policy had long been to settle ethnic Russians in the non-Russian republics. After independence, minority rights have been an issue for Russian-speakers in some republics and for non-Russian-speakers in Russia; see Russians in the Baltic states. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation continues to apply political, economic, and military pressure on former Soviet colonies. In 2014, it annexed Ukraine&#x27;s Crimean peninsula, the first such action in Europe since the end of the Second World War. In March 2023, following the 2022 Russian invasion and subsequent Russian occupation of parts of Ukraine, Ukraine passed a law that did forbid to have toponymy with names associated with Russian (&quot;the occupying state&quot;). This law in particular has been described by Ukrainian media as providing &quot;a legitimate framework and effective mechanisms&quot; for the decolonization of Ukraine.

After the 2022 Russian invasion, scholars of Eastern Europe and Central Asia Studies (&quot;Russian studies&quot;) have renewed awareness of Russian colonialism and interest in decolonizing scholarship in their field, with academic conferences organized on the theme by the Centre for Baltic and East European Studies (CBEES) in Stockholm in December 2022, the British Association for Slavonic and Eastern European Studies (BASEES) in April 2023, the Aleksanteri Institute in October, and the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES) in Philadelphia in November–December.

==== Decolonization of Oceania ====

The decolonization of Oceania occurred after World War II when nations in Oceania achieved independence by transitioning from European colonial rule to full independence.
* : Tonga and Fiji (1970); Solomon Islands and Tuvalu (1978); Kiribati (1979)
* and : Vanuatu (1980)
* : Nauru (1968); Papua New Guinea (1975)
* : Samoa (1962)
* : Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia (1986); Palau (1994)

== Challenges ==
Typical challenges of decolonization include state-building, nation-building, and economic development.

=== State-building ===

After independence, the new states needed to establish or strengthen the institutions of a sovereign state – governments, laws, a military, schools, administrative systems, and so on. The amount of self-rule granted prior to independence, and assistance from the colonial power and/or international organizations after independence, varied greatly between colonial powers, and between individual colonies.

Except for a few absolute monarchies, most post-colonial states are either republics or constitutional monarchies. These new states had to devise constitutions, electoral systems, and other institutions of representative democracy.

=== Nation-building ===

Nation-building is the process of creating a sense of identification with, and loyalty to, the state. Nation-building projects seek to replace loyalty to the old colonial power, and/or tribal or regional loyalties, with loyalty to the new state. Elements of nation-building include creating and promoting symbols of the state like a flag, a coat of arms and an anthem, monuments, official histories, national sports teams, codifying one or more Indigenous official languages, and replacing colonial place-names with local ones. Nation-building after independence often continues the work began by independence movements during the colonial period.

==== Language policy ====
From the perspective of language policy (or language politics), &quot;linguistic decolonization&quot; entails the replacement of a colonizing (imperial) power&#x27;s language with a given colony&#x27;s indigenous language in the function of official language. With the exception of colonies in Eurasia, linguistic decolonization did not take place in the former colonies-turned-independent states on the other continents (&quot;Rest of the World&quot;). Linguistic imperialism is the imposition and enforcement of one dominant language over other languages, and one response to this form of imperialism is linguistic decolonization.

==== Settled populations ====

Decolonization is not an easy matter in colonies with large settler populations, particularly if they have been there for several generations. When settlers remain in former colonies after independence, colonialism is ongoing and takes the form of settler colonialism, which is highly resistant to decolonisation. Repatriation of existing colonizers or prevention of immigration of additional colonizers can be seen as opposition to immigration.

In a few cases, settler populations have been repatriated. For instance, the decolonization of Algeria by France was particularly uneasy due to the large European population (see also &quot;pied noir&quot;), which largely evacuated to France when Algeria became independent. In Zimbabwe, former Rhodesia, Robert Mugabe seized property from white African farmers, killing several of them, and forcing the survivors to emigrate. A large Indian community lived in Uganda as a result of Britain colonizing both India and East Africa, and Idi Amin expelled them for domestic political gain. 

====Cinematography====
Kenyan writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o has written about colonization and decolonization in the film universe. Born in Ethiopia, filmmaker Haile Gerima describes the &quot;colonization of the unconscious&quot; he describes experiencing as a child:
...as kids, we tried to act out the things we had seen in the movies. We used to play cowboys and Indians in the mountains around Gondar...We acted out the roles of these heroes, identifying with the cowboys conquering the Indians. We didn&#x27;t identify with the Indians at all and we never wanted the Indians to win. Even in Tarzan movies, we would become totally galvanized by the activities of the hero and follow the story from his point of view, completely caught up in the structure of the story. Whenever Africans sneaked up behind Tarzan, we would scream our heads off, trying to warn him that &#x27;they&#x27; were coming&quot;.
In Asia, kung fu cinema emerged at a time Japan wanted to reach Asian populations in other countries by way of its cultural influence. The surge in popularity of kung fu movies began in the late 1960s through the 1970s. Local populations were depicted as protagonists opposing &quot;imperialists&quot; (foreigners) and their &quot;Chinese collaborators&quot;.

=== Economic development ===

Newly independent states also had to develop independent economic institutions – a national currency, banks, companies, regulation, tax systems, etc.

Many colonies were serving as resource colonies which produced raw materials and agricultural products, and as a captive market for goods manufactured in the colonizing country. Many decolonized countries created programs to promote industrialization. Some nationalized industries and infrastructure, and some engaged in land reform to redistribute land to individual farmers or create collective farms.

Some decolonized countries maintain strong economic ties with the former colonial power. The CFA franc is a currency shared by 14 countries in West and Central Africa, mostly former French colonies. The CFA franc is guaranteed by the French treasury.

After independence, many countries created regional economic associations to promote trade and economic development among neighboring countries, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Gulf Cooperation Council.

==== Effects on the colonizers ====
John Kenneth Galbraith argues that the post–World War II decolonization was brought about for economic reasons. In &quot;A Journey Through Economic Time&quot;, he writes: &quot;The engine of economic well-being was now within and between the advanced industrial countries. Domestic economic growth – as now measured and much discussed – came to be seen as far more important than the erstwhile colonial trade... The economic effect in the United States from the granting of independence to the Philippines was unnoticeable, partly due to the Bell Trade Act, which allowed American monopoly in the economy of the Philippines. The departure of India and Pakistan made small economic difference in the United Kingdom. Dutch economists calculated that the economic effect from the loss of the great Dutch empire in Indonesia was compensated for by a couple of years or so of domestic post-war economic growth. The end of the colonial era is celebrated in the history books as a triumph of national aspiration in the former colonies and of benign good sense on the part of the colonial powers. Lurking beneath, as so often happens, was a strong current of economic interest – or in this case, disinterest.&quot;

In general, the release of the colonized caused little economic loss to the colonizers. Part of the reason for this was that major costs were eliminated while major benefits were obtained by alternate means. Decolonization allowed the colonizer to disclaim responsibility for the colonized. The colonizer no longer had the burden of obligation, financial or otherwise, to their colony. However, the colonizer continued to be able to obtain cheap goods and labor as well as economic benefits (see Suez Canal Crisis) from the former colonies. Financial, political and military pressure could still be used to achieve goals desired by the colonizer. Thus decolonization allowed the goals of colonization to be largely achieved, but without its burdens.

== Assassinated anti-colonialist leaders ==
A &quot;non-exhaustive&quot; list of assassinated leaders would include:
== Current colonies ==
The United Nations, under &quot;Chapter XI: Declaration Regarding Non-Self Governing Territories&quot; of the Charter of the United Nations, defines Non-Self Governing Nations (NSGSs) as &quot;territories whose people have not yet attained a full measure of self-government&quot;—the contemporary definition of colonialism. After the conclusion of World War II with the surrender of the Axis Powers in 1945, and two decades into the latter half of the 20th century, over three dozen &quot;states in Asia and Africa achieved autonomy or outright independence&quot; from European administering powers. As of 2020, 17 territories remain under Chapter XI distinction:

=== United Nations NSGS list ===

&quot;On 26 February 1976, Spain informed the Secretary-General that as of that date it had terminated its presence in the Territory of the Sahara and deemed it necessary to place on record that Spain considered itself thenceforth exempt from any responsibility of any international nature in connection with the administration of the Territory, in view of the cessation of its participation in the temporary administration established for the Territory. In 1990, the General Assembly reaffirmed that the question of Western Sahara was a question of decolonization which remained to be completed by the people of Western Sahara.&quot;

On 10 December 2010, the United Nations published its official decree, announcing the &quot;Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism&quot; wherein the United Nations declared its &quot;renewal of the call to States Members of the United Nations to speed up the process of decolonization towards the complete elimination of colonialism&quot;. According to an article by scholar John Quintero, &quot;given the modern emphasis on the equality of states and inalienable nature of their sovereignty, many people do not realize that these non-self-governing structures still exist&quot;. Some activists have claimed that the attention of the United Nations was &quot;further diverted from the social and economic agenda [for decolonization] towards &quot;firefighting and extinguishing&quot; armed conflicts&quot;. Advocates have stressed that the United Nations &quot;[remains] the last refuge of hope for peoples under the yolk &quot;[sic]&quot; of colonialism&quot;. Furthermore, on 19 May 2015, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon addressed the attendants of the Caribbean Regional Seminar on Decolonization, urging international political leaders to &quot;build on [the success of precedent decolonization efforts and] towards fully eradicating colonialism by 2020&quot;.

The sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean is disputed between the United Kingdom and Mauritius. In February 2019, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that the United Kingdom must transfer the islands to Mauritius as they were not legally separated from the latter in 1965. On 22 May 2019, the United Nations General Assembly debated and adopted a resolution that affirmed that the Chagos Archipelago &quot;forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius&quot;. The UK does not recognize Mauritius&#x27; sovereignty claim over the Chagos Archipelago. In October 2020, Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth described the British and American governments as &quot;hypocrites&quot; and &quot;champions of double talk&quot; over their response to the dispute.

===Settler colonies===

Some authors contend that even in countries that have become politically independent from a former colonial power, indigenous peoples may still in effect be living under the impacts of colonization. In a 2023 paper on the political theory of settler colonialism, Canadian academics Yann Allard-Tremblay and Elaine Coburn posit that: &quot;In Africa, the Middle East, South America, and much of the rest of the world, decolonization often meant the expulsion or departure of most colonial settlers. In contrast, in settler colonial states like New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the United States, settlers have not left, even as independence from the metropole was gained... The systemic oppression and domination of the colonized by the colonizer is not historical — firmly in the past — but ongoing and supported by radically unequal political, social, economic, and legal institutions.&quot;

== Consequences of decolonization ==
A 2019 study found that &quot;democracy levels increased sharply as colonies gained internal autonomy in the period immediately before their independence. However, conflict, revenue growth, and economic growth did not systematically differ before and after independence.&quot;

According to political theorist Kevin Duong, decolonization &quot;may have been the century&#x27;s greatest act of disenfranchisement&quot;, as numerous anti-colonial activists primarily pursued universal suffrage within empires rather than independence: &quot;As dependent territories became nation-states, they lost their voice in metropolitan assemblies whose affairs affected them long after independence.&quot;

David Strang writes that the loss of their empires turned France and Britain into &quot;second-rate powers&quot;.

<text>Sorrell Booke (January 4, 1930 – February 11, 1994) was an American actor who performed on stage, screen, and television. He acted in more than 100 plays and 150 television shows, and is best known for his role as corrupt politician Jefferson Davis &quot;Boss&quot; Hogg in the television show &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Booke was born in Buffalo, New York, the son of Sol Booke, a physician. As a child, he entertained patients in his father&#x27;s waiting room, and began acting on radio at nine. As a young radio actor he was known for his impersonations. He won a radio contest for mimicking the voice of Adolf Hitler, and appeared regularly as an actor on local radio stations WGR and WEBR. He attended Bennett High School and was valedictorian of the Class of 1946.

Booke enrolled in Columbia University at 16, and performed in Shakespearean plays in Columbia&#x27;s drama club. He graduated from Columbia at 19 in 1949, and received a Master of Fine Arts at the Yale School of Drama. He once starred in a stage production of Beethoven with Paul Newman while at Yale.[Paul Newman, The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man, page 90] He served in the United States Army during the Korean War for two years as a counterintelligence officer.

==Career==
After his Army service, Booke appeared off-Broadway in &quot;The White Devil&quot; and had his first television role in the series &quot;Omnibus&quot;. His Broadway debut was in 1956, in Michael Redgrave&#x27;s production of &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot;. One prominent early role was that of Senator Billboard T. Rawkins in the 1960 revival of &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow.&quot; He also appeared in the films &quot;Black Like Me&quot;, &quot;A Fine Madness&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; and &quot;Fail Safe&quot;. In 1962, he starred in the Broadway musical &quot;Fiorello!&quot; as the title character.

Aside from his film roles, he appeared on numerous television shows such as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High.&quot; 

He worked as a voice actor in the 1980s and early 1990s. Booke also was a guest conductor at the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra.

Booke received an Emmy nomination for his appearance in &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; in the episode &quot;What&#x27;s God to Julius?&quot;. He appeared in an episode of &quot;&quot; from the first season in 1966. Booke appeared in two early episodes of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, as General Barker in &quot;Requiem for a Lightweight&quot; and &quot;Chief Surgeon Who?&quot;; the latter marked the debut of the character Corporal Klinger, with whom Booke&#x27;s character had previously dealt. He also had a recurring role in &quot;All in the Family&quot; as Mr. Sanders, personnel manager at Archie Bunker&#x27;s workplace, Prendergast Tool and Die Company. (He had previously appeared on &quot;All in the Family&quot; as Lyle Bennett, the manager of a local television station.) Booke was featured on an episode of &quot;Good Times&quot;, and had a recurring role as the Jewish mob boss &quot;Lefkowitz&quot; on &quot;Soap&quot;. He also appeared in two episodes of &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Swan Song&quot; in Season 3 (featuring Johnny Cash) and &quot;The Bye-Bye Sky High I.Q. Murder Case&quot; in Season 6. In 1976 he played a record producer in &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man Book II&quot;.

Booke&#x27;s most notable role was in &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; as Boss Hogg, the humorously wicked antagonist to Bo and Luke Duke. The series ran on CBS for seven seasons, from 1979 to 1985. It spawned an animated series, &quot;The Dukes&quot; (1983), two reunion TV specials (by which time Booke had died, and the character of Boss Hogg was also said to be deceased), a feature film (2005) and &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning&quot; (a 2007 TV movie).

By the late 1980s, Booke had stopped appearing physically in acting roles, but he continued to perform voice work on several television shows and movies, occasionally as narrator, and sometimes as a cartoon character&#x27;s voice, in such movies as &quot;Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers&quot; (1987 television movie), &quot;Gravedale High&quot; (1990 television series), and &quot;Rock-a-Doodle&quot; (1991).

==Personal life==
Booke was tall, weighed at the time of his Boss Hogg role, and wore padding to seem fatter. He copied the Hogg character&#x27;s American South drawl from U.S. senators Sam Ervin and Strom Thurmond.

Booke was fluent in English, French, Japanese, Spanish, Russian, and Italian. He said that he also “fussed&quot; with a half-dozen other languages such as Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Dutch, Persian, Polish, and Swedish. One of his hobbies was moving into and restoring rundown houses. In 1981, he lived in a &quot;modest home on a modest street in Los Angeles&quot;, where he did his own gardening and carpentry. He called his Boss Hogg character &quot;despicable&quot;, but enjoyed meeting fans of the show.

Booke married Miranda Knickerbocker, then a senior at Barnard College, in 1958. She was the daughter of journalist Hubert Renfro Knickerbocker. They had two children before divorcing in 1973.

===Death===
On February 11, 1994, Sorrell Booke died of colorectal cancer in Sherman Oaks, California. He is interred at the Jewish cemetery Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<text>Abbé Pierre (born Henri Marie Joseph Grouès; 5 August 191222 January 2007) was a French Catholic priest. He was a member of the Resistance during World War II and deputy of the Popular Republican Movement. In 1949, he founded the Emmaus movement, with the goal of helping poor and homeless people. For years, he was one of the most popular figures in France. Allegations of sexual abuse of at least 57 women and children emerged in 2024 and 2025.

== Youth and education ==
Grouès was born on 5 August 1912 in Lyon, France to a wealthy Catholic family of silk traders, the fifth of eight children. The writer and murderer Héra Mirtel was one of his aunts. He spent his childhood in Irigny, near Lyon. He was twelve when he met François Chabbey and went for the first time with his father to an Order circle, the brotherhood of the &quot;Hospitaliers veilleurs&quot; in which the mainly middle-class members would serve the poor by providing barber services.

Grouès became a member of the &quot;Scouts de France&quot; in which he was nicknamed &quot;Meditative Beaver&quot; (&quot;Castor méditatif&quot;). In 1928, aged 16, he made the decision to join a monastic order, but he had to wait until he was seventeen and a half to fulfill this ambition. In 1931, Grouès entered the Capuchin Order, renouncing his inheritance and offering all his possessions to charity.

Known as &quot;frère Philippe&quot; (Brother Philippe), he entered the monastery of Crest in 1932, where he lived for seven years and was ordained a priest on 24 August 1938. He had to leave in 1939 after developing severe lung infections, which made monastic life difficult to cope with. He became chaplain to the sick at several places and then was nominated as curate of Grenoble&#x27;s cathedral in April 1939, only a few months before the invasion of Poland.

The theologian Henri de Lubac told him on the day of his priestly ordination: &quot;Ask the Holy Spirit to grant you the same anti-clericalism of the saints&quot;.

==World War II==
When World War II broke out in 1939, he was mobilised as a non-commissioned officer in the train transport corps. According to his official biography, he helped Jewish people to escape Nazi persecution following the July 1942 mass arrests in Paris, called the &quot;Rafle du Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv&quot;, and another raid in the area of Grenoble in the non-occupied zone: &quot;In July 1942, two fleeing Jews asked him for help. Having discovered the persecution taking place, he immediately went to learn how to make false passports. Starting in August 1942, he guided Jewish people to Switzerland&quot;.

His pseudonym dates from his work with the French Resistance during the Second World War, when he operated under several different names. Based in Grenoble, an important center of the Resistance, he helped Jews and politically persecuted escape to Switzerland. In 1942, he assisted Jacques de Gaulle (the brother of Charles de Gaulle) and his wife escape to Switzerland.

He participated in establishing a section of the &quot;maquis&quot; where he officially became one of the local leaders in the Vercors Plateau and in the Chartreuse Mountains. He helped people to avoid being taken into the &quot;Service du travail obligatoire&quot; (STO), the Nazi forced-labour program agreed upon with Pierre Laval, by creating in Grenoble the first refuge for resistants to the STO; he founded the clandestine newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Union patriotique indépendante&quot;. For a time, in 1943, he was given shelter by Lucie Coutaz, a Resistance member who later became his secretary and was his assistant in his charity work until her death in 1982.

He was arrested twice, once in 1944 by the Nazi police in the town of Cambo-les-Bains in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, but was quickly released and travelled to Spain then Gibraltar before joining the Free French Forces of General de Gaulle in Algeria. In the Free North Africa, he became a chaplain in the French Navy on the battleship &quot;Jean Bart&quot; in Casablanca. He had become an important symbol of the French Resistance.

At the end of the war, he was awarded the &quot;Croix de guerre 1939-1945&quot; with bronze palms and the &quot;Médaille de la Résistance&quot;.

==Political career (1945–51) and the 1960s–70s==
When the war was over, following de Gaulle&#x27;s entourage&#x27;s advice and the approbation of the archbishop of Paris, Abbé Pierre was elected deputy for Meurthe-et-Moselle department in both National Constituent Assemblies in 1945–1946 as an independent close to the Popular Republican Movement (MRP), mainly consisting of Christian democratic members of the Resistance. In 1946, he was re-elected as a member of the National Assembly, but this time as a member of the MRP. Abbé Pierre became vice-president of the World Federalist Movement in 1947, a universal federalist movement.

After a bloody accident resulting in the death of a blue-collar worker, Édouard Mazé, in Brest in 1950, Henri Antoine Grouès decided to put an end to his MRP affiliation on 28 April 1950, writing a letter titled &quot;Pourquoi je quitte le MRP&quot; (&quot;Why I&#x27;m leaving the MRP&quot;), where he denounced the political and social attitude of the MRP party. He then joined the Christian socialist movement named &quot;Ligue de la jeune République&quot;, created in 1912 by Marc Sangnier, but decided to finally end his political career. In 1951, before the end of his mandate, he returned to his first vocation: helping the homeless. With the modest funds he had received as a deputy, he invested in a run-down house near Paris in the Neuilly-Plaisance neighbourhood, repairing the whole house. He made it the first Emmaus base (because, according to him, it was simply too big for one person).

Although the priest had left representative politics, preferring to invest his energies in the Emmaus charity movement, he never completely abandoned the political field, taking strong stances on many and various subjects. Thus, when the decolonization movement was slowly beginning to emerge in the whole world, he attempted in 1956 to convince Tunisian leader Habib Bourguiba to obtain independence without using violence. Present in various international conferences at the end of the 1950s, he met Colombian priest Camilo Torres (1929–1966), a predecessor of Liberation theology, who asked for his advice on the Colombian Church&#x27;s criticism of &quot;workers&#x27; priests&quot;. He was also received by US president Eisenhower and Mohammed V of Morocco in 1955 and 1956. In 1962, he resided for several months in Charles de Foucauld&#x27;s retreat in Béni-Abbés (Algeria). 

Abbé Pierre was then called to India in 1971 by Jayaprakash Narayan to represent, along with the &quot;Ligue des droits de l&#x27;homme&quot; (Human Rights League) France in the issues of refugees. Indira Gandhi then invited him to deal with the question of Bengali refugees, and Grouès founded Emmaus communities in Bangladesh. 

==Emmaus==

=== 1949: the origin ===
Emmaus (&quot;Emmaüs&quot; in French) was started in 1949. Its name is a reference to a village in Palestine appearing in the Gospel of Luke, where two disciples extended hospitality to Jesus just after his resurrection without recognizing him. In that way, Emmaus&#x27;s mission is to help poor and homeless people. It is a secular organization. In 1950 the first community of Emmaus companions was created in Neuilly-Plaisance close to Paris in France. The Emmaus community raises funds for the construction of housing by selling used goods. &quot;Emmaus, it&#x27;s a little like the wheelbarrow, the shovels and the pickaxes coming before the banners. A sort of social fuel derived from salvaging defeating men&quot;.

There were initial difficulties raising funds, so in 1952, Abbé Pierre decided to be a contestant on the Radio Luxembourg game show &quot;Quitte ou double&quot; (&quot;Double or Nothing&quot;) for the prize money; he ended up winning 256,000 francs.

===Winter 1954: &quot;Uprising of kindness&quot;===
Grouès became famous during the extremely cold winter of 1954 in France, when homeless people were dying in the streets. Following the failure of the projected law on lodgings, he gave a well-remembered speech on Radio Luxembourg on 1 February 1954, and asked &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, a conservative newspaper, to publish his call, in which he stated soberly that &quot;a woman froze to death tonight at 3:00 AM, on the pavement of Sebastopol Boulevard, clutching the eviction notice which the day before had made her homeless&quot;. He went on to describe the drama of homeless life, claiming that in &quot;every town in France, in every quarter of Paris&quot; ministry was needed based on &quot;these simple words: &#x27;If you suffer, whoever you are, enter, eat, sleep, recover hope, here you are loved&#x27;&quot;.

The next morning, the press wrote of an &quot;uprising of kindness&quot; (&quot;insurrection de la bonté&quot;) and the now-famous call for help ended up raising 500 million francs in donations (Charlie Chaplin gave 2 million). This enormous amount was totally unexpected; telephone operators and the postal service were overwhelmed, and owing to the volume of donations, several weeks were needed just to sort them, distribute them, and find a place to stock them throughout the country. Moreover, this call attracted volunteers from all over the country to help them, including wealthy &quot;bourgeoises&quot; who were emotionally shaken by the Abbé&#x27;s call: first to do the redistribution, but then to duplicate the effort all around France. Quite quickly, Grouès had to organise his movement by creating the &quot;Emmaus communities&quot; on 23 March 1954. 
A book was written by Boris Simon called &quot;Abbé Pierre and the ragpickers of Emmaus&quot;. It spread knowledge about the Emmaus community. In 1955, the priest gave President Eisenhower an English translation of the book in the oval office. The Emmaus communities quickly spread worldwide. Grouès traveled to Beyrouth (Beirut, Lebanon) in 1959, to assist in the creation of the first multiconfessional Emmaus group there; it was founded by a Sunni (Muslim), a Melkite (Catholic) archbishop and a Maronite (Christian) writer. 

==1980s to 2000s==
After the 1981 election of President François Mitterrand (Socialist Party, PS), during which Abbé Pierre called for voters to vote in blank), he supported the initiative of the French Premier Laurent Fabius (PS) to create in 1984 the &quot;Revenu minimum d&#x27;insertion&quot; (RMI), a welfare system for indigent people.
The same year, he organized the operation &quot;Charity Christmas&quot;, which, relayed by &quot;France Soir&quot;, raised 6 million francs and 200 tons of products. The actor Coluche, who had organized the charitable &quot;Restos du Cœur&quot;, offered him 150 million French cents received by his organisation. Coluche&#x27;s huge success with the Restos du Cœur, caused by his popularity (Coluche had even tried to nominate himself as a candidate in the 1981 presidential election before withdrawing), convinced the Abbé again of the necessity and value of such charitable struggles and the usefulness of the media in such endeavours. 

In 1983, he spoke with Italian President Sandro Pertini to plead the cause of Vanni Mulinaris, imprisoned on charge of assistance to the Red Brigades (BR), and even observed eight days of hunger strike from 26 May to 3 June 1984 in the Cathedral of Turin to protest against detention conditions of &quot;Brigadists&quot; in Italian prisons and the imprisonment without trial of Vanni Mulinaris, who was recognized innocent sometimes afterwards. Italian magistrate Carlo Mastelloni recalled in the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; in 2007 that a niece of the Abbé was a secretary at Hyperion language school in Paris, directed by Vanni Mulinaris, and married to one of the Italians refugees then wanted by the Italian justice. According to the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, it would even have been him who convinced then president François Mitterrand to grant protection from extradition to left-wing Italian activists who took refuge in France and had broken with their past.

More than 20 years later, the ANSA, Italian press agency, recalled that he had supported in 2005 one of his physicians, Michele d&#x27;Auria, who was a former member of &quot;Prima Linea&quot;, an Italian far-left group, and was accused of having participated in hold-ups during 1990. Like many other Italian activists, he had exiled himself to France during the &quot;years of lead&quot;, and then joined the Emmaus companions. &quot;La Repubblica&quot; specified that Italian justice has recognized the innocence of all people close to the Hyperion School.

Following Grouès&#x27; death in January 2007, Italian magistrate Carlo Mastelloni declared to the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; that during the abduction of Aldo Moro Abbé Pierre had gone to the Christian Democrats&#x27; headquarters in Rome in an attempt to speak with its secretary Benigno Zaccagnini, in favor of a &quot;hard line&quot; of refusal of negotiations along with the BR.

In 1988, Abbé Pierre met representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to discuss the difficult financial, monetary and human issues brought by the huge Third World debt (starting in 1982, Mexico had announced it could not pay the service of its debt, triggering the 1980s Latin American debt crisis). In the 1990s, the Abbé criticized the apartheid regime in South Africa. In 1995, after a three-year-long siege of Sarajevo, he went there to exhort nations of the world to put an end to the violence, and requested French military operation against the Serb positions in Bosnia.

During the Gulf War (1990–91), Abbé Pierre directly addressed himself to US President George H. W. Bush and Iraq President Saddam Hussein. He asked French president François Mitterrand to engage himself in matters concerning refugees, in particular by the creation of a stronger organisation than the current UN High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR). He encountered this year the Dalai Lama during inter-religious peace encounters. A staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, he has attracted attention with some of his statements on the Israeli-Palestine conflict.

His support &quot;à titre amical&quot; (&quot;in title of friendship&quot;) for Roger Garaudy in 1996 brought controversy. The &quot;Garaudy Affair&quot; had been revealed in January 1996 by the &quot;Canard enchaîné&quot; satirical newspaper, which prompted a series of denunciations against his book, &quot;The Foundational Myths of Israeli Politics&quot;, and led Garaudy to be charged of negationism (before being convicted in 1998, under the 1990 Gayssot Act). But Garaudy provoked public indignation when he announced in March that he was supported by the Abbé Pierre, who was immediately excluded from the honour committee of the LICRA (International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism). The Abbé condemned those who tried to &quot;negate, banalize or falsify the Shoah&quot;, but his continued support to Garaudy as a friend was criticized by all anti-racist, Jewish organisations (MRAP, CRIF, Anti-Defamation League, etc.) and the Church hierarchy. His friend Bernard Kouchner, co-founder of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), criticized him for &quot;absolving the intolerable,&quot; while Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger (and archbishop of Paris from 1981 to 2005) publicly disavowed him. The Abbé then went into retreat in the Benedictine monastery of Praglia near Padua, Italy. In the film documentary &quot;Un abbé nommé Pierre, une vie au service des autres&quot;, the Abbé declared that his support had been towards the person of Roger Garaudy, and not towards statements in his book, which he had not read.

The curator of the Deportation and Resistance Museum of the Isère department where Grouès carried out most of his resistance activities declared that Abbé Pierre would have merited ten times to be named Righteous Among the Nations for his struggle in favor of Jews during Vichy.

Following this 1996 controversial support to a personal acquaintance, the Abbé was shunned for a period by the media, although Grouès remained a popular figure.

==Positions on the Church hierarchy and the Vatican&#x27;s policies==
The Abbé&#x27;s positions towards the Church and the Vatican also brought controversy. His positions on social issues and engagements were at times explicitly socialist and opposed to the Church. He maintained a relationship with the progressive French Catholic Bishop Jacques Gaillot, to which he recalled his duty of &quot;instinct of a measured insolence&quot;. He did not like Mother Teresa; despite her work for the poor, her strict adherence to Catholic teaching on morality did not sit well with Abbé Pierre&#x27;s left wing ideology. He had difficult relations with the Vatican. &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, not known for reporting the deaths of priests, did not report on his death right away in 2007. Even though it is not customary for the Pope to offer condolences on the death of individual priests, Abbé Pierre&#x27;s supporters were heavily critical of Pope Benedict XVI for not making an exception. Father Lombardi, spokesman of the Vatican, pointed journalists to the statement made by the French Church, while Benedict XVI did mention his death in private audiences. Official reactions from the Church came in two interviews of French cardinals, Roger Etchegaray and Paul Poupard. His criticisms of what he considered the lavish lifestyle of the Vatican got him a lot of publicity (especially when he reproached John Paul II for his expensive travels), but were not well received by the public. Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone lauded his &quot;action in favor of poor&quot;: &quot;Informed of the death of Abbe Pierre, the Holy Father gives thanks for his activity in favor of the poorest, by which he bore witness to the charity that comes from Christ. Entrusting to divine mercy this priest whose whole life was dedicated to fighting poverty, he asks the Lord to welcome him into the peace of His kingdom. By way of comfort and hope, His Holiness sends you a heartfelt apostolic blessing, which he extends to the family of the departed, to members of the communities of Emmaus, and to everyone gathering for the funeral&quot;.

His support for the ordination of women and for married clergy put him at odds with Catholic tradition, Church leaders and a substantial portion of French Catholics that followed the traditional teaching of the Church. The same stances, according to British state media, made him popular among the declining number of left-wing Catholics in France. In his book &quot;Mon Dieu… pourquoi?&quot; (God… Why?, 2005), co-written with Frédéric Lenoir, he admitted to breaking his solemn promise of celibacy by having had casual sex with women. Despite very strong grassroots opposition to adoption by same-sex couples, Abbé Pierre dismissed people&#x27;s concerns that it deprives children of a mother or father and turns them into objects. The Abbé also opposed the traditional Catholic policy on contraceptives.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

===International recognition===
Abbé Pierre had the distinction of having been voted France&#x27;s most popular person for many years, though he was surpassed in 2003 by Zinedine Zidane, moving to second place. In 2005, Abbé Pierre came third in a television poll to choose &quot;Le Plus Grand Français&quot; (The Greatest Frenchman).

In 1998, he has been made Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec while in 2004, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor by Jacques Chirac. He also received the Balzan Prize for Humanity, Peace and Brotherhood among Peoples in 1991 &quot;For having fought, throughout his life, for the defence of human rights, democracy and peace. For having entirely dedicated himself to helping to relieve spiritual and physical suffering. For having inspired – regardless of nationality, race or religion – universal solidarity with the Emmaus Communities&quot;.

===Accidents and health problems===
He was often sick, particularly in the lungs when he was young. He was left unscathed in several dangerous situations:
* In 1950, while on a flight in India, his plane had to make an emergency landing due to engine failure.
* In 1963, his ship was shipwrecked in the Río de la Plata, between Argentina and Uruguay. He survived by clinging to a wooden part of the ship, while around him 80 passengers died. On a later trip to Algiers he showed the pocket knife which had enabled him to survive this ordeal.

==Sexual abuse==

In July 2024, the Fondation Abbé Pierre and Emmaus issued a statement about the results of an investigation they had commissioned after reports of abuse by Pierre had come to light. An independent research group reported that seven women (one of them a minor at the time of abuse) gave testimony about abuse they suffered at the hands of the French priest between the late 1970s and 2005.

In September 2024, a report commissioned by the Fondation reported that Abbé Pierre sexually harassed or assaulted at least two dozen women. An 8-9 year child was also allegedly abused. The abuse happened in France and in the United States. The second report led the Abbé Pierre Foundation being retitled, and Emmaus France voting on removing the priest&#x27;s name from its logo. The Abbé Pierre Centre in Esteville in Normandy, where he lived for many years and is buried, was to close, and the disposal of hundreds of statuettes, busts and other images of the charity&#x27;s creator was discussed. There was evidence that colleagues in Emmaus and the Catholic Church knew about Abbé Pierre&#x27;s sexual behaviour, but did not speak out.

On January 14, 2024, the Bishops&#x27; Conference of France took legal action after the nine new accusations of sexual violence, in order to request the opening of an investigation.

== Death ==
Abbé Pierre remained active until his death on 22 January 2007 in the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris, following a lung infection, aged 94. He took a stance on most social struggles: supporting illegal aliens, assisting the homeless on the &quot;Enfants de Don Quichotte&quot; movement (end of 2006-start of 2007) and social movements in favor of requisitioning empty buildings and offices (squats), etc. He continued to read &quot;La Croix&quot;, the Catholic social newspaper every day. In January 2007, he went to the National Assembly to lobby for a law on lodging homeless people. Following his death, the Minister of Social Cohesion Jean-Louis Borloo (UMP) decided to give Abbé Pierre&#x27;s name to the law, despite the latter&#x27;s scepticism of the law&#x27;s real value. In 2005 he opposed conservative deputies who wanted to reform the Gayssot Act on housing projects (&quot;loi SRU&quot;), which would have imposed a 20% housing project limit in each town.

After homage by dignitaries, several hundred ordinary Parisians (among them professor Albert Jacquard, who worked with the abbé for the cause of homelessness) went to the Val-de-Grâce chapel to pay their respects. His funeral on 26 January 2007 at the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris was attended by numerous dignitaries: President Jacques Chirac, former President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, many French Ministers, and the Companions of Emmaus, who were seated in the cathedral&#x27;s first rows according to Abbé Pierre&#x27;s last wishes. He was buried in a cemetery in Esteville, a small village in Seine-Maritime where he once lived.

<text>Pattern grading is the process of turning base size or sample size patterns into additional sizes using a size specification sheet or grading increments. This can be done manually or digitally using computerized pattern drafting software.

== Use ==
Standard grading rules are based upon ergonomic measurements of the body, mathematically extrapolated or interpolated according to one of numerous pattern making systems. This is often chosen with an eye to the target market for a manufactured garment, in which one system or another prevails, according to consumer taste. Typically, the first pattern is developed in one size and is then graded up or down according to the chosen system, ensuring an optimum fit in all sizes.

Grading is a necessary step that must be taken before outsourcing sewing, because sewists will require sets of specific patterns for cutting and sewing. (These are typically copied on to a durable medium such as oak tag paper or vinyl, and are referred to as &quot;card sets&quot; in the trade.) Grading will not create shape, but will only increase or decrease size of original shape.

== History ==
Historically, the science of grading developed with the advent of the tape measure, the introduction of scientific tailoring systems, commercial patterns and the mass-production of pattern-built clothing in the 19th century. To properly fit a pattern to a range of sizes, each piece needed to be graded, meaning systematically increased or decreased. A German mathematician Dr. Henry Wampen wrote two influential works, &quot;The Mathematical Art of Cutting Garments According to the Different Formation of Men&#x27;s Bodies&quot; (1834) and &quot;Mathematical Instructions in Constructing Models for Draping the Human Figure&quot; (1863). Wampen introduced the principle of gradation via these works. &quot;The Mathematical Art&quot; was translated into English by J. Happle-Hutcheson as &quot;Dr. Wampen&#x27;s World Renowned System of Anthropometry as Simplified and Americanized&quot; in 1842, and remained in print into the 20th century 

Prior to this, sewing patterns were made to fit a specific individual, and were originally made on cloth, and only later on paper. A tailor or dressmaker recorded a customer&#x27;s measurements on a thin strip of parchment and kept it with the pattern pieces, noting any changes in measurements and adjusting the pattern pieces accordingly. This required a good eye and many years&#x27; experience. Frequently an apprentice tailor&#x27;s indenture specified that the apprentice would inherit the master&#x27;s patterns upon the latter&#x27;s demise, while enjoining complete confidentiality upon the former; patterns could also be passed down via family inheritance. Early tailoring books, beginning in the sixteenth century gave advice on the quantity of material needed for certain garments, and gave simple diagrams of clothes. The reader could draft patterns by using these illustrations as a guide. One of the earliest illustrated guides is by Juan de Alcega, published in Madrid in 1589.

By the beginning of the 19th century, shops in London were selling patterns: a full set of men&#x27;s clothes patterns was five pounds, men&#x27;s frock coat or lapelled coat five shillings six pence, and breeches or pantaloons three shillings.

It was not until the 1850s that sewing patterns were made available to a slightly larger, but still affluent, public. American women could obtain a paper pattern custom made by a dressmaker or could purchase a pattern through a women&#x27;s journal.

The advent of large-scale production of graded, practical and easier to use sewing patterns came in 1863. Ebenezer Butterick mass-produced patterns printed on tissue paper. Patterns were available for purchase in a variety of sizes, one size per package. In 1867, the Butterick firm began marketing its patterns via its own line of monthly and quarterly magazines.

It was not until the 1970s, when sales were lagging, that multi-size graded patterns became available.
== Methods of grading ==
There are three basic methods of pattern grading. There is not a superior method; they are all equally capable of producing a correct garment grade. These include:

*Cut and spread: This is the easiest method, which acts as the basis of the other two methods. To perform this method, the pattern is first cut, and the pieces are spread by a certain amount to grade up, or overlapped to grade down. The only tools necessary for this method are a pencil, tape, ruler, and scissors.
*Pattern shifting: Pattern shifting involves increasing the overall dimensions of a pattern by moving it around at a constant distance. After the pattern is moved, the outline is redrawn in order to produce the same results as cut-and-spread.
*Computer grading: Computer grading is the most recent development in grading technology. It is also the fastest method. It takes the processes of the two former methods and digitizes them, scaling patterns up precisely and mathematically.

<text>Christa Ludwig (16 March 1928 – 24 April 2021) was a German mezzo-soprano and sometime dramatic soprano, distinguished for her performances of opera, lieder, oratorio, and other major religious works like masses, passions, and solos in symphonic literature. Her performing career spanned almost half a century, from the late 1940s until the early 1990s.

She sang at many international opera houses and festivals, including at the Vienna State Opera from 1955 to 1994, and at the Metropolitan Opera in many roles. She is remembered for roles such as Mozart&#x27;s Dorabella, Beethoven&#x27;s Leonore in &quot;Fidelio&quot;, Wagner&#x27;s Kundry, and both Octavian and the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; by Richard Strauss. In Vienna, she created the title role of Gottfried von Einem&#x27;s &quot;Der Besuch der alten Dame&quot; in 1971.

She is widely recognised as having been one of the most significant and distinguished singers of the 20th century. &quot;The NPR Listener&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Classical Music&quot; (2006) stated &quot;Ludwig possessed a voice of exquisite richness and, when needed, breathtaking amplitude. She had the ability to impart dramatic urgency to a performance, the hallmark of a great singer.&quot;

== Early life and education==
Ludwig was born in Berlin to a musical family. Her father, Anton Ludwig, who began his singing career as a baritone and later moved into the tenor repertory, was also an opera administrator, and her mother, Eugenie Besalla-Ludwig, was a mezzo-soprano who sang at the Aachen Opera during Herbert von Karajan&#x27;s period as conductor. Ludwig grew up in Aachen, where her first voice teacher was her mother. At age eight, she sang an aria of the Queen of the Night in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;.

At Aachen Conservatory, she studied piano, cello, flute and music theory. The family moved to Hanau when their home was bombed in 1944. She studied voice at the Musikhochschule Frankfurt.

== Career ==
Ludwig made her stage debut in 1946 at the age of 18 as Orlovsky in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; by Johann Strauss at the Oper Frankfurt, where she sang until 1952. She was a member of the Staatstheater Darmstadt from 1952 to 1954, then sang for the 1954/55 season at the Staatsoper Hannover. She joined the Vienna State Opera in 1955, where she became one of its principal artists and was awarded the title &quot;Kammersängerin&quot; in 1962. She performed with the company for more than thirty years in 43 opera roles and 769 performances. In 1954, she made her debut at the Salzburg Festival as Cherubino in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, conducted by Karl Böhm, and appeared there regularly until 1981. At the Vienna State Opera, she created the title role of Gottfried von Einem&#x27;s &quot;Der Besuch der alten Dame&quot; on 23 May 1971, conducted by Horst Stein and alongside Eberhard Waechter as her lover Alfred Ill. The performance was recorded by Deutsche Grammophon, and reissued on CD by Amadeo and later Orfeo.

She first performed in the U.S. at the Lyric Opera of Chicago as Dorabella in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; in 1959. The same year, she appeared at the Metropolitan Opera (Met) in New York City as Cherubino in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, conducted by Erich Leinsdorf. Louis Biancolli wrote in his review for the World Telegram and Sun: She subsequently sang 121 performances in 15 roles with the Met, where she quickly became one of the audience&#x27;s favourites. Her next role, again in trousers, was Octavian in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; by Strauss, in a live broadcast conducted by Leinsdorf, with Lisa Della Casa as the Marschallin, Elisabeth Söderström as Sophie, and Oskar Czerwenka in his Met debut as Ochs. Her repertoire there also included The Dyer&#x27;s Wife in the Met&#x27;s first performances of &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot; by Richard Strauss, then (in 1969) the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, Klytemnestra in &quot;Elektra&quot;, Ortrud in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, Brangäne in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, Fricka in both &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, Waltraute in &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, Kundry in &quot;Parsifal&quot;, the title role in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, Didon in &quot;Les Troyens&quot; by Berlioz, Charlotte in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;, and Amneris in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;. In 1960, she performed as Adalgisa alongside Maria Callas as Bellini&#x27;s Norma for an EMI recording. She appeared at the Bayreuth Festival first as Brangäne in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; in 1966. She first appeared at the Royal Opera House in London in 1968 as Amneris in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;.

As Ludwig&#x27;s voice matured, she expanded her repertoire from lyric and &quot;spinto&quot; mezzo-roles to dramatic roles. Her vast repertory eventually grew to encompass Princess Eboli in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo&quot; which she sang at La Scala in Milan, in Salzburg and in Vienna, the title role in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, Ulrica in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, Octavia in Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;, and contemporary roles by von Einem and Orff. She also ventured briefly into the spinto and dramatic soprano repertoire with performances as Lady Macbeth in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the Dyer&#x27;s Wife, the Marschallin and Leonore in &quot;Fidelio&quot;.

In addition to her opera performances, Ludwig regularly gave recitals of lieder, with pianists including Sebastian Peschko, Gerald Moore, Geoffrey Parsons and on occasion Leonard Bernstein. She performed as a soloist with orchestras, including works by Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Wolf, Mahler and Strauss. She was one of few women to tackle and record Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot;. She also sang Bach&#x27;s music and recorded many of his large vocal works, such as the St Matthew Passion conducted by Otto Klemperer in 1961, with Peter Pears as the Evangelist and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau as the voice of Christ, and the Mass in B minor the same year, Karajan&#x27;s third recording of the work, with Leontyne Price, Nicolai Gedda, Gérard Souzay and her husband Walter Berry. She recorded Bach&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; conducted by Karl Richter in 1965, with Gundula Janowitz, Fritz Wunderlich and Franz Crass. She performed Mahler&#x27;s Second Symphony with Bernstein in 1967. In the same year, she recorded a definitive &quot;Das Lied von de Erde&quot; with tenor Fritz Wunderlich, conducted by Otto Klemperer. From September 1973 to January 1974, she took part in Karajan&#x27;s fourth recording of Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor, with Janowitz, Peter Schreier, Robert Kerns and Karl Ridderbusch.

In 1993 and 1994, she gave a series of farewell recitals in many cities; her last appearance at the Metropolitan Opera was as Fricka in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. Her final live operatic performance was as Klytemnestra in &quot;Elektra&quot; for the Vienna State Opera in December 1994.

==Personal life==
From 1957 to 1970, Ludwig was married to the bass-baritone Walter Berry; they had a son. The couple performed together frequently, notably as the Dyer and his wife in &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;. In 1972, she married the French theatre actor Paul-Emile Deiber, who died in 2011.

Ludwig&#x27;s first memoir, &quot;Und ich wäre so gern Primadonna gewesen&quot; (And I would gladly have been a primadonna), was published in 1994; an English translation by Regina Domeraski titled &quot;In My Own Voice&quot; was published in 1999. Her second memoir, &quot;&quot;Leicht muss man sein&quot;: Erinnerungen an die Zukunft&quot; (&quot;One must be lighter&quot;: memories of the future), as told to Erna Cuesta and Franz Zoglauer, was published in 2018.

Ludwig died at her home in Klosterneuburg, Austria in April 2021, at the age of 93.

<text>Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, vehicles, or environments so as to be usable by people with disabilities. The concept of accessible design and practice of accessible developments ensures both &quot;direct access&quot; (i.e. unassisted) and &quot;indirect access&quot; meaning compatibility with a person&#x27;s assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers).

Accessibility can be viewed as the &quot;ability to access&quot; and benefit from some system or entity. The concept focuses on enabling access for people with disabilities, or enabling access through the use of assistive technology; however, research and development in accessibility brings benefits to everyone. Therefore, an accessible society should eliminate digital divide or knowledge divide.

Accessibility is not to be confused with usability, which is the extent to which a product (such as a device, service, or environment) can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.

Accessibility is also strongly related to universal design, the process of creating products that are usable by the widest possible range of people, operating within the widest possible range of situations. Universal design typically provides a single general solution that can accommodate people with disabilities as well as the rest of the population. By contrast, accessible design is focused on ensuring that there are no barriers to accessibility for all people, including those with disabilities.

==Legislation==
The disability rights movement advocates equal access to social, political, and economic life which includes not only physical access but access to the same tools, services, organizations and facilities as non-disabled people (e.g., museums). Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities commits signatories to provide for full accessibility in their countries.

While it is often used to describe facilities or amenities to assist people with impaired mobility, through the provision of facilities like wheelchair ramps, the term can include other types of disability. Accessible facilities therefore extend to areas such as Braille signage, elevators, audio signals at pedestrian crossings, walkway contours, website accessibility and accessible publishing.

In the United States, government mandates including Section 508, WCAG, DDA are all enforcing practices to standardize accessibility testing engineering in product development.

Accessibility modifications may be required to enable persons with disabilities to gain access to education, employment, transportation, housing, recreation, or even simply to exercise their right to vote.

===National legislation===
Various countries have legislation requiring physical accessibility which are (in order of enactment):
* In the US, under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, new public and private business construction generally must be accessible. Existing private businesses are required to increase the accessibility of their facilities when making any other renovations in proportion to the cost of the other renovations. The United States Access Board is &quot;A Federal Agency Committed to Accessible Design for People with Disabilities&quot;. The Job Accommodation Network discusses accommodations for people with disabilities in the workplace. Many states in the US have their own disability laws.
* In Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 has numerous provisions for accessibility.
* In South Africa the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 2000 has numerous provisions for accessibility.
* In the UK, the Equality Act 2010 has numerous provisions for accessibility.
* In Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court, on 27 April 2011 gave a landmark order to boost the inherent right of disabled persons to have unhindered access to public buildings and facilities.
* In Norway, the Discrimination and Accessibility Act () defines lack of accessibility as discrimination and obliges public authorities to implement universal design in their areas. The Act refers to issue-specific legislation regarding accessibility in e.g. ICT, the built environment, transport and education.
* In Brazil, the law on the inclusion of people with disabilities has numerous provisions for accessibility.
* In Canada, relevant federal legislation includes the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Employment Equity Act, the Canadian Labour Code, and the Accessible Canada Act (Bill-C81) which made Royal Assent on June 21, 2019.

Legislation may also be enacted on a state, provincial or local level. In Ontario, Canada, the Ontarians with Disabilities Act of 2001 is meant to &quot;improve the identification, removal and prevention of barriers faced by persons with disabilities&quot;.

The European Union (EU), which has signed the United Nations&#x27; Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, also has adopted a European Disability Strategy for 2010–20. The Strategy includes the following goals, among others:
* Devising policies for inclusive, high-quality education;
* Ensuring the European Platform Against Poverty includes a special focus on people with disabilities (the forum brings together experts who share best practices and experience);
* Working towards the recognition of disability cards throughout the EU to ensure equal treatment when working, living or travelling in the bloc
* Establishing accessibility standards for voting locations and campaign materials.
* Taking the rights of people with disabilities into account in external development programmes and for EU candidate countries.

A &quot;European Accessibility Act&quot; was proposed in late 2012. This Act would establish standards within member countries for accessible products, services, and public buildings. The harmonization of accessibility standards within the EU &quot;would facilitate the social integration of persons with disabilities and the elderly and their mobility across member states, thereby also fostering the free movement principle&quot;.

Enforcement of the European Accessibility Act (EAA) begins in June 2025

==Assistive technology and adaptive technology==
Assistive technology is the creation of a new device that assists a person in completing a task that would otherwise be impossible. Some examples include new computer software programs like screen readers, and inventions such as assistive listening devices, including hearing aids, and traffic lights with a standard color code that enables colorblind individuals to understand the correct signal.

Adaptive technology is the modification, or adaptation, of existing devices, methods, or the creation of new uses for existing devices, to enable a person to complete a task. Examples include the use of remote controls, and the autocomplete (word completion) feature in computer word processing programs, which both help individuals with mobility impairments to complete tasks. Adaptations to wheelchair tires are another example; widening the tires enables wheelchair users to move over soft surfaces, such as deep snow on ski hills, and sandy beaches.

Assistive technology and adaptive technology have a key role in developing the means for people with disabilities to live more independently, and to more fully participate in mainstream society. In order to have access to assistive or adaptive technology, however, educating the public and even legislating requirements to incorporate this technology have been necessary.

The UN CRPD, and courts in the United States, Japan, UK, and elsewhere, have decided that when it is needed to assure secret ballot, authorities should provide voters with assistive technology.

The European Court of Human Rights, on the contrary, in case Toplak v. Slovenia ruled that due to high costs, the abandonment of the assistive equipment in elections did not violate human rights.

==Employment==
Accessibility of employment covers a wide range of issues, from skills training, to occupational therapy, finding employment, and retaining employment.

Employment rates for workers with disabilities are lower than for the general workforce. Workers in Western countries fare relatively well, having access to more services and training as well as legal protections against employment discrimination. Despite this, in the United States the 2012 unemployment rate for workers with disabilities was 12.9%, while it was 7.3% for workers without disabilities. More than half of workers with disabilities (52%) earned less than $25,000 in the previous year, compared with just 38% of workers with no disabilities. This translates into an earnings gap where individuals with disabilities earn about 25 percent less of what workers without disabilities earn. Among occupations with 100,000 or more people, dishwashers had the highest disability rate (14.3%), followed by refuse and recyclable material collectors (12.7%), personal care aides (11.9%), and janitors and building cleaners (11.8%). The rates for refuse and recyclable material collectors, personal care aides, and janitors and building cleaners were not statistically different from one another.

Surveys of non-Western countries are limited, but the available statistics also indicate fewer jobs being filled by workers with disabilities. In India, a large 1999 survey found that &quot;of the &#x27;top 100 multinational companies&#x27; in the country [...] the employment rate of persons with disabilities in the private sector was a mere 0.28%, 0.05% in multinational companies and only 0.58% in the top 100 IT companies in the country&quot;. India, like much of the world, has large sections of the economy that are without strong regulation or social protections, such as the informal economy. Other factors have been cited as contributing to the high unemployment rate, such as public service regulations. Although employment for workers with disabilities is higher in the public sector due to hiring programs targeting persons with disabilities, regulations currently restrict types of work available to persons with disabilities:
&quot;Disability-specific employment reservations are limited to the public sector and a large number of the reserved positions continue to be vacant despite nearly two decades of enactment of the PWD Act&quot;.

Expenses related to adaptive or assistive technology required to participate in the workforce may be tax deductible expenses for individuals with a medical practitioner&#x27;s prescription in some jurisdictions.

===Disability management===
Disability management (DM) is a specialized area of human resources that supports efforts of employers to better integrate and retain workers with disabilities. Some workplaces have policies in place to provide &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; for employees with disabilities, but many do not. In some jurisdictions, employers may have legal requirements to end discrimination against persons with disabilities.

It has been noted by researchers that where accommodations are in place for employees with disabilities, these frequently apply to individuals with &quot;pre-determined or apparent disabilities as determined by national social protection or Equality Authorities&quot;, which include persons with pre-existing conditions who receive an official disability designation. One of the biggest challenges for employers is in developing policies and practises to manage employees who develop disabilities during the course of employment. Even where these exist, they tend to focus on workplace injuries, overlooking job retention challenges faced by employees who acquire a non-occupation injury or illness. Protecting employability is a factor that can help close the unemployment gap for persons with disabilities.

==Transportation==
Providing mobility to people with disabilities includes changes for public facilities like gently sloping paths of travel for people using wheelchairs and difficulty walking up stairs, or audio announcements for the blind (either live or automated); dedicated services like paratransit; and adaptations to personal vehicles.

===Adapted automobiles for persons with disabilities===

Automobile accessibility also refers to ease of use by disabled people. Automobiles, whether a car or a van, can be adapted for a range of physical disabilities. Foot pedals can be raised, or replaced with hand-controlled devices. Wheelchair hoists, lifts or ramps may be customized according to the needs of the driver. Ergonomic adaptations, such as a lumbar support cushion, may also be needed.

Generally, the more limiting the disability, the more expensive the adaptation needed for the vehicle. Financial assistance is available through some organizations, such as Motability in the United Kingdom, which requires a contribution by the prospective vehicle owner. Motability makes vehicles available for purchase or lease.

When an employee with a disability requires an adapted car for work use, the employee does not have to pay for a &quot;reasonable adjustment&quot; in the United Kingdom; if the employer is unable to pay the cost, assistance is offered by government programs.

===Low floor===

A significant development in transportation, and public transport in particular, to achieve accessibility, is the move to &quot;low-floor&quot; vehicles. In a low-floor vehicle, access to part or all of the passenger cabin is unobstructed from one or more entrances by the presence of steps, enabling easier access for the infirm or people with push chairs. A further aspect may be that the entrance and corridors are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Low-floor vehicles have been developed for buses, trolleybuses, trams and trains.

A low floor in the vehicular sense is normally combined in a conceptual meaning with normal pedestrian access from a standard kerb (curb) height. However, the accessibility of a low-floor vehicle can also be utilised from slightly raising portions of kerb at bus stops, or through use of level boarding bus rapid transit stations or tram stops. The combination of access from a kerb was the technological development of the 1990s, as step-free interior layouts for buses had existed in some cases for decades, with entrance steps being introduced as chassis designs and overall height regulations changed.

Low-floor buses may also be designed with special height adjustment controls that permit a stationary bus to temporarily lower itself to ground level, permitting wheelchair access. This is referred to as a kneeling bus.

At rapid transit systems, vehicles generally have floors in the same height as the platforms but the stations are often underground or elevated, so accessibility there is not a question of providing low-floor vehicles, but providing a step-free access from street level to the platforms (generally by elevators, which may be restricted to disabled passengers only, so that the step-free access is not obstructed by non-disabled people taking advantage).

===Accessibility planning for transportation in the United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, local transport authorities are responsible for checking that all people who live within their area can access essential opportunities and services, and where gaps in provision are identified the local authorities are responsible for organizing changes to make new connections. These requirements are defined in the UK Community Planning Acts legislation and more detailed guidance has been issued by the Department for Transport for each local authority. This includes the requirement to produce an Accessibility Plan under Community Planning legislation and to incorporate this within their Local Transport Plan. An Accessibility Plan sets out how each local authority plans to improve access to employment, learning, health care, food shops and other services of local importance, particularly for disadvantaged groups and areas. Accessibility targets are defined in the accessibility plans, these are often the distance or time to access services by different modes of transport including walking, cycling and public transport.

Accessibility Planning was introduced as a result of the report &quot;Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion&quot;. This report was the result of research carried out by the Social Exclusion Unit. The United Kingdom also has a &quot;code of practice&quot; for making train and stations accessible: &quot;Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice&quot;. This code of practice was first published in 2002 with the objective of compliance to Section 71B of the Railways Act 1993, and revised after a public consultation period in 2008.

Some transport companies have since improved the accessibility of their services, such as incorporating low-floor buses into their stock as standard. In August 2021, South Western Railway announced the streamlining of their accessibility services, allowing passengers requiring assistance to inform the company with as little as 10 minutes&#x27; notice at all 189 stations on its network, replacing an older scheme wherein assisted journeys had to be booked six hours to a day in advance. The system will utilise clear signage at stations and QR codes, allowing customers to send details of the assistance they require and their planned journey to staff remotely.

Making public services fully accessible to the public has led to some technological innovations. Public announcement systems using audio induction loop technology can broadcast announcements directly into the hearing aid of anyone with a hearing impairment, making them useful in such public places as auditoriums and train stations.

== Public space ==
The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006) requires ‘appropriate measures’ to ensure people with disabilities are able to ‘access, on an equal basis with others&#x27;,&#x27;the physical environment’, ‘transportation’ and ‘other facilities and services open or provided to the public’’. This requirement also applies to ‘roads’ and ‘transportation’ as well as ‘buildings, and other indoor and outdoor facilities’. 

At the same time, promotion of active travel, or &#x27;shared space&#x27; initiatives to pedestrianise city centres can introduce unintended barriers, especially for pedestrians who are visually impaired and who can find these environments confusing or even dangerous. It is important to have effective mechanisms to ensure that urban spaces are designed to be inclusive of pedestrians with disabilities. These can include early consultation with disabled persons or their representative organisations, and appropriate regulation of city planning.

==Housing==

Most existing and new housing, even in the wealthiest nations, lack basic accessibility features unless the designated, immediate occupant of a home currently has a disability. However, there are some initiatives to change typical residential practices so that new homes incorporate basic access features such as zero-step entries and door widths adequate for wheelchairs to pass through. Occupational Therapists are a professional group skilled in the assessment and making of recommendations to improve access to homes. They are involved in both the adaptation of existing housing to improve accessibility, and in the design of future housing.

The broad concept of Universal design is relevant to housing, as it is to all aspects of the built environment. Furthermore, a Visitability movement begun by grass roots disability advocates in the 1980s focuses specifically on changing construction practices in new housing. This movement, a network of interested people working in their locales, works on educating, passing laws, and spurring voluntary home access initiatives with the intention that basic access become a routine part of new home construction.

===Accessibility and &quot;ageing in place&quot;===
Accessibility in the design of housing and household devices has become more prominent in recent decades due to a rapidly ageing population in developed countries. Ageing seniors may wish to continue living independently, but the ageing process naturally increases the disabilities that a senior citizen will experience. A growing trend is the desire for many senior citizens to &#x27;age in place&#x27;, living as independently as possible for as long as possible. Accessibility modifications that allow ageing in place are becoming more common. Housing may even be designed to incorporate accessibility modifications that can be made throughout the life cycle of the residents.

The English Housing Survey for 2018/19 found only 9% of homes in England have key features, such as a toilet at entrance level and sufficiently wide doorways, to deem them accessible. This was an improvement from 5% in 2005. More than 400,000 wheelchair users in England were living in homes which are neither adapted nor accessible.

==Voting==
Under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, states parties are bound to assure accessible elections, voting, and voting procedures. In 2018, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities issued an opinion that all polling stations should be fully accessible. At the European Court of Human Rights, there are currently two ongoing cases about the accessibility of polling places and voting procedures. They were brought against Slovenia by two voters and the Slovenian Disability Rights Association. As of January 2020, the case, called Toplak and Mrak v. Slovenia, was ongoing. The aim of the court procedure is to make accessible all polling places in Europe.

==Disability, information technology (IT) and telecommunications==


Advances in information technology and telecommunications have represented a leap forward for accessibility. Access to the technology is restricted to those who can afford it, but it has become more widespread in Western countries in recent years. For those who use it, it provides the ability to access information and services by minimizing the barriers of distance and cost as well as the accessibility and usability of the interface. In many countries this has led to initiatives, laws and/or regulations that aim toward providing universal access to the internet and to phone systems at reasonable cost to citizens.

A major advantage of advanced technology is its flexibility. Some technologies can be used at home, in the workplace, and in school, expanding the ability of the user to participate in various spheres of daily life. Augmentative and alternative communication technology is one such area of IT progress. It includes inventions such as speech-generating devices, teletypewriter devices, adaptive pointing devices to replace computer mouse devices, and many others. Mobile telecommunications devices and computer applications are also equipped with accessibility features. They can be adapted to create accessibility to a range of tasks, and may be suitable for different kinds of disability.

The following impairments are some of the disabilities that affect communications and technology access, as well as many other life activities:
* Communication disorders;
* Hearing impairments;
* Visual impairments;
* Mobility impairments;
* A learning disability or impairment in mental functioning.

Each kind of disability requires a different kind of accommodation, and this may require analysis by a medical specialist, an educational specialist or a job analysis when the impairment requires accommodation.
* Job analysis

===Examples of common assistive technologies===
====Mobility impairments====
One of the first areas where information technology improved the quality of life for disabled individuals is the voice operated wheelchair. Quadriplegics have the most profound disability, and the voice operated wheelchair technology was first developed in 1977 to provide increased mobility. The original version replaced the joystick system with a module that recognized 8 commands. Many other technology accommodation improvements have evolved from this initial development.

Missing arms or fingers may make the use of a keyboard and mouse difficult or impossible. Technological improvements such as speech recognition devices and software can improve access.

====Communication (including speech) impairments====
A communication disorder interferes with the ability to produce clearly understandable speech. There can be many different causes, such as nerve degeneration, muscle degeneration, stroke, and vocal cord injury. The modern method to deal with speaking disabilities has been to provide a text interface for a speech synthesizer for complete vocal disability. This can be a great improvement for people that have been limited to the use of a throat vibrator to produce speech since the 1960s.

====Hearing impairment====
An individual satisfies the definition of hearing disabled when hearing loss is about 30 dB for a single frequency, but this is not always perceptible as a disability. For example, loss of sensitivity in one ear interferes with sound localization (directional hearing), which can interfere with communication in a crowd. This is often recognized when certain words are confused during normal conversation. This can interfere with voice-only interfaces, like automated customer service telephone systems, because it is sometimes difficult to increase the volume and repeat the message.

Mild to moderate hearing loss may be accommodated with a hearing aid that amplifies ambient sounds. Portable devices with speed recognition that can produce text can reduce problems associated with understanding conversation. This kind of hearing loss is relatively common, and this often grows worse with age.

The modern method to deal with profound hearing disability is the Internet using email or word processing applications. The telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) became available in the form of the teletype (TTY) during the 1960s. These devices consist of a keyboard, display and modem that connects two or more of these devices using a dedicated wire or plain old telephone service.

Modern computer animation allows for sign language avatars to be integrated into public areas. This technology could potentially make train station announcements, news broadcasts, etc. accessible when a human interpreter is not available. Sign language can also be incorporated into film; for example, all movies shown in Brazilian movie theaters must have a Brazilian Sign Language video track available to play alongside the film via a second screen.

====Visual impairments====
A wide array of technology products is available to assist with visual impairment. These include screen magnification for monitors, screen-reading software for computers and mobile devices, mouse-over speech synthesis for browsing, braille displays, braille printers, braille cameras, and voice-activated phones and tablets.

One emerging product that will make ordinary computer displays available for the blind is the refreshable tactile display, which is very different from a conventional braille display. This provides a raised surface corresponding to the bright and dim spots on a conventional display. An example is the Touch Sight Camera for the Blind.

Speech Synthesis Markup Language and Speech Recognition Grammar Specification) are relatively recent technologies intended to standardize communication interfaces using Augmented BNF Form and XML Form. These technologies assist visual impairments and physical impairment by providing interactive access to web content without the need to visually observe the content. While these technologies provides access for visually impaired individuals, the primary benefactor has been automated systems that replace live human customer service representatives that handle telephone calls.

===Web accessibility===
====International standards and guidelines====
There have been a few major movements to coordinate a set of guidelines for accessibility for the web. The first and most well known is The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This organization developed the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 and 2.0 which explain how to make Web content accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. Web &quot;content&quot; generally refers to the information in a Web page or Web application, including text, images, forms, and sounds. (More specific definitions are available in the WCAG documents.)

The WCAG is separated into three levels of compliance, A, AA and AAA. Each level requires a stricter set of conformance guidelines, such as different versions of HTML (Transitional vs Strict) and other techniques that need to be incorporated into coding before accomplishing validation. Online tools allow users to submit their website and automatically run it through the WCAG guidelines and produce a report, stating whether or not they conform to each level of compliance. Adobe Dreamweaver also offers plugins which allow web developers to test these guidelines on their work from within the program.

The ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36 WG7 24751 Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training series is freely available and made of 3 parts: Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training, Standards inventory and Guidance on user needs mapping.

Another source of web accessibility guidance comes from the US government. In response to Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act, the Access Board developed standards to which U.S. federal agencies must comply in order to make their sites accessible. The U.S. General Services Administration has developed a website where one can take online training courses for free to learn about these rules.

====Web accessibility features====
Examples of accessibility features include:
* WAI-AA compliance with the WAI&#x27;s WCAG
* Semantic Web markup
* (X)HTML Validation from the W3C for the page&#x27;s content
* CSS Validation from the W3C for the page&#x27;s layout
* Compliance with all guidelines from Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act
* A high contrast version of the site for individuals with low vision, and a low contrast (yellow or blue) version of the site for individuals with dyslexia
* Alternative media for any multimedia used on the site (video, flash, audio, etc.)
* Simple and consistent navigation
* Device independent
* Reducing Cognitive load for decision making

While WCAG provides much technical information for use by web designers, coders and editors, &quot;BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility – Code of Practice&quot; has been introduced, initially in the UK, to help site owners and product managers to understand the importance of accessibility. It includes advice on the business case behind accessibility, and how organisations might usefully update their policies and production processes to embed accessibility in their business-as-usual. On 28 May 2019, BS 8878 was superseded by &quot;ISO 30071-1&quot;, the international Standard that built on BS 8878 and expanded it for international use.

Another useful idea is for websites to include a web accessibility statement on the site. Initially introduced in PAS 78, the best practice for web accessibility statements has been updated in BS 8878 to emphasise the inclusion of: information on how disabled and elderly people could get a better experience of using the website by using assistive technologies or accessibility settings of browsers and operating systems (linking to &quot;BBC My Web My Way&quot; can be useful here); information on what accessibility features the site&#x27;s creators have included, and if there are any user needs which the site does not currently support (for example, descriptive video to allow blind people to access the information in videos more easily); and contact details for disabled people to be able to use to let the site creators know if they have any problems in using the site. While validations against WCAG, and other accessibility badges can also be included, they should be put lower down the statement, as most disabled people still do not understand these technical terms.

==Education and accessibility for students==

Equal access to education for students with disabilities is supported in some countries by legislation. It is still challenging for some students with disabilities to fully participate in mainstream education settings, but many adaptive technologies and assistive programs are making improvements. In India, the Medical Council of India has now passed the directives to all the medical institutions to make them accessible to persons with disabilities. This happened due to a petition by Satendra Singh founder of Infinite Ability.

Students with a physical or mental impairment or learning disability may require note-taking assistance, which may be provided by a business offering such services, as with tutoring services. Talking books in the form of talking textbooks are available in Canadian secondary and post-secondary schools. Also, students may require adaptive technology to access computers and the Internet. These may be tax-exempt expenses in some jurisdictions with a medical prescription.

===Accessibility of assessments===
It is important to ensure that the accessibility in education includes assessments. Accessibility in testing or assessments entails the extent to which a test and its constituent item set eliminates barriers and permits the test-taker to demonstrate their knowledge of the tested content.

With the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 in the United States, student accountability in essential content areas such as reading, mathematics, and science has become a major area of focus in educational reform. As a result, test developers have needed to create tests to ensure all students, including those with special needs (e.g., students identified with disabilities), are given the opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which they have mastered the content measured on state assessments. Currently, states are permitted to develop two different types of tests in addition to the standard grade-level assessments to target students with special needs. First, the alternate assessment may be used to report proficiency for up to 1% of students in a state. Second, new regulations permit the use of alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards to report proficiency for up to 2% of students in a state.

To ensure that these new tests generate results that allow valid inferences to be made about student performance, they must be accessible to as many people as possible. The Test Accessibility and Modification Inventory (TAMI) and its companion evaluation tool, the Accessibility Rating Matrix (ARM), were designed to facilitate the evaluation of tests and test items with a focus on enhancing their accessibility. Both instruments incorporate the principles of accessibility theory and were guided by research on universal design, assessment accessibility, cognitive load theory, and research on item writing and test development. The TAMI is a non-commercial instrument that has been made available to all state assessment directors and testing companies. Assessment researchers have used the ARM to conduct accessibility reviews of state assessment items for several state departments of education.

<doc id="302111" wikidata="Q1141946" url="?curid=302111" title="Final Fight (video game)">
<text>is a 1989 beat &#x27;em up game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. It is the seventh title released for the CP System hardware. Set in the fictional Metro City, the player controls one of three street fighters: former pro wrestler and city mayor Mike Haggar, expert brawler Cody Travers, and modern-day ninja Guy. The trio set out to rescue Jessica (Haggar&#x27;s daughter and Cody&#x27;s girlfriend) when she is kidnapped by the Mad Gear Gang.

The game began development as a sequel to the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot; released in 1987, under the working title but the genre was switched from a fighting game to a beat &#x27;em up and the title was changed to &quot;Final Fight&quot; following the success of Technōs Japan&#x27;s Double Dragon. &quot;Final Fight&quot; was ported to various home computers and consoles, including the ZX Spectrum, Super NES and Sega CD.

It became a major commercial success in arcades, selling 30,000 arcade units worldwide while becoming the highest-grossing arcade game of 1990 in Japan and the year&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade conversion kit in the United States. The Super NES version also sold cartridges worldwide. Now considered one of the greatest video games of all time, it spawned the &quot;Final Fight&quot; sub-series from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series, followed by several sequels. Its development team later worked on the original &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, and some of the characters from &quot;Final Fight&quot; later appeared as playable fighters in other entries of the franchise, such as the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; sub-series.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Final Fight&quot; can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: Haggar, Cody and Guy. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.

The controls for &quot;Final Fight&quot; consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons, one each for attacking and jumping. By entering different combinations of joystick moves and button presses, the player can perform a variety of attacks:

* A flurry of standing punches/kicks
* A jumping forward kick
* A downward-directed jumping attack that can stun the enemy
* A grab at the enemy, allowing the player to either deliver further strikes or throw/slam them to the ground
* A spinning attack, which knocks down all enemies in the vicinity but drains a portion of the player&#x27;s health

Obstacles such as barrels, trash cans and oil drums can be broken open to reveal weapons (pipes, swords, knives), health-restoring food and items awarding bonus points; these can be picked up by standing over them and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too many times or when the player moves to a new area. If the player is carrying a weapon, they will drop it upon picking up a new one.

&quot;Final Fight&quot; consists of six stages or &quot;rounds&quot;, as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway; most rounds feature more than one section, and all have a time limit. The player confronts a boss character at the end of each round, culminating in a fight against gang leader Belger in the sixth and final round.

One life is lost whenever the player runs out of either health or time. The game ends when all lives are lost, but the player may spend a credit to continue from that point and choose a different character if desired.

==Plot==
The game is set in a fictional city on the Atlantic coast in the United States named Metro City (analogous with New York City). According to the game&#x27;s intro, in the 1990s (or 1989 in the Japanese version), the city&#x27;s crime rate reached alarming levels, but since the election of pro wrestler turned politician Mike Haggar as the new Mayor, Metro City was changed and cleaned up drastically. Under his term, Haggar managed to suppress the crime rate of the city to its lowest points. While the citizens of Metro City were thankful for Haggar&#x27;s hard work in curbing crime, the Mad Gear Gang, who had served as the dominant criminal organization of Metro City, would not go down so easily. Under the leadership of the crooked businessman Belger, the group attempted to bribe Haggar with a large payoff to keep him from going after them, to which Haggar refused. Still determined to bring Haggar under their rule like the last mayor before him, Mad Gear proceeded to kidnap his daughter Jessica and create further unrest among the citizens. When Haggar finds out about his daughter&#x27;s abduction, he becomes furious and decides to take his fight against Mad Gear to a personal level. Seeking additional manpower, Haggar recruits Cody Travers: an expert fighter and Jessica&#x27;s boyfriend, as well as Guy: a ninja in training and Cody&#x27;s good friend/rival. The three dedicate themselves to the complete eradication of the Mad Gear Gang, and to rescue Jessica from their clutches.

The game gained notoriety for its unique continue screen, where the player character is shown tied to a chair with a lit bundle of dynamite on the table in front of him; the character struggles to escape as the 10-second time limit counts down. If the player activates the continue option, a knife falls from the ceiling and cuts the fuse.

==Development==
The game was designed by Akira Nishitani, and produced by Yoshiki Okamoto. When coming up with the game&#x27;s concept, Okamoto cited the arcade game &quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot; (1988) as his basis for &quot;Final Fight&quot;. The game was originally shown at trade shows under the title of &quot;Street Fighter &#x27;89&quot;. According to Okamoto, the sales division of Capcom originally requested a &quot;Street Fighter&quot; sequel, so his team decided to promote &quot;Final Fight&quot; as a &quot;Street Fighter&quot; sequel at trade shows (going as far to refer to one of the main characters as a &quot;former Street Fighter&quot;). The title was changed to &quot;Final Fight&quot; before its official release after feedback from operators stating that the game was nothing like &quot;Street Fighter&quot;.

According to the developers, they were originally planning to have Ryu and Ken Masters from the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot; as the playable protagonists, but that idea was scrapped for a new plot and new settings, involving the kidnapping of an attractive young woman by a city gang. Capcom&#x27;s president wanted the team to develop the game as if it was a film, so he made the team watch a number of films. Nishitani&#x27;s team then approached the &quot;planning and design as if it were a movie.&quot;

The street gang the player faces in the game, the Mad Gear Gang, takes their name from the 1987 overhead racing game &quot;Mad Gear&quot; by Capcom; the game was released as &quot;Led Storm&quot; outside Japan. Many of the characters are named after 1980s rock musicians such as Axl Rose (Axl), Slash (Slash), Gene Simmons (Simons), Sid Vicious (Sid), Billy Idol (Billy), King Diamond (Abigail, named after King Diamond&#x27;s second album, also dons facepaint similar to King Diamond&#x27;s), Sodom (Sodom), Roxy Music (Roxy), The Damned (Damnd) and Poison (Poison), with another, 2P (Two.P), being from the Capcom game &quot;Forgotten Worlds&quot;. Hugo Andore, another notable enemy character, is based on André the Giant. Because Capcom believed that &quot;players would feel bad beating up a woman&quot;, they noted in the manual that the female opponent Poison was a &quot;newhalf&quot;.

The soundtrack was the work of seven sound composers: Manami Matsumae, Yoshihiro Sakaguchi, Harumi Fujita, Junko Tamiya, Yasuaki Fujita (in his first work for Capcom), Hiromitsu Takaoka and Yoko Shimomura. Despite this, Sakaguchi is the only composer credited in the game (as &quot;Youkichan&#x27;s Papa&quot;). The other six were confirmed as having worked on &quot;Final Fight&quot; in 2014 when the Clarice Disk imprint of City Connection released the &quot;Final Fight Original Sound Collection&quot;, which featured the original soundtracks to the three original &quot;Final Fight&quot; games and its accompanying ports.

In a 2007 interview, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine asked Akira Nishitani about the game&#x27;s similarities to the 1984 film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;. Nishitani said that, at the time, the team were not &quot;aware of &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;, but I&#x27;ve Googled it and there does indeed seem to be something familiar about it&quot; but that &quot;this style of story was very popular back then&quot; and many &quot;fighting games made use of it&quot; so &quot;I guess we were part of that crowd!&quot; Despite these claims, the official interview in the Japanese book &quot;How to Make Capcom Fighting Characters&quot; ( ストリートファイター キャラクターメイキング ) released in 2018 has Nishitani explaining that during development his boss K.Tsujimoto asked him literally to watch &quot;all the movies&quot; by Walter Hill, especially &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; referred to by fellow developer Akiman (Akira Yasuda) in the same conversation. The movies were viewed on three different monitors at the same time as they &quot;lacked time&quot;, then he literally &quot;cut and pasted&quot; movie stills in the specially dedicated &quot;Video Materials Room&quot;. Also, when asked if &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; was the main influence giving the impression of being in &quot;Downtown New York&quot; in &quot;Final Fight&quot;, Akiman replied positively. Other sources of inspiration included &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, namely the protagonist Jean Valjean who becomes a mayor in the latter half of the story and his role as a devoted father, and the manga series &quot;Mad Bull 34&quot;, which influenced Haggar&#x27;s appearance.

==Home versions==

===Super NES (&quot;Final Fight&quot; and &quot;Final Fight Guy&quot;)===
A port of &quot;Final Fight&quot; for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was released as a launch title for the platform in Japan in 1990 and later in North America in 1991 and then in the PAL region in 1992. It was released for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service in 2007 and the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2013. The Super NES port removed the two-player co-op option, the Industrial Area level and playable character Guy. Most of the scene transitions were also edited out. In the arcade version, the player characters would be seen exiting the levels and breaking through doors unlike the Super NES version. Due to hardware limitations the Super NES version could only display two or three enemies on-screen, in contrast to the CPS arcade version, which could display up to nine or ten enemies on-screen; to make up for this difference, the Super NES version features more stopping points than the arcade version and the enemy placement is vastly different.

The English localization of the Super NES port was censored for its content and features several differences from its Japanese Super Famicom counterpart: the first two bosses, Damnd and Sodom, were renamed Thrasher and Katana, respectively; Belger&#x27;s wheelchair was re-drawn to look like an office chair; Poison, a woman with pink hair, and Roxy, a woman with red hair, were replaced with two male enemies named Billy and Sid; all alcoholic references were removed, with two health-recovering items replaced; the line &quot;Oh! My God&quot;, spoken by an enemy when his car is destroyed during the first bonus stage, was changed to &quot;Oh! My Car&quot;; the blood splash effect shown when a character is stabbed was replaced by a generic explosion; and some of the darker skinned enemy characters were given lighter skin tones. The original soundtrack was ported for the Super NES by Toshio Kajino (credited as &quot;Bull&quot;).

A revised edition of the Super NES port, titled Final Fight Guy, was released in Japan in 1992. This version replaced Cody with Guy as a selectable character (with a new opening and ending sequence explaining Cody&#x27;s absence), included four difficulty settings, and added other new features such as two new power-ups, although the Industrial Area stage and the two-player mode were still omitted. An American version of the game (featuring the same changes in the localization as in the first game) was released in June 1994 as a rental-only game that was initially available at Blockbuster stores, although it was later given a limited release. Kajino&#x27;s music port was retained for that version.

===U.S. Gold versions===
U.S. Gold released ports of &quot;Final Fight&quot; for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC for the European market in 1991. These ports were developed by Creative Materials. In February 1993, the ZX Spectrum version was released as part of the &quot;Super Fighter&quot; compilation with &quot;Pit Fighter&quot; and &quot;WWF WrestleMania&quot;.

===X68000===
The Sharp X68000 version was released by Capcom exclusively in Japan on July 17, 1992. This version is a relatively close conversion of the arcade game, with the only notable changes being different music (with a choice between a MIDI soundtrack and one using the X68000&#x27;s internal sound chip) and a lower maximum on-screen enemies. The game came packaged with a CD soundtrack with all new remixed tunes.

===Mega-CD/Sega CD (&quot;Final Fight CD&quot;)===
The Mega-CD/Sega CD version, titled &quot;Final Fight CD&quot;, was ported by A Wave and published by Sega under license from Capcom in 1993. This version retains nearly all the features of the arcade game that were removed in the two Super NES ports (namely the two-player mode, the Industrial Area stage and the ability to play as any of the three main characters) and adds voice acting to the game&#x27;s opening and ending sequences, an arranged version of the original soundtrack, and an exclusive time attack mode. However the maximum number of on-screen enemies were still lower than the arcade version and the combo attacks of Cody and Guy are much slower. Furthermore, the graphics suffered from a more limited color palette, as well as fewer background details. Like the Super NES version, the Mega-CD version was censored for the English localization with many of the same changes. Poison and Roxy were kept, but were redrawn with less revealing clothing.

===Game Boy Advance (&quot;Final Fight One&quot;)===
The Game Boy Advance version that was developed by Sun-Tec, titled &quot;Final Fight One&quot;, was released in 2001. &quot;Final Fight One&quot; features all three characters and the Industrial Area stage that was missing from the Super NES version. The two-player cooperative mode is also featured via link cable. Dialogue scenes prior to each boss battle have been added and the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; renditions of Cody and Guy are featured as hidden playable characters. Other unlockable features include alternate palettes for each player character and the ability for two players to use the same character. The character and background designs are lifted from the Super NES versions rather than the original arcade version, with the enemy placement being similar to &quot;Final Fight Guy&quot;, although the maximum number of on-screen enemies was increased and all the transition sequences were restored. The same new power-up items introduced in &quot;Final Fight Guy&quot; are also present in this version, along with a new Cody doll item. The English localization of the game featured the same changes as the two Super NES versions.

===&quot;Capcom Classics Collection&quot;===
&quot;Final Fight&quot; is included in the 2005 compilation &quot;Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox and in the 2006 portable version &quot;Capcom Classics Collection Remixed&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. The game is emulated from the original CP System arcade version and features very little differences from the arcade game. The compilation includes tips, character profiles, an art gallery and a sound test as bonus features.

===&quot;Final Fight: Streetwise&quot;===
The arcade version is also included as a hidden bonus game in the 2006 game &quot;Final Fight: Streetwise&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. However, the emulation in this version was programmed by Ultracade, rather than Digital Eclipse (the developers of &quot;Capcom Classics Collection&quot; series). The controls cannot be adjusted and the quality is lower than other emulated versions.

===&quot;Final Fight: Double Impact&quot;===
The arcade version of &quot;Final Fight&quot; was released in a two-in-one bundle titled &quot;Final Fight: Double Impact&quot;, alongside the arcade game &quot;Magic Sword&quot;, released digitally for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Added features include various graphic filters, including an arcade cabinet view; online drop-in multiplayer; an arranged soundtrack composed by Simon Viklund; and extra content such as concept art, fan art, &quot;Street Fighter&quot; comic pages featuring &quot;Final Fight&quot; characters and the &quot;Final Fight&quot; episode of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; animated series, which are unlocked by completing certain in-game challenges. The game was ported and developed by Proper Games and released for Xbox Live Arcade for 800 Microsoft points and April 15, 2010, for PlayStation Network for $9.99. The PS3 version features a very restrictive DRM protection which circumvents the ability other PSN games have to be shared among several PSN accounts. The DRM protection was met with a negative response as it had not been disclosed previous to the game&#x27;s release. On March 27, 2012, &quot;Double Impact&quot; was released as part of the &quot;Capcom Digital Collection&quot; for the Xbox 360.

===iOS===
On September 15, 2011, &quot;Final Fight&quot; was released into Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store. This version includes all three characters from the Arcade version, a multiplayer feature that can only be used with Wi-Fi and a special items where one can turn on Extra Lives, Super Special and Meat Explosion. However, the game no longer became available after the latest iOS updates from Apple.

===&quot;Capcom Beat &#x27;Em Up Bundle&quot;===
In 2018, &quot;Final Fight&quot; was re-released alongside &quot;Captain Commando&quot;, &quot;The King of Dragons&quot;, &quot;Knights of the Round&quot;, &quot;Warriors of Fate&quot;, &quot;Armored Warriors&quot; and &quot;Battle Circuit&quot; in &quot;Capcom Beat &#x27;Em Up Bundle&quot; for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows.

==Reception==

===Commercial===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Final Fight&quot; on their January 15, 1990 issue as being the second-most-successful table arcade cabinet of the month. It went on to be the highest-grossing arcade game of 1990 in Japan (according to the annual &quot;Gamest&quot; charts), as well as Japan&#x27;s second-highest-grossing arcade game of 1991 (just below &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;).

Overseas, the game had a successful launch in North America and Europe. In the United States, it was a blockbuster hit, becoming the top-grossing new video game on the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts in February 1990, and then the top-grossing software conversion kit for eight months in 1990, from March to April, then from June to October, and then December. During November and December, weekly coin drop earnings averaged $183.50 per kit. It ended the year as America&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade conversion kit of 1990. &quot;Final Fight&quot; sold a total of 30,000 arcade units worldwide.

The Super NES version was also a commercial success. It sold 1.5 million copies worldwide, becoming one of Capcom&#x27;s best-selling games on the platform.

===Critical===
The game was acclaimed by critics. &quot;Mega&quot; magazine compared the Mega CD version of the game favorably against the incomplete and &quot;poor&quot; Super NES version and placed it top of their list of the best Mega CD games of all time. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; declared it a strong conversion of a game with &quot;solid fighting action&quot;, though two of them also commented that &quot;the necessity of the CD is questionable at best.&quot;

Bran D. Butter reviewed the SNES version, giving it a generally favorable review, calling it a &quot;classy beat &#x27;em&quot; and praising the &quot;superb&quot; graphics. However, the review criticized missing features from the arcade original, including the lack of two-player, missing levels and the missing player character Guy. On release of the Game Boy Advance version of the game, &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine scored it a 31 out of 40.

===Accolades===
In the February 1991 issue of the Japanese coin-operated video game magazine &quot;Gamest&quot;, &quot;Final Fight&quot; took the No. 1 spot as the Best Game of 1990 in the 4th Annual Grand Prize. &quot;Final Fight&quot; also won the category of Best Action Game, placed No. 4 in Best Video Game Music, No. 9 in Best Graphics, No. 2 in Best Direction and No. 5 in Best Album. The character Mike Haggar was displayed on the cover of this issue, who took the No. 1 spot in the Top 50 Characters of the year, with Guy in second place, Cody at No. 7, Poison at No. 26, Sodom at No. 33 and Jessica at No. 40. In a 1991 &quot;Gamest&quot; reader poll, &quot;Final Fight&quot; was voted the second-best arcade game of all time, just below &quot;Valkyrie no Densetsu&quot; (1990). In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; ranked the game 87th on its Top 100 SNES Games writing: &quot;Tragically, it&#x27;s missing one of the main characters but this was still a stonking conversion.&quot;

&quot;Crash&quot; gave the ZX Spectrum port a &quot;Crash Smash&quot; award. &quot;MegaTech&quot; gave the Sega Mega-CD port a &quot;Hyper Game&quot; award.

===Retrospective===
In 1997, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked the SNES version as the 97th-best game on any Nintendo platform. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; included it among top ten Mega CD games, describing it as &quot;arguably the best home console conversion (aside from recent emulated ports)&quot; of &quot;unquestionably the quintessential arcade hit of the late Eighties.&quot; IGN ranked the SNES version 100th on their Top 100 SNES Games of All Time. In 2018, Complex ranked Final Fight 87th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Final Fight&quot; was followed by a few sequels. The total sales of the &quot;Final Fight&quot; series have totaled 3.2 million units for home systems.

The Super Famicom version of the game is a key element in the plot of the manga &quot;Hi Score Girl&quot; and its Netflix anime adaptation.

<doc id="302125" wikidata="Q712791" url="?curid=302125" title="E. Howard Hunt">
<text>Everette Howard Hunt Jr. (October 9, 1918 – January 23, 2007) was an American intelligence officer and author. From 1949 to 1970, Hunt served as an officer in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), where he was a central figure in U.S. regime change in Latin America including the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état and the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion in Cuba. Along with G. Gordon Liddy, Frank Sturgis, and others, Hunt was one of the Nixon administration&#x27;s so-called White House Plumbers, a team of operatives charged with identifying government leaks to outside parties.

Hunt and Liddy plotted the Watergate burglaries and other clandestine operations for the Nixon administration. In the Watergate scandal, Hunt was convicted of burglary, conspiracy, and wiretapping, and was sentenced to 33 months in prison. After his release, Hunt lived in Mexico and then Miami until his death in January 2007.

==Early life and education==

Hunt was born in Hamburg, New York, the son of Ethel Jean (Totterdale) and Everette Howard Hunt Sr., an attorney and Republican Party official.

He attended Hamburg High School in Hamburg, where he graduated in 1936 along with fellow classmate Howard J. Osborn. He then attended Brown University, an Ivy League university in Providence, Rhode Island, where he graduated in 1940.

==Career==
===U.S. military and OSS===
During World War II, Hunt served in the U.S. Navy on the destroyer USS &quot;Mayo&quot; and the U.S. Army Air Corps. He also served in China with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency.

===Author===
Hunt was a prolific author, publishing 73 books during his lifetime. During and after World War II, he wrote several novels under his own name, including &quot;East of Farewell&quot; (1942), &quot;Limit of Darkness&quot; (1944), &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; (1947), &quot;Maelstrom&quot; (1949) &quot;Bimini Run&quot; (1949), and &quot;The Violent Ones&quot; (1950). He also wrote spy and hardboiled novels under an array of pseudonyms, including Robert Dietrich, Gordon Davis, David St. John, and P. S. Donoghue.

Some parallels exist between Hunt&#x27;s writings and his experiences during the Watergate scandal and espionage. He continued his writing career after he was released from prison, publishing nearly twenty spy thrillers between 1980 and 2000.

In 1946, Hunt was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for his writing.

===Economic Cooperation Administration===
Prior to 1949, Hunt served as an officer in the Information Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration, a predecessor of the Mutual Security Agency.

===Central Intelligence Agency===
Shortly following the end of World War II, the OSS was disbanded. In 1947, with the Cold War emerging and intensifying, the absence of a central intelligence organization was seen as a national security deficiency, and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was formed. In October 1949, just as Warner Bros. acquired the rights to Hunt&#x27;s novel &quot;Bimini Run&quot;, Hunt joined the CIA&#x27;s Office of Policy Coordination (OPC). He was assigned as a covert action officer specializing in political action and influence in what later came to be the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Center.

====Mexico City====

In 1950, Hunt was appointed OPC Station Chief in Mexico City, where he recruited and supervised William F. Buckley Jr., who worked under Hunt in his OPC Station in Mexico from 1951 to 1952. Buckley and Hunt remained lifelong friends, and Buckley became godfather to Hunt&#x27;s first three children.

In Mexico, Hunt helped lay the framework for Operation PBFortune, later renamed Operation PBSuccess, the successful covert operation to overthrow Jacobo Árbenz, the democratically elected president of Guatemala. Hunt would later said, &quot;What we wanted to do was to have a terror campaign, to terrify Arbenz particularly, to terrify his troops, much as the German Stuka bombers terrified the population of Holland, Belgium and Poland.&quot;

Hunt was then assigned as Chief of Covert Action in Japan, and later as Chief of Station in Uruguay, where he was noted by American diplomatic contemporary Samuel F. Hart for controversial working methods.

====Bay of Pigs invasion====

Hunt was subsequently assigned responsibility for organizing Cuban exile leaders in the United States into a suitably representative government-in-exile that would, after the Bay of Pigs Invasion, form a pro-American government that could replace Fidel Castro.

Planning for the Bay of Pigs invasion began during the Eisenhower administration, but Hunt was later bitter about what he perceived as President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s lack of commitment to the operation, which was designed to attack and overthrow the Castro government. In his semi-fictional autobiography, &quot;Give Us This Day&quot;, Hunt wrote, &quot;The Kennedy administration yielded Castro all the excuse he needed to gain a tighter grip on the island of José Martí, then moved shamefacedly into the shadows and hoped the Cuban issue would simply melt away.&quot;

In 1959, Hunt helped CIA Director Allen W. Dulles write &quot;The Craft of Intelligence&quot;. The following year, in 1960, Hunt established Brigade 2506, a CIA-sponsored group of Cuban exiles formed to attempt the military overthrow of the Castro&#x27;s government in Cuba. The Bay of Pigs invasion commenced on April 17, 1961, but was quickly aborted and viewed as a fiasco. Hunt was then reassigned as executive assistant to Dulles.
In 1961, President Kennedy fired Dulles for the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.

Hunt then served from 1962 to 1964 as the first Chief of Covert Action for the CIA&#x27;s Domestic Operations Division (DODS).

In 1974, Hunt told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he worked for DODS for approximately four years, beginning in 1962, shortly after the agency&#x27;s establishment by the Kennedy administration over the objection of Richard Helms and Thomas H. Karamessines. Hunt said that the division was assembled shortly after the Bay of Pigs operation, and that &quot;many men connected with that failure were shunted into the new domestic unit.&quot; He said that some of his projects from 1962 to 1966 dealt largely with subsidizing and manipulating news and publishing organizations in the United States, which he said &quot;did seem to violate the intent of the agency&#x27;s charter.&quot;

In 1964, John A. McCone, then deputy chief of intelligence at the CIA, directed Hunt to take a special assignment as a Non-official cover officer in Madrid, Spain, tasked with creating an American answer to Ian Fleming&#x27;s British MI-6 James Bond novel series. While in Spain, Hunt was covered as a recently retired U.S. State Department Foreign Service Officer who moved his family to Spain in order to write the first installment of the nine-novel Peter Ward series, &quot;On Hazardous Duty&quot;, published in 1965.

After a year and a half in Spain, Hunt returned to his assignment at DODS. Following a brief tenure on the Special Activities Staff of the Western European Division, he became Chief of Covert Action for the region in July 1968, and was based in the Washington metropolitan area. Hunt was lauded for his &quot;sagacity, balance and imagination&quot;, and received the second-highest rating of Strong signifying &quot;performance ... characterized by exceptional proficiency&quot; in a performance review from the Division&#x27;s Chief of Operations in April 1969. However, this was downgraded to the third-highest rating of &quot;Adequate&quot; in an amended review from the Division&#x27;s Deputy Chief, who recognized Hunt&#x27;s &quot;broad experience&quot; but opined that &quot;a series of personal and taxing problems&quot; had &quot;tended to dull his cutting edge.&quot;

Hunt later said that he &quot;had been stigmatized by the Bay of Pigs&quot;, and had come to terms with the fact that he &quot;would not get promoted too much higher.&quot;

In his final years with the CIA, Hunt began to cultivate new contacts in society and the business world. While serving as vice president of Brown University&#x27;s club in Washington, D.C., he befriended and commenced a strong association with the organization&#x27;s president, former congressional aide Charles Colson, who was working on Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidential campaign.

===CIA retirement===
Hunt retired from the CIA at the pay grade of GS-15, Step 8 on April 30, 1970.

After retiring from the CIA, Hunt neglected to elect survivorship benefits for his wife. In April 1971, he requested to retroactively amend his election but was rebuffed by the agency. In a May 5, 1972, letter to CIA General Counsel Lawrence Houston, Hunt raised the possibility of returning to active duty for a short period of time in exchange for activating the benefits upon his proposed second retirement. Houston advised Hunt in his May 16, 1972, response that this &quot;would be in violation of the spirit of the CIA Retirement Act&quot;.

===Robert R. Mullen Company===

Immediately following his retirement, Hunt went to work for the Robert R. Mullen Company, which cooperated with the CIA; H. R. Haldeman, White House Chief of Staff to President Nixon, wrote in 1978 that the Mullen Company was in fact a CIA front company, a fact that was apparently unknown to Haldeman while he worked in the White House. Through CIA&#x27;s Project QKENCHANT, Hunt obtained a Covert Security Approval to handle the firm&#x27;s affairs during Mullen&#x27;s absence from Washington.

===White House===

In 1971, Colson, who was then director of Nixon&#x27;s Office of Public Liaison, hired Hunt, where he joined the White House Special Investigations Unit, specializing in political sabotage.

Hunt&#x27;s first assignment for the White House was a covert operation to break into the Los Angeles office of Daniel Ellsberg&#x27;s psychiatrist, Lewis J. Fielding. In July 1971, Fielding refused a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for psychiatric data on Ellsberg. Hunt and Liddy cased the building in late August. The burglary, on September 3, 1971, was not detected, but no Ellsberg files were found.

In the summer of 1971, Colson authorized Hunt to travel to New England to seek potentially scandalous information on Senator Edward Kennedy related to Chappaquiddick incident and Kennedy&#x27;s possible extramarital affairs. Hunt sought and used CIA disguises and other equipment for the project. The mission eventually proved unsuccessful, with little useful information uncovered by Hunt.

Hunt&#x27;s White House duties included assassinations-related disinformation. In September 1971, Hunt forged top-secret U.S. State Department cables designed to prove that President Kennedy had personally and specifically ordered the assassination of South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother, Ngô Đình Nhu, during the 1963 South Vietnamese coup. He offered the forged documents to a &quot;Life&quot; magazine reporter. Hunt later told the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973 that he fabricated the cables to show a link between President Kennedy and the assassination of Diem, a Catholic, to estrange Catholic voters from the Democratic Party, after Colson suggested he &quot;might be able to improve upon the record.&quot;

In 1972, on Colson&#x27;s orders, Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy were part of an assassination plot targeting journalist Jack Anderson. Nixon disliked Anderson because Anderson published a 1960 election-eve story about a secret loan from Howard Hughes to Nixon&#x27;s brother, which Nixon believed was a factor in his election defeat to John F. Kennedy. Hunt and Liddy met with a CIA operative and discussed methods of assassinating Anderson, which included covering Anderson&#x27;s car steering wheel with LSD to drug him and cause a fatal accident, poisoning his aspirin bottle, and staging a fatal robbery. The assassination plot never materialized because Hunt and Liddy were arrested for their involvement in the Watergate scandal later that year.

====Watergate scandal====

Seymour Hersh reported in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that the Nixon White House tapes show that, following the assassination attempt on George Wallace on May 15, 1972, Nixon and Colson agreed to send Hunt to the Milwaukee home of the gunman, Arthur Bremer, to place McGovern presidential campaign material there. The intention was to link Bremer with the Democrats. Hersh wrote that, in a taped conversation:Nixon is energized and excited by what seems to be the ultimate political dirty trick: the FBI and the Milwaukee police will be convinced, and will tell the world, that the attempted assassination of Wallace had its roots in left-wing Democratic politics. Hunt did not make the trip, however, because the FBI moved quickly to seal Bremer&#x27;s apartment and place it under police guard.

In his memoir Hunt reports that the day after the assassination attempt he received a call from Chuck Colson, asking him to break into Bremer&#x27;s apartment and plant &quot;leftist literature to connect him to the Democrats&quot;. Hunt recalls that he was highly sceptical of the plan due to the apartment being guarded by the FBI but investigated the feasibility of it anyway due to Colson&#x27;s insistence.

Later that year, Hunt organized the bugging of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate complex office building. On June 18, 1972, five burglars were arrested by police at the Watergate. Hunt and Liddy were indicted on federal charges three months later.

Hunt put pressure on the White House and the Committee for the Re-Election of the President for cash payments to cover legal fees, family support, and expenses, for himself and his fellow burglars. Key Nixon figures, including Haldeman, Charles Colson, Herbert W. Kalmbach, John Mitchell, Fred LaRue, and John Dean eventually became entangled in the payoff schemes. Large sums of money were passed to Hunt and his accomplices in an attempt to secure their silence at the trial, by pleading guilty to avoid prosecutors&#x27; questions, and afterwards.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; later reported on the payoff scheme, publishing many articles that proved to be the beginning of the end for the cover-up since prosecutors felt obligated to follow up on the media reports. Hunt also pressured Colson, Dean, and John Ehrlichman to ask Nixon for clemency in sentencing, and eventual presidential pardons for himself and his Watergate break-in partners, which eventually helped implicate and snare those higher up.

Hunt was sentenced to 30 months to eight years in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal, and spent 33 months in prison at Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood and the low-security Federal Prison Camp at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on a conspiracy charge; he arrived at the Eglin Air Force Base prison on April 25, 1975. While at Allenwood, Hunt suffered a mild stroke.

==JFK conspiracy allegations==
Hunt supported the Warren Commission&#x27;s conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

===Three tramps===
Shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot;, and the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; photographed three transients under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository. The men were later known as the three tramps.

According to Vincent Bugliosi, allegations that these men were involved in a conspiracy originated from theorist Richard E. Sprague who compiled the photographs in 1966 and 1967, and subsequently turned them over to Jim Garrison during his investigation of Clay Shaw. Appearing before a nationwide audience on the December 31, 1968, episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Garrison held up a photo of the three and suggested they were involved in the assassination.

Several years later, in 1974, assassination researchers Alan J. Weberman and Michael Canfield compared photographs of the men to people they believed to be suspects involved in a conspiracy and said that two of the men were Hunt and fellow Watergate conspirator Frank Sturgis. In 1975, comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory helped bring national media attention to the allegations against Hunt and Sturgis after obtaining the comparison photographs from Weberman and Canfield. Immediately after obtaining the photographs, Gregory held a press conference that received considerable coverage, including in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

In 1975, the U.S. President&#x27;s Commission on CIA Activities within the United States, also known as the Rockefeller Commission, investigated the allegation that Hunt and Sturgis, on behalf of the CIA, participated in Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. The commission&#x27;s final report stated that witnesses testified that the derelicts bore a resemblance to Hunt or Sturgis &quot;were not shown to have any qualifications in photo identification beyond that possessed by an average layman&quot;. Their report also stated that FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, &quot;a nationally-recognized expert in photoidentification and photoanalysis&quot; with the FBI photographic laboratory, had concluded from photo comparison that none of the men was Hunt or Sturgis.

In 1979, the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had again analyzed and compared the photographs of the tramps with those of Hunt and Sturgis and also with photographs of Thomas Vallee, Daniel Carswell, and Fred Lee Chrisman. According to the committee, only Chrisman resembled any of the tramps, but determined that he was not in Dealey Plaza on the day of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination.

In 1992, journalist Mary La Fontaine discovered the November 22, 1963, arrest records that the Dallas Police Department had released in 1989, which named the three men as Gus W. Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John F. Gedney. According to the arrest reports, the three men were &quot;taken off a boxcar in the railroad yards right after President Kennedy was shot&quot;, detained as &quot;investigative prisoners&quot;, described as unemployed and passing through Dallas, then released four days later.

===&quot;Compulsive Spy&quot;===
In 1973, Viking Press published &quot;Compulsive Spy&quot;, a book about Hunt&#x27;s career, by Tad Szulc, a former correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Szulc wrote that unnamed CIA sources told him that Hunt, working with Rolando Cubela Secades, had a role in coordinating the assassination of Castro during an aborted second invasion of Cuba after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. Szulc wrote that Hunt was the acting chief of the CIA station in Mexico City in 1963 while Lee Harvey Oswald was also in Mexico City.

In June 1975, the Rockefeller Commission investigated allegations that the CIA, including Hunt, may have had contact with Oswald or Jack Ruby, concluding that one &quot;witness testified that E. Howard Hunt was Acting Chief of a CIA Station in Mexico City in 1963, implying that he &quot;could&quot; have had contact with Oswald when Oswald visited Mexico City in September 1963.&quot; The report concluded, however, that there was &quot;no credible evidence&quot; of CIA involvement in the assassination, reporting that, &quot;At no time was [Hunt] ever the Chief, or Acting Chief, of a CIA Station in Mexico City.

Released in the Fall of 1975 after the Rockefeller Commission&#x27;s report, Weberman and Canfield&#x27;s book &quot;Coup d&#x27;Etat in America&quot; reiterated Szulc&#x27;s allegation.

In July 1976, Hunt filed a $2.5 million libel suit against the authors and the book&#x27;s publishers and editor. According to Ellis Rubin, Hunt&#x27;s attorney who filed the suit in a Miami federal court, the book said that Hunt took part in the assassination of Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.

As part of his suit, Hunt filed a legal action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in September 1978 requesting that Szulc be cited for contempt if he refused to divulge his sources. Three months earlier, Szulc stated in a deposition that he refused to name his sources due to &quot;the professional confidentiality of sources&quot; and &quot;journalistic privilege&quot;. Rubin said that knowing the source of the allegation that Hunt was in Mexico City in 1963 was important because Szulc&#x27;s passage &quot;is what everybody uses as an authority ... he&#x27;s cited in everything written on E. Howard Hunt&quot;. He added that rumors that Hunt was involved in the Kennedy assassination might be put to end if Szulc&#x27;s source was revealed. Stating that Hunt had not provided a sufficient reason to override Szulc&#x27;s First Amendment rights to protect the confidentiality of his sources, Albert Vickers Bryan Jr., the U.S. District Court judge, ruled in favor of Szulc.

===Libel suit: Liberty Lobby and &quot;The Spotlight&quot;===
On November 3, 1978, Hunt gave a security-classified deposition for the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). He denied knowledge of any conspiracy to kill Kennedy. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) released the deposition in February 1996. Two newspaper articles published a few months before the deposition stated that a 1966 CIA memo linking Hunt to the assassination of President Kennedy had recently been provided to the HSCA. The first article, by Victor Marchetti – author of the book &quot;The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence&quot; (1974) – appeared in the Liberty Lobby newspaper &quot;The Spotlight&quot; on August 14, 1978.

According to Marchetti, the memo said in essence, &quot;Some day we will have to explain Hunt&#x27;s presence in Dallas on November 22, 1963.&quot; He also wrote that Hunt, Frank Sturgis and Gerry Patrick Hemming would soon be implicated in a conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy.

The second article, by Joseph J. Trento and Jacquie Powers, appeared six days later in the Sunday edition of &quot;The News Journal&quot;, Wilmington, Delaware. It alleged that the purported memo was initialed by Richard Helms and James Angleton and showed that, shortly after Helms and Angleton were elevated to their highest positions in the CIA, they discussed the fact that Hunt had been in Dallas on the day of the Kennedy assassination and that his presence there had to be kept secret. However, nobody has been able to produce this supposed memo, and the United States President&#x27;s Commission on CIA Activities within the United States determined that Hunt had been in Washington, D.C., on the day of the assassination.

Hunt sued Liberty Lobby – but not the &quot;Sunday News Journal&quot; – for libel. Liberty Lobby stipulated, in this first trial, that the question of Hunt&#x27;s alleged involvement in the assassination would not be contested. Hunt prevailed and was awarded $650,000 damages. In 1983, however, the case was overturned on appeal because of error in jury instructions.

In a second trial, held in 1985, Mark Lane made an issue of Hunt&#x27;s location on the day of the Kennedy assassination. Lane successfully defended Liberty Lobby by producing evidence suggesting that Hunt had been in Dallas. He used depositions from David Atlee Phillips, Richard Helms, Liddy, Stansfield Turner and Marita Lorenz, plus a cross-examination of Hunt. On retrial, the jury rendered a verdict for Liberty Lobby.

Lane claimed he convinced the jury that Hunt was a JFK assassination conspirator, but some of the jurors who were interviewed by the media said they disregarded the conspiracy theory and judged the case (according to the judge&#x27;s jury instructions) on whether the article was published with &quot;reckless disregard for the truth.&quot; Lane outlined his theory about Hunt&#x27;s and the CIA&#x27;s role in Kennedy&#x27;s murder in a 1991 book, &quot;Plausible Denial&quot;.

===Mitrokhin Archive===

Former KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin indicated in 1999 that Hunt was made part of a fabricated conspiracy theory disseminated by a Soviet &quot;active measures&quot; program designed to discredit the CIA and the United States. According to Mitrokhin, the KGB created a forged letter from Oswald to Hunt implying that the two were linked as conspirators, then forwarded copies of it to &quot;three of the most active conspiracy buffs&quot; in 1975. Mitrokhin indicated that the photocopies were accompanied by a fake cover letter from an anonymous source alleging that the original had been given to FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley and was apparently being suppressed.

=== Kerry Thornley&#x27;s memoir ===
According to Kerry Thornley, who served with Oswald in the Marine Corps and wrote the biographical book &quot;The Idle Warriors&quot; about him before the assassination of the president (the manuscript was seized during the investigation and was kept as physical evidence for a long time).

Thornley met regularly met with a man in New Orleans known to him as Gary Kirstein, with whom they discussed the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Also, according to Thornley, Kirstein in those years wanted to organize the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and planned to &quot;frame a jailbird for it.&quot; In &quot;Confession to Conspiracy to Assassinate JFK by Kerry Thornley as told to Sondra London&quot; he said that after Watergate, when photos of Howard Hunt appeared in the media, he found that he was very similar to his acquaintance Kirstein, along with whom they discussed organizing the assassination of the president.

===Deathbed confession of involvement in Kennedy assassination ===
After Hunt&#x27;s death, Howard St. John Hunt and David Hunt stated that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy. Notes and audio recordings were made.

In the April 5, 2007, issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, St. John Hunt detailed a number of individuals purported to be implicated by his father, including Lyndon B. Johnson, Cord Meyer, David Atlee Phillips, Frank Sturgis, David Morales, Antonio Veciana, William Harvey, and an assassin he termed &quot;French gunman grassy knoll&quot; who many presume is Lucien Sarti. The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs to avoid possible perjury charges. According to Hunt&#x27;s widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt&#x27;s loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain and furthermore falsified accounts of Hunt&#x27;s supposed confession. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said they examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be &quot;inconclusive&quot;.

==Memoir: &quot;American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate, and Beyond&quot;==
Hunt&#x27;s memoir, &quot;American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate, and Beyond&quot;, was ghost-written by Greg Aunapu and published by John Wiley &amp; Sons in March 2007.

According to the Hunt Literary Estate, Hunt had intended to write an update to his 1974 autobiography &quot;Undercover&quot; and supplement this edition with post-9/11 reflections, but by the time he had embarked on the project, he was too ill to continue. This prompted John Wiley &amp; Sons to search for and hire a ghost writer to write the book in its entirety. According to St. John Hunt, it was he who suggested to his father the idea of a memoir to reveal what he knew about the Kennedy assassination, but the Hunt Literary Estate disputes this as scurrilous.

The foreword to &quot;American Spy&quot; was written by William F. Buckley Jr. According to Buckley, he was asked through an intermediary to write the introduction but declined after he found that the manuscript contained material &quot;that suggested transgressions of the highest order, including a hint that LBJ might have had a hand in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy.&quot; He stated that the work &quot;was clearly ghostwritten&quot;, and eventually agreed to write an introduction focusing on his early friendship with Hunt after he received a revised manuscript &quot;with the loony grassy-knoll bits chiseled out&quot;.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called &quot;American Spy&quot; a &quot;breezy, unrepentant memoir&quot; and described it as a &quot;nostalgic memoir [that] breaks scant new ground in an already crowded field&quot;. Tim Rutten of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said it was &quot;a bitter and self-pitying memoir&quot; and &quot;offers a rather standard account of how men of his generation became involved in intelligence work&quot;.

Referencing the book&#x27;s title, Tim Weiner of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;American Spy&quot; is presented as a &#x27;secret history,&#x27; a double-barreled misrepresentation. There are no real secrets in this book. As history it is bunk.&quot; Weiner said that the author&#x27;s examination of the Kennedy assassination was the low-point of the book, indicating that Hunt pretended to take various conspiracy theories, including the involvement of former President Johnson, seriously. He concluded his review describing it as a work &quot;in a long tradition of arrant nonsense&quot; and &quot;a book to shun&quot;. Joseph C. Goulden of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; described it as a &quot;true mess of a book&quot; and dismissed Hunt&#x27;s allegations against Johnson as &quot;fantasy&quot;. Goulden summarized his review: &quot;I wish now that I had not read this pathetic book. Avoid it.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, Daniel Schorr said &quot;Hunt tells most of his Watergate venture fairly straight&quot;. Contrasting this opinion, Politico&#x27;s James Rosen described the chapters regarding Watergate as the &quot;[m]ost problematic&quot; and wrote: &quot;There are numerous factual errors – misspelled names, wrong dates, phantom participants in meetings, fictitious orders given – and the authors never substantively address, only pause occasionally to demean, the vast scholarly literature that has arisen in the last two decades to explain the central mystery of Watergate.&quot;

Rosen&#x27;s review was not entirely negative and he indicated that the book &quot;succeeds in taking readers beyond the caricatures and conspiracy theories to preserve the valuable memory of Hunt as he really was: passionate patriot; committed Cold Warrior; a lover of fine food, wine and women; incurable intriguer, wicked wit and superb storyteller.&quot; Dennis Lythgoe of &quot;Deseret News&quot; said &quot;[t]he writing style is awkward and often embarrassing&quot;, but that &quot;the book as a whole is a fascinating look into the mind of one of the major Watergate figures&quot;. In &quot;National Review&quot;, Mark Riebling praised &quot;American Spy&quot; as &quot;the only autobiography I know of that convincingly conveys what it was like to be an American spy.&quot;

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; writer Martin Nolan called it &quot;admirable and important&quot; and said that Hunt &quot;presents a livelier, tabloid version of the 1970s&quot;. According to Nolan: &quot;It is the best moment-by-moment depiction of the June 17, 1972, burglary of Democratic National Committee headquarters I have ever read.&quot;

Canadian journalist David Giammarco interviewed Hunt for the December 2000 issue of &quot;Cigar Aficionado&quot; magazine. Hunt later wrote the foreword to Giammarco&#x27;s book &quot;For Your Eyes Only: Behind the Scenes of the James Bond Films&quot; (ECW Press, 2002).

Hunt was portrayed by Ed Harris in the 1995 biopic &quot;Nixon&quot;. In the 2019 film &quot;The Irishman&quot;, Hunt is portrayed by stage actor Daniel Jenkins. In the 2022 series &quot;Gaslit&quot;, Hunt is portrayed by J. C. MacKenzie. In the 2023 HBO miniseries &quot;White House Plumbers&quot;, Hunt is played by Woody Harrelson.

A fictionalized account of Hunt&#x27;s role in the Bay of Pigs operation appears in Norman Mailer&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;Harlot&#x27;s Ghost&quot;.

On the television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, the antagonist known as Cigarette Smoking Man (portrayed by William B. Davis) was a shadowy intelligence operative partly modeled on Hunt. The episode &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;, fleshed out the character&#x27;s backstory as unsuccessful author of mystery/suspense fiction in his spare time. When meeting Lee Harvey Oswald, prior to the JFK assassination, he goes by the alias &#x27;Mr. Hunt.&#x27;

==Personal life==
===Marriage to Dorothy Wetzel===
Hunt&#x27;s first wife, Dorothy Louise (née Wetzel) Day Goutiere, was born on April 1, 1920, in Dayton, Ohio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saint John/Dorothy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Wetzel was a CIA employee in Shanghai, and later served as secretary&lt;ref name=&quot;Behrman/Marshall-Plan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to W. Averell Harriman in Paris during the Marshall Plan. Hunt and Wetzel had four children, including two daughters, Lisa and Kevan, and two sons, St. John and David.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saint John/Howard&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy Hunt was killed in the December 8, 1972,&lt;ref name=&quot;slate/WATERGATE/6/Transcript&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; crash of United Airlines Flight 553 in Chicago. Congress, the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the crash, and concluded that the crash was caused by accidental crew error.

Some sources have suggested and stated that &quot;much more than&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoenix/Oglesby/Dorothy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; $10,000 in cash was found in Dorothy Hunt&#x27;s handbag in the wreckage.

===Marriage to Laura Martin===
Hunt later married teacher Laura Martin, with whom he raised two more children, Austin and Hollis. Following his release from prison, he and Laura moved to Guadalajara, Mexico, where they lived for five years before returning to the United States, where they settled in Miami.

== Death ==

On January 23, 2007, Hunt died of pneumonia in Miami, at age 88. He is buried in Prospect Lawn Cemetery in his hometown of Hamburg, New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews/e-howard-hunt-dies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>The is a Japanese poem. Originally the poem was attributed to Kūkai, the founder of Shingon Buddhism, but more modern research has found the date of composition to be later in the Heian period (794–1179). The first record of its existence dates from 1079. It is famous because it is a perfect pangram, containing each character of the Japanese syllabary exactly once. Because of this, it is also used as an ordering for the syllabary, in the same way as the &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;... sequence of the Latin alphabet.

==Text==
The first appearance of the Iroha, in was in seven lines: six with seven morae each, and one with five. It was also written in man&#x27;yōgana.
&lt;poem&gt;
以呂波耳本部止
千利奴流乎和加
餘多連曽津祢那
良牟有為能於久
耶万計不己衣天
阿佐伎喩女美之
恵比毛勢須
&lt;/poem&gt;

Structurally, however, the poem follows the standard 7–5 pattern of Japanese poetry (with one hypometric line), and in modern times it is generally written that way, in contexts where line breaks are used. The text of the poem in hiragana (with archaic and but without voiced consonant marks) is:

Note that:
*Archaic, obsolete, and historical hiragana uses (historic Japanese &quot;wi&quot;, modern &quot;i&quot;) and (historic Japanese &quot;we&quot;, modern &quot;e&quot;), which are now only used in proper names and certain Okinawan orthographies. Modern writing uses voiced consonant marks (with dakuten). This is used as an indicator of sound changes in the spoken Japanese language in the Heian era.
*The consonant in Japanese (a voiceless glottal fricative) was historically pronounced as (a voiceless bilabial fricative) before the occurrence of the so-called &quot;hagyō tenko&quot; (“&#x27;H&#x27;-row (kana) sound shift”, ). Due to phonological changes over history, the pangram poem no longer matches today&#x27;s pronunciation of modern kana.
*The mora e (spelt &amp; ) and ye had merged into in the 10th century, slightly before the poem was written down in 1079.
* Note 1: The verb form (&quot;being intoxicated; intoxication&quot;) may be read in modern kana pronunciation as either &quot;ei&quot;, the archaic pronunciation based on the original kana spelling (&quot;wefi&quot; in Classical Japanese), or as &quot;yoi&quot;, the modern reading after sound changes caused the base verb form &quot;eu&quot; to shift to &quot;you&quot;. The difference in reading depends on the intention of the rendering: keeping closer to the original, or keeping closer to modern usage.

An English translation by Professor Ryuichi Abe reads as:

Komatsu Hideo has revealed that the last mora of each line of the Man&#x27;yō-gana original (), when put together, reveals a hidden sentence, &quot;toka [=toga] nakute shisu&quot; (), which means &quot;to die without wrong-doing&quot;. It is thought that this might be a eulogy in praise of Kūkai, further supporting the notion that the Iroha was written after Kūkai&#x27;s death.

==Usage==
The Iroha contains every kana only once, with the exception of (-&quot;n&quot;), which was not distinguished from &quot;mu&quot; in writing until the early 20th century (see Japanese script reform). For this reason, the poem was frequently used as an ordering of the kana until the Meiji era reforms in the 19th century. Around 1890, with the publication of the &quot;Wakun no Shiori&quot; () and &quot;Genkai&quot; () dictionaries, the &quot;gojūon&quot; (, literally &quot;fifty sounds&quot;) ordering system, which is based on Sanskrit, became more common. It begins with &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;o&quot; then &quot;ka&quot;, &quot;ki&quot;, &quot;ku&quot;... and so on for each kana used in Japanese. Although the earliest known copy of the &quot;gojūon&quot; predated the Iroha, &quot;gojūon&quot; was considered too scholarly and had not been widely used.

Even after widespread use of &quot;gojūon&quot; in education and dictionaries, the &quot;Iroha&quot; sequence was commonly used as a system of showing order, similarly to &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;... in English. For example, Imperial Japanese Navy submarines during the Second World War had official designations beginning with &quot;I&quot; (displacement 1,000 tonnes or more), &quot;Ro&quot; (500 to 999 tonnes), and &quot;Ha&quot; (less than 500 tonnes). Also, Japanese tanks had official designations partly using &quot;Iroha&quot; ordering, such as &quot;Chi-ha&quot; (&quot;ha&quot; meaning the third model). Other examples include subsection ordering in documents, seat numbering in theaters, and showing go moves in diagrams (kifu).

===Current uses===
The &quot;Iroha&quot; sequence is still used today in many areas with long traditions. Most notably, Japanese laws and regulations officially use &quot;Iroha&quot; for lower-level subsection ordering purposes, for example (Article 49, Section 2, Subsection 1-&quot;ro&quot;). In official translation to English, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ro&quot;, &quot;ha&quot;... are replaced by &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;... as in &quot;49(2)(i)(b)&quot;.

In music, the notes of an octave are named &quot;i ro ha ni ho he to&quot;, written in katakana.
&quot;Iroha&quot; is also used in numbering the classes of the conventional train cars of Japanese National Railways (now known as JR). &quot;I&quot; is first class (no longer used), &quot;Ro&quot; is second class (now &quot;Green car&quot;) and &quot;Ha&quot; is third class (standard carriages).

Some Japanese expressions are only understandable when one has knowledge of the &quot;Iroha&quot;. The word &quot;iroha&quot; (, often in katakana) itself can mean &quot;the basics&quot; in Japanese, comparable to the term &quot;the ABCs&quot; in English. Similarly, &quot;Iroha no i&quot; () means &quot;the most basic element of all&quot;. &quot;I no ichiban&quot; (, &quot;number one of &quot;i&quot;&quot;) means &quot;the very first&quot;.

&quot;Iroha karuta&quot;, a traditional card game, is still sold as an educational toy.

&quot;Irohazaka&quot; (), a one-way switchback mountain road in Nikkō, Tochigi, is named for the poem because it has 48 corners. The route was popular with Buddhist pilgrims on their way to Lake Chūzenji, which is at the top of the forested hill that this road climbs. While the narrow road has been modernized over the years, care has been taken to keep the number of curves constant.

== Origin ==
Authorship is traditionally ascribed to the Heian era Japanese Buddhist priest and scholar Kūkai () (774–835). However, this is unlikely as it is believed that in his time there were separate &quot;e&quot; sounds in the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;ya&quot; columns of the kana table. The (&quot;e&quot;) above would have been pronounced &quot;ye&quot;, making the pangram incomplete.

It is said that the &quot;Iroha&quot; is a transformation of these verses in the &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
諸行無常
是生滅法
生滅滅已
寂滅為楽
&lt;/poem&gt;

which translates into

The above in Japanese is read

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Shogyō mujō&quot;
&quot;Zeshō meppō&quot;
&quot;Shōmetsu metsui&quot;
&quot;Jakumetsu iraku&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Luis de Torres (died 1493) was Christopher Columbus&#x27;s interpreter on his first voyage to America.

De Torres was a converso, a Jewish person who was forced to convert to Christianity or be put to death according to the Spanish Inquisition, apparently born Yosef ben HaLevi HaIvri in Moguer, Spain. De Torres was chosen by Columbus for his knowledge of Hebrew, Chaldaic, and Arabic. After arriving at Cuba, which he supposed to be the Asian coast, Columbus sent de Torres and the sailor Rodrigo de Jerez on an expedition inland on November 2, 1492. Their task was to explore the country, contact its ruler, and gather information about the Asian emperor described by Marco Polo as the &quot;Great Khan&quot;. The two men were received with great honors in a village, and returned four days later. They reported on the native custom of drying leaves, inserting them in cane pipes, burning them, and inhaling the smoke: a reference to the use of tobacco.

When Columbus set off for Spain on January 4, 1493, Luis de Torres was among the 39 men who stayed behind at the settlement of La Navidad founded on the island of Hispaniola. Coming back by the end of that year, Columbus learnt that the whole garrison had been wiped out by internal strife and by attack.

From 1972 to 2021, a synagogue in The Bahamas existed that was named after De Torres, known as the Luis de Torres Synagogue. The synagogue was named after him due to his involvement in the discovery of the New World.

<text>Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan (; born 27 December 1965) is an Indian actor, film producer, and television personality who predominantly works in Hindi films. In a career spanning over three decades, Khan&#x27;s awards, include two National Film Awards as a film producer, and two Filmfare Awards as an actor. He is cited in the media as one of the most commercially successful actors of Indian cinema. &quot;Forbes&quot; has included Khan in listings of the highest-paid celebrities in the world, in 2015 and 2018, with him being the highest-ranked Indian in the latter year. Khan has starred in the annual highest-grossing Hindi film of 10 individual years, the highest for any actor.

He began his acting career with a supporting role in &quot;Biwi Ho To Aisi&quot; (1988), followed by his breakthrough with a leading role in Sooraj Barjatya&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Maine Pyar Kiya&quot; (1989), for which he was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He established himself with several commercially successful films, including Barjatya&#x27;s family dramas &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994) and &quot;Hum Saath-Saath Hain&quot; (1999), the action film &quot;Karan Arjun&quot; (1995) and the comedy &quot;Biwi No.1&quot; (1999). After a period of fluctuations, Khan resurrected his screen image with the action film &quot;Wanted&quot; (2009), and achieved greater stardom by starring in the top-grossing action films &quot;Dabangg&quot; (2010), &quot;Ready&quot; (2011), &quot;Bodyguard&quot; (2011), &quot;Ek Tha Tiger&quot; (2012), &quot;Dabangg 2&quot; (2012), &quot;Kick&quot; (2014), and &quot;Tiger Zinda Hai&quot; (2017), and the dramas &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot; (2015) and &quot;Sultan&quot; (2016). This was followed by a series of poorly-received films, with the exception of the sequel &quot;Tiger 3&quot; (2023).

In addition to his acting career, Khan is a television presenter and promotes humanitarian causes through his charity, Being Human Foundation. He has been hosting the reality show &quot;Bigg Boss&quot; since 2010. Khan&#x27;s off-screen life is marred by controversy and legal troubles. In 2015, he was convicted of culpable homicide for a negligent driving case in which he ran over five people with his car, killing one, but his conviction was set aside on appeal. On 5 April 2018, Khan was convicted in a blackbuck poaching case and sentenced to five years imprisonment. He is currently out on bail while an appeal is being heard.

== Early life and ancestry ==

Salman Khan is the second eldest son of screenwriter Salim Khan and his first wife Sushila Charak, who adopted the name Salma. Born to a Muslim father and Hindu mother on 27 December 1965, Salman Khan was brought up in both faiths. In 1981, when Salim married the actress Helen, the children&#x27;s relationship with their father grew hostile and only recovered years later.

Salman Khan&#x27;s paternal great-grandparents are believed to be Alakozai Pashtuns from Afghanistan who immigrated to Indore State, Indore Residency (now in Madhya Pradesh), British India in the mid-1800s; however, Jasim Khan in his biography of the actor states that his ancestors belonged to the Akuzai sub-tribe of the Yusufzai Pashtuns from Malakand in the Swat Valley of North-West Frontier Province, British India (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan). His grandfather Abdul Rashid Khan was a Deputy Inspector General of the Indore state who was awarded the Diler Jung award of the Holkar times. Khan&#x27;s mother is a homemaker, whose father Baldev Singh Charak, a Dogra Rajput, comes from Jammu in Jammu and Kashmir and whose Maratha mother comes from Maharashtra. Khan can also speak Marathi, in addition to Hindi and English. He has two brothers, Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan; and two sisters, Alvira Khan Agnihotri, who is married to actor-director Atul Agnihotri, and an adopted sister Arpita, who is married to actor Aayush Sharma.

Salman finished his schooling at St. Stanislaus High School in Bandra, Mumbai, as did his younger brothers Arbaaz and Sohail. Previously, he studied at The Scindia School in Gwalior for a few years along with his younger brother Arbaaz. He attended St. Xavier&#x27;s College in Mumbai but dropped out.

== Career ==

=== 1988–1993: Debut, breakthrough and setback ===

Salman Khan made his on-screen debut in 1988 with a supporting role in the successful film &quot;Biwi Ho To Aisi&quot;, which had Rekha in the lead role. The following year, he played the main lead in Sooraj Barjatya&#x27;s romantic musical &quot;Maine Pyar Kiya&quot; opposite Bhagyashree. The film backed up with chartbuster music went on to become an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; at the box office and made Khan a star. It also won him Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. 

He began the new decade with Deepak Shivdasani&#x27;s action drama film &quot;Baaghi: A Rebel for Love&quot; (1990), which he also wrote. &quot;Baaghi&quot; opened to positive critical reception and was a box office hit. Khan&#x27;s dream run continued in 1991 with two of his films, &quot;Sanam Bewafa&quot; and &quot;Saajan&quot; emerging blockbusters and their soundtracks proving to be two of the best-selling Hindi film albums of that year. His other releases of the year, &quot;Kurbaan&quot; and &quot;Patthar Ke Phool&quot; also performed well commercially and proved to be major commercial successes. Khan followed it with a downturn as all of his films for the next two years, including biggies &quot;Jaagruti&quot; (1992) and &quot;Chandra Mukhi&quot; (1993) were critical and commercial failures. 

=== 1994–1999: Established actor ===
In 1994, Khan appeared in Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s , co-starring Aamir Khan. At the time of its release, the film failed at the box office but has gained a cult status over the years. Later in the year he collaborated with director Sooraj Barjatya in the romance &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; co-starring Madhuri Dixit. During the 1995 awards season, the film won 3 Filmfare Awards for Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress. It also won the National Award for being the most popular film of the year. Earning more than () worldwide, the film became the biggest Bollywood hit of the year and the highest-grossing Indian film up until then. It is one of the films on Box Office India&#x27;s list of &quot;Biggest Blockbusters Ever in Hindi Cinema&quot;. In 2006, it was still the fourth-highest grossing Bollywood film ever, according to Box Office India. In 1995 he starred in Rakesh Roshan&#x27;s &quot;Karan Arjun&quot; alongside Shah Rukh Khan. The two played brothers who are reincarnated after being killed by family enemies. His role as Karan earned him a nomination for the 1995 Filmfare Best Actor Award.

In 1996, Khan performed in Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#x27;s directional debut &quot;&quot;. He also appeared in and Raj Kanwar&#x27;s action hit &quot;Jeet&quot;. He had two releases in 1997: &quot;Judwaa&quot; and &quot;Auzaar&quot;. The former was a comedy directed by David Dhawan where he played a dual role of twins separated at birth.

Khan worked in five different films in 1998, his first release being the romantic comedy film &quot;Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot; opposite Kajol, one of the biggest commercial successes of that year. This was followed by the moderately successful drama &quot;Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai&quot; where Khan played a young man who has to take a child who claims to be his son, under his custody. Khan&#x27;s performance in the film earned favourable critical review. He also had an extended cameo in Karan Johar&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;, which earned him critical acclaim and a second Filmfare Award under the Best Supporting Actor category.

In 1999, Khan starred in three films: &quot;Hum Saath-Saath Hain&quot;, &quot;Biwi No.1&quot;, and &quot;Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam&quot; alongside Aishwarya Rai and Ajay Devgan, which earned him another Best Actor nomination at the Filmfare awards. His performance in the film was reviewed favourably, with Sharmila Telikum of Rediff noting, &quot;Salman is endearing. He does tend to ham in the dramatic scenes, but looks very comfortable doing comedy and those romantic scenes.&quot;

=== 2000–2009: Sporadic success ===

In 2001, Khan appeared in &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot;, which addressed the issue of surrogate childbirth. In it, Khan played the role of a rich industrialist who hires a surrogate mother after his wife becomes infertile. Sukanya Verma of Reddit wrote that the film had an absurd storyline, but also spontaneous performances from the cast, helping to minimise its other flaws. In 2002, he starred in &quot;Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam&quot;.

For &quot;Tere Naam&quot; (2003), Taran Adarsh said of him, &quot;Salman Khan is exceptional in a role that fits him to the T. He breathes fire in sequences that demand uneasiness. But beneath the tough exterior lies a vulnerable person and this facet in particular comes to the fore in the latter reels. His emotional outbursts are splendid...&quot; Director Satish Kaushik considered Khan&#x27;s work in the film to be strong, saying of it, &quot;Salman has given a great performance in the film. He&#x27;s given an intense, unconventional performance. I believe this is the best performance of Salman&quot;s career so far.&quot; His career progressed with comedies like &quot;Mujhse Shaadi Karogi&quot; (2004) and &quot;No Entry&quot; (2005).
Khan started 2007 with the ensemble film &quot;Salaam-e-Ishq&quot;. He appeared in the Hollywood movie, &quot;Marigold&quot; opposite American actress Ali Larter. The film told the love story of an Indian man and an American woman.

Khan hosted the second season of the game show &quot;10 Ka Dum&quot; during 2009. According to a 2008 report from Biz Asia UK, the show earned enough target rating points (TRPs) for Sony Entertainment Television to regain its third position in the Indian television ratings.

He appeared in &quot;Wanted&quot; (a remake of 2006 Telugu super hit film Pokiri), directed by choreographer turned director Prabhu Deva. The film received mixed reviews. Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama rated it 4 of 5 stars noting, &quot;&quot;WANTED&quot; rides on Salman Khan&#x27;s star power. He may not be the best actor in town, but in a film like &quot;WANTED&quot;, in a role that seems like an extension of his personality, you can&#x27;t think of anyone else enacting this role with flourish.&quot; Raja Sen from Rediff gave a rating of 2/5 and said, &quot;The writing is both amateurish and crass, while the songs are plain hideous...Khan might be having fun, but the fact a film like &quot;Wanted&quot; underscores is how badly Bollywood needs a breed of younger leading men. And how the existing lot need roles that fit.&quot; He appeared in two other films that year, &quot;Main Aurr Mrs Khanna&quot; and &quot;London Dreams&quot;.

=== 2010–2017: Superstardom ===
Khan&#x27;s first release of 2010 was Anil Sharma&#x27;s film &quot;Veer&quot;. In his second release of 2010, &quot;Dabangg&quot;, Khan played the role of a fearless cop with comic effect in the film. The film was noted by the Economic Times as being remarkable for its commercial success, despite having an &quot;accent on inanity...&quot; and &quot;...complete incoherence in terms of plot and credibility.&quot; The Times also noted industry experts attributed the popularity of the film to Khan&#x27;s presence, stating that they &quot;ascribe its allure to the star charisma of Salman Khan, who has managed to carry off the over-the-top articulation of Chulbul Pandey with unbridled enthusiasm and zeal.&quot;

&quot;Dabangg&quot; won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. It was later remade in Tamil and Telugu. The film was produced by his brother Arbaaz Khan. It was reported by the Hindustan Times that the film opened to full houses across the country. Khan received a Star Screen Award for Best Actor and a Stardust Award for Star of the Year – Male for his performance. He was also nominated for his sixth Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Anupama Chopra from NDTV wrote about his performance: &quot;It&#x27;s the role of a lifetime and Salman Khan bites into it like a starving man devours a feast. He inhabits it fully, strutting and swaggering and even, spoofing himself.&quot;

Khan&#x27;s first release of 2011 was &quot;Ready&quot; (a remake of the 2008 Telugu film of the same name). &quot;Ready&quot; held a record for being the second highest grossing Bollywood film of 2011. He next appeared in &quot;Bodyguard&quot;, a remake of the 2010 Malayalam film of the same name. The film was not well received by critics, though it became India&#x27;s highest-earning film of the year.
Khan&#x27;s first release of 2012 was &quot;Ek Tha Tiger&quot; where he starred opposite Katrina Kaif and acted as an Indian spy. The film garnered positive reactions from critics while opening to extremely strong box office collections. The film marks his first association with Yash Raj Films.

Khan starred in &quot;Dabangg 2&quot;, the sequel of &quot;Dabangg&quot;, in 2012 under the production of Arbaaz Khan. &quot;Dabangg 2&quot; eventually emerged as a huge financial success with revenues of globally.

After a one-year gap, Khan&#x27;s first release of 2014 was &quot;Jai Ho&quot; (an official remake of the 2006 Telugu film Stalin), which he starred in opposite Daisy Shah. His second release, &quot;Kick&quot;, a remake of a Telugu film has entered the Rs. 2 billion club in India on Eid. He also sang the &quot;Hangover&quot; song from the movie.

Khan&#x27;s first film of 2015, &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot;, which was released on Eid, received acclaim from critics and the public and broke several box office records upon release. The film, grossing on its first week beat the previous record of &quot;PK&quot;. This was Khan&#x27;s first and the second Bollywood film after &quot;PK&quot; to enter the 300 club. The film became the second highest-grossing Bollywood film in India and worldwide at that time, with a collection of over 6 billion. Bajrangi Bhaijaan crossed 300 crore within 20 days of its release and became the second highest grosser to date in India, while his second film, &quot;Prem Ratan Dhan Payo&quot;, a Diwali release received mixed reviews from critics and the public and broke several box office records upon release. The film became the ninth consecutive film of Salman Khan to gross over 1 billion. The film grossed ₹1.73 billion (US$27 million) on its first week. By 25 November, the film collected ₹2.01 billion. With this, Khan become the only actor to give three back-to-back movies which collected more than net domestically. He became the only actor to collect over domestic net in a single year in India.

Khan&#x27;s first film of 2016, yet again another Eid release, &quot;Sultan&quot;, directed by Ali Abbas Zafar for Yash Raj Films received positive reviews from both critics and the public breaking several box office records.

In June 2017, Khan appeared in &quot;Tubelight&quot;, his third collaboration with Kabir Khan after &quot;Ek Tha Tiger&quot; and &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot;. This film also starred Khan&#x27;s real-life brother Sohail Khan. Despite its high expectations, the film failed to do well at the box office. Khan&#x27;s second release of 2017 &quot;Tiger Zinda Hai&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Ek Tha Tiger&quot; grossed 190crore worldwide in its opening weekend. As of 23 January 2018, the film has grossed worldwide, including in India and overseas.

=== 2018–present: Career fluctuations ===
In 2018, Khan played the leading role in his only release of the year, &quot;Race 3&quot;, an action film. The film had an ensemble cast including Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Jacqueline Fernandez and others. The film was critically panned for its storyline, weak performances and climax. Box Office India declared it an &quot;average&quot; grosser. Khan starred in &quot;Bharat&quot; that was released on 5 June 2019 and &quot;Dabangg 3&quot; that was released on 20 December 2019. &quot;Bharat&quot; was a moderate hit whereas &quot;Dabangg 3&quot; flopped commercially.

=== Business ===
The renowned Bollywood actor, made a significant investment in the property sector in 2012 when he purchased a commercial property on Linking Road for approximately 120 Crore Indian rupee. In 2017, the property gained prominence as it became the location for Future Retail&#x27;s Food Hall, which was owned by Kishore Biyani&#x27;s Future Group. An agreement was struck for a monthly rental of 80 Lakh Indian Rupees over a five-year period. However, due to non-payment of dues, a legal dispute arose, ultimately resulting in a ruling by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in favour of Salman Khan. Fast forward to 2023, and the property has found new occupants in the form of Food Square, a luxury gourmet retail brand owned by LandCraft Retail Private Limited. The co-founders of Food Square, Lalit Jhawar and Mayank Gupta, successfully secured $3.6 million in funding from notable investors, including Masaba Gupta, Mukul Agrawal, Purple Style Labs, Sanket Parekh (from the Pidilite Family), Rahul Kayan (SMIFS), and Harminder Sahni. Food Square now rents out the Salman Khan-owned property for a monthly fee of 1 Crore Indian Rupees, marking a new chapter in the property&#x27;s history.

== Philanthropy and service ==

Khan has been involved in several charities during his career. He has started an NGO called &quot;Being Human&quot; which sells T-shirts and other products online and in stores. A portion of the revenues go to a worthy cause supporting the underprivileged. Being Human Foundation is a registered charitable trust set up by Khan to help the underprivileged. In its early days, Khan set up and funded the Foundation using his own money. The Foundation has two focus areas: education and healthcare. To increase the reach and corpus of the Foundation, Salman Khan has undertaken initiatives such as Being Human Art, Being Human merchandise and Being Human Gitanjali Gold Coins.

In 2011, he launched his own production company called SKBH Productions (Salman Khan Being Human Productions). Money which will be generated from film productions will be donated to &quot;Being Human&quot;. The first film made under the banner was the kids&#x27; entertainer &quot;Chillar Party&quot;, which went on to win 3 National Awards for Best Children&#x27;s film, Best Original Screenplay and Child Artist&#x27;s Award.

In January 2012, Khan offered to pay to release about 400 prisoners from about 63 prisons in the state of Uttar Pradesh via his NGO. The prisoners had completed their terms, but due to economic reasons, they were unable to pay legal fines for their charges.

In July 2015, Khan offered to donate the profits of his most successful film &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot; to poor farmers all over India. The film&#x27;s producers Khan and Rockline Venkatesh both have mutually decided to donate the profits of their film to them. The film&#x27;s director Kabir Khan and Salman&#x27;s sister Alvira Agnihotri met Maharashtra&#x27;s Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse to discuss the same.

Khan met with his 11-year-old fan from Pakistan, &quot;Abdul Basit&quot; who had severe jaundice at the time of his birth; he was diagnosed to have Crigler Najjar syndrome and was admitted to the Apollo Hospital, Delhi. The youngster wished to meet the &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot; star Khan.

== Controversies ==

=== Hit-and-run case ===
On 28 September 2002, Khan was arrested for rash and negligent driving after his car ran into a bakery in Mumbai; one person who was sleeping on the pavement outside the bakery died and three others were injured in the accident. Charges of culpable homicide were laid against him, but later dropped. On 24 July 2013, he was formally charged with culpable homicide in the case, to which he pleaded not guilty.

On 6 May 2015, Khan was found guilty of all charges in the case. The Bombay Sessions Court concluded that Khan was driving the car under the influence of alcohol, causing the death of one and serious injury to four homeless persons. An RTO officer confirmed that Khan did not have a driving licence until 2004. Sessions Judge DW Deshpande convicted the actor for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentenced him to five years in prison. Later in the same day, Khan, being represented by Senior Counsel Amit Desai was granted bail by the Bombay High Court till 8 May 2015, on which the court suspended his prison sentence until the final appeal hearing in July. His driver Ashok Singh, who had given the testimony that it was himself who was driving the car at the time of accident, was charged with perjury for misguiding the Court with false testimony and was arrested. The prime witness, police constable Ravindra Patil went missing multiple times and eventually died in a hospital due to tuberculosis. In December 2015, Khan was acquitted of all charges from this case due to lack of evidence. The Supreme Court on Tuesday 5 July 2016 admitted a plea by the Maharashtra government that challenged the acquittal of Salman Khan in this hit-and-run case by the Bombay High Court. The court refused to fast-track the case.

=== Relationship with Aishwarya Rai ===
His relationship with actress Aishwarya Rai was a well publicised topic in the Indian media. After their break-up in March 2002, Rai accused him of harassing her. She claimed that Khan had not been able to come to terms with their break-up and was hounding her; her parents lodged a complaint against him. In 2003, Vivek Oberoi, Rai&#x27;s then boyfriend, claimed that Khan had threatened him. In 2005, news outlets released what was said to be an illicit copy of a mobile phone call recorded in 2001 by the Mumbai police. It appeared to be a call in which he threatened Rai, in an effort to force her to appear at social events held by Mumbai crime figures. The call featured boasts of connections to organised crime and derogatory comments about other actors. However, the alleged tape was tested in the government&#x27;s Forensic lab in Chandigarh, which concluded that it was fake.

=== Blackbuck hunting and Arms Act violations cases ===

The 1998 blackbuck poaching case involves the alleged killing of a deer when Khan and his co-starsSaif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Neelam and Tabuwere filming the movie &quot;Hum Saath-Saath Hain&quot; in the forests near Jodhpur in 1998. In 2007, Salman spent a week in Jodhpur jail before the court granted him bail. In addition to the accusations of poaching of endangered antelopes under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, a case under sections 3/25 and 3/27 of the Arms Act was filed against Khan for allegedly keeping and using firearms with an expired licence.

On 17 February 2006, Khan was sentenced to one year in prison for hunting Chinkara, an endangered species. The sentence was stayed by a higher court on appeal.

On 10 April 2006, Khan was handed a five-year jail term and remanded to Jodhpur jail until 13 April when he was granted bail. On 24 July 2012, Rajasthan High Court finalised charges against Khan and his other colleagues in the endangered blackbuck killing case, paving way for the start of the trial. On 9 July 2014, the Supreme Court issued a notice to Khan on Rajasthan government&#x27;s plea challenging the High Court order suspending his conviction. Khan was acquitted in the blackbuck and chinkara poaching cases by the Rajasthan High Court on 24 July 2016.

On 18 October 2016 the Rajasthan Government decided to approach the Supreme Court to challenge Khan&#x27;s acquittal in two related cases.

On 18 January 2017 Khan was acquitted by a Jodhpur court in an Arms Act case linked to the killing of a blackbuck in Rajasthan. Khan pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot; to charges of violating the law by keeping unlicensed weapons and using them. Acquitting the actor, the court said that the prosecution failed to submit enough evidence against him.

On 5 April 2018, Jodhpur court convicted Khan in the blackbuck poaching case and sentenced him to five years imprisonment while acquitting Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Neelam, and Tabu.

Khan was released on bail on 7 April 2018, pending appeal.

On 14 April 2024, two members of the Bishnoi Gang, who belong a religious sect that considers the blackbuck sacred, opened fire on Khan&#x27;s apartment in Bandra, Mumbai before fleeing on a motorcycle. Khan, who was inside along with several relatives, was unharmed. The gunmen were later arrested in Gujarat. The gang had previously threatened Khan over the hunting incident. Police said that the attack was masterminded by Amnol Bishnoi, the younger brother of the gang&#x27;s leader Lawrence Bishnoi.

=== Remarks about 26/11 attacks ===
In September 2010, Khan was reported to have claimed during an interview on a Pakistani channel that the 26/11 attacks got a lot of attention because the &quot;elite&quot; were targeted. During the interview the actor had said: &quot;It was the elite that was targeted this time. Five star hotels and stuff. So they panicked. Then they got up and spoke about it. My question is &quot;why not before?&quot; Attacks have happened in trains and small towns too, but no one talked about it so much.&quot; Khan also said that Pakistan was not to be blamed for it, and that the Indian security had failed. Khan&#x27;s comments had drawn strong reactions from Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra Chagan Bhujbal, Shiv Sena, BJP and other political parties. The comments were also condemned by Ujwal Nikam, Special Prosecutor in the 26/11 trial. Khan later apologised for his comments.

=== Tweets on Yakub Memon ===
On 25 July 2015, Khan made a number of tweets from his Twitter account in support of the 1993 Bombay bombings, accused Yakub Memon. Memon was scheduled to be executed, before which Khan made his tweets. Khan said that Yakub&#x27;s brother, Tiger Memon should be hanged instead. He also asked the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif to confirm &quot;whether the mob boss is in his country.&quot; The tweets sparked protests outside his house where police had to be deployed and were criticised in the social media and by his father, Salim Khan. Following these incidents, Khan withdrew his tweets and apologised.

=== Interference in Jiah Khan suicide case ===
Following the death of Sushant Singh Rajput by hanging, the late actress Jiah Khan&#x27;s mother, Rabia Amin, revealed that Salman Khan had attempted to influence the case, where accusations for abetment of suicide were charged against actor Sooraj Pancholi. A CBI officer who was investigating the case had told Rabia Amin that Salman Khan called him every day, asking him not to harass or touch Sooraj Pancholi, as a lot of money was invested in him.

<text>Lapulapu (fl. 1521) or Lapu-Lapu, whose name was first recorded as Çilapulapu, was a datu (chief) of Mactan, an island now part of the Philippines. Lapulapu is known for the 1521 Battle of Mactan, where he and his men defeated Spanish forces led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and his native allies Rajah Humabon and Datu Zula. Magellan&#x27;s death in battle ended his voyage of circumnavigation and delayed the Spanish occupation of the islands by over forty years until the expedition of Miguel López de Legazpi which reached the archipelago in 1565.

Modern Philippine society regards him as the first Filipino hero because of his resistance to Spanish colonization. Monuments of Lapulapu have been built all over the Philippines to honor Lapulapu&#x27;s bravery against the Spaniards. The Philippine National Police and the Bureau of Fire Protection use his image as part of their official seals.

Besides being a rival of Rajah Humabon of neighboring Cebu, very little is reliably known about the life of Lapulapu. The only existing primary source mentioning him by name is the account of Antonio Pigafetta, and according to historian Resil B. Mojares, no European who left a primary record of Magellan&#x27;s voyage/vessel &quot;knew what he looked like, heard him speak (his recorded words of defiance and pride are all indirect), or mentioned that he was present in the battle of Mactan that made him famous.&quot; His name, origins, religion, and fate are still a matter of controversy.

==Name==
The earliest record of his name comes from Italian diarist Antonio Pigafetta who accompanied Magellan&#x27;s expedition. Pigafetta noted the names of two chiefs of the island of &quot;Matan&quot; (Mactan), the chiefs &quot;Zula&quot; and &quot;Çilapulapu&quot;. Pigafetta&#x27;s account of Magellan&#x27;s voyage, which contains the only mention of Lapulapu by name in an undisputed primary source, exists in several variant manuscripts and print editions, the earliest dating to around 1524.

In an annotation for his 1890 edition of Antonio de Morga&#x27;s 1609 &quot;Sucesos de las islas Filipinas&quot;, José Rizal spells the name as &quot;Si Lapulapu&quot;. This supplements a passage where Morga mentions Magellan&#x27;s death in Mactan, but does not mention the Mactan leader by name. In Philippine languages, &quot;si&quot; (plural &quot;siná&quot;) is an article used to indicate personal names. Thus &quot;Si Lapulapu&quot;, as rendered by Rizal, was subsequently interpreted by others to mean this way (though Rizal never explicitly asserts this himself) and the &quot;Si&quot; was dropped, eventually cementing the Mactan leader&#x27;s name in Filipino culture as &quot;Lapulapu&quot; or &quot;Lapu-Lapu&quot; (e.g. &quot;Siya si Lapulapu&quot; &quot;He is Lapulapu&quot; vs. &quot;Siya si Si Lapulapu&quot; &quot;He is Si Lapulapu&quot;). However, this meaning for &quot;Si&quot; or &quot;Çi&quot; in Lapulapu&#x27;s recorded name is doubtful because not all names recorded by Pigafetta contain it, as would be the case if it were. In an annotation of his 1800 edition of Pigafetta&#x27;s account, Carlo Amoretti surmised that the &quot;Si&quot; or &quot;Çi&quot; found in several native names recorded by Pigafetta was an honorific title. E. P. Patanñe (1999) thus proposes that this usage of &quot;Si&quot; was derived from a corruption of the Sanskrit title &quot;Sri&quot;.

In 1604, Fr. Prudencio de Sandoval in his &quot;Historia de la Vida y Hechos del Emperador Carlos V&quot; spelled the name as &quot;Calipulapo&quot;, perhaps through transposing the first A and I and misreading the Ç. This further became &quot;Cali Pulaco&quot; in the 1614 poem &quot;Que Dios le perdone&quot; (May God Forgive Him) by &quot;mestizo de sangley&quot; poet Carlos Calao. This rendition, spelled as &quot;Kalipulako&quot;, was later adopted as one of the pseudonyms of the Philippine hero Mariano Ponce during the Propaganda Movement. The 1898 Philippine Declaration of Independence of Cavite II el Viejo, also mentions Lapulapu under the name &quot;Rey Kalipulako de Manktan&quot; (King Kalipulako of Mactan). This name variation has further led to claims that Lapulapu was a Caliph and thus Muslim, whereas Pigafetta notes that the region was not Islamized.

In 2019, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines&#x27; National Quincentennial Committee, tasked with handling preparations for the 500th anniversary commemoration of Magellan&#x27;s arrival, stated that &quot;Lapulapu&quot; without the hyphen is the correct spelling of the Mactan ruler&#x27;s name, being based on Pigafetta&#x27;s original spelling, which they took to be &quot;Çilapulapu&quot; (approximately rendered as &quot;Silapulapu&quot;, not &quot;Kilapulapu&quot;, in equivalent Philippine orthography). The committee agreed with previous scholarship that the &quot;Si&quot; in his name reported by Pigafetta probably was an indigenous form of the Hindu honorific &quot;Sri&quot;, so Lapulapu would probably have been called &quot;Si Lapulapu&quot;.

The &quot;Aginid&quot; chronicle, whose historicity is disputed, calls him &quot;Lapulapu Dimantag&quot;, for &quot;di-mataga&quot; (&quot;cannot be hacked&quot;), which is also the surname of a prominent family in Mactan.

In 2021, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order No. 152, officially calling to change the rendering of the Filipino hero&#x27;s name from &quot;Lapu-Lapu&quot; to &quot;Lapulapu&quot;, to conform with earlier references. This executive order now requires government and non-government entities to adopt the name &quot;Lapulapu&quot; in all references pertaining to him.

==Early life==

There had been many folk accounts surrounding Lapulapu&#x27;s origin. One oral tradition is that the Sugbuanons of Opong was once ruled by a datu named Mangal and later succeeded by his son named Lapulapu.

Another is from the book &quot;Aginid, Bayok sa Atong Tawarik&quot; (&quot;Glide on, Odes to Our History&quot;&quot;) published in 1952 by Jovito Abellana, which supposedly records the oral chronicles from the reign of the last king of Cebu, Rajah Tupas (d. 1565). However, its historicity is disputed. The chronicle records the founding of the kingdom of Cebu by Sri Lumay (also known as Rajamuda Lumaya), who was a half-Tamil and half-Malay from Sumatra. His sons, Sri Alho and Sri Ukob, ruled the neighboring communities of Sialo and Nahalin, respectively. The islands they were in were collectively known as Pulua Kang Dayang or Kangdaya (literally &quot;[the islands] of the lady&quot;). Sri Lumay was known for his strict policies in defending against Moro raiders and slavers from Mindanao. His use of scorched earth tactics to repel invaders gave rise to the name Kang Sri Lumayng Sugbo (literally &quot;that of Sri Lumay&#x27;s great fire&quot;) to the town, which was later shortened to Sugbo (&quot;conflagration&quot;). Upon his death in a battle against the raiders, Sri Lumay was succeeded by his youngest son, Sri Bantug, who ruled from the region of &quot;Singhapala&quot; (literally &quot;lion city&quot;), now Mabolo in modern Cebu City. Sri Bantug died of a disease during an epidemic and was succeeded by his son Rajah Humabon (also known as Sri Humabon or Rajah Humabara). During Humabon&#x27;s reign, the region had become an important trading center. The harbors of Sugbo became known colloquially as &quot;sinibuayng hingpit&quot; (&quot;the place for trading&quot;), shortened to &quot;sibu&quot; or &quot;sibo&quot; (&quot;to trade&quot;), from which the modern name &quot;Cebu&quot; originates.

According to the &quot;Aginid&quot;, this was the period in which Lapulapu (as Lapulapu Dimantag) was first recorded as arriving from &quot;Borneo&quot; (Sabah). He asked Humabon for a place to settle, and the king offered him the region of Mandawili (now Mandaue), including the island known as Opong (or Opon), hoping that Lapulapu&#x27;s people would cultivate the land. They were successful in this, and the influx of farm produce from Mandawili enriched the trade port of Sugbo further. The relationship between Lapulapu and Humabon later deteriorated when Lapulapu turned to piracy. He began raiding merchant ships passing the island of Opong, affecting trade in Sugbo. The island thus earned the name Mangatang (&quot;those who lie in wait&quot;), later evolving to &quot;Mactan&quot;.
==Battle of Mactan==
Lapulapu was one of the two datus of Mactan before the Spanish arrived in the archipelago, the other being Zula, both of whom belong to the Maginoo class. When Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan arrived in the Philippines in the service of Spain, Zula was one of those who gave tribute to the Spanish king while Lapulapu refused.
In the midnight of April 27, 1521, Magellan led a force of around 60 Spaniards and 20 to 30 war boats (&quot;karakoa&quot;) of Humabon&#x27;s warriors from Cebu. They arrived in Mactan three hours before dawn. However, because of the presence of rock outcroppings and coral reefs, Magellan&#x27;s ships could not land on the shores of Mactan. Their ships were forced to anchor &quot;two crossbow flights&quot; away from the beach. According to Antonio Pigafetta, they faced around 1,500 warriors of Lapulapu armed with iron swords, bows, and &quot;bamboo&quot; spears.

Magellan repeated his offer not to attack them if Lapulapu swore fealty to Rajah Humabon, obeyed the Spanish king, and paid tribute, which Lapulapu again rejected. At the taunting request of Lapulapu, the battle did not begin until morning. Magellan, perhaps hoping to impress Humabon&#x27;s warriors with the superiority of European armor and weapons, told Humabon&#x27;s warriors to remain in their ships. Magellan and 49 of the heavily armored Spaniards (armed with lances, swords, crossbows, and muskets) waded ashore to meet Lapulapu&#x27;s forces. They set fire to a few houses on the shore in an attempt to scare them. Instead, Lapulapu&#x27;s warriors became infuriated and charged. Two Spaniards were killed immediately in the fighting, and Magellan was wounded in the leg with a poisoned arrow. He ordered a retreat, which most of his men followed except for a few who remained to protect him. However, he was recognized as the captain by the natives, whereupon he became the focus of the attack. Outnumbered and encumbered by their armor, Magellan&#x27;s forces were quickly overwhelmed. Magellan and several of his men were killed, and the rest escaped to the waiting ships.

The historian William Henry Scott believes that Lapulapu&#x27;s hostility may have been the result of a mistaken assumption by Magellan. Magellan assumed that ancient Filipino society was structured in the same way as European society (i.e. with royalty ruling over a region). While this may have been true in the Islamic sultanates in Mindanao, the Visayan societies were structured along a loose federation of city-states (more accurately, a chiefdom). The most powerful datu in such a federation has limited power over another member datu, but no direct control over the subjects or lands of the other datu.

Thus Magellan believed that since Rajah Humabon was the king of Cebu, he was the king of Mactan as well. But the island of Mactan, the dominion of Lapulapu and Zula, was in a location that enabled them to intercept trade ships entering the harbor of Cebu, Humabon&#x27;s domain. Thus, it was more likely that Lapulapu was actually more powerful than Humabon, or at least was the undisputed ruler of Mactan. Humabon was married to Lapulapu&#x27;s niece. When Magellan demanded that Lapulapu submit as his King Humabon had done, Lapulapu purportedly replied that: &quot;he was unwilling to come and do reverence to one whom he had been commanding for so long a time&quot;.

The &quot;Aginid&quot; chronicle also records that Humabon had actually purposefully goaded the Spaniards into fighting Lapulapu, who was his enemy at that time. However, the men of Humabon who accompanied Magellan did not engage in battle with Lapulapu, though they helped with recovering the wounded Spaniards. Humabon later poisoned and killed 27 Spanish sailors during a feast. According to the &quot;Aginid&quot;, this was because they had started raping the local women. It was also possibly to aid Magellan&#x27;s Malay slave interpreter, Enrique of Malacca, in gaining his freedom. The Spanish were refusing to release him, even though Magellan explicitly willed that he be set free upon his death. A discourse by Giovanni Battista Ramusio also claims that Enrique warned the Chief of &quot;Subuth&quot; that the Spaniards were plotting to capture the king and that this led to the murder of the Spaniards at the banquet. Enrique stayed in Cebu with Humabon while the Spanish escaped to Bohol.

The battle left the expedition with too few men to crew three ships, so they abandoned the &quot;Concepción&quot;. The remaining ships – the &quot;Trinidad&quot; and the &quot;Victoria&quot; – sailed to the Spice Islands in present-day Indonesia. From there, the expedition split into two groups. The &quot;Trinidad&quot;, commanded by Gonzalo Gómez de Espinoza tried to sail eastward across the Pacific Ocean to the Isthmus of Panama. Disease and shipwreck disrupted Espinoza&#x27;s voyage and most of the crew died. Survivors of the &quot;Trinidad&quot; returned to the Spice Islands, where the Portuguese imprisoned them. The &quot;Victoria&quot; continued sailing westward, commanded by Juan Sebastián Elcano, and managed to return to Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain in 1522. In 1529, King Charles I of Spain relinquished all claim over the Spice Islands to Portugal in the treaty of Zaragoza. However, the treaty did not stop the colonization of the Philippine archipelago from New Spain.

According to &quot;Aginid&quot;, Lapulapu and Humabon restored friendly relations after the Battle of Mactan. Lapulapu later decided to return to Borneo with his family and 17 of his men. Nothing more is known of him after this.

After Magellan&#x27;s voyage, subsequent expeditions were dispatched to the islands. Five expeditions were sent: Loaisa (1525), Cabot (1526), Saavedra (1527), Villalobos (1542), and Legazpi (1564). The Legazpi expedition was the most successful, resulting in the colonization of the islands.

==Religion==

Lapulapu&#x27;s religious beliefs are another subject of debate but it is strongly suggested that he was an adherent of the indigenous animistic anito beliefs. The inhabitants of the Sulu Archipelago believe that Qadi Lapulapu was a Muslim belonging to the Tausūg or the Sama-Bajau people of Mindanao, a claim made by the now dissolved Sultanate of Sulu that many historians negate. Moreover, prominent Cebuano anthropologist José Eleazar Bersales says that Cebu was never islamized, referenced from an excavation in Boljoon in southern Cebu. Direct evidences such as accounts of Pigafetta and the native oral tradition did not indicate Lapulapu as a Muslim but a Visayan animist and a Sugbuanon native.

Cebuanos were predominantly animist at the time of the arrival of the Spanish. Visayans were noted for their widespread practice of tattooing; hence, Spaniards referred to them as the &quot;Pintados&quot;. Pigafetta, who recorded Magellan&#x27;s encounter with the Cebuanos, explicitly described Rajah Humabon as tattooed. He also records the consumption of pork, dog meat, and palm wine (&quot;arak&quot;) by the Cebuanos, as well as the common custom of penile piercings (&quot;tugbuk&quot; or &quot;sakra&quot;). Tattooing, body modification, pork, dog meat, and alcohol are all &quot;ḥarām&quot; (forbidden) in Islam.

The supreme deity of the Visayans, as explicitly recorded by contemporary historians, was identified as &quot;Abba&quot; by Pigafetta and &quot;Kan-Laon&quot; (also spelled &quot;Laon&quot;) by the Jesuit historian Pedro Chirino in 1604, comparable to the Tagalog &quot;Bathala&quot;. There is no mention of Islam. This is in contrast to the other locations visited by the Magellan expedition where Pigafetta readily identifies the Muslims whom they encountered; he would call them &quot;Moros&quot; after the Muslim Moors of medieval Spain and northern Africa, to distinguish them from the polytheistic &quot;heathens&quot;. In fact, during the mass baptism of the Cebuanos to Christianity, he clearly identifies them as &quot;heathens,&quot; not Moros:

A more dubious claim from the &quot;Aginid&quot; is that Lapulapu may have been from Borneo. The &quot;Aginid&quot; calls him an &quot;orang laut&quot; (&quot;man of the sea&quot;) and an outsider who settled in Cebu from Borneo. The Oponganon-Cebuano oral tradition effectively disputes this claim, saying his father was Datu Mangal of Mactan, indicating that Lapulapu a native of Opong.

==Legacy==
===Recognition as a Filipino hero===
Lapulapu is regarded, retroactively, as the first Filipino hero.

On April 27, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte declared April 27 (the date when Battle of Mactan happened) as &quot;Lapu-Lapu Day&quot; for honoring as the first hero in the country who defeated foreign rule. Duterte also signed Executive Order No. 17 creating the Order of Lapu-Lapu which recognizes the services of government workers and private citizens in relation to the campaigns and advocacies of the President.

During the First Regular Season of the 14th Congress of the Philippines, Senator Richard Gordon introduced a bill proposing to declare April 27 as an official Philippine national holiday to be known as &quot;Adlaw ni Lapu-Lapu&quot;, (Cebuano, &quot;Day of Lapu-Lapu&quot;).

====Kadaugan sa Mactan====
On April 27, 2024, &quot;Lapulapu Day&quot;, 300 “,” with &quot;Lapu-Lapu Arnis de Abanico&quot; performed a historical reenactment of “Kadaugan sa Mactan” at Mactan Shrine as witnessed by Mayor Junard Chan.

===Commemorations===

The government erected a statue in his honor on Mactan Island and renamed the town of Opon in Cebu to Lapu-Lapu City. A large statue of him, donated by South Korea, stands in the middle of Agrifina Circle in Rizal Park in Manila, replacing a fountain and rollerskating rink. Lapulapu appears on the official seal of the Philippine National Police. His face was used as the main design on the 1-centavo coin that was circulated in the Philippines from 1967 to 1994.

In the United States, a street in South of Market, San Francisco is named after Lapulapu. That street and others in the immediate neighborhood were renamed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors with names derived from historical Filipino heroes on August 31, 1979.

On January 18, 2021, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, in cooperation with the Quincentennial Commemorations in the Philippines, launches the 5,000-Piso commemorative non-circulating banknote, in honor of his heroism.

===In urban legend and folklore===
According to local legend, Lapulapu never died but was turned into stone, and has since then been guarding the seas of Mactan. Fisherfolk in Mactan would throw coins at a stone shaped like a man as a means to &quot;ask permission&quot; from Lapulapu to fish &quot;in his territory&quot;. Another urban legend concerns the statue of Lapulapu erected in 1933 at the center of the town plaza of Lapu-Lapu when the city was still a municipality with the name Opon. The statue faced the old town hall, where mayors used to hold office; Lapulapu was shown with a crossbow in the stance of shooting an enemy. Superstitious citizens proposed to replace this crossbow with a sword, after three consecutive mayors of Opon (Rito dela Serna, Gregorio dela Serna and Simeon Amodia) each died of heart attack. The statue was modified during the administration of Mayor Mariano Dimataga who took office in 1938.

==In popular culture==
*Portrayed by Mario Montenegro in the 1955 film &quot;Lapu-Lapu&quot;.
*Portrayed by Calvin Millado in the 1995 children&#x27;s educational series &quot;Bayani&quot;.
*Portrayed by Lito Lapid in the 2002 film &quot;Lapu-Lapu&quot;.
*Portrayed by Aljur Abrenica in the GMA 2010 Lupang Hinirang Music Video 
*Lapu-Lapu was the inspiration of a playable character of the same name in the mobile game &quot;Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&quot;. The character is a dual swordsman who has two instances and can swap between two weapons. In the game lore, he serves as the chief of Makadan (now Parlas, a sublocation in Vonetis Island), a reference to Mactan Island.
*In the 2004 Bayani Agbayani song, &quot;Otso Otso&quot;, he was mentioned the last time the song mentions, &quot;Two plus two&quot;. Ironically, the child rhyme mentions him at the second line: &quot;One plus one, Magellan, Two plus two, Lapu-Lapu...&quot; This presumably references the Battle of Mactan that Magellan was killed in.
*The song &quot;Panalo&quot; by Ez Mil, had a line that mentions Lapu-Lapu being beheaded in the Battle of Mactan. The song was met with criticism for the line&#x27;s lack of historical accuracy. Among the song&#x27;s critics were the Lapu-Lapu City government and the National Historical Commission of the Philippines.
*Portrayed by Zeus Collins in the 2019 film &quot;The Mall, The Merrier&quot;, as one of the statues in Tamol Mall.
*Portrayed by Armando Alera in the 2022 series &quot;Boundless&quot;.
*Portrayed by Michael Copon in the 2023 film &quot;1521&quot;
*The Kuwaiti novelist Saod Alsanousi refers to Lapulapu in his novel, The Bamboo Stalk, which won the International Prize for Arabic literature. The protagonist of this novel Jose/Issa explains that Lapulapu represented Islam to him. 

==Shrine==

The Lapu-Lapu shrine is a bronze statue in Punta Engaño, Lapu-Lapu, Cebu, Philippines.

<text>An obscene phone call is an unsolicited telephone call where a person uses profane and/or sexual language to interact with someone who may be known to them or may be a complete stranger. Making obscene telephone calls for sexual arousal or other sexual pleasure is known as telephone scatologia and is considered a form of exhibitionism. 
==Status as a paraphilia==
Telephone scatologia is usually classed as a paraphilia from a psychiatric viewpoint. It is in the DSM-5 as an other specified paraphilic disorder. Related psychiatric terms (such as &quot;coprophilia&quot;) were coined in Australia, the United States, and Germany; most of the pertinent literature is North American. From the viewpoint of the recipient of the calls, obscene calls may be considered to be a form of sexual harassment, stalking, or both.

==Legal consequences==
In some U.S. states, making obscene telephone calls is a Class 1 Misdemeanor. In the United Kingdom, obscene phone calls are punishable by a fine of up to £5,000 or up to six months in prison under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

==Reactions by unwilling recipients==
Generally, unwilling recipients of obscene phone calls are advised to simply hang up on obscene callers and then report the incident to the telephone company or the police. Even when Caller ID is not shown, calls are logged by the telephone company, so the perpetrator&#x27;s phone number can be discovered. However, many people who regularly engage in obscene phone calls use payphones or prepaid cell phones, and in these cases, a more extensive investigation is necessary. The prevalence of internet telephony, and sophisticated international operations have also stymied the investigation of nuisance phone calls.

==Association with feelings of inadequacy and isolation==
Often, people who make obscene phone calls are emotionally or behaviorally maladjusted adolescent boys who have shown previous signs of sexual abuse, as well as having already committed sexual abuse. Obscene phone callers usually feel inadequate, have feelings of isolation, have trouble forming relationships and consider making obscene phone calls to be the only way that they can sexually express themselves.
