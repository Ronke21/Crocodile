<text>John David Jackson (born November 18, 1977), better known by his stage name Fabolous, is an American rapper. Raised in Brooklyn, he first gained recognition for his ability upon performing live on DJ Clue&#x27;s Hot 97 radio show. Jackson then signed to Clue&#x27;s record label Desert Storm Records, in a joint venture with Elektra Records. He rose to further prominence with his debut studio album &quot;Ghetto Fabolous&quot; (2001), which spawned the hit singles &quot;Can&#x27;t Deny It&quot; (featuring Nate Dogg) and &quot;Young&#x27;n (Holla Back).&quot; Adopting a further commercially-oriented approach, his second album, &quot;Street Dreams&quot; (2003), was supported by the singles &quot;Can&#x27;t Let You Go&quot; (featuring Lil&#x27; Mo) and &quot;Into You&quot; (featuring Tamia or Ashanti)—both of which peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 2004, Jackson signed with Atlantic Records—another subsidiary of Warner Music Group—to release his third album &quot;Real Talk&quot; (2004), which saw continued success as his only project with the label. In 2006, he signed with Def Jam Recordings—owned by Warner competitor Universal Music Group—and founded his own label imprint, Street Family Records. His fourth and fifth albums, &quot;From Nothin&#x27; to Somethin&#x27;&quot; (2007) and &quot;Loso&#x27;s Way&quot; (2009) yielded his furthest commercial success, peaking at numbers two and one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, respectively. Between his studio albums, he amassed a number of self-released mixtapes, including several installments in his &quot;There Is No Competition&quot;, &quot;The S.O.U.L. Tape&quot;, and &quot;Summertime Shootout&quot; series. He released his sixth and seventh albums, &quot;The Young OG Project&quot; (2014) and &quot;Summertime Shootout 3: Coldest Summer Ever&quot; (2019), to continued positive reception.

Including the aforementioned songs, Jackson&#x27;s series of hits throughout the 2000s expanded to include &quot;Trade It All, Pt. 2&quot; (featuring Diddy and Jagged Edge), &quot;Breathe,&quot; &quot;Make Me Better&quot; (featuring Ne-Yo), &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Go&quot; (featuring T-Pain), &quot;Throw It in the Bag&quot; (featuring The-Dream) and &quot;You Be Killin&#x27; Em&quot;. He is also known for his appearances on R&amp;B singles, including &quot;Superwoman Pt. II&quot; by Lil&#x27; Mo, &quot;Shawty Is a 10&quot; by The-Dream, &quot;Addiction&quot; by Ryan Leslie, &quot;She Got Her Own&quot; by Jamie Foxx, and &quot;Say Aah&quot; by Trey Songz, among others. Throughout his career, he has been nominated for two Grammy Awards.

== Life and career ==
=== 1977–2000: Early life and career beginnings ===
Fabolous was born John David Jackson on November 18, 1977, and is of Dominican and African-American descent. He grew up in Breevort Houses in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of the Brooklyn borough of New York City.

Jackson attended High School of Art &amp; Design and City-As-School High School in Manhattan, and eventually Boys and Girls High School in Bed-Stuy. While in his senior year of high school, Jackson began to pursue a career in hip hop music. In the early years of his career, he rapped under the name Fabolous Sport, in reference to Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Polo Sport line, however this was later shortened to simply Fabolous. The misspelling was unintentional; Jackson originally intended to be simply called &quot;Fabulous&quot; but incorrectly spelled it during a freestyle and it stuck. He was invited to rap live on American record producer and music executive DJ Clue&#x27;s radio show, then on New York City&#x27;s radio station Hot 97. Fabolous and N.O.R.E. performed over the instrumental to The Lox&#x27;s song &quot;Money, Power &amp; Respect&quot;, and the following day, Clue signed Fabolous to his record label, Desert Storm Records as its second artist after Clue. Fabolous made his first major appearance on Clue&#x27;s &quot;The Professional&quot; (1998) on two of its tracks, one of which alongside Mase and Foxy Brown. In the following two years, Fabolous and Desert Storm were signed to Elektra Records (a subsidiary of Warner Music Group) through a distribution deal with the label. In a September 6, 2001, interview with &quot;Hot104.com&quot;, Fabolous said he never planned on becoming a rapper and told the website: &quot;I was just trying to make some money, ya know? I got tired of being broke. This was something where I could make some money. It just happened for me.&quot;

=== 2001–2003: &quot;Ghetto Fabolous&quot; and &quot;Street Dreams&quot; ===

Fabolous released his debut album, &quot;Ghetto Fabolous&quot;, on September 11, 2001. It debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 140,000 copies in its first week. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Deny It&quot;, was produced by Rick Rock and features a chorus by Nate Dogg, who interpolates Tupac Shakur&#x27;s song &quot;Ambitionz az a Ridah&quot;. It charted on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, along with two of its follow-up singles: &quot;Young&#x27;n (Holla Back)&quot;, produced by The Neptunes, and &quot;Trade It All&quot;, which features vocals from Jagged Edge and was produced by label boss Clue and Duro.

Fabolous released his second album, &quot;Street Dreams&quot; on March 4, 2003. Powered by a Just Blaze beat and guest vocals from Lil&#x27; Mo and Mike Shorey, &quot;Can&#x27;t Let You Go&quot; reached number one on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart and number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Its follow-up, &quot;Into You&quot; with Tamia likewise reached number four on the latter chart. Also released on &quot;Street Dreams&quot; was the lead single &quot;This Is My Party&quot; and the single &quot;Trade It All Pt. 2&quot; which featured Jagged Edge (whom return from the &quot;Ghetto Fabolous&quot; version) and a new verse from Diddy, as well as a new instrumental.

Exactly seven months later, on November 4, 2003, Fabolous released the mixtape, &quot;More Street Dreams, Pt. 2: The Mixtape&quot;. It was an official release by his record label, Elektra. The album featured remixes and tracks not originally on the commercial release of &quot;Street Dreams&quot;. This album was also an outlet for his three-man crew, known as the Triangle Offense, consisting of himself, Paul Cain, and Joe Budden. The album features a remix to song &quot;Fire&quot;, which was originally on the latter&#x27;s self-titled debut album (2003).

=== 2004–2008: &quot;Real Talk&quot; and &quot;From Nothin&#x27; to Somethin&quot;&#x27; ===

Fabolous&#x27; third album, &quot;Real Talk&quot; was released on November 5, 2004. It debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of 179,000 copies, and had two charting singles—the lowest in his career at the time. The singles, &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;Baby&quot;, featuring Mike Shorey, and show a more sensitive side of the rapper that he had shown in many songs in the past. His second single was not promoted until weeks after the album&#x27;s release. Its third single, &quot;Tit 4 Tat&quot;, featured Pharrell of The Neptunes, the latter of whom also produced the song. Fabolous admitted that the single failed due to poor promotion. Making the music video for his fourth single, &quot;Do the Damn Thing&quot; cost Jackson US$30,000. The song featured Young Jeezy. That same year, Fabolous was nominated for a Grammy Award for his guest feature on the remix of the single &quot;Dip It Low&quot; by Christina Milian. His own clothing line, &quot;Rich Yung Society&quot; was launched in 2006 after being discussed two years prior.

In early 2006, Fabolous was let out of his contract with Atlantic and signed a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings, following a &quot;de facto&quot; trade that sent Def Jam artist Musiq Soulchild to Atlantic.

His fourth studio album, &quot;From Nothin&#x27; to Somethin&quot;, was released in June 2007. Fabolous took the number one spot on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and Top Rap Albums charts for the first time in his career, while it debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 159,000 copies in its first week. The album was certified Gold in July 2007. It is his first album on Def Jam Recordings. He was featured on the cover of video game &quot;Def Jam: Icon&quot;.

The first single and video, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, features Young Jeezy who also appeared on the &quot;Real Talk&quot; track &quot;Do the Damn Thing&quot;. Lil Wayne and Remy Ma are featured on the remix. His second single was &quot;Return of the Hustle&quot; which featured Swizz Beatz, also came out before the album release, to some acclaim, but little airplay. His third single though, &quot;Make Me Better,&quot; which features fellow Def Jam artist Ne-Yo, and is produced by Timbaland, was his biggest hit to date, spending 14 weeks at number one on the Hot Rap Track Billboard Chart. The fourth single was &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Go.&quot; Jermaine Dupri produced it and T-Pain sings the hook. However, in music video version of the song, Jermaine Dupri sings the hook. This song also found success, reaching number four on the Hot Rap Track Chart.

=== 2009–2010: &quot;Loso&#x27;s Way&quot; ===
Fabolous released his fifth studio album, &quot;Loso&#x27;s Way&quot;, in July 2009. The album is based on the 1993 film &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;, similar to Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;American Gangster&quot;. The first official single is &quot;Throw It in the Bag&quot;, featuring The-Dream, and is produced by Christopher &quot;Tricky&quot; Stewart. The second single is &quot;My Time&quot;, featuring Jeremih, and is produced by The Runners and Kevin &quot;KC&quot; Cossom. The third single is &quot;Everything, Everyday, Everywhere&quot;, featuring Keri Hilson, and is produced by Ryan Leslie. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 99,000 copies in its first week. It became Fabolous&#x27; first album to top the chart. In its second week of sales, the album dropped 8 spots from #1 to #9, selling 37,000 copies. A deluxe album was released on the same day as the standard release. The edition features a bonus DVD, (&quot;Loso&#x27;s Way&quot; the movie). The movie features Fabolous (and three other of his friends). Fabolous is leaving a restaurant when he is shot. His three friends quickly rush Fabolous to the hospital, but are stopped by the police after running a red light. Fellow rapper Styles P has a role in the movie. DJ Clue, DJ Khaled, Jadakiss, Swizz Beatz, DJ Envy, and Ryan Leslie make cameo appearances. The movie &quot;Loso&#x27;s Way&quot; runs for 33:03 minutes. In order to view &quot;Loso&#x27;s Way&quot;, the deluxe album &quot;Loso&#x27;s Way&quot; must be purchased. In September 2009, Fabolous was ranked number eight on MTV&#x27;s Hottest MC in the Game list. In an interview on December 10, 2009, with MTV, he announced that he would be releasing part two to his mixtape series with DJ Drama entitled: &quot;There is No Competition – Part 2: The Funeral Service.&quot; Fabolous announced that it would be released on Christmas Day as a gift to his fans. He then pushed back the release date multiple times via Twitter before he and DJ Drama finally released the mixtape online on March 4, 2010.

=== 2010–2014: &quot;There Is No Competition&quot; series and &quot;The Soul Tape&quot; series ===
On March 5, 2010, Fabolous released &quot;There Is No Competition 2: The Funeral Service&quot;, his fourth solo mixtape and the sequel to 2008&#x27;s &quot;There Is No Competition&quot;. Due to the popularity of the mixtape, Fabolous re-released it for retail in the form of an extended play (EP) titled &quot;There Is No Competition 2: The Grieving Music EP&quot;. The EP, which was preceded by the Ryan Leslie and Widens Pkolo Dorsainville-produced single &quot;You Be Killin Em&quot;, was released on August 29, 2010. The single peaked at number 68 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

After it was announced that his sixth album would once again be delayed, Fabolous chose to release a new project titled &quot;The S.O.U.L. Tape&quot;. The mixtape was released on April 22, 2011, and features Fabolous rapping over soul-sampling production, inspired by a freestyle he had done over the instrumental to Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Devil in a New Dress&quot;. On Christmas Day 2011, Fabolous released &quot;There Is No Competition 3: Death Comes in 3&#x27;s&quot;, the third installment in his &quot;There Is No Competition&quot; mixtape series. On November 22, 2012, Fabolous released his seventh mixtape, &quot;The S.O.U.L. Tape 2&quot;. &quot;The S.O.U.L. Tape 2&quot; featured guest appearances from Trey Songz, Pusha T, Cassie, J. Cole, Wale and Joe Budden. The mixtape&#x27;s production was handled by Streetrunner, Treddy da Don, AraabMuzik and Cardiak, among others, and follows the theme of the first album by utilising heavy usage of soul samples throughout.

In late 2012, Fabolous announced his sixth album, then-titled &quot;Loso&#x27;s Way 2: Rise to Power&quot;, would be released in 2013. The first official single from &quot;Loso&#x27;s Way 2&quot;, &quot;Ready&quot; featuring singer Chris Brown was released on January 17, 2013. The second single &quot;When I Feel Like It&quot; featuring 2 Chainz was released on July 9, 2013. In an interview Fabolous revealed the list of features included Trey Songz, Ne-Yo, FYUTCH, Rick Ross, and Young Jeezy and stated that the album was about him &quot;evolving and growing as a person, as a man, as an artist, as a father, as a friend.&quot; &quot;Loso&#x27;s Way 2&quot; was scheduled to be released in 2013 by Desert Storm and Def Jam, however, the album was delayed all year long and subsequently rescheduled for release in 2014. On July 30, 2014, Fabolous announced that the lead single from the album would be released by &quot;the end of summer&quot; and would again feature Chris Brown. He stated that &quot;Ready&quot; was just a &quot;warmup record&quot; for this song and that it would be very melodic.

<text>A tenant farmer is a farmer or farmworker who resides and works on land owned by a landlord, while tenant farming is an agricultural production system in which landowners contribute their land and often a measure of operating capital and management, while tenant farmers contribute their labor along with at times varying amounts of capital and management. Depending on the terms of their contract, tenants may make payments to the owner either of a fixed portion of the product, in cash or in a combination. The rights the tenant has over the land, the form, and measures of payment vary across systems (geographically and chronologically). In some systems, the tenant could be evicted at whim (tenancy at will); in others, the landowner and tenant sign a contract for a fixed number of years (tenancy for years or indenture). In most developed countries today, at least some restrictions are placed on the rights of landlords to evict tenants under normal circumstances.

==England and Wales==
Historically, rural society utilised a three-tier structure of landowners (nobility, gentry, yeomanry), tenant farmers, and farmworkers. Originally, tenant farmers were known as peasants. Under Anglo-Norman law, almost all tenants were bonded to the land, and were therefore also villeins, but after the labour shortage occasioned by the Black Death in the mid-14th century, the number of free tenants substantially increased. Many tenant farmers became affluent and socially well connected, and employed a substantial number of labourers and managed more than one farm. Tenancy could be either in perpetuity or rotated by the owners. Cottiers (cottagers) held much less land.

The 17th century to the early 19th century witnessed the growth of large estates, and the opportunity for a farmer to hold land other than by tenancy was significantly reduced, with the result that by the 19th century, about 90% of agricultural land area and holdings were tenanted, although these figures declined markedly after World War II, to around 60% in 1950 and only 35% of agricultural land area in 1994. High rates of inheritance taxes in the postwar period led to the breakup or reduction of many large estates, allowing many tenants to buy their holdings at favourable prices.

The landmark Agricultural Holdings Act 1948 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6. c. 63) was enacted at a time when war-time food rationing was still in force and sought to encourage long-term investment by tenants by granting them lifetime security of tenure. Under the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976, security was extended to spouses and relatives of tenants for two successions, providing that they had been earning the majority of their income from the holding for five years. Succession rights were however withdrawn for new tenancies in 1984 and this was consolidated in the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986. These two statutes also laid down rules for the determination of rents by the arbitration process. The 1986 statute covered tenancies over agricultural land where the land was used for a trade or business and the definition of &quot;agriculture&quot; in section 96(1) was wide enough to include various uses that in themselves were not agricultural but were deemed so if ancillary to agriculture (e.g. woodlands). The essence of the code was to establish complex constraints on the landlord&#x27;s ability to give the notice to quit while also converting fixed-term tenancies into yearly tenancies at the conclusion of the fixed term. In addition, there was a uniform rent ascertainment scheme contained in section 12.

It became difficult to obtain new tenancies as a result of landlords&#x27; reluctance to have a tenant protected by the 1986 act and in 1995, the government of the day, with the support of industry organizations, enacted a new market-oriented code in the form of the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995. The protection of the 1986 act remains in respect of tenancies created prior to the existence of the 1995 act and for those tenancies falling within section 4 of the 1995 act. For all other tenancies granted on or after 1 September 1995, their regulation is within the 1995 act framework.

That act was altered with effect from 18 October 2006 by the Regulatory Reform (Agricultural Tenancies) (England and Wales) Order 2006 (SI 2006/2805), which also contains changes to the 1986 act. Tenancies granted after 18 October 2006 over agricultural land used for a trade or business will fall within the limited protection of the 1995 act so as to enjoy (provided the term is more than two years in length or there is a yearly tenancy) a mandatory minimum twelve months written notice to quit, including in respect of fixed terms. There is for all tenancies within the scope of the act a mandatory tenants&#x27; right to remove fixtures and buildings (section 8) together with compensation for improvements (Part III). The rent review provisions in Part II may be the subject of choice to a much greater extent than previously. Disputes under the act are usually, by the terms of Part IV, the subject of statutory arbitration controlled by the framework of the Arbitration Act 1996.

The current regime under the 1995 act for regulating tenancies, commonly known as Farm Business Tenancies, permits the creation of a clearly and easily terminable interest, whether by a periodic tenancy or a fixed term. In the cycle of animal husbandry and land use and improvement, the long-term effect of the Farm Business Tenancy on the landscape of Britain is not yet proven. It was predicted by landowners and other industry spokesmen that the 1995 act would create opportunities for new tenants by allowing large areas of new lettings but this has not happened in practice as most landowners have continued to favour share farming or management agreements over formal tenancies and the majority of new lettings under the act have been to existing farmers, often owner-occupiers taking on extra land at significantly higher rents than could be afforded by a traditional tenant.

==Scotland==

Scotland has its own independent legal system and the legislation there differs from that of England and Wales. Neither the AHA 1986 nor the ATA 1995 applies in Scotland. The relevant legislation for Scotland is rather the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 with the following amendments in The Public Services Reform (Agricultural Holdings) (Scotland) Order 2011, The Agricultural Holdings (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2012 and The Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) 2003 Remedial Order 2014. These supersede the previous legislation in the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991 and the Agriculture (Scotland) Act 1948.

For Scotland see Crofting, a traditional and long-established means of tenant and subsistence farming.

==Ireland==
Until about 1900, the majority of Ireland was held by landlords, as much as 97% in 1870, and rented out to tenant farmers who had to pay rent to landlords and taxes to the Church of Ireland and State. The majority of the people had no access to land. 1.5% of the population owned 33.7% of the island, and 50% of the country was in the hands of only 750 families. Absenteeism was common and detrimental to the country&#x27;s progress. Tenants often sub-rented small plots on a yearly basis from local farmers paying for them by labour service by a system, known as conacre, most without any lease or land rights. Irish smallholders were indistinguishable from the cottiers of England.

The abuse of tenant farmers led to widespread emigration to the United States and the colonies and was a key factor within the Home Rule Movement. They also underlined a deterioration in Protestant-Catholic relationships, although there were notable elements of cooperation in reform attempts such as the Tenant Right League of the 1850s. Following the Great Famine tenant farmers were the largest class of people. Discontent led to the Land War of the 1870s onwards, the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870, the founding of the Land League 1879 to establish fair rents and the fixity of tenures. The movement played a key element in the unification of country and urban classes and the creation of a national identity not existing before.

The Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870 stands out as the first attempt to resolve problems of tenants rights in Ireland and the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881 went even further to inspire campaigners even in Wales. The Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act 1885 followed, finally the great breakthrough after the successful 1902 Land Conference, the enactment of the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 whereby the state financed tenants to completely buy out their landlords. Under the act of 1903 and the consequential act of 1909, the national situation was completely transformed. When in March 1920, the Irish Estate Commission reviewed the development since 1903 under these acts, they estimated that 83 million sterling had been advanced for transferred, whilst a further were pending costing 24 million sterling. By 1914, 75% of occupiers were buying out their landlords, mostly under the two acts. In all, under the pre-UK Land Acts over 316,000 tenants purchased their holdings amounting to out of a total of 20 million in the country.

On the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922, the Irish Land Commission was reconstituted by the Land Law (Commission) Act, 1923. The commission had acquired and supervised the transfer of up to of farmland between 1885 and 1920 where the freehold was assigned under mortgage to tenant farmers and farm workers. The focus had been on the compulsory purchase of untenanted estates so that they could be divided into smaller units for local families. In 1983, the commission ceased acquiring land; this signified the start of the end of the commission&#x27;s reform of Irish land ownership, though freehold transfers of farmland still had to be signed off by the commission into the 1990s. The commission was dissolved in March 1999.

==Scandinavia==
Historically, despite Norway being practically a Danish province for almost 300 years before 1814, the countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (with Finland) had differing approaches to land tenure.

===Norway===

A tenant farmer in Norway was known as a &quot;husmann&quot; (plural: &quot;husmenn&quot;) and were most common in the mid-19th century when they constituted around one-quarter of the country&#x27;s population. Heavy demands were placed on these tenants by their landlords, the &quot;bønder&quot; or land-owning farmers. The majority of the husmann&#x27;s working hours were usually taken up by work for the landlord, leaving him little time to work on his own land or better his own situation. As a result, though the husmenn were technically free to leave the land at any time, their poor economic state made them in essence &quot;economic serfs&quot;. Failing to own their own land also made tenant farmers ineligible to vote according to the Norwegian Constitution at the time. The number of tenant farmers in the country grew during the 19th century, rising from 48,571 in 1825 to 65,060 in 1855, the latter figure representing the height of the husmann population in Norway, most of whom lived in the eastern part of the country. Given their difficult economic and social position in Norway, many Norwegian husmenn immigrated to Canada and the United States throughout the 19th century. Following the revolutions of 1848 the husmenn&#x27;s cause was taken up by Marcus Thrane. Thrane fought for the husmenn&#x27;s rights at home and also encouraged them to emigrate and seek better fortunes abroad. The number of husmenn began to decline in the second half of the 19th century, and by 1910 they made up less than 5% of Norwegian society.

=== Sweden and Finland ===
The term &quot;torpare/torppari&quot; (Swedish/Finnish for crofter) refers to a slightly different type of tenant farmers, less secure than the inheritable usufruct right as &quot;åbo&quot; but sometimes with contracts as long as 50 years. The lease was, depending on the landowner&#x27;s good will, in practice often transferred to a son or a widow. 

Their situation was usually poor but, contrary to in Denmark, they were in theory always free to leave. The croft&#x27;s lease was typically paid in the form of corvée. They would work their own land as well as that of a landowning farmer (&quot;bonde&quot;), noble or other. In some aspects their situation made them easy victims of impressment. Population growth and landreforms &quot;(enskiftet)&quot; contributed to a 19th century increase of crofts but, particularly in Sweden, also to a shift from tenant farmers to farm laborers &quot;(statare)&quot; hired on yearlong contracts, paid in-kind.

The lives of &quot;torpare&quot; and &quot;statare&quot; were described by prominent Swedish and Finnish novelists and writers such as Ivar Lo-Johansson, Jan Fridegård, Väinö Linna (Under the North Star trilogy) and Moa Martinson. The &quot;Statare&quot; system was abolished in 1918 (Finland) and 1945 (Sweden), the &quot;Torpare&quot; system more gradually.

==Japan==
In Japan, landowners turned over their land to families of tenant farmers to manage. During the Meiji period, Japanese tenant farmers were traditionally cultivators rather than capitalistic or entrepreneurial venture by nature, paid in kind for their labors. Approximately 30% of land was held by tenants. Many aspects of Tokugawa feudalism continued. After WWII, the Farm Land Reform Law of 1946 banned absentee landlordism, re-distributing land and permitted tenants to buy. By the 1950s, it virtually eliminated the landlord-tenant relationship.

==Canada==
From the nineteenth century on, tenant farming immigrants came to Canada not just from the British Isles but also the United States of America.

==United States==
Tenant farming has been important in the US from the 1870s to the present. Tenants typically bring their own tools and animals. To that extent it is distinguished from being a sharecropper, which is a tenant farmer who usually provides no capital and pays fees with crops.

A hired hand is an agricultural employee even though he or she may live on the premises and exercise a considerable amount of control over the agricultural work, such as a foreman. A sharecropper is a farm tenant who pays rent with a portion (often half) of the crop he raises and who brings little to the operation besides his family labor; the landlord usually furnishing working stock, tools, fertilizer, housing, fuel, and seed, and often providing regular advice and oversight.

Tenant farming in the North was historically a step on the &quot;agricultural ladder&quot; from hired hand or sharecropper taken by young farmers as they accumulated enough experience and capital to buy land (or buy out their siblings when a farm was inherited).

About two-thirds of sharecroppers were white, the rest black. Sharecroppers, the poorest of the poor, organized for better conditions. The racially integrated Southern Tenant Farmers Union made gains for sharecroppers in the 1930s. Sharecropping had diminished in the 1940s due to the Great Depression, farm mechanization, and other factors.

===Black Belt conditions===

In the Black Belt in the American South until the mid 20th century, the predominant agricultural system involved white land owners and African-American tenant farmers. Very little cash changed hands. The few local banks were small and cash was scarce and had to be hoarded for taxes. Landowners needed a great deal of labor at harvest time to pick the cash crop, cotton. The typical plan was to divide old plantations into small farms that were assigned to the tenants. Throughout the year the tenants lived rent-free. They tended their own gardens. Every week, they bought food and supplies on credit through the local country store. At harvest time, the tenants picked the cotton, and turned it all over to the landowners. They sold the cotton on the national market and used part of the funds to pay the debts owed to the country store. The cycle then started all over again. Landowners also worked some of the land directly, using black labor paid in cash. The landowners held all the political power, and fought vigorously against government welfare programs that would provide cash that would undermine the cashless system. Economic historians Lee Alston and Joseph Ferrie (1999) describe the system as essentially an informal contract that: 
:bound employer and worker through the provision of housing, medical care, and other in-kind services along with cash wages. At its heart, it guaranteed a stable and adequate labor supply to the planter. Though restricted by the directives of the planter, workers in return received some measure of economic stability, including a social safety net, access to financial capital, and physical protection in an often-violent society.

Tenant farmers often had agricultural managers who supervised their activities. In 1907, for instance, J. H. Netterville began employment for the Panola Company, an agricultural business founded by William Mackenzie Davidson in the rich farming area of St. Joseph in Tensas Parish in northeastern Louisiana in the Mississippi River delta country. In its heyday, Panola controlled some eleven thousand acres, two-thirds planted in cotton and the other third in grains. Netterville became general manager of three highly profitable Panola properties, the Balmoral, Blackwater, and Wyoming plantations near Newellton, in which capacity he supervised 125 African-American tenant farming families, with little strife and great ease, according to reports from that period.

<doc id="303439" wikidata="Q788777" url="?curid=303439" title="Breakfast of Champions">
<text>Breakfast of Champions, or Goodbye Blue Monday is a 1973 novel by the American author Kurt Vonnegut. His seventh novel, it is set predominantly in the fictional town of Midland City, Ohio, and focuses on two characters: Dwayne Hoover, a Midland resident, Pontiac dealer and affluent figure in the city, and Kilgore Trout, a widely published but mostly unknown science fiction author. &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; deals with themes of free will, suicide, and race relations, among others. The novel is full of drawings by the author, substituting descriptive language with depictions requiring no translation.

== Plot ==
&quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; tells the story of the events that lead up to the meeting of Kilgore Trout and Dwayne Hoover, the meeting itself, and the immediate aftermath. Trout is a struggling science fiction writer who, after their fateful meeting, becomes successful and wins a Nobel Prize; Hoover is a wealthy businessman who is going insane, sent over the brink by his encounter with Trout.

Trout, who believes himself to be completely unknown as a writer, answers an invitation to appear at the Midland City arts festival. First he goes to New York City, where he is abducted and beaten up by a group of anonymous, faceless characters who through the media gain the moniker &quot;The Pluto Gang&quot;. Trout hitches a ride first with a truck driver, with whom he discusses everything from politics to sex to the destruction of the planet. Then he hops a ride with the only clearly happy character in the book, the driver of a Ford Galaxie who works for himself as a traveling salesman.

Hoover gradually becomes insane as the book progresses. He terrifies his employee at the Pontiac dealership, Harry LeSabre, by criticizing his clothes. LeSabre is afraid Hoover has discovered that he is a closeted transvestite. A recent prison parolee named Wayne Hoobler attempts to find work with Hoover, but is rebuffed. With nowhere else to go, Hoobler hangs around the car lot. Hoover then gets into a fight with his mistress and secretary, Francine Pefko, because he accuses her of asking him to buy her a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.

Trout and Hoover meet in the cocktail lounge of the new Holiday Inn, where Hoover&#x27;s gay estranged son, Bunny, plays the piano. When the bartender turns on the black lights and Trout&#x27;s white shirt glows brilliantly, Hoover is entranced by it. He accosts Trout and speed-reads his novel, &quot;Now It Can Be Told&quot;. The premise of the novel is that there is only one creature with free will in the universe (the reader of the novel) and everyone else is a robot. Hoover interprets its message as addressed to him from the Creator of the Universe and goes on a violent rampage, injuring many people around in the belief they are unfeeling robots, including Bunny, Pefko, and Trout. Hoover is eventually institutionalized and winds up a homeless derelict. 

In the epilogue, Trout is released from the hospital after Hoover partly bit off his finger in the rampage, and is wandering back to the arts festival, which unbeknownst to him has been canceled. The narrator, who has become an interactive character in the universe of his own creation, watches Trout and then chases him down. He proves that he is the Creator of the Universe by sending Trout all around the world, through time and back. Then he returns to his own universe, presumably, through the &quot;void&quot;, while Trout yells after him, &quot;Make me young!&quot;

== Themes ==
Suicide, free will, mental illness, and social and economic cruelty are dealt with throughout the novel. In the preface, Vonnegut states that he tends &quot;to think of human beings as huge, rubbery test tubes, too, with chemical reactions seething inside.&quot; As with &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; (1959), the nature of free will is called into question, in this case by considering mankind as biological machines, and physical measurements of characters are often given when they are introduced.

He attributes the mental illness of Dwayne Hoover and society at large to an abundance of &quot;bad chemicals&quot; in the brain which, when combined with bad ideas, formed &quot;the Yin and Yang of madness.&quot; This idea, that humans are no more than machines, is contained within the novel Kilgore Trout gives to Dwayne Hoover. Both Trout and Vonnegut realize the power of bad ideas, with Vonnegut remarking how &quot;natural it was for [people] to behave so abominably, and with such abominable results: They were doing their best to live like people invented in story books. This was the reason Americans shot each other so often: it was a convenient literary device for ending short stories and books.&quot; The view of humans as biological machines, initially accepted by Vonnegut, is counteracted by Rabo Karabekian, the abstract artist who suggests &quot;Our awareness is all that is alive and maybe sacred in any of us. Everything else about us is dead machinery.&quot;

The novel is critical of American society and its treatment of its citizens, many of whom Vonnegut writes &quot;were so ignored and cheated and insulted that they thought they might be in the wrong country.&quot; He focuses largely on race, the poor, and the destruction of the environment, criticizing the hypocrisy of a land that claims to be based on the principles of freedom having been founded by people who &quot;used human beings for machinery, and, even after slavery was eliminated, because it was so embarrassing, they and their descendants continued to think of ordinary human beings as machines.&quot; The incidents in the life of Wayne Hoobler, a black resident of Midland City, are frequently contrasted with those of the similarly named Dwayne Hoover, emphasizing the aforementioned impact of race.

== Style ==
The novel is simple in syntax and sentence structure, part of Vonnegut&#x27;s signature style. Likewise, irony, sentimentality, black humor, and didacticism are prevalent throughout the work. Like much of his oeuvre, &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; is broken into very small pieces, in this case separated by three dots. Vonnegut himself has claimed that his books &quot;are essentially mosaics made up of a whole bunch of tiny little chips ... and each chip is a joke.&quot; Characteristically, he makes heavy use of repetition, in this case starting many sections with &quot;Listen&quot; and ending many with &quot;And so on.&quot;

The novel is full of drawings by the author, intending to illustrate various aspects of life on Earth, are sometimes pertinent to the story line and sometimes tangential. They include renderings of an anus, flags, the date 1492, a beaver, a vulva, a flamingo, little girls&#x27; underpants, a torch, headstones, the yin-yang symbol, guns, trucks, cows and the hamburgers that are made from them, chickens and the Kentucky Fried Chicken that is made from them, an electric chair, the letters ETC, Christmas cards, a right hand that has a severed ring finger, the chemical structure of a plastic molecule, an apple, pi, zero, infinity, and the sunglasses the author himself wears as he enters the storyline.

&quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; makes heavy use of metafiction, with Vonnegut appearing as the narrator/creator of the work, explaining why and how he makes this world as it is, changing things when and as he sees fit, and even being surprised by events.

The novel also makes use of intertextuality with Vonnegut&#x27;s other works. In addition to Kilgore Trout, characters from other Vonnegut books which appear here include Eliot Rosewater and Rabo Karabekian. Rosewater was the main character in &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot; (1965) and a minor character in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1969), while Karabekian later became the main character in &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (1987). Hoover&#x27;s secretary, Francine Pefko, previously appeared in &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; (1963), where she performed secretarial duties at General Forge and Foundry, in Ilium, New York. (Pefko also appears in &quot;Fubar&quot;, a story released posthumously in &quot;Look at the Birdie&quot;.) Vonnegut uses the name &quot;Khashdrahr Miasma&quot; for a minor character, in reference to a character in &quot;Player Piano&quot;. The vicious guard dog, Kazak, was Winston Niles Rumfoord&#x27;s pet in &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; (1959) and Selena MacIntosh&#x27;s guide dog in &quot;Galápagos&quot; (1985). Many of Midland City&#x27;s inhabitants reappear in &quot;Deadeye Dick&quot; (1982), which locates the city in Ohio.

== Background ==

=== Title ===
The title, taken from the well-known slogan for Wheaties breakfast cereal, crops up in a key scene late in the novel when a waitress, apparently ironically, says &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; each time she serves a customer a martini. Vonnegut, in his typical ironic manner, mocks the legal and copyright systems as he notes meticulously that &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; is a registered trademark of General Mills, Inc. for its breakfast cereal products, and that his use of the term is not &quot;intended to disparage their fine products.&quot;

Vonnegut refers to himself as &quot;Philboyd Studge&quot; in the preface, a name which he claims his friend Knox Burger associated with cumbersome writing. The name appears to have been borrowed from a short story by Edwardian satirist Saki. (&quot;&quot;, describes the success of the eponymous breakfast food through bizarrely counter-intuitive advertising.)

=== Doubts about publication ===
According to a January 1971 article in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;Vonnegut says repeatedly he is through writing novels... After &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, Vonnegut began work on a novel called &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, about a world in which everyone but a single man, the narrator, is a robot. He gave it up, however, and it remains unfinished. I asked him why, and he said, &#x27;Because it was a piece of ----. This view persisted, with Harlan Ellison claiming that Vonnegut&#x27;s submission in the 1972 short-story anthology &quot;Again, Dangerous Visions&quot;, would be &quot;the last new piece of fiction you will ever read by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.&quot; After the publication of &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, Vonnegut stopped publishing short stories, and many believed he had given up writing altogether, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; book review stating Vonnegut&#x27;s persona gives up fiction before our very eyes... When he self-destructs himself as a novelist by first warning us in the middle of his book that &#x27;Once I understood what was making America such a dangerous, unhappy nation of people who had nothing to do with real life, I resolved to shun story-telling.&#x27;

In the preface, Vonnegut states that as he reached his fiftieth birthday he felt a need to &quot;clear his head of all the junk in there&quot;—which includes the various subjects of his drawings, and the characters from his past novels and stories. To this end, he sprinkles plot descriptions for Trout&#x27;s stories throughout the novel, illustrates the book with his own simple felt-tip pen drawings, and includes a number of characters from his other novels and short stories.

== Reception ==
&quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; spent a total of 56 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, 28 weeks for the hardcover edition and 28 for the paperback edition. The novel was panned by &quot;The New York Times&quot; but received positive reviews from &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. Vonnegut himself was unhappy with &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; and gave it a C grade on a report card he made of his published work which was included in his 1981 collection &quot;Palm Sunday&quot;. However, it remains one of his best-known and most influential works.

== Adaptation ==
In 1999, the novel was made into a film of the same name, starring Bruce Willis, Albert Finney, Nick Nolte and Omar Epps. The movie was widely panned by critics and never went into wide release.

<doc id="303444" wikidata="Q386773" url="?curid=303444" title="Korg">
<text>, founded as Keio Electronic Laboratories, is a Japanese multinational corporation that manufactures electronic musical instruments, audio processors and guitar pedals, recording equipment, and electronic tuners. Under the Vox brand name, they also manufacture guitar amplifiers and electric guitars.

==History==

KORG was founded in 1962 in Tokyo by Tsutomu Kato and Tadashi Osanai as &quot;Keio Gijutsu Kenkyujo Ltd.&quot;. It later became because its offices were located near the Keio train line in Tokyo and Keio can be formed by combining the first letters of Kato and Osanai. Before founding the company, Kato ran a nightclub. Osanai, a Tokyo University graduate and noted accordionist, regularly performed at Kato&#x27;s club accompanied by a Wurlitzer Sideman rhythm machine. Dissatisfied with the rhythm machine, Osanai convinced Kato to finance his efforts to build a better one.

The company&#x27;s first product was an electro-mechanical rhythm device, the Disc Rotary Electric Auto Rhythm machine, Donca Matic DA-20, released in 1963. The name &quot;Donca&quot; was an onomatopoeic reference to the sound the rhythm machine made. Buoyed by the success of the DA-20, Keio released a solid-state version of the Rhythm machine, the Donca matic DE-20, in 1966.

In 1967, Kato was approached by Fumio Mieda, an engineer seeking to build keyboards. Impressed with Mieda&#x27;s enthusiasm, Kato asked him to build a prototype, and 18 months later Mieda returned with a programmable organ. Keio sold the organ under the name KORG, created by using the first letter of each founder&#x27;s name plus &quot;RG&quot; from their planned emphasis on products targeted for the organ market (emphasizing the letters R and G in the word &quot;organ&quot;). In 1970 the firm name changed again to Keio Giken Kogyo Inc. (京王技研工業株式会社).

Keio&#x27;s organ products were successful throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. Concerned about competition from other organ manufacturers, Kato decided to use the organ technology to build a keyboard for the then-niche synthesizer market. Keio&#x27;s first synthesizer, the KORG miniKORG, was released in 1973.

During the 1970s, KORG&#x27;s synthesizer line was divided into instruments for the hobbyist, and large expensive patchable instruments such as the PS series. In the early 1980s, KORG branched into digital pianos.
KORG is credited with a number of innovations. The &quot;key transpose&quot; function was Kato&#x27;s idea after a singer at his club needed her accompaniment played in a lower key, which the accompanist wasn&#x27;t able to do. KORG was the first company to feature effects on a synthesizer, and the first to use a &quot;sample + synthesis&quot; sound design. The M1 workstation, released in 1988, sold over 250,000 units, making it the bestselling synthesizer ever at that time.

===Relationship with Yamaha===
Yamaha Corporation has always been a major partner of KORG, supplying them with circuitry and mechanical parts.

In 1987, shortly before the release of the M1 Music Workstation, Yamaha acquired a controlling interest in KORG. The takeover of the company was amicable, with Kato drawing up the terms, and the two companies continued to independently develop their product lines and compete in the marketplace.

In 1989, KORG recruited the design team from Sequential Circuits as they were relieved of their duties by then-Sequential owner Yamaha. 

In 1993, after 5 successful years under Yamaha&#x27;s control, Kato had sufficient funds to repurchase most of the Yamaha shares.

===Recent history===

KORG has since diversified into digital effects, tuners, recording equipment, electronic hand percussion, and software instruments.

In 1992, KORG acquired Vox, then primarily a manufacturer of guitar amplifiers.

KORG was the exclusive distributor of Marshall Amplification products in the US for decades. This arrangement ended in 2010.

Kato died of cancer on 15 March 2011.

The new line of more accessible digital synthesizers, including the wavestate, modwave and opsix, are featuring a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3.

In September 2022, Korg bought Darkglass Electronics.

<text>Gwoyeu Romatzyh ( ; GR) is a system for writing Standard Chinese using the Latin alphabet. It was primarily conceived by Yuen Ren Chao (1892–1982), who led a group of linguists on the National Languages Committee in refining the system between 1925 and 1926. In September 1928, it was adopted by the Republic of China as the national romanization system for Standard Chinese. GR indicates the four tones of Standard Chinese by varying the spelling of syllables, a method originally proposed by team member Lin Yutang (1895–1976). Distinct sets of spellings are assigned to syllables in GR according to particular rules. This differs from approaches used by other systems to denote tones, like the numerals used by the earlier Wade–Giles system, or the diacritics used by the later Hanyu Pinyin system.

Despite support from linguists both in China and overseas—including some early proponents who hoped it would eventually replace Chinese characters altogether—GR never achieved widespread use among the Chinese public, who generally lacked interest in the system or viewed it with hostility due to its complex spelling rules. In places where GR had gained traction, it was eventually replaced—largely by Hanyu Pinyin (or simply &quot;pinyin&quot;), which became the international standard during the 1980s, and itself follows principles originally introduced by GR. Widespread adoption of the system was also hindered by its narrow calibration to the Beijing dialect, during a period when China lacked the strong central government needed to impose use of a national spoken language.

From 1942 to 2000, a small number of reference works published in Hong Kong and overseas also used the system, and Chao would use it throughout his later linguistics work, including in his most influential publications. Chao said that tonal spelling could possibly aid students of Chinese learning to articulate tones. However, later study of tonal accuracy in students has not substantiated Chao&#x27;s hypothesis.

== History ==
=== Background ===

The Republic of China was founded in 1912, following the overthrow of the imperial Qing dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution. During the final decades of the Qing, liberal reformers among the Chinese intelligentsia had begun seeking ways to modernize the country&#x27;s institutions. Proposed language reforms included the replacement of Literary Chinese as China&#x27;s primary written language with a written vernacular that more closely reflected ordinary speech. Meanwhile, even though Mandarin was spoken in an official capacity by the imperial bureaucracy in the north of the country, most of China&#x27;s population spoke mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese; many also saw adoption of a single spoken dialect nationwide as being necessary for China&#x27;s modernization. The tumultuous Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation held in 1913 resulted in the adoption of a &quot;national pronunciation&quot; designed as a compromise featuring characteristics of numerous varieties spoken across China; however, this meant a form of speech that was itself artificial and spoken by no one, and the struggling Beiyang government had few means to promote its use among the general population. 

In 1916, the linguist Yuen Ren Chao (1892–1982) was among the first to propose—in an English-language essay co-authored with the poet Hu Shih (1891–1962)—that Chinese characters should be replaced with an alphabet designed to write the sounds of a national form of Chinese. By 1921, Chao had joined the National Languages Committee, and was tasked with the creation of audio recordings demonstrating the new national pronunciation, which he did in New York City. However, it had become increasingly clear that the Republican government was not capable of promoting the national pronunciation, and during the 1920s efforts shifted instead towards basing the national language on Mandarin as spoken in Beijing. While Chao had supported the compromise national pronunciation, factors including his correspondence with the prominent linguist Bernhard Karlgren (1889–1978) encouraged his work on a new romanization system attuned to the Beijing dialect. Tonal spelling, Gwoyeu Romatzyh&#x27;s most distinctive feature, was first suggested to Yuen Ren Chao by Lin Yutang (1895–1976); by 1922, Chao had already established the main principles of the system. During 1925 and 1926, its details were developed by a team of five linguists under the auspices of the National Languages Committee: Chao, Lin, Li Jinxi (1890–1978), Qian Xuantong (1887–1939), and (; 1875–1960).

=== Official status and adoption ===
On 26 September 1928, Gwoyeu Romatzyh was officially adopted by the Republic&#x27;s nationalist government—led at the time by the Kuomintang (KMT). The corresponding entry in Chao&#x27;s diary, written in GR, reads (&quot;G.R. was officially announced on September 26. Hooray!!!&quot;) It was intended for GR to be used alongside the existing bopomofo system, hence its designation as the &quot;Second Pattern of the National Alphabet&quot;. Both systems were used to indicate the revised standard of pronunciation in the new official &quot;Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use&quot; of 1932. The designers of Gwoyeu Romatzyh generally represented what has been termed the &quot;Romanization&quot; movement, one among several interested in large-scale reform of the Chinese writing system; many within the Romanization movement sought to adopt Gwoyeu Romatzyh as a primary, practical script for the language. During the 1930s, two short-lived attempts were made to teach Gwoyeu Romatzyh to railway workers and peasants in Henan and Shandong. Support for GR was confined to a small number of trained linguists and sinologists, including Qian Xuantong and Luo Changpei in China and Walter Simon in England. During this period, GR faced increasing hostility because of the complexity of its tonal spelling. A competing &quot;Latinization&quot; movement coalesced around leaders like Qu Qiubai (1899–1935), and the Latinxua Sin Wenz systems—often identifying with the Communists, and likewise opposing the KMT. Conversely, Karlgren criticized GR for its lack of phonetic rigour. Ultimately, like Latinxua Sin Wenz, GR failed to gain widespread support, principally because the &quot;national&quot; language was too narrowly based on the Beijing dialect: &quot;a sufficiently precise and strong language norm had not yet become a reality in China&quot;.

Historical use of Gwoyeu Romatzyh is reflected in the official spelling of the name for the province of Shaanxi, which distinguishes it from that of neighbouring Shanxi; these names differ only by tone, and their systematic pinyin romanizations would be identical without the use of diacritics. The Warring States period state of Wey is often spelled as such to distinguish it from the more prominent state of Wei, whose names are homophonous in Mandarin, but were likely distinct in Old Chinese. Several prominent Chinese people have used GR to transliterate their names, such as the mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern; however, neither Chao nor Lin did. Following the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, GR was practically unused on the mainland. In 1958, the Chinese government officially replaced it with Hanyu Pinyin, which had been developed by a team led by Zhou Youguang (1906–2017) over the previous two years. Pinyin is now the predominant system and an international standard used by the United Nations, the Library of Congress, and the International Organization for Standardization, as well as by most students learning Standard Chinese. GR saw considerable use in Taiwan during the 20th century, alongside Hanyu Pinyin, the autochthonous Tongyong Pinyin, and the bopomofo syllabary. It was also used there as a pronunciation aid until the 1970s, as in the monolingual &quot;&quot; dictionary. In 1986, the Taiwanese government officially replaced GR with the modified Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II system.

== Description ==


=== Basic first tone forms ===
An important feature of Gwoyeu Romatzyh, inspired by its precursors and later adopted by pinyin, is the use of consonant pairs with a voicing distinction from Latin to instead represent the aspiration distinction present in Chinese. For example, and represent and , compared to and in Wade–Giles. Another distinctive feature is Gwoyeu Romatzyh&#x27;s use of , , and to represent two different phonetic series. When followed by , these letters correspond to the alveolo-palatal series written in pinyin as , , and ; otherwise, they correspond to the retroflex series written in pinyin as , , and .

Other notable features of Gwoyeu Romatzyh orthography include:
* represents the close front rounded vowel , which in pinyin is spelled either as or depending on context
* Final represents the allophone
*: Examples: GR and correspond to pinyin and respectively.
* corresponds to pinyin , with being reserved to indicate the second tone. The most important use of or is as a rhotacization suffix.
*: Example: ← + for (; &#x27;a little&#x27;).
* A number of frequently occurring morphemes have abbreviated spellings in GR
*: Examples: compared to pinyin , for , for , for , and for 

=== Tonal spelling ===
By default, the basic Gwoyeu Romatzyh spelling described above is used for syllables with the first tone. The basic form is then modified to indicate tones 2, 3, and 4. This is accomplished in one of three ways, with the concise first method used whenever possible:
* either a letter is changed to another letter resembling it in sound, for example to either or 
* or a letter is doubled
* or a silent or is added after the vowel
Syllables beginning with a sonorant—i.e. pinyin , , , and —are an exception: the basic form is then used for tone 2, and tone 1 is indicated by adding an after the initial letter.
=== Word segmentation ===
An important principle of Gwoyeu Romatzyh is that text should use spaces as word dividers. The concept of a &quot;word&quot; as understood in Western linguistics has been adapted for Chinese comparatively recently. The basic unit of speech is popularly thought to be the syllable; in Chinese, each syllable almost always represents a morpheme—a language&#x27;s basic unit of meaning—and written Chinese characters generally correspond with these morpheme–syllables. Characters are written without spaces between words. However, most words used in modern written vernacular Chinese are two-syllable compounds; Chao reflected this in GR&#x27;s orthography by grouping syllables in words together without hyphenation, as in Wade–Giles (e.g. ).

== Publication history ==

Chao used Gwoyeu Romatzyh in four influential works:
* &quot;Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese&quot; (1947; in collaboration with Yang Lien-sheng)
* &quot;Mandarin Primer&quot;originally used in the Army Specialized Training Program at the Harvard University School for Overseas Administration from 1943 to 1944, and subsequently in civilian courses; republished in 1948. It was written &quot;to supply the advanced student of spoken Chinese with reading matter which he can actually use in his speech&quot;. The work consists of three volumes of Chinese text with facing GR romanization, including audio recordings of dialogue, fragments of an autobiography, two plays, and a translation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;.
* &quot;A Grammar of Spoken Chinese&quot; (1968)
* &quot;&quot; (1968)in this context, &quot;sayable&quot; means &quot;colloquial&quot;, as opposed to the written vernacular Chinese often read by students.

In 1942, Walter Simon introduced Gwoyeu Romatzyh to English-speaking sinologists in a pamphlet entitled &quot;The New Official Chinese Latin Script&quot;. Over the remainder of the 1940s he published a series of textbooks and readers, as well as a Chinese-English dictionary using GR. His son Harry Simon later went on to use GR in papers he published on Chinese linguistics.

In 1960, Y. C. Liu, who was a colleague of Walter Simon at SOAS, published &quot;Fifty Chinese Stories&quot;, comprising selections from the Chinese classics. It was a parallel text featuring the original Literary Chinese as well as vernacular translation, in addition to GR and romanized Japanese transliterations prepared by Simon.

&quot;Lin Yutang&#x27;s Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage&quot; (1972) incorporated a number of novelties, which included a simplified romanization scheme derived from GR, though Lin eliminated most of the spelling rules.

The first 3 issues of &#x27; magazine (1982–1989; ) also used a simplified version of Gwoyeu Romatzyh. The fourth issue, now rendered as &#x27;, used a system that adapted pinyin to use tonal spelling akin to GR.

== Pedagogy ==
Chao believed that the benefit of tonal spelling was to make the use of tones in Chinese more salient to learners:

For example, it may be easier to memorize the difference between GR &#x27;Beijing&#x27; and &#x27;background&#x27; than the pinyin and . One study conducted at the University of Oregon from 1991 to 1993 compared the results of teaching elementary level Chinese using either pinyin or GR to two matched groups of students; the study ultimately concluded that &quot;GR did not lead to significantly greater accuracy in tonal production&quot;.

<text>Thai Airways International plc () is the flag carrier airline of Thailand. Formed in 1961 as a joint venture between SAS and Thai Airways Company, the airline has its corporate headquarters in Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, Chatuchak district, Bangkok, and primarily operates from Suvarnabhumi Airport. THAI is a founding member of the Star Alliance. The airline is the second-largest shareholder of the low-cost carrier Nok Air with a 8.91 per cent stake (2021), and it launched a regional carrier under the name Thai Smile in the middle of 2012 using new Airbus A320 aircraft. In 2023, it was announced that Thai Smile would be merged back into Thai Airways.

Operating from its primary hub at Bangkok&#x27;s Suvarnabhumi Airport, THAI currently serves 51 international and 10 domestic destinations using a fleet of 79 aircraft consisting of wide-body and narrow-body aircraft from both Boeing and Airbus with 89 aircraft on order as of October 2024, with plans to increase its fleet to 143 aircraft by 2029. Currently THAI&#x27;s route network is dominated by flights to cities in Europe, Asia and Oceania flying to 30 countries as of August 2024 including 9 domestic routes. THAI was the first Asia-Pacific airline to serve Heathrow Airport. Among Asia-Pacific carriers, the company has one of the largest passenger operations in Europe serving 11 airports. As of 2013, services between Bangkok and Los Angeles were served via Incheon International Airport near Seoul until the airline ended its flights to the United States on 25 October 2015. As of the end of 2019, 1,438 of its 22,054 employees were pilots.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Thai Airways International was founded in 1960 as a joint venture between Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), which held a 30 percent share of the new company valued at two million Thai baht, and Thailand&#x27;s domestic carrier, Thai Airways Company (). SAS provided operational, managerial, and marketing expertise, with training aimed at building a fully independent national airline in the shortest possible time. Thai nationals were gradually able to assume full managerial responsibility and the number of expatriate staff duly decreased, with expatriates accounting for less than one percent of staff based in Thailand in 1987.

The airline&#x27;s first intercontinental services using Douglas DC-8s started in 1971 to Australia, and then to Europe the following year. A number of the larger Douglas DC-10 wide-body tri-jets was acquired in the late-1970s. Services to North America commenced in 1980.

On 1 April 1977, after 17 years of capital participation by SAS, the Thai government bought out the remaining 15 percent of SAS-owned shares and Thai became a state owned enterprise of the Thai government. As of 22 May 2020, the Thai Ministry of Finance is no longer the majority shareholder, having reduced its holding to 47.86 percent from 51.03 percent.

===1980s and 1990s: merger with Thai Airways Company===
On 6 December 1987, services to Auckland in New Zealand were inaugurated. On 1 April 1988, then-Prime Minister Gen. Prem Tinsulanonda, merged the international and domestic operations of the two companies to form the present company, Thai Airways International, to have a single national carrier. On 25 June 1991, the reconfigured company listed its shares on the Stock Exchange of Thailand and offered them to the public. The Thai public offering of shares is the largest ever undertaken in the country.

In 1997 Thai Airways planned a privatization program, the first in Thai history.

On 14 May 1997, THAI, along with Lufthansa, Air Canada, SAS, and United Airlines, founded the world&#x27;s first and largest airline alliance, Star Alliance.

The genesis of Thai&#x27;s later financial difficulties has been attributed to actions taken in the 1990s when Thai Airways began &quot;buying every type of plane that was being manufactured.&quot; Different models meant that the airline had to train an army of technicians to keep differing airframes and engines from both General Electric and Rolls-Royce airworthy, significantly inflating maintenance costs.

===2000s: Airline brand renewal and financial difficulties===

In the first decade of the 21st century, Thai Airways continued its route network expansion with new services to Chengdu, Busan, Chennai, Xiamen, Milan, Moscow, Islamabad, Hyderabad, Johannesburg, and Oslo.

Using the Airbus A340-500 fleet it acquired in 2005, Thai commenced non-stop flights between Bangkok and New York, its first non-stop service to North America. The airline later converted an existing one-stop service (via Tokyo) to Los Angeles into a non-stop flight using the same aircraft type. Citing very high fuel costs, Thai discontinued the New York service in July 2008, even though the airline had been able to fill 80 percent of the seats. The service to Los Angeles was again reverted to one-stop service via Seoul on 1 May 2012, leaving the airline without a non-stop service between Thailand and North America. The A340s used were phased out, replaced by the Boeing 777-200ER for the Bangkok–Seoul–Los-Angeles route. Although the previous A340 used for non-stop services was not subject to ETOPS, the phasing in of the 777 with one-stop service (with the 330 minute rule) would be indefinite for years to come; the airline had no plans to pursue newer North America destinations (e.g., Houston) or purchase the Boeing 747-8 for transpacific routes since is operating the Airbus A380.

The 2000s also saw Thai expand its Thai airport network beyond its Bangkok hub. The airline launched non-stop flights from Phuket to Tokyo–Narita, Seoul–Incheon and Hong Kong.

During the late-2000s, Thai&#x27;s growth was hampered by a combination of internal and external factors, including a spike in fuel prices, domestic political conflict in Thailand, and the global economic crisis of the late-2000s. In 2008, after achieving profitability for the previous 40 years, Thai recorded a loss for the first time in its history of around 21 billion baht (US$675 million). The airline blamed high fuel costs and Thailand&#x27;s political turmoil. As of Q2 2009, after a series of restructuring initiatives, including a two-year deferral of its Airbus A380 deliveries, the carrier returned to a net profit of 2.5 billion baht.

Thai&#x27;s need for reform became evident in the first decade of the 21st century, but reforms, when they came, were invariably cut short. Thai&#x27;s problems were threefold: ineffective leadership at the top; inexperienced boards; and a coddled union. Piyasvasti Amranand took Thai&#x27;s helm in October 2009 after serving as energy minister. At Thai, he is still regarded as a true reformer, imposing salary cuts for senior executives as part of his drive to reduce costs. He was voted out by the board in 2012 for what may have been political reasons. The board of directors was, after the 2014 Thai coup d&#x27;état, packed with military brass. Five civilian members were purged and replaced with five Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) generals, as was the board&#x27;s chairman. The appointments ended Thai&#x27;s policy of only appointing technocrats to the board. Three RTAF generals remain on the 2020 board; they have no experience running listed companies or restructuring loss-making airlines. Concomitantly, employees at Thai enjoyed an overprotected status. Salary increases based on length of employment led to senior captains earning more than the CEO.

===2010s: Fleet renewal and route expansion===

While celebrating its fiftieth anniversary in 2010, Thai, led by its president, Piyasvasti Amranand, drafted new plans for the airline&#x27;s future, including aircraft fleet renewal and an upgrade of existing services. Thai placed orders for a number of aircraft, including the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, and it launched a refurbishment of its Boeing 747 and 777 cabins. Mindful of rising fuel costs, the airline phased-out its most inefficient aircraft, including its Airbus A340-500s. The airline took delivery of its first Airbus A380 aircraft in the second half of 2012, intending to eventually deploy the aircraft on its core European routes.

THAI resumed network expansion with the resumption of flights to Brussels, in addition to a new non-stop flight from Stockholm and Copenhagen to Phuket. At the same time, the Greek debt crisis caused Thai to suspend its services to Athens.

Thai expects to be the first carrier in Asia to fly commercial flights using biofuels. The carrier launched the initiative with experimental flights in December 2011 as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility program, otherwise known as &quot;Travel Green&quot;. Thai hopes to stimulate sustained biofuel production in Thailand by working with Thai government agencies and regional corporate partners, such as PTT Public Company Limited. The effort aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in regional air travel as well as position Thailand to be the &quot;bio hub&quot; of Asia.

In January 2015 Thai Airways total fleet 102 Airplane 

In April 2015, after an audit of the Thai Department of Civil Aviation, Thailand was downgraded from Category 1 to Category 2 due to negative audit results from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). On 1 December 2015, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced their reassessment of the safety rating for Thailand, downgrading it from a Category 1 to Category 2 country. The FAA stated, &quot;U.S. and Thai aviation officials have a long-standing cooperative relationship and both our countries work continuously to meet the challenge of ensuring aviation safety. A Category 2 International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) rating means that the country either lacks laws or regulations necessary to oversee air carriers in accordance with minimum international standards, or its civil aviation authority—a body equivalent to the FAA for aviation safety matters—is deficient in one or more areas, such as technical expertise, trained personnel, record-keeping, or inspection procedures. With a Category 2 rating, Thailand&#x27;s air carriers can continue existing routes to the United States but they won&#x27;t be allowed to establish new routes to the United States.&quot;

The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) declined to blacklist any Thai carriers following a review of certain carriers in November 2015. Thai later received third country operator (TCO) certification from the EU, effective 15 December 2015, authorizing the carrier to continue flying to the EU for the foreseeable future.

In July 2015, Thai announced the planned cancellation of service to Los Angeles after 25 October 2015, marking the end of US service.

In June 2016, as a result of its restructuring plan, Thai announced it would commence thrice-weekly Tehran service. However, the service ended on 28 February 2018. The airline also considered a return to the US using Boeing 787-9 by 2017. However, Charamporn Jothikastira, THAI president, turned down the possibility of returning to Los Angeles or New York City due to losses in the past. Instead, Thai considered other cities such as San Francisco and Seattle. While Thai Smile, its subsidiary, planned new regional routes such as Cebu, Medan, Surabaya, Chandigarh, Shantou and Tianjin.

In August 2016, Thai introduced a new route network management system. Following implementation, flight schedules were synchronized, allowing international passengers to transit via Bangkok Suvarnabhumi more conveniently. Thai planned to adjust thirteen route schedules, mainly in Japan, Australia, and India. Routes to Perth and Brisbane were announced.

=== 2020s ===
In February 2023, it has been announced that subsidiary Thai Smile will be dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Thai Airways by 2024 in an effort to reduce losses. The last flight of Thai Smile occurred on December 31, 2023. 

In November 2024, regulators announced that Thailand is expected to regain its Category 1 (CAT 1) safety rating in early 2024, which would allow Thai Airways and other carriers to operate flights between Thailand and the United States. On 21 November 2024, it was reported that Thai Airways will resume its flight to Brussels, Belgium beginning 1 December 2024 after a 4-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

==Branding==

===Safety video===

The current safety video was introduced in 2018. Sueb Nakhasathien Foundation president Rungsit Kanjanavanit stated his belief that the video does not sufficiently reflect Thai culture as the animals and flowers used are more commonly found in South America.

===The launch of Thai Smile===
As part of THAI&#x27;s broader growth strategy in the region, THAI launched a regional carrier with light-premium services, Thai Smile, which operates the narrow-bodied Airbus A320-200 on regional and domestic routes. The new airline began commercial operations in July 2012, after its first A320s were received. As of September 2020, Thai Smile files to 31 destinations and a fleet of 20 aircraft with Chiang Mai International Airport being its focus city.

By September 2016, Thai Smile, Thai&#x27;s subsidiary announced new services to Gaya, Varanasi, Jaipur, and Lucknow in India marking the expansion of Thai&#x27;s Asian network.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, Thai Smile vowed to resume its suspended routes and Thai&#x27;s terminated regional routes to Da Nang, Kota Kinabalu, Luang Prabang and Mandalay. Also the airline has considered launching new services to Hangzhou and Zhengzhou. Due to the financial complications caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Thai Smile ceased operations in 2023 as a part of the financial reconstruction. All the Thai Smile aircraft are to be reabsorbed by THAI Airways.

=== Subsidiaries ===

==== Thai Catering ====

Thai Catering began operations on 20 April 1960 by renting out a hangar at Don Mueang Airport for airline meal production. The current headquarters are located at Suvarnabhumi Airport in a 120,000 square meters facility and is able to produce 87,000 meals per day. The facility at Don Mueang Airport remains in use as a bakery production facility, food supply for airline lounges, as well as food production for banquet services and Thai Catering restaurants in domestic airports around the country. Another facility is open for producing food for flights departing from in Krabi Airport. Thai Catering received the Best Economy Class Onboard Catering Award from Skytrax between 2011-2014 and 2016-2018.

In 1995, after reporting losses within the subsidiary after the airline released a new policy of not serving food outside meal service times, Puff and Pie Bakery House was established and its first branch opened on 19 November 1997 near Don Mueang Airport with an aim to increase revenue for the airline. A total of 19 Puff and Pie Branches can be found in Bangkok, primarily found in government offices and hospitals, providing bakery items and microwaveable meals from Thai Catering. In 2021, Puff and Pie cooperated with Inthanin Coffee, a subsidiary of Bang Chak Corporation, with the aim of expanding the distribution of its products to at least 100 branches of Inthanin Coffee in Bang Chak gas stations by 2022.

==Liveries and logos==
In 2006, Thai Airways moved its hub to the new Suvarnabhumi Airport. Coinciding with the arrival of new aircraft in the mid-2000s, as well as its new hub in Bangkok, the airline launched a brand renewal by introducing new aircraft livery, new aircraft seating, and revamped ground and air service.

The logo on the tail fin shows the traditional Thai greeting gesture (wai), and the curves represents traditional Thai architecture of the decorative structure called lamyong that are common on temple roofs to distinguish different tiers in the structure. The gold represents the colour of Thai Temples, while the magenta signifies magnolia blossom, where finally the purple represents the Thai Orchid - a colour that is used throughout the airline from uniforms to interior cabin colour schemes.

===Special liveries===
In 1999, THAI first painted the Royal Barge Suphannahong aircraft livery on its Boeing 747-400 (HS-TGJ) aircraft, royally bestowed the name “Haripunchai” on the occasion of the Sixth Cycle Birthday of King Rama IX. This also applied on another Boeing 747-400 (HS-TGO, &quot;Bowonrangsi&quot;), making both aircraft identical.

To mark the Coronation of the King Rama X Thai Airways used a Boeing 777-300 (HS-TKF) to put the Suphannahong Royal Barge as its aircraft livery.

==Corporate affairs==


===Business trends===
The key trends of Thai Airways are (as at the financial year ending December 31):

As of October 2019, Thai&#x27;s accumulated debt amounted to more than 100 billion baht, prompting a deputy transport minister to question &quot;...how serious the airline&#x27;s executives were in dealing with the worsening financial situation.&quot; Thai reported a net loss of 4.68 billion baht in the third quarter of 2019 and a 10.91 billion baht net loss for the first nine months of 2019. Thai&#x27;s president lamented that, &quot;...such losses were normal for airlines amid fierce competition and price dumping to win customers,&quot; a statement contradicted by the performance of other airlines in the region such as VietJet Air.

At the commencement of 2014, Thai was subject to a rumor that the company would declare bankruptcy in May 2014. Listed on the Thai stock exchange, the company was formerly a state enterprise—until 22 May 2020—in which the finance ministry held a stake of up to 51 per cent. In a statement to the media, Chokchai Panyayong, the airways&#x27; senior executive vice-president and acting president, stated: &quot;Thai has never once defaulted. Despite its loss in the third quarter of last year, the company still has high liquidity and has a clear plan for debt repayment.&quot; He further explained that the carrier&#x27;s loss of 6.35 billion baht in the third quarter of last year was the result of the company&#x27;s unsuccessful plan to attract more customers. Thai&#x27;s financial loss for 2014 was reported to be at 15.6 billion baht (US$479 million), 3.6 billion baht higher than the previous year. Thai blamed declining tourist arrivals from North Asia owing to political unrest in Thailand during the year, but capacity figures from Flightglobal&#x27;s Innovata Network Data service suggest that Europe was probably an even bigger drain on the bottom line during the year.

===2018 recovery plan===
Thai&#x27;s new management team has set itself the goal of returning to &quot;sustainable profitability&quot; by 2022 as well as joining the ranks of the world&#x27;s top five airlines. The centerpiece of its turnaround plan is its proposed 100 billion baht purchase of 23 new aircraft. THAI&#x27;s chairman pointed to its aging fleet as being expensive to maintain. THAI&#x27;s 89 aircraft have an average age of 9.3 years compared with competitor Singapore Airlines average age of 7.6 years. Thai&#x27;s chairman said the company has not yet determined &quot;...what aircraft and type we need to buy because we have yet to finalize financing.&quot;

Thai&#x27;s recovery plans include teaming up with state enterprises Airports of Thailand PCL (AOT) and Krung Thai Bank (KTB) to help drive the carrier to profitability. The team&#x27;s &quot;first task&quot; is to deliver more tourists to 55 &quot;second-tier&quot; provinces. The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) will assist the team by creating a new campaign, &quot;More Local&quot;, to drive tourism to less visited corners of the nation. AOT, which operates Thailand&#x27;s six international airports, will invest 220 billion baht in infrastructure to increase airport capacity from 2018&#x27;s 80 million passengers to 185 million in ten years. KTB&#x27;s contribution to the effort consists of creating new payment solutions for tourists and ramping up travel promotions.

===Management Issues===

Political interference, corruption and abuse of authority have been persistent issues in Thai&#x27;s management. Speaking at the World Economic Forum on East Asia, former president Piyasvasti Amranand, who had been abruptly dismissed in May 2012, cited Thai&#x27;s procurement of A340-500s (three of which had since been grounded) as examples of mismanagement influenced by corruption and political meddling, resulting in operational losses.

At an extraordinary board meeting held on 27 March 2020, Chakkrit Parapuntakul, Second Vice Chairman, was appointed as acting president of Thai Airways effective 11 April 2020.

===Debt restructuring===
The Thai government stepped in to provide THAI with a 50bn baht loan guarantee in April 2020 and reaffirmed the airline&#x27;s status as a state enterprise. The move was taken in the absence of a &quot;get well&quot; plan. A week later, the bailout loan was withdrawn and the cabinet replaced it with a plan to have Thai file with the Central Bankruptcy Court for debt restructuring. As of March 2021, the airline is 410 billion baht in debt and 13,000 creditors. This include customers who simply bought tickets and not being refunded by Thai Airways. Most of those customers have waited for close to 2 years and still not being refunded although Thai Airways keeps selling new tickets. Its main creditors are the state-owned Krungthai and Government Savings Banks. The 50bn baht loan it had sought from the government would have kept it afloat for only five months. An 80bn baht capital infusion would have been needed later.

Thai Airways lost its state enterprise status on 22 May 2020 when the Finance Ministry sold off a 3.17% stake in Thai to the Vayupak 1 Fund, thus reducing its former majority shareholding to 47.86%. Thai has appealed to the government for help to forestall the seizure of its aircraft by foreign creditors. The airline sought government help because it has contracts and legal obligations that can only be resolved by the state. These issues must be dealt with before Thai enters debt rehabilitation. Concurrently, investigators are looking into anomalies in Thai ticket sales in 2019. The Transport Ministry reported that Thai ticket sales and freight revenues totalled 140bn baht in 2019, yet Thai had 25.4m passengers at an average ticket price of 6,081 baht, a total of 154.5bn baht. A senior prosecutor, Wanchai Roujanavong, had earlier warned that, &quot;...the proposed rehabilitation of Thai Airways International [is] the opening of a Pandora&#x27;s Box, which will expose extensive corruption in the ailing national flag carrier which has hitherto been hidden from the public.&quot;

On September 14, 2020, the Central Bankruptcy Court has given approval for THAI to enter rehabilitation. THAI has submitted the rehabilitation plan on 2 March 2021. The airline nominated the airline&#x27;s independent director Piyasvasti Amranand and Chakkrit Parapuntakul, the company&#x27;s second vice chairman as rehabilitation plan administrators, while the creditors will meet on 12 May 2021 to vote on the rehabilitation plan, and the court is expected to decide whether to endorse the plan between June and July 2021.

On 15 June 2021, the Central Bankruptcy Court set the hearing to read out the court&#x27;s order with regard to the consideration of THAI&#x27;s Business Rehabilitation Plan. After receiving two objections against the Business Rehabilitation Plan of THAI, the Planner&#x27;s clarification, and the official receiver&#x27;s opinion regarding several issues, the Central Bankruptcy Court granted an order to approve THAI&#x27;s Business Rehabilitation Plan as well as the amended plan following the acceptance resolution of the creditors&#x27; meeting on 19 May 2021. As a result, the Plan Administrator nominations whose names were proposed according to the Business Rehabilitation Plan and the amended plan, i.e. Mr. Piyasvasti Amranand, Mr. Pornchai Thiravet, Mr. Siri Jirapongphan, Mr. Kraisorn Barameeauychai, and Mr. Chansin Treenuchagron, has become the Plan Administrators who are authorized to operate THAI&#x27;s business and implement the plan.

On 1 July 2022, the Plan Administrator submitted the petition for plan amendment to the official receiver. On 1 September 2022, the Official Receiver held the creditors’ meeting via electronic means (e-Meeting). The creditors who hold 78.59 percent of the total claims of the creditors, who attended the meeting and cast votes, accepted the amendment of the Business Reorganization Plan that the Plan Administrator submitted to the Official Receiver. On 20 October 2022, the Central Bankruptcy Court issued an order approving the proposal for the Plan amendment of the Company.

On 21 October 2022, THAI informed the resignation of the Plan Administrator, effective as of October 21, 2022 as follows: 1. Mr. Kraisorn Barameeauychai 2. Mr. Siri Jirapongphan

On 17 May 2023, Thai Airways International Public Company Limited (THAI) held a creditor committee’s meeting that reached a resolution in favor of the company’s restructuring of business operation in aviation as proposed by the Plan Administrators and THAI management.

=== Corruption ===
On 20 August 2020, then Deputy Transport Minister Thaworn Senniam announced some Thai Airways employees became unusually rich from the 2003-2004 10 Airbus A340&#x27;s procurement deal and other mismanaged projects, according to a police-led investigation team set up by the Ministry of Transport. The team is forwarding its findings to the National Anti-Corruption Commission and has been informed by the Council of State that it must shut down due to a technicality.

====Rolls-Royce engine procurement====
In January 2017, a four-year investigation by the UK&#x27;s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) determined that aircraft engine-maker Rolls-Royce had paid bribes to Thai Airways employees and government employees in Thailand to secure orders for the Rolls-Royce T800 engine for its Boeing 777-200s. Rolls-Royce admitted to the charge and agreed to pay penalties. The illicit payments of US$36.38M took place between 1991 and 2005. Bribes were paid in three s:

* 1 June 1991 – 30 June 1992: Rolls-Royce paid US$18.8M
* 1 March 1992 – 31 March 1997: Rolls-Royce paid US$10.38M
* 1 April 2004 – 28 February 2005: Rolls-Royce paid US$7.2M

The government rejected calls for Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to use his Section 44 powers to cut through red tape in the investigation of the Rolls-Royce bribery scandal. Response from the Thai government&#x27;s National Anti-Corruption Commission to information provided by the SFO, is said to be &quot;tepid&quot; and &quot;...could be more embarrassing than the scandal itself.&quot;

On 28 August, Thaworn Senneam announced the findings of a House panel which found evidence of bribes of a minimum of 5%, or 2.6 billion baht, on contracts in payments to officials, politicians, and THAI executives. Thaworn alleged that Rolls-Royce paid 245 million baht in bribes through middlemen, and irregular expenses and overtime payments to staff and senior management, with excessive payments to executives costing. On 1 September, the Transport Ministry formally submitted the findings of the probe into alleged irregularities to the Finance Ministry, Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, and National Anti Corruption Commission for further action.

*10 May 1973: Thai Airways International Flight 311 A Douglas DC-8-33 (registered as HS-TGU, named &quot;Srisubhan&quot;) from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport to Tribhuvan International Airport overran the runway on landing at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. All 100 passengers and 10 crew on board survived, but one person on the ground died. 19 years later, a flight with the same flight number crashed, using an A310.
*26 October 1986: Thai Airways International Flight 620, an Airbus A300B4-600 (registered as HS-TAE, named &quot;Sukhothai&quot;) landed safely at Itami Airport in Osaka, Japan after a grenade exploded on board at over Tosa Bay; all 239 passengers and crew on board survived. The aircraft was damaged by the explosion but was repaired and returned to service.
*10 November 1990: Thai Airways International Flight 305, an Airbus A300B4 flying from Yangon to Bangkok was hijacked by four Burmese students demanding to be taken to India. The aircraft diverted to Calcutta where the hijackers surrendered after negotiations. The hijackers demanded restoration of democracy in Burma.
*31 July 1992: Thai Airways International Flight 311, an Airbus A310-300 (registered as HS-TID, named &quot;Buri Ram&quot;) hit the side of a mountain north of Kathmandu while descending toward Tribhuvan International Airport. All 113 on board (99 passengers and 14 crew) died. The accident was caused by pilot error and loss of situation awareness in inclement weather.
*22 October 1994: An Airbus A300B4-100 (registered HS-THO, named &quot;Srichulalak&quot;) was written off after it was struck by an out-of-control Thai Airways MD-11 (registered as HS-TMD, named &quot;Phra Nakhon&quot;) that was performing an engine run-up at Bangkok International Airport.
*11 December 1998: Thai Airways International Flight 261, an A310-200 (registered as HS-TIA, named &quot;Phitsanulok&quot;), bound for Surat Thani from Bangkok, crashed into a rice paddy about from Surat Thani International Airport during its third landing attempt in heavy rain; 101 of 146 on board died.
*3 March 2001: Thai Airways International Flight 114, a Boeing 737-400 (registered as HS-TDC, named &quot;Narathiwat&quot;), bound for Chiang Mai from Bangkok, was destroyed by an explosion of the center wing tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel-air mixture in the tank while the aircraft was parked at the gate in Bangkok. The source of the ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty, but the most likely source was an explosion originating at the center wing tank pump as a result of running the pump in the presence of metal shavings and a fuel-air mixture. One crew member died.
*8 September 2013: Thai Airways International Flight 679, an Airbus A330-300 (registered as HS-TEF, named &quot;Song Dao&quot;), arriving from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport excursed from the runway from runway 19L while landing at Suvarnabhumi Airport, with extensive damage to the airplane and the runway and minor injuries to 14 occupants. Preliminary investigation determined the cause of the accident to be the right landing gear collapsing as a result of a damaged bogie. In the aftermath of the accident, Thai Airways had the logos of the aircraft painted over in black, prompting widespread criticism of attempted cover-up. An airline official initially said that the practice was part of the &quot;crisis communication rule&quot; recommended by Star Alliance. This was denied by the group, and Thai Airways later clarified that the &quot;de-identifying&quot; of aircraft was its own practice and not Star Alliance policy. The controversy prompted discussion over the appropriateness and effectiveness of the practice as a brand-protection policy. No one was seriously injured, but the aircraft was written off. The airframe has since been converted to a roadside attraction called Airways Land, featuring a cafe and event space, on Mittraphap Road in Sida District, Nakhon Ratchasima Province.
*10 June 2023, Thai Airways International Flight 683, an Airbus A330-300 (registered as HS-TEO, named &quot;Chutamat&quot;), which was to depart from Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan for Bangkok–Suvarnabhumi collided with EVA Air Flight 189, also an Airbus A330-300 (registered as B-16340), headed for Taipei–Songshan. No injuries were reported. However, both aircraft sustained minor damage as a result of the collision. The collision forced one of the four runways of Haneda to temporarily close for approximately two hours. The Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB) has launched an investigation involving both airlines.

<text>Bonny Doon is a census-designated place in Santa Cruz County, California. It is situated northwest of the city of Santa Cruz, considered part of the southern San Francisco Bay Area or northern Monterey Bay Area. Bonny Doon&#x27;s population was 2,868, as reported by the 2020 census.

==History==
It was founded in the 1850s as a logging camp. The current name can be attested back to 1902: John Burns, a Scotsman living in Santa Cruz, named Bonny Doon after a line in the Robert Burns song &quot;The Banks O&#x27; Doon&quot;. The line is: &quot;Ye banks and braes o&#x27; bonnie Doon...&quot;, and refers back to the Doon River in Scotland. Evidence of 2,600 years of occupation by Native Americans has been found in the area.

Bonny Doon has no city center or commercial shops, but features several wineries including Bonny Doon Vineyard, a church, two fire stations, a lavender farm, the Bonny Doon Ecological Reserve, an elementary school, and a private-use airport. A beach of the same name is nearby.

In 2020, Bonny Doon was popular with remote workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Wildfires===
At 2:54 p.m. on June 11, 2008, a fire broke out at the Bonny Doon Ecological Reserve, a preserve with a number of hiking trails located on Martin Road. This Martin Fire burned , destroying three residences and eight outbuildings. About 1,500 residents of Bonny Doon were evacuated as a result of the fire. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency for Santa Cruz County. The blaze cost over $5.4 million to contain and was part of a busy summer of wildfires in California.

Little more than one year later, on August 12, 2009 at 7:16 pm, a second fire started in Bonny Doon, near the Lockheed facility off Empire Grade. The Lockheed Fire burned , and destroyed 13 outbuildings. More than 2,000 residents were evacuated as the blaze spread from Swanton south toward Bonny Doon. The blaze cost over $26.6 million and took nearly 2 weeks to be fully contained. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

In August 2020, Bonny Doon was affected by the CZU complex of lightning-initiated fires, which joined together to form one of the top 10 largest fires ever in California. Many home structures, the local school, and lavender field farm were protected by local residents – and one neighbor’s (borrowed) fire equipment truck. This band of neighbors defied an evacuation order and worked together over 4 days and nights to save multiple properties in their community, with the help of CAL Fire at the very peak of the fire. {Stories of the heroic actions of community members who stayed behind to protect homes yet to be added by a local resident}

<text>The Alpine Rhine Valley () is a glacial alpine valley, formed by the Alpine Rhine ( ), the part of the Rhine between the confluence of the Anterior Rhine and Posterior Rhine at Reichenau and Lake Constance. It covers three countries, with sections of the river demarcating the borders between Austria and Switzerland and between Liechtenstein and Switzerland. The full length of the Alpine Rhine is 93.5 km.

From Reichenau, the Alpine Rhine flows east, passing Chur and turning north, before it turns north-east at Landquart, and then roughly north, east of Sargans. From here, the Alpine Rhine forms the border between the canton of St. Gallen of Switzerland on the left, west side, and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the east side. About further down, the Rhine then meets the Austrian federal state Vorarlberg and finally flows into Lake Constance, south of Lindau (Germany), which is no longer part of the Rhine Valley. The Swiss-Austrian border follows the historical bed of the Rhine, but today the river follows an artificial canal within Austria for the final , parallel to the also canalised Dornbirner Ach. The border also still follows the old river bed at Diepoldsau.

The Rhine Valley&#x27;s upper third has the character of an Alpine valley, enclosing a bottom plain of about across. Downstream of Vaduz, the valley widens considerably, developing into a broad plain, measuring some across at its lower end along the southeastern shores of Upper Lake Constance. The latter is separated from the Lower Lake Constance by a short stretch of the Rhine, called the &quot;Seerhein&quot; (). From the point of the Rhine&#x27;s emergence from Lower Lake Constance, it is known as the High Rhine ().

Right tributaries of the Alpine Rhine are the Plessur in Chur, the Landquart in the town of the same name, the Ill and Frutz on the &quot;Upper Land&quot; of the Austrian plain near Feldkirch. Several rivers in Liechtenstein drain into a canal, which carries the water to the Alpine Rhine. The Alpine Rhine has no major left tributaries; creeks joining it from the left are the Oldisbach at Chur, Cosenz at Untervaz, Säge at Tardisbrücke, Tamina at Bad Ragaz, Saar at Trübbach, Tobelbach at Buchs, Simml at Gams. Though all left tributaries in the St. Gall Rhine Valley are collected by the Rheintaler Binnenkanal, which flows into Lake of Constance by &quot;Alter Rhein&quot;, and never meets the Alpine Rhine anymore.

==Geography==
The Alpine Rhine Valley is flanked by the Alps and its mountain ranges (especially Alpstein, Plessuralpen, Rätikon Calanda, the Albula Alps and the Glarner Alps), some higher than . The highest mountain, Ringelspitz, commences next to Tamins. At , it is the highest peak of the canton of St. Gallen, bordering the valley to its southeast.

===Valley===
Geographical parts of the Alpine Rhine Valley are:

Upper half:
*Chur Rhine Valley, or Grisonian Rhine Valley (): The name refers to the town of Chur, or its canton Graubünden, respectively. It starts at Rhäzüns/Bonaduz and ends east of Sargans (SG).

Lower half:
:To the north, the Bündner Rheintal crosses into the Rhine valley between Sargans and Lake of Constance, where it largely forms the border between the canton of St. Gallen on the west side and Liechtenstein and Austria on its east side. The valley is simply called the &quot;Rhine Valley&quot; on either side. The Swiss sometimes also call it the &quot;St. Gall Rhine Valley&quot; in order to distinguish it from its upper half.
:*St. Gall Rhine Valley (): On its western side, the Rhine Valley is politically further divided into Werdenberg (Wahlkreis) and Rheintal (Wahlkreis), though geographically it is separated by the &quot;Hirschensprung&quot; near Rüthi (SG).
:*Eastern side:
:**On its eastern side, the upper half of the valley is called the Liechtenstein Rhine Valley ().
:**Vorarlberg Rhine Valley (): The lower half is also called the &quot;Vorarlberg Rhine Valley&quot;, since it belongs to the Austrian federal state Vorarlberg. It is further divided into an upper and lower part and referred to as the &quot;Upper and Lower Lands&quot; (). The Lower Lands, sometimes also called , stretches from the shores of Lake Constance to the small hill &quot;Kummaberg&quot; to the south, the upper part lies south of it.

===Alpine Rhine===

The Alpine Rhine begins in the centre of the Swiss canton of Grisons (), and later forms the border between Switzerland to the west and Liechtenstein to the east, and later between Switzerland and Austria. The river is formed near Tamins-Reichenau by the confluence of the rivers Anterior Rhine () and the Posterior Rhine (). Its mouth is at the Upper Lake Constance. It descends from an elevation of . The river makes a distinctive turn to the north near Chur. At Landquart it turns north-east and then to the north around the Fläscherberg, east of Sargans. Near Sargans a natural dam, only a few metres high, prevents it from flowing further to the north-west into the open valley, called Seeztal, and then consequently through Lake Walen (and further to Lake Zurich into the river Aare).

Besides the &quot;Vorderrhein&quot; and &quot;Hinterrhein&quot;, the Apline rhine has only a few other larger tributaries. Its main right tributaries are the Plessur (in Chur), the Landquart river in Landquart, the Liechtenstein inland canal in Liechtenstein (near the northern end of the country), and the Ill and Frutz in Austria (Vorarlberg). Main left tributaries, all located in Switzerland, are the Tamina (in Bad Ragaz) and the Saar (in Trübbach).

The mouth of the Rhine into Lake Constance forms an inland delta. The delta is delimited in the west by the &quot;Old Rhine&quot; and in the east by a modern canalized section. Most of the delta is a nature reserve and bird sanctuary and has been designated as a Ramsar site since 1982. It includes the Austrian towns of Gaißau, Höchst and Fußach. The natural Rhine originally branched into at least two arms and formed small islands by precipitating sediments.

A regulation of the Rhine was called for, with an upper canal near Diepoldsau and a lower canal at Fußach, in order to counteract the constant flooding and strong sedimentation in the western Rhine Delta. To build and maintain the levees, the International Rhine Regulation Railway was constructed. The Dornbirner Ach had to be diverted, too, and it now flows parallel to the canalized Rhine into the lake. Its water has a darker color than the Rhine; the latter&#x27;s lighter suspended load comes from higher up the mountains. It is expected that the continuous input of sediment into the lake will silt up the lake. This has already happened to the former Lake Tuggenersee.

The cut-off Old Rhine at first formed a swamp landscape. Later an artificial ditch of about was dug. It was made navigable to the Swiss town of Rheineck.

== Culture ==

The Alpine Rhine Valley is characterised by a very active culture scene. The Bregenzer Festspiele as well as the Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein have great significance and popularity beyond the region. From a regional perspective, there are many platforms, events and projects that enhance the cultural life of the inhabitants and the local actors. In Widnau, the only international artistic gymnastics tournament for male juniors and seniors in Switzerland takes place. It&#x27;s named Rheintalcup after the Alpine Rhine Valley.

An example of cross-border cooperation in the Alpine Rhine Valley is the cultural axis of the cities Bregenz, St.Gallen, Vaduz and Chur: The Kunsthaus Bregenz, the Kunstmuseum St. Gallen, the Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein and the Bündner Kunstmuseum in Chur have been cooperating since 2001. Visible signs of this cooperation of the four institutions from three countries are the joint presentations on the &quot;ART BODENSEE&quot; each year.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

The valley was part of the ancient Roman province of Raetia. The Alemannic people settled the lower Rhine Valley in the early Middle Ages. Under the Frankish Empire, the Rheintal between Montstein and Hirschensprung was given to the Rhinegraviate (the county of the Rheingau), and its first recorded mention is in 891; the area between Lake Constance and Montstein was a part of the Thurgau.

Rule of the Rhine Valley was fragmented throughout the Middle Ages, with the Holy Roman Emperor, the Bishop of Constance, the Abbot of St Gall and the counts of Bregenz and Werdenberg all claiming various portions of the valley. It was not until 1348 that the Rheintal was united, under the county of Werdenberg-Heiligenberg.
From when the Habsburgs acquired the county of Tyrol in 1363, they gradually began to gain control of the Rhine Valley, gaining the whole valley through a combination of conquest and purchase by 1395.

====&quot;Vogtei&quot; Rheintal====

By 1424, the Rhine Valley was largely in the hands of the counts of Toggenburg. After their extinction, Appenzell reconquered the Rheintal with Rheineck in the Old Zürich War in 1445.
In 1464, Appenzell protected the Rheintal from the territorial claims of the prince-abbot of St Gall, particularly in a series of battles at the time of the &quot;Rorschacher Klosterbruch&quot;, the &quot;&quot; for the St Gallerkrieg between 28 July 1489 and the spring of 1490. Nevertheless, Appenzell was forced to cede the governing protectorship of the Valley to the warring powers—the Abbey and the four cantons of Glarus, Lucerne, Schwyz and Zürich—bringing the bailiwick into the ambit of the Old Swiss Confederation as a &quot;Gemeine Herrschaft&quot; (condominium).

===Early modern history===
====Swiss Reformation====
In 1528, the Protestant Reformation was accepted in the Vogtei Rheintal; whilst Roman Catholic minorities remained, only Altstätten, Widnau, Kriessern and Rüthi had a Catholic majority. Through the defeat of the Catholic hegemony over Switzerland and the end of the lengthy religious disputes that had riven the Confederacy, the 11 August 1712 Peace of Aarau () established confessional parity, allowing both faiths to coexist in legal equality—a concept relatively common to the Holy Roman Empire since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.

====Liechtenstein====
The Liechtenstein dynasty was able to arrange the purchase of the minuscule &quot;Herrschaft&quot; (&quot;Lordship&quot;) of Schellenberg and county of Vaduz (in 1699 and 1712 respectively) from the Hohenems.
On 23 January 1719, after the lands had been purchased, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, decreed that Vaduz and Schellenberg were united and elevated the newly formed territory to the dignity of &quot;Fürstentum&quot; (&quot;principality&quot;) with the name &quot;Liechtenstein&quot; in honour of &quot;[his] true servant, Anton Florian of Liechtenstein&quot;. It was on this date that Liechtenstein became a sovereign member state of the Holy Roman Empire. It is a testament to the pure political expediency of the purchases that the Princes of Liechtenstein did not set foot in their new principality for over 120 years.

===Napoleonic era===

As a result of the Napoleonic Wars, by 1806 the Holy Roman Empire was under the control of French emperor Napoleon I. Napoleon dissolved the empire; this had broad consequences for Liechtenstein: imperial, legal and political mechanisms broke down. The state ceased to owe obligations to any feudal lord beyond its borders.

In 1798, the Vogtei Rheintal unilaterally declared its independence. In the aftermath of the collapse of the Old Swiss Confederation (resulting from it being completely overrun by the French Revolutionary Armies), on 26 March 1798, a &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot; in Altstätten promulgated a constitution and elected both a magistrate () and a council (). Within weeks, however, this nascent independence was quashed with the inclusion of the Rheintal into the Helvetic canton of Säntis, with the exception of Rüthi and Lienz, assigned to Linth.

With Napoleon&#x27;s Act of Mediation on 19 February 1803, the Helvetic Republic and its cantonal boundaries were abolished, with the Rheintal reunited as a district of the canton of St. Gallen, stretching from Staad to Lienz and with its capital alternating monthly between Altstätten and Rheineck.

===Modern history===
The &quot;Bezirk&quot; was split in twain in 1831, creating Oberrheintal, with its capital in Altstätten, and Unterrheintal, with its capital alternating between Rheineck and Berneck, St. Gallen. This division persisted until 2003, when a constitutional revision created the modern constituency (), with the loss of Thal to the adjacent &quot;Wahlkreis&quot; of Rorschach.

==Transportation==

There is no shipping on the Alpine Rhine.

Within Switzerland, the river is followed (from south to north) by the Landquart–Thusis railway line (on the right bank side between and ) and the Chur–Rorschach railway line (between and on the right bank side and between and on the left bank side). Between St. Margrethen and , the line follows the Old Rhine.

The Vorarlberg Railway line runs in north-south direction through the Vorarlberg portion of the Alpine Rhine Valley. It connects and and continues northwards to (Germany).

Two cross-border railway lines traverse the Alpine Rhine. The St. Margrethen–Lauterach line (between St. Margrethen and ) and the Feldkirch–Buchs railway line (between and , continues across the Austria–Liechtenstein border to Feldkirch).

Regional train services are provided by Chur S-Bahn, Bodensee S-Bahn, St. Gallen S-Bahn and Vorarlberg S-Bahn.

<text>Vyasa (; , ) or Veda Vyasa (, ), also known as Krishna Dvaipayana Veda Vyasa (, &quot;Vedavyāsa&quot;), is a &quot;rishi&quot; (sage) with a prominent role in most Hindu traditions. He is traditionally regarded as the author of the epic &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, where he also plays a prominent role as a character. He is also regarded by the Hindu traditions to be the compiler of the mantras of the &quot;Vedas&quot; into four texts, as well as the author of the eighteen &quot;Purāṇas&quot; and the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;.

Vyasa is regarded by many Hindus as a partial incarnation (, ) of Vishnu. He is one of the immortals called the Chiranjivis, held by adherents to still be alive in the current age known as the Kali Yuga.

==Name==
&quot;Vyasa&quot; (&quot;Vyāsa&quot;) means &quot;compiler,&quot; &quot;arranger and also means &quot;separation&quot;, or, &quot;division.&quot; Other meanings are &quot;split&quot;, &quot;differentiate&quot;, or, &quot;describe.&quot; It is also a title, given to &quot;a holy sage or a pious learned man,&quot; and applied to &quot;persons distinguished for their writings.&quot;

Vyasa is commonly known as &quot;Vedavyasa&quot; (&quot;, Vedavyāsa&quot;) as he divided the single, eternal &quot;Veda&quot; into four separate books&quot;Rigveda&quot;, &quot;Samaveda&quot;, &quot;Yajurveda&quot; and &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;. In the Mahabharata, Vyasa is also called &quot;Krishna&quot;, which refers to his dark complexion (&quot;krishna&quot;), and as &quot;Dvaipāyana&quot;, as his birthplace was on an island (dvaipayana), He is also referred to as &quot;Vaishampayan&quot; (, &quot;Vaiṣampāyana&quot;).

Veda Vyasa is actually a title, which is given to each sage who categorizes the Vedas into four parts in the beginning of Kali Yuga. Earlier, Krishna Dvaipayana&#x27;s father, Parashara had categorized the vedas in the 26th Chaturyuga. In this chaturyuga, Krishna or Vishnu himself descends onto the Earth to categorize the Vedas as Krishna Dvaipayana.

==Divider of the Veda==
Hindus traditionally hold that Vyasa subcategorized the primordial single Veda to produce four parts as a canonical collection. Hence he was called Veda-Vyasa, or &quot;Splitter of the Vedas&quot;, the splitting being a feat that allowed people to understand the divine knowledge of the Veda.

The &quot;Vishnu Puraṇa&quot; elaborates on the role of Vyasa in the Hindu chronology. The Hindu view of the universe is that of a cyclic phenomenon that comes into existence and dissolves repeatedly. Each &quot;kalpa&quot; cycle is presided over by a number of Manus, one for each &quot;manvantara&quot;, and each &quot;manvantara&quot; has a number of &quot;yuga cycles&quot;, each with four &quot;yuga&quot; ages of declining virtues. The &quot;Dvapara Yuga&quot; is the third &quot;yuga&quot;. The &quot;Vishṇu Puraṇa&quot; (Book 3, Ch 3) says:
According to the Vishṇu Purāṇa, Aśwatthāmā, the son of Droṇa, will become the next sage (Vyāsa) and will divide the Veda in 29th Mahā Yuga of 7th Manvantara.

===The &quot;Mahabharata&quot;===


Vyāsa is traditionally regarded as the chronicler of this epic and also features as an important character in &quot;Mahābhārata.&quot; The first section of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; states that Gaṇesha wrote the text to Vyasa&#x27;s dictation, but this is regarded by scholars as a later interpolation to the epic and this part of the story is also excluded in the &quot;Critical Edition&quot; of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;.

The five Paṇḍava brothers of the junior line of the Kuru royal house being the ultimate victors, thus India&#x27;s cultural heroes, Vyāsa&#x27;s relationship with the winners in this kinship war of cousin against cousin is as chronicler who sired the father of the victors. These five protagonists are the surrogate sons of Pānḍu, sired by various gods on behalf of this Kuru king whom Vyāsa himself fathered &#x27;under Niyoga practice&#x27; in place of an elder brother who died heirless, at the behest of his mother Satyavati. Vyāsa also sired the father of the vanquished, he was certainly the surgeon who put the hundred brothers of antagonist cousins into incubation, and as they are only said to be sired by a boon he conferred on their mother, there&#x27;s some possibility that he is also their biological sire himself. Hence Vyāsa&#x27;s authorship of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; is by way of biography of his own family including its adoptees. This was the struggle between his own ex officio grandsons. And it is in the wake of producing this purportedly historical, smriti &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; as well as &#x27;compiling&#x27; the essential sruti scripture of the Vedas that &#x27;Vyāsa&#x27; was added as epithet then eclipsed his two birth names, &quot;Krishṇa&quot; and &quot;Dvaipāyana&quot;, while his smiriti creation became a canon whose territorial name, drawing on either one or two legendary ruler&#x27;s personal names, included in the saga&#x27;s text, still underlies modern Sanskrit-to-Hindi official form, Bhārata Gaṇarājya, in the names for India through its current constitution.

Vyāsa&#x27;s &quot;Jaya&quot; (literally, &quot;victory&quot;), the core of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, is a dialogue between Dhritarāshtra (the Kuru king and the father of the Kauravas, who opposed the Pāṇḍavas in the Kurukshetra War) and Sanjaya, his adviser and charioteer. Sanjaya narrates the particulars of the Kurukshetra War, fought in eighteen days, chronologically. Dhritarashtra at times asks questions and expresses doubts, sometimes lamenting, fearing the destruction the war would bring on his family, friends and kin.

The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; is contained in the Bhishma Parva, which comprises chapters 23-40 of book 6 of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. The &quot;Gita&quot;, dated to the second half of the first millennium BCE, in its own right is one of the most influential philosophico-religious dialogues, producing numerous commentaries and a global audience. Like the &quot;Jaya&quot;, it is also a dialogue, in which Paṇḍava Prince Arjuna&#x27;s hesitation to attack his cousins is counseled from &#x27;the perspective of the gods&#x27; by his charioteer, revealed to be an avatar of Vishnu. In 1981, Larson stated that &quot;a complete listing of Gita translations and a related secondary bibliography would be nearly endless&quot;. The Bhagavad Gita has been highly praised, not only by prominent Indians including Mahatma Gandhi and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, but also by Aldous Huxley, Henry David Thoreau, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Carl Jung, Hermann Hesse, and Bülent Ecevit.

In the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, large and elaborate lists are given, describing hundreds of kingdoms, tribes, provinces, cities, towns, villages, rivers, mountains, forests, etc. of the (ancient) Indian subcontinent (Bhārata Varsha). Additionally, he gives descriptions of the military formations adopted by each side on each day, the death of individual heroes and the details of the war-races. Eighteen chapters of Vyāsa&#x27;s Jaya constitute the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred text in Hinduism. The Jaya deals with diverse subjects, such as geography, history, warfare, religion and morality.

The 100,000 verses of Vyāsa&#x27;s work &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; is told by Vaiṣampāyana to Janmejaya. It is structured as a narration by Ugrasrava surnamed Sauti, a professional storyteller, to an assembly of rishis who, in the forest of Naimisha, had just attended the 12-year sacrifice known as Ṣaunaka, surnamed Kulapati. At 100,000 verses, the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; is the longest epic poem ever written.

=== Puranas ===
Vyasa is also credited with the writing of the eighteen major Purāṇas, which are works of Indian literature that cover an encyclopedic range of topics covering various scriptures.

=== &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; ===

The &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, one of the foundational texts of Vedanta, is written by Bādarāyaṇa also called Veda Vyasa, &quot;one who arranges&quot;.

==Role in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;==

===Birth===

According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Vyasa&#x27;s mother, Satyavati, was raised as the daughter of a fisherman, belonging to a clan that used to ferry people across the river Yamuna. She used to help her father in this task. It was during one such ferrying that she encountered the sage Parasara. As he boarded her boat, he was captivated by her beauty. Overcome with desire, he approached her, but she, recognizing his intent, humbly pleaded to preserve her chastity. However, Parasara used his divine powers to create an artificial fog around the boat and transformed her natural scent into the fragrance of musk. He also conjured an island in the middle of the river, where he consummated his union with her. After this, he assured her that she would remain a virgin despite giving birth. He prophesied that the son born to her would be an extraordinary being—a partial incarnation of Vishnu, a man of immense wisdom, and a revered teacher who would divide the Vedas and be honored across the three worlds. 

Following this, Parasara performed his ablutions in the Yamuna and departed. Satyavati’s pregnancy was completed instantly, and she gave birth to a radiant and handsome boy on the island. As soon as he was born, the child matured into an ascetic form, exuding spiritual radiance. He reassured his mother that she need not worry about him and that he was leaving to undertake penance. He further promised that whenever she faced difficulties, she only needed to think of him, and he would appear by her side. Having said this, he departed, embarking on the path of a hermit. He was named Krishna Dvaipayana, referring to his dark complexion. 

Satyavati kept this incident a secret, not telling even King Shantanu whom she was married to later.

===Continuing the Kuru Dynasty===
Shantanu and Satyavati had two sons, named Chitrāngada and Vichitravirya. Both of them died early without leaving an heir, but Vichitravirya had two wives – Ambika and Ambalika. A widowed Satyavati initially asked her stepson, Bhishma, to marry both the queens, but he refused, citing his vow of celibacy. Satyavati revealed her secret past and requested him to bring her firstborn to impregnate the widows under a tradition called Niyoga. 

Sage Vyasa was unkempt because of months of meditation in the forest. Hence upon seeing him, Ambika who was rather scared shut her eyes, resulting in their child, Dhritarāshtra, being born blind. The other queen, Ambalika, turned pale upon meeting Vyasa, which resulted in their child, Pandu, being born pale. Alarmed, Satyavati requested that Vyasa meet Ambika again and grant her another son. Ambika instead sent her maid to meet Vyasa. The duty-bound maid was calm and composed; she had a healthy child who was later named Vidura.

When the children of Vichitravirya grew up, Bhishma got them married to different women. Dhritarāshtra was married to Gāndhāri, princess of Gandhara. Pandu married Kunti and Madri. Pāṇḍu left the kingdom, leaving Dhritarashtra as the acting king. Gāndhāri, during her adolescence, received a boon to have a hundred children but her pregnancy was taking a long period of time. After two years of pregnancy, Gandhari aborted her developing fetus, giving birth to a hard mass that looked like an iron ball. Vyasa came to the kingdom and using his knowledge, he asked to divide the mass into one hundred and one pieces and put them into pots for incubation. After a year, 101 babies were born. Meanwhile, Pāṇḍu&#x27;s wives, Kunti and Mādri, had three and two sons respectively.

After the death of Pandu, he consoled Kunti and the young Pandavas, providing them with counsel in their time of bereavement. Vyāsa, feeling sorrow for his mother&#x27;s fate, asked her to leave the kingdom and come with him to live a peaceful life. Satyavati, along with her two daughters-in-law, went to the forest.

===Influence on the political affairs of the Kuru Kingdom ===
Vyasa stands as a pivotal figure in the Mahabharata, serving as the spiritual and moral guide for both the Kauravas and the Pandavas. While his primary residence remained his hermitage, his influence extended deeply into the affairs of Hastinapura (capital of Kuru Kingdom). He was actively engaged in shaping events, offering counsel and intervention at crucial moments. 

His influence extended to the broader political and social developments of the time. He played a decisive role in facilitating Draupadi’s marriage to the five Pandavas, thereby shaping an alliance that had significant implications in the unfolding events. His wisdom was frequently sought in matters of governance, and he was a regular presence in Yudhishthira’s court. Under his guidance, the Pandavas undertook regional conquests, expanding their influence. Vyasa also played a central role in the Rajasuya sacrifice performed by Yudhishthira, overseeing its arrangements and predicting the future course of events. Upon the conclusion of the ceremony, he performed the anointment of Yudhishthira. 

As hostilities between the Kauravas and the Pandavas escalated, Vyasa made multiple attempts to prevent conflict. He advised Dhritarashtra to restrain Duryodhana from unjust actions, warning of the potential consequences. During the Pandavas’ exile, he visited them in the forest and imparted teachings to Yudhishthira on various philosophical and strategic matters. Prior to the Kurukshetra war, he granted Sanjaya divine vision, enabling him to narrate the battle’s progress to Dhritarashtra. During the war, he provided guidance and consolation to Yudhishthira and Arjuna, both of whom were deeply affected by the destruction around them. 

Following the war, Vyasa continued to be actively involved in the political and moral reconstruction of the kingdom. He intervened to prevent Gandhari from cursing the Pandavas in her grief and provided counsel to Yudhishthira on governance and statecraft. When Yudhishthira, overwhelmed by remorse, considered renouncing his throne, Vyasa dissuaded him, urging him to fulfill his responsibilities. He played a crucial role in post-war reconciliation, using his spiritual power to bring forth the spirits of those who had perished, allowing Dhritarashtra and others to witness them. He also guided the widows of fallen warriors, instructing them on traditional rites.

==Other accounts==

Vyāsa had a son named Shuka, who was his spiritual successor and heir. As per &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, Vyasa married Vatikā, alias Pinjalā, who was the daughter of a sage named Jābāli. It is described that Vyasa&#x27;s union with her produced his heir, who repeated everything that he heard, thus receiving the name Shuka (lit. Parrot). Other texts including the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; also narrate the birth of Shuka but with drastic differences. Vyasa was desiring an heir, when an &quot;apsara&quot; (celestial damsel) named Ghritachi flew in front of him in the form of a beautiful parrot, causing him sexual arousal. He discharges his semen, which falls on some sticks and a son develops. This time, he was named Shuka because of the role of the celestial parrot. Shuka appears occasionally in the story as a spiritual guide to the young Kuru princes.

Besides his heir, Vyasa had four other disciplesPaila, Jaimini, Vaishampayana and Sumantu. Each one of them was given the responsibility to spread one of the four Vedas. Paila was the made the incharge of &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Jaimini of the &quot;Samaveda&quot;, Vaishampayana of the &quot;Yajurveda&quot; and Sumantu of &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;.

Vyasa is believed to have lived on the banks of Gangā in modern-day Uttarākhaṇd. The site was also the ritual home of the sage Vashishta, along with the Pāṇḍavas, the five brothers of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;.

Vyāsa is also mentioned in the Śankara Digvijaya. He confronts Ādi Shankara, who has written a commentary on the Brahma-Sutras, in the form of an old Brahmana, and asks for an explanation of the first Sutra. This develops into a debate between Shankara and Vyāsa which lasts for eight days. Recognizing the old Brahmana to be Vyāsa, Shankara makes obeisance and sings a hymn in his praise. Thereupon, Vyasa inspects and approves Shankara&#x27;s commentary on the Brahma-Sutras. Adi Shankara, who was supposed to die at the end of his sixteenth year, expresses his desire to leave his body in the presence of Vyāsa. Vyāsa dissuades him and blesses him so that he may live for another sixteen years to complete his work.

==Festival==
The festival of Guru Purnima is dedicated to Vyasa. It is also known as &quot;Vyasa Purnima&quot;, the day believed to be both of his birth and when he divided the Vedas.

==In Sikhism==
In &quot;Brahm Avtar&quot;, one of the compositions in Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh mentions Rishi Vyas as an avatar of Brahma. He is considered the fifth incarnation of Brahma. Guru Gobind Singh wrote a brief account of Rishi Vyas&#x27;s compositions about great kings—Manu, Prithu, Bharath, Jujat, Ben, Mandata, Dilip, Raghu Raj and Aj—and attributed to him the store of Vedic learning.

== Sapta Chiranjivi Stotram ==
The Sapta Chiranjivi Stotram states that the remembrance of the eight immortals (Ashwatthama, Mahabali, Vyasa, Hanuman, Vibhishana, Kripa, Parashurama, and Markandeya) offers one freedom from ailments and longevity.

<text>Travelocity.com is an online travel agency owned by the American Expedia Group. It has 12.4 million monthly unique visitors, making it the third most popular website owned by Expedia Group, after Expedia.com and Hotels.com.

One of the pioneers of web-based disintermediation, Travelocity.com was the first website that allowed consumers the ability to purchase travel tickets without the help of a person.

In addition to airfares, the site also permits consumers to book hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and packaged vacations.

==History==
American Airlines began offering customer access to its electronic reservation system, Sabre, in 1978 to travel agencies, and in the mid-1980s on CompuServe and GEnie to consumers under the &quot;eAAsySabre&quot; brand name. The CEO of eAAsySabre was Kathy Misunas. Under the &quot;Saabre&quot; brand, it was a popular feature of online services such as Prodigy and America Online in the early 1990s.

Travelocity was created in 1995 as a joint venture between Worldview Systems Corporation and Sabre Corporation. The founding team at Worldview conceived of the idea in 1994 as an extension to their online travel database offering which had been distributed through Sabre, Bloomberg, AOL and many others. The founding team at Worldview joined with distribution partner Sabre in a 50-50 JV that resulted in the development and launch of Travelocity in 1995-1996.

In 1996, Worldview&#x27;s investors, Advance Publications and Ameritech, sold their stake in Travelocity to Sabre Corporation. It was run by long-time Sabre information technology executive Terry Jones. 

Travelocity gained popularity after a 1999 partnership with AOL.

In 2000, Sabre negotiated a merger of Travelocity with Preview Travel. The resulting company was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange, with Sabre owning around 70% of the company.

In March 2002, Sabre reacquired all outstanding shares of the brand via a tender offer. Jones left the company shortly afterward, in May 2002.

In March 2002, Travelocity acquired last minute travel specialist Site59.com. The CEO and founder of Site59, Michelle Peluso, joined Travelocity with the acquisition as senior vice president, product strategy and distribution. Peluso became Travelocity&#x27;s COO in April 2003 and was then named president and chief executive officer of Travelocity in December 2003. Many members of Peluso&#x27;s former management team at Site59 were appointed to senior management positions at Travelocity.

In 2004, Travelocity introduced an advertising campaign known as &quot;Where Is My Gnome?&quot;.

In 2005, Travelocity acquired lastminute.com for £577 million. The acquisition included allhotels.com, which was founded in 1997 by Richard Irwin, acquired by Online Travel Corporation (OTC) in 2002 for £1.4 million, and later acquired by lastminute.com in 2004.

In January 2009, CEO Michelle Peluso announced her resignation and was replaced by Sabre executive Hugh Jones.

In April 2011, president and CEO Hugh Jones moved to a position at Sabre and Gilt Groupe president Carl Sparks was brought in as president and CEO of Travelocity. Sparks had been general manager of Hotels.com and was previously chief marketing officer of Expedia.

In December 2012, Travelocity sold Zuji to Webjet for $25 million.

In June 2013, Travelocity Business, a corporate travel agency, was sold to Atlanta, Georgia-based BCD Travel.

In August 2013, Expedia Inc. announced an agreement with Travelocity to power its United States and Canadian websites.

In November 2013, Travelocity shut down its IgoUgo website.

In May 2014, CEO Carl Sparks stepped down as CEO of Travelocity. After the departure of Sparks, Roshan Mendis, President of Travelocity was named to manage operations of Travelocity&#x27;s operations in the Americas, while Matthew Crummack, CEO of lastminute.com was named to manage operations in Europe.

In December 2014, Travelocity sold lastminute.com to Swiss-based Bravofly Rumbo for £76 million.

In January 2015, Travelocity was sold by Sabre to Expedia, Inc. for $280 million.

In November 2015, Travelocity hired Assembly in New York to handle US media. Until then, media had been handled by Publics Groupe&#x27;s Zenith Media.

In December 2015, Travelocity relaunched its Travel for Good program that offers a $5,000 grant for a selected volunteer to participate in volunteer travel programs with various nonprofit organizations, including Habitat for Humanity, Globe Aware, and the American Hiking Society.

In February 2016, Travelocity launched its Wander Wisely advertising campaign featuring the Roaming Gnome and &quot;The Customer 1st Guarantee&quot;. The tagline was also changed from &quot;Go and Smell the Roses&quot; to &quot;Wander Wisely&quot;.

Travelocity had been a longstanding sponsor of the American reality show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, sponsoring the series from the first season until season 34, when they were replaced by parent company Expedia.

==Controversies==
===Drop pricing; exclusion of surcharges===
In July 2012, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) fined Travelocity $180,000 after discovering that Travelocity&#x27;s &quot;flexible dates tool&quot; did not always include fuel surcharges that were part of many international airfares, in violation of DOT rules requiring all carrier-imposed surcharges and fees to be included in every advertised fare. In addition, the DOT found that the customer was informed only on the final page before purchasing the ticket that some itineraries required a paper ticket with a minimum additional delivery fee of $29.95.

===Cancellation of trips booked with promo code===
In August 2012, Travelocity offered a $200 coupon code to attendees at the National Federation of the Blind annual conference in Dallas. After the NFB posted the code on Twitter without mentioning the attendee restriction, Travelocity re-tweeted it without noticing the error but deleted the tweet a day later. After some travel blogs and message boards re-posted the code, many ineligible travelers used the code. Travelocity responded by cancelling all trips of people that used the code who were not on the list of attendees at the NFB annual conference. This resulted in a barrage of complaints from customers.

<doc id="303465" wikidata="Q1470593" url="?curid=303465" title="Mother Night">
<text>Mother Night is a novel by American author Kurt Vonnegut, first published in February 1962.

The novel takes the form of the fictional memoirs of Howard W. Campbell Jr., an American, who moved to Germany in 1923 at age 11, and later became a well-known playwright and Nazi propagandist. The story of the novel is narrated (through the use of metafiction) by Campbell himself, writing his memoirs while awaiting trial for war crimes in an Israeli prison. Campbell also appears briefly in Vonnegut&#x27;s later novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;.

== Background ==
The title of the book comes from a passage in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, where Mephistopheles gives the name Mother Night to the primordial Darkness before the Light of creation, and hopes and predicts that the Light, and creation, must soon fail and the Darkness return.

Vonnegut told Charlie Rose in 1996 that he was paid $3,000 for it () at a time when he &quot;needed the money&quot;, and also explained the idea for the story as follows:I got the idea at a cocktail party on Cape Cod. [...] I lived there for 20 years, and I met a spymaster. The guy had been a spymaster during the Second World War, and he was complaining about spy films, that they made no sense. He said, &quot;Any time you have an agent inside an enemy country, this is a very sick person you are dealing with.&quot;He also explains the inspiration for Campbell&#x27;s character:The British actually had a treacherous citizen who broadcast for the Nazis, Lord Haw-Haw, and he was hanged by the British after the war for treason. I said, &quot;All right, suppose an American does this.&quot;

==Plot summary==

The novel is framed as the memoir of Howard W. Campbell, Jr. He is writing it while imprisoned and waiting for his war crimes trial for his actions as a Nazi propagandist. Campbell, an American who moved to Germany with his parents at age 11, recounts his childhood as the Nazi Party is consolidating its power. Instead of leaving the country with his parents, Campbell continues his career as a playwright, his only social contacts being Nazis. Being of sufficiently ″Aryan″ heritage, Campbell becomes a member of the party in name only. He is politically apathetic, caring only for his art and his wife Helga, who is also the starring actress in all of his plays.

Campbell is later approached by Frank Wirtanen, an agent of the U.S. War Department. Wirtanen wants Campbell to spy as a double agent for the United States in the impending world war. Campbell rejects the offer, but Wirtanen quickly adds that he wants Campbell to think about it. Eventually, he accepts. Once the war starts, Campbell begins to make his way up through Joseph Goebbels&#x27; Propaganda Ministry, eventually becoming the &quot;voice&quot; of broadcasts aimed at converting Americans to the Nazi cause (a parallel to the real broadcaster, Dr. Edward Vieth Sittler). Unbeknownst to the Nazis, all of the idiosyncrasies of Campbell&#x27;s speeches – deliberate pauses, coughing, etc. – are part of the coded information he is passing to the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Campbell never discovers, nor is he ever told, the information that he is sending.

About halfway through the war, Helga goes to the Eastern Front to entertain German troops. Campbell is extremely distraught when he hears that the camp Helga visited in Crimea has been overrun by Soviet troops and she is presumed dead. In early 1945, just before the Red Army captures Berlin, Campbell visits his in-laws one last time. During the visit, he has a conversation with Helga&#x27;s younger sister, Resi, that resonates with him for years afterward. After Campbell is captured by American forces, Wirtanen works out a deal in which he is set free and given passage to New York City.

Fifteen years later, Campbell lives an anonymous life, sustained only by memories of his wife and an indifferent curiosity about his eventual fate. His only friend is George Kraft, a likewise lonely neighbor—who, through an extraordinary coincidence, also happens to be a Soviet intelligence agent. He tries to trick Campbell into fleeing to Moscow by publicizing his identity and location. A white supremacist organization makes Campbell a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;, inviting him to speak to new recruits. The group&#x27;s leader, a dentist named Lionel Jones, shows up at Campbell&#x27;s apartment with a surprise: a woman claiming to be Helga, alive and well and professing her undying love. Campbell&#x27;s will to live returns, and remains even after he finds out that she is not Helga, but rather Resi. They plan to escape to Mexico City after attending one of Jones&#x27; fascist meetings.

There, Wirtanen makes an appearance to warn Campbell of Kraft&#x27;s plot and Resi&#x27;s complicity. Heartbroken, Campbell decides to go along with the charade. He confronts Kraft and Resi, the latter swearing her feelings for him are genuine. The FBI then raids the meeting and takes Campbell into custody, while Resi commits suicide by taking a cyanide capsule. As before, Wirtanen uses his influence to have Campbell set free. Once Campbell returns to his apartment, however, he realizes that he has no real reason to continue living, and decides to turn himself in to the Israelis to stand trial.

While imprisoned in Israel, Campbell meets Adolf Eichmann and gives him advice on how to write an autobiography. At the very end of the book, he inserts a letter that he has just received from Wirtanen. The corroborating evidence that he was indeed an American spy has finally arrived, and Wirtanen writes that he will testify to Campbell&#x27;s true loyalties in court. Rather than being relieved, Campbell feels disgusted by the idea that he will be saved from death and granted freedom only when he is no longer able to enjoy anything that life has to offer. In the last lines, Campbell tells the reader that he will hang himself not for crimes against humanity, but rather for &quot;crimes against myself.&quot;

==Adaptations==
A film adaptation was released in 1996, starring Nick Nolte as Campbell, Sheryl Lee as Helga/Resi, Alan Arkin as Kraft and John Goodman as Wirtanen. The film was written by Robert B. Weide.&quot;

In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of &quot;Mother Night&quot;, narrated by Victor Bevine, as part of its &quot;Modern Vanguard&quot; line of audiobooks.

A theatrical version, adapted and directed by Brian Katz, was premiered at the Custom Made Theater Company in San Francisco in 2017. A revival, also directed by Katz, was presented at 59E59 Theatres in New York in October 2018.

<doc id="303469" wikidata="Q156938" url="?curid=303469" title="Teak">
<text>Teak (Tectona grandis) is a tropical hardwood tree species in the family Lamiaceae. It is a large, deciduous tree that occurs in mixed hardwood forests. &quot;Tectona grandis&quot; has small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense clusters (panicles) at the end of the branches. These flowers contain both types of reproductive organs (perfect flowers). The large, papery leaves of teak trees are often hairy on the lower surface. Teak wood has a leather-like smell when it is freshly milled and is particularly valued for its durability and water resistance. The wood is used for boat building, exterior construction, veneer, furniture, carving, turnings, and various small projects.

&quot;Tectona grandis&quot; is native to south and southeast Asia, mainly Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, but is naturalised and cultivated in many countries in Africa and the Caribbean. Myanmar&#x27;s teak forests account for nearly half of the world&#x27;s naturally occurring teak. Molecular studies show that there are two centres of the genetic origin of teak: one in India and the other in Myanmar and Laos.

== Description ==
Teak is a large deciduous tree up to tall with grey to greyish-brown branches, known for its high-quality wood. Its leaves are ovate-elliptic to ovate, long by wide, and are held on robust petioles which are long. Leaf margins are entire.


Fragrant white flowers are borne on long by wide panicles from June to August. The corolla tube is 2.5–3 mm long with 2 mm wide obtuse lobes. &quot;Tectona grandis&quot; sets fruit from September to December; fruits are globose and 1.2–1.8 cm in diameter. Flowers are weakly protandrous in that the anthers precede the stigma in maturity and pollen is shed within a few hours of the flower opening. The flowers are primarily entomophilous (insect-pollinated), but can occasionally be anemophilous (wind-pollinated). A 1996 study found that in its native range in Thailand, the major pollinators were species in the bee genus &quot;Ceratina&quot;.

===Wood===
Wood texture is hard and rings are porous. The density varies according to moisture content: at 15% moisture content it is 660 kg/m. The heartwood is yellowish to golden-brown. Sapwood is whitish to pale yellowish brown. It can easily separate from heartwood. Teak darkens as it ages. There can be a large variation, depending on which region the teak is from. Old growth has much tighter rings than new growth. There is a leather-like scent in newly cut wood.

== Botanical history ==
&quot;Tectona grandis&quot; was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus the Younger in his 1782 work &quot;Supplementum Plantarum&quot;. In 1975, Harold Norman Moldenke published new descriptions of four forms of this species in the journal &quot;Phytologia&quot;. Moldenke described each form as varying slightly from the type specimen: &quot;T. grandis&quot; f. &quot;canescens&quot; is distinguished from the type material by being densely or covered in hairs, on the underside of the leaf, &quot;T. grandis&quot; f. &quot;pilosula&quot; is distinct from the type material in the varying morphology of the leaf veins, &quot;T. grandis&quot; f. &quot;punctata&quot; is only hairy on the larger veins on the underside of the leaf, and &quot;T. grandis&quot; f. &quot;tomentella&quot; is noted for its dense yellowish hairs on the lower surface of the leaf.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;teak&quot; comes via the Portuguese from Malayalam (cognate with Tamil , Telugu , and Kannada ). Central Province teak and Nagpur teak are named for those regions of India.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Tectona grandis&quot; is one of three species in the genus &quot;Tectona&quot;. The other two species, &quot;T. hamiltoniana&quot; and &quot;T. philippinensis&quot;, are endemics with relatively small native distributions in Myanmar and the Philippines, respectively. &quot;Tectona grandis&quot; is native to India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Myanmar, northern Thailand, and northwestern Laos.

&quot;Tectona grandis&quot; is found in a variety of habitats and climatic conditions from arid areas with only 500 mm of rain per year to very moist forests with up to 5,000 mm of rain per year. Typically, though, the annual rainfall in areas where teak grows averages 1,250–1,650 mm with a 3–5 month dry season.

== Cultivation ==

Teak&#x27;s natural oils make it useful in exposed locations and make the timber termite- and pest-resistant. Teak is durable even when not treated with oil or varnish. Timber cut from old teak trees was once believed to be more durable and harder than plantation-grown teak. Studies have shown that plantation teak performs on par with old-growth teak in erosion rate, dimensional stability, warping, and surface checking, but is more susceptible to colour change from UV exposure.

The vast majority of commercially harvested teak is grown on teak plantations found in Indonesia and controlled by Perum Perhutani (a state-owned forest enterprise) that manages the country&#x27;s forests. The primary use of teak harvested in Indonesia is in the production of outdoor teak furniture for export. Nilambur in Kerala, India, is also a major producer of teak and is home to the world&#x27;s oldest teak plantation.

Teak consumption raises several environmental concerns, such as the disappearance of rare old-growth teak. However, its popularity has led to growth in sustainable plantation teak production throughout the seasonally dry tropics in forestry plantations. The Forest Stewardship Council offers certification of sustainably grown and harvested teak products. Propagation of teak via tissue culture for plantation purposes is commercially viable.

Teak plantations were widely established in Equatorial Africa during the Colonial era. These timber resources, as well as the oil reserves, are at the heart of the current (2014) South Sudanese conflict.

Much of the world&#x27;s teak is exported by Indonesia and Myanmar. There is also a rapidly growing plantation-grown market in Central America (Costa Rica) and South America. With a depletion of remaining natural hectares of teak forests, growth in plantations in Latin America is expected to rise.

&quot;Hyblaea puera&quot;, commonly known as the teak defoliator, is a moth native to southeast Asia. It is a teak pest whose caterpillar feeds on teak and other species of trees common in the region of Southeast Asia.

== Uses ==
Teak&#x27;s high oil content, high tensile strength, and tight grain make it particularly suitable where weather resistance is desired. It is used in the manufacture of outdoor furniture and boat decks. It is also used for cutting boards, indoor flooring, countertops, and as a veneer for indoor finishings. Although easily worked, it can cause severe blunting on edged tools because of the presence of silica in the wood. Over time teak can weather to a silvery-grey finish, especially when exposed to sunlight.

Teak is used extensively in India to make doors and window frames, furniture, and columns, and beams in homes. It is resistant to termite attacks and damage caused by other insects. Mature teak fetches a very good price. It is grown extensively by forest departments of different states in forest areas. It was also used in the construction of the Kaaba in the Masjid al-Haram of Mecca, which is the holiest structure in the Islamic faith.

Leaves of the teak wood tree are used in making Pellakai gatti (jackfruit dumpling), where batter is poured into a teak leaf and steamed. This type of usage is found in the coastal district of Udupi in the Tulunadu region in South India. The leaves are also used in gudeg, a dish of young jackfruit made in Central Java, Indonesia, and give the dish its dark brown colour.

Teak is used as a food plant by the larvae of moths of the genus &quot;Endoclita&quot; including &quot;E. aroura&quot;, &quot;E. chalybeatus&quot;, &quot;E. damor&quot;, &quot;E. gmelina&quot;, &quot;E. malabaricus&quot;, &quot;E. sericeus&quot; and &quot;E. signifer&quot; other Lepidoptera including the turnip moth.

=== Boatbuilding ===
Teak has been used as a boatbuilding material for over 2000 years (it was found in an archaeological dig in Berenice Panchrysos, a port on the Indian Roman trade route). In addition to relatively high strength, teak is also highly resistant to rot, fungi, and mildew. The wood has a relatively low shrinkage ratio, which makes it excellent for applications where it undergoes periodic changes in moisture. Teak has the unusual property of being both an excellent structural timber for framing or planking, while at the same time being easily worked and finished, unlike some otherwise similar woods such as purpleheart. For this reason, it is also prized for the trim work on boat interiors. Due to the oily nature of the wood, care must be taken to properly prepare the wood before gluing.

When used on boats, teak is also very flexible in the finishes that may be applied. One option is to use no finish at all, in which case the wood will naturally weather to a pleasing silver grey. The wood may also be oiled with a finishing agent such as linseed or tung oil. This results in a somewhat dull finish. Finally, teak may also be varnished for a deep, lustrous glow.

Teak is also used extensively in boat decks, as it is extremely durable but requires regular maintenance. The teak tends to wear into the softer &#x27;summer&#x27; growth bands first, forming a natural &#x27;non-slip&#x27; surface. Any sanding is therefore only damaging. The use of modern cleaning compounds, oils or preservatives will shorten the life of the teak, as it contains natural teak oil a very small distance below the white surface. Wooden boat experts will only wash the teak with salt water, and re-caulk when needed. This cleans the deck and prevents it from drying out and the wood shrinking. The salt helps it absorb and retain moisture and prevents any mildew and algal growth. Over-maintenance, such as cleaning teak with harsh chemicals, can shorten its usable lifespan as decking.

==Propagation==

Teak is propagated mainly from seeds. Germination of the seeds involves pretreatment to remove dormancy arising from the thick pericarp. Pretreatment involves alternate wetting and drying of the seed. The seeds are soaked in water for 12 hours and then spread to dry in the sun for 12 hours. This is repeated for 10–14 days and then the seeds are sown in shallow germination beds of coarse peat covered by sand. The seeds then germinate after 15 to 30 days.

Clonal propagation of teak has been successfully done through grafting, rooted stem cuttings, and micropropagation. While bud grafting onto seedling root stock has been the method used for establishing clonal seed orchards that enables assemblage of clones of the superior trees to encourage crossing, rooted stem cuttings and micro propagated plants are being increasingly used around the world for raising clonal plantations.

== Illegal logging ==

Illegal logging is prevalent in countries with natural teak forests, including India and Burma.

Since 1989, the state-owned Myanma Timber Enterprise has run the country&#x27;s logging industry. In 2014, Myanmar&#x27;s government imposed a strict ban on exporting wild-grown teak logs. In 2015, 153 Chinese loggers were sentenced to life in prison for illegal logging. Illegal teak logging persists, especially in contested areas. While it is illegal for timber to be exported via land borders, 95% of Myanmar&#x27;s teak enters China through the China–Myanmar border.

Since the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état, illegal logging of teak and tamalan trees has surged in Sagaing Region, predominantly in key contested battlegrounds, including Kani, Yinmabin, Kantbalu, Indaw, and Banmauk townships. Both the Burmese military and resistance groups have profited from the illegal logging trade. Smugglers transport the wood to India to circumvent economic sanctions and use the Myanma Timber Enterprise to license the wood as being sourced from permitted areas.

EU regulation

The regulation that addresses the import of timber, including teak, into the EU from unknown or illegal sources is the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) No. 995/2010. This regulation aims to prevent the trade of illegally harvested timber and timber products within the EU market. It places an obligation on operators who place timber and timber products on the EU market to ensure they are legally harvested.

This regulation specifically applies to teak and other high-risk timber species, particularly those sourced from countries with poor forest governance or illegal logging activities. Myanmar, for example, has been a focus due to concerns over illegal teak harvesting from there.

== World&#x27;s largest living teak tree ==
Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry (Myanmar) found the world&#x27;s two biggest living teak trees on 28 August 2017 in Homalin Township, Sagaing Region, Myanmar. The biggest one, named Homemalynn 1, is in diameter and tall. The second biggest one, named Homemalynn 2, is in diameter.

Previously, the world&#x27;s biggest recorded teak tree was located within the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary in the Palakkad District of Kerala in India, named Kannimara. The tree is approximately tall. Its age is between 450 and 500 years and is considered one of the oldest teak trees in the world.

In 2017, a tree was discovered in the Ottakallan area of the Thundathil range of the Malayattoor Forest Division in Kerala with a girth of and a height of . A teak tree in Kappayam, Edamalayar, Kerala, which used to be considered the biggest, has a girth of 7.23 metres.

Tree No. 23 is the oldest planted teak on earth. It is located in Conolly&#x27;s plot (the world&#x27;s oldest teak plantation), Nilambur, Kerala.

<text>The Honda CR-X (styled in some markets as Honda CRX), originally launched as the [[Honda Ballade]] Sports CR-X in Japan, is a front-wheel-drive sport compact car manufactured by Honda from 1983 until 1991 with nearly 400,000 produced during this period. The first-generation CRX was marketed in some regions outside Japan as the Honda Civic CRX. Although there are many supposed definitions for the initialism CR-X, the most widely accepted is &quot;Civic Renaissance Experimental&quot;. 

In the U.S., the CRX was marketed as an economy sport Kammback with room for two passengers while Japanese and European market cars came with a 2+2 seating arrangement. Redesigned for the 1988 model year and produced until 1991, the CRX was popular for its performance, nimble handling, and good fuel economy. The CR-X was replaced by Honda&#x27;s CR-X del Sol, which was marketed as a CR-X in some markets.


==First generation==
===Overview===

In 1983 for the 1984 model year, Honda introduced an all-new two-seater that shared the drivetrain with the Civic but offered unique styling and interior furnishings. At its introduction, the CR-X was available in Japan through &quot;Honda Verno&quot; dealership sales channels, and accompanied the Vigor, the Quint, and the Prelude. In North America, the CRX was marketed in two versions: economy and sport. The economy model used a new aluminum 1.3-liter CVCC four-cylinder engine. The sportier model featured an aluminum 1.5-liter 12-valve engine and was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic transmission.

For 1985, Honda North America replaced the economy model with an HF (high fuel) model featuring a 1.5-liter engine which uses an aluminum block but the 1984 CVCC cylinder head (two valves per cylinder) instead of the new aluminum head with three valves per cylinder. In spring 1985, Honda introduced an Si (Sports, injected) model featuring a more powerful 1.5-liter SOHC PGM-FI four-cylinder engine. The Si model included a power sunroof, standard dual remote exterior mirrors, rear wiper, 13-inch alloy wheels and an Si-exclusive ducktail spoiler for the hatch.

For 1986, Honda updated the CRX with new aerodynamic headlights. The Si received body color matched lower cladding, a revised rear spoiler, new bumper covers and 14-inch alloy wheels. The interior was upgraded and added a center console with cassette tape storage. 1987 was virtually unchanged from 1986 and would be the final year of the first-generation CRX.

===Inspiration===
The CR-X design was inspired by the Alfa Romeo GT Junior Zagato which the Honda CR-X designer owned.

===Japanese and European market drivetrain===
The Japanese Si and European 1.6i-16 models came with a 1.6-litre 16-valve DOHC 4-cylinder engine putting out in the UK-spec model and in the JDM model. Though similar versions of the same engine, the Japanese Si engine was stamped ZC, while the European engine was stamped ZC1. 

===Fuel economy===
The original 1.3-liter car (chassis code AE532) had an EPA highway mileage rating of in 1984 and was reported to often achieve over in favorable driving conditions. The later 1.5-liter American-market CRX HF (high fuel economy) model (chassis codes EC1 and AF) could also reliably achieve very good gas mileage, more than a decade before gas-electric hybrids appeared on the market, and at no price premium over the base model; the 1.5-liter is rated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (under the new rating system) at city and highway.

==Second generation==
===Overview===
The Honda CR-X was completely redesigned by late 1987 for the 1988 model year. The wheelbase increased overall, length increased by and width is nearly wider than the previous model. The suspension was completely redesigned. Honda abandoned the original torsion bar in the front and beam axle with trailing link in the rear in favor of a 4-wheel double-wishbone suspension. The larger design and revised suspension brought improvements in handling as well passenger and cargo space versus the previous generation.

The CR-X received a mild refresh for the 1990 model year. The VTEC equipped models also received a makeover with updated bumpers, lights, hood, brakes, suspension and dashboard design amongst other features. Additionally, some of these design changes were added to the concurrent non-VTEC models.

One of the options for the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) CR-X was a glass roof, a fixed glass panel which stretched from the top of the windshield to the top of the hatch opening. Relatively common in Japan, these are sought-after models in other markets.

===Japanese and European market drivetrain===
Outside of North America, the second generation CR-X was available with a 1.5-litre SOHC 4-cylinder engine or an updated version of the 1.6-litre DOHC 4-cylinder (ZC) engine. Many of these were fitted with fuel injection as standard.

In September 1989, Honda added the 1.6-litre 16-valve DOHC VTEC 4-cylinder B16A engine to the lineup outside of North America. The VTEC (variable valve timing and lift electronic control) engine provided increased power at high RPMs while still allowing low fuel consumption and better idling at low RPMs. The B16A produced in the Japanese SiR model and in the B16A1 that came in the European 1.6i-VT model. The CR-X was the second car to receive a DOHC VTEC engine, shortly after the Honda Integra XSi.

The CR-X equipped with the 1.6-litre DOHC 4-cylinder engine or the 1.6-litre DOHC VTEC 4-cylinder engine came with a different bonnet since the twin-cam engines were taller and required additional bonnet clearances in comparison to the SOHC engines. The 1.6-litre DOHC engine was only slightly taller than the 1.6-litre SOHC engine and required a different bonnet with a bump on one side which offered the additional necessary clearance to clear the cam gear cover. Cars equipped with a 1.6-litre DOHC VTEC 4-cylinder engine came with a bonnet that was raised across most of the engine bay to offer additional overall clearance for the taller engine.

In some LHD European markets, there was also the option of the D14A1 engine with automatic gearbox which featured twin carburetors.

ABS was optional on the Japanese SiR and came standard on the UK 1.6i-VT model, but never came on the LHD European 1.6i-VT.

===US market===
In the US, three different trim levels were available: The standard (unlabeled, sometimes called the &quot;DX&quot;) equipped with the 1.5-liter 16-valve dual-point fuel injection 4-cylinder D15B2 engine, the HF (&quot;high fuel efficiency&quot;) model with the 1.5-liter 8-valve multi-point fuel injection (MPFI) 4-cylinder D15B6 engine, or the Si (sport injected) model with the 1.6-liter 16-valve MPFI 4-cylinder D16A6 engine. The base model was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission while the HF and Si only offered a 5-speed manual transmission. A modification made to the rear on all second-generation vehicles is a heavily-stippled black glass panel installed on the upper half of the rear of the vehicle, above the tail lights which aided in rearward visibility.

====Features and equipment====
Air conditioning was a dealer-installed option on all models. The Si model came with a power-sliding sunroof, a rear wiper and 14-inch alloy wheels. Underneath, the Si model was equipped with a rear anti-sway bar along with variable-ratio rack-and-pinion steering. The 90-91 Si models had 4-wheel disc brakes.

====Colors and trim====
There were a total of six colors offered each model year. Four color options were available on the CRX and CRX Si and two color options were available for the CRX HF. Color availability would vary based on trim package and the interior color would depend on the exterior color choice.

====Model updates====
1988
*First year of the second-generation CRX.

1989
*Si and base model change to door-mounted seatbelts to comply with federal regulations. Revision due to automatic seatbelt requirements.
*Si model&#x27;s horsepower increased to ( in 1988) due to a revised camshaft.

1990
*Minor changes to headlights, bumpers and taillights.
*Instrument cover is now slightly more rounded.
*Hazard switch relocated to the dashboard.
*Si models now come equipped with four-wheel disc brakes.
*Si models receive updated 14-inch alloy wheels.
*Blade silver color is discontinued and replaced by Polar white.

1991
*Barbados yellow color is replaced by Tahitian green on the Si model.
*Polar white color is replaced by Frost white.
*Final year of the second-generation CRX.

====Production by model year====

==Third generation==
In 1992, Honda replaced the CR-X with a new, targa topped, Civic-based model called the Honda CR-X del Sol. The CR-X del Sol was also badged as the Civic del Sol and later the del Sol in some markets, and known simply as the CR-X in others. It is because of this that the del Sol is generally considered the &quot;third-generation CR-X&quot; among enthusiasts. In the United States, the del Sol came in three trim lines: S (VXi in Japan, later VGi), Si (ESi in Europe), and VTEC (VTi in Europe); the JDM SiR model featured a 1.6-liter B16 SiR-II DOHC VTEC 4-cylinder engine. Production of the del Sol ended in 1997 in North America, elsewhere in 1998 and thus, the CR-X line was retired.

==Comparison to other Honda vehicles==
Articles on the first-generation Honda Insight have compared its appearance to that of the 1984–1991 CRX.

In 2010, thirteen years after the end of CRX production, Honda released the CR-Z, regarded as the spiritual successor to the CRX.

==Awards==
* 1984: The Honda CRX is named &quot;Motor Trend&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Import Car of the Year&quot;
* 1985: The Honda CRX is included in Car and Driver&#x27;s 10Best
* 1988: The Honda CRX is included in Car and Driver&#x27;s 10Best
* 1988: The Honda CRX Si is named &quot;Motor Trend&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Import Car of the Year&quot;
* 1988: The Honda CRX Si was named &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; as &quot;One of the Ten Best Cars&quot;
* 1990: The Honda CRX is named &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s &quot;Import Car of the Year&quot;

Consumer reporter David Horowitz tested the 1984 CRX&#x27;s fuel economy claim in a &quot;Commercial Challenge&quot; on his TV series &quot;Fight Back!&quot; commercials for the CRX claimed it could reach 60 miles per gallon fuel economy; according to Horowitz&#x27;s test, it bested that figure, reaching 65 miles per gallon, and passed the test.

==Safety==
In Australia, the 1988–1991 CR-X was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 as providing &quot;significantly worse than average&quot; protection for its occupants in the event of side impact. Both versions of the CR-X got good safety marks (4 and 5 stars) in the NHTSA Crash Test Results for 1997 US NCAP.

The US version of the second-generation CR-X employed the use of side-impact door beams on some models. These models can be identified by the mounting position of the safety belts. If the belt is mounted in the door, the beams are present. If the belt is mounted in the body, there is no additional reinforcement. 1988 and 1989 HFs along with 1988 Sis and base models have the B-pillar mounted restraints, like all versions sold outside of the US.

===United States===
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the United States has determined frontal crash test ratings of Honda CRX of different model years.
==Motorsport==

Like the Civic, due to the wide availability of parts, the CR-X is popular for motorsport usage. In the United Kingdom, there was a one-make series dedicated to the series 2 of the CR-X which soldiered on a few years after the series 3 was introduced and was popular for showroom stock racing series. Today, the car is popular for use in drag, autocross and road racing events.

===Twin-engine CRX===
As featured in the May 1985 issue of &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, Project Synchronicity Honda CRX was a collaboration between American Honda and Racing Beat to install a second 1.5-liter engine with automatic transmission into the hatchback cargo area. The installation of the second powertrain &quot;took six months and cost $20,000 dollars&quot;. Phase Two of the project was to have Racing Beat install two 1.8-liter engines with automatic transmissions from the Honda Accord into Synchronicity. The Honda CRX would be called Super Synchronicity because of the increase of performance from two larger engines. Both Honda Accord 1.8-liter powertrains were fuel injected and upgrades were made to the suspension. A Mugen body kit and upgraded wheels were also installed.

==Convertibles==
The R. Straman Company of Costa Mesa, CA converted 310 Honda CRXs into convertibles from 1984 until 1987. The Straman-built CRX Spyder was the cover car on the July 1984 issue of &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine.

<text>The Kingdom of the Franks (), also known as the Frankish Kingdom, or just Francia, was the largest post-Roman barbarian kingdom in Western Europe. It was ruled by the Frankish Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties during the Early Middle Ages. Francia was among the last surviving Germanic kingdoms from the Migration Period era.

Originally, the core Frankish territories inside the former Western Roman Empire were located close to the Rhine and Meuse rivers in the north, but Frankish chiefs such as Chlodio would eventually expand their influence within Roman territory as far as the Somme river in the 5th century.

Childeric I, a Salian Frankish king, was one of several military leaders commanding Roman forces of various ethnic affiliations in the northern part of what is now France. His son, Clovis I, succeeded in unifying most of Gaul under his rule in the 6th century by notably conquering Soissons in 486 and Aquitaine in 507 following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, as well as establishing leadership over all the Frankish kingdoms on or near the Rhine frontier; thus founding what would come to be known as the Merovingian dynasty. The dynasty subsequently gained control over a significant part of what is now western and southern Germany. It was by building upon the basis of these Merovingian deeds that the subsequent Carolingian dynasty— through the nearly continuous campaigns of Pepin of Herstal, his son Charles Martel, grandson Pepin the Short, and great-grandson Charlemagne— secured the greatest expansion of the Frankish state by the early 9th century. Charlemagne also received the Roman imperial crown in 800, thus creating the &quot;Frankish-Roman Empire&quot;, which is also referred to as the Carolingian Empire, or just the &quot;Frankish Empire&quot; ().

During the reign of the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties, the Frankish realm was one large polity, generally subdivided into several smaller kingdoms ruled by different members of the ruling dynasties. Whilst these kingdoms coordinated, they also regularly came into conflict with one another. The old Frankish lands, for example, were initially contained within the kingdom of Austrasia, centred on the Rhine and Meuse, roughly corresponding to later Lower Lotharingia. The bulk of the Gallo-Roman territory to its south and west was called Neustria. The exact borders and number of these subkingdoms varied over time, until a basic split between eastern and western domains became persistent. After various treaties and conflicts in the late-9th and early-10th centuries, West Francia came under control of the Capetian dynasty, becoming the Kingdom of France, while East Francia and Lotharingia came under the control of the non-Frankish Ottonian dynasty, becoming the Kingdom of Germany, which would conquer Burgundy and Italy to then form the medieval Holy Roman Empire. Competing French and German nationalisms in later centuries would claim succession from Charlemagne and the original kingdom, but nowadays both have become seen by many as Pan-European symbols.

==Historical periods==
===Origins, the early Frankish period===

The term &quot;Franks&quot; emerged in the 3rd century AD as a term for several Germanic tribes who settled on the northern Rhine frontier of the Roman Empire, including the Bructeri, Ampsivarii, Chamavi, Chattuarii and Salians. While all of them had a tradition of participating in the Roman military, the Salians were allowed to settle within the Roman Empire. In 358, having already been living in the &quot;civitas&quot; of Batavia for some time, Emperor Julian defeated the Chamavi and Salians, allowing the latter to settle further away from the border, in Toxandria.

Some of the early Frankish leaders, such as Flavius Bauto and Arbogast, were committed to the cause of the Romans, but other Frankish rulers, such as Mallobaudes, were active on Roman soil for other reasons. After the fall of Arbogastes, his son Arigius succeeded in establishing a hereditary countship at Trier and after the fall of the usurper Constantine III some Franks supported the usurper Jovinus (411). Jovinus was dead by 413, but the Romans found it increasingly difficult to manage the Franks within their borders. The Frankish king Theudemer was executed by the sword, in c. 422.

Around 428, the king Chlodio, whose kingdom may have been in the &quot;civitas Tungrorum&quot; (with its capital in Tongeren), launched an attack on Roman territory and extended his realm as far as &quot;Camaracum&quot; (Cambrai) and the Somme river. Though Sidonius Apollinaris relates that Flavius Aetius defeated a wedding party of his people (c. 431), this period marks the beginning of a situation that would endure for many centuries: the Germanic Franks ruled over an increasing number of Gallo-Roman subjects.

The Merovingians, believed by some in the latter half of the 6th century to be relatives of Chlodio as reported by Gregory of Tours (although, he himself did not share this belief), arose from within the Gallo-Roman military, with Childeric and his son Clovis being called &quot;King of the Franks&quot; in the Gallo-Roman military, even before having any Frankish territorial kingdom. Once Clovis defeated his Roman competitor for power in northern Gaul, Syagrius, he turned to the kings of the Franks to the north and east, as well as other post-Roman kingdoms already existing in Gaul: Visigoths, Burgundians, and Alemanni.

The original core territory of the Frankish kingdom later came to be known as Austrasia (the &quot;eastern lands&quot;), while the large Romanised Frankish kingdom in the west came to be known as Neustria.

===Merovingian period===
====Merovingian rise and decline, 481–687====
Chlodio&#x27;s successors are obscure figures, but what can be certain is that Childeric I, possibly his grandson, ruled a Salian kingdom from Tournai as a &quot;foederatus&quot; of the Romans. Childeric is chiefly important to history for bequeathing the Franks to his son Clovis, who began an effort to extend his authority over the other Frankish tribes and to expand their &quot;territorium&quot; south and west into Gaul. Clovis converted to Christianity and put himself on good terms with the powerful Church and with his Gallo-Roman subjects.

In a thirty-year reign (481–511) Clovis defeated the Roman general Syagrius and conquered the Kingdom of Soissons, defeated the Alemanni (Battle of Tolbiac in 496) and established Frankish hegemony over them. Clovis defeated the Visigoths (Battle of Vouillé in 507) and conquered all of their territory north of the Pyrenees save Septimania, and conquered the Bretons (according to Gregory of Tours) and made them vassals of the Franks. He also incorporated the various Roman military settlements (&quot;laeti&quot;) scattered over Gaul: the Saxons of Bessin, the Britons and the Alans of Armorica and Loire valley or the Taifals of Poitou to name a few prominent ones. By the end of his life, Clovis ruled all of Gaul save the Gothic province of Septimania and the Burgundian kingdom in the southeast.

The exact date on which Clovis became &quot;king of all Franks&quot; is not known, but it happened sometime after the Battle of Vouillé, which is securely dated to 507. One year after this battle, Clovis made Paris his capital, and in the Christmas Day of the same year he converted to Catholicism, and some time later he orchestrated the murders of Frankish kings Sigobert and Ragnachar, uniting all Franks under his rule. The sole source for this early period is Gregory of Tours, who wrote around the year 590. His chronology for the reigns of the early kings is almost certainly fabricated, often contradicting itself and other sources. Clovis&#x27; baptism, traditionally dated to 496, is now believed to have taken place in 508.

The Merovingians were a hereditary monarchy. The Frankish kings adhered to the practice of partible inheritance: dividing their lands among their sons. Even when multiple Merovingian kings ruled, the kingdom—not unlike the late Roman Empire—was conceived of as a single realm ruled collectively by several kings and the turn of events could result in the reunification of the whole realm under a single king. The Merovingian kings ruled by divine right and their kingship was symbolised daily by their long hair and initially by their acclamation, which was carried out by raising the king on a shield in accordance with the ancient Germanic practice of electing a war-leader at an assembly of the warriors.

===== Clovis&#x27;s sons =====
At the death of Clovis, his kingdom was divided territorially by his four adult sons in such a way that each son was granted a comparable portion of fiscal land, which was probably land once part of the Roman fisc, now seized by the Frankish government.
Clovis&#x27;s sons made their capitals near the Frankish heartland in northeastern Gaul. Theuderic I made his capital at Reims, Chlodomer at Orléans, Childebert I at Paris, and Chlothar I at Soissons. During their reigns, the Thuringii (532), Burgundes (534), and Saxons and Frisians (c. 560) were incorporated into the Frankish kingdom. The outlying trans-Rhenish tribes were loosely attached to Frankish sovereignty, and though they could be forced to contribute to Frankish military efforts, in times of weak kings they were uncontrollable and liable to attempt independence. The Romanised Burgundian kingdom, however, was preserved in its territoriality by the Franks and converted into one of their primary divisions, incorporating the central Gallic heartland of Chlodomer&#x27;s realm with its capital at Orléans.

The fraternal kings showed only intermittent signs of friendship and were often in rivalry. On the early death of Chlodomer, his brother Chlothar had his young sons murdered in order to take a share of his kingdom, which was, in accordance with custom, divided between the surviving brothers. Theuderic died in 534, but his adult son Theudebert I was capable of defending his inheritance, which formed the largest of the Frankish subkingdoms and the kernel of the later kingdom of Austrasia.

Theudebert was the first Frankish king to formally sever his ties to the Roman Emperor in Constantinople by striking gold coins with his own image on them and calling himself &quot;magnus rex&quot; (great king) because of his supposed suzerainty over peoples as far away as Pannonia. Theudebert interfered in the Gothic War on the side of the Gepids and Lombards against the Ostrogoths, receiving the provinces of Raetia, Noricum, and part of Veneto.

===== Chlothar =====
His son and successor, Theudebald, was unable to retain them and on his death all of his vast kingdom passed to Chlothar, under whom, with the death of Childebert in 558, the entire Frankish realm was reunited under the rule of one king.

In 561 Chlothar died and his realm was divided, in a replay of the events of fifty years prior, between his four sons, with the chief cities remaining the same. The eldest son, Charibert I, inherited the kingdom with its capital at Paris and ruled all of western Gaul. The second eldest, Guntram, inherited the old kingdom of the Burgundians, augmented by the lands of central France around the old capital of Orléans, which became his chief city, and most of Provence.

The rest of Provence, the Auvergne, and eastern Aquitaine were assigned to the third son, Sigebert I, who also inherited Austrasia with its chief cities of Reims and Metz. The smallest kingdom was that of Soissons, which went to the youngest son, Chilperic I. The kingdom Chilperic ruled at his death (584) became the nucleus of later Neustria.

This second fourfold division was quickly ruined by fratricidal wars, waged largely over the murder of Galswintha, the wife of Chilperic, allegedly by his mistress (and second wife) Fredegund. Galswintha&#x27;s sister, the wife of Sigebert, Brunhilda, incited her husband to war and the conflict between the two queens continued to plague relations until the next century. Guntram sought to keep the peace, though he also attempted twice (585 and 589) to conquer Septimania from the Goths, but was defeated both times.

All the surviving brothers benefited at the death of Charibert, but Chilperic was also able to extend his authority during the period of war by bringing the Bretons to heel again. After his death, Guntram had to again force the Bretons to submit. In 587, the Treaty of Andelot — the text of which explicitly refers to the entire Frankish realm as &quot;Francia&quot; — between Brunhilda and Guntram secured his protection of her young son Childebert II, who had succeeded the assassinated Sigebert (575). Together the territory of Guntram and Childebert was well over thrice as large as the small realm of Chilperic&#x27;s successor, Chlothar II. During this period Francia took on the tripartite character it was to have throughout the rest of its history, being composed of Neustria, Austrasia, and Burgundy.

===== Francia split into Neustria, Austrasia, and Burgundy =====
When Guntram died in 592, Burgundy went to Childebert in its entirety, but he died in 595. His two sons divided the kingdom, with the elder Theudebert II taking Austrasia plus Childebert&#x27;s portion of Aquitaine, while his younger brother Theuderic II inherited Burgundy and Guntram&#x27;s Aquitaine. United, the brothers sought to remove their father&#x27;s cousin Chlothar II from power and they did succeed in conquering most of his kingdom, reducing him to only a few cities, but they failed to capture him.

In 599 they routed his forces at Dormelles and seized the Dentelin, but they then fell foul of each other and the remainder of their time on the thrones was spent in infighting, often incited by their grandmother Brunhilda, who, angered over her expulsion from Theudebert&#x27;s court, convinced Theuderic to unseat him and kill him. In 612 he did and the whole realm of his father Childebert was once again ruled by one man. This was short-lived, however, as he died on the eve of preparing an expedition against Chlothar in 613, leaving a young son named Sigebert II.

During their reigns, Theudebert and Theuderic campaigned successfully in Gascony, where they had established the Duchy of Gascony and brought the Basques to submission (602). This original Gascon conquest included lands south of the Pyrenees, namely Biscay and Gipuzkoa, but these were lost to the Visigoths in 612.

On the opposite end of his realm, the Alemanni had defeated Theuderic in a rebellion and the Franks were losing their hold on the trans-Rhenish tribes. In 610 Theudebert had extorted the Duchy of Alsace from Theuderic, beginning a long period of conflict over which kingdom was to have the region of Alsace, Burgundy or Austrasia, which was only terminated in the late seventh century.

During the brief minority of Sigebert II, the office of the Mayor of the Palace, which had for sometime been visible in the kingdoms of the Franks, came to the fore in its internal politics, with a faction of nobles coalescing around the persons of Warnachar II, Rado, and Pepin of Landen, to give the kingdom over to Chlothar in order to remove Brunhilda, the young king&#x27;s regent, from power. Warnachar was himself already the mayor of the palace of Austrasia, while Rado and Pepin were to find themselves rewarded with mayoral offices after Chlothar&#x27;s coup succeeded and Brunhilda and the ten-year-old king were killed.

=====Rule of Chlothar II =====
Immediately after his victory, Chlothar II promulgated the Edict of Paris (614), which has generally been viewed as a concession to the nobility, though this view has come under recent criticism. The Edict primarily sought to guarantee justice and end corruption in government, but it also entrenched the regional differences between the three kingdoms of Francia and probably granted the nobles more control over judicial appointments.

By 623 the Austrasians had begun to clamour for a king of their own, since Chlothar was so often absent from the kingdom and, because of his upbringing and previous rule in the Seine basin, was more or less an outsider there. Chlothar thus granted that his son Dagobert I would be their king and he was duly acclaimed by the Austrasian warriors in the traditional fashion. Nonetheless, though Dagobert exercised true authority in his realm, Chlothar maintained ultimate control over the whole Frankish kingdom.
During the joint reign of Chlothar and Dagobert, who have been called &quot;the last ruling Merovingians&quot;, the Saxons, who had been loosely attached to Francia since the late 550s, rebelled under Berthoald, Duke of Saxony, and were defeated and reincorporated into the kingdom by the joint action of father and son. When Chlothar died in 628, Dagobert, in accordance with his father&#x27;s wishes, granted a subkingdom to his younger brother Charibert II. This subkingdom, commonly called Aquitaine, was a new creation.

===== Dagobert I =====

Dagobert, in his dealings with the Saxons, Alemans, and Thuringii, as well as the Slavs beyond the borders of Francia, upon whom he tried to force tribute but who instead defeated him under their king Samo at the Battle of Wogastisburg in 631, made all the far eastern peoples subject to the court of Neustria and not of Austrasia. This, first and foremost, incited the Austrasians to request a king of their own from the royal household.

The subkingdom of Aquitaine corresponded to the southern half of the old Roman province of Aquitania and its capital was at Toulouse. The other cities of his kingdom were Cahors, Agen, Périgueux, Bordeaux, and Saintes; the duchy of Vasconia was also part of his allotment. Charibert campaigned successfully against the Basques, but after his death they revolted again (632). At the same time the Bretons rose up against Frankish suzerainty. In 635 an army sent by Dagobert subdued the Basques, while threats of military action induced the Breton leader Judicael to relent, make peace with the Franks, and pay tribute.

Meanwhile, Dagobert had Charibert&#x27;s infant successor Chilperic assassinated and reunited the entire Frankish realm again (632), though he was forced by the strong Austrasian aristocracy to grant his own son Sigebert III to them as a subking in 633. This act was precipitated largely by the Austrasians&#x27; desire to be self-governing at a time when Neustrians dominated at the royal court. Chlothar had been the king at Paris for decades before becoming the king at Metz as well and the Merovingian monarchy was ever after him to be a Neustrian monarchy first and foremost.

Indeed, it is in the 640s that &quot;Neustria&quot; first appears in writing, its late appearance relative to &quot;Austrasia&quot; probably due to the fact that Neustrians (who formed the bulk of the authors of the time) called their region simply &quot;Francia&quot;. &quot;Burgundia&quot; too defined itself in opposition to Neustria at about this time. However, it was the Austrasians, who had been seen as a distinct people within the realm since the time of Gregory of Tours, who were to make the most strident moves for independence.

The young Sigebert was dominated during his minority by the mayor, Grimoald the Elder, who convinced the childless king to adopt his own Merovingian-named son Childebert as his son and heir. After Dagobert&#x27;s death in 639, the duke of Thuringia, Radulf, rebelled and tried to make himself king. He defeated Sigebert in what was a serious reversal for the ruling dynasty (640).

The king lost the support of many magnates while on campaign and the weakness of the monarchic institutions by that time are evident in his inability to effectively make war without the support of the magnates; in fact, he could not even provide his own bodyguard without the loyal aid of Grimoald and Adalgisel. He is often regarded as the first &quot;roi fainéant&quot;: &quot;do-nothing king&quot;, not insofar as he &quot;did nothing&quot;, but insofar as he accomplished little.

Clovis II, Dagobert&#x27;s successor in Neustria and Burgundy, which were thereafter attached yet ruled separately, was a minor for almost the whole of his reign. He was dominated by his mother Nanthild and the mayor of the Neustrian palace, Erchinoald. Erchinoald&#x27;s successor, Ebroin, dominated the kingdom for the next fifteen years of near-constant civil war. On his death (656), Sigbert&#x27;s son was shipped off to Ireland, while Grimoald&#x27;s son Childebert reigned in Austrasia.

Ebroin eventually reunited the entire Frankish kingdom for Clovis&#x27;s successor Chlothar III by killing Grimoald and removing Childebert in 661. However, the Austrasians demanded a king of their own again and Chlothar installed his younger brother Childeric II. During Chlothar&#x27;s reign, the Franks had made an attack on northwestern Italy, but were driven off by Grimoald, King of the Lombards, near Rivoli.

====Dominance of the mayors of the palace, 687–751====
In 673, Chlothar III died and some Neustrian and Burgundian magnates invited Childeric to become king of the whole realm, but he soon upset some Neustrian magnates and he was assassinated (675).

The reign of Theuderic III was to prove the end of the Merovingian dynasty&#x27;s power. 
Theuderic III succeeded his brother Chlothar III in Neustria in 673, but Childeric II of Austrasia displaced him soon thereafter—until he died in 675, and Theuderic III retook his throne. When Dagobert II died in 679, Theuderic received Austrasia as well and became king of the whole Frankish realm. Thoroughly Neustrian in outlook, he allied with his mayor Berchar and made war on the Austrasian who had installed Dagobert II, Sigebert III&#x27;s son, in their kingdom (briefly in opposition to Clovis III).

In 687 he was defeated by Pepin of Herstal, the Arnulfing mayor of Austrasia and the real power in that kingdom, at the Battle of Tertry and was forced to accept Pepin as sole mayor and &quot;dux et princeps Francorum&quot;: &quot;Duke and Prince of the Franks&quot;, a title which signifies, to the author of the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;, the beginning of Pepin&#x27;s &quot;reign&quot;. Thereafter the Merovingian monarchs showed only sporadically, in our surviving records, any activities of a non-symbolic and self-willed nature.

During the period of confusion in the 670s and 680s, attempts had been made to re-assert Frankish suzerainty over the Frisians, but to no avail. In 689, however, Pepin launched a campaign of conquest in Western Frisia (&quot;Frisia Citerior&quot;) and defeated the Frisian king Radbod near Dorestad, an important trading centre. All the land between the Scheldt and the Vlie was incorporated into Francia.

Then, circa 690, Pepin attacked central Frisia and took Utrecht. In 695 Pepin could even sponsor the foundation of the Archdiocese of Utrecht and the beginning of the conversion of the Frisians under Willibrord. However, Eastern Frisia (&quot;Frisia Ulterior&quot;) remained outside of Frankish suzerainty.

Having achieved great successes against the Frisians, Pepin turned towards the Alemanni. In 709 he launched a war against Willehari, duke of the Ortenau, probably in an effort to force the succession of the young sons of the deceased Gotfrid on the ducal throne. This outside interference led to another war in 712 and the Alemanni were, for the time being, restored to the Frankish fold.

However, in southern Gaul, which was not under Arnulfing influence, the regions were pulling away from the royal court under leaders such as Savaric of Auxerre, Antenor of Provence, and Odo of Aquitaine. The reigns of Clovis IV and Childebert III from 691 until 711 have all the hallmarks of those of &quot;rois fainéants&quot;, though Childebert is founding making royal judgements against the interests of his supposed masters, the Arnulfings.

===== Death of Pepin =====
When Pepin died in 714, however, the Frankish realm plunged into civil war and the dukes of the outlying provinces became &quot;de facto&quot; independent. Pepin&#x27;s appointed successor, Theudoald, under his widow, Plectrude, initially opposed an attempt by the king, Dagobert III, to appoint Ragenfrid as mayor of the palace in all the realms, but soon there was a third candidate for the mayoralty of Austrasia in Pepin&#x27;s illegitimate adult son, Charles Martel.

After the defeat of Plectrude and Theudoald by the king (now Chilperic II) and Ragenfrid, Charles briefly raised a king of his own, Chlothar IV, in opposition to Chilperic. Finally, at a battle near Soisson, Charles definitively defeated his rivals and forced them into hiding, eventually accepting the king back on the condition that he receive his father&#x27;s positions (718). There were no more active Merovingian kings after that point and Charles and his Carolingian heirs ruled the Franks.

After 718 Charles Martel embarked on a series of wars intended to strengthen the Franks&#x27; hegemony in western Europe. In 718 he defeated the rebellious Saxons, in 719 he overran Western Frisia, in 723 he suppressed the Saxons again, and in 724 he defeated Ragenfrid and the rebellious Neustrians, ending the civil war phase of his rule. In 720, when Chilperic II died, he had appointed Theuderic IV king, but this last was a mere puppet of his. In 724 he forced his choice of Hugbert for the ducal succession upon the Bavarians and forced the Alemanni to assist him in his campaigns in Bavaria (725 and 726), where laws were promulgated in Theuderic&#x27;s name. In 730 Alemannia had to be subjugated by the sword and its duke, Lantfrid, was killed. In 734 Charles fought against Eastern Frisia and finally subdued it.

===== Umayyad invasion =====
In the 730s the Umayyad conquerors of Spain, who had also subjugated Septimania, began advancing northwards into central Francia and the Loire valley. It was at this time (circa 736) that Maurontus, the &quot;dux&quot; of Provence, called in the Umayyads to aid him in resisting the expanding influence of the Carolingians. However, Charles invaded the Rhône Valley with his brother Childebrand and a Lombard army and devastated the region. It was because of the alliance against the Arabs that Charles was unable to support Pope Gregory III against the Lombards.

In 732 or 737—modern scholars have debated over the date—Charles marched against an Arab army between Poitiers and Tours and defeated it in a watershed battle that turned back the tide of the Arab advance north of the Pyrenees. But Charles&#x27;s real interests lay in the northeast, primarily with the Saxons, from whom he had to extort the tribute which for centuries they had paid to the Merovingians.

Shortly before his death in October 741, Charles divided the realm as if he were king between his two sons by his first wife, marginalising his younger son Grifo, who did receive a small portion (it is unknown exactly what). Though there had been no king since Theuderic&#x27;s death in 737, Charles&#x27;s sons Pepin the Younger and Carloman were still only mayors of the palaces. The Carolingians had assumed the regal status and practice, though not the regal title, of the Merovingians. The division of the kingdom gave Austrasia, Alemannia, and Thuringia to Carloman and Neustria, Provence, and Burgundy to Pepin. It is indicative of the &quot;de facto&quot; autonomy of the duchies of Aquitaine (under Hunoald) and Bavaria (under Odilo) that they were not included in the division of the &quot;regnum&quot;.

After Charles Martel was buried, in the Abbey of Saint-Denis alongside the Merovingian kings, conflict immediately erupted between Pepin and Carloman on one side and Grifo their younger brother on the other. Though Carloman captured and imprisoned Grifo, it may have been enmity between the elder brothers that caused Pepin to release Grifo while Carloman was on a pilgrimage to Rome. Perhaps in an effort to neutralise his brother&#x27;s ambitions, Carloman initiated the appointment of a new king, Childeric III, drawn from a monastery, in 743. Others have suggested that perhaps the position of the two brothers was weak or challenged, or perhaps there Carloman was merely acting for a loyalist or legitimist party in the kingdom.

In 743 Pepin campaigned against Odilo and forced him to submit to Frankish suzerainty. Carloman also campaigned against the Saxons and the two together defeated a rebellion led by Hunoald at the head of the Basques and another led by Alemanni, in which Liutfrid of Alsatia probably died, either fighting for or against the brothers. In 746, however, the Frankish armies were still, as Carloman was preparing to retire from politics and enter the monastery of Monte Soratte. Pepin&#x27;s position was further stabilised and the path was laid for his assumption of the crown in 751.

===Carolingian period===
====Carolingian Empire, 751–840====


Pepin reigned as an elected king. Although such elections happened infrequently, a general rule in Germanic law stated that the king relied on the support of his leading men. These men reserved the right to choose a new &quot;kingworthy&quot; leader out of the ruling clan if they felt that the old one could not lead them in profitable battle. While in later France the kingdom became hereditary, the kings of the later Holy Roman Empire proved unable to abolish the elective tradition and continued as elected rulers until the empire&#x27;s formal end in 1806.

Pepin solidified his position in 754 by entering into an alliance with Pope Stephen II, who presented the king of the Franks a copy of the forged &quot;Donation of Constantine&quot; at Paris and in a magnificent ceremony at Saint-Denis anointed the king and his family and declared him &quot;patricius Romanorum&quot; (&quot;protector of the Romans&quot;). The following year Pepin fulfilled his promise to the pope and retrieved the Exarchate of Ravenna, recently fallen to the Lombards, and returned it to the Papacy.

Pepin donated the re-conquered areas around Rome to the Pope, laying the foundation for the Papal States in the &quot;Donation of Pepin&quot; which he laid on the tomb of St Peter. The papacy had good cause to expect that the remade Frankish monarchy would provide a deferential power base (&quot;potestas&quot;) in the creation of a new world order, centred on the Pope.

Upon Pepin&#x27;s death in 768, his sons, Charles and Carloman, once again divided the kingdom between themselves. However, Carloman withdrew to a monastery and died shortly thereafter, leaving sole rule to his brother, who would later become known as Charlemagne or Charles the Great, a powerful, intelligent, and modestly literate figure who became a legend for the later history of both France and Germany. Charlemagne restored an equal balance between emperor and pope.

From 772 onwards, Charles conquered and eventually defeated the Saxons to incorporate their realm into the Frankish kingdom. This campaign expanded the practice of non-Roman Christian rulers undertaking the conversion of their neighbours by armed force; Frankish Catholic missionaries, along with others from Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, had entered Saxon lands since the mid-8th century, resulting in increasing conflict with the Saxons, who resisted the missionary efforts and parallel military incursions.

Charles&#x27;s main Saxon opponent, Widukind, accepted baptism in 785 as part of a peace agreement, but other Saxon leaders continued to fight. Upon his victory in 787 at Verden, Charles ordered the wholesale killing of thousands of pagan Saxon prisoners. After several more uprisings, the Saxons suffered definitive defeat in 804. This expanded the Frankish kingdom eastwards as far as the Elbe river, something the Roman Empire had only attempted once, and at which it failed in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (9 AD). In order to more effectively Christianize the Saxons, Charles founded several bishoprics, among them Bremen, Münster, Paderborn, and Osnabrück.

At the same time (773–774), Charles conquered the Lombards and thus included northern Italy in his sphere of influence. He renewed the Vatican donation and the promise to the papacy of continued Frankish protection.

In 788, Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria rebelled against Charles. Crushing the rebellion incorporated Bavaria into Charles&#x27;s kingdom. This not only added to the royal &quot;fisc&quot;, but also drastically reduced the power and influence of the Agilolfings (Tassilo&#x27;s family), another leading family among the Franks and potential rivals. Until 796, Charles continued to expand the kingdom even farther southeast, into today&#x27;s Austria and parts of Croatia.

Charles thus created a realm that reached from the Pyrenees in the southwest (actually, including an area in Northern Spain (&quot;Marca Hispanica&quot;) after 795) over almost all of today&#x27;s France (except Brittany, which the Franks never conquered) eastwards to most of today&#x27;s Germany, including northern Italy and today&#x27;s Austria. In the hierarchy of the church, bishops and abbots looked to the patronage of the king&#x27;s palace, where the sources of patronage and security lay. Charles had fully emerged as the leader of Western Christendom, and his patronage of monastic centres of learning gave rise to the &quot;Carolingian Renaissance&quot; of literate culture. Charles also created a large palace at Aachen, a series of roads, and a canal.

On Christmas Day, 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charles as &quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot; in Rome in a ceremony presented as a surprise (Charlemagne did not wish to be indebted to the bishop of Rome), a further papal move in the series of symbolic gestures that had been defining the mutual roles of papal &quot;auctoritas&quot; and imperial &quot;potestas.&quot; Though Charlemagne preferred the title &quot;Emperor, king of the Franks and Lombards&quot;, the ceremony formally acknowledged the ruler of the Franks as the Roman Emperor, triggering disputes with the Byzantine Empire, which had maintained the title since the division of the Roman Empire into East and West. The pope&#x27;s right to proclaim successors was based on the Donation of Constantine, a forged Roman imperial decree. After an initial protest at the usurpation, the Byzantine Emperor Michael I Rhangabes acknowledged in 812 Charlemagne as co-emperor, according to some. According to others, Michael I reopened negotiations with the Franks in 812 and recognized Charlemagne as &quot;basileus&quot; (emperor), but not as emperor of the Romans. The coronation gave permanent legitimacy to Carolingian primacy among the Franks. The Ottonians later resurrected this connection in 962.

Upon Charlemagne&#x27;s death on 28 January 814 in Aachen, he was buried in his own Palace Chapel at Aachen.

====Divided empire, after 840====
Charlemagne had several sons, but only one survived him. This son, Louis the Pious, followed his father as the ruler of a united empire. But sole inheritance remained a matter of chance, rather than intent. When Louis died in 840, the Carolingians adhered to the custom of partible inheritance, and after a brief civil war between the three sons, they made an agreement in 843, the Treaty of Verdun, which divided the empire in three:

# Louis&#x27;s eldest surviving son Lothair I became Emperor in name but &quot;de facto&quot; only the ruler of the Middle Frankish Kingdom, or Middle Francia, known as King of the Central or Middle Franks. His three sons in turn divided this kingdom between them into Lotharingia (centered on Lorraine), Burgundy, and Lombardy. These areas with different cultures, peoples and traditions would later vanish as separate kingdoms, which would eventually become Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Lorraine, Switzerland, Northern Italy and the various departments of France along the Rhône drainage basin and Jura massif.
# Louis&#x27;s second son, Louis the German, became King of the East Frankish Kingdom or East Francia. This area formed the kernel of the later Holy Roman Empire by way of the Kingdom of Germany enlarged with some additional territories from Lothair&#x27;s Middle Frankish Realm: much of these territories eventually evolved into modern Austria, Switzerland and Germany. For a list of successors, see the List of German monarchs.
# His third son Charles the Bald became King of the West Franks, of the West Frankish Kingdom or West Francia. This area, most of today&#x27;s southern and western France, became the foundation for the later Kingdom of France under the House of Capet. For his successors, see the List of French monarchs.

Subsequently, at the Treaty of Mersen (870) the partitions were recast, to the detriment of Lotharingia. On 12 December 884, Charles the Fat (son of Louis the German) reunited most of the Carolingian Empire, aside from Burgundy. In late 887, his nephew Arnulf of Carinthia revolted and assumed the title as King of the East Franks. Charles retired and soon died on 13 January 888.

Odo, Count of Paris was chosen to rule in the west, and was crowned the next month. At this point, West Francia was composed of Neustria in the west and in the east by Francia proper, the region between the Meuse and the Seine. The Carolingians were restored ten years later in West Francia, and ruled until 987, when the last Frankish King, Louis V, died.

West Francia was the land under the control of Charles the Bald. It is the precursor of modern France. It was divided into the following great fiefs: Aquitaine, Brittany, Burgundy, Catalonia, Flanders, Gascony, Gothia, Paris &amp; Blois, and Toulouse. After 1180 and Phillip II, the kingdom came to be known as France, because the new ruling dynasty (the Capetians) were originally Counts of Paris.

Middle Francia was the territory ruled by Lothair I, wedged between East and West Francia. The kingdom, which included the Kingdom of Italy, Burgundy, the Provence, and the west of Austrasia, was an unnatural creation of the Treaty of Verdun, with no historical or ethnic identity. The kingdom was split on the death of Lothair II in 869 into those of Lotharingia, Provence (with Burgundy divided between it and Lotharingia), and north Italy.

East Francia was the land of Louis the German. It was divided into four duchies: Swabia (Alamannia), Franconia, Saxony and Bavaria; to which after the death of Lothair II were added the eastern parts of Lotharingia. This division persisted until 1268, the end of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. Otto I was crowned on 2 February 962, marking the beginning of the Holy Roman Empire (&quot;translatio imperii&quot;). From the 10th century, East Francia became also known as &quot;regnum Teutonicum&quot; (&quot;Teutonic kingdom&quot; or &quot;Kingdom of Germany&quot;), a term that became prevalent in Salian times. The title of Holy Roman Emperor was used from that time, beginning with Conrad II.

==Life in Francia==

===Law===
The different Frankish tribes, such as the Salii, Ripuarii, and Chamavi, had different legal traditions, which were only later codified, largely under Charlemagne. The &quot;Leges Salica&quot;, &quot;Ribuaria&quot;, and &quot;Chamavorum&quot; were Carolingian creations, their basis in earlier Frankish reality being difficult for scholars to discern at the present distance. Under Charlemagne codifications were also made of the Saxon law and the Frisian law.

It was also under Frankish hegemony that the other Germanic societies east of the Rhine began to codify their tribal law, in such compilations as the &quot;Lex Alamannorum&quot; and &quot;Lex Baiuvariorum&quot; for the Alemanni and Bavarii respectively. Throughout the Frankish kingdoms there continued to be Gallo-Romans subject to Roman law and clergy subject to canon law. After the Frankish conquest of Septimania and Catalonia, those regions which had formerly been under Gothic control continued to utilise the Visigothic law code.

During the early period, Frankish law was preserved by the &quot;rachimburgs&quot;, officials trained to remember it and pass it on. The Merovingians adopted the &quot;capitulary&quot; as a tool for the promulgation and preservation of royal ordinances. Its usage was to continue under the Carolingians and even the later Spoletan emperors Guy and Lambert under a programme of &quot;renovation regni Francorum&quot; (&quot;renewal of the Frankish kingdom&quot;).

The last Merovingian capitulary was one of the most significant: the edict of Paris, issued by Chlothar II in 614 in the presence of his magnates, had been likened to a Frankish Magna Carta entrenching the rights of the nobility, but in actuality it sought to remove corruption from the judiciary and protect local and regional interests. Even after the last Merovingian capitulary, kings of the dynasty continued to independently exercise some legal powers. Childebert III even found cases against the powerful Arnulfings and became renowned among the people for his justness. But law in Francia was to experience a renaissance under the Carolingians.

Among the legal reforms adopted by Charlemagne were the codifications of traditional law mentioned above. He also sought to place checks on the power of local and regional judiciaries by the method of appointing &quot;missi dominici&quot; in pairs to oversee specific regions for short periods of time. Usually &quot;missi&quot; were selected from outside their respective regions in order to prevent conflicts of interest. A capitulary of 802 gives insight into their duties. They were to execute justice, enforce respect for the royal rights, control the administration of the counts and dukes (then still royal appointees), receive the oath of allegiance, and supervise the clergy.

===Church===
The Frankish Church grew out of the Church in Gaul in the Merovingian period, which was given a particularly Germanic development in a number of &quot;Frankish synods&quot; throughout the 6th and 7th centuries, and with the Carolingian Renaissance, the Frankish Church became a substantial influence of the medieval Western Church.

In the 7th century, the territory of the Frankish realm was (re-)Christianized with the help of Irish and Scottish missionaries. The result was the establishment of numerous monasteries, which would become the nucleus of Old High German literacy in the Carolingian Empire.
Columbanus was active in Frankish lands from 590, establishing monasteries until his death at Bobbio in 615. He arrived on the continent with twelve companions and founded Annegray, Luxeuil, and Fontaines in France and Bobbio in Italy. During the 7th century the disciples of Columbanus and other Scottish and Irish missionaries founded several monasteries or &quot;Schottenklöster&quot; in what are now France, Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland.
The Irish influence in these monasteries is reflected in the adoption of Insular style in book production, visible in 8th-century works such as the Gelasian Sacramentary. The Insular influence on the uncial script of the later Merovingian period eventually gave way to the development of the Carolingian minuscule in the 9th century.

===Society===

Immediately after the fall of Rome and through the Merovingian dynasty, trading towns were re-established in the ruins of ancient cities. These specialised in exchange of goods, craft and agriculture, and were mostly independent of aristocratic control. Carolingian Francia saw royal sponsorship for the construction of monastic cities, built to showcase a revival of the architecture of ancient Rome. Administration was conducted by bishops. The old Gallo-Roman aristocrats had survived in prestige and as an institution by taking up the episcopal offices, and they were now put in charge of fields such as justice, infrastructure, education and social services. Kings were legitimized by their links with the religious institutions. Episcopal elections became supervised by the kings, and royal confirmation helped to strengthen the bishops&#x27; authority as well.
There were improvements in agriculture, notably the adoption of a new heavy plough and the growing use of the three-field system.

===Currency===
Byzantine coinage was in use in Francia before Theudebert I began minting his own money at the start of his reign. The solidus and triens were minted in Francia between 534 and 679. The denarius (or denier) appeared later, in the name of Childeric II and various non-royals around 673–675. A Carolingian denarius replaced the Merovingian one, and the Frisian penning, in Gaul from 755 to the eleventh century.

The denarius subsequently appeared in Italy issued in the name of Carolingian monarchs after 794, later by so-called &quot;native&quot; kings in the tenth century, and later still by the German Emperors from Otto I (962). Finally, denarii were issued in Rome in the names of pope and emperor from Leo III and Charlemagne onwards to the late tenth century.

<text>The Portuguese escudo (, ) was the currency of Portugal replacing the &quot;real&quot; on 22 May 1911 and was in use until the introduction of the euro on 1 January 2002. The escudo was subdivided into 100 . The word literally means shield; like other coins with similar names, it depicts the coat of arms of the state.

Amounts in escudos were written as with the as the decimal separator (for example: means 25.00 escudos, means 100.50 escudos). Because of the conversion rate of 1,000 = , three decimal places were initially used ( = ).

==History==
The currency replaced by the escudo in 1911 was denominated in Portuguese reals (plural: ) and worth 1,000 . The was equivalent to 2.0539 grams fine gold from 1688 to 1800, and 1.62585 g from 1854 to 1891. Gold worth 1.6 (or 1.600; not to be confused with the 20th-century currency) were issued from 1722 to 1800 in denominations of , 1, 2, 4 and 8 .

The escudo (gold) was again introduced on 22 May 1911, after the 1910 Republican revolution, to replace the real at the rate of 1,000 to 1 . The term (thousand ) remained a colloquial synonym of up to the 1990s. One million was called one , or simply one . This expression passed on to the escudo, meaning one thousand escudos.

The escudo&#x27;s value was initially set at 675 = 1 kg of gold. After 1914, the value of the escudo fell, being fixed in 1928 at 108.25 to £1 sterling. This was altered to 110 to £1 stg in 1931. A new rate of 27.50 escudos to the U.S. dollar was established in 1940, changing to 25 in 1940 and 28.75 in 1949.

During World War II, escudos were heavily sought after by Nazi Germany, through Swiss banks, as foreign currency to make purchases to Portugal and other neutral nations.

Inflation throughout the 20th century made centavos essentially worthless by its end, with fractional value coins with values such as 50 centavos and eventually withdrawn from circulation in the 1990s. With the entry of Portugal in the Eurozone, the conversion rate to the euro was set at 200.482 = €1.

==Territorial usage==
The escudo was used in the Portuguese mainland, the Azores and Madeira, with no distinction of coins or banknotes. In Portugal&#x27;s African colonies, the escudo was generally used up to independence, in the form of and banknotes (rather than those of the Bank of Portugal used in Portugal proper), with Portuguese and in some cases local coins circulating alongside:
* Angolan escudo
* Cape Verdean escudo
* Mozambican escudo
* Portuguese Guinean escudo
* São Tomé and Príncipe escudo
Of the above, only Cape Verde continues to use the escudo.

In Macau, the currency during the colonial period was, as it is today, the Macanese pataca.

Timor-Leste adopted the Portuguese Timorese escudo whilst still a Portuguese colony, having earlier used the Portuguese Timor pataca.

Portuguese India adopted the Portuguese Indian escudo for a brief time between 1958 and 1961 before Goa became a part of India; prior to that, it used the Portuguese Indian rupia.

==Coins==

The mintage period for the various denominations of the gold escudo (worth 1.6 or 1.600) introduced in 1722 was different: escudo through 1821, 2 escudos through 1789, and 4 escudos through 1799. The eight-escudo coin was only struck between 1722 and 1730.

Between 1912 and 1916, silver 10, 20 and 50 centavos and 1 coins were issued. Bronze 1 and 2 centavos and cupro-nickel 4 centavo coins were issued between 1917 and 1922.

In 1920, bronze 5 centavos and cupro-nickel 10 and 20 centavo coins were introduced, followed, in 1924, by bronze 10 and 20 centavos and aluminium-bronze 50 centavos and 1 coins. Aluminium bronze was replaced with cupro-nickel in 1927.

In 1932, silver coins were introduced for , 5 and 10. The and 5 were minted until 1951, with the 10 minted until 1955 with a reduced silver content. In 1963, cupro-nickel and 5 were introduced, followed by aluminium 10, bronze 20 and 50 centavos and 1 in 1969. Cupro-nickel 10 and 25 were introduced in 1971 and 1977, respectively. In 1986, a new coinage was introduced which circulated until replacement by the euro. It consisted of nickel-brass 1, 5 and 10, cupro-nickel 20 and 50, with bimetallic 100 and 200 introduced in 1989 and 1991.

Coins in circulation at the time of the changeover to the euro were:
* 1 (0.50 cent)
* 5 (2.49 cents)
* 10 (4.99 cents)
* 20 (9.98 cents)
* 50 (24.94 cents)
* 100 (49.88 cents)
* 200 (99.76 cents)
Coins ceased to be exchangeable for euros on December 31, 2002.

Another name for the 50 centavos coin was (crown). Long after the 50 centavos coins disappeared, people still called the coins (&quot;five crowns&quot;).

Also, people still referred to escudos at the time of the changeover in multiples of the older currency (plural ). Many people called the coins (two and five-hundreds), referring to the correspondence = 2500 . (plural ) is yet another multiple of , with 1 = 100 .

==Banknotes==

The issued notes for 5, 10, and 20 centavos between 1917 and 1925 whilst, between 1913 and 1922, the introduced notes for 50 centavos, 1, , 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000. 50 centavos and 1 notes ceased production in 1920, followed by , 5 and 10 in 1925 and 1926. 5,000 notes were introduced in 1942.

The last 20 and 50 notes were printed dated 1978 and 1980, respectively, with 100 notes being replaced by coins in 1989, the same year that the 10,000 note was introduced.

Banknotes in circulation at the time of the changeover to the euro were:
* 500 (€2.49)
* 1,000 (€4.99)
* 2,000 (€9.98)
* 5,000 (€24.94)
* 10,000 (€49.88)
The last series of escudo banknotes could be returned to the central bank and converted to euros until 28 February 2022. 

Escudo banknotes celebrated notable figures from the history of Portugal. The final banknote series featured the Age of Discovery, with , , , , and Henry the Navigator. 

==Colloquial expressions==

 was the unofficial multiple of the escudo: 1 meant 1,000, 2 meant 2,000 and so on. The original expression was , which means &#x27;one count of &#x27; and referred to one million . Since the escudo was worth 1,000 (the older currency), therefore one was the same as a thousand escudos. The expression remained in usage after the advent of the euro, albeit less often, meaning €5, roughly worth 1,000.

Occasionally , literally meaning &#x27;sticks&#x27;, was also used to refer to the escudo (&quot;&quot; – &#x27;Do you have 1,000 escudos/sticks?&#x27;). During the move from escudos to euros the Portuguese had a joke saying that they had lost three currencies: the , the , and the .

<doc id="303486" wikidata="Q853085" url="?curid=303486" title="Ethnolinguistics">
<text>Ethnolinguistics (sometimes called cultural linguistics) is an area of anthropological linguistics that studies the relationship between a language or group of languages and the cultural behavior of the people who speak those languages.

It examines how different cultures conceptualize and categorize their experiences, such as spatial orientation and environmental phenomena. Ethnolinguistics incorporates methods like ethnosemantics, which analyzes how people classify and label their world, and componential analysis, which dissects semantic features of terms to understand cultural meanings. The field intersects with cultural linguistics to investigate how language encodes cultural schemas and metaphors, influencing areas such as intercultural communication and language learning.

== Examples ==
Ethnolinguists study the way perception and conceptualization influences language and show how that is linked to different cultures and societies. An example is how spatial orientation is expressed in various cultures.

For example, in many societies, words for the cardinal directions &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot; are derived from terms for sunrise/sunset. The nomenclature for cardinal directions of Inuit speakers of Greenland, however, is based on geographical landmarks such as the river system and one&#x27;s position on the coast. Similarly, the Yurok lack the idea of cardinal directions; they orient themselves with respect to their principal geographic feature, the Klamath River.

== Cultural linguistics ==
Cultural Linguistics is a related branch of linguistics that explores the relationship between language and cultural conceptualisations. Cultural Linguistics draws on and expands the theoretical and analytical advancements in cognitive science (including complexity science and distributed cognition) and anthropology. Cultural linguistics examines how various features of human languages encode cultural conceptualisations, including cultural schemas, cultural categories, and cultural metaphors. In , language is viewed as deeply entrenched in the group-level, cultural cognition of communities of speakers. Thus far, the approach of Cultural Linguistics has been adopted in several areas of applied linguistic research, including intercultural communication, second language learning, Teaching English as an International Language, and World Englishes.

== Ethnosemantics ==
Ethnosemantics, also called ethnoscience and cognitive anthropology, is a method of ethnographic research and ethnolinguistics that focuses on semantics by examining how people categorize words in their language. Ethnosemantics studies the way people label and classify the cultural, social, and environmental phenomena in their world and analyze the semantic categories these classifications create in order to understand the cultural meanings behind the way people describe things in their world.

Ethnosemantics as a method relies on Franz Boas&#x27; theory of cultural relativity, as well as the theory of linguistic relativity. The use of cultural relativity in ethnosemantic analysis serves to focus analyses on individual cultures and their own language terms, rather than using ethnosemantics to create overarching theories of culture and how language affects culture.

=== Methods and examples ===
In order to perform ethnosemantic analysis, all of the words in a language that are used for a particular subject are gathered by the researcher and are used to create a model of how those words relate to one another. Anthropologists who utilize ethnosemantics to create these models believe that they are a representation of how speakers of a particular language think about the topic being described.

For example, in her book &quot;The Anthropology of Language: An Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology&quot;, Harriet Ottenheimer uses the concept of plants and how dandelions are categorized to explain how ethnosemantics can be used to examine the differences in how cultures think about certain topics. In her example, Ottenheimer describes how the topic &quot;plants&quot; can be divided into the two categories &quot;lettuce&quot; and &quot;weeds&quot;. Ethnosemantics can help anthropologists to discover whether a particular culture categorizes &quot;dandelions&quot; as a &quot;lettuce&quot; or a &quot;weed&quot;, and using this information can discover something about how that culture thinks about plants.

In one section of Oscar Lewis&#x27; &quot;La Vida&quot;, he includes the transcript of an interview with a Puerto Rican woman in which she discusses a prostitute&#x27;s social world. Using ethnosemantics, the speaker&#x27;s statements about the people in that social circle and their behavior can be analyzed in order to understand how she perceives and conceptualizes her social world. The first step in this analysis is to identify and map out all of the social categories or social identities the speaker identified. Once the social categories have been mapped, the next steps are to attempt to define the precise meaning of each category, examine how the speaker describes the relationship of categories, and analyze how she evaluates the characteristics of the people who are grouped in those social categories.

The speaker in this example identified three basic social categories (the rich, the law, and the poor) and characterized those people in the higher categories of &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;law&quot; as bad people. The poor are further divided into those with disreputable positions and those with reputable positions. The speaker characterizes the disreputable poor generally as dishonest and corrupt, but presents herself as one of the few exceptions. This analysis of the speaker&#x27;s description of her social circle thus allows for an understanding of how she perceives the world around her and the people in it.

==== Componential analysis ====
The method of componential analysis in ethnosemantic analysis is used to describe the criteria people use to classify concepts by analyzing their semantic features. For example, the word &quot;man&quot; can be analyzed into the semantic features &quot;male,&quot; &quot;mature,&quot; and &quot;human&quot;; &quot;woman&quot; can be analyzed into &quot;female,&quot; &quot;mature,&quot; and &quot;human&quot;; &quot;girl&quot; can be analyzed into &quot;female,&quot; &quot;immature,&quot; and &quot;human&quot;; and &quot;bull&quot; can be analyzed into &quot;male,&quot; &quot;mature,&quot; and &quot;bovine.&quot; By using this method, the features of words in a category can be examined to form hypotheses about the significant meaning and identifying features of words in that category.

<doc id="303489" wikidata="Q242620" url="?curid=303489" title="Foxy Brown (rapper)">
<text>Inga DeCarlo Fung Marchand (born September 6, 1978), better known by her stage name Foxy Brown, is an American rapper. Upon being signed to Def Jam Recordings in 1996, she released her debut studio album, &quot;Ill Na Na&quot;, in November of that year to critical and commercial success. It peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), sold over seven million units worldwide, and was supported by the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top ten single &quot;I&#x27;ll Be&quot; (featuring Jay-Z).

The following year, she formed the New York City-based hip hop supergroup The Firm with Nas, AZ and Cormega (who was replaced by Nature). The Firm&#x27;s sole album (1997) was released by Dr. Dre&#x27;s Aftermath Entertainment and peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 despite unfavorable critical reception. Her second album, &quot;Chyna Doll&quot; (1998) saw continued commercial success and also debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making her the second female rapper to do so after Lauryn Hill in 1998. Her third album, &quot;Broken Silence&quot; (2001) peaked at number five on the chart and earned her first Grammy Award nomination for its song &quot;Na Na Be Like&quot;. She then parted ways with Def Jam in 2003, cancelling the release of her fourth album &quot;Ill Na Na 2: The Fever&quot;; however, frequent collaborator and the label&#x27;s then-president, Jay-Z signed her to the label once more to record for another ultimately-shelved album, &quot;Black Roses&quot;.

Following years of legal issues and a lack of output, Marchand released the mixtape &quot;Brooklyn Don Diva&quot; in 2008. Her visual album, &quot;King Soon Come&quot; was slated for release in 2019, but has since been delayed indefinitely.

== Early life ==
Marchand is a Trinidadian-American of Dougla (mixed Afro-Trinidadian and Indo-Trinidadian) and Chinese-Trinidadian descent. She was born in Brooklyn, and grew up in its neighborhood of Park Slope alongside her two older brothers. Her parents divorced when she was four, and her family moved in with her maternal grandfather. She later attended Brooklyn College Academy.

== Music career ==
=== 1994–1996: Early career ===
While still a teenager, Brown won a talent contest in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Members of the production team Trackmasters who were working on LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; album were in attendance that night and were impressed enough to invite Brown to rap on &quot;I Shot Ya.&quot; She followed this debut with appearances on several RIAA platinum and gold singles from other artists, including remixes of songs &quot;You&#x27;re Makin&#x27; Me High&quot; by Toni Braxton. Brown was featured on the soundtrack to the 1996 film &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; on the songs &quot;Touch Me, Tease Me&quot; by Case and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Nigga&quot; by Jay-Z. She became an instant sensation due to being very talented and rapping provocatively at such a young age. The immediate success led to a label bidding war at the beginning of 1996, and in March, Def Jam Records won and added the then 17-year-old rapper to its roster.

=== 1996–1997: &quot;Ill Na Na&quot; and The Firm ===
In 1996, Brown released her debut album &quot;Ill Na Na&quot; to strong sales. The album sold over 128,000 copies in the first week, and debuted at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts. The album was heavily produced by Trackmasters, and featured guest appearances from Jay-Z, Blackstreet, Method Man, and Kid Capri. The album was platinum and launched two hit singles: &quot;Get Me Home&quot; (featuring Blackstreet) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be&quot; (featuring Jay-Z).

Following the release of &quot;Ill Na Na&quot;, Brown joined fellow New York-based hip hop artists Nas, AZ, and Cormega (later replaced by Nature) to form the supergroup known as The Firm. The album was released via Aftermath Records and was produced and recorded by the collective team of Dr. Dre, the Trackmasters, and Steve &quot;Commissioner&quot; Stoute, then of Violator Entertainment. An early form of The Firm appeared on &quot;Affirmative Action&quot; from Nas&#x27; second album &quot;It Was Written&quot;. A remix of the song and several group freestyles were on the album &quot;Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album&quot;. The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart at No. 1.

In March 1997, she joined the spring break festivities hosted by MTV in Panama City, Florida, with performers including rapper Snoop Dogg, pop group The Spice Girls, and rock band Stone Temple Pilots. Later, she joined the Smokin&#x27; Grooves tour hosted by the House of Blues with the headlining rap group Cypress Hill, along with other performers like Erykah Badu, The Roots, OutKast, and The Pharcyde, the tour set to begin in Boston, Massachusetts in the summer of 1997. However, after missing several dates in the tour, she left it.

=== 1998–1999: &quot;Chyna Doll&quot; ===
&quot;Chyna Doll&quot; was released in January 1999 and debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Album chart, selling 173,000 copies in its opening week, making her the second female rapper to accomplish this feat after Lauryn Hill. However, its sales quickly declined in later weeks. &quot;Chyna Doll&quot; has been certified platinum after surpassing one million copies sold in shipments.

=== 2000–2003: &quot;Broken Silence&quot; and &quot;Ill Na Na 2: The Fever&quot; ===
In 2001, Brown released &quot;Broken Silence&quot;. The first single from the album was &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;, which featured her then-boyfriend, Jamaican dancehall artist Spragga Benz. The track &quot;Na Na Be Like&quot; was produced by Kenya Fame Flames Miller and Nokio from Dru Hill. The song &quot;Candy&quot;, which featured guest vocals from Kelis, was never officially released as a single, but was hugely successful on the radio; it managed to chart at 48 on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Track Chart and number 10 on the Rap charts&quot;. Na Na Be Like&quot; was also on the &quot;Blue Streak Soundtrack&quot;.

The album debuted on the Billboard Charts at No. 5, selling 130,000 units its first week. Like previous albums, &quot;Broken Silence&quot; also sold over 500,000 records and was certified gold by the RIAA.

In the same year, Brown recorded a song for the comedy film &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;, &quot;Blow My Whistle&quot;, which is a collaboration with Japanese-American singer-songwriter Hikaru Utada, and was written by Utada with Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo. The song is included on Def Jam&#x27;s &quot;Rush Hour 2 Soundtrack&quot;, which peaked the 11th spot on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and also the first on the Top Soundtracks. &quot;Blow My Whistle&quot; was produced by The Neptunes.

In 2002, Brown returned to the music scene with her single &quot;Stylin&#x27;&quot;, whose remix featured rappers Birdman, her brother Gavin, Loon, and N.O.R.E. It was to be the first single from her upcoming album &quot;Ill Na Na 2: The Fever&quot;. The next year, she was featured on DJ Kayslay&#x27;s single &quot;Too Much for Me&quot; from his &quot;Street Sweeper&#x27;s Volume One Mixtape&quot;. She also appeared on Luther Vandross&#x27; final studio album &quot;Dance with My Father&quot;. That April, Brown appeared on popular New York radio DJ Wendy Williams&#x27; radio show, and revealed the details of her relationships with Lyor Cohen, president of Def Jam Recordings at the time, and Sean &quot;P. Diddy&quot; Combs. Brown accused both of illegally trading her recording masters. She also announced that Cohen had cancelled promotion for her fourth album &quot;Ill Na Na 2: The Fever&quot; over personal disagreements. Therefore, &quot;Stylin&#x27;&quot; was released on the compilation album &quot;The Source Presents: Hip Hop Hits Vol. 6&quot;.

=== 2004–2008: &quot;Black Roses&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Don Diva&quot; ===
Upon leaving Def Jam Recordings after her disappointment in the cancelled promotion of her studio album &quot;Ill Na Na 2: The Fever&quot;, Brown began recording in late 2004. Months later, she reunited with Jay-Z, performing dates on the Best of Both Worlds Tour. After signing back to Def Jam under his regime, Brown and Jay-Z began work on &quot;Black Roses&quot; with production by The Neptunes, Kanye West, Timbaland, Trackmasters, and Dave Kelly. Brown confirmed guest appearances by Barrington Levy, Dido, Luther Vandross, Mos Def, Baby Cham, Spragga Benz, Shyne, Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, KRS-One, Roxanne Shante, and Jay-Z, although it was uncertain whether all would make the final cut for the album.

In November 2004, Brown announced that the title for her upcoming album would be &quot;Black Roses&quot;, explaining &quot;My best friend Barrington Levy has a song called &quot;Black Roses.&quot; He&#x27;s been traveling all over the world and never seen a black rose in no other garden. When he found his black rose, he knew that shit was special. Y&#x27;all niggas can have all the female rappers in the world, but there&#x27;s only one black rose. I feel that&#x27;s me.&quot; Brown also announced that she would be the first artist signed to Jay-Z&#x27;s upcoming imprint record label S. Carter Records. Rather than launching the imprint, though, Jay-Z became the new president of Def Jam Records, where he signed Brown as one of the first artists on his new roster. In December 2005, Brown announced she had experienced severe and sudden hearing loss in both ears and she had not heard another person&#x27;s voice in six months. Brown put &quot;Black Roses&quot; aside during this time. In June 2006, Brown said her hearing had been restored through surgery and she was planning to resume recording. Her label did not set a release date, but hoped the album would be out by the end of 2006. They were unsure if the title &quot;Black Roses&quot; would be kept. In November 2006, there was speculation that Jay-Z was disappointed in Foxy Brown&#x27;s &quot;lack of productivity on the album&quot; and was planning to drop her from the Def Jam label. The planned December 2006 release of &quot;Black Roses&quot; was cancelled.

On May 22, 2007, Black Hand Entertainment announced a management deal with Brown, with Chaz Williams as her manager. No release date was set for &quot;Black Roses&quot;, but Brown said the album was nearly complete. Two days later, a release date of September 6 was announced. On August 16, Black Hand Entertainment announced that Brown would leave Def Jam to launch an independent record label, Black Rose Entertainment, distributed by Koch Records. The street album &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Don Diva&quot;, was scheduled with a release date of December 4, but was delayed until the following year.

&quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Don Diva&quot; was ultimately released as a street album on May 13, 2008, after many delays triggered by her prison sentence. It contains two previously unreleased songs from her shelved album &quot;Ill Na Na 2: The Fever.&quot; The album peaked at No. 83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, No. 8 on the Independent Albums chart, and No. 5 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

=== 2009–2018: Guest appearances ===
In January 2011, Brown released the diss track &quot;Massacre&quot;, a response to Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s &quot;Black Friday&quot;. On August 14, 2012, Foxy appeared as a special featured guest on Nicki Minaj&#x27;s Pink Friday Tour in New York City. Rapper AZ later hinted in an interview that Brown was working on new material with Minaj. In August 2018, Brown made her first official guest appearance since 2009 on &quot;Coco Chanel&quot; from Nicki Minaj&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Queen&quot;.

=== 2019–present: Upcoming fourth studio album ===
According to media sources, Brown is back to work on her upcoming fourth studio album. In 2019, Brown remixed Casanova&#x27;s &quot;So Brooklyn&quot;.

In August 2020, Brown reunited with her group The Firm for the song &quot;Full Circle&quot; from Nas&#x27; album &quot;King&#x27;s Disease&quot;.

== Other ventures ==
In 1998, Brown was featured in commercials for Mistic&#x27;s &quot;Living Delicious&quot; sparkling water drink campaign.

In 1999, Brown was named a spokeswoman for Calvin Klein and modeled in their jeans campaign. That year, she was also a muse to John Galliano for Dior.

In 2004, Brown launched &quot;Champagne and Ice&quot;, her luxury fur collection distributed by Alexis &amp; Gianni.

== Artistry ==
=== Musical style ===
Brown&#x27;s lyrics have been described to be &quot;raunchy&quot; and &quot;over-the-top&quot; with &quot;skimpy clothes to match.&quot; Her music is often centred around themes such as &quot;fashion, sex, and the mafia&quot; and is described as &quot;intriguingly seductive&quot; and having &quot;a contemporary edge with a sleek and sexy soundscape.&quot; Her work for her debut album was described as &quot;a heroine straight from the pages of a James Bond novel,&quot; selling over a million copies with the support of major male artists such as Nas and AZ. Brown&#x27;s voice has been described as a &quot;husky flow&quot; with &quot;dancehall swagger&quot;.

Although her work was compared to rapper Lil&#x27; Kim, David Opie of &quot;Highsnobiety&quot; wrote:
Just because they were both the &#x27;First Ladies&#x27; of their respective crews, doesn&#x27;t mean that Foxy or Kim were identical by any means, and it was hugely misogynistic to suggest otherwise...In an industry that still actively mocks vulnerability and weakness, hip hop needs more rappers who are willing to open up in this way, and the fact that Foxy did so such a long time ago speaks volumes about her artistry.

== Legacy ==
Brown&#x27;s impact on the rap world has often been overlooked due to her legal run-ins, but it has been noted that &quot;she&#x27;s bright, talented, sexy and, most important, she&#x27;s not afraid to take risks creatively&quot; and that her &quot;impact still stands.&quot; Her albums have been cited to harness &quot;a winning formula of looping R&amp;B songs into hip-hop hits, resulting in the genre-shifting record,&quot; Ill Na Na. The release of her album marked a monumental moment in hip-hop history, but was downplayed due to comparisons between her and rapper, Lil&#x27; Kim and although Foxy may not have achieved the &quot;iconic status&quot; Kim had reached, &quot;her debut album was an essential part of a turning point in mainstream rap music.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; author, Kathy Iandoli stated,

In seeing Foxy...release [&quot;Ill Na Na&quot;] it was a reassurance that skills paid off; it didn&#x27;t really matter who was helping with the rhymes. It was the delivery and the content that was being said, and whose mouth it was coming out of. It was just a reassurance to me as a hip-hop head that this space might be opening up for women in a way that has never been done before. There was something about what [she] said and how [she was] saying it, that was hinting that a huge change was about to come.

&quot;Elle&quot; writer Janelle Harris wrote that Brown celebrated &quot;the beauty of her mahogany skin as the self-professed &#x27;dark-skinned Christian Dior poster girl,&#x27; boasted about being &#x27;dripped in Gabbana...starring in billboards as big as the pride of the Black girls who saw themselves in her likeness.&quot;

Described as one of the &quot;illest to ever do it – regardless of gender,&quot; Scott Glaysher of &quot;HipHopDX&quot; noted that &quot;If those aforementioned male rappers epitomize the menacing New York City mobster of the late 90s then Foxy represents the mob wife that is even more sinister with weaponized sexuality.&quot; He stated that &quot;the sheer confidence and astute rhyming Foxy brought to &quot;Ill Na Na&quot;, makes it one of the 90s most memorable albums and a catalyst for the fierce feminine rap wave that followed. In 2020, &quot;Spin&quot; ranked her at 20, as one of the 30 Best Female Rappers Ever.

Brown&#x27;s sophomore studio album &quot;Chyna Doll&quot; debuted at number one in 1999, making it only the second female rap album to debut at the top spot after &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; in 1998 by Lauryn Hill and eventually joined by &quot;Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders&#x27; First Lady&quot; in 1999 by Eve, &quot;Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded&quot; in 2012 by Nicki Minaj and &quot;Invasion of Privacy&quot; in 2018 by Cardi B. Her work has been paid homage to by numerous artists including, Nicki Minaj, Kash Doll, Bia, Ivorian Doll, Megan Thee Stallion, JT of City Girls, Dreezy, and Maliibu Miitch. Minaj has even gone so far to say that without Foxy she &quot;may have never even started rapping&quot; and that she is &quot;the most influential female rapper.&quot;

== Feud with Lil&#x27; Kim ==
Comparisons between Brown and Lil Kim led to fierce competition. The two have not resolved the issue, with Foxy siding and collaborating with rapper Nicki Minaj in her feud with Kim in recent years. Following her release from prison, Kim does not acknowledge Brown. Brown, on the other hand, has consistently targeted Kim in her music and concerts since Kim&#x27;s release.

== Legal issues ==

Brown has a substantial history of assault and menacing. On September 7, 2007, New York City Criminal Court Judge Melissa Jackson sentenced Brown to one year in jail for violating her probation that stemmed from a fight in 2004 with two manicurists in a New York City nail salon. On September 12, representatives of the rapper disputed claims by her lawyer that she was pregnant. On October 23, 2007, Brown was given 76 days in solitary confinement due to a physical altercation that took place on October 3 with another prisoner. According to the prison authorities, Brown, the next day after the incident, was also verbally abusive toward correction officers and refused to take a random drug test. Prison authorities reported on November 27 that she was released &quot;from solitary confinement...for good behavior&quot;, and Brown was finally released from prison on April 18, 2008.

On July 22, 2010, Brown was arrested and charged with one count of criminal contempt, which is a class E felony (the least severe), for violating an order of protection. The charge stems from an incident during the evening of July 21, 2010, in which it was claimed that Brown swore at, then mooned her neighbor Arlene Raymond, at whom she had thrown her BlackBerry, in 2007. Following the BlackBerry incident, Raymond sought and received a restraining order against Brown. Following her arrest, Brown appeared in court where she pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot; to the charge and was released on a $5,000 bail. If convicted, she faced up to seven years&#x27; imprisonment. On July 12, 2011, the charges were dropped.

== Personal life ==
From 1997 to 1999, she was engaged to fellow rapper Kurupt. In 2000, she announced that she was suffering from depression. She subsequently entered drug rehabilitation at Cornell University Medical College to receive treatment for opioid addiction, stating that she could no longer record or perform without resorting to morphine. Around 2001, she was engaged to Spragga Benz. Her uncle, Federico de la Asuncion, was one of 265 fatalities in the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 on November 12, 2001.

Brown suffered hearing loss from May 2005 to June 2006. She opted for a hearing aid, and while recording music, had someone tap beats on her shoulder.

After her release from prison, Brown attended Catholic Mass.

In 2013, reports surfaced online claiming Brown had confessed to having a sexual relationship with Jay-Z and made disparaging remarks about him. In an interview with Combat Jack, Brown denied these reports, stating: &quot;He never said not one bad thing about me. So when that false story came out about me talking about him, it&#x27;s like, why would I say those things about him?&quot;

On January 13, 2017, she gave birth to her first child, a girl.

<text>Delmar Drew Arnaud (born May 25, 1973), known professionally as Daz Dillinger or simply Daz (formerly Dat Nigga Daz), is an American rapper and record producer. As a member of Death Row Records in the early 1990s, he is credited with the label in pioneering West Coast hip hop and gangsta rap for mainstream audiences. Alongside Kurupt, he formed the hip hop duo tha Dogg Pound in 1992, with whom he has released eight albums.

Arnaud learned production from Dr. Dre; his first major production credit was on Dre&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;The Chronic&quot; (1992). He further produced for his cousin, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s debut album &quot;Doggystyle&quot; (1993), as well as Tupac Shakur&#x27;s &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; (1996). His debut studio album, &quot;Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back&quot; (1998) peaked within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and served as his only project with Death Row before founding his own label, Gangsta Advisory Records in 2000 and co-founding D.P.G. Recordz with Soopafly that same year.

==Early life==
Daz Dillinger was born and raised in Long Beach, California. His family includes cousins Snoop Dogg, Brandy, Ray J, and Mercedes Moné.

==Career==
===Start at Death Row (1992–1995)===
Daz began his music career at the age of 19, when he signed to Death Row Records and learned music production from Dr. Dre. After joining the Death Row label, Daz was featured on Dr. Dre&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;The Chronic&quot;, in 1992; he contributed both rapping and production to the album. During this period, Daz also befriended the rapper Kurupt, and the two formed a duo called Tha Dogg Pound.

The Dogg Pound appeared on Snoop Dogg&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, which was released as Death Row&#x27;s second album on November 23, 1993. Formally, Daz received co-production credits on two of &quot;Doggystyle&quot;″s tracks, &quot;Serial Killa&quot; and &quot;For All My Niggaz &amp; Bitches&quot;; however, Daz maintains that he provided uncredited production for large portions of the album, and Death Row CEO Suge Knight has remarked that &quot;Daz did pretty much the whole album [&quot;Doggystyle&quot;]&quot;. Daz also produced tracks for the soundtracks to &quot;Above the Rim&quot; and &quot;Murder Was the Case&quot;.

In their single &quot;What Would You Do?&quot;, Tha Dogg Pound sided with Dr. Dre against his former N.W.A groupmate Eazy-E and his label Ruthless Records. Later, as the ongoing East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry began to escalate, Tha Dogg Pound recorded the single &quot;New York, New York&quot;, which slighted the city. Tha Dogg Pound followed these tracks with their debut album, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Dogg Food&quot;, which was certified platinum by the RIAA.

===Growth at Death Row Records (1996–1998)===
As the East–West rap rivalry intensified, Death Row&#x27;s lead producer Dr. Dre increasingly distanced himself from the studio, disliking the studio&#x27;s atmosphere and Suge Knight&#x27;s leadership. In 1996, Tupac Shakur released his first Death Row album, &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;; this album featured only three tracks produced by Dr. Dre, while Daz produced five tracks for the album, including the singles &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot; and &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Mad at Cha&quot;. The commercial success of &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; raised Daz&#x27;s stature as a producer, and he provided production to numerous Death Row albums – including Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot;, Nate Dogg&#x27;s &quot;G-Funk Classics, Vol. 1 &amp; 2&quot;, and the Lady of Rage&#x27;s &quot;Necessary Roughness&quot; – in 1996 and 1997. Daz also contributed to the soundtrack of the 1997 film &quot;Gridlock&#x27;d&quot;.

Dr. Dre left Death Row in March 1996 to found the label Aftermath Entertainment. After Tupac was murdered in 1996, followed by Suge Knight being sentenced to prison for parole violations in 1997, numerous other artists (including Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, and Nate Dogg) departed from Death Row as well; this left Daz as the only platinum-selling artist remaining on the Death Row roster. Daz released his debut solo album, &quot;Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back&quot;, through Death Row Records in March 1998; however, he too left the label later that year.

===D.P.G. Recordz and indie releases (post-1999)===
After leaving Death Row Records, Daz produced for artists like Kurupt, Soopafly, And B-Legit. He also established his own label, D.P.G. Recordz, on which he released his second solo album, 2000&#x27;s &quot;R.A.W&quot;. In the following years, Daz has continued to focus on his own indie releases and sales; as of 2023, he has released a total of eighteen solo albums.

Daz and Kurupt reunited to release a second collaborative album, &quot;Dillinger &amp; Young Gotti&quot;, in 2001; because Death Row still owned the name &quot;Tha Dogg Pound&quot;, they released &quot;Dillinger &amp; Young Gotti&quot; under the name DPG. Despite this collaboration, relations deteriorated between the two rappers after Kurupt signed to Death Row Records once more, and Daz repeatedly insulted Kurupt in songs and interviews. Daz and Kurupt ultimately reconciled at a West Coast unity event that Snoop Dogg hosted in 2005. After gaining rights to the moniker &quot;Tha Dogg Pound&quot;, Kurupt left Death Row again, and Daz closed his brief time at Jermaine Dupri&#x27;s So So Def Recordings. Since then, Tha Dogg Pound has released several more albums, including a prolific streak of five albums between 2005 and 2010.

In 2020 Daz united with Queens MC Capone (one half of Capone-N-Noreaga) for a collaborative album titled &quot;Guidelines&quot;.

<text>A military band is a group of personnel that performs musical duties for military functions, usually for the armed forces. A typical military band consists mostly of wind and percussion instruments. The conductor of a band commonly bears the title of bandmaster or music director. Ottoman military bands are thought to be the oldest variety of military marching bands in the world, dating from the 13th century.

The military band is capable of playing ceremonial and marching music, including the national anthems and patriotic songs of theirs and other nations, both while stationary and as a marching band. Military bands also play a part in military funeral ceremonies.

There are two types of historical traditions in military bands. The first is military field music. This type of music includes bugles (or other natural instruments such as natural trumpets or natural horns), bagpipes or fifes, and almost always drums. This type of music was used to control troops on the battlefield as well as for entertainment. Following the development of instruments such as the keyed trumpet or the saxhorn family of brass instruments, a second tradition of the brass and woodwind military band was formed. A third type, that of a mounted band, serves cavalry and sometimes artillery formations.

Some police forces have their own police bands that provide a similar function to that of a military band.

== History ==

Military band instruments such as fife, drum, and bugle were historically used to communicate orders to soldiers in battle.
11th century book &quot;Diwan Lughat al-Turk&quot; mentions a prototype of the Mehtaran, as a &quot;nevbet&quot;, Turkish military band tradition. Bands were formed by soldiers. 17th century traveler Evliya Çelebi noted that the Ottoman Empire had 40 guilds of musicians in the 1670s Istanbul. Ottoman military bands influenced European equivalents. Each regiment in the British Army maintained its own military band. Until 1749 bandsmen were civilians hired at the expense of the colonel commanding a regiment. Subsequently, they became regular enlisted men who accompanied the unit on active service to provide morale enhancing music on the battlefield or, from the late nineteenth century on, to act as stretcher bearers. Instruments during the 18th century included fifes, drums, the oboe (hautbois), French horn, clarinet and bassoon. Drummers summoned men from their farms and ranches to muster for duty. In the chaotic environment of the battlefield, musical instruments were the only means of commanding the men to advance, stand or retire. In the mid 19th century each smaller unit had their own fifer and drummer, who sounded the daily routine. When units massed for battle a band of musicians was formed for the whole.

== Functions and duties ==

Military bands can vary in function and duties based on their specific mission. Bands may perform for a variety of reasons such as special events, military parades, military review, military tattoos, public relations, and troop entertainment. It may also play a role in boosting the &quot;esprit de corps&quot; or morale of the entire military, a particular service branch or a specific unit (usually regiment/brigade-sized at least).

Military bands play ceremonial and marching music, including the national anthems and patriotic songs. A concert band&#x27;s repertoire includes original wind compositions, arrangements of orchestral compositions, light music, popular tunes and concert marches found in standard repertoire. Modern-day military musicians often perform a variety of other styles of music in different ensembles, from chamber music to rock and roll.

==Military bands in Africa==
=== Algeria ===
Military bands take place in Algeria. The Algerian People&#x27;s National Army maintains military bands in the country.

=== Angola ===
The Angolan Armed Forces maintains Portuguese-style military bands, primarily in the Army, Navy and Air Force and then in individual units of the FAA. The primary band is the 100-member Music Band of the Presidential Security Household, which is the official security service of the President of Angola. The music band of the Army Command was created on 16 June 1994. 4 years later, on 15 August 1998, the National Air Force created a music band within the artistic brigade. Outside the navy&#x27;s marching band, the navy also has a small musical group known as &quot;Banda 10 de Julho&quot; (10 July Band), based at the Luanda Naval Base. All bands follow both the Portuguese and British precedent with the percussion at the front ranks of the band.

=== Cameroon ===

Cameroonian military bands solely follow the French precedent for military music and military bands. The Yaoundé based &quot;Music Band Company of the Cameroonian Armed Forces&quot; under the baton of Captain Florent Essimbi is the main military band of the country. The band was founded in 1959, a year before Cameroon gained its independence, as purely a brass band company. Because of its increase in musicians it was upgraded to a musical section 10 years later. It has retained its current name since 2004. The band currently and has previously relied on its cooperation with the French Military and specifically its connections to musicians from the Conservatoire national supérieur de musique et de danse de Lyon. Other band include the &quot;Musique du Carroussel spécial de l&#x27;armée&quot;, the &quot;Musique de la Garde Présidentielle&quot; and the &quot;Musique de la gendarmerie&quot;.

=== Ethiopia ===
Although Ethiopia has a very long militarily history dating back to the Kingdom of Axum its bands were firstly of the French manner of a fanfare band. The first regular band was established by the early 20th century before the Italian invasion of the 1930s, based on the British and German tradition.

The first permanent military band in the country took the form of the Imperial Bodyguard Band (&quot;Kibur Zebegna&quot;) of the Ethiopian Empire, being formed in 1929 under Swiss conductor Andre Nicod. It originally consisted of just over a dozen uniformed musicians, majority coming from Welega province. Members of this band got their training originally from the Arba Lijoch fanfare band led by their Armenian bandleader Kevork Nalbandian. Notable members of the Imperial Bodyguard Band included Tilahun Gessesse and Mahmoud Ahmed, Bizunesh Bekele, Colonel Sahle Degago and many more. It was the first African nation to implement western style military music conventions. It came under the direct command of the Derg in the 70s and went into its current form in 1991.

Current marching bands in Ethiopia

Today the Ethiopian National Defence Force Band (ENDFB) (Amharic: የኢትዮጵያ ብሔራዊ መከላከያ ባንድ) is the central military band of the Ethiopian National Defense Force. With its headquarter in the Ethiopian capital city of Addis Ababa, it performs on ceremonial and state functions. Given the British influence, its current formation on parade is modeled on those of the British Army line infantry bands. It is composed of a marching band, a big band, a Corps of Drums, and a youth cadets section modeled on similar bands in the Commonwealth of Nations. It has received assistance from the British Royal Corps of Army Music, most recently between 2007 and 2012. The band itself has trained other marching bands in the country like the Tigray and Somalian marching bands.

In Addition to the EDFMB, there are some notable marching bands in Ethiopia, including:

* Amhara Regional State Police Marching Band
* Benishangul Gumuz Regional State Police Marching Band
* Tigray Regional State Police Marching Band
* Somali Regional State Police Marching Band
* Dere Dawa Youths Marching Band
=== Namibia ===
The Namibian Defence Force maintains many military bands throughout its service branches and even its own central band for the entire NDF. These bands followed the South African/British precedent due to the country&#x27;s administration as South West Africa from 1915 to 1990. In recent years, it has gained a more German and Prussian tradition when marching and performing based on the country&#x27;s 19th century colonial era as German South West Africa. Since the early 2000s, regular music training has been provided by the South African military. The Namibian Defence Force Brass Band is currently the country&#x27;s most senior military band, having an area of responsibility out of its base in Windhoek. The Namibian Navy and the Namibian Marine Corps also maintain their own ceremonial brass bands.

=== Nigeria ===

Nigerian military bands follow the British Household Division format and are heavily influenced and aided by British military bands. Military bands in Nigeria share similar practices with the Nigerian Police Band, which was considered to be the pioneer military band formation in the country, being established in 1892. Being mostly composed of buglers at the time of its founding, the band was originally composed of British servicemen, rather than native Nigerians. Over the years, however, the Nigerian Armed Forces have taken enormous steps to indigenize military bands due to the overuse of American and British military music and the exposure of the military to Nigerian art. Some of these steps include the establishment of the Nigerian Army School of Music (NASM) and the creation of new military music. Nigerian military bands are today under the command of the Headquarters of the Nigerian Armed Forces in Abuja.

The Nigerian Army Band Corps (NABC), which provides official military records for the armed forces, is the most senior band in the Nigerian Army and in the armed forces. Other bands maintained by the Nigerian Armed Forces outside the NABC include the Nigerian Air Force Band, the Nigerian Navy Band, and the Nigerian Defence Academy Band. The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps Band also serves as a paramilitary band. The Nigerian Navy Band was established in 1963 months prior to the country becoming a republic. The Air Force Band was the most recent military band established, being founded in 1970. Enlisted musicians only joined a year later, and did not have its first director of music until 1975. On 9 April 2019, the NAF graduated its first set of pipers from an air base in Abuja who would later comprise the newly formed NAF Pipe Band. A pipe section can also be found in the Guards Brigade. Steel pans were introduced in the late 70s, with the NABC beginning the process of manufacturing steelpans and was the only steel band in the country until 2001. The Army School of Music in Ojo and the Navy School of Music in the Ota both provide musical instruction as it pertains to incoming musicians. In September 2019, Ibok Ekwe Ibas, the Chief of the Nigerian Naval Staff, announced plans for the Navy Directorate of Music to partner its foreign counterparts as well as the Music Society of Nigeria to improve its performances.

=== Senegal ===

Like Cameroon and Niger, the Armed Forces of Senegal follows the French military band format in all of its musical formations. The Mounted Squadron of the Red Guard of Senegal, being the premier ceremonial unit of its 1st Infantry Regiment, maintains a 35-member mounted fanfare band similar to that of the French Republican Guard Cavalry. The mounted band leads the reset of the squadron in military parades and ceremonial processions in the capital of Dakar. Band musicians ride on white horses whose tails dyed red to match the official colors of the Red Guard.

The Armed Forces of Senegal is represented by a joint services band which, unlike the Red Guard mounted band, has a repertoire of a mix between Senegalese folk and classical music. This band was created in 1961 at the time of the founding of the armed forces and the independence of the country. The main music of the Senegalese Armed Forces was at the time formed by a majority of newly recruited young people with no musical knowledge. It was then necessary to count on the Captain Jean Avignon who directed, for 12 years, the Paris-based Musique des Troupes de Marine. Its official duties were prescribed in November 1981. The Senegalese Gendarmerie also maintains its own fanfare band.

=== Sierra Leone ===
During colonial rule in Sierra Leone, the army music unit was the Band of the 1st Battalion, Royal Sierra Leone Regiment. Mustapha Sahr &quot;Big&quot; Fayia formed an army dance band in 1965 from soldiers in the newly formed armed forces. It earned money by playing concerts at home and abroad, winning in 1978 the top band prize with their performance at the World Festival of Youth in Havana. The Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces today maintains a marching band organized in the British format.

=== South Africa ===

There are currently 9 main military bands currently under the auspices of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) that are speed across the four different branches of the SANDF (Army, Navy, Air Force, Health Service). Outside of marching bands, which follow the British influence, the SANDF also follows the British/Commonwealth precedent for utilizing pipe bands, with some of the most notable pipe and drums coming from the Transvaal Scottish Regiment. Since 1969, the South African Army is currently represented in musical support by the Corps of Bandsmen, a military band service that presides over the country&#x27;s five military bands and the National Ceremonial Guard (NCG) Band. The South African Navy Band, the South African Air Force Band and the South African Military Health Service also operate in the country to represent their own branches.

=== Uganda ===

The Uganda People&#x27;s Defence Force sports a military band for each of the three services: Army, Air Force and Special Operations Command. All bands follow the British precedence. The senior band is the UPDF Band, part of the army, which serves ceremonial duties in Kampala. In the 1970s, military bands under President Idi Amin gained official sponsorship grew as a result.

=== Zimbabwe ===
The Zimbabwe Defence Force (ZDF) maintains multiple military bands that are based on the British pattern. The two main bands are the Zimbabwe National Army Band (shortened to the Zim Army Band) and the Air Force of Zimbabwe Band. The latter band has a traditional Hosho player serving in its ranks. A smaller band, Crocodile Sounds, is part of the Mechanized Brigade. The ZDF also maintains the Military School of Music (MSM), currently based at Imbizo Barracks in Bulawayo. In the now dissolved Rhodesian Security Forces, musical duties were provided by the Band and Drums of the Rhodesian African Rifles, notably led by Captain Ken MacDonald, composer of &quot;Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia&quot;, the Rhodesian anthem. A military band was also maintained by the Rhodesian Corps of Signals.

==Military bands in the Americas==
Given the history of the military forces in the Americas, the military band heritage in this part of the world is a mix of various traditions, primarily drawn from Europe. Countries in the Americas belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations are generally modelled after their British counterparts. Trinidad and Tobago take this tradition a bit further with the use of steelpans in its bands. Military bands throughout Latin America draws influence from the military bands found in France, Germany, Portugal, Italy, and Spain. However, Haiti remains the only state in the region whose military bands are primarily modelled after the French.

=== Argentina ===
Argentina has longstanding connections with Germany, and their army bands reflect these traditional links. At the beginning of the 20th century, there was an exchange of marches between the Imperial German Army and the Argentine Army: Germans gave Argentines &quot;Alte Kameraden&quot;, while Argentines gave Germans the &quot;Marcha de San Lorenzo&quot;, which was used in 1940 during the victory parade on the Champs Elysées following the defeat of France. Argentine military bands have field drummers and occasionally buglers and fifes (as is the case with the &quot;Tacuari Drummer&quot; military band of the Regiment of Patricians, which has two fifers) accompanying the main band.

Three bands belong to the oldest cavalry, artillery and infantry regiments of the Argentine Army, using band formations modeled on German and Italian traditions. All of them report to the Buenos Aires Garrison Command and are administrative, as with the other bands, fall under the Inspectorate General of Military Music.

* The Alto Peru Fanfare Band of the Argentine Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers is an all-brass mounted band using the brass and percussion instruments (and formerly bugles). The ceremonial uniform design dates from 1813, and this band serves the President of Argentina.
* The Tambor de Tacuari Band is the &quot;Regiment of Patricians&#x27;s regimental band. This regiment is the oldest and most prestigious Argentine line infantry regiment. Musicians wear the 1806 regulation uniform originally worn by the regiment when it was raised in response to the British attack on Buenos Aires. The Patricios formally represent the Federal Capital as its honor band.
* The Ituzaingó Band of the 1st Artillery Regiment &quot;Brigadier General Tomas de Iriarte&quot; is the official honor band of the Argentine Ministry of Defense. The band wears uniforms worn by Argentine gunners during the Argentina-Brazil War and later conflicts, with pith helmets as a headdress.

Another notable band of the Argentine Army is the Mounted Band of the 4th Armoured Cavalry Regiment (Mountain) &quot;General Lavalle&#x27;s Cuirassiers&quot;. They wear uniforms similar to those of the French Republican Guard Cavalry and 19th-century cuirassier units. This band uses the same brass and percussion instruments as in the Mounted Grenadiers, when either mounted or dismounted. There are currently 54 bands in the army. Other bands in the Army include:

* Band of the Colegio Militar de la Nación
* Band of the Army NCO School &quot;Sergeant Cabral&quot;
* Band of the General Jose de San Martin Military Academy
* Band of the General Manuel Belgrano Military Academy
* Band of the 16th Infantry Regiment &quot;Andes Rifles&quot;
* Band of the 10th Armored Cavalry Regiment &quot;Pueyrredón Hussars&quot;
* Band of the 6th Armored Cavalry Regiment &quot;Blandengues&quot;
* Band of the 5th Light Cavalry Regiment &quot;General Martin de Güemes&quot;
* Band of the 22nd Mountain Infantry Regiment &quot;Lieutenant Colonel Juan Manuel Cabot&quot;

The Argentine Navy fields the Navy Staff Band, the Band of the Argentine Naval Academy and the Band of the Argentine Navy NCO School. The Navy Staff Band is particularly unique that aside from buglers it also sports a bagpipe section. Representing the Argentine Air Force are the Band of the Argentine Air Force Academy, the Band of the Argentine Air Force NCO Academy, and the 1st Air Brigade Band.

Military-styled police bands are present in both the Argentine National Gendarmerie and the Argentine Naval Prefecture.

=== Barbados ===
The Barbados Defence Force Band (also known as the Zouave Band), is an element of the reserve units that are composed of members of The Barbados Regiment and the Barbados Defence Force.

=== Bolivia ===
In Bolivia, the use of the Turkish crescent with the addition of vertical banners and standards is standard practice in its military bands (only the Bolivian Navy fields bagpipers and fanfare trumpeters in its bands), while the drumline is stationed at the front of the ensemble, thus following both German and French practice. The bands of the Bolivian Colorados Regiment, the presidential guard infantry regiment, and of the Bolivian Army Military Music School are both designated as the country&#x27;s most senior military bands of the Bolivian Armed Forces. The Military Music School () was created by Supreme Decree on 20 May 1889. Today the anniversary of the school is celebrated on 20 May of each year. In 1951, it received the honorific &quot;Lt. Col. Adrián Patiño&quot;. It wears the service dress with the peaked cap. In addition the Band of the Military College of Bolivia served as the senior band of the military educational institutions, having been established in the early 20th century. The Band follows the Prussian precedent with the wearing of the Prussian-styled full dress on parades. Two additional regimental bands wear War of the Pacific era full dress in the Army (the bands of the 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Infantry Regiment).

A number of Army regimental bands wear either battle dress or combat dress uniform on parade, with combat helmets as headdress for the bandsmen. There&#x27;s only one mounted brass band.

Bands are also mounted by the Bolivian Navy and Air Force. As a general rule the bandsmen of these two services wear the service full dress uniform on parade, regardless of rank held (the Navy has an exception, as US dixie hats are worn with the full dress by bandsmen who are in lower-ranked ratings).

=== Brazil ===

Brazilian military bands descend from the small unit bands of the Portuguese Army in what was then Colonial Brazil. The last of these bands was the Band of the Brigada da Real da Marinha. The Armed Forces of the Empire of Brazil kept this tradition alive through the 19th century. Military bands became more common from the 1840s on, expanding into services such as military corps and the National Guard. Since the late 1940s, the Brazilian Marine Pipes, Drum and Bugle Corps uses brass (formerly bugles) and percussion instruments, as well as bagpipes and fifes. They represent both the Brazilian Marine Corps and the Brazilian Navy in all activities it participates. Its formation mirrors Portuguese and Italian military band traditions, as well as those of the United States drum and bugle corps of the early 20th century.

The Brazilian Marine Corps also fields for public duties the Brasilia Marine Corps Band and the Central Band of the Marine Corps. Other military bands include those of the Presidential Guard Battalion, the Independence Dragoons, and the Brazilian Air Force Academy Band. The band for the Presidential Guard Battalion is the only band in the Brazilian Army to include both a pipe band section and a drum corps. Personnel from both the Presidential Guard Battalion Band and the Band of the Independence Dragoons form part of the newly formed Army Marching Band and Pipes and Drums, formed in 2016. The Brazilian Marching Band and Pipes and Drums is composed of 74 musicians who play instruments ranging from instruments for marching bands to traditional instruments. Individual military units operate music bands. Currently, the 3rd Army Division Music Band serves one of the largest military garrisons in the country. Military bands are also active both in the Military Police and the Military Firefighters Corps, one of the most notable of which being the Symphonic Band of the Military Police of Paraná State.

=== Canada ===
Years of French and later British rule made their imprint in the creation of the Canadian military band tradition. The Music Branch of the Canadian Armed Forces is composed of six full-time bands of the Regular Force, and 53 part-time bands of the Primary Reserve. These bands serve the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force. The Music Branch includes both concert bands, made up of brass, percussions, and woodwind instruments; and pipe and drum bands, formerly the Branch provided corps of drums and drum and bugle corps for ceremonial duties.

In addition to the bands of the Regular Force and Primary Reserve, the Royal Military College of Canada also maintains a pipe and drum bands. The Canadian Cadet Organizations, a youth program sponsored by the Canadian Forces, also maintain their own bands. Bands of Cadets Canada are modeled after their respective sponsored service branch.

=== Chile ===

Two Chilean mounted bands are of high interest: the Mounted Band and Bugles of the 1st Cavalry Regiment &quot;Grenadiers&quot; and the Band and Bugles of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment &quot;Hussars&quot; of the Chilean Army. Other bands include the band of the Army NCO School and the Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Military Academy, also of the Chilean Army, the Band of the Chilean Marine Corps Basic School, the Band of the Arturo Prat Naval School and the Band of the Naval Politechnical Academy, all of the Chilean Navy and the National Band of the Carabineros. Band formations on parade, mounted bands included, follow the German model, however only the Chilean Air Force Symphonic Band does not participate - the service is represented on parade by the Bands of the Captain Manuel Avalos Prado Air Force Academy and the Air Forces Specialities School. Another band formation and one with increasing public awareness is the military band of the Chilean Gendarmerie, which reports to the Ministry of Justice.

Military bands in Chile have the same instrumentation with added bugles on the Corps of Drums, as German military bands, with a few unique additions (a remnant of the former French influence in the armed forces). Another distinguishing feature is the presence of the Turkish crescent in the military bands when they are on parade and the band&#x27;s conductor being assisted by a bugle major.

=== Colombia ===
The Military Forces of Colombia and the National Police of Colombia sport military bands and drum and bugle corps with formations similar to those in the United States, Italy, Germany and France. Military bands first reached Bogotá in the 16th century and were developed into active musical ensembles in the 20th century. In the late 1890s, military bands in the country were implemented based on the French model of these ensembles. The 37th Infantry Presidential Guard Battalion of the National Army of Colombia maintains a military band and a corps of drums unit that serves under the command of the President of Colombia at his/her residence at the Casa de Nariño. Pipe bands are also used in the Colombian Navy&#x27;s educational institutions (the Admiral Jose Prudencio Padilla Naval Academy and the Marine Basic School). The Military Symphonic Band of the Colombian Air Force (founded in November 1987) consists of male and females NCOs, many of which are part of the Band of the NCO School &quot;Captain Andrés M. Díaz&quot;, which wears the service full dress and marches with the school drum and bugle corps.

=== Cuba ===

Since the late 1960s, the tradition of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces Military Bands Department has been based mostly on the Russian tradition but also with a mix of the former American and Caribbean musical influence.

The previous regime of Fulgencio Batista, the military sported to military bands: the Music Band of the Cuban Navy (officially named as the Music Band of the Constitutional Navy) both of which were established 5 years apart in the first decade of the 20th century. The Band of the Ceremonial Unit of the Revolutionary Armed Forces has acclaimed high praise by many foreign leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama, who greeted bandleader Ney Miguel Milanes Gálvez and said that they did a &quot;Good job&quot; for their performance of The Star-Spangled Banner.

=== Dominican Republic ===
Given the long history of the Armed Forces of the Dominican Republic, it is no surprise that the military band tradition is a mix of the French and United States military band practice. Ceremonial bands are present not just in the Armed Forces but in the Dominican Republic National Police.

The Armed Forces&#x27; senior band is the Band of the Presidential Guard Regiment, the seniormost of the infantry of the Dominican Army, which serves as the protocol band for the President of the Dominican Republic, who serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.

=== Ecuador ===
As a general rule Ecuadorian military bands are manned by servicemen with formations modeled after the German, British and United States practice. In parades, the percussion forms the front rank of the band or massed bands during the march past segment of parades.

The Mounted Band of the Ecuadorian National Police uses brass, woodwinds and percussion (sans the timpani). The Ecuadorian Army&#x27;s Eloy Alfaro Military Academy uses the same format as French bands but without the bugles, as they are part of the Corps of Drums. The fanfare band of the Presidential Mounted Ceremonial Squadron &quot;Tarqui Grenadiers&quot;, also of the Army, is composed only of timpani, fanfare trumpets, a snare drum, single tenor drums and sousaphones (when mounted), the military band, which serves as the official presidential band, has a similar formation like the Military Academy but with the large size (around 60 musicians).

=== Guatemala ===
European influence of military bands in Guatemala began when an Italian opera company arrived in the country in the latter half of the 19th century to bring orchestra conductor Pietro Visoni to the country, where he was asked by President Miguel García Granados to take control of the bands of the 1st and 2nd battalions of the Guatemalan Army, after which Visoni merged the two and established the Martial Symphony Band, which is still in existence today. The School of Substitutes (known today as Military School of Music Maestro Rafael Alvarez Ovalle) was created shortly after due to the lack of trained military musicians in the country. The school of music is today a middle level military training center. Many bands, when in concert formation, include the marimba as it is the national instrument of Guatemala.

=== Jamaica ===

The Jamaica Defence Force funds and oversees two full-time military bands - the Jamaica Military Band (JMB) and the Jamaica Regiment Band (JRB). During war time, musicians will take on operational roles as Medical Assistants. Jamaican military bands follow the precedent set by British and other Caribbean military bands. The Jamaican Combined Cadet Force also maintains its own unit band.

=== Mexico ===
Military bands in Mexico follow the precedent of the Spanish military, with the band being on ceremonial occasions backed up by a drum and bugle corps mainly composed of snare drummers and buglers, both of which are provided by military units and educational institutions. In cavalry and artillery units of the Army and the cavalry of the National Guard, fanfare trumpeters are the equivalent to their infantry counterparts. In 1884, the 76-member Band of the 8th Mexican Cavalry Regiment under the direction of Encarnación Payén visited the World&#x27;s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition, which was seen as a massive PR campaign for American investment by Mexican President Porfirio Diaz. It was also designed to showcase Mexican military music, which was rarely if ever done before. Five years later, Diaz ordered the creation of the Music Band of the Supreme Power, which is now the Representative Music Band of the Mexican Armed Forces. In February 2015, it was reorganized to include personnel from the Secretariats of the Mexican Army, the Mexican Air Force and the Mexican Navy. The Symphonic Band and Chorus of the Secretariat of the Navy also serves as a military band, consisting of professional musicians in the Secretariat of the Navy.

The 1884 U.S. trip also influenced civilian music in the southern U.S., which many members of the band staying in New Orleans and forming and/or joining civilian bands. Lorenzo Tio Sr., the father of Lorenzo Tio Jr., was a notable example of this.

Bands and drummers and buglers wear the full dress or combat dress uniform of their service branch/unit or assigned educational institution, with appropriate distinctive unit insignia and patches.

=== Paraguay ===
Military bands are in service within the Armed Forces of Paraguay and the National Police of Paraguay, following the former Imperial German and French band patterns. The seniormost band is the Band of the Presidential Guard Regiment, which serves the President of Paraguay as Supreme Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, it falls under the operational control of the Paraguayan Army.

=== Peru ===

Examples of Peruvian bands include the Mounted Fanfare Band Company of the &quot;Mariscal Domingo Nieto&quot; Cavalry Regiment Escort, the Band of the Chorrillos Military School of the Peruvian Army, the Lima Air Region Band of the Peruvian Air Force, the Peruvian Air Force Central Band, and the Casma Cadet Band of the Peruvian Naval School. These bands follow the Spanish and French practice, although with drums out front following the French model, followed by the occasional bugle section (more often during the 1980s to early 1990s). The Presidential Life Guard Dragoons Regiment&#x27;s regimental band is also the only mounted band in active service within the Peruvian Armed Forces.

The Peruvian Republican Guard Band, for seven decades, provided music during state ceremonies, state funerals, and other events. The unit was disbanded in 1991 when the band was merged with that of the National Police&#x27;s other predecessor services&#x27; bands. The Mounted Band of the Presidential Life Guard Dragoons Regiment, the other official presidential band, was established in 1905 along with the formation of the regiment, was disbanded in 1987 and remained inactive until 2012, when it was reactivated by Ollanta Humala, the President of Peru.

In addition to the military bands of the Peruvian Armed Forces, the military-styled band of the National Police of Peru continues the heritage of the Republican Guard Band together with the bands of the Civil Guard and the Investigations Police. Assigned to Lima it has carried on the designation of official protocol band.

=== Trinidad and Tobago ===

Trinidadian military bands are unique in that they follow French and British traditions for military bands, however, they use unconventional instruments such as Steelpans and native Trinidadian instruments. To this day, the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force Steel Orchestra (TTDFSO) is the only military steel band of its kind in the world. The TTDF&#x27;s Trinidad and Tobago Regiment provides the majority of the musicians who are assigned to the orchestra.

=== United States ===

The American military band traditions date from the British era. From the American Revolutionary War onward military bands – and field musicians playing drums, fifes and bugles – marched in the same manner as their French counterparts. Ever since the American Revolution ended in 1781, American military bands march to the fast tempo of French military bands, owing to their fast marching pace as compared with the slow marching pace of British bands. The instrumental positioning, even though inspired by the British, is also a mix of other influences, including French and German influences.

During the American Civil War most Union regiments had both types of groups within the unit. However, due to changes in military tactics by the end of World War I field musical had been mostly phased out in favor of the brass bands - themselves the basis for today&#x27;s American civil brass band culture and traditions. These performed in a concert setting for entertainment, as well as continued to perform drill and martial events. In the United States, these bands were increased in instrumentation to include woodwinds, leading to the modern military band traditions in the United States, and high school and college marching bands and concert bands.

A uniquely American type of military band is the Fife and drum corps, with the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps the only remaining band of this type in the United States military. The United States&#x27; military bugle bands are also the precursors of the modern-day civil drum and bugle corps and the only one in active service today is that of the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps &quot;The Commandant&#x27;s Own&quot;.

The largest military marching band in the U.S. is the &quot;Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band&quot; of Texas A&amp;M University. It is entirely composed of ROTC cadets from the university&#x27;s Corps of Cadets and subdivided into two bands: the Infantry and Artillery bands of the Corps. The four other State Military Colleges and four Junior Military Colleges maintain bands of their own. The format used by the British Royal Marines is the formation used by the Valley Forge Military Academy and College Regimental Band in Wayne, Pennsylvania, led and staffed by retired RMBS personnel, and by the United States Merchant Marine Academy Regimental Band, also modeled on the Royal Marines bands. Another American military academy, the Missouri Military Academy, has its band modeled in the same manner as the Royal Marines.

=== Uruguay ===
The Mounted Band of the 1st Cavalry Regiment &quot;José Gervasio Artigas&#x27;s Blandengues&quot; of the Uruguayan Army is a mounted band following the Argentine practice, wearing the regiment&#x27;s 19th-century full dress uniforms, but unlike its Argentine counterpart, also uses woodwinds. Another example is that of the Army&#x27;s 1st Infantry Brigade Band, the official honors band of the General Assembly of Uruguay, which sports dress uniforms worn during the Argentina-Brazil War and later conflicts. Bands are also mounted by the Army&#x27;s Uruguayan Military School and the General Artigas Military High School, the latter having recently reinstated the use of the bugle for its field section, the only band to do so. The Air Force Band, which reports to the Air Force Academy, is the only one that uses the shoulder-mounted snares and the multiple tenor drum. Uruguayan military bands have field drummers and occasionally buglers and fifes accompanying the main band. The National Navy of Uruguay maintains for ceremonial purposes the Band of the Uruguayan Naval Academy, which doubles as the official band of the service. It has a bagpipe section attached to it.

The &quot;Day of the Military Musicians&quot; is marked in the Armed Forces celebrated on 30 November, with the International Festival of Military Bands held every year on this date.

==Military bands in Asia==
=== Armenia ===
The Military Band Division of the General Staff of Armed Forces of Armenia oversees all of the military bands in Armenia. The Band of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Armenia is the seniormost military band in the entire military, performing at all state functions and national military parades. It follows the Russian and Europe a precedent for military bands, being formed from the former Band of The Soviet Army Yerevan Garrison. The combined band performs as a guest contingent in the military parade of the Artsakh Defense Army in Stepanakert. The Police Band of Armenia formerly served as the band of the country&#x27;s Internal Troops. Like the Armenian Army and the Police of Armenia, the Rescue Service of the Ministry of Emergency Situations maintains a 48-member military brass band known as the &quot;Poghatin Nvagaxumb&quot;, founded recently in 2010 by order of by Minister Armen Yeritsyan. The Armenian Border Guard also maintains its own brass band.

=== Brunei ===
The Band of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces (&quot;Pancaragam Angkatan Bersenjata Diraja Brunei&quot;) is the official band of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces. Raised in 1962, it was at first led by musicians seconded from British Army formations and graduates of the prestigious Royal Military School of Music. Badged at first as the regimental band of the then newly raised Royal Brunei Malay Regiment, it became the Armed Forces Band in 1984, when the country attained independence. The band&#x27;s first Brunei-born Director of Music, Major Haji Manaf bin Kamis, was appointed to that role that year and was on the helm during the country&#x27;s first Independence Day parade on 23 February that year. Its international participation thru the years has been in military tattoos such as the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, the Brunei Darussalam International Tattoo and the Berlin Military Music Festival. The RBAF Band first participated in the Hari Merdeka celebrations and the Kuala Lumpur International Tattoo in Malaysia in 2007 and has since become one of the more popular guest bands in Malaysian celebrations. Since then the RBAF Band has served as the official state and protocol band of the nation, playing during state visits, the ceremonial opening of the sessions of the Legislative Council, passing out parades, state funerals and key national holidays. As of 2003 Major Awg Jaya bin Metussin is the director of music of the RBAF Band. Since its raising the band followed the format of British Army bands of line infantry regiments with the drumline at the front of the band, since it was formed with assistance from their musicians and experienced band leaders from the British Army as well as from the bands of both the Royal Brunei Police Force (established 1958) and the Royal Malaysian Police in the neighbouring Malaysian state of Sarawak.

===China===

Military music bands within China are descended from the brass and percussion formations raised during the Imperial era and the first Western-styled military bands formed during the final decades of the Qing Dynasty, as the nation began to modernize its armed forces. During the Boxer Rebellion, the xenophobic Chinese General Dong Fuxiang who commanded the Muslim Kansu Braves, refused to allow his troops to play western musical instruments, making them play traditional Chinese instruments such as the Sheng Jia.

Although inspired by Soviet military music throughout their history, the bands of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, from both the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) or the People&#x27;s Armed Police play indigenous and locally composed military marches, during official ceremonies and other events as called for. The military bands of the People&#x27;s Republic of China play a mix of foreign and native marches and musical pieces. Their formation today mirrors those of bands in Russia, up until 2009 the formation was a throwback to those used there in the parades of the 1930s and 1940s.

The Central Military Band of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army is the senior military band in the country, with the band falling under the command and supervision of the Political Work Department, which is a directorate of the Central Military Commission.

The PLA National Marching Band is a distinct unit attached to the PLA Central Band, which consists of 61 field drummers, state fanfare trumpeters, and buglers who are similar in marching style to the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, and somewhat resembles United States college marching bands. Other unit bands exist in the PLA known as &quot;amateur bands&quot;, with those including the Women&#x27;s Military Band of the PLA National Defense University, the 14th Group Army Band, the PLA Airborne Corps Band and the 6th Armored Division Band.

====Hong Kong====
The band of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison is modelled similarly to the other garrison bands of the PLA. Along with the PLA Hong Kong Garrison, the police band for the Hong Kong Police provides similar functions to a military band. These bands will often play a mix of Chinese, and international marches.

In addition to the band of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison, military-styled bands in Hong Kong are typically modelled after British and Commonwealth military bands. As a result, a number of military-styled bands in Hong Kong will also make use of pipe bands, a common feature with military bands in the Commonwealth. The band of the Hong Kong Sea Cadet Corps is modelled after the Royal Navy pattern. Formerly, the Band of the Royal Hong Kong Regiment was used as the official protocol band.

====Macau====
The Public Security Police Force of Macau maintains a military-style band that reflects the region&#x27;s Portuguese military traditions. This band is known as the &quot;Banda de Música da Polícia de Segurança Pública de Macau&quot;, or the &quot;Band of the PSP&quot; for short. The Band of the PLA Macao Garrison is also available in the region.

=== India ===

Indian military bands are based on the British pattern and have evolved to be unique in its own right. Martial bands have existed in Indian culture since the era of the Maratha Empire. It was only in the 18th century that organized military bands were brought to India by the British Army. Military bands are maintained throughout the regimental centres of the Indian Army, Indian Navy commands and bases and the air stations of the Indian Air Force. As a general rule bands are fronted by tuba and euphonium players in the front rank, a tradition inherited from the Royal Artillery Band, a few bands have trombonists in the front ranks.

India boasts the largest number of military bands, with the Indian Armed Forces today having more than 60 military bands and over 400 pipe bands. The Military Music Wing of the Army Education Corps is the principal musical education institution of the Indian Army. The Indian military also has dedicated pipe bands that serve as independent units and are maintained by all infantry regiments. A regular military band consists of a band master and 33 musicians while a regular Army pipe band consists of a drum major, a pipe major and a minimum size of 17 drummers and pipers for battalion formations, mostly from the infantry battalions.

=== Indonesia ===

The modern Indonesian military band tradition includes Japanese, Dutch, British and United States influences, with prior forms from Portuguese and Chinese origin. Known locally as &quot;Ceremonial Bands&quot; (&quot;Korps Musik Upacara&quot;/&quot;Satuan Musik Upacara&quot;/&quot;Detasemen Musik Upacara&quot;), they form part of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. The most senior of these bands is the Paspampres Presidential Band, which is part of the Presidential Security Forces of the Republic of Indonesia. These bands are led by Conductors and Bandmasters and are of the headquarters element. Indonesia also maintains a &quot;corps of drums&quot; tradition, such ensembles being led by drum majors. These exist either as full bands or guard post bands (termed as &quot;genderang sangkakala&quot;) which provide the arrival or departure honors for distinguished military and police officers and government officials. Such ceremonial units, both bands and field music, are also part of the Dutch colonial legacy, as both the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and the Royal Netherlands Navy included similar formations before independence, both on the basis of the existing Tanjidor civil band culture of Jakarta, developed as a result of the Dutch band traditions which arrived in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Similar ceremonial bands are maintained by the Indonesian National Police.

=== Iran ===
All Iranian military bands follow the British, French and Arab format for these units, with the percussion at the front ranks following the practice of the British line infantry and the Royal Marines (with occasional bugles following Russian precedents). The first military band concept in Iran came in the mid to late-1800s after the European tours of King Naser al-Din Shah Qajar of Persia. After his first tour in the 1860s, he ordered the creation of a military music school and an Imperial Army band. He specifically employed French musicians in the westernization of the military bands in the country.

The Iranian Armed Forces maintains military bands in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Islamic Republic of Iran Army. The latter maintains military bands across its branches, including the Ground Forces, Air Force, and Navy.

Prior to 1979, the Bands of the Imperial Immortal Guard provided musical accompaniment for official events of state. All of these bands provide honours for the Iranian President and during events such as state visits and national holidays in a tri-service format in the capital of Tehran. Bands are also provided by territorial military units within the country&#x27;s provinces and major cities.

=== Iraq ===
Iraqi army music bands were formed on 30 August 1922. The Military Music School is the primary educational institution for military bands. Many Iraqi military bands have become in high demand since the Iraq War and the War on Terror.

=== Israel ===
Even before the 1948 establishment of the State of Israel, military bands have been active and prominent in the region for many decades. As it refers to bands inside the current borders of Israel, the only known ones were small groups of soldiers organized in the country&#x27;s first 20 years in existence. These bands were formed up of soldiers who served in battalions who were deployed in remote parts of the country. Israeli military bands reached what is considered to be their golden age during the late &#x27;60s and mid-&#x27;70s. At the time, many famous and well-off actors and musicians based in Israel received their musical education not from a music school, but rather from military bands within the Army, which as a general rule were inspired at first by the musical traditions of the British Armed Forces.

Today, the Israel Defense Forces Orchestra, which has similarities to American and British military bands plus a mix of the Russian tradition with its trumpeters stationed at front of the band, is the flagship ensemble of the IDF and responsible for live musical accompaniment at all national events taking place in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Additionally, bands are also found in the Education and Youth Corps of the IDF&#x27;s Manpower Directorate. The Outstanding Musicians Program of the IDF is the most common of the varied ways that young soldiers continue to develop and advance their musical skills during their military service within the Forces.

=== Japan ===

The Western military band tradition arrived in Japan during the Meiji Restoration, which saw the armed forces reformed to the standards of Western armed services. Today, the Japan Self-Defense Force sports a moderate number of military bands within all its service branches (The Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces) which carry on a long heritage of Japanese military music beginning in the 1880s. The JSDF also carries on the Imperial practice of bugle call playing, and every service branch has dedicated bugle platoons present in almost every unit using G major bugles similar to those used by the United States Army in the past.

Japanese military bands have a number of formations, modeled on those in the United States and the United Kingdom, and they are led by Drum Majors, Conductors and Bandmasters, while the bugle platoons are led on parades by a Bugle Major. Aside from ceremonial duties, military musicians have no secondary duties, while buglers serve combat roles.

The main military bands of the JSDF include the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force Central Band, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Band, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force Central Band. In addition to the three service branches&#x27; centralized bands, the JSDF also maintains several regimental, brigade and divisional bands, including the Eastern Army Band, the Central Army Band, 1st Division Band, and the Tokyo SDF Band.

Until 1945, the Japanese Imperial Guard maintained mounted cavalry and dismounted bands that performed musical duties, alongside the rest of the bands of both the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy.

=== Jordan ===
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, like many other Arab nations and Commonwealth countries, follow the British precedent and pattern for military bands. The Jordanian Armed Forces sports many different military bands that span its three branches of service. Like other Middle Eastern military bands, Jordan follows the tradition of including pipe bands in its units. The military arranges the Jordanian Army Band Corps, which is the organizational body for military music, in a similar fashion to the Bands of the Household Division. In 1952, a small school of music was built in order to begin training military musicians. The most senior band in the armed forces is the Jordanian Armed Forces Band, which particularly serves the House of Hashim in its position as the ruling royal family of Jordan.

Jordanian military band institutions and units include the School of Music of the Jordanian Armed Forces, Prince of Jordan Pipe Band, and the Al Hussein Musical Band.

=== Kazakhstan ===
While retaining a lot of Soviet/Russian military music that was composed in the Soviet era, military bands in the Armed Forces of Kazakhstan and/or the Ministry of Internal Affairs perform indigenous marches that are native to Kazakhstan and were made by Kazakh composers. The Military Band Service is responsible for the organization, layout, and instruction of all military bands under its command. The most notable Kazakh military band is the Presidential Band of the State Security Service of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which is used for state ceremonies carried out by the State Security Service of Kazakhstan in the presence of the President of Kazakhstan in his/her position as the Supreme Commander in Chief of the national military. Military bands are also maintained in the Ministry of Defense and the National Guard, as well as in the four regional commands of the country. Most of the leadership in these bands also work in the State Concert Band of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

=== Laos ===
Laotian military bands under the command of the Lao People&#x27;s Armed Forces follow the military format and tradition of military bands from Vietnam and China. The Vietnam People&#x27;s Army often provides music lessons to musical soldiers of military bands in Laos.

=== Lebanon ===
The sole military band in Lebanon is known simply as the Army Band, providing support to the Army Command and its units. It follows the French precedent as well as an indigenous Arab format for military bands. It is the descendant of a band called the &quot;Band of the Armies of the Levant&quot; that was formed following the First World War. It was later renamed &quot;The Band of the post&quot; and became a sub-unit of the Republican Guard in the 70s, is known as the &quot;Company of the Army Band&quot;. It is presently stationed at Karantina Barracks in Beirut. It is modelled more on that of the Republican Guard with the main band and a fanfare band section.

=== Malaysia ===

Malaysian military bands are led by the percussion (snare drums either slung or mounted, bass drums, single and multiple tenor drums, cymbals and sometimes glockenspiels), and followed by the brass and woodwinds (with the addition of trumpets, mellophones, marching baritone, contrabass bugles and sousaphones), following a formation format that is similar to the Royal Marines Bands Service and former Royal Navy bands, and inspired by its long cultural heritage in music.

=== Mongolia ===

Military bands in the Mongolian Armed Forces and the preceding Mongolian People&#x27;s Army followed the Russian model and utilized many Russian aspects used in the 20th century. Prior to the expansion of China&#x27;s Qing Dynasty into what is now Mongolia, traditional Mongol Empire-era instrumentation was used in bands for hundreds of years. During a visit of the Bogd Khanate Prime Minister Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren to St. Petersburg, Russia in late 1913 and early 1914, he an artillery band was present to perform for him. Impressed by the military band, he requested that the Russian government give him brass musical instruments so that he could form a local band of close to a dozen musicians. This gave way for what would become the first modern military band in the country. The country currently operates three military bands: The Military Band of the General Staff, the Military Music College of the National Defense University and the Mongolian Military Song and Dance Academic Ensemble. Notable Mongolian military musicians include Colonel Navaany Tserenpil (1914–1978, commonly called the &quot;Mongolian March King&quot;), Ganbat Yondondüichiriin (born 1951) and Pürevjavyn Khayankhyarvaa (born 1935). As part of the expansion of the army in the late 1960s, the Minister of Defense organized the Music Group of the Civil Defense, which has since 2009, been known as the Emergency Services Band under the National Emergency Management Agency.

=== Myanmar ===

Band formations in the Tatmadaw follow the former British pattern, especially of the bands of the Royal Marines Band Service and the former Royal Navy bands. The Central Military Band of the Myanmar Armed Forces was formed on 30 November 1988 in the Hmawbi Township of the Yangon Region. Other service bands were formed in October 1991. On 23 April 1997, the ceremonial Honor Guard Troop as well as music bands from the Army, Navy, and Air Force were combined to form the Honor Guard and Military Music Troop of the Tatmadaw. On 4 February 2006 the Honor Guard and Military Music Troop was transferred to the capital of Naypyidaw.
 All army Regional Military Command (RMCs) maintain military bands. The 240-member Myanmar Police Band, which is the country&#x27;s oldest brass band (it was formed in 1945), also serves as a type of military band as it is part of the Armed Forces.

===North Korea===

The bands of the Korean People&#x27;s Army and the Korean People&#x27;s Internal Security Forces follow the general instrumental setup of Daechwitas, the Korean traditional military bands. They also resemble Russian and Chinese military bands, adopting the Soviet tradition of adding chromatic fanfare trumpeters when in massed bands formation. As in keeping with the Songun policy and Juche ideology within the KPA, as directly reporting units of its General Political Bureau, most of its repertoire is made up locally composed marches, plus classical and modern music adapted for the band. Until 2013 French horns formed the front rank of the Pyongyang parade massed bands, today they are fronted by Wagner tubas and euphoniums.

North Korean bands are known around the world for their marching techniques and their complex marching maneuvers, some of which are only found in large college marching bands such as the Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band, and a tradition which began in 1997. The military bands in the KPA and police bands in the KPISF are led by a Conductor or Director of Music, with a Drum Major joining him or her to mark the pace of the bands, if in massed bands formation, they are led by a Senior Director of Music, 2–6 conductors, 4–8 bandmasters and 5 to 6 drum majors (with 2 female drum majors included).

=== Oman ===
The Omani Royal Guard Military Band is the official music band of the Royal Guard of Oman and the most senior military band of the Sultan of Oman&#x27;s Armed Forces. It is specifically designed to provide ceremonial honours to the Sultan of Oman and the House of Al Said in all settings including arrival ceremonies at Al Alam Palace. The band operates the Royal Oman Symphony Orchestra, pipe band formations and a school of music. The RGO sports what is the only camel mounted pipe band known as the Royal Cavalry Mounted Band, whose horses consist a mix of Arabs, Clydesdales and Shires.

The Royal Army of Oman, the Royal Navy of Oman, and Royal Air Force of Oman also maintain their own separate military brass and pipe bands.

The Air Force Band was conceived in the early 1980s when Sultan Qaboos bin Said issued Royal directives for the formation of the Sultan of Oman Air Force Band. In June 1990 the name of was changed to Royal of Oman Air Force (RAFO) Band.

All these bands and pipe bands, as well as the mounted bands, follow the British precedent, with ceremonial bugle platoons and fanfare trumpet teams. The band formation is modeled more on the Royal Marines Band Service.

=== Pakistan ===
Military bands in Pakistan are derived from the British format and are closely associated with the format followed by their neighbors in India. The Pakistan Armed Forces Band is the chief military band in the country. All army musicians are trained by the Army School of Music, which was raised in Abbottabad in 1956 and have been linked with the Baloch Regimental Centre since 1965. It has the sole purpose of training officers and soldiers serving in both military bands and pipe bands.

The following bands are in the armed forces:
*Pakistan Army Armoured Corps Centre Band (Nowshera)

The following bands are part of the Pakistani Navy: Naval HQ Band Islamabad, Navy Band Lahore. The paramilitary Pakistan Rangers and the Frontier Corps also maintain military bands and pipes and drums are well. The Desert Rangers maintain a camel mounted band that consists of pipers and brass players in the unit.

=== Philippines ===

The military band tradition in the Philippines is modeled primarily on the traditions of military bands of the United States and Spain since it was their respective armed forces that brought the Western march and military band tradition to the islands.

The Philippine Army Band is the main military band of the Philippine Army, and the seniormost marching band of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). It was founded as the Philippine Constabulary Band in the early 1900s, and was eventually reorganized into the Philippine Army Orchestra, and then the Philippine Army Headquarters Band. Currently, the Philippine Army Band is composed of 74 musicians who are under the leadership of Captain Ronel A. Rabot. It is an army service support unit, so, therefore, it is under the administrative command of the Philippine Army Reserve Command. The Philippine Marine Corps Drum and Bugle Team (MDBT) is the prime musical unit of the Philippine Marine Corps and the only Drum and Bugle Corps in the entire AFP. It is inspired by the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps and is based at Rudiardo Brown Marine Barracks in Taguig. The Presidential Security Command, the Philippine Navy, and the Philippine Air Force also maintain their own marching bands, as well as the paramilitary Philippine Coast Guard under the Department of Transportation. In addition the General Headquarters Band of the Armed Forces, based in Quezon City, is the official band of the Armed Forces and serves as protocol band for the Secretary of National Defense. The GHQ Band was established in the 1950s to provide the Armed Forces with a separate band of its own drawn from personnel from all branches of the armed forces.

As a general rule bandsmen wear the service dress, duty or combat dress uniform of their service branch. Enlisted personnel of the Philippine Military Academy Band use American style enlisted rank insignia in their service dark blues, worn with either the peaked cap or the shako with black hackle. The Philippine Army Band, assigned to the Escort and Security Battalion, wears the unit&#x27;s First Republic styled rayadillo uniforms with straw tricorne-style hats with the drum major wearing a pith helmet, with similar uniforms worn by the PSC Band.

=== Singapore ===
Until the 1990s the Singapore Armed Forces and Singapore Police Force band formations were similar to the Royal Marines Band Service, and Malaysian military bands. In the beginning of the 21st century this was changed to a format similar to British Army and Royal Air Force military bands before returning to the RMBS precedence in 2020. The Singapore Armed Forces Band form the Singapore Armed Forces musical arm, which plays a vital role in parades and ceremonies such as the Singapore National Day Parade. Before the 1994 unification of SAF Bands under one unit, the different service arms of the SAF fielded their own bands, which would make up the combined inter-service massed bands for the NDP from 1987 to 1997. Since 1986, all the three bands of the SAF, as well as the Band Training Wing, are manned by both male and female bandsmen reflecting the country&#x27;s diverse ethnicities.

The band service traces their origins to the beginning of Singapore&#x27;s self-governance. The Singapore Infantry Regiment Band (current Ceremonial Band A and formerly the Staff Band of the Singapore Military Forces) was raised in 1958 alongside its then parent unit, and was briefly rebadged as the Singapore Army Band in the 1980s. In 1972, the current form of three bands was finalized when what are now the SAF Central Band and Ceremonial Band B were made operational, and both moved to other branches in the 70s and 80s, becoming the Republic of Singapore Navy Band in 1977 and the Republic of Singapore Air Force Band in 1982. Their first appearance together in the NDP was in 1987&#x27;s edition in the Padang conducted by the SAF&#x27;s first Senior Director of Music MAJ Erwin Dragon, with another joint performance in 1990. 1988 saw the rebirth of the SAF Music Board and the formation of the SAF Symphonic Wind Band.

===South Korea===

Although patterned after American and British military bands, the bands of the Republic of Korea are also inspired by the &quot;daechwita&quot; of the old Korean kingdoms. Their formation mirrors American and British military band formations. The Republic of Korea Army maintains a Traditional Band playing in the &quot;daechwita&quot; styles of old, using Korean traditional musical instruments.

The Republic of Korea Armed Forces (South Korean Armed Forces) maintains a number of bands including the Republic of Korea Air Force Band, the Republic of Korea Army Band, the Republic of Korea Navy Band, the Republic of Korea Marine Corps Band. In addition to the main bands of the service branches, the Republic of Korean Armed Forces also maintains a Traditional Daechwita Band of the Armed Forces, as well as military bands in its military academies, including the Band of the Korea Military Academy, the Band of the Korea Naval Academy, and the Band of the Korea Air Force Academy.

When military bands were originally formed in South Korea, American military music was the primary type of musical accompaniment used by ROK bands, as the bands were formed with United States assistance, with later influences from bands of the other armed forces which assisted the ROKAF during the Korean War (Canada and Greece for example). Later on in the 1970s, Korean martial and traditional music were incorporated into the repertoire of the bands, including modernized adaptations of folk songs for performances during concerts.

=== Sri Lanka ===
===Taiwan===

Military bands of the Republic of China (ROC) can trace their origins to the 1911 revolution. Existing military band units include:

* ROC Ministry of National Defense Symphony Orchestra (國防部示範樂隊)
* ROC Army Band (中華民國陸軍樂隊)
* ROC Navy Band (中華民國海軍樂隊)
* ROC Marine Corps Band (中華民國海軍陸戰隊軍樂隊)

* ROC Military Academy Marching Band (陸軍軍官校軍樂隊)
* ROC Air Force Academy Marching Band (空軍軍官學校軍樂隊)
* ROC Army Academy Military Band (陸軍專科學校軍樂隊)
All these bands are inspired by American and German military band traditions, and their formation mirrors those used by United States military bands. Taiwan also has a great military drum and bugle corps tradition as well with a few military drum and bugle corps in active service, with their formations not quite similar to the American corps. Corps style marching bands may also be found in the Armed Forces Preparatory School and the Republic of China Army Academy.

=== Thailand ===

Military bands in Thailand were inspired by British military bands, although they play uniquely Thai military marches. The ceremony has been performed during the Trooping of the Colours ceremonies in Bangkok every December 2 since 1953, and at every military function attended by the Royal Family and other military officers and local executives, together with the general public.

Thai military bands&#x27; formations closely follow either that of the British Royal Marines Band Service, being that the percussion are at the front rather than the middle, followed by the main band itself or that of the British Army&#x27;s Household Division Foot Guards Bands, being that the percussion are at the middle of the main band. But another formation followed is that of the Brazilian military bands, wherein the percussion are in front of the brass and winds, with the bass drums as the lead instruments. These bands are led by a Drum Major and the Director of Music.

The massed military bands of the Thai Armed Forces that are involved with the Thai Royal Guards parade include following bands whose combined strength is up to 180 musicians who are under the direction of the Director of Music of the Bangkok Garrison District:

* Band of the 1st Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, King&#x27;s Own Bodyguard
* Band of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, King&#x27;s Own Bodyguard
* Band of the 1st Battalion, 11th Infantry Regiment, King&#x27;s Guard
* Regimental Band of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy
* Band of the 2nd Battalion, 11th Infantry Regiment, King&#x27;s Guard
* Band of the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, Queen&#x27;s Guard
* Band of the 1st Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, King&#x27;s Guard
* Regimental Band of the Navaminda Kasatriyadhiraj Royal Thai Air Force Academy
The Royal Thai Navy Music Division has existed since the existence of a naval department of the Royal Thai Army.

=== Turkey ===
The Ottoman military band style is retained today through the &quot;Armed Forces Mehter Unit&quot; (&quot;Mehter Bölüğü&quot;) at the Istanbul Military Museum (&quot;Askeri Müze&quot;). It is based on a tradition that can be dated back to the 13th century and even further back. It has participated in ceremonies in Germany, Russia and Azerbaijan where it presents itself as a historical unit. Other military bands existed with a more European tradition due to the influence of the Italian Instructor General of the Imperial Ottoman Music Giuseppe Donizetti. With the declaration of the Republic, military bands were expanded in their organization in the newly formed Armed Forces to a more western format. This was done by order President Atatürk to establish culture of the arts in the new republic. On the other hand, the instrument of Turkish origin, the Turkish crescent, is commonly displayed during military band formations in Turkey and around the world.

Nowadays, the regular bands of the Turkish Armed Forces have continued to follow a more Western pattern, with the &quot;Harmonic Band of the Turkish Armed Forces&quot; being the seniormost and oldest of its kind in modern-day Turkey, being founded in 1826 by order of Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II under the name of &quot;Musika-i Hümayun&quot; (Royal Band in Ottoman Turkish). Prior to its establishment, Janissary bands were the only protocol bands utilized in the Ottoman Army. As part of Atatürk&#x27;s cultural reform, it was moved to Ankara with the administration of Osman Zeki Üngör and was separated from present-day presidential symphony orchestra in 1933 under the command of Turkish Armed Forces. The harmonic band performs protocol duties at the Çankaya Köşkü (the official residence of the Prime Minister of Turkey until 2014) in Ankara, formerly with the honour guard of the Presidential Guard Regiment and currently with ceremonial units of the Gendarmerie.

The Turkish Gendarmerie also maintains its own military band, alongside the bands of the official branches of the military. The Turkish Air Force Command maintains its own marching and dance band, both founded in 1961 with the directive of the Air Force Commander İrfan Tansel. The Turkish Armed Forces School of Music provides musical training and education to all current and potential members of these bands.

A Drum and Bugle Corps is also maintained in the Naval High School of the Turkish Navy. There are three independent jazz orchestras within the TAF: &quot;Türkay&quot; of the Land Forces Command, the &quot;Eagles of Jazz&quot; in the Air Force and Starfish Jazz Orchestra from the Naval Forces Command. The latter was formed in 2008 consists of non-commissioned officers, being considered to be the &quot;flagship&quot; of Turkish jazz. The harmonic band has a specialized small ensemble called Harmony Stars Orchestra, which was established within the body of harmonic band in 2006.

=== Uzbekistan ===
Military bands in Uzbekistan were inspired and follow the pattern of Russian military bands. On top of this, the Armed Forces of Uzbekistan pioneered a specific tradition with military bands, having a different march step and repertoire. The Band of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Uzbekistan is the seniormost band in the military that reports directly to the Uzbek Defense Minister. It is primarily responsible for the arrival ceremony at the Kuksaroy Presidential Palace for world leaders visiting Tashkent.

The band operates as a music center for the military, having authority over other affiliated military bands such as the following district bands:

* Band of the Tashkent Military District
* Band of the Northwest Military District
* Band of the Southwest Special Military District
* Band of the Central Military District
* Band of the Eastern Military District

The Ministry of Internal Affairs operates several musical ensembles, including the Exemplary Band of the MVD (founded in 1993), of which notable members included Lieutenant Colonel Yunus Gulzarov and its founder Colonel Grigor Terzyan. The Band of the Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs was founded in 1981 as a military band for the Tashkent MVD High School, beginning its public activities in the 1982 academic year. In 1992, Lieutenant Khasan Nazarov took control of the band, re branding it to reflect the new name of the school. It was originally a volunteer band composed of unpaid musicians from the academy. This would change in 2004 when its members were replaced with professional Uzbek musicians.

The Band of the Uzbekistan National Guard supports the musical activities of the National Guard. Founded in 1944, the Republican Specialized Academic Lyceum of Music of the National Guard provides special military training for musicians in their youth aged 14 to 18 like the Moscow Military Music College in Russia.

Other bands include those that are part of the Chirchiq Higher Tank Command and Engineering School and the Frontier Service.

=== Vietnam ===

Modern military bands that are part of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam are heavily influenced and inspired by military bands in Russia and China, as well as bands from their former pre-independence colonizer, France. The first modern military bands in Vietnam were organized between 1944 and 1954, during the first 10 years of the establishment of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The Military Band of the General Staff Command of the Military Honour Guard Battalion of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army supports the ceremonial activities of the VPA and is the seniormost band of the armed forces, with bands stationed in formations from the regimental level above and in all educational institutions. Military bands are also maintained in the Vietnam People&#x27;s Public Security.

==Military bands in Europe==
=== Austria ===
Military bands of Austria are for the most part similar to the German musical format, although some military bands lack a Corps of Drums, which is the most notable part of the German format. The Gardemusik Wien of the Guard Battalion is the seniormost band in the armed forces and is the one responsible for playing at all state ceremonies and events.

The first military bands in Austria were organized in 1741, with ensembles being restricted to infantry and artillery units. They reached their golden age between the 1820s and the mid-1840s, being inspired by French military tradition and reforms. Military bands at this point, were led by a director of music and were composed of 50-60 civilian musicians. By the turn of the 20th century, Austrian Military Music Bands included 178 regimental bands in the Army alone (majority in the infantry), which was composed of over 10,000 musicians. Outside the Gardemusik, military bands are divided into the following regional bands:

*Military Band Burgenland
*Military Band Kärnten
*Military Band Niederösterreich
*Military Band Oberösterreich
*Military Band Salzburg
*Military Band Steiermark
*Military Band Tirol
*Military Band Vorarlberg

From October 2014, the abandonment of five Austrian military bands, including the military band in Vorarlberg, was discussed for cost reasons. In December 2014, the government agreed to keep the nine locations with a reduced staff. Instead of the previous 47, there are to be 20 musicians per state in the future. In May 2016, during the Austrian governors&#x27; conference, together with Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil, it was decided to that military bands should be preserved in every federal state, consisting of 43 to 47 musicians.

=== Belarus ===
The massed bands of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus follow the Russian traditional model with elements of Belarusian music in its repertoire. Regional bands from each of the military commandants form the basis of the band service along with the Exemplary Band (also known as the &quot;BelArmyBand&quot;), the Band of the Honor Guard Company, the Central Band of the Interior Ministry and the Band of the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The bands of the regional departments of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are also affiliated as well to the service.

=== Belgium ===
The Belgian Armed Forces have three professional military bands, each representing one of the service branches. Bands of the Belgian Armed Forces include the Royal Band of the Belgian Guides, the Band of the Belgian Navy, and the Royal Symphonic Band of the Belgian Air Force. All follow the British precedent due to these bands being based in the United Kingdom for much of the Second World War, with elements from the band traditions of France, the Netherlands and Germany.

The oldest and largest of these is the Royal Band of the Belgian Guides (former cavalry) dating from 1832. The bands of the Belgian Navy and of the Royal Belgian Air Component both date from 1947. The combined bands are known as the Music Bands of the Belgian Defense and consist of a total of nearly 200 professional musicians, all of whom holds a diploma from a Royal Conservatory.

=== Bulgaria ===
Military bands in Bulgaria are under the jurisdictional authority of the Bulgarian Armed Forces. They are shaped by the Russian and German examples as well as follow their own precedent. The senior band is the Representative Guards Band from the National Guards Unit. It was formerly the Central Brass Band of the Bulgarian People&#x27;s Army and the Band of the Bulgarian Life Guards Squadron before that. The armed forces also maintain three service bands: the Ground Forces Band from Sofia, the Navy Band from Varna and the Air Force Band from Plovdiv.

The Ground Forces Band was established in 2000 as a direct successor to the Band of the 4th Infantry Regiment of Pleven, which has a more than 120 years of history. On 28 February 1884, Franz Minarick was appointed as the bandmaster of the newly formed Navy band. The air force band was created on 1 October 2000 (Bulgarian Music Day) from the Tactical Aviation Corps Band and the Plovdiv Garrison Brass Band.

=== Cyprus ===
==== Republic of Cyprus ====
The Military Music Department of the Cypriot National Guard is the official music band in the Republic of Cyprus. It is based on Greek and British military traditions. The National Guard Band was founded in 1968 and its staff comes from conscript musicians performing their service term within the Guard.

==== Northern Cyprus ====
The modern day Security Forces Command Band of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is based in primarily Turkish influences. It dates back to British rule over the island, when Captain Zeki Taner established the foundations for a Mujahideen Band to be formed in 1958 from makeshift tools. In 1960, when the Republic of Cyprus was declared, the guarantor country Turkish government sent instruments to the island that the Mujahideen Band needed through Cyprus Turkish Forces Regiment. In 1971, the Mujahideen Band took the name of the Cyprus Turkish Police Band, performing at many concerts under the name of &quot;Student Band&quot; due to the problems faced while crossing to the other districts. When Turkish Cypriots gained an independent state with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Security Forces Command was established on 1 August 1976 and the Police Band took the name of the Security Forces Command Band.

=== Czech Republic ===
The Czech Army Central Band is the primary unit of the Czech Land Forces responsible for providing musical support to the Army of the Czech Republic and the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic. The band is currently based in Prague where it fall under the Army Music Service of the Czech Armed Forces, which heads all bands in the CAF. There are two other bands in the CAF: Military Band Olomouc, Military Band Plzeň, Military Band Brno, Military Band Tábor and Military Band Hradec Králové. The latter descends from the former Band of the Czechoslovak Air Force (founded in 1949) and has since 1963 been working mainly in the East Bohemian Region. Many graduates of these bands come from the Prague Military Music School. Primarily, the band tradition in the republic stems from the Austro-Hungarian tradition, with latter influences from the United Kingdom and Russia. On 11 December 1918, it was decided to establish the first military band in the larger garrison towns.

=== Denmark ===

Danish military bands are known to have been influenced greatly by the traditional German and Swedish examples that it often surrounded itself with. The Royal Life Guards Music Band is the seniormost military band in the Danish Defence, performing at all national events, especially ones involving the Monarchy of Denmark, the Danish royal family and foreign dignitaries. The squad-sized Mounted band of the Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron, which consists of one Timpani and nine bugles, is the only mounted military band in the country and is used during processions and ceremonial escorts.

The Royal Danish Naval Academy sports the navy&#x27;s only military band, the Royal Danish Navy Band (Danish: Søværnets Tamburkorps), established in 1964 and composed of 24 cadets. The army also maintains several regimental and battalion bands such as the Slesvigske musikkorps, which are stationed at their home barracks.

=== Finland ===
Band formations in Finland have been heavily influenced by Russian, German and Swedish military traditions. Finnish military music has an over 400-year history which began in 1544 when King Gustav I of Sweden promoted the strengthening of musical structure in the Swedish-Finnish army. The first Finnish military bands were composed of pipers, drummers, cavalry buglers and kettle drummers who began to serve on the front lines in the Russo-Swedish War (1554–1557). Gustav&#x27;s son, John III, settled at Turku Castle after his father&#x27;s death, and created his own personal court band, whose first directors were the Dutch-born Jören van Heiden and Blasius Fischer. This provided the basis for modern military bands in Finland.

In the 1600s, a four-member band was added to the ranks of an army regiment on the basis of the Hautboist model in Europe. In the early 1700s, there was a period of repression of Finnish military music, which would only improve later on in the century. In the early 1800s, the last band to be founded in Swedish Finland was the Band of the Queen Dowager&#x27;s Life Guard Regiment in Pomerania. Bernhard Henrik Crusell, who was a musician in the and an internationally known Swedish instrumentalist, is known as the &quot;Father of Finnish military music&quot; and has &quot;Crusell&#x27;s March&quot;, named in his honor.

In the period of the Grand Duchy of Finland, a total of 23 military bands were in service, growing to 28 from 1812 to 1905. During this time, bands such as the Cavalry Band of the Dragoons Regiment and the Guards Band were founded. Army bands in independent Finland received their initial training at Korsholma Military Music School (now the Military Music School) near Vaasa. The Finnish Defence Forces sports 6 professional military bands with 180 musicians combined. The six professional Finnish military bands are the Kaartin Soittokunta, the Conscript Band of the Finnish Defence Forces, the Finnish Air Force Band, Finnish Navy Band, the Lapland Military Band, and the Dragoon Band. Lapland Military Band from Rovaniemi is the only professional wind orchestra in Northern Finland and is the northernmost military band in the European Union.

The Finnish Armed Forces also hosts and participates in the biannual Hamina Tattoo.

=== France ===

Since the 17th century, France has sported one of the oldest military band traditions in all of Western Europe, providing the Western world with a collection of French marches composed by eminent composers from the Ancien Régime, the Revolution, the Napoleonic era up to the present. The French Revolution brought many changes to music and military bands. As a result of the increase of musicians, military bands grew to sizes never seen before. The French National Guard had 45 musicians in 1789 and expanded to 70 in 1790. The band dissolved in 1792 but became the nucleus for the Paris Conservatory of Music. In 1827, all French bands were cut to 27 players at minimum due to economic reasons. While modern instrumentation somewhat mirrors those of British and American military bands, it is based on uniquely French military music traditions. These bands are led by a conductor and a drum major.

There are four types of military bands today in France: military marching bands (subdivided into marching and mounted brass bands), Corps of Drums (only in the Foreign Legion), Fanfare bands (attached to the marching band or as separate marching bands) and Pipe bands (more known in Brittany as the Bagad). Examples of these are the Marching, Fanfare, and Mounted Bands of the French Republican Guard, and the Central Band of the Foreign Legion, the only remaining French military band to use the fife. The French Army Cavalry and Armored Branch maintain mounted and dismounted fanfare bands featuring cavalry trumpets and bugles plus kettledrums and marching percussion. Another example is the band of the French Chasseurs Alpins (the band of the 27th Mountain Infantry Brigade (France)), which uses the Alphorns in displays. French Armed Forces bands are also of the headquarters element from the regimental or brigade level onward and can also provide musical elements for civil and military events. These bands are distinguished by their service dress uniforms. All army bands are part of the Army Music Command (CMAT). Outside of this framework, army bands include the Fanfare Bands of the 9th Marine Infantry Brigade and the 6th Engineer Regiment.

===Germany===
The military bands of Germany have two or more components depending on instrumentation. Military bands in Germany&#x27;s &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; today are only composed of a military band and a Corps of Drums. Another distinguishing features are the presence of the Turkish crescent in the military bands when they are on parade and the band&#x27;s conductor being assisted by a Drum major, as well as the inclusion of fanfare trumpeters. The military bands of Germany have also influenced the development of military bands throughout South America.

In types of ensemble, these bands are called as:

* Corps of Drums (&quot;Spielmannszug, Tambourkorps, Trommlerkorps&quot;)
* Military/Music/Marching Band (&quot;Musikkorps, Musikkapelle, Orchester&quot;)
* Drum and bugle corps (&quot;Bläserkorps&quot;)
* Brass bands (&quot;Blasorchester, Blaskapelle&quot;)
* Fanfare bands (&quot;Fanfarenzug, Fanfarenkorps&quot;)
* Mounted bands (&quot;Trompeterkorps, Kavalleriemusik, Kavallerieorchester, Fanfarenkavalleriekorps&quot;)

The bands of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; today are mainly composed of the band proper, Corps of Drums, and the occasional fanfare section, several bands have historical sections wearing period uniforms and playing either modern or classic instruments. Other such bands are led by Drum Majors, Conductors/Directors of Music, and Bugle Majors in the case of mounted, bugle, and fanfare bands.

During the Imperial era, such bands existed all over the German Empire, and later on during the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich (but the mounted bands were reduced to only a few by that time). The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; had maintained a considerable amount of military bands in its ranks. The &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; and the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; had also maintained bands, giving way for the SS lead the way for German musical units in Nazi Germany to be part of this paramilitary organization. By 1934, a musical unit had been set up in the &quot;1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot;, which was Germany&#x27;s most senior military band in the pre-war years. Professor Hans Felix Husadel, who was the &quot;Luftwaffenmusikinspizient&quot; of air force bands, was primarily responsible for the 1930s reorganization of bands in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, which was notable in its inclusion of the saxophone in 1935.

East Germany&#x27;s official band service was the Military Music Service of the National People&#x27;s Army (&quot;Nationale Volksarmee&quot;), organized into the same ensembles as in the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, as well as added ensembles based on Soviet influence.

=== Greece ===

Greek military bands have a long history that goes back since the country&#x27;s establishment in the early 19th century. When the Hellenic Army&#x27;s regular force was under the command of French Colonel Charles Fabvier, army culture was expanded into different areas, including the establishment of military music detachments for the first time. The Hellenic Armed Forces operates three musical units, including the Military Band of Athens, the Hellenic Air Force Band, and the Hellenic Naval Band

The Military Band of Athens, which is the seniormost military band in the army and the armed forces, has an over 190-year history. The band in its current form was established in 1856, and was the only professional musical band of the Greek State. All three bands partake in rendering honors and performing in military parades and concerts. Like the British Army, the Greek military also maintains unit bands at the regimental/brigade level to provide ceremonial support to these specific units.

===Hungary===
With the Hungarian Defense Forces Central Military Band (HDF Band) (&quot;Magyar Honvédség Központi Zenekar&quot;) being the official military band of the Hungarian Defence Forces, it represents the HDF on every occasion, including parades as well as ceremonies and has done this since its foundation in 1962. Military bands in Hungary have an over 120-year history dating back to the founding of the first military band in the capital of Budapest in the late 1890s. The central band also acts as the headquarters for all separate garrison bands.

===Italy===

Italy has a long tradition of military music. Today, within the Italian Armed Forces, Italian military bands (called in the Italian language as both either &quot;banda&quot; or &quot;fanfara&quot;) have an instrumentation order similar to British, French, and American military bands, although it retains the Italian musical flavor and heritage.

Mounted bands in the Italian Army, Carabineri and the Polizia di Stato formerly used only the bugle and the natural trumpet from the 16th century, up to the middle of the 20th century, from the late 19th century to now also they use brass, woodwinds, timpani, single tenor drums, snare drums, cymbals and glockenspiels.

=== Latvia ===

Latvia developed a tradition of having military bands right after it gained its independence from the Russian Empire in 1918. In February 1919, Captain Ludvigs Bolšteins of the newly formed Latvian Army ordered an infantry company to form a band composed of 11 volunteers in what was considered to be the first military band in independent Latvia. Beginning in 1940 and again following the end of the German occupation in 1944–45, the Red Army began stationing army bands on its territory. As the Soviet band tradition grew and progressed over the years, bands of the Baltic Military District stationed in the Latvian SSR were aligned towards the standard of the Bands of the Moscow Military District. Since 1991, the Central Military Band of the Latvian National Armed Forces (also known as the NAF Staff Band) has been the flagship ensemble of the national armed forces and has participated in every protocol events. Officially coming under the command of the Latvian National Armed Forces Staff Battalion, it mostly performs in the presence of a major public figure, such as the President of Latvia.

In addition to the Central Band of the Armed Forces, three other military bands are also associated with the NAF Staff Band and are on the National Armed Forces National Orchestral Board: They include the Central Band of the Latvian Land Forces, based in Daugavpils and mostly provides music for the Latgale; Central Band of the Latvian Navy, based in Liepāja; and the Central Band of the Latvian National Guard.

The Central Band of the Latvian National Guard is the newest band established by the Latvian Armed Forces. However, although it was officially founded in 2011, it actually succeeded a military band that was under the supervision of the National Guard and was active in the 1990s. At the time, it was simply under the command of an Ordnance Battalion of the National Armed Forces. At present, the National Guard Band sports a saxophone quartet, jazz ensemble, a choir, and a big band, which combined totals up to 40 musicians. The current conductor of the National Guard Band is Captain Andis Karelis and Major Viesturs Lazdins.

=== Luxembourg ===
The Musique militaire grand-ducale is the sole military band of the small country of Luxembourg, based in Conservatoire de Luxembourg. The band performs close to 50 concerts per year, mostly in Luxembourg City. The band is divided into a chamber orchestra, brass band, bugles and drums, an instrumental ensemble, as well as several quintets.

=== Netherlands ===
The Netherlands Armed Forces&#x27;s military music component is made up of eight military bands and two field music formations, which perform ceremonial duties and give concerts to the public, these bands are a hybrid of the German, British, Spanish and French band traditions. The Royal Military Band &quot;Johan Willem Friso&quot; is the main military band of the Netherlands, serving as the seniormost band of the entire armed forces. The band was formed in 1995 as a fusion of both the Royal Military Band of the Grenadier Guards Regiment, elements of the Brass Band of the Rifle Guards Regiment and the Band of the Johan Willem Friso Regiment and thus is the largest and oldest among all the bands. The other four bands are the National Reserve Korps Fanfare Orchestra, the Brass Band of the Royal Netherlands Army Regiment of Engineers, the Fanfare Orchestra of the RNA and Mounted Fanfare Band Section and the Garderegiment Grenadiers en Jagers Brass Band.

Five brigade bands were established during the restructuring of the Norwegian Armed Forces in 1817. Following World War II, military bands became popular among civilians and government officials, eventually leading to the Norwegian Parliament to give the green light for establishing over six bands in 1953.

The main military band in Poland is the Representative Central Band of the Polish Armed Forces which is part of the 1st Guards Battalion, Representative Honor Guard Regiment and has served the leadership of Poland since 1918. All service branches of the armed forces also have their own military band. The representative ensemble of the armed forces also maintains a full chamber orchestra attached to the unit. In addition to the central band, the three main service branches of the Polish military maintain their own representative bands.

The Representative Band of the Polish Air Force (&quot;Orkiestra Reprezentacyjna Polskich Sił Powietrznych&quot;) was established in 2002 following the merger of two military bands from Jelenia Góra and Oleśnica. The majority of band members are graduates of the former Military Music High School in Gdańsk, as well as graduates of Music Academies in Poland and abroad. It takes part in numerous festivals and tattoos in Western and Central Europe. In 2009, the Polish Air Force Band was the winner of the 44th annual Polish Armed Forces review of military bands. It is currently based with the 34th Air Defense Missile Squadron in Bytom and is placed under the command of Lieutenant Krystian Siwek.

The Representative Band of the Polish Land Forces (&quot;Orkiestra Reprezentacyjna Wojsk Lądowych&quot;) supports the everyday ceremonial activities of the Polish Land Forces from its headquarters in Wrocław. It was established in 1952 by order of Vladislav Korchits, who was the then chief of Polish General Staff. In over 50 years, the band was led by acclaimed Polish musicians such as Major Czesław Kęstowicz, Captain Franciszek Minta, and Major Mariusz Dziubek.

The Representative Band of the Navy of Poland (&quot;Orkiestra Reprezentacyjna Marynarki Wojennej Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej&quot;) serves the ceremonial and musical needs of the Polish Navy. The band was formed in 1920 in the city of Puck, which was the then headquarters of the Polish navy. It was transferred to Gdynia with other units in 1925 and has been based there ever since.

The history of the Representative Band of the Polish Border Guard (&quot;Orkiestra Reprezentacyjna Straży Granicznej&quot;) dates back to 1956 and is closely related to the history of the Carpathian Brigade of the Polish Army. It has performed its current functions as a military band since 1973 and has been based in Podhale since its founding. It is known as a perfect interpreter of symphonic, brass and classical music. The band prides itself on the over 10,000 concerts that it has performed over the years and the several prizes and awards it has been given by musical and government officials in Poland and abroad.

=== Portugal ===

Portugal has a long military music tradition. Military type bands exist not only in the Military forces, but also in security and emergency forces, with some influences from Spain, France and the United Kingdom.

The senior band of the Portuguese Armed Forces is the Army Symphonic Band (BSE), based in Lisbon and formed in 1988 by order of the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Mário Firmino Miguel. It is the heir to the oldest musical traditions of the Portuguese Army, historical predecessors of which include the Band of the 1st Infantry Regiment and the Band of the 5th &quot;Caçadores&quot; Battalion On 7 October 2005, it was awarded by the President Jorge Sampaio the Gold Medal of Distinguished Services. The Army also has four regional military bands, the Army Fanfare Band and three other fanfare bands. The Fanfare Brass Band of the Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade has the particularity of including bagpipes and its members being all qualified paratroopers. The youngest of the formations, it has been active since 1986.

The &quot;Banda da Armada&quot; (Navy Band) is the official band of the Portuguese Navy, dating back the 1740s when there was a band called &quot;Charamela&quot; in the Portuguese Royal Navy. The Navy also includes the &quot;Fanfarra da Armada&quot; (Fanfare Band of the Navy), a drum and bugle corps which is part of the Portuguese Marine Corps, with origins dating to the Royal Brigade and in existence since 1837. Both carry the long history of bands and field music in this branch.

The Portuguese Air Force Band was created on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1957, five years before the founding of the actual air force. Like the army band, it is a recipient of the Gold Medal of Distinguished Services, awarded in 1997.

Outside those bands, all of which are part of the main framework of the Portuguese military, the Symphonic Band of the National Republican Guard (GNR), the country&#x27;s gendarmerie force, serves as an official military band and serves as the official state band of the republic. The GNR also includes the Horse Brass Band (&quot;Charanga a Cavalo&quot;), which is the only mounted band in the world which plays while on the gallop.

=== Romania ===
The Military Music Service of the Romanian Armed Forces (&quot;Serviciul musical militar al Forțelor Armate Române&quot;) and the Military Music Inspectorate (&quot;Inspectoratul Muzicilor Militare&quot;) are the principal military band departments in Ministry of National Defense of Romania. It is responsible for the organization and instruction of military bands in the armed forces. It is currently housed at a military base on 13 Iuliu Maniu Boulevard, Bucharest. July 1 is considered to be the &quot;Day of Military Music&quot; (&quot;Ziua muzicilor militare&quot;), which is observed as a professional holiday.

In 1864, it became a special section in the Ministry of War, which controlled its subordinate military bands and music schools. The section became the basis for the subsequent establishment of the Military Music Inspectorate in 1867, which had Captain Eduard Hübsch being the first commander. In the nearly 30 years since Hübsch was the inspector of the military music, the special regulations for the bands of the band were elaborated and the military musicians were given a new status in the army. On May 26, 1895, inspector general Ion Ivanovici (the author of the most famous Romanian waltzes &quot;Waves of the Danube&quot;) endowed the inspectorate with new instruments, introduced a valuable and diverse repertoire, while supporting the training of future military instrumentalists. On October 10, 1936, the Military Music School was established and was designed to ensure the training military music staff. In the middle of June in 1954, the representative military bands of each service branch of the Romanian People&#x27;s Army were formed. The current inspector general of the military music service is Colonel Valentin Neacsu, who has served in this position since October 11, 2007, succeeding Colonel Ionel Croitoru.

The Romanian Armed Forces maintains a central band for its respective service branches. They include the Representative Central Band of the Romanian Army, the Representative Central Band of the Romanian Air Force, and the Representative Central Band of the Romanian Navy. In addition to centralized bands, the Romanian Armed Forces also maintains several other bands, which include the Regimental Band of the Michael the Brave 30th Guards Brigade, the &quot;Doina Armatei&quot; Folk Band, and the bands for the Military Training Center for Music, and the Military Music School. All the bands follow a mix of the Russian, French, British and German traditions with field snare drums on the front rank occasionally when in massed bands formation, during the period of the Socialist Republic of Romania a typical massed bands formation on national holidays in Bucharest (until 1989) sported bugles and chromatic fanfare trumpets following the Russian practice at the front rank in front of the percussion.

=== Russia ===
Starting in the late 17th century with the birth of the regular Russian armed services, each unit of the Imperial army and navy formed their own bands using regular enlisted personnel and NCOs and led by officers as directors of music and bandmasters. This tradition stayed even in the Soviet era, and one of the finest band conductors of that era was Major General Semyon Tchernetsky, who founded and became the first director of music of the Central Band of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union from 1927 to 1951. Indeed, Russia has a long tradition of military bands and so many military marches have been composed by various composers throughout the years. These bands were modeled after the German military bands, with the addition of the chromatic fanfare trumpet. Some but not all Russian marches then were made in Germany and other locations as the rest were locally composed military marches. They would usually have a conductor, and a drum major using his mace with/or a bugle major playing the chromatic fanfare trumpet. Brass instruments formed the first tier of the formation followed by the percussion and the woodwinds. Mounted cavalry bands were similar to German ones but were different in many aspects.

Military bands (also loosely translated to &quot;Военный оркестр&quot;, which means &quot;Military Orchestra&quot;) when massed would add field drums and fanfare trumpets to the ensemble for large parades and state ceremonies. The formation used by these massed bands mirror today&#x27;s formations.

By the time that the Soviet Armed Forces came into being in 1918, military bands began to change for the better. With the establishment of the Central Military Band by Semyon Chernetsky in 1927 came the birth of today&#x27;s Russian and ex-Soviet Union military band culture. In the late 1920s and the 1930s the typical Soviet Massed military bands that perform on May 1, November 7 and from 1945 onward, May 9, would be composed of a Military band and a Corps of Drums marching past and until the 1970s would later join the military band in place.

Soviet massed military bands in the 1930s and 1940s tend to have a drum major, a conductor, and an optional two to three deputy conductors in the front of the band. Mounted bands had the same formation, but with only a director of music and the optionally mounted band drum major, only a few bands sported woodwinds. The Soviet military bands of the pre-war days played not only on May Day and Revolution Day but in the National Sports Day parades at the Red Square, the various sports competitions, and other occasions, and after the Second World War, at Victory Day celebrations across the USSR. In the 1930s, the Turkish crescent holders were shaking during the sports parades, but in the 1940s, they were not shaking them. Their formation mirrored those used by Russian military bands in the Imperial era.

By the 1950s, Soviet military bands evolved in instrumentation. Their positioning, especially in the Moscow bands, changed for the better as newly composed Soviet military marches soon created the Soviet military band sound common to Westerners during the Cold War days. A conductor and one to four drum majors and several bandmasters led the massed military bands of the Soviet Union in Moscow, Leningrad and republican capital cities into a new decade of progress for Soviet military music as many new compositions entered the song-list of marches played during state parades. The reform of the bands begun in 1948-1949 under the assistant director of the band service, Major General Ivan Petrov, and continued on until the 1970s. Bands from the Moscow Military District took part in the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1980 Summer Olympics, which was the international television debut of Soviet military bands, broadcast to numerous countries around the world.

Today, military bands in the Russian Federation are also of the headquarters element from the regimental level onward, and also provide musical support to the different units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Federal Protective Service, the Federal Security Service and the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The military bands here also provide musical support in civil and military events, in a wide range of groups and ensembles. Some can even continue the old Russian military band traditions by donning the old imperial military uniforms of the Russian Empire, especially the uniforms of the bands. Examples of such are the Central Band of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, the Exemplary Band of the Moscow Garrison Guard of Honor, the St. Petersburg Admiralty Band, the Central Band of the Western Military District and the Presidential Band from the Kremlin Regiment.

===Serbia===
The first military band in Serbia was founded in 1831 by decree of Prince Miloš Obrenović under the title of &quot;Knjaževsko–Serbska Banda&quot;. This band served the then-Royal Serbian Army and is the ancestor to the modern Band of the Guard as the official ceremonial band of the Serbian Armed Forces. The Royal Yugoslav Army and the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army have also maintained military bands in their ranks throughout the 20th century, with the former having a band in its Royal Guard. There was also a Military School of Music in the early 1900s. Military bands also include the Niš and Binički Bands of the Serbian Army.

All bands follow the Austrian practice with added Russian and Turkish influences.

===Spain===
Military bands in Spain are of very long-standing. There are reports of primitive bands dating from the Celtiberian tribal and Roman periods. However military music in the modern sense began with the expansion of the Spanish Empire between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, during the numerous Spanish military campaigns in Europe and the wider world when the first bands were formed in the Tercios of the Spanish Army, equipped with fifes and drums and later with wind instruments of the period formed under a drum major. The influence of Spanish military marching bands is very important, especially in Latin America and the Philippines. The characteristic marches are the &quot;touch&quot; of trumpets, bugles and cors de chasse, and the steady rhythm of the percussion section, with contrasting festive spirit and martial beats. In the 19th century, the light infantry of the Army adopted a militarized form of the civil Charanga tradition of southeastern and northern Spain, a tradition the Spanish Navy would adopt for naval units and ship&#x27;s company bands.

Band formations in the Spanish Armed Forces, all under the Band Corps within the Common Corps, follow the British model, but Spanish bands tend to have the most senior bandsmen or bandsman, playing a tuba, positioned at the head of the band or at the second line. The tubaist is usually the band sergeant major or the band corporal, mostly stationed in between the trombone players or leading a file of tuba and euphonium players in some bands. Bugle bands are part of the Spanish musical tradition since the 19th century when the bugle replaced the fife in the Spanish Army and Navy, and these bands consist of drummers and buglers (or trumpeters in the cavalry dismounted bands since the 20th century). Such formations, when massed together, are led by a Director of Music and a Drum Major (with a Bugle Major or a Trumpet Major depending on the specialty arm). The century-old Corps of Drums of the Regulares is led by a Drum Major and a Bugle Major with personnel playing the snare, bass, and single tenor drums, bugles, North African flutes and sometimes bagpipes, and the Spanish Royal Guard (as well as the 1st King&#x27;s Immemorial Infantry Regiment of AHQ) sport Corps of Drums playing drums and fifes and wearing 18th-century uniforms. Plain bugles, by tradition, are used in the bugle bands of the Spanish Legion and the Paratrooper Brigade instead of the valved bugles used by other bands and the trumpets and bass drum used by the Royal Guards. Within units based in Galicia and Asturias, military pipe bands are in service as well. Only the Civil Guard and the Royal Guard retain mounted bands with cavalry trumpeters, both of which also having mounted kettledrummers.

Today, there are 26 bands or &quot;Music Units&quot; (&quot;Unidad de Música&quot;) whose members belong to the Band Corps. They are divided as follows: 15 of them in the Army, 5 in the Navy, and the rest in the Air Force. Their areas of operations include: Andalucía, Aragon, Canarias, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla y León, Ceuta, Comunidad Valenciana, Galicia, Madrid, Melilla, and Murcia. A school of music is based in the Carabanchel district of south western Madrid as part of the Central Defence Academy with the purpose of training individuals in the Band Corps.

===Sweden===

Traditionally, every Swedish regiment had a band. During the 20th century, many of them were disbanded and in 1957 all remaining military bands were merged into one per garrison or disbanded entirely. The Swedish military music was made into a non-military organization in 1971 but this proving unsuccessful, the Royal Swedish Army Band was set up in 1982, followed by several other bands in the 1990s. As of 2010 the Swedish Armed Forces no longer have conscripts, but professional soldiers. The military musicians in the Swedish Armed Forces Music are now professional musicians with civil ranks (CR-1/8) or professional soldiers with military ranks (OR-1/5). Today, Swedish military music has undergone new cuts, retaining two bands only in the army and one in the navy and only a single field music formation. In addition, there are 25 bands in the Swedish Home Guard, all of which are under the command of the Hemvärnsmusiken.

Formations in these bands are a mix of the Italian, German and British band traditions. The current active bands of the Swedish Armed Forces includes the Royal Swedish Army Band, and the Life Guards&#x27; Dragoon Music Corps, both of which are based in Stockholm; and the Royal Swedish Navy Band, based in Karlskrona. All three report to the Swedish Armed Forces Music Corps.

===Switzerland===

The Swiss Army Central Band is the main military band in the landlocked confederation. It is based on mostly German and French, but also Italian and British influences. It serves as the Swiss Armed Force&#x27;s sole ceremonial ambassador as the military does not have a permanent ceremonial (guards of honour are mounted by regular units). Despite having affiliations with the military, as well as its 18th century uniforms and precision drill, the civilian Top Secret Drum Corps is not a Swiss military band. The Military Music Competence Center (&quot;Kompetenzzentrum Militärmusik&quot;) is an organizational unit which specializes in the training of military musicians for service.

Also in service is the Conscript Band of the Swiss Army, which is manned by musician conscripts serving their national service term in the Armed Forces. Other bands include the Swiss Army Strings, the Swiss Army Big Band, Swiss Army Brass Band, the Swiss Military Small Band and the Swiss Army Concert Band. The Swiss Military Small Band is composed of musicians from the Brass Band Recruit School who finished an 18-week basic training in May 2018.

=== Ukraine ===
Military bands in Ukraine are subordinated to the Military Music Department of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The following bands that form part of this department can be categorized into the following: band centers, academy bands and unit bands. The three seniormost bands in the Ukrainian Armed Forces are the National Exemplary Band of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and National Presidential Band of Ukraine and the Band of the Kyiv Presidential Honor Guard Battalion. The National Exemplary Band is the largest in the armed forces, employing over 100 musicians. There is a quota for the number of musicians different bands, with the headquarters bands of music centers of each armed service branch employing 52 members, and academic bands employing 21 members.
The Military Band Service of the National Guard of Ukraine consists of the Central Band of the National Guard of Ukraine, the Band of the National Guard Military Academy of Ukraine, the Band of the NGU National Honor Guard Battalion Kyiv and the Band of the National Guard NCO Training School. Ukrainian massed bands are known for their unconventional use of stationary instruments such as the Timpani and tubular bells. Since the Russian Army annexed Crimea in 2014 followed by the Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukrainian military bands have been ordered to orient their marching styles, as well as their drum majors to military bands in the European Union and NATO armed services.

In May 2016, soldiers from the Band of the 44th Artillery Brigade in Ternopil performed &quot;Shche ne vmerla Ukraina&quot; nearly 300 metres underground, breaking a world record. The Band of the 194th Pontoon-Bridge Regiment of the State Special Transport Service (established in October 2001) also serves as a military band despite it not being part of the armed forces.

=== United Kingdom ===
Since later medieval times and the formation of the first bands, the United Kingdom has had a strong military band tradition. In 1993, Richard Morrison, the chief music critic of &quot;The Times&quot; noted: &quot;One of the oddest statistics about British cultural life is that the Defence Ministry spends more to maintain military bands than the government spends on all the professional orchestras and opera companies in the country.&quot; The oldest military band in the British Armed Forces is the Royal Artillery Band. This can trace its origins back to 1557 at the Battle of St. Quentin, although it was not made &#x27;official&#x27; until 1762. A series of army reviews starting in 1994 reduced the number of British Army bands from 69 to 22 and the number of personnel from 2,000 to 1,100.

All regular bands in the British Army are part of the Royal Corps of Army Music and there are currently 22 in service. They range in personnel number from 64 to 15 and include: traditional marching, mounted and concert bands, as well as rock bands and a small string orchestra. The bands of the Royal Corps of Army Music are:

* The Band of The Household Cavalry - Hyde Park Barracks, London and Combermere Barracks Windsor
* The Band of the Royal Armoured Corps - Catterick, North Yorkshire
* The Royal Artillery Band - Tidworth
* The Band of the Corps of Royal Engineers - Chatham, Kent

The British Army also has 20 reserve military bands located across the United Kingdom and Gibraltar:
* Band of the Honourable Artillery Company
* Regimental Band (Inns of Court &amp; City Yeomanry) of the Royal Yeomanry
* Lancashire Artillery Volunteers Band
* The Nottinghamshire Band of the Royal Engineers
* The (Northern) Band of the Royal Corps of Signals
*Lowland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland

* Band of the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment (Queen&#x27;s and Royal Hampshires)
* Band of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers
* Band of the Royal Anglian Regiment
* Volunteer Band of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment
* Band of The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)
* Band of the Royal Welsh - The only Brass Band in the Reserve Army
* Band of the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (King&#x27;s Lancashire and Border)

* Band of the Army Medical Services
The Royal Marines Band Service is, since 1950 and the disbandment of the Fleet Divisional Bands, the only remaining musical wing of the Royal Navy in service. It currently consists of six bands. Without doubt, groups of musicians existed in the service before 1767, when Royal Marines Divisional Bands were formed at the naval dockyard-bases of Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth and the naval gathering-point of Deal in the Downs, and marine bands (along with professional bands paid for by captains) plus their respective corps of drums provided music aboard ships before and during battles of the Napoleonic Wars (e.g. during the long sail into action at the Battle of Trafalgar).

At present, there are a total of five Royal Marine Bands and a Corps of Drums:

*Band of HM Royal Marines, Portsmouth (HMS &quot;Nelson&quot;)
*Band of HM Royal Marines, Plymouth (HMS Raleigh)
*Band of HM Royal Marines, Scotland (HMS Caledonia, Rosyth)
*Band of HM Royal Marines, HMS Collingwood (replacing the Band of Britannia Royal Naval College)
*Band of HM Royal Marines, Commando Training Centre Royal Marines

The band of the Royal Marines School of Music in Portsmouth (The Training Band) brings the total number to six.

The Royal Air Force Music Services is the organisation which provides military musical support to the Royal Air Force. Based at RAF Northolt (previously at RAF Uxbridge) and RAF Cranwell, it forms the central administration of one hundred and seventy musicians divided between the Central Band of the Royal Air Force, The Band of the Royal Air Force College, The Band of the Royal Air Force Regiment and Headquarters Music Services. These main military bands contain within their ranks the Royal Air Force Squadronnaires, Royal Air Force Swing Wing, Royal Air Force Shades of Blue, and The Salon Orchestra of the Central Band of the Royal Air Force.

In the United Kingdom, the Mounted Band of the Household Cavalry and the Massed Bands of the Household Division perform at Trooping the Colour, an annual ceremony held every June on Horse Guards Parade to mark the official King&#x27;s Birthday celebrations. The Massed Bands and the Mounted Band play a central role in this ceremony. The term &quot;Massed Bands&quot; denotes the formation of more than one separate band performing together, whether belonging to one or more regiments, or indeed countries.

====Armed Forces Reserve, civil, and youth military marching bands====

The various volunteer reserve bands in the British Armed Forces&#x27; three services mirror those of the regular forces bands, as well as civil military-styled marching bands (for example, The Royal British Legion, which maintains its own bands).

The various youth military uniformed services of the United Kingdom have their own bands using the very same formations mentioned earlier:

* The Army Cadet Force bands, as well as the air cadet organisation bands in the United Kingdom which are under the banner of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets, use the general formation used by the British Army and the RAF, but several RAF Air Cadet bands have drums at the front similar to the Royal Marines
* The RM/DYRMS formation is standard practice for Sea Cadets (United Kingdom), Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps, and the Combined Cadet Force bands.

Uniformed organization-based and civil Corps of Drums mostly follow the format by most army regiments while those with links to the light infantry do not use fifes at all. In the case of those that are part of the Sea Cadets and the RMVCC, they follow the RM (and former RN) Corps of Drums traditions, adding glockenspiels and in some bands wind and brass instruments.

British style brass bands have the same positioning as the British Army brass bands as they are composed of only brass instruments, saxhorns and percussion. The same applies to carnival band formations, though these have the option to include woodwinds.

==Military bands of Oceania==
=== Australia ===

British military bands have served in the Australian colonies since their arrival in 1788 all the way up to 1870. During this period, the bands came from visiting British and non-British naval ships. These bands include the Band of the New South Wales Corps and the Band of the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot. With the formation of the Regular Army in 1947, military bands were raised in each of the five commands and by 1955, there were 12 army bands. The seniormost of these bands was the Northern Command Band from Townsville. The RAAF Band was the first to take up the concert band format reflected local community bands at this time. At one point, the Australian Broadcasting Commission maintained its own military band. Branded as the ABC Military Band, it was formed in October 1933 and comprised 40 players from all Australian States, playing a concerts during the war to raise funds for Australian soldiers. It was disbanded in September 1951 due to low funding.

Military bands of the Australian Defence Force, and their formations on ceremonies and parades, are derived from those of the United Kingdom, with each service – Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force – having their own approach, based on the service military bands in the UK. For example, the Royal Australian Navy Band marches with drums at the front, whereas the bands of the other service branches have their trombone section at the front. The instrumentation also varies from band to band, as does the size of the ensemble.

The Royal Australian Navy Band maintains two sections of musicians, one based in Sydney and one near Melbourne (at H.M.A.S. Cerberus). Australian Army Band Corps has full-time bands based in Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Sydney, Brisbane, and Townsville, as well as part-time (Reserve) bands in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Sydney, Newcastle, Hobart, and Darwin. There are also many Reserve pipes and drums bands attached to various units. The Royal Australian Air Force Band consists of a single 43 piece band based in Melbourne. The bands of all three services perform at ceremonial functions, such as Commemoration ceremonies and ANZAC Day marches, in addition to providing music capability for their respective services.

=== Fiji ===

The Republic of Fiji Military Forces sports only one military band, the Fiji Military Forces Band. The perform in the RFMF&#x27;s ceremonial dress uniform, which consists of a red uniform with a traditional Fijian Sulu, which is also worn by the country&#x27;s Presidential Palace Guards. The RFMF Band&#x27;s formation is similar to their British counterparts, particularly the Royal Marines Band Service, which has its drum section at the front of the formation.

=== New Zealand ===
Military bands in New Zealand derive their formations from other Commonwealth and United States bands. They originated during the early 1840s, at the beginning of British rule. Since then, military bands have supported British and later New Zealand military events and commemorations. Before 1910, New Zealand military bands were attached to volunteer force units, with few regulations about the structure of bands.

In 1964, the number of army bands was reduced to seven, with the intention that the New Zealand Army Band replace the smaller part-time units with a central band. In 2012, nine of the then existing twelve New Zealand military bands were disbanded for reasons of economy. A single full-time band is now retained for each of the three armed services making up the New Zealand Defence Force: the New Zealand Army Band, the Royal New Zealand Air Force Band, and the Royal New Zealand Navy Band.
Although the New Zealand Defence Force now formally maintains only these three military band services, there is also one (that of the Royal New Zealand Artillery) which survives as a voluntary unit separate from the regular armed services. As of 2024, this Auckland-based Band of the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery is the oldest surviving military band in the country, having been founded in 1864.

=== Papua New Guinea ===
The Papua New Guinea Defence Force raised a platoon-sized military band in 2016, with the assistance of music personnel from Japan. The PNGDF Band traces its traditions and practices back to formations in other Commonwealth bands, specifically its former rulers, the United Kingdom and Australia; the latter of which Papua New Guinea was a former administrative territory of. Up until 1975, the Australian Army Band Corps, as well as other military bands of the Australian Defence Force provided musical support for the Royal Pacific Islands Regiment, which is still based on the island to this day.

==International military bands==
Some military bands fall under the command of a certain political or military organization such as NATO or the European Union. Other military bands belong to a certain country however recruit most of its members from foreign countries in its area of responsibility (such as the United States Naval Forces Europe Band).

===NATO===

The SHAPE International Band is the official military band for the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) of NATO. Officially, it is based out of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium and functions as a public relations unit that represents the SACEUR and NATO as a whole. Although being mostly composed of musicians of the United States Armed Forces, it also consists of musicians from other countries in the alliance.

===NORAD===
The North American Air Defense (NORAD) Command Band was a military band sponsored by the United States Air Force and was composed of members from the US Army, Navy, and Air Force as well as the Royal Canadian Air Force. It was created in 1959 and operated as a 90-member touring orchestra. Notable members include Scottish-Canadian musician Bobby Herriot. In 1991, the band was re-designated as &quot;America&#x27;s Band in Blue&quot; before being merged with the 15th Air Force Band of the Golden West in 1994, providing the premise for what is today the United States Air Force Band of the Golden West.

==IMMS==
The International Military Music Society (IMMS) is a public organization based in the United Kingdom that is dedicated to encourage interest in military bands, their activities and history internationally. The society has branches and members in 38 countries.

<text>In elementary algebra, completing the square is a technique for converting a quadratic polynomial of the form to the form for some values of and . In terms of a new quantity , this expression is a quadratic polynomial with no linear term. By subsequently isolating and taking the square root, a quadratic problem can be reduced to a linear problem.

The name &quot;completing the square&quot; comes from a geometrical picture in which represents an unknown length. Then the quantity represents the area of a square of side and the quantity represents the area of a pair of congruent rectangles with sides and . To this square and pair of rectangles one more square is added, of side length . This crucial step &quot;completes&quot; a larger square of side length .

Completing the square is the oldest method of solving general quadratic equations, used in Old Babylonian clay tablets dating from 1800–1600 BCE, and is still taught in elementary algebra courses today. It is also used for graphing quadratic functions, deriving the quadratic formula, and more generally in computations involving quadratic polynomials, for example in calculus evaluating Gaussian integrals with a linear term in the exponent, and finding Laplace transforms.

== History ==

The technique of completing the square was known in the Old Babylonian Empire.

Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi, a famous polymath who wrote the early algebraic treatise Al-Jabr, used the technique of completing the square to solve quadratic equations.

==Overview==

===Background===
The formula in elementary algebra for computing the square of a binomial is:
formula_1

For example:
formula_2

In any perfect square, the coefficient of &quot;x&quot; is twice the number &quot;p&quot;, and the constant term is equal to &quot;p&quot;2.

===Basic example===
Consider the following quadratic polynomial:
formula_3

This quadratic is not a perfect square, since 28 is not the square of 5:
formula_4

However, it is possible to write the original quadratic as the sum of this square and a constant:
formula_5

This is called completing the square.

===General description===
Given any monic quadratic
formula_6
it is possible to form a square that has the same first two terms:
formula_7

This square differs from the original quadratic only in the value of the constant
term. Therefore, we can write
formula_8
where formula_9. This operation is known as completing the square.
For example:
formula_10

===Non-monic case===
Given a quadratic polynomial of the form
formula_11
it is possible to factor out the coefficient &quot;a&quot;, and then complete the square for the resulting monic polynomial.

Example:
formula_12
This process of factoring out the coefficient &quot;a&quot; can further be simplified by only factorising it out of the first 2 terms. The integer at the end of the polynomial does not have to be included.

Example:
formula_13

This allows the writing of any quadratic polynomial in the form
formula_14

===Formula===
====Scalar case====
The result of completing the square may be written as a formula. In the general case, one has
formula_15
with
formula_16

In particular, when , one has
formula_17
with
formula_18

By solving the equation formula_19 in terms of formula_20 and reorganizing the resulting expression, one gets the quadratic formula for the roots of the quadratic equation:
formula_21

====Matrix case====
The matrix case looks very similar:
formula_22
where formula_23 and formula_24. Note that formula_25 has to be symmetric.

If formula_25 is not symmetric the formulae for formula_27 and formula_28 have to be generalized to:
formula_29

==Relation to the graph==

In analytic geometry, the graph of any quadratic function is a parabola in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane. Given a quadratic polynomial of the form
formula_30
the numbers &quot;h&quot; and &quot;k&quot; may be interpreted as the Cartesian coordinates of the vertex (or stationary point) of the parabola. That is, &quot;h&quot; is the &quot;x&quot;-coordinate of the axis of symmetry (i.e. the axis of symmetry has equation &quot;x = h&quot;), and &quot;k&quot; is the minimum value (or maximum value, if &quot;a&quot; &lt; 0) of the quadratic function.

One way to see this is to note that the graph of the function is a parabola whose vertex is at the origin (0, 0). Therefore, the graph of the function is a parabola shifted to the right by &quot;h&quot; whose vertex is at (&quot;h&quot;, 0), as shown in the top figure. In contrast, the graph of the function is a parabola shifted upward by whose vertex is at , as shown in the center figure. Combining both horizontal and vertical shifts yields is a parabola shifted to the right by and upward by whose vertex is at , as shown in the bottom figure.

==Solving quadratic equations==
Completing the square may be used to solve any quadratic equation. For example:
formula_31

The first step is to complete the square:
formula_32

Next we solve for the squared term:
formula_33

Then either
formula_34
and therefore
formula_35

This can be applied to any quadratic equation. When the &quot;x&quot;2 has a coefficient other than 1, the first step is to divide out the equation by this coefficient: for an example see the non-monic case below.

===Irrational and complex roots===
Unlike methods involving factoring the equation, which is reliable only if the roots are rational, completing the square will find the roots of a quadratic equation even when those roots are irrational or complex. For example, consider the equation
formula_36

Completing the square gives
formula_37
so
formula_38
Then either
formula_39

In terser language:
formula_40
so
formula_41

Equations with complex roots can be handled in the same way. For example:
formula_42

===Non-monic case===
For an equation involving a non-monic quadratic, the first step to solving them is to divide through by the coefficient of &quot;x&quot;2. For example:

formula_43

Applying this procedure to the general form of a quadratic equation leads to the quadratic formula.

==Other applications==

===Integration===
Completing the square may be used to evaluate any integral of the form
formula_44
using the basic integrals
formula_45

For example, consider the integral
formula_46

Completing the square in the denominator gives:
formula_47

This can now be evaluated by using the substitution
&quot;u&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + 3, which yields
formula_48

===Complex numbers===
Consider the expression
formula_49
where &quot;z&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are complex numbers, &quot;z&quot;* and &quot;b&quot;* are the complex conjugates of &quot;z&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, respectively, and &quot;c&quot; is a real number. Using the identity |&quot;u&quot;|2 = &quot;uu&quot;* we can rewrite this as
formula_50
which is clearly a real quantity. This is because
formula_51

As another example, the expression
formula_52
where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; are real numbers, with &quot;a&quot; &gt; 0 and &quot;b&quot; &gt; 0, may be expressed in terms of the square of the absolute value of a complex number. Define
formula_53

Then
formula_54
so
formula_55

===Idempotent matrix===
A matrix &quot;M&quot; is idempotent when &quot;M&quot;2 = &quot;M&quot;. Idempotent matrices generalize the idempotent properties of 0 and 1. The completion of the square method of addressing the equation 
formula_56
shows that some idempotent 2×2 matrices are parametrized by a circle in the (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;)-plane:

The matrix formula_57 will be idempotent provided formula_58 which, upon completing the square, becomes
formula_59
In the (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;)-plane, this is the equation of a circle with center (1/2, 0) and radius 1/2.

==Geometric perspective==

Consider completing the square for the equation
formula_60

Since &quot;x&quot;2 represents the area of a square with side of length &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;bx&quot; represents the area of a rectangle with sides &quot;b&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, the process of completing the square can be viewed as visual manipulation of rectangles.

Simple attempts to combine the &quot;x&quot;2 and the &quot;bx&quot; rectangles into a larger square result in a missing corner. The term (&quot;b&quot;/2)2 added to each side of the above equation is precisely the area of the missing corner, whence derives the terminology &quot;completing the square&quot;.

==A variation on the technique==
As conventionally taught, completing the square consists of adding the third term, &quot;v&quot; to
formula_61
to get a square. There are also cases in which one can add the middle term, either 2&quot;uv&quot; or −2&quot;uv&quot;, to
formula_62
to get a square.

===Example: the sum of a positive number and its reciprocal===
By writing
formula_63
we show that the sum of a positive number &quot;x&quot; and its reciprocal is always greater than or equal to 2. The square of a real expression is always greater than or equal to zero, which gives the stated bound; and here we achieve 2 just when &quot;x&quot; is 1, causing the square to vanish.

===Example: factoring a simple quartic polynomial===
Consider the problem of factoring the polynomial
formula_64

This is
formula_65
so the middle term is 2(&quot;x&quot;2)(18) = 36&quot;x&quot;2. Thus we get
formula_66
(the last line being added merely to follow the convention of decreasing degrees of terms).

The same argument shows that formula_67 is always factorizable as 
formula_68
(Also known as Sophie Germain&#x27;s identity).

==Completing the cube==

&quot;Completing the square&quot; consists to remark that the two first terms of a quadratic polynomial are also the first terms of the square of a linear polynomial, and to use this for expressing the quadratic polynomial as the sum of a square and a constant. 

Completing the cube is a similar technique that allows to transform a cubic polynomial into a cubic polynomial without term of degree two.

More precisely, if 
:formula_69
is a polynomial in such that formula_70 its two first terms are the two first terms of the expanded form of 
:formula_71

So, the change of variable
:formula_72
provides a cubic polynomial in formula_73 without term of degree two, which is called the depressed form of the original polynomial.

This transformation is generally the first step of the methods for solving the general cubic equation.

More generally, a similar transformation can be used for removing terms of degree formula_74 in polynomials of degree formula_75, which is called Tschirnhaus transformation.

<doc id="303501" wikidata="Q1928801" url="?curid=303501" title="Focal-plane shutter">
<text>In camera design, a focal-plane shutter (FPS) is a type of photographic shutter that is positioned immediately in front of the focal plane of the camera, that is, right in front of the photographic film or image sensor.

== Two-curtain shutters ==
The traditional type of focal-plane shutter in 35 mm cameras, pioneered by Leitz for use in its Leica cameras, uses two shutter curtains, made of opaque rubberised fabric, that run horizontally across the film plane. For slower shutter speeds, the first curtain opens (usually) from right to left, and after the required time with the shutter open, the second curtain closes the aperture in the same direction. When the shutter is cocked again the shutter curtains are moved back to their starting positions, ready to be released.

===Focal-plane shutter at low speed===

&quot;Figure 1:&quot; The black rectangle represents the frame aperture through which the exposure is made. It is currently covered by the first shutter curtain, shown in red. The second shutter curtain shown in green is on the right side.

&quot;Figure 2:&quot; The first shutter curtain moves fully to the left allowing the exposure to be made. At this point, the flash is made to fire if one is attached and ready to do so.

&quot;Figure 3:&quot; After the required amount of exposure the second shutter curtain moves to the left to cover the frame aperture. When the shutter is recocked the shutter curtains are wound back to the right-hand side ready for the next exposure.

This is a graphical representation only; the actual mechanisms are much more complex. For example, the shutter curtains actually roll on and off spools at either side of the frame aperture so as to use as little space as possible.

Faster shutter speeds are achieved by the second curtain closing before the first one has fully opened; this results in a vertical slit that travels horizontally across the film. Faster shutter speeds simply require a narrower slit, as the speed of travel of the shutter curtains is not normally varied.

===Focal-plane shutter at high speed===

&quot;Figure 1:&quot; The black rectangle represents the frame aperture through which the exposure is made. It is currently covered by the first shutter curtain, shown in red. The second shutter curtain shown in green is on the right side.

&quot;Figure 2:&quot; The first shutter curtain begins to move to the left allowing the exposure to be made. Because the exposure requires a very fast shutter speed, the second curtain begins to move across at a set distance from the first one.

&quot;Figure 3:&quot; The first shutter curtain continues to travel across the frame aperture followed by the second curtain. It would be pointless to use an electronic flash with this shutter speed as the short duration flash would expose only a very small amount of the frame as the rest is covered by either the first or second shutter curtain.

&quot;Figure 4:&quot; The first shutter curtain finishes moving, followed closely by the second curtain which is now covering the frame aperture completely. When the shutter is recocked both shutter curtains are wound back to the right-hand side ready for the next exposure.

== Vertical-travel shutters ==
Most modern 35 mm and digital SLR cameras now use vertical travel metal blade shutters. These work in the same way as the horizontal shutters, with a shorter distance for the shutter blades to travel, only 24 mm as opposed to 36 mm.

== Features ==
Focal-plane shutters can be built into the body of a camera that accepts interchangeable lenses, eliminating the need for each lens to have a central shutter built into it. Their fastest speeds are either 1/4000 second, 1/8000 second, or 1/12000 second; much higher than the 1/500 second of the typical leaf shutter.

While the concept of a travelling slit shutter is simple, a modern FP shutter is a computerised microsecond accurate timer, governing sub-gram masses of exotic materials, subjected to hundreds of gs acceleration, moving with micron precision, choreographed with other camera systems for 100,000+ cycles. This is why FP shutters are seldom seen in compact or point-and-shoot cameras. In addition, the typical focal-plane shutter has flash synchronization speeds that are slower than the typical leaf shutter&#x27;s 1/500 s, because the first curtain has to open fully and the second curtain must not start to close until the flash has fired. In other words, the very narrow slits of fast speeds will not be properly flash exposed.

The fastest X-sync speed on a 35 mm camera is traditionally 1/60 s for horizontal Leica-type FP shutters and 1/125 s for vertical Square-type FP shutters.

=== Rolling shutter ===

Focal-plane shutters may also produce image distortion of very fast-moving objects or when panned rapidly, as described in the &quot;Rolling shutter&quot; article. A large relative difference between a slow wipe speed and a narrow curtain slit results in distortion because one side of the frame is exposed at a noticeably later instant than the other and the object&#x27;s interim movement is imaged.

For a horizontal Leica-type FP shutter, the image is stretched if the object moves in the same direction as the shutter curtains, and compressed if travelling in the opposite direction of them. For a downward-firing vertical Square-type FP shutter, the top of the image leans forward. The use of leaning to give the impression of speed in illustration is a caricature of the distortion caused by the slow-wiping vertical FP shutters of large format cameras from the first half of the 20th century.

== Electro-optical shutters ==

Instead of using relatively slow-moving mechanical shutter curtains, electro-optic devices such as Pockels cells can be employed as shutters. While not commonly used, they avoid the problems associated with travelling-curtain shutters such as flash synchronisation limitations and image distortions when the object is moving.

== Rotary focal-plane shutter ==
Besides the horizontal Leica and vertical Square FP shutters, other types of FP shutters exist. The most prominent is the rotary or sector FP shutter. The rotary disc shutter is common in film and movie cameras, but rare in still cameras. These spin a round metal plate with a sector cutout in front of the film. In theory, rotary shutters can control their speeds by narrowing or widening the sector cutout (by using two overlapping plates and varying the overlap) and/or by spinning the plate faster or slower. However, most cameras&#x27; rotary shutters have fixed cutouts and can be varied in their spinning speed. The Olympus Pen F and Pen FT (1963 and 1966, both from Japan) half-frame 35 mm SLRs spun a semicircular titanium plate to 1/500 s.

Semicircular rotary shutters have unlimited X-sync speed, but all rotary FP shutters have the bulk required for the plate spin. The Univex Mercury (1938, US) half-frame 35 mm camera had a very large dome protruding out the top of the main body to accommodate its 1/1000 s rotary shutter. They also produce unusual distortion at very high speed because of the angular sweep of the exposure wipe. Bulk can be reduced by substituting blade sheaves for the plate, but then the rotary FP shutter essentially becomes a regular bladed FP shutter.

== Revolving drum focal-plane shutter ==

The revolving drum is an unusual FP shutter that has been used in several specialised panoramic cameras such as the Panon Widelux (1959, Japan) and KMZ Horizont (1968, Soviet Union). Instead of using an extremely short focal length (wide-angle) lens to achieve an extra-wide field of view, these cameras have a medium-wide lens encapsulated in a drum with a rear vertical slit. As the entire drum is horizontally pivoted on the lens&#x27;s rear nodal point, the slit wipes an extra-wide-aspect image onto film held against a curved focal plane. The Widelux produced a 140° wide image in a 24×59 mm frame on 135 film with a Lux 26 mm f/2.8 lens and controlled shutter speed by varying rotation speed on a fixed slit width.

In the Kodak Cirkut (1907, US) and Globus Globuscope (1981, US) cameras, the entire camera and lens revolved as the film was pulled past the slit in the opposite direction. The Globuscope produced a 360° angle of view image in a 24×160 mm frame on 135 film with a 25 mm lens and had an adjustable slit width with a constant rotation speed.

Revolving FP shutters produce images with unusual distortion where the image center seems to bulge toward the viewer, while the periphery appears to curve away because the lens&#x27;s field of view changes as it swivels. This distortion will disappear if the photograph is mounted on a circularly curved support and viewed with the eye at the center. Revolving shutters that do not rotate smoothly may create uneven exposure that will result in vertical banding in the image. Using the flash will also interfere.

These cameras are often used for photographing large groups of people (e.g., the &#x27;school&#x27; photograph). The subjects may be arranged in a shortened semicircle with the camera at the centre such that all the subjects are the same distance from the camera and facing the camera. Once the exposure is made and processed, the panoramic print shows everyone in a straight line facing in the same direction. The distortion present in the background betrays the technique.

== History and technical development ==
The earliest daguerreotype, invented in 1839, did not have shutters, because the lack of sensitivity of the process and the small apertures of available lenses meant that exposure times were measured in many minutes. A photographer could easily control exposure time by removing and returning the camera lens&#x27; lens cap or plug.

However, during the 19th century, as one increased-sensitivity process replaced another and larger aperture lenses became available, exposure times shortened to seconds and then to fractions of a second. Exposure timing control mechanisms became a necessary accessory and then a standard camera feature.

=== Single-curtain focal-plane shutter ===
The earliest manufactured shutter was the drop shutter of the 1870s. This was an accessory guillotine-like device—a wooden panel with a slit cutout mounted on rails in front of the camera lens that gravity dropped at a controlled rate. As the slit passed the lens, it &quot;wiped&quot; the exposure onto the photographic plate. With rubber bands to increase the drop speed, a 1/500 or 1/1000 s shutter speed could be reached. Eadweard Muybridge used shutters of this type in his trotting horse studies. By the 1880s, lens front-mounted accessory shutter boxes were available, containing a rubberised silk cloth curtain (also called a &quot;blind&quot;) with one or more width slit cutouts wound around two parallel drums and using springs to pull a slit from one drum to the other. The spring tension and the slit width can be adjusted.

In 1883, Ottomar Anschütz (Germany) patented a camera with an internal roller blind shutter mechanism, just in front of the photographic plate. Thus, the focal-plane shutter in its modern form was created. Goerz manufactured the Anschütz Camera as the first production FP shutter camera in 1890. Francis Blake invented a type of focal plane shutter camera in 1889 that achieved shutter speeds of 1/2000 second, and exhibited numerous stop-action photographs. A drop shutter-like mechanism with an adjustable slit was used at the focal plane of an apparently one-off William England camera in 1861 and this is considered the first FP shutter of any kind.

If the lens on a single curtain FP shutter camera has its lens cap off when the shutter is cocked, the film will be double exposed when the blind&#x27;s cutout re-passes the film gate. A camera-mounted FP shutter can use a very narrow slit to have a 1/1000 second shutter speed—although the available contemporaneous ISO 1 to 3 equivalent speed emulsions limited the opportunities to use the high speeds. Folmer and Schwing (US) were the most famous proponents of single curtain FP shutters, with their large format sheet film Graflex single-lens reflex and Graphic press cameras using them from 1905 to 1973. Their most common 4×5 inch shutters had four slit widths ranging from to inch and up to six spring tensions for a speed range of 1/10 to 1/1000 second.

=== Leica-type dual-curtain focal-plane shutter ===

In 1925, the Leica A (Germany) 35 mm camera was introduced with a dual-cloth-curtain, horizontal-travelling-slit, focal-plane shutter. A dual curtain FP shutter does not have precut slits and the spring tension is not adjustable. The exposure slit is formed by drawing open the first curtain onto one drum and then pulling closed the second curtain off a second drum after a clockwork escapement timed delay (imagine two overlapping window shades) and moving at one speed (technically, the curtains are still accelerating slightly) across the film gate. Faster shutter speeds are provided by timing the second shutter curtain to close sooner after the first curtain opens and narrowing the slit, wiping the film. Dual curtain FP shutters are self-capping; the curtains are designed to overlap as the shutter is cocked to prevent double exposure.

Although self-capping dual curtain FP shutters date back to the late 19th century, the Leica design made them popular and virtually all FP shutters introduced since 1925 are dual curtain models. As revised in the 1954 Leica M3 (West Germany), a typical Leica-type horizontal FP shutter for 35 mm cameras is pre-tensioned to traverse the 36 millimeter wide film gate in 18 milliseconds (at 2 meters per second) and supports slit widths for a speed range of 1 to 1/1000 s. A minimum 2 mm wide slit produces a maximum 1/1000 s effective shutter speed. The dual curtain FP shutter has the same fast-speed distortion problems as the single curtain type. FP shutters were also common in medium-format 120 roll film cameras.

Horizontal cloth FP shutters are normally limited to 1/1000 s maximum speed because of the difficulties in precisely timing extremely narrow slits and the unacceptable distortion resulting from a relatively slow wipe speed. Their maximum flash synchronization speed is also limited because the slit is fully open only to the film gate (36 mm wide or wider) and able to be flash exposed up to 1/60 s X-synchronization (nominal; 18 ms = 1/55 s actual maximum; in reality, a 40 mm slit to allow for variance gives 1/50 s ⅓ stop slow). Some horizontal FP shutters exceeded these limits by narrowing the slit or increasing curtain velocity beyond the norm; however, these tended to be ultra-high-precision models used in expensive professional-level cameras. The first such shutter was to be found in the Konica F, released in February 1960. Called the Hi-Synchro, this shutter reached a speed of 1/2000 s and made possible flash synchronization at 1/125 s.

=== Square-type metal-bladed focal-plane shutter ===
In 1960, the Konica F (Japan) 35 mm SLR began a long term incremental increase in maximum shutter speeds with its &quot;High Synchro&quot; FP shutter. This shutter greatly improved efficiency over the typical Leica shutter by using stronger metal blade sheaves that were &quot;fanned&quot; much faster, vertically along the minor axis of the 24×36 mm frame. As perfected in 1965 by Copal, the Copal Square&#x27;s slit traversed the 24 mm high film gate in 7 ms (3.4 m/s). This doubled the flash X-sync speed to 1/125 s. In addition, a minimum 1.7 mm wide slit would double the top shutter speed to a maximum of 1/2000 s. Most Squares were derated to 1/1000 s in the interest of reliability.

Squares came from the supplier as complete drop-in modules. Square-type FP shutters were originally bulky in size and noisy in operation, limiting their popularity in the 1960s. Although Konica and Nikkormat and Topcon (D-1) were major users of the Copal Square. It moved from three-axis to four-axis designs (one control axis for each curtain drum axis instead of one control for both drums). New compact and quieter Square designs were introduced in the 1970s. The most notable were the Copal Compact Shutter (CCS), introduced by the Konica Autoreflex TC in 1976, and the Seiko Metal Focal-Plane Compact (MFC), first used in the Pentax ME in 1977. The Leica Camera (originally E. Leitz) switched to a vertical metal FP shutter in 2006 for its first digital rangefinder (RF) camera, the Leica M8 (Germany). The Contax (Germany) 35 mm RF camera of 1932 had a vertical travel FP shutter with dual brass-slatted roller blinds with adjustable spring tension and slit width and a top speed of 1/1000 s (the Contax II of 1936 had a claimed 1/1250 s top speed).

=== Quest for higher speed ===
Although the Square shutter improved the FP shutter, it still limited maximum flash X-sync speed to 1/125 s (unless using special long-burn FP flash bulbs that burn throughout the slit wipe, making slit width irrelevant). Some leaf shutters from the 1960s could achieve at least 1/500 s flash sync.

Copal collaborated with Nippon Kogaku to change the Compact Square shutter for the Nikon FM2 (Japan) of 1982 to using a honeycomb pattern-etched titanium foil for its blade sheaves. This permitted cutting shutter-curtain travel time by nearly half to 3.6 ms (at 6.7 m/s) and allowed 1/200 s flash X-sync speed. It also has a distortionless top speed of up to 1/4000 s (with a 1.7 mm slit). The Nikon FE2 (Japan) had a 3.3 ms (at 7.3 m/s) curtain travel time and an X-sync speed of 1/250 s in 1983. The top speed remained 1/4000 s (with a 1.8 mm slit).

The fastest focal-plane shutter ever used in a film camera was the 1.8 ms curtain travel time (at 13.3 m/s) duralumin and carbon fiber bladed one introduced by the Minolta Maxxum 9xi (named Dynax 9xi in Europe, α-9xi in Japan) in 1992. It provided a maximum 1/12,000 s (with 1.1 mm slit) and 1/300 s X-sync. A later version of this shutter, spec&#x27;ed for 100,000 actuations, was used in the (named Dynax 9 in Europe, α-9 in Japan) in 1998 and Minolta Maxxum 9Ti (named Dynax 9Ti in Europe, α-9Ti in Japan) in 1999.

=== Electronically controlled focal-plane shutter ===
A parallel development to faster speed FP shutters was electronic shutter control. In 1966, the VEB Pentacon Praktica electronic (East Germany) was the first SLR with an electronically controlled FP shutter. It used electronic circuitry to time its shutter instead of the traditional spring/gear/lever clockwork mechanisms. In 1971, the Asahi Pentax Electro Spotmatic (Japan; name shortened to Asahi Pentax ES in 1972; called Honeywell Pentax ES in US) tied its electronically controlled shutter to its exposure control light meter to provide electronic aperture-priority autoexposure.

The traditional 1/1000 s and 1/2000 s top speeds of horizontal and vertical FP shutters are often stop too slow, even in ultra-high-quality models. Spring powered geartrains reliably time any higher accelerations and shocks. For example, some highly tensioned FP shutters could suffer from &quot;shutter curtain bounce&quot;. If the curtains are not properly braked after crossing the film gate, they might crash and bounce; reopening the shutter and causing double exposure ghosting bands on the image edge. Even the Nikon F2&#x27;s ultra-high precision shutter suffered from this as an early production teething problem.

At first, electromagnets controlled by analogue resistor/capacitor timers were used to govern the release of the second shutter curtain (though still operated by spring power). In 1979, the Yashica Contax 139 Quartz (Japan) introduced digital piezoelectric quartz (shortly followed by ceramic) oscillator circuits (ultimately under digital microprocessor control) to time and sequence its entire exposure cycle, including its vertical FP shutter. Electric &quot;coreless&quot; micromotors, with near instantaneous on/off capability and relatively high power for their size, would drive both curtains and other camera systems replacing springs in the late 1980s. Minimizing mechanical moving parts also helped to prevent inertial shock vibration problems.

A spring-wound clockwork escapement must completely unwind fairly quickly and limit the longest speed—generally to one full second, although the Kine Exakta (Germany) offered 12 s in 1936. The Olympus OM-2&#x27;s electronically timed horizontal FP shutter could reach 60 s in 1975 and the Olympus OM-4 (both Japan) reached 240 s in 1983. The Pentax LX (Japan, 1980) and Canon New F-1 (Japan, 1981) had hybrid electromechanical FP shutters that timed their fast speeds mechanically, but used electronics only to extend the slow speed range; the LX to 125 s and the F-1N to 8 s.

Electronics are also responsible for pushing the focal-plane shutter&#x27;s X-sync speed beyond its mechanical limits. A horizontal FP shutter for 35 mm cameras is fully open and usable only for flash exposure up to 1/60 s, while vertical FP shutters are usually limited to 1/125 s. At higher speeds, a normal 1 millisecond electronic flash burst would expose only the part open to the slit. In 1986, the Olympus OM-4T (Japan) introduced a system that could synchronize an Olympus F280 Full Synchro electronic flash to pulse its light at a 20 kilohertz rate for up to 40 ms to illuminate its horizontal FP shutter&#x27;s slit as it crossed the entire film gate—in effect, simulating long-burn FP flashbulbs—allowing flash exposure at shutter speeds as fast as 1/2000 s. There is a concomitant loss of flash range. Extended &quot;FP flash&quot; sync speeds began appearing in many high-end 35 mm SLRs in the mid-1990s, and reached 1/12,000 s in the (Japan; called Dynax 9 in Europe, Alpha 9 in Japan) of 1998. They are still offered in some digital SLRs to 1/8000 s. Leaf shutter cameras are not affected by this issue.

=== Focal-plane shutters today ===
Focal-plane shutter top speed peaked at 1/16,000 s (and 1/500 s X-sync) in 1999 with the Nikon D1 digital SLR. The D1 used electronic assist from its sensor for the 1/16,000 s speed and its 15.6×23.7 mm &quot;APS-size&quot; sensor was smaller than 35 mm film and therefore easier to cross quickly for 1/500 s X-sync.

However, with very limited need for such extremely fast speeds, FP shutters retreated to 1/8000 s in 2003 (and 1/250 s X-sync in 2006)—even in professional level cameras. In addition, since no specialised timers are needed for extremely slow speeds, the slowest speed setting is usually 30 s. Instead, over the last twenty years, most effort has gone into improving durability and reliability. Whereas the best mechanically controlled shutters were rated for 150,000 cycles and had an accuracy of ±¼ stop from nominal value (more typically 50,000 cycles at ±½ stop).

In the last few years, digital point-and-shoot cameras have been using timed electronic sampling of the image sensor, replacing the traditional mechanical leaf shutter with delicate moving parts that can wear out, used by film-based point-and-shoot units. Something similar is also occurring with digital cameras that, in the past, would have used focal-plane shutters. For example, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G3 (2011, Japan) interchangeable lens digital camera has an FP shutter, but in its 20 frames per second SH Burst mode, it locks its mechanical shutter open and electronically scans its digital sensor, although with a reduced resolution of 4 megapixels from 16 MP.

<text>The Norwegian football champions () or Eliteserien champions, are the winners of the highest-level football league in Norway. Norgesserien was competed three times with eleven conferences and play-offs from 1937–38 to 1947–48. It was then replaced by the two-conference Hovedserien, which was replaced by the single-conference 1. divisjon in 1963. The top tier changed its name to the Tippeligaen in 1990, and to the current Eliteserien for 2017 and beyond. The winners of this title are not considered Norwegian football champions, as the title is reserved for the winners of the Norwegian Football Cup.

Sixteen clubs from ten cities have won the honor. With 26 titles Rosenborg is the most successful team, including 13 consecutive titles from 1992 through 2004. In the early years, Fredrikstad was highly successful, winning the first two titles and taking nine titles until 1960–61. Viking then took over dominance and rose to become the second-most winning team with their four consecutive titles from 1972 through 1975. The double—winning the league and cup the same season—has occurred fourteen times by six clubs.

At the end of the 1937–38 season, Fredrikstad were the first club to be crowned champions in the history of the championship. Rosenborg have won 26 titles, the most of any club. Fredrikstad are second with nine. Rosenborg dominated during the 1990s and 2000s, winning 13 consecutive league titles from 1992 to 2004. Fredrikstad secured all their titles before the league changed its format to a one-group top division in 1963. Third-most title winning team Viking dominated in the 1970s when they won five of their eight titles. Rosenborg and Viking are the only teams to have won the league title three or more consecutive times. All the clubs which have ever been crowned champions are still in existence today and all take part in the top six tiers of the Norwegian football league system - the football pyramid.

==Format==
Attempts to create a national league were started in 1914–16 with the Test League, although this never held any official status. The first official league competition was the League of Norway, which started being contested in the 1937–38 season. It consisted of eleven double round robin conferences, each with six or seven teams, with the conference winners playing a two-legged, four-round play-off. Only two full seasons were contested before it was interrupted by World War II, but the league saw a final season be competed in 1947–48. The Main League started in the 1948–49 season, and saw two conferences each with eight teams. At the season end, the conference winners met for a two-legged final. In the 1959–60 and 1960–61, also bronze matches were played between the two conference runners-up.

The final season, in 1961–62, saw all 16 teams collected in a single league which was played over one and a half years. Starting with the 1963, ten team were collected into a single league, named the First Division. At the same time, the season changed from a winter to a summer league. From the 1972 season, teams from Northern Norway were also allowed to participate in the 1. divisjon, for the first time creating a pan-national league. The same season saw the number of teams increase from ten to twelve. The league was renamed to Tippeligaen in 1990, after the sponsor Norsk Tipping, and in 1997 a single-conference league was created below the top league for the first time. The Tippeligaen was expanded to 14 teams from the 1995 season and to 16 teams from the 2009 season.

==List==
The following is a list of winners (gold), runners-up (silver) and third place (bronze) teams in the highest-level football league in Norway. It also shows teams that won the double.

<text>Jaime Ramón Mercader del Río (; ; 7 February 1913 – 18 October 1978) was a Spanish communist and NKVD secret agent who assassinated the revolutionary Leon Trotsky in Mexico City in August 1940. Mercader was imprisoned for 19 years and 8 months in Mexico for murdering Trotsky with an ice axe.

In 1960, after release from Mexican imprisonment, Mercader was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal and the Order of Lenin medal , and lived at different times in Cuba, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia.

==Life==
Jaime Ramón Mercader del Río was born on 7 February 1913 in the town of Argentona, in Maresme county, Catalonia, Spain to Eustacia María Caridad del Río Hernández (aka Caridad Mercader), daughter of a Cantabrian merchant who became rich from his business in the Captaincy General of Cuba, and Pau Mercader Marina, son of a Catalonian textile industrialist. Jaime Ramón was raised in France by his mother Caridad, who also was a communist who fought in the Spanish Civil War, and also served in the Soviet international underground.

In the mid-1930s, young Mercader became a Communist and worked for leftist organizations during the existence of the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). He was imprisoned for his political activities, but then was freed when the left-wing coalition of the Popular Front were elected as the government of Spain in 1936. During the civil war, he was recruited by Nahum Eitingon, an officer of the NKVD (People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, the Soviet secret police), who sent Mercader for secret agent training in the USSR.

Mercader befriended and infiltrated the Trotskyist communist faction during the Spanish Civil War. As a secret agent of the NKVD, Mercader met with the war correspondent David Crook, an English communist and volunteer soldier for the Republican side, in the city of Albacete, Castilla–La Mancha, and there taught him the Spanish language and trained him in the techniques of espionage. Moreover, as a correspondent for the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, Crook spied on fellow volunteer George Orwell and other militiamen of the POUM (Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification) and the Independent Labour Party.

==Assassination of Trotsky==
In 1938, whilst a student at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne), with the help of Mark Zborowski, Mercader befriended Sylvia Ageloff, a young intellectual woman from Brooklyn, New York, who also was a confidante of Trotsky in Paris. As friend to Ageloff, Mercader assumed the identity of Jacques Mornard, the son of a Belgian diplomat. In 1939, a man from the Bureau of the Fourth International communicated with Mercader; and the student Ageloff had returned to Brooklyn in September 1939, where Mercader joined her under the assumed Canadian identity of Frank Jacson, facilitated by and with the passport of Tony Babich, a Canadian volunteer soldier in the Spanish Republican Army killed in battle. To assuage her suspicions about his true identity, Mercader told Ageloff that he had bought a false identity in order to avoid military service.

In October 1939, Mercader moved to Mexico City and persuaded Ageloff to join him there. Leon Trotsky was living with his family in Coyoacán, then a village on the southern fringes of Mexico City. He was exiled from the Soviet Union after losing the power struggle against Stalin&#x27;s rise to power.

Trotsky had been the subject of an armed attack against his house, mounted by allegedly Soviet-recruited locals, including the Marxist–Leninist muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros. The attack was organised and prepared by Pavel Sudoplatov, deputy director of the foreign department of the NKVD. In his memoirs, Sudoplatov claimed that, in March 1939, he had been taken by his chief, Lavrentiy Beria, to see Stalin. Stalin told them that &quot;if Trotsky is finished the threat will be eliminated&quot; and gave the order that &quot;Trotsky should be eliminated within a year.&quot;

After that attack failed, a second team was sent, headed by Eitingon, formerly the deputy NKVD agent in Spain. He allegedly was involved in the kidnap, torture, and murder of Andreu Nin. The new plan was to send a lone assassin against Trotsky. The team included Mercader and his mother Caridad. Sudoplatov claimed in his autobiography &quot;Special Tasks&quot; that he selected Ramón Mercader for the task of carrying out the assassination.

Through his lover Sylvia Ageloff&#x27;s access to the Coyoacán house, Mercader, as Jacson, began to meet with Trotsky, posing as a sympathizer to his ideas, befriending his guards, and doing small favors. He made drawings of the villa to help the other groups of assassins. Trotsky&#x27;s grandson Esteban Volkov, aged 14 at the time of the assassination, emphasized that Jacson had been present in Trotsky&#x27;s house during the first attack led by Siqueiros.

On 20 August 1940, Mercader was alone with Trotsky in his study under the pretext of showing the older man a document. Mercader struck Trotsky from behind and mortally wounded him on the head with an ice axe while he was looking at the document.

The blow failed to kill Trotsky, and he got up and grappled with Mercader. Hearing the commotion, Trotsky&#x27;s guards burst into the room and beat Mercader nearly to death. Trotsky, severely wounded but still conscious, ordered them not to kill the attacker so he could speak.

Caridad and Eitingon were waiting outside the compound in separate cars to provide a getaway, but when Mercader failed to return, they left and fled the country.

Trotsky was taken to a hospital in the city and operated on but died the next day as a result of severe brain injuries.

Trotsky&#x27;s guards turned Mercader over to the Mexican authorities. He refused to acknowledge his true identity. He only identified himself as Jacques Mornard. Mercader claimed to the police that he had wanted to marry Ageloff, but Trotsky forbade the wedding. He alleged that a violent quarrel with Trotsky had led to his decision to murder him.

Mercader stated:
In 1943, Jacques Mornard was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison by the Sixth Criminal Court of Mexico City. According to Stephen Schwartz, he was initially identified as Ramón Mercader by the Catalan reporter Víctor Alba, whose finding was later confirmed by the US counterintelligence project Venona.

===Murder weapon===
The ice axe recovered by the Mexico City police was stored in an evidence room for several years until it was &quot;checked out&quot; by a secret police officer, named Alfredo Salas, who claimed he wanted to preserve it &quot;for posterity.&quot; It was a mountaineering ice axe known in French as a &quot;piolet&quot;, made by the Austrian manufacturer Werkgen Fulpmes. Mercader cut off about half the length of the handle. He claimed to be an experienced mountaineer, and bragged to police interrogators, &quot;I had a rare ability to handle the piolet, since two blows were sufficient for me to crack through an enormous block of ice&quot;.

Salas passed the ice axe on to his daughter, Ana Alicia, who eventually put it up for sale in 2005. Trotsky&#x27;s grandson, Esteban Volkov, stated that he is &quot;unconcerned&quot; about the fate of the alleged murder weapon and wondered &quot;if it is the real axe.&quot; The ice axe was bought by Keith Melton, an American collector and author of books on the history of espionage, and is now on display at the International Spy Museum, in Washington, D.C.

==Aftermath: release and honors==
Shortly after the assassination, Joseph Stalin presented Mercader&#x27;s mother Eustaquia Caridad with the Order of Lenin for her part in the operation. After the first few years in prison, Mercader requested to be released on parole, represented by Jesús Siordia and the criminologist Alfonso Quiroz Cuarón, but his request was denied by the Mexican authorities. In 1943, Caridad Mercader applied to Stalin personally, for her part in the secret operation, to release Mercader.

In 1944, she obtained a permit to leave the USSR. However, contrary to the agreed-upon conditions, she not only led that attempt at a distance but traveled to Mexico, where she was known not only as the mother of Mercader, but also as an organizer of the assassination. This undermined an undercover operation to get Mercader out of jail. Caridad&#x27;s presence proved to be counterproductive; although she improved the life of Mercader in prison significantly, the Mexican authorities tightened security measures, causing the Soviets to abandon their efforts to release Mercader. Though Caridad reported important things to the Mexican authorities, Mercader served 19 years and eight months in prison (including the time under initial investigation and trial) according to the initial trial&#x27;s 20-years-and-one-day conviction. Mercader, who according to his brother Luis never shared his mother&#x27;s passion for the communist cause, never forgave her for her interference.

After almost 20 years in prison, Mercader was released from Mexico City&#x27;s Palacio de Lecumberri prison on 6 May 1960. He moved to Havana, Cuba, where Fidel Castro&#x27;s new socialist government welcomed him. In 1961, Mercader moved to the Soviet Union and subsequently was presented with the country&#x27;s highest decoration, Hero of the Soviet Union, personally by Alexander Shelepin, the head of the KGB. He divided his time among Czechoslovakia, from where he traveled to different countries, Cuba, where he was the advisor of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and the Soviet Union for the rest of his life. He married a Mexican named Rogalia in prison after 1940 and had two children.

Mercader died in Havana in 1978 of lung cancer. He is buried under the name Ramón Ivanovich Lopez (Рамон Иванович Лопес) in Moscow&#x27;s Kuntsevo Cemetery. 

==Decorations and awards==
* Hero of the Soviet Union, 1940 (in absentia) according to Isaac Don Levine (1959)
* Order of Lenin

==In popular culture==
There have been many documentaries about the assassination and Mercader over the years. A Spanish documentary about Mercader&#x27;s life, called &quot;Asaltar los cielos&quot; (&quot;Storm the skies&quot;), was released in 1996 while a Spanish-language documentary, &quot;El Asesinato de Trotsky&quot;, was co-produced in 2006 by The History Channel and Anima Films as a joint US/Argentine production, and directed by Argentinian director Matías Gueilburt. There have been also many films, such as the 1972 Joseph Losey–directed &quot;The Assassination of Trotsky&quot;, featuring Alain Delon as Frank Jacson/Mercader and Richard Burton as Trotsky, and the 2016 film &quot;The Chosen,&quot; directed by Antonio Chavarrías and filmed in Mexico, which is an account of Trotsky&#x27;s murder, featuring Alfonso Herrera as Mercader. The Trotsky assassination is depicted in the 2002 film &quot;Frida&quot;, with Mercader portrayed by Antonio Zavala Kugler (uncredited) and Trotsky by Geoffrey Rush.

In 1967, West German television presented &quot;L.D. Trotzki – Tod im Exil&quot; (&quot;L. D. Trotsky – Death in exile&quot;), a play in two parts, directed by August Everding, with Peter Lühr in the role of Trotsky. &quot;Trotsky&quot;, a 2017 Russian Netflix series, features Konstantin Khabenskiy as Trotsky and Maksim Matveyev as Mercader, who is referred in the English subtitles as &quot;Jackson.&quot;

Trotskyist veteran Lillian Pollak depicted her friendship with Mercader, then known as Frank Jacson, and the assassination of Trotsky in her self-published 2008 novel &quot;The Sweetest Dream&quot; while a 2009 novel by U.S. writer Barbara Kingsolver, &quot;The Lacuna&quot;, includes an account of Trotsky&#x27;s assassination by &quot;Jacson.&quot; Cuban author Leonardo Padura Fuentes&#x27; 2009 novel &quot;El hombre que amaba a los perros&quot; (&quot;The Man Who Loved Dogs&quot;) refers to the lives of both Trotsky and Mercader.

David Ives&#x27; &quot;Variations on the Death of Trotsky&quot; is a short one-act comedy drama based on Mercader&#x27;s assassination of Trotsky written for the series of one-act plays titled &quot;All in the Timing&quot;.

<text>A distress signal, also known as a distress call, is an internationally recognized means for obtaining help. Distress signals are communicated by transmitting radio signals, displaying a visually observable item or illumination, or making a sound audible from a distance.

A distress signal indicates that a person or group of people, watercraft, aircraft, or other vehicle is threatened by a serious or imminent danger and requires immediate assistance. Use of distress signals in other circumstances may be against local or international law. An urgency signal is available to request assistance in less critical situations.

For distress signalling to be the most effective, two parameters must be communicated:
* Alert or notification of an emergency in progress
* Position or location (or localization or pinpointing) of the party in distress.

For example, a single aerial flare alerts observers to the existence of a vessel in distress somewhere in the general direction of the flare sighting on the horizon but extinguishes within one minute or less. A hand-held flare burns for three minutes and can be used to localize or pinpoint more precisely the exact location or position of the party in trouble. An EPIRB both notifies or alerts authorities and at the same time provides position indication information.

== Maritime ==
Distress signals at sea are defined in the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and in the International Code of Signals. Mayday signals must only be used where there is grave and imminent danger to life. Otherwise, urgent signals such as pan-pan can be sent. Most jurisdictions have large penalties for false, unwarranted, or prank distress signals. The alerts are of utmost importance in ensuring the safety of life at sea, and are governed by international maritime law, specifically the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).

Distress can be indicated by any of the following officially sanctioned methods:

* Transmitting a spoken voice Mayday message by radio over very high frequency channel 16 (156.8 MHz) or medium frequency on 2182 kHz
* Transmitting a digital distress signal by activating (or pressing) the distress button on a marine radio equipped with Digital Selective Calling (DSC) over VHF channel 70 or over another designated DSC frequency in the maritime MF and HF bands.
* Transmitting a digital distress signal by activating (or pressing) the distress button (or key) on an Inmarsat-C satellite internet device
* Sending the Morse code group SOS () by light flashes or sounds
* Burning a red flare (either hand-held or aerial parachute flare)
* Launching distress rockets
* Emitting orange smoke from a canister
* Showing flames on the vessel (as from a burning tar barrel, oil barrel, etc.)
* Raising and lowering slowly and repeatedly both arms outstretched to each side
* Making a continuous sound with any fog-signaling apparatus
* Firing a gun or other explosive signal at intervals of about a minute
* Flying the international maritime signal flags NC 
* Displaying a visual signal consisting of a square flag having above or below it a ball or anything resembling a ball (round or circular in appearance)

A floating man-overboard pole or dan buoy can be used to indicate that a person is in distress in the water and is ordinarily equipped with a yellow and red flag (international code of signals flag &quot;O&quot;) and a flashing lamp or strobe light.

In North America, marine search and rescue agencies in Canada and the United States also recognize certain other distress signals:
* Sea marker dye
* White high-intensity strobe light flashing at 60 times per minute

===Automated radio signals===
In addition, distress can be signaled using automated radio signals such as a Search and Rescue Transponder (SART) which response to 9 GHz radar signal, or an Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) which operates in the 406 MHz radio frequency. EPIRB signals are received and processed by a constellation of satellites known as Cospas-Sarsat. Older EPIRBs that use 121.5 MHz are obsolete. Many regulators require vessels that proceed offshore to carry an EPIRB.

Many EPIRBs have an in-built Global Positioning System receiver. When activated these EPIRBs rapidly report the latitude and longitude of the emergency accurate to within . The position of non-GPS EPIRBs is determined by the orbiting satellites, this can take ninety minutes to five hours after activation and is accurate to within . Marine safety authorities recommend the use of GPS-equipped EPIRBs.

A miniaturized EPIRB capable of being carried in crew members&#x27; clothing is called a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB). Regulators do not view them as a substitute for a vessel&#x27;s EPIRB. In situations with a high risk of &quot;man overboard&quot;, such as open ocean yacht racing, PLBs may be required by the event&#x27;s organizers. PLBs are also often carried during risky outdoor activities on the land.

EPIRBs and PLBs have a unique identification number (UIN or &quot;HexID&quot;). A purchaser should register their EPIRB or PLB with the national search and rescue authority; this is free in most jurisdictions. EPIRB registration allows the authority to alert searchers of the vessel&#x27;s name, label, type, size, and paintwork; to promptly notify next-of-kin, and to quickly resolve inadvertent activations.

A DSC radio distress signal can include the position if the lat/long are manually keyed into the radio or if a GPS-derived position is passed electronically directly into the radio.

===Mayday===
A Mayday message consists of the word &quot;mayday&quot; spoken three times in succession, which is the distress signal, followed by the distress message, which should include:
* Name of the vessel or ship in distress
* Its position (actual, last known, or estimated expressed in lat/long or in distance/bearing from a specific location)
* Nature of the vessel distress condition or situation (e.g. on fire, sinking, aground, taking on water, adrift in hazardous waters)
* Number of persons at risk or to be rescued; grave injuries
* Type of assistance needed or being sought
* Any other details to facilitate resolution of the emergency such as actions being taken (e.g. abandoning ship, pumping flood water), estimated available time remaining afloat

=== Unusual or extraordinary appearance ===
When none of the above-described officially sanctioned signals are available, attention for assistance can be attracted by anything that appears unusual or out of the ordinary, such as a jib sail hoisted upside down.

During daylight hours when the sun is visible, a heliograph mirror can be used to flash bright, intense sunlight. Battery-powered laser lights the size of small flashlights (electric torches) are available for use in emergency signaling.

=== Inverted flags ===
For hundreds of years inverted national flags were commonly used as distress signals. However, for some countries&#x27; flags it is difficult (e.g., Spain, South Korea, United Kingdom) or impossible (e.g., Japan, Thailand, and Israel) to determine whether they are inverted. Other countries have flags that are inverses of each other; for example, the Polish flag is white on the top half and red on the bottom, while Indonesia&#x27;s and Monaco&#x27;s flags are the opposite—i.e., top half red, the bottom half white. A ship flying no flags may also be understood to be in distress. For one country, the Philippines, an inverted flag is a symbol of war rather than distress.

If any flag is available, distress may be indicated by tying a knot in it and then flying it upside-down, making it into a &quot;&quot;.

=== Device loss and disposal ===
To avoid pointless searches some devices must be reported when lost. This particularly applies to EPIRBs, lifebuoys, rafts, and devices marked with the vessel&#x27;s name and port.

Expired flares should not be set off, as this indicates distress. Rather, most port authorities offer disposal facilities for expired distress pyrotechnics. In some areas special training events are organized, where the flares can be used safely.

EPIRBs must not be disposed of into general waste as discarded EPIRBs often trigger at the waste disposal facility. In 2013, the majority of EPIRB activations investigated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority were due to the incorrect disposal of obsolete 121.5 MHz EPIRB beacons.

== Aviation ==

The civilian aircraft frequency for voice distress alerting is 121.5 MHz. Military aircraft use 243 MHz (which is a harmonic of 121.5 MHz, and therefore civilian beacons transmit on this frequency as well). Aircraft can also signal an emergency by setting one of several special transponder codes, such as 7700.

The COSPAS/SARSAT signal can be transmitted by an Electronic Locator Transmitter or ELT, which is similar to a marine EPIRB on the 406 MHz radiofrequency. (Marine EPIRBs are constructed to float, while an aviation ELT is constructed to be activated by a sharp deceleration and is sometimes referred to as a Crash Position Indicator or CPI).

A &quot;triangular distress pattern&quot; is a rarely used flight pattern flown by aircraft in distress but without radio communications. The standard pattern is a series of 120° turns.

=== Ground Air Emergency Codes ===

Ground-Air Emergency Codes are distress signals used by crashed pilots and military personnel to send signals from the ground to an aircraft.

== Schwarzwald ==
The recognized mountain distress signals are based on groups of three, or six in the UK and the European Schwarzwald. A distress signal can be three fires or piles of rocks in a triangle, three blasts on a whistle, three shots from a firearm, or three flashes of light, in succession followed by a one-minute pause and repeated until a response is received. Three blasts or flashes is the appropriate response.

In the Schwarzwald, the recommended way to signal distress is the Schwarzwald distress signal: give &quot;six signals within a minute&quot;, then pause for a minute, repeating this until rescue arrives. A signal may be anything visual (waving clothes or lights, use of a signal mirror) or audible (shouts, whistles, etc.). The rescuers acknowledge with three signals per minute.

In practice, either signal pattern is likely to be recognized in most popular mountainous areas as nearby climbing teams are likely to include Europeans or North Americans.
To communicate with a helicopter in sight, raise both arms (forming the letter Y) to indicate &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;I need help&quot;, or stretch one arm up and one down (imitating the letter N) for &quot;No&quot; or &quot;I do not need help&quot;. If semaphore flags are available, they can be used to communicate with rescuers.

== Ground beacons ==
The COSPAS-SARSAT 406 MHz radiofrequency distress signal can be transmitted by hikers, backpackers, trekkers, mountaineers and other ground-based remote adventure seekers and personnel working in isolated backcountry areas using a small, portable Personal Locator Beacon or PLB.

<doc id="303512" wikidata="Q424340" url="?curid=303512" title="Terbutaline">
<text>Terbutaline, sold under the brand names Bricanyl and Marex among others, is a β2 adrenergic receptor agonist, used as a &quot;reliever&quot; inhaler in the management of asthma symptoms and as a tocolytic (anti-contraction medication) to delay preterm labor for up to 48 hours. This time can then be used to administer steroid injections to the mother which help fetal lung maturity and reduce complications of prematurity. It should not be used to prevent preterm labor or delay labor more than 48–72 hours. In February 2011, the Food and Drug Administration began requiring a black box warning on the drug&#x27;s label. Pregnant women should not be given injections of the drug terbutaline for the prevention of preterm labor or for long-term (beyond 48–72 hours) management of preterm labor, and should not be given oral terbutaline for any type of prevention or treatment of preterm labor &quot;due to the potential for serious maternal heart problems and death.&quot;
It was patented in 1966 and came into medical use in 1970. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
Terbutaline is used as a fast-acting bronchodilator (often used as a short-term asthma treatment) and as a tocolytic to delay premature labor.

As an asthma treatment, the inhaled form of terbutaline, starts working within 15 minutes and can last up to 6 hours. It is also sold as an injectable solution, an oral tablet, and as a syrup (in combination with guaifenesin).

Terbutaline is a pregnancy category C medication and is prescribed to stop contractions. After successful intravenous tocolysis, little evidence exists that oral terbutaline is effective. Terbutaline as a treatment for premature labor is an off-label use not approved by the US FDA, who have warned that oral terbutaline is not effective and can cause severe heart problems or death, and while injectable terbutaline can be used for premature labor in emergency situations in a hospital setting, it should only be used for short periods of time.

==Side effects==
* Adult — tachycardia, anxiety, , tremors, headache, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hypotension and, rarely, pulmonary edema.
* Fetal — tachycardia and hypoglycemia.

== Pharmacology==
The tertiary butyl group in terbutaline makes it more selective for β2 receptors. Since there is no hydroxy group on position 4 of the benzene ring, the molecule is less susceptible to metabolism by the enzyme catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyl transferase.

==Chemistry==
Terbutaline is synthesized by brominating 3,5-dibenzyloxyacetophenone into 3,5-dibenzyloxybromoacetophenone, which is reacted with &quot;N&quot;-benzyl-&quot;N&quot;-&quot;tert&quot;-butylamine, giving a ketone intermediate. Reduction of this product with H₂ over Pd/C leads to terbutaline.

=== Stereochemistry ===
Terbutaline contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers. This is a racemate, ie a 1: 1 mixture of (R) - and the (S) - form:

==Society and culture==

===Athletics===
As with all β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, terbutaline is on the World Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s list of prohibited drugs, except when administered by inhalation and a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) has been obtained in advance.

===Brand names===
Brand names include Astherin, Bronclyn, Brethine, Bricanyl, Brethaire, Marex, Terasma, and Terbulin.

<text>Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace (KDA) is one of three business units of Kongsberg Gruppen (KONGSBERG) of Norway and a supplier of defence and space related systems and products, mainly anti-ship missiles, military communications, and command and weapons control systems for naval vessels and air-defence applications. Today, the company is probably best known abroad for its development/industrialisation and production of the first passive IR homing anti-ship missile of the western world, the Penguin, starting delivery in the early 1970s (when Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace was part of KONGSBERG&#x27;s predecessor &quot;Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk&quot;). As of 2021, Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace had 3,500 employees.

Space related activities are conducted within Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace&#x27;s Space &amp; Surveillance division and &quot;Kongsberg Satellite Services&quot;. Notable space related products from Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace are the Booster Attachment and Release Mechanisms for ESA&#x27;s Ariane 5. In the early 1990s Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace was involved with NASA&#x27;s JPL and Germany&#x27;s DASA in software development of the test/checkout system, as well as spacecraft hardware production, for the NASA/ESA Cassini-Huygens space probe. Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace has also delivered the Solar Array Drive Mechanism for ESA&#x27;s Rosetta space probe.

On 22 November 2008 Norwegian Minister of Defence Anne-Grete Strøm-Erichsen opened a new Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace plant that will produce parts for the aircraft recently chosen as Norway&#x27;s future fighter, the F-35 Lightning II.

==Owners and ownership in other companies==
It is fully owned by Kongsberg Gruppen ASA (a company majority owned by Norway&#x27;s government.)

Its subsidiaries are Kongsberg Spacetec AS, Kongsberg Hungaria Kft, Kongsberg Norcontrol AS, Kongsberg Defence Corp., Kongsberg Defence Oy, Kongsberg Defence Sp. Z.O.O., Kongsberg Gallium Ltd., and Kongsberg Defence Ltd. Co.

It owns 50% of Kongsberg Satellite Services AS, and 77% of Kongsberg NanoAvionics AUB.

==Toshiba-Kongsberg affair==

In 1987, Toshiba Machine, a subsidiary of Toshiba, was accused of illegally selling CNC milling machines used to produce very quiet submarine propellers to the Soviet Union in violation of the CoCom agreement, an international embargo on certain countries to COMECON countries. The Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal involved a subsidiary of Toshiba and the Norwegian company Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk. The incident strained relations between the United States and Japan, and resulted in the arrest and prosecution of two senior executives, as well as the imposition of sanctions on the company by both countries.

<text>Eco-terrorism is an act of violence which is committed in support of environmental causes, against people or property.

The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) defines eco-terrorism as &quot;...the use or threatened use of violence of a criminal nature against innocent victims or their property by an environmentally oriented, subnational group for environmental-political reasons, or aimed at an audience beyond the target, often of a symbolic nature.&quot; The FBI attributed eco-terrorists to US $200 million in property damage between 2003 and 2008. A majority of states in the US have introduced laws aimed at penalizing eco-terrorism.

Eco-terrorism is a form of radical environmentalism that arose out of the same school of thought that brought about deep ecology, ecofeminism, social ecology, and bioregionalism.

== History ==
The term &quot;ecoterrorism&quot; was not coined until the 1960s; however, the history of ecoterrorism precedes that time. Although not referred to as ecoterrorism at the time, there have been incidents in history of people using terror to protect or defend the environment. It can be seen in the War of Desmoiselles, or War of the Maidens. The War of the Demoiselles was a series of peasant revolts in response to the new forest codes implemented by the French government in 1827. In May 1829 groups of peasant men dressed in women&#x27;s clothes terrorized forest guards and charcoal-makers who they felt had wrongfully taken the land to exploit it. The revolts persisted for four years until May 1832.

This particular instance is considered an act of eco-terrorism because the peasants used tactics similar to modern day eco-terrorist groups. The peasants of Ariege masked their identities and committed acts of terror. They specifically targeted government officials who infringed on the rights of the forest; however, this is considered a pre-history rather than an actual act of eco-terrorism because the peasants weren&#x27;t environmentalist. The peasants committed their acts to protect the environment because they felt they had a claim to it due to it being their main source of income and way of life for generations.

Instances of pre-ecoterrorism can also be found in the age of colonialism and imperialism. Native and indigenous people didn&#x27;t have the same view on land as property that Europeans did. When the Europeans colonized other foreign lands they believed that the natives were not using the land properly. Land was something that was meant to be profited and capitalized off of. Oftentimes natives would engage in warfare to protect their land. This is similar to the way that modern day environmentalists fight to protect land from major corporations aiming to deforest land to build factories. An example of Europeans infringing on the rights of natives can be found in the colonial administration of Algeria. When the French colonized Algeria they took the land from natives because they believed they were not using it properly, claiming that their nomadic lifestyle was damaging to the environment in order to justify their usurping of the land; however, the natives of Algeria engaged in battles in order to try and keep their land and lifestyle.

== Eco-terrorism, civil disobedience, and sabotage ==
Eco-terrorism is often defined as the use of violence to further environmental policy change. Eco-terrorists are willing to inflict emotional and physical distress on their victims if they believe it will further their environmental goals. This more radical version of environmental action is illegal, as compared to its more moderate forerunner of eco-activism which is not illegal and would be classified as a form of civil disobedience and uses protests, sit ins and other civil actions to effect environmental change. Eco-terrorism can also include sabotage in the name of the environment, which is illegal as this includes crimes against property which could lead to harm to humans. In the United States, the FBI&#x27;s definition of terrorism includes acts of violence against property, which makes most acts of sabotage fall in the realm of domestic terrorism.

Many radical environmentalists contest the FBI&#x27;s definition of eco-terrorism for being inaccurate to other definitions of terrorism such as that of the International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism which states that acts of terrorism are only those purposely directed at civilians. Radical environmentalists also criticize conflation of eco-terrorism with ecotage by governments and media as rhetorical tools to take advantage of preconceived notions about terrorism and apply them to acts which do not fit what terrorism really is.

Sabotage involves destroying, or threatening to destroy, property, and in this case is also known as monkeywrenching or ecotage. Many acts of sabotage involve the damage of equipment and unmanned facilities using arson.

==Philosophy==
The thought behind eco-terrorism rises from the radical environmentalism movement, which gained currency during the 1960s. Ideas that arose from radical environmentalism are &quot;based on the belief that capitalism, patriarchal society, and the industrial revolution and its subsequent innovations were responsible for the despoliation of nature&quot;. Radical environmentalism is also characterized by the belief that human society is responsible for the depletion of the environment and, if current society is left unchecked, will lead to the ultimate complete degradation of the environment. Craig Rosebraugh, spokesperson of the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front, justifies destructive or violent direct action as necessary evils in response to the lack of action regarding environmentalist efforts. Rosebraugh cites a &quot;choice-of-evils defense&quot; and asks whether it is a &quot;greater evil to destroy this property of this corporation or to choose to allow these corporations to continue to destroy the environment&quot; 

Many of the groups accused of eco-terrorism spawn from the radical environmentalist philosophy of deep ecology. Deep ecologists believe that human self-realization must come from identification with the greater environment. Deep ecology calls for complete solidarity with the environment and therefore categorizes many conservation groups as &quot;shallow&quot;, encouraging more drastic approaches to environmental activism. Biocentrism is a central tenet of deep ecology which is described as &quot;a belief that human beings are just an ordinary member of the biological community&quot; and that all living things should have rights and deserve protection under the law. Other eco-terrorists are motivated by different aspects of deep ecology, like the goal to return the environment to its &quot;natural&quot;, i.e., pre-industrial, state.

==Examples of tactics==
There are a wide variety of tactics used by eco-terrorists and groups associated with eco-terrorism. Examples include:

* Tree spiking is a common tactic that was first used by members of Earth First! in 1984. Tree spiking involves hammering small spikes into the trunk of a tree that may be logged with the intention of damaging the chainsaw or mill blades. This may also seriously injure the logger. Only one case of serious injury has been widely reported.
* Arson is a tactic most associated with recent activity in the Earth Liberation Front (ELF). The ELF has been attributed with arsons of sites such as housing developments, SUV dealerships, and chain stores. 
* Bombing, while rare, has been used by eco-terrorists. For example, the Superphénix construction site was attacked with anti-tank rockets (RPG-7). While carried out by environmental activists, the status of the 1976 Bunbury bombing in Australia as an act of terrorism has been debated.
*Monkeywrenching is a tactic popularized by Edward Abbey in his book &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; that involves sabotaging equipment that is environmentally damaging.

==Notable individuals convicted of eco-terrorist crimes==
* Tre Arrow
*Dave Foreman – arrested by the FBI for conspiracy to sabotage a powerline that fed a water pumping station
* James Lee
* Wiebo Ludwig – accused several times for sabotaging oil and gas wells in Alberta, Canada
* Ted Kaczynski
* Jeff Luers
* Marius Mason
* Daniel McGowan – convicted of participation in an arson at a lumber company

==Groups accused==
Organizations accused of eco-terrorism are generally grassroots organizations, do not have a hierarchal structure, and typically favor direct action approaches to their goals.

Stefan Leader characterizes these groups, namely ELF, with having &quot;leaderless resistance&quot; which he describes as &quot;a technique by which terrorist groups can carry out violent acts while reducing the risk of infiltration by law enforcement elements. The basic principle of leaderless resistance is that there is no centralized authority or chain-of-command.&quot; Essentially this consists of independent cells which operate autonomously, sharing goals, but having no central leaders or formal organizational structure. Those who wish to join are typically encouraged to start their own cell, rather than seek out other members and jeopardize their secrecy.

===Organizations in the United States===

Organizations that have been accused of eco-terrorism in the United States include the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Earth First!, The Coalition to Save the Preserves, and the Hardesty Avengers. In 2010, the FBI was criticized in U.S. Justice Department reports for unjustified surveillance (and placement on the Terrorism Watchlist) of about 2000 members of animal rights and environmentalist groups such as Greenpeace and PETA.

In a 2002 testimony to the US Congress, an FBI official mentioned the actions of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in the context of eco-terrorism. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society intervenes against whaling, seal hunting, and fishing operations with direct action tactics. In 1986, the group caused nearly US$1.8 million in damage to equipment used by Icelandic whalers. In 1992, they sabotaged two Japanese ships that were drift-net fishing for squid by cutting their nets and throwing stink bombs on board the boats.

Inspired by Edward Abbey, Earth First! began in 1980. Although the group has been credited with becoming more mainstream, its use of tree spiking during campaigns has been associated with the origins of eco-terrorism. In 1990, Earth First! organizers Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney were injured when a motion-detecting pipe bomb detonated beneath Bari&#x27;s driver seat. Authorities alleged that the bomb was being transported and accidentally detonated. The pair sued investigators, alleging false arrest, illegal search, slanderous statements and conspiracy. In 2002, a jury found that FBI agents and Oakland police officers violated constitutional rights to free speech and protection from unlawful searches of Earth First! organizers.

The Earth Liberation Front, founded in 1992, joined with the Animal Liberation Front, which had its beginnings in England in 1979. They have been connected primarily with arson but claim that they work to harm neither human nor animal. A recent example of ELF arson was the March 2008 &quot;torching of luxury homes in the swank Seattle suburb of Woodinville&quot;. A banner left at the scene claimed the housing development was not green as advertised, and was signed ELF. In September 2009 ELF claimed responsibility for the destruction of two radio towers in Seattle. The FBI in 2001 named the ELF as &quot;one of the most active extremist elements in the United States&quot;, and a &quot;terrorist threat.&quot; The Coalition to Save the Preserves was mentioned in FBI testimony as a group that was responsible for a series of arsons in Arizona. Using similar tactics to the ELF, they have caused more than US$5 million in damages.

Media reports have tied Ted Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, to environmental activists, and say that the 23 injuries and three deaths through letter-bombs were the acts of an independent eco-terrorist. Among those making such accusations were ABC, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and &quot;USA Today&quot;.

A number of &quot;local&quot; organizations have also been indicted under US Federal laws related to eco-terrorism. These include, among others, the group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty.
Another example is the Hardesty Avengers who spiked trees in the Hardesty Mountains in Willamette National Forest in 1984.

In 2008 the Federal Bureau of Investigation said eco-terrorists represented &quot;one of the most serious domestic terrorism threats in the U.S. today&quot; citing the sheer volume of their crimes (over 2,000 since 1979); the huge economic impact (losses of more than US$110 million since 1979); the wide range of victims (from international corporations to lumber companies to animal testing facilities to genetic research firms); and their increasingly violent rhetoric and tactics (one recent communiqué sent to a California product testing company said: &quot;You might be able to protect your buildings, but can you protect the homes of every employee?&quot;).

Unclear, however, is the extent informants and controversial FBI entrapment operations play in creating eco-terrorist groups and furthering criminal acts. In 2015, so-called &quot;green anarchist&quot; Eric McDavid was freed from a 2007 conviction after it was disclosed the FBI operated a program to lure unsuspecting activists via &quot;blatant entrapment.&quot; The 2007 conviction had been cited by the FBI in its 2008 claim eco-terrorism was a significant threat.

The National Animal Interest Alliance in their animal rights extremism archives compiled a comprehensive list of major animal rights extremist and eco-criminal acts of terrorism since 1983.

==US governmental response==
Spiking trees became a federal offense in the United States when it was added to the Drug Act in 1988.

Under the Animal Enterprise Protection Act of 1992 it became a federal crime to &quot;cause more than $10,000 in damage while engaged in &quot;physical disruption to the functioning of an animal enterprise by intentionally stealing, damaging, or causing the loss of any property […] used by the animal enterprise.&quot; In 2006, this was updated and renamed the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act by the 109th congress. The updated act included causing personal harm and the losses incurred on &quot;secondary targets&quot; as well as adding to the penalties for these crimes.

In 2003, a conservative legislative lobbying group, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), proposed the &quot;Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act&quot; which defined an &quot;animal rights or ecological terrorist organization&quot; as &quot;two or more persons organized for the purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity intended to obstruct or deter any person from participating in an activity involving animals or an activity involving natural resources.&quot; The legislation was not enacted.

The FBI has stated that &quot;since 2005…investigations have resulted in indictments against 30 individuals.&quot; In 2006, an FBI case labeled &quot;Operation Backfire&quot; brought charges of domestic terrorism to eleven people associated with the ELF and ALF. &quot;The indictment includes charges related to arson, conspiracy, use of destructive devices, and destruction of an energy facility.&quot; Operation Backfire was a result of the 1998 burning of a ski resort in Vail, Colorado by the group, &quot;The Family.&quot; The incident resulted in $26 million in damages. The FBI joined together with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to convict the individuals and any future eco-terrorist groups.

However, the Bush Justice Department, including the FBI, was criticized in 2010 for improper investigations and prosecutions of left-leaning US protest groups such as Greenpeace. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the &quot;FBI improperly opened and extended investigations of some U.S. activist groups and put members of an environmental advocacy organization on a terrorist watch list, even though they were planning nonviolent civil disobedience, the Justice Department said Monday.&quot;

A report, filed by Inspector General Glenn A. Fine, found the FBI to be not guilty of the most serious charge — according to the &quot;Post&quot; — that &quot;agents targeted domestic groups based on their exercise of First Amendment rights.&quot; The investigation was conducted in response to allegations that the FBI had targeted groups on such grounds during the Bush Administration. The &quot;Post&quot; continued:

<text>Ferguson Wright Hume (8 July 1859 – 12 July 1932), known as Fergus Hume, was a prolific English novelist, known for his detective fiction, thrillers and mysteries.

==Early life==

Hume was born in Powick, Worcestershire, England, the second son of James C. Hume, a Scot and clerk and steward at the County Pauper and Lunatic Asylum there. When he was three the family emigrated to Dunedin, New Zealand, where he was educated at Otago Boys&#x27; High School and studied law at the University of Otago. He was admitted to the New Zealand bar in 1885. Shortly after graduation Hume relocated to Melbourne, Australia, where he obtained a job as a barristers&#x27; clerk. He began writing plays, but found it impossible to persuade the managers of Melbourne theatres to accept or even to read them.

==Rise to fame==
Hume first came to attention after a play he had written, entitled &quot;The Bigamist&quot; was stolen by a rogue called Calthorpe, and presented by him as his own work under the title &quot;The Mormon&quot;. Finding that the novels of Émile Gaboriau were then very popular in Melbourne, Hume obtained and read a set of them and determined to write a novel of the same kind. The result was &quot;The Mystery of a Hansom Cab&quot;, set in Melbourne, with descriptions of poor urban life based on his knowledge of Little Bourke Street. It was self-published in 1886 and became a great success. Because he sold the British and American rights for 50 pounds, however, he reaped little of the potential financial benefit. It became the best-selling mystery novel of the Victorian era; in 1990 John Sutherland called it the &quot;most sensationally popular crime and detective novel of the century&quot;. This novel inspired Arthur Conan Doyle to write &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, which introduced the fictional consulting detective Sherlock Holmes. Doyle remarked, &quot;&quot;Hansom Cab&quot; was a slight tale, mostly sold by &#x27;puffing&#x27;.&quot;

After the success of his first novel and the publication of another, &quot;Professor Brankel&#x27;s Secret&quot; (), Hume returned to England in 1888. His third novel, &quot;Madame Midas&quot;, was based on the life of the mine and newspaper owner Alice Ann Cornwell. After this book became a play her estranged husband, John Whiteman, sued over its content.

==Personal life==

Hume settled back in England, first in London, but after a few years in Thundersley, Essex at Church Cottage, probably at the invitation of the Reverend Thomas Noon Talfourd Major. Hume lived in Thundersley for thirty years, publishing in excess of 130 novels, plus several collections – most of them mystery stories, though he never recaptured the success of his first novel. He also wrote lyrics to songs composed by his brother-in-law, Charles Willeby, and book reviews for literary journals including &quot;The Bookman&quot;.

The 1911 census lists him as ‘author’, aged 51, and living at Church Cottage, Thundersley, which consisted of six rooms. He had a housekeeper, Ada Louise Peck, a widow of 69. He regularly travelled to Italy, France, Switzerland and other European countries.

When the Rev Talfourd Major died in 1915, Hume had to leave Church Cottage. He moved to ‘Rosemary Cottage’, 34 Grandview Road, Thundersley, where he lived with John Joseph Melville and his wife. Melville was a metallurgical chemist by profession, with a special study of alchemy. 

Hume was reputed to be deeply religious and intensely private and known to avoid publicity, but in his later years he lectured at young people&#x27;s clubs and debating societies. He died at Thundersley on 12 July 1932 and lies in an unmarked grave next to an actress and the Rev Maley. All he left in his will were some small items, like a horse blanket and a pipe. His estate was valued at £201.

<text>Sergey Vladimirovich Mikhalkov (; 27 August 2009) was a Soviet and Russian author of children&#x27;s books and satirical fables. He wrote the lyrics for the Soviet and Russian national anthems.

==Life and career==
Born in Moscow, into the noble Mikhalkov family, as the son of Vladimir Aleksandrovich Mikhalkov and Olga Mikhailovna (née Glebova). Since the 1930s, he has rivaled Korney Chukovsky, Samuil Marshak and Agniya Barto as the most popular poet writing for Russophone children. His poems about enormously tall &quot;Uncle Styopa&quot; (&quot;Дядя Стёпа&quot;) enjoyed particular popularity. Uncle Styopa is a friendly policeman always ready to rescue cats stuck up trees, and to perform other helpful deeds. In English, his name translates as Uncle Steeple.

As a 29-year-old in 1942, Mikhalkov&#x27;s work drew the attention of the Soviet Union&#x27;s leader Joseph Stalin, who commissioned him to write lyrics for a new national anthem. At the time, the country was deeply embroiled in World War II and Stalin wanted a more patriotic theme for the national anthem, to replace The Internationale.

Mikhalkov penned words with writer El-Registan (1899–1945) to accompany a musical score by the composer Alexander Alexandrov (1883–1946) that became known as State Anthem of the Soviet Union. The new anthem was presented to Stalin in the summer of 1943 and was introduced as the country&#x27;s new anthem on 1 January 1944.

Upon the death of Stalin in 1953, the lyrics, which mentioned him by name, were discarded during the process of de-Stalinization and the anthem continued to be used without words. Mikhalkov wrote new lyrics in 1970, but they were not submitted to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet until 27 May 1977. The new lyrics, which removed any reference to Stalin, were approved on 1 September and were made official with the printing of the new Soviet Constitution in October 1977.

During the Soviet era, Mikhalkov and his wife, Natalia Konchalovskaya, sometimes worked for the KGB, for example by presenting undercover KGB staff officers to foreign diplomats, as in the case of French ambassador Maurice Dejean, who was compromised by the KGB in the 1950s. His younger brother Mikhail Mikhalkov was also a notable writer as well as a KGB agent.

Use of the Soviet anthem, with Mikhalkov&#x27;s lyrics, continued until 1991, when it was retired by President Boris Yeltsin after the USSR dissolved. However, when Vladimir Putin took over from Yeltsin in 2000, he began to clamor for a restoration of Alexandrov&#x27;s music in place of Yeltsin&#x27;s choice.

Mikhalkov was 87 years old by this time and long since retired; in fact, younger Russian generations likely knew him better as the father of popular filmmakers Nikita Mikhalkov and Andrei Konchalovsky, the latter of which had dropped part of his name &quot;Mikhalkov-Konchalovsky&quot; when he left Russia. But when Putin&#x27;s push to restore the old anthem began to pick up momentum, Mikhalkov decided to write new lyrics to go with Alexandrov&#x27;s score. The result was the National Anthem of Russia, which was officially adopted on 30 December 2000.

Apart from the national anthem, Mikhalkov produced a great number of satirical plays and provided scripts for several Soviet comedies. He also successfully revived a long derelict genre of satirical fable. He was awarded three Stalin Prizes (1941, 1942, 1950) and numerous other awards.

On Mikhalkov&#x27;s 90th birthday in 2003, Putin personally visited him at his home in Moscow to present him with the Order &quot;For Merit to the Fatherland&quot;, 2nd class, citing him for his contributions to the culture of Russia. Mikhalkov was also decorated with a Hero of Socialist Labour and the Order of Lenin, among others, for his work during the Soviet period.

Mikhalkov died in Moscow on 27 August 2009, at the age of 96. His funeral, held at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, was attended by family, friends, and government officials. He was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow with full military honors.
==Personal life==

In 1936, Mikhalkov married Natalia Petrovna Konchalovskaya (1903–1988), granddaughter of Vasily Surikov. They remained married for 53 years until her death. In 1997, Mikhalkov married physics professor Yulia Valeryevna Subbotina.

<text>Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov ( – 8 July 1946, born Koptelov or Koptelev) was a Soviet and Russian composer and founder of the Alexandrov Ensemble, who wrote the music for the State Anthem of the Soviet Union, which in 2000 became the national anthem of Russia (with new lyrics). During his career, he also worked as a professor of the Moscow Conservatory, and became a Doctor of Arts. His work was recognized by the awards of the title of People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR and two Stalin Prizes.

==Background==
Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov, known as Sasha, was born on 13 April 1883 in Plakhino, a village in Ryazan Governorate south-east of Moscow. As a boy, his singing was so impressive that he traveled to Saint Petersburg to become a chorister at Kazan Cathedral.

==Career==
A pupil of Medtner, Alexandrov studied composition at Saint Petersburg and in Moscow, where he eventually became professor of music in 1918 and choirmaster at Christ the Savior from 1918 to 1922.

===Alexandrov Ensemble===

Alexandrov founded the Alexandrov Ensemble, and spent many years as its director, in which role he gained favor with Joseph Stalin, the country&#x27;s ruler during the last two decades of Alexandrov&#x27;s life. His choir participated successfully in the Universal Exposition of 1937 in Paris. 

===Works===
In 1942, Stalin commissioned Alexandrov and lyricists Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El-Registan to create a new Soviet national anthem, which was officially adopted on 1 January 1944 and was used by the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. It became the National Anthem of Russia in December 2000, with Mikhalkov writing the new lyrics. Alexandrov also composed the 1941 call to arms, &quot;The Sacred War&quot;, and the official march of the Soviet and now Russian Armed Forces, the Song of the Soviet Army. His works include a number of settings of various Russian folk songs, for example, &quot;Utushka lugovaya&quot;.

== Death ==
Alexandrov had a heart attack and died on 8 July 1946 at the age of 63, while on tour in Berlin; some records say he was returning from Germany.

<doc id="303544" wikidata="Q131729" url="?curid=303544" title="Lawrence Bragg">
<text>Sir William Lawrence Bragg (31 March 1890 – 1 July 1971), known as Lawrence Bragg, was an Australian-born British physicist and X-ray crystallographer, discoverer (1912) of Bragg&#x27;s law of X-ray diffraction, which is basic for the determination of crystal structure. He was joint recipient (with his father, William Henry Bragg) of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1915, &quot;For their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays&quot;; an important step in the development of X-ray crystallography.

Bragg was knighted in 1941. As of 2024, he is the youngest ever Nobel laureate in physics, or in any science category, having received the award at the age of 25. Bragg was the director of the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was reported by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in February 1953.

==Education and early life==
Bragg was born in Adelaide, South Australia to William Henry Bragg (1862–1942), Elder Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Adelaide, and Gwendoline (1869–1929), daughter of Charles Todd, government astronomer of South Australia.

In 1900, Bragg was a student at Queen&#x27;s School, North Adelaide, followed by five years at St Peter&#x27;s College, Adelaide. He went to the University of Adelaide at the age of 16 to study mathematics, chemistry and physics, graduating in 1908. In the same year his father accepted the Cavendish chair of physics at the University of Leeds, and brought the family to England. Bragg enrolled at the University of Cambridge as an undergraduate student of Trinity College, Cambridge in the autumn of 1909, receiving a major scholarship in mathematics, despite taking the exam while in bed with pneumonia. After initially excelling in mathematics, he transferred to the physics course in the later years of his studies, and graduated with first class honours in 1911. In 1914 Bragg was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College – a Fellowship at a Cambridge college involves the submission and defence of a thesis.

Among Bragg&#x27;s other interests was shell collecting; his personal collection amounted to specimens from some 500 species; all personally collected from South Australia. He discovered a new species of cuttlefish – &quot;Sepia braggi&quot;, named for him by Joseph Verco.

===Career===
====X-rays and the Bragg equation====
The composition of X-rays was unknown, his father argued that X-rays are streams of particles, others argued that they are waves. Max von Laue directed an X-ray beam at a crystal in front of a photographic plate; alongside of the spot where the beam struck there were additional spots from deflected rays – hence X-rays are waves. In 1912, as a first-year research student at Cambridge, W. L. Bragg, while strolling by the river, had the insight that crystals made from parallel sheets of atoms would not diffract X-ray beams that struck their surface at most angles because X-rays deflected by collisions with atoms would be out of phase, cancelling one another out. However, when the X-ray beam struck at an angle at which the distances it passed between atomic sheets in the crystal equalled the X-ray&#x27;s wavelength then those deflected would be in phase and produce a spot on a nearby film. From this insight he wrote the simple Bragg equation that relates the wavelength of the X-ray and the distance between atomic sheets in a simple crystal to the angles at which an impinging X-ray beam would be reflected.

His father built an apparatus in which a crystal could be rotated to precise angles while measuring the energy of reflections. This enabled father and son to measure the distances between the atomic sheets in a number of simple crystals. They calculated the spacing of the atoms from the weight of the crystal and the Avogadro constant, which enabled them to measure the wavelengths of the X-rays produced by different metallic targets in the X-ray tubes. W. H. Bragg reported their results at meetings and in a paper, giving credit to &quot;his son&quot; (unnamed) for the equation, but not as a co-author, which gave his son &quot;some heartaches&quot;, which he never overcame.

====Work on sound ranging====
Bragg was commissioned early in World War I in the Royal Horse Artillery as a second lieutenant of the Leicestershire battery. In 1915 he was seconded to the Royal Engineers to develop a method to localise enemy artillery from the boom of their firing. On 2 September 1915 his brother was killed during the Gallipoli Campaign. Shortly afterwards, he and his father were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. He was 25 years old and remains the youngest science laureate. The problem with sound ranging was that the heavy guns boomed at too low a frequency to be detected by a microphone. After months of frustrating failure he and his group devised a hot wire air wave detector that solved the problem. In this work he was aided by Charles Galton Darwin, William Sansome Tucker, Harold Roper Robinson, Edward Andrade and Henry Harold Hemming. British sound ranging was very effective; there was a unit in every British Army and their system was adopted by the Americans when they entered the war. For his work during the war he was awarded the Military Cross and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). He was also mentioned in dispatches on 16 June 1916, 4 January 1917 and 7 July 1919.

Hot wire sound ranging was used in World War II during which he served as a civilian adviser.

Between the wars, from 1919 to 1937, he worked at the Victoria University of Manchester as Langworthy Professor of Physics. He became the director of the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington in 1937.

After World War II, Bragg returned to Cambridge, splitting the Cavendish Laboratory into research groups. He believed that &quot;the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants&quot;.

====University of Manchester (1919–1937)====

When demobilised he returned to crystallography at Cambridge. They had agreed that father would study organic crystals, son would investigate inorganic compounds. In 1919 when Ernest Rutherford, a long-time family friend, moved to Cambridge, Lawrence Bragg replaced him as Langworthy Professor of Physics at the Victoria University of Manchester. He recruited an excellent faculty, including former sound rangers, but he believed that his knowledge of physics was weak and he had no classroom experience. The students, many veterans, were critical and rowdy. He was deeply shaken but with family support he pulled himself together and prevailed. He and R. W. James measured the absolute energy of reflected X-rays, which validated a formula derived by C. G. Darwin before the war. Now they could determine the number of electrons in the reflecting targets, and they were able to decipher the structures of more complicated crystals like silicates. It was still difficult: requiring repeated guessing and retrying. In the late 1920s they eased the analysis by using Fourier transforms on the data.

In 1930, he became deeply disturbed while considering a job offer from Imperial College London. His family rallied around and he recovered his balance while they spent 1931 in Munich, where he did research.

==== National Physical Laboratory (1937–1938)====
He became director of the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington in 1937, bringing some co-workers along. However, administration and committees took much of his time away from the workbench.

====University of Cambridge (1938–1954)====
Rutherford died and the search committee named Lawrence Bragg as next in the line of the Cavendish Professors who direct the Cavendish Laboratory. The Laboratory had an eminent history in atomic physics and some members were wary of a crystallographer, which Bragg surmounted by even-handed administration. He worked on improving the interpretation of diffraction patterns. In the small crystallography group was a refugee research student without a mentor: Max Perutz. He showed Bragg X-ray diffraction data from haemoglobin, which suggested that the structure of giant biological molecules might be deciphered. Bragg appointed Perutz as his research assistant and within a few months obtained additional support with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The work was suspended during the Second World War when Perutz was interned as an enemy alien and then worked in military research.

During the war the Cavendish offered a shortened graduate course which emphasised the electronics needed for radar. Bragg worked on the structure of metals and consulted on sonar and sound ranging, for which the Tucker microphone was still used. Bragg was knighted and became Sir Lawrence in 1941. After his father died in 1942, Bragg served for six months as Scientific Liaison Officer to Canada. He also organised periodic conferences on X-ray analysis, which was widely used in military research.

After the war Bragg led in the formation of the International Union of Crystallography and was elected its first president. He reorganised the Cavendish into units to reflect his conviction that &quot;the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants, helped by one or more first-class instrument mechanics and a workshop in which the general run of apparatus can be constructed.&quot; Senior members of staff now had offices, telephones, and secretarial support. The scope of the department was enlarged with a new unit on radio astronomy. Bragg&#x27;s own work focused on the structure of metals, using both X-rays and the electron microscope. In 1947 he persuaded the Medical Research Council (MRC) to support what he described as the &quot;gallant attempt&quot; to determine protein structure as the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, initially consisting of Perutz, John Kendrew and two assistants. Bragg worked with them and by 1960 they had resolved the structure of myoglobin to the atomic level. After this Bragg was less involved; their analysis of haemoglobin was easier after they incorporated two mercury atoms as markers in each molecule. The first monumental triumph of the MRC was decoding the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick. Bragg announced the discovery at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953, though it went unreported by the press. He then gave a talk at Guy&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in London on Thursday, 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by Ritchie Calder in the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; of London on Friday, 15 May 1953, entitled &quot;Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life&quot;. Bragg nominated Crick, Watson and Maurice Wilkins for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Wilkins&#x27; share recognised the contribution of X-ray crystallographers at King&#x27;s College London. Among them was Rosalind Franklin, whose &quot;photograph 51&quot; showed that DNA was a double helix, not the triple helix that Linus Pauling had proposed. Franklin died before the prize (which only goes to living people) was awarded.

====The Royal Institution (1954–1971)====
In 1953 the Braggs moved into the elegant flat for the Resident Professor in the Royal Institution in London, the position his father had occupied when he died. In 1934 and 1961 Lawrence had delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture and since 1938 he had been Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Institution, delivering an annual lecture. His father&#x27;s successors had weakened the Institution, so Bragg had to rebuild it. He bolstered finances by enlisting corporate sponsors, the traditional Friday Evening Discourses were followed by a dinner party for the speaker and carefully selected possible patrons, more than 120 of them each year. &quot;Two of these Discourses in 1965 gave him particular pleasure. On 7 May, Lady Bragg, who had been a member of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1951–55) and was Chairman of the National Marriage Guidance Council, lectured on &#x27;Changing patterns in marriage and divorce&#x27;; and on 15 November, Bragg listened with evident pride to the Discourse on &#x27;Oscillations and noise in jet engines&#x27; given by his engineer-son Stephen, who was then Chief Scientist at Rolls-Royce Ltd and later became Vice-Chancellor of Brunel University.&quot; He also introduced a programme of highly regarded Schools&#x27; Lectures, enlivened by the elaborate demonstrations that were a hallmark of the Institution. He gave three of these lectures on &quot;electricity&quot;.

He continued research in the Institution by recruiting a small group to work in the Davy-Faraday Laboratory in the basement and in the adjoining house, supported by grants he obtained. A visitor to the laboratory succeeded in inserting heavy metals into the enzyme lysozyme; the structure of its crystal was solved in 1965 at the Royal Institution by David Chilton Phillips and his coworkers, with the computations on the 9,040 reflections performed on the digital computer at the University of London, which greatly facilitated the work. Two of the illustrations of the positioning of amino acids in the chain were drawn by Bragg. Unlike myoglobin, in which nearly 80 per cent of the amino-acid residues are in the alpha-helix conformation, in lysozyme the alpha-helix content is only about 40 per cent of the amino-acid residues found in four main stretches. Other stretches are of the 310 helix, a conformation that they had proposed earlier. In this conformation, every third peptide is hydrogen-bonded back to the first peptide, thus forming a ring containing ten atoms. They had the complete structure of an enzyme in time for Bragg&#x27;s 75th birthday. He became Professor Emeritus in 1966.

X-ray analysis of protein structure flourished in subsequent years, determining the structures of scores of proteins in laboratories around the world. Twenty eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work using X-ray analysis. The disadvantage of the method is that it must be done on crystals, which precludes seeing changes in shape when enzymes bind substrates and the like. This problem was solved by the development of another line Bragg had initiated, using modified electron microscopes to image single frozen molecules: cryo-electron microscopy.

In his long association with the Royal Institution he was:

*Professor of Natural Philosophy, 1938–1953
*Fullerian Professor of Chemistry, 1954–1966
*Superintendent of the House, 1954–1966
*Director of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory, 1954–1966
*Director of the Royal Institution, 1965–1966
*Emeritus Professor, 1966–1971

===Personal life===
In 1921 he married Alice Hopkinson (1899–1989), a cousin of a Cecil Hopkinson (1891–1917) who shared rooms with Bragg, and was one of his closest friends whilst they were both studying at Cambridge. Cecil was the son of John Hopkinson who was Alice&#x27;s uncle.

They had four children, the engineer Stephen Lawrence (1923–2014), David William (1926–2005), Margaret Alice (1931–2022) (who married the diplomat Mark Heath), and Patience Mary (1935–2020) (who married David, the son of George Paget Thomson the Nobel prize winning physicist). Alice was on the staff at Withington Girls&#x27; School until Bragg was appointed director of the National Physical Laboratory in 1937. She was active in a number of public bodies and served as Mayor of Cambridge from 1945 to 1946.

Bragg&#x27;s hobbies included drawing – family letters were illustrated with lively sketches – painting, literature and a lifelong interest in gardening. When he moved to London, he missed having a garden and so worked as a part-time gardener, unrecognised by his employer, until a guest at the house expressed surprise at seeing him there. He died at a hospital near his home at Waldringfield, Ipswich, Suffolk. He was buried in Trinity College, Cambridge; his son David is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, his grave is within a few paces of that of Bragg&#x27;s close friend, Rudolph Cecil Hopkinson, who incurred a severe head wound in the 1914–19 war and died a few months after being invalided back to the UK.

In August 2013, Bragg&#x27;s relative, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, presented a BBC Radio 4 programme (&quot;Bragg on the Braggs&quot;) on the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics winners.

==Honours and awards==

Bragg was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1921 – &quot;a qualification that makes other ones irrelevant&quot;. He was knighted by King George VI in the 1941 New Year Honours, and received both the Copley Medal and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society. Although Graeme Hunter, in his book on Bragg &quot;Light is a Messenger&quot;, argued that he was more a crystallographer than a physicist, Bragg&#x27;s lifelong activity showed otherwise—he was more of a physicist than anything else. Thus, from 1939 to 1943, he served as President of the Institute of Physics, London. In the 1967 New Year Honours he was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour by Queen Elizabeth II.

Since 1967 the Institute of Physics has awarded the Lawrence Bragg Medal and Prize. Additionally since 1992, the Australian Institute of Physics has awarded the Bragg Gold Medal for Excellence in Physics to commemorate Lawrence Bragg (in front on the medal) and his father, William Bragg, for the best PhD thesis by a student at an Australian university.

<doc id="303545" wikidata="Q601627" url="?curid=303545" title="Mike Weaver (boxer)">
<text>Michael Dwayne Weaver (born June 13, 1951) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1972 to 2000, and held the WBA heavyweight title from 1980 to 1982. He is widely regarded as one of the Best Heavyweight Boxers of the 1980s beating Heavyweight Champions such as Gerrie Coetzee and John Tate.

==Marines==
Weaver was a member of the United States Marine Corps from 1968 to 1971, and went to Vietnam. During this time he started amateur boxing and training.

==Professional career==
===Early years===
By 1972 Weaver was living and training in California, and took up professional boxing. In his early career, Weaver was considered a journeyman opponent. He was frequently brought in on short notice and overmatched against more experienced and developed contenders, and used as a sparring partner for Muhammad Ali and Ken Norton, who famously nicknamed him &quot;Hercules&quot; due to his top developed muscle definition.

In 1976 Weaver beat well regarded veteran Jody Ballard, and in 1978 lost two close decisions. First to contender Stan Ward for the California State Heavyweight title, and then to Leroy Jones for the NABF heavyweight title.

===Heavyweight contender===
In late 1978 Weaver got a new team and manager and reeled off five straight knockouts, two of which came over top ranked opponents. In October 1978 he came off the floor to knock out hard hitting Colombian Bernardo Mercado in 5, and in January 1979 knocked out hulking old foe Stan Ward in 9 to win the USBA heavyweight title.

===WBC heavyweight title challenge against Larry Holmes===
These wins helped get him a high-profile world title fight against undefeated WBC champion Larry Holmes in New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden in June 1979. New cable channel HBO bought the rights to the fight as Weaver was so lowly-regarded the fight was seen as a mismatch and the networks didn&#x27;t want anything to do with it (Weaver was 20–8 to Holmes&#x27; 30–0).

But, in a brutal contest, Weaver proved far better than expected, however, and gave Holmes a really tough battle. Holmes would rally by decking Weaver with a sharp uppercut in the 11th and in the 12th, Holmes pounded Weaver with powerful rights until the referee stopped the fight.

===USBA heavyweight title contest===
Although Weaver had lost, his surprise showing had made him a deserved high-profile name. Later in the year he was back, retaining his USBA belt with a 12-round decision over Scott LeDoux whom he outboxed rather than slugged with. Using his jab a lot gaining complimentary reviews generally.

===WBA heavyweight champion===
In March 1980, Weaver fought John Tate for the WBA title, in Tate&#x27;s backyard of Knoxville, Tennessee. Tate was an amateur star from the 1976 Olympic team. As a pro he had put together a 20–0 record and won the vacant WBA title by decisioning South African Gerrie Coetzee over fifteen rounds, in front of 86,000 hostile fans in Pretoria, South Africa.

Weaver vs. Tate produced one of the divisions finest knockouts ever. The taller Tate dominated Weaver for all the first 10 rounds. But then with sheer determination a battered Weaver suddenly turned it around, pushing Tate backward. But he&#x27;d left it too late, according to the commentators, as only 5 rounds remained and Tate was expected to resume his lead. However, with only 40 seconds left in the 15th round, Weaver caught Tate bouncing off the ropes towards him with a devastating left hook. It dropped Tate to the canvas out cold for well over a minute. Press pictures showed Tate sound asleep whilst Weaver did a handstand alongside to celebrate.

In October 1980 Weaver made his first defense, traveling to Sun City, South Africa, to fight Gerrie Coetzee. Weaver was hurt and nearly knocked down in the 8th round but rallied down the stretch and knocked Coetzee out in the 13th round. Coetzee, a good boxer/puncher, had never previously been down, amateur or pro.

In 1981 Weaver outpointed the spoiler James &quot;Quick&quot; Tillis over 15 rounds in Chicago to retain his title after a year&#x27;s inactivity.

===Losing the title to Michael Dokes; controversy===

After another year&#x27;s inactivity, Weaver took on highly regarded Michael Dokes in Las Vegas, December 10, 1982. Dokes came out fast and dropped Weaver inside the opening minute. As Weaver covered up on the ropes and Dokes missed a few swings, referee Joey Curtis stopped the fight after 1:03 had passed and awarded Dokes the victory by technical knockout. This caused controversy due to the timing of the stoppage, and many in the arena accused the fight of being fixed.

However, four weeks earlier, the fatal fight between Ray Mancini and Duk Koo Kim at Caesars&#x27; Palace had taken place where Kim died as a result of a brain injury. On the morning of the fight, Nevada State Athletic Commission officials warned all officials participating in the card to protect the health of the boxers in order to avoid another potential fight-related fatality, which Curtis responded, &quot;Everybody has Duk Koo Kim in the back of his mind,&quot; referring to the November 13 fight, as Dr. Lonnie Hammargren, a doctor who had performed brain surgery in a futile attempt to save Kim, attended the meeting. (ESPN later ranked this the #7 worst bad call by a referee in a fight, doing so in 2008.)

Weaver was given a rematch with Dokes on May 20, 1983, which ended in a 15-round majority draw; judge Jerry Roth gave Dokes a four-point victory while judges Harold Lederman and Larry Hazzard had it even.

===Further title challenges and later career===
In June 1985 Weaver took on Pinklon Thomas, who then held the WBC title. Weaver lost by eighth-round knockout. This would be Weaver&#x27;s last title challenge although a notable 2nd-round KO of Carl &quot;The Truth&quot; Williams a skilled boxer would follow the defeat to Thomas. Weaver continued to fight for another 15 years. His career ended at the age of 49 with a sixth-round KO rematch loss to Larry Holmes.
