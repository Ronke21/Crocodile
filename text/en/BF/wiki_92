<text>Ed, Edd n Eddy is an animated television series created by Danny Antonucci for Cartoon Network. The series revolves around three friends named Ed, Edd (nicknamed &quot;Double D&quot; to avoid confusion with Ed), and Eddy—collectively known as &quot;the Eds&quot;—who are voiced by Matt Hill, Sam Vincent and Tony Sampson respectively. They live in a suburban cul-de-sac in the fictional town of Peach Creek along with fellow neighbourhood children Kevin, Nazz, Sarah, Jimmy, Rolf, Jonny, and the Eds&#x27; female adversaries, the Kanker Sisters, Lee, Marie and May. Under the unofficial leadership of Eddy, the trio frequently invents schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favourite confection, jawbreakers. Their plans usually fail, leaving them in various, often humiliating and painful, predicaments.

Antonucci, an adult cartoonist, was dared to create a children&#x27;s cartoon. While designing a commercial, he conceived &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot;, designing it to resemble classic cartoons from the 1940s–1970s. When pitching the series to Nickelodeon, the network declined to give him creative control, a deal to which Antonucci did not agree. He then pitched the series to Cartoon Network. A deal was made with the network to commission the series under his control, and it premiered on January 4, 1999. During the show&#x27;s run, several specials and shorts were produced in addition to the regular television series. The series concluded with a television film, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Big Picture Show&quot;, on November 8, 2009.

&quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; received critical acclaim and became one of Cartoon Network&#x27;s most successful original series. It won a Reuben Award, two Leo Awards and a SOCAN Award, and was also nominated for another four Leo Awards, an Annie Award and two Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. The show attracted an audience of 31 million households, was broadcast in 120 countries, and proved to be popular among children, teenagers, and adults. The series has also included spin-off media such as video games, DVD releases, and a series of books and comic books featuring characters from the series. With over a 10-year run, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; would become the longest running singular Cartoon Network original series. The series also was broadcast on Teletoon in Canada.

==Premise==
&quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; follows the lives of &quot;the Eds&quot;, three scheming boys who all share variations of nicknames of the name Edward, but differ greatly in their personalities: Ed (Matt Hill) is the strong and dim-witted yet kind-hearted dogsbody of the group; Edd (Samuel Vincent), called Double D, is an inventor, neat freak, and the most intelligent of the Eds; and Eddy (Tony Sampson) is a devious, quick-tempered, arrogant con artist, and self-appointed leader of the Eds. The three devise plans to obtain money from the other kids in their cul-de-sac, which they want to use to buy jawbreakers. However, problems always ensue, and the Eds&#x27; schemes usually end in failure and humiliation.

The cul-de-sac kids do not include the Eds as part of their group, making the trio outcasts. The group of kids are Jonny (David Paul &quot;Buck&quot; Grove), a loner whom his peers consider to be a nuisance, and spends most of his time with his imaginary friend, a wooden board named Plank; Jimmy (Keenan Christensen), a weak, insecure, and accident-prone child, who is most often seen spending his time with Sarah (Janyse Jaud), Ed&#x27;s spoiled and ill-tempered younger sister who is attracted to Edd; Rolf (Peter Kelamis), an immigrant whose customs often differ from the other children&#x27;s; Kevin (Kathleen Barr), a cynical and sardonic jock who detests the Eds, particularly Eddy; Nazz (Tabitha St. Germain; Jenn Forgie; Erin Fitzgerald), usually seen with Kevin, is a calm and friendly blonde girl who the Eds, Jonny, and Kevin are infatuated with. All of the cul-de-sac kids share a common fear of the Kanker Sisters, Lee (Janyse Jaud), May (Erin Fitzgerald; Jenn Forgie), and Marie (Kathleen Barr), three bully girls led by Lee who live in a nearby trailer park and romantically harass the Eds. Each Kanker has a preference for who they wish to date and marry among the three, with Lee wanting Eddy, Marie wanting Edd, and May wanting Ed.

Aside from the Eds, the other cul-de-sac kids, and the Kanker Sisters, no other characters appeared in the series until Santa Claus had a cameo in &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Jingle Jingle Jangle&quot;, flying over Peach Creek to quickly drop off presents. During the fifth season, silhouettes of other people were occasionally shown, and in &quot;Mission Ed-Possible&quot;, the arms of Eddy&#x27;s father and Ed&#x27;s mother were seen. An arm of Eddy&#x27;s mother was also shown during &quot;Smile for the Ed&quot;. In the series finale, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Big Picture Show&quot;, Eddy&#x27;s adult brother (Terry Klassen) was seen for the first time, making him the only non-main character, and the only adult character to ever fully appear on the show. The series took place mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new locations were rarely introduced. Its first four seasons are set during a seemingly endless summer vacation, though from the fifth season onwards, the characters are shown attending junior high school in the fall and winter months.

==Production==
===Development===

Although cartoonist Danny Antonucci began his career by working as an animator on various children&#x27;s series for Hanna-Barbera, his later solo works were edgy and aimed at adult audiences. He gained notoriety with the 1987 short film &quot;Lupo the Butcher&quot; and then, after founding his own production studio, a.k.a. Cartoon in 1994, created the series &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot; for MTV. It was quickly cancelled, however, upon being met with generally poor reviews.

On a dare, Antonucci then decided that he would try producing a children&#x27;s animated series of his own. While designing a commercial, he ended up drawing three characters that he felt particularly pleased with. Growing excited over their potential, he named them Ed, Edd, and Eddy and spent the following months developing a show around them. In 1996, he faxed a one-page concept sheet and pitched the series to Nickelodeon, but the network declined to give him creative control, and Antonucci refused. He then pitched the series to Cartoon Network. The network agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show, and conversations between him and the studio continued.

Vice president of programming and production of Cartoon Network, Mike Lazzo, showed high interest in the series and requested a show bible, which came through by fax, a few pages at a time, over a period of the next few months. After an affirmative response from Cartoon Network president Betty Cohen, the legal paperwork and deal-making began, followed by a start-up meeting at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles. A deal was made that Antonucci&#x27;s studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot;, making it the first Cartoon Network original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Cartoon Network&#x27;s Hanna-Barbera. The series also entered production and bypassed a seven-minute short; this marked the first time that one of the studio&#x27;s original series had ever done this.

According to Antonucci, he based the characters on real people in his life. The personalities of Ed, Double D, and Eddy are based on his own traits as well as the activities of his two sons, while the cul-de-sac children and the Kanker sisters were all based on children he grew up with. Rolf is based on Antonucci and his cousins, since he was part of an Italian immigrant family, and grew up in a first-generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living, compared to those born in Canada.

Jimmy is based on one of his cousins, who was rather feminine and spent most of his time playing with girls rather than with boys. Jonny and Plank are inspired by one of Antonucci&#x27;s childhood friends, a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket. He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, and that he, &quot;thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own&quot; and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do. Some wanted Plank to be able to talk, smile and blink as if he was alive, but Antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood, brought to life by Jonny&#x27;s imagination.

===Casting===
Matt Hill, Samuel Vincent, and Tony Sampson were respectively cast as Ed, Edd, and Eddy. David Paul &quot;Buck&quot; Grove and Keenan Christensen played the parts of Jonny 2×4 and Jimmy, respectively, while Sarah was voiced by Janyse Jaud. Peter Kelamis voiced Rolf, while Kathleen Barr was cast as Kevin. Nazz was voiced by Tabitha St. Germain in season 1, Jenn Forgie in season 3, and Erin Fitzgerald in seasons 2, 4, 5, and 6. Fitzgerald also played the part of May, one of the Kanker Sisters, except in season 3 when she was voiced by Jenn Forgie. The other two Kanker sisters, Marie and Lee, were voiced by Kathleen Barr and Janyse Jaud. Eddy&#x27;s adult brother is mentioned frequently throughout the series but does not appear until &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Big Picture Show&quot;, where he is voiced by series voice director Terry Klassen.

===Animation===
Antonucci, an advocate of hand-drawn animation, wanted to ensure &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; was produced in a way similar to cartoons from the 1940s to 1970s. As a result, the series was the last major animated series to use traditional cel animation. Cels were shipped to South Korea at Yesoo Animation Studios for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci&#x27;s a.k.a. Cartoon studio.

To give the impression of movement, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; uses &quot;&quot; or shimmering outlines which Antonucci likens to cartoons of the 1930s. IGN has compared it to Squigglevision, and Animation World Magazine wrote that the way the line varies and shakes gives the animation a distinctive and spontaneous feeling as if it were drawn by children. The boiling line is created by tracing off a drawing three times through sheets of paper. Antonucci explained that he felt it &quot;helps keep the characters alive&quot; and that he wanted to depart from other Cartoon Network series and pay homage to the classic cartoon era.

All the children have multicoloured tongues; Antonucci said that the idea came after he saw his son and his friends with different-coloured tongues because of eating different candy while he was working on a storyboard. The characters went through several &quot;walking cycles,&quot; a process used to determine how each character should walk or run, turn around, blink, etc. before the crew came up with the final product.

===Music and title sequence===
Antonucci showed the theme song to the studios when first pitching the series, thinking it would be better than only looking at drawings. It was inspired by the Bob Crosby and The Bob Cats song &quot;Big Noise from Winnetka,&quot; which was whistled, something Antonucci enjoyed doing as a child. Composed by Patric Caird, who created all the music in the series, Antonucci performed the whistling himself. Paul Boyd created the show&#x27;s title sequence. The music of &quot;Ed, Edd, n Eddy&quot; is heavily influenced by 1930s and 1940s jazz and jump blues, rockabilly, boogie woogie, and the rock and roll of the 1950s.

===Broadcast===
Although &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; was originally set to premiere on November 16, 1998, at 8:00 PM, the pilot, &quot;The Ed-touchables / Nagged to Ed,&quot; aired on January 4, 1999, as the sixth Cartoon Cartoon, due to minor post-production delays. It was the first Cartoon Cartoon to not have been produced by Hanna-Barbera/Cartoon Network Studios. During the series&#x27; original run, episodes often aired as a part of Cartoon Network&#x27;s weekly programming block &quot;Cartoon Cartoon Fridays.&quot;

Cartoon Network ran several marathons for either commercial promotions or special airings of one of their shows. The eight-hour &quot;Boy Girl, Boy Girl&quot; marathon ran on March 7, 1999, airing episodes of &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, which had been Cartoon Network&#x27;s two newest series at the time. Later that year, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; was featured with other original Cartoon Network series in the third annual &quot;Cartoon Cartoon Weekend,&quot; a fifty-three-hour marathon, which ran from August 20 to August 22. In 2002, the show was included in the similar &quot;Cartoon Cartoon Marathon Weekend,&quot; which ran from August 23 to August 25. The six-hour &quot;Ed&#x27;s Day Off Marathon&quot; aired 22 episodes on January 19, 2004, in celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

&quot;The Best Day Edder,&quot; in which every episode was shown in chronological order, ran from April 27 to April 28, 2007, and ended with the previously unaired season five finale, which was promoted as the &quot;final episode ever.&quot; However, it was quickly followed by &quot;The Eds are Coming&quot; the following month, as part of a special alien-themed event called &quot;Cartoon Network Invaded.&quot; As of May 2, 2007, &quot;The Best Day Edder&quot; provided Cartoon Network their best ratings of the year. A seven-hour Sunday marathon, which ran before the premiere of &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Big Picture Show&quot;, posted double-digit delivery gains among children ages 9–14 (up 14%), boys ages 9–14 (up 16%) and girls ages 6–11 (up 17%), compared to the same time frame last year, highlighting the network&#x27;s weekend performance.

At the July 2007 San Diego Comic-Con, a cut segment from the season four finale &quot;Take This Ed and Shove It&quot; was screened at the &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; panel. The series&#x27; fourth season was originally ordered as the last, but two additional seasons and four specials, including a movie, were ordered as a result of the series&#x27; popularity. The series finale is a movie titled &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Big Picture Show&quot;, which aired on November 8, 2009.

==Episodes==

===Specials===
Along with an additional fifth and sixth season, Cartoon Network ordered three holiday specials that originally aired in 2004 and 2005. &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Jingle Jingle Jangle,&quot; the first, is a Christmas special aired on December 3, 2004. Valentine&#x27;s Day&#x27;s &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Hanky Panky Hullabaloo&quot; originally aired on February 11, 2005. The final, Halloween special, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Boo Haw Haw&quot; aired on October 28, 2005. Antonucci stated that &quot;Boo Haw Haw&quot; was one of his favourite &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; episodes that he worked on. On May 11, 2007, a fourth special, &quot;The Eds are Coming&quot; aired; however, it was not a holiday special, but an adjunct to other Cartoon Network series &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;, &quot;My Gym Partner&#x27;s a Monkey&quot;, &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;, and &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; in the alien-themed mini-series Cartoon Network Invaded that aired all five specials from May 4 to May 28, 2007.

==Appearances in other series or works==
Besides their own series, Ed, Double D, and Eddy have also appeared in other cartoon series. They appeared in the &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; episode &quot;Eddie Monster&quot; and were drawn using that series&#x27; style of animation, and made a short cameo in &quot;The Grim Adventures of the KND&quot;, a crossover of &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; and &quot;&quot;. They also appeared on a small crossover poster during its credits entitled &quot;Ed, Edd n Mandy&quot;. In 2012, Double D made an appearance in the animated sketch comedy Cartoon Network series &quot;Mad&quot; episode &quot;Once Upon a Toon.&quot; In 2018, Plank appeared in the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;3 2 1 2 333, 222, 3...66?&quot; in a segment entitled &quot;Plank: The College Years&quot;.

The show was featured in the 2002 edition of Cartoon Network&#x27;s fictional awards program, &quot;The 1st 13th Annual Fancy Anvil Awards Show Program Special: Live in Stereo&quot;. It won Best Performance by an Inanimate Object in a Dramatic Role for the character of Plank, and Best Performance by a Team in a Cartoon Series for the characters of Ed, Double D, and Eddy. The character of Sarah was nominated for Best Performance by a Female in a Cartoon Series, but lost to Bubbles from &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;.

In 2004, the Eds appeared in a short series of basketball commercials with NBA All-Star Steve Francis. Ed appeared in the &quot;Cartoon Network Elections 2004&quot; with Grim from &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; as a team, and they ended up winning, due to the highest number of votes by viewers.

The fourth single on American rapper JID&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Never Story&quot;, is titled &quot;EdEddnEddy.&quot; In the song, the rapper declares the antics of him and two of his friends are similar to the scams of Ed, Edd, and Eddy. A music video for the song was later released, replicating the series&#x27; signature art style. The video was also planned to debut on Adult Swim, but according to JID legal issues prevented this from panning out.

==Reception and achievements==

===Ratings and run length achievements===
&quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; attracted an audience of 31 million households, was broadcast in 120 countries, and was popular among both children and adults. According to Cartoon Network executive Linda Simensky, the first season did &quot;remarkably well&quot; in ratings following its premiere, becoming one of the top-rated series on the network. It was Cartoon Network&#x27;s most popular show among boys ages 2–11. In 2005, it was reported that &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; was the number one rated show on Cartoon Network and was known to 79% of children aged 6–11. The series ran for nearly 11 years, making it the longest-running Cartoon Network original series at the time, and at the time of its finale, the longest-running Canadian-produced animated series.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; received critical acclaim and became one of Cartoon Network&#x27;s most successful original series. David Cornelius of DVD Talk considered the Eds to be child equivalents of The Three Stooges, believing that &quot;the series revels in the sort of frantic, often gross humour kids love so much, and there&#x27;s just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily.&quot; Cornelius also wrote that the &quot;animation is colourful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze. This is the animation that&#x27;s, well, really animated.&quot;

Despite this, not all reception of the show was positive. Terrence Briggs of &quot;Animation World Magazine&quot; considered every second of the show &quot;filler&quot; and lamented that the main characters are drawn as &quot;products from the school of acid-trip caricature.&quot; After Briggs&#x27; review was published, a large number of letters supportive of the show were sent to the magazine, prompting it to &quot;take a second look&quot; at the show. Different reviewers then gave it a positive review, calling it a &quot;fresh show with very different approaches.&quot;

===Accolades===
During its run, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; was nominated for a Reuben Award, six Leo Awards, an Annie Award, two Kids&#x27; Choice Awards and a SOCAN Award, winning the Reuben Award, two Leo Awards and the SOCAN Award. Desi Jedeikin of Smosh.com listed &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; on the website&#x27;s list of &quot;9 Cartoons That Need a Reboot.&quot; &quot;Complex&quot; included Eddy&#x27;s room on their list of &quot;Movie and TV Characters&#x27; Bedrooms You Wished Were Yours,&quot; and ranked Jimmy 14th on their list of &quot;15 Artistic Characters We Miss From Our Childhood.&quot; Cracked.com praised the show&#x27;s high level of violence, stating that it &quot;set the bar on cartoon violence for anything that was played on Cartoon Network, and thus far, none have surpassed them.&quot; Bob Higgins, head of creative at Wild Brain, considered &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; to be a &quot;landmark in animation.&quot;

In August 2002, the New York Museum of Television and Radio featured the episode &quot;An Ed Is Born&quot; as part of the special program &quot;Cartoon Power! Celebrating Cartoon Network&#x27;s 10th Birthday&quot;.

==Other media==

===Film===
The made-for-TV movie &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Big Picture Show&quot; serves as the series&#x27; finale and premiered in the United States on November 8, 2009; although it had completed production a year earlier and first aired in Scandinavia, Australia, and Southeast Asia. The plot focuses on the Eds&#x27; search for Eddy&#x27;s Brother, a character mentioned several times throughout the series, but never seen until the film. He is voiced by series voice director Terry Klassen. The film was directed by Antonucci, who also co-wrote the script with Rachel Connor, Jono Howard, Mike Kubat, and Stacy Warnick. The story was written by Joel Dickie, Steve Garcia, Jim Miller, Raven Molisee, and Scott Underwood, while the score was written by series composer Patric Caird. The film achieved broad ratings success for Cartoon Network with high delivery gains.

===Home media===
The first two seasons of &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; were released on DVD by Warner Home Video in the US and Madman Entertainment in Australia in 2006 and 2007. The &quot;Fools&#x27; Par-Ed-Ise&quot; DVD, the DVDs of the first two seasons, and several &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; T-shirts were available for purchase on the Cartoon Network Shop. Selected episodes from the series were also featured on various Cartoon Network compilation DVDs. All five seasons of the series, as well as &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Big Picture Show&quot;, are available for download on the iTunes Store. The first four seasons were available on Netflix from March 2013 until March 2015. The third season can be downloaded at Google Play. The Eds and Sarah have been free toys in children&#x27;s meals for Subway. In the United Kingdom the character of Eddy was given away in Kellogg&#x27;s cereal boxes as one of the Cartoon Network Wobble Heads in 2003. On January 1, 2021, all six seasons were added to the HBO Max streaming service; the single-episode sixth season was combined into the fifth season.

Amazon Prime added the complete series to its streaming library in December 2022, including the holiday specials and &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Big Picture Show&quot;.

===Publications===
&quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; was regularly featured in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Cartoon Network Block Party&quot; (originally &quot;Cartoon Cartoons&quot;, the collective name of original Cartoon Network series from 1995 to 2003) comic books, along with other Cartoon Network series. Two books based on the series have been released, both published by Scholastic Inc. in 2005: &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy: Lots of Laughs&quot;, written by Jesse Leon McCann, and &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy: Book of Extreme Excuses&quot;, written by Howie Dewin.

Cartoon Network produced short cartoons involving the Eds which were shown during commercial breaks. A short music video was produced with stylized versions of Ed, Edd, Eddy, and Sarah, entitled &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Day&quot; (listed on the Season 2 DVD as &quot;I&#x27;m Not Coming in Anymore&quot;), which aired on Cartoon Network in 2002 and 2003. In the video, Sarah uses a potion to shrink the Eds to a size capable of playing in her dollhouse, with predictable results. Plank starred in a similar video called &quot;My Best Friend Plank,&quot; which aired in 2002.

<text>Robert Alexander Szatkowski (born December 18, 1970) is an American professional wrestler better known by his ring name Rob Van Dam (frequently abbreviated to RVD). Known for his unique ring style—which includes his variety of kicks, acrobatic movements—and flexibility, Van Dam is one of the most popular wrestlers in the world. He is signed to WWE under a Legends contract. He is also known for his tenures in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).

Van Dam gained mainstream popularity in ECW during the latter half of the 1990s. During his time in ECW, he was managed by Bill Alfonso and had feuds with Jerry Lynn and Sabu, also forming a tag team with the latter. They won the ECW World Tag Team Championship twice. On April 4, 1998, Van Dam defeated Bam Bam Bigelow to win the ECW Television Championship, a title he held for 700 days until he vacated the championship due to an injury on March 4, 2000.

When ECW closed in 2001, Van Dam signed a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and was involved in the Invasion storyline, where several former World Championship Wrestling and ECW wrestlers joined forces against WWF wrestlers. After the Invasion ended, Van Dam wrestled the following years as singles and tag team wrestler, winning the WWE Hardcore Championship, WWE Intercontinental Championship, WWE European Championship, WWE Tag Team Championship and World Tag Team Championships. At WrestleMania 22, Rob Van Dam won the Money in the Bank ladder match. After this victory, he challenged WWE Champion John Cena to a title match at One Night Stand, an ECW-themed PPV. At the event, Van Dam defeated Cena and won his first world championship. Two days later, Paul Heyman awarded Van Dam with the reactivated ECW World Heavyweight Championship making him the only man to hold both titles at the same time.

After leaving WWE in 2007, Van Dam worked on the independent circuit until he signed a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) - in 2010. A few months after his debut, he defeated AJ Styles to win the TNA World Championship. He would also appear for Lucha Libre AAA World Wide and challenged Dr. Wagner Jr. for the newly created AAA Latin American Championship at Triplemania XIX, albeit in a losing effort. He remained under contract with TNA until 2013, leaving the company after a run with the TNA X Division Championship. After departing TNA, he returned to WWE, where he worked for one year. Then, he would stay in the independent circuit, also wrestling from 2019 to 2020 with TNA (at the time known as Impact Wrestling). In 2021, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, and the following year he was inducted into the Hardcore Hall of Fame. Between ECW, WWE and TNA, Van Dam won 21 total championships, including three world championships, and is only one of two wrestlers in history (alongside Bobby Lashley) to have held the WWE, ECW, and TNA world championships.

In addition, he headlined many pay-per-view events throughout three decades between the 1990s and 2010s, including the 1998 edition of November to Remember (ECW&#x27;s flagship event) and the 2011 edition of TripleMania (AAA&#x27;s flagship event). In 2002, Van Dam was ranked the number one pro wrestler in the world by &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;. He was voted &quot;Most Popular Wrestler&quot; by readers of the magazine in 2001 and again in 2002. WWE named him the greatest star in ECW history in 2014.

Outside of professional wrestling, Van Dam has performed as an actor in a number of TV shows, including an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. He also starred in the 2010 movie &quot;Wrong Side of Town&quot; and the 2015 movie &quot;3-Headed Shark Attack&quot;.

== Early life ==
Szatkowski grew up in Battle Creek, Michigan, and graduated from Pennfield Senior High School. Szatkowski made his first appearance on WWF television in 1987 in a skit with &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase. At the time, DiBiase was selecting plants from the audience and offering to pay them to perform degrading acts and offered the 16-year-old Szatkowski $100 to enter the ring and kiss his foot, which he did. This early appearance was later included as a bonus feature on WWE&#x27;s &quot;Before They Were Superstars&quot; DVD and on WWE&#x27;s &quot;Rob Van Dam: One of a Kind&quot; DVD. He was also in attendance at WrestleMania III as stated on The Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology DVD.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1990–1992) ===
Szatkowski began training as a wrestler under The Sheik in 1989. He made his wrestling debut in 1990, defeating Dango Nguyen. He wrestled in many independent promotions across Michigan, including the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) and South Atlantic Pro Wrestling (SAPW). In SAPW, he won his first wrestling championship, the SAPW Tag Team Championship, in July 1992 with Chaz Rocco. He also wrestled in several independent promotions across America, and in All Japan Pro Wrestling, where he challenged for the World Junior Heavyweight Championship on several occasions. In the World Wrestling Federation in 1992 he wrestled as an enhancement talent against The Mountie under the ring name Matt Burn.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1992–1993) ===
Szatkowski signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1992, and was dubbed &quot;Robbie V&quot; by booker Ron Slinker upon his arrival since Bill Watts did not like the name Rob Van Dam. Robbie V made his WCW debut on the January 23, 1993, episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; as a fan favorite, defeating enhancement talent Pat Rose. The following month, Robbie V entered a tournament for the vacant WCW World Television Championship, defeating Shanghai Pierce in the first round but losing to Vinnie Vegas in the second round, which aired on the March 20 episode of &quot;WCW WorldWide&quot;. His last televised match was on the May 22 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, a tag team loss with Erik Watts against Shanghai Pierce and Tex Slazenger. In February and March 1993, Szatkowski wrestled in Japan for All Japan Pro Wrestling; upon his return to WCW, Ole Anderson had replaced Bill Watts as booker. Szatkowski left WCW in May 1993, feeling he was &quot;lost in the shuffle&quot;. and being &quot;jobbed out&quot;.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (1993–1997) ===
From 1993 to 1997, Van Dam made 10 tours of Japan with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). While wrestling for AJPW, he was advised by promoter Giant Baba to make himself stand out, which inspired Van Dam to begin airbrushing his singlets. His first tour took place in February and March 1993 as part of the annual Excite Series, where his opponents included Dory Funk Jr. and Toshiaki Kawada&#x27;s Super Generation Army stable. Van Dam returned to AJPW in February and March 1994 as part of that year&#x27;s Excite Series, facing opponents including Jun Akiyama, Mighty Inoue, and the Super Generation Army.

Van Dam made a third tour with AJPW in February and March 1995, again as part of the Excite Series, facing opponents including the Can-Am Express, the Holy Demon Army, and the Super Generation Army; during this tour, he teamed with Bobby Bradley as &quot;Aerial Assault&quot;. Van Dam returned to AJPW in May and June 1995 as part of the Super Power Series, again facing the Can-Am Express and the Super Generation Army in a series of tag team matches. In his final match of the tour, he unsuccessfully challenged World Junior Heavyweight Champion Danny Kroffat in the Nippon Budokan. He wrestled his fourth tour with AJPW in October 1995 as part of the October Giant Series. Van Dam wrestled his fifth tour of the year with AJPW in November and December 1995 as part of the World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League, where he teamed with Johnny Smith. Van Dam and Smith finished last out of 10 teams, defeating Jun Akiyama and Takao Omori but losing their other eight matches.

Van Dam returned to AJPW for a sixth tour in February and March 1996 as part of the annual Excite series, again facing the Can-Am Express, Holy Demon Army, and Super Generation Army. He returned for a seventh tour in June and July 1996 as part of the Summer Action Series; during this tour, he teamed with Maunakea Mossman to unsuccessfully challenge Jun Akiyama and Takao Omori for the All Asia Tag Team Championship. In September and October 1996, he made an eighth tour as part of the October Giant Series; during this tour, he unsuccessfully challenged World Junior Heavyweight Champion Tsuyoshi Kikuchi.

Van Dam returned to AJPW for a ninth tour in January 1997 as part of the New Year Giant Series, during which he mainly teamed with Sabu; towards the end of the tour, Van Dam and Sabu unsuccessfully challenged Akiyama and Omori for the All Asia Tag Team Championship in Korakuen Hall. In May and June 1997, Van Dam returned to AJPW for a tenth tour as part of the Super Power Series, during which he unsuccessfully challenged World Junior Heavyweight Champion Yoshinari Ogawa.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996–2001) ===

==== Rivalry and alliance with Sabu (1996–1998) ====

In early 1996, Van Dam signed with promoter Paul Heyman&#x27;s Philadelphia-based promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), defeating Axl Rotten in his debut match at House Party. Van Dam&#x27;s mannerisms were those of a stoner, and he became a face due to his laid-back attitude and unorthodox style. On March 30, he faced 2 Cold Scorpio in a match for the World Television Championship. The match ended in a draw with 2 Cold Scorpio retaining the title.

Van Dam gained attention following a series of matches with long-time rival Sabu, which began with a match at Hostile City Showdown, won by Sabu. After the match, Van Dam declined to show proper respect for his opponent, leading to a rematch at A Matter of Respect, which was won by Van Dam. Per the pre-match stipulation, Sabu then offered Van Dam a handshake, but was again ignored. Instead, Van Dam left the ring and turned heel under the management of Bill Alfonso. At Hardcore Heaven, Van Dam faced his rival Sabu once again, in a match to prove who was the better man, but Sabu won the match. The two faced each other yet again in a stretcher match at The Doctor Is In. Van Dam lost the match after missing a Plancha to the outside, hitting the railing and falling onto the stretcher. He was quickly rolled out.

At Natural Born Killaz, Van Dam defeated Doug Furnas in a match. Post-match, Van Dam offered Furnas a handshake, but Furnas instead hit Van Dam with a short-arm clothesline, starting a rivalry between the two. After his rivalry with Furnas expanded to also include Dan Kroffat, Van Dam wanted a tag team partner of his own. After losing to long-time rival Sabu once again at Unlucky Lottery, the two united and formed what was to become one of the most successful tag teams in ECW history. They feuded with Furnas and Kroffat defeating them at When Worlds Collide II and High Incident.

Van Dam and Sabu next feuded with The Eliminators, John Kronus and Perry Saturn. On November 1, the two teams fought to a draw. Van Dam then feuded with Taz, to whom he lost at Holiday Hell via knockout. Sabu and Van Dam continued to feud with The Eliminators for the World Tag Team Championship into 1997. At Crossing the Line Again and Cyberslam, the teams faced off for the ECW World Tag Team Championship in a pair of matches, both of which were won by The Eliminators. At CyberSlam, the two teams faced each other for the title in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, in which The Eliminators again retained their title.

At ECW&#x27;s first pay-per-view event Barely Legal, Van Dam defeated Lance Storm as a last-minute replacement for the injured Chris Candido. Immediately following the match, Van Dam expressed his distaste for being chosen as a back-up for &quot;some guy who couldn&#x27;t even lace his boots.&quot; Van Dam delivered a speech directed towards Paul Heyman, and not being originally booked on the show was a point of contention between Van Dam and Heyman for a time.

In May 1997, ECW &quot;invaded&quot; the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF) &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; television show, drawing the ire of color commentator Jerry Lawler. Lawler then promised he would show up at an ECW show in order to gain revenge, and when he did show up, he had ECW mainstays Van Dam (who turned heel) and Sabu with him. Van Dam made speeches about how he was too good for ECW and deserved to be in one of the &quot;Big Two&quot; (WWF or WCW) on one of their Monday night programs (&quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; or &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;). Lawler began to call Van Dam &quot;Mr. Monday Night&quot; on an episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; which became a moniker that would stay with Van Dam, changing to suit the day of the week of whichever program was being broadcast. Despite his arrogance and &quot;betrayal&quot; of ECW, over time Van Dam became applauded by fans recognizing his athleticism and unique maneuvers. On the May 12 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Van Dam defeated Jeff Hardy. On June 6, Van Dam defeated Flash Funk on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; and teamed with Lawler to defeat the Headbangers on &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;. On the June 16 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; , Van Dam and Lawler lost to the Headbangers in a tournament for the vacant WWF World Tag Team Championship.

Van Dam continued to team up with Sabu upon his return to ECW on June 13. Taz&#x27;s manager Bill Alfonso betrayed Taz and joined Sabu and Van Dam. Van Dam started a new rivalry with Tommy Dreamer, who wanted to gain revenge on Van Dam for his betrayal of ECW. On June 21, Van Dam and Sabu earned a victory over Dreamer and The Sandman. Van Dam and Sabu emerged victorious against Dreamer and Sandman again at Orgy of Violence. At Heat Wave, Van Dam, Sabu, and WWF&#x27;s Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler fought Dreamer, Sandman, and Rick Rude to a no contest. Van Dam and Dreamer faced each other in a hardcore match at Born to Be Wired, won by Van Dam after he performed a leg drop on Dreamer with a trashcan. Van Dam and Sabu became partners while Dreamer teamed up with Taz. At Fright Fight, Van Dam lost to Dreamer in a flag match. At Ultimate Jeopardy, Van Dam and Sabu faced Dreamer and Taz, a match won by Taz and Dreamer after Dreamer pinned Van Dam. At November to Remember, Van Dam faced Dreamer in another flag match which went to a no contest. At Better Than Ever, Van Dam and Sabu faced Dreamer and Taz in a rematch. This time, Van Dam pinned Dreamer to give the victory to his team and to settle their rivalry. Van Dam&#x27;s final encounter with Dreamer came on January 5, when Dreamer teamed up with Taz, Al Snow, and Sandman to take on Van Dam, Sabu, Doug Furnas, and Phil Lafon. Van Dam&#x27;s team lost the match.

In 1998, Van Dam turned face and started a feud with The Triple Threat (Shane Douglas, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Chris Candido). At House Party, Van Dam defeated Bam Bam Bigelow. At Hostile City Showdown, Van Dam and Sabu defeated Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney by disqualification. The two went on to win a fatal four-way elimination tag team match later that night. At CyberSlam, Van Dam and Sabu lost to World Heavyweight Champion Shane Douglas and Bam Bam Bigelow.

Van Dam&#x27;s popularity increased when he got his first taste of ECW gold, on April 4 when he defeated Bam Bam Bigelow to win the World Television Championship. Van Dam retained the belt in his first title defense on April 10 against Doug Furnas. Sabu also expressed interest in Van Dam&#x27;s championship, leading to a title match between the two at Wrestlepalooza. Van Dam retained the title as the match ended in a time limit draw.

At A Matter of Respect, Van Dam and Sabu were forced to face each other in a tag team match as they both teamed up with World Tag Team Champions. Van Dam teamed with the one half of the champions, Lance Storm, while Sabu teamed with the other half, Chris Candido. Van Dam and Sabu reconciled and instead took out Storm and Candido making it a no contest. Van Dam and Sabu started a feud with Storm and Candido in the next month for the tag team title. On June 29, Van Dam and Sabu beat Storm and Candido to win the World Tag Team Championship, which made Van Dam a double champion. On October 24, Sabu and Van Dam lost the title to the Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray and D-Von) after interference from Triple Threat. Van Dam sought revenge and at November to Remember, Van Dam and Sabu teamed with Taz to defeat Triple Threat. On December 13, Van Dam and Sabu won the World Tag Team Championship for a second time by beating the Dudley Boyz in Japan at a Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling ECW/FMW Supershow.

==== Longest-reigning World Television Champion (1998–2000) ====
Van Dam remained the World Television Champion for the rest of 1998, and he started 1999 by making successful title defenses against the likes of Spike Dudley, Lance Storm at Guilty as Charged, Jerry Lynn at Crossing the Line &#x27;99, Balls Mahoney at Anarchy Rulz, and 2 Cold Scorpio at CyberSlam.

Van Dam and Sabu were scheduled to make a title defense on April 17, but Sabu was suspended by ECW before the match occurred. Instead, Van Dam faced D-Von Dudley in a singles match and as a result of losing the match, Van Dam also lost the ECW World Tag Team Championship to the Dudleyz. After losing the tag team titles, Van Dam focused on defending the Television title. He entered into a rivalry with Jerry Lynn against whom he defended the Television title at Hardcore Heaven in a &quot;no time limit&quot; match. Van Dam retained the title, and the match was deemed so good that Paul Heyman aired it on ECW&#x27;s debut on TNN in place of a shoot promo about TNN that he was planning, but was not allowed to air. Van Dam continued to defend the ECW World Television Championship for the remainder of the year.

Van Dam began a feud with Rhino in the beginning of 2000. Van Dam successfully defended the ECW World Television Championship against Rhino on January 7. Van Dam got a victory during a title defense against Sabu at Guilty as Charged which was Sabu&#x27;s last match in the promotion. Van Dam was scheduled to perform in a &quot;champion vs. champion&quot; pay-per-view main event against the ECW World Heavyweight Champion Mike Awesome. This match potentially could have been ECW&#x27;s most lucrative pay-per-view main event, and Heyman was depending on it to bring an influx of badly needed finances, but the match never occurred because Van Dam suffered a broken ankle during a successful title defense against Rhino on January 29. The injury also forced Van Dam to vacate the ECW World Television Championship.

==== Final appearances (2000–2001) ====
Van Dam returned to ECW at Hardcore Heaven on May 14 and faced long-time rival Jerry Lynn. Van Dam was supported by his real-life friend Scotty Anton who eventually turned on him when Van Dam was going to perform a Five-Star Frog Splash on Lynn. Anton pushed him from the top rope, which helped Lynn win the match. Van Dam feuded with Anton and took his revenge at Heat Wave on July 16 by defeating Anton after debuting his new finisher called the &quot;Van Terminator&quot;. Van Dam then attempted to exact revenge on Rhino for forcing his injury. He received many opportunities to win the ECW World Television Championship back from Rhino, but Rhino&#x27;s allies usually attacked Van Dam, causing disqualifications and allowing Rhino to retain the title. At Anarchy Rulz on October 1, Van Dam faced Rhino for the ECW World Television Championship but was screwed when a heel referee made a fast count during a pinfall attempt made by Rhino.

Van Dam was not advertised and did not show for a large number of ECW events due to the large sum of money owed to him. He appeared at ECW&#x27;s final pay-per-view event Guilty as Charged on January 7, 2001, where he defeated Jerry Lynn. This was Van Dam&#x27;s last appearance in ECW, as ECW only held two more shows after the pay-per-view.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (2001) ===
In February and March 2001, Van Dam returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling for an eleventh tour as part of its &quot;Excite Series&quot;. During the tour, Van Dam primarily wrestled in tag team matches, teaming with partners including Danny Kroffat and Gran Naniwa. His opponents during the tour included Giant Kimala and Sabu.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2001–2007) ===

==== The Invasion (2001) ====
Several months after the closure of ECW, Van Dam was signed to a short-term contract by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Along with fellow ECW alumnus Tommy Dreamer, Van Dam returned to WWF television on the July 9, 2001, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot; in Atlanta, Georgia as a heel, and attacking WWF wrestlers Kane and Chris Jericho. Later that night, five wrestlers from WWF and five wrestlers from WCW took on ten ECW wrestlers, including Van Dam. The match never took place as instead the WCW wrestlers aligned themselves with the ECW wrestlers.

Despite being presented as a heel, Van Dam was popular with the WWF fans, who were aware of his reputation in ECW. After defeating Jeff Hardy for the WWF Hardcore Championship at WWF Invasion on July 22, Van Dam lost the Hardcore Championship to Hardy on the August 13 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, but regained it at SummerSlam on August 19 in a ladder match. During this time Van Dam had defeated wrestlers such as Kane, The Undertaker, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, The Rock and even Alliance leader Stone Cold Steve Austin in singles and tag team matches. Van Dam became one of the most popular members of the Alliance who faced The Rock for the WCW Championship on multiple occasions, and even challenged Alliance leader Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF Championship including a triple threat match at No Mercy on October 21 also involving Kurt Angle, but did not win. At Survivor Series on November 18, Van Dam and four other Alliance members faced five WWF wrestlers in a &quot;Winner Take All&quot; match. Team WWF won, and the members of the Alliance were fired; however, as he held the Hardcore Championship, Van Dam was able to retain his job.

==== Intercontinental Champion and Championship Unifications (2001–2002) ====
Van Dam became a face, but lost the Hardcore Championship to The Undertaker at Vengeance on December 9. He then entered into a rivalry with William Regal over Regal&#x27;s WWF Intercontinental Championship. On the February 25, 2002 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam defeated Lance Storm and Big Show in a triple threat match to become the #1 contender to the Intercontinental Championship. At WrestleMania X8 on March 17, Van Dam faced Regal for the Intercontinental Championship and won the match after he hit Regal with a Five-Star Frog Splash.

When the WWF was divided into two &quot;brands&quot;, Raw and SmackDown! in 2002, Van Dam was drafted to the Raw brand as the fourth pick, thus bringing the Intercontinental Championship to &quot;Raw&quot;. On the April 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after Van Dam defended his title successfully against Booker T, Eddie Guerrero returned to the WWF and attacked Van Dam. He started a feud with Guerrero over the Intercontinental Championship. At Backlash on April 21, Van Dam lost the Intercontinental Championship to Guerrero. At Insurrextion on May 4, Van Dam and Guerrero had a rematch for the Intercontinental Championship. Guerrero was disqualified after hitting the referee with the Intercontinental Championship; as a result, Van Dam won the match but not the title because a title cannot change hands by disqualification. At Judgment Day on May 19, Van Dam failed to win the Intercontinental title from Guerrero in another rematch. The following night he defeated The Undertaker for the WWE Undisputed Championship but Raw owner Ric Flair restarted the match (due to The Undertaker&#x27;s foot being on the bottom rope), which Van Dam then lost negating the title win. On the May 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam defeated Guerrero in a ladder match for his second Intercontinental Championship.

After facing each other in the final round of the 2002 King of the Ring tournament (which he lost), Van Dam and Brock Lesnar began feuding with each other. Van Dam defended his Intercontinental Championship against Lesnar twice and retained his title both times by disqualification on the June 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and at Vengeance on July 21. On the July 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam won the WWE European Championship for the first and only time after he defeated then-European Champion Jeff Hardy in a championship unification ladder match. As a result, the European Championship was deactivated upon being unified with the Intercontinental Championship. On the July 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam lost the Intercontinental Championship to Chris Benoit.
At SummerSlam on August 25, Van Dam won his third Intercontinental Championship by defeating Benoit in a rematch for the title. As Benoit brought the title to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when he switched brands shortly after winning it, Van Dam brought the title back to &quot;Raw&quot;. On the August 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam won the Hardcore Championship for the fourth and final time after he defeated then-Hardcore Champion Tommy Dreamer in a championship unification hardcore match. As a result, the Hardcore Championship was deactivated upon being unified with the Intercontinental Championship. On the September 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam became the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Chris Jericho, Jeff Hardy, and Big Show in a fatal four-way elimination match.

Van Dam started feuding with the World Heavyweight Champion Triple H. On the September 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam lost the Intercontinental Championship to Chris Jericho after interference by Triple H. At Unforgiven on September 22, Van Dam faced Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Due to Ric Flair&#x27;s interference, Van Dam lost the match. At No Mercy on October 20, Van Dam got his revenge on Flair by defeating him. At Survivor Series on November 17, Van Dam participated in the first-ever Elimination Chamber match for Triple H&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship, but it was won by Shawn Michaels. During the match, Van Dam performed a Five-Star Frog Splash off of one of the pods/chambers onto Triple H, and accidentally landed his knee onto Triple H&#x27;s throat.

==== Teaming and feuding with Kane (2002–2003) ====
Van Dam appeared on the World Heavyweight Championship scene and also formed a tag team with Kane in October. Van Dam defeated Jericho and Booker T in a Triple Threat match to become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. On the November 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam faced Michaels for the World Heavyweight Championship. Michaels was disqualified after Triple H hit Van Dam with a Pedigree. On the December 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam lost to Triple H in a #1 contender&#x27;s match with World Heavyweight Champion Shawn Michaels acting as the special guest referee.

Van Dam continued to team up with Kane. Van Dam participated in the Royal Rumble on January 19, 2003, and was one of the final five participants before being tricked and eliminated by Kane. The two faced Lance Storm and William Regal at No Way Out on February 23 for the World Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles when Kane mistakenly chokeslammed Van Dam. On the March 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam and Kane defeated World Tag Team Champions Lance Storm and Chief Morley and The Dudley Boyz in a 3-way elimination tag team match to win the World Tag Team Championship. At Backlash on April 27, Van Dam and Kane retained the titles against The Dudley Boyz with Morley as the special guest referee. At Insurrextion on June 7, Van Dam and Kane defended the World Tag Team Championship successfully against La Résistance, before losing the titles to La Résistance at Bad Blood on June 15.

After Kane was forced to take his mask off when he lost a World Heavyweight Championship match to Triple H on the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he turned heel by chokeslamming Van Dam, and the team dissolved. The two then started feuding with each other. On the August 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam faced Christian for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, but Kane interfered in the match and knocked Van Dam out after hitting him with a chair. Kane then took Van Dam to the backstage area and was about to set him on fire. Kane changed his mind at the last minute, however, and said that he was not going to do what &quot;they&quot; wanted. Their rivalry led to a No Holds Barred match at SummerSlam on August 24, which Kane won. On the September 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the rivalry ended when Kane defeated Van Dam in a steel cage match. Kane threw Van Dam through the steel cage by mistake (causing Van Dam to win), but Eric Bischoff came out and restarted the match, saying Van Dam did not escape through the door or climb out of the cage and ordered the referees to put Van Dam back inside the cage where Kane eventually hit a chokeslam from the side of the cage to pick up the victory.

==== Championship reigns (2003–2005) ====
In September, Van Dam started feuding with both Christian and Chris Jericho over Christian&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship. On the September 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam faced Jericho in a number one contender&#x27;s match for the title. The match ended in a double disqualification when Intercontinental Champion Christian interfered and hit both men with the title belt. At Unforgiven on September 21 in a triple threat match between Jericho, Christian, and Van Dam, Christian retained his title. Van Dam, however, defeated Christian in a ladder match on the September 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to win the Intercontinental Championship for a fourth time. Van Dam entered into a rivalry with Chris Jericho in October, and the two faced each other in several tag team matches. On the October 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam lost the Intercontinental Championship to Jericho. Van Dam reached the ropes when the challenger had him in the Walls of Jericho, but Raw Co-General Manager Eric Bischoff distracted the referee while Jericho dragged Van Dam back into the middle of the ring. Van Dam submitted and Jericho became the new champion. Raw Co-General Manager Stone Cold Steve Austin came out and immediately ordered Jericho to face Van Dam in a rematch inside the Steel Cage for the title. Van Dam won the rematch and his fifth Intercontinental Championship.

At Survivor Series on November 16, Van Dam was pinned by Randy Orton during the traditional elimination match between Team Austin and Team Bischoff that Van Dam&#x27;s team would lose. As a result, Orton and Van Dam started feuding with each other over Van Dam&#x27;s Intercontinental title. Van Dam lost the Intercontinental Championship to Orton at Armageddon on December 14 after interference from Ric Flair. Van Dam went on to feud with both Orton and Evolution. On the January 12, 2004, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam faced Orton in a rematch for the Intercontinental Championship but lost the match.

Van Dam formed a tag team with Booker T. The two teamed for the first time on the January 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when they defeated Christian and Matt Hardy to qualify for a battle royal where the winner of the Battle Royal would get the #30 spot in the 2004 Royal Rumble match on January 25. On the February 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Booker T and Van Dam defeated Evolution members Ric Flair and Batista to win the World Tag Team Championship. At WrestleMania XX on March 14, Booker T and Van Dam defended the World Tag Team Championship in a fatal four-way elimination tag team match against the Dudley Boyz, La Résistance, and the team of Mark Jindrak and Garrison Cade. On the March 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Booker T and Van Dam lost the World Tag Team Championship back to Evolution.

On March 22, Van Dam was drafted to the SmackDown! brand. He made his &quot;SmackDown!&quot; debut on March 25 defeating Charlie Haas. Van Dam and Rey Mysterio began a feud with the Dudley Boyz, defeating them at Judgment Day on May 16. In June, Van Dam left the tag team division and began a pursuit for the United States Championship. At The Great American Bash on June 27, John Cena defended the title against Van Dam, Booker T, and René Duprée in a Fatal Four-Way match and retained his championship. On the July 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Van Dam and Duprée lost to Booker T in a number one contender&#x27;s Triple Threat match. Four weeks later, Van Dam participated in an 8-way elimination match for the vacant United States Championship, and was the last man to be eliminated by eventual winner Booker T.

Van Dam began teaming up with Mysterio again in the summer and feuded with René Duprée and Kenzo Suzuki. At No Mercy on October 3, Van Dam and Mysterio failed to win the WWE Tag Team Championship from Dupree and Suzuki. On the December 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Van Dam and Mysterio defeated Duprée and Suzuki to win the WWE Tag Team Championship, and retained the title in a rematch at Armageddon on December 12. In January 2005, Van Dam suffered a knee injury. To explain his absence, the Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny) defeated Mysterio and Van Dam for the WWE Tag Team Championship, in a Fatal Four-Way elimination tag team match on the January 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, &quot;injuring&quot; Van Dam in the process. On January 27, Van Dam underwent reconstructive knee surgery under Dr. James Andrews to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus.

==== WWE Champion and ECW Champion (2005–2006) ====
While recuperating, Van Dam made an appearance at the ECW reunion pay-per-view ECW One Night Stand on June 12. Accompanied by his former manager Bill Alfonso and sporting a knee brace, Van Dam delivered a worked shoot promo, standing up for ECW and criticizing the way he had been booked in WWE, until he was attacked by Rhyno. He was saved by Sabu, who defeated Rhyno in an impromptu match. Despite his injury, Van Dam got physically involved in the match, hitting Rhyno with a chairshot and giving him a Chair Surf. On the June 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam, while still healing, was drafted to the Raw brand in the 2005 draft lottery. He was introduced to &quot;Raw&quot; by Carlito, who insulted Van Dam before attacking him and assaulting his knee. Van Dam made his return to the ring over seven months later at the Royal Rumble on January 29, 2006. He gained revenge on Carlito by eliminating him, but was in turn inadvertently eliminated by Rey Mysterio in the final moments. On the February 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam defeated Carlito in the first round of the Road to WrestleMania Tournament to determine the number one contender to the WWE Championship, but lost in the final round to Triple H, in a triple threat match, which also featured Big Show. Later, Van Dam defeated Trevor Murdoch to qualify for the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 22 on April 2. Van Dam went on to win the match, thus earning himself a guaranteed shot at either the WWE Championship or World Heavyweight Championship at any time within the subsequent year.

Following the ladder match, Shelton Benjamin challenged Van Dam to put his Money in the Bank opportunity on the line in a match. Van Dam countered by requesting a match for Benjamin&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship. One week later, both Van Dam and Benjamin picked mystery opponents for one another, with the loser placing their respective prize on the line in a bout at Backlash on April 30. Benjamin lost to the returning Charlie Haas, while Van Dam was defeated by all five members of the Spirit Squad. As a result, both the Intercontinental Championship and the Money in the Bank title shot were contested at Backlash. Van Dam went on to win the former, before dropping the Intercontinental Championship back to Benjamin on the May 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.
On May 29, Van Dam was selected by Paul Heyman to be drafted to WWE&#x27;s new ECW brand. At ECW One Night Stand on June 11, Van Dam cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated John Cena to win the WWE Championship. After two referees were knocked out, Edge appeared from underneath the ring to attack Cena, spearing him through a table. Van Dam then hit a Five Star Frog Splash and the pinfall was counted by Paul Heyman, who suddenly ran down the aisle. On the following episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vince McMahon confirmed that the title change was official due to the match being held under &quot;extreme rules&quot;. For the past few weeks, Heyman had hinted that the WWE Championship would be &quot;rechristened&quot; the ECW World Heavyweight Championship when Van Dam won. On the debut of &quot;ECW&quot;, Van Dam was awarded the reinstated ECW World Heavyweight Championship by Heyman and decided to defend the WWE Championship separately and simultaneously, joking that &quot;this one spins&quot;, becoming the first wrestler in history to hold both the WWE Championship and the ECW World Heavyweight Championship as well as the only one to hold them at the same time, making him a double world champion. He would become the 15th WWE Triple Crown Champion as a result of his WWE Championship win.

At Vengeance on June 25, Van Dam defeated Edge to retain the WWE Championship. Two nights later on &quot;ECW&quot;, Van Dam defeated Kurt Angle to retain the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. On the July 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Van Dam lost the WWE Championship to Edge in a triple threat match that also featured John Cena. The next night on the July 4 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, he lost the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to Big Show after Heyman turned on him. Later on WWE.com, Heyman suspended Van Dam for 30 days without giving a reason (in reality, WWE suspended Van Dam for 30 days as a result of his recent drug possession arrest).

He returned to television on the August 8 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, attacking both Sabu and Kurt Angle during a match. His return to the ring came a week later, in a losing effort to Sabu in a ladder match for number one contendership to the now renamed ECW World Championship. Van Dam slowly worked his way back into the championship picture. In October, Van Dam defeated Big Show in a non-title match to regain the number one contendership. Having the option to pick a date for the title, Van Dam announced the title match would occur at December to Dismember on December 3. However, Heyman had the option of picking the match type and announced that the main event would be a six-man Extreme Elimination Chamber match. At December to Dismember, Van Dam was the third participant eliminated. Later in December, Van Dam once again earned the number one contendership to the ECW World Championship, but this time by a fan poll. Van Dam got three matches against ECW World Champion Bobby Lashley, coming up short each time.

==== The ECW Originals (2006–2007) ====

Rob Van Dam later joined the ECW Originals along with Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, and The Sandman. The ECW Originals began a feud with the New Breed (Elijah Burke, Kevin Thorn, Marcus Cor Von, and Matt Striker). The two teams faced off at WrestleMania 23 on April 1, 2007 in a match which the ECW Originals won. After Vince McMahon won the ECW World Championship at Backlash on April 29, Van Dam and the other ECW Originals made statements on WWE.com about McMahon killing ECW. On the May 1 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, the ECW Originals all competed in a fatal four-way match to decide who would take on McMahon the next week in a title match, which Van Dam won after a five-star frog splash on Sandman. Van Dam, however, had to face McMahon, Shane McMahon, and Umaga in a 3-on-1 handicap match, which Van Dam was unable to win.

Van Dam received a concussion during a match with Randy Orton on the May 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Orton further attacked Van Dam after the match due to the comments Van Dam made on WWE.com about the lack of respect Orton displayed towards Shawn Michaels, who also suffered a concussion at the hands of Orton. Van Dam once again faced Orton at One Night Stand on June 3, this time in a Stretcher match. Although it looked as if Orton was going to win again, Van Dam gave him a roundhouse kick to the head and was able to push the stretcher across the line for the win. Despite winning the match, Orton continued to attack Van Dam, ending with an elevated DDT off the barricade and onto the concrete floor, in which Van Dam was carried out on a stretcher. After the match, Van Dam left WWE due to being burnt out and needing time away.

=== Return to the independent circuit (2007–2010) ===
The day after Van Dam&#x27;s WWE contract expired, he was in the United Kingdom on a promotional tour and to record scenes for the wrestling documentary, &quot;Bloodstained Memoirs&quot;. He also took part in interviews for the BBC.

Van Dam defeated Booker T at Pro Wrestling Alliance Christmas Chaos on December 28, 2007, in Pasadena, Texas.
In an interview with the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;, Van Dam stated that while WWE would be the first choice and that he would definitely talk to them, he would definitely consider Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) if he returned full-time to pro wrestling. While not under contract, Van Dam made an unannounced return on WWE&#x27;s &quot;15th Anniversary Raw&quot; in December 2007, squashing Santino Marella with a Five-Star Frog Splash. He made a similarly unannounced appearance as a participant in the 2009 Royal Rumble, which he failed to win as he was eliminated by Chris Jericho.

He returned to the independent circuit by competing for Associação Portuguesa de Wrestling (APW) in February 2008. He then also appeared for Nu-Wrestling Evolution (NWE) throughout countries such as Spain. On August 14, 2008, he won a triple threat match at the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF) in Japan after defeating Kendo Kashin and Necro Butcher.

On March 9, 2009, it was announced that Van Dam would be competing in American Wrestling Rampage (AWR) on their European Tour, during which he won the promotion&#x27;s No Limits Wrestling (NLW) Championship in a three way bout versus Sabu and former champion Shawn Maxer. He lost the title to René Duprée after three successful defenses. In November he regained the title, renamed the AWR World Heavyweight Championship at this point, from Duprée on November 29 winning two decisions in a Two Out of Three Falls match.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2010–2013) ===

==== TNA World Heavyweight Champion and EV 2.0 (2010–2011) ====

On March 8, 2010, Van Dam made his debut for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) at the promotion&#x27;s Monday night episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, defeating Sting. Then just seconds after his debut victory Sting attacked him and later Hulk Hogan with his signature baseball bat. Van Dam got his revenge on Sting the following week by attacking him during his entrance. Van Dam teamed with Jeff Hardy in a tag team match, where they defeated Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) on the March 22 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. The following week the two of them teamed with Eric Young and defeated The Band (Kevin Nash, Scott Hall and Syxx-Pac) in a six-man tag team steel cage match. At Lockdown on April 18, both Van Dam and Hardy became members of Team Hogan (joining Abyss and Jeff Jarrett) for the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they defeated Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm).

The night after Lockdown he first defeated Jeff Hardy in a number one contender&#x27;s match and then, in the main event of the evening, A.J. Styles to become the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. After succeeding in his first televised title defense against Desmond Wolfe, Styles attacked Van Dam, announcing the invocation of the rematch clause for Sacrifice on May 16. At Sacrifice Van Dam defeated Styles in a rematch. The following month at Slammiversary VIII on June 13 Van Dam retained his title against Sting in a rematch of his TNA debut. Van Dam defeated Abyss, Jeff Hardy and Mr. Anderson in a four-way match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Victory Road on July 11. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Van Dam aligned himself with fellow ECW alumni Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Stevie Richards, Rhino, Brother Devon, Pat Kenney, Al Snow and Mick Foley, who saved him from a beating at the hands of Abyss.

The following week, TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay–per–view event, Hardcore Justice on August 8. At Hardcore Justice, Van Dam defeated former tag team partner and rival Sabu in a non-title Hardcore Rules match, after his originally planned match with Jerry Lynn was scrapped due to Lynn suffering a back injury. After successfully defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Abyss in a Stairway to Janice match on the following special edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, named &quot;The Whole F&#x27;n Show&quot;, Van Dam and the other former ECW wrestlers were assaulted by Abyss and . In the attack Van Dam suffered multiple serious storyline injuries at the hands of Abyss including the need for stitches, spinal trauma and possible acute brain damage, which would force him to vacate the TNA World Heavyweight Championship on August 10 at the taping of the August 19 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. In reality, Van Dam was running out of dates per year on his contract and was therefore taken off television.
Van Dam returned via telephone interview on the September 16 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; and announced that he would return to the Impact! Zone the following week, against his doctor&#x27;s orders. Van Dam returned the following week, confronting Abyss and demanding a match against him at Bound for Glory on October 10, which Eric Bischoff agreed to give him. At Bound for Glory Van Dam defeated Abyss in a Monster&#x27;s Ball match. At the end of Bound for Glory it was revealed that Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff had sent Abyss after Van Dam in order to get the TNA World Heavyweight Championship on their own representative, Jeff Hardy. Van Dam confronted the group, later named Immortal, after Hardy had won the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, only to get hit with the title belt. On the October 21 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Bischoff claimed that someone from EV 2.0 had been calling him, trying to get to be a part of Immortal, which led to Van Dam getting paranoid about his stablemates, first accusing Raven of being the traitor. Later, he and Sabu were defeated in a tag team match by Beer Money, Inc., after Sabu accidentally hit him with a chair. After the match Van Dam and Sabu began shoving each other and had to be separated from each other by the rest of EV 2.0. After two more weeks of dissension between Van Dam and the rest of EV 2.0, Tommy Dreamer challenged him to a match at Turning Point on November 7. At Turning Point Van Dam defeated Dreamer and afterwards made peace with him. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Rhino turned heel by attacking Van Dam and Dreamer, revealing himself as the traitor Van Dam had been looking for. At Final Resolution on December 5 Van Dam defeated Rhino in a First Blood match.

At Genesis on January 9, Van Dam was defeated by Immortal&#x27;s surprise opponent, the debuting Matt Hardy, when referee Jackson James missed Van Dam&#x27;s foot under the ropes, thus failing to earn a shot at his brother Jeff&#x27;s TNA World Heavyweight Championship. During the main event Van Dam prevented Matt from interfering in Jeff&#x27;s match with Mr. Anderson, which led to Jeff losing the title. The following month at Against All Odds on February 13, Van Dam defeated Matt Hardy in a rematch. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Van Dam finally received his shot at Jeff Hardy and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but was unable to regain the title.

Lynn cost Van Dam another Bound for Glory Series match against A.J. Styles in similar fashion on the August 18 &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. Lynn turned on Van Dam on the September 1 &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, costing him his match with Gunner and, in the process, eliminating him from the finals of the Bound for Glory Series. The following week Lynn explained his turn by claiming that he was tired of being in Van Dam&#x27;s shadow. Van Dam defeated Lynn in a Full Metal Mayhem match at Bound for Glory on October 16.

On the October 27 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Van Dam defeated Christopher Daniels by disqualification after Daniels hit him with a toolbox.

In retaliation, Daniels cost him his match for the TNA Television Championship against Robbie E on the December 1 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. Van Dam defeated Daniels at Final Resolution on December 11 again to end their feud.

After wrestling to a double countout on the January 5, 2012, edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Gunner made a failed attempt to piledrive Van Dam into the concrete floor after Van Dam back body dropped him onto it. On January 8 at Genesis, Van Dam was defeated by Gunner and was afterwards stretchered backstage, after taking a DDT onto the concrete floor.

At United We Stand on April 4, 2019, he teamed with Sabu and faced Lucha Bros (Pentagón Jr. and Fénix) in a hardcore match. After indicating in interviews that he would be working with the company more, on April 3, Van Dam announced that he had signed a short-term deal with Impact and would be appearing on their programming following United We Stand. His contract initially ran through Bound for Glory in October. His return to Impact television occurred in late-April, where he defeated Ethan Page. Van Dam then formed an alliance with ECW alumni Tommy Dreamer and Sabu to feud with Page, Josh Alexander and Moose. The trio would defeat Moose, Page and Alexander in a six-man tag. At Bash at the Brewery in July, Van Dam defeated Sami Callihan in an Extreme Rules match. A few days later, the storyline between Moose and Van Dam came to a close, as Moose defeated Van Dam at Slammiversary XVII.
On October 20, 2019, on Bound for Glory, Van Dam teamed with Rhino where they challenged for the Impact World Tag Team Championship. At the climax of the match, Van Dam turned heel for the first time in his Impact Wrestling career, as well as his first heel turn since being a member of the Alliance during his WWF/E career, by attacking Rhino, Willie Mack, and Rich Swann, losing the match in the process. During early 2020, Van Dam was part of a censorious heel stable called &quot;Cancel Culture&quot; along with Joey Ryan and Jake Crist.

==Professional wrestling style, persona and reception==
The name &quot;Rob Van Dam&quot; was given to him in 1992 by Ron Slinker, a promoter in Florida, possibly because of his martial arts experience and his resemblance to actor Jean-Claude Van Damme. During the early years of his career, he used a &quot;Moonsault Split&quot; as finisher, until he adopted the Frog Splash (named Five Star Frog Splash) as finisher. During WWE Hall of Fame ceremony in 2021, WWE&#x27;s chairman Vince McMahon and Triple H said that he changed the style of wrestling.

== Personal life ==

Szatkowski is of Belgian and Polish ancestry. Szatkowski married Sonia Delbeck on September 6, 1998, the couple separated in December 2015. In July 2016, Delbeck filed for divorce from Szatkowski. The divorce was finalized in May 2018. In 2016, Szatkowski began dating fellow professional wrestler Katie Forbes. In 2021, Forbes and Szatkowski had gotten married.

=== Cannabis ===
Szatkowski is an advocate for the legalization of cannabis. He has discussed the topic in various media, including on MSNBC where he debated former U.S. &quot;drug czar&quot; Barry McCaffrey. Szatkowski is also a consumer of cannabis, believing it to be an athletic enhancer. His personal affinity for cannabis has been reflected in his wrestling persona, including his use of the phrase &quot;RVD 420 means I just smoked your ass.&quot;

In 2020, Szatkowski established and licensed his name to RVDCBD, a cannabinoids company specializing in CBD and cannabis paraphernalia. In 2021, he was named chairman of United American Petroleum Corp (UAPC), a shell company that acquired RVDCBD and seeks to acquire other cannabis properties.

==== 2006 arrest ====
On July 3, 2006, &quot;The Ironton Tribune&quot; reported that Szatkowski and Terry Brunk (known as Sabu) had been arrested on the previous evening on U.S. Route 52 in Hanging Rock, Ohio. Szatkowski had been stopped for speeding by an Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper, who discovered that he was in possession of 18 grams of marijuana and five Vicodin pills, while Brunk was in possession of drug paraphernalia and nine tablets of testolactone. Both Szatkowski and Brunk were released after posting bail, and were scheduled to appear in Ironton Municipal Court on July 6. On July 6, &quot;The Ironton Tribune&quot; reported that the court date for Szatkowski and Brunk were in limbo, as their attorneys had asked for and were granted continuances. On August 31, Szatkowski pleaded guilty to speeding and possession of marijuana but the charge of Vicodin possession was dropped when he produced a prescription. He was fined $140 and additional court costs.

According to the WWE&#x27;s wellness policy, a drug-related arrest can lead to that talent&#x27;s immediate dismissal from the company. Then-WWE Vice President of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis released a statement on WWE.com reporting that Szatkowski and Brunk were still eligible to compete on the &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;ECW&quot; tapings in the following days while an investigation conducted by WWE was being undertaken. This resulted in Szatkowski dropping the WWE Championship at the live &quot;Raw&quot; one night and the ECW Championship the next night at the &quot;ECW&quot; taping. Van Dam was subsequently suspended without pay for 30 days, and an on-air segment on &quot;ECW&quot; was scripted to relay this suspension to the fans. The arrest footage itself and a recounting from Szatkowski is seen in the film &quot;Nine Legends&quot;.

=== Training ===
Szatkowski is a trained kickboxer and martial artist. Growing up in Battle Creek, Michigan, Szatkowski studied martial arts at two local dojos. He received instruction in Karate, Taekwondo, Aikido, Kickboxing and Kajukenbo. In 1990, he placed second in the Kalamazoo Heavyweight Toughman Contest. Szatkowski is also an outspoken advocate of vitamins and bodybuilding supplements and attributes this to his mother&#x27;s influence.

He is the inventor of the &quot;Van Dam Lift&quot;, a weightlifting technique that involves performing a split (which he took up in his early teens) between two benches and lifting a dumbbell from the floor to the waist. The lift was approved by IAWA, the International All-Around Weightlifting Association, in 1998. It was also entered in the rulebooks of USAWA, the United States All-Round Weightlifting Association.

<doc id="306405" wikidata="Q7729846" url="?curid=306405" title="The Destiny of The Mother Church">
<text>The Destiny of The Mother Church is a book about Christian Science written by Bliss Knapp, published privately by him in 1947, and publicly in 1991 by Christian Science Publishing Society. Knapp and his parents, Ira O. and Flavia Stickney Knapp, all knew Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy. His parents were students of hers and his father was one of the original members of the Board of Directors of The First Church of Christ, Scientist (&quot;The Mother Church&quot;). Until 1991, the book was repeatedly rejected for publication by the church&#x27;s Board of Directors because of its depiction of Eddy as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and equating her with Jesus, a position which Eddy considered blasphemous. &quot;Destiny&#x27;s&quot; publication caused divisions within the church, including several resignations of prominent church employees. Critics claimed that the failure of the church&#x27;s then-recent television venture, which had cost the church several hundred million dollars, had motivated the Board&#x27;s reversal on publishing Knapp&#x27;s book. Knapp, his wife and her sister left wills that granted bequests totalling over $100 million (in 1990s dollars) promised to the church if the book were to be published. The wills set a time limit of 20 years for the book to be published, otherwise the bequests were to be divided between Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the church would receive nothing. The 1973 death of Knapp&#x27;s wife set the date of the time limit to May 1993.

== Controversy ==
Both of Bliss Knapp&#x27;s parents were students of Eddy, and Ira O. Knapp was one of her students who believed her to be the &quot;woman of prophecy&quot;, a view also held by his son. In 1925, the younger Knapp wrote a book about his parents, which he later expanded to include chapters on his view of Eddy&#x27;s identity as the &quot;woman clothed with the sun&quot; described in . Eddy herself taught that the woman &quot;symbolizes generic man, the spiritual idea of God&quot;. She strongly rejected any to Jesus. Nonetheless, her own difficulties establishing a new religion did make her identify with the apocalyptic woman&#x27;s &quot;travailing in birth&quot;, the dragon&#x27;s persecution of the woman and other symbolism in the chapter.

Knapp published &quot;Destiny&quot; privately in 1947 and sent a book draft of &quot;Destiny&quot; to the Christian Science Board of Directors requesting that the church publish it as authorized literature. In a six-page reply in February 1948, they cited numerous points they regarded as departures from Eddy&#x27;s teaching and said they could not publish the book without those points being corrected. Knapp did not revise the book as they proposed, but left a trust with approximately $100 million in 1990s dollars to revert to the Christian Science church if it published his work as &quot;authorized literature&quot;, an official designation that identifies a work as being in consonance with Christian Science teaching. The trust set up a 20-year time limitation; with the death of Knapp&#x27;s wife in 1973, that date became May 1993.

In September 1991, the Christian Science Board of Directors decided to publish &quot;The Destiny of The Mother Church&quot;, despite charges of blasphemy and protests that doing so violated the &quot;Manual of The Mother Church&quot;, which governs the church, including its publishing arm. It created a 15-book series of biographies of Eddy, the first time the church had published anything new about her in years.

A church spokesman defended the decision to publish saying that, since Knapp had known Eddy personally, his book was historically valuable and the decision had nothing to do with the bequest. The church treasurer, however, told the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; that the church&#x27;s board of directors would have been &quot;fiscally irresponsible&quot; not to have discussed publishing &quot;Destiny&quot;. The church had lost substantial sums of money in its television venture, begun in 1986, reallocating funds from its newspaper, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, to the extent that its editor, Kay Fanning and others resigned in protest, then borrowing $41.5 million from its pension fund, $20 million from a restricted endowment fund and another $5 million from money left to the church by Eddy. In 1992, the church estimated it had lost $327.5 million. In addition, membership had been in decline, reducing income.

The third printing of the book was marked &quot;authorized literature&quot;. In 1992, at the annual meeting of church members held in Boston, Al M. Carnesciali, manager of the Publishing Society, spoke of &quot;Christian Science literature&quot; as opposed to &quot;authorized literature&quot;, a term which signified that which the church endorsed as being consonant with official church teachings. Carnesciali made a distinction between &quot;Christian Science literature&quot; consonant with official church teachings and &quot;authorized literature&quot;, which did not have to be doctrinally &quot;correct&quot;. Additionally, the Publishing Society announced that it considered &quot;books&quot; to be a separate category from &quot;literature,&quot; and that although &quot;Destiny&quot; was not considered &quot;literature,&quot; it qualified as a &quot;book&quot; as well as &quot;authorized literature.&quot;

In order to fulfill the terms of the trust, the book was to be designated &quot;authorized literature&quot; and prominently displayed in &quot;substantially all&quot; Christian Science reading rooms. The Knapp estate reached a compromise with the church in October 1993, allowing the church to publish the book without declaring it &quot;authorized literature&quot; and split the bequest with the other two beneficiaries. This was challenged by a Knapp family member who said Bliss Knapp had stipulated there be full compliance with the trust. In addition, a group of church members sought the court to prevent distribution based on the &quot;Manual&quot; by-law prohibiting the church from publishing &quot;incorrect literature.&quot; In addition, many reading rooms refused to carry the book, though precise figures are difficult to establish.

The court challenges failed and the money was eventually distributed three ways, with the church getting 53% and Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Art Museum splitting the rest.

==Church Board withdraws support in 2023==
Acknowledging their earlier mistake, the Christian Science Board of Directors, with the concurrence of the Trustees of the Christian Science Publishing Society, withdrew the book from publication in September 2023. In a message published in &quot;The Christian Science Journal&quot;, the board of directors acknowledged the difficulty of adhering to some of the requirements of Knapp&#x27;s bequest and noted that some of the ideas in the book had caused &quot;confusion&quot;.

<text>Brevet Brigadier-General James Miller (April 25, 1776 – July 7, 1851) was a senior officer of the United States Army who commanded infantry in the Canadian Theater of the War of 1812. After the war, he served as the first governor of Arkansas Territory from 1819 to 1824. He also served as the superintendent of Indian affairs for the territory. It was during his term as governor, and partly due to his influence, that the territory&#x27;s capital was moved from Arkansas Post to Little Rock.

==Early life and education==
James Miller was born in Peterborough, New Hampshire, to James and Catharine (née Gregg) Miller. He attended an academy at Amherst, Massachusetts, and then Williams College. After Martha&#x27;s death, he married Ruth Flint. Miller was a descendant of Thomas Flint, an Englishman who migrated to Concord, Massachusetts. He had a law practice in Greenfield, New Hampshire, from 1803 to 1808.

==Military service==
Miller joined the New Hampshire state militia and commanded an artillery unit, until General Benjamin Pierce noticed him and recommended that he be commissioned as a major in the regular army. Miller joined with the 4th Infantry Regiment in 1808. In 1811, Miller&#x27;s unit went to fight Indians in Vincennes, Indiana, where he was promoted to colonel. In May 1812, his regiment moved to Detroit, Michigan. He was the commander during the Battle of Maguagon. Shortly afterwards, Miller was taken prisoner following the Siege of Detroit and was later exchanged. In 1814, Miller was colonel of the 21st Infantry Regiment and led his men in the capture of the British artillery at the Battle of Niagara. His &quot;I will try, sir!&quot; quote became famous and he earned the name of &quot;Hero of Lundy&#x27;s Lane&quot;. Miller was brevetted brigadier-general, presented a gold medal by resolution of Congress on November 8, 1814, and a sword by the State of New York.

==War of 1812==

===Engagement at bridge near Fort Malden===
When the War of 1812 began against the United Kingdom, Colonel James Miller conducted military operations in Canada. On July 16, 1812. A contingent of the British 41st Regiment-about 60 militia troops and some Indians were posted near a bridge near British-held Fort Malden. Colonel Lewis Cass and American Army Colonel James Miller with their troops were in concealed positions. The British detected the American recon force commanded by Colonel Lewis Cass and American Army Colonel James Miller. The British sent a party of Indians over the bridge to draw the Americans out; however, once the Indians crossed, the concealed Americans opened fire wounding 2 Indians and killing 1 Indian. The American officers send word to allow the American recon force to take the fort and hold it till reinforcements arrive. But American commander Hull is very unsupportive and indecisive of this opportunity. So the recon force under Cass and Miller withdraw back to American lines.

===Battle of Maguaga===
American general William Hull sent James Miller to retrieve a convoy of supplies. Miller set out with at least 280 regulars, at least 200-280 Ohio militiamen, 60 Michigan Legionnaires, 40 mounted spies and 2 artillery pieces. Miller encounters an enemy force of British regulars, Canadian militia, and pro-British Native Americans under the leadership of Adam Muir. The opposing forces open fire on each other. Miller opens fire also with his artillery and launches a bayonet attack. After a long engagement, the British-allied force retreated. Although the Americans were the victors, the Americans suffered substantial casualties including 18 killed and at least 64 wounded. Muir recorded 3 killed, 13 wounded and 2 missing from his 41st Regiment; 1 killed and 2 wounded from the Canadian Militia and 2 killed and 6 wounded from the Native American contingent. However, the Americans claimed they found 58 dead enemies on the field with 30-40 of them being Indians. The Americans also claimed the Ohio militia took 30-40 scalps of the Indians. Miller, believing his force was too battered, withdrew back to fort Detroit.

===Siege of Fort Detroit===
The American forces at Fort Detroit are besieged by the British. The Americans were well entrenched and in good defensive positions in the fort. James Miller was ill in the fort. But the British who had a smaller force used deception to make their force look bigger and tricked the more numerous Americans under general William Hull to surrender. James Miller was taken prisoner before being exchanged.

===Ambushing cannoneers and taking a hill at Lundy’s Lane===
At the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane American general Jacob Brown’s forces were facing heavy bombardment from British artillery.There was a position on a hill where the British were firing their deadly artillery. General Jacob Brown turned to Colonel James Miller and requested him to take the hill position. Colonel Miller complied. James Miller took at least 300 regulars with him to take the hill. To mask Colonel Miller&#x27;s advance, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas with his First Regiment drew the enemy&#x27;s fire directing the enemy&#x27;s attention from Miller&#x27;s movement, but in short time gave up and retreated. But this short timed diversion allowed Colonel Miller to reach the hill and Miller had his men take concealed positions behind an old rail fence, along which was a growth of thick, low shrubbery. After approaching undiscovered, in whispers Miller ordered his men to rest their pieces across the fence, take good aim, and ambush the British cannon gunners by shooting them dead. The American soldiers concealed behind the shrubbery fence fired, killing all the gunners. Then Miller and his men charged engaging more British soldiers lying nearby to protect the cannons before driving the British off. Miller held the position against countless British infantry assaults. After fierce fighting on the battlefield between the American forces and British forces. Both of the armies of America and Britain suffered heavy casualties that they were no longer in any condition to fight. The American forces including the division under James Miller withdrew from the battlefield. The British army that was so battered were in no condition to follow them.

===Hit-and-run sortie at Fort Erie===
During the Siege of Fort Erie, the British suffered heavy casualties after making costly infantry assaults on the American entrenched fort. The Americans who were deeply entrenched in their fort&#x27;s defenses suffered minor casualties. The American commander Jacob Brown then wanted to conduct hit-and-run sorties on the British to cause heavier casualties on the British, disable their artillery, and destroy the magazine supplies. James Miller was ordered to conduct one sortie while Peter B. Porter was to lead the other. Peter B. Porter would lead a raiding sortie of militia and regulars while James Miller would lead a raiding party of regulars. The American raiders would infiltrate British lines to conduct their mission. Porter secretly led his force traveling along a hidden road using the cover of the woods while Miller led his force secretly in a ravine. The American raiders attacked the British by surprise and full ferocity. In the chaotic attack, the Americans destroyed 3 batteries of cannons, blew up the magazine, and inflicted heavy casualties on the British. Afterwards, all the American raiders withdrew back into the fort. The British suffered 115 killed, 178 wounded, and 316 missing. The American raiders led by Porter and Miller suffered 79 killed, 216 wounded, and 216 missing. Even though the American sorties completed their objectives, it was still costly in terms of casualties for the Americans. Some time later, the entire American force at fort erie would evacuate to Sackets Harbor.

== Governor of Arkansas Territory ==
Appointed governor of Arkansas Territory by President James Monroe on March 3, 1819, Miller resigned from the army, but did not leave New England for his governorship until September. He traveled to Washington, D.C. first, where he learned that he would also serve as the superintendent of Indian affairs for the Arkansas Territory. He traveled to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and acquired armaments for the territorial militia. He then traveled down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers with the armaments in tow, arriving at Arkansas Post on December 26, on a vessel flying flags reading &quot;Arkansaw&quot; and &quot;I will try, sir!&quot;

Due to Miller&#x27;s tardiness, Robert Crittenden, the secretary of the territory, had been running the state and filling necessary appointments which were validated by Congress. Miller focused his attentions on finding a suitable location for a territorial capital. Since a number of influential men, including Miller, in the territorial legislature had purchased lots in the Little Rock area, the bill moving the capital from Arkansas Post to Little Rock passed the territorial legislature.

As superintendent of Indian affairs, Miller dealt with the considerable debate over Quapaw, Cherokee, and Choctaw land claims and the desire for American whites to take the land for themselves. To make matters more confusing for Miller, warfare between the Cherokee and the Osage erupted within the territory in 1821. From the beginning of his term, it was clear that he did not plan to stay in Arkansas, as his wife remained in New Hampshire. Miller left the torrid Arkansas summer for cooler New Hampshire in April 1821, was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society on June 28, 1821, returning the following November. In his absences, Crittenden ran Arkansas and made decisions regarding Indian affairs. In June 1823, he left Arkansas and did not return at all that year.

== Later life and death ==
In the fall of 1824, Miller was elected to the House of Representatives in New Hampshire but never took office. Instead he was appointed collector of the Port of Salem, a post he served in until 1849. It is in this role that he is portrayed as the General in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Custom-House, an Introductory to The Scarlet Letter&quot;. He died at Temple, New Hampshire of a stroke and was buried in Harmony Grove Cemetery at Salem, Massachusetts.

==Memorials==
Miller County, Arkansas, and Miller State Park in Peterborough, New Hampshire, are both named after him. Fort Miller in Marblehead, Massachusetts, was renamed for him circa 1861.

<text>Chicago soul is a style of soul music that arose during the 1960s in Chicago. Along with Detroit, the home of Motown, and Memphis, with its hard-edged, gritty performers (see Memphis soul), Chicago and the Chicago soul style helped spur the album-oriented soul revolution of the early 1970s.

The sound of Chicago soul, like southern soul with its rich influence of black gospel music, also exhibited an unmistakable gospel sound, but was somewhat lighter and more delicate in its approach. Chicago vocal groups tended to feature laid-back sweet harmonies, while solo artists exhibited a highly melodic and somewhat pop approach to their songs.

Accompaniment usually featured highly orchestrated arrangements, with horns and strings, by such notable arrangers as Johnny Pate (who largely worked with horns) and Riley Hampton (who specialized in strings). This kind of soul music is sometimes called &quot;soft soul&quot;, to distinguish it from the more harsh and gospel-like &quot;hard soul&quot; style.

==Notable labels==
A variety of labels in the city during the 1960s and 1970s contributed to the Chicago soul sound, most notably Vee-Jay, Constellation Records, Chess Records, Mercury Records, OKeh, ABC-Paramount, One-derful, Brunswick and its Dakar Records subsidiary, and Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s Curtom label.

===Vee-Jay===
Vee-Jay Records was Chicago&#x27;s pioneer soul label. In 1958 it produced the first recognized soul hit in Chicago, Jerry Butler and The Impressions&#x27; &quot;For Your Precious Love.&quot; The company, before it went bankrupt in 1966, produced under A&amp;R director Calvin Carter, many notable soul acts in the Chicago soft soul idiom, notably Butler (best known for &quot;He Will Break Your Heart&quot;), Betty Everett (&quot;The Shoop Shoop Song (It&#x27;s in His Kiss)&quot;), Dee Clark (&quot;Raindrops&quot;), and Gene Chandler (&quot;Duke of Earl&quot;). Vee Jay was also the first American record label to sign and record The Beatles in the U.S in 1962. The label released several singles but were unsuccessful in scoring a major hit. In 1964 Vee-Jay released The Beatles&#x27; first U.S. album titled &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot;. After having management issues at the label and a shortage of funds, the label could not promote the record and give it the push that was needed. So the label was forced to release the group.

===Chess===
Chess Records, under A&amp;R director and producer Roquel Billy Davis, featured such Chicago soul style acts as the vocal harmony groups The Dells (&quot;Stay in My Corner&quot;) and the Radiants (&quot;Voice Your Choice&quot;), female singers Jan Bradley (&quot;Mama Didn&#x27;t Lie&quot;), Fontella Bass (&quot;Rescue Me&quot;), and Jackie Ross (&quot;Selfish One&quot;), and male vocalists such as Bo Diddley&#x27;s protégé Billy Stewart (&quot;I Do Love You&quot;). Chess&#x27; biggest female soul artist, Etta James, performed both in the soft style (&quot;At Last&quot;) and the hard style (&quot;Tell Mama&quot;).

===OKeh===
OKeh Records was a subsidiary of Columbia Records, but it produced a number of hits by Chicago artists, produced by A&amp;R director Carl Davis in the company&#x27;s Chicago office. Most of the songs performed by OKeh artists came from the pen of Curtis Mayfield, and OKeh recordings best typified the distinctive sound of Chicago soul. Best known Chicago artists on OKeh were Major Lance (&quot;The Monkey Time&quot; ), Walter Jackson (&quot;It&#x27;s All Over&quot;), Billy Butler (&quot;Right Track&quot;), and the Artistics (&quot;Get My Hands on Some Lovin&#x27;&quot;).

===Brunswick===
Brunswick Records is a New York-based label, but under the aegis of producer and A&amp;R man Carl Davis in Chicago, the company produced a large body of Chicago style soul, beginning in 1966, when Jackie Wilson started recording in Chicago. Wilson&#x27;s biggest hit with Davis was &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher.&quot; Other Brunswick artists included The Chi-Lites (&quot;Oh Girl&quot;), The Artistics (&quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Miss You&quot;), Barbara Acklin (&quot;Love Makes A Woman&quot;), Tyrone Davis (&quot;Turn Back the Hands of Time&quot;), and Gene Chandler (&quot;The Girl Don&#x27;t Care&quot;). Brunswick was eventually acquired by Carl Davis, and the offices moved to the Record Row (South Michigan Avenue).

===Chi-Sound===
Another label active in Chicago in the mid-to-late 1970s was Chi-Sound Records, under the production aegis of Carl Davis. Chi-Sound, besides recording the Chi-Lites, Dells, and Gene Chandler, had a number of disco-soul acts between 1976 and 1982, including Windy City, Magnum Force, Sidney Joe Qualls (previously signed to the Brunswick Records subsidiary, Dakar, in the early 1970s), Ebony Rhythm Funk Campaign and Manchild.

===ABC-Paramount===
ABC-Paramount was based in New York, but it recorded a number of Chicago soul acts through its Chicago offices, most notably The Impressions, led by guitarist and songwriter Curtis Mayfield. The Impressions were best known for such hits as &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot; and &quot;People Get Ready.&quot; Another Chicago soul act that recorded for ABC-Paramount was The Marvelows (&quot;I Do&quot;).

===Mercury===
In Chicago, Mercury Records was formed by Irving Green, Berle Adams, Arthur Talmadge and Ray Greenberg in 1945. The label released soul, R&amp;B, doo-wop, blues, jazz, and pop music. 
From the 1950s to the 1980s, Mercury released records of musicians such as Jerry Butler, Phil Philips, the Platters, Brook Benton, Ohio Players, the Bar-Kays, Con Funk Shun, Cameo, Kool and the Gang, Kurtis Blow, Heaven &amp; Earth and the Gap Band.

===One-derful===
The One-derful label complex (One-derful, M-Pac, Mar-V-lus, Midas, Halo, Toddlin&#x27; Town) represented mostly the harder gospelly style of Chicago soul music. Its most notable artists were Otis Clay (&quot;That&#x27;s How It Is&quot;), Harold Burrage (&quot;Got to Find A Way&quot;), McKinley Mitchell (&quot;The Town I Live In&quot;), and The Five Du-Tones (&quot;Shake a Tail Feather&quot;). The company also had dance hits with Alvin Cash and the Crawlers (&quot;Twine Time&quot;). The entire catalog has been purchased by Minneapolis-based Secret Stash Records.

===Constellation===
Constellation Records was formed in August 1963 by Ewart Abner, Bill &quot;Bunky&quot; Sheppard, and Art Sheridan. Abner was ousted from Vee-Jay, and took with him from Vee-Jay producer Bill &quot;Bunky&quot; Sheppard, and two Vee-Jay artists that were personally under contract to Abner, namely Gene Chandler and Dee Clark. Art Sheridan had run Chance Records in the early 1950s, and had been an investor in Vee-Jay. Chandler prospered at Constellation, getting huge national hits for the next three years, notably &quot;Just Be True&quot; and &quot;Nothing Can Stop Me,&quot; while Dee Clark got only local hits, notably &quot;Warm Summer Breezes&quot; and &quot;Heartbreak.&quot; Another Constellation artists were Lee Dorsey, Billy &#x27;The Kid&#x27; Emerson and others.

===Curtom===
Curtom was owned by Curtis Mayfield, and the label began recording Chicago soul talent in 1968. The label better represents the post-soul era in Chicago black music, as it specialized in funk and disco recordings, and became a notable producer of soundtracks for black films. Mayfield became a solo artist while at Curtom, and his &quot;Super Fly&quot; soundtrack (1972), with its funk style, represents the label&#x27;s biggest seller. Other Curtom artists were disco singer Linda Clifford (&quot;Runaway Love&quot;), the Natural Four (&quot;Can This Be Real&quot;), and the Staple Singers (&quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;). Predating Curtom, Mayfield ran the labels Windy C (Five Stairsteps, Holly Maxwell, June Conquest), and Mayfield (Fascinations, The Mayfield Singers) (which featured two future soul stars: Donny Hathaway and Leroy Hutson, and Holly Maxwell).

In 1980, Mayfield closed the Curtom office and moved to Atlanta, and not long afterwards Brunswick closed its office, which had by then moved to Chicago, as well. With these closings, and with disco and funk replacing traditional soul in popular appeal, Chicago soul music had effectively come to an end.

<doc id="306417" wikidata="Q4926861" url="?curid=306417" title="Bliss Knapp">
<text>Bliss Knapp (June 7, 1877 – March 14, 1958), the son of Ira O. and Flavia S. Knapp, students of Mary Baker Eddy, was an early Christian Science lecturer, practitioner, teacher and the author of &quot;The Destiny of the Mother Church&quot;.

==Childhood==
Bliss Knapp, C.S.B., was born on June 7, 1877, in Lyman, New Hampshire. His parents, Ira Oscar Knapp and Flavia Stickney Knapp, were students of Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, and they were pioneering workers in its growth. Ira Knapp was one of the original directors to whom Mrs. Eddy deeded the land on which the Original Edifice of the Mother Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts, was built.

Bliss Knapp&#x27;s mother Flavia had studied under Eddy at the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston, having completed her Primary in April 1889. In the summer of 1895 she taught a Primary class with Bliss as a member. He finished this class before the beginning of the fall session at the university. Bliss&#x27;s sister Daphne was in Mrs. Eddy&#x27;s last class of 1898, the so-called &quot;Class of Seventy&quot; as seventy invitations had been sent out although 67 attended. Mrs. Knapp was selected as the first teacher in the new Board of Education. Mrs. Knapp taught 85 primary class pupils as a teacher of Christian Science. She was selected to teach the 1898 Normal class but died on March 15, 1898.

==Academic and religious education==

Mrs. Eddy had requested that Bliss receive the finest education available in his day. Bliss initially entered Harvard part-time while studying Latin and Mathematics to bring them up to college level. He entered Harvard full-time in 1898. Despite evidence to the contrary, Mrs. Eddy saw much spiritual promise in the shy young man who couldn&#x27;t find the courage to so much as get up and give a testimony at the Wednesday evening meetings until after he had been appointed to the Christian Science Board of Lectureship.

==Early church work==
While at Harvard, Knapp helped organize informal services among Christian Scientists. Initially held as receptions at the home of William P. McKenzie, prominent lecturers on Christian Science such as Edward A. Kimball of Chicago, Illinois, and Irving Tomlinson of Concord, New Hampshire, addressed these gatherings. Later after his graduation, Bliss and his cousin Edwin Johnson were instrumental in encouraging Mrs. Eddy to establish a church-sanctioned way to hold services at colleges and universities. Mrs. Eddy&#x27;s response dated February 12, 1904, was a letter including her proposed changes to the By-laws of her Church known as the Manual of The Mother Church, which, with a few changes, would allow for the establishing what today are known as Christian Science College Organizations (in Article XXII Section 8). Harvard University thus became home to the first such Christian Science college organization and held the first lecture sponsored by such an organization, which was delivered by Judge Septimus J. Hanna in December 1905.

In his last year at Harvard, in March 1901, Bliss was notified by William B. Johnson, Clerk of the Mother Church that, &quot;by recommendation of our Beloved Teacher, the Reverend Mary Baker Eddy, and the unanimous vote of the CS Board of Directors, you have been made a First Member of The First Church of Christ, Scientist.&quot;

Immediately upon graduation in June 1901, Bliss Knapp entered the public practice of Christian Science healing with the encouragement of Eddy. In 1902, he was appointed Assistant Superintendent of the Children&#x27;s Sunday School of the Mother Church.

==Attends the Massachusetts Metaphysical College==
In November 1903 Bliss was selected to attend the primary class of the Massachusetts Metaphysical College, now under the Board of Education, and he was taught with Judge W.G. Ewing, Mrs. And Mrs. Archibald McClellan, Judge and Mrs. Clifford P. Smith and Mr. and Mrs. Ella S. Rathvon by a well-known student of Mrs. Eddy, Edward A. Kimball, C.S.D.

==Career as a Christian Science lecturer==
On Mrs. Eddy&#x27;s encouragement, in 1904 Bliss Knapp began his career as a Christian Science lecturer which would last, off and on, until 1931. Mrs. Eddy had approved his appointment even while her own students such as Calvin Frye said that he was hopelessly shy. Many years later Bliss would recall this appointment, explaining that, &quot;Mrs. Eddy knew that I had an extreme case of bashfulness when she decided to appoint me to the Board of Lectureship. Calvin Frye told me later he warned Mrs. Eddy she was making a mistake in placing one who was so fearful and timid on the Board, but she waived his objections aside. When I got her letter telling me what she proposed to do, I could have said with (the Hebrew prophet) Job, &#x27;The thing I greatly feared hath come upon me.&#x27; Then I aroused myself from that and realized that Mrs. Eddy would never think of appointing me to the Board of Lectureship unless she believed that I could do it. Then what would hinder me but a belief of self and a wilful determination to be afraid, both of which are unlovely and unworthy of a hearing. So I went forward until I achieved enough to win Mrs. Eddy&#x27;s unqualified approval of my work.&quot;

Bliss Knapp&#x27;s first lecture was given in White Mountains, New Hampshire, and was introduced by one of Mrs. Eddy&#x27;s students, Miss Emma C. Shipman.

==Knapp&#x27;s Association of Students ==
Bliss Knapp&#x27;s students continued to meet annually and to hear a morning address that was usually written by one of his students. Bliss Knapp&#x27;s Students&#x27; Association which voted to disband in 2007.

==Knapp biography written by his student==
In the late 1990s, Knapp student and former Principia College professor, Charles Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Houpt published a biography on Knapp called, &quot;Bliss Knapp - Christian Scientist.&quot; The author made extensive use of Knapp letters to his family and students.

==Eddy actively supports Knapp&#x27;s lecture work==
Upon receiving his first lecture, Mrs. Eddy wrote to Bliss Knapp in August 1904 that she was pleased with it and that the excerpts she has read were &quot;clear, logical and high-toned.&quot; She sent him a book called The Essentials of Elocution by Alfred Ayres, Funk and Wagnalls, New York, 1897.

Mrs. Eddy helped edit his lecture &quot;Christian Science: Its Nature and Purpose&quot; in her own handwriting, making eleven changes in the body of the lecture and all but one in the section &quot;Christian Science no Will Power&quot;. They were changes in diction, not content. Clearly Mrs. Eddy approved of his lecture and its metaphysics as Christian Science, &quot;pure religion and undefiled.&quot; Mrs. Eddy was so pleased with the final lecture, she asked that it be printed in pamphlet form in 1906 for distribution, and translated into French in 1908 and (in Mrs. Eddy&#x27;s own words) &quot;given to the world.&quot;

==Destiny of the Mother Church controversy==
In the early 1920s, Bliss Knapp authored a biography of his parents, Ira and Flavia Stickney Knapp. In 1948 he wrote a book called &quot;The Destiny of the Mother Church,&quot; incorporating the biographical information on his parents from the earlier work as well as some of his beliefs about Mrs. Eddy. These beliefs were at the heart of a controversy that continues to this day. Knapp held that Eddy represented a personal fulfilment of biblical prophecy as the woman referred to in the twelfth chapter of the Book of Revelation. While Knapp&#x27;s father, Ira Knapp, had subscribed to that belief himself, and had been selected by Eddy to be the first person to serve as chairman of the Christian Science Board of Directors, during a libel suit by Josephine Custis Woodbury in 1892, Ira was forced, under oath in court, to concede Eddy had never taught this interpretation herself. While this concession in court was made by Knapp, others felt that Knapp meant that Mrs. Eddy, as a mortal, could not be that Woman, but as an idea of God, she, in fact could be related to that woman. It was felt by supporters of Mrs. Eddy as &quot;the Woman,&quot; that any attempt to paint Mrs. Eddy in this light would meet with universal condemnation of her and her church for deifying her and so, this line of thought went, this notion should never be put forth as any official view of the Church but might be privately taught. But even at that time, students of Mrs. Eddy such as the highly successful lecturer, Edward Kimball, CSD, were of the opinion that Mrs. Eddy discovered Christian Science because she simply climbed the mountain of spiritual inspiration until, like someone ascending a mountain during the night, she was the first to glimpse the sun from that elevated point.

Eddy herself did not hesitate to identify with the impersonal spiritual type the woman represented and apparently tolerated ambiguities on the subject. Her relationship to Biblical prophecy is not an essential theological point in Christian Science and is not included in its tenets. However, opponents of Knapp&#x27;s view argued Eddy disavowed individual, personal interpretations specifically. She had written in her final edition of Science and Health, &quot;The woman in the Apocalypse symbolizes generic man [her term for all mankind, understood spiritually], the spiritual idea of God; she illustrates the coincidence of God and man as the divine Principle and divine idea&quot; (p. 561). In comments elsewhere she expanded the distinction, writing, &quot;What St. John saw in prophetic vision and depicted as &#x27;a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet&#x27; prefigured no speciality or individuality. His vision foretold a type, and this type applied to man as well as to woman...&quot;

Knapp incorporated his teachings into an early book draft, &quot;The Destiny of The Mother Church&quot;, following which the Christian Science Board of Directors wrote a six-page letter in February 1948 politely rebuking numerous points they regarded as at variance from Eddy&#x27;s teaching. Knapp then withdrew the book, but instead of revising it as they proposed, he disregarded their comments and expanded it for private issue instead, leaving it in trust with approximately $100 million in 1990s dollars, acquired by way of his marriage to Eloise Mabury (m. March 27, 1918), to revert to the Church of Christ, Scientist if it ever published his work as &quot;authorized literature&quot;.

The board of directors voted in 1990 to print The Destiny of The Mother Church, to the surprise of many of its members, arguing that the book did not have to bear the burden of theological correctness. Other members however argued that this was in violation of the Church Manual bylaw &quot;No Incorrect Literature&quot;. The church proceeded to issue the book unannotated as required, as part of a series of biographies of the church&#x27;s founder. In 1991, Archivist Lee Johnson retired. An unknown number of Christian Science branch churches voted not to carry the book or simply declined to order it, though precise figures are difficult to establish. The financial disbursement was contested by the alternate beneficiaries, Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, ultimately resulting in a settlement splitting the funds, with half going to the Church and a quarter each going to the other two organizations – itself a violation of Knapp&#x27;s own will&#x27;s provisions.

The book&#x27;s publication attracted a fair deal of unwelcome media attention and continued to be held by some members, in spite of the Church&#x27;s defense, to violate the church&#x27;s basic teachings and its equivalent of constitutional law.

A vocal group of critics of Christian Science church managerial policy including Lee Johnson, and Stephen Gottschalk, a protégé of historian and author, Robert Peel, came together after the publication of the Knapp book to petition the Church management to withdraw the book from publication and to inform the Church membership of their belief that this book contradicted Eddy&#x27;s teachings, thereby violating her Church Manual.

The book was withdrawn from publication in September 2023.

<doc id="306418" wikidata="Q109587074" url="?curid=306418" title="Jangle">
<text>Jangle or jingle-jangle is a sound typically characterized by undistorted, treble-heavy electric guitars (particularly 12-strings) played in a droning chordal style (by strumming or arpeggiating). The sound is mainly associated with pop music as well as 1960s guitar bands, folk rock, and 1980s indie music. It is sometimes classed as its own subgenre, jangle pop. Music critics use the term to suggest guitar pop that evokes a bright mood.

Despite forerunners such as Jackie DeShannon, the Searchers and the Everly Brothers, the Beatles and the Byrds are more commonly credited with launching the popularity of jangle. The name derives from the lyric &quot;in the jingle-jangle morning, I&#x27;ll come following you&quot; from the Byrds&#x27; 1965 rendition of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. Although many subsequent jangle bands drew significantly from the Byrds, they were not necessarily folk rock as the Byrds were.

Since the 1960s, jangle has crossed numerous genres, including power pop, psychedelia, new wave, post-punk, and lo-fi. In the 1980s, the most prominent bands of early indie rock were jangle pop groups such as R.E.M. and the Smiths.

==Definition and origins==
&quot;Jangle&quot; is a noun-adjective that music critics often use in reference to guitar pop with a bright mood. The verb &quot;to jangle&quot;, of Germanic origin, means &quot;to sound discordantly, harshly or unpleasantly&quot;. The more modern usage of the term originated from the lyric &quot;in the jingle-jangle morning, I&#x27;ll come following you&quot; from the Byrds&#x27; 1965 rendition of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, which was underpinned by the chiming sound of an electric 12-string guitar. According to academic/musician Matthew Bannister, the term &quot;implies a more pop, mainstream approach&quot; that is heavily connoted with &quot;indie pure pop&quot;. He writes:

It is also deployed in the context of its own music subgenre, &quot;jangle pop&quot;, which is characterized by trebly, ringing guitars (usually 12-string electrics) and 1960s-style pop melodies. The Everly Brothers and the Searchers laid the foundations for jangle in the late 1950s to mid 1960s, with examples including &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot; (1958) and &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; (1964), John McNally of the Searchers speculated that the Byrds may have been influenced by the guitars in &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; and said that the sound of the song &quot;was a total mistake, and it wasn&#x27;t even done with 12-string guitars. We used two regular six-string guitars playing the same riff and added a little echo and reverb ... and everyone thought we were using 12-strings.&quot;

==Popularization==
Despite coming after the Everly Brothers and the Searchers, the Beatles and the Byrds are commonly credited with launching the popularity of jangle pop, in the mid-1960s, the Beatles inspired many artists to purchase Rickenbacker 12-string guitars through songs such as &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (July 1964), &quot;Words of Love&quot; (October 1964), &quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot; (December 1964), and &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; (June 1965). Rickenbacker guitars were expensive and rare, but could create a clear, ringing sound that could not be reproduced with the more &quot;twangy&quot; Telecaster or the &quot;fatter, less sharp&quot; sound of the Les Paul. Lead guitarist George Harrison&#x27;s use of the Rickenbacker helped to popularize the model, and its jangly sound became so prominent that &quot;Melody Maker&quot; termed it the Beatles&#x27; &quot;secret weapon&quot;.

Harrison appeared playing his Rickenbacker in the Beatles&#x27; 1964 film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;; upon seeing the film, Byrds guitarist Roger McGuinn immediately traded his 6-string acoustic for a 12-string Rickenbacker. The Byrds modeled their sound on the Beatles and prominently featured a Rickenbacker electric 12-string guitar in many of their recordings. What would become popularly known as the &quot;jingle-jangle&quot; or &quot;jangle&quot; sound was unveiled with the Byrds&#x27; debut record &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, released in April 1965.

By June, the single had topped the national charts in the US and UK, helping to spark the folk-rock trend. AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann writes that, following the song&#x27;s success, &quot;it seemed half the recording acts in L.A. either raided the Dylan repertoire for material ... or wrote and recorded material that sounded like it&quot;. Harrison himself copied McGuinn&#x27;s playing style for the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;, released on the December 1965 album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.

==The Byrds&#x27; technique==

To create the Byrds&#x27; jangle, McGuinn drew from his prior experience as a banjoist and played a picking style of rising arpeggios. According to him, the other crucial component was the heavy application of dynamic range compression to compensate for the Rickenbacker&#x27;s lower amount of sustain. He explained:

In addition, McGuinn did not usually play solos, and instead played the 12-string continuously throughout the arrangement. Of other elements in the overall piece, vocals were sung in an impersonal, detached manner. He also spoke of the Byrds&#x27; music as exploring &quot;mechanical sounds&quot; such as jet airplanes. Bannister acknowledges that the &quot;continuity of sensation of drone/jangle combined with emotional detachment may give an affect that can perhaps best be compared to travel, a defining experience of modernity. ... The idea of continual movement connects to young men, associated in modern culture with fast cars, just as rock music and counterculture is associated with &#x27;the road&#x27;.&quot;

==Legacy==

The jangle sound has since become regarded as emblematic of the 1960s and of the decade&#x27;s folk rock movement. In 2018, &quot;Guitar World&quot; contributor Damian Fanelli cited McGuinn&#x27;s &quot;distinctive 12-string Rickenbacker jangle&quot; as among the &quot;most influential and imitated guitar sounds of the past 53 years.&quot; Bannister writes that the sound became ideal for bands with one guitarist who wished to fill out their sound and affect a sense of continuity throughout their music. However, few of the subsequent Byrds-influenced jangle bands were folk rock as the Byrds were. 

Since the 1960s, jangle pop crossed numerous genres, including power pop, new wave, post-punk, psychedelia and lo-fi,in the 1980s, the most prominent bands of early indie rock were &quot;jangle pop&quot; groups such as R.E.M. and the Smiths. &quot;New Sincerity&quot; was also loosely used for a similar group of bands in the Austin, Texas music scene, led by the Reivers, Wild Seeds and True Believers. Interest in the jangle sound came to be supplanted by a preference for pure drone, a device that became common to grunge. This type of drone was regarded as more &quot;authentic&quot; for rock music. It is exemplified mainly by the Pixies&#x27; technique of contrasting a song&#x27;s minimalist verses with loud guitar drones in the chorus.

In the early 2010s, the term &quot;New Melbourne Jangle&quot; was coined to describe a proliferation of indie pop bands in Melbourne, Australia, including Twerps and Dick Diver. These and other Australian groups were subsequently branded as &quot;dolewave&quot;, jangly guitars being a defining characteristic. In a similar way, the term &quot;pop de guitarras&quot; (guitar pop) was used to brand the indie scene of Santiago, Chile, during mid 2010s.

<text>Bodrum () is a town and district of Muğla Province, Turkey. About 200 thousand people live in the district, which covers 650 km2 and includes the town. It is a port town at the entrance to the Gulf of Gökova. Known in ancient times as Halicarnassus, the town was once home to the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, also known as the tomb of Mausolus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

The town was founded by Dorian Greeks. It later fell under Persian rule and became the capital of the satrapy of Caria. Mausolus ruled Caria from here, and after his death in 353 BC, his wife Artemisia built a tomb, called the Mausoleum, for him. Macedonian forces laid siege to the city and captured it in 334 BC. After Alexander&#x27;s death, the city passed to successive Hellenistic rulers and was briefly an independent kingdom until 129 BC, when it came under Roman rule. A series of natural disasters and repeated pirate attacks wreaked havoc on the area, and the city lost its importance by the time of the Byzantine era. The Knights Hospitaller arrived in 1402 and used the remains of the Mausoleum as a quarry to build Bodrum Castle. After the conquest of Rhodes by Suleiman the Magnificent in 1522, the town fell under Ottoman control as the Knights Hospitaller relocated to Europe.

By the 20th century, the town&#x27;s economy was mainly based on fishing and sponge diving, but tourism has become the main industry in Bodrum since the late 20th century. The abundance of visitors has also contributed to Bodrum&#x27;s retail and service industry. Milas–Bodrum Airport and Kos International Airport are the main airports that serve the town. The port has ferries to other nearby Turkish and Greek ports and islands, Kos being the most important. Most of the public transportation in the town is based on local share taxis and buses.

== Etymology ==
The modern name &quot;Bodrum&quot; derives from the town&#x27;s medieval name &quot;Petronium&quot;, which has its roots in the Hospitaller Castle of St. Peter.

In classical antiquity, Bodrum was known as Halicarnassus (Ancient Greek: , ), a major city in ancient Caria. The suffix - () of Greek is indicative of a substrate toponym, meaning that an original non-Greek name influenced or established the place&#x27;s name. It has been proposed that the () part is cognate with Luwian word &quot;&quot;, which means fortress. If so, the city&#x27;s ancient name was probably borrowed from Carian, a Luwic language native to pre-Greek Western Anatolia. The Carian name for Halicarnassus has been tentatively identified with 𐊠𐊣𐊫𐊰 𐊴𐊠𐊥𐊵𐊫𐊰 (&quot;alos k̂arnos)&quot; in inscriptions.

==History==

=== Ancient era ===

Halicarnassus (, or &quot;Alikarnassós&quot;; ), was an ancient Greek city at the site of modern Bodrum in Turkey. Halicarnassus was founded by Dorian Greeks, and the figures on its coins, such as the head of Medusa, Athena, Poseidon, and the trident, support the statement that the mother cities were Troezen and Argos. The inhabitants appear to have accepted Anthes, a son of Poseidon, as their legendary founder, as mentioned by Strabo, and were proud of the title &quot;Antheadae&quot;. The Carian name for Halicarnassus has been tentatively identified with Alosδkarnosδ in inscriptions.

In an early period, Halicarnassus was a member of the Doric Hexapolis, which included Kos, Cnidus, Lindos, Kameiros, and Ialysus; but it was expelled from the league when one of its citizens, Agasicles, took home the prize tripod that he had won in the Triopian games instead of dedicating it according to custom to the Triopian Apollo. In the early 5th century, Halicarnassus was under the sway of Artemisia I of Caria (also known as Artemesia of Halicarnassus), who made herself famous as a naval commander at the battle of Salamis. Little is known of Pisindalis, her son and successor; but Lygdamis, the tyrant of Halicarnassus, who next attained power, is notorious for having the poet Panyasis put to death and forcing Herodotus, possibly the most well-known Halicarnassian, to leave his native city ().

=== Persian rule ===
The city later fell under Persian rule. Under the Persians, it was the capital city of the satrapy of Caria, the region that long afterward constituted its hinterland and of which it was the principal port. Its strategic location ensured that the city enjoyed considerable autonomy. Archaeological evidence from the period, such as the recently discovered Salmakis (&quot;Kaplankalesi&quot;) Inscription, now in Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology, attests to the particular pride its inhabitants had developed.

Mausolus ruled Caria from here, nominally on behalf of the Persians but practically independently, for much of his reign from 377 to 353 BC. When he died in 353 BC, Artemisia II of Caria, who was both his sister and his widow, employed the ancient Greek architects Satyros, Pythis, and the sculptors Bryaxis, Scopas, Leochares, and Timotheus to build a monument and a tomb, known as Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, for him. The word &quot;mausoleum&quot; derives from the structure of this tomb. It was a temple-like structure decorated with reliefs and statuary on a massive base. Today only the foundations and a few pieces of sculpture remain.

=== Hellenistic and Roman periods ===
Alexander the Great laid siege to the city after his arrival in the Carian lands and, together with his ally, Queen Ada of Caria, captured it after fighting in 334 BC. After Alexander&#x27;s death, the rule of the city passed to Antigonus I (311 BC), Lysimachus (after 301 BC), and the Ptolemies (281–197 BC) and was briefly an independent kingdom until 129 BC, when it came under Roman rule. A series of earthquakes destroyed much of the city, as well as the great Mausoleum, while repeated pirate attacks from the Mediterranean wreaked further havoc on the area. By the time of the early Christian Byzantine era, when Halicarnassus was an important bishopric, there was little left of the shining city of Mausolus.

=== Medieval era ===
Crusader Knights arrived in 1402 and used the remains of the Mausoleum as a quarry to build the still impressively standing Bodrum Castle (&quot;Castle of Saint Peter&quot;), a well-preserved example of late Crusader architecture in the eastern Mediterranean. The Knights Hospitaller (&quot;Knights of St. John&quot;) were given permission to build it by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed I after Tamerlane destroyed their previous fortress in İzmir&#x27;s inner bay. 

In 1522, Suleiman the Magnificent conquered the base of the Crusader knights on the island of Rhodes, who then relocated first briefly to Sicily and later permanently to Malta, leaving the Castle of Saint Peter and Bodrum to the Ottoman Empire.

===Modern era===
Bodrum was a quiet town of fishermen and sponge divers until the early 20th century. From 1867 until 1922, it was part of the Aidin Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. In the 1923 population exchange, the Greeks of Bodrum settled in Nea Alikarnassos, Crete in exchange for Muslims of Crete. In her book &quot;Bodrum&quot;, Fatma Mansur points out that the presence of a large community of bilingual Cretan Turks, coupled with the conditions of free trade and access to the southern Dodecanese islands until 1935, made the town less provincial. The fact that traditional agriculture was not a very rewarding activity in the rather dry peninsula also prevented the formation of a class of large landowners. Bodrum has no notable history of political or religious extremism. A first nucleus of intellectuals started to form after the 1950s around the writer Cevat Şakir Kabaağaçlı, who first came here in exile two decades previously and was charmed by the town to the point of adopting the pen name &quot;Halikarnas Balıkçısı&quot; (&#x27;The Fisherman of Halicarnassus&#x27;).

==Geography==

===Climate===
Bodrum has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification and &quot;Cshl&quot; in the Trewartha climate classification). The average temperature is around in winter and in summer, with many sunny spells. Summers are very hot and mostly sunny, and winters are mild and humid. As of 2019 the record high was 46.8°C (116.2°F) in July 2017. 

== Main sights ==

The Castle of St. Peter, also known as Bodrum Castle, is one of the main attractions of the peninsula. The castle was built by the Knights Hospitaller during the 15th century, and the walls of the fortification contain pieces of the ruins of the Mausoleum, which was used as a source of construction materials. The Castle of Bodrum retains its original design and character of the Knights&#x27; period and reflects Gothic architecture. It also contains the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology, a museum established by the Turkish government in 1962 to host the underwater discoveries of ancient shipwrecks in the Aegean Sea. In 2016, the castle was included in the Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey. The castle has been under renovation since 2017, and only some parts of it are accessible to visitors.

Built in the fourth century BC, the ruins of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus are also among the main sights in Bodrum. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was a tomb designed by Greek architects and built for Mausolus, a satrap of the Persian Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria. The structure was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By the 12th century CE, the structure had largely been destroyed. Today, the ruins of the tomb continue to attract both domestic and international tourists. It is planned to turn the ruins into an open-air museum.

Besides the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology, other museums are also located on the peninsula. Zeki Müren Art Museum is dedicated to Turkish classical musician Zeki Müren. After his death, the house in Bodrum where he lived during the later years of his life was transformed into the Zeki Müren Art Museum by order of the Ministry of Culture and was opened to the public on June 8, 2000. Bodrum Maritime Museum is another museum dedicated to the classification, exhibition, restoration, conservation, storage, and safekeeping of historical documents, works, and objects that are important to the city&#x27;s maritime history. Bodrum City Museum is a minor museum in the city center that presents the general history of the Bodrum peninsula.

==Demographics==

==Government==
The district of Bodrum is one of 957 in Turkey. It is in Muğla Province, which is part of the Aydin Subregion, which, in turn, is part of the Aegean Region. Bodrum became a sub-district of the Ottoman Empire in 1871 and a district of Muğla Province in 1872. Bodrum Municipality operates with its 18 directorates and subsidiary units in the entire Bodrum Peninsula, which covers an area of 689 km2 and a coastline of 215 km. The organizational structure of Bodrum Municipality is composed of the mayor, four deputy mayors, and 18 directorates.

Bodrum Municipality served as the sole district municipality in the Bodrum region for many years. With the increase in the population of the peninsula, a town municipality called Karatoprak (Turgutreis) was established in 1967. The increase in the population also led to the establishment of the Mumcular (1972), Yalıkavak (1989), and Gündoğan Municipalities (1992).

Following the new municipality law of 1999, many villages in Bodrum were turned into towns: Ortakent-Yahşi with the integration of Ortakent and Yahşi villages, Göltürkbükü with the integration of Gölköy, and Türkbükü and Yalı with the integration of Yalı and Kızılağaç villages. The same year, the municipalities of Gümüşlük, Konacık, and Bitez were also founded, raising the number of municipalities in the Bodrum Peninsula to 11.

After Muğla Province received metropolitan municipality status, these town municipalities were abolished, and all towns across the province were integrated into the city of Bodrum. Since March 30, 2014, the peninsula has been governed as a sole municipality.

==Economy==

During the 20th century, the city&#x27;s economy was mainly based on fishing and sponge diving. Even though naked sponge diving in the Aegean region can be traced back at least 3,000 years, modern sponge diving became prevalent in Bodrum after Koan and Cretan immigrants settled in the city in the early 1920s, after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey. During its golden age between 1945 and 1965, about 150 boats engaged in sponge diving activities in Bodrum. However, sponge diseases, artificial sponge production, and a ban on sponge diving eventually ended this lucrative industry.
Over the years, tourism became a major activity and income source for local communities. The abundance of visitors has also enlivened Bodrum&#x27;s retail and service industries. Leather goods, particularly for traditional woven sandals, are well-known products. Other traditional goods, such as tangerine-flavored Turkish delight, nazar amulets, and handicrafts are popular souvenirs.

Apart from small shopping facilities, the city hosts a few shopping malls, such as Midtown and Oasis. There are also marinas for yachts and small ships, such as Milta Bodrum Marina, D-Marin Turgutreis, and the award-winning Yalıkavak Marina.

The Carian Trail, which passes by Bodrum and the surrounding Kızılağaç and Pedasa ruins, attracts hikers from both inside and outside Turkey.

== Culture ==
=== Architecture ===
Traditional Bodrum houses are characterized by their prismatic shapes, simple designs and locally sourced building materials like stone, wood, clay and cane. They also tend to have white dominated exterior walls with some blue parts (doors, windows). The tradition of white-washed walls is associated with the bug and scorpion repellent properties of lime, which is found in white paint. It is also traditionally applied in most hot regions for heat-reflecting properties of white color. Blue is also believed by locals to protect against the malicious effects of envy (similar to the Anatolian belief Nazar, originated in Mesopotamia).

According to Muğla Municipality, in order to acquire a building permit one has to agree to paint the walls of the new building white. Use of any paint other than white on the exterior walls of a building was officially banned by Muğla Governor Temel Koçaklar in 2006. This was implemented to protect the historical fabric and cultural identity of the city.

=== Events and festivals ===
Bodrum International Ballet Festival has been held in Bodrum every summer since 2002. Bodrum has also hosted the Bodrum International Biennial since 2014. Bodrum Baroque Music Festival is another, annual, music event held in the city.

==Transportation==
===Airports===
There are no civilian airports located in the district&#x27;s borders and Milas–Bodrum Airport and Kos Island International Airport are the main airports that serve the city. Milas–Bodrum Airport is located northeast of Bodrum, with both domestic and international flights. Kos Island International Airport, to the SW, located in Andimachia, Greece, accessible by boats from Bodrum across a stretch of the Aegean Sea. Aside from year-round flights to Greek destinations, Kos airport&#x27;s traffic is seasonal.

Built in 1987, Bodrum-Imsik Airport once served the city before its closure to commercial flights in the late 1990s. Due to financial and legal problems caused by a landownership dispute, the airport was sold to Presidency of Defense Industries in 1997. It is currently being operated as an air base.

===Bus===
The main bus station of Bodrum district used to be located in the city center, but this has changed in 2021 when it was moved to a newly-built facility in Torba, around 6 km away from the town to ease traffic jams in the city center during the high season. The old bus station still has the interdistrict buses, but intercity bus services to other locations in Turkey were redirected to the new station. The new station is powered by solar power, and contains 6 electric car charging units, which was described to be a first for a bus terminal in Turkey by the Muğla Mayor Osman Gürün.

Most of the public transportation in the city is based on local shared taxis called &quot;dolmuş&quot;. Each of these privately owned minibuses displays their particular route on signboards behind the windscreens. The word derives from the Turkish for &quot;full&quot; or &quot;stuffed&quot;, as these shared taxis depart from the terminal only when a sufficient number of passengers have boarded. Apart from these minibuses Muğla Municipality also has a scheduled bus service program between towns on the Bodrum peninsula. Public transportation between major towns such as Gümbet, Bitez, Turgutreis and the main bus station is non-stop.

===Port===
The port has ferries to other nearby Turkish and Greek ports and islands. Bodrum has three large marinas and cruise berths. The first marina, Milta, is located in the center of Bodrum. The second marina is located in Turgutreis, and the third, Palmarina, in Yalikavak.

Luxury marina Yalikavak Marina near Bodrum was long in the hands of Mübariz Mansimov, a Turkish-Azerbaijani oligarch and shipping magnate until Erdogan handed management over to Mehmet Ağar, his former interior minister. After 2022, the marina became a safe haven for fleeing Russian oligarchs, like Roman Abramovich.

== Wildlife ==
Maquis shrubland biome, which is the typical vegetation of the Mediterranean climate, is widespread in Bodrum, especially near the coast. Forests cover 61.3% of the district. Conifers such as pines, larches, stone pines, cedars and junipers are the dominant trees in the region. Forested areas are prone to wildfires, which are common in the district&#x27;s history. 95% of forest fires in Turkey are believed to be caused by human activities and there are concerns that forests are deliberately being set on fire to enlarge the city. The ruling party AKP has been criticized in the media for giving building permits to construct new hotels on burnt and deforested areas.

Wild boars and foxes are prevalent in the area, as are other animals such as pygmy cormorants, Dalmatian pelicans and lesser kestrels. The region is also home to the endangered and internationally protected Mediterranean monk seal.

<text>In probability theory and statistics, the term Markov property refers to the memoryless property of a stochastic process, which means that its future evolution is independent of its history. It is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov. The term strong Markov property is similar to the Markov property, except that the meaning of &quot;present&quot; is defined in terms of a random variable known as a stopping time.

The term Markov assumption is used to describe a model where the Markov property is assumed to hold, such as a hidden Markov model.

A Markov random field extends this property to two or more dimensions or to random variables defined for an interconnected network of items. An example of a model for such a field is the Ising model.

A discrete-time stochastic process satisfying the Markov property is known as a Markov chain.

==Introduction==

A stochastic process has the Markov property if the conditional probability distribution of future states of the process (conditional on both past and present values) depends only upon the present state; that is, given the present, the future does not depend on the past. A process with this property is said to be Markov or Markovian and known as a Markov process. Two famous classes of Markov process are the Markov chain and Brownian motion.

Note that there is a subtle, often overlooked and very important point that is often missed in the plain English statement of the definition: the statespace of the process is constant through time. The conditional description involves a fixed &quot;bandwidth&quot;. For example, without this restriction we could augment any process to one which includes the complete history from a given initial condition and it would be made to be Markovian. But the state space would be of increasing dimensionality over time and does not meet the definition.

==History==

==Definition==

Let formula_1 be a probability space with a filtration formula_2, for some (totally ordered) index set formula_3; and let formula_4 be a measurable space. A formula_4-valued stochastic process formula_6 adapted to the filtration is said to possess the &quot;Markov property&quot; if, for each formula_7 and each formula_8 with formula_9,

:formula_10

In the case where formula_11 is a discrete set with the discrete sigma algebra and formula_12, this can be reformulated as follows:

:formula_13

==Alternative formulations==

Alternatively, the Markov property can be formulated as follows.

:formula_14

for all formula_15 and formula_16 bounded and measurable.

==Strong Markov property==
Suppose that formula_17 is a stochastic process on a probability space formula_1 with natural filtration formula_19. Then for any stopping time formula_20 on formula_21, we can define

:formula_22.

Then formula_23 is said to have the strong Markov property if, for each stopping time formula_24, conditional on the event formula_25, we have that for each formula_26, formula_27 is independent of formula_28 given formula_29.

The strong Markov property implies the ordinary Markov property since by taking the stopping time formula_30, the ordinary Markov property can be deduced.
==In forecasting==
In the fields of predictive modelling and probabilistic forecasting, the Markov property is considered desirable since it may enable the reasoning and resolution of the problem that otherwise would not be possible to be resolved because of its intractability. Such a model is known as a Markov model.

==Examples==
Assume that an urn contains two red balls and one green ball. One ball was drawn yesterday, one ball was drawn today, and the final ball will be drawn tomorrow. All of the draws are &quot;without replacement&quot;.

Suppose you know that today&#x27;s ball was red, but you have no information about yesterday&#x27;s ball. The chance that tomorrow&#x27;s ball will be red is 1/2. That&#x27;s because the only two remaining outcomes for this random experiment are:

On the other hand, if you know that both today and yesterday&#x27;s balls were red, then you are guaranteed to get a green ball tomorrow.

This discrepancy shows that the probability distribution for tomorrow&#x27;s color depends not only on the present value, but is also affected by information about the past. This stochastic process of observed colors doesn&#x27;t have the Markov property. Using the same experiment above, if sampling &quot;without replacement&quot; is changed to sampling &quot;with replacement,&quot; the process of observed colors will have the Markov property.

An application of the Markov property in a generalized form is in Markov chain Monte Carlo computations in the context of Bayesian statistics.

<doc id="306424" wikidata="Q1969230" url="?curid=306424" title="Tragic hero">
<text>A tragic hero (or sometimes tragic heroine if they are female) is the protagonist of a tragedy. In his &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle records the descriptions of the tragic hero to the playwright and strictly defines the place that the tragic hero must play and the kind of man he must be. Aristotle based his observations on previous dramas. Many of the most famous instances of tragic heroes appear in Greek literature, most notably the works of Sophocles and Euripides.

==Aristotle&#x27;s tragic hero==

In &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle suggests that the hero of a tragedy must evoke a sense of pity and fear within the audience, stating that “the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity.&quot; In essence, the focus of the hero should not be the loss of his goodness. He establishes the concept that pity is an emotion that must be elicited when, through his actions, the character receives undeserved misfortune, while the emotion of fear must be felt by the audience when they contemplate that such misfortune could possibly befall themselves in similar situations. Aristotle explains such change of fortune &quot;should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.” Such misfortune is visited upon the tragic hero &quot;not through vice or depravity but by some error of judgment.&quot; This error, or hamartia, refers to a flaw in the character of the hero, or a mistake made by the character.

Therefore, the Aristotelian hero is characterized as virtuous but not &quot;eminently good,&quot; which suggests a noble or important personage who is upstanding and morally inclined while nonetheless subject to human error. Aristotle&#x27;s tragic heroes are flawed individuals who commit, without evil intent, great wrongs or injuries that ultimately lead to their misfortune, often followed by tragic realization of the true nature of events that led to this destiny. This means the hero still must be – to some degree – morally grounded. The usual irony in Greek tragedy is that the hero is both extraordinarily capable and highly moral (in the Greek honor-culture sense of being duty-bound to moral expectations), and it is these exact, highly-admirable qualities that lead the hero into tragic circumstances. The tragic hero is snared by his own greatness: extraordinary competence, a righteous passion for duty, and (often) the arrogance associated with greatness (hubris).

==In other media==

The influence of the Aristotelian hero extends past classical Greek literary criticism. Greek theater had a direct and profound influence on Roman theater and formed the basis of Western theater, with other tragic heroes including Macbeth in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot;, and Othello in his &quot;Othello&quot;. Kullervo, a tragic hero from the Karelian and Finnish 19th century epic poetry &quot;Kalevala&quot; by Elias Lönnrot, curses beasts from the woods to attack his tormenter, the Maiden of the North. J. R. R. Tolkien wrote an interpretation of the Kullervo cycle in 1914; the piece was finally published in its unfinished form as &quot;The Story of Kullervo&quot;.

Theatre deeply influences a wide variety of arts throughout the world, in diverse media such as literature, music, film, television and even video games. Many iconic characters featured in these genres follow the archetype of the tragic hero. Examples of such characters include Anakin Skywalker from George Lucas&#x27; &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, Jay Gatsby from &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and Eddard Stark from George R. R. Martin&#x27;s novel series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; and the HBO television series adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Some film historians regard Michael Corleone of &quot;The Godfather&quot; as a tragic hero, although using traditional literary conventions, the character would more closely fit the role of anti-hero.

<text>Thomas Johnson (November 4, 1732 – October 26, 1819) was an 18th-century American lawyer, politician, and patriot. He was a delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774, where he signed the Continental Association; commander of the Maryland militia in 1776; and elected first (non-Colonial) governor of Maryland in 1777. Throughout his career, Johnson maintained a personal and political friendship with George Washington, who gave him a recess appointment as an associate justice of the Supreme Court in August 1791. He served only briefly, resigning in January 1793, citing poor health.

== Life before the Revolution ==
Thomas Johnson was born in Calvert County, Maryland, on November 4, 1732, to Thomas Johnson (1702–1777) and his wife Dorcas Sedgwick Johnson (1705–1770). His grandfather, also named Thomas Johnson (1656–1714), was a lawyer in London who had emigrated to Maryland sometime before 1700. The younger Thomas was the fourth of ten children, some of whom later had large families of their own. (Louisa Johnson, daughter of his brother Joshua, married John Quincy Adams.)

Thomas and his siblings were educated at home. As a young man he was attracted to the law, studied it with an established firm, and was admitted to the Maryland bar in 1753. By 1760, he had moved his practice to Frederick County, and in 1761 he was elected to the Maryland provincial assembly for the first time. On February 16, 1766, Johnson married Ann Jennings, the daughter of the judge under whom he apprenticed. They had eight children, including one who died in infancy and a second who died as a young adult.

== Revolutionary years ==
In 1774 and 1775, the Maryland assembly sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress. In the Congress Johnson was allied with those who favored separation from Great Britain. In November 1775, Congress created a Committee of [Secret] Correspondence that was to seek foreign support for the war. Thomas Johnson, along with Benjamin Franklin, and Benjamin Harrison V, were initially named to the committee.

Johnson returned to Maryland and continued his work in the state&#x27;s Assembly when the United States Declaration of Independence was signed. In 1775 he drafted the declaration of rights adopted by the Maryland assembly and later included as the first part of the state&#x27;s first constitution. It was adopted for Maryland by the state&#x27;s constitutional convention at Annapolis in 1776. He also served as a senior brigadier general in the Maryland militia from January 1776 to February 1777, commanding troops sent to aid Washington during his retreat through New Jersey in the winter. Thomas Johnson and his brothers supported the revolution by manufacturing ammunition and possibly cannon. Their former factory, Catoctin Furnace, is now part of a state park near Camp David, just north of Frederick, Maryland. In the winter of 1777, Johnson delivered supplies to the Continental Army encampment at Valley Forge.

Earlier in 1777, the state legislature elected Johnson as the new state&#x27;s first Governor. He served in that capacity until 1779. In the 1780s he held a number of judicial posts in Maryland, as well as serving in the assembly in 1780, 1786, and 1787. He pushed a bill through the Maryland Assembly naming commissioners to meet with Virginia&#x27;s commissioners to &quot;…frame such liberal and equitable regulations concerning [the Potomac] river as may be mutually advantageous to the two states and that they make report thereon to the General assembly.&quot; Although Johnson was not a commissioner, the resulting conference agreed to regulate and settle the jurisdiction and navigation on their mutual border of the Potomac River. Their process served as a predecessor to the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Johnson attended the Maryland Convention in 1788, where he successfully urged the state&#x27;s ratification of the United States Constitution. That year, he lost to John Eager Howard in the Maryland gubernatorial election.

== Federal years ==
In September 1789, President George Washington nominated Johnson to be the first federal judge for the District of Maryland, but he declined the appointment. In 1790 and 1791, Johnson was the senior justice in the Maryland General Court system. In January 1791, President Washington appointed Johnson, with David Stuart and Daniel Carroll, to the commission that would lay out the federal capital in accordance with the Residence Act of 1790. In September 1791 the commissioners named the federal city &quot;The City of Washington&quot; and the federal district &quot;The Territory of Columbia&quot;.

On August 5, 1791, Johnson received a recess appointment from Washington as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, to the seat vacated by John Rutledge, and was sworn into office on September 19, 1791. Formally nominated to the position on October 31, 1791, his appointment was confirmed by the United States Senate on November 7, 1791. Johnson was the author of the Court&#x27;s first written opinion, &quot;Georgia v. Brailsford&quot;, in 1792. He served on the court until resigning on January 16, 1793, citing his poor health.

Johnson suffered very poor health for many years, and cited it in declining Washington&#x27;s 1795 offer to nominate him for Secretary of State, as Thomas Jefferson had recommended. He managed to deliver a eulogy for his friend George Washington at a birthday memorial service on February 22, 1800. On February 28, 1801, President John Adams named Johnson chief judge for the District of Columbia; he was confirmed for the post, but declined the appointment.

== Later years, death and legacy ==

His daughter Ann had married John Colin Grahame in 1788, and in his later years Johnson lived with them in a home they had built in Frederick, Maryland. The home, called Rose Hill Manor, is now a county park and open to the public. Governor Thomas Johnson High School is on half of the Rose Hill property. He died at Rose Hill on October 26, 1819, and was originally buried in All Saints churchyard. His remains were removed and re-interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Frederick.

Johnson was one of the first investors in the Illinois-Wabash Company, which acquired a vast swath of land in Illinois directly from several Indian tribes. Soon after his death in 1819 his son Joshua Johnson and grandson Thomas Graham sued William M&#x27;Intosh in the landmark Supreme Court case &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot;. The case, which remains one of the most important property decisions in American history, determined that only the federal government could acquire Indian land, so Johnson&#x27;s descendants did not have good title to the property.

Other schools named after Thomas Johnson include Governor Thomas Johnson Middle School in Frederick, Maryland, Thomas Johnson Middle School in Lanham, Maryland and Thomas Johnson Elementary School in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1978, the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge was opened to traffic. The bridge crosses the Patuxent River and connects Calvert with St. Mary&#x27;s Counties. As Johnson was a slave owner, the naming of schools for him has become controversial.

<text>Nestor Ivanovych Makhno (, ; 7 November 1888 – 25 July 1934), also known as Bat&#x27;ko Makhno (батько Махно, ), was a Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary and the commander of the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine during the Ukrainian War of Independence. He established the Makhnovshchina (loosely translated as &quot;Makhno movement&quot;), a mass movement by the Ukrainian peasantry to establish anarchist communism in the country between 1918 and 1921. Initially centered around Makhno&#x27;s home province of Katerynoslav and hometown of Huliaipole, it came to exert a strong influence over large areas of southern Ukraine, specifically in what is now the Zaporizhzhia Oblast of Ukraine.

Raised by a peasant family and coming of age amid the fervor around the 1905 Revolution, Makhno participated in a local anarchist group and spent seven years imprisoned for his involvement. With his release during the 1917 Revolution, Makhno became a local revolutionary leader in his hometown and oversaw the expropriation and redistribution of large estates to the peasantry. In the Ukrainian Civil War, Makhno sided with the Soviet Russian Bolsheviks against the Ukrainian nationalists and White movement, but his alliances with the Bolsheviks did not last. He rallied Bolshevik support to lead an insurgency, defeating the Central Powers&#x27; occupation forces at the Battle of Dibrivka and establishing the Makhnovshchina. Makhno&#x27;s troops briefly integrated with the Bolshevik Red Army in the 1919 Soviet invasion of Ukraine, but split over differences on the movement&#x27;s autonomy. Makhno rebuilt his army from the remains of Nykyfor Hryhoriv&#x27;s forces in western Ukraine, routed the White Army at the Battle of Perehonivka, and captured most of southern and eastern Ukraine, where they again attempted to establish anarchist communism.

Makhno&#x27;s army fought the Bolshevik re-invasion of Ukraine in 1920 until a White Army offensive forced a short-lived Bolshevik–Makhnovist alliance that drove the Whites out of Crimea and ended the Southern Front of the Russian Civil War. The Bolsheviks immediately turned on Makhno, wounding him and driving him westward in August 1921 to Romanian concentration camps, Poland, and Europe, before he settled in Paris with his wife and daughter. Makhno wrote memoirs and articles for radical newspapers, playing a role in the development of platformism. He became alienated from the French anarchist movement after disputes over synthesis anarchism and personal allegations of antisemitism. His family continued to be persecuted in the decades following his death of tuberculosis at the age of 45. Anarchist groups continue to draw on his name for inspiration.

==Early life==
Nestor Makhno was born on , into a poor peasant family in Huliaipole, a town in the Katerynoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine). He was the youngest of five children born to Ivan and Evdokia Mikhnenko, former serfs who had been emancipated in 1861. After Nestor&#x27;s birth, his father went to work as a coachman for a wealthy industrialist when the Makhnos&#x27; small plot of land could not feed the family. His father died when Nestor was only ten months old, leaving behind his impoverished family.

Makhno was briefly fostered by a more well-off peasant couple, but he was unhappy with them and returned to his family of birth. At only seven years old, he was put to work tending livestock. Makhno started to attend a local secular school when he turned eight years old. He was a good student at first but grew to skip school to play games and ice skate. He worked at a local estate in the summer after his first school year. His brothers also worked as farmhands to support the family.

Makhno attended one more year of school before his family&#x27;s extreme poverty forced the ten-year-old to work the fields full-time, which led Makhno to develop a &quot;sort of rage, resentment, even hatred for the wealthy property-owner&quot;. His aversion to the landlords grew, nurtured by his mother&#x27;s stories of her time in serfdom. In 1902, he observed a farm manager and the landlord&#x27;s sons physically beating a young farmhand. He quickly alerted an older stable hand Bat&#x27;ko Ivan, who attacked the assailants and led a spontaneous workers&#x27; revolt against the landlord. After the affair was settled, Ivan left Makhno with words that would inspire a rebellious spirit within him: &quot;if one of your masters should ever strike you, pick up the first pitchfork you lay hands on and let him have it...&quot; The following year, Makhno quit working in the fields and found a job in a foundry. By this time, most of his older brothers had left home and started their own families. Makhno rapidly moved between jobs, focusing most of his work on his mother&#x27;s land, while occasionally returning to employment to help provide for his brothers.

== Revolutionary activity ==
When the 1905 revolution broke out, the sixteen-year-old Makhno quickly joined the revolutionary movement. He distributed propaganda for the Social Democratic Labor Party before affiliating with his home town&#x27;s local anarchist communist group, the Union of Poor Peasants. Despite increased political repression against revolutionaries, the Union continued to meet weekly and inspired Makhno to devote himself to the revolution. Makhno was initially distrusted by other members of the group due to his apparent penchant for drinking and getting into fights. After six months in the Union of Poor Peasants, Makhno had thoroughly educated himself on the principles of libertarian communism and became a formal member.

A series of agrarian reforms disempowered the traditional peasant communes by creating a wealthier land-owning class and growing private estates. In response, the Union of Poor Peasants initiated a campaign of &quot;Black Terror&quot; against the large landowners and the local Tsarist police. The group carried out a series of expropriations against local businessmen, using the money they stole to print propaganda that attacked the recent reforms. Suspected of being involved in these attacks, with Nazarii Zuichenko naming him as a participant in an attack on a post office cart, Makhno was arrested in September 1907 but was eventually released without charges due to a lack of evidence. As the rest of the group&#x27;s members had been declared outlaws by the Tsarist authorities, Makhno founded another anarchist study group in a neighboring village, where two dozen members gathered on a weekly basis to discuss anarchist theory. But after the assassination of a police informant by the Union of Poor Peasants, the police launched a crackdown against the group and arrested many of its members, including Makhno in August 1909.

===Imprisonment===

On 26 March 1910, a Katerynoslav district court-martial sentenced Makhno to be hanged. Although he had refused to appeal, Makhno&#x27;s sentence was commuted to a life sentence of hard labor, due to his young age. While in prison, Makhno contracted a near-fatal bout of typhoid fever but eventually recovered. He was moved several times: to the Luhansk prison, where family briefly visited him, to the Katerynoslav prison, and in August 1911, to Butyrka prison in Moscow, where over 3,000 political prisoners were being held. Through the other prisoners he learned Russian history and political theory, taking a particular interest in &quot;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution&quot; (1902) by the Russian anarchist communist theorist Peter Kropotkin. Makhno&#x27;s frequent boasting in prison earned him the nickname &quot;Modest&quot;. He sometimes even antagonized the guards, which landed him in solitary confinement. Due to prison conditions, Makhno quickly fell sick again and was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He spent many periods in the prison hospital throughout his sentence.

In Butyrka prison, Makhno met the anarchist communist politician Peter Arshinov, who took the young anarchist on as a student. Makhno also became disillusioned with intellectualism during this time after seeing the prejudice with which guards treated prisoners of different social classes. As the years passed, Makhno began to write his own works and to distribute them among his fellow prisoners, starting off with a poem titled &quot;Summons&quot; that called for a libertarian communist revolution. Prison did not break his desire for revolution, as Makhno swore that he would &quot;contribute to the free re-birth of his country&quot;. Although exposed to the ideas of Ukrainian nationalism in prison, Makhno nevertheless remained hostile to all forms of nationalism, adopting an internationalist position during World War I and even circulating an anti-war petition around the prison. When political prisoners were released during the February Revolution of 1917, Makhno&#x27;s shackles were removed for the first time in eight years. He found himself physically off-balance without the chains weighing him down and in need of sunglasses after years in dark prison cells. He remained in Moscow for three weeks, briefly joining an anarchist group in Moscow&#x27;s Lefortovo District until late March, when his mother and his old anarchist communist comrades convinced him to return to Huliaipole.

===Agrarian activism===
In March 1917, the 28-year-old Makhno returned to Huliaipole, where he was reunited with his mother and elder brothers. At the station, he was greeted by many of the town&#x27;s peasants, who were curious to see the return of the famous political exile, as well as surviving members from the now-defunct Union of Poor Peasants. Clashing with many of the group&#x27;s former members, who wanted to focus on propaganda, Makhno proposed that anarchists take clear leadership of the masses to ignite peasant mass action. The Huliaipole anarchists did not agree. He instead led the establishment of a local Peasants&#x27; Union on 29 March and was elected as its chairman. The union quickly came to represent the majority of Huliaipole&#x27;s peasantry and even those from the surrounding region. Carpenters and metalworkers also formed their own industrial unions and elected Makhno as their chairman. By April, Huliaipole&#x27;s Public Committee, the local organ of the Provisional Government, had been brought under the control of the town&#x27;s peasantry and anarchist communist activists. Makhno met Nastia Vasetskaia, who would become his first wife, during this period but his activism left little time for his marriage.

Makhno quickly became a leading figure in Huliaipole&#x27;s revolutionary movement, sidelining any political parties that sought to control the workers&#x27; organizations. He justified his leadership as only a temporary responsibility. As a union leader, Makhno led workers in strike actions against their employers, demanding doubled wages and vowing continued work stoppages if refused. This resulted in full workers&#x27; control over all Huliaipole industry. As Huliaipole&#x27;s delegate to the regional peasant congress in Oleksandrivsk, he called for the expropriation of large estates from landowners and their transfer to communal ownership by the peasants that worked them. He quickly became disillusioned with the long debates and party politics that dominated the congress, considering Huliaipole to have &quot;advanced beyond what the congresses were merely talking about, without the constant wrangling and jockeying for position.&quot; Makhno and his supporters subsequently disarmed and minimized the powers of local law enforcement, before seizing property from local landlords and equally redistributing the lands to the peasantry, in open defiance of the Russian Provisional Government and its officials in Oleksandrivsk. Local peasants compared him to the Cossack rebel leaders Stenka Razin and Yemelyan Pugachev. Huliaipole rallied around the slogan, &quot;Land and Liberty&quot;.

Despite Makhno&#x27;s success at home, the wider anarchist movement&#x27;s general disorganization disappointed him. Despite its growing size, the anarchist movement found itself unable to compete with the established political parties, as it had yet to establish a coordinated organization capable of playing a leading role in the revolutionary movement. Makhno criticized the movement for largely dedicating itself to propaganda activities. Following news of Lavr Kornilov&#x27;s attempted coup against the Provisional Government, Makhno led the establishment of a &quot;Committee for the Defense of the Revolution&quot;, which organized armed peasant detachments against the Huliaipole landlords, bourgeoisie, and &quot;kulaks&quot;. He called for disarming the local bourgeoisie, expropriating their property, and bringing all private enterprise under workers&#x27; control. Peasants withheld rent and took control of the lands they worked; large estates were collectivized and transformed into agrarian communes. Makhno personally organized communes on former Mennonite estates. He and Nastia lived together on a commune and Makhno himself worked two days per week, helping with the farming and occasionally fixing machines.

Following the 1917 October Revolution, Makhno witnessed the rising hostilities between the Ukrainian nationalists and the Bolsheviks. With the outbreak of the Soviet–Ukrainian War, Makhno advised anarchists to take up arms alongside the Red Guards against the forces of the Ukrainian nationalists and the White movement. Makhno dispatched his brother Savelii to Oleksandrivsk at the head of an armed anarchist detachment to assist the Bolsheviks in retaking the city from the Nationalists. The city was taken and Makhno was chosen as the anarchists&#x27; representative to the Oleksandrivsk Revolutionary Committee. He was also elected chairman of a commission, which reviewed the cases of accused counter-revolutionary military prisoners, and oversaw the release of still imprisoned workers and peasants. During this period Makhno participated in Oleksandrivsk&#x27;s successful defence against an assault by Don and Kuban Cossacks. Makhno thereafter returned to Huliaipole, where he organized the town bank&#x27;s expropriation to fund the local anarchist movement&#x27;s revolutionary activities.

===Journey to Moscow===

In February 1918, representatives from the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (UPR) signed a peace treaty with the Central Powers, inviting the forces of the German Empire and Austria-Hungary to invade and occupy Ukraine. In response, Makhno formed a volunteer detachment to resist the occupation. They joined the Bolshevik Red Guards in Oleksandrivsk. Makhno was personally summoned to the train of Bolshevik Commander Alexander Yegorov but failed to link up with Yegorov who was in fast retreat. In Makhno&#x27;s absence, Ukrainian nationalists seized control of Huliaipole and invited Austro-Hungarian Army forces to occupy the town in April 1918. Unable to return home, Makhno retreated to Taganrog, where he held a conference of Huliaipole&#x27;s exiled anarchists. Makhno left to rally Russian support for the Ukrainian anarchist cause with plans to retake Huliaipole in July 1918. In early May, Makhno visited Rostov-on-Don, Tikhoretsk, and Tsaritsyn, where he was briefly reunited with Nastia and some of his Huliaipole comrades.

On his travels, Makhno witnessed the newly established Bolshevik secret police – the Cheka – confront, disarm, and kill revolutionary partisans who disobeyed their decrees, causing Makhno to question whether &quot;institutional revolutionaries&quot; would extinguish the revolution. In Astrakhan, Makhno found himself working for the local soviet&#x27;s propaganda department and giving speeches to Red soldiers bound for the front. While traveling by rail to Moscow near the end of May, Makhno used the armored train&#x27;s artillery to impede the Don Cossacks in pursuit of Makhno and the Red Guards in his company.

After passing through the Volga region, Makhno finally arrived in Moscow. He pejoratively dubbed the city &quot;the capital of the paper revolution&quot; after its local anarchist intellectuals, whom Makhno considered more inclined to slogans and manifestos than action. Here he reunited with Peter Arshinov and others in the Muscovite anarchist movement, many of whom were under surveillance by the Bolshevik authorities. He also met the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who at this time were beginning to turn against the Bolsheviks. Makhno discussed the situation in Ukraine with Peter Kropotkin.

Satisfied with his time in Moscow, Makhno applied to the Kremlin for forged identity papers so that he could cross the Ukrainian border. Yakov Sverdlov immediately arranged for Makhno to meet Vladimir Lenin, who believed that anarchism had &quot;contaminated&quot; the peasantry and questioned Makhno extensively. Makhno staunchly defended the Ukrainian anarchist movement from charges of &quot;counter-revolution&quot;, criticizing the Red Guards for sticking to the railways while peasant partisans fought on the front lines. Lenin expressed his admiration for Makhno and admitted he had made mistakes in his analysis of the revolutionary conditions in Ukraine, where anarchists had already become the predominant revolutionary force. Lenin passed Makhno to Volodymyr Zatonsky, who fulfilled his request for a false passport. Makhno finally departed for the border in late June 1918, content that he had taken &quot;the temperature of the revolution&quot;.

==Leader of the Makhnovist movement==

===Return to Ukraine===
During Makhno&#x27;s absence from Ukraine, the Austro-German occupation forces orchestrated a coup in late April 1918 against their former allies within the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, removing the UPR&#x27;s Central Council and installing Pavlo Skoropadskyi as Hetman of a new conservative client state.

Carrying a fake passport and disguised as a Ukrainian officer, Makhno crossed the Ukrainian border in July 1918. He learned that the forces occupying Huliaipole had shot, tortured, and arrested many of the town&#x27;s revolutionaries. His brother Savelii had been arrested, and his brother Omelian, a disabled war veteran, executed. Their mother&#x27;s house was also destroyed by the occupation forces. Makhno himself was forced to take precautions to evade capture. To avoid recognition while aboard the crowded train carriages, he changed at Kharkiv and Synelnykove, and ultimately decided to walk the final 27 kilometers to after his train was searched by police. Through correspondence, Makhno&#x27;s comrades in Huliaipole discouraged him from returning, fearing he would be caught by the authorities.

After weeks in hiding, Makhno clandestinely returned to Huliaipole. In secret meetings, he began to lay plans for an insurrection and started to organize peasant partisans. He advocated coordinated attacks on the estates of large landowners, advised against individual acts of terrorism, and forbade anti-semitic pogroms. From the outset, Makhno emphasized tactical and theoretical unity, patiently awaiting favorable conditions for a general insurrection.

The authorities discovered Makhno&#x27;s presence and placed a bounty on his head, forcing him to retreat from Huliaipole. In Ternivka, Makhno revealed himself to the local population and established a peasant detachment to lead attacks against the occupation and Hetmanate government. In coordination with partisans in Rozhdestvenka, Makhno resolved to reoccupy and establish Huliaipole as the insurgency&#x27;s permanent headquarters. He raided Austrian positions, seizing weapons and money, which led to the insurrection&#x27;s intensification in the region. While disguised as a woman, Makhno even briefly returned to Huliaipole, where he planned to blow up the local command center of the occupation forces. According to Makhno&#x27;s account, he called off the attack to avoid civilian casualties.

===Insurgent actions===

In September 1918, Makhno briefly reoccupied Huliaipole. The German occupation forces had spread misinformation about him there, claiming he had robbed the local peasantry and ran away with the money to buy a &quot;dacha&quot; in Moscow. After defeating Austrian units in the nearby village of Marfopil, Makhno produced a letter that was translated into the German language, encouraging the conscripted occupation troops to mutiny, return home and launch revolutions of their own. While his comrades scattered themselves throughout the region to rouse the peasants to revolt, Makhno prepared proclamations to announce the region was under insurgent control. When the occupation forces counterattacked, Makhno was forced to evacuate Huliaipole.

Makhno&#x27;s detachment withdrew north, where it sought refuge in the Dibrivka forest, neighboring the village of Velykomykhailivka. There they joined forces with another small insurgent detachment led by Fedir Shchus. When Austrian units surrounded the insurgents in their forest encampment, to break the encirclement, Makhno launched a surprise counterattack against the troops in the village. Led by Makhno and Shchus, the insurgents&#x27; gamble succeeded in forcing the Austrians into retreat. For his role in their victory, the insurgents bestowed Makhno with the title &quot;Bat&#x27;ko&quot; (), which remained his moniker throughout the war.

Makhno&#x27;s victory in the battle of Dibrivka provoked a retaliation from the occupation forces. Austrian troops attacked Velykomykhailovka, reinforced by National Guard and German colonist units. The village was set on fire, killing many inhabitants and destroying some 600 houses. Makhno, in turn, led a campaign of retributive attacks against the occupation forces and their collaborators, including much of the region&#x27;s Mennonite population. Makhno also focused much of his energies on agitating among the peasantry, gathering much support in the region through impassioned impromptu village speeches against his enemies.

By November 1918, the insurgents definitively recaptured Huliaipole. At a regional insurgent conference, Makhno proposed that they open up a war on four simultaneous fronts against the Hetmanate, Central Powers, Don Cossacks, and nascent White movement. He argued that to prosecute such a conflict, it would be necessary to organize a Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine according to a federal model, directly answerable to him as commander-in-chief.

===Integration into the Red Army===

The Central Powers&#x27; defeat in World War I saw their withdrawal from Ukraine, resulting in the overthrow of the Hetmanate government by the Directorate, which established a new nationalist government in Kyiv under the leadership of Symon Petliura. At the same time, the Bolsheviks invaded Ukraine from the north, while the Makhnovshchina faced pressure from a growing White Army in the south. Caught between these forces, Makhno proposed an alliance with the Red Army.

During a joint Insurgent-Bolshevik attack against the nationalist-held city of Katerynoslav, Makhno was appointed as commander-in-chief of the combined Soviet forces in the province. After capturing the city, Makhno oversaw the establishment of a revolutionary committee equally representing Bolsheviks, Socialist Revolutionaries (SRs), and anarchists. When a nationalist counteroffensive forced Makhno to retreat to Huliaipole, he undertook a complete reorganization of insurgent forces on every front, culminating in the January 1919 integration of Makhnovist units into the Ukrainian Soviet Army. In this 3rd Trans-Dnieper Brigade, Makhno was subordinate to Pavel Dybenko&#x27;s command. The next month, Makhno extricated himself from the front to attend the movement&#x27;s second regional congress in Huliaipole. He was elected honorary chairman, but rejected official chairmanship as the front required his attention. At the congress, he declared his support for &quot;non-party soviets&quot; in open defiance of his Bolshevik commanders.

Makhno justified the integration of the insurgent forces into the Red Army as a matter of placing the &quot;revolution&#x27;s interests above ideological differences&quot;. He was, nevertheless, open about his contempt for the new order of political commissars. Bolshevik interference in front-line operations even led to Makhno arresting a Cheka detachment, which had directly obstructed his command. Despite his hostility towards the Bolsheviks, Makhno authorized Bolshevik newspapers to be distributed in Huliaipole, Berdiansk, and Mariupol, even as their pages denounced the Makhnovists.

By April 1919, the newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; was publishing glowing reports of Makhno&#x27;s activities, praising his opposition to Ukrainian nationalism, his successful assault against Katerynoslav, and his continued successes against the White movement. These reports also detailed Makhno&#x27;s widespread support among the Ukrainian peasantry. This did not stop Dybenko from declaring the insurgents&#x27; subsequent regional congresses to be &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;, outlawing their participants, and ordering Makhno to prevent future congresses. The Makhnovist Military Revolutionary Council issued an excoriating reply to Dybenko rejecting his demands.

To resolve the dispute, Makhno invited Ukrainian Soviet Army Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko to visit Huliaipole, which impressed him and allayed his doubts about Makhno&#x27;s command. Upon his return, Antonov-Ovseenko openly praised Makhno and the insurgents, criticizing the Bolshevik press for publishing misinformation about Makhno and requesting the Makhnovists be supplied with the necessary equipment. His reports quickly attracted Politburo member Lev Kamenev to himself visit Huliaipole the very next week. Kamenev too was greeted by Makhno and his new wife Halyna Kuzmenko, who gave the Bolshevik functionary a tour of the town, making sure to show off a tree where Makhno had personally lynched a White army officer. Despite disagreements between the two over the autonomy of the insurgent movement, Kamenev bade farewell to Makhno with an embrace and warm words. Kamenev immediately published an open letter to Makhno, praising him as an &quot;honest and courageous fighter&quot; in the war against the White movement.

===Dealings with Hryhoriv===
In May 1919, the powerful otaman Nykyfor Hryhoriv led an uprising against the Bolsheviks, seizing part of Kherson province. Kamenev of the Politburo telegrammed Makhno to condemn Hryhoriv or else face a declaration of war. (Hryhoriv had previously attempted to ally with Makhno against the Bolsheviks, unsuccessfully.) In reply to Kamenev, Makhno reaffirmed his commitment to fight the White movement, worried that open conflict with Hryhoriv would endanger that commitment, declared his loyalty to the revolution, but also stated that he would continue to oppose the Cheka and any other &quot;organs of oppression and violence&quot;. In an insurgent military congress in May, Makhno expanded on this anti-authoritarian position with a denunciation of the Bolsheviks, their implementation of bureaucratic collectivism, and their political repression, which he compared to the Tsarist autocracy. After Makhnovist emissaries uncovered evidence of Hryhoriv&#x27;s participation in pogroms, Makhno openly denounced him for his displays of antisemitism and Ukrainian nationalism, going on to blame the Bolsheviks for the rise of Hryhoriv, claiming it was their political repression that had caused the uprising.

As the Donbas front collapsed, the Red Army high command began to blame Makhno for their defeat and attempted to rein in his influence over his detachment. Makhno&#x27;s Red Army superior Commander even declared that &quot;he is to be liquidated&quot;. By the end of May 1919, the Bolshevik Revolutionary Military Council pronounced Makhno to be an outlaw, issuing a warrant for his arrest and for him to be tried before a revolutionary tribunal. On 2 June, Leon Trotsky published a diatribe attacking Makhno for his anarchist ideology and labeling him a &quot;kulak&quot;.

A few days later, while preoccupied at the front, Makhno learned that the Kuban Cossacks had captured Huliaipole. This forced him to retreat from his positions. In an attempt to appease Trotsky, Makhno resigned his command of the insurgent army so that the insurgents would not be caught in a pincer between the Red and White armies. Despite a rebuff from Trotsky, he again attempted to offer the Bolsheviks his resignation on 9 June, reaffirming his commitment to the Revolution and his belief in the &quot;inalienable right of workers and peasants&quot;. Makhno relinquished command of the 7th Ukrainian Soviet Division and declared his intention to wage a guerrilla war against the Whites from the rear. Trotsky then ordered Kliment Voroshilov to arrest Makhno, but sympathetic officers reported the order to him, preventing his capture by the Cheka. Despite having broken with the Red Army, Makhno still considered the White movement to be the Makhnovists&#x27; &quot;main enemy&quot; and insisted that they could settle their scores with Bolsheviks after the Whites were defeated.

Makhno&#x27;s small &quot;sotnia&quot; then linked up with other insurgent detachments that had mutinied against the Red Army. In early July 1919, Makhno fell back into Kherson province, where he met with Hryhoriv&#x27;s green army. Initially Makhno sought to form a strategic alliance with the latter due to Hryhoriv&#x27;s popularity among the local peasantry. But revelations of Hryhoriv&#x27;s antisemitism, extensive pogroms, and connections with the White movement led the Makhnovists to openly denounce the otaman at a public meeting. When Hryhoriv reached for his revolver, he was gunned down by Oleksiy Chubenko.

In the assassination&#x27;s aftermath, Makhno quickly rebuilt his army. A portion of Hryhoriv&#x27;s army was integrated into the Makhnovist forces, which numbered as high as 20,000 insurgents at this time. By August, Makhno was also attracting many Red Army deserters who joined him as the Bolsheviks once again retreated from Ukrainian territory in the face of Anton Denikin&#x27;s White Army. Red Army mutinies became so bad that the Ukrainian Bolshevik leader even telephoned Makhno, begging him to subordinate himself again to Bolshevik command, which Makhno refused.

===Against the White Army===
By September 1919, the Bolsheviks had largely retreated from Ukraine, leaving the Makhnovists to face the White Army alone. Reports by the White commander Yakov Slashchov depicted Makhno as a formidable adversary with tactical ability and disciplinary command over his troops. The insurgents launched several effective attacks behind White lines, Makhno himself commanding a cavalry assault against Mykolaivka that resulted in the capture of sorely needed munitions. His brother Hryhorii died during one of these attacks.

The White offensive eventually pushed the insurgents back as far as Uman, the last stronghold of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. There Makhno negotiated a temporary truce with Petliura, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Army (UPA), to allow wounded insurgents to recuperate on neutral ground before launching a counteroffensive. During the Battle of Perehonivka, the tide of the battle turned in the insurgents&#x27; favor when Makhno led his &quot;sotnia&quot; in a flank against the White positions, charging the much larger enemy force and engaging in close-quarters combat that forced the Whites to retreat. Makhno led the pursuit of the retreating Whites, decisively routing the enemy forces.
The Makhnovists split up to capitalize on their victory and capture as much territory as possible. Makhno himself led his &quot;sotnia&quot; in the capture of Katerynoslav from the Whites on 20 October. With southern Ukraine brought almost entirely under insurgent control, the White supply lines were broken and the advance on Moscow was halted. The insurgent advance also attacked the region&#x27;s Mennonites, including the Eichenfeld massacre. Mennonite historiography has held Makhno himself directly responsible for the massacres, as commander-in-chief of the perpetrating forces, and Makhnovist historiography has attributed the violence to class conflict, the result of deep-seated resentments between the native Ukrainians and Mennonite colonists.

Bolsheviks in Katerynoslav attempted to establish a revolutionary committee to control the city, proposing to Makhno that he confine himself exclusively to military activity. But Makhno no longer held any sympathy for the Bolsheviks, who he described as &quot;parasites upon the workers&#x27; lives&quot;. He quickly ordered the revolutionary committee be shut down and forbade their activities under penalty of death, telling the Bolshevik officials to &quot;take up a more honest trade&quot;. At a regional congress in Oleksandrivsk, Makhno presented the &quot;Draft Declaration of the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine&quot;, which called for the establishment of &quot;free soviets&quot; outside of political party control. Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionary Party delegates objected, believing instead in the legitimacy of the dissolved Constituent Assembly. Makhno denounced them as &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;, causing them to walk out in protest.

When he returned to Katerynoslav in November 1919, the local railway workers looked to Makhno to pay their wages, which they had gone without for two months. He responded by proposing the workers self-manage the railways and levy payment for their services directly from the customers. By December, Makhnovist control of Katerynoslav began to slip under increasing attacks from the White Cossacks. On 5 December, Makhno survived an assassination attempt by the Bolsheviks, who had planned to poison him and seize control of the city. After the plot was uncovered, the conspirators were shot.

===Alliance with the Bolsheviks===
Renewed White attacks forced the Makhnovists to abandon Katerynoslav and retreat towards Oleksandrivsk and Nikopol. During this period, many of the insurgents were beset by epidemic typhus. Makhno himself contracted the disease. In January 1920, the Red Army returned to Ukraine, filling a power vacuum that had been left in the wake of the White retreat. Makhnovist and Red forces greeted each other in Oleksandrivsk, but negotiations between the two sides collapsed when the Red command ordered Makhno to the Polish front. Makhno refused and the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee declared him to be an outlaw.

In response, the Makhnovists fled to Huliaipole, initiating a nine-month period of hostilities with the Bolsheviks. At this time, Makhno&#x27;s typhus worsened, and he slipped into prolonged coma, during which local peasants provided him refuge and hid him from the Cheka. Once Makhno recovered, he immediately began to lead a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the Cheka and requisitioning units. Makhno also implemented a discriminatory policy for dealing with captured Red Army units: commanding officers and political commissars would be immediately shot, and the rank-and-file soldiers would be given the choice to either join the insurgent army or be stripped of their uniforms and sent home. With increased Makhnovist attacks Bolshevik positions and Red Army defections to the insurgents, the two factions considered alliance proposals.
Though initially sceptical of a proposed Bolshevik alliance in June, Makhno grew amenable and left the decision to his army, which narrowly voted in favor in August. Their Starobilsk agreement extended freedoms to Ukrainian anarchists while again integrating the insurgents into the Red Army command structure. Despite these outcomes, Makhno reaffirmed his distrust for his &quot;irreconcilable enemies&quot; in the Bolshevik Party, stating that the necessity of a military alliance with them should not be confused with a recognition of their political authority. Makhno still hoped that victory over the Whites would oblige the Bolsheviks to honor his desire for soviet democracy and civil liberties in Ukraine. He would later consider this to be a &quot;grave error&quot; on his part.

Under the terms of the pact, Makhno was able to seek treatment from the medical corps of the Red Army, physicians and surgeons seeing to a wound in his ankle, where he had been hit by an expanding bullet. He was also visited by the Hungarian communist leader Béla Kun, who gave him gifts, including over 100 photographs and postcards depicting the Executive Committee of the Communist International. In October, the insurgents successfully reoccupied Huliaipole, driving the Whites out of the city for the last time.

Back in his hometown, Makhno&#x27;s request for three days of rest and recuperation was rejected by the Bolshevik command, which ordered the insurgents to continue their offensive, under penalty of nullifying their alliance. The still-wounded Makhno stayed behind in Huliaipole anyway, along with his black guard, while dispatching Semen Karetnyk to lead the Makhnovist offensive against the Army of Wrangel. Makhno once again turned his attention towards reconstructing his vision of anarchist communism, overseeing the reestablishment of the local soviet and other anarchist projects.

===Anti-Bolshevik rebellion===
After the combined Bolshevik-Makhnovist forces defeated Pyotr Wrangel in Crimea and ended the Russian Civil War&#x27;s Southern Front, the Bolsheviks once again turned on their anarchist allies. In late November 1920, the Red Army launched a surprise attack against the insurgent forces, putting the Makhnovist capital of Huliaipole under siege. Caught unprepared, Makhno rallied together 150 Black Guards to defend the town. After spotting a gap in the Red lines, he escaped with his detachment and led a counterattack that pushed the Red forces back to Novouspenivka. His own forces regrouped and gained some defecting Red soldiers before recapturing Huliaipole a week later. The Red Army command justified the attacks against the Makhnovists on grounds that Makhno had refused orders and intended to betray them, though the Red Army had planned to break the alliance with the Makhnovists even before the beginning of the offensive against Wrangel&#x27;s White Army.

The following week in Kermenchyk, Makhno was finally reunited with Karetnyk&#x27;s detachment, which had been reduced to a fifth of its original size after its commander was assassinated by the Bolsheviks in Crimea. Lenin gave direct orders for the Red Army to &quot;liquidate Makhno&quot;, the insurgents leading a guerrilla campaign in the face of their encirclement. On 3 December, Makhno led a detachment of 4,000 insurgents in an assault routing a Red Kirghiz brigade at Komar. In the following weeks, he recaptured Berdiansk and Andriivka from the Bolsheviks, defeating several Red divisions before a stalemate with the remaining divisions at Fedorivka.

Makhno had hoped that simply defeating a few Red divisions would halt the offensive but found himself having to change tactics in the face of his encirclement by overwhelming numbers. He consequently split up his contingent into smaller detachments and sent them in different directions, to carry out their guerrilla sabotage efforts more effectively. Taking his own 2,000-strong detachment north on horseback at a pace of 80 kilometers each day, he derailed a Bolshevik armored train at Oleksandrivsk, before pushing deep into the provinces of Kherson and Kyiv, all the while pursued by Red divisions.
Surrounded and under constant pursuit by the Red Cossacks, Makhno&#x27;s detachment could only advance slowly under heavy machine gun fire and artillery bombardment. Makhno led his detachment to the Galician border before suddenly swinging around and heading back across the Dnieper. Heading north from Poltava to Belgorod, they finally managed to shake off the pursuing Cossacks at the end of January 1921. By this point he had travelled more than 1,500 kilometers, lost most of his equipment and half of his detachment, but he also found himself in a position to once again lead an offensive against the Red Army. Following the outbreak of the Kronstadt rebellion, Makhno dispatched detachments to various regions of Southern and Central Russia to foment insurrection, while he himself stuck to the banks of the Dnieper River. At this time, Makhno was wounded in the foot and had to be carried by a &quot;tachanka&quot;, but still managed to personally lead the detachment from the front. After crossing back over to left-bank Ukraine, he split his detachment again, sending one to stir up revolt against the Cheka near the Sea of Azov while Makhno&#x27;s own contingent of 1,500 cavalry and two infantry regiments continued along its path, seizing the equipment of the Red units it routed. During one engagement, Makhno was wounded in the stomach and fell unconscious, having to be evacuated on a &quot;tachanka&quot;. Upon his resuscitation, he again divided his forces and sent them out in all directions, leaving himself behind with only his black &quot;sotnia&quot; remaining.

Makhno was unable to withdraw from the front and tend to his injuries, as his &quot;sotnia&quot; repeatedly came under attack by the Red Army. During one engagement, several Makhnovists sacrificed themselves to ensure Makhno&#x27;s escape. Towards the end of May 1921, Makhno attempted to organize a large-scale offensive to take the Ukrainian Bolshevik capital of Kharkiv, pulling together thousands of partisans before he was forced to call it off due to substantial Red defenses. The Red Army command resolved to focus its efforts on Makhno&#x27;s small 200-strong &quot;sotnia&quot;, deploying a motorized detachment to pursue them. Upon its arrival, Makhno led the ambush of one armored car, taking it for himself and driving it until it ran out of fuel. The subsequent pursuit of Makhno lasted five days and covered 520 kilometers, causing his &quot;sotnia&quot; heavy losses and almost running them out of ammunition, before they were finally able to shake the armored detachment off their trail.

== Exile ==
===Eastern Europe===
Red Army commander Mikhail Frunze demanded the &quot;definitive liquidation&quot; of the Makhnovist movement in July 1921. Makhno continued to execute raids in the Don river basin despite having suffered several wounds. By August, the severity of his wounds convinced him to seek treatment abroad. Leaving Viktor Bilash in command of the Insurgent Army, Makhno, his wife Halyna, and around 100 loyalists set out for the Polish border. The Red Army followed them with sustained attacks; Makhno took a bullet in the neck and several of his old friends died in battle in late August. When a scout was captured by the Reds, Makhno diverted his forces south towards Romania. After crossing the Dniester, Romanian border guards disarmed and interned Makhno&#x27;s group. Makhno and his wife were eventually released from the Brașov internment camp and granted permission to stay in Bucharest under police surveillance while Makhno recovered from his wounds.

Bolshevik politicians Georgy Chicherin and Christian Rakovsky demanded Makhno&#x27;s extradition, which the Romanian government of Take Ionescu refused. The two states had no extradition treaty and Romania had abolished capital punishment, so the Romanian government requested a formal assurance that the Ukrainian Soviet government would not sentence Makhno to death. Makhno came into contact with the exiled Ukrainian nationalists associated with Petliura, themselves allies of both Romania and Poland. Makhno&#x27;s calls for an alliance between the Makhnovists and the Petliurists to reignite an insurgency in Ukraine were unsuccessful.

With Romania still caught up in the extradition demands, Makhno fled to Poland. He was caught at the border and sent to the Polish Strzałkowo internment camp in April 1922. The Polish government refused Makhno&#x27;s requests to move to Czechoslovakia or Germany. The Russian Bolshevik government sent an agent provocateur to entrap Makhno and force his extradition by embroiling him in a plan to launch an insurgency in Galicia. Makhno and his wife were formally charged by the Polish authorities and for over a year held in pre-trial detention, where Halyna gave birth to their daughter in October. In prison, Makhno drafted his first memoir, which Peter Arshinov published in 1923 in his Berlin-based newspaper &quot;Anarkhicheskii vestnik&quot; (Russian: Анархический вестник; English: &quot;Anarchist Messenger&quot;). Makhno also sent open letters to exiled Don Cossacks and the Ukrainian Communist Party, and began to learn German and Esperanto. His tuberculosis relapsed under the prison&#x27;s conditions.

Makhno received support from the European anarchist movement. Polish and Bulgarian anarchists even threatened violence in the event of Makhno&#x27;s extradition. At their five-day trial in November 1923, Makhno and Halyna were acquitted on all charges and given residence permits for Poznań. The following month he and his family moved to Toruń, where he was under close police surveillance. He was also arrested and interrogated several times in the wake of Lenin&#x27;s death. Unable to secure a visa to travel to Germany and facing a severe strain on his marriage with Halyna, Makhno attempted suicide in April 1924 and was hospitalized by his injuries.

In July 1924, Polish authorities let Makhno and his family move to the Free City of Danzig. Here, Makhno was swiftly arrested by the Danzig authorities for visa violations. While interned he was struck again by tuberculosis and transferred to a prison hospital. Makhno&#x27;s anarchist allies helped him escape the hospital and, after a time in hiding, leave for Berlin. With Russian anarchist Volin acting as his interpreter, Makhno met with prominent anarchists that were also living in the city such as Rudolf Rocker and . He finally moved to Paris in April 1925.

=== Paris ===

Upon his arrival in Paris in April 1925, Makhno wrote that he had found himself &quot;amongst a foreign people and political enemies whom I have so often declaimed against&quot;. He was reunited with his wife and daughter in the city, where French anarchists like May Picqueray provided the family with lodging and healthcare. Makhno found work at a local foundry and a Renault factory but was forced to leave both jobs due to his health problems. His right foot was considered for amputation because of an old bullet wound in his ankle. His health care was overseen by the libertarian feminist Lucile Pelletier, who described his body as being &quot;literally encased in scar tissue&quot;. She advised his family to move out to prevent them from contracting tuberculosis. Between his debilitating illness, homesickness and a strong language barrier, Makhno fell into a deep depression. According to Alexander Berkman, Makhno particularly despised living in a big city and dreamed of returning to the Ukrainian countryside, where he could &quot;tak[e] up again the struggle for liberty and social justice&quot;.

Makhno undertook to write his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, which sold poorly. He also collaborated with exiled Russian anarchists to establish the bimonthly libertarian communist journal &quot;Delo Truda&quot; (, ), in which Makhno published an article in each issue over three years. Arshinov, the journal&#x27;s editor, criticized Makhno&#x27;s articles as poorly written, which upset Makhno greatly and exacerbated his resentment of those anarchists whom he considered to be &quot;armchair theoreticians&quot;. The theoretical developments of the journal eventually culminated in the publication of the &quot;Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists&quot;, which called for the reorganization of the anarchist movement into a more cohesive structure, based on the experiences of revolutionary Ukraine and the defeat by the Bolsheviks. The &quot;Platform&quot; attracted criticism from the synthesists, such as Volin, who regarded it as a Bolshevization of anarchism. A March 1927 meeting to discuss the &quot;Platform&quot; in L&#x27;Haÿ-les-Roses attracted anarchists from Russia, Poland, Bulgaria, Italy, and China. When the meeting was raided by police, Makhno was arrested and threatened with deportation, but he was defended by Louis Lecoin and Henri Sellier, who secured his continued stay in France.

During this period, Makhno often met with anarchist friends in cafes and restaurants, reminiscing over a bottle of wine about their time in Ukraine. In June 1926, during a meal with May Picqueray and the exiled Russian-American Jewish anarchist Alexander Berkman in a Russian restaurant, Makhno met with the Ukrainian Jewish anarchist Sholem Schwarzbard, who went pale upon seeing the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petliura walk into the room. Schwarzbard immediately informed Makhno of his intention to assassinate Petliura in revenge for the anti-Jewish pogroms carried out in the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, during which some 15 of his family members had been killed. Makhno attempted to dissuade him but the deed was carried out anyway. Schwarzbard&#x27;s subsequent trial revealed a trove of documentary evidence regarding the pogroms in Ukraine, which helped exonerate the assassin.

====Response to allegations of antisemitism====
Around this time, rumors began to circulate about Makhno&#x27;s own relationship to antisemitism, resulting in public debates on the matter. Citing stories of Makhno told by White émigrés, Joseph Kessel published a novel that portrayed a fictionalized version of Makhno as an Orthodox Christian and antisemite, an accusation which Makhno categorically denied. Makhno defended himself by speaking up about the pogroms in Ukraine: in &quot;To the Jews of all Countries&quot;, published in &quot;Delo Truda&quot;, he asked for evidence of antisemitism in the Makhnovist ranks; at an open debate in June 1927, Makhno claimed that he had defended Ukrainian Jews from persecution, an assertion that was backed up by Russian and Ukrainian Jews in attendance.

During his time in Ukraine, Makhno had condemned and severely punished cases of antisemitism within the Makhnovist ranks, even having ordered the execution of Makhnovists that had participated in a pogrom against the Jewish settlement at Gorkaya and redistributed weapons to the Jewish community for their own protection. According to Volin, investigations by the Jewish historian Elias Tcherikower had found no evidence of Makhno himself having perpetrated antisemitic violence. Allegations of antisemitism were later also disputed by historians and some of Makhno&#x27;s biographers, including Paul Avrich, Peter Kenez, Michael Malet and Alexandre Skirda.

=== Later years: Failing health and death ===
By the late 1920s, Makhno was succumbing to physical and mental illness. His relationships with fellow Ukrainian exiles deteriorated. His wife grew to resent him, causing the couple to separate several times; Halyna unsuccessfully applied for permission to return to Soviet Ukraine. Over the editing of his memoirs, Makhno quarreled with Ida Mett, who quit out of frustration with Makhno&#x27;s &quot;indecipherable and meandering manuscripts&quot;. He also came into a serious personal and political conflict with Volin, which would last until their deaths, resulting in the later volumes of Makhno&#x27;s memoirs only being published posthumously. As gossip spread about Makhno, he became increasingly defensive against any criticisms of himself, no matter how minor. In the pages of &quot;Delo Truda&quot;, he published categorical denials of anything from allegations of antisemitism to whether the Makhnovists had used a flag that carried a skull and crossbones.

Due to the threats of deportation, he mostly kept to his writing, as he was no longer able to attend meetings or engage in active organizing. In great pain, increasingly isolated and financially precarious, Makhno got odd jobs as an interior decorator and shoemaker. He was also supported by the income of his wife, who worked as a cleaner. In April 1929, May Picqueray and other French anarchists established a &quot;Makhno Solidarity Committee&quot; to raise funds. Much of the money was contributed by the Spanish anarchists of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), who greatly admired Makhno; the fundraiser in &quot;Le Libertaire&quot; eventually secured Makhno&#x27;s family a weekly allowance of 250 francs, barely one-third of the living wage. Makhno spent most of this money on his daughter, neglecting his own self-care, which contributed further to his declining health. His ideological conflict with the synthesis anarchists escalated and, in July 1930, &quot;Le Libertaire&quot; suspended his allowance. Individual fundraising attempts were unsuccessful.

Alienated from many of the Russian and French anarchists in Paris, Makhno turned his attention towards Spain. Following the release of Spanish anarchists from prison, Makhno met with Francisco Ascaso and Buenaventura Durruti. The Spaniards expressed their admiration for Makhno, who himself displayed a sense of optimism about the Spanish anarchist movement and foretold of a coming anarchist revolution in Spain. Makhno was particularly impressed by the revolutionary traditions of the Spanish working classes and the tight organization of the Spanish anarchists, declaring that if a revolution broke out in Spain before he died, then he would join the fight.

Around this time, Makhno learned that Peter Arshinov had defected to the Soviet Union, which left him even more isolated from the Ukrainian exiles. Makhno spent his last years writing criticisms of the Bolsheviks and encouraging other anarchists to learn from the mistakes of the Ukrainian experience. His final article, an obituary for his old friend Nikolai Rogdaev, went unsent as Makhno could not afford the postage. As he suffered from malnutrition, Makhno&#x27;s tuberculosis worsened to the point that he was hospitalized on 16 March 1934. After several operations failed to help, Makhno died in the early hours of 25 July 1934. He was cremated three days after his death; five hundred people attended his funeral at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==Personal life==
While imprisoned in the 1910s, Makhno received &quot;warm letters&quot; from one Nastia Vasetskaia, a young peasant woman from Huliaipole. After his return home in 1917, the two met and married, living together on a commune where Makhno contributed. But his activism during this time left him &quot;little time for personal affairs&quot;. Vasetskaia was eventually forced to flee Huliaipole after being threatened by Black Guards, taking their child with her. After Makhno himself was forced into exile by the invasion of the Central Powers in early 1918, he managed to reunite with Vasetskaia in Tsaritsyn, finding her lodging at a nearby farm. Makhno soon left her to continue his travels. They never saw each other again. Their baby died young and, after hearing a rumor that Makhno had also died, Vasetskaia found another partner.

Following the Makhnovist capture of Huliaipole from the Central Powers in late 1918, Makhno met a local schoolteacher called Halyna Kuzmenko, who became his wife and a leading figure in the Makhnovshchina. With the defeat of the Makhnovist movement, the couple fled to Romania and then on to Poland, where Kuzmenko gave birth to their daughter Elena while she and Makhno were both in prison. The family finally settled in Paris but were forced to live separately for some time due to Makhno&#x27;s worsening tuberculosis.

Years after Makhno&#x27;s death, Volin described Makhno&#x27;s &quot;greatest failing&quot; as being alcohol abuse, claiming that &quot;under the influence of alcohol, he became perverse, over-excitable, unfair, intractable and violent&quot;. These claims of alcoholism were disputed by Ida Mett and Makhno&#x27;s biographer Alexandre Skirda, who respectively noted Makhno&#x27;s low alcohol tolerance and his enforcement of prohibition during the war. Other biographers, such as Michael Malet and Victor Peters, wrote that Makhno began to drink heavily during the final years of his life, &quot;when he knew that the tuberculosis was killing him anyway&quot;.

Makhno&#x27;s widow and his daughter Elena were deported to Nazi Germany for forced labor during World War II. After the end of the war they were arrested by the Soviet NKVD and taken to Kyiv for trial in 1946. For the crime of &quot;anti-Soviet agitation&quot;, Halyna was sentenced to eight years of hard labor in Mordovia and Elena was sentenced to five years in Kazakhstan. Following the death of Stalin, the two were reunited in Taraz, where they spent the rest of their lives: Halyna would die in 1978, followed by Elena in 1993. Makhno&#x27;s relatives in Huliaipole faced harassment by Ukrainian authorities up until the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

==Legacy==
The Ukrainian anarchist insurgency continued after Makhno&#x27;s 1921 flight to Romania. Makhnovist militant groups operated clandestinely throughout the 1920s. Some continued to fight as partisans during World War II. Although the Soviets eventually extinguished the Ukrainian anarchist movement, it experienced a resurgence following the Revolutions of 1989. Various anarchist groups draw on the name of Makhno for inspiration, such as the Revolutionary Confederation of Anarcho-Syndicalists (RKAS), established in Donetsk in 1994.
Makhno is a local hero in his hometown of Huliaipole, where a statue of him stands in its main town square. The Huliaipole Local History Museum hosts a permanent exhibition dedicated to Makhno. In the late 2010s, the Huliaipole City Council prepared documentation requesting the return of Makhno&#x27;s ashes from France, as part of a campaign to attract tourists to the city, declaring Makhno to be part of the city&#x27;s brand. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, sections of the Ukrainian far right have also attempted to reclaim Makhno as a Ukrainian nationalist and to downplay his anarchist politics.

Several Soviet and Russian films depicted Makhno, often in a negative light. Makhno was the antagonist in the 1923 &quot;Red Devils&quot;, portrayed by the Odesa gangster and part-time actor Vladimir Kucherenko. He reprised his role in the 1926 sequel &quot;Savur-Mohyla&quot; and returned to crime under the pseudonym &quot;Makhno&quot;. Boris Chirkov portrayed Makhno in the 1942 epic film &quot;Alexander Parkhomenko&quot; in which he famously sang the traditional Cossack song &quot;Lovely, brothers, lovely&quot; while drinking vodka. In 1970, Valeri Zolotukhin played Makhno in the drama film &quot;Hail, Mary!&quot;. Aleksey Tolstoy&#x27;s novel trilogy &quot;The Road to Calvary&quot; portrays Makhno as a dangerous deformation of the revolution with a corrupting influence on the morally unstable. Television miniseries adaptations of the novel have also presented Makhno in a negative light. In 2005, a Russian biographical miniseries – &quot;Nine Lives of Nestor Makhno&quot; – was made about Nestor Makhno&#x27;s life. The series was noted for its positive portrayal of Makhno, although some reviewers also criticized the series for lacking narrative coherence. Hélène Châtelain directed a 1995 French documentary about Makhno.

Cultural allusions to Makhno in popular media have included a supporting role in Michael Moorcock&#x27;s 1981 alternative history novel &quot;The Steel Tsar&quot;, the opening track in the Russian rock band Lyube&#x27;s 1989 album during the fall of communism in the Eastern Bloc, a song U.S. representative Dana Rohrabacher had written and played for the 1991 official visit of a People&#x27;s Deputy of Ukraine, and the pseudonym used by the leader of an &quot;anti-yuppie crusade&quot; in San Francisco against perceived gentrification by Silicon Valley.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the legacy of Nestor Makhno and the Makhnovshchina was again taken up by Ukrainian anti-authoritarians that joined the Territorial Defense Forces (TDF). The Ukrainian Armed Forces also adopted the name &quot;Makhno&#x27;s bow&quot; () for their defense forces engaged in the battle of Huliaipole, which has occupied a key place in the line of contact between Ukrainian and Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia. A museum exhibition on Makhno was damaged during the Russian shelling of Huliaipole; his statue in the town center was protected by sandbags. On 23 May 2024, Ivan Fedorov, the Ukrainian Governor of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, reported that the statue was destroyed by Russian artillery; and on 23 August the museum was reported to have been destroyed after catching fire as a result of Russian strikes on the town. Local authorities spent a month restoring the statue, which was unveiled on 11 September 2024. In London, a group of squatters inspired by Makhno occupied the mansion of Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, in protest against the invasion.

<doc id="306429" wikidata="Q431591" url="?curid=306429" title="Neko Case">
<text>Neko Richelle Case ( ; born September 8, 1970) is an American singer-songwriter and member of the Canadian indie rock group the New Pornographers. Case&#x27;s contralto voice has been described by contemporaries and critics as a &quot;flamethrower&quot;, &quot;a powerhouse [which] seems like it might level buildings,&quot; &quot;a 120-mph fastball,&quot; and a &quot;vocal tornado&quot;. Critics also note her idiosyncratic, &quot;cryptic,&quot; &quot;imagistic&quot; lyrics, and credit her as a significant figure in the early 21st-century American revival of the tenor guitar. Case&#x27;s body of work has spanned and drawn on a range of traditions including country, folk, art rock, indie rock, and pop and is frequently described as defying or avoiding easy generic classification.

==Early life==
Born in Alexandria, Virginia, Case is the only child of James Bamford Case and Diana Mary Dubbs. Case&#x27;s paternal family surname was originally Shevchenko; her great-aunt was the professional wrestler Ella Waldek. Her father, a Vietnam veteran serving in the United States Air Force, was based in Virginia at the time of her birth. Case&#x27;s parents, who were teenagers when they had her, are of Ukrainian ancestry. Her parents divorced when Case began school. In her memoir, Case indicated that she was told that her mother died of cancer when she was in the second grade, but only two years later, she was told that this was not correct. After that, her mother flitted in and out of her life, and eventually Case cut ties with her mother for good. As she writes in the book, she had a revelation: &quot;Perhaps her mother had never been sick at all.&quot;

Case&#x27;s family relocated several times during her childhood due to her stepfather&#x27;s work as an archaeologist. She has lived in Western Massachusetts, Vermont, Oregon and Washington. She considers Tacoma, Washington to be her hometown.

Case left home and was legally emancipated at age 15. By the age of 18 she was performing as a drummer for the Del Logs and the Propanes, playing in venues including a punk club called the Community World Theater.

==Music career==
===Vancouver===
In 1994, Case moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, to attend the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design. While attending, she played drums in several local bands, including the Del Logs, the Propanes, the Weasels, Cub, and Maow. These bands were, for the most part, local punk groups. Case said of the vibrant Vancouver punk rock scene at that time, &quot;A lot of women wanted to play music because they were inspired, because it was an incredibly good time for music in the Northwest. There was a lot of clubs, a lot of bands, a lot of people coming through, a lot of all-ages stuff—it was a very exciting time to live there.&quot;

In 1998, Case left without finishing her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, which meant the loss of her student visa eligibility. She left Canada for Seattle, Washington. Before going, Case recorded vocals for a few songs that ended up on &quot;Mass Romantic&quot;, the New Pornographers&#x27; first album. Her lead vocals on songs like &quot;Letter from an Occupant&quot; are straightforward, full-volume power-pop performances, shedding any country elements. Released on November 28, 2000, &quot;Mass Romantic&quot; became a surprise success. Although the band was originally conceived as a side project for its members, the New Pornographers remain a prominent presence in the indie rock world, having released their ninth album in 2023.

In addition to recording with the New Pornographers, Case frequently collaborates with other Canadian musicians, including the Sadies and Carolyn Mark, and has recorded material by several noted Canadian songwriters, in particular on her 2001 EP &quot;Canadian Amp&quot;. As a result, she is also considered a significant figure in Canadian music—both CBC Radio 3 and the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada have referred to Case as an &quot;honourary Canadian&quot;. In 2018 Case performed at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival.

===Seattle===
Case embraced country music on her 1997 album, &quot;The Virginian&quot;. The album contained original compositions as well as covers of songs by Ernest Tubb, Loretta Lynn and the 1974 Queen song &quot;Misfire&quot;. When the album was released, critics compared Case to honky-tonk singers like Lynn and Patsy Cline, and to rockabilly pioneer Wanda Jackson, particularly in her vocal timbre.

On February 22, 2000, Case released her second solo album, &quot;Furnace Room Lullaby&quot;. The album introduced the &quot;country noir&quot; elements that have defined Case&#x27;s subsequent solo career. That tone was evident even from the cover photo, featuring Case sprawled out corpse-like on a concrete floor. On the album itself, her vocal style moves away from outright honky-tonk but retains her twang, garnering comparisons to musicians such as Cline, Lynn, Hazel Dickens, Tanya Tucker, and Dolly Parton. The title track was included on the soundtrack to Sam Raimi&#x27;s film &quot;The Gift&quot;, and &quot;Porchlight&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to &quot;The Slaughter Rule&quot;.

Case sometimes tours with Canadian singer and songwriter Carolyn Mark as the Corn Sisters. One of their performances, at Seattle&#x27;s Hattie&#x27;s Hat restaurant in Ballard, was recorded and released as an album, &quot;The Other Women&quot;, on November 28, 2000.

===Chicago===
In October 1999, around the time &quot;Furnace Room Lullaby&quot; was released, Case left Seattle for Chicago because she felt that Seattle was no longer hospitable to its local artists.

Case&#x27;s first work in Chicago was an eight-song EP that she recorded in her kitchen. &quot;Canadian Amp&quot;, her first recording without Her Boyfriends, was released on her own Lady Pilot label in 2001. She wrote two of the tracks, with the remaining six being covers, including Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Dreaming Man&quot; and Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;Alone and Forsaken&quot;. Four of the covers were written by Canadian artists. The EP was initially available only at Case&#x27;s live shows and directly from Mint Records&#x27; website, but it eventually saw wider release.

Case also recorded her third full-length album, &quot;Blacklisted&quot;, while living in Chicago.

In April 2003, Case was voted the &quot;Sexiest Babe of Indie Rock&quot; in a Playboy.com internet poll, receiving 32% of the vote. &quot;Playboy&quot; asked her to pose nude for the magazine, but she declined their offer. She told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that

I didn&#x27;t want to be the girl who posed in &quot;Playboy&quot; and then—by the way—made some music. I would be really fucking irritated if after a show somebody came up to me and handed me some naked picture of myself and wanted me to sign it instead of my CD.

In later interviews, she declined to discuss the survey at all.

===Neko Case &amp; Her Boyfriends===
Case recorded and toured for several years as Neko Case &amp; Her Boyfriends before performing solely under her name. She primarily performed her own material, but also performed and recorded cover versions of songs by artists such as My Morning Jacket, Harry Nilsson, Loretta Lynn, Tom Waits, Nick Lowe, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Scott Walker, Randy Newman, Queen, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Sparks and Hank Williams. 
Albums released included &quot;The Virginian&quot; and &quot;Furnace Room Lullaby&quot;.

===New Pornographers===
The New Pornographers&#x27; second album, &quot;Electric Version&quot;, was released on May 6, 2003. Case sang lead on even more of the songs on this album, and toured with the group again.

&quot;Twin Cinema&quot;, the New Pornographers&#x27; third album, was released on August 23, 2005, with Case again providing vocals on several tracks. In addition to providing backing vocals on several songs, Case performs lead vocals on two ballads, &quot;The Bones of an Idol&quot; and &quot;These Are the Fables&quot;. She opted out of most subsequent touring duties with the band; however, her parts were taken over by Kathryn Calder.

On &quot;Challengers&quot;, released on August 21, 2007, Case contributes lead vocals to the title song as well as &quot;Go Places&quot;, in addition to her backing vocals on the other tracks.

The 2010 album &quot;Together&quot; features Case as lead vocalist on &quot;Crash Years&quot; and &quot;My Shepherd.&quot;

The 2014 album &quot;Brill Bruisers&quot; features Case as lead vocalist on &quot;Champions of Red Wine&quot; and &quot;Marching Orders.&quot;

===Solo ===
====&quot;Blacklisted&quot;====
Case recorded her third full-length album, &quot;Blacklisted&quot;, in Tucson, Arizona. It was the first full-length album credited to Case alone, without Her Boyfriends, and was released on Bloodshot Records on August 20, 2002. Some believe the title &quot;Blacklisted&quot; alludes to Case being banned for life from the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; because she took her shirt off during a performance on August 4, 2001, at one of their outdoors &quot;Opry Plaza&quot; concerts, though Case herself has denied this. Asked about the incident in 2004, Case said &quot;I had heatstroke. People would love it to be a &#x27;fuck you&#x27; punk thing. But it was actually a physical ailment thing.&quot;

Most of the album&#x27;s fourteen songs are originals; the exceptions being covers of &quot;Running Out of Fools&quot;, previously a hit for Aretha Franklin, and &quot;Look for Me (I&#x27;ll Be Around)&quot; previously performed by Sarah Vaughan. &quot;Blacklisted&quot; finds Case even deeper in a &quot;country noir&quot; mood, and was described by critics as lush, bleak, and atmospheric. Case cited filmmaker David Lynch, composer Angelo Badalamenti, and Neil Young&#x27;s soundtrack to the film &quot;Dead Man&quot; as influences.

====&quot;Live from Austin, TX&quot;====
2003&#x27;s &quot;Live from Austin, TX&quot; was an album of live recordings made for the &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; television series.

==== &quot;The Tigers Have Spoken&quot; ====
In April 2004, Case played several shows with longtime collaborators the Sadies in Chicago and Toronto. These shows were recorded and released as a live album, &quot;The Tigers Have Spoken&quot;, by Anti Records in October 2004.

====&quot;Fox Confessor Brings the Flood&quot;====
&quot;Fox Confessor Brings the Flood&quot; was released on March 7, 2006. The album was recorded primarily in Tucson, over the course of two years as Case worked on the live &quot;The Tigers Have Spoken&quot; and continued to play with the New Pornographers. Critics hailed the record not only for Case&#x27;s trademark vocals but also her use of stark imagery and non-standard song structures. &quot;Fox Confessor Brings the Flood&quot; wound up on many &quot;Best of 2006&quot; lists, such as No.1 on the Amazon.com music editors&#x27; picks and No. 2 on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Songs Considered&quot;. The album debuted at No. 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. It contains Case&#x27;s most autobiographical song, &quot;Hold On, Hold On&quot;. Case said: &quot;the song is actually about me. It&#x27;s not metaphorical about other people. It&#x27;s not little pieces of my life made into a story about someone else or someone fictitious.&quot;

&quot;Hold On, Hold On&quot; has since been covered by Marianne Faithfull on her 2009 album &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot;.

&quot;Hold On, Hold On&quot; was used over an episode of &quot;The Killing&quot; (Season 1 Episode 6) before the final credits.

&quot;Hold On, Hold On&quot; was used in the 2015 drama film One More Time.

&quot;John Saw That Number&quot; was used in the snowboarding movie &quot;City. Park City&quot;.

====&quot;Middle Cyclone&quot;====
Case&#x27;s next album, &quot;Middle Cyclone&quot;, was released on March 3, 2009. In advance of a U.S. and European tour, Case appeared as a musical guest on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Later in 2009 she also appeared on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. Amazon.com rated &quot;Middle Cyclone&quot; the number one album of 2009. &quot;Middle Cyclone&quot; debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in its first week of release, making it Case&#x27;s first album ever to reach the top ten in the United States.

At the time of its release, no other record from an independent record company had debuted at a higher position in 2009. She toured extensively to promote &quot;Middle Cyclone&quot; with dates in North America, Europe, and Australia, as well as a performance at Lollapalooza 2009 in Grant Park, Chicago.

====&quot;The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You&quot;====
In June 2013, Case announced a new album, &quot;The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You&quot;, which was released on September 3.

====&quot;Hell-On&quot;====

====&quot;Truckdriver, Gladiator, Mule&quot;====
On November 13, 2015, Case released a compilation vinyl box set containing eight of her solo albums. The set contains her first six studio albums, including the first vinyl pressing of &quot;The Virginian,&quot; as well as a live album.

====&quot;Wild Creatures&quot;====
On April 19, 2022, Case released &quot;Wild Creatures&quot;, described as &quot;digital-only, career retrospective&quot;. The album contains 22 tracks from Case&#x27;s discography, plus one new song, &quot;Oh, Shadowless&quot;.

==Personal life==
In a 2013 NPR interview, while discussing her single &quot;Man&quot;, Case described having complicated feelings of gender and femininity: &quot;I don&#x27;t really think of myself specifically as a woman, you know? I&#x27;m kind of a critter&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m probably a little imbalanced in that if you were to look at a human creature as kind of a vase or something, my glass is a little bit more full of the man stuff than the woman stuff&quot;. As of September 2021 her Twitter bio listed her pronouns as &quot;She/Sir&quot;.

In 2025, whilst promoting her memoir in an interview with Tom Casicato for PBS Newshour’s Canvas, Case described herself as gender-fluid.

<text>Ptolemy XIV Philopator (, ; c. 59 – 44 BC) was a Pharaoh of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, who reigned from 47 until his death in 44 BC.

==Biography==
Following the death of his older brother Ptolemy XIII of Egypt on January 13, 47 BC, and according to his will, he was proclaimed Pharaoh and co-ruler by their older sister and remaining Pharaoh, Cleopatra VII of Egypt. He was about 12 years old when he acceded to the throne. He and his older sister, Cleopatra, were married, but Cleopatra continued to act as lover of Roman dictator Julius Caesar. Ptolemy is considered to have reigned in name only, as a concession to Egyptian tradition, with Cleopatra keeping actual authority.

On 15 March 44 BC Caesar was murdered in Rome by a group of conspirators whose most notable members were Brutus and Cassius. Ptolemy soon followed him in death. An inscription mentioning him as alive was dated at 26 July 44 BC. It has been assumed but remains uncertain that Cleopatra poisoned her co-ruler, with aconite, to replace him with his nephew Ptolemy XV Caesar, her son by Caesar who was proclaimed co-ruler on 2 September 44 BC and whom his mother intended to support as successor of his father.

<text>Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton (August 28, 1774 – January 4, 1821) was a Catholic religious sister in the United States and an educator, known as a founder of the country&#x27;s parochial school system. Born in New York and reared as an Episcopalian, she married and had five children with her husband William Seton. Two years after his death, she converted to Catholicism in 1805.

Seton established the first Catholic girls&#x27; school in the nation in Emmitsburg, Maryland. There she also founded the first American congregation of religious sisters, the Sisters of Charity.

After her death, Seton was the first person born in what would become the United States to be canonized by the Catholic Church (September 14, 1975).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Elizabeth Ann Bayley was born on August 28, 1774, the second child of a socially prominent couple, surgeon Richard Bayley and his wife Catherine Charlton of New York City. The Bayley and Charlton families were among the earliest European settlers in the New York area. Her father&#x27;s parents were of French Huguenot and English descent and lived in New Rochelle, New York. Numerous Huguenots had emigrated to North America in the late 17th and early 18th centuries at a time of religious persecution in France.

As Chief Health Officer for the Port of New York, her father attended to immigrants disembarking from ships at Staten Island. He also cared for New Yorkers when yellow fever swept through the city (in one outbreak, it killed 700 persons in four months). Bayley later served as the first professor of anatomy at Columbia College.

Elizabeth&#x27;s mother Catherine was the daughter of a Church of England priest who was rector for 30 years of St. Andrew&#x27;s Church on Staten Island. Elizabeth was raised in what would eventually become (in the years after the American Revolution) the Episcopal Church.

Her mother, Catherine, died in 1777 when Elizabeth was three years old, possibly due to complications from the birth of her namesake daughter Catherine. The infant died early the following year. Elizabeth&#x27;s father married Charlotte Amelia Barclay, a member of the Jacobus James Roosevelt family, to provide a mother for his two surviving daughters. The new Mrs. Bayley participated in her church&#x27;s social ministry and often took young Elizabeth with her on charitable rounds. They visited the poor in their homes to distribute food and needed items.

The couple had five children, but the marriage ended in separation. During the breakup, their stepmother rejected Elizabeth and her older sister. When their father travelled to London for further medical studies, the sisters lived temporarily in New Rochelle with their paternal uncle, William Bayley, and his wife, Sarah (Pell) Bayley. Elizabeth endured a time of darkness, grieving the absence of a second mother, as she later reflected in her journals.

In these journals, Elizabeth showed her love for nature, poetry, and music, especially the piano. Other entries expressed her religious aspirations and favorite passages from her reading, showing her introspection and natural bent toward contemplation. Elizabeth was fluent in French and English, a fine musician, and an accomplished horsewoman.

=== Marriage and motherhood ===
On January 25, 1794, at age 19, Elizabeth married William Magee Seton, aged 25, a wealthy businessman in the import trade. Samuel Provoost, the first Episcopal bishop of New York, presided at their wedding. Her husband&#x27;s father, William Seton (1746–1798), belonged to an impoverished noble Scottish family. He had emigrated to New York in 1758, and became superintendent and part-owner of the iron-works of Ringwood, New Jersey. A loyalist, the senior William Seton was the last royal public notary for the city and province of New York.

He brought his sons William (Elizabeth&#x27;s future husband) and James into the import-export mercantile firm, the William Seton Company, which became Seton, Maitland, and Company in 1793. The younger William had visited important counting houses in Europe in 1788, was a friend of Filippo Filicchi (a renowned merchant in Leghorn, Italy, with whom his firm traded), and brought the first Stradivarius violin to America.

==Marriage and family==
Shortly after they married, Elizabeth and William Seton moved into a fashionable residence on Wall Street. Socially prominent in New York society, the Setons belonged to Trinity Episcopal Church, near Broadway and Wall streets. A devout communicant, Elizabeth took John Henry Hobart (later a bishop) as her spiritual director. Along with her sister-in-law Rebecca Mary Seton (1780–1804) (her soul-friend and dearest confidante), Elizabeth continued her former stepmother&#x27;s social ministry—nursing the sick and dying among family, friends, and needy neighbors. Influenced by her father, she became a charter member of The Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children (1797) and served as its treasurer.

When the elder William Seton died, the Seton family fortunes waned during the volatile economic climate preceding the War of 1812, when the US boycotted trade with Great Britain. The couple took in William&#x27;s six younger siblings, ages seventeen to seven.

The couple already had their own five children: Anna Maria (Annina) (1795–1812), William II (1796–1868), Richard Seton (1798–1823), Catherine (1800–1891) (who was to become the first American to join the Sisters of Mercy) and Rebecca Mary (1802–1816). The much expanded family required a move to the larger Seton family residence.

===Widowhood and conversion to Catholicism ===
A dispute between the United States of America and the French Republic from 1798 to 1800 led to a series of attacks on American shipping. The United Kingdom&#x27;s blockade of France, and the loss of several of Seton&#x27;s ships at sea, resulted in William having to declare bankruptcy. The Setons lost their home at 61 Stone Street in lower Manhattan.

The following summer, Elizabeth and the children stayed with her father, who was still the health officer for the Port of New York on Staten Island. From 1801 to 1803, they lived in a house at 8 State Street. This site is now occupied by the Church of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary (built in 1964).

Through most of their married life, William Seton suffered from tuberculosis. The stress worsened his illness; his doctors sent him to Italy for the warmer climate, with Elizabeth and their eldest daughter as his companions. Upon landing at the port of Leghorn, they were held in quarantine for a month, as authorities feared they might have brought yellow fever from New York. William died there on December 27, 1803. He was buried in the Old English Cemetery in Livorno/Leghorn. Elizabeth and her daughter Anna Maria were received by the families of her late husband&#x27;s Italian business partners, Filippo and Antonio Filicchi, who introduced her to Catholicism.
After returning to New York, the widow Seton was received into the Catholic Church on March 14, 1805, by Father Matthew O&#x27;Brien, pastor of St. Peter&#x27;s Church, then the city&#x27;s only Catholic church. (Anti-Catholic laws had been lifted just a few years before). A year later, she received the sacrament of confirmation from the Bishop of Baltimore, John Carroll, the only Catholic bishop in the nation.

To support herself and her children, Seton had started an academy for young ladies, as was common for widows of social standing in that period. After news of her conversion to Catholicism spread, most parents (who were Protestant) withdrew their daughters from her school. In 1807, students attending a local Protestant Academy were boarded at her house on Stuyvesant Lane in the Bowery, near St. Mark&#x27;s Church.

Seton was about to move to Quebec, Canada, which had numerous French-speaking Catholics, when she met a visiting priest, Father Louis William Valentine Dubourg. He was a member of the French émigré community of Sulpician Fathers and then president of St. Mary&#x27;s College, Baltimore. The Sulpicians had taken refuge in the United States from the religious persecution of the Reign of Terror related to the revolution in France. They were in the process of establishing the first Catholic seminary for the United States, in keeping with the goals of their society. For several years, Dubourg had envisioned a religious school to meet the educational needs of the new nation&#x27;s small Catholic community.

===Founder===
In 1809, the widow Seton accepted the Sulpicians&#x27; invitation and moved to Emmitsburg, Maryland, where they had a mission. A year later, she established the Saint Joseph&#x27;s Academy and Free School, a school dedicated to Catholic girls&#x27; education. This effort was supported financially by Samuel Sutherland Cooper, a wealthy convert and seminarian at the newly established Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s University, begun by John Dubois, S.S., and the Sulpicians.

On July 31, 1809, Seton established a religious community in Emmitsburg dedicated to the care of children of the poor. This was the first congregation of religious sisters founded in the United States, and its school was the first free Catholic school in America. This modest beginning marked the start of the Catholic parochial school system in the United States. 
Seton&#x27;s congregation was initially called the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph&#x27;s. From that point on, she became known as &quot;Mother Seton.&quot; In 1811, the sisters adopted the rules of the Daughters of Charity, co-founded in France by Vincent de Paul and Louise de Marillac.

===Later life and death===

The remainder of Seton&#x27;s life was spent leading and developing the new congregation of sisters. Seton was described as a charming and cultured lady. Her connections to New York society and the accompanying social pressures to leave the new life she had created for herself did not deter her from embracing her religious vocation and charitable mission. The most significant difficulties she faced were internal, stemming from misunderstandings, interpersonal conflicts, and the deaths of two daughters, other loved ones, and young sisters in the community.

Elizabeth Ann Seton died on January 4, 1821, at the age of 46. Today, her remains are interred in the National Shrine of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton in Emmitsburg, Maryland.

==Legacy==

By 1830, the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph&#x27;s were running orphanages and schools as far west as Cincinnati and New Orleans. They established the first hospital west of the Mississippi in St. Louis, Missouri.

Seton originally intended to join the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, but the embargo of France due to the Napoleonic Wars prevented this connection. Decades later, in 1850, the Emmitsburg community took steps to merge with the Daughters and become their first American branch, as their foundress had envisioned.

Today, six separate religious congregations trace their roots to the beginnings of the Sisters of Charity in Emmitsburg. In addition to the original community of Sisters at Emmitsburg (now part of the Vincentian order), they are based in New York City; Cincinnati, Ohio; Halifax, Nova Scotia; Convent Station, New Jersey; and Greensburg, Pennsylvania. The community at Convent Station established the Academy of Saint Elizabeth in 1860 and the College of Saint Elizabeth in 1899. Additionally, a church in Bothell, Washington, has been named after her.

Elizabeth Ann Seton has also been inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Canonization==
Theologians approved Seton&#x27;s spiritual writings on January 15, 1936, and her cause was formally opened on February 28, 1940, granting her the title of Servant of God. In 1952, a miracle involving the healing of 4-year-old Ann O&#x27;Neil from leukemia was attributed to the intercession of Seton after a nun prayed for the girl to Seton. The miracle was a factor in the beatification of Seton and Seton was beatified by Pope John XXIII on March 17, 1963. The pope said on the occasion, &quot;In a house that was very small, but with ample space for charity, she sowed a seed in America which by Divine Grace grew into a large tree.&quot;

Pope Paul VI canonized Seton on September 14, 1975, in a ceremony in St. Peter&#x27;s Square. In his words, &quot;Elizabeth Ann Seton is a saint. St. Elizabeth Ann Seton is an American. All of us say this with special joy and with the intention of honoring the land and the nation from which she sprang forth as the first flower in the calendar of the saints. Elizabeth Ann Seton was wholly American! Rejoice for your glorious daughter. Be proud of her. And know how to preserve her fruitful heritage.&quot; The miracle which led to the canonization of Seton involved the healing of a man, Carl Kalin, in 1963, who was given hours to live after contracting meningitis and having encephalitis in his brain.

Seton&#x27;s feast day is January 4, the eleventh day of Christmastide and the anniversary of her death.

Elizabeth Ann Seton is honored on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on January 4.

==Tributes==
In 2025, in honor of the 50th Anniversary of Elizabeth Ann Seton&#x27;s Canonization, Roman Mykyta created a one-act ballet about her life, originally performed by The Ballet Theatre of Maryland, titled &quot;Elizabeth.&quot; The ballet used the music of Concerto gregoriano by Ottorino Respighi. Elizabeth Ann Seton valued dance as healthy exercise and her monogrammed dancing slippers are preserved for posterity at the National Shrine of Elizabeth Ann Seton, adding a special significance to the creation of the ballet.

Rodriguez moved to the Dominican Republic with her mother when she was eight years old, and lived there until age 11. Later, she moved to Puerto Rico until the age of 17, and finally settled in Jersey City, New Jersey. She dropped out of William L. Dickinson High School, but later earned her GED. In total, she was expelled from five schools. She briefly attended business school before quitting to pursue a career in acting, with the ultimate goal of becoming a screenwriter and director. Rodriguez has ten siblings and half-siblings. She was partly raised by her devoutly religious maternal grandmother, and was brought up as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness (her mother&#x27;s religion), although she has since abandoned the faith. A DNA test of Rodriguez, performed by the television program &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, found that her ancestry is 72.4% European, 21.3% African, and 6.3% Native American. She stated on the show that there was some racial conflict between her families, since her Puerto Rican father had a light complexion as opposed to her darker skinned Dominican mother.

==Career==
===Film and television===
Having run across an ad for an open casting call and attending her first audition, Rodriguez beat 350 other applicants to win her first role in the low-budget 2000 independent film &quot;Girlfight&quot;. With her performance as Diana Guzman, a troubled teen who decides to channel her aggression by training to become a boxer, Rodriguez accumulated several awards and nominations for the role in independent circles, including major acting accolades from the National Board of Review, Deauville Film Festival, Independent Spirit Awards, Gotham Awards, Las Vegas Film Critics Sierra Awards, and many others. The film itself took home a top prize at the Sundance and won Award of the Youth at the Cannes Film Festival.

Rodriguez has had notable roles in other successful films, including Letty in &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (2001) and Rain Ocampo in &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (2002). She appeared in &quot;Blue Crush&quot; and &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; In 2004, Rodriguez lent her voice to the video game &quot;Halo 2&quot;, playing a Marine. She provided the voice of Liz Ricarro in the Cartoon Network series &quot;IGPX&quot;. From 2005 to 2006, she played tough cop Ana Lucia Cortez on the television series &quot;Lost&quot; during the show&#x27;s second season (the character&#x27;s first appearance was a flashback during the first season&#x27;s finale, &quot;Exodus: Part 1&quot;), and returned for a cameo in the second episode of the show&#x27;s fifth season, &quot;The Lie&quot;, in 2009. She returned again in the penultimate episode of the series, &quot;What They Died For&quot;, in 2010. In 2006, Rodriguez appeared in her own episode of G4&#x27;s show &quot;Icons.&quot;

In 2007, Rodriguez appeared in the political drama &quot;Battle in Seattle&quot; opposite Charlize Theron and Woody Harrelson. In 2009, she appeared in &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot;, the fourth installment of &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; film series. Later that year, Rodriguez starred in James Cameron&#x27;s science fiction adventure epic &quot;Avatar&quot;, which became the highest-grossing film in history and Rodriguez&#x27;s most successful film to date. In 2009, Rodriguez starred in &quot;Trópico de Sangre&quot;, an independent film based on the Dominican Republic&#x27;s historic Mirabal sisters.

In 2010, Rodriguez appeared in Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Machete&quot;. In 2011, she appeared with Aaron Eckhart in the science fiction film &quot;&quot;. In 2012, she returned to play the good clone and bad clone of Rain Ocampo in &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot;. In 2013, she reprised her roles as Letty in &quot;Fast &amp; Furious 6&quot; and Luz / Shé in the Robert Rodriguez sequel &quot;Machete Kills&quot;. She also voiced a character in DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s &quot;Turbo&quot;.

In 2015, she appeared in &quot;Furious 7&quot;. In 2016 she starred in &quot;The Assignment&quot; alongside Sigourney Weaver. In 2017, she lent her voice to &quot;&quot;. She starred in &quot;The Fate of the Furious&quot;, which broke records for the largest global box office opening of all time. In 2018, she starred opposite Viola Davis in &quot;Widows&quot; from director Steve McQueen, and in 2019 reunited with director James Cameron on the film &quot;&quot;. Rodriguez started Cheshire Kat Productions, a production company that produced the documentary &quot;Stuntwomen: The Untold Hollywood Story&quot; (2019).

===Screenwriting===
As of 2013, Rodriguez stated she was working on several projects, including a family adventure film, a drug drama, and a female-oriented period piece.

==Personal life==
Rodriguez&#x27;s hobbies include tactical gun training, skydiving, and DJing.

In early 2000, Rodriguez broke off an engagement to a Muslim boyfriend, citing opposition to religious requests he made of her. In 2001, she reportedly dated her &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; co-star Vin Diesel.

In late 2010, Rodriguez trained with Sea Shepherd to join the direct action activism of the marine conservation organization during Operation No Compromise.

In 2013, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; quoted her as saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve gone both ways. I do as I please. I am too curious to sit here and not try when I can. Men are intriguing. So are chicks.&quot; As she explained to &quot;Latina&quot; magazine: &quot;I&#x27;m getting older. Eventually it&#x27;s going to wrinkle up and I&#x27;m not going to be able to use it. I wanted to be honest about who I am and see what happens.&quot; The following year, she said in an interview that she hoped her actions would help others in a similar situation: &quot;Maybe by me opening my big fat mouth like I usually do and stepping up and owning who I am, maybe it might inspire somebody else to do the same.&quot; She described herself as bisexual in another interview later that month: &quot;Bi, yeah, I fall under the B-category of LGBT.&quot; Regarding the lack of unconventional female roles available in films, she said: &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with being bi? I mean, we&#x27;re getting flak everywhere we go.&quot;
===Legal issues===
In March 2002, Rodriguez was arrested for assault after getting into a fight with her roommate. The charges were later dropped after the roommate declined to press the allegations in court.

In November 2003, Rodriguez went to court to face eight misdemeanor charges based on two driving incidents, including a hit and run and driving under the influence (DUI). In June 2004, Rodriguez pleaded no contest in Los Angeles to three of the charges: Hit and run; drunken driving; and driving with a suspended license. She went to jail for 48 hours, performed community service at the morgues of two New York hospitals, completed a three-month alcohol program, and was placed on probation for three years.

In 2005, while filming &quot;Lost&quot; in Hawaii, Rodriguez was pulled over by Honolulu police multiple times for speeding violations, and on December 1 was arrested for DUI. In April 2006, she pleaded guilty to one charge of driving under the influence, and chose to pay a fine and spend five days in jail.

Rodriguez cited her high doses of allergy-relieving steroids as one of the reasons for her erratic behavior. Because the incident was a violation of her Los Angeles probation, she was sentenced to 60days in jail, a 30-day alcohol rehabilitation program, and another 30days of community service, including work for Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Because of overcrowding, she was released from jail on the same day she entered.

In September 2007, Rodriguez allegedly violated her probation by neither completing her community service nor following an alcohol education program. On October 10, 2007, following a hearing, she was sentenced to 180days jail time after agreeing to admit to violating her probation. She was expected to spend the full 180-day term in jail but was released 18 days later due to overcrowding. In January 2009, Rodriguez completed her community service.

<text>Maria Mies (; 6 February 1931 – 15 May 2023) was a German professor of sociology, a Marxist feminist, an activist for women&#x27;s rights, and an author. She came from a rural background in the Volcanic Eifel, and initially trained to be a teacher. After working for several years as a primary school teacher and qualifying as a high school instructor, she applied to the Goethe Institute, hoping to work in Africa or Asia. Assigned to a school in Pune, India, she discovered that while her male students took German courses to further their education, women for the most part took her classes to avoid marriage. Returning to study at the University of Cologne, she prepared her dissertation about contradictions of social expectations for women in India in 1971, earning her PhD the following year.

Mies was active in social movements from the late 1960s. Her activism was in favour of women&#x27;s liberation and pacifism and against the Vietnam War and nuclear armaments. She taught sociology at the Cologne University of Applied Sciences and University of Frankfurt Institute for Social Research in the 1970s. Becoming aware of the lack of knowledge about women&#x27;s history, she helped found and then gave lectures at the first women&#x27;s shelter in Germany. In 1979, she began teaching women&#x27;s studies at the International Institute of Social Studies in The Hague and founded a master&#x27;s degree programme for women from developing countries, based on feminist theory.

Returning to Germany and the University of Applied Sciences in 1981, Mies became involved in the ecofeminist movement and in activism against genetic engineering and reproductive technology. She coined the phrase &quot;housewifisation&quot; for the processes that devalue women&#x27;s labour and make it invisible. From the 1980s, she wrote extensively about the intersection between capitalism, patriarchy and colonialism. Mies was one of the first scholars to recognise the similarities between the socio-politico-economic positions held by women and colonised people. Her works theorised that women and colonised people&#x27;s labour was devalued and exploited under capitalism, and studied the links between women&#x27;s struggles for liberation and their broader struggles for social and environmental justice. One of her main concerns was the development of an alternative, feminist and decolonial approach in methodology and in economics. Her work, which included writing textbooks on the history of women&#x27;s movements, has garnered international analysis and been translated into several languages.

== Early life and education ==

Mies was born in Hillesheim, Germany, on 6 February 1931 to Johann and Gertrud Mies. She came from a rural background, growing up in a family of farmers in Auel, a village in the Vulkaneifel region of the Prussian Rhine Province (now in Rhineland-Palatinate). She was the seventh of twelve children, who all worked in the fields while they were pupils at the local school with only one classroom. Her mother&#x27;s temperament was optimistic, but her father was a patriarchal figure and caused fear for the family members with his anger. They were raised as Catholic. She was the first student from her village to complete secondary school, which she attended in Gerolstein, while boarding with a family friend. She then started at the Regino-Gymnasium in Prüm, but the school was closed in September 1944 because of the war.

From 1947, she trained in Trier where she earned her abitur and then enrolled at the Pedagogical Academy in Koblenz to become a primary school teacher. In order to attend courses free of charge, she had to agree to teach for five years. After two years of study, she was assigned to primary schools in Auel and later in Worms. In 1950, Mies met a Pakistani Muslim tourist who was travelling in Germany. Zulfiquar would have a profound influence on her life, as their relationship developed into a romance. Rejecting his proposal of marriage on the basis of their incompatible religions, led her to serious study of religious doctrines and patriarchy. She chose to remain single for many years in order to maintain her independence. In 1955, she asked for a new placement and was sent to Trier, where she taught and also studied English. Mies passed her secondary teacher&#x27;s examination in 1962 and was assigned to teach English and German in Morbach. Unwilling to be a secondary school teacher, she applied to the Goethe Institute and asked for a placement in Asia or the Middle East.

==Career and activism==
===1963–1977===
In 1963, Mies was accepted by the Goethe Institute to lecture in Pune, India, on a five-year teaching engagement. She taught German classes and discovered that while her male students enrolled to enhance their ability to study engineering, the majority of women took her courses to prolong their independence, as middle-class women were not required to marry until they had completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree. One of her students, Chhaya Datar, later became head of the women&#x27;s studies department at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. Another, Saral Sarkar, later became her husband. In 1967, her mother became gravely ill and Mies asked to be released early from her contract. Soon after her return to Germany her mother made a full recovery, and Mies enrolled at the University of Cologne to study sociology under René König. Using her observations during her time in India about women&#x27;s behaviour and the contradictions of social expectations for women, she prepared her PhD thesis (&quot;Role Conflicts of Educated Indian Women&quot;) in 1971. She earned her doctorate in 1972, and her thesis was published the following year.
The late 1960s and early 1970s was a period of global protest and Mies became involved in activism. She participated in protests against the Vietnam War and nuclear armaments in the annual pacifist . She joined (Women&#x27;s Forum Cologne), a local women&#x27;s group tied to the women&#x27;s liberation movement, which protested patriarchal structures and the devaluation of women. She participated in the (political night-prayers), organised by Dorothee Sölle, which were aimed at questioning the status of women in the church. As she became more involved in protest and women&#x27;s lack of equality, Mies became critical of religion and left the Catholic church. She taught at the newly founded Cologne University of Applied Sciences, before accepting a post in 1974 to teach at the University of Frankfurt Institute for Social Research. For three years, she presented seminars on the historic international women&#x27;s movement, hoping she could convince the university to establish a women&#x27;s study chair. In 1975, she attended the World Conference on Women in Mexico City and realised how little was known about women&#x27;s history. In 1976, she married Sarkar, with the intent of having a visiting marriage allowing each to continue their careers in their respective countries. That year, she joined with other activists, mainly students of her classes, to found the women&#x27;s shelter (&quot;Frauenhaus&quot;) in Cologne, one of the first of its kind in Germany. Mies lectured at the shelter, teaching women practical and political ways to combat violence. She returned to the University of Applied Sciences in 1977, but decided to conduct a research project in India the following year.

===1978–2001===

Mies arrived in India in 1978 to analyze rural subsistence production, meaning how domestic and farm labour, as well as cottage industry, allowed families to survive, but also led to the expansion of wealth for landlords and industries. She remained in India to the end of 1979 and spent time with her former pupil, Sarkar, who at the time was a lecturer at the Goethe Institute in Hyderabad. The results of her study of rural industry were published as &quot;The Lacemakers of Narsapur: Indian Housewives Produce for the World Market&quot; in 1982. She returned to Europe after accepting a position at the International Institute of Social Studies in The Hague. There, she created a master&#x27;s degree programme for women from developing countries. To enable her students to complete the practical requirements, Mies made contact with local feminist groups to develop joint projects they could carry out. The administration decided not to renew the &quot;Women and Development&quot; programme for the next semester but Mies and her students successfully protested and the course continued to be offered. Because no textbooks at that time existed on the history of women&#x27;s movements, particularly for the Global South, Mies and Kumari Jayawardena, a political scientist at the University of Colombo, wrote a series of texts for their students to use. Launching an international research project, she worked with scholars Mia Berden, Rhoda Reddock, and Saskia Wieringa to create a historiography of women&#x27;s movements for Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America with help from academics and activists from those countries.

The programme was based on ideas she had first developed about women&#x27;s studies and feminist scholarship in a 1977 paper &quot;Towards a Methodology for Feminist Research&quot; delivered at a conference in Frankfurt. To combat what she saw as a disconnect between theory and practical application in the academic setting, Mies aimed to rewrite existing teaching methods. She did not believe that feminist research could use existing research models and proposed instead seven steps to completely re-imagine research with usefulness and respect for the subject in mind. These steps included a rejection of both quantitative methods and extrapolation of studies on men to apply to women&#x27;s experiences. She argued that research should be participatory, meaning that the researcher and the subject should collaborate in the processes and goals of the study, which should aim at empowering women and dismantling patriarchal systems. The paper was later published as a chapter of the book &quot;Theories of Women&#x27;s Studies&quot; (1983), and praised for its methodological innovations and theoretical advancements. Scholar Nancy Barnes, stated that Mies&#x27;s article was so compelling that &quot;it alone makes the book worth buying&quot;, but noted that the chapter did not resolve the question of whether women&#x27;s studies should be a stand-alone field, or integrated into other fields.
In 1981, Mies decided to return to Cologne and the University of Applied Sciences and Sarkar, her husband, joined her there permanently in 1982. She became involved in the ecofeminist movement, as well as in activism against genetic engineering and reproductive technology, which she saw as an expropriation of a woman&#x27;s right to give birth and a commercialization of human production. She was one of the founders of the Feminist International Network of Resistance to Reproductive and Genetic Engineering. Within this organization and in her works, she argued that women from the Global North were urged to use invasive technologies such as assisted fertilisation and surrogacy to increase their child-bearing, while women in the Global South were pressed to limit births to control population growth. Mies also pointed out that to exercise decisions about their bodies, women are limited by systems designed, controlled, and administered by health providers and government officials. She became more active in pacifist activities, participating in a resistance camp protesting against a NATO plan to station nuclear warheads in Germany in 1983. Her pacifism was reinforced by her opposition to the idea put forth by Alice Schwarzer that women could gain emancipation if they had the same violent means which were available to men. Opposed to war, Mies could not reconcile that simple equality with men would overcome hierarchical systems that devalued women. Having retired from teaching in 1993, she continued to be active in women&#x27;s and other social movements. She was a founding member of Attac, formed in 1999, and organised feministAttac, in 2001 at the association&#x27;s congress, held that year in Berlin.

== Scholarly contributions ==
Mies&#x27;s earliest works such as &quot;Indian Women in Patriarchy&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Lace Makers of Narsapur&quot; (1982), which evaluated her years in India, as well as later works like &quot;Sexist and Racist Implications of New Reproductive Technology&quot; (&quot;Alternatives&quot;, 1987) critiqued policies aimed at maintaining an uneven, stratified societal structure which encouraged domination and exploitation. She sought to evaluate how women&#x27;s labour became hidden and how the perception that women were reliant upon a husband&#x27;s income emerged. She theorised that by eliminating pay for the work women performed, making them available at all times for labour, alienating them from society by keeping them in the home, giving them no job security, and eliminating their ability to contract or unionise, women lost agency. She named the process which prevented women from being seen as producers or self-employed individuals and resulted in their exploitation, &quot;housewifisation&quot;. The anthropologist Danielle Léveillé characterised Mies&#x27;s works as both &quot;masterful&quot; and &quot;astonishing&quot; in that she was able to link variables from the anti-colonial, anti-racist, ecology, feminist, and non-violence movements to critique policies that established power relationships in society. 

Political scientist pointed to Mies&#x27;s connection of the threads in society that united women, colonised people, and nature as being free for exploitation. The unpaid labour of the former was easily equated to the free availability of air and water. Prügl tested Mies&#x27;s theory that housewives were superexploited and confirmed that they were. Using data from the International Labour Organization, she found that housewives universally earned less than the legal minimum wage. In looking at homemakers in Brazil, Britain, Pakistan, Thailand, and Turkey, Prügl confirmed that housewives were typically viewed as non-workers. However, she found that there was not a universal acceptance by women, or their various societies, of the cultural and political meaning of housewifery and its value. She concluded that because of the &quot;multiple contextual meanings&quot; of the term housewife, exploitation more likely resulted from the political, rather than economic, spread of capitalism. Prügl questioned whether housewifisation as an underpinning of capitalism failed to evaluate whether exploitation was instead related to global patriarchy.

From the mid-1980s, Mies published her most important works which explored the links between patriarchy, capitalism and colonialism in the exploitation and subjugation of women.
In the book &quot;Patriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale Women in the International Division of Labour&quot; (1986), Mies evaluated the development of feminism, the sexual division of labour, and how violence shaped politics in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In her analysis, the process of &quot;housewifisation&quot; was based on the Western ideals of capital accumulation. In other words, by destroying women&#x27;s autonomy and making them possessions, men were able to acquire productive capital and amass wealth. She saw family violence, not as a remnant of ancient society, but as a part of the processes to modernise. In the work, she found that socialist development had created similar social structures exploiting women and argued for creation of a utopian feminist society. In Mies&#x27;s vision, the basis for labour would be usefulness rather than accumulation. She theorised that if consumers in overdeveloped places fulfilled their needs to sustain life from producers in underdeveloped countries, it would give worldwide relief from exploitation. Léveillé noted that while such a plan might work, its drawback was that it devalued things like music, flowers, and art, which while not essential or necessary to support human life provided therapeutic benefits.

Picking up themes of domination from &quot;Patriarchy and Accumulation&quot;, Mies&#x27;s 1988 book &quot;Women: The Last Colony&quot;, written with social scientists Veronika Bennholdt-Thomsen and Claudia von Werlhof, brought colonised people into the analysis. They explained that just as women were rendered invisible, subjugated people were isolated from mainstream society and were treated as a natural resource to be exploited. Departing from a strict Marxist feminist argument, the central theme of the work was that the exploitation and oppression of women and colonised people were not secondary results caused by capitalism, but fundamental to creating the mechanisms of global production. anthropology professor, , noted that Mies argued that labour exploitation was a primary factor in developing both social classes and economic divisions. Meintel also said that Mies&#x27;s chapter 7, &quot;Class Struggles and Women&#x27;s Struggles in India&quot;, was &quot;worth the price of the book&quot;, as it told of the successful resistance by women in Andhra Pradesh, who aligned with male peasants&#x27; fight to protect their rights. 
&quot;Ecofeminism&quot; (1993), written by Mies and scholar Vandana Shiva used a Marxist approach to evaluate climate change, loss of diversity, multi-systemic failures, and resistance. They evaluated how production systems and accumulation caused dispossession of land and culture, leading to problems such as world hunger. Mies and Shiva argued that women were linked internationally by their common experiences related to capitalist expansion. According to the environmental scholar Catriona Sandilands, unlike other ecofeminist works the book demonstrated that despite geographical differences and socio-economic variances &quot;women&#x27;s lives and bodies are being colonised&quot; through capitalist mechanisms. Yet, Sandilands also said that gender was not the only factor involved in creating capitalist inequalities, and that a theory based on that single premise must be flawed. She said that given the diversity of women&#x27;s experiences and cultural contexts, the claim that subsistence activities would solve global distribution problems might be utopian. 

The book was updated and republished in 2014, concluding that the issues it had addressed were worsening instead of improving. It was also translated into Spanish in 2016. Evaluating the links between technology, science, and cultural development, scholars Jimena Andrieu and María Julia Eliosoff Ferrero, said that Mies and Shiva pointed out that globalisation led to a crisis which reduced human freedoms by commodifying and privatising everything to increase production and profits. Mies and Shiva argued that by placing nurturing of life and health as the focal point of economics, a balance between society, the economy, and the ecosystem would be restored. The re-issuance of the book sparked new debate on the roles of women in activist movements in the Global South. Andrieu and Eliosoff disagreed with the theory, saying that with large sectors of the population unemployed and living in poverty in the southern hemisphere, the turn toward subsistence and producing only goods that sustain life was questionable.
In &quot;The Subsistence Perspective&quot; (1999), Mies and Bennholdt-Thomsen argued that subsistence production, the production of goods and services for personal or community use, has been devalued, hidden, and marginalised by capitalist systems. Using the &quot;iceberg model&quot;, they noted that the only visible labour in a traditional capitalistic society is that of the formal labour force. Hidden below the surface, the base of the iceberg represents unpaid domestic work, caring, and informal labour, which includes various forms of untaxed labour such as micro-entrepreneurs, child labourers and family members who work for other family members, and non-permanent workers. They argued in favour of a society in which, instead of delegating labour-intensive work to certain segments of the population, communities shared all tasks. The sharing model would give each person a basic income, some security, and a measure of power in decision-making. The book was called an &quot;excellent feminist source on political economy&quot; by the sociologist Ariel Salleh of Western Sydney University.

== Later life, death, and legacy ==
Mies wrote an autobiography, (&quot;The Village and the World: My Life, Our Times&quot;, 2008). In a review, feminist academic Renate Klein, who knew Mies for nearly three decades, wrote that it was an honest reflection of the failures and successes of Mies&#x27;s life. Klein said that Mies&#x27;s youth in a self-sufficient farming village gave her the practical skills to meet life&#x27;s struggles and shaped her future works on subsistence theory. She called the autobiography &quot;an important piece of contemporary and women&#x27;s history&quot;, because it recalled how feminism – and the fight against discrimination, exploitation, and violence – had changed and grown over the period of Mies&#x27;s life. In her later years, Mies lived in a care facility, and at the end of her life was unable to recognise her husband, who visited her daily. Mies died on 15 May 2023, at age 92. 

Author Monika Mengel, stated that Mies is regarded as a pioneer of women&#x27;s studies in Germany and Ireen Dubel, a policy expert on women&#x27;s rights, stated that not only were her scholarly contributions pioneering, but they served as &quot;inspiration for different generations of feminist scholars and activists. Her original concept of &quot;housewifisation&quot;, introduced in &quot;Patriarchy and Accumulation&quot; but developed in her study of lacemakers in India, is widely used by academics. Mies was one of the first feminist scholars to analyze the similarities between the position of women and colonised people in socio-economic hierarchies. Her book &quot;Ecofeminism&quot; has had international impact, and has been translated into several languages, including Spanish and Turkish.

<text>&quot;A Love Before Time&quot; is a song for Ang Lee’s movie &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;. It was sung by Chinese-American singer CoCo Lee and featured Yo-Yo Ma on cello, with music by Tan Dun and Jorge Calandrelli. The English lyrics was written by James Schamus. Released in 2000, the song was nominated for best original song at the 73rd Academy Awards.

CoCo Lee performed the song at the Academy Awards ceremony in March 2001. She is the first, and so far only, Chinese to perform at the Awards.

The song was introduced by the actress Julia Stiles as an “evocative love ballad” that combined &quot;the flavor and texture of Eastern music with the orchestral color and sensitive lyrics of Western culture&quot; in the ceremony.

Ang Lee also recorded a Chinese (Mandarin) version of the song, 月光愛人. Performed by Coco Lee, the lyrics of this version were written by Kevin Yi during a flight to the US.

<doc id="306465" wikidata="Q1194412" url="?curid=306465" title="River City Ransom">
<text>River City Ransom, known as Street Gangs in PAL regions, is an open world beat &#x27;em up video game originally for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is an English localization of &quot;Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari&quot; for the Famicom. The game was developed by Technōs Japan and released in Japan on April 25, 1989.

&quot;River City Ransom&quot; is the third game in Technos&#x27; &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; series released for the NES, preceded by &quot;Renegade&quot; and &quot;Super Dodge Ball&quot;. Like its predecessors, the game underwent great changes in its storyline and visuals during localization to make it more palatable for Western markets. It was the first console game published by the developer&#x27;s North American subsidiary American Technos.

Remakes have been released for the X68000, PC-Engine Super CD-ROM², and Game Boy Advance. The NES version was re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2007 and the Nintendo Wii U Virtual Console in October 2015. It was also released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in PAL Regions on July 25, 2013, on November 14 in North America. It was released again with the launch of Nintendo Switch Online on September 18, 2018.

==Gameplay==

&quot;River City Ransom&quot; is a beat &#x27;em up game with action role-playing elements. The game is non-linear, allowing players to explore an open world in a sandbox manner. The fighting style is similar to &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, in that the player can move freely around the screen while pressing buttons to punch, kick, or jump. The player can also use items such as brass knuckles, steel pipes, and trash cans as melee weapons or throw them at enemies.

The plot follows high school students Alex and Ryan as they cross River City in an attempt to reach River City High and rescue Ryan&#x27;s girlfriend Cyndi from the clutches of a villain called &quot;Slick&quot;. Along the way, they battle gangs of students and their gang leaders, latter of which act as bosses. In the original NES version there are nine gangs in total, with names such as &quot;The Generic Dudes&quot;, &quot;The Frat Guys&quot;, &quot;The Jocks&quot; or &quot;The Squids&quot;. Gang members are distinguished by the color of their t-shirt; each gang has unique characteristics and attacking patterns.

The characters&#x27; effectiveness in battle is determined by their stats in combination with unlockable fighting techniques such as Grand Slam, Stone Hands, and Dragon Feet. These techniques are purchasable as books in shops throughout the city. Players can collect loot from defeated gang members, and these funds may be spent on various food items and spa treatments which serve to not only revitalize the player&#x27;s stats, but may also permanently increase attributes like &quot;Punch&quot; and &quot;Kick&quot;. The game has a password system for saving and loading of the player’s character stats, skills, possessions, money, and defeated bosses.

==Development==

&quot;River City Ransom&quot; is an English localization of &quot;Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari&quot;, the third title starring Technōs Japan&#x27;s mascot character Kunio (and the first entry in the series where Kunio teams up with his rival, Riki). In addition to anglicizing all of the names and dialogue, the characters&#x27; sprites were redrawn to replace the Japanese school uniforms with t-shirts and jeans. In the original, the gangs are all students from different high schools, and many of its characters would reappear in subsequent &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; games (particularly those directed by Sekimoto and Yoshida).

The number of difficulty settings was reduced from three to two; the easiest difficulty setting was removed, and the Medium setting was changed to &quot;Novice&quot;. An alternate version of the 2-player mode which disables player-versus-player damage was also removed. In addition to the password feature for keeping track of the player&#x27;s progress, the Famicom version supports the Turbo File, a peripheral released only in Japan that allows the player to save and load their progress.

&quot;River City Ransom&quot; was the first console game localized by Technōs Japan&#x27;s U.S. subsidiary, American Technos, Inc. Although most of Technōs Japan&#x27;s previous games were also released in North America, they were licensed out to other publishers. American Technos&#x27; second and final game would be &quot;Kunio-kun&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Crash &#x27;n&#x27; the Boys: Street Challenge&quot;.

In February 2020, an alternate localization called Downtown Nekketsu Story was released in North America. This version more closely resembles the Famicom version, being a direct translation of the original. It was released alongside other fully-translated &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; Famicom titles as part of the &quot;Double Dragon &amp; Kunio-kun Retro Brawler Bundle&quot; for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

==Ports==
===X68000===
&quot;Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari&quot; was ported to the X68000, a Japanese computer platform, and released in April 1990. This version of the game, which was developed by SPS and published by Sharp, features several enhancements to the Famicom original, such as displaying three enemy characters on-screen instead of just two, slightly more colorful graphics, an expanded game world, and new items and special techniques for the player (including some that were only used by certain enemy characters in the Famicom version, such as the headbutt and the whirlwind kick). The new locations includes several new shops (such as a dojo) and the schools of each enemy gang, each featuring two new bosses. In addition to the player&#x27;s regular stats, the player also has individual stats for all the special techniques their character has acquired. The more frequently a special move is used to finish off enemies, the stronger that particular move becomes. Unlike the Famicom version, the X68000 does not feature adjustable difficulty settings. The player can save and load their progress in one of ten save files provided by the game itself.

===PC Engine===
The PC Engine Super CD-ROM² version of &quot;Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari&quot;, released on December 24, 1993, was published by Naxat Soft and developed by KID, the same team that did the PC Engine versions of &quot;Nekketsu Kōkō Dodgeball&quot; (&quot;Super Dodge Ball&quot;), &quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot;, and &quot;Downtown Nekketsu Kōshinkyoku&quot;. This version features enhanced graphics, an arranged redbook soundtrack and fully voiced characters, with the voices of Kunio and Riki performed by Ryō Horikawa and Nobutoshi Canna respectively. The player&#x27;s progress is saved in this version on the PC Engine&#x27;s backup memory. The rest of the game is almost identical to the Famicom version.

===Game Boy Advance===

A GBA version of the game, titled was released in Japan on March 5, 2004 and in North America on May 26. This remake was developed by Million and published by Atlus. The most notable change from the original version is the loss of a true cooperative mode. Instead, the game can be played with an AI-controlled partner, and players may exchange the data of their own characters to fight alongside each other. The GBA version also includes a vast number of configurable options that can adjust game play on the fly, such as changing AI behaviour, the number of enemies in one map area, and shop item reshuffling frequency. The password system is replaced by battery backup, which allows saving up to 12 characters. Character&#x27;s appearances, keystrokes for learned techniques, even enemy characters can be customized and saved using secret shop items. A saved game does not store story progress or reputation, but it does store the player&#x27;s statistics, techniques, current items and money, player&#x27;s name, and customized appearances. The player can gain additional computer-controlled allies and form a &quot;posse&quot; who helps the player on his adventure. Some of these boss characters are from the original NES version, while others are taken from later &quot;Downtown Nekketsu&quot; games. The player can be accompanied by up to three AI-controlled partners.

===Digital ports===
Many years after the original NES version was released, it was digitally ported to four more Nintendo systems: the Wii, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U and Nintendo Switch. The game has also been digitally released on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

The first digital port of &quot;River City Ransom&quot; was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on October 23, 2007, in PAL regions on February 21, 2008, and in North America on April 21. The western NES titles, graphics, and storylines for the latter two releases were left intact. &quot;Ransom&quot; was next released on the 3DS Virtual Console available through the 3DS eShop in Japan on November 28, 2012, PAL region on July 25, 2013 and North America on November 14. Like other 3DS Virtual Console games, the user is able to create a restore point in the game. It also features a two player mode via download play. Only one person needs to own a copy of the game in order to play, and restore points are disabled during two player mode. Three years later &quot;Ransom&quot; was then made available on the Wii U Virtual Console, and another three years later, it was also released on the NES emulator available through the Nintendo Switch Online service worldwide on September 18, 2018, complete with HD graphics and the ability to create save states, like the other NES games offered.

==Reception==

Outside Japan, &quot;River City Ransom&quot; was not highly successful when initially released, but due to its unique gameplay and sense of humor, it is today considered a cult classic. This cult following, combined with the game&#x27;s character and humor, inspired parallel works.

It initially received mixed reviews upon release. Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; reviewed the game under its original Japanese title of &quot;Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari&quot; and gave it a generally positive review, stating that it is a fighting game which skillfully incorporates RPG elements, scoring it 28 out of 40. French magazine &quot;Player One&quot; reviewed the game under its European localised title of &quot;Street Gangs&quot; and gave it a highly positive review, concluding that it is not to be missed and scoring it 93%. UK television programme &quot;GamesMaster&quot; generally panned &quot;Street Gangs&quot;, with one reviewer saying he &quot;would rather sit in a vat of horse manure than play this game, give it to your worst enemies&quot;, with an overall score of 32%.

Retrospective reviews have been very positive. IGN said that the fighting mechanics are exceptionally achieved, and that the RPG-esque elements give the game a depth and replayability, ultimately scoring it 9 out of 10. In 2006, &quot;Play&quot; contributing editor Eric Patterson listed the game&#x27;s cover art, along with &quot;Groove on Fight&quot;, as his favorite game covers of all time. In 2008, Nintendo Life gave it 8 out of 10. EuroGamer gave it an 8 out of 10. In 2009, IGN ranked it the 15th best NES game in their Top 100 NES Games list. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked it the seventh best NES game ever made. The staff felt that it was more memorable than &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot;, &quot;Legend of Kage&quot;, and &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, and is still influential. In 2014, GamesRadar ranked it the eleventh best NES game of all time. In 2017, Paste ranked it 16th in their 100 Best NES Games list. Also in 2017, Polygon ranked it 461st in their 500 best games of all time list. In 2021, Retro Gamer included the game in their Top Ten NES Games list.

&quot;GameSpy&quot; gave the GBA version a score of 4/5, while &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave it 6.9.

==Legacy==
The Japanese version, &quot;Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari&quot;, was considered highly successful and would be followed by several spin-offs (including seven subsequent Famicom installments) until Technos Japan&#x27;s closure in 1996. Of these seven games, &quot;Downtown Special: Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki dayo Zen&#x27;in Shugo&quot; features the same gameplay system as &quot;Monogatari&quot;, with the main difference being that the characters are re-enacting a jidaigeki play.

In 1994, a prequel was released for the Super NES titled &quot;Shin Nekketsu Kōha: Kunio-tachi no Banka&quot;.

In 2002, an aspiring game designer, tester for Atari, and longtime fan of the game obtained the title&#x27;s trademark and began work on a sequel aptly titled &quot;River City Ransom 2&quot;. The project was halted when it was announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2003 that &quot;River City Ransom EX&quot; was to be released the following year. A true sequel to the game, , was developed by Miracle Kidz for a Japanese release on WiiWare in 2011. An online PC version was due out in 2012, but was put on hold due to an announcement that the developers were freezing development to focus on making completely original games.

In 2013, the Canadian independent developer, Conatus Creative, began development on an officially licensed follow-up game, named &quot;River City Ransom: Underground&quot;, originally scheduled for Windows in August 2014. In September, Conatus Creative launched a campaign on the crowdfunding site, Kickstarter, seeking CA$180,000 in funding for the game. They successfully reached their funding goal, ending it on October 9, having collected $217,643, approximately 120% of the original goal. After years of development and negotiations with Arc System Works (which, as Technōs Japan&#x27;s parent company, currently own the rights for the &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; franchise), the game was released on Steam for Windows, OS X and Linux on February 27, 2017.

&quot;River City: Tokyo Rumble&quot; was released for the Nintendo 3DS on August 8, 2013 in Japan, December 29, 2015 in Korea, and September 27, 2016 in the United States. &quot;River City Girls&quot;, which was being developed by Wayforward, was released on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PC on September 5, 2019.

Kunio, Riki, Gouda, and the Hattori Brothers make an appearance in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as fighting spirits.

<doc id="306467" wikidata="Q1110973" url="?curid=306467" title="Kununurra, Western Australia">
<text>Kununurra is a town in far northern Western Australia located at the eastern extremity of the Kimberley approximately from the border with the Northern Territory. Kununurra was initiated to service the Ord River Irrigation Scheme. It is located on the traditional lands of the Miriwoong, an Aboriginal Australian people.

Kununurra is the largest town in Western Australia north of Broome, with the closest town being Wyndham, away. Kununurra is from Perth via the Great Northern Highway.

The town is situated among the scenic hills and ranges of the far north-east Kimberley region, having an abundance of fresh water, conserved by the Ord River Diversion dam and the main Ord River Dam.

The tropical agriculture crops grown in the Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) have changed over the years. Tourism and mining have also become important to the local economy.

== History ==

The history of the idea of agriculture on the Ord River dates from the 19th century. On the first pastoral lease map (held by WA State Records Office) for the area dated 1887, it shows the northern bank between Wyndham and Kununurra, near House Roof Hill was held as a &quot;Concession for Sugar Cane Planting,&quot; although it was never taken up. The idea of tropical agriculture on the Ord was discussed much from the earliest dates, but the land remained under pastoral lease until 1960.
Kununurra was built on land resumed from Ivanhoe Station pastoral lease before 1961, as the town for the Ord River Irrigation Area which started as the Ord River Project or Ord Scheme, with survey work starting in 1959. Lake Kununurra is the flooded section of the Ord River valley that was formerly known as Carlton Reach, which was at times a waterhole held back by the natural rock barrier known as Bandicoot Bar. At this site in 1959 drilling and blasting marked the start of construction of the Ord River Diversion Dam, which is anchored down onto the Bandicoot Bar. This dam with twenty radial flood gates was almost completed when visited by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in March 1963, then later completed and officially opened by then Prime Minister, Robert Menzies on 20 July 1963 when he said that Kununurra and the Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) is &quot;... the most exciting place in Australia&quot;.

As well as the town site some ORIA farmers live on their farms; however the initial idea of the Ord Scheme was for &quot;closer settlement&quot; to allow farmers the convenience of living in the town and since the start of the first Pilot Farm in 1960 most farmers in the valley had lived in the town. However, many people now live on their irrigation farms. Other agricultural and residential localities exist within a radius of the town, including various Aboriginal Communities, Crossing Falls, the Riverfarm Road and Packsaddle farm areas, and the Frank Wise Institute of Tropical Agriculture, formerly known as the Kimberley Research Station (KRS). KRS started in 1945 from the original Carlton Reach Research Station, set up by Kimberley Michael Durack with help from his brother William Aiden Durack in 1941, and support from the WA Department of Agriculture and the WA Public Works Department, being the first serious attempt at tropical agriculture on the banks of the Ord River. It was also in 1941 that Russell Dumas inspected the Ord gorges for dam sites on behalf of the Public Works Department.

The scheme involved damming the Ord River by building the Ord River diversion dam so that the waters could be conserved and directed to irrigate about of land. By 1966, there were 31 farms on the Ord River plains. In 1968 the second stage of the scheme was started with the building of the Ord River Dam (or Ord River Main Dam), known locally as &quot;Top Dam,&quot; which holds back the waters of Lake Argyle.

Flooding of the Ord River continued until completion of the Main Ord River Dam situated upstream from Kununurra, which was started in 1968, and officially opened on 30 June 1972, with support from WA Premier John Tonkin, by then Prime Minister William McMahon, when he said &quot;This marks the beginning of Ord Stage II (Two).&quot; The Ord River Dam flooded the land of the Argyle Downs station, the home station of the pioneering Durack family, to form what has become known as Lake Argyle. Stone work from the original Argyle Downs homestead, was removed before Lake Argyle filled and was re-erected near the dam site to become the Argyle Downs Homestead Museum. The Museum had been run by Tourism WA but was taken on by the Kununurra Visitor Centre during 2010.

The second stage of the Ord Project still has not been fully developed but new work is underway. In May 2010, with major funding from the Federal Government, the extension of the main channel construction got underway under the Moonamang Joint Venture.

Kununurra post office opened on 1 September 1960.

==Etymology==
The name Kununurra is derived from the English pronunciation of the word (alternatively ) which in the Miriwoong language means &quot;river&quot;. It is a widespread myth that it means &#x27;(Meeting of) Big Waters&#x27; or &#x27;Big River&#x27;. One also finds accounts of the name of Kununurra which state that it was the Miriwoong name for this part of the Ord River, which makes sense in that the Ord River runs for hundreds of kilometres coming from the south near Hall&#x27;s Creek. It is stated to be likely that other parts of the Ord River were known by other Aboriginal language names, by the various tribal language group areas, over which the river traverses.

A 1943 soil classification had named the volcanic clay known locally as &quot;blacksoil&quot;, being the predominant soil type of the irrigation area, as &quot;Cununurra Clay&quot; and &quot;Cununurra&quot; was put forward as a possible name, among others in 1960. The General Post Office (GPO) representative from WA on the Nomenclature Committee, objected saying that Cununurra was too close in name to the town of Cunnamulla and that could cause postal confusion. A compromise was reached and &quot;K&quot; was used with an argument having been put forward that this would bring it into line with other East Kimberley placenames, such as Kalumburu, and Karunjie. The name was only finally decided just days before the newest town of the Kimberley region, being gazetted on 10 February 1961.

==Population==
Kununurra has a transient population; if itinerant residents, the outlying farm areas and communities were included in census population figures, it is estimated numbers would have exceeded 7,000 for 2006, as opposed to the actual figure of 5,619. An influx in the dry season (from April to September) of tourists and itinerant farm workers can push up the population to around 10,000.

According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 5,308 people in Kununurra.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 22.9% of the population. 
* 71.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.6% and New Zealand 2.1%.
* 76.4% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Miriwoong 2.2%. 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 38.8% and Catholic 19.0%.

==Geography==
The landscape surrounding Kununurra includes features such as Valentine Spring, Black Rock Creek and Middle Springs along with many other waterfalls and swimming holes. Popular fishing spots include Ivanhoe Crossing, The Diversion Dam, Buttons Crossing, and various locations along the Dunham and Ord Rivers.

The town is located close to the confluence of the Ord and the Dunham River. Lake Argyle, Australia&#x27;s largest artificial lake, over in size, is by road from the town, being held back by the main Ord River Dam.

The town lies within the Ord Irrigation Area Important Bird Area (IBA), so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance for wild birds, especially estrildid finches.

===Climate===
Like other areas in the tropics of Western Australia, Kununurra experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;) with distinct wet and dry seasons; it borders closely on the tropical savanna climate (Aw). The average annual rainfall is around .

The dry season from April to September is the most popular time to visit: heat and humidity are lower, and road and park accessibility at their best. In the town&#x27;s 53 years of weather records, rainfall of over has never been recorded in August, with most Augusts being completely rainless.

The build-up season from October to December is characterised by high heat and humidity. The oppressive conditions of the build-up often give way to spectacular electrical storms, along with dramatic lightning displays over the rugged Kimberley landscape. Such storms however bring little rain, and the lightning will often start bushfires in the surrounding scrub.

The summer monsoon period between January and March often causes accessibility issues, and the closure of many roads and national parks, due to heavy rain. Days are overcast and hot; heavy downpours are a frequent occurrence.


== Agriculture ==

Key farm activities include the growing of melons, mangoes and until recently, sugar cane. Farmers are now turning to a more lucrative (though longer term) crop of Indian sandalwood. Other crops that have been grown in the Ord are cotton, safflower and rice, which is being trialled once again, having been the first crop planted on the Pilot Farm in 1960. The town has a melon picking season, which attracts migratory farm workers to the area. There is also a thriving tourism industry with most tourist operators capitalising on the scenery of the Ord River, Lake Argyle, Diversion Dam and other local locations, including the relatively nearby Bungle Bungle Range.

==Media==
Since 1980 Kununurra has been the base of the &quot;Kimberley Echo&quot; founded by the late James O&#x27;Kenny and Brian Cole. Radio station 6WR broadcasts across the Kimberley area from Kununurra on 693 AM, 101.1 FM, 101.3 FM, 102.1 FM, and 104.3 FM. 6WR also streams live online, and is available via the &#x27;VAST&#x27; service to remote and blackspot areas of Australia on the Optus C1 satellite. Reach Beyond Australia broadcasts via shortwave from Kununurra between 9.7 and 15.3 MHz with evening releases in English and many Asian languages.

==Culture, recreation, and tourism==
The town has many local attractions, including waterfalls, gorges, and ranges.

===Jirrawun Arts===
Jirrawun Arts was an Indigenous Australian art centre, established in 1998 in Kununurra before moving to Wyndham in 2006. It was notable as the base for contemporary Indigenous Australian artists of the eastern Kimberley region, including Paddy Bedford and Freddie Timms. It closed in 2010. Their art was exhibited in exhibitions in Melbourne and elsewhere.

===Waringarri Aboriginal Arts===
Waringarri Aboriginal Arts is an Aboriginal art centre that celebrates the art and culture of the Miriwoong people. It was established in the 1980s, and became the first wholly Indigenous-owned art centre in Western Australia. It is also one of the oldest continuously operating art centres in Australia. The centre was refurbished in 2011.

Within the centre, there are artists&#x27; studios and galleries, in which artworks are for sale, and cultural tours and performances are available for visitors. These activities help to provide economic independence for artists and their community. Waringarri supports over 100 artists, including painters, printmakers, wood carvers, boab engravers, sculptors, and textile artists.

==Transport==
East Kimberley Regional Airport, commonly referred to as Kununurra Airport, is located west of the town centre. Heavy wet seasons often result in this area being cut off from essential outside services and deliveries. The airport is a crucial piece of infrastructure which enables people and goods to enter or leave from the region and especially supports tourism and economic development. 

==Facilities==
The town has many local attractions, including waterfalls, gorges, and ranges.
===Legal===
The Kununurra Courthouse, which includes a magistrate and a jury courtroom, was opened on 26 October 2014. It was designed by TAG Architects and Iredale Pedersen Hook Architects. The paintings of the Aboriginal artists from Miriwoong country were included in the design of the building.

===Education===
East Kimberley College has a student population of just over 900 ranging from kindergarten to year 12. St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School and Ngalangangpum School are two Catholic schools. There is limited tertiary education available via a Western Australia North Regional Technical and further education (TAFE) campus.

===Health===
Kununurra District Hospital houses 32 beds and a 10-bed aged care facility. There are dental practices in the town.

===Community===
The Kununurra Leisure Centre is a multi-purpose, community recreation facility catering for a wide range of sports, recreation activities and social functions. It includes a pool.

Kununurra Neighbourhood House is a not-for-profit community centre that provides various services and activities for the residents of Kununurra. Some of the services offered by Kununurra Neighbourhood House include family support, playgroups, parenting programs, emergency relief, referrals and advocacy. The centre also hosts events such as markets, workshops, festivals and fundraisers. Kununurra Neighbourhood House is open to the community between 8 am and 1 pm Monday to Friday.

Kununurra Youth Hub is run by Police Citizens Youth Club (PCYC) to the community between 8 am and 5 pm daily.

== In popular culture ==
Kununurra has a Celebrity Tree Park with many trees planted by famous people, Baz Luhrmann, signed after the majority of the filming for his 2008 film &quot;Australia&quot; was conducted just outside Kununurra. Nicole Kidman thought that the area&#x27;s water helped her get pregnant while filming in this town, stating &quot;seven babies were conceived out of this film and only one was a boy. There is something up there in the Kununurra water because we all went swimming in the waterfalls, so we can call it the fertility waters now.&quot;

It was voted the second best town to live in Australia for outdoor adventure by &quot;Outdoor Australia&quot; magazine in the March/April 2007 edition.

<doc id="306470" wikidata="Q1800173" url="?curid=306470" title="Secret of Mana">
<text>Secret of Mana, originally released in Japan as is a 1993 action role-playing game developed and published by Square for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the sequel to the 1991 game &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot;, released in North America as &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; and in Europe as &quot;Mystic Quest&quot;, and it was the first &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot; title to be marketed as part of the &quot;Mana&quot; series rather than the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows three heroes as they attempt to prevent an empire from conquering the world with the power of an ancient flying fortress.

Rather than using a turn-based battle system like contemporaneous role-playing games, &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; features real-time battles with a power bar mechanic. The game has a unique Ring Command menu system, which pauses the action and allows the player to make decisions in the middle of battle. An innovative cooperative multiplayer system allows a second or third player to drop in and out of the game at any time. &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli, and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka.

The game received acclaim for its brightly colored graphics, expansive plot, Ring Command menu system, and innovative real-time battle system. Critics also praised Hiroki Kikuta&#x27;s soundtrack and the customizable artificial intelligence (AI) settings for computer-controlled allies. Retrospectively, it has been considered one of the greatest games of all time by critics. It was re-released on Virtual Console on the Wii in 2008 and Wii U in 2013, on multiple mobile platforms (as an enhanced version) between 2009 and 2019, on Switch as part of &quot;Collection of Mana&quot; in 2017 and 2019, and was remade in 3D in 2018 for PlayStation 4, Vita and Windows. The remake saw mixed reviews, with many faulting its lack of game play improvements and reworked graphics.

==Gameplay==
Like many other role-playing games of the 16-bit era, &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; displays a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The game features three such characters: the hero, the girl, and the sprite, named Randi, Primm, and Popoi outside the initial North American and European releases. The player can choose to control each of the characters at any time; whichever character is currently selected, the other two companions are controlled via artificial intelligence. The game may be played simultaneously by up to three players, made possible by the Super Multitap accessory for the Super NES console. The Virtual Console version of the game supports three-player gameplay via additional GameCube controllers or Classic Controllers.

Each character possesses individual strengths and weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters weapons at a quicker rate; the girl is a healer, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves in areas such as strength and evasion. The trio can rest in towns, where they can regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game&#x27;s Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The game is momentarily paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.

Combat takes place in real-time. Located at the bottom of the screen is a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, allowing that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.

In order to learn magic, the party must rescue spirits known as Elementals. The eight Elementals represent different elements—such as water, earth, and life—and each provides the player with specific spells. Magic has skill levels similar to weapons, but each magic spell costs magic points to cast.

At the start of the game, to reach a destination, players must traverse an enemy-infested countryside. Travel may be expedited with Cannon Travel Centers, where the party may be launched to faraway destinations via a giant cannon. Cannon Travel usually requires a fee, but is mandatory to visit other continents later on. Later, the party is given access to Flammie, a miniature dragon which is controlled by the player and able to fly freely across the world, represented by an overworld map. These sequences make use of the SNES&#x27;s Mode 7 capability to create a rotatable background, giving the illusion that the ground beneath Flammie is rendered in three dimensions. While riding Flammie, the player may access either the &quot;rotated map&quot;, which presents the world as a globe, or the &quot;world map&quot;, a two-dimensional view of the overworld.

==Plot==
===Setting and characters===
The story takes place in a high fantasy world, which contains an ethereal energy source named &quot;mana&quot;. An ancient, technologically advanced civilization exploited mana to construct the &quot;Mana Fortress&quot;, a flying warship. This angered the world&#x27;s gods, who sent giant beasts to war with the civilization. The conflict was globally destructive and nearly exhausted all signs of mana in the world, until a hero used the power of the Mana Sword to destroy the fortress and the civilization. The world began to recover in peace. As the game opens, an empire seeks eight Mana Seeds, which when &quot;unsealed&quot; will restore mana to the world and allow the empire to restore the Mana Fortress.

The three main characters do not have names in the original SNES release, though their names appear in the manual of the Japanese release; their names were added into the game in the iOS port worldwide. In all versions, the player can choose to name the characters whatever they wish. The , a young boy, is adopted by the Elder of Potos before the start of the game, after the boy&#x27;s mother disappears. The is in love with a warrior named Dyluck, who was ordered by the king to attack Elinee&#x27;s Castle. Angered by the king&#x27;s actions and by her father&#x27;s attempt to arrange her marriage to a local nobleman, she leaves the castle to save Dyluck and to accompany the hero as well. The hero meets a at the Dwarf Village. The sprite lives with a dwarf and goes with the characters to learn more about their family. It does not remember anything about its past, so it joins the team to try to recover its memories.

=== Story ===
The game begins as three boys from the small Potos village disobey their Elder&#x27;s instructions and trespass into a local waterfall, where a treasure is said to be kept. One of the boys stumbles and falls into the lake, where he finds a rusty sword embedded in a stone. Guided by a disembodied voice, he pulls the sword free, inadvertently unleashing monsters in the surrounding countryside of the village. The villagers interpret the sword&#x27;s removal as a bad omen and banish the boy from Potos forever. A traveling knight named Jema recognizes the blade as the legendary Mana Sword and encourages the hero to re-energize it by visiting the eight Mana Temples.

During his journey, the hero is joined by the girl and the sprite. Throughout their travels, the trio is pursued by the Empire. The Emperor and his subordinates are being manipulated by Thanatos, an ancient sorcerer who hopes to create a &quot;new, peaceful world&quot;. Due to his own body&#x27;s deterioration, Thanatos is in need of a suitable body to possess. After placing the entire kingdom of Pandora under a trance, he abducts two candidates: Dyluck, now enslaved, and a young Pandoran girl named Phanna; he eventually chooses to possess Dyluck.

The Empire succeeds in unsealing all eight Mana Seeds. However, Thanatos betrays the Emperor and his henchmen, killing them and seizing control of the Mana Fortress for himself. The hero and his party journey to locate the Mana Tree, the focal point of the world&#x27;s life energy. Anticipating their arrival, Thanatos positions the Mana Fortress over the Tree and destroys it. The charred remains of the Tree speak to the heroes, explaining that a giant dragon called the Mana Beast will soon be summoned to combat the Fortress. The Beast has little control over its rage and will likely destroy the world as well. The Mana Tree also reveals that it was once the human wife of Serin, the original Mana Knight and the hero&#x27;s father. The voice heard at Potos&#x27; waterfall was that of Serin&#x27;s ghost.

The trio flies to the Mana Fortress and confronts Thanatos, who is preparing to transfer his mind into Dyluck. With the last of his strength, Dyluck warns that Thanatos has sold his soul to the underworld and must not be allowed to have the Fortress. Dyluck kills himself, forcing Thanatos to revert to a skeletal lich form, which the party defeats. 

The Mana Beast finally flies in and attacks the Fortress. The hero expresses reluctance to kill the Beast, fearing that with the dispersal of Mana from the world, the sprite will vanish. With the sprite&#x27;s encouragement, he uses the fully energized Mana Sword to slay the Beast, causing it to explode and transform into snow. At the conclusion of the game, the sprite child vanishes into an astral plane, the girl is returned home and the hero is seen welcomed back in Potos, returning the Mana Sword to its place beneath the waterfall.

==Development==
&quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, the creator of the game&#x27;s Game Boy predecessor, &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;. He has stated that he feels &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; is more &quot;his game&quot; than other projects he has worked on, such as the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. The game was programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka. The team hoped to build on the foundation of &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;, and they included several modified elements from that game and from other popular Square titles in &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;. In addition to having better graphics and sound quality than its predecessor, the attack power gauge was changed to be more engaging, and the weapon leveling system replaced &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;″s system of leveling up the speed of the attack gauge. The party system also received an upgrade from the first &quot;Mana&quot; game: instead of temporary companions who could not be upgraded, party members became permanent protagonists and could be controlled by other players. The multiplayer component was not a part of the original design, but was added when the developers realized that they could easily make all three characters human-controlled.

The real-time battle system used in &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; has been described by its creators as an extension of the battle system used in the first three flagship &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles. The system for experience points and leveling up was taken from &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;. According to Tanaka, the game&#x27;s battle system features mechanics that had first been considered for &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. Similarly, unused features in &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; were appropriated by the &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; team, which (like &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;) was in production at the time. According to Tanaka, the project was originally intended to be &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, with a &quot;more action-based, dynamic overworld&quot;. However, it &quot;wound up not being&quot; &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; anymore, but instead became a separate project codenamed &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; during development, before finally becoming &quot;Seiken Densetsu 2&quot;. Tanaka said that it &quot;always felt like a sequel&quot; to &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; for him.

&quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was originally planned to be a launch title for the SNES-CD add-on. After the contract between Nintendo and Sony to produce the add-on failed, and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES-CD into the competing PlayStation console, Square adapted the game for the SNES cartridge format. The game had to be altered to fit the storage space of a SNES game cartridge, which is much smaller than that of a CD-ROM. The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add-on, believing that too much of the game would have to be cut, but they were overruled by company management. As a result of the hardware change, several features had to be cut from the game, and some completed work needed to be redone. One of the most significant changes was the removal of the option to take multiple routes through the game that led to several possible endings, in contrast to the linear journey in the final product. The plot that remained was different from the original conception, and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone. Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the space limitations, and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game.

===Music===

The original score for &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was composed and produced by Hiroki Kikuta. Kenji Ito, who had composed the soundtrack for &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;, was originally slated for the project, but was replaced with Kikuta after he had started on other projects, such as &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot;. &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was Kikuta&#x27;s first video game score, and he encountered difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations of the Super NES. Kikuta tried to express in the music two &quot;contrasting styles&quot; to create an original score which would be neither pop music nor standard game music. Kikuta worked on the music mostly by himself, spending nearly 24 hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, &quot;immersive&quot; and &quot;three-dimensional&quot;. Rather than having sound engineers create the samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super NES. These custom samples allowed him to know exactly how each piece would sound on the system&#x27;s hardware, so he did not have to worry about differences between the original composition and the Super NES. Kikuta stated in 2001 that he considered the score for &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; his favorite creation.

The soundtrack&#x27;s music includes both &quot;ominous&quot; and &quot;light-hearted&quot; tracks, and is noted for its use of bells and &quot;dark, solemn pianos&quot;. Kikuta&#x27;s compositions for the game were partly inspired by natural landscapes, as well as music from Bali. Hardware limitations made the title screen to the game slowly fade in, and Kikuta designed the title track to the game, &quot;Fear of the Heavens&quot;, to sync up with the screen. At that time, composers rarely tried to match a game&#x27;s music to its visuals. Kikuta also started the track off with a &quot;whale noise&quot;, rather than a traditional &quot;ping&quot;, in order to try to &quot;more deeply connect&quot; the player with the game from the moment it started up. Getting the sound to work with the memory limitations of the Super NES was a difficult technical challenge.

An official soundtrack album, &quot;Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version&quot;, was released in Japan in August 1993, containing 44 musical tracks from the game. An English version, identical to the Japanese original aside from its localized packaging and track titles, was later released in North America in December 1994 as &quot;Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack&quot;, making &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; one of the first Japanese games to inspire a localized soundtrack release outside of Japan. An album of arranged music from &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and its sequel &quot;Seiken Densetsu 3&quot; was produced in 1993 as &quot;Secret of Mana+&quot;. The music in the album was all composed and arranged by Kikuta. &quot;Secret of Mana+&quot; contains a single track, titled &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, that incorporates themes from the music of both &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Seiken Densetsu 3&quot;, which was still under development at the time. The style of the album has been described by critics as &quot;experimental&quot;, using &quot;strange sounds&quot; such as waterfalls, bird calls, cell phone sounds, and &quot;typing&quot; sounds. The music has also been described by critics as covering many different musical styles, such as &quot;Debussian impressionist styles, his own heavy electronic and synth ideas, and even ideas of popular musicians&quot;. The latest album of music from the game is a 2012 arranged album titled &quot;Secret of Mana Genesis / Seiken Densetsu 2 Arrange Album&quot;. The 16 tracks are upgraded versions of the original Super NES tracks, and Kikuta said in the liner notes for the album that they are &quot;how he wanted the music to sound when he wrote it&quot;, without the limitations of the Super NES hardware. Critics such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan, however, noted that the differences were minor. A rendition of the soundtrack was commissioned for the first ever BBC Proms gaming music concert in 2022.

==Release==
&quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was announced as being released in July 1993 as recently as that April, marketed as a &quot;Party Action RPG&quot;, before eventually being released in August instead for the Japanese market. In South Korea, it was released the same month in August 1993. The English translation for &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was completed in only 30 days, mere weeks after the Japanese release, and the North American localization was initially advertised as &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure 2&quot;. Critics have suggested that the translation was done hastily so that the game could be released in North America for the 1993 holiday season. According to translator Ted Woolsey, a large portion of the game&#x27;s script was cut out in the English localization due to space limitations. To display text on the main gameplay screen, the English translation uses a fixed-width font, which limits the amount of space available to display text. Woolsey was unhappy that he had to trim conversations to their bare essentials and that he had so little time for translation, commenting that it &quot;nearly killed me&quot;. The script was difficult to translate as it was presented to Woolsey in disordered groups of text, like &quot;shuffling a novel&quot;. Other localizations were done in German and French. The Japanese release only named the three protagonists in the manual, while Western versions omitted the characters&#x27; names until the enhanced port on the iOS. The game released in Europe on November 25, 1994.

In 1999, Square announced they would be porting &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; to Bandai&#x27;s handheld system WonderSwan Color as one of nine planned games for the system. No such port was ever released. The game was released on Virtual Console on the Wii in 2008 and on Wii U, only in Japan, in 2013. A mobile phone port of &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was released on October 26, 2009. A port of the game for iOS was revealed at E3 2010, and released on Apple&#x27;s App Store on December 21, 2010. The port fixed several bugs, and the English script was both edited and retranslated from the original Japanese. The enhanced port from the iOS version was released on Android devices in 2014. A port for the Nintendo Switch was released with ports of &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; and &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; as part of the &quot;Collection of Mana&quot; on June 1, 2017, in Japan, and June 11, 2019 in the rest of the world. The game was released as one of the games included on the Super NES Classic Edition on September 29, 2017. 

===3D remake===
In August 2017, a 3D remake of the game was announced for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Windows and was released on February 15, 2018. The remake was developed by Q Studios for Square Enix. The project began in 2016 following positive feedback from &quot;Adventures of Mana&quot;, a remake of the original &quot;Mana&quot; game. The remake&#x27;s gameplay was described as &quot;basically the same&quot; as the original, although it was redone using 3D graphics and some features were added for convenience such as an area map, increased game save opportunities, improved companion AI, and voice acting. The offline multiplayer function was carried over into the different versions. The character art was redesigned by Haccan, an artist who had worked on &quot;Adventures of Mana&quot;. Kikuta returned to supervise new arrangements of his music, bringing in a number of other composers he knew who were fans of &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;. He described his approach as composing an &quot;adult&quot; version of the original tracks. At the request of the series producer, the main theme &quot;Angel&#x27;s Fear&quot; was recorded with a full orchestra. The arranges included as Yuzo Koshiro and Tsuyoshi Sekito. The soundtrack was released as an album, also titled &quot;Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack&quot;, shortly after the remake&#x27;s release in February 2018.

==Reception==
===Sales===
The initial shipment of games in Japan sold out within days of the release date. &quot;Dengeki Oh&quot; magazine ranked it the second best-selling video game of 1993 in Japan, where units were sold that year, just below &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;. In South Korea, it was the top-selling game from November to December 1993.

&quot;Edge&quot; reported in November 1993 that the game was &quot;the most widely covered game of the year in Japan&quot; with a high number of sales, but was initially released in North America &quot;completely un-hyped and mostly unheard of&quot;. Despite this, &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; went on to become the second top-selling Super NES game on the monthly US Babbage&#x27;s chart in October 1993, below only &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, with &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; remaining in the US top ten SNES game charts for a year up until October 1994. It was also a success in Europe, where the game introduced many players to console role-playing games. In the United Kingdom, it was the fourth top-selling game in November 1994, and the second top-selling SNES game that month (below &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;).

According to &quot;Next Generation&quot; magazine, it was surprisingly popular for a role-playing game, contributing to the genre&#x27;s growing popularity in the West. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reported in 1996 that the game had sold more than 500,000 copies in the United States alone. According to Square Enix, &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; had shipped copies worldwide as of 2003, with shipped in Japan and 330,000 abroad.

===Contemporary reviews===

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; magazine&#x27;s reviewers heavily praised the graphics, music, and multiplayer gameplay, saying that it had &quot;some of the best music I&#x27;ve ever heard from a cartridge&quot;. They hoped that other companies would take the game&#x27;s lead in adding multiplayer modes to role-playing games. &quot;Diehard GameFan&quot;″s review of the game named the multiplayer as the game&#x27;s best component, with reviewer Kelly Rickards saying that while the graphics were nice, the multiplayer &quot;made the game&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s review praised the graphics, plot, &quot;first-rate gameplay&quot; and &quot;positively massive&quot; world &quot;dwarfing even &quot;Zelda&quot;&quot;, while stating the gameplay and multiplayer were &quot;rough around the edges&quot;, concluding it to be &quot;one of the finest action/RPGs&quot; on the SNES. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; called it an &quot;enthralling epic&quot;, praising the &quot;wide variety of sites and terrain&quot;, music, &quot;Beautiful graphics and great depth of play&quot; but criticizing the &quot;unnecessarily long&quot; sword powering-up and &quot;awkward&quot; item selection method. &quot;SNES Force&quot; magazine praised the game&#x27;s &quot;superb&quot; graphics, &quot;fantastic&quot; sounds and &quot;revolutionary three-player mode&quot;.

&quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was awarded Game of the Month in December 1993 and Best Role-Playing Game of 1993 by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. In its annual Megawards, &quot;GameFan&quot; awarded it Best Action/RPG (SNES). &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it the award for Role-Playing Game of the Year, ahead of &quot;Lufia&quot; and &quot;Shadowrun&quot; as runners-up.

&quot;Edge&quot;″s review said that &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was better than contemporary role-playing games &quot;Ys I &amp; II&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The review stated that &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; &quot;includes some of the best game design and features ever seen: simultaneous three-player action, the best combat system ever designed, the best player interface ever designed, a superb control system, and yes, some of the most engrossing and rewarding gameplay yet&quot;. They concluded that the game was one of the best action RPGs or adventure games. Game designer Sandy Petersen reviewed the game in &quot;Dragon&quot;, and described the game as much like &quot;Zelda&quot; but with conventional role-playing game features. He predicted that the game would be regarded as a classic. Peterson concluded that &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was one of the best SNES role-playing games and that it was &quot;a much larger game than &quot;Zelda&quot;, with many more types of monsters, character options, and fortresses to explore&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot; also compared it favorably with &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;; one reviewer stated that &quot;even the magnificence of &quot;Zelda III&quot; seems stale in comparison to the incredible features found within this refreshing, exhilarating adventure&quot; while the other stated that it &quot;comes the closest yet&quot; to surpassing &quot;Zelda&quot;, concluding that &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was &quot;one of the greatest graphical RPGs in the history of the world&quot;.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; said in 1994 that &quot;Mana&quot; was &quot;doing for adventure games now what Zelda did several years ago&quot; and that &quot;Mana&quot; is &quot;one of the best games for the SNES this year and more playable than&quot; &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said in 1996 that many players considered it &quot;the RPG equivalent of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.&quot;

===Later reviews===

In 2008, Lucas Thomas of IGN reviewed the Virtual Console release of &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and stated that it was considered one of the best video games ever made. Eurogamer&#x27;s Dan Whitehead described it as &quot;essential&quot; and as the formative game of the &quot;Mana&quot; series. The iOS version of the game was praised by Nadia Oxford of Slide to Play for its improved graphics and computer-controlled characters. She also praised the quality of the touch controls relative to other role-playing game phone versions, though she disliked that the multiplayer mode had been removed. In 2014, &quot;Edge&quot; magazine described &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; as &quot;one of the high points of the 16bit era&quot;. A writer for the magazine noted that, 20 years after &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;″s release, its reputation as a SNES action RPG had been surpassed only by that of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;.

The 2018 remake saw &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews according to review aggregation website &quot;Metacritic&quot;, with the PS4 version scoring 63 out of 100 based on 60 reviews, while the PC version was scored 57 out of 100 based on six reviews. &quot;RPG Site&quot; Zack Reese positively noted the attempts to modernise the gameplay while remaining faithful to the original, but felt people were better off playing the original due to its 3D presentation and lack of additional gameplay improvements. Meghan Sullvan of &quot;IGN&quot; described the game as &quot;a charming but clumsy 20ish-hour adventure that both frustrates and delights&quot;, praising the artstyle but faulting a lack of improvements over the original. &quot;Game Informer&quot; Kimberley Wallace did enjoy her time with the game but felt some of the adjustments did not improve the gameplay, further faulting poor voice acting and uneven musical remixes. Jeremy Parish, writing for &quot;Polygon&quot;, felt the remake compared poorly to the original&#x27;s recent ports on Nintendo platforms, finding issues with its 3D redesign and repetitive character conversations. Chris Schilling of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; was particularly critical, saying the original appeared much smoother by comparison, disliking the new 3D graphics and faulting lack of noticeable adjustments to the pacing and difficulty.

===Impact===
&quot;Secret of Mana&quot; has placed on numerous top game lists since its release, and is the 13th highest-rate SNES game on aggregator website GameRankings. In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; rated &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; 12th on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time,&quot; with &quot;Super Play&quot; ranked it eighth on its list of the best 100 SNES games of all time the following year. It has continued to be placed on &quot;best of&quot; lists of SNES games, games for Nintendo consoles, or role-playing ever since, including ones by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Famitsu&quot;, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;, &quot;Game Informer&quot;, &quot;1Up.com&quot;, &quot;Polygon&quot;, and &quot;Time Extension&quot;, as recently as 2023.

In 2006, &quot;Level&quot; magazine claimed that &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;″s rocky development was Square&#x27;s main inspiration to move their games, such as the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, from Nintendo consoles to Sony consoles in 1996.

&quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was an influential game in its time, and its influence continued into the 2010s. Elements such as its radial ring menu system, described by &quot;Edge&quot; as &quot;oft-mimicked&quot;, were borrowed by later games such as &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;. Its cooperative multiplayer gameplay has been mentioned as an influence on &quot;Dungeon Siege III&quot;.

<text>The , also known as or 
(all meaning &quot;three strings&quot;), is a three-stringed traditional Japanese musical instrument derived from the Chinese instrument . It is played with a plectrum called a bachi.

The Japanese pronunciation is usually but sometimes when used as a suffix, according to regular sound change (e.g. ). In Western Japanese dialects and several Edo period sources, it is both written and pronounced as .

The construction of the varies in shape, depending on the genre in which it is used. The instrument used to accompany kabuki has a thin neck, facilitating the agile and virtuosic requirements of that genre. The one used to accompany puppet plays and folk songs has a longer and thicker neck instead, to match the more robust music of those genres.

==Construction==

The is a plucked stringed instrument. Its construction follows a model similar to that of a guitar or a banjo, with a neck and strings stretched across a resonating body. The neck of the is fretless and slimmer than that of a guitar or banjo. The body, called the , resembles a drum, having a hollow body that is covered front and back with skin, in the manner of a banjo. The skin used depends on the genre of music and the skill of the player. Traditionally, skins were made using dog or cat skin, with cat skin favored for finer instruments; though use of animal skins was common throughout the 20th century, use of these skins gradually fell out of favor, starting around the mid 2000s, due to social stigma and the decline of workers skilled in preparing these particular skins. Contemporary skins are often prepared with synthetic materials, such as plastic.

The , or neck of the , is usually divided into three or four pieces that fit and lock together, with most made to be easily disassembled. The neck of the is a singular rod that crosses the drum-like body of the instrument, partially protruding at the other side of the body and acting as an anchor for the strings. The pegs used to wind the strings are long, thin and hexagonal in shape; though they were traditionally fashioned out of ivory, due to scarcity and trading regulations regarding and constricting the sale of ivory, many are now constructed from other materials, such as wood and plastic.

The three strings of the shamisen are made of either silk (traditionally) or nylon. They are stretched between the pegs at the head of the instrument, and a cloth tailpiece anchored at the end of the rod which protrudes on the other side of the body. The strings are stretched across the body, raised from it by means of a bridge, or , which rests directly on the taut skin. The lowest string is purposefully laid lower at the nut of the instrument in order to create a buzz, a characteristic timbre known as (somewhat reminiscent of the &quot;buzzing&quot; of a sitar, which is called &quot;Jivari&quot;). The upper side of the (when on the player&#x27;s lap) is almost always protected by a cover known as a , and players often wear a little band of cloth on their left hand to facilitate sliding up and down the neck, known as a . The head of the instrument known as a may also be protected by a cover. The material of the strings will depend on the skill of the player. Traditionally, silk strings are used. However, silk breaks easily over a short time, so this is reserved for professional performances. Students often use nylon or &#x27;tetron&#x27; strings, which last longer than silk, and are also less expensive.

===Variations in construction and playing method===

The construction of the varies in shape and size, depending on the genre in which it is used. The used will also be different according to genre, if it is used at all. are classified according to size and genre. There are three basic sizes: , and . Examples of genres include , , , , , , , , and .

 used for traditional genres of Japanese music, such as , , and , adhere to very strict standards. Purists of these genres demand that the be made of the correct wood, the correct skin, and are played with the correct , with little room for variation. The , on the other hand, has lent itself to modern use, and is used in modern genres such as jazz and rock. As a more open instrument, variations of it exist for show. The tuning pegs, which are usually fashioned out of ivory, and which are fashioned from a combination of ivory and tortoise-shell for example, are sometimes made of acrylic material to give the a more modern, flashy look. Recently, avant-garde inventors have developed a with electric pickups to be used with amplifiers, like the electric guitar.
The , as its Japanese name implies, is the smallest kind of . The body is small and particularly square-shaped, with a particularly thin neck, which tapers away from the strings just as it approaches the body. Generally, the is used in , the shorter and thinner neck facilitating the agile and virtuosic requirements of kabuki. built especially for ensembles are often simply known as . The is also often used in , where it is plucked with the fingernails.
The is a size up from the . As its name implies, the neck is slightly thicker. As the neck approaches the body of the instrument, the distance between the strings and the fingerboard is maintained, unlike the , where it tapers off. The fingerboard ends abruptly, and the rest of the neck curves sharply into the body of the instrument. The pronounced curve that occurs just before the neck meets the body is called . The result is an extended fingerboard that gives the a higher register than the . The is favored for -style playing, with a broader, more mellow timbre. It is also an &quot;all-round&quot; instrument that can be used across many genres.
The is used in the robust music of (the music of ), , and . In these genres, a thicker neck facilitates the greater force used in playing the music of these styles. The of is quite a recent innovation, and is purposefully constructed in a much larger size than traditional style , and its neck is much longer and thicker than the traditional or .
The is a particularly fashioned for the performance of the song , a folk tune originating from Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture. The neck of the is about half the length of most , giving the instrument the high range needed to play . The use of more typical is possible, but they must be properly adjusted with a capo device to raise their pitch to make them suitable for use. Today the strings are made out of steel to make a better sound and the drum heads are made out of plastic to avoid breakage in a performance.

====Variations in ====
The , the plectrum used to play the , also differ in size, shape, and material from genre to genre.

The used for can be made out of three possible materials: wood, plastic, or ivory. While many teachers generally do not approve of the use of plastic, if ivory is unattainable and wood is still out of price range, plastic is considered acceptable for use.

 are made entirely out of plastic or ivory, plastic and tortoiseshell (), or ivory and tortoiseshell. are the easiest to identify as they are the longest, the widest, and also have a deep indentation where the tortoiseshell meets the handle. There are sometimes also that are made with a buffalo horn handle. The material, however, makes no difference in the sound.

The style uses the heaviest and thickest , though the is wider.

The used for is the smallest, and is almost always tipped with tortoiseshell.
====Other structural variations====
The , or bridge, can be fashioned out of aged bamboo, ivory, ox-bone (), rosewood, buffalo horn, wood, any combination of the above, or plastic for the student level. come in many heights. The higher the , the louder the sound will be, and the harder it is to control a rapid . Higher are not considered suitable for beginners.
The used for use a height between 3.2 and 3.6. for are fashioned out of only three materials: ivory, bone, and plastic. Ivory is the most expensive and produces the most desirable sound and amplification, but due to its high price tag is normally only used in performances. Ox-bone or is the most popular material for practice and with students who are performing. Because of ivory&#x27;s volume and vibration, it is normally used by a teacher or (lead ), so that the other players can follow their tone and signals. Plastic are increasingly harder in the modern day, as the material is considered to produce an undesirable sound when compared to . is not much more expensive than plastic, and most teachers openly express their displeasure with plastic and require .

The used for vary between 2.6 and 2.8, though other heights can be specially ordered. for are made out of a few select materials, such as yellow or black water buffalo horn (), which are the standard for . Blackwater buffalo horn does not have a significant sound difference when cut in the style, and is far less popular. Yellow is the most widely used for -style , both in practice and performance. Plastic is available because of the higher price tag of . Many people believe that for , there is not a great sound difference between the two, but there is a high change in vibration. Plastic makes a deader sound, which is not the most favorable for . is used from time to time in practice, but never for performances.

 used for both and are typically 2.6 in height, though sometimes 2.7 or 2.8. are very easily identifiable due to their unique structure and use of two different materials. are very thin in width, and are not very high. The base is usually made of either bamboo, smoked bamboo, or a wood of some kind, while the top half in which the strings pass through can be made of ivory, bone, or tortoiseshell. Because of the thickness of both the strings and neck of the , the bridge in general tends to be longer than the others. Both the (the highest made, fashioned out of black buffalo horn) and the (which resembles the exactly, save for its width) are sometimes confused with the .

==Variations in playing==

In most genres, the strings are plucked with a . The sound of a is similar in some respects to that of the American banjo, in that the drum-like , amplifies the sound of the strings. As in the clawhammer style of American banjo playing, the is often used to strike both string and skin, creating a highly percussive sound. When playing on the , and occasionally in other genres, the is plucked with the fingers. Sometimes, the is bowed with a violin bow, similar to the , a similar instrument.

==Tuning==

The is played and tuned according to genre, with the nomenclature of the nodes in an octave also varying according to genre. A number of styles exist across Japan, and tunings, tonality and notation vary to some degree. Three of the most commonly recognized tunings across all genres are , , and .
 means &quot;home tuning&quot; or &quot;base tuning&quot;, and is called so because other tunings are considered to derive from it. For , the first and third strings are tuned an octave apart, while the middle string is tuned to the equivalent of a fourth, in Western terms, from the 1st string. The most commonly used tuning is C-F-C. An example of a song that uses this tuning is .
 means &quot;raised two&quot; or &quot;raised second&quot;, referring to the fact that the pitch of the second string is raised (from ), increasing the interval of the first and second strings to a fifth (conversely decreasing the interval between the second and third strings to a fourth). The most commonly used tuning is C-G-C. An example of a song that uses this tuning is .
 means &quot;lowered three&quot; or &quot;lowered third&quot;, referring to tuning the to and lowering the 3rd string (the string with the highest pitch) down a whole step, so that the instrument is tuned in fourths, e.g. C-F-B♭. An example of a song in this tuning is .

Instead of having a set tuning, such as on a guitar (i.e. E, A, D, G, B, E) or a violin (i.e. G, D, A, E), the is tuned according to the register of the singer, or simply to the liking of the player. The player can tune the to whatever register desired, so long as the above conventions are followed.

==Musical notation==

Music for the can be written in Western music notation, but is more often written in tablature notation. While tunings might be similar across genres, the way in which the nodes on the neck of the instrument (called in Japanese) are named is not. As a consequence, tablature for each genre is written differently. For example, in the style, nodes on the are labeled from 0, the open string called &quot;0&quot;. However, in the style, nodes are subdivided and named by octave, with &quot;1&quot; being the open string and first note in an octave, starting over at the next octave. The nodes are also labeled differently for -style . To add to the confusion, sometimes nodes can be &quot;sharped&quot;, and since the names of nodes and their positions are different for each genre, these will also vary. Consequently, students of one genre of will find it difficult to read tablature from other genres of , unless they are specially trained to read these kinds of tablatures.

Tablature can be written in traditional Japanese vertical right-to-left notation, or it can be written in Western style horizontal left-to-right notation, which resembles modern guitar tablature. In traditional vertical notation, Chinese characters and older symbols for dynamics are used, however notation from Western style music notation, such as Italian names for dynamics, time signature and the fermata have been imported. What tuning a work calls for is usually indicated on the tablature.

==History and genres==
The Japanese originated from the Chinese (). The was introduced through the Ryūkyū Kingdom (Okinawa) in the 16th century, where it developed into the Okinawan , from which the ultimately derives. It is believed that the ancestor of the was introduced in the 16th century through the port city of Sakai, near Osaka.

The can be played solo or with other , in ensembles with other Japanese instruments, with singing such as , or as an accompaniment to drama, notably kabuki and . Both men and women traditionally played the .

The most famous and perhaps most demanding of the narrative styles is , named after Takemoto Gidayū (1651–1714), who was heavily involved in the puppet-theater tradition in Osaka. The and its plectrum are the largest of the family, and the singer-narrator is required to speak the roles of the play, as well as to sing all the commentaries on the action. The singer-narrator role is often so vocally taxing that the performers are changed halfway through a scene. There is little notated in the books () of the tradition except the words and the names of certain appropriate generic responses. The player must know the entire work perfectly in order to respond effectively to the interpretations of the text by the singer-narrator. From the 19th century, female performers known as or also carried on this concert tradition.

In the early part of the 20th century, blind musicians, including Shirakawa Gunpachirō (1909–1962), Takahashi Chikuzan (1910–1998), and sighted players such as Kida Rinshōei (1911–1979), evolved a new style of playing, based on traditional folk songs () but involving much improvisation and flashy fingerwork. This style – now known as , after the home region of this style in the north of Honshū – continues to be relatively popular in Japan. The virtuosic style is sometimes compared to bluegrass banjo.

 is a style of historically developed by and mostly performed by geisha and . Its name literally means &quot;little song&quot;, which contrasts with the musical genre of found in and kabuki; though both and geisha training to play the will also learn and will occasionally perform at banquets, the vast majority of musical performances seen at the parties and events they attend are .

 is a more classical style of music.

<doc id="306476" wikidata="Q4349580" url="?curid=306476" title="Exit number">
<text>An exit number is a number assigned to a road junction, usually an exit from a freeway. It is usually marked on the same sign as the destinations of the exit. In some countries, such as the United States and Canada, it is also marked on a sign in the gore.

Exit numbers typically reset at political borders such as state lines.

Some non-freeways use exit numbers. An extreme case of this is in New York City, where the Grand Concourse and Linden Boulevard were given sequential numbers, one per intersection (both boulevards no longer have exit numbers as of 2011). A milder version of this has been recently used on the West Side Highway, also in New York, where only the major intersections are numbered (possibly to match the planned exits on the cancelled Westway freeway). Another case is the Nanaimo Parkway in Nanaimo, British Columbia, carrying Highway 19, where all exits are numbered though all except one are at-grade intersections. Some other intersections on Highway 19 outside Nanaimo are also given numbers.

As a means of educating motorists, some state highway maps include a brief explanation of the exit numbering system on an inset. Iowa DOT maps from the 1970s and 1990s included a picture or drawing of a milepost and briefly described how Iowa had included milepost references near interchanges on the map.

==Sequential numbers==
Sequential exit numbering usually begins with exit 1 at the beginning of the road; each subsequent exit is given the next number. Letter suffixes are commonly used when new exits are added. For example, on the New York State Thruway, an exit was added between 21 and 22, and was given the number 21A. Subsequently, a new exit was added between 21 and 21A, leading to the sequence 21 – 21B – 21A – 22. In Florida, some new exits got the suffix C, so that if it had or acquired separate exits for the two directions, they would be 15CA and 15CB rather than 15AB. There are also occurrences of this happening on the New Jersey Turnpike; the original interchanges opened in 1951, with newer exits as recently as 1982. On the Baltimore Beltway, there is an exit 12B-C (MD 372), as well as 12A (US 1). There is also an exit 8A (I-895) and an exit 8 (MD 168).

Some sequential exits are renumbered (remaining sequential) due to added exits. For instance, the Hutchinson River Parkway in New York was renumbered so that its northernmost exit, 27, became 30. However, the Merritt Parkway, which continued the Hutchinson&#x27;s exit numbers in Connecticut, was not renumbered. This means the Route 120A interchange is numbered 27 in Connecticut and 30 in New York.

The Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector in Atlantic City, New Jersey, uses letters (without numbers) for its exits; it has many exits in a short distance, and the South Jersey Transportation Authority may have wanted to avoid numbers, as the Atlantic City Expressway&#x27;s lowest numbers (mile-based) are in Atlantic City.

==Distance-based numbers==
As more highways were built, states and countries began to experiment with distance-based (mile-based or kilometer-based) exit numbers. The first mile-based system known was implemented on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey in the late 1950s. Michigan also implemented mile-based junction numbers on Interstate 94 in the 1960s. In this system, the number of miles from the beginning of the highway to the exit is used for the exit number. If two exits would end up with the same number, the numbers are sometimes modified slightly; unless there are too many in proximity, and exits are given sequential or directional suffixes, just as with sequential numbers. Distance based numbering is the norm for most highways in the United States and Canada. Many jurisdictions in North America began switching to distance based in the 1980s, with some projects still ongoing currently to convert towards a distance based system. These are further complemented by mile markers or KM markers.

An exit can be numbered by where the exit in the direction of increased mileage leaves the freeway, or by where the road that the exit serves crosses the freeway (which is occasionally ambiguous). From this number, the integer exit number can be determined by rounding up, rounding down, or rounding to the nearest integer. Many jurisdictions prefer to avoid an exit 0. To this end, the numbers are either rounded up to get the exit number, or any exit that would get the number 0 is instead numbered 1. Examples of highways with an exit 0 are British Columbia Highway 1 on the mainland, Interstate 70 in Wheeling, West Virginia, along the West Virginia–Ohio border, and Interstate 90 on the Montana side of the Idaho–Montana border.

Some freeways&#x27; exit number starts from an advanced number (i.e. higher than 1). One reason for starting with a number higher than 1 is that the maintaining agency expects that the highway will be extended. For example, Ontario Highway 400 starts at 20 because it was expected that the southern end of the highway would extend to downtown Toronto (which was never built). Another reason to use a higher number is that the freeway is branching off from another freeway. An example is British Columbia Highway 5, which branches off British Columbia Highway 1 and starts at 170.

In areas that use the metric system, distance-based numbers are by kilometer rather than mile. A number of highways have kilometer-based exit numbers, even in areas that typically use miles; an example of this is with Interstate 19 in the US state of Arizona.

==Exit numbers by country==

===Australia===
Distance-based exit numbering is used in Queensland, although there is not a consistent approach for defining the datum. For example, exit numbers may increase from south to north or north to south.

Victoria and New South Wales have partially implemented sequential exit numbering on selected urban motorways. For instance, the M31 Hume Motorway in New South Wales has exit numbering between Prestons and Campbelltown.

===Europe===

Most European countries use sequential numbering schemes. Spain uses distance-based numbering on its Autovias, but not on its Autopistas. Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia use distance-based schemes. A number of European countries (including the Netherlands, Belgium and France) do not number motorway intersections, apparently because one cannot &quot;exit&quot; the motorway there. Countries like Germany and Switzerland have attributed numbers to their exit, but instead of the usual exit symbol, they are given a specific interchange symbol.

Italy uses sequential numbering on the ring roads for some cities, including the ring road of Rome (&quot;GRA&quot;) and Milan (&quot;Tangenziali&quot;). At one time, it referred to junctions on the Autostrada del Sole by number, and published same on toll tickets; though these may not have been posted on signs.
Both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland use sequential numbering systems, with the junction number indicated by a white number in a black square in the corner of signs. In the United Kingdom they are frequently referenced in the media as the number with &quot;J&quot; on front of it, with for example Junction 58 being referred to as &quot;J58&quot;; as such this abbreviated term has entered popular usage. If a junction is newly constructed to between two existing junctions, it is normally allocated the number of the lower of the two junctions, with the letter &quot;A&quot; attached, followed by &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;C&quot; (and so on). For example, a new junction opened between Junctions 86 and 87 would become Junction 86A, and if a new junction opened between Junctions 86A and 87, it would be Junction 86B.

In the Republic of Ireland, junction numbers have existed since the opening of the first section of the M50 motorway in 1990. Since 2005 have been given greater prominence on road signs. With the development of the inter-urban motorway network in the 2000s, the National Roads Authority adopted a numbering scheme for the inter-urban roads that saw Junction 1 be designated as that road&#x27;s junction with the M50 in most cases. This has meant renumbering of existing junctions on some motorways, most notably the M7 motorway. Non-motorway dual carriageways forming part of major inter-urban roads also have junction numbers; however, only grade-separated interchanges are numbered.

The United Kingdom uses sequential numbering in part because motorway signs use miles rather than kilometres; there are no formal plans to metricate the country&#x27;s motorway system.

===Canada===

Of the provinces that have numbered exit signs on their highways, the majority either use distance based or have switched to using distance based systems. Some highways may also supplement their roads wilth kilometre-based distance markers at specific intervals on the side of the road.

*Ontario has the oldest exit number system, having started posting exit numbers sequentially in the 1960s along Highway 401; it switched to mile-based (distance) numbering before Canada went metric. Most short freeways do not have exit numbers, and until about 2000 (with Highways 11 and 69/400), incomplete freeways also did not have exit numbers. Interchanges with multiple exits are lettered &quot;A-B.&quot; On some highways, Ontario uses KM markers on the side, such as the 401 in Northumberland County. 
*Quebec has the second oldest system; it began sequential but switched to mile-based (distance) junction numbering before the Canadian metric conversion in the mid-1970s. Unlike Ontario, Quebec uses cardinal directions for multiple exits: &quot;E&quot; (&quot;est&quot;), &quot;N&quot; (&quot;nord&quot;), &quot;S&quot; (&quot;sud&quot;), and &quot;O&quot; (&quot;ouest&quot;); an example of the latter is &quot;20-O&quot; (with a hyphen) to avoid confusion with the number. 
*British Columbia uses distance-based exit numbers on its freeways. Some highways, such as Highway 91, have kilometre marker signs on the side. 
*Manitoba has the fewest posted exit numbers. Highway 1 has three numbered exits. Exit numbers were first posted on the Perimeter Highway in 2001. 
*Alberta has the newest exit number system. The province started posting exit numbers on Highway 2 in 2004, and has since extended the system to Highways 1, 16, 201, and 216. In 2006, Alberta started building roadside kilometre markers in a few highways. Spacing is typically every four kilometres.
*Saskatchewan has recently switched to using the distance based system. This started with the Regina Bypass project where distance based exits are now used on the freeway. It uses distance-based exit numbers along with exits lettered A-B for interchanges with multiple exits. On a section of Highway 11 from Regina to Lumsden, letters &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; are used sequentially as &quot;exit letters&quot; instead, making Saskatchewan mainly a distanced-based system that utilizes a bit of sequential lettering as well.
*New Brunswick originally started out using sequential numbering but has switched to using distance based exit signs.

Sequential numbers are used only in Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador.

*Nova Scotia also numbers level junctions on designated express highways. Multiple exits at an interchange use &quot;N-S&quot;, or &quot;E-W&quot;. (Nova Scotia also uses &quot;exit 0&quot; where an interchange is opened &quot;before&quot; Exit 1.) In some instances, exit numbers are skipped, usually as the result of new sections of 4-lane divided highway opening while the old arterial highway is downgraded to a collector highway. On Highway 104, exits 2, 9, 14, 16, 28 and 34 are skipped.
*Newfoundland and Labrador uses sequential numbering for exit signs. Controlled access freeways in the province only exist around the St John&#x27;s metropolitan area.

The territories of Yukon, Nunavut, and Northwest Territories use no exit numbers, as there are no freeways or expressways in the territories.

Prince Edward Island does not use exit numbers. The only limited access highway runs between New Haven and North River (part of the Trans Canada Highway), which features two interchanges, both unnumbered. The Albany Corner interchange near Borden-Carleton is the only other grade-separated exit.

===Hong Kong===
Exit numbers were introduced to major Hong Kong routes in 2004, in conjunction with the re-organization of the route numbers. A sequential numbering scheme is used.

===Japan===
The main expressway system uses sequential numbering; Metropolitan Expressway systems also use sequential junction numbering, usually appended with the expressway number expressed thus: 5-1; 5-2, etc. There are multiple toll expressways not operated by the major national syndicates or the Metropolitan Expressway Authorities that have no junction numbering scheme.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand began introducing exit numbers in the Auckland region in 2005. It uses a distance-based numbering system. The distance to the exit is measured from the origin of the highway. That is:
* State Highway 1 (Northern and Southern Motorways) measured from the origin of SH1 at Cape Reinga
* State Highway 16 (Northwestern Motorway) measured from the origin at the Port
* State Highway 18 (Upper Harbour Motorway) measured from the origin at SH1
* State Highway 20 (Southwestern Motorway) measured from the origin at SH1

There is no exit zero. If there is an exit within 1.499 km of the origin, Exit 1 is used. Exit 2 would be between 1.500 and 2.499 km of the origin. Subsequent &#x27;exit zones&#x27; are at 1 km intervals. Letter suffixes are added at multi-exit interchanges, or where two or more exits exist within the same exit zone. For example, State Highway 1 (Southern Motorway) has an Exit 429A (Symonds St), Exit 429B (Wellesley St) and Exit 429C (Port). Instead of replacing existing ramp and link signs, the exit numbers were added as supplementary information. Thus drivers can navigate either by exit number or name. Exit numbers are only used for exits that may be used by all vehicle types. Bus- or emergency vehicle-only exits would not be numbered.

Exit numbers are not used outside the Auckland region.

===Philippines===

Metric distance-based numbers are used on the tollways radiating from Manila. Supplemental &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; designations are appended to signage at the ends of slip roads.

===South Africa===
Uses distance based numbering (in kilometers) on main motorways. Letter suffixes are added at multi-exit interchanges, an example being the Buccleuch interchange in Johannesburg.

Exit numbers are reset on the borders of the provinces as they were until 1994. This means that exit numbering may change in the middle of a province.

One exception to the usual distance based numbering is the southern portion of the M4 in Durban, which uses sequential numbering.

===Taiwan===

Taiwan uses distance-based exit numbers in kilometers. If two exits are located within the same kilometer mark, the Roman letters are appended to differentiate the exits. Taiwan did experiment with sequential exit numbers with National Freeway No. 1 for a couple of years, but abandoned the experiment in 2004.

Prior to 2006, Taiwan exit signs were generally near replicas of their US counterparts. However, the exit signs now not only indicate the distance number, but they also display the Chinese code-name for the interchange.

<doc id="306478" wikidata="Q485635" url="?curid=306478" title="Keith Haring">
<text>Keith Allen Haring (May 4, 1958 – February 16, 1990) was an American artist whose pop art emerged from the New York City graffiti subculture of the 1980s. His animated imagery has &quot;become a widely recognized visual language&quot;. Much of his work includes sexual allusions that turned into social activism by using the images to advocate for safe sex and AIDS awareness. In addition to solo gallery exhibitions, he participated in renowned national and international group shows such as &quot;documenta&quot; in Kassel, the Whitney Biennial in New York, the São Paulo Biennial, and the Venice Biennale. The Whitney Museum held a retrospective of his art in 1997.

Haring&#x27;s popularity grew from his spontaneous drawings in New York City subways—chalk outlines of figures, dogs, and other stylized images on blank black advertising spaces. After gaining public recognition, he created colorful larger scale murals, many commissioned. He produced more than 50 public artworks between 1982 and 1989, many of them created voluntarily for hospitals, day care centers and schools. In 1986, he opened the Pop Shop as an extension of his work. His later work often conveyed political and societal themes—anti-crack, anti-apartheid, safe sex, homosexuality and AIDS—through his own iconography.

Haring died of AIDS-related complications on February 16, 1990. In 2014, he was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk in San Francisco, a walk of fame noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields&quot;. In 2019, he was one of the inaugural 50 American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education: 1958–1979 ===
Haring was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, on May 4, 1958. He was raised in Kutztown, Pennsylvania, by his mother, Joan Haring, and father, Allen Haring, an engineer and amateur cartoonist. He had three younger sisters, Kay, Karen and Kristen. He became interested in art at a very young age, spending time with his father producing creative drawings. His early influences included Walt Disney cartoons, Dr. Seuss, Charles Schulz, and the Looney Tunes characters in &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot;.

Haring&#x27;s family attended the United Church of Christ. In his early teenage years, he was involved with the Jesus movement. He later hitchhiked across the country, selling T-shirts he made featuring the Grateful Dead and anti-Nixon designs. He graduated from Kutztown Area High School in 1976. He studied commercial art from 1976 to 1978 at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Ivy School of Professional Art, but eventually lost interest, inspired to focus on his own art after reading &quot;The Art Spirit&quot; (1923) by Robert Henri.

Haring had a maintenance job at the Pittsburgh Arts and Crafts Center and was able to explore the art of Jean Dubuffet, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Tobey. He was highly influenced around this time by a 1977 retrospective of Pierre Alechinsky&#x27;s work and by a lecture that the sculptor Christo gave in 1978. From Alechinsky&#x27;s work, he felt encouraged to create large images that featured writing and characters. From Christo, Haring was introduced to ways of incorporating the public into his art. His first significant exhibition was in Pittsburgh Arts and Crafts Center in 1978.

Haring moved to the Lower East Side of New York in 1978 to study painting at the School of Visual Arts. He also worked as a busboy during this time at the nightclub Danceteria. While attending school he studied semiotics with Bill Beckley and experimented with video and performance art. Haring was also highly influenced in his art by author William Burroughs.

In 1978, Haring wrote in his journal: &quot;I am becoming much more aware of movement. The importance of movement is intensified when a painting becomes a performance. The performance (the act of painting) becomes as important as the resulting painting.&quot;

In December 2007, an area of the American Textile Building in the TriBeCa neighborhood of New York City was discovered to have a Haring painting from 1979.

=== Early work: 1980–1981 ===
Haring first received public attention with his graffiti art in subways, where he created white chalk drawings on black, unused advertisement backboards in the stations. He considered the subways to be his &quot;laboratory,&quot; a place where he could experiment and create his artwork and saw the black advertisement paper as a free space and &quot;the perfect place to draw&quot;. The Radiant Baby, a crawling infant with emitting rays of light, became his most recognized symbol. He used it as his tag to sign his work while a subway artist. Symbols and images (such as barking dogs, flying saucers, and large hearts) became common in his work and iconography. As a result, Haring&#x27;s works spread quickly and he became increasingly more recognizable.

The cut-up technique in the writings of William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin inspired Haring&#x27;s work with lettering and words. In 1980, he created headlines from word juxtaposition and attached hundreds to lamp-posts around Manhattan. These included phrases like &quot;Reagan Slain by Hero Cop&quot; and &quot;Pope Killed for Freed Hostage&quot;. That same year, as part of his participating in &quot;The Times Square Show&quot; with one of his earliest public projects, Haring altered a banner advertisement above a subway entrance in Times Square that showed a female embracing a male&#x27;s legs, blacking-out the first letter so that it essentially read &quot;hardón&quot; instead of &quot;Chardón,&quot; a French clothing brand. He later used other forms of commercial material to spread his work and messages. This included mass-producing buttons and magnets to hand out and working on top of subway ads.

In 1980, Haring began organizing exhibitions at Club 57, which were filmed by his close friend, photographer Tseng Kwong Chi. In February 1981, Haring had his first solo exhibition at Westbeth Painters Space in the West Village. In November 1981, Hal Bromm Gallery in Tribeca presented the artist&#x27;s first solo exhibition at a commercial gallery. 

=== Breakthrough and rise to fame: 1982–1986 ===

In January 1982, Haring was the first of twelve artists organized by Public Art Fund to display work on the computer-animated Spectacolor billboard in Times Square. That summer, Haring created his first major outdoor mural on the Houston Bowery Wall on the Lower East Side. In his paintings, he often used lines to show energy and movement. Haring would often work quickly, trying to create as much work as possible—sometimes completing as many as 40 paintings in a day. One of his works, &quot;Untitled&quot; (1982), depicts two figures with a radiant heart-love motif, which critics have interpreted as a bold nod to homosexual love and a significant cultural statement.

In 1982, Haring participated in &quot;documenta 7&quot; in Kassel, where his works were exhibited alongside Joseph Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, Gerhard Richter, Cy Twombly, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. In October 1982, he had an exhibition at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery with his collaborator graffiti artist Angel &quot;LA II&quot; Ortiz. That year, he was in several group exhibitions including &quot;Fast&quot; at the Alexander Milliken Gallery in New York. Haring designed the poster for the 1983 Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland.

In February 1983, Haring had a solo exhibition at the Fun Gallery in the East Village, Manhattan. That year, Haring participated in the São Paulo Biennale in Brazil and the Whitney Biennial in New York. In April 1983, Haring was commissioned to paint a mural, &quot;Construction Fence&quot;, at the construction site of the Haggerty Museum of Art in Milwaukee. Later that year, Haring took part in the exhibition &quot;Urban Pulses: the Artist and the City&quot; in Pittsburgh by spray painting a room at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts and creating an outdoor mural at PPG Place. In October 1983, Elio Fiorucci invited Haring to Milan to paint the walls of his Fiorucci store. While Haring was in London for the opening of his exhibition at the Robert Fraser Gallery in October 1983, he met and began collaborating with choreographer Bill T. Jones. Haring used Jones&#x27; body as the canvas to paint from head to toe.

Haring and Angel &quot;LA II&quot; Ortiz produced a T-shirt design for friends Willi Smith and Laurie Mallet&#x27;s clothing label WilliWear Productions in 1984. After Haring was profiled in &quot;Paper&quot; magazine, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood reached out to editor-in-chief Kim Hastreiter to facilitate a meeting with Haring. Haring presented Westwood with two large sheets of drawings and she turned them into textiles for her Autumn/Winter 1983–84 Witches collection. Haring&#x27;s friend Madonna wore a skirt from the collection, most notably in the music video her 1984 single &quot;Borderline.&quot;

As Haring rose to stardom he continued to draw in the subways, contrasting the rocketing prices for his work. Haring enjoyed giving his work away for free, often handing out free buttons and posters of his work. In 1984, he released a book titled &quot;Art in Transit&quot;, which featured photography by Tseng Kwong Chi and an introduction by Henry Geldzahler. Haring&#x27;s swift rise to international celebrity status was covered by the media. His art covered the February 1984 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and he was featured in the October 1984 issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

In 1984, the New York City Department of Sanitation asked Haring to design a logo for their anti-litter campaign. Haring participated in the Venice Biennale. He was invited to create temporary murals at the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. During his visit to Australia, he painted the permanent &quot;Keith Haring Mural&quot; at Collingwood Technical College in Melbourne. That year, Haring also painted murals at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and in Serra Grande, located in Bahia, Brazil. Later that year, he designed the stage set for the production of Bill T. Jones and Arnie Zane&#x27;s &quot;Secret Pastures&quot; at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Haring was commissioned by the United Nations to create a first day cover of the United Nations stamp and an accompanying limited edition lithograph to commemorate 1985 as International Youth Year. He designed MTV set decorations and painted murals for various art institutions and nightclubs, such as the Palladium in Manhattan. In March 1985, Haring painted the walls of the Grande Halle de la Villette for the Biennale de Paris. In July 1985, he made a painting for the Live Aid concert at J.F.K. Stadium in Philadelphia. Additionally, he painted a car owned by art dealer Max Protetch to be auctioned with proceeds donated to African famine relief. Haring continued to be politically active as well by designing &quot;Free South Africa&quot; posters in 1985, and creating a poster for the 1986 Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament.

In the spring of 1986, Haring had a solo museum exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and he painted a mural. In 1986, Haring also created public murals in the lobby and ambulatory care department of Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center on Flushing Avenue in Brooklyn.

In June 1986, Haring created a banner, &quot;CityKids Speak on Liberty&quot;, in conjunction with The CityKids Foundation to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s arrival in the United States. Later that month, he created his &quot;Crack Is Wack&quot; mural in East Harlem, visible from New York&#x27;s FDR Drive. It was originally considered as vandalism by the New York Police Department and Haring was arrested. But after local media outlets picked up the story, Haring was released on a lesser charge. While in jail, Haring&#x27;s original work was vandalized. This mural is an example of Haring&#x27;s use of consciousness raising rather than consumerism, &quot;Crack is Wack&quot; rather than &quot;Coke is it.&quot; He painted an updated version of the mural on the same wall in October 1986.

On October 23, 1986, Haring created a mural on the Berlin Wall for the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. The mural was long and depicted red and black interlocking human figures against a yellow background. The colors were a representation of the German flag and symbolized the hope of unity between East and West Germany.

Haring began collaborating with Grace Jones, whom he had met through Andy Warhol, for an &quot;Interview&quot; magazine shoot in 1984. Haring painted a skirt for Jones to wear in her music video &quot;I&#x27;m Not Perfect (But I&#x27;m Perfect for You)&quot; (1986) and he was the assistant director for the video. He also body painted Jones for live performances at the Paradise Garage, and for her role of Katrina the Queen of The Vampires in the 1986 film &quot;Vamp&quot;. Haring collaborated with David Spada, a jewelry designer, to design the sculptural adornments for Jones.

Haring also illustrated vinyl covers for various artists such as David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Without You&quot; (1983), N.Y.C. Peech Boys&#x27; &quot;Life Is Something Special&quot; (1983), Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Duck For The Oyster&quot; (1983), and Sylvester&#x27;s &quot;Someone Like You&quot; (1986).

Haring collaborated with Warhol to design the poster for the 1986 Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. The poster was also used for the 1986 Montreux-Detroit Jazz Festival in Detroit.

=== Pop Shop: 1986 ===

In April 1986, Pop Shop opened in Soho, selling shirts, posters, and other items showing Haring&#x27;s work. This made Haring&#x27;s work readily accessible to purchase at reasonable prices. Having achieved what he wanted, which was &quot;getting the work out to the public at large,&quot; Haring completely stopped drawing in the subways. He also stopped because people were taking the subway drawings and selling them.

Some criticized Haring for commercializing his work. Asked about this, Haring said, &quot;I could earn more money if I just painted a few things and jacked up the price. My shop is an extension of what I was doing in the subway stations, breaking down the barriers between high and low art.&quot; The Pop Shop remained open after Haring&#x27;s death until 2005, with profits benefiting the Keith Haring Foundation.

The Pop Shop was not Haring&#x27;s only effort to make his work widely accessible. Throughout his career, Haring made art in subways and on billboards. His attempts to make his work relatable can also be seen in his figures&#x27; lack of discernable ages, races, or identities. By the arrival of Pop Shop, his work had begun reflecting more socio-political themes, such as anti-Apartheid, AIDS awareness, and the crack cocaine epidemic.

=== Final years and death: 1987–1990 ===
From 1982 to 1989, Haring was featured in more than 100 solo and group exhibitions and produced more than 50 public artworks in dozens of charities, hospitals, day care centers, and orphanages. Haring was openly gay and used his work to advocate for safe sex. He was diagnosed with HIV in 1987 and AIDS in the autumn of 1988. He used his imagery during the last years of his life to speak about his illness and to generate activism and awareness about AIDS.

In 1987, Haring had exhibitions in Helsinki, Paris, and elsewhere. During his stay in Paris for the 10th anniversary exhibition of American artists at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Haring and his partner Juan Rivera painted the &quot;Tower&quot; mural on an exterior stairwell at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital. While in Belgium for his exhibition at Gallery 121, Haring painted a mural at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Antwerp.

That same year, Haring was also invited by artist Roger Nellens to paint a mural at his Casino Knokke. While working there, Haring stayed in &quot;Le Dragon&quot;, a monster-shaped guest house owned by Nellens which had been designed by artist Niki de Saint Phalle. With the consent of both the designer and the owner, Haring painted a fresco mural along an interior balcony and stairway.

Haring designed a carousel for André Heller&#x27;s &quot;Luna Luna&quot;, an ephemeral amusement park in Hamburg from June to August 1987 with rides designed by renowned contemporary artists. In August 1987, Haring painted a large mural at the Carmine Street Recreation Center&#x27;s outdoor pool in the West Village. In September 1987, he painted a temporary mural, &quot;Detroit Notes&quot;, at the Cranbrook Art Museum in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. The work reveals a darker phase in Haring&#x27;s style, which Cranbrook Art Museum Director Andrew Blauvelt speculates foreshadowed the confirmation of his AIDS diagnosis.

Haring designed the cover for the 1987 benefit album &quot;A Very Special Christmas&quot; and the Run-DMC single &quot;Christmas In Hollis&quot;; proceeds went to the Special Olympics. The image for the &quot;A Very Special Christmas&quot; compilation album consists of a typical Haring figure holding a baby. Its &quot;Jesus iconography&quot; is considered unusual in modern rock holiday albums.

Also in 1987, Haring painted a mural in the Philadelphia neighborhood of Point Breeze titled &#x27;We the Youth&#x27; to commemorate the bicentennial of the United States Constitution. Originally intended as a placeholder, a new rowhouse was never built and the lot became a park. The mural underwent a major restoration in 2013 and is Haring&#x27;s longest standing public mural at its original location.

In 1988, Haring joined a select group of artists whose work has appeared on the label of Chateau Mouton Rothschild wine. In January 1988, he traveled to Japan to open Pop Shop Tokyo; it closed in the summer of 1988. In April 1988, Haring created a mural on the South Lawn for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, which he donated to Children&#x27;s National Hospital in Washington, D.C. Late in the summer, Haring traveled to Düsseldorf for a show of his paintings and sculptures at the Hans Mayer Gallery. In December 1988, Haring&#x27;s exhibition opened at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery, which he stated was his most important show to date. He felt he had something to prove because of his health condition and the deaths of his friends Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat.

In February 1989, Haring painted the &quot;Todos Juntos Podemos Parar el SIDA&quot; mural in the Barrio Chino neighborhood of Barcelona to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic. In May 1989, at the invitation of a teacher named Irving Zucker, Haring visited Chicago to paint a 480-foot mural in Grant Park along with nearly 500 students. Three other Haring murals materialized in Chicago around the same time: two at Rush University Medical Center, the other at Wells Community Academy High School. The latter was completed days before Haring&#x27;s arrival in Chicago, as a sort of welcome. According to Zucker, Haring sent the school a design template for the mural, which was executed by a fellow teacher, Tony Abboreno, an abstract artist, and Wells High School art students, but Haring gave it his final approval and signed it himself.

For &quot;The Center Show&quot;, an exhibition celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, Haring was invited by the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in New York to create a site-specific work. He chose the second-floor men&#x27;s bathroom to paint his &quot;Once Upon a Time...&quot; mural in May 1989. In June 1989, Haring painted his &quot;Tuttomondo&quot; mural on the rear wall of the convent of the Sant&#x27;Antonio Abate church in Pisa.
Haring criticized the avoidance of social issues such as AIDS through a piece called &quot;Rebel with Many Causes&quot; (1989) that revolves around a theme of &quot;hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil&quot;. During the last week of November 1989, Haring painted a mural at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena for &quot;A Day Without Art&quot;. The mural was commemorated on December 1, the second annual AIDS Awareness Day. He commemorated the mural on December 1, World AIDS Day, and told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;My life is my art, it&#x27;s intertwined. When AIDS became a reality in terms of my life, it started becoming a subject in my paintings. The more it affected my life the more it affected my work.&quot; From Pasadena, Haring flew to Atlanta for the opening of his dual show with photographer Herb Ritts at the Fay Gold Gallery on December 2. In 1990, Haring painted a BMW Z1 at the Hans Mayer Gallery in Düsseldorf. He traveled to Paris for what would be his last exhibition, &quot;Keith Haring 1983&quot;, at Galerie 1900-2000/La Galerie de Poche in January 1990.

On February 16, 1990, Haring died of AIDS-related complications at his LaGuardia Place apartment in Greenwich Village. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in a field near Bowers, Pennsylvania, just south of his hometown of Kutztown. Three months after his death, Haring posthumously appeared in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Silence = Death&quot; (1990) about gay artists in New York City fighting for the rights of people with AIDS. It was released on May 4, which would have been his 32nd birthday.

== Friendships ==
Soon after moving to New York to study at the School of Visual Arts, he became friends with classmates Kenny Scharf (his one time roommate), Samantha McEwen, and John Sex. Eventually, he befriended Jean-Michel Basquiat, who would write his SAMO graffiti around the campus. When Basquiat died in 1988, Haring wrote his obituary for &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, and he paid homage to him with the painting &quot;A Pile of Crowns for Jean-Michel Basquiat&quot; (1988).

In 1979, Haring met photographer Tseng Kwong Chi in the East Village. They became friends and he documented much of Haring&#x27;s career. In 1980, Haring met and began collaborating with graffiti artist Angel &quot;LA II&quot; Ortiz. Haring recounted: &quot;We just immediately hit it off. It&#x27;s as if we&#x27;d known each other all our lives. He&#x27;s like my little brother.&quot; Ortiz&#x27;s artistry formed an important part of Haring&#x27;s work that had gone unacknowledged by the art establishment. Following Haring&#x27;s death, Ortiz stopped receiving credit and payment for his part in Haring&#x27;s work. According to Montez, author of the book &quot;Keith Haring&#x27;s Line: Race and the Performance of Desire&quot;, the Keith Haring Foundation and the art world have since made strides to rectify Ortiz&#x27;s erasure.

By the early 1980s, Haring had established friendships with fellow emerging artists Fab 5 Freddy and Futura 2000, and singer Madonna. In 1982, Haring befriended Andy Warhol, who became his mentor and later the theme of his 1986 &quot;Andy Mouse&quot; series. Warhol also created a portrait of Haring and his partner Juan Dubose in 1983. Through Warhol, Haring became friends with Grace Jones, Francesco Clemente, and Yoko Ono. He also formed friendships with George Condo, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, and Claude Picasso.

Haring met accessories designer Bobby Breslau in the early 1980s. Haring looked to Breslau for guidance and called him his &quot;Jewish mother&quot;. Breslau introduced Haring to his friend Larry Levan, resident DJ at the Paradise Garage. Breslau inspired Haring to work with leather hides and he was the manager of the Pop Shop until his death in 1987.

Art dealer Yves Arman was Haring&#x27;s close friend, and Haring was the godfather of his daughter. Haring said Arman was &quot;probably the best supporter I had in the art world.&quot; In 1989, Arman was killed in a car accident on his way to see Haring in Spain.

In 1988, Gil Vazquez was invited by a friend to visit Haring&#x27;s Broadway studio. Haring and Vazquez became close friends and spent a great deal of time together. Before his death, Haring set up a foundation bearing his name. He appointed his assistant and studio manager Julia Gruen to be the executive director; she began working for him in 1984. Vazquez is the board president of the foundation, which is based at Haring&#x27;s Broadway studio.

==Legacy==
===The Keith Haring Foundation===
In 1989, Haring established the Keith Haring Foundation to provide funding and imagery to AIDS organizations and children&#x27;s programs. The foundation&#x27;s stated goal is to keep his wishes and expand his legacy by providing grants and funding to non-profit organizations that educate disadvantaged youths and inform the public about HIV and AIDS. It also shares his work and contains information about his life. The foundation also supports arts and educational institutions by funding exhibitions, educational programs, and publications. In 2010, the foundation partnered with the AIDS Service Center NYC to open the Keith Haring ASC Harlem Center to provide HIV peer education and access to care services in Harlem.

=== Accolades and tributes ===
As a celebration of his life, Madonna declared that the final American date of her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour would be a benefit concert for Haring&#x27;s memory. The more than $300,000 the show made from ticket sales was donated to the Foundation for AIDS Research. The act was documented in the 1991 film &quot;.&quot;

Haring&#x27;s work was featured in several of Red Hot Organization&#x27;s efforts to raise money for AIDS and AIDS awareness, specifically its first two albums, &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; (1990) and &quot;Red Hot + Dance&quot; (1992), the latter of which used Haring&#x27;s work on its cover. His art remains on display worldwide.

In 1991, Haring was commemorated on the AIDS Memorial Quilt with his famous baby icon on a fabric panel. The baby was embroidered by Haring&#x27;s aunt, Jeannette Ebling, and Haring&#x27;s mother, Joan Haring, did much of the sewing.

Tim Finn wrote the song &quot;Hit The Ground Running&quot;, on his album &quot;Before &amp; After&quot; (1993), in memory of Haring.

In 2006, Haring was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of LGBT History Month.

In 2008, Haring had a balloon in tribute to him at the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. According to artnet.com,
Haring had always dreamed of creating a balloon for the parade. &quot;Eighteen years on from his death, this wish came true on what would have been his 50th birthday. It later fronted the main entrance to Central Park&#x27;s AIDS Walk in 2014. The balloon is also remembered for crashing into NBC&#x27;s onsite booth and taking its broadcast temporarily off air.&quot;
On May 4, 2012, on what would have been Haring&#x27;s 54th birthday, Google honored him in a Google Doodle.

In 2014, Haring was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk. The Rainbow Honor Walk is a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields.&quot;

In June 2019, Haring was one of the inaugural fifty American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall&#x27;s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

In 2021, Polaroid honored Haring with a Polaroid Now camera and Polaroid i-Type instant film decorated with his signature motifs.

In 2024, a historical marker was dedicated to Haring in his hometown of Kutztown, Pennsylvania.

=== In popular culture ===

Haring&#x27;s signature style is frequently seen in various fashion collections. His estate has collaborated with brands such as Adidas, Lacoste, UNIQLO, Supreme, Reebok, Tenga, and Coach.

Haring is the subject of a composition, &quot;Haring at the Exhibition&quot;, written and performed by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero in collaboration with DJ Nicola Guiducci. The work combines excerpts from popular chart music of the 1980s with samples of classical music compositions by Lorenzo Ferrero and synthesized sounds. It was featured at &quot;The Keith Haring Show&quot;, an exhibition which took place in 2005 at the Triennale di Milano.

In 2008, filmmaker Christina Clausen released the documentary &quot;The Universe of Keith Haring&quot;. In the film, Haring&#x27;s legacy is &quot;resurrected through colorful archival footage and remembered by friends and admirers such as artists Kenny Scharf and Yoko Ono, gallery owners Jeffrey Deitch and Tony Shafrazi, and choreographer Bill T. Jones&quot;.

Madonna used Haring&#x27;s art as animated backdrops for her 2008/2009 Sticky and Sweet Tour. The animation featured his trademark blocky figures dancing in beat to an updated remix of &quot;Into the Groove&quot;.

&quot;Keith Haring: Double Retrospect&quot; is a monster-sized jigsaw puzzle by Ravensburger measuring in at with 32,256 pieces, breaking &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for the largest puzzle ever made in 2011. The puzzle uses 32 pieces of his work and weighs .

In 2017, his sister Kay Haring wrote a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Keith Haring: The Boy Who Just Kept Drawing,&quot; which ranked among the top ten sellers every week for over a year in the Amazon category of Children&#x27;s Art History.

In July 2020, BBC Two broadcast the documentary &quot;Keith Haring: Street Art Boy&quot;, which is built from a series of interviews between Haring and art critic John Gruen in 1989. The documentary, which was directed by Ben Anthony, aired in December 2020 on PBS as part of the &quot;American Masters&quot; series.

==Influences==
Haring&#x27;s work demonstrates political and personal influences. References to his sexual orientation are apparent throughout his work, and his journals confirm its impact on his work. There are symbolic allusions to the AIDS epidemic in some of his later pieces, such as &quot;Untitled (cat. no. 27)&quot;, &quot;Silence=Death&quot; and his sketch &quot;Weeping Woman&quot;. In some of his works—including cat. no. 27—the symbolism is subtle, but he also produced some blatantly activist works. &quot;Silence=Death&quot;, which mirrors the ACT UP poster and uses its motto, is almost universally agreed upon as a work of HIV/AIDS activism.

Haring was influenced by William Burroughs&#x27; work with Brion Gysin and their book &quot;The Third Mind&quot;. He was also influenced by fellow artists, including Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, George Condo, and Angel &quot;LA II&quot; Ortiz. In some of his art he drew connections between the end of the world and the AIDS virus. In a piece that he made with William Burroughs, he depicts the virus as demon-like creatures, the number 666, and a mushroom cloud.

Haring&#x27;s proximity to the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island had a large impact on him. His fear of nuclear disaster started to appear in his art. An example of this is a black and white striped flag that he said symbolized the danger of a nuclear apocalypse.

Haring was deeply influenced by the Jesus Movement as a youth, and it continued to play a role in his art for his entire career. The movement was an extremely evangelical, loosely organized, diverse group of Christians. They were known for their anti-materialism and anti-establishment beliefs, focus on the Last Judgment, and their compassionate treatment of the poor. As a young teenager, Haring became very involved in the movement. Religious symbols started to be incorporated into his drawings around that age as well as Jesus Movement sentiments. This includes anti-church establishment views that can be seen in some of his later work. Though his time as a &quot;Jesus Person&quot; did not last beyond his teenage years, religious images, symbols, and references continued to appear in his art. In an interview near the end of his life he commented, &quot;[All] that stuff stuck in my head and even now there are lots of religious images in my work. Some people even think my work is by a religious fanatic or maniac.&quot;

When Haring was drawing graffiti in the subway, he used a tag to sign his work. His tag, the Radiant Baby, depicts a baby with lines radiating from it, alluding to the Christ Child. He continued to make images depicting the Christ Child, including Nativity scenes in his characteristic style during his time as a subway artist. His last pieces were two religious triptychs; both went to Episcopal cathedrals. In them he illustrates the Last Judgment, though who is being saved in the pieces is ambiguous.
==Exhibitions==
During his lifetime, Haring had over 50 solo exhibitions, and was represented by well-known galleries such as the Tony Shafrazi Gallery and the Leo Castelli Gallery. Since his death, has been featured in over 150 exhibitions around the world. He has also been the subject of several international retrospectives.

Haring had his first solo exhibition at Westbeth Painters Space in February 1981. That month he also participated in &quot;New York/New Wave&quot; exhibit at MoMA PS1. Later that year he had a solo exhibition in the Hal Bromm Gallery, followed by his breakthrough exhibition at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in 1982. That same year, he took part in &quot;documenta 7&quot; in Kassel as well as Public Art Fund&#x27;s &quot;Messages to the Public&quot; series in which he created work for a Spectacolor billboard in Times Square. In 1983, Haring contributed work to the Whitney Biennial and the São Paulo Biennial. He also had solo exhibitions at the Fun Gallery, Galerie Watari in Tokyo, and his second show the Tony Shafrazi Gallery.

In 1984, Haring participated in the group show &quot;Arte di Frontiera: New York Graffiti&quot; in Italy. He participated in the Venice Biennale in 1984 and 1986. In 1985, Haring took part in the Paris Biennial and he had his first solo museum exhibition at the CAPC in Bordeaux. In 1986, three of Haring&#x27;s sculptures were placed at Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza outside the United Nations headquarters. Two of the works were displayed at Riverside Park from May 1988 to May 1989. In 1991–92, Haring&#x27;s &quot;Figure Balancing on Dog&quot; was displayed in Dante Park in Manhattan.

In 1996, a retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia was the first major exhibition of his work in Australia. His art was the subject of a 1997 retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, curated by Elisabeth Sussman. The Public Art Fund, in collaboration with the Estate of Keith Haring, organized a multi-site installation of his outdoor sculptures at Central Park&#x27;s Doris C. Freedman Plaza and along the Park Avenue Malls. This public exhibition occurred simultaneously with the retrospective at the Whitney. The sculptures later traveled to the West Coast in 1998. The San Francisco Arts Commission displayed 10 sculptures around San Francisco to coincide with Haring&#x27;s retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The city of West Hollywood and Haring&#x27;s estate also presented his sculptures on Santa Monica Boulevard.

In 2007, Haring&#x27;s painted aluminum sculpture &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (1989) was displayed in the lobby of the Arsenal in Central Park, as part of the retrospective exhibition &quot;The Outdoor Gallery: 40 Years of Public Art in New York City Parks&quot;.

In 2008, there was a retrospective exhibition at the MAC in Lyon, France. In February 2010, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Haring&#x27;s death, the Tony Shafrazi Gallery showed an exhibition containing dozens of works from every stage of Haring&#x27;s career. In March 2012, a retrospective exhibit of his work, &quot;Keith Haring: 1978–1982&quot;, opened at the Brooklyn Museum in New York. In April 2013, &quot;Keith Haring: The Political Line&quot; opened at the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris and Le Cent Quatre. In November 2014, then at the De Young Museum in San Francisco.

From December 2016 to June 2017, the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles exhibited &quot;The Unconventional Canvases of Keith Haring&quot;, which featured five vehicles that Haring painted. In 2019, Haring&#x27;s work was exhibited at Gladstone Gallery in Belgium. The first major UK exhibition of Haring&#x27;s work, featuring more than 85 artworks, was at Tate Liverpool from June to November 2019. From December 2019 to March 2020, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne exhibited &quot;Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat: Crossing Lines&quot;.

In February 2021, the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver opened the exhibition &quot;Keith Haring: Grace House Mural&quot;, which displays 13 panels from a mural Haring painted at a Catholic youth center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in either March 1983 or 1984. The mural—which featured Haring&#x27;s radiant baby, barking dog, and dancing man figures—spanned three floors and 85 feet. When Grace House was sold, its operator, the Church of the Ascension, went against the Keith Haring Foundation&#x27;s wishes of securing a buyer who would maintain the work. Instead, the church had sections of the mural cut out and sold at auction in 2019 to an anonymous private collector for $3.86 million. The panels are on loan to the museum and will appear on exhibit until August 22, 2021.

In 2022, the exhibition &quot;Keith Haring: Grace House Mural&quot; was displayed at the Schunck Museum in Heerlen. In 2023, The Broad presented Haring&#x27;s first museum exhibition in Los Angeles, &quot;Keith Haring: Art is for Everyone&quot;.

== Art market ==
A &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; report from October 1982 shows scenes from Haring&#x27;s solo exhibit at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in SoHo. It was reported that over a quarter of a million dollars worth of paintings were sold within the first few days of the show&#x27;s opening. Although he was an established artist by 1983, Shafrazi stated that Haring wanted to keep his prices low. His prices ranged from $3,000 for a drawing to $15,000 for a large painting. By 1984, his works were selling for up to $20,000 and he had an annual income of $250,000.

Haring created the Pop Shop in 1986 in the SoHo district of Manhattan, selling T-shirts, toys, posters, and other objects that show his works—allowing his works to be accessible to a larger number of people. Speaking about the Pop Shop in 1989, Haring said: &quot;For the past five or six years, the rewards I&#x27;ve gotten are very disproportionate to what I deserve...I make a lot more money than what I should make, so it&#x27;s a little bit of guilt, of wanting to give it back.&quot;

Haring was represented until his death by art dealer Tony Shafrazi. Since his death in 1990, his estate has been administered by the Keith Haring Foundation, which is represented by Gladstone Gallery. In May 2017, Haring&#x27;s painting &quot;Untitled&quot; (1982), which features his signature symbols—the radiant baby, barking dogs, angels and red Xs—sold for $6.5 million at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York, becoming the most expensive Haring artwork sold at auction. However, the winning bidder, Anatole Shagalov, failed to pay and Sotheby&#x27;s resold it for $4.4 million in August 2017.

In October 2020, the Keith Haring Foundation hired Sotheby&#x27;s to hold an online auction of more than 140 works from Haring&#x27;s collection. &quot;Dear Keith&quot; surpassed its estimate of $1.4 million to achieve $4.6 million with a 100 percent sell-through rate by lot. All proceeds from the sale went to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center of New York. In December 2021, Haring&#x27;s 1982 painting &quot;Untitled (Acrobats)&quot; from the collection of Peter M. Brant and Stephanie Seymour, sold for $5.5 million at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York.

In 2022, the drawing of &quot;Radiant Baby&quot; that he had made on the wall of his childhood home in the early 1980s was removed by its owners (together with part of the wall panelling) and offered for sale.

=== Collections ===
Haring&#x27;s work is in major private and public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Morgan Library and Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Bass Museum in Miami; Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; the Brant Foundation Art Study Center in Greenwich, Connecticut; the Carnegie Museum of Art and the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh; the Ludwig Museum in Cologne; and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. He also created a wide variety of public works, including the infirmary at Children&#x27;s Village in Dobbs Ferry, New York, and the second floor men&#x27;s room in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center in Manhattan, which was later transformed into an office and is known as the Keith Haring Room. In January 2019, the exhibit &quot;Keith Haring&#x27;s New York&quot; opened at New York Law School in the main building of its Tribeca campus.

The Nakamura Keith Haring Collection, established in 2007 in Hokuto, Yamanashi, Japan, is an art museum exhibiting exclusively the artworks of Haring.

===Authentication issues===
There is no catalogue raisonné for Haring, but there is copious information about him on the estate&#x27;s website and elsewhere, enabling prospective buyers or sellers to research exhibition history. Whilst no formal catalogue raisonne exists for Haring&#x27;s works &quot;Keith Haring 1982–1990: Editions on Paper – the Complete Printed Works&quot; by Klaus Littmann is widely considered to be the most authoritative guide on the subject of his printed editions.

In 2012, the Keith Haring Foundation disbanded its authentication board to focus on its charitable activities. That same year, it donated $1 million to support exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 2014, a group of nine art collectors sued the foundation, claiming that it has cost them at least $40 million by refusing to authenticate 80 purported Haring works. In 2015, a judge ruled in favor of the foundation.

<text>James Albert Rosenquist (November 29, 1933 – March 31, 2017) was an American artist and one of the proponents of the pop art movement. Drawing from his background working in sign painting, Rosenquist&#x27;s pieces often explored the role of advertising and consumer culture in art and society, utilizing techniques he learned making commercial art to depict popular cultural icons and mundane everyday objects. While his works have often been compared to those from other key figures of the pop art movement, such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, Rosenquist&#x27;s pieces were unique in the way that they often employed elements of surrealism using fragments of advertisements and cultural imagery to emphasize the overwhelming nature of ads. He was a 2001 inductee into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Rosenquist was born on November 29, 1933, in Grand Forks, North Dakota, the only child of Louis and Ruth Rosenquist. His parents were amateur pilots of Swedish descent who moved from town to town to look for work, finally settling in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His mother, who was also a painter, encouraged her son to have an artistic interest. In junior high school, Rosenquist won a short-term scholarship to study at the Minneapolis School of Art and subsequently studied painting at the University of Minnesota from 1952 to 1954. In 1955, at the age of 21, he moved to New York City on scholarship to study at the Art Students League, studying under painters such as Edwin Dickinson and George Grosz. Talking about his experience at the Art Students League, Rosenquist said &quot;I studied only with the abstract artists. They had commercial artists there teaching commercial work, I didn&#x27;t bother with that. I was only interested in – see, here&#x27;s how it started. I was interested in learning how to paint the Sistine Chapel. It sounds ambitious, but I wanted to go to mural school&quot;. While studying in New York, Rosenquist took up a job as a chauffeur, before deciding to join the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades. As a member of the union, Rosenquist would paint billboards around Times Square, ultimately becoming the lead painter for Artkraft‐Strauss and painting displays and windows across Fifth Avenue. By 1960, Rosenquist abandoned painting signs after a friend died by falling from scaffolding on the job. Instead of working on commercial pieces, he chose to focus on personal projects in his own studio, developing his own distinct style of painting that retained the kind of imagery, bold hues, and scale that he utilized while he painted billboards.

==Career==
Rosenquist&#x27;s career in commercial art began when he was 18, after his mother encouraged him to pursue a summer job painting. He started by painting Phillips 66 signs, going to gas stations from North Dakota to Wisconsin. After leaving school, Rosenquist took a series of odd jobs and then turned to sign painting. From 1957 to 1960, Rosenquist earned his living as a billboard painter. Rosenquist applied sign-painting techniques to the large-scale paintings he began creating in 1960. Like other pop artists, Rosenquist adapted the visual language of advertising and pop culture to the context of fine art.
&quot;I painted billboards above every candy store in Brooklyn. &quot;I got so I could paint a Schenley whiskey bottle in my sleep&quot;, he wrote in his 2009 autobiography, &quot;Painting Below Zero: Notes on a Life in Art&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine stated that &quot;his powerful graphic style and painted montages helped define the 1960s Pop Art movement.&quot;

In 2003, art critic Peter Schjeldahl asked of Rosenquist&#x27;s application of sign painting techniques to fine art thus: &quot;[W]as importing the method into art a bit of a cheap trick? So were Warhol&#x27;s photo silk-screening and Lichtenstein&#x27;s lining of panels from comic strips. The goal in all cases was to fuse painting aesthetics with the semiotics of media-drenched contemporary reality. The naked efficiency of anti-personal artmaking defines classic Pop. It&#x27;s as if someone were inviting you to inspect the fist with which he simultaneously punches you.&quot;

Rosenquist had his first two solo exhibitions at the Green Gallery in 1962 and 1963. He exhibited his painting &quot;F-111&quot;, a room-scale painting, at the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1965, with which he achieved international acclaim.

But Rosenquist said the following about his involvement in the Pop Art movement: &quot;They [art critics] called me a Pop artist because I used recognizable imagery. The critics like to group people together. I didn&#x27;t meet Andy Warhol until 1964. I did not really know Andy or Roy Lichtenstein that well. We all emerged separately.&quot;

In 1971 Rosenquist came to South Florida after receiving an offer from Donald Saff, dean of the University of South Florida&#x27;s College of Fine Arts, to participate in the school&#x27;s Graphicstudio, a collaborative art initiative. In the years following Rosenquist remained a key contributor to the studio, cooperating with students and other artists and producing numerous works of his own, ultimately creating his Aripeka studio in 1976. Rosenquist would continue to travel to Florida throughout his career with the artist developing several commissioned works for the community including two murals for Florida&#x27;s state capitol building and a sculpture for Johns Hopkins All Children&#x27;s Hospital, in addition to serving on the Tampa Museum of Art&#x27;s Board of Trustees.

Rosenquist&#x27;s paintings have been on display in the lobby of Key Tower in Cleveland, Ohio. His &quot;F-111&quot; was displayed there for many years.

After his acclaim, Rosenquist produced large-scale commissions. This includes the three-painting suite &quot;The Swimmer&quot; &quot;in the Econo-mist&quot; (1997–1998) for Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin, Germany, and a painting that was planned for the ceiling of the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, France.

==Works==

&quot;Zone&quot;: A key work in the development of his signature style, Rosenquist cites his 1961 work &quot;Zone&quot; as a turning point in the development of his own personal aesthetic, with the piece being the first to employ monumental scale, a recurring aspect of Rosenquist&#x27;s art that is exemplified in his many murals. &quot;Zone&quot; also served as a stepping stone in Rosenquist&#x27;s body of work in that it served as a departure from his previous works, which saw him move away from previous experiments in Abstract Expressionism, with the picture being described by Rosenquist as his first pop piece. Done in oil on two separate pieces of canvas, the work exemplifies the beginnings of the pop art movement in the way that Rosenquist takes imagery from mass media, using a picture of a tomato and a clipping from an ad for hand cream. The two images are divided into separate zones, which serve to focus on visual parallels such as the arch of the tomato stem and the woman&#x27;s eyelashes, as well as illustrating Rosenquist&#x27;s signature, often surreal, fragmented composition.

&quot;President Elect&quot;: Released the same year as &quot;Zone&quot;, James Rosenquist&#x27;s &quot;President Elect&quot; is among one his most well-known pieces, with the artist translating a portrait of John F. Kennedy from a campaign poster onto a towering display. The painting also includes a superimposed picture of hand holding cake in greyscale, as well as the back of a Chevrolet. Rosenquist uses icons in pop culture to examine fame and the relationship between advertising and the consumer, exploring the kind of fame and iconography that comes with American politics. With &quot;President Elect&quot;, Rosenquist seeks to make a statement on the new role that advertising and mass media had during the Kennedy&#x27;s campaign. &quot;I was very interested at that time in people who advertised themselves,&quot; said Rosenquist. &quot;Why did they put up an advertisement of themselves? So that was his face. And his promise was half a Chevrolet and a piece of stale cake.&quot; In the painting, Rosenquist contrasts the portrait of Kennedy with the cake and the Chevrolet to show how each element is marketed to American consumers.

&quot;F-111&quot;: In 1965, James Rosenquist completed &quot;F-111&quot;, one of the largest and most ambitious works in his collection. Spanning over 83 feet and 23 canvases, the painting&#x27;s scale evokes Rosenquist&#x27;s work on billboards, illustrating a life-sized depiction of the F-111 Aardvark aircraft. The painting initially was intended to cover all four walls of the main room within the Castelli gallery in Manhattan, occupying the entirety of each wall without any kind of visual relief, to cast an imposing, continuous view of the war. Painted during the Vietnam war, &quot;F-111&quot; contrasts pictures from the war with commercial imagery from advertisements, showing tires, a cake, lightbulbs, a girl in a salon hairdryer, bubbles, and spaghetti. Rosenquist juxtaposes the imagery from the ads against the plane as a way to imply graphic scenes from the war, with broken light bulbs near the cockpit mirroring bombs dropping from the plane, and the hood of the hairdryer echoing the look of a missile. Rosenquist uses the painting to question the role of marketing and coverage of the war describing the plane as &quot;flying through the flak of consumer society to question the collusion between the Vietnam death machine, consumerism, the media, and advertising,&quot;.

==Honors==
Rosenquist received numerous honors, including selection as &quot;Art In America Young Talent USA&quot; in 1963, appointment to a six-year term on the Board of the National Council of the Arts in 1978, and receiving the Golden Plate Award from the American Academy of Achievement in 1988. In 2002, the Fundación Cristóbal Gabarrón conferred upon him its annual international award for art, in recognition of his contributions to universal culture.

Beginning with his first early-career retrospectives in 1972 organized by the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City, and the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne, Rosenquist&#x27;s work was the subject of several gallery and museum exhibitions, both in the United States and abroad. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum organized a full-career retrospective in 2003, which travelled internationally, and was organized by curators Walter Hopps and Sarah Bancroft.

His &quot;F-111&quot;, shown at The Jewish Museum in 1965, was mentioned in a chapter of &quot;Polaroids from the Dead&quot; by Douglas Coupland.

==Art market==
The highest selling painting by the artist was &quot;Be Beautiful&quot; (1964), sold at Sotheby&#x27;s by $3,301,000, on 14 May 2014.

==Personal life==
Rosenquist married twice and had two children. With his first wife, Mary Lou Adams, whom he married on June 5, 1960, he had one child: John. His first marriage ended in divorce. In 1976, a year after his divorce, he moved to Aripeka, Florida. His second wife was Mimi Thompson, whom he married on April 18, 1987, by whom he had one child: Lily.

On April 25, 2009, a fire swept through Hernando County, Florida, where Rosenquist had lived for 30 years, burning his house, studios, and warehouse. All of his paintings stored on his property were destroyed, including art for an upcoming show.

==Death==
Rosenquist died at his home in New York City on March 31, 2017, after a long illness; he was 83 years old. His survivors include his wife, Thompson; one daughter, Lily; one son, John; and a grandson, Oscar.

<doc id="306481" wikidata="Q698275" url="?curid=306481" title="Wayne Thiebaud">
<text>Wayne Thiebaud ( ; born Morton Wayne Thiebaud; November 15, 1920 – December 25, 2021) was an American painter known for his colorful works depicting commonplace objects—pies, cakes, lipsticks, paint cans, ice cream cones, pastries, and hot dogs—as well as for his landscapes and figure paintings. Thiebaud is regarded as one of the United States&#x27; most beloved and recognizable artists. Thiebaud is associated with the pop art movement because of his interest in objects of mass culture, although his early works, executed during the fifties and sixties, slightly predate the works of the classic pop artists. Thiebaud used heavy pigment and exaggerated colors to depict his subjects, and the well-defined shadows characteristic of advertisements were almost always included in his work.

== Early life and education ==
Thiebaud was born to Alice Eugenia (Le Baron) and Morton Thiebaud in Mesa, Arizona. They moved a year later to Southern California where the family lived for most of Thiebaud&#x27;s childhood until he graduated from secondary school in Long Beach, California. Thiebaud and his family were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and his father was a bishop in the church when Thiebaud was a teenager. Morton was also a Ford mechanic, foreman at Gold Medal Creamery, traffic safety supervisor, and real estate agent.

One summer during his first school years, he apprenticed at Walt Disney Studios drawing &quot;in-betweens&quot; of Goofy, Pinocchio, and Jiminy Cricket at a rate of $14 a week. The next summer, he studied at the Frank Wiggins Trade School in Los Angeles. From 1938 to 1949, he worked as a cartoonist and designer in California and New York City. He served as an artist in the First Motion Picture Unit of the United States Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1945.

In 1949, he enrolled at San Jose State College (now San José State University) before transferring to Sacramento State College (now California State University, Sacramento), where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1951 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1952.

== Career ==
Thiebaud subsequently began teaching at Sacramento City College. In 1960, he became assistant professor at the University of California, Davis, where he remained through 1991 and influencing numerous art students. He held a Professor Emeritus title there up until his death in late 2021. He occasionally gave pro bono lectures at U.C. Davis.

On a leave of absence during 1956–57, he spent time in New York City, where he became friends with Elaine and Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline, and was much influenced by these abstractionists as well as by proto-pop artists Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. During this time, he began a series of very small paintings based on images of food displayed in windows, and he focused on their basic shapes.

Returning to California, he pursued this subject matter and style, isolating triangles, circles, squares, etc. He also co-founded the Artists Cooperative Gallery, now Artists Contemporary Gallery, and other cooperatives including Pond Farm, having been exposed to the concept of cooperatives in New York.

In 1960, he had his first solo show in San Francisco at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and shows in New York City at the Staempfli and Tanager galleries. These shows received little notice, but two years later, a 1962 Sidney Janis Gallery exhibition in New York officially launched Pop Art, bringing Thiebaud national recognition, although he disclaimed being anything other than a painter of illusionistic form.

In 1961, Thiebaud met and became friends with art dealer Allan Stone (1932–2006), the man who gave him his first &quot;break.&quot; Stone was Thiebaud&#x27;s dealer until Stone&#x27;s death in 2006. Stone said of Thiebaud &quot;I have had the pleasure of friendship with a complex and talented man, a terrific teacher and cook, the best raconteur in the west with a spin serve, and a great painter whose magical touch is exceeded only by his genuine modesty and humility. Thiebaud&#x27;s dedication to painting and his pursuit of excellence inspire all who are lucky enough to come in contact with him. He is a very special man.&quot; After Stone&#x27;s death, Thiebaud&#x27;s son Paul Thiebaud (1960–2010) took over as his dealer. Paul Thiebaud was a successful art dealer in his own right and had eponymous galleries in Manhattan and San Francisco; he died June 19, 2010.

In 1962, Thiebaud&#x27;s work was included, along with Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Jim Dine, Phillip Hefferton, Joe Goode, Edward Ruscha, and Robert Dowd, in the historically important and ground-breaking &quot;New Painting of Common Objects,&quot; curated by Walter Hopps at the Pasadena Art Museum (now the Norton Simon Museum at Pasadena). This exhibition is considered to have been one of the first Pop Art exhibitions in the United States. These painters were part of a new movement, in a time of social unrest, which shocked the United States and the art world.

In 1963, he turned increasingly to figure painting: wooden and rigid, with each detail sharply emphasized. In 1964, he made his first prints at Crown Point Press, and continued to make prints throughout his career. In 1967, his work was shown at the Biennale Internationale.

Thiebaud was married twice. With his first wife, Patricia Patterson, he had two children, one of whom is the model and writer Twinka Thiebaud. With his second wife, Betty Jean Carr, he had a son, Paul LeBaron Thiebaud, who became an art dealer. He also adopted Betty&#x27;s son, Matthew.

He died at his residence in Sacramento, California on Christmas Day 2021, at age 101.

== Work ==

Thiebaud is well known for his paintings of production line objects found in diners and cafeterias, such as pies and pastries. As a young man in Long Beach, he worked at a cafe named &quot;Mile High and Red Hot&quot;, where &quot;Mile High&quot; was ice cream and &quot;Red Hot&quot; was a hot dog.

He was associated with the Pop art painters because of his interest in objects of mass culture; however, his works, executed during the 1950s and 1960s, slightly predate the works of the classic pop artists, suggesting that Thiebaud may have had an influence on the movement. Thiebaud employed heavy pigment and exaggerated colors to depict his subjects, and the well-defined shadows characteristic of advertisements are almost always included in his work. Thiebaud was averse to labels such as &quot;fine art&quot; versus &quot;commercial art&quot; and described himself as &quot;just an old-fashioned painter&quot;. He disliked Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;flat&quot; and &quot;mechanical&quot; paintings and did not consider himself a pop artist.

In addition to pastries, Thiebaud painted characters such as Mickey Mouse as well as landscapes, streetscapes, and cityscapes, which were influenced by the work of Richard Diebenkorn. His paintings such as &quot;Sunset Streets&quot; (1985) and &quot;Flatland River&quot; (1997) are noted for their hyper realism, and have been compared to Edward Hopper&#x27;s work, another artist who was fascinated with mundane scenes from everyday American life.

== Collections and exhibitions ==
Thiebaud&#x27;s works are in permanent collections at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Crocker Art Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art, and the Phoenix Art Museum have also held works by the artist. Exhibitions featuring Thiebaud include a 2001 retrospective at the Whitney Museum, a 2012 retrospective at Acquavella Galleries, and a 2021 retrospective at the Toledo Museum of Art.

The Crocker has hosted a Thiebaud exhibition every decade since 1951, including &quot;Wayne Thiebaud 100&quot; to honor the artist&#x27;s 100th birthday in 2020.

== Recognition ==
In 1987, Thiebaud was awarded the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. On October 14, 1994, Thiebaud was presented with the National Medal of Arts by President Clinton. In 2009, he was honored by California Lawyers for the Arts with its Artistic License Award at its annual gala celebration. He also received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Art from the American Academy of Design in 2001. Thiebaud was inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2010 at the California Museum, Sacramento, and in 2013, he was honored with the California Art Award in recognition of his part in raising the prominence of California art around the world.

== Auction records ==
In November 2019, Sotheby&#x27;s $8.46 million sale of Thiebaud&#x27;s 2011 painting &quot;Encased Cakes&quot; set an auction record for the artist. This record was broken in July 2020, when his 1962 painting &quot;Four Pinball Machines&quot; sold for $19,135,000 in New York City at a Christie&#x27;s global live auction event.

== Influences ==
One of Thiebaud&#x27;s students from Sacramento City College was the artist Fritz Scholder (1937–2005), who went on to become a major influence in the direction of American Indian art through his instruction at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico (1964–1969). The painter Mel Ramos (1935–2018), considered Thiebaud his mentor. Among his pupils were the painters Faith Bromberg, Vonn Cummings Sumner, and Christopher Brown.

Sharon Core is a photographer known for her photographic interpretations of Thiebaud&#x27;s works.

<doc id="306484" wikidata="Q163518" url="?curid=306484" title="Peberholm">
<text>Peberholm ( , ()) is a small artificial island in the Danish part of the Øresund strait, created as part of the Øresund Bridge connecting Denmark with Sweden. Peberholm lies approximately 1 km south of the larger natural island of Saltholm (&quot;Salt Islet&quot;) and was named to complement it. It has an area of and belongs to Denmark.

==Reasons for construction==

The reason for constructing the island was to have a crossover point between the tunnel and the bridge.

The tunnel was built since a bridge spanning the entire link between Malmö and Copenhagen would have interfered with obstacle-free zones around Kastrup Airport. Another reason was to enable large ships to pass the Öresund without worrying about the height of the bridge. Making the Øresund Bridge higher would have interfered with the freight train traffic because a steeper gradient would be needed.

The border between Swedish and Danish railway signalling and railway traffic control is on Peberholm.

There is an exit from the motorway on the island, banned from unauthorised traffic, and a helicopter pad mainly planned for usage at traffic accidents ().

==Built to preserve ecology==
The original designs for a bridge across the Øresund required extensive use of Saltholm as a stepping-stone for the bridge. They required either the construction of both a motorway and railway across Saltholm or an expansion of the existing island to serve the same purpose.

Both of these options were ultimately abandoned in order to protect the island&#x27;s ecology; Danish and Swedish politicians decided instead to construct an artificial island immediately south of Saltholm to achieve that goal. The location was chosen in the belief that it would ensure the freest flow of water through the strait, a key element in the debate about whether or not the bridge should be constructed.

Peberholm is protected by strict laws. Only biologists are allowed one annual visit to the areas of the island outside of the railroad and highway to which the island owes its creation. The island is part of Natura 2000 area 142, comprising Saltholm and surrounding waters with a total area of . The same area is also under two birdprotections as habitats H110 and H126. The laws did not prevent it from being used as a border control station during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

===Development===
Peberholm is considered to be a biological experiment. Scientists predicted that nature would colonise it and make the island flourish on its own, without any human interaction whatsoever. As of June 2007, scientists from the Biological Society of Lund had registered 454 species of plants on the island. Also resident to the island were about 20 species of spiders, and approximately 12 species of birds.

Since 2008, both the quantity of birds and the number of bird species have seen an increase, and now between 20 and 30 species breed on Peberholm regularly. The island is largely inhabited by several kinds of breeding gulls, and some locally threatened species have also found a home there as breeders, including the Mediterranean gull and European rock pipit in some years. Many geese, ducks, great cormorants, and waders rest on the small island and the white-tailed eagle is often observed in winter. The European green toad, which is rare and protected in Denmark, was found living in several ditches. In 2007–08 a count found 2,500 individuals, which is among the largest populations in Scandinavia. It is assumed that toads from Saltholm have swum across. Three species of mice have also populated Peberholm, and since 2010, hares have crossed the ice and are breeding on Peberholm. It is important to keep these populations under surveillance, as mice can be dangerous to the stability of the rails. Since 2015, white rabbits have been seen on the island. They may have be pets that were released by a driver.

In the years 2004–08 surveys focused on insects registered a total of 345 beetle species, 421 species of butterflies, and 18 species of bees. This is considered a relatively low diversity compared to similar habitats in Denmark and Sweden, however some of these species are rare or threatened in the region. The population of butterflies seems peculiarly skewed towards regionally uncommon or rare species, including &quot;Epiblema grandaevana&quot; (a species of moth), and Bath white (&quot;Pontia daplidice&quot;). In 2005 the Hobo spider was discovered here, a spider that is only regionally known from a certain spot in Jutland. It is thought that it migrated here by trains from abroad. In 2006, the weevil species &quot;Ceutorhynchus resedae&quot; was also discovered, a unique find in Denmark.

<text>Heilbronn () is a city in northern Baden-Württemberg, Germany, surrounded by Heilbronn District.

From the late Middle Ages on, it developed into an important trading centre. At the beginning of the 19th century, Heilbronn became one of the centres of early industrialisation in Württemberg. Heilbronn&#x27;s old town was completely destroyed during the air raid of 4 December 1944 and rebuilt in the 1950s. Today Heilbronn is the economic centre of the Heilbronn-Franken region.

Heilbronn is known for its wine industry and is nicknamed &quot;Käthchenstadt&quot;, after Heinrich von Kleist&#x27;s &quot;Das Käthchen von Heilbronn&quot;.

==Geography==
Heilbronn is located in the northern corner of the Neckar basin at the bottom of the Wartberg (308 m). It occupies both banks of the Neckar, and the highest spot inside city limits is the Schweinsberg with a height of 372 meters. Heilbronn is adjacent to the Swabian-Franconian Forest Nature Park and is surrounded by vineyards.
Heilbronn and its surroundings are located in the northern part of the larger Stuttgart metropolitan area. The city is the economic center of the Heilbronn-Franken region and is one of fourteen such cities in the Baden-Württemberg master plan of 2002. It also serves Abstatt, Bad Rappenau, Bad Wimpfen, Beilstein, Brackenheim, Cleebronn, Eberstatt, Ellhofen, Eppingen, Flein, Gemmingen, Güglingen, Ilsfeld, Ittlingen, Kirchardt, Lauffen am Neckar, Lehrensteinsfeld, Leingarten, Löwenstein, Massenbachhausen, Neckarwestheim, Nordheim, Obersulm, Pfaffenhofen, Schwaigern, Siegelsbach, Talheim, Untergruppenbach, Weinsberg, Wüstenrot, and Zaberfeld as a regional economic centre.

===Neighboring communities===
Heilbronn shares a border with the following cities and towns, all part of Heilbronn County and listed here clockwise from the North: Bad Wimpfen, Neckarsulm, Erlenbach, Weinsberg, Lehrensteinsfeld, Untergruppenbach, Flein, Talheim, Lauffen am Neckar, Nordheim, Leingarten, Schwaigern, Massenbachhausen and Bad Rappenau.

===Boroughs===
The city is divided into nine boroughs:

==History==

===Up to AD 1200===
The oldest traces of humans in and around Heilbronn date back to the Old Stone Age (30,000 BC). The fertile Neckar floodplains in the Heilbronn basin aided early settlement by farmers and ranchers. The city limits of present-day Heilbronn contain many sites of Bronze Age finds. Later on, but still before AD, the Celts already mined here for salt from brine.

Under Roman Emperor Domitian (AD 81–96) the Romans pushed east away from the Rhine and the outer boundary of the Roman Empire was set at the Neckar-Odenwald Limes. A castle in today&#x27;s borough of Böckingen was part of that &quot;limes&quot;, and nearby numerous Roman villas and plantations were built. Around AD 150, the Neckar-Odenwald Limes became obsolete when the boundary of the Roman Empire was moved approximately to the east, where it was subsequently fortified with the construction of the Upper Germanic Limes complete with parapet and trenches.

Around 260, the Romans surrendered the limes, and the Alamanni became rulers of the Neckar basin. Between the 4th and 7th centuries, the area became part of the Frankish Empire, and the first settlement was built in the general vicinity of the present center of town.

In 741, Heilbronn is first mentioned in an official document of the Diocese of Würzburg as &quot;villa Helibrunna&quot; (together with a &quot;Michaelsbasilica&quot;), and in 841, King Louis the German set up court here for a period of time. The name &quot;Heilbrunna&quot; (&quot;healing well&quot;) hints to a well that is located not far from the basilica. In 1050, a significant settlement of Jews is noted in official documents, and the Codex of the monastery in Hirsau documented Heilbronn&#x27;s right to hold market days and mint coins, mentioning its harbor and vineyards as well. The name of the city became a widespread Jewish surname in many varieties, see Heilprin, Halpern, and Halperin.

===1200–1500===

In 1225, Heilbronn was incorporated into the Hohenstaufen Empire as &quot;oppidum Heilecbrunnen&quot;. &quot;Oppidum&quot; signified a city fortified by parapet and trenches. Later during the 13th century, the Teutonic Knights obtained ownership of a large area south of Heilbronn which would remain owned by that order until German Mediatisation in 1805. Starting in 1268, the order built the &quot;Deutschhof&quot; there as one of its residences. The church building of the order that was located on the premises was modified and expanded several times: First in 1350 it was expanded (Gothic), then it was remodeled in 1719 (Baroque), and in 1977, it was consecrated as a cathedral.

After the demise of the Staufen dynasty, King Rudolf I returned city status to Heilbronn in 1281 and installed a regal advocate to rule the city. In addition to the advocate he put a council in place that was headed up by a mayor. Around 1300, the first city hall was erected in the market place and the Kilianskirche (built on the foundation of the Michaelsbasilica) was expanded. The Neckar privilege gave the city the right to modify the flow of the river in 1333, which meant it now had the right to construct dams, harbors and mills. Because of the infrastructure thus created, during the 14th century Heilbronn grew attractive to merchants and craftspeople, who now demanded the right to determine their own fate.

In 1371, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, issued a new charter to the city. Now Heilbronn needed to answer only to the Emperor and as such was an Imperial Free City. Craftspeople and merchants were now represented in its council and the villages of Böckingen, Flein, Frankenbach and Neckargartach became part of Heilbronn&#x27;s territory.

As an Imperial Free City Heilbronn was threatened by the ambitious House of Württemberg. A relationship with the Holy Roman Emperor and a treaty with the Electorate of the Palatinate in effect from 1417 to 1622 strengthened Heilbronn&#x27;s position and kept the House of Württemberg at bay. The political stability enjoyed by the city during the 15th century enabled it to expand, and many of its historic structures, such as the Kilianskirche (1455–60), trace their origins to that era.

===1500–1700===
Götz von Berlichingen spent three years in &quot;knightly custody&quot; in Heilbronn starting in 1519 and even spent a night in the tower of the bastion. That same year people first took note of the pub owner Jäcklein Rohrbach who with accomplices would later kill the executor of Böckingen. After he had spent some time in the Hohenlohe Plains and collected similarly minded characters around him, he returned to Heilbronn in April 1525 just as the German Peasants&#x27; War was getting into full swing. On April 16 the peasants killed many of the nobles in Weinsberg and on April 18 the Heilbronn monastery of the Order of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel was attacked and ransacked. The city opened its gates in response to demands of the peasants and consequently more churches and municipal institutions were robbed the next day. For about a month Heilbronn remained under the control of rebellious peasants. And even though Johann Lachmann, later a church reformer, had attempted to mediate, the peasants did not leave the city until one of their armies was defeated on May 12, 1525, in Böblingen. Their leader Rohrbach was executed on May 21, 1525, in Neckargartach and his home town of Böckingen was partially burnt to the ground in punishment.

In 1528, the replacement of the mayor by Hans Riesser, a Protestant, brought on the previously delayed Reformation and through the efforts of Reformer Lachmann schools and healthcare were also reorganized. In 1529 the Kilianskirche (church tower of the Kilianskirche) was completed. It was the first important religious building of the Renaissance in Germany. The year 1530 brought about the acceptance of the Augsburg Confession by city council and residents and the &quot;Heilbronn Catechism&quot; of 1536 is the second oldest catechism in the Protestant Church. In 1538 Heilbronn joined the Schmalkaldic League but by 1546 squabbles between troops of the Schmalkaldic League and those of the Emperor Charles V escalated into battles that were won by the Emperor. As a result, Charles V spent Christmas 1546 in Heilbronn to attend the ensuing criminal proceedings. It is also Charles V who in 1522 changed the charter of the city and this charter survived almost unscathed until 1803.
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the city and surrounding villages suffered badly. After the battle of Wimpfen in 1622, Neckargartach was burnt to the ground. In 1631 Heilbronn was occupied by imperial troops but the same year the Swedes succeeded in conquering the city. From 1644 through 1647, Heilbronn was again part of the Holy Roman Empire, but then French troops moved in and later those of the Electorate of the Palatinate. The city was not free of occupying forces until four years after the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. But already in the 1670s the city again became the stage for armed manoeuvres, until it was occupied by French troops in 1688. But while that occupation of the city only lasted several months, the French were only persuaded to leave the surrounding areas in 1693, after a large defensive army had been put into the field and fortifications had been erected.

===1700–1900===

During the 18th century, archives suggest all members of the city council enjoyed some sort of formal education; Schiller and Goethe came to visit; and elaborate buildings were being constructed in the Rococo style.

On September 9, 1802, Heilbronn lost its status as an Imperial Free City when the troops of Duke Friedrich I of Württemberg arrived. The duke had conceded the left bank of the Rhine to France during the French Revolutionary Wars but had been compensated with areas on the right bank. This is how Heilbronn and other former Imperial Free Cities became part of Württemberg in 1803. Heilbronn became the seat of an &quot;Oberamt&quot; (district), and the four Imperial Free villages became separate communities within the district. In 1806 the Duchy of Württemberg became the Kingdom of Württemberg.

In 1815, Heilbronn again became a staging area for major armies ahead of the campaign against Napoleon, and 10,000 troops paraded in front of Emperor Franz of Austria and more than one hundred German princes and generals in the &quot;Theresienwiese&quot;. Tsar Alexander I of Russia met in Heilbronn with the Baltic Baroness Juliane von Krüdener, who talked him into founding the &quot;Holy Alliance&quot;.

Industrialization arrived in 1820. When the first train lines were placed in service in Württemberg, Heilbronn was at the end of the line of the northern branch that connected Heilbronn with Stuttgart and further fueled industrialization.

For a while Heilbronn suffered from the upheavals of the Baden Revolution that its civil guard participated in. During that time the 8th infantry regiment switched sides and joined the revolutionaries until it was subsequently disarmed and force-transferred out of the area.

In 1849, the Hoerner Bank, one of the oldest still functioning banks in Germany, was founded in Heilbronn.

Heilbronn became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany.

In the 1860s the city&#x27;s train tracks were extended to Heidelberg via Bad Wimpfen, to Würzburg via Osterburken, and to Crailsheim (and later on to Nuremberg) via Schwäbisch Hall. In 1880, the Kraichgau line was completed and created an important connection towards Karlsruhe, and by the end of the 19th century, Heilbronn had become an important hub, second in Wuerttemburg to Stuttgart in industrial output.

The year 1892 brought a connection to the power plant in Lauffen; thus Heilbronn became the first city in the world to enjoy long-distance electric power.

===1900–1945===
With the dissolution of monarchy in the German Reich as a result of World War I, Heilbronn became part of the Free People&#x27;s State of Württemberg in 1918.

After almost a century of economic boom and growth of the local industry Heilbronn&#x27;s citizenry included many labourers. The city came to be known as a &quot;red hot spot&quot;; numerous worker and sports clubs were begun. Already prior to World War I the SPD cornered the majority of the vote and stayed that course during the Weimar Republic. At his visit to the city on May 15, 1926, Hitler was clearly not welcome by everyone, and several people were injured when a man was mistaken for Hitler and attacked. Hitler himself was able to give his speech in the city&#x27;s community center &quot;Harmonie&quot;, but the SPD had the majority in Heilbronn over the NSDAP as late as the elections on March 5, 1933.

Richard Drauz, who had been born into a respected Heilbronn family, became Heilbronn&#x27;s NSDAP Kreisleiter (District Leader) in 1932. He was also elected to the Reichstag from 1933 on and pushed hard for the &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; of the Heilbronn clubs and press in Nazi Germany.

On July 28, 1935, the port was opened in a canal off the Neckar, and 1936 saw the Autobahn between Heilbronn and Stuttgart completed. Economy and infrastructure were booming in Württemberg, and Heilbronn was at the logistic centre of it all. As the result of a district reform on October 1, 1938, Heilbronn became the seat of the newly created Heilbronn County and regained independent city status. At the same time the previously independent communities of Böckingen, Sontheim, and Neckargartach were annexed, and with 72,000 residents Heilbronn then was the second largest city in Württemberg. The port turned into an important transfer station on the Neckar and one of the ten largest interior ports in the country.

On November 10, 1938, the Heilbronn synagogue was destroyed during the Kristallnacht. Soon thereafter the Jewish community was all but eliminated.

Starting in 1942 during World War II, the salt mines in and around Heilbronn were used to store art and artifacts from Germany, France, and Italy. Similarly, important producers of the war industry were moved into the mine shafts. The expansion of the shafts was undertaken by labour brigades of the concentration camp branches in Kochendorf and Neckargartach. From Heilbronn all the way to Neckarelz numerous subterraneous complexes, some of them gigantic, were constructed; on November 20, 1942, the Heilbronn Bureau of Labour had 8,000 forced labourers registered in its district.

In 1940 allied air raids began, and the city and its surrounding area were hit about 20 times with minor damage. On September 10, 1944, a raid by the allies targeted the city specifically, in particular the Böckingen train transfer station. As a result of 1,168 bombs dropped that day, 281 residents died. The city was carpet-bombed from the southern quarter all the way to the Kilianskirche in the center of town. The church was burnt out.

After a ten-day battle, with the allies advancing over the strategically important Neckar crossings, the war ended for the destroyed city, and it was occupied by the U.S. Army on April 12, 1945. Local NSDAP leader Richard Drauz became a fugitive because of executions of American prisoners of war he had ordered in March 1945. He was eventually arrested, tried, and hanged by the Allies in Landsberg on December 4, 1946.

===Second Half of the 20th Century===

After the war, Emil Beutinger, mayor until 1933, returned to office and began the formidable task of reconstruction that was subsequently continued by his successors Paul Metz and Paul Meyle. Milestones were the rededication of historic city hall in 1953 and the reopening of the community centre, &quot;Harmonie&quot;. Heilbronn was part of Württemberg-Baden until 1952, after which it became part of Baden-Württemberg.

After 1951, US troops were permanently stationed in Heilbronn. They used barracks built prior to World War II and added some structures of their own.

On April 15, 1954, during the Easter holiday 13 people from Heilbronn went missing in what is now known as the Dachstein hiking disaster.

The opening of the Autobahn A 6 from Heilbronn to Mannheim in 1968 was an important economic event. When the A 81 to Würzburg and the A 6 to Nuremberg was completed in 1974 and 1979, respectively, Heilbronn became an important logistical centre in southern Germany. As a result, many large companies opened offices in Heilbronn.

When Klingenberg became part of Heilbronn on January 1, 1970, the city&#x27;s population exceeded 100,000 for the first time; thus Heilbronn attained &quot;major city&quot; (&quot;Großstadt&quot;) status. During the last district reform in the 1970s, Kirchhausen, Biberach, Frankenbach and Horkheim were incorporated into Heilbronn, and the city was reconfirmed as independent city and seat of Heilbronn County. It was also declared seat of the newly formed Franken region, now Heilbronn-Franken.

Also during the 1970s, the centre of the city was transformed into a pedestrian zone and the rededication of the city theatre in 1982 closed one of the largest holes left in the inner city from World War II.

Pursuant to the NATO Double-Track Decision of 1979, Pershing II intermediate-range nuclear missiles were stationed just uphill of Heilbronn in the Waldheide. This made Heilbronn the only major city in Germany with atomic missiles inside its city limits — a fact that became front-page news during the missile accident on January 11, 1985. After the INF Treaty was signed in 1987, the missiles were removed.

In the 1980s, Heilbronn hosted &quot;Heimatttage&quot; and &quot;Landesgartenschau&quot; staged by the State of Baden-Württemberg.

=== 21st Century ===

In 1998, Heilbronn was connected to the S-Bahn net with Karlsruhe. This further transformed the city centre, and an extension of the S-Bahn towards Öhringen opened on December 10, 2005, marking the completion of the east–west axis of the Baden-Wuerttemburg regional transportation system. In 2013, the north–south axis to Neckarsulm was opened.

Heilbronn won the European competition &quot;Entente Florale 2000&quot; on September 9, 2000, in Broughshane, Northern Ireland, and in 2005–06 the city became the first UNICEF children&#x27;s city in Germany.

Late in 2005, Heilbronn was chosen to host the Bundesgartenschau in 2019. More than 2.3 million visitors came to the garden and city exhibition in 2019, which took place on a former commercial site of about 40 hectares located directly north of the main station. Now a part of the site is being developed into a new Urban district called Neckarbogen, where up to 3,500 people will live and 1,000 people will work in the future. The first buildings of the green and family-friendly quarter have been highly acclaimed and already received several awards.

Other major new buildings in the city area in recent years include two Neckar bridges, the two shopping centres Stadtgalerie and Klosterhof, the experimenta Science Center and the Bildungscampus.

In 2021, the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg decides to locate its new innovation park artificial intelligence in Heilbronn.

===Religion===

Ever since the Franks under Chlodwig settled in the Neckar region around 500 the area has been predominantly Christian and when Heilbronn was first mentioned in an official document in 741 Christian Michaelsbasilica, present day&#x27;s Kilianskirche, was mentioned along with the city. The Teutonic Knights constructed its church from the 13th century and both churches were continually expanded. They were joined later by other churches and cloisters in the city.
Around 1050 an important Jewish community was mentioned that had settled in what became known as the &quot;Judengasse&quot; (&quot;Lohtorstraße&quot;). In 1298, 143 Jews were killed during the Rintfleisch-Pogrom and in 1350 Jews suffered attacks again during a European epidemic of the Bubonic plague. The city&#x27;s constitution required the council to include Jews, but already in the middle of the 15th century Jews were the target of vigilantes again until they were evicted from the city in 1490 with the blessings of Emperor Frederick III.

The common Jewish name Halpern, and many variants such as Alpert, derive from the name of this city Heilbronn, and the early Jewish community there.

While Heilbronn was part of the Diocese of Würzburg, the independent villages of Böckingen, Neckargartach and Frankenbach were attached to the Diocese of Worms. From 1514 on the Heilbronn native Johann Lachmann was caretaker of the parish in St. Kilian, in 1521 he became its preacher, in 1524 he converted to Lutheranism and proceeded to teach and lead the Reformation in Heilbronn against the wishes of both dioceses. After the Protestant reformation of Heilbronn was complete the city remained Lutheran for centuries and the council and citizens accepted the Augsburg Confession without dissent. Catholics were no longer welcome, Jews were prohibited from settling in Heilbronn, and the city took part in the Protestation at Speyer on April 19, 1529 (the Protestation was the origin of the terms Protestant and Protestantism).

The Age of Enlightenment brought Heilbronn freedom of religion. From 1803 Jews were again permitted to settle in the city, Catholics also began to move back in and by the 1860s Jews were granted equal rights as Heilbronn citizens.

After the city became part of Württemberg in 1803 it also became seat of a deaconry and the Prelate or regional bishop of the Protestant State Church in Württemberg. To this day Protestants are in the majority in Heilbronn. The Catholic parishes belong to the Deacony Heilbronn and are part of the Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart.

Around 1920 first groups of &quot;Serious Bible Students&quot; (now: Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses) formed. Their small community suffered from oppression during the Third Reich and many of its members died in concentration camps. Similarly, the Jewish community had to watch as its colossal synagogue went up in flames and its 350 members were subsequently all but extinguished. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses built a first meeting room in Heilbronn in 1953 and many more have been added since then.

Since the 1970s, after guest workers and immigrants from Islamic or Russian-Orthodox countries settled here, these faiths are practiced by a growing part of the population and numerous mosques have been created since the 1990s in the city and county of Heilbronn.

===District reform===
Over the years, the following, formerly independent towns or communities, have been annexed to Heilbronn:
===Demographics===
Figures reflect city limits at the time and are estimates (until 1870) or Census data (¹), or official extensions thereof, counting only primary residences.

¹ Census data

==Government==
In connection with the district reform in the 1970s, municipal laws of Baden-Württemberg were amended to introduce borough councils for certain boroughs. Residents of such boroughs elect their borough council at each municipal election and the borough council must be consulted on all matters of significance to the respective borough. The Borough President also presides over the Borough Council. In Heilbronn the boroughs of Biberach, Böckingen, Frankenbach, Horkheim, Kirchhausen, Klingenberg, Neckargartach, and Sontheim have borough councils.

===City council===
After the municipal elections of May 26, 2019 the city council of Heilbronn was made up of 40 seats. Multiple members have since changed parties, resulting in the following distribution of seats:

===Mayor===
At first Heilbronn was governed by a regal advocate and an executor. Later, the city had two mayors but ever since the city was made part of Württemberg it has had just one mayor at a time.

===Representatives from Heilbronn===
The city of Heilbronn together with the northern municipalities of Heilbronn County makes up the electoral District 268 for national elections of representatives to the Bundestag.

For State elections to the Landtag of Baden-Württemberg Heilbronn makes up an electoral district (District 18) together with Erlenbach. Before the 2006 elections, it was an electoral district all by itself.

===Coat of arms===
Heilbronn&#x27;s coat of arms features a black eagle with red tongue and claws on golden background. The eagle is protected by a red, silver and blue shield. The city flag is red, white and blue.

The oldest seal of the city dates back to 1265. The eagle is the symbol for the imperial freedom enjoyed by Heilbronn until it was annexed by the Grand Duchy (and later Kingdom) of Württemberg. While it is established that it appeared for the first time with shield in 1556 to distinguish it from other versions of eagles, the origin of the colors of the shield has yet to be determined. The colors also appeared in reverse order in 1556, 1581 and 1681 and there have been other variations of colour as well, such as white rather than golden background.

Interesting is the fact that Heilbronn sports three colours in its flag. Newly dedicated municipal flags in Baden-Württemberg only use two colours. According to State municipal laws, Heilbronn&#x27;s flag was grandfathered as it had been in use prior to 1935.

== Culture ==

=== Language ===
Heilbronn is located near the border between the Swabian and the South Franconian dialects of the German language.

===Theater===
The Heilbronn municipal theatre on Berliner Platz was built between 1979 and 1982 and continues the tradition of the municipal theatre that was once located there. Together with the adjacent Logentheater of the Theaterforum K3, completed in 2001, the Salon 3 and the BOXX the Heilbronn Theatre offers drama, musical and opera performances.

The Theaterschiff Heilbronn, located on the Neckar river, also offers changing performances.

The young theatre label Tacheles and Tarantismus has created a place of encounter and dialogue with the theatre laboratory STILBRUCH. The programme includes in-house productions and own play developments, workshops with students, readings, performance pieces, concerts, open-stage formats and party series.

=== Museum ===
The Heilbronn&#x27;s municipal museum in the Deutschhof shows its art and sculpture collections as well as exhibits on the history of the city, archaeology and the history of the earth. The municipal art collection focuses on works by regional artists, including 18th and 19th century painters such as Heinrich Friedrich Füger and Carl Doerr as well as 20th century artists such as Heinrich Altherr and Hal Busse. There is also a special collection of small sculptures and bozzetti by international sculptors such as Wilhelm Lehmbruck and Henry Moore. The archaeology collection is in the tradition of the earlier municipal collection of ground finds founded by Alfred Schliz (1849-1915) and largely destroyed during the Second World War. Friedrich von Alberti (1795-1878), who gave the name Triassic to the sequence of Buntsandstein, Muschelkalk and Keuper, was particularly responsible for research into the history of the earth in and around Heilbronn.

The Deutschhof is also home to Haus der Stadtgeschichte (House of City History), which hosts a permanent exhibition on the city&#x27;s history by the Heilbronn City Archive. Admission to the permanent exhibitions of the municipal museums and the city archives is free, and the exhibition rooms are structurally connected. The municipal museums also run the Vogelmann Art Gallery together with the Heilbronn Art Association.

The Kunsthalle Vogelmann is a municipal exhibition hall in Heilbronn and focusses on modern art. The Kunsthalle was built in 2009/2010 as an extension of the municipal concert and congress center Harmonie.

The most important art associations in the city are the Kunstverein Heilbronn, which has existed with two new foundations since 1879 and has held more than 400 events since 1956, and the Künstlerbund, Heilbronn.

The Literaturhaus Heilbronn has opened in 2020. It is located in the Trappenseeschlösschen, a striking baroque building in the middle of a lake in the east of the city. With readings by contemporary authors, lectures, discussions, workshops and conferences as well as smaller temporary exhibitions, the Literaturhaus Heilbronn offers a variety of formats on the subject of literature and reading. Associated to the Literaturhaus is the Kleist Archiv Semdner, an archive and study center on the famous German author Heinrich von Kleist.

In 2009, experimenta, the largest science centre in southern Germany, opened in the Hagenbucher, a former storage building. The exhibition was expanded by 2019 with a new building, designed by Sauerbruch Hutton, an architecture practice based in Berlin, Germany.

=== Music ===
The Württemberg Chamber Orchestra Heilbronn (WKO), founded in 1960 by Jörg Faerber, is one of the best known German chamber orchestras.

Since 2015 the Classic Open Air Festival takes place in the city centre. With free admission and in the open air, orchestras and music groups from Heilbronn present themselves with a varied concert program.

The Heilbronn municipal music school is housed in the K3 theatre forum.

The jazz club Cave 61, founded in 1961, is a nationally known organizer of jazz concerts with jazz groups from all over the world. Its venue is an old theatre.

=== Other cultural venues ===
The city of Heilbronn supports various cultural projects, including the art and cultural workhouse Zigarre and Kommunales Kino in the Kulturkeller in the Gewerkschaftshaus as well as the free cultural center Maschinenfabrik, which started in 2021 in an old factory.

===Events===
In February the citizens of Heilbronn and the surrounding area have an opportunity to enjoy themselves at the Pferdemarkt. In May the Trollinger marathon takes place. The Heilbronner Volksfest on the Theresienwiese is the largest festival of its kind in Heilbronn. Each year it begins on the last Friday in July and ends on the second Monday in August. In September, people enjoy themselves at the Heilbronner Weindorf, in October at the Hafenmarkt and in November and December at the Weihnachtsmarkt, a Christmas market.

==Sport==
FC Heilbronn is a football club based in Heilbronn, Baden-Württemberg formed only recently – in 2003 – out of a merger between two former clubs with the elder dating back to 1896 and playing a five-year stint in the Regionalliga Süd (II) / 2nd Bundesliga Süd from 1969 to 1975.

Heilbronn hosts an annual tennis tournament Heilbronn Open (see Heilbronn Open website) which is part of the ATP Challenger tour.

Heilbronn is also the hometown of ice hockey team Heilbronner Falken (Heilbronn Falcons). The team currently plays in the second German ice hockey league. The Eisbären Heilbronn (Heilbronn polar bears) is the second ice hockey team, which is playing in the regional league South-West in Baden-Württemberg.

The „Red Devils“ Heilbronn is a wrestling team, which is part of the national wrestling league.

The city&#x27;s 68 sport clubs offer a wide range of different sporting activities and have around 30,000 members.

==Economy and infrastructure==

Viticulture has a long tradition in Heilbronn and is an important part of its economy to this day. Its 514 ha, two thirds of it growing red grapes, is the third largest vineyard in Württemberg&#x27;s vine-growing region after Brackenheim and Lauffen am Neckar. In 1888, the vintners of the Heilbronn area combined and formed the &quot;Weingärtnergesellschaft Heilbronn&quot;, a cooperative. In 1933, that cooperative then merged with the competing cooperative &quot;Winzergenossenschaft Heilbronn&quot; that had formed in 1919 and that cooperative again merged with the Vintner cooperatives of Erlenbach and Weinsberg to form the &quot;Genossenschaftskellerei Heilbronn-Erlenbach-Weinsberg&quot; with seat just outside the city limits in Erlenbach. In addition to the cooperative, numerous independent vintners are also located here.

South of the steam power plant is located the conveyor tower of the &quot;Südwestdeutsche Salzwerke AG&quot; (SWS). The SWS runs a salt mine in the Heilbronn area. That mine was connected through a tunnel with the now shut-down (since 1994) salt mine &quot;Kochendorf&quot; in Bad Friedrichshall. Extraction had extended the Heilbronn mine far to the west so that in 2004 a new shaft, &quot;Konradsberg&quot;, was added — probably the last mining shaft that was constructed in all of Germany.

===Infrastructure===
The city of Heilbronn is readily accessible by road courtesy of the Weinsberg Intersection just to the northeast of the city, the intersection of the Autobahn A 81 from Würzburg to Gottmadingen and the A 6 from Saarbrücken to Waidhaus. In addition to the Autobahns the city is connected via the Bundesstraßen B 27 from Blankenburg to Schaffhausen, B 39 from Frankenstein (Palatine) to Mainhardt and B 293 from Karlsruhe to Heilbronn that both run through the city itself.

Heilbronn is also a forerunner of right turn on red in Germany and 65 &quot;Green arrow&quot; signs have been installed at appropriate intersections since 1996.

Although Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof (central station) does not benefit from the Deutsche Bahn long-distance service, the city is well connected by train. The Franconia Railway (&quot;Frankenbahn&quot;) connects Stuttgart and Würzburg, the Neckar Valley Railway and Elsenz Valley Railway run from Heilbronn to Heidelberg and Mannheim, and the Hohenlohe Railway accommodates travel to Schwäbisch Hall via Öhringen.

The Heilbronn and Karlsruhe Stadtbahns provide a connection all the way to Karlsruhe on the Kraichgau Railway&#x27;s tracks. Currently the S 4 takes travellers from Karlsruhe through the central train station past the centre of town all the way to the Öhringen borough of Cappel (since December 11, 2005). Because of massive delays in the construction of the S-Bahn tracks through Heilbronn&#x27;s city limits and with the modernization and electrification of the existing tracks from Heilbronn to Öhringen meant that the new section&#x27;s official opening needed to be postponed several times. In the future, additional S-Bahn lines are planned to Neckarsulm, Lauffen am Neckar and Zaberfeld. As well a these new lines, additional stops will also be built in the inner city of Heilbronn. In 2014 the S-Bahn line to Neckarsulm was established.

Whilst the original &quot;Straßenbahn&quot; of Heilbronn, nicknamed the &quot;Spatzenschaukel&quot; (German for &quot;sparrows&#x27; swing&quot;), was discontinued on April 1, 1955, the city used electrically powered trolley buses until 1960. Today, public transportation is provided by the S-Bahn that runs through Heilbronn similar to the Karlsruhe model and this is complemented by buses run by the &quot;Stadtwerke Heilbronn (Verkehrsbetriebe)&quot; and several other enterprises. All now belong to the &quot;Heilbronner Verkehrsverbund&quot;.


The canal port on the Neckar is one of the ten largest German interior ports.

===Power plant===
In the industrial part of Heilbronn EnBW AG runs a large powerplant that is powered by coal. Its two chimneys (250 m tall) and cooling tower (140 m tall) are visible from afar, see Heilbronn Power Station.

===Transport===
The public light rail system with the lines S4, S41 and S42 (Heilbronn Stadtbahn) is run by the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft. The local bus system is run by the Stadtwerke Heilbronn (municipal utilities of Heilbronn). There are also various regional bus lines to the Zabergäu area, the Schozach/Bottwartal area, the Kraichgau area and the Kochertal area. These are run by OVR (a part of the Transdev group) and Regiobus Stuttgart (a part of DB Regio).

===Media===
Heilbronn is home to one of the studios of Südwestrundfunk (SWR). From here regional programmes like &quot;Frankenradio&quot; are broadcast on SWR4 Baden-Württemberg. The &quot;Heilbronner Stimme&quot; is a daily newspaper published in the city and the advertisers &quot;Neckar Express&quot;, &quot;echo am Mittwoch&quot; and &quot;echo am Sonntag&quot; are available weekly free of charge. Heilbronners also peruse the monthly city magazines &quot;Freizeit Journal&quot; and &quot;Moritz&quot;.

===Public service===

Several courts are located in Heilbronn, two belonging to the Stuttgart court district, a specialty court hearing labour issues, and a family court whose district includes the city of Heilbronn and the counties of Heilbronn, Ludwigsburg, Schwäbisch Hall, Hohenlohe and Main-Tauber.

The city is also the seat of the Prelature of Heilbronn and of the church district of Heilbronn (of the Protestant State Church as well as of the Heilbronn Deacony of the Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart).

===Education===
Heilbronn offers a wide range of higher education institutions developing very dynamically. In 2020, 9054 people were studying in Heilbronn, almost 60 percent more than ten years ago. On 1 February 2020 the Ministry of the Interior of Baden-Württemberg awarded the city of Heilbronn the designation of University City.

Heilbronn is the seat of the main campus of the &quot;Hochschule Heilbronn&quot;, founded in 1961 as a public engineering school. Since 1971 the school was known as the &quot;Fachhochschule Heilbronn&quot; (Heilbronn University) and has operated a secondary campus in Künzelsau since 1988. Starting with the fall semester on September 1, 2005, the Fachhochschule was awarded the status of a Hochschule. In 2009 a third campus in Schwäbisch Hall was established.

Today the business faculties of the Hochschule Heilbronn reside at the Bildungscampus of the Dieter Schwarz Foundation in the heart of Heilbronn along with the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University Heilbronn (DHBW Heilbronn), the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University - Center for Advanced Studies (DHBW CAS) as well as the Campus Heilbronn of the Technical University of Munich and other educational establishments and scientific institutions.

42 Heilbronn, a full-time tuition-free coding school, was established in 2021 nearby the Bildungscampus.

As far as general education is concerned, Heilbronn operates five college-track highschools or gymnasiums (&quot;Elly-Heuss-Knapp-Gymnasium&quot;, &quot;Justinus-Kerner-Gymnasium&quot;, &quot;Mönchsee-Gymnasium&quot;, &quot;Robert-Mayer-Gymnasium&quot; and &quot;Theodor-Heuss-Gymnasium&quot;), four non-college-track highschools or &quot;Realschulen&quot; (&quot;Dammrealschule&quot;, &quot;Helene-Lange-Realschule&quot;, &quot;Heinrich-von-Kleist-Realschule&quot; in Böckingen and &quot;Mörike-Realschule&quot;). There are also six special-education schools run by the city &quot;Wilhelm-Hofmann-Förderschule&quot;, &quot;Pestalozzi-Förderschule&quot;, and &quot;Paul-Meyle-Schule&quot; for the mentally and physically impaired, two special-education schools run by Heilbronn County (&quot;Gebrüder-Grimm-Schule&quot; for the speech impaired and &quot;Hermann-Herzog-Schule&quot; for the seeing impaired), and the &quot;Lindenparkschule&quot;, which is run by the state of Baden-Württemberg for the hearing and speech impaired. The latter also includes a boarding school and consultation centre.

City primary schools are the &quot;Damm-Grundschule&quot;, &quot;Deutschorden-Grundschule Kirchhausen&quot;, &quot;Grundschule Horkheim&quot;, &quot;Grundschule Klingenberg&quot;, &quot;Grünewaldschule Grundschule Böckingen&quot;, &quot;Reinöhlschule Grundschule Böckingen&quot;, &quot;Silcherschule Grundschule&quot; and &quot;Uhlandschule Grundschule Sontheim&quot;. Grammar and middle schools (some include vocational training programs) are &quot;Albrecht-Dürer-Schule Neckargartach&quot;, &quot;Elly-Heuss-Knapp-Schule Böckingen&quot;, &quot;Fritz-Ulrich-Schule Böckingen&quot;, &quot;Gerhart-Hauptmann-Schule&quot;, &quot;Grund- und Hauptschule mit Werkrealschule Biberach&quot;, &quot;Grund- und Hauptschule mit Werkrealschule Frankenbach&quot;, &quot;Ludwig-Pfau-Schule&quot;, &quot;Rosenauschule&quot;, &quot;Staufenbergschule Sontheim&quot;, &quot;Wartbergschule&quot; and &quot;Wilhelm-Hauff-Schule&quot;.

The &quot;Gustav-von-Schmoller-Schule&quot; and the &quot;Technische Schulzentrum Heilbronn&quot; consisting of the &quot;Johann-Jakob-Widmann-Schule&quot; and the &quot;Wilhelm-Maybach-Schule&quot; are professional training schools run by the city. The county runs the &quot;Andreas-Schneider-Schule&quot; and &quot;Christiane-Herzog-Schule&quot;, and in the fall of 2005 the &quot;Peter-Bruckmann-Schule&quot; was added to the already operating professional training schools.

Finally, the following private schools round out the education options offered in Heilbronn:
* The &quot;Abendrealschule Heilbronn e.V.&quot; allows students with middle school diplomas to achieve the first in a series of steps to gain college entrance prerequisites on a part-time basis after work.

===Crime===
A female police officer, Michéle Kiesewetter, was in 2007 fatally shot in Heilbronn, an event that gave its name to the so-called Phantom of Heilbronnan elusive serial killer hunted by German police for several years. The &quot;Phantom&quot; was in March 2009 revealed not be a serial killer, but the result of procedural errors by the German police. In 2011 the police discovered that Kiesewetter was murdered by National Socialist Underground terrorists.

<text>Saltholm (; &quot;Salt Islet&quot;) is a Danish island in the Øresund, the strait that separates Denmark and Sweden. It is located to the east of the Danish island of Amager in Tårnby municipality and lies just to the west of the sea border between Denmark and Sweden. The island is 7 km long and 3 km across at its widest point. With an area of 16 km2, it is Denmark&#x27;s 21st largest island. Saltholm is very flat; its highest point stands only 2 m (6 ft) above sea level, rendering it vulnerable to flooding if persistent east winds cause a tidal surge in the Baltic Sea. It is a relatively new landmass in geological terms, having risen from the sea about 4,000 years ago due to post-glacial rebound, and is surrounded by a large area of shallow water (of 2 m depth or less) that covers an area of . A series of islets, inlets and rock deposits from the last ice age appear at the south end of the island.

Its neighboring island to the south is the artificial island Peberholm (&quot;Pepper Islet&quot;), which is a part of the Øresund Bridge and was named to complement Saltholm. Sometimes, Saltholm and its neighboring island to the north, Ven, are referred to as the Øresund Islands.

==Flora and fauna==
Saltholm&#x27;s vegetation is dominated primarily by grasses, with its landscape consisting mainly of flat chalk meadowlands and coastal meadow. There are few trees on Saltholm, clustered mainly in two places in the north and south-west of the island. The island has a rich variety of flora, notably motherwort (&quot;Leonurus cardiaca&quot;), henbane (&quot;Hyoscyamus niger&quot;), blue iris (&quot;Iris spuria&quot;) and chickweed.

Saltholm is a protected nature reserve for wild birds which nest in large numbers on the island. The southern part of the island, an extensive salt marsh, is protected under the Ramsar Convention. The island as a whole, along with the surrounding area of sea, has been designated a nature reserve by the European Union, as well as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. Mussel beds, eel grass, snails, crustaceans and fish in the shallow waters around the island provide an important food source for water birds. Because of its importance as a wildlife sanctuary, access to Saltholm and its surrounding waters is strictly controlled. Access to the island is via a small harbour at Barakkebro, at the north end of Saltholm.

The island is Denmark&#x27;s largest grazing area for geese, some 7,000 of which visit during the summer. Around 3,500 juvenile swans also live on the island in the summer, with some 2,000 wintering there. 10,000–12,000 ducks breed and graze on Saltholm during autumn and late winter/spring. Saltholm is also home to Europe&#x27;s largest breeding colony of eiders; 15,000 live on the island during the spring and some 7,000–8,000 are hatched on the island each year.

==History==
Humans have lived in small numbers on Saltholm since the Middle Ages and probably before. The population has decreased from a peak of 298 people in 1916, when the island was fortified during World War I, to two people .

The existence of the island is first attested in 1230, when King Valdemar II of Denmark is recorded as having given Saltholm to Bishop Niels Stigsen of the see of Roskilde. For centuries, the island was used to quarry limestone, which was used in nearby Copenhagen and elsewhere; in 1289, the town lord of Copenhagen is recorded to have granted quarrying rights on Saltholm and quarrying continued until as late as 1935. The island was also traditionally used as pasture land for the cattle of the people of the nearby Danish island of Amager. The cows of Saltholm were commemorated in the late 19th century by the Danish painter Theodor Philipsen, who travelled frequently to the island to paint its cattle and treeless landscapes.

Saltholm was used as a quarantine station between 1709 and 1711 when Copenhagen suffered plague and cholera outbreaks. Travellers wishing to land in the city were required to stay in quarantine on the island for 40 days. In 1873, a private company, the Saltholmlaug, acquired the island from the state and still owns it today.

The island&#x27;s position in the middle of the Øresund gave it some military significance during the two World Wars. In 1912, the Danish government constructed the Flakfortet (sand-shoal fort) on the Salthom Flak sands just north of the island proper, stationing a number of artillery pieces ranging in calibre from 47 mm to 290 mm. Most of the guns were mounted on barbette carriages and protected by armoured shields and concrete and earthen ramparts. The fort was still active at the start of World War II; although old, its guns were still seen as a strong deterrent.

Saltholm was the site of an incident resulting in the loss of the British submarine HMS &quot;E13&quot;, which ran aground on the island on 17 August 1915 due to a faulty compass. Two days later, two German destroyers attacked the submarine while it was still stranded on the shoreline as the crew worked to refloat the vessel. Fifteen of the submariners were killed before Danish torpedo boats intervened to deter the attackers. The violation of the country&#x27;s neutrality outraged the Danish government, prompting a diplomatic protest to the Germans, and the casualties were given high-profile official funerals by the Danish navy. The surviving crew were interned in Denmark until the end of the war in November 1918, and the wrecked submarine was scrapped. The commander of the &quot;E13&quot;, Lt Cdr Geoffrey Layton, went on to have a distinguished career in the Royal Navy and commanded the British Eastern Fleet during the Second World War.

The island was for many years considered as a possible location for a new international airport and fixed link between Denmark and Sweden. The nearby Copenhagen Airport at Kastrup has long been the busiest airport in Scandinavia but has suffered from an acute shortage of space and its proximity to built-up areas. In 1965, the Nordic Council agreed in principle to build a new international airport on Saltholm, to replace the airport at Kastrup, and to construct a bridge-and-tunnel link across the island to connect Copenhagen and Malmö. The proposal was strongly supported by Scandinavian Airlines System, the main user of Copenhagen Airport. The plan envisaged building two pairs of runways, which would carry up to 20 million passengers a year by 1990. A bridge would connect it to Malmö and a tunnel would link to Kastrup on the Danish side. The project was costed at the equivalent of £250 million in 1967 (£3.1 billion / €3.4 billion at 2009 prices).

The plan was approved by the Danish parliament in 1969 with completion scheduled for 1985. However, it was repeatedly delayed; contributory factors included the 1973 oil crisis and its economic fallout, a slump in air travel, and opposition from campaigners concerned about the impact on the fragile environment in the Øresund and around the island. The plan was abandoned in 1979 and further investment was made in Copenhagen Airport instead. When the Øresund fixed link was eventually built in the 1990s, it was routed 1 km south of Saltholm to avoid damaging the island and the surrounding shallow waters.

<doc id="306490" wikidata="Q257618" url="?curid=306490" title="Waterloo, New South Wales">
<text>Waterloo is an inner southern suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Waterloo is located three kilometres (1.9 mi) south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. Waterloo is surrounded by the suburbs of Redfern and Darlington to the north, Eveleigh and Alexandria to the west, Rosebery to the south, and Moore Park, Zetland, and Kensington to the east.

==History==

Waterloo took its name from the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, when Allied and Prussian forces under the Duke of Wellington and Blücher defeated the French forces under Napoleon Bonaparte.

In the 1820s, Waterloo began supporting industrial operations including various mills such as the Fisher and Duncan Paper Mill and the Waterloo Flour Mill.

The Paper Mill was a partnership with three partners (Frederick George James Fisher, George Duncan and John Walker. Established in 1818 it is the first mill known to produce paper in Australia.

The &quot;Lachlan and Waterloo Flour Mills&quot; Waterloo Flour Mills was originally a partnership with Thomas White Melville Winder and Samuel Terry in 1820 with a flour mill established in what is now Kensington. Six partners made up the new partnership including William Hutchinson, Daniel Cooper, Thomas White Melville Winder, Samuel Terry, George Williams and William Leverton trading as Hutchinson, Terry &amp; Co. William Hutchinson, superintendent of convicts and public works, had been granted of land in 1823 in the Waterloo area what had previously a water powered flour mill developed (c. 1818). The other partners sold out to existing partner Daniel Cooper in 1825 and new partner Solomon Levey. These two became the sole owners of the Waterloo Co., which was generally known as Cooper &amp; Levey. Cooper later bought out Levey&#x27;s share and on his death the Waterloo Estate passed onto his nephew, also named Daniel Cooper, who was the first speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. This part of Waterloo was part of Daniel Cooper&#x27;s landholding before being subdivided in the 1880s.

In 1974, the Builders Labourers Federation placed a green ban against the construction of demolition of low-income housing to make way for new apartments.

==Location==

Waterloo is historically a working-class region. Since early 2000s, the region has undergone some degree of gentrification with a rising business district focusing on technology-oriented firms and the development of more green space such as parks. By 2006, median individual income in Waterloo was slightly higher than the Australian average.

Nevertheless, the suburb maintains a large housing commission estate shared with Redfern with around 4,000 tenants. The Waterloo estate is set for a facelift, with the older flats/tower blocks getting redeveloped into large luxury apartment blocks mixing social housing with affordable housing alongside the new Metro station being developed nearby.

New development and redevelopment in this area is encouraged to be sympathetic to the existing heritage style.

Green Square is a district in the south and east of the suburb including the suburbs of Waterloo and Zetland that is being redeveloped. It involves an urban renewal program which has seen many industrial buildings redeveloped or replaced by new residential and commercial developments. The area adjacent to South Dowling Street contains many high-rise apartment buildings with retail space at ground level.

In January 2019, the Government of New South Wales released a redevelopment masterplan of the Waterloo social housing estate. The government&#x27;s plan outlines a 20-year vision for the area, which is about 4 kilometres from the Sydney CBD. It will include building 6,800 new homes and will comprise 6 high-rise buildings of 33 to 40 storeys.

==Transport==
Waterloo is serviced by Transdev John Holland routes to the Sydney CBD. Green Square station, on the Airport line of the Sydney Trains network, is located in the south-west corner of the suburb. Redfern railway station is located close to the north-west corner of the suburb.

The to Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line line includes Waterloo station which opened in August 2024. There will also be large commercial and residential redevelopment to service the new Metro.

==Churches==

Waterloo hosts the city campus of Hillsong Church (affiliated with the Assemblies of God). Other churches include Grace City Anglican Church, Shrine and Parish of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church, Waterloo Congregational Church, South Sydney Uniting Church and Waterloo Salvation Army.

==Demographics==
At the , Waterloo had a population of 16,379, compared to 14,616 at the . 

In 2021, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.8% of the population and 37.2% of people were born in Australia. The other most common countries of birth were China 11.5%, England 5.6%, New Zealand 2.6%, Ireland 2.3% and Brazil 1.8%. 45.2% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 12.0% Cantonese 3.0%, Spanish 3.2%, Russian 2.7% and Portuguese 1.6%. The largest religions were Catholicism (16.5% of the population), Buddhism (4.4%) and Anglicanism (4.2%). Furthermore, 50.2% of the population marked no religion, well above the national average. 91.1% of residences were units, well above the rest of Australia (where only 14.2% of residences were units). Furthermore, 72.7% of dwellings were rented, compared to 30.6% in Australia as a whole.

==Recreation==
The Waterloo Skate Park is a modern skate park and the first of its kind to copy the urban streetscape layout of popular skate spots like Martin Place and Cathedral Square in Sydney. The park is located next to Waterloo Oval and the Weave Youth Services (formerly South Sydney Youth Services) building on Elizabeth Street.

<text>Redfern is an inner southern suburb of Sydney located south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. Strawberry Hills is a locality on the border with Surry Hills. The area experienced the process of gentrification and is subject to extensive redevelopment plans by the state government, to increase the population and reduce the concentration of poverty in the suburb and neighbouring Waterloo (see Redfern-Eveleigh-Darlington).

==History==
The suburb is named after surgeon William Redfern, who was granted of land in this area in 1817 by Lachlan Macquarie. He built a country house on his property surrounded by flower and kitchen gardens. His neighbours were Captain Cleveland, an officer of the 73rd regiment, who built Cleveland House and John Baptist, who ran a nursery and seed business. Sydney&#x27;s original railway terminus was built in Cleveland Paddocks and extended from Cleveland Street to Devonshire Street and west to Chippendale. The station&#x27;s name was chosen to honour William Redfern. At that time, the present Redfern station was known as Eveleigh. When Central station was built further north on the site of the Devonshire Street cemetery, Eveleigh station became Redfern and Eveleigh was retained for the name of the Eveleigh Railway Workshops, south of the station. The remains of Cleveland Paddocks became Prince Alfred Park.

In August 1859, Redfern was incorporated as a borough. The Municipality of Redfern merged with the City of Sydney from 1 January 1949. The first recorded and codified game of Australian rules football in NSW was played in Redfern on the Albert Ground, Redfern between the Rugby Union Club, Waratah, and the Carlton Football Club from Melbourne.

On 17 January 1908, the South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby football club was formed at Redfern Town Hall to compete in the first season of the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership.

In the 1960s and 70s, &quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot; trees were planted in Baptist Street in attempts to green and improve the physical environment. The notorious Redfern Mail Exchange was built in 1965, after 300 people were evicted from their homes on the site. It became the scene of many industrial disputes when the automatic mail-sorting machinery, which was supposed to sort mail more efficiently, destroyed many letters and became known as the Redfern Mangler.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, a black power movement, centred around Aboriginal Australian migrants to the city, formed and resulted in the creation of health clinics, food drives, housing co-operatives and a legal aid centre. A green ban helped save the Redfern Aboriginal Centre in the 1970s and activists from Redfern created the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra.

The 2004 Redfern riots began on 14 February 2004, at the end of Eveleigh Street outside Redfern station, sparked by the death of Thomas &#x27;TJ&#x27; Hickey. The teenager, riding on his bicycle, was allegedly being chased by a police vehicle, which led to his impalement on a fence. Members of his family were then reported to have started grieving for TJ around Eveleigh Street with a crowd gathering commiserating with the family. Fliers were distributed blaming police for TJ&#x27;s death. The police closed the Eveleigh Street entrance to the railway station, but youths in the crowd became violent, throwing bricks and bottles; this escalated into a riot. A subsequent inquest found that although the police were following Hickey, they had not caused the accident, a verdict that caused controversy in Redfern&#x27;s Indigenous community. The riots sparked fresh debate into the welfare of Indigenous Australians and the response of the police to those living in the Redfern area.

== Buildings ==
===Commercial area===
The main shopping strip is located on Redfern Street, east of Redfern railway station. There are also commercial developments nearby, along Regent Street and surrounding streets. The Redfern skyline is dominated by the TNT Towers and two residential blocks located between Regent Street and Gibbons Street, beside Redfern railway station.

===Transport===

Redfern railway station, located on the western edge of the suburb is a major station on the Sydney Trains network. Redfern is the first station south from Central Sydney terminus on the edge of the city. Redfern station is the closest station to the main campus of the University of Sydney at Camperdown and Darlington. A near-constant stream of commuters flows from the station along the south side of Lawson Street towards the university in the morning, and back towards the station in a largely hourly rhythm in the afternoon.

===Housing===

Redfern has many examples of Victorian terraced housing similar to other inner suburbs, such as Surry Hills and Paddington. Also, like some other inner-city suburbs, some parts of Redfern have been gentrified, whilst still retaining a large public housing estate shared with Waterloo, consisting of flats, terrace houses and high rise apartment blocks, developing a similar reputation to the former block on the other side of the suburb.

===Churches and schools===
St Vincent de Paul Catholic Church is on Redfern Street. St Saviour&#x27;s Anglican Church (which is also known as one1seven church) is on Young Street. St George Antioch Orthodox Church is on the corner of Walker Street and Cooper Street built by the historic Lebanese community in the area. The Greek Orthodox Church in Cleveland Street is called the Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady, formerly St Paul&#x27;s Church of England built in 1848 and designed by Edmund Blacket. The St Andrew&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Theological College sits beside it. Hillsong Church&#x27;s city campus is at 188 Young Street. There is also another cathedral, the St Maroun’s Cathedral for the Lebanese community.

===Heritage buildings===

Redfern has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
*242 Cleveland Street: Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady
* Elizabeth, Redfern, Chalmers, and Phillip Streets: Redfern Oval
* 18 George Street: Redfern Aboriginal Children&#x27;s Services
* Main Suburban railway line: Eveleigh Chief Mechanical Engineer&#x27;s office, Eveleigh Railway Workshops and machinery
* Main Suburban railway line: Redfern railway station
* 6–18 Pitt Street: Fitzroy Terrace, Redfern
* 113 Redfern Street: Redfern Post Office

===Other notable buildings===
The Aboriginal Dance Theatre Redfern is at 82–88 Renwick Street.

==Demographics==

At the , Redfern had a population of 13,072, compared to 14,616 at the . 

In 2021, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people making up 3.2% of the population and 52.0% of the population were born overseas. The most common countries of birth were England 4.8%, China 4.3%, New Zealand 3.0%, United States of America 1.4% and India 1.4%. 65.0% of the population only spoke English at home, with the most important other languages being Mandarin (3.6%), Spanish (2.9%), Cantonese (2.1%), Greek (1.5%) and Russian (1.4%). 53.7% of the population marked no religion, higher than the national average. 14.2% were Catholic, 4.8% Anglican and 3.5% Buddhist.

Redfern has become increasingly gentrified, with many medium and high density developments replacing low density and industrial developments. In 2021, 68.1% of residences were flats and 28.6% were semi-detached, row or terrace house, townhouse etc.

Redfern has been characterised by successive migrant populations. In the late 19th century, local businessmen George Dan in 1890, Stanton and Aziz Melick in 1888 and Shafiqah Shasha and Anthony and Simon Coorey in the 1890s were from Lebanon.

==Community==

&#x27;The Block&#x27; is an area in the immediate vicinity of Redfern station bounded by Eveleigh, Caroline, Louis and Vine Streets. The Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC) was set up as the first urban Aboriginal community housing provider, using grant money to purchase the houses on the Block. As a result, the area is important to the Aboriginal community. Eveleigh Street, which is part of &#x27;The Block&#x27;, is well known for its community. In 2004, much of the Eveleigh Street housing was demolished with plans for redevelopment, but it is still an area around which many people congregate. The AHC&#x27;s plans for redevelopment are known as the Pemulwuuy Project. The plans were approved in 2009.

Artwork on the outside of the local police boys club (PCYC) was made in the early 1990s. The front wall has a mural of a picture taken at Cleveland Street High School of a day when Dwayne &quot;the D Train&quot; McClain (former Sydney Kings player) visited the school. The picture has local sports stars such as Richard Bell, Bruce Swanson, Rossie Symmans, Nicholas Murray, Nathan Denzil, Jamie Sharpe, Lisa Mundine and Margaret Sutherland. The mural was painted by probably the most notable artist of the 90&#x27;s in the Redfern district, Sir Joseph Phillips.

== Sport and recreation ==
A number of sporting teams represent the local area. The South Sydney Rabbitohs NRL club was formed at the Redfern Town Hall on 17 January 1908. One of the oldest Aboriginal rugby league teams in Australia, the Redfern All Blacks, play at Redfern Oval. The Redfern Raiders Soccer Club is a local Junior Soccer Club. Redfern Gym opened in 1985 and many boxing world champions have trained there.

Nikita Ridgeway established Australia&#x27;s first indigenous hip-hop record label with her brother Stephen. Called Redfern Records, the label was named after the Sydney neighbourhood of Redfern they grew up in. A wall with a mural dedicated to one of the first Women in Rugby League was painted to honour Maggie Moloney, in 2022.

==Streets and Squares==

===St Paul&#x27;s Place===

St Paul&#x27;s Place is at the intersection of Cleveland Street and Regent Street in Redfern, bordering the suburb of Chippendale.

Named in 1924, the square is the subject and title of the 1995 oil painting by Archibald prize-winning artist Nicholas Harding and is the current official place name according to the City of Sydney Spatial Services department as of 2023.

==== History ====

In 1915, the site is pictured as the intersection of two tram lines. The square was officially named St Paul&#x27;s Place in 1924. Correspondence relating to the naming of the intersection is documented in the Town Clerk&#x27;s Department Correspondence Files between 7 October 1924 and 19 December 1924.

The site also goes by the name St Paul&#x27;s Square in the Dictionary of Sydney and on the City of Sydney History of Prince Alfred Park website.

On 25 January 1930, the Sydney Morning Herald reported the City Commissioners and the Main Roads Board agreed to progressively widen Cleveland Street between the Princes Highway and St Paul&#x27;s Place, and between St Paul&#x27;s Place and Chalmers Street.

The square is portrayed in a number of photos held in the City of Sydney Archives.

In the 1930s the road was re-aligned and resurfaced. City of Sydney archive photos depict the road before
 and after, however it is unclear whether the metadata specifies a date of 1939 or 1933. Towards the south-east a Shell Service Station and the Camden Vale Milk Co Ltd building is visible in these photos and described in the captions.

In 1954 a nameplate was installed bearing the name, along with four directional signs to St Pauls Church (now named Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady).

A 1980 photograph depicted heavy traffic, and political graffiti where advertisements are currently located.

In 1991 the square was named in multiple photographs, one mentioning the road being widened and one stating &quot;The intersection has been widened so that the traffic crossing Cleveland Street get a straighter flow.&quot;

==== Depictions in art ====

Between 1993 and 1995, Archibald prize winning artist Nicholas Harding created the painting titled &quot;St Paul&#x27;s Place, Redfern&quot;. He used oil on canvas on hardboard. It was most recently exhibited at the S.H Ervin gallery in The Rocks, in the exhibition &quot;Margaret Olley: painter, peer, mentor, muse&quot; in 2017. It is in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

==== Depictions in maps ====

The City of Sydney Aerial Photographic Survey of 1949 displays photographs 82 and 83 with St Pauls Place in the title.

The 1939 - 1952 City of Sydney Civic Survey depicts St Paul&#x27;s Place on the map of Redfern (Map 18).

In 2004, the square was depicted in the UBD Street Directory as St Paul&#x27;s Place.

The City of Sydney Spatial Services department of the City of Sydney names St Paul&#x27;s Place as the site name of the intersection in their internal GIS software as of 2023. The address of the intersection, with object 14244 is recorded as 4010 St Paul&#x27;s Place, Redfern, 2016.

==== Advertising in St Paul&#x27;s Place ====

In 1999, a development application for two sign structures to be built on council land was rejected.

As of August 2024, OpenStreetMap depicts at least 19 large format advertising billboards in St Paul&#x27;s Place.

==== Future ====

The Redfern Estate Heritage Conservation Area page on the Department of Planning and Environment website in 2021 stated that recommended management included &quot;Interpret original subdivision of Redfern Estate, and St Pauls Place&quot; under &quot;Protection of Significance&quot;, and &quot;Interpret St. Pauls Place&quot; under &quot;Enhance Significance of Area&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The 2011 Australian drama series &quot;&quot; and 2012 Australian drama series &quot;Redfern Now&quot; were filmed on location in Redfern.

<text>Ioșia (; ) is an outlying quarter (or district) in Oradea, Romania. It is a mix of both high-rise housing blocks built in Communist times as well as low-density housing. The quarter is an exurban environment — that is, in between a rural area and a suburban environment. It is located in the city&#x27;s far southwest, and, although there is good infrastructure in terms of education, shopping, and, to some extent, transportation, the quarter still has a significant number of unpaved roads and country-style houses. Ioșia is usually divided into three areas: Ioșia Nord, Calea Aradului, and between those two, Ioșia Veche.

Of the three areas of Ioșia, Ioșia Nord is the most developed, having 2 high schools, 1 kindergarten, 1 swimming pool, many supermarkets and a direct transportation line to the University of Oradea (being one of the two districts which have direct transportation to the University). It is also a beautiful place to take a walk, mainly because of the Crișul Repede river which separates Ioșia Nord from the Rogerius district.

Calea Aradului, lying on the southern part of Oradea, is, as its name says, the way to Arad, another county in Romania. The Oradea Airport is located here, at the town exit.

Ioșia Veche (Old = Vechi in Romanian) is entirely composed of houses, being the only one of the three areas with some unpaved roads.

The quarter is one of the most beautiful in Oradea because it maintains a rustic, rural feel which still being relatively built-up and close to the city. For tourists, it provides insight into Romanian country life while still being in the city close to all the excellent facilities that Oradea is home to. In Oradea, there is a stereotype about people from Ioșia as being fairly uneducated in comparison to more inner-city urbanites, even though this is changing fast as real estate prices are increasing in the city centre and wealthy people are building large houses (villas) in Ioșia. This neighborhood, is used to belong to the actual Santandrei village, most of the elders living in the area of Ioșia are former Sântandrei village residents.</text><links>
