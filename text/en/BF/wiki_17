<text>The MTV Video Music Awards (commonly abbreviated as the VMAs) is an award show presented by the cable channel MTV to honor the best in the music video medium. Originally conceived as an alternative to the Grammy Awards (in the video category), the annual MTV Video Music Awards ceremony has often been called the Super Bowl for youth, an acknowledgment of the VMA ceremony&#x27;s ability to draw millions of youth from teens to 20-somethings each year. By 2001, the VMA had become a coveted award.

The annual VMA ceremony occurs before the end of summer and held either in late August or mid-September, and broadcast live on MTV, along with a &quot;roadblock&quot; simulcast across MTV&#x27;s sister networks since 2014, which is utilized to maximize the ceremony&#x27;s ratings. The first VMA ceremony was held in 1984 at New York City&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall. The ceremonies are normally held in either New York City or Los Angeles. However, the ceremonies have also been hosted in Miami, Las Vegas, and Newark, New Jersey.

The statue given to winners is an astronaut on the Moon, one of the earliest representations of MTV, and was colloquially called a &quot;moonman&quot;, though it has been called a &quot;moon person&quot; by MTV since the 2017 ceremony. The statue was conceived by Manhattan Design, who were also designers of the original MTV logo, based on the 1981 Top of the Hour animation created by Fred Seibert and produced by Alan Goodman and Buzz Potamkin at Buzzco Associates. The statue is now made by Society Awards, a New York City-based firm. Since the 2006 ceremony, viewers are able to vote for their favorite videos in all general categories by visiting MTV&#x27;s website.

Taylor Swift is the most awarded solo artist in the history of the VMAs, having won 30 trophies between 2009 and 2024, which includes record-breaking five Video of the Year VMAs (&quot;Bad Blood&quot;, &quot;You Need To Calm Down&quot;, &quot;All Too Well: The Short Film&quot;, &quot;Anti-Hero&quot; and &quot;Fortnight&quot;).

==Notable moments==
===1980s===

1984: at the first MTV Video Music Awards in 1984, Madonna performed her hit &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; wearing a combination bustier/wedding gown, including her trademark &quot;Boy Toy&quot; belt. During the performance, she rolled around on the floor, revealing lace stockings and a garter. Cyndi Lauper spoke in &quot;&quot;Exorcist&quot;-esque gibberish&quot; to explain the VMA rules right before winning the Best Female video for &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot;. David Bowie, the Beatles and director Richard Lester were rewarded with the first ever Video Vanguard Awards for their work in pioneering the music video. The Cars&#x27; &quot;You Might Think&quot; won the very first video of the year, beating out Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; and Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Rockit&quot;.

1987: At the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, Peter Gabriel won ten awards, including the Video Vanguard Award and Video of the Year for his video &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, holding the VMA record for most Moonmen in a single night.

1988: At the 1988 MTV Video Music Awards, Michael Jackson appeared for the first time. A pre-recorded live performance of &quot;Bad&quot; was shown.&quot; He was also awarded the Video Vanguard Award, which was later renamed in his honor.

1989: Comedian Andrew Dice Clay appeared at the &quot;1989 Video Music Awards&quot; to promote his new movie, &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot;, earning a &quot;lifetime ban&quot; from the network when he introduced Cher with some of his recently notorious nursery rhymes that contained vulgar language and references. After performing with Tom Petty, Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin was assaulted by Mötley Crüe lead singer Vince Neil, leading to a verbal battle between Neil and Guns N&#x27; Roses lead singer Axl Rose.

Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora turned out a stripped-down acoustic performance of the Bon Jovi hits &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive and &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;, and in the process possibly provided the inspirational spark for MTV Unplugged.

Paula Abdul was nominated for six awards, picking up four wins. She performed a seven-minute medley of her singles &quot;Straight Up&quot;, &quot;Cold Hearted&quot;, and &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;.

When Madonna won the Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award (sponsored by Pepsi-Cola) for her &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; video, she thanked Pepsi-Cola in her acceptance speech &quot;for causing so much controversy&quot;. Pepsi-Cola had paid Madonna $5 million to appear in a commercial that would predominantly feature the world premiere of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;; the commercial, titled &quot;Make a Wish&quot;, depicted Madonna drinking Pepsi and watching a home video of her eighth birthday. The tone that the commercial sought to convey sharply contrasted with the music video. When Pepsi executives saw the video, they yanked the advertisement after only two airings, in an attempt to dissociate themselves from Madonna. She also gave one of the most memorable performances of her hit &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, as a preview of what would become her Blond Ambition World Tour.

===1990s===

1990: at the &quot;1990 MTV Video Music Awards&quot;, Madonna performed her single &quot;Vogue&quot;, which featured Madonna and her backup dancers dressed in an 18th-century French theme, with Madonna bearing great resemblance to Marie Antoinette. The performance consisted of both a dramatic historical reinterpretation of &quot;Vogue&quot; as well as her dramatically becorseted breasts.

1991: during the award show the MTV Video Vanguard Award was renamed to the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award from then on, in honor of his contributions to the culture of music videos by changing them from a mere promotional tool featuring musicians playing instruments and singing, to a &quot;short film&quot; with a storyline. His video &quot;Thriller&quot; influenced and changed music videos into what it is like today.

A conflict between Poison&#x27;s Bret Michaels and C.C. DeVille culminated in a fistfight at the &quot;1991 MTV Video Music Awards&quot;. DeVille was fired and replaced by Pennsylvanian guitarist Richie Kotzen. Paul Reubens had his first public appearance, during the opening montage, following an arrest for lewd-conduct earlier that year. Taking the stage in costume as Pee-wee Herman, he received a standing ovation, after which he asked the audience, &quot;Heard any good jokes lately?&quot;. After his appearance, Van Halen made their television debut, performing &quot;Poundcake&quot;. Metallica was another highlight of the performances with &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;.

Prince and The New Power Generation performed their sexually charged song &quot;Gett Off&quot; on a Caligula-esque set, with Prince dressed in a yellow mesh outfit which infamously exposed his buttocks. His trousers were parodied numerous times throughout the following year, on the sketch comedy TV series &quot;In Living Color&quot;, and even at the following year&#x27;s VMAs by radio shock jock Howard Stern. It also marked the final TV appearance of Kiss with Eric Carr prior to Carr&#x27;s death in November 1991.

1992: in the 1992 show, MTV requested Nirvana perform &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, while the band itself had indicated it preferred to play new songs &quot;Rape Me&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Network executives continued to push for &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; but finally offered the band a choice to play either &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; or &quot;Lithium&quot;, which the band appeared to accept. At the performance, Nirvana began to play, and Kurt Cobain played the first few chords of the song, &quot;Rape Me&quot;, much to the horror of MTV execs, before continuing their regular performance of &quot;Lithium&quot;. Near the end of the song, frustrated that his amplifier had stopped functioning, bassist Krist Novoselic decided to toss his bass into the air for dramatic effect. He misjudged the landing, and the bass ended up bouncing off of his forehead, forcing him to stumble off the stage in a daze.

Backstage and before the show, Guns N&#x27; Roses vocalist Axl Rose challenged Cobain to a fight after he, his wife, Hole lead singer Courtney Love, and Nirvana bandmates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl egged him on. At the end of Nirvana&#x27;s performance, while Cobain was trashing the band&#x27;s equipment, Dave Grohl ran to the microphone and shouted &quot;Hi, Axl! Where&#x27;s Axl?&quot; repeatedly. Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; video for the ballad &quot;November Rain&quot; won the MTV Video Music Award for best cinematography. During the show, the band performed &quot;November Rain&quot; with singer Elton John. Because of the dispute Rose had with Cobain, moments before the &quot;November Rain&quot; performance, Cobain spat on the keys of what he thought was Axl&#x27;s piano. Cobain later revealed that he was shocked to see Elton John play on the piano he had spat on. During the commercial break, the Alien 3 Pepsi commercial was shown.

Radio host Howard Stern appeared as Fartman, Stern&#x27;s radio superhero, wearing a buttocks-exposing costume obviously inspired by Prince&#x27;s outfit from the previous year. Stern was a presenter for best hard rock/metal performance with actor Luke Perry (after several other celebrities turned him down).

1993: at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards, Madonna opened the show in a gender-bending performance of her song &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot;, in which Madonna and her two backup singers, dressed in tuxedos and top hats, danced with women in corsets in a choreographed, highly sexual routine.

RuPaul and Milton Berle, who had conflicts backstage, presented an award together. When Berle touched RuPaul&#x27;s breasts, RuPaul ad-libbed the line &quot;So you used to wear gowns, but now you&#x27;re wearing diapers.&quot;

Rapper Snoop Dogg presented the Best R&amp;B Video award with Dr. Dre and George Clinton. At the time, Snoop was wanted in connection with the week-old drive-by murder of an L.A. gang member.

Janet Jackson closed the show with her performance of &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Goes&quot; &amp; &quot;If&quot;.

1994: at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards on September 8, months after a profanity-laced appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, Madonna was announced to present the award for Best Video of the Year. She came out, arm-in-arm with an unannounced David Letterman, to a wild ovation. At the microphone, Letterman told her &quot;I&#x27;ll be in the car. Watch your language&quot;, and left.

Recently betrothed couple Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley received a standing ovation as they walked on stage hand-in-hand. After turning to the audience and proclaiming, &quot;And just think, nobody thought this would last&quot;, Jackson grabbed Presley and kissed her.

1995: at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards, Hole perform the song &quot;Violet&quot; from their major-label debut album &quot;Live Through This&quot;. This was one of the first major televised performances given by frontwoman Courtney Love following the death of her husband Kurt Cobain and the death of her band&#x27;s bassist Kristen Pfaff in 1994. Before beginning the song, Love dedicated the performance to her husband and different people in the entertainment industry who had recently died: &quot;This is for Kurt, and Kristen, and River, and Joe, and today Joni Abbott, this is for you.&quot; Abbott worked in the Talent Relations department at MTV and had recently committed suicide. The song ended with Love throwing her guitar, knocking the microphone stand into the crowd and pushing over speaker-boxes with bandmate Eric Erlandson before exiting the stage. Love also caused a stir when she interrupted a post-ceremony interview with Kurt Loder and Madonna by throwing her make-up compacts at the singer as they broadcast outside the awards venue.

Michael Jackson performed for over 15 minutes to a medley of his main songs, including &quot;Scream&quot;, and danced his signature moves, including the robot, moonwalk and the relatively unknown &quot;Bankhead Bounce&quot;. While Slash accompanied Jackson and played guitar on &quot;Black or White and the beginning of Billie Jean&quot;. This performance was voted by the public as the Best VMA Pop Performance and Most Iconic VMA Performance in 2011 with more than half the votes.

TLC was the big winner of the night won four awards, including &quot;Viewer&#x27;s Choice&quot;, &quot;Best Group Video&quot;, and &quot;Video of the Year&quot; (Waterfalls).

1996: at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, the four original members of Van Halen received 20-second standing ovation when they made their first public appearance together since their break-up in 1985.

Several weeks later, the public learned that Van Halen would not reunite with Roth. Roth released a statement apologizing to fans, stating that he was an unwitting participant in a publicity stunt to sell more copies of the greatest hits album, &quot;Best Of Vol. 1&quot;, and that he had been led to believe that he was rejoining Van Halen. The following day, Eddie and Alex Van Halen released a statement, stating that they had been honest with Roth, and never led him to believe that he had been re-hired.

During British band Oasis&#x27; performance at the show, lead vocalist Liam Gallagher made rude gestures at brother Noel as he was playing his guitar solo, then spat beer all over the stage before storming off.

Alanis Morissette performed &quot;Your House&quot;, a hidden track from her bestseller album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;.

The recently reunited Kiss closed the show with a special concert aired from the Brooklyn Bridge.

Tupac Shakur made his final public appearance before his murder.

1997: at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, Pat Smear announced that he was leaving Foo Fighters halfway through their performance and presented his replacement, Franz Stahl, who had been a member of the band Scream with Dave Grohl.

The Spice Girls, who won the best dance video award to the for their music video &quot;Wannabe&quot;, who wore a black strap on their left arms as a sign of grief because of Diana, Princess of Wales&#x27;s death prior to the event.

While accepting the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist Video that year for &quot;Sleep to Dream&quot;, Fiona Apple appealed to her audience not to be enamored of celebrity culture. She proclaimed, &quot;this world is bullshit&quot; and quoted Maya Angelou, saying &quot;go with yourself&quot;. Though her comments were generally greeted with cheers and applause at the awards ceremony, the media backlash was huge. Some considered her remarks to be hypocritical, however she was unapologetic: &quot;When I have something to say, I&#x27;ll say it.&quot;

Shock-rocker Marilyn Manson performed the song &quot;The Beautiful People&quot;, as the grand finale, and the video for this song was nominated for &quot;Best Rock Video&quot; and &quot;Best Special Effects&quot;, marking one of the most significant performances for the band.

1998: at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards, during the original broadcast of the show, a commercial faded in the Nine Inch Nails NIN logo on a black screen while playing a combination of music that started as a solo piano piece and morphed into an electronic/industrial beat (which would later found out to be the songs &quot;La Mer&quot; and &quot;Into the Void&quot;, which share many melodic components and can be considered variations on a theme) and ended with Trent Reznor screaming &quot;Tried to save myself, but myself kept slipping away&quot; and the word &quot;ninetynine&quot; in the trademark NIN reversed-N font. This was only shown once during the original broadcast, was edited out of all repeats.

Geri Halliwell attended the event, one of her first public appearances since she left the Spice Girls.

At the red carpet, actress Rose McGowan was wearing a see-through dress, no bra, and a thong, while Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston poked fun at their rumored rift by wearing lookalike chocolate brown dresses by Vera Wang. In an attempt to outdo each other, the singers tore off pieces of their dresses to reveal minidresses then staged a faux catfight that left the audience in disbelief. &quot;People thought Whitney and I had some kind of beef&quot;, explained Carey.

1999: Lil&#x27; Kim showed up at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards with an entire breast exposed and only a small pasty over the nipple. Kim&#x27;s outfit became even more controversial later when she appeared on stage with Diana Ross and Mary J. Blige to present the Best Hip-Hop Video award, and Ross reached over, cupped her hand under Kim&#x27;s exposed breast and jiggled it while Kim laughed.

During the following acceptance speech by the Beastie Boys, group member Ad-Rock addressed the instances of rape and sexual assault that occurred in the crowd at the recent Woodstock 1999 concert event. He pleaded to other musicians in the room to make a change in the way they treat fans at concerts; to pledge to talk with promoters and security to ensure &quot;the safety of all the girls and the women who come to our shows&quot;.

Afeni Shakur and Voletta Wallace, the mothers of the recently deceased Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., met for the first time at the ceremony.

Britney Spears made her debut appearance on the show, performing her single &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; and later introducing NSYNC for &quot;Tearin&#x27; Up My Heart&quot;.

Ricky Martin took the stage of the ceremony to perform his singles &quot;She&#x27;s All I Ever Had&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;.

TLC won Best Group Video for &quot;No Scrubs&quot;, receiving a standing ovation from the audience and artists. For the second year in a row, the Backstreet Boys took the Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;I Want It That Way&quot;, a song they performed during the broadcast.

Before presenting the final award, a group of drag queens paid tribute to Madonna wearing her most iconic outfits with a medley of her hit songs. Madonna herself then appeared onstage and remarked, &quot;All I have to say is that it takes a real man to fill my shoes.&quot; She then introduced Paul McCartney, who presented the Video of the Year to &quot;some guy called Laurence Hill&quot; (Lauryn Hill).

===2000s===
2000: at the 2000 Video Music Awards, Limp Bizkit won the award for Best Rock Video. As vocalist Fred Durst spoke, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford climbed onto the scaffolding of the set. Durst egged Commerford on, saying &quot;Stage dive, dude&quot; and &quot;Take a dive&quot;, finally ending his speech with &quot;and [Commerford]&#x27;s a pussy &#x27;cause he won&#x27;t jump&quot;. Commerford and his bodyguard were sentenced to a night in jail. RATM vocalist Zack de la Rocha reportedly left the awards after Commerford&#x27;s stunt. RATM guitarist Tom Morello recalled that Commerford related his plan to the rest of the band before the show, and that both de la Rocha and Morello advised him against it immediately after Bizkit was presented the award.

Eminem performed his two singles &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; and &quot;The Way I Am&quot;. The performance began with Eminem&#x27;s single &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; which started outside the Radio City Music Hall on 6th Avenue, Manhattan. Eminem continued his performance into the arena and was followed by a hundred Eminem &#x27;clones&#x27; wearing white tank tops and baggy jeans with bleached blonde hair.

Napster co-founder Shawn Fanning co-introduced Britney Spears. Fanning wore a Metallica T-shirt, much to the displeasure of Metallica drummer and anti-Napster advocate Lars Ulrich. Britney performed &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; and her newest smash hit &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot;, which gained media attention mostly due to Spears&#x27;s ripping off a tuxedo to reveal nude-colored performance attire. At performance&#x27;s end, VMA co-host Marlon Wayans proclaimed, &quot;Girl done went from &#x27;The Mickey Mouse Club&#x27; to the strip club.&quot;

At the end of Christina Aguilera&#x27;s performance, Durst walked onstage and performed part of his band&#x27;s song &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot; with Aguilera. After eliciting charged reactions from his fans, Durst stated: &quot;I already told you guys before, I did it all for the nookie, man.&quot; The feud died weeks later. Aguilera denied Durst&#x27;s statement, saying Durst &quot;got no nookie&quot;.

Aguilera and Spears disproved rumors of a rivalry when they came onstage, holding hands, and introduced Whitney Houston. Houston, who had been targeted by the media for erratic behavior, canceled appearances, drug use rumors and being busted for carrying marijuana at a Hawaii airport just a few months prior, came out to a standing ovation and introduced an award to Eminem with husband Bobby Brown, who was recently let out from jail. Houston revealed more erratic behavior, jumping up and down saying &quot;free&quot; in reference to Brown&#x27;s recent jail release. Aaliyah would win two MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video and Best Video from a Film for &quot;Try Again&quot;.

2001: at the 2001 Video Music Awards, Britney Spears performed her single, &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot;. while dancing in a very revealing outfit, the performance featured the singer in a cage with a tiger and briefly dancing with a real albino snake on her shoulders. The inclusion of a tiger and a snake in the performance bought a great deal of criticism from PETA.

U2 had been set to perform a medley including &quot;Elevation&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; and &quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can&#x27;t Get Out Of&quot;. The riser they were performing on lost power and MTV had to cut to several minutes of promos while everything was set up again. They lost power again and finally the band was lowered to the ground and performed without the riser. After the performance, lead singer Bono explained that MTV &quot;forgot to pay the electricity bill&quot;.

Michael Jackson made a surprise appearance at the end of NSYNC&#x27;s performance of &quot;Pop&quot;. Surrounded by members of the group, Jackson performed some of his trademark dance moves to Justin Timberlake&#x27;s beatboxing.

The show paid tribute to the R&amp;B singer/actress Aaliyah, who was supposed to present an award but died two weeks before from a plane crash. U2 paid tribute to punk-rock singer Joey Ramone, who died of lymphoma 4 months before.

2002: in 2002, the VMAs took place on Michael Jackson&#x27;s birthday, and as a tribute, Britney Spears introduced him saying she &quot;considered him the artist of the millennium&quot;. Jackson said, &quot;When I was a little boy growing up in Indiana if someone told me I&#x27;d be getting &#x27;the artist of the millennium award,&#x27; I&#x27;d have never believed it.&quot; A year later, at the 2003 VMAs, this was parodied by presenters Fred Durst and Jack Black, with Durst stating that Black was the &quot;funniest man alive&quot;.

The Hives and The Vines both performed on the night after the sudden garage rock revival during the year, with rumors spreading around that it was to be &#x27;battle of the bands&#x27; performance. Once The Hives performed, singer Howlin&#x27; Pelle Almqvist said to the crowd &quot;I know you want us to play more, but that&#x27;s all the time we have for so you can turn off [your TV] now&quot;, just before The Vines came on the bigger stage to perform their hit single &quot;Get Free&quot;, ultimately destroying their set after their performance.

Triumph the Insult Comic Dog appeared and had a confrontation with Eminem. Eminem had a confrontation with Moby, who had called the rapper&#x27;s music misogynistic and homophobic. By that time, there were multiple boos from the crowd. The Best Male Video award was given to Eminem right after the confrontation with Triumph and Moby, and when Eminem went to stage to pick up the award, in the middle of his speech, he challenged Moby to fight if he continued to boo him.

Justin Timberlake made his solo performance debut on the show, performing his single &quot;Like I Love You&quot;.

Tionne &quot;T-Boz&quot; Watkins and Rozonda &quot;Chilli&quot; Thomas, the surviving members of the top-selling R&amp;B trio TLC, made their first television appearance since the death of bandmate Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes.

Shakira took the stage of the VMAs to perform her single &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;.

Christina Aguilera shocked the audience by wearing a skimpy outfit and heavy makeup, with a dirty look removing her good-girl image. She was part of an awkward moment at the awards when presenting the Best Male Video Award to Eminem, who had insulted her in 2000.

Canadian artist Avril Lavigne won her first award ever as Best New Artist in a Video, getting the record for the youngest artist so far to win this award at the age of 17. She kicked off the 2002 VMAs with a &quot;Complicated&quot; / &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; pre-show performance and together with Lisa Marie Presley they gave the award for Best Female Video to Pink who was under the effects of alcohol during her acceptance speech.

Axl Rose unveiled the new lineup of New Guns N&#x27; Roses. The band&#x27;s set was the show&#x27;s finale, and although the performance was meant to be kept a secret, some New York radio outlets announced the performance earlier in the day. The band played a set consisting of &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Madagascar&quot;, and &quot;Paradise City&quot;.

2003: at the 2003 Video Music Awards, Madonna played a groom kissing her brides, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, on stage. The gender role-reversal and lesbian theme instantly made front-page headlines. The three singers performed a medley of her classic hit, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, and her then latest release, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, with a guest rap by Missy Elliott. A quick camera cut to the reaction of Justin Timberlake, who dated Spears until 2002, also gained media attention. The design resembled Madonna&#x27;s performance of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; at the 1984 VMAs: the same wedding cake set, wedding dresses and &quot;Boy Toy&quot; belt worn by Madonna 19 years ago now adorned Aguilera and Spears.

Beyoncé opened her performance by descending upside down from the rafters at Radio City Music Hall. Knowles performed &quot;Baby Boy&quot; as she was gently lowered to the stage, dressed in harem pants. She was later joined by Jay-Z as they performed their duet &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;. The performance marked Knowles&#x27; solo debut.

2004: the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards were held at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida. This was the first time the awards show was held outside of New York City and Los Angeles. It was the first video music awards to not have a host.

2005: at the 2005 show, Green Day returned, taking home the Best Rock Video, Best Group Video, and Video of the Year Moonmen for &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;, which they performed during the broadcast. They also took the Viewer&#x27;s Choice award for &quot;American Idiot&quot;.

The 2005 VMAs were the first to have a performance in Spanish, when Shakira performed her single &quot;La Tortura&quot; with Alejandro Sanz. It was also the first time that Spanish-language videos were nominated at the awards.

Also at the show, while introducing the reggaeton spot, Fat Joe made a disparaging comment about G-Unit: &quot;I&#x27;d like to tell the people home I feel so safe tonight with all this police protection courtesy of G-Unit...&quot;. Later in the show, after G-Unit&#x27;s performance, 50 Cent directed profanities at Fat Joe which were edited out before the shows airing although some broadcasts played the uncensored version of the show. Reggaeton artists Daddy Yankee, Tego Calderón and Don Omar performed.

Actress Eva Longoria caused a stir when she appeared barely dressed to introduce Mariah Carey. Gwen Stefani and Snoop Dogg won best dressed female and male and received prizes to donate to a charity of their choice.

Kelly Clarkson performed a high energy version of her song &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; barefoot wearing a graphic belly top and capri pants. Clarkson moved through the crowd during the performance, which culminated in the singer getting sprayed with water. By the end of the song, she and a portion of the audience were soaking wet. R. Kelly performed his rap opera, &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot;.

Animated duo Beavis and Butt-head appeared in several Viewer&#x27;s Choice award skits, saying to &quot;Vote to put Beavis and Butt-head back on MTV!&quot;. Rather belatedly, the TV show returned to MTV in 2011.

2006: Justin Timberlake opened the 2006 Video Music Awards performing his singles &quot;My Love&quot; and &quot;SexyBack&quot;. The awards were distributed evenly widespread all genres, as hip-hop, pop and rock artists alike all won Moonmen. 2006 was also the first time that viewers voted for all the performer&#x27;s categories (Video of the Year, Best Male Video, Best Group Video, among others, except professional categories).

When Panic! at the Disco won Video of the Year for &quot;I Write Sins Not Tragedies&quot;, a man calling himself Sixx jumped onstage claiming that MTV had denied him his own TV show. Hosted by Jack Black, there were also performances by Shakira with Wyclef Jean, Beyoncé, Christina Aguilera and The Killers.

2007: the 2007 Video Music Awards was opened by Britney Spears performing her comeback single &quot;Gimme More&quot;. To many, Spears failed to live up to the pre-show hype. She wore black sequined lingerie and put in less energy than her previous performances. The performance was called &quot;career crippling&quot;.

Kid Rock and Tommy Lee were involved in an altercation during Alicia Keys&#x27;s performance. Lee was sitting with magician Criss Angel when the two went to visit Diddy, who was sitting close to Kid Rock. Kid Rock allegedly punched Tommy Lee in the face. The two were broken up, and both were escorted from the resort. Angel was removed a short time later.

2008: the 2008 Video Music Awards were opened by Britney Spears which welcomed everybody to the 25-year anniversary of the Video Music Awards. Barbadian singer Rihanna opened the show with her song &quot;Disturbia&quot; in a very revealing black leather outfit. After 16 nominations, Britney Spears finally won her first VMA, taking Best Female Video, Best Pop Video, and Video of the Year for &quot;Piece of Me&quot;, considered as Spears&#x27; comeback.

Host Russell Brand commented on Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, begging the audience to vote for him. Brand called President George W. Bush a &quot;retarded cowboy&quot; and claimed Bush &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be trusted with a pair of scissors in Britain&quot;.

Russell Brand also made comments on the Jonas Brothers for wearing purity rings. Brand later faced criticism for his swipes at the trio. He confirmed his apology at the MTV Video Music Awards 2009 by saying &quot;I upset the Jonas Brothers last year, I had to say sorry to them and they forgave me. They had to, they&#x27;re Christians.&quot; During her introduction of T.I. and Rihanna&#x27;s performance, Jordin Sparks, who also wears a purity ring, defended the boy-band by saying &quot;It&#x27;s not bad to wear a promise ring because not everybody, guy or girl, wants to be a slut.&quot; Sparks was in turn criticized for implying that those who do not wear purity rings or do not abstain are promiscuous.2009: at the 2009 Video Music Awards, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift won Best Female video for &quot;You Belong with Me&quot;. During her acceptance speech, rapper Kanye West unexpectedly showed up on stage. Taking the microphone from Swift, he announced &quot;Yo Taylor, I&#x27;m really happy for you, and Imma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time!&quot;. MTV cut away from the stage (showing Beyoncé with a shocked and disapproved look) after West gave the microphone back to Swift and giving the middle finger to the audience as they started booing him off stage, and so Swift did not finish her speech. West was removed for the rest of the show. However, when Beyoncé won Video of the Year for &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;, she called Swift back on stage to &quot;have her moment&quot; (finishing her speech from winning Best Female Video). In an off-the-record portion of an interview the following day, President Barack Obama called West a &quot;jackass&quot; for his antics. During a post-interview, Jay-Z admitted West was wrong to go on stage, but he thought people were overreacting to the incident.
Madonna opened the show talking about her experiences with Michael Jackson. After her speech, a Michael Jackson tribute commenced, including Janet Jackson performing the duet &quot;Scream&quot;. The show closed with a sneak preview of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;This Is It&quot; movie.

At the show&#x27;s red carpet, Colombian singer Shakira and American singer Pink attended with the same dress. Both singers took it humorously and posed together for the paparazzi.

Lady Gaga later performed her song &quot;Paparazzi&quot; and shocked the audience when she appeared to bleed out on stage. It was actually a contraption in her outfit. Beyoncé performed her song &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; with over two dozen female dancers dancing with her. Pink performed her single &quot;Sober&quot; while doing a trapeze act during the entire performance while singing live.

Rapper Lil Mama jumped on stage as Jay-Z and Alicia Keys performed &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot;. Lil Mama later apologized. During an interview with New York Radio DJ Angie Martinez, Jay-Z said that he thought the unrehearsed move was something similar to the West and Swift incident.

Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Green Day were the big winners of the night, with three awards each.

===2010s===
2010: at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, Taylor Swift performed her song &quot;Innocent&quot;, while Kanye West performed &quot;Runaway&quot; with Pusha T giving a stellar performance on the MPC2000. Eminem, who performed at the show, did not receive his awards in person, as he had to leave immediately to perform with Jay Z at The Home &amp; Home Tour in New York City the next day. Additionally, will.i.am&#x27;s &quot;blackface&quot; outfit sparked controversy among African-Americans. Florence + the Machine performed &quot;Dog Days Are Over&quot;.

Lady Gaga won eight awards, including Video of the Year, Best Female Video, and Best Pop Video for &quot;Bad Romance&quot;; she also won Best Collaboration for &quot;Telephone&quot; with Beyoncé. Upon accepting her Video of the Year award, Gaga wore a dress made entirely of raw meat, which drew criticism from PETA. While accepting her Video of the Year award, Lady Gaga announced the title of her next album, Born This Way, and sang the chorus of its title track and lead single. Justin Bieber won Best New Artist, making him the second youngest Canada-born artist to ever win a VMA (first being Avril Lavigne in 2002).

Overall, the show grabbed 11.4 million viewers—the largest audience for an MTV Video Music Awards since 2002, and until 2011&#x27;s new record.

2011: the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards returned to the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California. In the entire history of the show, this was the third time no host was scheduled, although Kevin Hart, who would receive the position a year later, delivered an opening monologue.

Lady Gaga opened the show dressed as her alter ego Joe Calderone, delivering a monologue and then performing her single &quot;You and I&quot; from her album Born This Way. She was joined on stage by Queen band member and guitarist Brian May.

The tribute to Britney Spears included performances by young talents, who danced to various hit singles by Spears including &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; and &quot;Till the World Ends&quot;. After the tribute, Lady Gaga went onstage to present Spears the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. While accepting her award she and Gaga (dressed as her alter ego Joe Calderone) teased a kiss. Spears rejected the exchange saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve done that already&quot;, referring to her liplock with Madonna at the 2003 show.

During Kanye West and Jay Z&#x27;s surprise performance of &quot;Otis&quot;, a man attempted to rush the stage but was quickly taken off by security.

Katy Perry and Kanye West won the Award for Best Video for a Collaborative Single. As they went onstage to receive the award, Perry made a reference to West&#x27;s incident with Taylor Swift two years back. This was the first award Perry won in four years of being nominated.

Prior to her performance, Beyoncé announced on the red carpet that she and husband/rapper Jay Z were expecting a child. Straight after Beyoncé finished performing her song &quot;Love on Top&quot;, she also revealed again that she was pregnant by showing off her baby bump and rubbing it. That evening, Beyoncé set the record for the most mentions on Twitter per second (with 8,868) and helped this year&#x27;s VMAs become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers.

A tribute to late singer Amy Winehouse also took place; Russell Brand delivered a monologue on his thoughts on her, after which Tony Bennett previewed his collaboration with her for his album &quot;Duets II&quot;. Afterwards, Bruno Mars performed &quot;Valerie&quot; in her honor.

Katy Perry won three awards including Video of the Year for &quot;Firework&quot;, and Lady Gaga won two awards, including the new category Best Video With a Message for &quot;Born This Way&quot;.

2012: The 2012 MTV Video Music Awards aired live from the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California on September 6, 2012. British boy band One Direction was the big winner of the night receiving Best New Artist, Best Pop Video, and Most Share Worthy Video. Rihanna won the Video of the Year Award for &quot;We Found Love&quot;.

2013: For the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, MTV redesigned its moonman statue for one year only due to the ceremony&#x27;s being held in Brooklyn for the first time. Brooklyn-based artist KAWS used Michelin Man as inspiration to redesign the image of the renowned MTV moonman. Barclays Center, which served as the venue for the 2013 show, was decorated also by KAWS, themed around the redesigned moonman. The 2013 VMAs also marked the fourth time in the award show&#x27;s history that a host had not been appointed for the annual event. Lady Gaga opened the ceremony, performing her single &quot;Applause&quot;. During the performance, Gaga changed three times on stage and gave a tribute to her past eras (&quot;The Fame&quot;, &quot;The Fame Monster&quot; and &quot;Born This Way&quot;). At the end, Gaga came on stage wearing nothing but a seashell bikini.

Miley Cyrus&#x27; performance of her song &quot;We Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; featured the former Disney star entering the stage through a giant teddy bear wearing a one-piece bodice with a teddy bear design on it. The singer performed with a group of female backup dancers dressed as giant bears before singer Robin Thicke joins with Cyrus on stage to perform his single &quot;Blurred Lines&quot;. Cyrus then stripped down to a nude-colored lingerie and proceeded to perform her signature twerking dance moves, simulating sex with Thicke and grabbing his crotch with a giant foam finger. The unimpressed reactions of several celebrity audience members, including Rihanna and members of One Direction, also gained attention in the media.

Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Mirrors&quot; won Video of the Year, making him the first male solo artist to win this category since Eminem in 2002 with &quot;Without Me&quot;. Timberlake also became the second artist to be honored with the Video Vanguard Award and win Video of the Year in the same night, after Peter Gabriel did it in 1987. To celebrate his Video Vanguard Award, Timberlake performed a 15-minute medley performance, which included a mini-reunion with his former band *NSYNC. The set list of the most watched performance of the night included hit singles from his first four solo albums, such as &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, &quot;SexyBack&quot; and &quot;Suit &amp; Tie&quot;.

2014: the 2014 show was held at The Forum in Inglewood, California. Miley Cyrus won Video of the Year for &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; and got a young homeless man named Jesse to accept the award on her behalf. His speech was a call-to-action to help raise awareness to the homeless youth of America. Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj and Jessie J opened the show. Beyoncé closed the show by performing a 16-minute medley of songs from her self-titled fifth studio album. After the performance, her husband Jay Z and daughter Blue Ivy presented the Video Vanguard Award to her.

2015: the 2015 show was hosted by Miley Cyrus. Fashion designer Jeremy Scott redesigned the year&#x27;s &quot;moonman&quot;, marking the second time that the statue had been transformed. Taylor Swift won four awards, including Video of the Year for &quot;Bad Blood&quot;. She presented the Video Vanguard Award to Kanye West, who ended his acceptance speech by claiming that he would run for president in 2020.

Nicki Minaj ended her acceptance speech for Best Hip-Hop Video by passing the show back to Cyrus, saying: &quot;And now, back to this bitch who had a lot to say about me the other day in the press: Miley, What&#x27;s good?&quot;. Minaj was referring to Cyrus&#x27; comments about how she handled &quot;Anaconda&quot; being snubbed for a Video of the Year nomination. Cyrus appeared stunned by Minaj&#x27;s remarks and replied, &quot;We&#x27;re all in this industry. We all do interviews and we all know how they manipulate shit. Nicki, congratu-fuckin-lations.&quot; The camera then cut back to Minaj who seemed to mouth back the word &quot;bitch&quot;. Cyrus closed the show by performing along with a group of drag queens who participated on &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; and surprisingly released her fifth studio album &quot;Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz&quot; for free.

2016: the 2016 show was held at the Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. Rihanna performed four times during the show, including opening and closing the ceremony. After her final performance, Rihanna was presented the Video Vanguard Award by Drake, who declared, &quot;She&#x27;s someone I&#x27;ve been in love with since I was 22 years old.&quot; While accepting her award, Drake leaned in for a kiss that Rihanna dodged. Britney Spears returned to perform at the VMAs for the first time since her heavily criticized performance at the 2007 show. Kanye West gave a seven-minute long speech covering different topics, including his feud with Taylor Swift.

Beyoncé performed a 16-minute medley of her album &quot;Lemonade&quot; and won eight awards, including Video of the Year for &quot;Formation&quot;. She became the most awarded artist in VMA history with 24 moonmen, surpassing Madonna&#x27;s previous record of 20. The telecast saw a drop in audience for third year in a row.

2017: the 2017 show was hosted by Katy Perry. Kendrick Lamar won six awards, including Video of the Year for &quot;Humble&quot;, becoming the first artist to have won the award for a video he co-directed, while Pink was honored with the Video Vanguard Award. Jared Leto paid tribute to Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell, who both died over the past three months. The music video for Taylor Swift&#x27;s song &quot;Look What You Made Me Do&quot; premiered during the broadcast. Compared to the previous year, viewership was down from 6.5 million to 5.4 million viewers, making it the lowest viewed VMAs since Nielsen started measuring the show in 1994.

At the start of Fifth Harmony&#x27;s performance there were five silhouettes; one of them fell off the stage, referencing former group member Camila Cabello leaving the group the previous year.

Logic performed his song &quot;1-800-273-8255&quot; along with Alessia Cara and Khalid. Their stage was outlined with survivors of suicide loss and attempts, who wore T-shirts that had the phone number on the front and the phrase &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; written on the back. During their performance, Logic gave a speech about thanking the audience for giving him a platform to talk about the issues &quot;that mainstream media doesn&#x27;t want to talk about: mental health, anxiety, suicide, depression&quot;. He further added, &quot;I don&#x27;t give a damn if you&#x27;re black, white, or any color in between. I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re Christian, you&#x27;re Muslim, you&#x27;re gay, you&#x27;re straight – I am here to fight for your equality, because I believe that we are all born equal, but we are not treated equally and that is why we must fight.&quot; Following the performance, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline experienced a 50% increase in calls.

2018: Cardi B, the most nominated artist of the night, opened the 2018 show with a brief speech, holding a VMA like a baby. While receiving one of her awards, Cardi B stated, &quot;all the love.. it&#x27;s genuine, it&#x27;s beautiful, and that&#x27;s something that God give me that you can&#x27;t buy. B-tch.&quot; Camila Cabello won Video of the Year for &quot;Havana&quot; and Jennifer Lopez received the Vanguard Award. With Maluma among the performers as well, it marked the VMAs with the most Latin music artists present at the ceremony since the 2005 show.

Before introducing Cabello&#x27;s category, Madonna gave a tribute to the late Aretha Franklin. Most of the speech said the early origins of Madonna&#x27;s career and was only tangentially Franklin-related, which made critics describe the &quot;bizarre&quot; tribute as a &quot;lengthy&quot; anecdote about herself that involved Franklin&#x27;s music. Afterwards, Madonna explained that she was there to give the Video of the Year award as asked by MTV and to speak about some experience in her career with some connection with Aretha, not to make any kind of tribute.

The viewership of the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards was down 9% overall and 15% in the important 18- to 49-year-old demographic group. The total viewership was 4.8 million.

2019: the 2019 show was held at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. This was the first time the VMAs took place at the venue and in the state of New Jersey (it became the fifth state to host the show after New York, California, Florida and Nevada).

The show was hosted by Sebastian Maniscalco. Taylor Swift won three awards, including Video of the Year for &quot;You Need to Calm Down&quot;. She became the second artist and first female artist to have won the award for a video she co-directed, and the fourth artist to win the category twice overall. Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus&#x27;s &quot;Old Town Road&quot; won two awards, including Song of the Year. Missy Elliott received the Vanguard Award introduced by Cardi B and performed a medley. The performance was heavily choreographed and the set pieces alluded to her music videos &quot;The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)&quot;, &quot;Get Ur Freak On&quot;, and &quot;Work It&quot;. Shawn Mendes &amp; Camila Cabello performed their hit single &quot;Señorita&quot; for the first time ever in a performance characterized for its kissing tension. Lizzo performed a set featuring her singles, &quot;Truth Hurts&quot; and &quot;Good as Hell&quot;. During the performance she gave a short self-empowering monologue, and featured a figurative shadow of an oversized CGI rear end. Normani gave a performance of her song &quot;Motivation&quot;, that featured her doing intense gymnastic styled choreography that echoed the music video. Rosalía became the first lead Spanish act to ever perform at the VMAs, performing a medley of &quot;A Ningún Hombre&quot;, &quot;Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi&quot; (alongside Ozuna), and &quot;Aute Cuture&quot;. She also won Best Latin and Best Choreography for &quot;Con Altura&quot;, becoming the first ever Spanish act to win a VMA, for which she was congratulated by many personalities including Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez.

Marc Jacobs received the inaugural MTV Fashion Trailblazer Award.

===2020s===
2020: The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards were held on August 30, 2020. The show was originally scheduled to take place at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York City, but was moved outdoors because of security concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the 37th annual ceremony would &quot;highlight the boroughs in an exciting show and return to Barclays Center in 2021&quot;. For the first time in its history the VMAs were simulcast on over-the-air television on The CW, which is jointly owned by MTV parent company ViacomCBS and AT&amp;T parent company WarnerMedia.

Keke Palmer hosted the show from a VR model of the infamous Manhattan staple, Empire State Building. The Weeknd won Video of the Year for &quot;Blinding Lights&quot;, which he also performed as the show&#x27;s opener. During his speech he showed support for the Black Lives Matter movement and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor and Jacob Blake.

Lady Gaga received the first-ever (and only thus far as of 2024) Tricon Award, introduced by Bella Hadid. After giving her speech, Gaga performed a medley of her songs, including &quot;Chromatica II&quot;/&quot;911&quot;, &quot;Stupid Love&quot; and &quot;Rain on Me&quot;, the latter performed with Ariana Grande. Grande also won four awards, including Song of the Year and Best Collaboration.

The show was dedicated to actor Chadwick Boseman, who died less than 48 hours before the ceremony due to colon cancer.

2021: The 2021 MTV Video Music Awards were held September 12, 2021, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York City, for the first time in eight years. The award show also served as a celebration of MTV&#x27;s 40th anniversary. An opening monologue was delivered by Madonna. Artist Kehinde Wiley redesigned the year&#x27;s moonperson trophy, marking the third time that the statue had been transformed and the first from an artist of African-American descent.

Lil Nas X won three awards for &quot;Montero (Call Me By Your Name)&quot;, including Video of the Year and Best Direction. He became the second artist and first LGBTQ+ artist to win both categories for a video they co-directed. He jokingly thanked the gay agenda in his acceptance speech.

Olivia Rodrigo and Justin Bieber also received awards in big categories, winning Song of the Year and Artist of the Year respectively. BTS won three awards, winning Group of the Year for the third consecutive time, in addition to Best K-Pop and Song of Summer for &quot;Butter&quot;.

2022: Taylor Swift announced the release of her tenth studio album &quot;Midnights&quot; during her Video of the Year award acceptance speech. Swift also became the first ever artist to win Video of the Year three times.

Nicki Minaj won the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard award that night and performed a 9-minute medley of her hits including &quot;Anaconda,&quot; &quot;Super Bass&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot;, &quot;Beez in the Trap&quot;, and her newest hit &quot;Super Freaky Girl&quot; along with other songs. The award was presented by five members of her fan club the Barbz. In her acceptance speech, Minaj shouted out multiple people who had inspired her and people who have given her big opportunities early in her career including Madonna, Eminem, Britney Spears, Lil Wayne, Drake, 
Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and more who had help boost the popularity of her 2011 hit, &quot;Super Bass&quot;. Minaj also said that she wished musicians Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson were there to witness her. She also paid respects to her father, Robert Maraj, who died in a tragic hit-and-run accident in 2021. She said she wished people took mental health more seriously. Minaj thanked the Barbz, told the audience about her son, nicknamed Papa Bear, and announced her first greatest hits album, &quot;Queen Radio Vol. 1.&quot;

There were three co-hosts in the show, LL Cool J, Minaj, and Jack Harlow.

Harlow opened the show with a performance of his single, &quot;First Class&quot;. The performance took place on an airplane with Harlow acting as an attendant. Several celebrities were seated in the plane including Lil Nas X, Saucy Santana, Avril Lavigne, and more. The plane &quot;landed&quot; at the award show and mocked a red carpet interview, with Harlow saying &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, Fergie!&quot;. Fergie had come out onstage to perform her 2007 hit &quot;Glamorous&quot; which &quot;First Class&quot; samples, marking her first televised performance since her controversial performance of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the 2018 NBA All Star Game. The performance ended with Fergie and Harlow hugging.

Anitta becomes the first Brazilian singer to win a category at the MTV Video Music Awards.

2023: NSYNC reunited for the first time in 10 years at the ceremony, to present the award for Best Pop, which was to Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Anti-Hero&quot;. Swift acknowledged that she still has the &#x27;N Sync dolls, referencing the &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot; music video, and they gave her friendship bracelets.

Shakira was awarded with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, performing a medley of her hits. She became the first South-American born artist to receive the award. Later, Shakira and Karol G won the Best Collaboration award, for &quot;TQG&quot;, making the first time a Spanish-language video and a Latin female collaboration won the award.

Taylor Swift won Video of the Year for a second consecutive year for &quot;Anti-Hero&quot;, making her the artist with the most wins (four) in this category.

2024: The ceremony was originally scheduled to take place on September 10, 2024, but was pushed back by a day to avoid an overlap with the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.

Taylor Swift won seven awards, including Video of the Year and Artist of the Year, breaking the record for most awards won overall, with thirty wins since 2009. Her Video of the Year win for &quot;Fortnight&quot; extended her record for the most wins and most consecutive wins in this category, with five wins and three years respectively.

== Reception ==
The MTV Video Music Awards have been described as a prominent event in the mainstream music industry since its inauguration. However, some publications such as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;HuffPost&quot; opined that the stature of the ceremony had declined by 2019. &quot;HuffPost&quot; cited reasons such as a lack of interest (declining attendances and viewership: in 2019 ratings hit an all-time low for the third straight year), lack of musical diversity, lack of celebrity, lack of credibility, and access to music online. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; states, &quot;The moment the VMAs ceased to matter might have happened in 2014, when Drake didn&#x27;t bother appearing to receive his award. Or maybe it was even earlier than that: The Associated Press compared the energy of the VMAs to the scripted reality-TV show &quot;Cribs&quot; all the way back in 2006.&quot; MTV has also faced criticism for devoting most of its airtime outside the VMAs to reality shows and dramas, with music videos mainly airing in off-peak graveyard slots to suffice the minimum amount of music programming in the network&#x27;s carriage agreements.

=== Ratings ===
Ratings are not available prior to 1994 because MTV was not subscribing to Nielsen Media Research&#x27;s program ratings prior to 1994. The field &quot;Cumulative viewers&quot; shows the audience of the live simulcasts of the ceremony across many ViacomCBS channels as a whole.

==History==
Plans for the State Normal school were initiated in 1903, and required a year for the State of New Jersey to grant permission to build the school. It was then established as New Jersey State Normal School at Montclair, a normal school, in 1908 approximately 5 years after the initial planning of the school. At the time, Governor John Franklin Fort attended the dedication of the school in 1908, and the school was to have its first principal Charles Sumner Chapin that same year. The first building constructed was College Hall (now known as Cole Hall), and it still stands today. At the time, the campus was around , had 8 faculty members and 187 students. The first graduating class, which numbered at 45 students, contained William O. Trapp, who would then go on to win the Pulitzer Prize for journalism in 1929. The first dormitory was then built five years later, in 1915, and is known as Russ Hall.

In 1927, Harry Sprague was the first president of Montclair, and shortly afterwards the school began being more inclusive of extracurricular activities such as athletics. In 1927, however, after studies had emerged concerning the number of high school teachers in the state of New Jersey (only 10% of all high school teachers received their degrees from New Jersey), the institution became Montclair State Teachers College and developed a four-year (Bachelor of Arts) program in pedagogy, becoming the first US institute to do so. In 1937 it became the first teachers college accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.

In 1943, during World War II, several students, with permission from the president, Harry Sprague, joined the US Navy as volunteers to train for the war. It was also a time when students and faculty sold war bonds to support US American troops.

In 1958 the school merged with the Panzer College of Physical Education and Hygiene to become Montclair State College. The school became a comprehensive multi-purpose institution in 1966. The Board of Higher Education designated the school a teaching university on April 27, 1994, and in the same year the school became Montclair State University. It has offered Master of Arts programs since 1932, Master of Business Administration since 1981, Master of Education since 1985, Master of Science since 1992, Master of Fine Arts since 1998, Doctor of Education since 1999, and Doctor of Environmental Management in 2003 (now the PhD in Environmental Science and Management). PhD degrees were added in Teacher Education and Teacher Development in 2008, Counselor Education, Family Studies, Mathematics Education, Communications Sciences and Disorders by 2014, and most recently Clinical as well as Industrial/Organizational Psychology (2021). In 2018, Montclair State University graduated more than 30 doctoral students.

In 2004, NJ Transit opened the Montclair State University station, which links the university to New York City. The building of the MSU Station cost $26 million to complete, including a 1,500-space parking deck. In 2015, the university established the School of Communication and Media and added two new buildings to its campus; the Feliciano School of Business and the Center for Environmental and Life Sciences (CELS). Partridge Hall was fully renovated and in 2016, became the new School of Nursing, which welcomed its inaugural class of students that fall. In 2016, Montclair State University was designated by the U.S. Department of Education as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI). In 2017, Montclair State was designated a public research university by the New Jersey Legislature. The new state-of-the-art home for the School of Communication and Media opened in fall 2017, followed in 2018 by the opening of the Center for Computing and Information Science in the former Mallory Hall, which underwent a complete renovation and expansion. In 2016, the university&#x27;s classification was changed from a Masters to a Doctoral Research University, and in 2019, was changed to R2: Doctoral University – High Research Activity.

<text>In physics, the Pati–Salam model is a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) proposed in 1974 by Abdus Salam and Jogesh Pati. Like other GUTs, its goal is to explain the seeming arbitrariness and complexity of the Standard Model in terms of a simpler, more fundamental theory that unifies what are in the Standard Model disparate particles and forces. The Pati–Salam unification is based on there being four quark color charges, dubbed red, green, blue and violet (or originally lilac), instead of the conventional three, with the new &quot;violet&quot; quark being identified with the leptons. The model also has left–right symmetry and predicts the existence of a high energy right handed weak interaction with heavy W&#x27; and Z&#x27; bosons and right-handed neutrinos.

Originally the fourth color was labelled &quot;lilac&quot; to alliterate with &quot;lepton&quot;. Pati–Salam is an alternative to the Georgi–Glashow unification also proposed in 1974. Both can be embedded within an unification model.

== Core theory ==
The Pati–Salam model states that the gauge group is either or and the fermions form three families, each consisting of the representations and . This needs some explanation. The center of is . The in the quotient refers to the two element subgroup generated by the element of the center corresponding to the two element of and the 1 elements of and . This includes the right-handed neutrino. See neutrino oscillations. There is also a and/or a scalar field called the Higgs field which acquires a non-zero VEV. This results in a spontaneous symmetry breaking from to or from to and also,

See restricted representation. Of course, calling the representations things like and is purely a physicist&#x27;s convention(source?), not a mathematician&#x27;s convention, where representations are either labelled by Young tableaux or Dynkin diagrams with numbers on their vertices, but still, it is standard among GUT theorists.

The weak hypercharge, Y, is the sum of the two matrices:

:formula_1

It is possible to extend the Pati–Salam group so that it has two connected components. The relevant group is now the semidirect product formula_2. The last also needs explaining. It corresponds to an automorphism of the (unextended) Pati–Salam group which is the composition of an involutive outer automorphism of which isn&#x27;t an inner automorphism with interchanging the left and right copies of . This explains the name left and right and is one of the main motivations for originally studying this model. This extra &quot;left-right symmetry&quot; restores the concept of parity which had been shown not to hold at low energy scales for the weak interaction. In this extended model, is an irrep and so is . This is the simplest extension of the minimal left-right model unifying QCD with B−L.

Since the homotopy group

:formula_3

this model predicts monopoles. See &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopole.

This model was invented by Jogesh Pati and Abdus Salam.

This model doesn&#x27;t predict gauge mediated proton decay (unless it is embedded within an even larger GUT group).

==Differences from the SU(5) unification==
As mentioned above, both the Pati–Salam and Georgi–Glashow unification models can be embedded in a unification. The difference between the two models then lies in the way that the symmetry is broken, generating different particles that may or may not be important at low scales and accessible by current experiments. If we look at the individual models, the most important difference is in the origin of the weak hypercharge. In the model by itself there is no left-right symmetry (although there could be one in a larger unification in which the model is embedded), and the weak hypercharge is treated separately from the color charge. In the Pati–Salam model, part of the weak hypercharge (often called ) starts being unified with the color charge in the group, while the other part of the weak hypercharge is in the . When those two groups break then the two parts together eventually unify into the usual weak hypercharge .

<doc id="295222" wikidata="Q4201984" url="?curid=295222" title="Ernest Simpson">
<text>Ernest Aldrich Simpson (6 May 1897 – 30 November 1958) was an American-born British shipbroker, who was the second husband of Wallis Simpson, later the wife of the former King Edward VIII.

Simpson served as an officer in the Coldstream Guards before becoming a shipbroker in the family firm of SSY.

==Background==

Born in New York City, Simpson was educated at The Hill School before attending Harvard University. Simpson was commissioned in the British Army, serving as a captain in the Coldstream Guards during World War I. His father, Ernest Louis Simpson, a British citizen of Jewish background whose original surname was Solomon, co-founded the global shipbroking firm Simpson, Spence &amp; Young, trading since 1880. His mother, Charlotte Woodward Gaines, was American, daughter of a New York City attorney.

His elder sister and only sibling, Maud Simpson (1879–1962), married, in 1905, Major Peter Kerr-Smiley MP.

Simpson became a British subject during World War I, shortly after graduating from Harvard and renouncing his United States citizenship.

&quot;In his younger years he was described as tall, with blue eyes, blond, curly hair, a neat blond moustache and a fastidious dresser,&quot; according to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==First marriage==
His first wife, whom he married in New York City, on 22 February 1923 and divorced in 1928, was Dorothea Dechert (died 1967), the former wife of James Flanagan Dechert (died 1968), a Princeton University alumnus, whom she married in May 1916 and divorced in April 1920. Born Dorothea Webb Parsons, she was a daughter of Arthur Webb Parsons, a lawyer, and his wife, the former Frances Margaret Graves.

Dorothea and Ernest Simpson had one child, Audrey C. C. Simpson (born 1924), who married firstly on 5 October 1945, American journalist Murray Rossant (died 1988, brother of architect James Rossant) and, secondly on 1 April 1949, New York advertising executive Edmund Hope Driggs III. Audrey Simpson Driggs died at Calgary, Canada on 2 November 2013.

Simpson also had a stepdaughter by this marriage, Cynthia Josephine Dechert (born 1916).

==Second marriage==
Simpson&#x27;s second wife was Wallis Warfield Spencer (1896–1986), the Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania-born former wife of Earl Winfield Spencer Jr. and the only child of Teackle Wallis Warfield. They married in London, England, on 21 July 1928, and divorced on 3 May 1937. As his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, the publicity over his second wife&#x27;s remarriage to the Duke of Windsor and her subsequent fame thrust him into the role of &quot;the forgotten man&quot;. The two remained friends, however, the newspaper noted, with the now Duchess of Windsor sending him flowers when he was in hospital for surgery and Simpson offering advice and clarification when his former wife was working on her memoirs.

==Third marriage==

His third wife was Mary Raffray (&quot;née&quot; Mary Huntemuller Kirk, 1896–1941), a daughter of Henry Child Kirk, proprietor of the Kirk Silversmith Co. of Baltimore, Maryland and his wife, the former Edith Huntemuller, who dedicated her book &quot;Her Garden Was Her Delight&quot; to her memory. Mary Simpson&#x27;s letters, along with her sister&#x27;s, are held at Harvard University Archives.

A girlhood friend of Wallis Simpson&#x27;s, Mary Kirk was a bridesmaid at her first wedding and introduced her to Ernest Simpson in 1925; she also was the &quot;other woman&quot; with whom Simpson took a hotel suite in Bray, Berkshire, in order to give his wife evidence of adultery, so that she could bring divorce proceedings against him. Ernest Simpson and Mary Raffray were married in the Diamond Jubilee ballroom of the Brooklawn Country Club in Fairfield, Connecticut on 19 November 1937, six months after the groom&#x27;s divorce from Wallis Simpson and three weeks after the bride&#x27;s divorce from Jacques Raffray, a French aviator (son of French explorer Achille Raffray), whom Mary had married on 29 July 1918.

Mary and Ernest Simpson had one child, Ernest Henry Child Simpson, born in 1939, and christened at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London. In June 1940, the Simpsons sent their infant son to the United States to escape the War, in particular the Blitz. However, a month before Mary&#x27;s death, he returned with her to England. Mary Simpson died of cancer on 2 October 1941, at the couple&#x27;s home – Stanton House, Stanton Fitzwarren, Wiltshire. Ernest (the son) changed his name to Aharon Solomons in 1958 before being commissioned as an officer in the Israeli Army.

==Fourth marriage==
Simpson&#x27;s fourth wife was Avril Leveson-Gower (&quot;née&quot; Avril Joy Mullens, 1910 – 28 November 1978), the former wife of Brigadier-General Hugh Nugent Leveson-Gower and Prince George Imeretinsky. She was the younger daughter of Sir John Ashley Mullens, of Manor House, Haslemere, Surrey, by his wife, the former Evelyne Maude Adamson. Simpson and Avril Leveson-Gower were married in London on 12 August 1948. By this marriage Simpson had a stepdaughter, Lucinda Gaye Leveson-Gower (born 1935, married Sir Spencer Le Marchant in 1955). Avril Simpson was killed in a car crash in Mexico in 1978.

==Death==
Simpson died suffering from throat cancer, on 30 November 1958 in London, aged 61.

==In popular culture==
He was played by Charles Keating in &quot;Edward and Mrs Simpson&quot; (1978).

He was played by Tom Wilkinson in &quot;The Woman He Loved&quot; (1988).

He was played by Anthony Smee in &quot;Bertie and Elizabeth&quot; (2002).

He was played by David Westhead in &quot;Wallis &amp; Edward&quot; (2005).

He was portrayed by David Harbour in &quot;W.E.&quot;, a 2011 romantic drama film about the Duke and Duchess of Windsor&#x27;s courtship; the movie was co-written and directed by Madonna.

<text>Capri ( , ; ) is an island located in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the Sorrento Peninsula, on the south side of the Gulf of Naples, in the Campania region of Italy. The largest settlement on the island is the town of Capri. The island has been a resort since the time of the Roman Republic.

Some of the main features of the island include the , the Belvedere of Tragara (a high panoramic promenade lined with villas), the limestone crags called sea stacks that project above the sea (the ), the town of Anacapri, the Blue Grotto (), the ruins of the Imperial Roman villas, and the vistas of various towns surrounding the Island of Capri including Positano, Amalfi, Ravello, Sorrento, Nerano, and Naples.

Capri is part of the region of Campania, Metropolitan City of Naples. The town of Capri is a and the island&#x27;s main population centre. The island has two harbours, and (the main port of the island). The separate of Anacapri is located high on the hills to the west.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name Capri is unclear. It might be traced back to the Ancient Greek meaning &#x27;wild boar&#x27;, as the Greeks of Magna Graecia, who were the first recorded colonists to populate the island, called it (). It could also derive from Latin (&#x27;goats&#x27;). Fossils of wild boars have been discovered, lending credence to the etymology.

Finally, there is also the possibility that the name derives from an Etruscan word for &#x27;rocky&#x27;, though any historical Etruscan rule of the island is disputed. Capri consists of limestone and sandstone rock; cliffs form much of the sides and surface of the island.

==Government==
The voters of the island elect representatives for the two municipalities () on the island. The chosen representatives then choose two mayors to govern with them.

==History==
===Ancient and Roman times===

The island has been inhabited since early times. Evidence of human settlement was discovered during the Roman era; according to &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot; of Suetonius, when the foundations for the villa of Augustus were being excavated, giant bones and &#x27;weapons of stone&#x27; were discovered. The emperor ordered these to be displayed in the garden of his primary residence, the Palazzo a Mare.

Modern excavations have shown that human presence on the island can be dated to the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. Augustus developed Capri; he built temples, villas, and aqueducts and planted gardens so he could enjoy his private paradise.

In his &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Virgil states that the island had been populated by the Greek people of Teleboi, coming from the Ionian Islands. Strabo says that &quot;in ancient times in Capri there were two towns, later reduced to one.&quot; Tacitus records that there were twelve Imperial villas in Capri. Ruins of one at Tragara could still be seen in the 19th century.

Augustus&#x27;s successor Tiberius built a series of villas at Capri, the most famous of which is the Villa Jovis, one of the best-preserved Roman villas in Italy. In 27 AD, Tiberius permanently moved to Capri, running the Empire from there until his death in 37 AD.

In 182 AD, Emperor Commodus banished his sister Lucilla to Capri. She was executed shortly afterwards.

===Middle and Modern Ages===

After the end of the Western Roman Empire, Capri returned to the status of a dominion of Naples, and suffered various attacks and ravages by pirates. In 866 Emperor Louis II gave the island to Amalfi. In 987 Pope John XV consecrated the first bishop of Capri, when Capri, Scala, Minori, and Lettere were made dioceses to serve as suffragans of Amalfi, which thereby became a metropolitan see. Capri continued to be a residential diocese until 1818, when the island became part of the archdiocese of Sorrento. No longer a residential bishopric, Capri, Capreae in Latin, is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

In 1496, Frederick IV of Naples established legal and administrative parity between the settlements of Capri and Anacapri. The pirate raids reached their peak during the reign of Charles V: the famous Turkish admirals Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha and Turgut Reis captured the island for the Ottoman Empire, in 1535 and 1553, respectively.

The first recorded tourist to visit the island was French antiques dealer Jean-Jacques Bouchard in the 17th century. His diary, found in 1850, is an important information source about Capri.

===1800s–present===

French troops under Napoleon occupied Capri in January 1806. The British ousted the French in the following May, after which Capri was turned into a powerful naval base (a &quot;Second Gibraltar&quot;), but the building program caused heavy damage to the archaeological sites. The French reconquered Capri in 1808, and remained there until the end of the Napoleonic era (1815), when Capri was returned to the Bourbon ruling house of Naples.

The natural scientist Ignazio Cerio catalogued Capri&#x27;s flora and fauna during the 19th century. His work was continued by his son, author and engineer Edwin Cerio, who wrote several books on life in Capri in the 20th century.

Prior to the First World War the island was extremely popular with wealthy gay men. John Ellingham Brooks and Somerset Maugham shared a villa there. Friedrich Alfred Krupp, the German industrialist, was accused of homosexual orgies and eventually committed suicide.

Norman Douglas, Jacques d&#x27;Adelswärd-Fersen, Christian Wilhelm Allers, Emil von Behring, Curzio Malaparte, Axel Munthe, Louis Coatalen and Maxim Gorky are all reported to have owned a villa there, or to have stayed there for more than three months. Swedish Queen Victoria often stayed there because Axel Munthe was her doctor. Rose O&#x27;Neill, the American illustrator and creator of the Kewpie, owned the Villa Narcissus, formerly owned by the famous Beaux-Arts painter Charles Caryl Coleman. Dame Gracie Fields also had a villa and restaurant on the island and is buried there.

In 1908, Lenin was hosted by Maxim Gorky, the Russian author, at his house near the Gardens of Augustus. In 1970, a monument by Giacomo Manzù was erected during the centennial celebration in Lenin&#x27;s honour. Previously, they established a Party School, officially known as The First Higher Social Democratic Propaganda and Agitational School for Workers.

Capri, as with the Sicilian resort of Taormina, became &quot;high on the list of places to be visited by homosexual northerners&quot;, according to Gregory Woods, chair in Gay and Lesbian Studies. The history of Taormina was changed by the presence of Wilhelm von Gloeden, known for his homoerotic photography, whose studio from 1878 to 1931 drew many visitors to the town. Both Capri and Taormina were tolerant of gay men and artists, and there was much interchange between the two places. In December 1897 Oscar Wilde was planning to winter in Naples with his lover Lord Alfred Douglas; the couple made a short visit to Capri, but their presence proved too scandalous for even that liberal island (&quot;They even denied us bread!&quot;), so &quot;Bosie&quot; headed back to England and Wilde made his way to Taormina, where he spent time with von Gloeden. Jacques d&#x27;Adelswärd-Fersen, who settled in Capri and built Villa Lysis, visited von Gloeden in 1923, bringing with him his schoolboy lover/secretary.

Today, Capri has become more of a resort and is visited by tourists during the summer months of July and August. Mariah Carey owns a villa on the island.
==Cultural references==
During the later half of the 19th century, Capri became a popular resort for European artists, writers and other celebrities. The book that spawned the 19th century fascination with Capri in France, Germany, and England was (&#x27;Discovery of the Blue Grotto on the Isle of Capri&#x27;) by the German painter and writer August Kopisch, in which he describes his 1826 stay on the island and his (re)discovery of the Blue Grotto.
John Singer Sargent and Frank Hyde are among the prominent artists who stayed on the island around the late 1870s. Sargent is known for his series of portraits featuring local model Rosina Ferrara. The English artist and adventurer, John Wood Shortridge, acquired a fortino at Marina Piccola in the 1880s, (later transformed into a private villa by Dame Gracie Fields) and married a Capri girl, Carmela Esposito. He formed a close friendship with the English novelist George Gissing who provides a colourful and insightful account of his stays with Shortridge in his &quot;Published Letters of George Gissing&quot;. In the Gissing Journal, vol. XXXV, no. 3 (July, 1999), p. 2. it is recorded that the only mention of him in a recent book, albeit partially inaccurate, occurs in James Money&#x27;s &quot;Capri: Island of Pleasure&quot; (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1986, p. 42). Claude Debussy refers to the island&#x27;s hills in the title of his impressionistic prélude (1910). Capri is the setting for &quot;The Lotus Eater&quot; (1945), a short story by Somerset Maugham. In the story, the protagonist from Hendon, part of the borough of Barnet in London, comes to Capri on a holiday and is so enchanted by the place he gives up his job and decides to spend the rest of his life in leisure there. British novelist Compton Mackenzie lived there from 1913 to 1920, with later visits, and set some of his work on the island (e.g. &quot;Vestal Fire&quot;, 1927).

As well as being a haven for writers and artists, Capri served as a relatively safe place for foreign gay men and lesbians to lead a more open life; a small nucleus of them were attracted to live there, overlapping to some extent with the creative types mentioned above. Poet August von Platen-Hallermünde was one of the first. Jacques d&#x27;Adelswärd-Fersen wrote the (1910) about Capri and its residents in the early 20th century, causing a minor scandal. Fersen&#x27;s life on Capri became the subject of Roger Peyrefitte&#x27;s fictionalised biography, . A satirical presentation of the island&#x27;s lesbian colony is made in Mackenzie&#x27;s 1928 novel &quot;Extraordinary Women&quot;, inspired by the affairs of American painter Romaine Brooks (in the novel, under the pseudonym of Olimpia Leigh). One of the island&#x27;s most famous foreign gay exiles was Norman Douglas; his novel &quot;South Wind&quot; (1917) is a thinly fictionalised description of Capri&#x27;s residents and visitors, and a number of his other works, both books and pamphlets, deal with the island, including &quot;Capri&quot; (1930) and his last work, &quot;Footnote on Capri&quot; (1952).

Memoirs set on Capri include Edwin Cerio&#x27;s (1928) (translated as &quot;That Capri Air&quot;), which contains a number of historical and biographical essays on the island, including a tribute to Norman Douglas; &quot;The Story of San Michele&quot; (1929) by Swedish royal physician Axel Munthe (1857–1949), who built a villa of that name, and Shirley Hazzard&#x27;s &quot;Greene on Capri: A Memoir&quot; (2000), containing her reminiscences of Graham Greene. Graham Greene had a house in the town of Anacapri, the upper portion of the island, where he lived with his lover Catherine Walston.

==Climate==
Capri&#x27;s climate is Mediterranean (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;, Trewartha climate classification: &quot;Cs&quot;). Weather is hot and relatively dry in summer and mild to cool in winters, with sub-zero temperatures being a rare phenomenon. On average, there are approximately 18 days per year with thunder.

==Economy==

Capri is a tourist destination for both Italians and foreigners. In the 1950s, Capri became a popular resort. In summer, the island is heavily visited by tourists, especially by day trippers from Naples and Sorrento. Many of these visitors make it a point to wear the Capri pants named after the island. The center of Capri is the Piazza Umberto I.
Capri is home to the Mediterranean bush, the Arboreal Euphorbia, and the Ilex Wood. The native fauna on the island include quails, robins, peregrine falcons, woodcocks, blackbirds, geckos, red goldfish, conger eels, sargos, groupers, mullets, and the blue lizard of the Faraglioni.

Capri has twelve churches, seven museums and several monuments. The most visited attraction in Capri is the (&#x27;Blue Grotto&#x27;), a cave discovered in the 19th century by foreign tourists. On one side of the grotto are the remains of ancient Roman rock, with a narrow cavern. As of 2018 there were plans to limit access to day tourists.

The international luxury linen clothing brand 100% Capri opened its first boutique in the main town of Capri in 2000.

==Transport==
Capri is served by ferry or hydrofoil from Naples, Sorrento, Positano and Amalfi as well as by boat services from the ports of the Bay of Naples and the Sorrentine Peninsula. Boats arrive in the morning and leave after lunch (3–4 pm). Naples is served by two ports: Mergellina and Molo Beverello. Molo Beverello has more frequent departures and a larger selection of boats than Mergellina.

The ferry companies operating routes to Capri are SNAV, NLG, Positano Jet, Alilauro, Captain Morgan and Caremar in 2023.

From Naples, the ferry takes 80 minutes, and the hydrofoil 40 minutes. From Sorrento, the ferry takes about 40 minutes while the hydrofoil takes about 20 minutes.

Boats call at Marina Grande, from where the Capri funicular goes up to Capri town. From Anacapri, a chair lift takes passengers to Monte Solaro, the highest point on the island. There is also a bus service that connects the centre of Capri town with Marina Grande, Marina Piccola, Anacapri and other points.

It is not possible to transport cars with the ferry or boat services – non-locals are not allowed to bring cars to Capri between April and November, due to very narrow roads. The only mode of transportation on the island at this time are the local taxis or a local frequent bus services.

<doc id="295228" wikidata="Q1075969" url="?curid=295228" title="Cholo">
<text>Cholo () is a loosely defined Spanish term that has had various meanings. Its origin is a somewhat derogatory term for people of mixed-blood heritage in the Spanish Empire in Latin America and its successor states as part of &quot;castas&quot;, the informal ranking of society by heritage. &quot;Cholo&quot; no longer necessarily refers only to ethnic heritage, and is not always meant negatively. &quot;Cholo&quot; can signify anything from its original sense as a person with one indigenous parent and one &quot;mestizo&quot; parent, &quot;gangster&quot; in Mexico, an insult in some South American countries (similar to chulo in Spain), or a &quot;person who dresses in the manner of a certain subculture&quot; in the United States as part of the cholo subculture.

==Historical usage==

In his work &quot;Vocabulario en Lengua Castellana y Mexicana&quot; (1571), Fray Alonso de Molina reported that the word &quot;cholo&quot; or &quot;xolo&quot; derives from Nahuatl and means &quot;paje, moço, criado o esclavo&quot; (page, waiter, servant or slave).

The term&#x27;s use to describe a caste is first recorded in a Peruvian book published in 1609 and 1616, the &quot;Comentarios Reales de los Incas&quot; by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega. He writes (in Spanish), &quot;The child of a Black male and an Indian female, or of an Indian male and Black female, they call &quot;mulato&quot; and &quot;mulata&quot;. The children of these they call &quot;cholos.&quot; Cholo is a word from the Barlovento Islas [later known as Windward Islands]; it means &quot;dog&quot;, not of the purebred variety, but of very disreputable origin; and the Spaniards use it for insult and vituperation&quot;. Interestingly, the Mexican hairless dog is known as &quot;xoloitzcuintli&quot; or &quot;xolo&quot; in Nahuatl.

In Ecuador, mestizas wearing indigenous attire in Ecuador were termed &quot;cholas&quot;. &quot;Chola appears to have been a designation largely reserved for women and which, according to Jacques Poloni-Simard, was used to indicate mestiza women who had achieved an incipient degree of hispanization that was beyond the grasp of men, who were more firmly bound to their native communities by tribute obligations.&quot;

In Imperial Mexico, the terms &quot;cholo&quot; and &quot;coyote&quot; co-existed, indicating mixed mestizo and indigenous ancestry. Under the &quot;casta&quot; designations of colonial Mexico, the term rarely appears; however, an 18th-century casta painting by Ignacio María Barreda shows the grouping Español, India, with their offspring a mestizo or &quot;cholo&quot;

&quot;Cholo&quot; as an English-language term dates at least to 1851, when it was used by Herman Melville in his novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, referring to a Spanish-speaking sailor, possibly derived from the Windward Islands reference mentioned above. Isela Alexsandra Garcia of the University of California at Berkeley writes that the term can be traced to Mexico, where in the early part of the last century, it referred to &quot;culturally marginal&quot; mestizos and Native American origin.

During the War of the Pacific (1879–1883), Peruvians were contemptuously referred to as &quot;cholos&quot; by Chilean officers.

An article in the &quot;Los Angeles Express&quot; of April 2, 1907, headlined &quot;Cleaning Up the Filthy Cholo Courts Has Begun in Earnest&quot;, uses the terms &quot;cholos&quot; and &quot;Mexicans&quot; interchangeably. The term &quot;cholo courts&quot; was defined in &quot;The Journal of San Diego History&quot; as &quot;sometimes little more than instant slums, as shanties were strewn almost randomly around city lots in order to create cheap horizontal tenements.&quot;

==Modern usage==

===United States===

The terms cholos, cholas, and cholitas are used as informal slang terms in parts of the US to refer to people of Peruvian, Bolivian, Mexican, etc. descent, who usually are low-income and &quot;tough&quot;, and may wear stereotypical clothes. This is usually used to refer to people who are born in different places.

===Bolivia===

In Bolivia, &quot;cholo&quot; refers to people with various degrees of indigenous ancestry. The term &quot;cholita&quot; has, traditionally, been used to refer in a derogatory way to Aymara women. These women are now combatting this pejorative use by associating it with, for example, extreme sports such as wrestling, the fighting cholitas, and mountaineering, the cholita climbers. Cholitas, with their indigenous costumes of bowler hats, shawls, and &quot;pollera&quot; are now seen as fashion icons. Cholitas are now moving into many other fields at a high level. A &quot;cholo&quot; in Bolivia is the name given to a &quot;campesino&quot; (peasant, farmer) who moved to the city, and though the term was also originally derogatory, it has now become more of a symbol of indigenous power. The word &quot;cholo/a&quot; is considered a common and/or official enough term in Bolivia such that &quot;cholo&quot; has been included as its own ethnic group option in demographic surveys conducted in the country. In these same surveys, the term had on occasion been used interchangeably with the term &quot;mestizo&quot;. Nevertheless, some locals still use cholo as a derogatory term.

===Ecuador===
&quot;Cholos pescadores&quot; are a group of traditional fishermen along the coasts of Ecuador.

===Peru===
In Peru, mestizos with greater indigenous contributions are 27.7%: Those that would be in the range of 60% to 75% of indigenous contributions, characterized by presenting a tonality of tan, brown, and brunette skin with major features of indigenous ethnic groups. They are mostly descendants of Quechua peoples at around 23.7%; of other ethnic groups originating from the coast in 2%; of the Aymaras by 1.5%; of native ethnic groups of the jungle at 0.5%. Of the total of this subgroup around half are in the mountains, an important part of this segment due to migration are on the coast, usually in Lima, major urban centers and finally around a quarter (1/4) in the jungle. They are also called &quot;cholos&quot;. The term has been used as a racial slur towards people of Indigenous origin. It has also been used as a cultural slur towards people of a lower social class or simply someone perceived to be crass, unsophisticated, or ignorant.

===Mexico===
The cholo gangs started from the US in the mid- to late 1920s. Cholo groups in Mexico were well established at least by the mid-1970s along the US-Mexico border, and in Central Mexico. These were called by various names, such as &quot;barrios&quot;, &quot;clickas&quot;, and &quot;gangas&quot;. They were typically seen as American Hispanics and not as Mexicans because of their dress and appearance, which was not traditionally worn in Mexico. Many of these groups were formed by youths who had spent time in the United States and who returned with a different identity picked up in US street life. These groups mimic the organization of gangs in the United States, especially California, Texas, and Chicago. Cholos have their own style of dress and speech. They are known for hand signals, tattoos, and graffiti. Groups of cholos control various territories in the city. Most of the violence among these groups is over territory. Well-established Latino gangs from the United States (such as Norteños, Sureños, Latin Kings, 18th Street Gang, and MS-13) have made a strong presence in Mexico through making alliances with local drug cartels based on particular regions or cities.

<text>Stockton University is a public university in Galloway Township, New Jersey. It is part of New Jersey&#x27;s public system of higher education. It is named for Richard Stockton, one of the New Jersey signers of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Founded in 1969, Stockton accepted its charter class in 1971. At its opening in 1971, classes were held at the Mayflower Hotel in Atlantic City; the campus in Galloway Township began operating late in 1971. Nearly 10,000 students are enrolled at Stockton and it is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The university has a second campus in Atlantic City.

==History==
In November 1968, New Jersey approved a $202.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) capital construction bond issue with an earmarked $15 million (equivalent to $ million in ) designated for the construction of a new state college in Southern New Jersey. In 1969, a tract was selected for the campus in the heart of the New Jersey Pine Barrens in Galloway Township. The trustees originally named the school &quot;South Jersey State College&quot;, but they later renamed it to &quot;Stockton State College&quot;, in order to avoid confusion with Rutgers College of South Jersey.

In 1970, as construction began to run behind schedule, the trustees realized they needed an alternative location for the first class in 1971. They selected the historic Mayflower Hotel in Atlantic City as the temporary campus.

Classes began on schedule with the commencement of the first academic year in September 1971. The college took shape as 1,000 students (50 of whom were Educational Opportunity Fund students), 97 staff, and 60 full-time faculty took over the former resort hotel. By December 1971, occupancy of the first phase of the new campus construction took place, with the transfer of classes and offices to Galloway Township during the winter holiday period.

Accreditation of Stockton State College by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools was first granted in December 1975. In July 1991, the college was re-accredited unconditionally for another 10 years by the Middle States Association Commission on Higher Education, and Middle States accreditation was reaffirmed most recently in 2012.

In 1978 the US Congress passed legislation creating the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, the first such designation in the nation, to protect the area&#x27;s ecology and aquifer, which serves the large metropolitan region. In 1988, the United Nations designated it an International Biosphere Reserve, in recognition of its importance.

In 1993, the college&#x27;s name was changed to the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey. Rochelle Hendricks, New Jersey Secretary of Higher Education, approved Stockton&#x27;s petition to become a university on February 13, 2015. On February 18, 2015, Stockton&#x27;s board of trustees voted to change the former college&#x27;s seal to reflect the new name, Stockton University. The executive committee of the New Jersey Presidents Council, which represents the presidents of the state&#x27;s public, private and community colleges and universities that receive state aid, had also voted for the change. In February 2015, the college was awarded university status and was officially renamed Stockton University on February 18, 2015.

In the fall of 2017, Stockton University began constructing a new facility in the Chelsea neighborhood of Atlantic City. The addition was met with applause from local residents and community leaders, who hailed it as a redevelopment of the long-declining neighborhoods in Ward 5 of Atlantic City. By Thanksgiving 2018, the construction of the campus was complete. The campus budget was $178.28 million, is three stories tall and has an apartment-style complex for student living, called the Kessleman Hall. It also includes retail space along the Atlantic City boardwalk. Approximately 1,300 students are enrolled.

===Presidents===
====Richard E. Bjork====
Richard E. Bjork led the college as it graduated its first classes, expanded programs and achieved accreditation in 1975, the year it completed Phase II of the campus. The next year, the Performing Arts Center, a community and campus resource, opened.

====Peter M. Mitchell====
Mitchell led during continued growth as enrollment approached 5,000 students. Housing II, residential facilities for students, opened in November 1981 and the N-Wing College Center in February 1983.

====Vera King Farris====
Vera King Farris established the Holocaust Center in 1990, and the first Master&#x27;s program in the country for Holocaust &amp; Genocide studies in 1999. She directed the college to adopt sustainable design and practices, and oversaw expansion during the 1990s, including construction of the Arts and Sciences Building, designed by Michael Graves.

====Herman Saatkamp====
Emphasizing green buildings, Herman Saatkamp directed completion of a campus master plan in 2005 and a major capital program, including construction of the largest building, the Campus Center, opening in 2011. He initiated the 2010 purchase of what is now Stockton Seaview Hotel and Golf Club, established the Lloyd D. Levenson Institute of Gaming, Hospitality &amp; Tourism in the School of Business, and a collaborative agreement in 2011 with the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration to expand opportunities for students at both institutions in hospitality and tourism. Under his leadership, Stockton expanded its geographic reach, opening instructional sites in Cape May County, Ocean County and western Atlantic County, NJ. He led Stockton&#x27;s first comprehensive fundraising campaign, which exceeded its goals by raising $25.36 million, including gifts that helped transform Stockton&#x27;s facilities and programs. Saatkamp oversaw Stockton&#x27;s purchase of the Showboat casino.

On April 22, 2015, Saatkamp announced his resignation, to take effect on or after August 31, 2015. On April 23, Saatkamp received a vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; from a portion of the faculty. On April 28, it was announced that Saatkamp was taking immediate medical leave.

====Harvey Kesselman====
Harvey Kesselman, a former provost and executive vice president, was named acting president when Dr. Saatkamp announced his intention to resign and subsequently went on medical leave. Kesselman became interim president September 1, 2015, and was named Stockton&#x27;s fifth president at a December 2015 meeting of the university&#x27;s board of trustees. Kesselman was inaugurated on September 23, 2016. Under his leadership, Stockton has added new academic programs, such as a doctorate on Organizational Leadership and a Bachelor of Science degree in Exercise Science. He guided a major facilities expansion at the Galloway campus and strengthening the university&#x27;s roots in Atlantic City, where he and other students took their first classes when Stockton opened in 1971.

Construction of the $33.2 million Unified Science Center 2 and a $15.2 million classroom building were completed in 2018, creating three sections of a new Academic Quad and entrance to the university. Kesselman negotiated a public-private partnership with Atlantic City Development Corp., or AC Devco, for a new campus in Atlantic City with residences for 533 students overlooking the beach and Boardwalk. Stockton Atlantic City also includes an Academic Center for up to 1,800 students, and a parking garage. All of Stockton&#x27;s new facilities opened for classes in fall 2018.

== Campus ==

In the 2010s, the university completed several major building projects and other initiatives. The new Campus Center opened its doors with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May 7, 2011. The building was designed as a green, sustainable building which would be an inviting, inclusive, and exciting gathering place for the entire community.

Stockton opened a new $39.5-million Unified Science Center with state-of-the-art equipment in September 2013. The , three-story facility expands Stockton&#x27;s School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (NAMS), which graduates over 20 percent of all the math and science majors at New Jersey&#x27;s public colleges and universities.

===Seaview Resort===
In August 2010, as part of its expansion of its tourism and hotel management program in the School of Business, Stockton announced plans to purchase the nearby Seaview Resort &amp; Golf Course. On September 1, 2010, Stockton completed the deal for $20 million. In 2010, Stockton established the Lloyd D. Levenson Institute of Gaming, Hospitality and Tourism (LIGHT), part of the Stockton School of Business in Atlantic City at Stockton&#x27;s Carnegie Center.

Stockton University officially completed the sale of the Stockton Seaview Hotel &amp; Golf Club on July 31, 2018, to KDG Capital LLC of Florida for $21,070,000. The hotel retained the name Seaview Hotel &amp; Golf Club. Dolce Hotels and Resorts by Wyndham will continue to manage the hotel while Troon will continue to operate the two 18-hole golf courses.

===Atlantic City campus===

The university has built an Atlantic City campus at the Boardwalk and Albany Ave, with student residences overlooking the beach and Boardwalk. Stockton University Atlantic City opened fall 2018 with more than 500 residential students and more than 1,800 students taking courses in the new Academic Center, built on the former site of Atlantic City High School. The project is a public-private partnership with Atlantic City Development Corp., or AC Devco, a non-profit modeled on New Brunswick Development Corp., which expanded Rutgers&#x27; New Brunswick campus. 
The project includes a parking garage topped by new offices for South Jersey Gas, with 879 parking spaces for use by the university, South Jersey Gas and the public; and an academic building that can accommodate up to 1,800 students. The university also owns and operates the nearby Rothenberg Building.

Funding sources for the Atlantic City campus include $50.4 million in bonds from the Atlantic County Improvement Authority from proceeds of almost $70 million in tax credits issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.

In December 2014, Stockton had purchased the shuttered Showboat Atlantic City hotel and casino for $18 million, with plans to develop a full-service residential campus awarding undergraduate and graduate degrees and other professional training programs. The former resort, dubbed the &quot;Island Campus&quot;, would have been converted casino and employee spaces into classrooms, cafeteria space and offices for faculty and staff. Several floors of hotel rooms would be renovated into student housing, while the remaining rooms would be operated as a hotel. The House of Blues would be modified to house the school&#x27;s performing arts programs.

Soon after, it was publicly disclosed that Trump Entertainment Resorts held a covenant to the property, preventing the site from being used as anything other than a casino. It was through this covenant that Trump Entertainment Resorts prevented Stockton&#x27;s plans to open an Atlantic City campus on the Showboat property. President Saatkamp came under fire for making the purchase despite knowing about the covenant. The university reached a deal to lease the property from investor Glenn Straub, who planned to purchase the Showboat. Straub later sued the university to prevent Stockton from backing out of the deal. Stockton sold the Showboat property to Bart Blatstein in January 2016.

== Academics ==
Stockton&#x27;s academic programs provide opportunities for study in fields including Criminal Justice, Psychology, Environmental Science, Biology, Business, Historical Studies, and Literature. Additionally, courses are offered in emerging fields such as Computational Science, Tourism and Hospitality Management, and Homeland Security. Stockton also offers a Doctor of Physical Therapy program. The Division of Continuing Studies in the School of Graduate and Continuing Studies provides credit-bearing and non-credit certificate programs, CE approved continuing professional education for health sciences, human services and business professionals, and a growing number and variety of community education offerings.

==Student life==
Stockton&#x27;s Division of Student Affairs is organized to provide comprehensive programs and services to more than 8,800 students, including more than 3,000 students who reside in university facilities. These programs and services are intended to enhance campus life and enrich the academic programs of Stockton.

Stockton University is home to more than 130 official student clubs and organizations including a Student Senate. The Office of Student Development oversees all student clubs and organizations.

There are student media organizations, including the &quot;Argo&quot;, a student-produced newspaper. WLFR 91.7 (Lake Fred Radio) is the studen-run FM radio station licensed to Stockton in 1984. SSTV Ch. 14, Stockton Student Television, is Stockton&#x27;s on-campus television station. &quot;Stockpot Literary Magazine&quot; is an annual literary publication featuring art, poetry and writing of Stockton students and alumni. The Stockton yearbook (&quot;The Path&quot;) is an historical record of the academic year.

==Housing==
Stockton has six housing units on campus. Housing II and III are complexes of traditional three-story residence halls, while Housing I, IV and V are all apartment-style complexes of varying architectural character.
* &quot;Founder’s Hall&quot; (Housing II and III): Housing II is an 11-building, suite-style complex, housing around 520 students, with 17 residents per floor and 51 per three-story building. Housing III is a five-building complex, housing approximately 300 students with 20 students per floor and 60 per building. The residential halls offer a more traditional university lifestyle for the first-year experience. Originally, all students who choose to live on campus in their first year were required to live in either Housing II or Housing III; however, due to exceptionally large freshmen classes in recent years, some freshmen are assigned to Housing 1 as well.
* &quot;The Apartments&quot; (Housing I, IV, and V) consist of three multi-building complexes. Housing I is a 255-unit, 1,012-bed, garden apartment complex, which allows four students to live in proximity while being part of a larger court community of 128.
* Housing IV consists of eight buildings, each with eight two-bedroom apartments, with a total 246 beds. Each apartment holds four residents. Every four apartments are separated by an indoor foyer that leads out to the Housing IV recreational university green.
* Housing V, completed in 2008 as part of the capital program, consists of a complex of six buildings with a total of 384 beds. The Housing V suites house four students, with four key-entry bedrooms. These students share a kitchen and living area with their roommates and have access to a larger community recreation room.
* In fall 2018 Stockton opened its Atlantic City Campus. The Atlantic City Campus Residential Complex can accommodate some 530 students. The room styles are one-person studio, two-person private, four-person shared and private, and six-person private; all are apartment style living, with full kitchens. There is also a  fitness center, locker rooms, mail room, lactation room, and two outdoor courtyards, with retail space available along the world famous Boardwalk and on Atlantic Avenue. AC housing offers both 9-month and 12-month housing contract. The number of rooms was increased for the 2020–2021 school year to comply with regulations relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Jersey.

The Housing I, IV, &amp; V apartment style complexes all vary in layout, furnishings, sizes, pricing, and student privacy. Rooms in all residences are completely furnished and include beds, desks, bureaus, wastebaskets, lamps, telephones, air conditioning, carpeting, and curtains. Cable TV and telephone service are also provided. Single rooms are open to new students on a limited basis.

== Ranking and special recognition ==
In 2019 Stockton was ranked No. 35 in &quot;Regional Universities North&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Stockton also ranked tie No. 17 in Best Colleges for Veterans and No. 9 in Top Public Schools in the North.

&quot;Military Times&quot; named Stockton in its &quot;Best for Vets: Colleges 2019&quot; listing, ranking it No. 24 on the list of four-year schools.

===Architecture===
* The original linear campus was cited as one of New Jersey&#x27;s ten &quot;architectural treasures&quot; by &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; (April 1999) for its International modernist style, designed in the late 1960s by Robert Geddes of Geddes Brecher Qualls Cunningham Architects. Generous use of glass opens views to the Pinelands setting. The noted architect Michael Graves designed the Arts and Sciences Building (1991–1996) in a Post-Modernist style, with organic colors.
* After the F-Wing renovation in 2006, Stockton received LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.
* In 2008, Stockton received the &quot;Green Project of Distinction&quot; award from Education Design Showcase for Housing V (six residence halls).
* The Campus Center was awarded LEED® Gold certification established by the U.S. Green Building Council. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is the nation&#x27;s preeminent program for the design, construction and operation of high performance green buildings.
* The Unified Science Center, a 66,350-square-foot facility that opened in 2013, includes energy-efficient features and three striking artworks tied to the building&#x27;s environmental and scientific purpose: a Water Molecule sculpture by artist Larry Kirkland; The Wave, a hanging colored-glass installation by artist Ray King; and Sun Sails, a second colored-glass installation by King.
* Ground was broken in 2014 for a 54,000-square-foot expansion, The Unified Science Center 2 and a Health Sciences Center, which opened in 2018.

=== Green initiatives ===
Stockton is an environmentally friendly campus featuring a geothermal heat pump, fuel cells, and photovoltaic panels. In 2002, Stockton installed a 200 kW fuel cell at an initial cost of $1.3 million. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities provided a grant to cover most of the cost of the unit, with Stockton paying only $305,000. South Jersey Industries (SJI) also provided a rebate of $710,000 for the unit. The fuel cell provides just under 10% of the total energy for the campus; Stockton has the lowest energy cost per student among universities in New Jersey.

Stockton achieved national LEED certification for its new sustainable design. In 2006, the F-Wing expansion, including classrooms, offices and an atrium received the prestigious LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.

Stockton&#x27;s commitment to environmentally responsible design has resulted in &quot;green&quot; initiatives that have both saved energy and decreased greenhouse gas emissions. These include the development on campus of one of the largest geothermal heating and cooling systems in the world. The geothermal systems incorporate seasonal thermal energy storage so that waste heat or winter cold can be collected when seasonally available and stored for use in the opposing seasons. A borehole thermal energy storage system (BTES) was installed in 1994 and is used for heating the older half of campus, with waste heat collected from air conditioning equipment there. In 1995 a fuel cell and photovoltaic panels were installed buildings to generate energy.

An aquifer thermal energy storage system (ATES), the first of its kind in the United States, began operation in 2008. The ATES system reduces the amount of energy used to cool Stockton&#x27;s newer buildings by storing the chill of winter air in the water and rock of an underground aquifer, and withdrawing it in the summer for cooling. (Because building insulation standards have changed over time, the older buildings have a higher heating than cooling need, and the opposite is true for the newer buildings.)

In 2008, Stockton approved an agreement with Marina Energy LLC for the installation of solar panels on &quot;The Big Blue&quot; athletic center roof to generate electricity. Marina Energy is a subsidiary of South Jersey Industries. Stockton paid nothing for the equipment and signed a 10-year agreement to buy the generated power. In 2009 the job was completed.

As part of the capital plan, Housing V was built in 2009 to accommodate the rising demand for student housing. It incorporates geothermal heating and cooling using closed-loop technology, for a total of 450 tons cooling capacity. To eliminate the possibility of groundwater contamination in the event of a leak, freeze protection is provided in the circulating fluid. The design accommodates future solar thermal heating systems. Sustainable design includes landscaping: upper-story deciduous trees were planted along the south-facing facades of the residence halls to provide shade during the summer months, but allow the warmth of the sun to reach the buildings during the winter. This design received the &quot;Green Project of Distinction&quot; award from Education Design Showcase.

Stockton&#x27;s next green project was the largest single building project in its history. Designed and built according to the U.S. Green Building Council&#x27;s LEED Gold Standard in sustainable design, the new Campus Center, completed in 2011, provides of space for dining, bookstore, pool, theater, lounges and offices.

It will use 25% less energy than standard construction, and 40% less water. Other features include low-emitting adhesives, sealants, paints and coatings. Additional &quot;green&quot; features of the building include a storm water-collection system to irrigate an on-site &quot;rain garden&quot; landscaped with indigenous and adapted plant species. It also has a sophisticated energy management system for heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting.

In 2013, Stockton received approval from the New Jersey Pinelands Commission to administer the state&#x27;s first comprehensive forest management plan on public land. Stockton actively manages more than 1,500 acres of forest on its campus, benefiting the local wildlife populations, protecting the campus against fire and pathogens and providing recreation such as hiking and wildlife viewing.

== Arts ==
The Stockton Performing Arts Center offers musical and theater performances for the community, serves as a venue for student productions and performances through the School of Arts and Humanities, and hosts other campus events.

Stockton has had a campus Art Gallery since 1973. Initially located in a classroom-sized space and relocated in 1979 to a former dance studio, the Art Gallery opened in a dedicated exhibition space in January 2012. The Art Gallery is a dramatic two-level space with an open central well that visually connects the two floors. The creative conversion and re-design of the gallery and L-Wing was completed by the architectural firm PS&amp;S (Paulus, Sokolowski &amp; Sartor). The Art Gallery exhibits the work of graduating art majors every year in addition to art by local, regional, and nationally known artists.

In 2010, Stockton College entered a partnership with the South Jersey fine arts center Noyes Museum wherein Stockton would supply funds for needed repairs, and Noyes would provide access to their collections to Stockton. The partnership grew, and eventually the Noyes Foundation which ran the museum entirely ceded its assets and control of the museum to Stockton from 2016–2017. The original Absecon site was sold and the museum currently has exhibits at Stockton&#x27;s Kramer Hall in Hammonton, as well as the Noyes Arts Garage in Atlantic City.

<text>The West Coast Eagles are a professional Australian rules football club based in Perth, Western Australia. The club was founded in 1986 and first competed in 1987 as one of two expansion teams in the Australian Football League (AFL), then known as the Victorian Football League. The club plays its home games at Optus Stadium and has its headquarters at Lathlain Park. The West Australian Football Commission wholly owns the West Coast Eagles and the Fremantle Football Club, the AFL&#x27;s other Western Australian team.

The West Coast Eagles are one of the most successful clubs in the AFL era (1990 onwards). They have won the equal second most premierships (four, along with and second to ) of any club in that time and were the first non-Victorian team to compete in and win an AFL Grand Final, achieving the latter feat in 1992. The Eagles have since won premierships in 1994, 2006 and 2018. They are one of the most profitable and influential clubs in the league, and as of 2021 have more members than any other club with over 106,000.

West Coast also fields a women&#x27;s team in the AFLW competition and a reserves team in the WAFL.

==History==

===1986–1989: Formation and first years===

The West Coast Eagles were selected in 1986 as one of two expansion teams to enter the Victorian Football League (VFL) the following season, along with the Brisbane Bears. Ron Alexander was appointed as the team&#x27;s inaugural coach in September 1986, with the inaugural squad, comprising a majority of players from the West Australian Football League (WAFL), unveiled in late October. The Eagles benefitted from a strong WAFL competition and very loose transfer restrictions relative to later expansion teams, with early success seen as a key factor to promoting the new national competition. Ross Glendinning, recruited from , was made the club&#x27;s first captain as one of the few players with previous VFL experience. The team&#x27;s first senior match in the VFL was played against at Subiaco Oval in late March 1987, with West Coast defeating Richmond by 14 points. Having won eleven games and lost eleven games for the season, the club finished eighth out of fourteen teams. At the end of the season, John Todd, the coach of in the WAFL, replaced Alexander as West Coast&#x27;s coach. The club made the finals for the first time in 1988, but lost form the following season, winning only seven games to finish 11th on the ladder.

===1990–1999: Malthouse era and dual premierships===

Todd was sacked at the end of the 1989 season, and was replaced by Mick Malthouse, who had previously coached . With the competition having rebranded itself as the Australian Football League (AFL) at the start of the 1990 season, West Coast finished third on the ladder at the conclusion of the home-and-away season, and progressed to the preliminary final before losing to , having been forced to play four consecutive finals in Melbourne.

John Worsfold replaced Steve Malaxos as captain for the 1991 season, and the club finished the season as minor premiers for the first time, losing only three games. In the finals series, West Coast progressed to the grand final, but were defeated by by 53 points. Peter Sumich kicked 111 goals during the season, becoming the first West Coast player to reach a century of goals, as well as the first-ever left-footer. In 1992, West Coast finished fourth on the ladder, but again progressed to the grand final, defeating by 28 points to become the first team based outside Victoria to win a premiership. Having slipped to third in 1993, the club finished as minor premiers the following season, and went on to again defeat Geelong in the grand final to win its second premiership in three years. In 1995, a second AFL team based in Western Australia, the Fremantle Football Club, with the two clubs&#x27; subsequent rivalry branded as the &quot;Western Derby&quot;. West Coast made the finals in every year that remained in the 1990s, but failed to reach another grand final, with a fourth-place finish in 1996 their best result. Worsfold retired at the end of the 1998 season, and was replaced by his vice-captain, Guy McKenna, who served as captain until his retirement two seasons later.

===2000–2005: Struggles, rebuild and Worsfold era===

Malthouse left West Coast at the end of the 1999 season to take up the senior coaching position with , and was replaced by Ken Judge, who had been coach of . The 2000 and 2001 seasons were marked by a rapid decrease in form after the loss of several key senior players, culminating in a 14th-place in 2001, at the time the worst in the club&#x27;s history. Round eighteen of the 2000 season marked the club&#x27;s final match at the WACA Ground, which had been used concurrently with Subiaco Oval since the club&#x27;s inception. Judge was sacked on 5 September 2001, just days after a 112-point loss to , their 10th loss in 2001 by over 60 points. He was replaced by the club&#x27;s former captain John Worsfold, who had been serving as assistant coach at .

The club made the finals in 2002, 2003, and 2004, but each time failed to progress past the elimination final. Ben Cousins was made sole captain of the club in 2002, having shared the role with Dean Kemp the previous season. During this time, the team was boosted by a number of high picks in the AFL draft gained as a result of the previous poor finishes. Chris Judd, who had been taken with pick three in the 2001 National draft, won the Brownlow Medal as the best player in the competition in 2004, becoming the first West Coast player to win the award. In 2005, the Eagles won 15 of their first 16 games, and were 20 points clear on top of the ladder at stages, but they eventually slipped to second behind . They progressed to the grand final against , where they were defeated by four points. Chris Judd received the Norm Smith Medal.

For the second consecutive year, the Brownlow Medal was won by an Eagles player, with Ben Cousins and Daniel Kerr finishing first and second, respectively.

===2006–2010: Third premiership, controversies and final misses===

West Coast finished as minor premiers for a third time in 2006, with seventeen wins from 22 games. In the 2006 finals series, the club lost the qualifying final to Sydney by one point, but after defeating the and the Crows in the semi- and preliminary final, respectively, again progressed to the grand final, where the Eagles defeated Sydney by a point in an exact reversal of the score in the qualifying final. The two grand finals in 2005 and 2006 were part of a series of close games between the two clubs that resulted in a total difference of thirteen points across six games, an AFL record.

The club finished third during the regular 2007 season, but after a series of late-season injuries lost both its games during the final series. During the past few seasons, the club had been impacted by a series of highly publicised off-field controversies involving allegations of recreational drug use, nightclub assaults, and links to outlawed motorcycle gangs. Michael Gardiner was traded after crashing his car while drunk, and Ben Cousins resigned the captaincy of the club prior to the 2006 season after being charged with evading a police breath test, with Chris Judd taking over as captain. Cousins was sacked at the end of the 2007 season after being arrested for possession of drugs, while Judd requested to be traded back to Victoria, and was traded to in exchange for a key forward, Josh Kennedy, and several draft picks. Darren Glass, the club&#x27;s full-back since the retirement of Ashley McIntosh in 2003, was then appointed captain. These controversies were followed by a series of poor seasons on-field, culminating in the club&#x27;s first wooden spoon, after winning only four games in 2010. The three-year period between 2008 and 2010 was the longest time in the club&#x27;s history without a finals appearance.

===2011–2013: Breakthrough years===

Despite predictions of another bottom-four finish in 2011, West Coast won 16 games to finish in the top four, becoming the first team since the in 1998 and 1999 to reach a preliminary final after finishing last the previous season.

West Coast&#x27;s strong form continued into 2012, losing the 2012 NAB Cup grand final to and spending the early part of the season on top of the table. They eventually finished fifth and bowed out in the semi-finals to . The Eagles went into 2013 as premiership favourites, although injuries and poor form saw the club finish in thirteenth position on the ladder, with the club losing its final three games by an average of 71 points. Coach John Worsfold resigned on 5 September 2013. 
===2014–2024: Simpson era, fourth premiership and downfall===
Former player Adam Simpson was announced as the team&#x27;s new coach for the 2014 season. Darren Glass was initially renamed as captain, but retired from football after round 12. He was replaced by five acting co-captains for the remainder of the season – Shannon Hurn, Josh Kennedy, Eric Mackenzie, Matt Priddis, and Scott Selwood. West Coast had a strong preseason and won their opening three matches, although they eventually finished in ninth position. During the season the club were labelled as &quot;flat track bullies&quot; due to beating lower placed teams by large margins, yet failing to defeat teams above them on the ladder. Midfielder Matt Priddis became the third Eagles player to win a Brownlow medal, winning the 2014 medal at the end of the season.

On 7 December 2014, Shannon Hurn was appointed as sole captain for 2015 and beyond. At the start of the 2015 season, West Coast lost two of their opening three games and suffered injuries to key players. Despite this, they went on to lose only three more games for the rest of the home and away season, finishing behind local rivals in second position. The Eagles went on to defeat and in the qualifying and preliminary finals by 32 and 25 points respectively to qualify for the 2015 Grand Final, their first since 2006, only to lose to Hawthorn by 46 points. The following season ended up being a disappointment, with the team failing to produce another top 4 finish in spite of a late form reversal. In their elimination final, the heavily favoured Eagles were defeated at home by the Western Bulldogs, who went on to claim the 2016 premiership.

In 2017, West Coast finished in eighth position on the table. A thrilling finish against Adelaide in the last game at Subiaco was enough to put them into their third consecutive finals series under Simpson. Their percentage of 105.7% edged out Melbourne, who finished with the same number of wins and an almost identical percentage of 105.2%. Remarkably, their elimination final away against ended up a tie after regulation time and was sent to extra time. The Eagles controversially won after the siren courtesy of a Luke Shuey goal. The following week they were soundly defeated away by , in front of the lowest finals crowd in over 100 years.

Few predicted West Coast would contend in season 2018, with most having them outside the 8. After losing the inaugural game at the new Optus Stadium against the Sydney Swans, West Coast went on to win 10 in a row to surge to top of the ladder, including defeating Hawthorn at Etihad and Richmond, the eventual minor premiers. However, injuries to star forwards Josh Kennedy and Jack Darling saw them struggle, losing 3 games in a row including to Sydney for a second this time at the SCG. Despite injuries, they managed to rebound and stabilise. The Eagles&#x27; form at the MCG had long been criticised, and round 17 against an in-form Collingwood who had won 7 of the previous matches was seen as a stern test. The match was fairly close throughout, until the Eagles got on top in the last ten minutes of the third quarter to win by a commanding 35 points. The victory was bittersweet, however, as the All-Australian ruckman Nic Naitanui went down with an ACL for the second time after his 2016 injury, putting him out for the rest of the season. In round 20 star midfielder Andrew Gaff was suspended for 8 weeks for a hit on Fremantle player Andrew Brayshaw. Following this many dismissed the Eagles, believing they were unable to win the flag. The following week there was a bright spot in a dark period, as Jeremy McGovern kicked a goal after the siren at Adelaide Oval to pinch the game from Port Adelaide, in similar circumstances to West Coast&#x27;s win over Port in the 2017 elimination final.

The Eagles finished the 2018 home and away season second on the ladder with 16 wins and 6 losses – their best result since 2006 – earning the right to host the second qualifying final against third-placed Collingwood at Optus Stadium. Collingwood led for most of the close, hard-fought match, before the Eagles again pulled away in the last quarter to win by 16 points.

In the 2018 second preliminary final, the Eagles faced the fifth-placed Melbourne Demons, a team whose impressive end-of-season form had begun with a victory over the Eagles at Optus Stadium in round 22. What was touted as a close-fought match instead became a blowout. West Coast led 10.9.69 to 0.6.6 at half time, Melbourne becoming the first team since 1927 to fail to score a goal in a half of finals football. West Coast eventually won by 66 points, 121 to 55.

In the 2018 grand final, West Coast again played Collingwood, who had upset Richmond in the first preliminary final the week prior. In a match dubbed an all-time classic, Collingwood led by as much as 29 points in the first quarter, but the resilient Eagles managed to claw their way back into the contest, and with just over 2 minutes left, a brilliant play set up by a Jeremy McGovern intercept mark and a further sensational mark by first year player Liam Ryan saw Dom Sheed score a goal from a tight angle to put the Eagles 4 points in front. The Eagles went on to win 79 to 74, claiming their fourth premiership in front of 100,022 at the MCG. Luke Shuey won the Norm Smith Medal.

The Eagles started their 2019 premiership defence in indifferent fashion, suffering three heavy defeats in the first six weeks of the 2019 season. The reigning premiers recovered magnificently, winning 12 of their next fourteen matches, but missed out on a spot in the top four after an upset 38-point loss to Hawthorn in round 23. The Eagles finished fifth on the AFL ladder with a 15–7 win-loss record. They thrashed Essendon by 55 points in the first elimination final but their premiership defence was brought to a premature end the following week, losing to minor premiers Geelong by 20 points in the first semi-final.

The 2020 season began with a lacklustre win over Melbourne in Round 1 in March, after which followed a hiatus due to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 virus. Games resumed in June, with West Coast playing their games in a Queensland hub environment, going 0–3 in June to begin Round 5 in 16th place. From there, West Coast recovered to sit in 5th place with a record of 12–5 at the end of Round 18. Despite being undefeated at their Perth home ground during the regular season, the Eagles bowed out in the first week of the finals after an upset one-point defeat to Collingwood in the first elimination final at Optus Stadium.

The 2021 season proved to be the end of a successful era for the Eagles. West Coast struggled to find their best form throughout the year and ultimately missed the finals for the first time since 2014, finishing ninth on the ladder with 10 wins and 12 losses. With crosstown rival Fremantle finishing 11th, it was the first season since 2009 that neither Western Australian team featured in the finals series.

COVID and an extensive injury list saw many key players sidelined and West Coast&#x27;s performance decline rapidly over the next two years. The 2022 season saw the Eagles finish 17th on the ladder with 2 wins and 20 losses, avoiding the wooden spoon by percentage. The 2023 season was West Coast&#x27;s worst season in history, losing five games by more than 100 points on the way to an 18th-placed finish with 3 wins and 20 losses, thus claiming the second wooden spoon in the club&#x27;s history.

On 9 July 2024, following no improvement in on-field performances despite the best player availability in three seasons, the club announced that Adam Simpson had been sacked as coach.

==Finance and ownership==
The West Coast Eagles have been owned by the West Australian Football Commission (WAFC) since 1989. The club was originally owned and operated by Indian Pacific Limited, a publicly listed company that was delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange in 1990 after 75% of the shares were bought out by the WAFC. The last minority shareholders were bought out in 2000. During the 2010s West Coast paid approximately $3 million in rent to the WAFC for the use of Subiaco Oval, and 50–70% of overall profits. In 2001, a South African investment company, Southern African Investments Limited, had proposed a AUD$25-million deal for a 49-percent stake in the club, with the bid being rejected in 2003. In 2011, it was reported that the AFL had lobbied to take over the ownership of both the Eagles and the Fremantle Football Club from the WAFC.

In 2023, the West Coast Eagles reported a $1.9 million operating surplus.

==Membership and attendance==

=== Membership ===
In 2011, the West Coast Eagles had 54,745 members, which was a club record at the time, and the fourth-highest overall in the AFL. Membership numbers were limited by the capacity of Subiaco Oval, which held 43,500 seats, with 39,000 reserved exclusively for club members. In 2012, the cost of an adult club membership was $283, the most of any club in the AFL. At that time, the waiting list was in excess of 20,000 people, or around four years. In July 2015, the club reached a record high of more than 60,000 members, which was the highest for a club in Western Australia, as well as being the sixth highest in the league.

Membership expanded rapidly after the club moved its home games to Optus Stadium and won the 2018 premiership. In 2019, the club reached 90,445 members, becoming the second club in history to pass the 90,000 mark and having the second highest membership in the competition. The club recorded more members than any other AFL team in 2020 (100,776) and 2021 (106,422).

=== Attendance ===
The highest individual crowd to watch a West Coast game at Optus Stadium is 59,608 which was between West Coast and Melbourne in the preliminary final of 2018. The highest-attended home game at Subiaco Oval was against in the 2012 elimination final, which was attended by 41,790 people.

In 2011, 455,899 people attended West Coast home games, equating to an average of 37,992 people per game. In 2018, West Coast had the second highest home ground attendance of any AFL club, averaging 53,250 for its 11 home games (the highest was Richmond, which averaged 61,175).

The highest attendance for any game featuring West Coast was against in the 2018 grand final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, attended by 100,022 people. In terms of television audience, on average 519,000 people viewed West Coast Eagles games in 2011, with a high of 1,074,000 viewers for the round 16 game against .

=== Number one ticket holder ===
The number-one ticket holder is a position in most AFL clubs give to a well-known supporter of the club. West Coast&#x27;s website lists &quot;longevity of service&quot;, &quot;passion for the club&quot;, &quot;contribution to the community of Western Australia&quot; and &quot;the level at which they are recognised in their chosen profession by the community&quot; as criteria for the position. Number-one ticket holders generally serve for two years.

==Club identity==
===Symbols and uniform===

West Coast&#x27;s official colours are royal blue and gold. The club had previously used navy blue in place of royal blue between 1995 and 2017, but returned to the club&#x27;s original colours prior to the 2018 season.


The club&#x27;s current logo features the head of a wedge-tailed eagle in the royal blue and gold colours of the club with the words &quot;West Coast Eagles&quot; written underneath. It was introduced prior to the 2018 season and aimed to present a more realistic portrayal of an eagle than the previous logo. The previous logo, in use between 2000 and 2017, featured a more heavily stylised wedge-tailed eagle. The club&#x27;s current and former logos have all incorporated a stylised eagle&#x27;s head, always facing east (i.e. towards the right, where east appears on most maps) to represent the eagle eyeing off its prey in the eastern states.

As part of the AFL&#x27;s Mascot Manor program, a bald eagle club mascot, Rick &quot;The Rock&quot;, was created in 2003 to promote the club to junior players. The mascot is in part named after the song. A real wedge-tailed eagle, Auzzie, has flown around the field before matches at West Coast home games since 2007.

In 2018, the Eagles&#x27; home guernsey saw a return of the club&#x27;s former &#x27;royal blue&#x27; design used prior to 1999, updated to feature the club&#x27;s new logo. The club&#x27;s away strip, which already used a variation of the design with the royal blue and gold colours swapped around, as updated to feature the new logo but otherwise remained relatively unchanged. Between 2000 and 2015, the club&#x27;s home jumper design featured a stylised eagle on a tricolour of navy blue, white and gold. This jumper was introduced during the 2000 season along with a much-criticised ochre away jumper as part of a rebrand of the club to coincide with the new millennium. The ochre jumper was later dropped at the end of 2002 in favour of an updated version of the club&#x27;s former royal blue jumper, which was worn during their 1992 and 1994 premierships. Starting in 2010, the Eagles also wore a third, predominantly white guernsey in order to avoid visual clashes with teams who used similar colours. It was dropped as the club&#x27;s designated clash jumper at the end of 2016, in favour of an updated version of their original 1987 guernsey. During October 2015, the club announced a navy version of the royal blue jumper would replace the tricolour guernsey as the club&#x27;s home uniform from 2016, and was used until the introduction of the current design. The Eagles rebranded to its current brand on 1 November 2017, ahead of the club&#x27;s move to Perth Stadium from 2018.

===Uniform evolution===
West Coast&#x27;s uniform changes throughout their history:
===Sponsorship===
As part of West Coast&#x27;s (and the AFL&#x27;s in general) efforts to develop the game outside of Australia, the club partners with a number of internationally based football clubs, providing them with guernseys and other equipment. There are currently Eagles-affiliated clubs (also referred to as &quot;sister clubs&quot;) in Cambodia (the Cambodian Eagles), Canada (the Toronto Eagles), China (the Shanghai Eagles), Italy (the Milano Eagles), and Sweden (the Karlstad Eagles). West Coast is also responsible for sponsoring FootyWILD, a program similar to Auskick held in KwaZulu-Natal, a province of South Africa.

===Song===
The club&#x27;s official team song is &quot;We&#x27;re the Eagles&quot;, composed by Kevin Peek, a former member of the progressive rock band Sky, and initially recorded at Peek&#x27;s studio in Roleystone. The current version of the song goes as follows:

: &quot;Born is pride,&quot; &quot;from isolation&quot;
: &quot;Our fortress built,&quot; &quot;we cross the nation&quot;
: &quot;Our colours share,&quot; &quot;the West Coast sky&quot;
: &quot;Our will to win will never die,&quot;
: &quot;We&#x27;re the Eagles, the West Coast Eagles&quot;
: &quot;And we’re here to show you why&quot;
: &quot;We’re the big birds, kings of the big game&quot;
: &quot;We&#x27;re the Eagles, we’re flying high&quot;

: &quot;We stick together,&quot; &quot;through thick and thin&quot;
: &quot;We grow as champions&quot; &quot;from within&quot;
: &quot;Our club knows,&quot; &quot;it&#x27;s more than winning&quot;
: &quot;It&#x27;s West Coast magic,&quot; &quot;and it&#x27;s just beginning&quot;
: &quot;We&#x27;re the Eagles, the West Coast Eagles&quot;
: &quot;And we’re here to show you why&quot;
: &quot;We’re the big birds, kings of the big game&quot;
: &quot;We&#x27;re the Eagles, we’re flying high&quot;

: &quot;We&#x27;re the Eagles, we’re flying high&quot;

The original 1987 version, which was played after the 1992 and 1994 grand final victories, featured anti-Victorian verses (&quot;For years, they took the best of us and claimed them for their own... So watch out, all you know-alls, all you wise men from the East&quot;) and a different musical structure. It was eventually altered in the late-1990s. The re-recorded version had new verses added by Ken Walther, who also composed Fremantle&#x27;s 1995 team song. A modified version of the late-1990s song has been used from 2018 to 2019. Ahead of the Eagles&#x27; appearance in the 2015 Grand Final, the West Australian Symphony Orchestra created an orchestral version of the song. In 2020, the club announced an updated version of the song, composed by Ian Berney and with vocals from Ian Kenny, both of Perth band Birds of Tokyo. &quot;Eagle Rock&quot;, a 1971 song recorded by Daddy Cool, is also traditionally played at home games after wins.

===Headquarters, training and administration base===
The West Coast Eagles had its original primary training and administration base at Subiaco Oval from 1987 until 2019, the club then moved its primary training and administration base to Mineral Resources Park in 2019.

==Rivalries==

The club&#x27;s strongest rivalry is with the Fremantle Football Club, the only other AFL club based in Western Australia. The two teams play off in the Western Derby twice each home-and-away season. Overall, 56 derbies have been played, with the Eagles winning 32 and Fremantle winning 24. West Coast currently hold the record for the most consecutive derby wins after winning their 11th in a row in round 7 of the 2021 AFL season. Derbies usually incorporate a near sold-out crowd. From 1995 to 2017, when the club played at Subiaco Oval, the average crowd was 39,910 people per game, out of a total capacity of 43,600 people. From 2018 to 2021, the average crowd at Optus Stadium was 56,033 (excluding two games in 2020 and 2021 played with reduced or no crowd due to COVID-19 restrictions), out of a total capacity of 60,000 people.

The club&#x27;s earliest rivalry was with VFL powerhouse the Hawthorn Hawks. This rivalry stemmed from a series of memorable matches in the early 1990s, most notably the 1991 Grand Final. It was considered the first ever interstate rivalry in the competition, although it had fallen into irrelevance in later years. 24 years later in 2015, the two clubs met again in another grand Final, which Hawthorn won in convincing fashion.

Other rivalries include with , and a rivalry with the Sydney Swans, which stems from a series of six matches between 2005 and 2007, including both the 2005 and 2006 Grand Finals, in which the total points difference was 13, the lowest of all-time. This sequence included three one-point matches between the 2006 qualifying final and round one of the 2007 season.

==Reserves team==

The West Coast reserves are the reserves team of the club, playing in the West Australian Football League.

===History===
West Coast never competed in the VFL/AFL reserves. In 1999, the entered into a host-club arrangement with the Claremont Football Club. The affiliation only lasted a year, and from 2000 until 2001 the Eagles were aligned with the Perth Football Club.

From 2012 until 2013, the WAFL clubs voted to end host-club arrangements, and the Eagles (as well as Fremantle) returned to an affiliation with the entire WAFL.

A host-club arrangement returned in 2014 with the Eagles in an alignment with the East Perth Football Club, but it ended at the end of the 2018 season when the Eagles chose to field a stand-alone reserves team.

The reserves side initially had success, finishing fourth at the end of the 2019 season. They did not compete in 2020 because of the AFL&#x27;s COVID-19 protocols, but returned in 2021, fishing last.

West Coast only managed a single win in 2022. In 2023, the side suffered five losses of 100 points or more in the first 12 rounds of the season, with informal talks held about a possible forfeit of their game against Subiaco, although this did not happen. Their 19-game losing streak ended in round 13 after a draw against Perth.

== AFL Women&#x27;s team ==
In September 2017, West Coast Eagles were granted a license by the AFL to compete in the AFL Women&#x27;s league from the start of the 2020 season. The club shares home games between Lathlain Park, Perth Stadium and Leederville Oval.

<text>A lowrider or low rider is a customized car with a lowered body that emerged among African American &amp; Mexican American youth in the 1940s. &quot;Lowrider&quot; also refers to the driver of the car and their participation in lowrider car clubs, which remain a part of African American Hip Hop culture &amp; Chicano culture and have since expanded internationally. These customized vehicles are also artworks, generally being painted with intricate, colorful designs, unique aesthetic features, and rolling on wire-spoke wheels with whitewall tires.

Lowrider rims are generally smaller than the original wheels. They are often fitted with hydraulic systems that allow height adjustable suspension, allowing the car to be lowered or raised by switch. From 1958 to 2023, the California Vehicle Code made lowriding illegal, which was ultimately criticized as unnecessary and discriminatory toward Chicano and broader Latin American culture. 

==Origin and purpose==
Lowrider car culture began in Los Angeles, California, in the mid-to-late 1940s, and grew during the post-war prosperity of the 1950s within African-American &amp; Mexican-American youth culture. Conversion of standard production vehicles included adding lowering blocks and cut-down spindles, reduced-length suspension spring coils, and creating &quot;Z frames&quot; from stock straight frames. The purpose of lowriders, as their motto &quot;Low and Slow&quot; suggests, is to cruise as slowly and as smoothly as possible.

==Legal issues==

Section 24008 of the California Vehicle Code went into effect on January 1, 1958, prohibiting cars modified to shift the vehicle body lower than the bottoms of its wheel rims. In 1959, mechanic Ron Aguirre bypassed the law by installing hydraulics that could quickly toggle the height of a General Motors X-frame chassis.

Lowriding became widely popular in the 1980s and 1990s, and bans were enacted in many California cities. It regained popularity a little in 2009, then significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In the 2020s, activists argued that the practice was harmless and banning it was simply the result of prejudice against Mexican-Americans. San Jose and Sacramento repealed their bans in 2022 that had been enacted in 1986 and 1988, respectively. In 2022, the California State Assembly unanimously passed a resolution urging all remaining cities with bans (including National City, which banned it in 1992) to repeal them. In 2023, California rescinded state restrictions on the height of vehicle bodies and superseded local regulations against cruising. 

In 2020, police in Albuquerque, New Mexico introduced a lowrider police car in a reversal of the city&#x27;s anti-lowriding policies.

==Adding height adjustable suspension==
In 1959, a customizer named Ron Aguirre developed a way of bypassing the law with the use of hydraulic Pesco pumps and valves that allowed him to change ride height at the flick of a switch. Ron Aguirre developed this modification with help from his father, after conceiving of the idea. Aguirre&#x27;s motivation was to stop being targeted with traffic tickets, as he had been by local police in his city of Rialto, California after the statewide ban was enacted.

==Role of the Chevrolet Impala==
1958 saw the emergence of the Chevrolet Impala, which featured an X-shaped frame that was perfectly suited for lowering and modification with hydraulics. The standard perimeter-type frame was abandoned, replaced by a unit with rails laid out in the form of an elongated &quot;X.&quot; Chevrolet claimed that the new frame offered increased torsional rigidity and allowed for a lower placement of the passenger compartment. This was a transitional step between conventional perimeter frame construction and the later fully unitized body/chassis, the body structure was strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall. This frame was not as effective in protecting the interior structure in a side impact crash, as a conventional perimeter frame.

==Lowrider culture==
Lowrider cars had their origins in the 1940s, when Mexican American veterans began customizing vehicles to run &quot;low and slow&quot;, a contrast to the hot rod that was customized for speed. During the Chicano Movement in the 1970s, lowriders formed car clubs that began to help their community by using these cars for fundraising. Lowrider cars are typically elaborately painted and decorated, often using graphic art of significance to Chicano culture. 

In the 1970s, &quot;Lowrider&quot; magazine promoted an association between lowriders and pachucas, pachucos, and zoot suiters by filling its pages with advertisements and photographs that reflected those fashions. The 1979 play &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; and 1981 movie &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; reinforced the connection between zoot suit fashion and lowriders. &quot;Lowrider&quot; also featured cholas, although some established lowrider clubs disdain chola fashion.

The 21st century boom in lowrider culture is generational, with children being introduced to it by parents and grandparents. Participants view it proudly as an aspect of Latino history in the United States.

=== Southern California ===
At first, lowriders were only seen in places such as Los Angeles, especially in the 1970s on Whittier Boulevard when lowriding came to its peak. Whittier was a wide commercial street that cut through the barrio of the city in Los Angeles, California. Throughout the 1970s that culture spread throughout the Central Valley and San Jose areas of California, helped by release of the funk song “Low Rider” by War, and creation of low riding clubs such as Carnales Unidos in 1975, and further expanded with the publishing of &quot;Low Rider&quot; magazine by San Jose State students in 1977. At its peak in 1988, &quot;Low Rider&quot; magazine had monthly sales of over 60,000 copies. Lowriders were featured in the 1979 film &quot;Boulevard Nights&quot;, which some blamed for associating lowrider culture with street gangs. A mural in Chicano Park celebrates the lowrider culture. In 2024, the Oceanside, California community and its police department collaborated to create a hand-painted lowrider police car, and the San Jose Police Department planned to participate in the city&#x27;s Cinco de Mayo lowrider parade with its own lowrider vehicle. 

===New Mexico===
In the US state of New Mexico, lowriders play a central role in New Mexican culture, particularly of the Hispanos of New Mexico. 

In Albuquerque, cruising on Central Avenue (U.S. Route 66) has become a tradition, particularly on Sundays. The city and Albuquerque Police Department (APD) used to take a firm stance against this practice, but in recent years have reversed this stance, with APD introducing a lowrider police car and the city creating a &#x27;Cruising Task Force&#x27; to &quot;promote responsible cruising&quot; in the city.

The cities of Española and neighboring Chimayó have become hotspots for lowriders in the northern part of the state. Española is billed as the &quot;lowrider capital of the world&quot;.

===Japan===
Lowriding culture has also spread to Japan.

Junichi Shimodaira continues to import and sell these cars through his business, Paradise Road. The spread of lowrider culture and the fame of Paradise Road even attracted the attention of Ed Roth, who is famous for creating custom cars such as hot rods and a prominent figure in Kustom Kulture. Since the introduction of lowriders in Japan and the rise of lowriders in Japan in 2001, it is estimated that there are still 200 car clubs that are related to the lowrider scene that are still active to this day.

===In popular culture ===
The 1975 song &quot;Low Rider&quot; by the band War, highlighting the culture, reached #7 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

In the 1990s, low riders became strongly associated with West Coast Hip hop and G-Funk culture. Eazy-E, Mack 10, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, The Game, Warren G, South Central Cartel, Above the Law and John Cena (In a music video of &quot;Right Now&quot;) among others featured low riders prominently in their music videos.

<doc id="295237" wikidata="Q5281306" url="?curid=295237" title="Disapproval voting">
<text>Disapproval voting is any electoral system that allows many voters to express formal disapproval simultaneously, in a system where they all share some power. Unlike most electoral systems, it requires that only negative measures or choices be presented to the voter or representative. If used to select candidates for an office, or for continuation to a next round of voting or play, it is either single- or multi-winner, as everyone who is not disapproved of is in effect a winner, for that round.

A referendum or a recall election may be said to be minimal forms of disapproval voting. However, usually only one measure or candidate is presented to be disapproved of. True disapproval voting would require more than two choices or representatives, and would ask voters to disavow one or more.

==Voting against==
There are a variety of interpretations of the meaning of a negative vote. The term is sometimes used for allowing a voter to reject the entire field of candidates; it can also mean that the only option offered voters is to vote against one or more candidates, but it is sometimes used for systems that allow a voter to choose whether to vote for or against a candidate.

The psychology of vetoing, protesting, excluding individuals or options, or removing an incumbent, triggers a very different cognitive bias and mode of risk aversion on the part of voters, legislators, or board members - thus it is an over-simplification to think of disapproval as simply &#x27;negative approval&#x27;. Similar asymmetries apply in economics, where they are studied in behavioral finance, and in social sciences and ethics, as the expression of tolerances versus preferences, e.g. as in opinion polls.

The well-known lifeboat game is often portrayed in fiction as having a disapproval voting form, with the poor individual who is most disapproved of being tossed overboard.

General-purpose methods of disapproval voting, e.g. for use in general elections as an electoral reform, have been proposed and discussed by political scientists, but there is little literature on the subject. Most discussion of the issue is concentrated in the theory of consensus decision making, where small numbers of members disapproving of a measure have disproportionate power to block it.

Also, there has been an explosion of application of disapproval voting electoral systems in the reality game show, as noted below. Most people are familiar with the concept only from these shows.

==Disapproval expression in other electoral systems==
Six regions of Russia and several other countries of the region allow voters to vote &quot;against all&quot; candidates. In Canada, one can appear at a polling station and Refused ballot; although this does not count as a vote, refused ballots are tallied separately from spoiled ballots and no-shows.

Any electoral system permits some expression of disapproval, but these are necessarily confused with expressions of choice or approval, leading some to conclude that separating these expressions is best:

After the U.S. presidential election, 2000, some commentators suggested that the ability to approve of a candidate, but disapprove of his or her party affiliation or elements of his or her platform, might be quite important, and that satisfaction of citizens with the political system might well depend on such an electoral reform.

A group of members of the United States Green Party, calling itself &quot;Greens for Gore&quot;, made explicit the fact that they were voting for Gore but supported not the platform of the Democratic Party which nominated him, but that of their own Green Party, which they called on Gore to implement. This is an example of disapproval voting on an informal level, where voters found a way to approve of the candidate, while disapproving of party and platform – and of his key opponent, George W. Bush.

The Soviet Union experimented with a form of disapproval voting for multi-winner elections during the Perestroika, in which voters could cross off the names of candidates they did not approve of, and those with the greatest approval (above a 50% threshold) were elected. Before that, the voting was but a sham: formally a disapproval system with only one name on the ballot, the voters weren&#x27;t even supposed to enter the booth for striking it out to spoil or write in another candidate but immediately drop the collected ballot into the box (hence, no secret suffrage).

It is also often said that votes for a &quot;protest candidate&quot; or a &quot;compromise candidate&quot; can be viewed as disapproval votes, since the undesirable characteristics of the incumbent or alternative, respectively, can be said to be the voters&#x27; main concern. This of course is impossible to determine from the electoral results, as a vote intended to choose that candidate is indistinguishable in most systems from one that was intended to block or disapprove of another.

==Arguments for and against==
Given the prevalence of disapproval as a tool of government, including the criminal law and diplomatic relations, some see voting less as a positive and voluntary choice of a desirable outcome than as a way to reduce losses.

Other advocates of disapproval voting argue that they simply wish to extend to the citizen the powers that are already ceded to the executive, in terms of structure, e.g. many voters formally disapproving should tell the president when to exercise the veto. This is one of many arguments made for deliberative democracy, and advocated by some in the US, e.g. Ralph Nader.

Detractors of this view of civic life note that the complexity of widespread public consultation and letting the public vote down necessary but unpopular expenditures is contrary to the spirit of a representative democracy, and is an impractical and untrusting measure. In part this is a reaction to the negative view of politics, parties, and platforms inherent in any scheme of disapproval.

Advocating disapproval or approval voting may be seen as taking a position on the tolerances versus preferences problem. Some propose that disapproval is more likely to trigger tolerance ideas of the voter, e.g. as in a poor woman choosing a lifetime mate, while approval is more likely to trigger preferences, e.g. as in shopping. This suggestion, like most advocacy of electoral systems, is controversial as it implies that voters cannot measure both tolerances and preferences for themselves, and come to conclusions that consider both.

Another issue is that expressions of disapproval in many societies, especially in Asia, are taken as anti-social. In the government of China, which is structured more as a bureaucracy than as a democracy, an official who rises a level is ratified by others at the level he is entering – no other candidates are presented but abstention as a protest is not uncommon. Support in this ratification vote of less than 67–80% is taken as a strong disapproval – and most likely ends the rise of that individual at his current level. In any such structure, formal disapproval voting may lead to less honest outcomes, if the peer pressure not to be seen to formally disapprove of anyone is extreme.

==Popular use==
The best-known examples of the use of disapproval voting are on reality game shows, e.g. &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, where it is used to eliminate one contestant at a time from the contest, or the variation used on &quot;Boot Camp&quot; where the eliminated contestant can &quot;take one (other) out with him&quot;. (Note: the examples given here are better examples of Coombs&#x27; method than disapproval voting as described here).

==No-confidence voting==
A particular case of disapproval voting is the motion of no confidence. This is a motion of a legislature – rather than a vote of the electorate that elected it – expressing that it disapproves of the current executive, or of certain members of the executive. In the Westminster system, the person or persons who lose a motion of no confidence are normally expected to resign as a matter of constitutional convention, and in the case of an executive a general election normally results, unless a replacement government (typically a new prime minister, who can subsequently appoint a new cabinet) can be approved in a motion of &quot;confidence&quot;. This process is formalized in the United Kingdom by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011.

No-confidence voting can only disapprove; it cannot be used to approve of any particular candidates. This decision is left to political discussions among those involved.

The percentage which triggers a successful no-confidence vote can vary widely, from small values (like 20%) which allow minorities (particularly people with experience in the issue being voted) to decide the outcome, up to unanimity.

<text>Rider University is a private university in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, United States. It consists of three academic units: the Norm Brodsky College of Business, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the College of Education and Human Services. 

==History==
The school was founded as Trenton Business College on October 1, 1865, by Henry Beadman Bryant and Henry D. Stratton, operators of the Bryant and Stratton chain of private business schools. The school was located in Temperance Hall at the corner of South Broad and Front Streets in Trenton, New Jersey. Andrew J Rider was appointed as its first president. President Rider owned 500 acres of cranberry bogs near Hammonton, New Jersey. According to tradition, this is why the school colors are cranberry and white.

The school grew and periodically moved to larger quarters. In 1896 women were admitted. In 1896 the school was renamed Rider Business College. President Rider stepped down the following year.

In 1920 the institution moved to East State Street in Trenton and officially became known as Rider College. In 1922 the New Jersey Board of Education granted Rider College permission to confer the degrees of Bachelor of Accounts and Bachelor of Commercial Science. In 1957 Rider Business College introduced liberal studies leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree.

In 1959 Rider College moved its campus to a suburban tract on Route 206 in Lawrence Township, N.J. On November 15, 1961, President Franklin F. Moore (a 1927 alumnus of the college) announced the gradual reorganization of the college into five separate schools, each headed by a dean who would report to the provost. The changes took effect with the 1962–63 academic year. The five schools included a new School of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Rider College merged with nearby Westminster Choir College (WCC), located in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1991–92. On April 13, 1994, the college became Rider University. 

In 2005 Rider completed its Student Recreation Center (SRC), a 186-bed residence hall, and three-story additions to Ziegler and Hill Residence Halls. The SRC contains locker rooms, a fitness room and various athletic facilities.

Rider University&#x27;s bonds have been rated as junk since 2020. As of 2023, the school has experienced financial difficulties and a loss of a fifth of its student body due to declining enrollment.

===Presidents===
Rider has had seven presidents:
#Andrew Jackson Rider (1866–1898)
#Franklin Benjamin Moore (1898–1934)
#Franklin Frazee Moore (1934–1969)
#Frank Nelson Elliott (1969–1990)
#J. Barton Luedeke (1990–2003)
#Mordechai Rozanski (2003–2015)
#Gregory Dell&#x27;Omo (2015–present)

==Campus==
The Lawrenceville campus is in a suburban area three miles (5 km) north of Trenton and five miles (8 km) south of Princeton. 

===Academic buildings===
Classes are held in Birenbaum Fisher Hall, The Mike and Patti Hennessy Science and Technology Center, the Fine Arts Center, Anne Brossman Sweigart Hall and Lynch Adler Hall. Built in 2011, Lynch Adler Hall is a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design silver certified, building.

==Libraries==
The Franklin F. Moore Library supports the academic programs with a collection of more than 481,000 volumes, 2,000 periodical titles, 650,000 microforms, 134 online databases, electronic access to 42,000 journals, and an audiovisual collection. Westminster Choir College&#x27;s Talbott Library has specialized music resources including 75,000 books, music scores and periodicals, a choral music reference collection of more than 80,000 titles and more than 31,000 sound and video recordings.

Rider Libraries are the official depository for records created by the New Jersey Business Teachers Association and the Eastern Business Teachers Association. In special collections, there is a microfilm collection of Civil War Era diplomatic correspondence between the United States, France and Great Britain. It also holds a major collection of Delaware Valley newspapers reaching back to the 18th century.

==Publications and media==
;&quot;The Shadow Yearbook&quot;: First published in 1923 two years after the institution officially changed its name to Rider College. 
;&quot;The Rider News&quot;: The school&#x27;s student newspaper, founded in 1930, is now published weekly on Wednesdays between September and May.
;WRRC-FM 107.7 The Bronc: Student-run radio station, founded in 1962.
;&quot;Venture&quot;: The literary magazine welcomes submissions from students’ art and literature focusing on any topic
;The Rider University Network (R.U.N.): The student organization produces television programs in the campus studio. Programs are broadcast on campus and online, founded in 2000.

==Student life==
Rider offers more than 150 student clubs and organizations. There are also more than a dozen Greek organizations. In addition to social Greek organizations, there are professional and honorary fraternities.

On March 30, 2007, 18-year-old student Gary DeVercelly died of alcohol poisoning after heavy drinking at a Phi Kappa Tau fraternity house. The incident was tied to a longstanding hazing tradition involving dangerous quantities of alcohol. Two Rider University officials, including the dean of students, and three students were indicted for aggravated hazing; the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. Settlement of the civil lawsuit resulted in major policy concessions by the university.

==Athletics==
Athletic teams are nicknamed the Broncs. The school competes in the NCAA Division I Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. As the MAAC is a non-wrestling conference, Rider&#x27;s wrestling team competes as a member of the Mid-American Conference.

The intercollegiate sports program at Rider was started by coach Clair Bee in the 1920s. Two of the school&#x27;s most famous athletic alumni are former Notre Dame basketball coach and ESPN sportscaster Digger Phelps, who played basketball at Rider from 1959 to 1963, and Jason Thompson, who played basketball at Rider from 2004 to 2008 and was drafted by the Sacramento Kings.

The university competed in football until 1951, when the football team was disbanded.

In 2007, the university redesigned its athletic logo.

<doc id="295239" wikidata="Q389689" url="?curid=295239" title="Rilo Kiley">
<text>Rilo Kiley ( ) is an American indie rock band based in Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1998, the band consists of Jenny Lewis, Blake Sennett, Pierre de Reeder, and Jason Boesel.

The group released their debut album &quot;Take-Offs and Landings&quot; under Seattle-based independent label Barsuk Records in 2001. After that, they released three additional studio albums and several EPs. In 2007, they were signed with Warner Bros. and subsequently made their major-label debut with the album &quot;Under the Blacklight&quot;.

==History==
Rilo Kiley performed their first concert at Spaceland in Los Angeles in January 1998. Their debut EP, &quot;Rilo Kiley&quot; (later reissued as &quot;The Initial Friend EP&quot;), was released in 1999. In 2000, Sennett and Lewis played fictionalized versions of themselves on ABC&#x27;s drama &quot;Once &amp; Again&quot;, with the band also performing &quot;The Frug&quot; on the episode. The band signed with independent label Barsuk Records for its first full-length album, &quot;Take-Offs and Landings&quot;, in 2001. The band later signed with Omaha&#x27;s Saddle Creek Records and released &quot;The Execution of All Things&quot; in 2002. In 2004, they released &quot;More Adventurous&quot; on its imprint, Brute/Beaute Records, which was distributed by major label Warner Bros. Records. The band later signed directly with Warner Bros.
2004 saw a great increase in recognition for the band, as Sennett and Boesel released an album with their band The Elected and Lewis sang backup on The Postal Service&#x27;s &quot;Give Up&quot;. Lewis toured with The Postal Service before heading out on two tours supporting Rilo Kiley&#x27;s &quot;More Adventurous&quot; in the summer and fall of 2004. The album spent late 2004 high on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Heatseekers Chart and was promoted with appearances on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. The band opened for Bright Eyes on the international leg of Conor Oberst&#x27;s tour for 2005&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot; and was the opening act for the North American dates of Coldplay&#x27;s Twisted Logic Tour in Fall 2005. &quot;I Never&quot; and &quot;Ripchord&quot; (from &quot;More Adventurous)&quot; have been featured in several feature films, including &quot;Must Love Dogs&quot;, &quot;Conversations with Other Women&quot;, and &quot;John Tucker Must Die&quot;.

The band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Under the Blacklight&quot; was released August 20, 2007 in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States. Its first single is &quot;The Moneymaker&quot;. For the video, the band cast &quot;real-life porn stars,&quot; which Lewis says were told they were auditioning for &quot;softcore porn.&quot; The second single is &quot;Silver Lining.&quot;

On September 6, 2007, the band began a North American tour in support of &quot;Under the Blacklight&quot;. On this tour, it was joined by Orenda Fink (of Azure Ray) and Kristin Gundred (of Grand Ole Party and Dum Dum Girls).

The group was also known for its charitable contributions, particularly to the Elliott Smith Memorial Fund, in honor of the late singer and friend of the band. Sennett and Lewis participated in a memorial concert for the singer shortly after he died in 2003. In 2007, the band contributed a t-shirt, which was designed by de Reeder for the Yellow Bird Project to benefit the Elliott Smith Memorial Fund.

===Hiatus and breakup===
In a 2010 interview with &quot;Paste&quot;, Jason Boesel said the band was taking a break but working on a compilation of unreleased songs. He also said there were no plans to release a new album in the near future.

In an April 2011 interview, Blake Sennett said, &quot;I would say that if Rilo Kiley were ... hmmm ... a human being ... hmmm ... he&#x27;s probably laying on his back in a morgue with a tag on his toe. Now, I see movies where the dead get up and walk. And when they do that, rarely do good things happen.&quot;

In June 2011, when asked about his &quot;corpse&quot; comment and whether Rilo Kiley was indeed dead, Sennett said, &quot;I never say never. I loved Rilo Kiley—I loved writing with Jenny. I think she&#x27;s a great artist and great to write with. I think we&#x27;re not there yet. Maybe one day we&#x27;ll dust it off and give it a go; I&#x27;d be open to it. I think it was fun—for all of the pitfalls, it was great. I had a great time in Rilo Kiley. I always did.&quot;

A month later, Sennett told AOL Spinner: &quot;I said, &#x27;Fuck that, I can&#x27;t do this anymore.&#x27; That being said, it was probably immature and came from a place of ego. I think that stuff will rear its head in anything you do, depending on the personnel you surround yourself with; things change over time , and people change, and relationships change.&quot;

In February 2013, the band announced a collection of previously released rarities and unreleased material, titled &quot;Rkives&quot;, to be released in April 2013 on DeReeder&#x27;s label, the Little Record Company.

In a 2014 interview with the National Post, Jenny Lewis confirmed the band had officially broken up.

In April 2015, Blake Sennett joined Jenny Lewis and her band on stage at Coachella for a performance of the Rilo Kiley song &quot;Portions for Foxes.&quot;

Since embarking on a solo career, Jenny Lewis has enlisted the help of drummer Jason Boesel for percussion on studio recordings. He was also part of Lewis&#x27; live band for her 2019 tour.

The band is set to reunite at the Just Like Heaven Festival on May 10, 2025 and embark on a North American tour.

== Origin of the band&#x27;s name ==
On the syndicated radio show &quot;Loveline&quot; in August 2005, Sennett explained that he had a dream in which a sports almanac was chasing him: &quot;When it got me, I leafed through it...and I came upon an Australian rules football player from the 19th century named Rilo Kiley. It&#x27;s kind of embarrassing.&quot; When asked by co-host Drew Pinsky if he had ever seen this name in reality, Sennett said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think so, I don&#x27;t think that character exists...If you Google &#x27;Rilo Kiley, &#x27; you will just come back with a lot of pictures of us.&quot; On how this imaginary name became the name for the band: &quot;I wrote it down on a blotter, an office desk when I woke up, and, I don&#x27;t know, I came back to it when we were trying to think of a name, and we thought we&#x27;d use that for one show then change it, &#x27;cause who&#x27;d want that name? Who can remember that anyway?&quot;

In 2005, Sennett told the teletext magazine &quot;Planet Sound&quot; that the name came from a Scottish athlete. On a 2005 episode of the MSNBC entertainment show &quot;MSNBC Entertainment Hot List&quot;, the female host stated that the name came from &quot;old Scottish sports almanacs.&quot; In the following interview segment, Sennett stated, &quot;We just looked in there, and the name of one of the star players from the turn of the century was Rilo Kiley.&quot;

In an interview published in &quot;Q&quot; magazine in September 2007, Sennett stated that Rilo Kiley is named after a character he&#x27;d met in a dream who had predicted the date of Jenny Lewis&#x27; death.

<text>means &quot;outrageous&quot; or &quot;preposterous&quot; + &quot;book&quot; in Japanese. Recently the word has gained another meaning thanks to the activity of Togakkai (the Academy of Tondemo books) which annually award Nihon Tondemo-bon Taisho (Japan Tondemo Book Award), which is similar to the Golden Raspberry Award or the Ig Nobel Prize. Tondemo-bon is defined by the academy as &quot;something amusing from a perspective that differs from what the author intends.&quot; The award covers not just conspiracy theory or pseudoscience but also includes historical revisionism as well as atheists or scientific sceptics who make rather biased attacks toward the former. The members of Togakkai included religious figures as well as scientists and other academics. In Japan, this genre has superseded similar activities of scientific sceptics.

Some winners of the Nihon Tondemo-bon Taisho (Japan Tondemo Book Award):
*&quot;Ninja, Its Origin and Technique&quot;, an ostensibly scholarly exploration of the history of ninja techniques, including the secret magical hand gestures
*&quot;Amazing Science Fiction Weapons&quot;, a notoriously poorly researched book detailing the weapons and plots of science fiction series
*&quot;A Final Warning from Mother Earth&quot;, a guide to the future based on the knowledge of the ancients of Atlantis and other civilizations

<text>Earl Winfield Spencer Jr. (20 September 1888 – 29 May 1950) was a U.S. Navy pilot who served as the first commanding officer of Naval Air Station San Diego. He was the first husband of Wallis Simpson, who later married Edward VIII.

==Early life and military career==
Known as Win, he was born in Kinsley, Kansas, son of Earl Winfield Spencer Sr., a socially prominent Chicago stockbroker, and the former Agnes Lucy Hughes of Jersey. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1910 and in 1917 was sent to San Diego with instructions to set up a permanent naval air station, which was to be used for training exercises, and he became its first commanding officer.

==Personal life==
Spencer was married five times. Four of his wives were:

*Bessie Wallis Warfield (1896–1986), only child of Teackle Wallis Warfield, member of a prominent Maryland family; they married in Baltimore on November 8, 1916. Spencer was alleged to be abusive and an alcoholic. After several separations, the Spencers divorced in December 1927. After a second marriage, to Ernest Aldrich Simpson, and a subsequent divorce, Wallis Spencer married the former King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom and became the Duchess of Windsor.
*Mariam J. Maze (1895–1997) the former wife of Albert Cressey Maze (1891–1943). She was the former Miriam Ham, daughter of George and Katie Anastasia (née Eagels) Ham of Portland, Oregon. They married in September 1928 and were divorced in 1936, the same year Spencer was made a Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy by Benito Mussolini. By this marriage he had one stepson, Robert Claude Maze Sr., Major, USMC (killed in action, 1945). Mariam Spencer married, in 1939, as her third husband, Arthur William Radford, Vice Admiral, USN, future Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

*Norma Reese Johnson (1891–1944), the widow of Homer Sturtevant Johnson, a Detroit manufacturer who died in 1928, and a daughter of Carl Reese, of Detroit, Michigan. Spencer and Johnson were married in Los Angeles, California, on 4 July 1937. By this marriage he had two stepdaughters: Betty L. Johnson, an actress and songwriter (married Balie Peyton Legare Jr. (1908–1984), a jazz musician, whom she divorced in 1942) and Kathryne Johnson (born , married Dell Myron Wade Jr). The Spencers&#x27; wedding was a double wedding with Betty and Peyton Legare, whose wedding in February 1937 in Tijuana, Mexico, was not valid under California law and needed to be resolemnized. The couple separated on February 9, 1940, and were divorced later that year in Santa Monica, California. Both parties charged cruelty, and Norma declared that her husband was plagued by what &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27;s announcement of their acrimonious divorce delicately called &quot;habitual intemperance.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported, &quot;During a stormy session of accusations and counteraccusations Navyman Spencer, charged with cruelty and habitual intemperance, testified that his weekly liquor bill was only about $10, that his wife &#x27;drank as much of it as I did.&#x27;&quot;
*Lillian Phillips (1892–1981), daughter of Robert A. and Ella Burgess Phillips, whom he married 2 October 1941.

==Later life==
Commander Spencer died in Coronado, California. He is buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, California, with his wife Lillian.

==In art, screen portrayals, and literature==
He was portrayed by actor Ryan Hayward in &quot;W.E.&quot;, the 2011 British romantic drama film about the love of Wallis and King Edward VIII co-written and directed by Madonna.

<doc id="295248" wikidata="Q1641315" url="?curid=295248" title="Hypodermic needle model">
<text>The hypodermic needle model (known as the hypodermic-syringe model, transmission-belt model, or magic bullet theory) is claimed to have been a model of communication in which media consumers were &quot;uniformly controlled by their biologically based &#x27;instincts&#x27; and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever &#x27;stimuli&#x27; came along&quot;.

==Concept==
People were assumed to be &quot;uniformly controlled by their biologically based &#x27;instincts&#x27; and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever &#x27;stimuli&#x27; came along&quot;. The &quot;Magic Bullet&quot; theory graphically assumes that the media&#x27;s message is a bullet fired from the &quot;media gun&quot; into the viewer&#x27;s &quot;head&quot;. Similarly, the &quot;Hypodermic Needle Model&quot; uses the same idea of the &quot;shooting&quot; paradigm. It suggests that the media injects its messages straight into the passive audience. This passive audience is immediately affected by these messages. The public essentially cannot escape from the media&#x27;s influence, and is therefore considered a &quot;sitting duck&quot;. Both models suggest that the public is vulnerable to the messages shot at them because of the limited communication tools and the studies of the media&#x27;s effects on the masses at the time. It means the media explores information in such a way that it injects in the mind of audiences as bullets.

Though the &quot;magic bullet&quot; and &quot;hypodermic needle&quot; models are often credited to Harold Lasswell&#x27;s 1927 book, &quot;Propaganda Technique in the World War,&quot; neither term appear in his writing. Rather, Lasswell argued that the rise of political movements across Europe was &quot;an almost inevitable outcomes of the isolation of the individual in an atomized society.&quot; Recent work in the history of communication studies have documented how the two models may have served as strawman theory or fallacy or even a &quot;myth&quot;. Others have documented the possible medical origins of the metaphor of the magic bullet model.

==Two-step flow==

The phrasing &quot;hypodermic needle&quot; is meant to give a mental image of the direct, strategic, and planned infusion of a message into an individual. But as research methodology became more highly developed, it became apparent that the media had selective influences on people.

The most famous incident often cited as an example for the hypodermic needle model was the 1938 broadcast of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and the subsequent reaction of widespread panic among its American mass audience. However, this incident actually sparked the research movement, led by Paul Lazarsfeld and Herta Herzog, that would disprove the magic bullet or hypodermic needle theory, as Hadley Cantril managed to show that reactions to the broadcast were, in fact, diverse, and were largely determined by situational and attitudinal attributes of the listeners.

In the 1940s, Lazarsfeld disproved the &quot;magic bullet&quot; theory and &quot;hypodermic needle model theory&quot; through elections studies in &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot;. Lazarsfeld and colleagues executed the study by gathering research during the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The study was conducted to determine voting patterns and the relationship between the media and political power. Lazarsfeld discovered that the majority of the public remained unfazed by propaganda surrounding Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign. Instead, interpersonal outlets proved more influential than the media. Therefore, Lazarsfeld concluded that the effects of the campaign were not all powerful to the point where they completely persuaded &quot;helpless audiences&quot;, a claim that the Magic Bullet, Hypodermic Needle Model, and Lasswell asserted. These new findings also suggested that the public can select which messages affect and don&#x27;t affect them.

Lazarsfeld&#x27;s debunking of these models of communication provided the way for new ideas regarding the media&#x27;s effects on the public. Lazarsfeld introduced the idea of the two-step flow of communication in 1944. Elihu Katz contributed to the model in 1955 through studies and publications. The model of the two-step flow of communication assumes that ideas flow from the mass media to opinion leaders and then to the greater public. They believed the message of the media to be transferred to the masses via this opinion leadership. Opinion leaders are categorized as individuals with the best understanding of media content and the most accessibility to the media as well. These leaders essentially take in the media&#x27;s information, and explain and spread the media&#x27;s messages to others.

Disagreements about the hypodermic needle theory may be based on how audiences are classified. For example, the pro-hypodermic perspective suggests that despite differing types of audiences, the theory remains valid if a direct effect occurs. However, many anti-hypodermic views instead note that the theory can only be applied if the effect works on a similar, mass group of people. Other interpretation differences depend on whether researchers involve mediating and intervening variables in case studies. This may include the influence of an audience’s prior knowledge and background.

Thus, the two step flow model and other communication theories suggest that the media does not directly have an influence on viewers anymore. Instead, interpersonal connections and even selective exposure play a larger role in influencing the public in the modern age. Contemporary research suggests that individuals are more likely to form opinions through the two step flow process, and through the role of influencers and opinion leaders on social media outlets. Social media has become an increasingly individualized experience and process, thus users are likely to form opinions based on the content they are exposed to and interact with.

==Contemporary one-step flow==
More recently, the use of big data analytics to identify user preferences and to send tailor-made messages to individuals led back to the idea of a &quot;one-step flow of communication&quot;, which is in principle similar to the hypodermic needle model. The difference is that today&#x27;s massive databases allow for the mass customization of messages. So it is not one generic mass media message, but many individualized messages, coordinated by a massive algorithm. For example, empirical studies have found that in Twitter networks, traditional mass media outlets receive 80–90% of their Twitter mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from average Twitter users. However, these same studies also argue that there is a multitude of step-flow models at work in today&#x27;s digital communication landscape.

==Theory application in the digital age==
Although the hypodermic needle theory was studied more in depth in the early half of the 20th century, the integration of social media platforms further tests the theory’s application. The invention of the internet and popularity of social media channels makes social interaction a two-way street. Through this, influencers, leaders, politicians, brands and individuals can communicate with one another. This social relationship has led to behavior changes in the digital age, some of which align with characteristics of the hypodermic needle theory.

The hypodermic needle theory is based purely on assumptions about human behaviors. But, contemporary research adds that these behaviors and methods are always evolving and changing. In the field of science and information technology, researchers suggest using social media literacy as a tool for combating passive media consumption. They suggest increasing critical thinking use, and questioning the validity and credibility of what is on social media platforms. Similarly, contemporary research considers libraries and information centers as a form of media because of their influence over knowledge and source selection.

<text>The Execution of All Things is the second studio album released by Los Angeles-based indie pop band Rilo Kiley in 2002. The album was released by Saddle Creek Records in Omaha, Nebraska, and the aforementioned features show the influence of that studio&#x27;s associated Omaha Sound. It was recorded at Presto! in Lincoln, Nebraska.

==Background and recording==
During their tour supporting &quot;Take Offs and Landings&quot;, Rilo Kiley began conceptualizing their second album. While performing in San Francisco, the band met Tim Kasher of Cursive, who was touring with his side project, the Good Life. Following their meeting, Rilo Kiley accompanied Kasher to Omaha, Nebraska, where he introduced them to Presto! Recording Studios, operated by Mike and A.J. Mogis. At the time, the Mogis brothers were establishing Omaha, along with Saddle Creek Records, as centers of early 2000s &quot;Omaha Sound&quot;. 

In a 2002 interview, Jenny Lewis noted that the band had already been fans of the Omaha music scene, having purchased Bright Eyes’ &quot;Fevers and Mirrors&quot; the previous year. Reflecting on the experience, Lewis commented that this album more accurately captured the band’s live energy compared to their debut album, &quot;Take Offs and Landings&quot;, which was recorded at home. “With &quot;Take Offs and Landings&quot;, we were still learning how to record and perform,” Lewis said. “This one better reflects how we play live.” The recording sessions took place over several weeks in March 2002, with Lewis describing the studio environment as cold and alcohol-laden, which influenced the emotional tone of the album’s performances.

Expanding on their previous sound, which mostly incorporated guitars, vocals, percussion, and pianos, the album contains electronic samplings mixed into the songs in a rather unusual and displaced-sounding way. Also, unlike their previous tracks, the lyrics to the songs on &quot;Execution&quot; are very wordy and read like prose. Musically, the record has a very sunny disposition, with bouncing bass lines and catchy melodies complemented by lead singer Jenny Lewis&#x27;s vocal style. Still, the upbeat music is contrasted by the often dark and gloomy subject matter that the lyrics reference. 

The album is strung together by a song broken into pieces that trail between several tracks. &quot;And That&#x27;s How I Choose to Remember It&quot; tells the story of Lewis&#x27; childhood and her parents&#x27; divorce. This theme is visited throughout the album, lyrically filled with childhood recollections of loss, displacement, anger, and hopelessness.

The songs &quot;So Long&quot; and &quot;Three Hopeful Thoughts&quot; feature lead vocals by Blake Sennett. Lewis sings lead on all other tracks. &quot;With Arms Outstretched&quot; played in the final moments of the series finale of &quot;Weeds&quot;, just as it had in the pilot; the song also features in the first episode of the miniseries &quot;Looking For Alaska.&quot; &quot;A Better Son/Daughter&quot; was played in the trailer for the first season of the Netflix original series &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;. It is also featured at the end of Hannah Gadsby&#x27;s 2018 Netflix special &quot;Nanette&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Critics received the album positively upon release. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; praised the album&#x27;s music and lyrics saying &quot;the words here are descriptive and articulate, but gracefully rendered&quot; writing that the album surpassed all Rilo Kiley&#x27;s prior work.

===Legacy and impact===
Anne Hathaway called the track &quot;A Better Son/Daughter&quot; &quot;a life-changing song&quot; for helping to improve her mental health during a difficult period of her life in 2009.

Critics again celebrated the album at its 20th anniversary in 2022. &quot;Stereogum&quot; called &quot;Better Son/Daughter&quot; a &quot;towering, monumental achievement&quot; and praised the interconnected nature of all the tracks on the album. &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; noted &quot;the album&#x27;s continued reverberation in a new generation of contemporary artists and listeners&quot; and praised its treatment of mental illness, trauma, and gender. Andrew Sacher of &quot;BrooklynVegan&quot; wrote of &quot;Things&quot;″ influence on 2010s emo music. He saw it impact the genre&#x27;s lyrical focus for that era, helping it move from unrequited love to mental health. &quot;Paste&quot;″s Natalie Marlin recognized that same influence carries into the future of indie rock as well. She saw how well the album fit in a culture &quot;more prone than ever to accommodate piercing, honest lyricism about issues of mental health,&quot; which was partly driven by its impact.

In the years since its release, &quot;Things&quot; has impacted various musicians. In a 2013 interview, indie rock musician Waxahatchee revealed that she had bought the album &quot;when it had just come out&quot; and &quot;listened to [it] so many times.&quot; In a &quot;Talkhouse&quot; essay released the following year, she wrote of feeling &quot;a massive surge of enthusiasm and revelation&quot; when listening and realized &quot;that I really wanted to make music myself.&quot; She singled out the album&#x27;s &quot;musical theater-like vocal glory&quot; and its lyrics&#x27; &quot;airtight incisiveness&quot; as inspiring to her. Harmony Tividad, bassist for former duo Girlpool, called opening track &quot;The Good That Won&#x27;t Come Out&quot; one of her all-time favorite songs.

<doc id="295256" wikidata="Q513037" url="?curid=295256" title="Angelyne">
<text>Angelyne (born Ronia Tamar Goldberg, October 2, 1950) is an American singer, actress, media personality, and model who came to prominence in 1984 after the appearance of a series of billboards in and around Los Angeles, California, with only one word, &quot;Angelyne&quot;, picturing her posing suggestively. These caught the attention of local media outlets, and soon she received several offers for film roles, magazine interviews, and television show appearances.

The main trademark of her celebrity persona is a pink Corvette. Her billboards have been featured in a number of movies and television series, including the opening credits of &quot;Moonlighting&quot; and atop the building occupied by producer Harry Zimm (played by Gene Hackman in the movie &quot;Get Shorty&quot;), and have been spoofed in shows such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, and &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;. Angelyne was noted for concealing her real name, age, and identity, which did not become public knowledge until 2017.

In 1978, she joined her then-boyfriend&#x27;s punk rock band Baby Blue, which performed in clubs around Los Angeles, but never became financially successful. In 1982, she released her self-titled debut album and her first posters began appearing as a part of the album&#x27;s promotion. After the launch of a massive billboard campaign in February 1984, she began working on her second album. &quot;Driven to Fantasy&quot; was released in 1986. Angelyne then appeared in small parts in films such as &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot; (1988), &quot;Dangerous Love&quot; (1988), and &quot;Homer and Eddie&quot; (1989).

Angelyne is also an artist; she began painting in 1998 and has had several art shows in Los Angeles. She has run for Governor of California twice, during the recall elections of Gray Davis in 2003 and Gavin Newsom in 2021.

==Early life==
Angelyne&#x27;s previous names and origins became publicly known in a 2017 article by Gary Baum for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. The article cited public records revealing that Angelyne was born in Poland as Ronia Tamar Goldberg to Holocaust survivors who were Polish Jewish. After being liberated from German Nazi concentration camps, including Skarżysko-Kamienna, Bergen-Belsen, and Buchenwald, her parents were married in the Föhrenwald DP camp, and then returned to post-war Poland. The family later settled in Bnei Brak, Israel, before immigrating to the United States in 1959. They moved to the Fairfax District of Los Angeles where she went by the name Renee Tami Goldberg. Goldberg attended James Monroe High School and was married briefly.

== Career ==
In 1978, Angelyne joined her then-boyfriend&#x27;s band Baby Blue. They performed in local clubs in L.A. and once opened along with Rubber City Rebels for the Screamers&#x27; show at the Whisky a Go Go. The punk rock club The Masque served as a rehearsal place for the band. They released a single &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Rebel&quot; with a B-side, &quot;Fantasy Man&quot;. Only 1,000 copies of the record were made and distributed in England.

The band did not receive much attention, so they decided to promote it by posting her picture around town. In 1979, the single &quot;Too Much to Touch&quot; was released under the name Angelyne, also promoted by posters and flyers.

In 1982, she released a self-titled debut album on an independent label Erika Records. The 12&quot; picture disc contained 11 songs, including two versions of &quot;Sexy Stranger&quot;, a cover of Elvis Presley&#x27;s hit &quot;Teddy Bear,&quot; and the main single &quot;Kiss Me L.A.&quot;. Another series of bus-shelter posters promoted the album. In July 1983, Erika Records released another Angelyne single, &quot;My List&quot;, accompanied by a music video.

According to Angelyne, she met wealthy adhesive-free-tape entrepreneur Hugo Maisnik (inventor of Hugo&#x27;s Amazing Tape) in 1982. Maisnik had a display-printing business in Los Angeles. Described as &quot;very eccentric&quot; and a &quot;bored prankster&quot;, Maisnik reportedly saw potential in using Angelyne&#x27;s image and understood the &quot;intricacies of the outdoor-advertising game&quot;. In February 1984, Angelyne&#x27;s first billboard proclaiming &quot;Angelyne Rocks&quot; went up on Sunset Boulevard.

In 1986, she released her second album, &quot;Driven to Fantasy&quot;, on her label, Pink Kitten. An enhanced pink vinyl re-issue of the album was later released in Italy; in 2024, it was re-released on &quot;Pink Corvette vinyl&quot; by Dark Entries. In June 1987, an 85 feet high mural depicting Angelyne was painted on the side of a building on Hollywood and Vine. Her manager allegedly financed the $22,000 painting. The same year, her friend Nina Hagen got her recording with Michael &quot;Doc&quot; Dosco, who had previously worked with Hagen on her album &quot;Nina Hagen in Ekstasy&quot;. He wrote and produced several songs for Angelyne, including &quot;Animal Attraction,&quot; which was later featured in Julien Temple&#x27;s movie &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;, where Angelyne had a cameo. The single was released in 1988 with remixes by Italian producer Pino Toma. Hagen mentioned Angelyne in her song &quot;Super Freak Family,&quot; and her voice can be heard in &quot;Pillow Talk&quot;.

By 1995, she had over 200 billboards up all over Los Angeles.

In 1997, Angelyne launched her website where she offered tours around Sunset Boulevard and Hollywood. In 1998, Angelyne pursued another artistic venture and began painting self-portraits. Since then she has had several successful art exhibitions.

In July 2013, Angelyne signed a contract with designer Michael Kuluva to be a face of a limited edition T-shirt for his clothing line Tumbler and Tipsy.

==Political career==
Angelyne was a candidate for Hollywood city council in 2002, if it were to secede from Los Angeles. She ran for office again in 2003, this time for governor of California. Her slogan during the campaign was &quot;We&#x27;ve had Gray, we&#x27;ve had Brown, now it&#x27;s time for some blond and pink.&quot; Her mascot was a pink Maltese named Budda. She finished 29th in a field of 135 candidates, garnering 2,536 votes.

In April 2021, Angelyne announced plans to run in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election of Gavin Newsom. She ran without a party preference. The 50% threshold to recall the incumbent governor was not reached. She received 0.5% of the vote and finished 18th out of 46, the highest candidate without a party preference.

==Portrayals in popular culture==
In 1995, a black-and-white short documentary by Robinson Devor, &quot;Angelyne&quot;, was released.

&quot;The Angelyne Dream Experience&quot;, an experimental film by Dan Kapelovitz, who also worked on her EP &quot;Beauty &amp; the Pink&quot;, was released in 1998. The short film with elements of psychedelia features Angelyne driving in the streets of Los Angeles, greeting her fans and talking about out-of-body experience.

Hugo Maisnik&#x27;s daughter, Katherine Saltzberg, wrote and performed in the 2009 one-woman play &quot;Los Angelyne&quot; about her experience growing up in the shadow of the Angelyne billboards.

A miniseries based on the life of Angelyne, &quot;Angelyne&quot;, starring Emmy Rossum, created by Nancy Oliver, was ordered by Peacock in 2020. The series was executive produced by Sam Esmail and Angelyne. Production of the series was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first trailer was released in April 2020. The series premiered on Peacock in May 2022.

<doc id="295264" wikidata="Q607810" url="?curid=295264" title="Yonge–Dundas Square">
<text>Yonge–Dundas Square, commonly called Dundas Square and officially named Sankofa Square, is a public square at the southeast corner of the intersection of Yonge Street and Dundas Street East in the downtown core of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 

Designed by Brown and Storey Architects, the square was conceived in 1997 as part of revitalizing the intersection. Since its completion in 2002, the square has hosted many public events, performances and art displays, establishing itself as a prominent landmark in Toronto and one of the city&#x27;s prime tourist attractions. Central to the Downtown Yonge entertainment and shopping district, the square is owned by the city and is the first public square in Canada to be maintained through a public–private partnership. The intersection is one of the busiest in Canada, with over 100,000 people crossing the city&#x27;s first pedestrian scramble daily.

Surrounding the square are other major landmarks, including the Toronto Eaton Centre, Ed Mirvish Theatre, and the Citytv building. The square is accessible from the Toronto subway at Dundas station and is connected to Path, Toronto&#x27;s underground pedestrian walkway. The square is continuously illuminated by large billboard screens and corporate logos, which has led to comparison of the square with Times Square in New York City, Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo, and Piccadilly Circus in London.

==History==

In 1998, as part of its Yonge Street Regeneration Project, Toronto City Council approved the expropriation and demolition of the buildings on the site and the construction of Yonge–Dundas Square. The square is a joint project of the city, residents, the McGill Granby Association, the Downtown Yonge Business, and Resident Association, and the Downtown Yonge Business Improvement Area, an association of local businesses. This effort was conceived and spearheaded by Arron Barberian of Barberian&#x27;s Steak House, Robert Sniderman of the Senator Restaurant and Councillor Kyle Rae. Ron Soskolne was retained in 1995 to head up the planning of the regeneration project, and went on to become the chair of the Board of Management for the first decade of the square&#x27;s operation. Designed by Brown and Storey Architects, the square was intended as a new public space in Toronto, somewhat akin to Nathan Phillips Square, designed by Viljo Revell for New City Hall.

In 1999, the square&#x27;s design received the Award of Excellence for significant building in the design stage by the &quot;Canadian Architect&quot; magazine, in recognition of it being an outstanding example of contemporary architecture. The next year, &quot;Architecture&quot; magazine commended the square as a new form of urban space with great presence ... pushes the limits of invention and originality.

Unlike Nathan Phillips Square, however, Yonge–Dundas Square is operated by a separate Board of Management. The site is owned by the City of Toronto and administered by a Board of Management. The board of management for Yonge–Dundas Square was established in 2001, and is the first public–private partnership in Canada to operate a public square. In 2006, the square&#x27;s Wi-Fi hotspot, set up by Wireless Toronto, was voted the best in the city.

Some claim that the intersection is the busiest in Canada, with over 56 million people passing through annually. The square&#x27;s development is cited as modeling New York&#x27;s Times Square, Tokyo&#x27;s Shibuya district, and London&#x27;s Piccadilly Circus. To manage the volume of pedestrians, a pedestrian scramble was installed in August 2008.

The square frequently serves as a venue for public events connected to the city&#x27;s cultural festivals, including NXNE, the Toronto International Film Festival, Luminato, Nuit blanche and Pride Week. On June 29, 2014, the square hosted the official closing ceremonies of WorldPride.

The square is property of the City of Toronto and is regulated by Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 636: Public Squares. These regulations govern activities in the square and the use of the property. As of April 2014, smoking is prohibited on the entire property of the square.

In the wake of the George Floyd race protests and social unrest, controversy arose over the namesake of Dundas Street, Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, whose amendments to Wilberforce&#x27;s abolitionist parliamentary motions ensured the support required in both the House of Commons and House of Lords for the British Empire to ultimately vote to abolish slavery with the Slave Trade Act 1807. 

Toronto City Council voted in 2021 to rename Dundas Street and other civic assets named after Dundas, such as Yonge–Dundas Square. A new name was to be chosen by April 2022; however, it took until December 2023 for City Council to approve the new name of &quot;Sankofa Square&quot;, after a Ghanaian term referring to the act of reflecting on and reclaiming teachings from the past, adopted from the Akan people. Citing costs, Toronto ultimately decided to keep Dundas&#x27; name for the street but to rename Yonge–Dundas Square, the Dundas and Dundas West subway stations, and the Jane–Dundas Public Library.

==Design==
The site is bordered on the north by Dundas Street, on the east by Victoria Street, and on the west by Yonge Street, and on the south by a street named Dundas Square. Dundas Street; an east–west street extended east through Downtown Toronto from near its original eastern terminus near Ossington Avenue by connecting several pre-existing streets: From the west, Agnes Street met Yonge Street at a T-intersection at the present Dundas Street intersection, while from the east, Wilton Street terminated at Yonge approximately 100 metres to the south. In the early 20th century, Dundas was extended east from the Agnes/Yonge Streets intersection to meet with Wilton Street at Victoria Street, by building a link east and southeast to interline with Wilton; creating the present Dundas Street. The cut off section of Wilton from Yonge to Victoria was renamed Dundas Square.

The square is on a slight incline, which architects Brown and Storey have said was intended to evoke a theatrical stage. It is made with modular raised square textured granite slabs (each slab costing approximately $1,500: $1,000 materials plus $500 labour), features a diagonally running zinc canopy along the northern hypotenuse of the &quot;square&quot;, a movable plinth which serves as a stage for concerts and other performances, a row of lighted fountains set directly into the pavement, a row of small trees along the southern edge, a transparent canopy over the plinth, and a new entrance to Dundas subway station below. A series of low, circular stone planters was added to the western side of the square in the summer of 2005.

The square is not square-shaped, but an irregular pentagon. This angled northeastern side of the square is known as the hypotenuse, which features a structure supported by 11 round concrete pillars. This creates an industrial urban aesthetic, which, being to the north, casts no shadows on the rest of the space. The other three sides are square (i.e., at right angles to one another and to Yonge and Dundas Streets). As well, Dundas Square (the street) forms the square&#x27;s southern boundary, running between Yonge and Victoria Streets.

===Features===
The surface of Yonge–Dundas Square is not level; it is sloped upward away from Yonge Street to allow enough height to provide clearance for the Toronto Parking Authority garage entrance. The architects planned the slope of the surface to make it interesting and to accommodate the necessary clearances for what lies underneath. Level P1 houses the washrooms and changerooms, a green room for stage performers, and various utilities rooms, custodial and supply closets, and the water treatment plant and pump rooms for the fountains.
At the southeast and southwest corners of Yonge–Dundas Square are drinking water fountains. The water fountain on the southwest corner (nearest to Yonge Street) is known for its large, cool stream of water that flows down the fountain to drains in the ground. The stream produced by the other fountain is warmer and flows less copiously. On the other hand, the fountain nearest Yonge street is also near a protrusion in the ground that has become a popular seat.

====Fountains====
The centrepiece of the square is the array of fountains designed by Dan Euser of Waterarchitecture. Two rows of ten fountains are spread out across the square&#x27;s main walkway so that visitors have the opportunity to walk through or around the fountains. Unlike many other city fountains, the Yonge–Dundas Square fountains were meant for waterplay and include a sophisticated filtration system that (according to both of the architects) keeps the water at or above &quot;pool quality&quot; water. According to Euser, the water is treated to maintain health standards for waterplay. According to facility administrator Christine MacLean, the granite that was chosen for the entire space has non-slip properties for the safety of those running through or playing in the fountains. Each of the 10 water fountains consists of a stainless steel grille with 30 ground nozzles (arranged in three rows of 10) under it.

The entire rock surface is of a very dark (almost black) colour and effectively absorbs sunlight, thus creating a warm surface on which to rest. The water runs under the dark rock slabs and is thus heated by them, so that the fountain water is solar heated. Three curved lighting masts along the south edge of the square, made of hollow structural steel, have a high-gloss white finish that contrasts with the rough non-slip texture of the black granite, and each support six mercury vapour arc lamps that create evening light that comes from approximately the same directions as natural sunlight does during the day (i.e., from various southerly directions).

The fountains comprise a dynamic art installation and water sculpture in which the 600 water jets are programmed to vary, dynamically, over time. The fountains usually operate 24 hours a day. Other than the aquatic play area in front of the Ontario Science Centre (the centrepiece of Teluscape), Dundas Square is Toronto&#x27;s only 24-hour waterplay area, open all day and night except during special events, maintenance, and other exceptions. The fountains usually run from around mid-April to the end of October, making this one of two aquatic play areas in Toronto that opens very early in the season and closes very late in the season.

To reduce costs, only the middle channel (the middle 10 nozzles of each fountain) can be animated, but the outer two channels can still be globally controlled. The outer two channels are often used to set a background (pedestal) level while the middle channel animates, typically for eight-second intervals. The directionality imposed by the middle channel&#x27;s sequencer encourages bathers to run west rather than east. Moreover, the sequencer makes the bathing experience optimal for joggers who run west at exactly 20 km/h.

Architects Brown and Storey, fountain creator Dan Euser, the firm that initiated the bidding, former Councillor Kyle Rae, and the management of Yonge–Dundas Square have all confirmed that waterplay was one of the intended uses of the space. The fountains are intended to appeal to children and adults, and there is evidence that has been realized.

Because many people drink from the ground spray nozzles (some people even fill up water bottles from the ground sprays), and since waterplay is one of the intended uses, the water is tested daily, between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., by the Toronto health department. The water is treated with bromine, which many bathers prefer to chlorine. There are three separate water treatment facilities, one for each group of ten westmost nozzles in each grille (200 nozzles total), another for the middle row of ten in each grille, and a third for all of the eastmost nozzles. The water that runs into the grilles travels west, under the raised floor of the Yonge–Dundas Square slabs, to the treatment facility under the west end of the waterplay area.

===Surrounding buildings===

Yonge–Dundas Square is located within Downtown Yonge Business Improvement Area (BIA). Other projects in the area include the redevelopment of the Eaton Centre, the construction of a new retail and cinema complex to the north in 2007, called The Tenor (formerly &quot;10 Dundas East&quot;, then &quot;Toronto Life Square&quot; and originally the &quot;Metropolis development project&quot;), and the opening of 33 Dundas Street East to the southeast (on the corner of Victoria and Dundas), which used to be the home of Olympic Spirit Toronto. On October 22, 2007, Rogers Media announced that it would buy this building as a new home for its Citytv and Omni Television stations. This new studio space is now operational.

A &quot;media tower&quot; – a scaffold for billboards, operated by Branded Cities – has been constructed on the northwest corner of Yonge and Dundas. It is advertised as the tallest media tower in the world. Another large media tower, complete with a video screen, is a major feature of the Rogers Media building on the southeast corner of Dundas Square; the video screen usually shows the CITY-TV broadcast. The building that was home to the Hard Rock Cafe (now a Shoppers Drug Mart) on the southwest corner of the square originally features a series of billboards, but these were replaced by a large video screen in 2017. The introduction of the imposing media tower, screens, and brightly illuminated advertising billboards has been too great a sacrifice for some area residents, who feel a loss of the neighbourhood&#x27;s identity and character (see &quot;Controversy&quot;, below).
The redevelopment of the Eaton Centre and the building at Victoria and Dundas were completed in 2004. Toronto Life Square, formerly known as the Metropolis development, began in January 1999 after the City of Toronto expropriated a number of properties, and a phased opening began in 2007. It was renamed &quot;10 Dundas East&quot; after &quot;Toronto Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s parent company, St. Joseph Communications, sued to have the magazine&#x27;s name removed from the building. In 2019, an existing smaller screen and two billboards were replaced by a massive curved video display on the corner of the building facing Yonge and Dundas.

==Criticism==
Criticism ranges from suggestions that the city has missed an opportunity for more green space within the downtown core (or that they have missed an opportunity for what some critics consider more interesting architectural elements) to questions of what the true intent behind the ostensibly public square is. The Toronto Public Space Committee and organizers of Toronto iterations of the Reclaim The Streets phenomenon often point to the square as an example of what they consider a negative trend in urban planning.

The square is surrounded on all sides by gigantic commercial billboards in a redevelopment scheme modeled on New York City&#x27;s Times Square or London&#x27;s Piccadilly Circus. Many have pointed to the square as a prime example of the creeping privatization of public space. Those making this point have been bolstered by the fact that the square&#x27;s board is populated by local businesses and residents. The board of management for the square is a board of the City of Toronto. While there are permit fees for commercial events, community groups can use the square for free under the square&#x27;s community use policy. All events are charged back for staffing and equipment use.

<text>Saint Peter&#x27;s University is a private Jesuit university in Jersey City, New Jersey. Founded as Saint Peter&#x27;s College in 1872 by the Society of Jesus, the university offers over 60 undergraduate and graduate programs to more than 3,600 undergraduate and 2,000 graduate students. Its mascot is the peacock and its sports teams play in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, of which it is a founding member.

The university is located on a campus just south of Journal Square, which is west of Manhattan.

Alumni of the university include a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, a U.S. Senator and members of the U.S. House of Representatives, federal judges, academics, physicians, and CEOs.

==History==
The college was chartered in 1872 as a liberal arts college for men and enrolled its first students in 1878 at Warren Street, in Jersey City, on the present site of its former high school section, St. Peter&#x27;s Preparatory School. In September 1918, the college was closed, along with several other Jesuit colleges and high schools, because of declining enrollment in the face of World War I and because the Jesuits concentrated personnel at other colleges on the East Coast. Although the war ended only two months after its closing, and despite clamoring from alumni, it took until 1930 to re-open the college. The college was temporarily located on Newark Avenue, before moving in 1936 to its current location on the former estate of Edward Faitoute Condict Young on Hudson Boluevard (now Kennedy Boulevard), between Montgomery Street and Glenwood Avenue.

The college was integrated in 1936, when the college admitted its first black student. The college granted an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree to Martin Luther King Jr., in 1965, and was the first Jesuit school to do so.

The college became co-educational in 1966, though women had been admitted to the school&#x27;s evening program in 1930, and a group of 35 women had been admitted due to low enrollment during World War II.


The college has made an effort to reach out into the New Jersey suburbs, with a former satellite campus in St. Michael&#x27;s Villa at Englewood Cliffs opened in 1975 (closed in 2018) and an extension at South Amboy&#x27;s Cardinal McCarrick High School opened in 2003 but closed when high school closed in 2015.

In 1975, the college constructed the Yanitelli Recreational Life Center, a sports complex. Beginning with the 1983 acquisition of its first residence hall, the college has converted four apartment buildings to dormitory use, and constructed three new dormitories Whelan Hall (1994), Millennium Hall (1999) and Panepinto Hall (2022).

===2000-present===
In 2000, Gannon Hall, the science building, completed an $8.2 million renovation.

In 2004, the long-awaited pedestrian bridge over Kennedy Boulevard linked the East Campus and the West Campus.

In 2006, the college began a $50 million capital campaign for a new student center.

On December 24, 2006, college president James N. Loughran was found dead in his home. On May 10, 2007, the board of trustees appointed Eugene J. Cornacchia the 22nd President of Saint Peter&#x27;s College. Cornacchia was the first layperson to serve as president of the 135-year-old Catholic, Jesuit institution. Cornacchia retired in June 2024, and Hubert Benitez was named the 23rd President of Saint Peter&#x27;s University as of July 1, 2024.

In 2008, Saint Peter&#x27;s was awarded a $2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to create the Center for Microplasma Science and Technology. This grant allowed the college to expand upon its 20 years of studying microplasma as part of its research on water purifiers in conjunction with United Water. Saint Peter&#x27;s graduates U.S. Senator Robert Menendez and U.S. Representative Albio Sires helped secure the $2 million grant.

On the day after his narrow defeat in the 2008 New Hampshire Presidential primary election, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama held a rally at the college&#x27;s Yanitelli Center.

In March 2011, it was announced that the college would take over Saint Aeden&#x27;s Church at McGinley Square from the Archdiocese of Newark.


In March 2012, the college was granted the university designation by the New Jersey State Secretary for Higher Education and would thus change its name. On August 14, 2012, Saint Peter&#x27;s announced the official change on its website, becoming Saint Peter&#x27;s University.

In 2013, the new Mac Mahon Student Center was completed. It houses offices for many of Saint Peter&#x27;s administrative branches, as well as numerous student led organizations such as the Student Government Association.

In 2014, the university opened a center for undocumented students, providing them a safe space and mentoring, a resource library, legal support, and advice for them and their families about deportation defense and immigration issues.

In 2019, the university named its business school for former congressman, lawyer, and businessman Frank J. Guarini who had gifted the university $10 million.

In 2021, the university opened and dedicated the renovated Yanitelli Center, now named Run Baby Run Arena, with a victory over fellow Jersey City school, New Jersey City University, 90–66 in an exhibition game. The renovation was secured through a $5 million lead gift from alumni and former basketball player Thomas P. Mac Mahon. Mac Mahon, a 1968 graduate of Saint Peter&#x27;s, and a member of the Saint Peter&#x27;s University Board of Trustees, decided to honor his former 1967–68 teammates by naming the renovated space the &quot;Run Baby Run Arena&quot; after that team&#x27;s nickname for its high-scoring offense.

The following year, the university opened a new six-story residence hall named Panepinto Hall in honor of alumnus Joseph A. Panepinto on the university&#x27;s East Campus. In the fall of 2018, Panepinto made a $10 million gift to Saint Peter&#x27;s, which at the time was the largest single gift in the university&#x27;s history.

Saint Peter&#x27;s has won the MAAC men&#x27;s basketball championship and the accompanying automatic bid to the NCAA tournament five times (1991, 1995, 2011, 2022, and 2024). They have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 12 times (1957, 1958, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1975, 1976, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1987, and 1989). The women&#x27;s basketball team has won seven MAAC championships and automatic bids to the NCAA tournament (1982, 1992, 1993, 1997, 1999, 2000, and 2002); it also won the MAAC championship in 1983 and 1984, years when the MAAC champion did not receive an automatic NCAA tournament berth. In 2017, Saint Peter&#x27;s won the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT) championship by defeating Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi in the tournament final. It was Saint Peter&#x27;s first national title in school history. In 2022, the men&#x27;s basketball team earned national recognition after receiving a No. 15 seed in the NCAA tournament and upsetting the No. 2 seed Kentucky Wildcats; it was only the tenth occurrence of a No. 15 seed defeating a No. 2 seed in NCAA Tournament history. They then defeated the No. 7 seed Murray State Racers, becoming just the third No. 15 seed to reach the Sweet 16. After this they upset the No. 3 seed Purdue Boilermakers to become the first No. 15 seed to reach the Elite 8.

In 2004 and 2005, Keydren &quot;Kee-Kee&quot; Clark led the nation in points scored per game, becoming just the eighth player to repeat as NCAA Division I scoring champion. On March 4, 2006, Clark became only the seventh NCAA player to score more than 3,000 points in his career; on the next day, he passed Hersey Hawkins to become the sixth-leading scorer of all time. At the time of his final game on March 6, 2006, Clark held the NCAA all-time record for 3-point shots, with 435. A second fourth-year student and a forward on the basketball team, George Jefferson, died on June 21, 2005, due to a previously undiagnosed heart condition. In 2011, Saint Peter&#x27;s won the MAAC tournament to make the Peacocks&#x27; first March Madness appearance since 1995.

The Peacocks were the MAAC Women&#x27;s Indoor Track and Field Champions in 2011, 2012, and 2013. They were Outdoor champions in 2011 and 2012.

==Peacock mascot==
Saint Peter&#x27;s University is the only NCAA Division I institution whose mascot is the peacock. This choice was made for several reasons. Primarily, the land on which Saint Peter&#x27;s now stands was once owned by a man named Michiel Reyniersz Pauw, whose last name means &quot;peacock&quot; in Dutch. His extensive holdings included most of Hudson County and were part of the Pavonia, New Netherland settlement.

In pagan mythology, the peacock is considered to be a symbol of rebirth, much like the phoenix. For Saint Peter&#x27;s, it is a reference to the closing and reopening of the college in the early 20th century.

At one point in the 1960s, live peacocks roamed the campus. Many institutions within the college derive their name from the peacock:
* The school newspaper had been titled the &quot;Pauw Wow&quot; until April 2021, when it was renamed as the &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s Tribune&quot;; Pauw&#x27;s name was removed because of his involvement in &quot;cruelty and oppression against Indigenous and African peoples&quot;.
* The literary magazine is titled the &quot;Pavan&quot;.
* The school&#x27;s yearbook is titled the &quot;Peacock Pie&quot;.
* The drama society calls itself &quot;Argus Eyes&quot;, in reference to Argus &quot;Panoptes&quot;, who, according to Greek mythology, had his 100 eyes preserved by Hera in the tail of the peacock.
* One of the major dining facilities is named the Pavonia Room.
* The O&#x27;Toole Library café is named Pavo Perk.

<doc id="295277" wikidata="Q35961" url="?curid=295277" title="Katharevousa">
<text>Katharevousa (, , literally &quot;purifying [language]&quot;) is a conservative form of the Modern Greek language conceived in the late 18th century as both a literary language and a compromise between Ancient Greek and the contemporary vernacular, Demotic Greek. Originally, it was widely used for both literary and official purposes, though sparingly in daily language. In the 20th century, it was increasingly adopted for official and formal purposes, until minister of education Georgios Rallis made Demotic Greek the official language of Greece in 1976, and in 1982 Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou abolished the polytonic system of writing for both Demotic and Katharevousa.

Katharevousa was conceived by the intellectual and revolutionary leader Adamantios Korais (1748–1833). A graduate of the University of Montpellier, Korais spent most of his life as an expatriate in Paris. As a classical scholar credited with both laying the foundations of Modern Greek literature and a major figure in the Greek Enlightenment, he was repelled by the Byzantine and subsequent influence on Greek society, and was a fierce critic of the clergy and their alleged subservience to the Ottoman Empire. He held that education was a prerequisite to Greek liberation.

Part of Katharevousa&#x27;s purpose was to serve as a compromise solution for the struggle between the &quot;archaists&quot; demanding full reversion to archaic Greek, and the &quot;modernists&quot;.

==History==

Although Katharevousa was introduced relatively recently, the concept of a conservative literary version of Greek had been present since the times of Koine Greek. There had always existed a tendency towards a state of diglossia between the Attic literary language and the constantly developing spoken Koine, which eventually evolved into Demotic Greek. Medieval Greek texts and documents of the Byzantine Empire were almost always written in conservative literary Greek. Examples of texts written in vernacular Greek prior to the 13th century are very rare. It can be argued that the establishment of Katharevousa was an official declaration and standardization of the conservative form of Greek, which had already existed in one way or another. The first known use of the term &quot;Katharevousa&quot; is in a work by the Greek polymath Nikephoros Theotokis, in 1796.

Katharevousa was widely used in public documents and whatever was conceived as work of formal activity by Greek scholars. The name &quot;Katharevousa&quot; implies a pure form of Greek as it might hypothetically have evolved from ancient Greek without external influences, while in its modern connotation the word has come to mean &quot;formal language&quot;. In later years, Katharevousa was used for official and formal purposes (such as politics, letters, official documents, and newscasting), while Demotic Greek (, ), or popular Greek, was the daily language. This created a diglossic situation whereby most of the Greek population was excluded from the public sphere and advancement in education unless they conformed to Katharevousa. 

In 1976, Demotic was made the official language, and in 1982 Andreas Papandreou abolished the polytonic system of writing; by the end of the 20th century full Katharevousa in its earlier form had become obsolete. Much of the vocabulary of Katharevousa and its grammatical and syntactical rules have influenced the Demotic language, so that the project&#x27;s emphasis has made an observable contribution to the language as it is used today. Modern Greek might be argued to be a combination of the original Demotic and the traditional Katharevousa as stressed in the 19th century, also with institutional input from Koine Greek. Among Katharevousa&#x27;s later contributions are the promotion of classically based compounds to describe items and concepts that did not exist in earlier times, such as &quot;newspaper&quot;, &quot;police&quot;, &quot;automobile&quot;, &quot;aeroplane&quot; and &quot;television&quot;, rather than borrowing new words directly from other languages.

== Etymology ==
Katharevousa () means &#x27;cleansing, purifying&#x27;, the feminine present participle of the verb (, ). (The term is thus cognate with English &quot;catharsis&quot;.)

==Present-day use==
The Church of Greece and other churches of the Greek Orthodox tradition still use Katharevousa in official communications.

==Text sample==
This is a text sample of Katharevousa from the &quot;Great Greek Encyclopedia&quot;, published in 1930. The text relates to Adamantios Korais&#x27;s relations with the Greek Church. It is rendered in Demotic and translated into English.
*English translation: His expatriation from Greece was a cause for many unjust judgments as regards situations and people, and mainly for his behaviour towards the clergy, which was discussed above. If he had lived in Greece and been in contact with the clergy and known closely not only its turpitude but also its virtues, not only would he have contributed greatly to correcting some of the problems within the Church, but also would not have listened to all that he listened to due to his exaggerated sentiments against the clergy.

==Campus==
Thomas Edison State University moved into downtown Trenton in September 1979, at a time when other institutions were leaving cities. The 7-year-old university, which had spent three years at the Forrestal Center outside of Princeton, needed room for growth. At the same time, the state was looking for an appropriate tenant for the landmark Kelsey Building located adjacent to New Jersey&#x27;s State House complex and the State House historic district, while the city sought to preserve the building&#x27;s historic use as a school. Behind the Kelsey Building and the adjoining five restored mid-19th-century brick Townhouses is Petty&#x27;s Run, which flows to the Delaware River. In the early 1730s, Petty&#x27;s Run powered a plating mill, and by midcentury drove a steel furnace.
Built in 1911 by A. Henry Cooper Kelsey, the Kelsey Building is one of the architectural landmarks of the city. It housed three other schools before serving as the headquarters for Thomas Edison State University. The architecture of the Kelsey Building is modeled after a Florentine palace, the Palazzo Strozzi. The main structure was designed in 1910 by world-renowned architect Cass Gilbert (designer of New York City&#x27;s Woolworth Building). In 2011, the Kelsey Building celebrated its 100th anniversary.

The university&#x27;s campus has grown over the years and currently includes the Kelsey Building, the Townhouse Complex, the Center for Learning and Technology, and Kuser Mansion, all on West State Street. The Academic Center and Canal Banks Building are located on West Hanover Street.

Thomas Edison State University has been active in restoring several historic buildings of downtown Trenton, preserving the essence of the city&#x27;s past and stimulating economic development. In 2013, TESU announced the completion of a new nursing simulation lab (funded by Bristol Myers Squibb). In 2016, the university celebrated the opening of the 34,360-square-foot Nursing Education Center at the site of the former Glen Cairn Arms apartment complex at West State and Calhoun streets.

==Artwork on campus==
TESU houses a number of pieces of art including a N. C. Wyeth painting titled &quot;Reception to Washington on April 21, 1789, at Trenton on his way to New York to Assume the Duties of the Presidency of the United States&quot;, the Quantum Ring sculpture, a bronze map of Trenton, and plaques in tribute to Thomas Edison, along with two collections.
Inside the Kelsey Building, a lavishly decorated room was built as a special tribute to Prudence Townsend Kelsey. The Prudence Townsend Kelsey Memorial Room is a permanent exhibit space for the porcelain and art she and her husband, Henry Cooper Kelsey, collected on their annual trips to Europe.&quot; Paintings, porcelains and bronzes on display in the Memorial Room. The majority of the collections consists of souvenirs and mementos purchased by the Kelsey&#x27;s on their annual trips abroad. Some of the items housed in the room include an asparagus shaped porcelain vial, a jewel Demitasse cup and saucer by Coalport, charms, vases and several pieces of porcelain and crystal from Austria, England, Germany, France and Ireland.

The Bradshaw Collection by George A. Bradshaw is displayed in the Kelsey Building&#x27;s Prudence Hall. The university often hosts tours of these collections which are also viewable by appointment. In addition to being displayed at Thomas Edison State University, Bradshaw&#x27;s etchings are in the permanent collections of the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, the Vanderpoel Gallery in Chicago, Newark Museum, the University of Nebraska and many private collections.

In 2019, Wells Fargo donated the painting by Wyeth portraying George Washington&#x27;s reception at Trenton to TESU, the largest gift ever given to the university.

<text>Igor Sergeyevich Gouzenko (; January 26, 1919 – June 25, 1982) was a cipher clerk for the Soviet embassy to Canada in Ottawa, Ontario, and a lieutenant of the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). He defected on September 5, 1945, three days after the end of World War II, with 109 documents on the USSR&#x27;s espionage activities in the West. In response, Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister, Mackenzie King, called a royal commission to investigate espionage in Canada.

Gouzenko exposed Soviet intelligence&#x27;s efforts to steal nuclear secrets as well as the technique of planting sleeper agents. The &quot;Gouzenko Affair&quot; is often credited as a triggering event of the Cold War, with historian Jack Granatstein stating it was &quot;the beginning of the Cold War for public opinion&quot; and journalist Robert Fulford writing he was &quot;absolutely certain the Cold War began in Ottawa&quot;. Granville Hicks described Gouzenko&#x27;s actions as having &quot;awakened the people of North America to the magnitude and the danger of Soviet espionage&quot;.

== Background ==

Gouzenko was born on January 26, 1919, in the village of Rogachev near Dmitrov, Moscow Governorate (now Moscow Oblast), 100 kilometres north-west of Moscow. He was of Ukrainian heritage, the youngest of four children.

His older brother (also Igor, Gouzenko is named in memory of him), born in 1917, died at age 1 from malnutrition. His father fought in the Russian Civil War on the side of the Bolsheviks, dying early of typhoid. His mother was a school mathematics teacher. Faced with the prospect of her second child dying of starvation, Gouzenko&#x27;s mother decided to place him in the care of her mother, Ekaterina A. Filkova, in the village of Semion, Ryazan Oblast, Russia, where he lived for seven years. Later his mother took Igor to her relatives in Rostov-on-Don, and she got a job in the village of Verkhne-Spasskoe, after which she moved to Moscow, and after some time, she took all the children. Igor Gouzenko entered the fifth grade in the school named after Maxim Gorky near the Automotive Factory No. 2 Zavod Imeni Stalina.

Gouzenko spent a lot of time in the Lenin Library, where he prepared for admission to the university and then entered the Moscow Architectural Institute. While at the institute he met his future wife Svetlana (Anna) Gouseva in the Lenin Library; the couple married soon after meeting.

Due to his high academic performance, he was sent to the Military Engineering Academy named after V.V. Kuybyshev, where he was trained for a year as a cipher clerk, graduating with the rank of lieutenant. At the start of World War II he was drafted into the Red Army. He served in the central apparatus of the GRU (April, 1942 — summer of 1943). His position gave him knowledge of Soviet espionage activities in the West. Gouzenko worked under the leadership of Colonel Nikolai Zabotin.

== Defection ==
In June 1943 Gouzenko arrived in Ottawa, Canada, to work at the Soviet Embassy, his first overseas mission. In October, his pregnant wife joined him.

Gouzenko&#x27;s family was given the uncommon opportunity to live outside the embassy compound where most of the staff&#x27;s families lived. Gouzenko was allowed to live in an apartment in the city with Canadian families. In September 1944, Gouzenko learned that he and his family were being recalled to the Soviet Union. His supervisor, Zabotin, asked for a reprieve. Unwilling to return to the Soviet Union, due to being dissatisfied with the quality of life and the policies of the Soviet Union, he decided to defect. As an example of the freedoms Gouzenko recalls in his testimony, he mentions the elections in Canada in 1945, whereas in the USSR, according to him, there were no free elections and one had to choose from a single candidate. On September 5, 1945, three days after the end of World War II, the 26-year-old Gouzenko walked out of the embassy carrying a briefcase with Soviet code books and decryption materials, a total of 109 documents.

In a later statement, Gouzenko described how he first wanted to go to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) because he knew that there were no Soviet military agents there, but he was not sure that there were no NKVD agents. He then went to the &quot;Ottawa Journal&quot;, but when he reached the editor-in-chief, he hesitated to make a statement. When he returned later, the editor-in-chief was no longer at work, and the paper&#x27;s night editor did not venture to take responsibility, and suggested he go to the Department of Justice but nobody was on duty when he arrived there.

The next morning, September 6, he returned with his wife and child to the Department of Justice and asked to see the minister; after waiting several hours, he was denied an appointment. Then he returned to the newspaper and spoke with reporter Elizabeth Fraser, who advised him to contact the naturalization bureau. Later that day, Gouzenko applied for Canadian citizenship.

By noon that day, Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King was informed of the incident, which later led him to convene a Royal Commission to investigate espionage in Canada. Terrified that the Soviets had discovered his duplicity, Gouzenko went back to his apartment at 511 Somerset Street West and hid with his family in the apartment across the hall for the night. Shortly before midnight, four men from the Soviet Embassy (Pavlov, Rogov, Angelov and Farafontov) broke into an apartment on Somerset Street looking for Gouzenko and his documents. The Ottawa Police quickly arrived, followed by the RCMP and officials from the Canadian Department of External Affairs.

The following day, September 7, Gouzenko was able to find contacts in the RCMP who were willing to examine the documents he had removed from the Soviet embassy. Gouzenko was transported by the RCMP to the secret World War II &quot;Camp X&quot;, comfortably distant from Ottawa. While there, Gouzenko was interviewed by investigators from Britain&#x27;s internal security service, MI5 (rather than MI6, as Canada was within the British Commonwealth) and by investigators from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Although the RCMP expressed interest in Gouzenko, Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King initially wanted nothing to do with him. Even with Gouzenko in hiding and under RCMP protection, King reportedly pushed for a diplomatic solution to avoid upsetting the Soviet Union, still a wartime ally and ostensible friend. Documents reveal that King, then 70 and weary from six years of war leadership, was aghast when Norman Robertson, his undersecretary for external affairs, and his assistant, H.H. Wrong, informed him on the morning of September 6, 1945, that a &quot;terrible thing&quot; had happened. Gouzenko and his wife Svetlana, they told him, had appeared at the office of Justice Minister Louis St. Laurent with documents unmasking Soviet perfidy on Canadian soil. &quot;It was like a bomb on top of everything else&quot;, King wrote. King&#x27;s diaries assembled after his death were missing a single volume for November 10 to December 31, 1945, according to Library and Archives Canada.

Robertson told the Prime Minister that Gouzenko was threatening suicide, but King was adamant that his government not get involved, even if Gouzenko was apprehended by Soviet authorities. Robertson ignored King&#x27;s wishes and authorized the granting of asylum to Gouzenko and his family, on the basis that their lives were in danger.

== Ramifications of the defection ==
In February 1946, news spread that a network of Canadian spies under control of the Soviet Union had been passing classified information to the Soviet government. Much of the information taken then is public knowledge now, and the Canadian government was less concerned with the information stolen, but more of the potential of real secrets coming into the hands of future enemies.

Canada played an important part in the early research with nuclear bomb technology, being part of the wartime Manhattan Project along with the US and UK. That kind of vital information could be dangerous to Canadian interests in the hands of other nations.

According to Canadian Security Intelligence Service director Reid Morden, Gouzenko&#x27;s defection &quot;ushered in the modern era of Canadian security intelligence&quot;.

The evidence provided by Gouzenko led to the arrest of a number of suspects, including Agatha Chapman, whose apartment at 282 Somerset Street West was a favourite evening rendezvous. Among those convicted were Fred Rose, who was the only Communist Member of Parliament in the Canadian House of Commons; Sam Carr, the Communist Party&#x27;s national organizer; and scientist Raymond Boyer.

Chapman was later acquitted; the judge in her case announced that &quot;No case has been made out and, as far as this trial is concerned, the accused is dismissed.&quot;

A Royal Commission of Inquiry to investigate espionage, headed by Justices Robert Taschereau and Roy Kellock, was conducted into the Gouzenko Affair and his evidence of a Soviet spy ring in Canada. It also alerted other countries around the world, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, that Soviet agents had almost certainly infiltrated their nations as well.

Gouzenko provided many vital leads which assisted greatly with ongoing espionage investigations in Britain and North America. The documents he handed over exposed numerous Canadians who were spying for the Soviet Union. A clerk at External Affairs, a Canadian Army captain, and a radar engineer working at the National Research Council were arrested for espionage. A spy ring of up to 20 people passing information to the Soviets led by Fred Rose was also exposed. In the United Kingdom, British nuclear scientist Alan Nunn May was arrested in March 1946 after being implicated in Gouzenko&#x27;s documents. In the United States the FBI tracked down a Soviet spy, Ignacy Witczak, at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles.

Gouzenko&#x27;s mother died in the NKVD prison at Lubyanka under investigation. Gouzenko always assumed that his sister Irina, who worked as an architect, also died as a result of his defection. However, according to 1956 records, she married and lived in Chelyabinsk. His brother, Vsevolod, who Igor believed had been lost in the war, was also in this city. Svetlana Gouzenko&#x27;s father, mother, and sister each received five years in prison. The sister&#x27;s daughter, Tatiana, was sent to an orphanage.

== Life in Canada ==

Gouzenko and his family were given another identity by the Canadian government out of fear of Soviet reprisals. Gouzenko, as assigned by the Canadian government, lived the rest of his life under the assumed name of George Brown. Little is known about his life afterwards, but it is understood that he and his wife settled down to a middle-class existence in the Mississauga suburb of Port Credit. They raised eight children together. His children thought the language their parents spoke at home was Czech and supported Czechoslovakia in hockey games. They eventually learned the truth about their family&#x27;s history from their parents at the age of 16–18. 

Gouzenko was involved in a defamation case against &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; for a libellous article written about him. The case was heard by the Supreme Court of Canada.

He remained in the public eye, writing two books, &quot;This Was My Choice&quot;, a non-fiction account of his defection, and the novel &quot;The Fall of a Titan&quot;, which won a Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1954. In 1955 professor Eugene Hudson Long and writer Gerald Warner Brace nominated the novel for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Gouzenko also painted and sold paintings. Gouzenko also appeared on television to promote his books and air grievances with the RCMP, always with a hood over his head.

== Death ==
Gouzenko died of a heart attack in 1982 in Mississauga. Svetlana died in September 2001, and she was buried next to him. His grave was unmarked until 2002 when family members erected a headstone.
In 2002 federal Heritage Minister Sheila Copps designated &quot;The Gouzenko Affair (1945–46)&quot; an event of national historic significance. In June 2003, the city of Ottawa and in April 2004, the Canadian federal government put up memorial plaques in Dundonald Park commemorating the Soviet defector. It was from this park that Ottawa police and RCMP agents monitored Gouzenko&#x27;s apartment across Somerset Street the night men from the Soviet embassy came looking for Gouzenko. The story of the process of lobbying the two levels of government to unveil the historic plaques is told in the book &quot;Remembering Gouzenko: The Struggle to Honour a Cold War Hero&quot; by Andrew Kavchak (2019).

== Film==
The story of the Gouzenko Affair was made into the film &quot;The Iron Curtain&quot; in 1948, directed by William Wellman, with screenplay by Milton Krims, and starring Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney as Igor and Anna Gouzenko, produced by Twentieth Century Fox. The film&#x27;s release was accompanied by criticism from the USSR. On February 21, 1948, the propaganda newspaper &quot;Culture and Life&quot; published a critical article by Ilya Ehrenburg.

Another film version of the Gouzenko Affair was made as &quot;Operation Manhunt&quot; in 1954, directed by Jack Alexander, with screenplay by Paul Monash, and starring Harry Townes and Irja Jensen, released by United Artists.

== Theatre ==
Theatre Passe Muraille in Toronto produced &quot;Head in a Bag, a Cold War Comedy&quot; in December 1992. The play was written and directed by Baņuta Rubess, who also played Gouzenko. &quot;Rubess, effectively abetted by Oliver Dennis&#x27;s fumbling performance in the lead role, portrays Gouzenko as a hapless bungler who barely succeeds in rifling the telltale documents,&quot; &quot;Toronto Star&quot; theatre critic Vit Wagner wrote in a review of the production.

<text>Rilo Kiley, also known as The Initial Friend EP, is the first release by Los Angeles–based rock band Rilo Kiley. It was initially released independently in 1999 under the title &quot;Rilo Kiley&quot;. It was subsequently re-pressed in 2000 and again in 2001, under the name &quot;The Initial Friend EP&quot; with an alternate track-listing and cover. All three releases commonly sell on eBay for between $250–400 and are fairly rare.

The recording sessions for the EP were funded by comedian and actor Dave Foley, who was an early fan of the band and had attended their first concert in January 1998.

&quot;Frug,&quot; which references the 1960s dance of the same name, and &quot;85&quot; were included in the soundtrack to the Christina Ricci film &quot;Desert Blue&quot;, which led to the band&#x27;s heightened popularity and eventual signing to a record label. &quot;Frug&quot; was also the band&#x27;s first music video.

&quot;Frug&quot; was later included as the final song on the band&#x27;s B-sides and rarities compilation, &quot;Rkives&quot;.

The EP was reissued 2 October 2020 on the Little Record Company label on streaming services and originally due on vinyl as well. The vinyl was finally released 20 November 2020 because of production delays and was sold-out during pre-order before the release date.

<doc id="295286" wikidata="Q166172" url="?curid=295286" title="Dionysios Solomos">
<text>Dionysios Solomos (; ; 8 April 1798 – 9 February 1857) was a Greek poet from Zakynthos, who is considered to be Greece&#x27;s national poet. He is best known for writing the &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; (, &quot;Ýmnos eis tīn Eleutherían&quot;), which was set to music by Nikolaos Mantzaros and became the Greek and Cypriot national anthem in 1865 and 1966 respectively. He was the central figure of the Heptanese School of poetry. He is considered the national poet of Greece, not only because he wrote the national anthem, but also because he contributed to the preservation of earlier poetic tradition and highlighted its usefulness to modern literature. Other notable poems include &quot;Ὁ Κρητικός&quot; (&quot;The Cretan&quot;), &quot;Ἐλεύθεροι Πολιορκημένοι&quot; (&quot;The Free Besieged&quot;). A characteristic of his work is that no poem except the &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; was completed, and almost nothing was published during his lifetime.

 He lived in Corfu-Town between 1832–1857, his house you can see there from the outside.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Born in Zakynthos in 1798, Dionysios Solomos was the illegitimate child of a wealthy count, Nikolaos Solomos, and his housekeeper, Angeliki Nikli. Nikolaos Solomos was of Cretan origin; his family were Cretan refugees who settled on Zakynthos in 1670 after Crete&#x27;s conquest by the Ottoman Empire in 1669, and was connected with the Venetian patrician family of Salamon, who had settled on the island of Crete in the 15th century. It is possible that his mother Angeliki Nikli came from the region of Mani. The Italian version of the family name is recorded as: Salamon, Salomon, Solomon, and Salomone.

Count Nikolaos Solomos was legally married to Marnetta Kakni, who died in 1802. From that marriage, he had two children: Roberto and Elena. Since 1796, Nikolaos Solomos had a parallel relationship with his housekeeper Angeliki Nikli, who gave birth to one more son apart from Dionysios, Dimitrios (born in 1801). His brother Dimitros Solomos was in 1852 elected President of the United States of the Ionian Islands under the British Regime and was awarded the British Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. Count Dimitrios Solomos GCMG was married to Elena, daughter of Dr Demetrio Arvanitachi, the Senator of Zakynthos, who inspired his later work &quot;The Woman from Zakynthos.&quot;

His father married Dionysios&#x27; mother a day before he died on 27 February 1807, making the young Dionysios legitimate and a co-heir to the count&#x27;s estate, along with his half-brother. The poet spent his childhood years on Zakynthos until 1808, under the supervision of his Italian tutor, abbot Santo Rossi. After his father&#x27;s death, count Dionysios Messalas gained Solomos&#x27; custody, whereas his mother married Manolis Leontarakis on 15 August 1807. In 1808, Messalas sent Solomos to Italy in order to study law, as was customary with Ionian nobility, but possibly also because of Dionysios&#x27; mother&#x27;s new marriage.

===Studies in Italy===
Solomos went to Italy with his tutor, who returned to his home town, Cremona. Initially he was enrolled at the Lyceum of St. Catherine in Venice, but he had adjustment difficulties because of the school&#x27;s strict discipline. For that reason, Rossi took Solomos with him to Cremona, where he finished his high-school studies in 1815. In November 1815, Solomos was enrolled at Pavia University&#x27;s Faculty of Law, from which he graduated in 1817. Given the interest the young poet showed in the flourishing Italian literature and being a perfect speaker of Italian, he started writing poems in Italian. One of the most important first poems written in Italian during that period of time was the &quot;Ode per la prima messa&quot; (Ode to the first mass) and &quot;La distruzione di Gerusalemme&quot; (The destruction of Jerusalem). In the meantime, he acquainted himself with famous Italian poets and novelists (possibly Manzoni, Vincenzo Monti etc.); Ugo Foscolo from Zakynthos was among his friends. As a result, he was easily accepted in the Italian literary circles and evolved into a revered poet of the Italian language.

===Return to Zakynthos===
After 10 years of studies Solomos returned to Zakynthos in 1818 with a solid background in literature. On Zakynthos, which at that time was well known for its flourishing literary culture, the poet acquainted himself with people interested in literature. Antonios Matesis (the author of &quot;Vasilikos&quot;), Georgios Tertsetis, Dionysios Tagiapieras (a physician and supporter of the &quot;dimotiki&quot;, and also a friend of Ioannis Vilaras) and Nikolaos Lountzis were some of Solomos&#x27; most well-known friends. They used to gather in each other&#x27;s homes and amused themselves by making up poems. They frequently satirized a Zakynthian doctor, Roidis (Solomos&#x27; satirical poems referring to the doctor are &quot;The doctors&#x27; council&quot;, the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;The Gallows&quot;). They also liked to improvise poems on a given rhyme and topic.
His improvised Italian poems during that period of time were published in 1822, under the title &quot;Rime Improvvisate&quot;.

===First works in Greek and encounter with Spyridon Trikoupis===
Along with the Italian poems, Solomos made his first attempts to write in Greek. This was a difficult task for the young poet, since his education was classical and in Italian, but also because there did not exist any poetic works written in the demotic dialect that could have served as models. However, the fact that his education in Greek was minimal kept him free of any scholarly influences, that might have led him to write in katharevousa, a &quot;purist&quot; language formulated as a simpler form of ancient Greek. Instead he wrote in the language of the common people of his native island. In order to ameliorate his language skills, he started studying methodically demotic songs, the works of pre-solomian poets (προσολωμικοί ποιητές) and popular and Cretan literature that at that time constituted the best samples of the use of the demotic dialect in modern Greek literature.The result was the first extensive body of literature written in the demotic dialect, a move whose influence on subsequent writers cannot be overstated. Poems dating to that period of time are &quot;I Xanthoula&quot; — &quot;The little blond girl&quot;, &quot;I Agnoristi&quot; — &quot;The Unrecognizable&quot;, &quot;Ta dyo aderfia&quot; — &quot;The two brothers&quot; and &quot;I trelli mana&quot; — &quot;The mad mother&quot;.

Solomos&#x27; encounter with Spyridon Trikoupis in 1822 was a turning-point in his writing. When Trikoupis visited Zakynthos in 1822, invited by Lord Guilford, Solomos&#x27; fame on the island was already widespread and Trikoupis wished to meet him. During their second meeting, Solomos read to him the &quot;Ode to the first mass&quot;. Impressed by Solomos&#x27; poetic skills, Trikoupis stated:

Your poetic aptitude reserves for you a select place on the Italian Parnassus. But the first places there are already taken. The Greek Parnassus does not yet have its Dante.

Solomos explained to Trikoupis that his Greek was not fluent, and Trikoupis helped him in his studies of Christopoulos&#x27; poems.

===&quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; and the poet&#x27;s establishment===
The first important turning point in the Greek works of Solomos was the Hymn to Liberty that was completed in May 1823-a poem inspired by the Greek revolution 1821. The poem was at first published in 1824 in occupied Mesolongi and afterwards in Paris in 1825 translated into French and later on in other languages too. This resulted in the poet&#x27;s fame proliferation outside the Greek borders. Thanks to this poem, Solomos was revered until his death, since the rest of his work was only known to his small circle of admirers and his &quot;students&quot;. The Hymn to Liberty inaugurated a new phase in the poet&#x27;s literary work: this is the time when the poet has finally managed to master the language and is experimenting himself with more complex forms, opening up to new kinds of inspirations and easily leaving aside improvisation. This period resulted in the &quot;Odi eis to thanato tou Lordou Byron&quot; — &quot;Ode to the death of Lord Byron&quot;, a poem having many things in common with the Hymn but also many weaknesses, &quot;I Katastrofi ton Psaron&quot; — &quot;Psara&#x27;s Destruction&quot;, &quot;O Dialogos&quot; — &quot;The Dialogue&quot; (referring to the language) and &quot;I Gynaika tis Zakynthos&quot; — &quot;The Woman from Zakynthos&quot;.
It is alleged that Solomos could hear the cannon firing from Zakynthos during the Greek War of Independence, which inspired him to write his most famous works.

===Establishment on Corfu: first years===
After frictions and economic disputes with his brother Dimitrios concerning legacy matters, Solomos move to Corfu, the most important intellectual center of the Ionian islands in those years. However, Dionysios did not leave Zakynthos solely because of his family problems; Solomos had been planning to visit the island since 1825. Corfu would offer him not only a more stimulating environment but also the vital isolation for his solitary and bizarre character. Corfu was the perfect place for contemplation and writing poetry, in line with Solomos&#x27; noble ideas about Art. That explains the fact that his happiest years were the first years he spent on Corfu. It was during this period of time that he took up studying German romantic philosophy and poetry (Hegel, Schlegel, Schiller, Goethe). Since he did not know German, he read Italian translations by his friend Nikolaos Lountzis. In the meantime, he continued to work on &quot;The Woman of Zakynthos&quot; and &quot;Lambros&quot; that he had started in 1826. The &quot;Woman of Zakynthos&quot; was said to be inspired by the infidelities of his sister-in-law Elena Arvanitachi, the daughter of Dr Demetrio Arvanitachi, the Senator of Zante.

===1833: trial and great works of maturity===
Between 1833 and 1838, having restored the relations with his brother, Solomos&#x27; life was perturbed by a series of trials where his half-brother (from his mother&#x27;s side) Ioannis Leontarakis was claiming part of their father&#x27;s legacy, arguing that he was also the legal child of count Nikolaos Solomos, since his mother was pregnant before the father&#x27;s death. Even though the outcome of the trial was favorable to both the poet and his brother, the dispute led to Solomos&#x27; alienation from his mother (his feelings were badly hurt because of his adoration towards his mother) and his withdrawal from publicity.

Even though the trial influenced the poet to such a point, it was not able to seize his poetical work. 1833 signifies the mature period of his poetical work, that resulted in the unfinished poems of &quot;O Kritikos&quot; — &quot;The Cretan&quot; (1833), &quot;Eleftheroi Poliorkimenoi&quot; — &quot;The Free Besieged&quot; (until 1845) and &quot;O Porfyras&quot;(1847), that are considered to be the best of his works. In the meantime, he was planning other works that either remained at the preparation stage or remained as fragments, such as &quot;Nikoforos Vryennios&quot;, &quot;Eis to thanato Aimilias Rodostamo&quot; — &quot;To the death of Emilia Rodostamo&quot;, &quot;To Francisca Fraser&quot; and &quot;Carmen Seculare&quot;.

===Circle of Corfu===
On Corfu, Solomos soon found himself at the admirers&#x27; and poets&#x27; center of attention, a group of well educated intellectuals with liberal and progressive ideas, a deep knowledge of art and with austere artistic pretensions. The most important people Solomos was acquainted to were Nikolaos Mantzaros, Ioannis and Spyridon Zampelios, Ermannos Lountzis, Niccolò Tommaseo, Andreas Mustoxydis, Petros Vrailas Armenis, Iakovos Polylas, Ioulios Typaldos, Andreas Laskaratos and Gerasimos Markoras.
Polylas, Typaldos and Markoras were Solomos&#x27; students, constituting the circle referred to as the &quot;solomian poets&quot; (σολωμικοί ποιητές), which signifies Greek&#x27;s poetry flourishing, several decades before the appearance of the New Athenian School, a second poetical renaissance inspired by Kostis Palamas.

===Last years===
After 1847, Solomos started writing in Italian once more. Most works from this period are half-finished poems and prose drafts that maybe the poet was planning to translate into Greek. Serious health problems made their appearance in 1851 and Solomos&#x27; character became even more temperamental. He alienated himself from friends such as Polylas (they came on terms with each other in 1854) and after his third stroke the poet did not leave his house. Solomos died in February 1857 from apoplexy. His fame had reached such heights so when the news about his death became known, everyone mourned. Corfu&#x27;s theater closed down, the Ionian Parliament&#x27;s sessions were suspended and mourning was declared. His remains were transferred to Zakynthos in 1865.

==Work==

===Literary influences and major works===

Solomos&#x27; first poems written on Zakynthos were influenced by Italian poetry of that era, in line with the Academy of Arcadia movement (e.g. &quot;O thanatos tou voskou&quot;-&quot;The shepherd&#x27;s death&quot;, &quot;Evrikomi&quot;) and by early romanticism (&quot;I trelli mana&quot;-&quot;The mad mother&quot;). Generally speaking, Solomos was heavily influenced by European romanticism, including Byron and Leopardi. The decade 1823–1833 determined the poet&#x27;s progress. It was during that time he tried to give up improvisation and abandoned the new classicism style of poems such as &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; and &quot;Ode to the death of Lord Byron&quot;.

Solomos was exposed to the cultural and political ferment of the Enlightenment and the ideas of the French Revolution, and he identified with Italian national sentiments for unification and liberation from the Habsburgs.

In 1823, the poet writes the epic &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot;, the first two stanzas of which became the Greek national anthem. This work salutes the War of Greek Independence, started in 1821, by invoking the personified image of Liberty, reborn and renewed out of &quot;the sacred bones of the Greeks.&quot; Of particular interest to non-Greeks are references to all the great powers of the time, which include the &quot;heartfelt joy of Washington&#x27;s land&quot; that &quot;remembered the irons that bound her as well&quot;, and a savage dig at the Austrian Eagle &quot;that feeds on the entrails of the Italians to grow wings and talons&quot; and does his best to harm Liberty. Solomos&#x27; own Ionian islands, under British rule at the time, are described as being &quot;artfully chained&quot; and having &quot;&#x27;False Freedom&#x27; written on their foreheads.&quot; The poem does not shrink from the savagery of the war, and ends with exhortations to the revolutionaries to maintain unity and avoid civil war, which had already erupted at the time of writing.
In the &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; Solomos rejoices in the sight of &quot;lily-fingered virgins&quot; whose &quot;breasts are preparing the sweet-suckled milk of bravery and freedom.&quot;

In 1824, Solomos composed &quot;The Dialogue&quot;, dealing with the language issue. The work involves three people: the poet, his friend (the first draft mentions Sp. Trikoupis) and the savant. However, it is mainly the poet and the savant who speak. The poet is trying to prove that katharevousa is an artificial language, of no use to either the people nor to literature. The poet supports a literary language based on the language spoken by the people, that should be elaborated on by the poet. In order to support his argument, the following phrase is used: &quot;firstly succumb to the language of the people and then, if you are worthy, conquer it&quot;. His arguments are based on the French Age of Enlightenment on the subject of the use of national languages and on examples of Italian poetry, by which he tries to prove that no word is vulgar in itself but gets its meaning by the poem&#x27;s context. At the end of the work, the poet abandons the rational reasoning and supports his arguments with passion.

Between 1824 and 1826, the poet started working on the poem &quot;Lampros&quot;, a poem that remained unfinished. Lampros is an extreme romantic hero: he entered into a relationship with a young girl named Maria and they had four children without being married. Lampros sen t their children to an orphanage. While he was fighting against Ali Pasha, he met a girl, unaware of the fact that she was his daughter, and had a love affair with her. When he finally became aware of the incest, after recognizing the daughter&#x27;s birthmarks, he told his daughter the truth that resulted in the daughter&#x27;s suicide. On his way home, Lampros was forced to tell Maria about his crime and he fled to a church in order to appeace his soul. Divine Justice however sent the three boys&#x27; ghosts that chased him to the end of a cliff from which he fell of. Maria had already lost her reason and fell into a lake, hoping that she would at last find peace.

Between 1826 and 1829, Solomos worked on the prose-like poem &quot;I Gynaika tis Zakynthos&quot;, a work of a satirical character, that mainly analyses the Evil. The poem is a monk&#x27;s (Dionysios) narration and &quot;I Gynaika&quot;-&quot;The Woman&quot; is the Evil&#x27;s main expression. It is said that this composition was about one of Solomos&#x27; relatives and that is the reason why the poet&#x27;s brother never let Polylas publish the poem.

In 1833, Solomos wrote his first important work during his maturity, &quot;O Kritikos&quot; (&quot;The Cretan&quot;), in iambic fifteen-syllable verse, as a result of the Cretan&#x27;s literature influence. The work describes the story of a Cretan who left from Crete after the revolution was lost in 1826, the shipwreck and his efforts to save his beloved from the tempest. A central point in the work is the apparition of an oracle, the &quot;Feggarontymeni&quot; (meaning the one dressed by the moon). The narrator of the story is the Cretan himself: he starts telling his story many years later, when he is living alone as a beggar, doing flashbacks (from his life on Crete and the shipwreck) and talking about the future (the resurrection of the dead and his encounter with his beloved one in Paradise). &quot;O Kritikos&quot; is aesthetically the most complete poem. There is juxtaposition of storm imagery and the pursuit by the Turks. The problem troubling language specialists is the interpretation of the &quot;Feggarontymeni&#x27;s&quot; figure. Some think the figure is an allusion to the Virgin Mary. She is described as the &#x27;goddess&#x27; and reads in his heart the story of his heroic and ultimately futile struggles against the Turks in his native island which all but charms him out of his mortal body. David Ricks writes with respect to her identity, &quot;we must hold in balance the soul of the expiring fiancée, the kindly presence of the Motherland and a recollection of our Lady&quot;.

Between 1833 and 1844, Solomos edited the second draft of &quot;The Free Besieged&quot;, a poem inspired by the Third Siege of Missolonghi and the heroic exodus of its inhabitants, written in a rhyming fifteen-syllable verse. After 1845, the poet started working on the poem once more, this time without using rhyme. The poem describes the last days of the siege, when food supplies were exhausted and it was certain that the city would fall. The notes written by the poet in Italian are very useful for the poem&#x27;s interpretation. These notes are included in the Polylas edition. The central theme of the poem is willpower and the struggle with the temptations of nature that give birth to the will for life. There are three fragmentary drafts of this unfinished work, each draft longer and more thoroughly worked than the previous one, all of which show glimpses of what the finished poem could have been; yet the three drafts are considered possibly the finest moment of modern Greek poetry. This opinion of reverence and awe is not only one expressed by critics and scholars, but also by all major Greek poets who have invariably referred to Dionysios Solomos as a poet far superior than themselves.

The last work of maturity is &quot;O Pórfyras&quot; (The Shark), written in 1847. The poet was inspired by a real incident, when a shark mangled an English soldier swimming in Corfu harbor. &quot;Porfyras&quot; is a difficult poem to interpret, mostly because of its fragmented nature. This poem also refers to the relation between nature and man and the body&#x27;s and soul&#x27;s dimension.

The fragmented poems &quot;Lampros&quot; and &quot;Porfyras&quot; show the romantic impulse of Solomos (melancholy, gothic and supernatural, influenced by both Byron and Leopardi).

The poem &quot;Ode to the death of Lord Byron,&quot; is labeled lyrical and was written after Byron died during the siege of Mesolongi, but the subject matter and form are epic.

In the works of &quot;The Hymn to Liberty&quot; and &quot;Ode to the death of Lord Byron&quot; there are several direct and indirect references to Byron&#x27;s works. A good example is a reference (in Solomos&#x27; own footnotes) to Byron&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;, where in Canto the Third (The Greek Isles 15) a Greek poet says:

Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
Our virgins dance beneath the shade
I see their glorious black eyes shine;
But gazing on each glowing maid,
My own the burning tear-drop laves,
To think such breasts must suckle slaves.

===Minor works===
Solomos also wrote translations of Italian poetry and Desdemona&#x27;s song from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, epigrams, other miscellaneous verse, satirical poems in Zakynthian dialect, and two prose works, including the tragic/mystical &quot;The Woman of Zakynthos&quot;. Of his attempts to translate parts of the Iliad into modern Greek only a couple of dozen lines remain.

===Acceptance of his work===
Since the beginning, Solomos was in the center of the literary circles of Zakynthos. After the &quot;Hymn to Liberty&#x27;s&quot; publication, his fame spread throughout the Greek state. On the Ionian Islands and in Athens, the poet was known only by his published poems: the &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot;, the abstract from &quot;Maria&#x27;s prayer&quot;, &quot;Lampros&quot;, the &quot;Ode to the Nun&quot; and his poems written in his youth, many of them which were spread by word of mouth and many of them were set to music. This means that his contemporaries&#x27; opinion was formed by these works and it was thanks to these works that Solomos gained the fame that lasted until his death. The most important representatives of the First Athenian School admired Solomos&#x27; works even though they expressed their objections about the language used by the poet. In 1827, Iakovos Rizos Neroulos wrote in the &quot;Cours de la littérature grecque moderne&quot;: &quot;Dionysios Solomos&#x27; poems... have the value of a strong and fascinating inspiration, a fantasy full of courage and fertility&quot;. Alexandros Soutsos in the poem &quot;Letter to King Otto&quot; described Solomos (and Andreas Kalvos) as &quot;a great maker of odes&quot; who, however, neglected the beauties of the language and presented rich ideas &quot;poorly clad&quot;. Alexandros Rizos Ragkavis in &quot;Esquisses de la littérature grecque moderne&quot; wrote: &quot;his spirit makes him one of Greece&#x27;s greatest glories... Solomos shone like the most beautiful gem of Greece&#x27;s poetical crown&quot;. Even before his death, Solomos&#x27; poetical work was identified with the fatherland&#x27;s concept; in 1849, the newspaper &quot;Aion&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;the poetry of Solomos is not the poetry of a single person but the poetry of a whole nation&quot;. Similar judgements were expressed even after the poet&#x27;s death. The magazine &quot;Pandora&quot; wrote: &quot;one of the finest poets of Greece and of Europe, the author of the dithyramb to Liberty, Dionysios Solomos from Zakynthos died at a thriving age&quot;. The funeral orations of Solomos&#x27; students were of course more essential and referred to the poet&#x27;s unpublished works, many of which they had heard their teacher reciting. Ioulios Typaldos described Solomos as the &quot;first and greatest founder of a new type of literature&quot;&quot; and Iakovos Polylas in Solomos&#x27; poems &quot;Prolegomena&quot; in 1859 refers to him as &quot;the national poet&quot;.

The perception of Solomos&#x27; work changed radically after the long-awaited publication in 1859. His uncompleted work was an unpleasant surprise and created puzzlement to the newspapers which praised the greatest Greek poet after his death did not mention anything about the publication of the works. Valaoritis wrote to Constantinos Asopius in 1859 after the poet&#x27;s death: &quot;the nation&#x27;s hopes were deceived&quot; and in 1877 in a letter to Emmanouil Roidis he wrote that Solomos left us &quot;only a hymn and some incoherent verses&quot;. Spyridon Trikoupis also expressed negative comments about Solomos&#x27; poems in his essay &quot;Where does the common word &quot;tragoudo&quot; (i.e. &quot;I am singing&quot;) derive from?&quot; written in 1859.

The first revaluation of Solomos&#x27; work outside the Ionian region started after 1880, especially after the critical work of Kostis Palamas, who acknowledged the historical importance of Solomos&#x27; work, which is characterized by the creation of a personal poetic language and the combination of all elements of the poetical tradition and the European poetical currents and ideas.

===Formal elements===
The poet used different metrical and rhyme forms, starting with some influenced by Italian poetry (sonnet form, rhymed trochaic tetrameters) and settling into the standard forms of Greek folk songs (iambic 15-syllable blank verse). His epigram on the destruction of Psara, an event of the Greek War of Independence, influenced by classical forms, is a marvel of rhythm and brevity in six lines of anapaest.

===The fragmented nature of Solomos&#x27; works===
One of the most important issues of Solomic poetry and of Greek literature in general is the fragmented nature of the poet&#x27;s works. The only works published during Solomos&#x27; lifetime were the &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot; (1825), an extract from &quot;Lampros&quot; (&quot;Maria&#x27;s prayer&quot;) (1834), the &quot;Ode to the Nun&quot; (1829) and the epigram &quot;To Francisca Fraser&quot; (1849). The rest of his works remained incomplete. Solomos was constantly editing his works and was striving towards total perfection of form, making efforts to get rid of anything excessive that destroyed their essential lyrical substance. His manuscripts do not comprise engrossed works; on the contrary, they reveal all stages of editing, without their latest version being the final one. At first, the poet conceptualized a draft of the poem written in Italian prose and after that he used to start editing the Greek version. Many of the verses are saved in the form of alternative versions, often in the wrong order, some incomplete and with many gaps. The poet often used to write verses of different poems on the same piece of paper. The poem &#x27;The Cretan&#x27; (1833), written about the Cretan revolution was one of his most famous poems. It is highly fragmented, however, this adds to the tormented atmosphere of the dramatic monologue because the speaker is a beggar whose life has been torn apart and who is in emotional turmoil, his entire family killed by the Turks.

A faithful student of Solomos, Iakovos Polylas, affronted many difficulties when he undertook the publication of his &quot;teacher&#x27;s&quot; work (that was long-awaited, not only in the Ionian Islands but also the rest of Greece). First of all, Polylas had to ask permission from the poet&#x27;s brother Dimitrios in order to be able to study the poet&#x27;s manuscripts. After that, he had to arrange the scattered material (written in the poet&#x27;s difficult to decipher handwriting) so as to present an as much as possible complete and coherent work. Polylas piled and arranged this material, choosing the verses that he thought were closest in meaning to what the poet had in mind. Sometimes Polylas added verses that he had heard Solomos recite and wrote down some alternative versions. In 1859, Polylas published the work of Solomos under the title &quot;&quot;Apanta ta Evriskomena&quot;- &quot;Omnibus of the works found&quot;&quot;, accompanying this work with an exceptional introduction, in which he stated that the poet&#x27;s manuscripts with their definitive form were lost.

===Attempt to interpret the fragmented works===
The form of Solomos&#x27; work as presented in its first edition was the source of disappointment, because at that time the work&#x27;s value could not be appreciated. Polylas in his &quot;Prolegomena&quot; stressed that the major manuscripts of the poems&#x27; final version were either lost or destroyed. People assumed that the works may have been stolen by Solomos&#x27; servant or by the poet&#x27;s brother Dimitrios or even that the poet himself destroyed them. Only in the beginning of the 20th century was it made clear that no more manuscripts existed and that Solomos had not completed his poems. The first attempts to interpret the fragmented nature of the poet&#x27;s work were mostly based on theories having nothing to do with the texts themselves: the difficulty to complete the works was thought to be due to the lack of an appropriate intellectual atmosphere that would provide Solomos with the motivation to complete his works, or due to the lack of an adequate literary tradition that the poet could have followed. The fragmentation of Solomos&#x27; work was also attributed to psychological factors, such as the poet&#x27;s alcoholism, the lack of compositive capability, the negative effects of the 1833–1838 trial, Solomos&#x27; perfectionism or his feeling of dissatisfaction.

Other scholars underlined however that, to a great extent, Solomos did not care about the completion of his poems. A phrase attributed to the poet is illustrative: &quot;Lampros will remain an abstract, because the whole poem does not reach the height of some days&quot;. Linos Politis notes on the fragmentary nature of the &quot;Free Besieged&quot;: &quot;He did not want or did not care to incorporate these lyrical pieces into a narrative group ... He stuck to the pure, lyrical expression, without regard to the non-lyrical linking substance, thus advancing ... to the conquest of a &#x27;pure&#x27; lyrical sphere, long before his time. We detected something similar in &quot;Kritikos&quot; too and the same thing is applied to the rest of his &#x27;fragmented&#x27; works&quot;. Later on, Solomos was considered by several poets and critics as the forerunner of &quot;pure poetry&quot; and the fragmented nature of his work did not &quot;disturb&quot; any more; on the contrary, it was considered as an advantage.

During the last decade, attempts have been made to associate the incomplete Solomian works with the fragmentary works of romantic literature (such as &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; by Coleridge, &quot;Giaour&quot; by Lord Byron and &quot;Heinrich von Oftendingen&quot; by Novalis), even though this interpretation is not accepted by all scholars.

===Publication issue===
From 1920 to 1930, an issue arose concerning the publication of works that were not included in Iakovos Polylas&#x27; edition such as &quot;The Woman of Zakynthos&quot;, the satirical &quot;The Gallows&quot; and several Italian sonnets that were published by K. Kairofylas in 1927. The Academy of Athens decided to publish Solomos&#x27; poems accompanied by a critical edition by N.B. Tomadakis, thus contributing to the discussion about whether a genuine (as Linos Politis was in favor of) or a critical edition of Solomos&#x27; works would be best. The critical edition was never published and the two classical scholars prepared &quot;easy to use&quot; editions of the poems, aiming at a wider range of readers. In 1964, Linos Politis published the poet&#x27;s manuscripts using photographic reprint and typographical transcription. This edition constitutes a turn-point in the research on the Solomian works because not only was the poet&#x27;s way of work revealed but also because the scholars had the opportunity to study all of the poet&#x27;s editing phases and maybe even propose new editions.

The contemporary editing attempts of the solomic work can be divided into two categories: the &quot;analytical&quot; edition which reveals the successive editing stages of every poem and its different versions, such as Politis had proposed and intended to realize; the &quot;synthetical&quot; edition which presents the work with a logical sequence and a completion of form, excluding verses or abstracts that do no fulfill these criteria. A sample of &quot;synthetical&quot; edition is the one of Stylianos Alexiou (1994), that was strongly criticized by the supporters of &quot;analytical&quot; approach.

== Surviving works at his death ==
The poet&#x27;s work at his death was mostly unfinished and in fragments, and was edited and published by his friend and fellow poet Iakovos Polylas. Whether Solomos was never satisfied with his work and kept little of it, whether large parts of his manuscripts were lost (something Polylas implies), or whether he had difficulties fleshing out the ambitious structure of his planned works is not clear, but the fragments show a huge disconnect between intention and surviving work: &quot;The Cretan&quot; begins with a fragment of Canto 18 and ends with Canto 22, and none of them are complete; &quot;Lambros&quot; was conceived with at least 38 cantos (of some of them only a prose summary survives), with the shortest poetic fragment consisting of a single line, and the longest containing 33 stanzas; the second draft of &quot;The Free Besieged&quot; consists of 61 fragments, of which 27 are single lines, seven are two lines, and two are half-lines.

== Legacy ==

Solomos is commonly referred to as Greece&#x27;s &quot;national poet&quot; for his important legacy to Greek literature and national identity.

The Museum of Solomos and Eminent Zakynthians was founded in 1959, located in St Mark&#x27;s Plaza in Zakynthos city. It features him and Andreas Kalvos prominently. He has been interred in the mausoleum since 1968.

He was depicted on the reverse of the Greek ₯20 coin of 1990–2001. A 50 drachmas commemorative coin was issued in 1998 for the 200th anniversary of his birth.

The international airport on the island of Zakynthos and a square in Nicosia, Cyprus, are named after Dionysis Solomos.

The film &quot;Eternity and a Day&quot; (1998) depicts a dying Greek poet who attempts to complete some of Solomos&#x27; unfinished works. He also sees visions of Solomos (played by Fabrizio Bentivoglio) as he travels around Thessaloniki.

<text>New Jersey City University (NJCU) is a public university in Jersey City, New Jersey. Originally chartered in 1927, NJCU consists of the School of Business, College of Arts and Sciences, College of Education, and College of Professional Studies and is part of New Jersey&#x27;s public system of higher education. In 2022, it announced that it was severely reducing its academic offerings due to a budgetary crisis. In 2024, the school was considered financially stable though still underfunded.

==Historical chronology==

* 1927: The New Jersey State Normal School at Jersey City was chartered. The institution was built to accommodate 1,000 students and an eight-room demonstration school in its one building, Hepburn Hall, on on what was then Hudson Boulevard.
* 1935: The name was changed to New Jersey State Teachers College at Jersey City. The institution was authorized to offer a four-year teacher education program and award the Bachelor of Science degree in education.
* 1936: A degree program in health education and nursing was initiated in cooperation with the Jersey City Medical Center for the training of school nurses.
* 1958: New Jersey State Teachers College at Jersey City became Jersey City State College and was authorized to award the bachelor of arts degree.
* 1959: The institution began to offer the Master of Arts in elementary education.
* 1968: Jersey City State College became a multipurpose institution, authorized to develop a liberal arts program and to enlarge teacher preparation programs.
* 1981: The Thomas Edison Film Festival established as the Black Maria Film and Video Festival at NJCU Media Arts Department.
* 1985: The institution was awarded a $5.7 million Governor&#x27;s Challenge Grant for an expanded Cooperative Education Program, which would serve all academic majors.
* 1998: The New Jersey Commission on Higher Education approved a petition submitted by the JCSC Board of Trustees requesting that the institution be granted university status and renamed New Jersey City University. The university was restructured into three colleges of Arts and Sciences, Education, and Professional Studies.
* 2003: NJCU joined with the City of Jersey City, the Jersey City Board of Education, and New Jersey Transit to collaborate on the Jersey City Bayfront urban development plan.
* 2012: After 19 years, NJCU President Carlos Hernandez retired. Under his tenure, three new buildings were erected and, in 1998, the school became a university.
* 2013: On September 20, NJCU inaugurated Dr. Sue Henderson to be the 12th president of the University, the first woman to hold the position.
* 2016: First building of major campus expansion opened.
* 2022: In June 2022, NJCU declared a financial emergency and sought a $10 million lifeline from the state government. Henderson resigned as president of the university, effective July 1. In August, Governor Phil Murphy called for an investigation into NJCU&#x27;s dramatic change in financial standing from a surplus of $108 million in 2013 to a deficit of $67 million amid plans to expand NJCU&#x27;s campus. It was later learned that there was never a surplus and those facts were misreported. The university did have a $22.7 million operating deficit. The university announced a cut of 37% of its academic offerings. Campus expansion was curtailed.

==Academics==

NJCU is organized into four colleges. In 2022 it announced the reduction of numerous undergraduate and graduate degree programs.

The largest programs of study at NJCU are psychology, nursing, early childhood education, and music. In addition, the NJCU Fire Science program is the only university-based bachelor&#x27;s degree fire science program in the State of New Jersey. NJCU has a department of professional security studies that prepares students for work with agencies such as the FBI, NSA, and CIA.

==Campus==

===A. Harry Moore School===

A special needs school operated by NJCU and the Jersey City Board of Education, the A. Harry Moore Laboratory School was first opened in 1931 and offers academic, therapeutic, and social programs for approximately 140 students between the ages of three and 21. The students are classified as Preschool Disabled, Learning and Language Disabled, and/or Multiply Disabled. The school has operated under the direction of the College of Education of NJCU since 1963. In September 2019, it was announced that the school would close in 2020, though the decision was quickly walked back after public and political backlash. In 2021, a former principal sued both the school and University alleging wrongful termination after he pushed for stricter COVID-19 protocols.

===Main campus===

The university&#x27;s landscaped main campus is situated on Kennedy Boulevard. The university&#x27;s administrative center is Hepburn Hall. Designed by Guilbert and Betelle and completed in 1930, the Collegiate Gothic structure serves as the symbol of the university and features in school publications as well as the university&#x27;s athletic nickname.

The NJCU Frank J. Guarini Library is available to students as well as staff for learning materials such as books, DVDs, CDs, computer lab, quiet study rooms, and access to electronic databases. Since the Fall 2014 semester, despite some objections by librarians, a Dunkin Donuts franchise has been open on the first floor of the library.

A six-story Arts and Sciences building named Karnoutsos Hall was designed by architect Michael Graves. It is known by students as the Crayola building, because of the colors which make up the building&#x27;s exterior, and as the K building. It is located in the center of the campus. The building houses 14 classrooms, 10 computer labs, faculty offices for nine departments, and the Office of the Dean of Arts and Sciences.

Other academic buildings include: Rossey Hall (music, dance, and theatre; sociology and anthropology; environmental and earth science; nursing; and educational counseling; as well as numerous classrooms); the Science Building (natural sciences); the Professional Studies Building (education departments; national security/security studies; criminal justice); Fries Hall (media arts); and Grossnickle Hall.

The Visual Arts Building on Culver Avenue features a Maya Lin sculpture in the entrance garden area. The university is as of 2024 exploring the potential sale of the building.

===West campus===

Renovated buildings on West Side Avenue are also part of the school, including the West Side Theatre, which is used for theatrical productions and community events. Another building houses the Business Development Incubator program. The affiliated University Academy Charter High School opened in 2002 and offers students with a high grade average a scholarship.

Construction began on the &quot;West Campus&quot; between West Side Avenue and Bayfront on Route 440 in the mid 2010s. Plans for further expansion were curtailed in 2022 due to financial difficulties and decreased enrollment. It would have more than doubled the university&#x27;s footprint and was to have included academic buildings, residences, retail spaces, parking, and a University Promenade. The first building, a student residence, opened in 2016. A new performing arts center
 would have housed the Joffrey Ballet School.

===Athletic complex===
The university&#x27;s Thomas M. Gerrity Athletic Complex is located less than a mile southwest of the main campus at near Droyers Point on Newark Bay. In 2017, the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer entered into a facility usage partnership with the university to upgrade the natural grass soccer training field at the complex to professionally approved standards. Under the partnership, national and international teams will be allowed to train at the facility ahead of their matches at Red Bull Arena. Phase one of the project began in early June 2017 and involved regrading, aeration and reseeding of the training facility. The project, which is still ongoing, will also involve overall maintenance of the training facility.

===NJCU School of Business===
In September 2015, the NJCU School of Business opened at Harborside Plaza directly on the Jersey City waterfront. The two-story facility features 18 instructional spaces, two data science centers, computer labs and laundry facilities, an auditorium, offices, study areas, a student lounge, and a large waterfront conference center with views of Lower Manhattan.

===Campus living===
The university operates three residence halls: Co-op Hall, a corridor-style facility with common area bathrooms and study lounges for freshmen and first year dorm students; Vodra Hall, a traditional dormitory with shared bathrooms between rooms for upper-class students and special needs individuals; and West Campus Village, its newest suite-style residence hall on its west campus at University Place.

==Athletics==
NJCU is a member of Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

* The John J. Moore Athletics and Fitness Center (JMAC) is the home of the Gothic Knight basketball, volleyball and wrestling programs and the focal point for the NJCU athletic department and recreation and intramural activities. The JMAC opened in the fall of 1994, giving the university one of the finest indoor recreational facilities in the area. The building features a 2,000-seat basketball and volleyball arena, an exercise and fitness center, a swimming and diving pool with adjacent sauna, a elevated jogging track, a multi-purpose room for aerobics and classes, and locker room space for teams, students, faculty, and staff.

* New Jersey City University sponsors 17 intercollegiate athletic programs in baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s bowling, women&#x27;s cross country, Esports, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track and field, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s wrestling, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball.
* The women&#x27;s bowling team qualified for the first seven NCAA National Collegiate Championship events from 2004 to 2010. The Gothic Knights advanced to the national semi-finals four times, always coming in even-numbered years: 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010, finishing third nationally in 2004 and 2008. NJCU hosted the 2010 NCAA Championship in New Brunswick, N.J.
* The men&#x27;s basketball team is the oldest program, having reached the Final Four in 1986 and 1992. The team has appeared in 21 NCAA Tournaments, most recently in three consecutive years from 2017 to 2019.
* The baseball team now, under tenth-year head coach Jerry Smith, along with long-time assistant coaches Nick Cesare and Raj Subramanian have built the program into a contender which has culminated in a win over the No. 1 ranked team in the nation and program records for wins in a single season and two, three and four-year periods.
* In the 2020–2021 year, the university began offering varsity programs in eSports, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s wrestling. It&#x27;s the first university in New Jersey or the tristate area to ever offer a collegiate program for women&#x27;s wrestling, the first new men&#x27;s wrestling in the state since 1997, and one of the first to offer eSports at the varsity level. 

==Student newspaper==

<doc id="295299" wikidata="Q7096138" url="?curid=295299" title="Open Mind Common Sense">
<text>Open Mind Common Sense (OMCS) is an artificial intelligence project based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab whose goal is to build and utilize a large commonsense knowledge base from the contributions of many thousands of people across the Web. It has been active from 1999 to 2016.

Since its founding, it has accumulated more than a million English facts from over 15,000 contributors in addition to knowledge bases in other languages. Much of OMCS&#x27;s software is built on three interconnected representations: the natural language corpus that people interact with directly, a semantic network built from this corpus called ConceptNet, and a matrix-based representation of ConceptNet called AnalogySpace that can infer new knowledge using dimensionality reduction. The knowledge collected by Open Mind Common Sense has enabled research projects at MIT and elsewhere.

== History ==

The project was the brainchild of Marvin Minsky, Push Singh, Catherine Havasi, and others. Development work began in September 1999, and the project opened to the Internet a year later. Havasi described it in her dissertation as &quot;an attempt to ... harness some of the distributed human computing power of the Internet, an idea which was then only in its early stages.&quot; The original OMCS was influenced by the website Everything2 and its predecessor, and presents a minimalist interface that is inspired by Google.

Push Singh would have become a professor at the MIT Media Lab and lead the Common Sense Computing group in 2007, but committed suicide on February 28, 2006.

The project is currently run by the Digital Intuition Group at the MIT Media Lab under Catherine Havasi. 

== Database and website ==

There are many different types of knowledge in OMCS. Some statements convey relationships between objects or events, expressed as simple phrases of natural language: some examples include &quot;A coat is used for keeping warm&quot;, &quot;The sun is very hot&quot;, and &quot;The last thing you do when you cook dinner is wash your dishes&quot;. The database also contains information on the emotional content of situations, in such statements as &quot;Spending time with friends causes happiness&quot; and &quot;Getting into a car wreck makes one angry&quot;. OMCS contains information on people&#x27;s desires and goals, both large and small, such as &quot;People want to be
respected&quot; and &quot;People want good coffee&quot;.

Originally, these statements could be entered into the Web site as unconstrained sentences of text, which had to be parsed later. The current version of the Web site collects knowledge only using more structured fill-in-the-blank templates. OMCS also makes use of data collected by the Game With a Purpose &quot;Verbosity&quot;.

In its native form, the OMCS database is simply a collection of these short sentences that convey some common knowledge. In order to use this knowledge computationally, it has to be transformed into a more structured representation.

== ConceptNet ==

ConceptNet is a semantic network based on the information in the OMCS database. ConceptNet is expressed as a directed graph whose nodes are concepts, and whose edges are assertions of common sense about these concepts. Concepts represent sets of closely related natural language phrases, which could be noun phrases, verb phrases, adjective phrases, or clauses.

ConceptNet is created from the natural-language assertions in OMCS by matching them against patterns using a shallow parser. Assertions are expressed as relations between two concepts, selected from a limited set of possible
relations. The various relations represent common sentence patterns found in the OMCS corpus, and in particular, every &quot;fill-in-the-blanks&quot; template used on the knowledge-collection Web site is associated with a particular relation.

The data structures that make up ConceptNet were significantly reorganized in 2007, and published as ConceptNet 3. The Software Agents group currently distributes a database and API for the new version 4.0.

In 2010, OMCS co-founder and director Catherine Havasi, with Robyn Speer, Dennis Clark and Jason Alonso, created Luminoso, a text analytics software company that builds on ConceptNet. It uses ConceptNet as its primary lexical resource in order to help businesses make sense of and derive insight from vast amounts of qualitative data, including surveys, product reviews and social media.

== Machine learning tools ==

The information in ConceptNet can be used as a basis for machine learning algorithms. One representation, called AnalogySpace, uses singular value decomposition to generalize and represent patterns in the knowledge in
ConceptNet, in a way that can be used in AI applications. Its creators distribute a Python machine learning toolkit called Divisi for performing machine learning based on text corpora, structured knowledge bases such as ConceptNet, and combinations of the two.

== Comparison to other projects ==

Other similar projects include Never-Ending Language Learning, Mindpixel (discontinued), Cyc, Learner, SenticNet, Freebase, YAGO, DBpedia, and Open Mind 1001 Questions, which have explored alternative approaches to collecting knowledge and providing incentive for participation.

The Open Mind Common Sense project differs from Cyc because it has focused on representing the common sense knowledge it collected as English sentences, rather than using a formal logical structure. ConceptNet is described by one of its creators, Hugo Liu, as being structured more like WordNet than Cyc, due to its &quot;emphasis on informal conceptual-connectedness over formal linguistic-rigor&quot;.

<doc id="295302" wikidata="Q425718" url="?curid=295302" title="John Thach">
<text>John Smith Thach (April 19, 1905 – April 15, 1981) was a World War II Naval Aviator, air combat tactician, and United States Navy admiral. Thach developed the Thach Weave, a combat flight formation which could counter enemy fighters of superior performance, and later the big blue blanket, an aerial defense against kamikaze attacks.

==Early career==
John S. Thach was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, on April 19, 1905. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1927 and spent two years serving in battleships, before becoming a Naval Aviator in early 1930. His USNA classmates included William Brockman, Creed Burlingame, and Eugene Lindsey. Thach spent the next decade serving as a test pilot and instructor and establishing a reputation as an expert in aerial gunnery.

==World War II==

In early 1940, Thach was placed in command of Fighting Squadron Three (VF-3). There he met a young ensign just out of flight school, Edward O&#x27;Hare, later a Medal of Honor recipient. Thach made O&#x27;Hare his wingman and taught him everything he knew. At the United States Navy fleet gunnery competition at the end of 1940, eight of the 16 VF-3 pilots qualified for the gunnery &quot;E&quot; award (&quot;excellence&quot;).

Later Thach developed a fighter combat tactic known as the Thach Weave. This tactic enabled American fighter aircraft to hold their own against the more maneuverable Mitsubishi A6M Zero, the primary Imperial Japanese Navy fighter aircraft.

Lieutenant Commander Thach and VF-3 flew from in the early part of World War II, and was assigned to during the Battle of Midway in June 1942. On the morning of June 4, Thach led a six-plane sortie from VF-3, escorting twelve Douglas TBD Devastators of VT-3 led by Lieutenant Commander Lance Massey from &quot;Yorktown&quot;, when they discovered the main Japanese carrier fleet. They were immediately attacked by 15 to 20 Japanese fighters. Thach decided to use his namesake maneuver, marking its first combat usage. Although outnumbered and outmaneuvered, Thach managed to shoot down three Zeros and a wingman accounted for another, at the cost of one Grumman F4F Wildcat.
After Midway, Thach was assigned to instruct other pilots in combat tactics. The United States Navy pulled its best combat pilots out of action to train newer pilots, while the Japanese kept their best pilots in combat. As the war progressed, the Japanese Navy lost their experienced pilots due to attrition and had no well-trained replacements, while the United States was able to improve the general fighting ability of their own personnel. When the Japanese resorted to the feared Kamikaze suicide attacks, Thach developed the &quot;big blue blanket&quot; system to provide an adequate defense.

Later in the war, Commander Thach became operations officer to Vice Admiral John S. McCain Sr., commander of the Fast Carrier Task Force. Thach was also present at the formal Japanese surrender aboard the battleship on September 2, 1945, in Tokyo Bay.

Thach was a flying ace, having been credited with shooting down six enemy aircraft during World War II.

==Post–World War II==
Thach commanded during the Korean War and in 1953–54. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1955.

In 1958 and 1959, Thach was placed in command of an antisubmarine development unit, &quot;Task Group Alpha&quot;, with the aircraft carrier serving as his flagship. He subsequently appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on September 1, 1958, for his contributions to anti-submarine warfare (ASW), which was a primary focus at the time in the ongoing Cold War. An annual award was later established in his name for presentation to the top ASW squadron in the navy.

Thach was promoted to vice admiral in 1960 and served as the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air in the Pentagon, where he presided over development of the A-7 Corsair II, among other naval aviation programs. As Commander in Chief, United States Naval Forces Europe, starting in 1965, he pinned on his fourth star as a full admiral, retiring from the Navy in May 1967 from that position.

The Arkansas Aviation Historical Society inducted Thach into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 1981.

Thach died on April 15, 1981, in Coronado, California, four days before his 76th birthday, and was buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego.

The frigate was named in his honor.

==Personal life==
Thach and his wife Madalynn had four children.

<doc id="295316" wikidata="Q1415559" url="?curid=295316" title="Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog">
<text>Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog is an animated series based on the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; video game series, produced by Sega of America, DIC Animation City, Bohbot Entertainment and the Italian studio Reteitalia S.p.A. in association with Spanish network Telecinco. The show aired a total of 65 episodes from September 6 to December 3, 1993. It was syndicated by Bohbot Entertainment in the United States.

A spin-off video game, &quot;Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine&quot;, was developed, featuring several original characters from the series. Furthermore, other elements, such as Sonic&#x27;s fondness for chili dogs, would be featured in later video games and media of the franchise. Additionally, on November 24, 1996, USA Network aired &quot;Sonic Christmas Blast&quot;, a Christmas special which was produced to promote &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; (originally meant for the ultimately cancelled &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;).

==Plot==
&quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; is a comical, light-hearted and gag-driven adventure series based on the titular character Sonic the Hedgehog, an arrogant and mischievous yet kind-hearted teenage hedgehog with the power to move at supersonic speeds. Sonic, along with his idolizing young friend Tails, regularly oppose the main antagonist Dr. Robotnik, his robot henchmen Scratch, Grounder, and Coconuts, and thwart their plans to conquer their home planet of Mobius.

The series features a short PSA segment titled &quot;Sonic Says&quot; at the end of each episode excluding &quot;Sonic Christmas Blast&quot;; these segments were written by Phil Harnage.

==Characters==
===Heroes===
* Sonic (voiced by Jaleel White) is a blue hedgehog who is the main character of the series. He travels the world and works to defend Mobius from the threat of Dr. Robotnik. Just like in the video games, Sonic can move at fast speeds. He has also shown to be quite cunning and deceitful, using various tricks and disguises to get one over his opponents, especially whenever his speed is nullified.
* Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower (voiced by Christopher Stephen Welch in the TV series, Chris Turner in &quot;Sonic Christmas Blast&quot;) is a two-tailed fox who is Sonic&#x27;s best friend and sidekick. Sonic found him as a toddler, apparently abandoned because of his multiple tails, which he can use to fly like in the video games. He usually displays childlike intelligence but has shown to have exceptional skills as a mechanic and a pilot like his video game counterpart. He has a duller, browner color scheme that his videogame counterpart.

===Villains===
* Doctor Ivo Robotnik (voiced by Long John Baldry) is an evil mad scientist and the archenemy of Sonic the Hedgehog who uses his robots and inventions in order to take over Mobius. His headquarters is a fortress atop a mountain, where he uses his Robo-Matic Machine to create robots called Badniks to aid him in his plots. While Robotnik&#x27;s mechanical aptitude can make him a genuine threat, his childish, manic and often egotistical nature greatly overpowers his tyrannical side, always leading to his defeat and humiliation. In the first episode, it is mentioned that he once had a full head of hair, but the constant foils from Sonic caused him to gradually tear it out.
* Scratch (voiced by Phil Hayes) is a hot-headed chicken-like Badnik, though taller and more stylized than any specific bird-based one from the games. Originally, Robotnik wanted the Robo-Matic Machine to create a super robot only for it to produce Scratch instead due to a malfunction. Despite this, Scratch has a self-inflated opinion of his talent, despite being only marginally more intelligent than Grounder.
* Grounder (voiced by Garry Chalk) is Scratch&#x27;s younger non-identical twin brother, based on the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; enemy of the same name. He is a dimwitted mole-type Badnik who was created by Dr. Robotnik from parts of Scratch who accidentally sabotaged the building process. He has tank treads for legs and drills for a nose and hands. A recurring gag involves Grounder expressing desire for a mother.
* Coconuts (voiced by Ian James Corlett) is a cynical monkey-type Badnik who was demoted to janitor duty before the creation of Scratch and Grounder, also based on a &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; enemy. He is not respected by anyone and seeks to up his status by impressing Robotnik or outdoing Scratch and Grounder. He seems genuinely smarter than other robots (which is always humorously dismissed or unrecognized) using his own styled gadgets in solo attempts at defeating Sonic and is less likely to be fooled by outlandish disguises.

===Other===
* Breezie (voiced by Venus Terzo) is a beautiful hedgehog-type Badnik created by Dr. Robotnik in a plot to get rid of Sonic. She initially manipulated Sonic into falling in love with her and giving her various gifts, but when she realized that Sonic really did care for her and does not see her as a robot, she developed genuine romantic feelings for him and betrayed and left Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s services. Breezie later met Robotnik Jr. who later developed a crush on her.
* Momma Robotnik (voiced by Kathleen Barr) is the mother of Dr. Robotnik who is even worse than her son. While kept in an asylum called the Mobius Home for Really Bizarre Mothers as punishment for bad parenting, she tends to escape on occasion and her insanity even scares her son. At the end of most of her appearances, she ends up recaptured and taken back to the home against her will.
* Wes Weasley (voiced by Michael Donovan) is a weasel who works as a door-to-door salesman. He would often sell devices to Dr. Robotnik that would fail because of either Sonic&#x27;s ingenuity or Scratch and Grounder&#x27;s incompetence. He frequently alternates between being on Robotnik and Sonic&#x27;s side, and will switch to another if there is a profit to be made or if something does not lean in his favor.
* Sergeant Doberman (voiced by Phil Hayes) is a Doberman Pinscher who is a retired army sergeant and a known war hero.
* Professor Von Schlemmer (voiced by French Tickner) is a brilliant but eccentric and kooky scientist who is an ally of Sonic and Tails.
* Professor Caninestein (voiced by Garry Chalk) is a highly-intelligent dog scientist that invents gadgets for Sonic to use. Dr. Robotnik once captured him and had him build a time machine in order to steal four Chaos Emeralds in different time periods.
* Robotnik Jr. (voiced by Ian James Corlett) is a diminutive Badnik resembling Robotnik, which the latter initially created to be his son and carry on his legacy when he passes away. Unfortunately, he defects from his creator and sides with Sonic and Tails. Jr. later fell in love with Breezie.
* Mad Mike (voiced by Michael Donovan) and Big Griz (voiced by French Tickner) are a duo of bears who both go by the name &quot;Da Bears&quot;. They are Sonic and Tails&#x27; proclaimed biggest fans and despite their low intelligence, display great feats of courage and strength.
* Bert Whoo is a green owl. He is the owner of Bert&#x27;s Diner as well as the Mayor and Sheriff of Mobius Corners. When Robotnik issued an unlawful protection service on Mobius Corners, Bert was one of its few citizens who refused to pay and as a result, ran his own Diner to financially support himself. He is kidnapped by Scratch and Grounder, but is rescued by Sonic and Tails, with some assistance from his employee Roxy.
** Roxy is a raccoon and the only known employee of Bert&#x27;s Diner. She has a crush on Sonic, which he returns at the end of her debut episode, &quot;Untouchable Sonic&quot;.
* Miss Possum (voiced by Louise Vallance) is a Phalangeriformes who became the Sheriff of Tranquil Gulch following the retirement of Sonic. She develops an attraction towards Sonic as he frequently saves her from Scratch and Grounder. She later attends Sonic&#x27;s birthday in &quot;Robotnikland&quot;.
* Robot (voiced by Cathy Weseluck) as his name implies, is a small, purple robot invented by Scratch and Grounder with tricycle wheels for mobility and pinchers for hands. Debuting in &quot;The Robots&#x27; Robot&quot;, he defects against his creators after being scolded by Robotnik. He later reappears in &quot;Hedgehog of the Year&quot;, saying a word in regards to Sonic.
* Collie Chang (voiced by Kathleen Barr), is a black cat news anchor and reporter who hosts a news block titled &quot;News or What?&quot;, in which she reports on the various news in Mobius. Her name is a parody of Connie Chung.

==Production==
&quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was created by DIC Animation City (in association with Sega of America whose CEO Tom Kalinske and newly appointed consumer products director Michealene Risley licensed the characters to DIC), which produced a total of 65 episodes for its one-season, and was syndicated by Bohbot Entertainment, later known as BKN International (in the original run, every episode began and ended with the &quot;Bohbot Entertainment Presents&quot; logo), and the Italian Reteitalia S.p.A., part of Fininvest. The show&#x27;s animation was outsourced to four animation studios: 
* the Chinese and Korean subdivisions of Rainbow Animation Group (later renamed Galaxy Digimation, not to be confused with the Italian studio Rainbow S.p.A.),
* the Korean Sae Rom Production (which also at the same time worked on the animation for the Saturday morning Sonic cartoon for ABC),
* the Taiwanese and Chinese Hong Ying Animation (which would later work on the animation for &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;),
* the Japanese Tokyo Movie Shinsha (more specifically its subsidiary, Telecom Animation Film), which coincidentally would later become part of Sega and produce its own Sonic cartoon, &quot;Sonic X&quot;.
Additionally, some of the storyboards were done by the Spanish animation studio Milimetros Dibujos Animados, which also worked on the animation for the Saturday morning Sonic cartoon and the main title animation for &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;. Pre-production stages of the show (as well as the first season of the Saturday morning cartoon) were handled by Canadian Studio B (later known as DHX Media Vancouver).

According to Robby London, DIC originally made a deal to produce only the Saturday morning &quot;Sonic&quot; series for the ABC network, which was originally planned to air in the Fall of 1992. The cartoon was to be more light-hearted compared to the final product, as reflected by the episode &quot;Heads or Tails&quot;, early promotional material found in Fleetway&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; and the early issues of Sonic the Hedgehog comics by Archie, which were based on the Saturday morning Sonic cartoon. However, DIC also wanted to expand the show and produce additional episodes for weekday syndication as well, similar to what DIC has previously done with &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, but Mark Pedowitz, ABC&#x27;s senior vice president of business affairs and contracts, expected &quot;Sonic&quot; to air exclusively on ABC and rejected the idea, telling London &quot;If you guys want to do syndication, be our guest, go with God, but you won&#x27;t be on our network.&quot; ABC would not agree to the deal until London came up with a proposition that DIC would produce a separate, vastly different Sonic show for syndication instead, the result of which became &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Afterward, ABC was at first willing to air only a single half-hour episode as a prime-time special scheduled for March 1993 (which would become the episode &quot;Heads or Tails&quot;) before ultimately delaying it and including it as part of the show which ABC picked up again for a full season, this time airing in the Fall of 1993, alongside &quot;Adventures&quot; airing in syndication at the same time. During that time, the Saturday morning Sonic cartoon received a makeover and was made darker and more serious in order to differentiate itself from the syndicated Sonic cartoon. The two shows would be connected through &quot;Family Matters&quot; star Jaleel White portraying Sonic in both series; ABC itself was airing &quot;Family Matters&quot; during both shows&#x27; run, keeping White busy playing Sonic on two different series alongside his &quot;Family Matters&quot; role as Steve Urkel.

The theme song is composed by Clark Gassman and it is a combination of the main theme from the 1991 video game as well as In the Hall of the Mountain King by Edvard Grieg and Flight of the Bumblebee by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.

==Broadcast and distribution==
===First-run broadcast===

The series was shown through syndication in the United States in the fall of 1993 on either weekday afternoons or mornings, depending on the TV station. In the United Kingdom, the series was screened on Channel 4 in 1993 on Sunday mornings at 9:00, but with the &quot;Sonic Says&quot; segments edited out. They were also edited out on The Children&#x27;s Channel and the UK VHS releases of the series. The weekday morning airings in Australia on Seven Network as part of Agro&#x27;s Cartoon Connection retained the segments. The cartoon was broadcast in the Republic of Ireland on RTÉ Two from 12 September to December 1994 on weekday afternoons with the segments retained also.

===Rebroadcast===
USA Network re-aired the original episodes of the show in the United States from 1994 to 1996 (with an additional Christmas special ordered by Sega to be produced for the Christmas season of 1996 to ride on the coattails with the release of &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;). The series later returned to syndication as part of the BKN block from 1997 to 1998, and later BKN Kids II from 1999 until 2000. Toon Disney would start broadcasting the series in September 1998, and aired on the channel until 2002.

This TV subsequently aired the first 13 episodes of the show from 2010 to 2011 on their Cookie Jar Toons block. The series was also available on Netflix, and contains 20 episodes. From December 2018-November 2020, reruns of the series began airing on Starz. Later starting on September 3, 2019, the show aired its reruns on the streaming service Pluto TV for the first time. In 2024, MeTV Toons aired the Christmas special as part of the network&#x27;s &quot;Tis&#x27; the Season for Toons&quot; event.

In September 2003, DIC revealed a new international package consisting of &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and the &quot;Sonic Christmas Blast&quot; special, titled &quot;Totally Sonic!&quot;. The package would also feature digitally re-mastered, color-enhanced versions of the shows with new contemporary music, as well as bonus director&#x27;s cut &quot;Secret Sonic&quot; episodes.

The series also aired on KidsCo, as with many other DIC-produced cartoons.

In the Philippines, it aired on Yey! in 2020 everyday at 2:00 pm.

==Reception==
&quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; received a mixed reception. Randy Miller III of DVDTalk said, &quot;While it&#x27;s obvious that &quot;The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;] won&#x27;t ever be mentioned in the same sentence with Disney, Pixar or Studio Ghibli (except for this one), there&#x27;s enough goofy fun here to entertain any resident of the 16-bit gaming era.&quot; Michael Rubino of DVD Verdict criticized the series for being dated, contrived, and bloated with chili dog jokes. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; listed the series as one of &quot;the worst things to happen to Sonic.&quot; It commented that it &quot;made &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; look like a rigid, strictly story-driven opus of animation&quot;, and criticized the supporting cast as &quot;wholly uninteresting, unfunny and just all around annoying.&quot;

Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the series an overall rating of 3/5 and noted that while the show&#x27;s pace is &quot;frantic&quot;, &quot;the series emphasizes positive themes for kids about personal safety and interpersonal relationships.&quot; Bob Mackey of &quot;USgamer&quot; wrote that the show&#x27;s attempts to emulate &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; &quot;were done in by the lack of quality control that typically plagued 65-episode syndicated series&quot;, and that &quot;the zippy, timing-reliant slapstick &quot;Adventures&quot; relied on never stood a chance against the animation sweatshops DIC regularly used to pump out their nearly endless supply of televised content.&quot;

Ian Flynn, writer for the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic book series by Archie Comics, remarked that &quot;Adventures&quot; was the closest to &quot;[getting] &quot;Sonic&quot; right&quot; despite &quot;fail[ing] on the details&quot;, although he observed that the show&#x27;s gags were &quot;polarizing&quot; and that the guest characters &quot;ranged from tired tropes (Breezie) to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; knockoffs (Da Bears)&quot;. Pierre DeCelles, who worked on the show as a Senior Animation Director at Hong Ying animation studio, has described the show as &quot;fun and humorous&quot;.

The show&#x27;s characterisation of Robotnik has become iconic within the &quot;Sonic&quot; fandom. Robotnik&#x27;s remark &quot;Snooping as usual, I see&quot; from the episode &quot;Boogey-Mania&quot; gave rise to the internet meme &quot;Pingas,&quot; first featured in a 2007 YouTube poop. The quote has been widely referenced on YouTube since the late 2000s, both in videos and in music remixes, and in the &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; television show and Archie comic series.

<doc id="295318" wikidata="Q3119070" url="?curid=295318" title="Thach Weave">
<text>The Thach weave (also known as a beam defense position) is an aerial combat tactic that was developed by naval aviator John S. Thach and named by James H. Flatley of the United States Navy soon after the United States&#x27; entry into World War II.

It is a tactical formation maneuver in which two or more allied planes wove in regularly intersecting flight paths to lure an enemy into focusing on one plane, while the targeted pilot&#x27;s wingman would come into position to attack the pursuer.

==Overcoming the Wildcat&#x27;s disadvantage==
Thach had heard, from a report published in the 22 September 1941 Fleet Air Tactical Unit Intelligence Bulletin, of the Japanese Mitsubishi Zero&#x27;s extraordinary maneuverability and rate of climb. Before even experiencing it for himself, he began to devise tactics meant to give the slower-turning American Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters a chance in combat. While based in San Diego, he would spend every evening thinking of different tactics that could overcome the Zero&#x27;s maneuverability, and would then test them in flight the following day.

Working at night with matchsticks on the table, he eventually came up with what he called &quot;beam defense position&quot;, but which soon became known as the &quot;Thach weave&quot;. The theory behind the beam attack was predicated on the 2-plane element of the finger-four formation. It was executed either by two fighter aircraft side-by-side or by two pairs of fighters flying together. When an enemy aircraft chose one fighter as his target (the &quot;bait&quot; fighter; his wingman being the &quot;hook&quot;), the two wingmen turned in towards each other. After crossing paths, and once their separation was great enough, they would then repeat the exercise, again turning in towards each other, bringing the enemy plane into the hook&#x27;s sights. A correctly executed Thach weave (assuming the bait was taken and followed) left little chance of escape to even the most maneuverable opponent.

Thach called on Ensign Edward &quot;Butch&quot; O&#x27;Hare, who led the second section in Thach&#x27;s division, to test the idea. Thach took off with three other Wildcats in the role of defenders, O&#x27;Hare meanwhile led four Wildcats in the role of attackers. The defending aircraft had their throttles wired (to restrict their performance), while the attacking aircraft had their engine power unrestricted this simulated an attack by superior fighter aircraft.

Trying a series of mock attacks, O&#x27;Hare found that in every instance Thach&#x27;s fighters, despite their power handicap, had either ruined his attack or actually maneuvered into position to shoot back. After landing, O&#x27;Hare excitedly congratulated Thach: &quot;Skipper, it really worked. I couldn&#x27;t make any attack without seeing the nose of one of your airplanes pointed at me.&quot;

==In combat==
Thach carried out the first test of the tactic in combat during the Battle of Midway in June 1942, when a squadron of Zeroes attacked his flight of four Wildcats. Thach&#x27;s wingman, Ensign R. A. M. Dibb, was attacked by a Japanese pilot and turned towards Thach, who dove under his wingman and fired at the incoming enemy aircraft&#x27;s belly until its engine ignited. The maneuver soon became standard among US Navy pilots and was adopted by USAAF pilots.

For instance, during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, Flatley&#x27;s division of four Wildcats encountered Zeros from &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; and deployed Thach weave defensive tactics when they attacked. One of the attackers was Lieutenant Yoshio Shiga, who gave up after he made several runs.

Marines flying Wildcats from Henderson Field on Guadalcanal also adopted the Thach weave. The tactic initially confounded the Japanese Zero pilots flying out of Rabaul. Saburō Sakai, the famous Japanese ace, relates their reaction to the Thach weave when they encountered Guadalcanal Wildcats using it:

The maneuver proved so effective that American pilots also used it during the Vietnam War, and it remains a viable dogfighting tactic today.

==Criticism==
Some pilots criticised the Thach weave. One of the most notable among them was USN ace Swede Vejtasa, who claimed that it is ineffective when faced with experienced attacking pilots. During the training sessions, James Flatley and Vejtasa tested the maneuver with their divisions playing attacking and defending teams. In all attempts the attackers prevailed. According to Vejtasa, he then challenged Thach himself to repeat the exercise with him in order to prove his point, but Thach ignored the challenge.

The Japanese also eventually figured out how to break the Thach weave. For example, during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands when USN and IJN strike forces passed each other, Zeros from carrier &quot;Zuihō&quot; led by Lieutenant Moriyasu Hidaka attacked USN aircraft. In response, Ensigns Al Mead and Raleigh Rhodes in their Wildcats performed the maneuver, but were outmatched and were eventually forced to ditch their ruined fighters. In another example, initially USN Lieutenant Commander Sam Silber and his wingman executed the maneuver with a relative success during the Raid on Kavieng in 1944. However, a few days later they used it again and the attackers shot down the wingman, while Silber&#x27;s aircraft was severely damaged.

<text>The Society of Mind is both the title of a 1986 book and the name of a theory of natural intelligence as written and developed by Marvin Minsky.
In his book of the same name, Minsky constructs a model of human intelligence step by step, built up from the interactions of simple parts called &quot;s&quot;, which are themselves mindless. He describes the postulated &quot;s&quot; as constituting a &quot;society of mind&quot;, hence the title.

==The book==
The work, which first appeared in 1986, was the first comprehensive description of Minsky&#x27;s &quot;society of mind&quot; theory, which he began developing in the early 1970s. It is composed of 270 self-contained essays which are divided into 30 general chapters. The book was also made into a CD-ROM version.

In the process of explaining the society of mind, Minsky introduces a wide range of ideas and concepts. He develops theories about how processes such as language, memory, and learning work, and also covers concepts such as consciousness, the sense of self, and free will; because of this, many view &quot;The Society of Mind&quot; as a work of philosophy.

The book was not written to prove anything specific about AI or cognitive science, and does not reference physical brain structures. Instead, it is a collection of ideas about how the mind and thinking work on the conceptual level.

==The theory==
Minsky first started developing the theory with Seymour Papert in the early 1970s. Minsky said that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children&#x27;s blocks.

==Nature of mind==
A core tenet of Minsky&#x27;s philosophy is that &quot;minds are what brains do&quot;. The society of mind theory views the human mind and any other naturally evolved cognitive systems as a vast society of individually simple processes known as &quot;agents&quot;. These processes are the fundamental thinking entities from which minds are built, and together produce the many abilities we attribute to minds. The great power in viewing a mind as a society of agents, as opposed to the consequence of some basic principle or some simple formal system, is that different agents can be based on different types of processes with different purposes, ways of representing knowledge, and methods for producing results.
This idea is perhaps best summarized by the following quote:

<text>Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness ( Morgan, 23 August 1904 – 29 January 1970), was a mistress of King Edward VIII while he was Prince of Wales. She was supplanted in his affections by Wallis Simpson, for whose sake Edward abdicated, becoming the Duke of Windsor. She was the maternal aunt of the writer, fashion designer, and socialite Gloria Vanderbilt.

During most of Furness&#x27;s relationship with the Prince of Wales, she was married to British nobleman Marmaduke Furness, 1st Viscount Furness. They married in 1926 and divorced in 1933, the year before Thelma&#x27;s relationship with the Prince of Wales ended.

Furness&#x27;s first name was pronounced in Spanish fashion as &quot;TEL-ma&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Lucerne, Switzerland, Thelma Morgan was a daughter of Harry Hays Morgan Sr. (1860–1933), an American diplomat who was U.S. consul in Buenos Aires and in Brussels, and his half-Chilean, half-Irish-American wife, Laura Delphine Kilpatrick (1869–1956). Married in 1893, they were divorced in 1927.

Morgan&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a Union general, Hugh Judson Kilpatrick (1836–1881), who was also U.S. minister to Chile, and through her maternal grandmother Luisa Fernandez de Valdivieso (1836–1926), who was a niece of Crescente Errázuriz Valdivieso, Archbishop of Santiago, she reportedly was a descendant of Spain&#x27;s Royal House of Navarre.

Thelma Morgan had two sisters: Gloria (her identical twin, the mother of Gloria Vanderbilt, the fashion designer and artist and mother of news anchor Anderson Cooper) and Laura Consuelo Morgan (aka Tamar), who was married to three men in succession: Count Jean de Maupas du Juglart (a French nobleman); Benjamin Thaw Jr. of Pittsburgh; and Alfons B. Landa, president of Colonial Airlines and vice-chairman of the finance committee of the Democratic National Committee in 1948. Thelma Morgan also had a brother, Harry Hays Morgan Jr., who became a diplomat and then a minor Hollywood actor in such films as &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot; (1946) and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948). Her half-siblings, from her father&#x27;s first marriage to Mary E. Edgerton, were Constance Morgan (1887–1892) and Gladys &quot;Margaret&quot; Morgan (1889–1958).

==Film career==
For a very brief time, Furness was a motion picture producer and actress, after founding Thelma Morgan Pictures in 1923. As she told &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;I am incorporating the Thelma Morgan Pictures, Inc., with $100,000 capital and will produce big, sane, and sound &#x27;specials.&#x27; I will be my own star. Hitherto, my chief experience has been in Junior League shows.&quot; Her first starring role, in 1923, was the lead in a film &quot;Aphrodite&quot;, produced by her own company and filmed at Vitagraph Studios.

Furness described her leading role in &quot;Aphrodite&quot; to &quot;The New York Times&quot; as that of &quot;an American girl, brought up under the sinister influence of an old Egyptian woman.&quot; She also had small parts in the films &quot;Enemies of Women&quot; (1923), a William Randolph Hearst production whose cast included Lionel Barrymore and Clara Bow, &quot;So This Is Marriage?&quot; (1924), and &quot;Any Woman&quot; (1925).

==Marriages and relationships==
Morgan&#x27;s first husband was James Vail Converse (1893–1947), a grandson of Theodore N. Vail, former president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T). They were married in Washington, D.C., on 16 February 1922 when she was 17 years old; Converse was about a decade older and had been married before. They divorced in Los Angeles, California, on 10 April 1925. By this marriage she had one stepson, James Vail Converse Jr. (born 18 January 1918), her husband&#x27;s son from his first marriage to Nadine Melbourne.

After the divorce, Morgan was rumored to be engaged to the American actor Richard Bennett, the matinée-idol father of Hollywood film stars Constance Bennett, Joan Bennett, and Barbara Bennett.

Morgan&#x27;s second husband was Marmaduke Furness, 1st Viscount Furness (1883–1940), the chairman of Furness Shipping Company. She was his second wife. They were married on 27 June 1926, and divorced in 1933. They had one son, William Anthony Furness, 2nd Viscount Furness, and as the former wife of a British nobleman she was known as Thelma, Viscountess Furness. By this marriage she also had a stepson, Christopher Furness, and a stepdaughter, Averill Furness.
Furness first met the Prince of Wales at a ball at Londonderry House in 1926 but they did not meet again until the Leicestershire Agricultural Show at Leicester on 14 June 1929. Edward asked her to dine and they met regularly until she joined him on safari in East Africa early in 1930, when a closer relationship developed. On Edward&#x27;s return to Britain in April 1930 she was his regular weekend companion at the newly acquired Fort Belvedere until January 1934. She also entertained him at her London home, in Elsworthy Road, Primrose Hill, and the Furness country house, Burrough Court, in Leicestershire.

On 10 January 1931 at her country house Burrough Court, near Melton Mowbray, Furness introduced the prince to her close friend Wallis Simpson and, while visiting her sister Gloria in America between January and March 1934, she was supplanted in the Prince&#x27;s affection by Simpson. Reacting to Edward&#x27;s coldness later that year she threw herself into a short-lived affair with Prince Aly Khan. She had openly flirted with Khan during her voyage back to the UK in March 1934 which was reported to the Prince of Wales and widely reported in the British and American press including the social gossip magazine &quot;Tatler&quot;. While Furness was in the US with Aly Khan, Wallis Simpson stayed in her Mayfair home, 22 Farm Street, and entertained the Prince of Wales there.

Furness&#x27; identical twin sister was Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, who was married to Reginald Vanderbilt and had a daughter, Gloria Vanderbilt. This makes her a maternal great-aunt of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper.

==Final years==
Furness and her sister Gloria wrote a memoir called &quot;Double Exposure&quot; (1959).

Furness died in New York City on 29 January 1970. As her niece, Gloria Vanderbilt, recalled, &quot;She dropped dead on Seventy-third and Lexington on her way to see the doctor. In her bag was this miniature teddy bear that the Prince of Wales had given her, years before, when she came to be with my mother at the custody trial, and it was worn down to the nub&quot;.

Furness was buried next to her twin sister, Gloria, in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<text>Gerald Leslie Brockhurst (31 October 1890 – 4 May 1978) was a British painter and etcher.

During the 1930s and 1940s he was celebrated as a portraitist, painting society figures such as Marlene Dietrich and the Duchess of Windsor. Today he is best known for his small etched prints of beautiful, idealized women – many of them modelled by his first and second wives.

==Biography==
Born in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham on 31 October 1890, son of a coal merchant called Arthur Brockhurst, he soon showed precocious drawing skills and entered the Birmingham School of Art at the age of twelve. A pupil at the Royal Academy Schools in 1907, he won the gold medal and a travelling scholarship in 1913, enabling him to visit both France and Italy. This led to a closer study of such 15th-century artists as Piero della Francesca, Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci, whose work had an abiding influence on him. In 1914 he married for the first time to a Frenchwoman, Anaïs Folin, whom he used as the model for most of his early etchings of young womanhood (especially from 1920 till 1934).

From 1915 to 1919 Brockhurst and his wife Anaïs lived in Ireland, where they were friendly with the artist Augustus John and his circle.

Though he tried his hand at etching in 1914, it was not until 1920 that he began his career as an etcher in earnest, eventually achieving success as both a printmaker and society portraitist. Brockhurst held his first important exhibition in 1919, in London, and after it was well received returned to live there. In 1921 he was one of the early members of the newly-formed Society of Graphic Art and exhibited with them. Throughout the 1930s he continued an increasingly successful career as a portrait artist, with notable sitters including the film stars Merle Oberon and Marlene Dietrich, as well as the Duchess of Windsor, whose husband commissioned her portrait. In 1937 Brockhurst was elected to the Royal Academy and was able to command a price of 1,000 guineas for a portrait. In the same year however details of his relationship with his young model Kathleen Woodward, whom he had renamed Dorette, were made public after she gave an interview to the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;. Brockhurst&#x27;s marriage had previously come under strain in 1922 when his wife discovered his adultery with her sister, Marguerite, and now broke down acrimoniously, with Brockhurst counter-suing on the grounds of his wife&#x27;s adultery. In August 1939 Brockhurst and Dorette moved to the United States, and he was eventually divorced from his first wife in 1940. He married Kathleen in 1947.

In New York City, Brockhurst became both famous and rich with a series of society portraits but his printmaking output diminished, especially his etchings. He produced a few lithographs at the end of his career (around 1945). In 1951, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member.

In 1958, he appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;, which is viewable on YouTube.

Brockhurst and Dorette settled in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, and Brockhurst died there on 4 May 1978. Kathleen ‘Dorette’ Woodward, died in 1996.
