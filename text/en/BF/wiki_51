<text>William Frank Buckley Jr. (born William Francis Buckley; November 24, 1925 – February 27, 2008) was an American conservative writer, public intellectual, political commentator and novelist.

Born in New York City, Buckley spoke Spanish as his first language before learning French and then English as a child. He served stateside in the United States Army during World War II. Following the war, he attended Yale University, where he engaged in debate and conservative political commentary; he graduated from Yale with honors in 1950. Afterward, he worked at the Central Intelligence Agency for two years.

In 1955, Buckley founded &quot;National Review&quot;, a magazine that stimulated the growth and development of the conservative movement in the United States. In addition to editorials in &quot;National Review&quot;, Buckley wrote &quot;God and Man at Yale&quot; (1951) and more than 50 other books on diverse topics, including writing, speaking, history, politics, and sailing. His works include a series of novels featuring fictitious CIA officer Blackford Oakes and a nationally syndicated newspaper column. In 1965, Buckley ran for mayor of New York City on the Conservative Party line, finishing third. From 1966 to 1999, he hosted 1,429 episodes of the public affairs television show &quot;Firing Line&quot;, the longest-running public affairs show with a single host in U.S. television history; through his work on the show, he became known for his Northeastern elite accent and wide vocabulary. 

Buckley is widely considered to have been one of the most influential figures in the conservative movement in the United States.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
William Frank Buckley Jr. was born William Francis Buckley in New York City on November 24, 1925, to Aloise Josephine Antonia (née Steiner) and lawyer and oil developer William Frank Buckley Sr. (1881–1958). His mother hailed from New Orleans and was of German, Irish, and Swiss-German descent, while his father had Irish ancestry and was born in Texas to Canadian parents from Hamilton, Ontario. He had five older siblings and four younger siblings. 

As a boy, Buckley moved with his family to Mexico before moving to Sharon, Connecticut. He began his formal schooling in France, attending first grade in Paris. By the time Buckley was seven, the family had moved to England, where he received his first formal English-language training at a day school in London. Due to the family&#x27;s varied places of residence, his first and second languages were Spanish and French. As a boy, he developed a love for horses, hunting, music, sailing, and skiing, all of which were reflected in his later writings. He was homeschooled through the eighth grade using the Homeschool Curriculum developed by the Calvert School in Baltimore. Just before World War II, around the ages of 12 and 13, he attended the Jesuit preparatory school St John&#x27;s Beaumont in the English village of Old Windsor.

Buckley&#x27;s father was an oil developer whose wealth was based in Mexico and became influential in Mexican politics during the military dictatorship of Victoriano Huerta, but was expelled when leftist general Álvaro Obregón became president in 1920. Buckley&#x27;s nine siblings included eldest sister Aloise Buckley Heath, a writer and conservative activist; sister Maureen Buckley-O&#x27;Reilly (1933–1964), who married Richardson-Vicks Drugs CEO Gerald A. O&#x27;Reilly; sister Priscilla Buckley, author of &quot;Living It Up with National Review: A Memoir&quot;, for which Buckley wrote the foreword; sister Patricia Buckley Bozell, who was also an author; brother Reid Buckley, an author and founder of the Buckley School of Public Speaking; and brother James L. Buckley, who became a U.S. senator from New York and a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

During the war, Buckley&#x27;s family took in the English historian-to-be Alistair Horne as a child war evacuee. He and Buckley remained lifelong friends. They both attended the Millbrook School in Millbrook, New York, graduating in 1943. Buckley was a member of the American Boys&#x27; Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn (ABCDEF) during Flynn&#x27;s trial for statutory rape in 1943. At Millbrook, Buckley founded and edited the school&#x27;s yearbook, &quot;The Tamarack&quot;; this was his first experience in publishing. When Buckley was a young man, libertarian author Albert Jay Nock was a frequent guest at the Buckley family house in Sharon, Connecticut. William F. Buckley Sr. urged his son to read Nock&#x27;s works, the best-known of which was &quot;Our Enemy, the State&quot;, in which Nock maintained that the founding fathers of the United States, at their Constitutional Convention in 1787, had executed a coup d&#x27;état of the system of government established under the Articles of Confederation.

===Music===
In his youth, Buckley developed many musical talents. He played the harpsichord very well, later calling it &quot;the instrument I love beyond all others&quot;, although he admitted he was not &quot;proficient enough to develop [his] own style&quot;. He was a close friend of harpsichordist Fernando Valenti, who offered to sell Buckley his sixteen-foot pitch harpsichord. Buckley was also an accomplished pianist and appeared once on Marian McPartland&#x27;s National Public Radio show &quot;Piano Jazz&quot;. A great admirer of Johann Sebastian Bach, Buckley wanted Bach&#x27;s music played at his funeral.

===Religion===
Buckley was raised a Catholic and was a member of the Knights of Malta.

The release of his first book, &quot;God and Man at Yale&quot;, in 1951 was met with some specific criticism pertaining to his Catholicism. McGeorge Bundy, dean of Harvard at the time, wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that &quot;it seems strange for any Roman Catholic to undertake to speak for the Yale religious tradition&quot;. Henry Sloane Coffin, a Yale trustee, accused Buckley&#x27;s book of &quot;being distorted by his Roman Catholic point of view&quot; and stated that Buckley &quot;should have attended Fordham or some similar institution&quot;.

In his 1997 book &quot;Nearer, My God&quot;, Buckley condemned what he viewed as &quot;the Supreme Court&#x27;s war against religion in the public school&quot; and argued that Christian faith was being replaced by &quot;another God [...] multiculturalism&quot;. He disapproved of the liturgical reforms following the Second Vatican Council. Buckley was also interested in the writings of the 20th century Italian writer Maria Valtorta.

==Education and military service==
Buckley attended the National Autonomous University of Mexico (or UNAM) until 1943. The next year, upon his graduation from the U.S. Army Officer Candidate School (OCS), he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. In his book &quot;Miles Gone By&quot;, he briefly recounts being a member of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s honor guard upon Roosevelt&#x27;s death. He served stateside throughout the war at Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Gordon, Georgia; and Fort Sam Houston, Texas. After the war ended in 1945, Buckley enrolled at Yale University, where he became a member of the secret Skull and Bones society and was a masterful debater. He was an active member of the Conservative Party of the Yale Political Union, and served as chairman of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; and as an informer for the FBI. At Yale, Buckley studied political science, history, and economics and graduated with honors in 1950. He excelled in the Yale Debate Association; under the tutelage of Yale professor Rollin G. Osterweis, Buckley honed his acerbic style.

==Early career==
Buckley remained at Yale working as a Spanish instructor from 1947 to 1951. 

===Central Intelligence Agency===
Buckley served in the CIA for two years, including one year in Mexico City working on political action for E. Howard Hunt, who was later imprisoned for his part in the Watergate scandal. The two officers remained lifelong friends. In a November 1, 2005, column for &quot;National Review&quot;, Buckley recounted that while he worked for the CIA, the only CIA employee he knew was Hunt, his immediate boss. While stationed in Mexico, Buckley edited &quot;The Road to Yenan&quot;, a book by Peruvian author Eudocio Ravines. After leaving the CIA, he worked as an editor at &quot;The American Mercury&quot; in 1952, but left after perceiving newly emerging antisemitic tendencies in the magazine.

===First books===

====&quot;God and Man at Yale&quot;====
Buckley&#x27;s first book, &quot;God and Man at Yale&quot;, was published in 1951. Offering a critique of Yale University, Buckley argued in the book that the school had strayed from its original mission. One critic viewed the work as miscasting the role of academic freedom. The American academic and commentator McGeorge Bundy, a Yale graduate himself, wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;: &quot;&quot;God and Man at Yale&quot;, written by William F. Buckley, Jr., is a savage attack on that institution as a hotbed of &#x27;atheism&#x27; and &#x27;collectivism.&#x27; I find the book is dishonest in its use of facts, false in its theory, and a discredit to its author.&quot;

Buckley credited the attention the book received to its &quot;Introduction&quot; by John Chamberlain, saying that it &quot;chang[ed] the course of his life&quot; and that the famous &quot;Life&quot; magazine editorial writer had acted out of &quot;reckless generosity&quot;. Buckley was referred to in Richard Condon&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; as &quot;that fascinating younger fellow who had written about men and God at Yale.&quot;

====&quot;McCarthy and His Enemies&quot;====
In 1954, Buckley and his brother-in-law L. Brent Bozell Jr. co-authored a book, &quot;McCarthy and His Enemies&quot;. Bozell worked with Buckley at &quot;The American Mercury&quot; in the early 1950s when it was edited by William Bradford Huie. The book defended Senator Joseph McCarthy as a patriotic crusader against communism, and asserted that &quot;McCarthyism ... is a movement around which men of good will and stern morality can close ranks.&quot; Buckley and Bozell described McCarthy as responding to a communist &quot;ambition to occupy the world&quot;. They conceded that he was often &quot;guilty of exaggeration&quot;, but believed the cause he pursued was just.

==&quot;National Review&quot;==

Buckley founded &quot;National Review&quot; in 1955 at a time when there were few publications devoted to conservative commentary. He served as the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief until 1990. During that time, &quot;National Review&quot; became the standard-bearer of American conservatism, promoting the fusionism of traditional conservatives and libertarians. Examining postwar conservative intellectual history, Kim Phillips-Fein writes:

Buckley sought out intellectuals who were ex-Communists or had once worked on the far Left, including Whittaker Chambers, Willi Schlamm, John Dos Passos, Frank Meyer, and James Burnham, as editors and writers for &quot;National Review&quot;. When Burnham became a senior editor, he urged the adoption of a more pragmatic editorial position that would extend the influence of the magazine toward the political center. Smant (1991) finds that Burnham overcame sometimes heated opposition from other members of the editorial board (including Meyer, Schlamm, William Rickenbacker, and the magazine&#x27;s publisher, William A. Rusher), and had a significant impact on both the magazine&#x27;s editorial policy and the thinking of Buckley himself.

Upon turning 65 in 1990, Buckley retired from the day-to-day running of &quot;National Review&quot;. He relinquished his controlling shares of &quot;National Review&quot; in June 2004 to a pre-selected board of trustees. The next month, he published the memoir &quot;Miles Gone By&quot;. Buckley continued to write his syndicated newspaper column, as well as opinion pieces for &quot;National Review&quot; magazine and &quot;National Review Online&quot;. He remained the ultimate source of authority at the magazine and also conducted lectures and gave interviews.

===Defining the boundaries of conservatism===

Buckley and his editors used &quot;National Review&quot; to define the boundaries of conservatism and to exclude people, ideas, or groups they considered unworthy of the conservative title. For example, Buckley denounced Ayn Rand, the John Birch Society, George Wallace, racists, white supremacists, and antisemites.

When he first met Ayn Rand, according to Buckley, she greeted him with the following: &quot;You are much too intelligent to believe in God.&quot; In turn, Buckley felt that &quot;Rand&#x27;s style, as well as her message, clashed with the conservative ethos&quot;. He decided that Rand&#x27;s hostility to religion made her philosophy unacceptable to his understanding of conservatism. After 1957, he attempted to weed her out of the conservative movement by publishing Whittaker Chambers&#x27;s highly unfavorable review of Rand&#x27;s &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. In 1964, he wrote of &quot;her desiccated philosophy&#x27;s conclusive incompatibility with the conservative&#x27;s emphasis on transcendence, intellectual and moral&quot;, as well as &quot;the incongruity of tone, that hard, schematic, implacable, unyielding, dogmatism that is in itself intrinsically objectionable, whether it comes from the mouth of Ehrenburg, Savonarola—or Ayn Rand.&quot; Other attacks on Rand were penned by Garry Wills and M. Stanton Evans. Nevertheless, historian Jennifer Burns argues, Rand&#x27;s popularity and influence on the right forced Buckley and his circle into a reconsideration of how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with all-out support for capitalism.

In 1962, Buckley denounced Robert W. Welch Jr. and the John Birch Society in &quot;National Review&quot; as &quot;far removed from common sense&quot; and urged the Republican Party to purge itself of Welch&#x27;s influence. He hedged the statement by insisting that among them were &quot;some of the most morally energetic, self-sacrificing, and dedicated anti-Communists in America.&quot;

====On Robert Welch and the John Birch Society====
In 1952, their mutual publisher Henry Regnery introduced Buckley to Welch. Both became editors of political journals, and both had a knack for communication and organization. Welch launched his publication &quot;One Man&#x27;s Opinion&quot; in 1956 (renamed &quot;American Opinion&quot; in 1958), one year after the founding of &quot;The National Review&quot;. Welch twice donated $1,000 to Buckley&#x27;s magazine, and Buckley offered to provide Welch &quot;a little publicity&quot; for his publication. Both believed that the United States suffered from diplomatic and military setbacks during the early years of the Cold War, and both were staunchly anti-communist. But Welch expressed doubts about Eisenhower&#x27;s loyalties in 1957, and the two disagreed on the reasons for the United States&#x27; perceived failure in the Cold War&#x27;s early years. According to Alvin S. Felzenberg, the disagreements between the two blossomed into &quot;a major battle&quot; in 1958. That year, Boris Pasternak won the Nobel Prize in Literature for his novel &quot;Doctor Zhivago.&quot; Buckley was impressed by the novel&#x27;s vivid and depressing depictions of life in a communist society, and believed that the CIA&#x27;s smuggling of the novel into the Soviet Union was an ideological victory. In September 1958, Buckley ran a review of &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; by John Chamberlain. In November 1958, Welch sent Buckley and other associates copies of his unpublished manuscript &quot;The Politician&quot;, which accused Eisenhower and several of Eisenhower&#x27;s appointees of involvement in a communist conspiracy. When Buckley returned the manuscript to Welch, he commented that the allegations were &quot;curiously—almost pathetically optimistic.&quot; On December 9, 1958, Welch founded the John Birch Society with a group of business leaders in Indianapolis. By the end of 1958, Welch had both the organizational and the editorial infrastructure to launch his subsequent far-right political advocacy campaigns.

In 1961, reflecting on his correspondences with Welch and Birchers, Buckley told someone who subscribed to both the &quot;National Review&quot; and the John Birch Society: &quot;I have had more discussions about the John Birch Society in the past year than I have about the existence of God or the financial difficulties of &quot;National&quot; &quot;Review.&quot;&quot;

===Buckley rule===
The Buckley rule states that &quot;National Review&quot; &quot;will support the rightwardmost viable candidate&quot; for a given office. Buckley first stated the rule during the 1964 Republican primary election featuring Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller. The rule is often misquoted and misapplied as proclaiming support for &quot;the rightwardmost electable candidate&quot;, or simply the most electable candidate.

According to &quot;National Review&quot;″s Neal B. Freeman, the Buckley rule meant that &quot;National Review&quot; would support &quot;somebody who saw the world as we did. Somebody who would bring credit to our cause. Somebody who, win or lose, would conservatize the Republican party and the country. It meant somebody like Barry Goldwater.&quot;

===Starr Broadcasting Group===
Buckley was the chairman of Starr Broadcasting Group, a company in which he owned a 20% stake. Peter Starr was the company&#x27;s president, and his brother Michael Starr was executive vice president. In February 1979, the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Buckley and 10 other defendants of defrauding shareholders in Starr Broadcasting Group. As part of a settlement, Buckley agreed to return $1.4 million in stock and cash to shareholders in the company. The other defendants were ordered to contribute $360,000. In 1981, there was another agreement with the SEC.

==Other political commentary and action==

In 1953–1954, long before he founded &quot;Firing Line&quot;, Buckley was an occasional panelist on the conservative public affairs program &quot;Answers for Americans&quot; broadcast on ABC and based on material from the H. L. Hunt–supported publication &quot;Facts Forum&quot;.

===&quot;On the Right&quot;===
Buckley&#x27;s column &quot;On the Right&quot; was syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate beginning in 1962. From the early 1970s, his twice-weekly column was distributed regularly to more than 320 newspapers across the country. He authored 5,600 editions of the column, which totaled to over 4.5 million words.

===&quot;Firing Line&quot;===
For many Americans, Buckley&#x27;s erudition on his weekly PBS show &quot;Firing Line&quot; (1966–1999) was their primary exposure to him and his manner of speech, often with vocabulary common in academia but unusual on television.

===Young Americans for Freedom===
In 1960, Buckley helped form Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). The YAF was guided by principles Buckley called &quot;The Sharon Statement&quot;. Buckley was proud of the successful campaign of his older brother, Jim Buckley, on the Conservative Party ticket to capture the United States Senate seat from New York State held by incumbent Republican Charles Goodell in 1970, giving very generous credit to the activist support of the New York State chapter of YAF. Buckley served one term in the Senate, then was defeated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1976.

===Edgar Smith murder case===
In 1962, Edgar Smith, who had been sentenced to death for the murder of 15-year-old high-school student Victoria Ann Zielinski in New Jersey, began a correspondence with Buckley from death row. As a result of the correspondence, Buckley began to doubt Smith&#x27;s guilt. Buckley later said the case against Smith was &quot;inherently implausible&quot;. An article by Buckley about the case, published in &quot;Esquire&quot; in November 1965, drew national media attention:

Buckley&#x27;s article brought renewed media interest in Hommell, who Smith claimed was the real killer. In 1971, there was a retrial. Smith took a plea deal and was freed from prison that year. Buckley interviewed him on &quot;Firing Line&quot; soon thereafter.

In 1976, five years after being released from prison, Smith attempted to murder another woman, this time in San Diego, California. After witnesses corroborated the story of Lisa Ozbun, who survived being stabbed by Smith, he was sentenced to life in prison. He admitted at the trial that he had in fact also murdered Zielinski. Buckley subsequently expressed great regret at having believed Smith and supported him. Friends of Buckley said he was devastated and blamed himself for what happened.

===Mayoral candidacy===

In 1965, Buckley ran for mayor of New York City as the candidate for the new Conservative Party. He ran to restore momentum to the conservative cause in the wake of Goldwater&#x27;s defeat. He tried to take votes away from the relatively liberal Republican candidate and fellow Yale alumnus John Lindsay, who later became a Democrat. Buckley did not expect to win; when asked what he would do if he won the race, he responded, &quot;Demand a recount.&quot; He used an unusual campaign style. During one televised debate with Lindsay, Buckley declined to use his allotted rebuttal time and instead replied, &quot;I am satisfied to sit back and contemplate my own former eloquence.&quot;

During his campaign, Buckley supported many policies that have been perceived as uniquely and unusually progressive. He supported affirmative action, being one of the first American conservatives to endorse a &quot;kind of special treatment [of African Americans] that might make up for centuries of oppression&quot;. Buckley also espoused welfare reform to emphasize job training, education and daycare. He criticized the administration of drug laws and in judicial sentencing, and promised to crack down on trade unions that discriminated against minorities. This is considered notable, as his political opponents on the left would have resisted anything that alienated trade union-affiliated voters.

To relieve traffic congestion, Buckley proposed charging drivers a fee to enter the central city and creating a network of bike lanes. He opposed a civilian review board for the New York City Police Department, which Lindsay had recently introduced to control police corruption and install community policing. Buckley finished third with 13.4% of the vote, possibly having inadvertently aided Lindsay&#x27;s election by instead taking votes from Democratic candidate Abe Beame.

===Feud with Gore Vidal===
When asked if there was one person with whom Buckley would not share a stage, Buckley&#x27;s response was Gore Vidal. Likewise, Vidal&#x27;s antagonism toward Buckley was well known, even before 1968. Buckley nevertheless appeared in a series of televised debates with Vidal during the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

In their penultimate debate on August 28 of that year, the two disagreed over the actions of the Chicago Police Department and the protesters at the convention. In reference to the response of the police involved in supposedly taking down a Viet Cong flag, moderator Howard K. Smith asked whether raising a Nazi flag during the Second World War would have elicited a similar response. Vidal responded that people were free to state their political views as they saw fit, whereupon Buckley interrupted and noted that people were free to speak their views but others were also free to ostracize them for holding those views, noting that in the US during the Second World War &quot;some people were pro-Nazi and they were well [i.e. correctly] treated by those who ostracized them—and I&#x27;m for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers. I know you [Vidal] don&#x27;t care because you have no sense of identification with—&quot;. Vidal then interjected that &quot;the only sort of pro- or crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself&quot; whereupon Smith interjected, &quot;Now let&#x27;s not call names&quot;. Buckley, visibly angered, rose several inches from his seat and replied, &quot;Now listen, you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I&#x27;ll sock you in your goddamn face, and you&#x27;ll stay plastered.&quot;

Buckley later apologized in print for having called Vidal a &quot;queer&quot; in a burst of anger rather than in a clinical context but also reiterated his distaste for Vidal as an &quot;evangelist for bisexuality&quot;: &quot;The man who in his essays proclaims the normalcy of his affliction, and in his art the desirability of it, is not to be confused with the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher.&quot; The debates are chronicled in the 2015 documentary &quot;Best of Enemies&quot;.

This feud continued the next year in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, which commissioned essays from Buckley and Vidal on the incident. Buckley&#x27;s essay &quot;On Experiencing Gore Vidal&quot; was published in the August 1969 issue. In September, Vidal responded with his own essay, &quot;A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley&quot;. In it Vidal strongly implied that, in 1944, Buckley&#x27;s unnamed siblings and possibly Buckley had vandalized a Protestant church in their Sharon, Connecticut, hometown after the pastor&#x27;s wife sold a house to a Jewish family. He also implied that Buckley was homosexual and a &quot;racist, antiblack, anti-Semitic and a pro-crypto Nazi.&quot; Buckley sued Vidal and &quot;Esquire&quot; for libel; Vidal countersued Buckley for libel, citing Buckley&#x27;s characterization of Vidal&#x27;s novel &quot;Myra Breckenridge&quot; as pornography. After Buckley received an out-of-court settlement from &quot;Esquire&quot;, he dropped the suit against Vidal. Both cases were dropped, with Buckley settling for court costs paid by &quot;Esquire&quot;, which had published the piece, while Vidal, who did not sue the magazine, absorbed his own court costs. Neither paid the other compensation. Buckley also received an editorial apology from &quot;Esquire&quot; as part of the settlement.

The feud was reopened in 2003 when &quot;Esquire&quot; republished the original Vidal essay as part of a collection titled &quot;Esquire&#x27;s Big Book of Great Writing&quot;. After further litigation, &quot;Esquire&quot; agreed to pay $65,000 to Buckley and his attorneys, to destroy every remaining copy of the book that included Vidal&#x27;s essay, to furnish Buckley&#x27;s 1969 essay to anyone who asked for it, and to publish an open letter stating that &quot;Esquire&quot;&#x27;s current management was &quot;not aware of the history of this litigation and greatly [regretted] the re-publication of the libels&quot; in the 2003 collection.

Buckley maintained a philosophical antipathy toward Vidal&#x27;s other , Norman Mailer, calling him &quot;almost unique in his search for notoriety and absolutely unequalled in his co-existence with it.&quot; Meanwhile, Mailer called Buckley a &quot;second-rate intellect incapable of entertaining two serious thoughts in a row.&quot; After Mailer&#x27;s 2007 death, Buckley wrote warmly about their personal acquaintance.

===Associations with liberal politicians===
Buckley became a close friend of liberal Democratic activist Allard K. Lowenstein. He featured Lowenstein on numerous &quot;Firing Line&quot; programs, publicly endorsed his candidacies for Congress, and delivered a eulogy at his funeral.

Buckley was also a friend of economist John Kenneth Galbraith and former senator and presidential candidate George McGovern, both of whom he frequently featured or debated on &quot;Firing Line&quot; and college campuses. He and Galbraith occasionally appeared on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, where host Frank McGee would introduce them and then step aside and defer to their verbal thrusts and parries.

===Amnesty International===
In the late 1960s, Buckley joined the board of directors of Amnesty International USA. He resigned in January 1978 in protest over the organization&#x27;s stance against capital punishment as expressed in its Stockholm Declaration of 1977, which he said would lead to the &quot;inevitable sectarianization of the amnesty movement&quot;.

==Viewpoints==

===Political candidates===
In 1963 and 1964, Buckley mobilized support for the candidacy of Senator Barry Goldwater, first for the Republican nomination against New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and then for the presidency. Buckley used &quot;National Review&quot; as a forum for mobilizing support for Goldwater.In July 1971, Buckley assembled a group of conservatives to discuss some of Richard Nixon&#x27;s domestic and foreign policies that the group opposed. In August 1969, Nixon had proposed and later attempted to enact the Family Assistance Plan (FAP), welfare legislation that would establish a national income floor of $1,600 per year for a family of four. On the international front Nixon negotiated talks with the Soviet Union and initiated relations with China, which Buckley, as a hawk and anti-communist, opposed. The group, known as the Manhattan Twelve, included National Review&#x27;s publisher William A. Rusher and editors James Burnham and Frank Meyer. Other organizations represented were the newspaper &quot;Human Events&quot;, The Conservative Book Club, Young Americans for Freedom, and the American Conservative Union. On July 28, 1971, they published a letter announcing that they would no longer support Nixon. The letter said, &quot;In consideration of his record, the undersigned, who have heretofore generally supported the Nixon Administration, have resolved to suspend our support of the Administration.&quot; Nonetheless, in 1973, the Nixon Administration appointed Buckley as a delegate to the United Nations, about which Buckley later wrote a book.

In 1976, Buckley supported Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign against sitting President Gerald Ford and expressed disappointment at Reagan&#x27;s narrow loss to Ford. In 1981, Buckley informed President-elect Reagan that he would decline any official position offered to him. Reagan jokingly replied that was too bad, because he had wanted to make Buckley ambassador to (then Soviet-occupied) Afghanistan. Buckley later wrote, &quot;When Ronald Reagan offered me the ambassadorship to Afghanistan, I said, &#x27;Yes, but only if you give me fifteen divisions of bodyguards&#x27;.&quot;

In 1988, Buckley organized a committee to campaign against U.S. Senator Lowell Weicker, a liberal Republican. He endorsed Weicker&#x27;s Democratic opponent, Connecticut Attorney General Joseph Lieberman.

===Race and segregation===
In the 1950s and early 1960s, Buckley opposed federal civil rights legislation and expressed support for continued racial segregation in the South. In &quot;Freedom Is Not Enough: The Opening of the American Workplace&quot;, author Nancy MacLean states that &quot;National Review&quot; made James J. Kilpatrick—a prominent supporter of segregation in the South—&quot;its voice on the civil rights movement and the Constitution, as Buckley and Kilpatrick united North and South in a shared vision for the nation that included upholding white supremacy&quot;. In the August 24, 1957, issue of &quot;National Review&quot;, Buckley&#x27;s editorial &quot;Why the South Must Prevail&quot; spoke out explicitly in favor of temporary segregation in the South until &quot;long term equality could be achieved&quot;. Buckley opined that temporary segregation in the South was necessary at the time because the black population lacked the education, economic, and cultural development to make racial equality possible. Buckley claimed that the white South had &quot;the right to impose superior mores for whatever period it takes to effect a genuine cultural equality between the races&quot;. Buckley said white Southerners were &quot;entitled&quot; to disenfranchise black voters &quot;because, for the time being, it is the advanced race.&quot; Buckley characterized blacks as distinctly ignorant: &quot;The great majority of the Negroes of the South who do not vote do not care to vote, and would not know for what to vote if they could.&quot; Two weeks after that editorial was published, another prominent conservative writer, L. Brent Bozell Jr. (Buckley&#x27;s brother-in-law), wrote in the &quot;National Review&quot;: &quot;This magazine has expressed views on the racial question that I consider dead wrong, and capable of doing great hurt to the promotion of conservative causes. There is a law involved, and a Constitution, and the editorial gives White Southerners leave to violate them both in order to keep the Negro politically impotent.&quot;

Buckley visited South Africa in the 1960s on several paid fact-finding missions in which he distributed publications that supported the South African government&#x27;s policy of apartheid. On January 15, 1963, the day after George Wallace, the white supremacist governor of Alabama, made his &quot;Segregation Forever&quot; inaugural address, Buckley published a feature essay in &quot;National Review&quot; on his recent &quot;South African Fortnight&quot;, concluding it with these words concerning apartheid: &quot;I know it is a sincere people&#x27;s effort to fashion the land of peace they want so badly.&quot; In his report, Buckley tried to define apartheid and came up with four axioms on which the policy stands, the fourth being &quot;The notion that the Bantu could participate in power on equal terms with the whites is the worst kind of ideological and social romance&quot;. After publishing this defense of the Hendrik Verwoerd government, Buckley wrote that he was &quot;bursting with pride&quot; over the West German social critic Wilhelm Röpke&#x27;s praise of the piece.

&quot;Politico&quot; indicates that during the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson, Buckley&#x27;s writing grew more accommodating toward the civil rights movement. In his columns, he &quot;ridiculed practices designed to keep African Americans off the voter registration rolls&quot;, &quot;condemned proprietors of commercial establishments who declined service to African Americans in violation of the recently enacted 1964 Civil Rights Act&quot;, and showed &quot;little patience&quot; for &quot;Southern politicians who incited racial violence and race-baited in their campaigns&quot;. According to &quot;Politico&quot;, the turning point for Buckley was when white supremacists set off a bomb in a Birmingham church on September 15, 1963, which resulted in the deaths of four African American girls. A biographer said that Buckley privately wept about it when he found out about the incident.

Buckley disagreed with the concept of structural racism and placed a large amount of blame for lack of economic growth on the black community itself, most prominently during a highly publicized 1965 debate at the Cambridge Union with African American writer James Baldwin, in which Baldwin carried the floor vote 544 to 164. In a 1966 episode of Firing Line with William F. Buckley Jr., &quot;Civil Rights and Foreign Policy&quot;, guest Floyd Bixler McKissick was asked whether black power and other concepts could damage black contributions. McKissick focused in his answer on defining black power: &quot;first of all we mean that black people simply got to determine for themselves the rate of progress, the direction of that progress. And there are six basic ingredients to the accomplishment of black power, and black power is a direction through which you can obtain total equality. And those six points are as follows: One, black people have got to secure for themselves political power. Two, black people have to secure for themselves economic power. Three, black people have got to develop and improve self-image of themselves...Leaving that particular point and going to point four, we&#x27;ll have to develop militant leadership. And five, we seek enforcement of federal laws, the abolishment of police brutality and the abolishment of police-state tactics, as is in the South. And six, and last, what we mean by black power is the building and acquiring of a black consumer block...if we do not have all basic ingredients that we have talked about we&#x27;ll never achieve the road to total equality.&quot; In response to a question about McKissick&#x27;s answer, Buckley said: &quot;I endorse all six of those objectives.&quot; Buckley also opposed the segregationist 1968 presidential candidate George Wallace, debating against Wallace&#x27;s platform on a January 1968 episode of &quot;Firing Line&quot;.

Buckley later said he wished &quot;National Review&quot; had been more supportive of civil rights legislation in the 1960s. He grew to admire Martin Luther King Jr. and supported the creation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Buckley anticipated that the US could elect an African American president within a decade as of the late 1960s and said such an event would be a &quot;welcome tonic for the American soul&quot; that he believed would confer the same social distinction and pride upon African Americans that Catholics had felt upon John F. Kennedy&#x27;s election. In 2004, Buckley told &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;I once believed we could evolve our way up from Jim Crow. I was wrong. Federal intervention was necessary.&quot; The same year, he endeavored to clarify his earlier comments on race, saying, &quot;[T]he point I made about white cultural supremacy was sociological.&quot; Buckley also linked his usage of the word &quot;advancement&quot; to its usage in the name NAACP, saying that the &quot;call for the &#x27;advancement&#x27; of colored people presupposes they are behind. Which they were, in 1958, by any standards of measurement.&quot;

===Opposition to antisemitism===
During the 1950s, Buckley worked to remove antisemitism from the conservative movement and barred antisemites from working for &quot;National Review&quot;.

When Norman Podhoretz demanded that the conservative movement banish paleoconservative columnists Patrick Buchanan and Joseph Sobran, who, according to cultural critic Jeffrey Hart, had promulgated a &quot;a neoisolationist nativism tinged with anti-Semitism&quot;, Buckley would have none of it, and wrote that Buchanan and Sobran (a colleague of Buckley and formerly a senior editor of &quot;National Review&quot;) were not antisemitic but anti-Israel.

In 1991, Buckley wrote a 40,000-word article criticizing Buchanan. He wrote, &quot;I find it impossible to defend Pat Buchanan against the charge that what he did and said during the period under examination amounted to anti-Semitism&quot;, but concluded: &quot;If you ask, do I think Pat Buchanan is an anti-Semite, my answer is he is not one. But I think he&#x27;s said some anti-Semitic things.&quot;

Conservative Roger Scruton wrote: &quot;Buckley used the pages of the National Review to distance conservatism from antisemitism and from any other kind of racial stereotyping. The important goal, for him, was to establish a believable stance towards the modern world, in which all Americans, whatever their race or background, could be included, and which would uphold the religious and social traditions of the American people, as well as the institutions of government as the Founders had conceived them.&quot;

Buckley&#x27;s friendship with Ira Glasser, a Jewish American and former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, features in the 2020 film &quot;Mighty Ira&quot;.

===Foreign policy===
Buckley&#x27;s opposition to communism extended to support for the overthrow and replacement of leftist governments by nondemocratic forces. Buckley admired Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco, who led the rightist military rebellion in its military defeat of the Spanish Republic, and praised him effusively in his magazine, National Review. In his 1957 &quot;Letter From Spain&quot;, Buckley called Franco &quot;an authentic national hero&quot;, who &quot;above others&quot; had the qualities needed to wrest Spain from &quot;the hands of the visionaries, ideologues, Marxists and nihilists&quot; who had been democratically elected. Buckley also wrote: &quot;however preferable Franco is to Indalecio Prieto, or to anarchy, he is not—at least not all by himself—a legitimate governor of Spain...Franco did not, in virtue of his heroism in the thirties, earn the right to govern absolutely in the fifties.&quot; He supported the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, who led the 1973 coup that overthrew Chilean president Salvador Allende&#x27;s democratically elected Marxist government; Buckley called Allende &quot;a president who was defiling the Chilean constitution and waving proudly the banner of his friend and idol, Fidel Castro.&quot; In 2020, the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; uncovered documents that implicated Buckley in a media campaign by the Argentina military junta promoting the regime&#x27;s image while covering up the Dirty War.

Buckley expressed negative views on Africa and critiqued the nationalist movements against Western colonialism occurring in the 1960s. In 1962, he called African nationalism &quot;self-discrediting&quot; and said &quot;the time is bound to come when&quot; Westerners &quot;realize what is the nature of the beast&quot;. In 1961, when asked when Africans would be ready for self-government, he replied, &quot;When they stop eating each other&quot;.

Of the Iraq War, Buckley said, &quot;The reality of the situation is that missions abroad to effect regime change in countries without a bill of rights or democratic tradition are terribly arduous.&quot; He added: &quot;This isn&#x27;t to say that the Iraq war is wrong, or that history will judge it to be wrong. But it is absolutely to say that conservatism implies a certain submission to reality; and this war has an unrealistic frank and is being conscripted by events.&quot; In a February 2006 column published at &quot;National Review Online&quot; and distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, Buckley wrote, &quot;One cannot doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s important that we acknowledge in the inner councils of state that [the war] has failed, so that we should look for opportunities to cope with that failure.&quot;

===Marijuana===
Buckley supported the legalization of marijuana and some other drug legalization as early as his 1965 candidacy for mayor of New York City. But in 1972, he said that while he supported removing criminal penalties for using marijuana, he also supported cracking down on trafficking marijuana. Buckley wrote a pro-marijuana-legalization piece for &quot;National Review&quot; in 2004 in which he called for conservatives to change their views on legalization, writing, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to find someone running for president who advocates reform of those laws. What is required is a genuine republican groundswell. It is happening, but ever so gradually. Two of every five Americans ... believe &#x27;the government should treat marijuana more or less the same way it treats alcohol: It should regulate it, control it, tax it, and make it illegal only for children.

===Gay rights===
Buckley strongly opposed gay marriage, but supported the legalization of homosexual relations.

In a March 18, 1986, &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, Buckley addressed the AIDS epidemic. Calling it &quot;a fact&quot; that AIDS is &quot;the special curse of the homosexual&quot;, he argued that people infected with HIV should marry only if they agreed to sterilization and that universal testing—led by insurance companies, not the government—should be mandatory. Most controversially, he wrote: &quot;Everyone detected with AIDS should be tattooed in the upper forearm, to protect common-needle users, and on the buttocks, to prevent the victimization of other homosexuals.&quot; The piece led to much criticism; some gay activists advocated boycotting Patricia Buckley&#x27;s fundraising efforts for AIDS. Buckley later backtracked from the piece, but in 2004 he told &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;: &quot;If the protocol had been accepted, many who caught the infection unguardedly would be alive. Probably over a million.&quot;

==Language and idiolect==
Buckley was well known for his command of language. He came late to formal instruction in English, not learning it until he was seven years old and having earlier learned Spanish and French. In &quot;Slate&quot;, Michelle Tsai wrote that he spoke English with an idiosyncratic accent between an old-fashioned Northeastern elite accent and British Received Pronunciation, with a Southern drawl. Sociologist Patricia Leavy called it &quot;Buckley&#x27;s High Church, mid-Atlantic accent (taught to actors in the Hollywood studios of the 1930s and 1940s) that was curdled by an ascendant tincture of Southern drawl that softened somewhat the supercilious inflection that very likely was spawned during his education at Yale&quot;.

Professor of political science Gerald L. Houseman wrote that Buckley&#x27;s vaunted love of language did not ensure the quality of his writing, and criticized some of Buckley&#x27;s work for &quot;inappropriate metaphors and inelegant syntax&quot; and for his habit of interjecting in his quotations of others parenthetical references to the &quot;temperament or morals&quot; of those being quoted.

===Rhetorical style===
On &quot;Firing Line&quot;, Buckley had a reputation for being polite to his guests, but also occasionally softly teased his guests if they were friends. Sometimes during heated debates, as with Gore Vidal, Buckley became less polite.

Epstein writes that liberals were especially fascinated by Buckley and often wanted to debate him, in part because his ideas resembled their own: Buckley typically formulated his arguments in reaction to left-liberal opinion rather than founding them on conservative principles alien to liberals.

Appel argues from rhetorical theory that Buckley&#x27;s essays are often written in &quot;low&quot; burlesque in the manner of Samuel Butler&#x27;s satirical poem &quot;Hudibras&quot;. Considered as drama, such discourse features black-and-white disorder, a guilt-mongering logician, distorted clownish opponents, limited scapegoating, and a self-serving redemption.

Lee contends that Buckley introduced a new rhetorical style that conservatives often tried to emulate. The &quot;gladiatorial style&quot;, as Lee calls it, is flashy and combative, filled with sound bites, and leads to inflammatory drama. As conservatives encountered Buckley&#x27;s arguments about government, liberalism and markets, the theatrical appeal of his style inspired conservative imitators, becoming one of the principal templates for conservative rhetoric.

In &quot;Current Affairs&quot;, Nathan J. Robinson wrote of Buckley&#x27;s role as a major conservative intellectual: &quot;Buckley created a template for conservative intellectualism that is still used today: be glib, confident, and a good debater, throw in a dash of wit and some references to the Classics. Do it all with a self-satisfied smile, and the validity or invalidity of your underlying arguments will cease to be a matter of serious discussion.&quot;

===Reception===
George H. Nash, a historian of the modern American conservative movement, said in 2008 that Buckley was &quot;arguably the most important public intellectual in the United States in the past half century. For an entire generation, he was the preeminent voice of American conservatism and its first great ecumenical figure.&quot; Conversely, political consultant Stuart Stevens, who served as a top strategist on Mitt Romney&#x27;s 2012 presidential campaign and later as a leading figure with The Lincoln Project, wrote, &quot;for all his well-crafted sentences and love of language, Buckley was often a more articulate version of the same deep ugliness and bigotry that is the hallmark of Trumpism.&quot;

In the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Douglas Martin wrote: &quot;Mr. Buckley&#x27;s greatest achievement was making conservatism not just electoral Republicanism but conservatism as a system of ideas respectable in liberal post-World War II America. He mobilized the young enthusiasts who helped nominate Barry Goldwater in 1964 and saw his dreams fulfilled when Reagan and the Bushes captured the Oval Office&quot;.

Conservative columnist George Will wrote: &quot;without Bill Buckley, no &quot;National Review&quot;. Without &quot;National Review&quot;, no Goldwater nomination. Without the Goldwater nomination, no conservative takeover of the Republican Party. Without that, no Reagan. Without Reagan, no victory in the Cold War. Therefore, Bill Buckley won the Cold War&quot;. James Carden commented, &quot;Will’s reasoning suffers, as Buckley himself might have put it, from the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.&quot;

==Spy novelist==
In 1975, Buckley recounted being inspired to write a spy novel by Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;: &quot;If I were to write a book of fiction, I&#x27;d like to have a whack at something of that nature.&quot; He went on to explain that he was determined to avoid the moral ambiguity of Graham Greene and John le Carré. Buckley wrote the 1976 spy novel &quot;Saving the Queen&quot;, featuring Blackford Oakes as a rule-bound CIA agent, based in part on his own CIA experiences. Over the next 30 years, he would write another ten novels featuring Oakes. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Charlie Rubin wrote that the series &quot;at its best, evokes John O&#x27;Hara in its precise sense of place amid simmering class hierarchies&quot;. &quot;Stained Glass&quot;, second in the series, won a 1980 National Book Award in the one-year category &quot;Mystery (paperback)&quot;.

Buckley was particularly concerned about the view that what the CIA and the KGB were doing was morally equivalent. He wrote in his memoirs, &quot;To say that the CIA and the KGB engage in similar practices is the equivalent of saying that the man who pushes an old lady into the path of a hurtling bus is not to be distinguished from the man who pushes an old lady out of the path of a hurtling bus: on the grounds that, after all, in both cases someone is pushing old ladies around.&quot;

Buckley began writing on computers in 1982, starting with a Zenith Z-89. According to his son, Buckley developed an almost fanatical loyalty to WordStar, installing it on every new PC he got despite its growing obsolescence over the years. Buckley used it to write his last novel, and when asked why he continued using something so outdated, he answered &quot;They say there&#x27;s better software, but they also say there&#x27;s better alphabets.&quot;

==Later career==

Upon turning 65 in 1990, Buckley retired from the day-to-day running of the &quot;National Review&quot;. The next month, he published the memoir &quot;Miles Gone By&quot;. Buckley continued to write his syndicated newspaper column and opinion pieces for &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;National Review Online&quot;.

In 1991, Buckley received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 

===Views on modern-day conservatism===
Buckley criticized certain aspects of policy within the modern conservative movement. Of George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency, he said, &quot;If you had a European prime minister who experienced what we&#x27;ve experienced it would be expected that he would retire or resign.&quot;

According to Jeffrey Hart, writing in &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, Buckley had a &quot;tragic&quot; view of the Iraq war: he &quot;saw it as a disaster and thought that the conservative movement he had created had in effect committed intellectual suicide by failing to maintain critical distance from the Bush administration ... At the end of his life, Buckley believed the movement he made had destroyed itself by supporting the war in Iraq.&quot; Regarding the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, however, it was noted by the editors of &quot;National Review&quot; that: &quot;Buckley initially opposed the surge, but after seeing its early success believed it deserved more time to work.&quot;

In his December 3, 2007, column, shortly after his wife&#x27;s death, which he attributed, at least in part, to her smoking, Buckley seemed to advocate banning tobacco use in America. Buckley wrote articles for &quot;Playboy&quot;, despite criticizing the magazine and its philosophy. About neoconservatives, he said in 2004: &quot;I think those I know, which is most of them, are bright, informed and idealistic, but that they simply overrate the reach of U.S. power and influence.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1950, Buckley married Patricia Buckley, née Taylor, daughter of Canadian industrialist Austin C. Taylor. He met Taylor, a Protestant from Vancouver, British Columbia, while she was a student at Vassar College. She later became a prominent fundraiser for such charitable organizations as the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at New York University Medical Center, and the Hospital for Special Surgery. She also raised money for Vietnam War veterans. On April 15, 2007, Pat Buckley died at age 80 of an infection after a long illness. After her death, Buckley seemed &quot;dejected and rudderless&quot;, according to friend Christopher Little.

William and Patricia Buckley had one son, author Christopher Buckley. They lived at Wallack&#x27;s Point in Stamford, Connecticut, with a Manhattan duplex apartment at 73 East 73rd Street, a private entrance to 778 Park Avenue in Manhattan.

Beginning in 1970, Buckley and his wife lived and worked in Rougemont, Switzerland, for six to seven weeks per year.

==Death and legacy==
Buckley suffered from emphysema and diabetes in his later years. In a December 2007 column, he commented on the cause of his emphysema, citing his lifelong habit of smoking tobacco despite endorsing a legal ban of it. On February 27, 2008, he died from a heart attack at his home in Stamford, Connecticut, at the age of 82. Initially it was reported that he was found dead at his desk in his study, a converted garage, and his son, Christopher Buckley, said, &quot;He died with his boots on after a lifetime of riding pretty tall in the saddle.&quot; But in his 2009 book &quot;Losing Mum and Pup: A Memoir&quot;, he admitted this account was a slight embellishment on his part; while his father did die in his study, he was found lying on the floor. Buckley was buried at the Saint Bernard Cemetery in Sharon, Connecticut, next to his wife, Patricia.

Notable members of the Republican political establishment paying tribute to Buckley included President George W. Bush, former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, and former First Lady Nancy Reagan. Bush said of Buckley, &quot;He influenced a lot of people, including me. He captured the imagination of a lot of people.&quot; Gingrich added, &quot;Bill Buckley became the indispensable intellectual advocate from whose energy, intelligence, wit, and enthusiasm the best of modern conservatism drew its inspiration and encouragement ... Buckley began what led to Senator Barry Goldwater and his &quot;Conscience of a Conservative&quot; that led to the seizing of power by the conservatives from the moderate establishment within the Republican Party. From that emerged Ronald Reagan.&quot; Reagan&#x27;s widow, Nancy, said, &quot;Ronnie valued Bill&#x27;s counsel throughout his political life, and after Ronnie died, Bill and Pat were there for me in so many ways.&quot; House Minority Whip Roy Blunt stated that &quot;William F. Buckley was more than a journalist or commentator. He was the indisputable leader of the conservative movement that laid the groundwork for the Reagan Revolution. Every Republican owes him a debt of gratitude for his tireless efforts on behalf of our party and nation.&quot;

Various organizations have awards and honors named after Buckley. The Intercollegiate Studies Institute awards the William F. Buckley Award for Outstanding Campus Journalism.

<text>Araba/Álava is a province in the autonomous community of the Basque Country, Spain, that is divided into 51 municipalities. Spanish census, the province is the 37th largest by population with inhabitants but is the 48th largest by land area spanning . Municipalities enjoy a large degree of autonomy in their local administration. Amongst other tasks, they are in charge of urban planning, water supply, lighting, road network, local police and firefighting.

Municipalities are the basic local political division in Spain, and can only belong to one province. The organisation of the municipalities is outlined in a local government law (&quot;Ley 7/1985, de 2 de abril, Reguladora de las Bases del Régimen Local&quot;) passed on 2 April 1985, completed by an 18 April 1986 royal decree. The Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country of 1979 also contains provisions concerning the relations between the municipalities and the autonomous government of the Basque Country. All citizens of Spain are required to register in the municipality in which they reside. Each municipality is a corporation with independent legal personhood: its governing body is called the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; (municipal council or corporation), a term often also used to refer to the municipal offices (city and town halls). The &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; is composed of the mayor (Spanish: &quot;alcalde&quot;), the deputy mayors (&quot;tenientes de alcalde&quot;) and the plenary assembly (&quot;pleno&quot;) of councillors (&quot;concejales&quot;). Municipalities are categorised by population for the purpose of determining the number of &quot;concejales&quot;: three when the population is up to 100 inhabitants, five for 101250, seven for 2511,000, nine for 1,0012,000, eleven for 2,0015,000, thirteen for 5,00110,000, seventeen for 10,00120,000, twenty-one for 20,00150,000 and twenty-five for 50,001100,000. One councillor is added for every additional 100,000 inhabitants, with a further one added when the number of &quot;concejales&quot; based on this methodology would be even in order to prevent tied votes.

The mayor and the deputy mayors are elected by the plenary assembly, which is itself elected by universal suffrage. Elections in municipalities with more than 250 inhabitants are carried out following a proportional representation system with closed lists, whilst those with a population lower than 250 use a block plurality voting system with open lists. The plenary assembly must meet periodically at the seat of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot;, more or less often depending on the population of the municipality: monthly for those whose population is larger than 20,000, once every two months if it ranges between 5,001 and 20,000, and once every three months if it does not exceed 5,000. Many &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; also have a local governing board (Spanish: &quot;junta de gobierno local&quot;), named by the mayor from amongst the councillors—it is required for municipalities of more than 5,000 inhabitants. The &quot;junta de gobierno local&quot;, whose role is to assist the mayor between meetings of the plenary assembly, may not include more than one third of the councillors.

The largest municipality by population in the province of Araba/Álava as of the 2023 Spanish census is Vitoria-Gasteiz, its capital, with 255,423 residents, while the smallest is Añana with 156 residents. The largest municipality by area is also Vitoria-Gasteiz, which spans 276.98 km², while Lapuebla de Labarca is the smallest at 6.05 km².

<text>The Xihu Trough () is a region in the East China Sea, located approximately 400 kilometres east of the cities of Shanghai and Ningbo, Zhejiang. The region is a repository for natural gas, and consists of the Chunxiao, Tianwaitian, Canxue, Duanqiao, and Pinghue fields. The entire trough is approximately 500 kilometres long, and runs parallel to the Chinese coast.

On August 19, 2003, it was announced that Sinopec, CNOOC, Royal Dutch/Shell and Unocal had entered into a joint venture to exploit the gas reserves in the trough, beginning in mid-2005. Gas production was expected to reach 2.5 km3 a year by 2007. However, on September 29, 2004, the two foreign partners in the joint venture, Royal Dutch/Shell and Unocal Corporation, announced their withdrawal citing doubts over the commercial viability of the resources in the area and the territorial dispute.

<text>The naval Battle of Sapienza, also known as the Battle of Porto-Longo or Battle of Zonklon, took place on 4 November 1354, during the Third Genoese–Venetian War.

The Genoese fleet under Paganino Doria captured the Venetian fleet under Niccolò Pisani of 35 galleys and made 5,000 prisoners at the harbour of Sapienza or Porto Longo, between the fortresses of Modon (mod. Methoni) and Navarino or Zonklon (Pylos) in southern Greece.

Genoa and Venice signed a peace treaty on 1 June 1355.

<text>Temple-Inland, Inc. was an American corrugated packaging and building products company. It was acquired by International Paper in 2012.

==History==
Inland Container Corporation was founded by Herman C. Krannert as Anderson Box Company in Anderson, Indiana in 1918. Krannert then founded Inland Box Company in Indianapolis in 1925; this was considered the founding date of the company.

In 1973, Time, Inc. acquired Temple Industries, Inc., merging it with Eastex Pulp and Paper Company to form Temple-Eastex, Inc. Time Inc. had entered the forest products business in 1952 with the purchase of 500,000 acres of timberland in East Texas.
In 1978, Inland was acquired by Time, Inc. in a deal worth about $280 million (). At the time, Inland was manufacturing corrugated shipping containers and container board at 28 plants in the United States and Puerto Rico. It also had 50% ownership, along with Mead paper Co., in Georgia Kraft Co. which produced 1.2 million tons of linerboard in 1977, and which owned 950,000 acres of timberland in the southeast U.S., and leased another 125,000 acres.

In 1983, Temple-Eastex, Inc. and Inland were spun off and combined into Temple-Inland, Inc. At the time, the companies accounted for $1.1 billion () in revenues for Time, equivalent to 32 percent of Time Inc.&#x27;s consolidated revenues of $3.6 billion () in 1982. At the time it was reported that the Joe C. Denman Jr., chief executive of Temple-Eastex, and Clinton G. Ames Jr., chief executive of Inland Container, would continue as the chief executives of the entities under the new Temple-Inland which was headed up by Clifford J. Grum. Grum was executive vice president of Time Inc. and became the chief executive officer of the new company, which was based in Diboll, Texas. Arthur Temple Jr. (1920-2006), who had been president of Temple Industries when Time acquired it and later vice chairman of Time Inc., served as chairman of the board of the spun-off Temple-Inland until 1991. Grum retired in 2000.

In 2002, the company acquired the Gaylord Container Corporation. Gaylord engaged in the integrated production, conversion, and sale of brown paper-packaging products and manufactured corrugated containers, corrugated sheets, and containerboard.

==2007 spin-off==
In November 2007, Temple-Inland announced that it planned to separate itself into three stand-alone public companies and sell its timberlands by the end of 2007. Shareholders in the company would eventually receive stock in all three companies depending on the amount owned on the day the company split up. The three companies were:
*Temple-Inland Inc.
*Guaranty Financial Group Inc.
*Forestar Real Estate Group Inc.

===Temple-Inland Inc.===
Temple-Inland Inc. became a manufacturing company focused on corrugated packaging and building products. The vertically integrated corrugated packaging operation consisted of five linerboard mills, one corrugated medium mill and sixty-four converting facilities. The mills produced 3.5 million tons of containerboard per year and the converting facilities produced 3.6 million tons of corrugated packaging per year. The building products operations manufactured a variety of building products for new home construction, commercial and repair and remodeling markets.

===Guaranty Financial Group Inc.===
Guaranty Financial Group Inc. became a financial services holding company that operated in various business segments through its primary operating subsidiaries, &quot;Guaranty Bank&quot; and &quot;Guaranty Insurance Services, Inc.&quot; Guaranty Bank became a federally chartered savings bank with total assets in excess of $16 billion (consolidated) that conducted consumer and business banking activities through a network of approximately 150 bank branches located in Texas and California that provided commercial banking products and services to various geographic markets throughout the United States. Guaranty Insurance Services, Inc. became an insurance agency that focused on property and casualty insurance with fixed annuities and operated out of 17 offices located in Texas and California, as well as through branches of Guaranty Bank.

In August 2009, Guaranty Bank was closed by the Office of Thrift Supervision, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver. To protect the depositors, the FDIC sold all of the deposits of Guaranty Bank to BBVA Compass of Birmingham, Alabama. At the time of its collapse, the bank had 103 branches in Texas and 59 branches in California.

===Forestar Real Estate Group Inc.===
Forestar Real Estate Group Inc. became a dual business operating company focusing in two business segments: real estate and natural resources. The real estate segment owns directly or through ventures about 374,000 acres of real estate located in nine states and twelve markets in the U.S. The real estate segment has 24 real estate projects representing about 27,000 acres currently in the entitlement process and 75 active development projects in seven states and 11 markets encompassing approximately 17,000 acres. These are 30,000 residential lots and 1,900 commercial acres. The natural resources segment manages about 622,000 net acres of oil and gas mineral interests, sells wood fiber from its land primarily located in Georgia, and leases land for recreational uses.

As of September 30, 2015 Forestar, either directly or through ventures, owned:
*106,000 acres of low basis real estate located in 12 states and 15 markets (approximately)
*9 commercial and residential (multi-family) properties
*590,000 net mineral acres, principally in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and Georgia
*324,000 net mineral acres in oil-rich basins (leasehold interest), including 9,000 net mineral acres in the core of the Bakken and Three Forks formations.
In addition, they manage approximately 95,000 acres of land as timberland, generating fiber growth and sales. They also have approximately 1.5 million acres of water interests in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and Georgia.

==2012 sale==
In 2012, International Paper, through the merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Metal Acquisition Inc. with and into Temple-Inland, acquired Temple-Inland in a deal valued at $4.5 billion. Temple-Inland then became a wholly owned subsidiary of International Paper. At the time of sale, Temple-Inland&#x27;s corrugated packaging operation consisted of 7 mills and 59 converting facilities as well as the building products operation.

==Environmental record==
In 2002, researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Temple–Inland as the 24th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States. Major pollutants reported by the study included acrolein, manganese compounds, sulfuric acid, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde. Temple-Inland did not appear on the 2010 PERI Toxic 100 Air Polluters report.

<doc id="300292" wikidata="Q4812950" url="?curid=300292" title="Ilocos (province)">
<text>Ilocos was a province in northern Luzon, Philippines that comprised the present-day provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, parts of La Union, and Abra. In 1818, the province was disestablshed when it was split into Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur through a royal decree due to rapid population growth.

==Etymology==
Ilocos is derived from &quot;Ylokos&quot;, the pre-Hispanic name for the coastal plains stretching from Bangui in the north to Namacpacan in the south. It is also derived from the Spanish words &quot;y-looc&quot;, which translates to &quot;from the coves&quot; or coastal bays or &quot;looc&quot;/&quot;look&quot; where inhabitants had built settlements. When Spanish explorer Juan de Salcedo arrived in present-day Vigan on June 13, 1572, he observed the area&#x27;s natural coves and named the region &quot;Ylocos&quot; and its people &quot;Ylocanos&quot;.

==History==
In 1571, after gaining control over Manila, Spanish conquistadors led by Juan de Salcedo ventured northward with eight armed boats and a small force of 45 men. Salcedo landed in present-day Vigan in 1572 and traveled through present-day Laoag, Currimao, and Badoc, encountering indigenous communities settled in sheltered coves, or &quot;looc&quot;, and naming the area Ylokos after these coastal inhabitants. 

Initially administered as part of an &quot;encomienda&quot;, the Spanish established Christian missions and governmental institutions across Ilocos to convert the native population to Catholicism. Augustinian missionaries built enduring churches and parishes, and Vigan later became the diocesan seat of Nueva Segovia. It also had 10,041 Chinese Filipino families. However, the Spanish faced resistance due to abusive colonial practices, triggering notable uprisings, including the Dingras uprising (1589), Pedro Almazan revolt (1660), the Diego and Gabriela Silang Revolt (1762–1763), and the Basi Revolt (1807). In 1762, the province became part of the independent Free Ilocos state, when Diego Silang declared liberation from Spanish rule, which then momentarily lost control due to the British occupation of Manila. It was later disestablished upon Silang&#x27;s assassination in 1763.

On February 2, 1818, the province was split into Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur by the promulgation of a royal decree due to rapid population growth.

<doc id="300295" wikidata="Q421748" url="?curid=300295" title="Dichloromethane">
<text>Dichloromethane (DCM, methylene chloride, or methylene bichloride) is an organochlorine compound with the formula . This colorless, volatile liquid with a chloroform-like, sweet odor is widely used as a solvent. Although it is not miscible with water, it is slightly polar, and miscible with many organic solvents.

==Occurrence==
Natural sources of dichloromethane include oceanic sources, macroalgae, wetlands, and volcanoes. However, the majority of dichloromethane in the environment is the result of industrial emissions.

==Production==
DCM is produced by treating either chloromethane or methane with chlorine gas at 400–500 °C. At these temperatures, both methane and chloromethane undergo a series of reactions producing progressively more chlorinated products. In this way, an estimated 400,000 tons were produced in the US, Europe, and Japan in 1993.
:
:
The output of these processes is a mixture of chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride as well as hydrogen chloride as a byproduct. These compounds are separated by distillation.

DCM was first prepared in 1839 by the French chemist Henri Victor Regnault (1810–1878), who isolated it from a mixture of chloromethane and chlorine that had been exposed to sunlight.

==Uses==
DCM&#x27;s volatility and ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds makes it a useful solvent for many chemical processes. In the food industry, it is used to decaffeinate coffee and tea as well as to prepare extracts of hops and other flavourings. Its volatility has led to its use as an aerosol spray propellant and as a blowing agent for polyurethane foams.

===Specialized uses===

The chemical compound&#x27;s low boiling point allows the chemical to function in a heat engine that can extract mechanical energy from small temperature differences. An example of a DCM heat engine is the drinking bird. The toy works at room temperature. It is also used as the fluid in jukebox displays and holiday bubble lights that have a colored bubbling tube above a lamp as a source of heat and a small amount of rock salt to provide thermal mass and a nucleation site for the phase changing solvent.

DCM chemically welds certain plastics. For example, it is used to seal the casing of electric meters. Often sold as a main component of plastic welding adhesives, it is also used extensively by model building hobbyists for joining plastic components together. It is commonly referred to as &quot;Di-clo&quot;.

It is used in the garment printing industry for removal of heat-sealed garment transfers.

DCM is used in the material testing field of civil engineering; specifically it is used during the testing of bituminous materials as a solvent to separate the binder from the aggregate of an asphalt or macadam to allow the testing of the materials.

Dichloromethane extract of &quot;Asparagopsis taxiformis&quot;, a seaweed fodder for cattle, has been found to reduce their methane emissions by 79%.

It has been used as the principal component of various paint and lacquer strippers, although its use is now restricted in the EU and many such products now use benzyl alcohol as a safer alternative.

==Chemical reactions==
Dichloromethane is widely used as a solvent in part because it is relatively inert. It does participate in reactions with certain strong nucleophiles however. Tert-butyllithium deprotonates DCM:
Methyllithium reacts with methylene chloride to give chlorocarbene:

Although DCM is a common solvent in organic chemistry laboratories and is commonly assumed to be inert, it does react with some amines and triazoles. Tertiary amines can react with DCM to form quaternary chloromethyl chloride salts via the Menshutkin reaction. Secondary amines can react with DCM to yield an equilibrium of iminium chlorides and chloromethyl chlorides, which can react with a second equivalent of the secondary amine to form aminals. At increased temperatures, pyridines including DMAP, react with DCM to form methylene bispyridinium dichlorides. Hydroxybenzotriazole and related reagents used in peptide coupling react with DCM in the presence of triethylamine, forming acetals.

==Toxicity==
Serious health risks are associated with DCM, despite being one of the least toxic simple chlorohydrocarbons. Its high volatility makes it an inhalation hazard. It can also be absorbed through the skin. 
Symptoms of acute overexposure to dichloromethane via inhalation include difficulty concentrating, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches, numbness, weakness, and irritation of the upper respiratory tract and eyes. More severe consequences can include suffocation, loss of consciousness, coma, and death.

DCM is also metabolized to carbon monoxide potentially leading to carbon monoxide poisoning. Acute exposure by inhalation has resulted in optic neuropathy and hepatitis. Prolonged skin contact can result in DCM dissolving some of the fatty tissues in skin, resulting in skin irritation or chemical burns.

It may be carcinogenic, as it has been linked to cancer of the lungs, liver, and pancreas in laboratory animals. Other animal studies showed breast cancer and salivary gland cancer. Research is not yet clear as to what levels may be carcinogenic to humans. DCM crosses the placenta but fetal toxicity in women who are exposed to it during pregnancy has not been proven. In animal experiments, it was fetotoxic at doses that were maternally toxic but no teratogenic effects were seen.

In people with pre-existing heart problems, exposure to DCM can cause abnormal heart rhythms and/or heart attacks, sometimes without any other symptoms of overexposure. People with existing liver, nervous system, or skin problems may worsen after exposure to methylene chloride.

===Regulation===
In many countries, products containing DCM must carry labels warning of its health risks. Concerns about its health effects have led to a search for alternatives in many of its applications.

In the European Union, the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values (SCOEL) recommends an occupational exposure limit for DCM of 100 ppm (8-hour time-weighted average) and a short-term exposure limit of 200 ppm for a 15-minute period. The European Parliament voted in 2009 to ban the use of DCM in paint-strippers for consumers and many professionals, with the ban taking effect in December 2010.

In February 2013, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health warned that at least 14 bathtub refinishers have died since 2000 from DCM exposure. These workers had been working alone, in poorly ventilated bathrooms, with inadequate or no respiratory protection, and no training about the hazards of DCM. OSHA has since then issued a DCM standard.

On March 15, 2019, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule to prohibit the manufacture (including importing and exporting), processing, and distribution of DCM in all paint removers for consumer use, effective in 180 days. However, it does not affect other products containing DCM, including many consumer products not intended for paint removal. On April 20, 2023, the EPA proposed a widespread ban on the production of DCM with some exceptions for military and industrial uses. On April 30, 2024, the EPA finalized a ban on most commercial uses of DCM, which mainly banned its application for stripping paint and degreasing surfaces but allowed for some remaining commercial applications, such as chemical production.

==Environmental effects==
Dichloromethane is not classified as an ozone-depleting substance by the Montreal Protocol. The US Clean Air Act does not regulate dichloromethane as an ozone depleter. Dichloromethane has been classified as a very short-lived substance (VSLS). Despite their short atmospheric lifetimes of less than 0.5 year, VSLSs can contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion, particularly if emitted in regions where rapid transport to the stratosphere occurs. Atmospheric abundances of dichloromethane have been increasing in recent years.

<text>College rock is rock music played on student-run university and college campus radio stations located in the United States and Canada in the 1980s and 1990s. The stations&#x27; playlists were often created by students who avoided the mainstream rock played on commercial radio stations.

==Characteristics==
An outgrowth of hardcore punk, college rock originated less as a genre term and more as a signal of the medium -- college radio -- by which college rock acts were often heard. As a result, the genre featured a high degree of diversity and eclecticism, meaning that &quot;on college radio ... screaming noise, retro country, avant-garde electronics, and power pop could coexist, linked by cheap-sounding singles recorded by local bands.&quot; Acknowledging this variety, some common aesthetics among college rock bands do exist, with some writers characterizing it largely as a combination of the experimentation of post-punk and new wave with a more melodic pop style and an underground sensibility. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; explained, &quot;Though hardly uniform in style, there were commonalities between the college-rock acts. Not really punk, hard rock, or art rock, most of these groups played conventionally hooky songs, heavy on jangle and twang, with lyrics steeped in poetic Americana.&quot;

==History==

College rock was an outgrowth of the new wave and post-punk musical scenes that developed in the late 1970s. Though not as avant-garde as post-punk or abrasive as hardcore punk, the genre tended to veer further from the synth-heavy mainstream. As explained by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, college rock&#x27;s origins can be placed in Athens, Georgia, home of the University of Georgia and several college rock bands, such as R.E.M. The genre would expand to include a diverse array of regional scenes in several cities throughout the United States, particularly Minneapolis, home of the Replacements and Hüsker Dü, and Boston, home of Pixies and Throwing Muses. The genre also came to include several British alternative acts who incorporated elements of jangle pop or post-punk romanticism in their music, with bands such as the Smiths, the Cure, and the La&#x27;s achieving success on American college radio stations.

Key to the success of college rock was the success of college radio stations throughout the United States. In &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Ian Svenonius attributed the proliferation of college rock stations to the FCC&#x27;s decision to issue radio licenses to universities during the 1960s:

Many college radio stations during this period sought to promote music that went against the commercial style of the 1980s. Svenonius characterized these stations as being &quot;staffed by music enthusiasts who worked without pay, and who saw college rock as a desperately needed alternative to the platinum tedium of &#x27;classic&#x27; and Top 40 drivel.&quot; Reflecting the erudite tastes of these students, college rock programs were generally less militant and blunt than punk, but often featured a degree of activist sensibility. In contrast with many indie and punk bands, college rock acts often signed to major labels, albeit without becoming flagship acts for their record companies.

Other mediums began tracking college rock during this period. The &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot;, a publication that reported on the scene, created a chart which measured popularity of artists played on college radio. The journal&#x27;s charts were used by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and other media. In September 1988, &quot;Billboard&quot; introduced the Modern Rock Tracks chart which monitored airplay on modern rock and college radio stations. &quot;120 Minutes&quot; began on MTV as a program to feature music of the college rock style and compilations branded with the &quot;120 Minutes&quot; name were released and featured several college rock bands.

By the early 1990s, college rock as a genre had been surpassed by grunge and indie rock in the alternative sphere. Svenonius points to NPR&#x27;s aggressive campaign against left of the dial college stations as a cause: seeking to remove competition in this airspace, NPR reduced many college stations to closed circuit formats, if the stations were continued at all. Many remaining stations reformatted to capture the more abrasive styles of indie rock. Many 1980s college radio music directors went on to pursue successful careers in the mainstream American music industry.

==Notable examples==
American artists came from a variety of regions, with many succeeding in college towns. Spurred by the success of bands such as R.E.M., the Athens, Georgia area became a hotbed of college rock, with acts such as Let&#x27;s Active and Don Dixon achieving success. Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota spawned a large contingent of college rock acts, including the Replacements, Hüsker Dü, the Suburbs, and Soul Asylum. Boston, home to several American universities, was also a hotspot for college rock, with bands such as Pixies, Dinosaur Jr., Throwing Muses, and the Del Fuegos building a following. Though these cities were major hubs, college rock acts proliferated throughout the US, from areas ranging from California (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Camper Van Beethoven) to New Jersey (the Smithereens, Dramarama).

Although not considered college rock bands in their native country, several UK-based acts also achieved success on the college rock circuit. Many of these acts, including the Smiths, the Cure and the La&#x27;s, grew out of the UK&#x27;s alternative scene and achieved greater mainstream success there. Other acts, such as Elvis Costello and Graham Parker, grew out of the British initial new wave scene and transitioned to the underground college circuits during the 1980s.

Similarly, Australian acts such as the Hoodoo Gurus and Midnight Oil appeared in college rock circles in the US.

<text>Utagawa Kunisada (; 1786 – 12 January 1865), also known as Utagawa Toyokuni III (, ), was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist. He is considered the most popular, prolific and commercially successful designer of ukiyo-e woodblock prints in 19th-century Japan. In his own time, his reputation far exceeded that of his contemporaries, Hokusai, Hiroshige and Kuniyoshi.

==Evaluation of Kunisada in art history==
At the end of the Edo period (1603–1867), Hiroshige, Kuniyoshi and Kunisada were the three best representatives of the Japanese color woodcut in Edo (capital city of Japan, now Tokyo). However, among European and American collectors of Japanese prints, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century, all three of these artists were actually regarded as rather inferior to the greats of classical ukiyo-e, and therefore as having contributed considerably to the downfall of their art. For this reason, some referred to their works as &quot;decadent&quot;.

Beginning in the 1930s and 1970s, respectively, the works of Hiroshige and Kuniyoshi were submitted to a re-evaluation, and these two are now counted among the masters of their art. Thus, from Kunisada alone was withheld, for a long time, the acknowledgment which is due to him. With a few exceptions, such as actor portraits (&quot;yakusha-e&quot;) and portraits of beautiful women (&quot;bijin-ga&quot;), at the beginning of his career, and some series of large-size actor head-portraits near the end, it was thought that he had produced only inferior works. It was not until the early 1990s, with the appearance of Jan van Doesburg&#x27;s overview of the artistic development of Kunisada, and Sebastian Izzard&#x27;s extensive study of his work, that this picture began to change, with Kunisada more clearly revealed as one of the &quot;giants&quot; of the Japanese print that he was.

==Biography==
Although not much is known of the details of Kunisada&#x27;s life, there are some well-established records of particular events. He was born in 1786 in Honjo, an eastern district of Edo. His given name was Sumida Shōgorō IX (角田庄五朗), and he was also called Sumida Shōzō (角田庄蔵). A small licensed and hereditary ferry-boat service belonged to his family, and the income derived from this business provided a certain basic financial security to engage in leisure activities such as painting. His father, who was an amateur poet of some renown, died in the year after his birth. While growing up, he developed an early talent for painting and drawing. His early sketches at that time impressed Toyokuni, the great master of the Utagawa school and prominent designer of kabuki and actor-portrait prints. In the year 1800 or shortly thereafter Kunisada was accepted by Toyokuni I as an apprentice in his workshop. In keeping with a tradition of Japanese master-apprentice relations, he was then given the official artist name of &quot;KUNI-sada&quot;, the first character of which was derived from the second part of the name &quot;Toyo-KUNI&quot;.

His first known print dates to the year 1807. However this seems to have been an exceptional design, and further full-sized prints appear starting only in 1809–1810. As of 1808 he had already begun work as an illustrator of &quot;e-hon&quot; (woodblock print illustrated books) and his popularity rapidly increased. In 1809 he was referred to in contemporary sources as the &quot;star attraction&quot; of the Utagawa school, and soon thereafter was considered as at least equal to his teacher Toyokuni in the area of book illustration. Kunisada&#x27;s first actor portraits appeared in either 1808 or 1809. It is known that his first &quot;bijin-ga&quot; series and a series of pentaptychs of urban scenes of Edo, appear simultaneously in 1809. By 1813 he had risen as a &quot;star&quot; in the constellation of Edo&#x27;s artistic world; a contemporary list of the most important ukiyo-e artists places him in second place behind Toyokuni I. Kunisada remained one of the &quot;trendsetters&quot; of the Japanese woodblock print until his death in early 1865.

Beginning around 1810 Kunisada used the studio name &quot;Gototei&quot;, which refers cryptically to his father&#x27;s ferry-boat business. Until 1842 this signature appeared on nearly all of his kabuki designs. Around 1825 the studio name &quot;Kochoro&quot; appeared, and was often used on prints not related to kabuki. This name was derived from a combination of the pseudonyms of master painter Hanabusa Itcho, and that of his successor Hanabusa Ikkei, with whom Kunisada had studied a new style of painting around 1824–1825. In 1844, he finally adopted the name of his master Toyokuni I, and for a brief time used the signature &quot;Kunisada becoming Toyokuni II&quot;. Starting in 1844–1845, all of his prints are signed &quot;Toyokuni&quot;, partially with the addition of other studio names as prefixes, such as &quot;Kochoro&quot; and &quot;Ichiyosai&quot;. Although Kunisada referred to himself as &quot;Toyokuni II&quot;, he must be regarded, however, as &quot;Toyokuni III&quot;. The question is unsettled as to why he intentionally ignored Toyoshige, a pupil and son-in-law of Toyokuni I and who had borne the name &quot;Toyokuni&quot;, as legitimate head of the Utagawa school, from 1825 until his own death in 1835. Towards the end of his life he began recording his age with his signature on his prints. 

The date of Kunisada&#x27;s death was the 15th day of the 12th month of the First Year of Genji. Most sources erroneously report this as having been in the year 1864, though this date in the Japanese calendar corresponds to the date January 12, 1865, in the Gregorian calendar. Kunisada died in the same neighborhood in which he had been born.

==Artistic activity==
Almost from the first day of his activity, and even at the time of his death in 1865, Kunisada was a trendsetter in the art of the Japanese woodblock print. Always at the vanguard of his time, and in tune with the tastes of the public, he continuously developed his style, which was sometimes radically changed, and did not adhere to stylistic constraints set by any of his contemporaries. His productivity was extraordinary. About 14,500 individual designs have been catalogued (polyptych sets counted as a single design) corresponding to more than 22,500 individual sheets. It seems probable based on these figures that Kunisada actually produced between 20,000 and 25,000 designs for woodblock prints during his lifetime (i.e. 35,000 to 40,000 individual sheets). 

Following the traditional pattern of the Utagawa school, Kunisada&#x27;s main occupation was kabuki and actor prints, and about 60% of his designs fall in this category. However he was also highly active in the area of &quot;bijin-ga&quot; prints (comprising about 15% of his complete works), and their total number was far higher than any other artist of his time.
From 1820 to 1860 he likewise dominated the market for portraits of sumo wrestlers. For a long time (1835–1850) he had an almost complete monopoly on the genre of prints related to &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;; it was only after 1850 that other artists began to produce similar designs. Noteworthy also are the number of his &quot;surimono&quot;, and although they were designed almost exclusively prior to 1844, few artists were better-known in this area.

Kunisada&#x27;s paintings, which were privately commissioned, are little-known, but can be compared to those of other masters of ukiyoe painting. His activity as a book illustrator is also largely unexplored. He was no less productive in the area of ehon than he was in full-sized prints, and notable among his book prints are &quot;shunga&quot; pictures, which appeared in numerous books. Due to censorship, they are signed only on the title page with his alias &quot;Matahei&quot;. Landscape prints and &quot;musha-e&quot; (samurai warrior prints) by Kunisada are rare, and only about 100 designs in each of these genres are known. He effectively left these two fields to be covered by his contemporaries Hiroshige and Kuniyoshi, respectively.

The mid-1840s and early 1850s, were a period of expansion when woodblock prints were in high demand in Japan. During this time Kunisada collaborated with one of or both Hiroshige and Kuniyoshi in three major series as well as on a number of smaller projects. This co-operation was in large part politically motivated in order to demonstrate solidarity against the intensified censorship regulations of the Tenpō Reforms. Also beginning around the mid-1850s there are series in which individual parts of designs (and sometimes complete sheets) are signed by Kunisada&#x27;s students; this was done with the intention of promoting their work as individual artists. Notable students of Kunisada included Toyohara Kunichika, Utagawa Sadahide and Utagawa Kunisada II.
The majority of Kunisada&#x27;s work was of actors portrayed in current popular plays; most of the rest was of women in the latest fashions. The works dated with quickly-changing fashions, and there was a constant demand for new prints to replace the outdated ones.

==Reception and legacy==

Kunisada had a five-decade prominent career, during which his work was always phenomenally popular and sold in the thousands, letting him become the all-time bestselling designer of Japanese woodblock prints. A well-known anecdote recorded in &quot;Biographies of the Utagawa School Artists&quot; by Iijima Kyoshin, written beginning of the 1890s, relates that the young Kuniyoshi, having languished for years as an artist, once observed Kunisada, ten years older and already an enormously popular artist, dressed in rich clothes and heartily enjoying himself with a beautiful geisha along the roads in Edo. Spurred by envy, Kuniyoshi vowed to renew devotion to his art and later achieved the success he craved. Kunisada was so famous that, in order to help his friend Hiroshige promote the first edition of the Tokaido, he designed his own series of &quot;The fifty-three stations of the Tokaido&quot;, adding a half-length figure to the foreground of each of Hiroshige&#x27;s landscapes.

Early 20th-century critics have been reluctant to declare merit in his work, particularly of the later period. An example of the contempt early Western critics subjected Kunisada&#x27;s work to:

It is only with the 1990s that Kunisada&#x27;s work re-gained widespread appreciation. Nowadays, Kunisada is again well-regarded as one of the main masters of the ukiyo-e art:

<text>Slint was an American rock band from Louisville, Kentucky, formed in 1986, after the dissolution of two local bands, Squirrel Bait and Maurice. The band consisted of Brian McMahan (guitar, vocals), David Pajo (guitar), Britt Walford (drums, vocals), Todd Brashear (bassist on &quot;Spiderland&quot;), and Ethan Buckler (bassist on &quot;Tweez&quot;). Though little known during their original run, they have retrospectively gained a cult following and critical acclaim as one of the pioneers of post-rock and math rock.

Their debut album &quot;Tweez&quot; was recorded by Steve Albini and released in 1989 on the group&#x27;s self-owned record label Jennifer Hartman Records and Tapes. Buckler left the band out of dissatisfaction with &quot;Tweez&quot;, and was replaced with Todd Brashear. 
In 1991, the band released their second album &quot;Spiderland&quot;, on the independent label Touch and Go Records. The band broke up prior to the album&#x27;s release, contributing to its initial obscurity. The album would begin to garner a cult following after its release, and eventually would become regarded as one of the most acclaimed albums of the 1990s.

After they broke up, Touch and Go records released an untitled extended play (EP) commonly referred to as &quot;Slint&quot;, recorded before their debut was released. After sporadic reunions, Slint officially disbanded once more in 2014.

==History==
===Pre-Slint===
Walford and McMahan met in their pre-teens and attended the Brown School, a Louisville public school founded on a pedagogy of self-directed learning. They began performing music together at an early age, forming the Languid and Flaccid with Ned Oldham (later of The Anomoanon) while still in middle school. In their teens Walford and McMahan played together in the seminal Louisville punk band Squirrel Bait. Walford left the band following their first recording session while McMahan went on to tour and record Squirrel Bait&#x27;s two albums before the band&#x27;s dissolution in 1987.

Pajo and Walford (and, briefly, McMahan) were in the punk/prog-metal band Maurice with future members of Kinghorse. After being influenced by the music of the Minutemen, Pajo and Walford&#x27;s musical direction became too obtuse for the other members of Maurice, who parted ways. Maurice&#x27;s later material would form the basis of some of Slint&#x27;s early compositions.

=== 1986–1989: Founding, Recording of &quot;Tweez&quot;, and Ethan Buckler&#x27;s departure ===
Slint formed in the summer of 1986. Walford and Pajo were joined by the slightly older Buckler (age 18 at the time) for a show for a Unitarian Universalist congregation on November 2; performing under the name Small Tight Dirty Tufts of Hair, most of the congregation left during the band&#x27;s first two songs. They were soon joined by McMahan and named themselves Slint after one of Walford&#x27;s pet fish.

Slint&#x27;s first album, &quot;Tweez&quot;, was recorded in the fall of 1987 by Steve Albini, whom the band had chosen because they were fans of Albini&#x27;s recently defunct group Big Black. Though Slint&#x27;s members had composed the album&#x27;s music during rehearsals in Walford&#x27;s parents&#x27; basement, most of the lyrics were created in-studio, and included between-song sound effects and ad-libbed conversations with Albini. During mixdown, Walford requested that Albini &quot;make the bass drum sound like a ham being slapped by a catcher&#x27;s mitt,&quot; and then spilled a cup of tea on Albini&#x27;s mixing board. Without formal song titles, eight of the album&#x27;s tracks were named for the band members&#x27; parents, and a ninth for Walford&#x27;s dog, Rhoda. Once completed, Buckler was dissatisfied with the recordings and left Slint to form the group King Kong, initially made up of all of Slint&#x27;s members taking up different instruments. All of Slint&#x27;s original members recorded the single &quot;Movie Star&quot; as King Kong in Steve Albini&#x27;s studio while he was away on a trip in 1989.

=== 1988–1990: Todd Brashear joins, release of &quot;Tweez&quot; ===

Buckler was soon replaced by bass player Todd Brashear. Slint had hoped that Touch and Go Records would release &quot;Tweez&quot;, but the band did not hear back from the label. A friend of the group, Jennifer Hartman, paid for the album&#x27;s release for a tiny run on the imprint Jennifer Hartman Records in 1989. By then the group had returned to the studio with Albini to record two instrumental tracks. Original copies of &quot;Tweez&quot; included a flyer advertising a 12&quot; single of these songs to be released on Jennifer Hartman. But by now, the band had succeeded in catching the ear of Touch &amp; Go Records&#x27;s founder Corey Rusk who agreed to release the group&#x27;s next album. The master tapes to the proposed 12&quot; were then shelved, making &quot;Tweez&quot; the sole release on the Jennifer Hartman label.

By the time &quot;Tweez&quot; was released, most of the group had gone off to college and would return to Louisville during breaks to write and practice new material. Returning to the Walfords&#x27; basement, the group would spend hours repeating the same guitar riff and then adding in layers of nuance on top of it. After rehearsals, McMahan took practice tapes home and worked on vocals with the use of a 4-track tape recorder. Sitting in his parents&#x27; car made it possible to record softly spoken vocals over the band&#x27;s loud music. After developing these new songs, Slint&#x27;s members wanted a cleaner sound than that of their first LP, so they approached Minneapolis producer Brian Paulson who had recorded two albums with McMahan&#x27;s former bandmates&#x27; group Bastro. On a trip to visit Bastro and Paulson during the recording sessions for their final studio album, &quot;Sing the Troubled Beast&quot;, McMahan was in a near-fatal car accident. While in the ambulance, a paramedic called in &quot;Code 138&quot; and the immobilized McMahan regained consciousness singing the Misfits song &quot;We Are 138&quot;. McMahan&#x27;s brush with death left him feeling depressed, which affected the recording and aftermath of Slint&#x27;s next album.

=== 1991: &quot;Spiderland&quot; and dissolution ===
Paulson and Slint met over a weekend to record &quot;Spiderland&quot; in Chicago. It was recorded live, with vocals overdubbed in no more than two takes and with little to no rehearsal on the part of McMahan. The group used two different microphones to record vocals: one for softer, spoken voices, and one for louder, sung voices. During mixdown, Paulson and the group tried adding different effects, but all these were rejected, resulting in a very pared-down production sound. The day after &quot;Spiderland&quot;″s recording session ended, McMahan checked himself into a mental hospital where he was diagnosed with depression, and left the band a few months later. 

Will Oldham, a longtime friend of the band, took numerous photos of the group as potential album covers. Some were taken in a nearby quarry and one was chosen with Slint&#x27;s four members&#x27; heads bobbing above the surface of the water. Touch and Go released &quot;Spiderland&quot; in 1991. The album was unlike anything else that the label had released to date. Slint was to have gone on a European tour after its release, but with the band no longer together, there were no tours, interviews, photo or video shoots to promote the album. Despite this, the album&#x27;s repute grew and it continued to sell several thousand copies annually in the years following its release--a considerable feat for an indie record by a defunct group--and a mystique around the record, and the artists who made it, began to grow.

&quot;Spiderland&quot; is considered a seminal work, characterized by dark, syncopated rhythms, sparse guitar lines and haunting subject matter. The record&#x27;s impact was such that many fans and critics have come to consider it a foundational post-rock album. &quot;Spiderland&quot; included an address seeking a female vocalist; the English songwriter PJ Harvey was among the applicants.

===1992–present: reunions and reissues===
The band briefly reformed in 1992, and again in 1994. During this time, Touch and Go Records reissued &quot;Tweez&quot; in 1993, and in 1994 an untitled 10&quot; EP of the two songs from the shelved tapes recorded between their two albums—one a reinterpretation of &quot;Rhoda&quot; from &quot;Tweez&quot;, and the other a track called &quot;Glenn&quot;.

Members of Slint have since appeared in a number of bands. Pajo has been a member of Dead Child, Tortoise, Palace, The For Carnation, Household Gods, the short-lived Billy Corgan-fronted rock band Zwan, and as of 2021, Gang of Four. In 2009, he performed with Yeah Yeah Yeahs as a live back-up musician. He briefly played in Stereolab, took up bass in Interpol, and performs under the moniker PAJO and occasionally with his band Papa M, also known as Aerial M, or just M. Guitarist Brian McMahan formed The For Carnation in 1994 and also played with Will Oldham in Palace. Britt Walford played drums in Evergreen, and for The Breeders under the pseudonym Shannon Doughton on the album &quot;Pod&quot;, and as Mike Hunt on the &quot;Safari&quot; EP. Ethan Buckler has released several albums with his group King Kong featuring an ever-shifting cast of members who have occasionally included David Pajo.

Nearly fifteen years after originally disbanding, three members of Slint—Brian McMahan, David Pajo, and Britt Walford—reunited to curate the 2005 All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties (ATP) music festival in Camber Sands, England. Also in 2005, Slint played a number of shows in the U.S. and in Europe. Though they insisted the reunion was short-term, the band regrouped once again in 2007 to perform &quot;Spiderland&quot; in its entirety in Barcelona as part of the Primavera Sound Festival, in London as part of the ATP &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; series of shows, as well as at a handful of dates in Europe, the U.S. (at Chicago&#x27;s Pitchfork Music Festival, the Showbox in Seattle, and the Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood), and Canada. In addition to performing the album and the EP &quot;Slint&quot;, they also debuted a new composition called &quot;King&#x27;s Approach&quot;, which remains unrecorded.

In a September 2012 interview conducted with Northern Irish music publication AU Magazine, David Pajo hinted at more activity from the band in the coming months: &quot;We still communicate regularly and we&#x27;ve got some surprises for next year that fans will be excited about. I know I am.&quot; The band reunited in December 2013 to play as one of the headliners of the final All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Camber Sands, England.

A deluxe &quot;Spiderland&quot; boxset was announced in January 2014. In 2014 Touch and Go released several live, demo, and practice sessions of songs recorded by the band between 1989 and 1990. These appeared as the LP &quot;Bonus Tracks&quot;, as well as in box set editions of &quot;Spiderland&quot; alongside the DVD &quot;Breadcrumb Trail&quot;, filmmaker Lance Bangs&#x27; 90-minute documentary about the band shot over the course of 12 years. In 2014, the band also performed at the Primavera Sound music festival in Spain and Portugal and Green Man Festival in Wales. The group has no plans to record new material and have since disbanded after their most recent reunions in 2013 and 2014.

== Style and influence==
The band is noted for having syncopated guitar riffs, drastically altering dynamics, and complex song structures and time signatures. McMahan&#x27;s and Walford&#x27;s vocals comprised hushed spoken words, singing, and strained screaming. Artists that influenced Slint include Leonard Cohen, Neil Young, Nick Cave, Madonna, Philip Glass, Minutemen and Big Black.

Rachel Devine of &quot;The List&quot; called &quot;Spiderland&quot; &quot;arguably the most disproportionately influential [album] in music history&quot;. It is regarded as a highly influential forerunner of the math-rock genre, with &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Stuart Berman noting how the album &quot;motivated a cluster of semi-popular bands in the late-90s and early 2000s to adopt its whisper-to-scream schematic. It&#x27;s the boundless inspiration it perpetually provides for all the bands that have yet to emerge from the basement.&quot; 

Additionally, they have come to be regarded as one of the pioneers of post-rock, &quot;Spiderland&quot; being described as &quot;the ur-text for what became known as post-rock, a fractured, almost geometric reimagining of rock music stripped of its dionysiac impulse.&quot; Mogwai&#x27;s Stuart Braithwaite was struck by the &quot;psychic playing&quot; evident on &quot;Spiderland&quot;, stating &quot;when I heard it, it was unlike anything I’d heard before. I still don’t know if I have heard anything else like it, now. Obviously a lot of bands take a lot from it – I know that we did.&quot;

<doc id="300309" wikidata="Q317736" url="?curid=300309" title="Utagawa Kuniyoshi">
<text>Utagawa Kuniyoshi (, ; 1 January 1798 – 14 April 1861) was one of the last great masters of the Japanese ukiyo-e style of woodblock prints and painting. He was a member of the Utagawa school.

The range of Kuniyoshi&#x27;s subjects included many genres: landscapes, women, Kabuki actors, cats, and mythical animals. He is known for depictions of the battles of legendary samurai heroes. His artwork incorporated aspects of Western representation in landscape painting and caricature.

==Life==
Kuniyoshi was born on 1 January 1798, the son of a silk-dyer, Yanagiya Kichiyemon, originally named Yoshisaburō. Apparently he assisted his father&#x27;s business as a pattern designer, and some have suggested that this experience influenced his rich use of color and textile patterns in prints. It is said that Kuniyoshi was impressed, at an early age of seven or eight, by ukiyo-e warrior prints, and by pictures of artisans and commoners (as depicted in craftsmen manuals), and it is possible these influenced his own later prints.

Yoshisaburō proved his drawing talents at age 12, quickly attracting the attention of the famous ukiyo-e print master Utagawa Toyokuni. He was officially admitted to Toyokuni&#x27;s studio in 1811, and became one of his chief pupils. He remained an apprentice until 1814, at which time he was given the name &quot;Kuniyoshi&quot; and set out as an independent artist. During this year he produced his first published work, the illustrations for the &quot;kusazōshi&quot; &quot;gōkan&quot; &quot;Gobuji Chūshingura&quot;, a parody of the original Chūshingura story. Between 1815 and 1817 he created a number of book illustrations for &quot;yomihon&quot;, &quot;kokkeibon&quot;, &quot;gōkan&quot; and &quot;hanashibon&quot;, and printed his stand-alone full color prints of warriors and kabuki actors.

Despite his promising debut, the young Kuniyoshi failed to produce many works between 1818 and 1827, probably due to a lack of commissions from publishers, and the competition of other artists within the Utagawa school (Utagawa-&quot;ryū&quot;). However, during this time he did produce pictures of beautiful women (&#x27;bijin-ga&#x27;) and experimented with large textile patterns and light-and-shadow effects found in Western art, although his attempts showed more imitation than real understanding of these principles.

His economic situation turned desperate at one point when he was forced to sell used tatami mats. A chance encounter with his prosperous fellow pupil Kunisada, to whom he felt that he was superior in artistic talent, led him to redouble his efforts (but did not create any lingering ill-feeling between the two, who later collaborated on a number of series).

During the 1820s, Kuniyoshi produced a number of heroic triptychs that show the first signs of an individual style. In 1827 he received his first major commission for the series, &quot;One hundred and eight heroes of the popular Suikoden all told&quot; (&quot;Tsūzoku Suikoden gōketsu hyakuhachinin no hitori&quot;), based on the incredibly popular Chinese tale, the &quot;Shuihu Zhuan&quot;. In this series Kuniyoshi illustrated individual heroes on single-sheets, drawing tattoos on his heroes, a novelty which soon influenced Edo fashion. The Suikoden series became extremely popular in Edo, and the demand for Kuniyoshi&#x27;s warrior prints increased, gaining him entrance into the major ukiyo-e and literary circles.

He continued to produce warrior prints, drawing much of his subjects from war tales such as &quot;Tale of the Heike&quot; () and &quot;The rise and fall of the Minamoto and the Taira&quot; (&quot;Genpei Seisuiki&quot;). His warrior prints were unique in that they depicted legendary popular figures with an added stress on dreams, ghostly apparitions, omens, and superhuman feats. This subject matter is instilled in his works &quot;The ghost of Taira no Tomomori at Daimotsu bay&quot; (&quot;Taira Tomomori borei no zu&quot;) and the 1839 triptych &quot;The Gōjō bridge&quot; (&quot;Gōjō no bashi no zu&quot;), where he manages to invoke an effective sense of action intensity in his depiction of the combat between Yoshitsune and Benkei. These new thematic styles satisfied the public&#x27;s interest in the ghastly, exciting, and bizarre that was growing during the time.

The Tenpō Reforms of 1841–1843 aimed to alleviate economic crisis by controlling public displays of luxury and wealth, and the illustration of courtesans and actors in &quot;ukiyō-e&quot; was officially banned at that time. This may have had some influence on Kuniyoshi&#x27;s production of caricature prints or comic pictures (&quot;giga&quot;), which were used to disguise actual actors and courtesans. Many of these symbolically and humorously criticized the shogunate (such as the 1843 design showing Minamoto no Yorimitsu asleep, haunted by the Earth Spider and his demons) and became popular among the politically dissatisfied public. Timothy Clark, curator of Japanese art at the British Museum, asserts that the repressive conventions of the day produced unintended consequences. The government-created limitations became a kind of artistic challenge which actually encouraged Kuniyoshi&#x27;s creative resourcefulness by forcing him to find ways to veil criticism of the shogunate allegorically.

During the decade leading up to the reforms, Kuniyoshi also produced landscape prints (&quot;fūkeiga&quot;), which were outside the bounds of censorship and catered to the rising popularity of personal travel in late Edo Japan. Notable among these were &quot;Famous products of the provinces&quot; (&quot;Sankai meisan zukushi&quot;, c. 1828–30)—where he incorporated Western shading and perspective and pigments—and &quot;Famous views of the Eastern capital&quot; in the early 1830s, which was certainly influenced by Hokusai&#x27;s early-1830s &quot;Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji&quot; (&quot;Fugaku sanjūrokkei&quot;). Kuniyoshi also produced during this time works of purely natural subject matter, notably of animals, birds and fish that mimicked traditional Japanese and Chinese painting.

In the late 1840s, Kuniyoshi began again to illustrate actor prints, this time evading censorship (or simply evoking creativity) through childish, cartoon-like portraits of famous kabuki actors, the most notable being &quot;Scribbling on the storehouse wall&quot; (&quot;Nitakaragurakabe no mudagaki&quot;). Here he creatively used elementary, childlike script sloppily written in kana under the actor faces. Reflecting his love for felines, Kuniyoshi also began to use cats in the place of humans in kabuki and satirical prints. He is also known during this time to have experimented with wide composition, magnifying visual elements in the image for a dramatic, exaggerated effect (ex. &quot;Masakado&#x27;s daughter the princess Takiyasha, at the old Soma palace&quot;).

In 1856 Kuniyoshi suffered from palsy, which caused him much difficulty in moving his limbs. It is said that his works from this point onward were noticeably weaker in the use of line and overall vitality. Before his death in 1861, Kuniyoshi was able to witness the opening of the port city of Yokohama to foreigners, and in 1860 produced two works depicting Westerners in the city (Yokohama-e, ex. &quot;View of Honchō&quot; and &quot;The pleasure quarters, Yokohama&quot;). He died at the age of 63 in April 1861 in his home in Genyadana.

==Pupils==
Kuniyoshi was an excellent teacher and had numerous pupils who continued his branch of the Utagawa school. Among the most notable were Yoshitoshi, Yoshitora, Yoshiiku, Yoshikazu, Yoshitsuya, and Yoshifuji. Typically his students began an apprenticeship in which they worked primarily on musha-e in a style similar to that of their master. As they became established as independent artists, many went on to develop highly innovative styles of their own. His most important student was Yoshitoshi, who is now regarded as the &quot;last master&quot; of the Japanese woodblock print.

Among those influenced by Kuniyoshi was Toyohara Chikanobu. Takashi Murakami credits the pioneering influence of Kuniyoshi affecting his work.

<doc id="300318" wikidata="Q453156" url="?curid=300318" title="Lautaro">
<text>Lautaro (Anglicized as &#x27;Levtaru&#x27;) ( &quot;swift hawk&quot;) (; 1534 – April 29, 1557) was a young Mapuche toqui known for leading the indigenous resistance against Spanish conquest in Chile and developing the tactics that would continue to be employed by the Mapuche during the long-running Arauco War. Levtaru was captured by Spanish forces in his early youth, and he spent his teenage years as a personal servant of chief conquistador Pedro de Valdivia, but escaped in 1551. Back among his people he was declared toqui and led Mapuche warriors into a series of victories against the Spanish, culminating in the Battle of Tucapel in December 1553, where Pedro of Valdivia was killed. The outbreak of a typhus plague, a drought and a famine prevented the Mapuche from taking further actions to expel the Spanish in 1554 and 1555. Between 1556 and 1557, a small group of Mapuche commanded by Levtaru attempted to reach Santiago to liberate the whole of Central Chile from Spanish rule. Levtaru&#x27;s attempts ended in 1557 when he was killed in an ambush by the Spanish.

Today, Levtaru is revered among Mapuche and non-Mapuche Chileans for his resistance against foreign conquest, servitude and cruelty.

==Early life==
Lautaro was the son of a Mapuche &quot;lonko&quot; (a chief who holds office during peacetime) called Curiñancu (Kurüñamku in the Mapuche language, Mapudungun, ‘aguilucho negro’ meaning ‘black harrier’) and was born in 1533. He lived a normal life until, at the age of 11, he was captured by the Spanish and forced into servitude by Don Pedro de Valdivia and became his personal servant. Since it was difficult for the Spaniards to pronounce Lautaro’s original name, Leftraru, they gave him the name of Felipe Lautaro. Don Pedro de Valdivia was a Spanish conqueror of Chile and then became the captain general of Chile.

Lautaro learned the military ways and skills of the Spaniards&#x27; army by observation. He was witness to atrocities committed by the Spanish on captive Mapuche warriors. According to several historians, in the immediate vicinity of what is now the city of Concepción, Chile, Pedro de Valdivia ordered his men to cut off the feet and hands of every Mapuche in Curiñancu&#x27;s tribe, for resisting Spanish colonization, among them Curiñancu and his wife, Lautaro’s parents, in order to teach the Mapuche a lesson. It is said that because of Valdivia’s command to cut off the toes of the Mapuche warriors, the Spanish soldiers named the place “El Valle de La Mocha”, whose name has been maintained over time. A great hatred of the Spanish and particularly of Pedro de Valdivia was born in the young Lautaro because of this incident. After his capture they made him a Yanakuna, meaning a “black slave” in Quechua. He remained a prisoner of the Spanish for three years. Because he kept his personal hatred of Valdivia hidden, Lautaro soon became his personal page. Among his daily tasks as a page, he was in charge of taking care of Valdivia’s horses and always accompanying them into battle and military exercises. This is how he learned not to fear horses and even become a good rider himself.

During this period he had a certain level of friendship with one of Valdivia’s principal captains by the name of Marcos Veas, who taught Lautaro how to use different kinds of weapons and cavalry tactics. This was a typical practice because as a yanakuna Lautaro was responsible to serve as an indigenous assistant during battles.

According to the Chilean novelist Isabel Allende in her historical novel, &quot;Inés del Alma Mía&quot;, the boy Lautaro had deliberately allowed himself to be captured by the Spanish in order to learn their secrets, and made no attempt to escape until he felt he had learned enough. In any case, he fled twice, first in 1550 and for good in 1552. In 1553 (the year Lautaro turned 19), the Mapuches convened to decide how to respond to the Spanish invasion. The convention decided upon war. The &quot;toqui&quot; Caupolicán chose Lautaro as vice toqui because he had served as a page in the Spanish cavalry, and thereby possessed knowledge of how to defeat the mounted &quot;conquistadors&quot;. Lautaro introduced use of horses to the Mapuche and designed better combat tactics. He organized a large, cohesive army—a military formation unfamiliar to the Mapuche.

==Campaigns==

===Battle of Tucapel===
With 6,000 warriors under his command, Lautaro attacked Fort Tucapel. The Spanish garrison couldn&#x27;t withstand the assault and retreated to Purén. Lautaro seized the fort, sure that the Spaniards would attempt to retake it. That is exactly what Governor Valdivia tried to do with a reduced force, which was quickly surrounded and massacred by the Mapuches on Christmas Day, 1553. The Battle of Tucapel would be Pedro de Valdivia&#x27;s last, as he was captured and then killed.

After the defeat at Tucapel, the Spanish hastily reorganized their forces, reinforcing the defenses of Fort Imperial and abandoning the settlements of Confines and Arauco in order to strengthen Concepción. However, Mapuche tradition dictated a lengthy victory celebration, which kept Lautaro from realizing his desire to pursue the military advantage he had just gained. It was only in February 1554 that he succeeded in putting together an army of 8,000 men, just in time to confront a punitive expedition under the command of Francisco de Villagra.

===Battle of Marihueñu===
Lautaro chose the hill of Marihueñu to fight the Spanish. He organized his forces in four divisions: two charged with containing and wearing down the enemy, a third held in reserve to launch a fresh attack as the Spanish were about to crumble, and the last charged with cutting off their retreat. Additionally, a small group was sent to destroy the reed bridge the Spanish had erected across the Bío-Bío River, which would further disrupt any attempted retreat of Villagra.

The Spanish attack broke the first Mapuche lines, but the quick response of the third division maintained the Mapuche position. Later, the wings of this division began to attack the Spanish flanks, and the fourth division attacked from behind. After hours of battle, only a small group of Spanish managed to retreat. Despite this fresh victory, Lautaro was again unable to pursue the opportunity due to the celebrations and beliefs of his people. By the time he arrived at Concepción, it was already abandoned. He burned it, but his remaining forces were insufficient to continue the offensive, so the campaign came to an end.

In Santiago, Villagra reorganized his forces, and that same year of 1554, he departed again for Arauco and reinforced the strongholds of Imperial and Valdivia, without any interference from the Mapuches, who were dealing with their first epidemic of smallpox, which had been brought by the Spanish.

In 1555, the Real Audiencia of Lima ordered Villagra to reconstruct Concepción, which was done under the command of Captain Alvarado. Upon learning of this, Lautaro successfully besieged Concepción with 4,000 warriors. Only 38 Spaniards managed to escape by sea the second destruction of the city.

===Peteroa and the Battle of Mataquito===
After the second rout at Concepción, Lautaro desired to attack Santiago. He found scant support for this plan from his troops, who soon dwindled to only 600, but he carried on. In October 1556 his northward march reached the Mataquito River, where he established a fortified camp at Peteroa. In the Battle of Peteroa he repulsed attacking Spanish forces under the command of Diego Cano, and later held off the larger force commanded by Pedro de Villagra. Being advised that still more Spaniards were approaching, Lautaro decided to retreat towards the Maule River losing 200 warriors. With the Spaniards in hot pursuit he was forced to retire beyond the Itata River. From there he launched another campaign towards Santiago when Villagra&#x27;s army passed him by on the way to save the remaining Spanish settlements in Araucanía. Lautaro had chosen to give Villagra&#x27;s force the slip and head for the city to attack it.

Despite the Mapuches&#x27; stealth, the city&#x27;s leaders learned of the advance and sent a small expedition to thwart it, buying time for word to be sent to Villagra to return to the city from the south. The Spanish forces met in the field, and from a member of the local ethnos, the Picunche, they learned the disposition of Lautaro&#x27;s camp. At dawn, on April 29, 1557, the &quot;conquistadors&quot; launched a surprise attack from the hills of Caune, obtaining a decisive victory in the Battle of Mataquito in which Lautaro was killed early in the fighting. After the defeat of his army, his head was cut off and displayed in the plaza of Santiago.

==Legacy==
Alonso de Ercilla, an officer in the Spanish forces early in the Araucanian war (who, as it happened, was only one year older than Lautaro), in the decade following his service composed that masterpiece of the Spanish Golden Age of literature—the epic poem, &quot;La Araucana--&quot;in which Lautaro is a central figure.

Lautaro is acclaimed in Chile as its first general, for uniting the dispersed Mapuche people and leading them in battle. He inflicted crushing defeats on Spanish armies which had armored horsemen wielding swords, metal war clubs and steel-tipped lances, armored footmen as well, with their own swords and clubs, crossbows and arquebuses, even though his own Mapuche were armed only with slings, bows and arrows, wooden spears, clubs and axes. Remarkably, he did this not fighting a &quot;guerilla&quot; war, but in pitched battle.

His name was used by Francisco de Miranda when he founded the Lautaro Lodge, a secret Latin American independence society of the end of 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. In the 20th century, Chilean author Pablo Neruda, the future Nobel Prize in Literature laureate, wrote a poem about him.

Lautaro appears in &quot;Civilization VI: Rise and Fall&quot;, an expansion of &quot;Civilization VI&quot; as the leader of the Mapuche civilization. His special ability decreases enemy city loyalty when the Mapuche kill a unit or pillage tiles inside the city&#x27;s borders.

The Argentine football player Lautaro Martínez was named after the Mapuche hero.

<text>The Mozarabs (from ), or more precisely Andalusi Christians, were the Christians of al-Andalus, or the territories of Iberia under Muslim rule from 711 to 1492. Following the Umayyad conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania, the Christian population of much of Iberia came under Muslim control.

Initially, the vast majority of Mozarabs kept Christianity and their dialects descended from Latin. Gradually, the population converted to Islam—an estimated 50% by the year 951—and was influenced, in varying degrees, by Arab customs and knowledge, and sometimes acquired greater social status in doing so. The local Romance vernaculars, with an important contribution of Arabic and spoken by Christians and Muslims alike, are referred to as Andalusi Romance, or the Mozarabic language. Mozarabs were mostly Catholics of the Visigothic or Mozarabic Rite. Due to Sharia and fiqh being confessional and only applying to Muslims, the Christians paid the jizya tax, the only relevant Islamic law obligation, and kept Roman-derived, Visigothic-influenced civil Law.

Most of the Mozarabs were descendants of local Christians and were primarily speakers of Romance varieties under Islamic rule. They also included those members of the former Visigothic ruling elite who did not convert to Islam or emigrate northwards after the Muslim conquest. Spanish Christians initially portrayed Muslims primarily as military or political enemies, but with time, Islam came to be seen as a religion and not merely a threat. Spanish Christians sought to discourage apostasy from Christianity and to defend Christian beliefs, but they increasingly became connected to the dar al-Islam (land of Islam), through shared culture, language, and regular interaction.

A few were Arab and Berber Christians coupled with Muslim converts to Christianity who, as Arabic speakers, felt at home among the original Mozarabs. A prominent example of a Muslim who became a Mozarab by embracing Christianity is the Andalusi rebel and anti-Umayyad military leader, Umar ibn Hafsun. The Mozarabs of Muslim origin were descendants of those Muslims who converted to Christianity following the conquest of Toledo, and perhaps also following the expeditions of King Alfonso I of Aragon. These Mozarabs of Muslim origin who converted en masse at the end of the 11th century, many of them Muladí (ethnic Iberians previously converted to Islam), are totally distinct from the Mudéjars and Moriscos who converted gradually to Christianity between the 12th and 17th centuries.

Separate Mozarab enclaves were located in the large Muslim cities, especially Toledo, Córdoba, Zaragoza, and Seville.

==Name==
&quot;Mozarab&quot; ( ; ; , from ) is first documented in Christian sources from the 11th century; the term &quot;Mozarab&quot; was not used by Muslims to describe Christians. Contemporary Arabic sources described Christians as &quot;naṣārā&quot; ( &#x27;Nazarenes&#x27;), or imprecisely by their legal-religious status: &quot;ahl adh-dhimma&quot; ( &#x27;people of the covenant&#x27;) or &quot;mu‘āhidūn&quot; ( &#x27;contractual partners&#x27;).

The term &quot;Mozarab&quot;, now sometimes applied broadly to all Christians in al-Andalus, is imprecise; many Christians living in Islamic Spain resisted Arabization, for example.

==Status==
Christians and Jews were designated as &quot;dhimmi&quot; under Sharia (Islamic law). Dhimmi were allowed to live within Muslim society, but were legally required to pay the jizya, a personal tax, and abide with a number of religious, social, and economic restrictions that came with their status. Despite their restrictions, the dhimmi were fully protected by the Muslim rulers and did not have to fight in case of war, because they paid the jizya.

As the universal nature of Roman law was eroded and replaced by Islamic law in part of the Iberian Peninsula, Sharia law allowed most ethnic groups in the medieval Islamic world to be judged by their own judges, under their own law: Mozarabs had their own tribunals and authorities. Some of them even held high offices in the Islamic administration under some rulers— a prominent example being that of Recemundus, a palace official, who, sometime between 961 and 976, wrote the famous &quot;Calendar of Córdoba&quot; for Abd ar-Rahman III, undertook various diplomatic missions in Germania and Byzantium, and was rewarded with the bishopric of &quot;Elvira&quot; (present-day Granada). Furthermore, in 1064, Emir Al-Muqtadir of Zaragoza sent Paternus, the Mozarabic bishop of Tortosa, as an envoy to king Ferdinand I of León in Santiago de Compostela, while the Christian Abu Umar ibn Gundisalvus, a Saqaliba (a Slav), served the same taifa ruler as the &quot;Wazir&quot; (Vizier, or the equivalent to prime minister).

Conversion to Islam was encouraged by the Umayyad caliphs and emirs of Córdoba. Many Mozarabs converted to Islam to avoid the heavy jizyah tax which they were subjected to as dhimmi. Conversion to Islam also opened up new horizons to the Mozarabs, alleviated their social position, ensured better living conditions, and broadened scope for more technically skilled and advanced work. Apostasy, however, for one who had been raised as a Muslim or had embraced Islam, was a crime punishable by death.

Until the mid-9th century, relations between Muslims and the majority Christian population of Al-Andalus, were relatively cordial. Christian resistance to the first wave of Muslim conquerors was unsuccessful. In Murcia, a single surviving capitulation document must stand for many such agreements to render tribute in exchange for the protection of traditional liberties; in it, Theodomirus (&quot;Todmir&quot; in Arabic), Visigothic count of Orihuela, agrees to recognize Abd al-Aziz as overlord and to pay tribute consisting of a yearly cash payment supplemented with specific agricultural products. In exchange, Theodomir received Abd al-Aziz&#x27; promise to respect both his property and his jurisdiction in the province of Murcia. There was no change in the composition of the people on the land, and in cases like this one, even their Visigothic lords remained.

In the Moorish controlled region of Al-Garb Al-Andalus to the west of Al-Andalus, which included the modern region of Algarve and most of Portugal, Mozarabs constituted the majority of the population.

The Muslim geographer Ibn Hawqal, who visited the country in the middle of the 10th century, spoke of frequent revolts by Mozarab peasants employed on large estates, probably those of the ruling aristocracy. There is also substantial evidence that Mozarabs fought in the defense of the thaghr (front line fortress towns), participating in raids against Christian neighbours and struggles between Muslim factions. For instance, in 936, a significant number of Christians holed up in Calatayud with the rebel Mutarraf, only to be massacred in a desperate stand against the Caliphate forces.

There is very little evidence of any Christian resistance at Al-Andalus in the 9th century. Evidence points to a rapid attrition in the North. For instance, during the 1st centuries of Muslim rule, the Mozarab community of Lleida was apparently ruled by a &quot;qumis&quot; (count) and had its own judiciary, but there is no evidence of any such administration in the later period.

Although Mozarab merchants traded in Andalusi markets, they were neither influential nor numerous before the middle of the 12th century. This stemmed from commercial disinterest and disorganization in the early Middle Ages, rather than any specific or religious impediments set up by the Muslim rulers. Unlike Andalusi Muslims and Jews, Mozarabs had little interest in commerce because of their general perception of trade as lowly and despicable. This was in stark contrast to the greater respect accorded to merchants in Jewish and Muslim societies, where trade was frequently combined with other callings, such as politics, scholarship, or medicine.

It is often mistakenly assumed that Mozarab merchants forged a vital commercial and cultural link between the north and south across the Iberian frontiers. Mozarab refugees may have had influence in northern Iberian trade at places like Toledo, but there is no reason to believe that they engaged in commerce with their abandoned homeland. Most traffic between Al-Andalus and Christian regions remained in the hands of Jewish and Muslim traders until the dramatic shifts initiated by European commercial expansion throughout the 11th and 12th centuries. With the development of Italian maritime power and the southward expansion of the Christian Reconquista, Andalusi international trade came increasingly under the control of Christian traders from northern Iberia, southern France, and Italy. By the middle of the 13th century, it was an exclusively Christian concern.

There were frequent contacts between the Mozarabs in Al-Andalus and their co-religionists both in the Kingdom of Asturias and in the Marca Hispanica, the territory under Frankish influence to the northeast. The level of literary culture among the northern Christians was inferior to that of their Mozarab brethren in the historic cities to the south, due to the prosperity of Al-Andalus. For that reason, Christian refugees from Al-Andalus were always welcomed in the north, where their descendants came to form an influential element. Though impossible to quantify, the emigration of Mozarabs from the south was probably a significant factor in the growth of the Christian principalities and kingdoms of northern Iberia.

For most of the 9th and 10th centuries, Iberian Christian culture in the north was stimulated by the learning of Mozarab immigrants, who helped to accentuate its Christian identity and apparently played a major role in development of Iberian Christian ideology. The Mozarab scholars and clergy eagerly sought manuscripts, relics and traditions from the towns and monasteries of central and southern Iberia that had been the heartland of Visigothic Catholicism. Many Mozarabs also took part in the many regional revolts that formed the great &quot;fitna&quot; or unrest in the late 9th century.

The ability of the Mozarabs to assimilate into Moorish culture while maintaining their Christian faith has often caused them to be depicted by Western scholars as having a strong allegiance to Catholicism and its cause. However, the historian Jaume Vicens Vives offers another view of the Mozarabs. He states that one of the Emperor Charlemagne&#x27;s major offensives was to annihilate the Moorish frontier by taking Zaragoza, which was an important Mozarab stronghold. However, the offensive failed because the Mozarabs of the city refused to cooperate with the Catholic emperor. Vives concludes that the Mozarabs were primarily a self-absorbed group. They understood that they could gain a great deal by remaining in close contact with the Moors.

There was a steady rate of decline among the Mozarab population of Al-Andalus towards the end of the Reconquista. This was mainly caused by conversions, emigration towards the northern part of the peninsula during the upheavals of the 9th and early 10th centuries and also by the ethno-religious conflicts of the same period.

The American historian, Richard Bulliet, in a work based on the quantitative use of the onomastic data as furnished by scholarly biographical dictionaries, concluded that it was only in the 10th century when the Andalusi emirate was firmly established and developed into the greatest power of the western Mediterranean under Caliph Abd ar-Rahman III, that the numerical ratio of Muslims and Christians in Al-Andalus was reversed in favour of the former. Prior to the middle of this century, he asserts, the population of Al-Andalus was still half Christian.

The expansion of the Caliphate had come primarily through conversion and absorption, and only very secondarily through immigration. The remaining Mozarab community shrank into an increasingly fossilized remnant.

Relatively large numbers of Mozarab communities did, however, continue to exist up to the end of the taifa kingdoms; there were several parishes in Toledo when the Christians occupied the city in 1085, and abundant documentation in Arabic on the Mozarabs of this city is preserved. An apparently still significant Mozarab group, which is the subject of a number of passages in the Arabic chronicles dealing with El Cid&#x27;s dominion over Valencia, was also to be found there during this same period. Similarly, the memoirs of the emir of Granada clearly indicate the existence of a relatively large rural Christian population in some parts of the Málaga region towards the end of the 11th century. Until the reconquest of Seville by the Christians in 1248, a Mozarab community existed there, though in the course of the 12th century Almoravid persecution had forced many Mozarabs in Al-Andalus to flee northward.

==Restrictions==
Christians did not enjoy equal rights under Islamic rule, and their original guarantees, at first fairly broad, steadily diminished. They were still allowed to practice their own religion in private, but found their cultural autonomy increasingly reduced. Mozarabs inevitably lost more and more status, but they long maintained their dignity and the integrity of their culture, and they never lost personal and cultural contact with the Christian world.

In the generations that followed the conquest, Muslim rulers promulgated new statutes clearly disadvantageous to dhimmi. The construction of new churches and the sounding of church bells were eventually forbidden. But when Eulogius of Córdoba recorded the martyrology of the Martyrs of Córdoba during the decade after 850, it was apparent that at least four Christian basilicas remained in the city, including the church of Saint Acisclus that had sheltered the only holdouts in 711, and nine monasteries and convents in the city and its environs; nevertheless, their existence soon became precarious.

It is supposed that the Mozarabs were tolerated as dhimmi and valued taxpayers, and no Mozarab was condemned to death until the formation of the party led by the Christian leaders Eulogius (beheaded in 859) and Alvaro of Córdoba, whose intense faith led them to seek martyrdom by insulting Muhammad, and criticizing Islam. The Arabization of the Christians was opposed by Eulogius himself, who called for a more purely Christian culture stripped of Moorish influences. To this end, he led a revolt of the Mozarabs at Córdoba in which Christians martyred themselves to protest against Muslim rule. 

However, Kenneth Baxter Wolf concludes that Eulogius was not the instigator of these persecutions but merely a hagiographer. This is consistent with other historical records of two Christians executed in 860, and shortly after a third one. The subsequent executions were in 888–912 and 913–920. Still more executions were recorded in Córdoba in 923 (Eugenia), a boy Pelagius in 925 (for refusal to convert to Islam and submit to the caliph&#x27;s sexual advances), and Argentea in 931. According to Wolf, there is no reason to believe that they stopped even then.

Eulogius&#x27;s writings documenting stories of the Córdoba martyrs of 851–59, encouraged by him to defy Muslim authorities with blasphemies and embrace martyrdom, contrast these Christians with the earlier official Christianity of the Visigoths, by Reccared, the previous bishop of Córdoba, who counseled tolerance and mutual forbearance with the Muslim authorities. However, since then Christians became increasingly alienated not only because they could not build new churches or ring church bells, but primarily because they were excluded from most positions of political, military, or social authority and suffered many other indignities as unequals under the Islamic law. By the mid-9th century, as the episode of the Córdoba martyrs reveals, there was a clear Christian opposition against the systematic pressure by a variety of legal and financial instruments of Islam, resisting their conversion and absorption into Muslim culture.

The initial official reaction to the Córdoba martyrs was to round up and imprison the leaders of the Christian community. Towards the end of the decade of the martyrs, Eulogius&#x27;s martyrology begins to record the closing of Christian monasteries and convents, which to Muslim eyes had proved to be a hotbed of disruptive fanaticism rather than a legitimate response against a slow but systematic elimination of Christianity.

As previously with the Muslims, so as the Reconquista advanced, the Mozarabs integrated into the Christian kingdoms, where the kings privileged those who settled the frontier lands. They also migrated north to the Frankish kingdom in times of persecution.

Significantly large numbers of Mozarabs settled in the Ebro valley. King Alfonso VI of Castile induced Mozarab settlers by promising them lands and rewards. His importation of Mozarab settlers from Al-Andalus was very unusual because of its startling nature. According to the Anglo-Norman historian, Orderic Vitalis, some 10,000 Mozarabs were sent by Alfonso for settlement on the Ebro. Mozarabs were scarce in Tudela or Zaragossa, but were more common in a place such as Calahorra, conquered by the Kingdom of Navarre in 1045.

==Language==
During the early stages of Romance language development in Iberia, a set of closely related Romance dialects was spoken in Muslim areas of the Peninsula by the general population. These closely related historic dialects are today known as the &quot;Mozarabic language&quot;, though there never was a common standard.

This archaic Romance language is first documented in writing in the Peninsula in the form of choruses (&quot;kharjas&quot;) in Arabic and Hebrew lyrics called &quot;muwashshahs&quot;. As they were written in Arabic and Hebrew alphabets the vowels have had to be reconstructed.

Mozarab had a significant impact in the formation of Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan, transmitting to these many words of Andalusi Arabic origin. The northward migration of Mozarabs explains the presence of Arabic toponyms in places where the Muslim presence did not last long.

The cultural language of Mozarabs continued to be Latin, but as time passed, young Mozarabs studied and even excelled at Arabic. The implantation of Arabic as the vernacular by the Moorish conquerors led the Christian polemicist Petrus Alvarus of Córdoba to famously lament the decline of spoken Latin among the local Christians.

The use of Arabic cognomens by the Mozarab communities of Al-Andalus is emblematic of the adoption by the Christians of the outward manifestations of Arab-language Islamic culture. The Mozarabs employed Arabic-style names such as &quot;Zaheid ibn Zafar&quot;, &quot;Pesencano ibn Azafar&quot;, &quot;Ibn Gafif&quot;, &quot;Ibn Gharsiya&quot; (Garcia), &quot;Ibn Mardanish&quot; (Martinez), &quot;Ibn Faranda&quot; (Fernandez), in purely Christian contexts. This demonstrates that they had acculturated thoroughly and that their Arabic names were not mere aliases adopted to facilitate their movement within Muslim society. Conversely, some Christian names such as &quot;Lope&quot; and &quot;Fortun&quot; entered the local Arabic lexicon (&quot;Lubb&quot; and &quot;Fortun&quot;), and others were adopted in translated form (such as &quot;Sa&#x27;ad&quot; for &quot;Felix&quot;). In the witness lists, Mozarabs identified themselves with undeniably Arabic names such as &quot;al-Aziz&quot;, and &quot;Ibn Uthman&quot;. Several Mozarabs also used the name &quot;Al-Quti&quot; (The Goth), and some may have been actual descendants from the family of the Pre-Islamic Visigothic Christian king, Wittiza.

==Culture and religion==

There are but few remains of Christian scholarly discourse in Muslim Iberia. What remains in Arabic are translations of the Gospels and the Psalms, anti-Islamic tracts and a translation of a church history. To this should be added literary remains in Latin which remained the language of the liturgy.

There is evidence of a limited cultural borrowing from the Mozarabs by the Muslim community in Al-Andalus. For instance, the Muslims&#x27; adoption of the Christian solar calendar and holidays was an exclusively Andalusi phenomenon. In Al-Andalus, the Islamic lunar calendar was supplemented by the local solar calendar, which were more useful for agricultural and navigational purposes. Like the local Mozarabs, the Muslims of Al-Andalus were notoriously heavy drinkers. Muslims also celebrated traditional Christian holidays sometimes with the sponsorship of their leaders, despite the fact that such fraternisation was generally opposed by the Ulema. The Muslims also hedged their metaphysical bets through the use of Roman Catholic sacraments. 

In the earliest period of Muslim domination of Iberia, there is evidence of extensive interaction between the two communities attested to by shared cemeteries and churches, bilingual coinage, and the continuity of late Roman pottery types. Furthermore, in the peninsula the conquerors did not settle in the &quot;amsar&quot;, the self-contained and deliberately isolated city camps set up alongside existing settlements elsewhere in the Muslim world with the intention of protecting Muslim settlers from corrupting indigenous influences.

The Arab and mostly Berber immigrants who settled in the existing towns were drawn into broad contact with natives. Their immigration, though limited in numbers, introduced new agricultural and hydraulic technologies, new craft industries, and Levantine techniques of shipbuilding. They were accompanied by an Arabic-language culture that brought with it the higher learning and science of the classical and post-classical Levantine world. The emir of Córdoba, Abd ar-Rahman I&#x27;s policy of allowing the ethnic Arab politico-military elite to practice agriculture further encouraged economic and cultural contact and cohesion. Moreover, the interaction of foreign and native elements, fostered by intermarriage and contact in day-to-day commercial and social life rapidly stimulated acculturation between the two groups.

The heterodox features of Mozarabic culture inevitably became more prominent. However, Christian women often married Muslim men and their children were raised as Muslims. Even within Mozarab families, legal divorce eventually came to be practised along Islamic lines. Some Mozarab men were even circumcised. Ordination of the clergy ultimately drifted far from canonical norms, breaking apostolic succession, and various Muslim sources claim that concubinage and fornication among the clergy was extremely widespread. 

Some Christian authorities (Álvaro and Eulogius of Córdoba) were scandalized at the treatment of Christians, and began encouraging the public declarations of the faith as a way to reinforce the faith of the Christian community and protest the Islamic laws that Christians saw as unjust. Eulogius composed tractates and martyrologies for Christians during this time.

The forty-eight Christians (mostly monks) known as the Martyrs of Córdoba were martyred between the years 850 and 859, being decapitated for publicly proclaiming their Christian beliefs. Dhimmi (non-Muslims living under Muslim rule) were not allowed to speak of their faith to Muslims under penalty of death.

Wolf points out that it is important to distinguish between the motivations of the individual martyrs, and those of Eulogius and Alvarus in writing the &quot;Memoriale&quot;. Jessica A. Coope says that while it would be wrong to ascribe a single motive to all forty-eight, she suggests that it reflects a protest against the process of assimilation. They demonstrated a determination to assert Christian identity.

The Mozarab population was badly affected by the hardening of relations between the Christians and the Muslims during the Almoravid period. In 1099, the people of Granada, by order of the Almoravid emir, Yusuf ibn Tashfin, acting on the advice of his Ulema, destroyed the main Mozarab church of the Christian community. 

The Mozarabs remained apart from the influence of French Catholic religious orders, such as the Cistercians – highly influential in northern Christian Iberia, and conserved in their masses the Visigothic rite, also known as the Mozarabic Rite. The Christian kingdoms of the north, though, changed to the Latin liturgical rites and appointed northerners as bishops for the reconquered sees. Nowadays, the Mozarabic Rite is allowed by a papal privilege at the Mozarab Chapel of the Cathedral of Toledo, where it is held daily. The Poor Clare church in Madrid, La Inmaculada y San Pascual, also holds weekly Mozarabic masses. A Mozarab brotherhood is still active in Toledo. Since Toledo was the most deeply rooted centre where they remained firm, the Gothic rite was identified and came to be known as the &quot;Toledan rite&quot;. 

In 1080, Pope Gregory VII called the council of Burgos, where it was agreed to unify the Latin liturgical rite in all Christian lands. In 1085, Toledo was reconquered and there was a subsequent attempt to reintroduce the ecumenical standards of Rome. The reaction of the Toledan people was such that the king refused to implement it, and in 1101 enacted the &quot;Fuero (Code of laws) of the Mozarabs&quot;, which awarded them privileges. He specified that it applied only to the Castilians, Mozarabs, and Franks of the city. 

During both his first marriage to Agnes of Aquitaine and his second marriage to Constance of Burgundy, both of whom were devout Catholics, King Alfonso VI of Castile was under constant pressure to eradicate the Mozarabic Rite. A popular legend states that Alfonso VI submitted the Mozarab liturgy and its Roman counterpart to ordeal by fire, putting the fix in for the Catholic rite. Hence, the Mozarab liturgy was abolished in 1086. The Mozarabic Chapel in the Cathedral of Toledo still uses the Mozarabic Rite and music.

In 1126, a great number of Mozarabs were expelled to North Africa by the Almoravids. Other Mozarabs fled to Northern Iberia. This constituted the end of the Mozarabic culture in Al-Andalus. For a while, both in North Africa and in Northern Iberia, the Mozarabs managed to maintain their own separate cultural identity. However, in North Africa, they were eventually Islamized.

Over the course of the 12th and 13th centuries, there unrolled a steady process of the impoverishment of Mozarab cultivators, as more and more land came under control of magnates and ecclesiastical corporations. The latter, under the influence of the Benedictine bishop of Cluny Bernard, and the Archbishop of Toledo Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada, who was himself the principal buyer of Mozarab property in the early 13th century fomented a segregationalist policy under the cloak of religious nationalism. Jiménez de Rada&#x27;s bias is symbolized in his coining of the semi-erudite etymology of the word Mozarab from &quot;Mixti Arabi&quot;, connoting the contamination of this group by overexposure to infidel customs, if not by migration. 

At Toledo, King Alfonso VI of Castile did not recognize the Mozarabs as a separate legal community, and thus accentuated a steady decline which led to the complete absorption of the Mozarabs by the general community by the end of the 15th century. As a result, the Mozarabic culture had been practically lost. Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, aware of the Mozarabic liturgy historical value and liturgical richness, undertook the task of guaranteeing its continuation, and to this end gathered all the codices and texts to be found in the city. After they had been carefully studied by specialists, they were classified and in 1502 the Missal and Breviary were printed. They revitalized the faith and a chapel was instituted at the cathedral, with its own priests which still exists today. 

The Mozarab Missal of Silos is the oldest Western manuscript on paper, written in the 11th century. The Mozarab community in Toledo continues to thrive to this day. It is made of 1,300 families whose genealogies can be traced back to the ancient Mozarabs.

== Debates on population ==
There is a long-running debate about how many of the population of Al-Andalus were Mozarabs. Some maintain that the Mozarabs were part of a historical continuum of Latinized Christians that represented the majority of the population of Al-Andalus, while others argue that the Christian population was relatively small in the areas under Muslim rule. The former camp bases their position on the work of Francisco Javier Simonet, whose works &quot;Glosario de voces ibéricas y latinas usadas entre los mozárabes&quot; (1888) and &quot;Historia de los mozárabes de España&quot; supported the idea that the indigenous Christian community of Al-Andalus formed the majority of the population. Other historians argue that the work of Simonet and those who preceded him in studying this question did not use sources properly, and that there is no historical evidence that can be used to make a definitive pronouncement on the ethnic composition of Al-Andalus society. According to scholar Josephine Labanyi, at the end of the 11th century there were about 75,000 Christians in the Emirate of Granada or roughly 15% of the population of Islamic Iberia.

== Literature ==

The literature of the Mozarabs is bilingual in Latin and Arabic. Mozarabs were originally those Christians living under Islamic rule following their own Mozarabic rite. Many continued to live under Christian rule while keeping their distinctive rite down to the 14th century. The switch from a predominantly Latinate culture to an Arabic one was already well underway in the mid-9th century. The use of Arabic by Mozarabs rapidly declined in the late 13th century.

Among the Latin works of early Mozarabic culture, historiography is especially important, since it constitutes the earliest record from al-Andalus of the conquest period. There are two main works, the &quot;Chronicle of 741&quot; and the &quot;Chronicle of 754&quot;.

At the height of the Córdoban martyrs&#x27; movement (850–859), Albarus of Córdoba wrote a treatise in Latin, &quot;Indiculus luminosus&quot;, defending the martyrs and decrying the movement towards Arabic among his fellow Mozarabs. A generation later, Ḥafṣ ibn Albar al-Qūtī, finished a rhymed verse translation of the Psalms from the Latin Vulgate in 889. Although it survives in only one manuscript, it was a popular text and is quoted by Muslim and Jewish authors. Ḥafṣ also wrote a book of Christian answers to Muslim questions about their faith called &quot;The Book of the Fifty-Seven Questions&quot;. It is lost, but there are excerpts in the work of al-Qurṭubī, who praises Ḥafṣ&#x27; command of Arabic as the best among the Mozarabs. The 11th-century writer Ibn Gabirol also quotes from a lost work of Ḥafṣ al-Qūtī.

<doc id="300321" wikidata="Q422709" url="?curid=300321" title="Chloromethane">
<text>Chloromethane, also called methyl chloride, Refrigerant-40, R-40 or HCC 40, is an organic compound with the chemical formula . One of the haloalkanes, it is a colorless, sweet-smelling, flammable gas. Methyl chloride is a crucial reagent in industrial chemistry, although it is rarely present in consumer products, and was formerly utilized as a refrigerant. Most chloromethane is biogenic.

==Occurrence==
Chloromethane is an abundant organohalogen, anthropogenic or natural, in the atmosphere. Natural sources produce an estimated 4,100,000,000 kg/yr.
===Marine===
Laboratory cultures of marine phytoplankton (&quot;Phaeodactylum tricornutum&quot;, &quot;Phaeocystis&quot; sp., &quot;Thalassiosira weissflogii&quot;, &quot;Chaetoceros calcitrans&quot;, &quot;Isochrysis&quot; sp., &quot;Porphyridium&quot; sp., &quot;Synechococcus&quot; sp., &quot;Tetraselmis&quot; sp., &quot;Prorocentrum&quot; sp., and &quot;Emiliana huxleyi&quot;) produce CH3Cl, but in relatively insignificant amounts. An extensive study of 30 species of polar macroalgae revealed the release of significant amounts of CH3Cl in only &quot;Gigartina skottsbergii&quot; and &quot;Gymnogongrus antarcticus&quot;.

===Biogenesis===
The salt marsh plant &quot;Batis maritima&quot; contains the enzyme methyl chloride transferase that catalyzes the synthesis of CH3Cl from S-adenosine-L-methionine and chloride. This protein has been purified and expressed in &quot;E. coli&quot;, and seems to be present in other organisms such as white rot fungi (&quot;Phellinus pomaceus&quot;), red algae (&quot;Endocladia muricata&quot;), and the ice plant (&quot;Mesembryanthemum crystallinum&quot;), each of which is a known CH3Cl producer.

===Sugarcane and the emission of methyl chloride===
In the sugarcane industry, the organic waste is usually burned in the power cogeneration process. When contaminated by chloride, this waste burns, releasing methyl chloride in the atmosphere.

===Interstellar detections===
Chloromethane has been detected in the low-mass Class 0 protostellar binary, IRAS 16293–2422, using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). It was also detected in the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (67P/C-G) using the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument on the Rosetta spacecraft. The detections reveal that chloromethane can be formed in star-forming regions before planets or life is formed.

==Production==
Chloromethane (originally called &quot;chlorohydrate of methylene&quot;) was among the earliest organochlorine compounds to be discovered when it was synthesized by French chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugène-Melchior Péligot in 1835 by boiling a mixture of methanol, sulfuric acid, and sodium chloride. This method is the forerunner for that used today, which uses hydrogen chloride instead of sulfuric acid and sodium chloride.

Chloromethane is produced commercially by treating methanol with hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride, according to the chemical equation:

: CH3OH + HCl → CH3Cl + H2O

A smaller amount of chloromethane is produced by treating a mixture of methane with chlorine at elevated temperatures. This method, however, also produces more highly chlorinated compounds such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. For this reason, methane chlorination is usually only practiced when these other products are also desired. This chlorination method also cogenerates hydrogen chloride, which poses a disposal problem.

==Dispersion in the environment==

Most of the methyl chloride present in the environment ends up being released to the atmosphere. After being released into the air, the atmospheric lifetime of this substance is about 10 months with multiple natural sinks, such as ocean, transport to the stratosphere, soil, etc.

On the other hand, when the methyl chloride emitted is released to water, it will be rapidly lost by volatilization. The half-life of this substance in terms of volatilization in the river, lagoon and lake is 2.1 h, 25 h and 18 days, respectively.

The amount of methyl chloride in the stratosphere is estimated to be 2 tonnes per year, representing 20–25% of the total amount of chlorine that is emitted to the stratosphere annually.

==Uses==

Large scale use of chloromethane is for the production of dimethyldichlorosilane and related organosilicon compounds. These compounds arise via the direct process. The relevant reactions are (Me = CH3):
:x MeCl + Si → Me3SiCl, Me2SiCl2, MeSiCl3, Me4Si2Cl2, ...
Dimethyldichlorosilane (Me2SiCl2) is of particular value as a precursor to silicones, but trimethylsilyl chloride (Me3SiCl) and methyltrichlorosilane (MeSiCl3) are also valuable.
Smaller quantities are used as a solvent in the manufacture of butyl rubber and in petroleum refining.

Chloromethane is employed as a methylating and chlorinating agent, e.g. the production of methylcellulose. It is also used in a variety of other fields: as an extractant for greases, oils, and resins, as a propellant and blowing agent in polystyrene foam production, as a local anesthetic, as an intermediate in drug manufacturing, as a catalyst carrier in low-temperature polymerization, as a fluid for thermometric and thermostatic equipment, and as a herbicide.

===Obsolete applications===
Chloromethane was a widely used refrigerant, but its use has been discontinued. It was particularly dangerous among the common refrigerants of the 1930s due to its combination of toxicity, flammability and lack of odor as compared with other toxic refrigerants such as sulfur dioxide and ammonia. Chloromethane was also once used for producing lead-based gasoline additives (tetramethyllead).

==Safety==
Inhalation of chloromethane gas produces central nervous system effects similar to alcohol intoxication. The TLV is 50 ppm and the MAC is the same. Prolonged exposure may have mutagenic effects.

<text>Tōshūsai Sharaku (; active 1794–1795) was a Japanese ukiyo-e print designer, known for his portraits of kabuki actors. Neither his true name nor the dates of his birth or death are known. His active career as a woodblock artist spanned ten months; his prolific work met disapproval and his output came to an end as suddenly and mysteriously as it had begun. His work has come to be considered some of the greatest in the ukiyo-e genre.

Sharaku made mostly &quot;yakusha-e&quot; portraits of kabuki actors. His compositions emphasize poses of dynamism and energy, and display a realism unusual for prints of the time—contemporaries such as Utamaro represented their subjects with an idealized beauty, while Sharaku did not shy from showing unflattering details. This was not to the tastes of the public, and the enigmatic artist&#x27;s production ceased in the first month of 1795. His mastery of the medium with no apparent apprenticeship has drawn much speculation, and researchers have long tried to discover his true identity—amongst the dozens of proposals, some suggest he was an obscure poet, others a Noh actor, or even the ukiyo-e master Hokusai.

==Background==

Ukiyo-e art flourished in Japan during the Edo period from the 17th to 19th centuries. The artform took as its primary subjects courtesans, kabuki actors, and others associated with the &quot;ukiyo&quot; &quot;floating world&quot; lifestyle of the pleasure districts. Alongside paintings, mass-produced woodblock prints were a major form of the genre. Ukiyo-e art was aimed at the merchants at the bottom of the social scale, especially of the administrative capital of Edo (modern Tokyo). Its audience, themes, aesthetics, and mass-produced nature kept it from consideration as serious art.

After the mid-18th century, full-colour &quot;&quot; prints became common, printed with a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour. Critics have come to see the late 18th century as a peak period in the general quality of the work. Shunshō of the Katsukawa school introduced the &quot;ōkubi-e&quot; &quot;large-headed picture&quot; in the 1760s. He and other members of the Katsukawa school popularized &quot;ōkubi yakusha-e&quot; actor prints and the dusting of mica in the backgrounds to produce a luxurious glittering effect. In contrast to earlier actor prints, which used stereotyped features and poses of anonymous actors, these &quot;ōkubi yakusha-e&quot; aimed for recognizable likenesses.

Tōshūsai Sharaku&#x27;s works appeared in the middle of the Kansei era (1789–1801), when the nation faced hard economic times that the military government responded to with reactionary policies such as the Kansei Reforms intended to strengthen the feudalistic shogunal system. Some of the policies restricted extravagant fashions, and Kabuki theatres faced strict control over their perceived excesses and limits on actors&#x27; incomes. Late Edo-period art nevertheless flourished, and new works and popular actors continued to rapidly appear in kabuki theatre, where realistic performances came in vogue. &quot;Yakusha-e&quot; came to favour a greater emphasis on the individuality of the actors, and buyers came to expect pictures with the actors&#x27; likenesses, rather than the stereotyped images of the past, such as those by the once-dominant Torii school.

==Works==

Over 140 prints have been established as the work of Sharaku; the majority are portraits of actors or scenes from kabuki theatre, and most of the rest are of sumo wrestlers or warriors. The prints appeared in the common print sizes &quot;aiban&quot;, &quot;hosoban&quot;, and &quot;ōban&quot;. They are divided into four periods. The prints of the first two periods are signed &quot;Tōshūsai Sharaku&quot;, the latter two only &quot;Sharaku&quot;. The print sizes became progressively smaller and the focus shifts from busts to full-length portraits. The depictions become less expressive and more conventional. Two picture calendars dating to as early as 1789 and three decorated fans as late as 1803 have been attributed to Sharaku, but have yet to be accepted as authentic works of his. Sharaku&#x27;s reputation rests largely on the earlier prints; those from the eleventh month of 1794 and after are considered artistically inferior.

===First period===

28 &quot;ōban&quot; prints make up the first period from the fifth month of Kansei 6 (in 1794). They depict actors from kabuki plays performed at three theatres: &quot;Hana-ayame Bunroku Soga&quot; at the Miyako-za; &quot;Katakiuchi Noriyaibanashi&quot; and the &quot;jōruri&quot; &quot;Hana-shōbu Omoi no Kanzashi&quot; at the Kiri-za; and the &quot;kiri-kyōgen&quot; &quot;Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura&quot; at the Kawarazaki-za. These prints are &quot;ōkubi yakusha-e&quot; against black mica backgrounds, made with a precise, fine line and simple colour scheme. There are printing variants of these early prints, suggesting they went through multiple printings and thus sold relatively well.

===Second period===

8 &quot;ōban&quot; and 30 &quot;hosoban&quot; prints make up the second period from the seventh and eighth months of Kansei 6 (1794). 16 prints are from the &quot;jidai-kyōgen&quot; &quot;Keisei Sanbon Karasaka&quot; at Miyako-za in the seventh month; 10 from &quot;Nihon Matsu Michinoku Sodachi&quot; and the &quot;jōruri&quot; &quot;Katsuragawa Tsuki no Omoide&quot; at the Kawarazaki-za in the seventh month; 11 from the &quot;jidai-kyōgen&quot; &quot;Shinrei Yaguchi no Watashi&quot;, &quot;Yomo no Nishiki Kokyō no Tabiji&quot;, and the &quot;jōruri&quot; &quot;Tsuki no Mayu Koi no Monaka&quot; at the Kiri-za in the eighth month; and one portrait of Shinozuka Uraeimon as the announcer at Miyako-za.

Of the 8 &quot;ōban&quot; prints, 7 are full-length portraits of pairs of actors; the other is of the announcer at Miyako-za—the only full-body &quot;yakusha-e&quot; of a single subject in Sharaku&#x27;s œuvre. The only one of these &quot;ōban&quot; prints to employ black mica is that of Ichikawa Komazō III as Kameya Chūbei and Nakayama Tomisaburō as Umegawa from &quot;Tsuki no Mayu Koi no Monaka&quot;. The &quot;hosoban&quot; prints are all full-body portraits of a single actor against a yellowish background, with the exception of the portraits of Ōtani Oniji II as Kawashima Jibugorō and Ichikawa Omezō I as Tomita Hyōtarō, which are on grey backgrounds.

===Third period===

47 &quot;hosoban&quot;, 13 &quot;aiban&quot;, and 4 &quot;ōban&quot; prints make up the third period (1794–1795). From the eleventh month of Kansei 6, 18 of the prints come from &quot;Oshukubai Koi no Hatsune&quot; at the Miyako-za; 21 from &quot;Otokoyama Oedo no Ishizue&quot; and the &quot;jōruri&quot; &quot;Shinobu Koi Suzume no Irodoki&quot; at the Kiri-za; 15 from &quot;Matsuhamisa Onna Kusunoki&quot; and the &quot;jōruri&quot; &quot;Kagurazuki Iwai no Iroginu&quot; at the Kawarazaki-za; 4 are of sumo wrestlers, one of which is a triptych; and two are a memorial to . From the intercalary 11th month, 3 prints are from &quot;Hana no Miyako Kuruwa no Nawabari&quot; at the Miyako-za. By this period the artistry in Sharaku&#x27;s work has noticeably deteriorated and displays less of Sharaku&#x27;s individual touch.

Most of the &quot;hosoban&quot; prints distinguish themselves in Sharaku&#x27;s œuvre by having backgrounds of trees or other stage scenery, though a few have empty yellowish ones. Sharaku focuses on transitional poses as before, but the busier designs weaken the effect by drawing attention away from the actors&#x27; expressions to other elements of the composition. Most of the &quot;aiban&quot; prints are more typically Sharaku in that they focus on the upper body and facial expressions against an empty background, this time yellowish.

===Fourth period===

10 &quot;hosoban&quot; and 5 &quot;aiban&quot; prints make up the fourth period from the first month of Kansei 7 (1795). 3 prints come from &quot;Nido no Kake Katsuiro Soga&quot; at the Kiri-za; 7 from &quot;Edo Sunago Kichirei Soga&quot; and &quot;Godairiki Koi no Fūjime&quot; at the Miyako-za; 1 is a sumo print; 2 are &quot;musha-e&quot; warrior prints; and 1 is of the god of luck Ebisu.

==Style and analysis==

Energy and dynamism are the primary features of Sharaku&#x27;s portraits, rather than the idealized beauty typical of ukiyo-e—Sharaku highlights unflattering features such as large noses or the wrinkles of aging actors.

In his actor prints Sharaku usually depicts a single figure with a focus on facial expression. To Sharaku was able &quot;to depict, within a single print, two or three levels of character revealed in the single moment of action forming the climax to a scene or performance&quot;. In contrast to the static actor prints of a contemporary artist such as Katsukawa Shun&#x27;ei, who emphasized the narrative moment of his subjects in the plays depicted, Sharaku focused on the actor&#x27;s and character&#x27;s psychology, delivering an &quot;almost caricature-like exaggeration, a heightened sense of theatrical gesture&quot;, according to art historian David Bell. Occasionally two figures appear, revealing a contrast of types, as of different facial shapes, or a beautiful face contrasted with one more plain.

Most ukiyo-e artists gained apprenticeship experience and connections by working for an artistic school, such as the Torii or Utagawa school. Sharaku did not, which likely contributed to his failure to find a sufficient audience to succeed. Sharaku shows the skill of a master, despite scant evidence that he had prior experience designing prints. Nonetheless, from the first Sharaku&#x27;s prints appeared amongst the technical vanguard, with unusually realistic portrayals of their subjects and using extravagant techniques such as the dusting of mica in the backgrounds. From such beginnings, though, the quality of his work quickly fades.

To Jack Ronald Hillier, there are occasional signs of Sharaku struggling with his medium. Hillier compares Sharaku to French painter Paul Cézanne, who he believes &quot;has to struggle to express himself, hampered and angered by the limitations of his draughtsmanship&quot;.

==Identity==

Ukiyo-e artists had low social status, and what personal details remain in the record tend to be sparse; Sharaku nevertheless presents an exceptional case in the utter absence of these details. Biographers have long searched, but have had no luck in shining light on the identity of Sharaku. The popularity the prints have attained feeds interest in the mystery, which in turns contributes further to interest the prints. Of the more than fifty theories proposed, few have been taken seriously, and none has found wide acceptance.

A book on haiku theory and aesthetics from 1776 includes two poems attributed to a Sharaku, and references to a Nara poet by the same name appear in a 1776 manuscript and a 1794 poetry collection. No evidence aside from proximity in time has established a connection with the artist Sharaku. A Shinto document of 1790 records the name Katayama Sharaku as husband of a disciple of the sect in Osaka. No further information is known of either the disciple or her husband. A resemblance of Sharaku&#x27;s kinetic kabuki portraits to those of Osaka-based contemporaries Ryūkōsai and Nichōsai has further fueled the idea of an Osaka-area origin.

Rare calendar prints from 1789 and 1790 that bear the pseudonym &quot;Sharakusai&quot; have surfaced; that they may have been by Sharaku has not been dismissed, but they bear little obvious stylistic resemblance to Sharaku&#x27;s identified work.

Though disputed, Sharaku&#x27;s prints have been said to resemble the masks of Noh theatre; connections have been deduced from numerous documents that suggest to some researchers that Sharaku was a Noh actor serving under the lord of Awa Province, in modern Tokushima Prefecture. Amongst these documents are those that suggest Sharaku died between 1804 and 1807, including a Meiji-era manuscript that specifies the seventeenth day of the fifth month of 1806, and that his grave was marked in Kaizenji Temple in Asakusa in Edo. Other similar theories, some discredited, include those that Sharaku was Noh actor Saitō Jūrōbei, Harutō Jizaemon, or Harutō Matazaemon.

In 1968 Tetsuji Yura proposed that Sharaku was Hokusai. The claim is also found in the &quot;Ukiyo-e Ruikō&quot; (&quot;Various Thoughts on Ukiyo-e&quot;), and Sharaku&#x27;s prints came during an alleged period of reduced productivity for Hokusai. Though known primarily for his landscapes of the 19th century before Sharaku&#x27;s arrival Hokusai produced over a hundred actor portraits—an output that ceased in 1794. Hokusai changed his art name dozens of times throughout his long career—government censorship under the Kansei Reforms may have motivated him to choose a name to distance his actor portraits from his other work. As ukiyo-e artists normally do not carve their own woodblocks, a change in carver could explain differences in line quality.

Others proposed identities include Sharaku&#x27;s publisher Tsutaya or Tsutaya&#x27;s father-in-law; the artists Utamaro, , Utagawa Toyokuni, or Maruyama Ōkyo; the painter-poet Tani Bunchō; the writer ; an unnamed Dutch artist; or actually three people. Yet another proposed identity is the author Santō Kyōden; Tani Minezō points out that Sharaku&#x27;s brief career is concurrent with Kyōden&#x27;s temporary break from writing gesaku due to grief over the sudden death of his wife Kikuzono around 1793.

==Reception and legacy==

The Edo public reacted poorly to Sharaku&#x27;s portraits. More copies of the larger, first-period works remain, suggesting they enjoyed greater popularity than the later works; most for which only a single copy remains come from the later periods.

Contemporaries such as Utamaro who also worked in a relatively realistic style presented their subjects in a positive, beautifying way. Sharaku did not avoid depicting less flattering aspects of his subjects—he was the &quot;arch-purveyor of vulgarities&quot; to 19th-century art historian Ernest Fenollosa. An inscription on Utamaro&#x27;s portrait of 1803 appears to target criticism at Sharaku&#x27;s approach; appearing eight years after Sharaku&#x27;s supposed disappearance suggests that Sharaku&#x27;s presence was still somehow felt, despite his lack of acceptance.

The subject of an Eishōsai Chōki portrait of Takashimaya O-Hisa holds a hand fan decorated with Sharaku&#x27;s &quot;Kōshirō Matsumoto IV as Sakanaya Gorobee&quot;. On a decorated kite illustrated in Jippensha Ikku&#x27;s book &quot;Shotōzan Tenarai Hōjō&quot; (1796) appears Sharaku&#x27;s depiction of kabuki actor Ichikawa Ebizō IV; the accompanying text is filled with puns, jargon, and double entendres that have invited interpretation as commentary on the decline of Sharaku&#x27;s later works and events surrounding his departure from the ukiyo-e world, including speculation that he had been arrested and imprisoned. Ikku published under Sharaku&#x27;s publisher Tsutaya from late 1794, and the book is the earliest to mention Sharaku. The &quot;Ukiyo-e Ruikō&quot;, the oldest surviving work on ukiyo-e, contains the oldest direct comment on Sharaku&#x27;s work:

The &quot;Ukiyo-e Ruikō&quot; was not a published book, but a manuscript that was hand-copied over generations, with great variations in content, some of which has fueled speculation as to Sharaku&#x27;s identity. including a version that calls Sharaku &quot;Hokusai II&quot;. Shikitei Sanba wrote in 1802 of ukiyo-e artists, and included an illustration of active and inactive artists and their schools as a map; Sharaku appears as an inactive artist depicted as a solitary island with no followers. Essayist wrote in the early 19th century that Sharaku &quot;should be praised for his elegance and strength of line&quot;.

Sharaku&#x27;s work was popular among European collectors, but rarely received mention in print until German collector Julius Kurth&#x27;s book &quot;Sharaku&quot; appeared in 1910. Kurth ranked Sharaku&#x27;s portraits with those of Rembrandt and Velázquez, and asserted Sharaku was Noh actor Saitō Jūrōbei. The book ignited international interest in the artist, resulting in a reevaluation that has placed Sharaku amongst the greatest ukiyo-e masters. In his &quot;Chats on Japanese Prints&quot; of 1915 Arthur Davison Ficke declared, &quot;Sharaku stands on the highest level of genius, in a greatness unique, sublime, and appalling.&quot; The first in-depth work on Sharaku was Harold Gould Henderson and Louis Vernon Ledoux&#x27;s &quot;The Surviving Works of Sharaku&quot; in 1939. Certain portraits such as &quot;Ōtani Oniji  III&quot; are particularly well known.

Just over 600 copies of Sharaku&#x27;s prints are known; only about 100 remain in Japan. As they are in collections scattered throughout the world general research on Sharaku&#x27;s works has followed different threads in Japan and the West has proved time-consuming. Japanese researchers have better knowledge of and access to documents and literature related to Sharaku&#x27;s time and conditions. On the other hand, Sharaku&#x27;s works tend to be in Western collections, including prints for which only one copy is known—of which there are about three dozen. Sharaku&#x27;s &quot;ōban&quot; prints with mica backgrounds most likely cost more than the average, though prices can be only speculated due to a lack of records. Values of the prints today vary depending on size, condition, and subjective quality. Prices for them at auction have risen steadily from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries: for a print with a mica background sold in Japan prices jumped from a typical 15 yen (roughly a third of a banker&#x27;s initial monthly salary) in 1895 to 300 yen in 1915. Sharaku&#x27;s &quot;Arashi Ryūzō I as Ishibe Kinkichi&quot; sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for US$ in 1975, at Christie&#x27;s for GBP£ in 1989, and €389,000 at in Paris in 2009, setting a record auction price for a Sharaku print.

Identifying the period into which Sharaku&#x27;s work falls posed difficulties that have since become clear. The prints bear no dates. Kurth first proposed that they spanned the nine years of 1787 to 1795. Further research led Kazuo Inoue () to reduce the date span to 17 months from 1794 to 1795, which Henderson and Ledoux further narrowed to 10 months in those years. Such dates have been determined based on comparative research into theatre programmes and chronologies.

Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein believed that objective realism was not the only valid means of expression. He found Sharaku &quot;repudiated normalcy&quot; and departed from strict realism and anatomical proportions to achieve expressive, emotional effects.

1983 saw the appearance of the novels &quot;Phantom Sharaku&quot; by Akiko Sugimoto—a novel whose protagonist is Tsutaya—and &quot;The Case of the Sharaku Murders&quot; by Katsuhiko Takahashi. In 1995 Masahiro Shinoda directed a fictionalized film of Sharaku&#x27;s career, &quot;Sharaku&quot;.

<text>Sarah Lawrence College (SLC) is a private liberal arts college in Yonkers, New York, United States. Founded as a women&#x27;s college in 1926, Sarah Lawrence College has been coeducational since 1968. The college&#x27;s campus in Yonkers maintains a Bronxville mailing address and sits roughly 20 miles from New York City. In athletics, the Sarah Lawrence Gryphons compete in the Skyline Conference of the NCAA Division III.

==History==
===Establishment and development (20th century)===
Sarah Lawrence College was established in 1926 by the real-estate mogul William Van Duzer Lawrence on the grounds of his estate in Westchester County and was named in honor of his wife, Sarah Bates Lawrence. The college was originally intended to provide instruction in the arts and humanities for women. A major component of the college&#x27;s early curriculum was &quot;productive leisure&quot;, wherein students were required to work for eight hours weekly in such fields as modeling, shorthand, typewriting, applying makeup, and gardening. Its pedagogy combined independent research projects which were individually supervised by the teaching faculty, and seminars with low student-to-faculty ratio, a pattern that it retains to the present. Sarah Lawrence was the first liberal arts college in the United States to incorporate a rigorous approach to the arts with the principles of progressive education, focusing on the primacy of teaching and the concentration of curricular efforts on individual needs.

Harold Taylor, President of Sarah Lawrence College from 1945 to 1959, greatly influenced the college. Taylor was elected president at age 30, maintained a friendship with the educational philosopher John Dewey, and worked to employ the Dewey method at Sarah Lawrence. Taylor spent much of his career calling for educational reform in the United States, using the success of Sarah Lawrence as an example of the possibilities of a personalized, modern, and rigorous approach to higher education.

Sarah Lawrence became a coeducational institution in 1968. Prior to this transition, there were discussions about relocating the school and merging it with Princeton University, but the administration opted to remain independent.

===Larry Ray scandal (2010)===
Starting in September 2010, after being released from prison Larry Ray, born Lawrence Grecco (then 50), resided in the on-campus student housing dormitory apartment of his daughter, Talia Ray, in Slonim Woods Building 9. At the time, Talia was a sophomore at the college, and lived in the dorm with seven other students. Sarah Lawrence College later told &quot;New York Magazine&quot; that it was not aware that he had been living on campus. While there, Ray started a sex cult in which he presented himself to students as a former U.S. Marine with training in psychological operations. In 2011, he induced some students to move into the apartment of Lee Chen in nearby New York City. In 2013, four of Ray&#x27;s victims graduated from Sarah Lawrence. In February 2020, he was charged by prosecutors in Manhattan with conspiracy, extortion, sex trafficking, forced labor, and other related offenses, following nearly 10 years of alleged transgressions with students and former students. Ray was convicted on all counts and sentenced to 60 years in prison.

===College presidents===
The first president of the college was Marion Coats from 1924 to 1929. She was a friend of Vassar College president Henry MacCracken and William Van Duzer Lawrence. Coats had traditional views of women&#x27;s role in society that were at odds with her progressive approach to women&#x27;s education. Cristle Collins Judd was introduced as president in 2017.

==Academic rankings==


In 2007, criticism of rankings of U.S. colleges and universities, particularly their perceived impact on the college admissions process, gained national prominence due in part to the March 11, 2007, &quot;Washington Post&quot; article &quot;The Cost of Bucking College Rankings&quot; by Michele Tolela Myers, a former president of Sarah Lawrence College. As Sarah Lawrence College dropped its SAT test score submission requirement for its undergraduate applicants in 2003, thus joining the SAT optional movement for undergraduate admission, the college does not have SAT data to send to &quot;U.S. News&quot; for its national survey. Of this decision, Myers states, &quot;We are a writing-intensive school, and the information produced by SAT scores added little to our ability to predict how a student would do at our college; it did, however, do much to bias admission in favor of those who could afford expensive coaching sessions.&quot; At the time, Sarah Lawrence was the only American college that completely disregarded SAT scores in its admission process. In the same &quot;The Washington Post&quot; article, Myers stated that she was informed by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; that if no SAT scores were submitted, &quot;U.S. News&quot; would &quot;make up a number&quot; to use in its magazines. She further argues that if the college were to decide to stop sending all data to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, their ranking would be artificially decreased. Sarah Lawrence College now maintains a test-optional policy.

On June 19, 2007, following a meeting of the Annapolis Group, which represents over 100 liberal arts colleges, Sarah Lawrence announced that it would join others who had previously signed the letter to college presidents asking them not to participate in the &quot;reputation survey&quot; section of the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; survey (this section comprises 25% of the ranking). Despite this public stance opposing these rankings, the 2019 edition ranked Sarah Lawrence tied for the 65th best liberal arts college in the nation.

In 2022, &quot;Forbes&quot; rated it 467th overall in its America&#x27;s Top Colleges ranking, which includes 660 military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges. That same year, &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; rankings ranked Sarah Lawrence 155th in the liberal arts college category.

==Undergraduate admissions==
In 2024, Sarah Lawrence accepted 49.9% of undergraduate applicants, with admission standards considered exceptional, applicant competition considered average,
and with those admitted having an average 3.75 high school GPA. The college does not require submission of standardized test scores, Sarah Lawrence being a test optional school. Those accepted that submitted test scores had an average 1360 SAT score (15% submitting scores) or average 31 ACT score (6% submitting scores).

==Political involvement and activism==
Political activism has played a crucial role in forming the spirit of the Sarah Lawrence community since the early years of the college. As early as 1938, students were volunteering in working-class sections of Yonkers, New York to help bring equality and educational opportunities to poor and minority citizens, and the Sarah Lawrence College War Board, organized by students in the fall of 1942, sought to aid troops fighting in World War II. During a time when the college&#x27;s enrollment consisted of only 293 students, 204 signed up as volunteers during the first week of the War Board. During the so-called McCarthy Years, a number of Sarah Lawrence&#x27;s faculty members were accused by the American Legion of being sympathetic to the Communist Party, and were called before the Jenner Committee. Since that time, activism has played a central role in student life, with movements for civil rights and against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and for student and faculty diversity in the 1980s. Also in the 1960s, students established an Upward Bound program for students from lower-income and poverty areas to prepare for college. Theatre Outreach, the Child Development Institute, the Empowering Teachers Program, the Community Writers program, the Office of Community Partnership, and the Fulbright High School Writers Program are among the many programs founded since the 1970s to provide services to the larger community. In the late 1980s, students occupied Westlands, the main administrative building for the campus, in a sit-in for wider diversity. Students occupied Westlands again in 2016, in a sit-in supporting improved wages and safer working conditions for the college&#x27;s recently unionized facilities workers. For many years, the college has been considered as being at the vanguard of the gay rights movement and many other progressive causes.

==Campus==
Much of the Sarah Lawrence campus was originally a part of the estate of the college&#x27;s founder, William Van Duzer Lawrence, though the college has more than doubled its size since Lawrence bequeathed his estate to the college in 1926. The terrain is characterized by dramatic outcroppings of exposed bedrock shaded by large oak and elm trees. Many of the older buildings are in the Tudor Revival architecture style that was popular in the area during the early 20th century, and many of the college&#x27;s newer buildings attempt an updated interpretation of the same style. The campus is divided into two distinctive sections, the &quot;Old Campus&quot; and the &quot;New Campus&quot;: the first is roughly contained within the boundaries of the former Lawrence estate, and the area of the second was acquired sometime after the college&#x27;s earliest years.

The area outside the original Lawrence estate holds the college&#x27;s newer facilities. Several stately, century-old, Tudor-style mansions will be found among these newer additions, including Andrews, Tweed, Lynd, Marshall Field, and Slonim House: each was once a private estate, purchased by the college during periods of growth and expansion. The more modest Tudor houses along Mead Way, which also had been private residences, now serve as dormitories for students at the college. &quot;Slonim Woods&quot; is a group of newer, townhouse-style dormitories, built on the grounds of Slonim House.

The Campbell Sports Center was constructed in 1998 in response to an increased focus on physical fitness and sports. This facility includes an indoor pool, gymnasium, track, squash courts, and weight rooms.

In 2004, the college completed construction of a modern visual arts facility, the Monika A. and Charles A. Heimbold Visual Arts Center, with sleek architecture and environmentally friendly aspects which earned the college national press attention. Just down the road is Hill House, a six-story apartment building purchased by the college in the late 1990s that now lodges students. Across the street from Hill House is the large Wrexham house, also in the Tudor style, which the college purchased from the government of Rwanda in 2004; this building, once home to the Rwandan consul, has been renovated and is used for various postgraduate programs. At the opposite end of the campus stands the Science and Mathematics Center, completed in 1994.

===Buildings===

====Academic facilities====
* The Barbara Walters Campus Center is the newest building on campus. Finished in the fall of 2019, the building is named for alumna Barbara Walters. The building boasts a flexible multipurpose space which is used for dances, speeches, class gatherings, etc. On the second floor is the Barbara Walters Reading Room. It includes a rotating exhibition, but currently holds artifacts from Barbara Walters&#x27; life. The building has a green roof energy efficient LED lighting.
* Bates Center for Student Life is one of the original campus buildings. A huge facility designed in the English Tudor style that is common in the area, it has housed not just offices and classrooms, but everything from maids&#x27; quarters to dining halls to laboratories and arts facilities. At one time, it was home to a miniature basketball court that is now a faculty dining room, though the lines of the court can still be seen on the floors. Over the years, programs in science, visual arts, and physical education have grown to the point that they have spilled over elsewhere on the campus, requiring three buildings of their own. Bates has always been home to the college&#x27;s main dining facility and also houses the popular &quot;Health Food Bar.&quot;
* The Esther Raushenbush Library, designed in 1974 by Walter, Burns, Toan &amp; Lundein an architectural style meant to interpret in a more modern and sleek fashion the implied buttresses and strong features of its much older neighbor, Andrews House. The Raushenbush Library houses over 300,000 volumes.
* The Alice Stone Ilchman Science and Mathematics Center, completed in 1994, is situated on the far north end of the campus. It houses science laboratories in addition to classrooms and faculty offices. The building is named for former president Alice Stone Ilchman.
* The Marshall Field Music Building was originally created as part of William Lawrence&#x27;s residential neighborhood, Lawrence Park West. Built in the Georgian Colonial style, it was situated on of landscaped land when the college purchased it in 1960 to house the music department and to provide additional student housing. Prior to the purchase, President Harold Taylor played his clarinet in several of the rooms to test the acoustics.
* The Monica A. and Charles A. Heimbold Visual Arts Center The building was designed by Polshek Partnership Architects. Completed in 2004, the building has garnered national press for its &#x27;green&#x27; design. Relating to the college&#x27;s stated goals, the building engages the landscape and existing campus circulation patterns, promotes student engagement through transparency, and takes a leadership role in sustainable design. The jury applauded its inventive use of materials; consistent development of the project in relation to the original concept; well-integrated plan/section; and exemplary use of building siting, solar orientation, daylighting, and locally quarried fieldstone to achieve LEED certification. The American Institute of Architects awarded a special &#x27;Sustainable Architecture Honor Award&#x27; to the project as well as First Honor Awards at its 2005 &quot;Celebration of Architecture&quot;.
* The Campbell Sports Center One of the newest buildings on campus, the Sports Center was completed in 1997 and houses a swimming pool, a rowing tank, a weight room and exercise center, an indoor running track, squash courts, a basketball court, classrooms, locker rooms, and administrative offices.
* The Charles DeCarlo Performing Arts Center, remodeled and greatly expanded in 1974, is a large facility on the western end of the South Lawn. Named for former College president Charles DeCarlo, the complex comprises the Bessie Schönberg Dance Theatre, the 200-seat Suzanne Werner Wright Theatre, the 400-seat Reisinger Auditorium, the 117-seat Cannon Workshop Theatre modeled after Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre, and rehearsal spaces and work areas. The college bookstore is located in the PAC.
* The Ruth Leff Siegel Center, which is almost exclusively referred to as &quot;The Pub&quot;, was originally constructed as a gardener&#x27;s cottage on the Lawrence estate, then used as an infirmary and later as a faculty house. When the college began admitting male students in 1968, it became temporary housing for men. During the 1970s, the space was remodeled and christened &quot;The Pub&quot; for use as an informal dining hall and as a space for student activities. During the 1980s, it was renamed &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Place&quot;, honoring former President DeCarlo. In 1998, the entire structure was renovated, an addition was built by the architects Buttrick White &amp; Burtis, and the new complex took on its current official name. Today, it houses primarily a café serving on-the-go food, as well as two TV lounges.
* The Tea House, also known as the &quot;Tea Haus&quot;, because its façade evokes German architectural motifs, was originally a gazebo built by the Lawrence family on a small rocky hill on the north lawn of their estate. After being saved by a student petition from a demolition that was called for by architect Philip Johnson in 1960, it was converted to an enclosed building with large windows and a fireplace that now houses a café selling a variety of teas and baked goods. While it is a fact that the building housed the office of history faculty member Charles Trinkaus from the 1950s through 1970, there seems to be no evidence to support the persistent campus rumor that the Tea House was once the office of long-time faculty member Joseph Campbell.

====Administration buildings====
* Andrews Annex, built in the 1990s adjacent to Andrews House, houses a number of administrative offices.
* Lyles House is home to the college&#x27;s Health Services Center.
* The President&#x27;s House, built in 1921 and designed by architect Louis Bowman of McKim, Mead &amp; White, is an example of 16th century Tudor-style architecture. Its living room features restored carved beams, representing the various trades, from a 16th-century Tudor mansion in England. Additionally, above the mantel a Christian creation story is told in intricate wood carving. Campus legend dictates that a secret panel exists in the living room leading to a wine cellar, which was built during Prohibition. The President&#x27;s House has housed the college&#x27;s presidents since 1954, when the first President&#x27;s House, located north of campus, was demolished to make way for the Sprain Brook Parkway.
* Robinson House on Mead Way is home to the college&#x27;s communications department. Until 1952, it housed &quot;The Caf&quot;, a student coffee shop, on its main floor.
* Westlands is primarily an administrative building, but its top floor houses a number of student living spaces. Completed in 1917, it is the oldest building on campus and was home to Sarah Bates Lawrence and William Van Duzer Lawrence before being given to the college. Dynamically situated at the highest point of elevation on the campus, it is another example of English Tudor architecture by Bates &amp; How. When completed the home was pictured on the front page of the New York Times. It has been the heart of the campus throughout the history of the college and, owing to its massive size, it now houses the president&#x27;s offices, the Office of Admission, the Office of Financial Aid, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of International Programs, the Career Counseling Office, the offices of all of the college&#x27;s deans, and a number of meeting spaces in addition to the top-floor dorms.
* The Wrexham Road Property, acquired by the college in 2004, is a large manor house that once belonged to the government of Rwanda and used as a home for its consul. The building currently houses various graduate-level programs.

====Housing====
* Andrews House, a former manor house purchased for $200,000 by the college in 1935 from Arthur Lawrence, a son of the college&#x27;s founders, is known for its high ceilings, fireplaces, and its spiraling main staircase. The house is designed in the Germantown Colonial Style by architect Penrose Scott. The majority of the building houses students, but it is also the home of the college&#x27;s Department of Operations and Facilities and to the offices of Writing faculty.
* Andrews Court refers to the twelve cottage-style buildings to the south of Andrews House. Built in 1974, the buildings have, on average, about eight units each in addition to full kitchens, living rooms, and bathrooms.
* Tweed, a former manor house, is home to a number of large dorm rooms in addition to a pair of classrooms.
* Curtis is home to a number of dorms, and is also part of the Early Childhood Education complex.
* Lynd House, another former mansion, is home to mostly living spaces. The building&#x27;s adjacent carriage house has been converted into student housing.
* Hill House, bought by the college in the late 1990s, is a seven-story apartment building on the extreme southern end of the campus. At present, the majority of the apartments in the building are occupied by students, but a number of them remain in the possession of the original tenants who occupied them when the building was purchased by Sarah Lawrence. Most of the apartments are quite large and each has a full kitchen. Apartments on the upper floors with south-facing windows have, on clear days, a view of the Empire State Building.
* Kober is home to dorm rooms, but is also a part of the Early Childhood Education complex. It was donated to the college in 1951 by Otto Frohnknecht in memory of his daughter, Margaret Frohnknecht Kober, who graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1935. There was once a bowling alley in its basement.
* Morrill is the former maid&#x27;s quarters to the President&#x27;s House, and now is home to faculty offices.
* Slonim House was formerly a manor house that is now occupied by dorms and by the college&#x27;s Center for Continuing Education and Office of Graduate Studies.
* Slonim Woods is the group of 10 purpose-built living facilities constructed in 1977. They consist of eight single person dorm rooms arranged around a central communal living space.

=====Old dorms=====
The &quot;Old dorms&quot; refer to four original purpose-built student housing structures to the immediate north of Westlands in what is frequently referred to as the &quot;central campus&quot;. Dudley Lawrence, one of the sons of William and Sarah Lawrence, achieved the remarkable feat of constructing three of these buildings in one year (1926–1927). The halls were designed by William Augustus Bates, who repeated the Neo-Tudor style of Westlands through the use of stone and timber materials, and mansard roofs. The interiors are also in keeping with the English Tudor architectural style found on most of the older buildings in the area, with thick plaster walls, hardwood floors, and leaded windows (since replaced with more energy-efficient double-pane windows). MacCracken, built a few years later than the other three, is situated to the south of Dudley Lawrence. The original elegant living rooms that were found in each building, excepting MacCracken, are now used as classrooms.
* Dudley Lawrence, houses two classrooms in addition to living spaces. It is named for William Lawrence&#x27;s son, who oversaw the construction of the Old Dorms.
* OSilas, originally named Gilbert for one of the college&#x27;s original trustees, is the northernmost building of the four and is known for being quiet and populated with the college&#x27;s more studious set.
* MacCracken, named for Vassar College president Henry Noble MacCracken, is a few years younger than its neighbors and has, at various times, housed the college library, the bookstore, and a number of other facilities in addition to living spaces. Although it still serves as a dormitory, it now also houses dance studios, meeting spaces, and administrative offices.
* Titsworth is an all-girls dorm and was also named for one of the college&#x27;s founding trustees. It occupies the space between Gilbert and Dudley Lawrence and is also home to the Titsworth Lecture Hall.

=====New dorms=====

Designed by the renowned architect Philip Johnson in the sparse modernist style of the time, the &quot;New Dorms&quot; were completed in 1960. The architectural style of the buildings is meant to be a modernist reflection of the three older dorms (Gilbert, Titsworth, and Dudley Lawrence) that stand on the opposite side of the North Lawn. The three buildings that comprise the New Dorms are connected by two glass atria in which the buildings&#x27; primary stairwells are found. With the exception of the large apartments in Rothschild, these dorms typically house first-year students.
* Rothschild comprises apartment style, air-conditioned dorm spaces with kitchens, living rooms, and an elevator. The basement houses a number of small classrooms and studios in use predominantly by the theater department.
* Garrison is a traditional dormitory-style building with shared bathrooms.
* Taylor is nearly a replica in the design of its neighbor, Garrison.

=====The Mead Way houses=====
The Mead Way Houses are the eight former private homes that stand along the steep hill of Mead Way on the college&#x27;s eastern end. The two southernmost houses, Robinson and Swinford, are occupied by administrative offices and the studio of WSLC, the campus internet radio station, while the northernmost six houses, listed below, are reserved for student living spaces. The northern houses include:
* Brebner House
* Mansell House
* Morris House
* Perkins House
* Schmidt House
* Warren Green House

==Athletics==
Sarah Lawrence College is the member of Skyline Conference of NCAA Division III. The college sponsors intercollegiate teams in crew (rowing), men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, equestrian, men&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s softball, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming. In March 2011, the college announced that it would seek membership as a Division III member of the NCAA. The college began competing as a full member of Division III in the 2015–16 academic year after receiving a waiver to the required four-year &#x27;provisional&#x27; period.

The college left the Hudson Valley conference after the 2013–14 season and joined the Skyline Conference beginning with the 2014–15 season. The Skyline Conference contains several schools including SUNY Purchase and Yeshiva University which have played against Sarah Lawrence regularly over the past few years.

The college&#x27;s official mascot is a Gryphon by the name of Godric. It was chosen in the 1990s to represent the college&#x27;s athletic teams after a long period of fielding sports teams without one. Unofficially, the student body had long adopted the large resident population of &#x27;Black Squirrels&#x27; as a de facto mascot to the college. The position of silent mascot that the &#x27;Black Squirrel&#x27; occupied was financially endorsed by the college itself with the production of various Black Squirrel merchandise (including Sarah Lawrence clothing branded with the Black Squirrel image) and plush toys. It is only recently (post-2003) that efforts on the behalf of the college to establish the Gryphon as the icon of Sarah Lawrence have begun to take root.

==Notable people==

=== Faculty ===
Among the prominent current or recent faculty of the college are fine art photographer Joel Sternfeld, poet Suzanne Gardinier, novelist Melvin Jules Bukiet, novelist William Melvin Kelley, novelist Tao Lin, poet Marie Howe, film historians Gilberto Perez and Malcolm Turvey, puppet-theatre artist Dan Hurlin, dancer/choreographer Sara Rudner, Jewish historian Glenn Dynner, philosopher Michael Peter Davis, and economist Franklin Delano Roosevelt III. In 2005, current faculty member Eduardo Lago won the oldest literary prize in the Spanish-speaking world, the Premio Nadal. In 1934, Joseph Campbell was offered a position as a professor at Sarah Lawrence College which he held until his retirement in 1972. Perceptual psychologist Rudolf Arnheim was on the faculty at Sarah Lawrence College for 26 years, beginning in 1943. Author Grace Paley taught at Sarah Lawrence for many years.

<doc id="300331" wikidata="Q1779558" url="?curid=300331" title="Irene Adler">
<text>Irene Adler is a fictional character in the Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. A former opera singer and actress, she was featured in the short story &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, published in July 1891. Adler is one of the most notable female characters in the Sherlock Holmes series, despite appearing in only one story. While not technically a criminal and bearing no malice towards Holmes, she outsmarts him and evades his traps. Sherlock Holmes refers to her afterwards respectfully as &quot;the Woman&quot;.

Despite her brief appearance in the canon, Adler persists in many adaptations of Sherlock Holmes. While in the original, Watson notes Holmes has no romantic interest in Adler or in women in general, pointing out the detective only exhibits a platonic admiration for her wit and cunning, some derivative works reinterpret Adler as a romantic interest for Holmes or as a former lover who later engages in crime. Retrospectively, the original story is viewed as a more progressive and feminist interpretation of Adler. From the television shows &quot;Sherlock&quot; and &quot;Elementary&quot; to the film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, each portrayal depicts several notable qualities Adler possesses, such as her independence, adaptability, and intelligence; but a common issue pointed out with each portrayal is the attempts to mesh these qualities with seduction and manipulation.

==Fictional character biography==

Adler appears only in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;. Her name is briefly mentioned in &quot;A Case of Identity&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle&quot;, and &quot;His Last Bow&quot;.

According to &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, Adler was born in New Jersey or Chelsea, London, in 1858. She had a career in opera as a contralto or soprano, performing at &quot;La Scala&quot; in Milan, Italy, and a term as prima donna in the Imperial Opera of Warsaw, Poland. In Poland, she became the lover of Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and King of Bohemia. The King describes her as &quot;a well-known adventuress&quot; (a term widely used at the time in ambiguous association with &quot;courtesan&quot;) who has &quot;the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men.&quot;

Five years after their secret romance, it has been arranged for the King to marry Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meiningen, a young Scandinavian princess. However, he fears her conservative family would call off the wedding if any evidence of his former liaison with Adler were ever revealed to them. He fears she may attempt to blackmail him with a photograph of the two.

The events of the story unfolds when the King seeks out Holmes&#x27; skills to retrieve the photograph from Adler after multiple attempts have proved fruitless. In pursuit of information about Adler, Holmes witnesses her marry Godfrey Norton in secret. Despite this, Sherlock still tries to retrieve the photograph. However, Adler, aware of his plan, flees the country before they can catch her. Holmes has been outwitted.

His perspective on the investigation changes when Holmes realizes that he has been on the wrong side of the affair all along. In a handwritten letter addressed to him, Adler reveals that she has hidden the photograph simply for the purpose of protecting herself against the monarch&#x27;s wrath. She writes, &quot;As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged.&quot;

Holmes, who &quot;used to make merry over the cleverness of women,&quot; requests a photograph of Adler in lieu of an emerald ring from the King and leaves, &quot;without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him.&quot; He keeps her photograph locked up as a reminder of his respect for her intellectual prowess.

==Possible real-life inspirations==

Adler&#x27;s career as a theatrical performer who becomes the lover of a powerful aristocrat had several precedents. One is Lola Montez, a dancer who became the lover of Ludwig I of Bavaria and influenced national politics. Montez is suggested as a model for Adler by several writers.

Another possibility is the actor Lillie Langtry, the lover of Edward, the Prince of Wales. Writing in 1957, Julian Wolff, a member of the literary society The Baker Street Irregulars, comments that it was well known that Langtry was born in Jersey (she was called the &quot;Jersey Lily&quot;) and Adler is born in &quot;New&quot; Jersey. Langtry had later had several other aristocratic lovers, and her relationships had been speculated upon in the public press in the years before Doyle&#x27;s story was published.

Another suggestion is the dancer Ludmilla Stubel, the alleged lover and later wife of Archduke Johann Salvator of Austria.

==Analysis of Adler in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;==
Adler is a unique character within the Holmes stories. While most women in the canon are either victims, objects of desire, or in need of the detective’s help, Adler has a large amount of agency in the story. Unlike Holmes&#x27; other female adversaries, Adler is not explicitly a criminal nor does she need Holmes&#x27; help; she only acts to protect herself. Adler is also unique because she outsmarts Holmes — Holmes remarks in &quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot; that he has been beaten just four times: “three times by men, and once by a woman”, that woman is believed by some to be Adler.

Due to her intelligence Adler earns Holmes&#x27;s unbounded admiration, but he is not romantically attracted to her. When the King of Bohemia says, &quot;Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity she was not on my level?&quot; Holmes dryly replies that Adler is indeed on a much different level from the King. The beginning of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; describes the high regard in which Holmes held Adler:

Analysis of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; has also focused on how Adler diverges from Victorian social standards for women. She is unmarried at the beginning of the story, in opposition to &quot;the importance that the middle classes placed on the family unit&quot; at the time. Adler further defies gender norms by cross-dressing, donning male clothes with great comfort as demonstrated by her reference to them as her &quot;walking-clothes&quot;. Several authors have argued that Adler’s nonconformity is what leads to her victory over Holmes, as he makes deductions based on societal norms that she does not adhere to. Holmes underestimates her ability to detect his ulterior motives when he enters her home, then the detective is unable to recognize the cross-dressing Adler, and so does not know she is aware of his plot. This gives her time to abscond with the all-important photograph, triumphing over Holmes

== Portrayals of Adler in derivative works ==
In derivative works, she is frequently used as a romantic interest for Holmes, a departure from Doyle&#x27;s story where he only admired her for her wit and cunning. In his &quot;Sherlock Holmes Handbook&quot;, Christopher Redmond writes &quot;the Canon provides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes–Adler connection.&quot;

===Books===
In his fictional biographies &quot;Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street&quot; (1962) and &quot;Nero Wolfe of West Thirty-fifth Street&quot; (1969), William S. Baring-Gould puts forth an argument that Adler and Holmes meet again after the latter&#x27;s supposed death at Reichenbach Falls. They perform on stage together incognito, and become lovers. According to Baring-Gould, Holmes and Adler&#x27;s union produces one son, Nero Wolfe, who would follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a detective.

In two novels by John Lescroart published in 1986 and 1987, it is stated that Adler and Holmes had a son, Auguste Lupa, and it is implied that he later changes his name to Nero Wolfe.

A series of mystery novels written by Carole Nelson Douglas (1990–2004) features Adler as the protagonist and sleuth, chronicling her life shortly before (in the novel &quot;Good Night, Mr. Holmes&quot;) and after her notable encounter with Sherlock Holmes in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, in which the series features Holmes as a supporting character. The series continues with Adler’s other adventures in numerous locations around the world, showcasing her cunning and brilliance. Compared with later adaptations, Douglas’s mysteries have been praised for not “rel[ying] on Adler’s sexuality or appearance.” Douglas provides Adler with a back story as a child vaudeville performer who was trained as an opera singer before going to work as a Pinkerton detective. In the books, Douglas strongly implies that Irene&#x27;s mother was Lola Montez and her father possibly Ludwig I of Bavaria. The series includes Godfrey Norton as Irene&#x27;s supportive barrister husband; Penelope &quot;Nell&quot; Huxleigh, a vicar&#x27;s daughter and former governess who is Irene&#x27;s best friend and biographer; and Nell&#x27;s love interest Quentin Stanhope. Historical characters such as Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker, Alva Vanderbilt and Consuelo Vanderbilt, and journalist Nellie Bly, among others, also make appearances.

The young adult series &quot;Sherlock, Lupin and Me,&quot; by Alessandro Gatti under the pen name Irene Adler, is a four book series about the adventures a young Adler has with a young Sherlock Holmes and Arsène Lupin.

Adler appears as an opera singer in the 1993 pastiche &quot;The Canary Trainer&quot;, where she encounters Holmes during his three-year &#x27;death&#x27; while he is working as a violinist in the Paris Opera House, and asks him to help her protect her friend and unofficial protégé, Christine Daaé, from the &#x27;Opera Ghost&#x27;.

In the 2009 novel &quot;The Language of Bees&quot; by Laurie R. King, it is stated Adler is deceased when the book takes place and once had an affair with Sherlock Holmes. The story reveals she gave birth to a son, Damian Adler, an artist now known as The Addler.

A duology series by author Claire M. Andrews about Adler&#x27;s beginnings is set to be published in August 2025. The first novel, &quot;A Beautiful and Terrible Murder&quot;, explores Adler&#x27;s education and family history while she solves a series of murders at Oxford University alongside Sherlock.

===Comic books===
Marvel Comics character Destiny (Irene Adler) is a mutant with precognitive abilities. Destiny&#x27;s connection to Sherlock Holmes stories had long being teased through her lover Mystique&#x27;s past as a consulting detective, as both women were active in the late 19th century. &quot;Immortal X-Men&quot; #8 (2022) by Kieron Gillen explicitly canonized the connection, presenting Holmes as an identity used by Mystique and Destiny as her companion.

===Manga===
In the 2016 manga series &quot;Moriarty the Patriot&quot;, is featured as an expert cross-dresser and spy who impersonates the King of Bohemia to trick Sherlock Holmes and John Watson into taking her on as a roommate without pay. Later, the Moriarty brothers help her to fake her death to escape being assassinated, and she begins working for Mycroft Holmes and the British government under the guise of .

===Films===
In the 1946 film &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, Adler is mentioned early in the film when Holmes and Watson discuss the events of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia.&quot;

She is portrayed by Rachel McAdams in the 2009 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. In that film, she is a &quot;femme fatale&quot;. A skilled professional thief, as well as a divorcée, Adler is no longer married to Godfrey Norton, and needs Holmes&#x27; help for the case. She and Holmes are depicted as having a deep and mutual infatuation, even while she is employed by Professor Moriarty.

McAdams reprised the role in the 2011 sequel &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; in which Moriarty, deeming her position compromised by her love for Holmes, poisons and (apparently) kills her. Moriarty taunts Holmes about murdering Adler, and Holmes swears revenge, leading to their climactic battle at Reichenbach Falls.

===Radio===
Margaret Ward voiced Adler in a radio dramatisation of the short story &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; in 1954. The character was played by Gudrun Ure in a 1966 radio dramatisation of the same story. Both radio dramas aired on the BBC Light Programme. In 1977, Marian Seldes played Adler in the &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; radio adaptation of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;.

Sarah Badel portrayed Adler in the 7 November 1990 BBC Radio 4 broadcast of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; opposite Clive Merrison&#x27;s Holmes. Ellen McLain played Adler in the &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot; radio dramatisation of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, which aired on 17 June 2012.

===Stage===
Adler was portrayed by Inga Swenson in the Broadway musical, &quot;Baker Street&quot; which also starred Fritz Weaver as Sherlock Holmes. According to the liner notes of the original cast album, the story makes extensive use of the story &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;. The play opened at the Broadway Theatre, New York City, on 16 February 1965 and ran for 313 performances. The show&#x27;s book was by Jerome Coopersmith and the music and lyrics were by Marian Grudeff and Raymond Jessel; the production was directed by Harold Prince.

===Television series===
Adler was played by Olga Edwardes in the episode &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; in the 1951 TV series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

In the 1984 Granada Television series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Jeremy Brett, the first episode is &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, in which Adler is played by Gayle Hunnicutt.

In &quot;A Scandal in Belgravia&quot;, the first episode of the 2012 second series of the BBC &quot;Sherlock&quot;, Adler was portrayed by Lara Pulver opposite Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes. She is initially sought to recover incriminating photos she possesses of a liaison between her and a female member of the Royal Family, along with various other incriminating documents kept in a password-protected phone. 

In the CBS series, &quot;Elementary&quot;, Adler is initially an unseen character in the first season, mentioned first in &quot;Flight Risk&quot; (2012) as a former love interest of Holmes. It is later explained that she apparently died at the hands of a serial killer Holmes was investigating known as &quot;M&quot;, an event that fuelled Sherlock&#x27;s descent into heroin addiction. In &quot;M&quot;, Sherlock confronts M, revealed to be Sebastian Moran, and is told that Adler was not killed by Moran, but by his employer: Moriarty. In &quot;Risk Management&quot;, it is explained that Adler was an American art restorer living in London. Holmes discovers Adler is alive, having been kept as Moriarty&#x27;s prisoner in a dilapidated house. It is later revealed that Adler was a false identity assumed by Jamie Moriarty. Natalie Dormer played Adler/Moriarty in the final three episodes of the season.

In the 2013 Russian drama &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Adler takes a major role in the series and is portrayed by Lyanka Gryu.

In the 2014 Japanese puppetry television show, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, broadcast on NHK (日本放送協会, Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai, Japan Broadcasting Corporation), Adler is a school nurse of a fictional boarding school Beeton School. At first she has an affair with Headmaster Ormstein but takes up with another man Godfrey Norton who teaches art and sees through the plot of Holmes and Watson in &quot;The Adventure of the Headmaster with Trouble&quot; based on &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;. She is voiced by Rie Miyazawa.

Adler appears in the original anime television series &quot;Case File nº221: Kabukicho&quot; (2019–2020), voiced by Maaya Sakamoto. In the anime television series &quot;Moriarty the Patriot&quot;, Adler is voiced by Yōko Hikasa, taking on the male guise of James Bonde to work as a spy.

===Television films===
In the 1976 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes in New York&quot;, Adler (Charlotte Rampling) helps Holmes and Watson to solve a bank robbery organised by Holmes&#x27; nemesis, Professor Moriarty, after he takes her son hostage to prevent Holmes from investigating the case. Holmes and Watson later rescue the boy, with a final conversation between Holmes and Adler at the conclusion of the case implying that Holmes is in fact the boy&#x27;s father. This version of Adler is not an opera singer, but an actress.

Adler is featured in Soviet director Igor Maslennikov&#x27;s made-for-TV 5-part film series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot;. She appears in the fourth part, &quot;The Treasures of Agra&quot; (1983), based upon &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; (main storyline) and &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; (flashback), in which Holmes and Watson, while waiting for the new information on his current case, remember their encounter with Adler (played by Larisa Solovyova).

In the 1984 made-for-TV film &quot;The Masks of Death&quot;, a widowed Adler, played by Anne Baxter, is a guest at Graf Udo Von Felseck (Anton Diffring)&#x27;s country house where Holmes (Peter Cushing) and Watson (John Mills) are investigating the supposed disappearance of a visiting prince. Although Holmes initially considers her a suspect, she proves her innocence and becomes an ally.

In the 1991 television film &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady&quot;, Adler (Morgan Fairchild) reunites with an ageing Holmes (Christopher Lee) when a murder happens during her performance in Vienna. Holmes and Adler, whose flirtatious relationship with Sherlock is similar to &quot;Sherlock Holmes in New York&quot;‘s portrayal, briefly refer to past confrontations, including a rather confusing case where Adler had posed as a young boy to retrieve something hidden in Holmes&#x27;s safe. Adler also explains that she was married for several years (Holmes having last seen her at the wedding previous to the film), only for her husband to die of illness two years before the film&#x27;s events.

Liliana Komorowska portrayed Adler as a Polish opera singer in The Hallmark Channel&#x27;s 2001 made-for-TV film &quot;The Royal Scandal&quot; opposite Matt Frewer&#x27;s Holmes.

In 2007&#x27;s BBC Television production &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Baker Street Irregulars&quot;, Adler (portrayed by Anna Chancellor) is the main villain of the piece and one of Sherlock Holmes&#x27; archenemies instead of a potential love interest.

===TV episodes of unrelated series===
In an episode of the PBS Kids show &quot;Wishbone&quot;, actress Sally Nystuen Vahle portrays Adler for the adaptation of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; entitled &quot;A Dogged Espose&quot; (1995).

In the television series &quot;House&quot;, James Wilson tells a story about Adler, a patient with whom Gregory House was obsessed and fell in love, in the 2008 episode &quot;Joy to the World&quot;.

In &quot;The 10 Li&#x27;l Grifters Job&quot; (2011), the season 4 episode 2 of &quot;Leverage&quot;, the character Sophie portrays Adler at the Murder Mystery Masquerade.

In the season five episode of &quot;The Flash&quot; entitled &quot;Goldfaced&quot; (2019), detective Sherloque Wells meets Renee Adler (portrayed by Kimberly Williams-Paisley), the Earth-1 doppelgänger of his five ex-wives. She is later shown to be a metahuman with possible telekinetic powers; upon seeing this, Sherloque vows to protect her from metahuman-serial killer Cicada. During the episode, Sherloque also has an encounter with four of his ex-wives, all of whom are variants of Adler. Now that they know which Earth he is on, they demand their back alimony payments be met within a month, or they will have a multiverse-traveling bounty hunter come and collect the payments for them.

== Controversy of modern adaptations ==
Despite Adler&#x27;s brief appearance in the Sherlock Holmes canon, she has become the sole woman character the audience associates with Holmes in contemporary adaptations. With the character&#x27;s popularity, comes a significant change in canon where Adler is framed as a romantic liaison of Holmes. Heavier emphasis is placed on her &quot;body&quot; and physical representation by hinging on tropes of sexuality.

There is a claim that Adler is a feminist/proto-feminist character. Some argue that, Adler “serves as a feminist symbol within a literary series that predominantly praises masculine behavior” and shows that “even in 1891, strong feminist characters existed.” Due to Adler’s unique position of being a woman who outsmarted Holmes, many claim that she is a feminist character and therefore should be adapted as such.

On the contrary, some claim that, despite Adler’s outsmarting of Holmes, she should not be regarded as a feminist character. Although Alder is uncharacteristically independent, at the end of “A Scandal in Bohemia,” Holmes still comes to “acquire” her in the form of a photo, following the anti-feminist view of women as objects. There also is an argument that Adler still abides by female gender roles, seeking just to get married and be subservient to her husband. One notable proponent of this idea is Steven Moffat, creator of &quot;A Scandal in Belgravia&quot; who claims &quot;In the original, Irene Adler&#x27;s victory over Sherlock Holmes was to move house and run away with her husband. That&#x27;s not a feminist victory.&quot;As such, modern reinventions of Adler almost always attempt a &quot;post-feminist metamorphosis&quot; by providing her autonomy over her body where she can maneuver her sexuality to exert control over the male-centered narrative. Through a liberal feminist lens, Adler&#x27;s sexualized role names and confronts the power of men to the male audience in order to defy the patriarchal structure.

However, this deviation from the source material has become heavily criticized as problematic in nature. By &quot;sex-ing&quot; up her character, postmodern adaptations &quot;failed to re-appropriate [Adler] from its Victorian original by falling back on dominant masculine discourses.&quot; Critics attribute this deviation to the &quot;sensationist urge&quot; to make modern Victorian adaptations more &quot;sexy and sexual&quot; by &quot;introducing nudity and sexually risqué narrative elements.&quot;

=== &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009) and &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; (2011) ===
Guy Ritchie&#x27;s Adler is straightforwardly Holmes&#x27; love interest. In both films, she claims authority by weaponizing her sex appeal. Her power is mostly equated with her clothing or the absence of it. As opposed to the autonomous agency of Doyle&#x27;s version, Adler is an agent of Professor Moriarty and obeys his instructions without any independent arc of her own, functioning as a pawn and an intellectual inferior compared to her male counterparts.

In the scene where she dresses in front of Holmes, kisses him passionately and drugs him before leaving him handcuffed to the bed is observed by Rhonda L H Taylor that,

=== &quot;A Scandal in Belgravia&quot; (2012) ===
One of the most controversial takes on Adler is an episode of the BBC series Sherlock titled &quot;A Scandal in Belgravia&quot;. Her introduction was a response to criticism across the internet over the domination of male characters in the first season of the show while the female characters are always portrayed to be &quot;arrested, avenged, ridiculed or rescued.&quot; Adler is presented in the first episode as an antagonist who uses her sexuality through her dominatrix position in order to gain secrets and other information to blackmail her clients. In reality however, she is later revealed to still be under the mercy of the men around her, who still have the real authority and control. Critics point out that even in a dominatrix framing where the woman occupies a dominant role, they are still following the orders of their male counterpart and focusing on the satisfaction of a male consumer.

Some critics defended Adler&#x27;s portrayal in her initial scenes, pointing to moments when she physically overpowers Sherlock with a riding crop or when Sherlock fails to deduce anything from her naked body. In an interview to the Guardian, Steven Moffat, co-creator of the series defends this portrayal of Adler, stating, &quot;in the original, Irene Adler&#x27;s victory over Sherlock Holmes was to move house and run away with her husband. That&#x27;s not a feminist victory.&quot;

However, to most critics, the misogyny behind the character was shown in the final scenes. Adler&#x27;s power becomes temporary as she is revealed to be a confederate in Jim Moriarty&#x27;s schemes. As she remarks in the episode&#x27;s final moments, &quot;I had a bit of help. I had all this stuff, and never knew what to do with it. Thank God for [Jim Moriarty].&quot; Later, Sherlock claims victory over her by deducing her emotions with his cold rationality and Moriarty&#x27;s protection is lost and control over her is reinstated to Sherlock, once again encasing the autonomy of Adler within masculine boundaries. Critics point out that &quot;Irene fears bodily injury. Her phone, the sensitive information stored within it, both protects and endangers Irene&#x27;s body... its loss exposing her to physical harm&quot; and that between Sherlock, Moriarty or Mycroft Holmes, all three men have more power and resources to force Adler to be compliant in order to survive.

Critics also claim that her overall role in the episode reinforces the prostitution paradigm, that all women are sexual property of men. Rather than belonging to one man, Adler functions as &quot;public property&quot; and her only real use is her sexual function, following the trend of women&#x27;s role in the Sherlock series as &quot;conduit[s] for male power...as the object of sexual dominance, they are necessary to release that power. But they do not acquire power themselves; it is, instead, passed on to Holmes.&quot;

In her final appearance in the episode, a hijab-clad Adler is rescued by Sherlock from the hands of a terrorist cell in Pakistan. This scene garnered widespread criticism. In the essay &quot;Postfeminism and Screen Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes Stories: The Case of Irene Adler&quot;, Antonija Primorac observes,

By the end of the episode, the dangerously sexual female nude body of the metropolitan center is displaced into a Pakistani desert and transformed into a kneeling powerless bundle of indigo-blue wraps that set off her tear-sodden face. The luminous skin of her ‘battledress’, of the naked female body-as-weapon, is supplanted by a crestfallen figure in a hijab. In a stereotypically Victorian fashion that does not feature in Doyle&#x27;s text, Adler&#x27;s use of her own body as a means of power turns her into a fallen woman who has to be punished, banished to the former colonial space and saved by the hero.
==Name pronunciation==
Different pronunciations of &quot;Irene&quot; have been proposed for Adler. The traditional British pronunciation of the name is &quot;Eye-&quot;ree&quot;-nee&quot;, which has been used for Adler&#x27;s first name in some adaptations, including the BBC 1989–1998 radio series. The standard American pronunciation of the name, &quot;Eye-&quot;reen&quot;&quot;, would be appropriate since Adler is said to be from New Jersey. It may also be pronounced this way in modern British usage. This pronunciation has been used in television adaptations such as &quot;Elementary&quot;, &quot;Cashville&quot; and &quot;Sherlock&quot;. Another pronunciation, &quot;Ayr-&quot;ray&quot;-na&quot;, was used in the Granada television series. This pronunciation has a &quot;continental flavour&quot; fitting Adler&#x27;s career as an opera singer in continental Europe.

<text>Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (; also named Taiso Yoshitoshi ; 30 April 1839 – 9 June 1892) was a Japanese printmaker.

Yoshitoshi has widely been recognized as the last great master of the ukiyo-e genre of woodblock printing and painting. He is also regarded as one of the form&#x27;s greatest innovators. His career spanned two eras – the last years of Edo period Japan, and the first years of modern Japan following the Meiji Restoration. Like many Japanese, Yoshitoshi was interested in new things from the rest of the world, but over time he became increasingly concerned with the loss of many aspects of traditional Japanese culture, among them traditional woodblock printing.

By the end of his career, Yoshitoshi was in an almost single-handed struggle against time and technology. As he worked on in the old manner, Japan was adopting Western mass reproduction methods like photography and lithography. Nonetheless, in a Japan that was turning away from its own past, he almost singlehandedly managed to push the traditional Japanese woodblock print to a new level, before it effectively died with him.

His life was summed up by John Stevenson:

His reputation has only continued to grow, both in the West, and among younger Japanese, and he is now almost universally recognized as the greatest Japanese artist of his era.

==Biography: The early years==

Yoshitoshi was born in the Shimbashi district of old Edo, in 1839. His original name was Owariya Yonejiro. His father was a wealthy merchant who had bought his way into samurai status. At the age of three years, Yoshitoshi left home to live with his uncle, a pharmacist with no son, who was very fond of his nephew. At the age of five, he became interested in art and started to take lessons from his uncle. In 1850, when he was 11 years old, Yoshitoshi was apprenticed to Kuniyoshi, one of the great masters of the Japanese woodblock print. Kuniyoshi gave his apprentice the new artist&#x27;s name &quot;Yoshitoshi&quot;, denoting lineage in the Utagawa School. Although he was not seen as Kuniyoshi&#x27;s successor during his lifetime, he is now recognized as the most important pupil of Kuniyoshi.
During his training, Yoshitoshi concentrated on refining his draftsmanship skills and copying his mentor&#x27;s sketches. Kuniyoshi emphasized drawing from real life, which was unusual in Japanese training because the artist&#x27;s goal was to communicate the essence of the subject matter rather than to furnish a literal representation of it. Yoshitoshi also learned the elements of western drawing techniques and perspective through studying Kuniyoshi&#x27;s collection of foreign prints and engravings.

Yoshitoshi&#x27;s first print appeared in 1853, but nothing else appeared for many years, perhaps as a result of the illness of his master Kuniyoshi during his last years. Although his life was hard after Kuniyoshi&#x27;s death in 1861, he did manage to produce some work, 44 prints of his being known from 1862. In the next two years he had sixty-three of his designs, mostly kabuki prints, published. He also contributed designs to the 1863 &quot;Tokaido&quot; series by Utagawa School artists organized under the auspices of Kunisada.

==The &quot;Bloody Prints&quot;: capturing the public imagination==
Many of Yoshitoshi&#x27;s prints of the 1860s are depictions of graphic violence and death. These themes were partly inspired by the death of Yoshitoshi&#x27;s father in 1863 and by the lawlessness and violence of the Japan surrounding him, which was simultaneously experiencing the breakdown of the feudal system imposed by the Tokugawa shogunate, as well as the effect of contact with Westerners. In late 1863, Yoshitoshi began making violent sketches, eventually incorporated into battle prints designed in a bloody and extravagant style. The public enjoyed these prints and Yoshitoshi began to move up in the ranks of ukiyo-e artists in Edo. With the country at war, Yoshitoshi&#x27;s images allowed those who were not directly involved in the fighting to experience it vicariously through his designs. The public was attracted to Yoshitoshi&#x27;s work not only for his superior composition and draftsmanship, but also his passion and intense involvement with his subject matter. Besides the demands of woodblock print publishers and consumers, Yoshitoshi was also trying to exorcise the demons of horror that he and his fellow countrymen were experiencing.
As he gained notoriety, Yoshitoshi was able to have ninety-five more of his designs published in 1865, mostly on military and historical subjects. Among these, two series would reveal Yoshitoshi&#x27;s creativity, originality, and imagination. The first series, &quot;Tsūzoku saiyūki&quot; (&quot;A Modern Journey to the West&quot;), is about a Chinese folk-hero. The second, &quot;Wakan hyaku monogatari&quot; (&quot;One Hundred Stories of China and Japan&quot;), illustrates traditional ghost stories. 
Between 1866 and 1868 Yoshitoshi created disturbing images, notably in the series &quot;Eimei nijūhasshūku&quot; (&quot;Twenty-eight famous murders with verse&quot;). These prints show killings in very graphic detail, such as decapitations of women with bloody handprints on their robes. Other examples can be found in the strange figures of the 1866 series &quot;Kinsei kyōgiden&quot;, (&quot;Biographies of Modern Men&quot;), which depicted the power struggle between two gambling rings, and the 1867 series &quot;Azuma no nishiki ukiyo kōdan&quot;. In 1868, following the Battle of Ueno, Yoshitoshi made the series &quot;Kaidai hyaku sensō&quot; in which he portrays contemporary soldiers as historical figures in a semi-western style, using close-up and unusual angles, often shown in the heat of battle with desperate expressions.

It is said that Yoshitoshi&#x27;s work of the &quot;bloody&quot; period has influenced writers such as Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki (1886–1965) as well as artists including Tadanori Yokoo and Masami Teraoka. Although Yoshitoshi made a name for himself in this manner, the &quot;bloody&quot; prints represent only a small portion of his work. 

==The middle years: hard times and resurrection==

By 1869, Yoshitoshi was regarded as one of the best woodblock artists in Japan. However, shortly thereafter, he ceased to receive commissions, perhaps because the public were tired of scenes of violence. By 1871, Yoshitoshi became severely depressed, and his personal life became one of great turmoil, which was to continue sporadically until his death. He lived in appalling conditions with his devoted mistress, Okoto, who sold off her clothes and possessions to support him. At one point they were reduced to burning the floor-boards from the house for warmth. It is said that in 1872 he suffered a complete mental breakdown after being shocked by the lack of popularity of his recent designs.

In the following year his fortunes turned, when his mood improved, and he started to produce more prints. Prior to 1873, he had signed most of his prints as &quot;Ikkaisai Yoshitoshi&quot;. However, as a form of self-affirmation, he at this time changed his artist name to &quot;Taiso&quot; (meaning &quot;great resurrection&quot;). Newspapers sprung up in the modernization drive, and Yoshitoshi was recruited to produce &quot;news nishikie&quot;. These were woodblock prints designed as full-page illustrations to accompany articles, usually on lurid and sensationalized subjects such as &quot;true crime&quot; stories. Yoshitoshi&#x27;s financial condition was still precarious, however, and in 1876, his mistress Okoto, in a gesture of devotion, sold herself to a brothel to help him.

With the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, in which the old feudal order made one last attempt to stop the new Japan, newspaper circulation soared, and woodblock artists were in demand, with Yoshitoshi earning much attention. In late 1877, he took up with a new mistress, the geisha Oraku; like Okoto, she sold her clothes and possessions to support him, and when they separated after a year, she too hired herself out to a brothel. Yoshitoshi&#x27;s works gave him more public recognition, and the money was a help, but it was not until 1882 that he was secure.
A series of bijin-ga designed in 1878 entitled &quot;Bijin shichi yoka&quot; caused political trouble for Yoshitoshi because it depicted seven female attendants to the Imperial court and identified them by name. It may be that the Empress Meiji herself was displeased with this fact and with the style of her portrait in the series.

Yoshitoshi published &quot;&quot;Mirror of Famous Generals of Great Japan&quot;, a series of 51 works that depicted great men from Japanese mythology to the Edo period, from 1877 to 1882, and he further increased his reputation.

In 1880, he met another woman, a former geisha with two children, Sakamaki Taiko. They were married in 1884, and while he continued to philander, her gentle and patient temperament seems to have helped stabilize his behavior. One of Taiko&#x27;s children, adopted as a son, became Yoshitoshi&#x27;s student, and was thence known as Tsukioka Kōgyo.

In 1883, Yoshitoshi published &quot;&quot;Fujiwara no Yasumasa Gekka Roteki zu&quot; (&quot;Fujiwara no Yasumasa Playing the Flute&quot;) an ukiyo-e, based on an original drawing which was exhibited at the previous year&#x27;s exhibition of Japanese paintings. This work is based on &quot;setsuwa&quot; stories written in &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot; and &quot;, which were compiled between the 12th and 13th centuries, and depicts a bandit, Hakamadare, trying to attack Fujiwara no Yasumasa, who is playing the flute, but being unable to move because of Yasumasa&#x27;s silent pressure. This work is regarded as one of Yoshitoshi&#x27;s best.
Yoshitoshi&#x27;s notorious, yet compelling, &quot;Oshu adachigahara hitotsuya no zu&quot; (The Lonely House on Adachi Moor) appeared in 1885. This work depicts the legend of in &quot;Kurozuka&quot; written in &quot;&quot;, which was compiled in the 11th century, and &quot;Kurozuka&quot; is also performed in &quot;noh&quot;, &quot;kabuki&quot; and jōruri. This macabre work is iconic in its own right and influential in the history of modern &quot;kinbaku&quot;, in that Itoh Seiu was fascinated by Yoshitoshi&#x27;s accurate depiction of &quot;sakasa zuri&quot; (upside down suspension).

An 1885 issue of the art and fashion magazine &quot;Tokyo Hayari Hosomiki&quot; ranked Yoshitoshi as the number-one ukiyo-e artist, ahead of his Meiji contemporaries such as Utagawa Yoshiiku and Toyohara Kunichika. Thus he had achieved great popularity and critical acclaim.

By this point, the woodblock industry was in severe straits. All the great woodblock artists of the early part of the century—Hiroshige, Kunisada, and Kuniyoshi—had died decades earlier, and the woodblock print as an art form was dying in the confusion of modernizing Japan.

Yoshitoshi insisted on high standards of production and helped save it temporarily from degeneracy. He became a master teacher and had notable pupils such as Toshikata Mizuno, Toshihide Migita, and others.

==Later years: the eclipse of ukiyo-e==

His last years were among his most productive, with his great series &quot;One Hundred Aspects of the Moon&quot; (1885–1892), and &quot;New Forms of Thirty-Six Ghosts&quot; (1889–1892), as well as some masterful triptychs of kabuki theatre actors and scenes.

During this period he also cooperated with his friend, the actor Ichikawa Danjūrō, and others, in an attempt to preserve some of the traditional Japanese arts.

In his last years, his mental problems started to recur. In early 1891 he invited friends to a gathering of artists that did not actually exist, but rather turned out to be a delusion. His physical condition also deteriorated, and his misfortune was compounded when all of his money was stolen in a robbery of his home. After more symptoms, he was admitted to a mental hospital. He eventually left, in May 1892, but did not return home, instead renting rooms.

He died three weeks later in a rented room, on June 9, 1892, from a cerebral hemorrhage. He was 53 years old. A stone memorial monument to Yoshitoshi was built in Mukojima Hyakkaen garden, Tokyo, in 1898.

==Retrospective observations==

During his life he produced many series of prints, and a large number of triptychs, many of great merit. Two of his three best-known series, the &quot;One Hundred Aspects of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Thirty-Six Ghosts&quot;, contain numerous masterpieces. The third, &quot;Thirty-Two Aspects of Customs and Manners&quot;, was for many years the most highly regarded of his work, but does not now have that same status. Other less-common series also contain many fine prints, including &quot;Famous Generals of Japan&quot;, &quot;A Collection of Desires&quot;, &quot;New Selection of Eastern Brocade Pictures&quot;, and &quot;Lives of Modern People&quot;.

While demand for his prints continued for a few years, eventually interest in him waned, both in Japan, and around the world. The canonical view in this period was that the generation of Hiroshige was really the last of the great woodblock artists, and more traditional collectors stopped even earlier, at the generation of Utamaro and Toyokuni.

However, starting in the 1970s, interest in him resumed, and reappraisal of his work has shown the quality, originality and genius of the best of it, and the degree to which he succeeded in keeping the best of the old Japanese woodblock print, while pushing the field forward by incorporating both new ideas from the West, as well as his own innovations.

<text>Jacqueline Susann (August 20, 1918 – September 21, 1974) was an American novelist and actress. Her novel &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1966) is one of the best-selling books in publishing history. With her two subsequent works, &quot;The Love Machine&quot; (1969) and &quot;Once Is Not Enough&quot; (1973), Susann became the first author to have three novels top &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list consecutively.

==Early years==
Jacqueline Susan was born on August 20, 1918, at Lankenau Medical Center in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, the only child of a Jewish couple: Robert Susan, a Wilno, Imperial Russia (now Vilnius, Lithuania)-born portrait painter, and his wife, Rose ( Jans), a public school teacher. It was Rose who added the second &quot;n&quot; to her husband&#x27;s surname in order to make pronunciation easier for her students; Robert Susan retained the original spelling. Because his surname was never legally changed, his daughter was born Jacqueline Susan, as confirmed in the 1920 and 1930 US census, and her father&#x27;s record in the U.S. Social Security Applications and Claims Index, 1936–2007. Nevertheless, she used her mother&#x27;s version of the family surname.

As a child, her teachers reported that she was an inattentive but imaginative student. In the fifth grade, she scored 140 on an IQ test, the highest in her school. An only child and devoted to her father, Susann was determined to carry on the family name. She decided to be an actress, despite the advice of a teacher who said, &quot;Jackie should be a writer. She breaks all the rules, but it works.&quot; In 1936, after graduating from West Philadelphia High School, she left for New York to pursue an acting career. Her father told her, &quot;If you&#x27;re going to be an actress, be a good actress. Be a people watcher.&quot;

==Stage career==
In New York, on June 2, 1937, aged 18, Susann landed a small role in the Broadway company of &quot;The Women&quot;, the &quot;caustic&quot; comedy of manners by Clare Boothe that had opened on December 26, 1936, and would run for 657 performances. She subsequently appeared in such Broadway shows as &quot;The Girl from Wyoming&quot; (1938), &quot;My Fair Ladies&quot; (1941), &quot;Blossom Time&quot; (revival, 1943), &quot;Jackpot&quot; (1944), and in &quot;A Lady Says Yes&quot; (1945), which starred Hollywood siren Carole Landis. Only one of her shows following &quot;The Women&quot; was a hit: &quot;Banjo Eyes&quot; (1941), starring Eddie Cantor, ran for 126 performances.

Together with a friend, actress Beatrice Cole, Susann wrote a play called &quot;The Temporary Mrs. Smith&quot;, a comedy about a one-time movie actress whose former husbands interfere with her scheme to marry a man of wealth. Retitled &quot;Lovely Me&quot;, the play, directed by actress Jessie Royce Landis, and starring Luba Malina and Mischa Auer, opened on Broadway at the Adelphi Theatre on December 25, 1946. Said to be an &quot;audience-pleaser,&quot; the play nonetheless closed after just 37 performances. Four years later, Susann and Cole wrote another play, &quot;Cock of the Walk&quot;, which was to open on Broadway with Oscar-winning actor James Dunn. For reasons that remain unclear, the play was not produced.

In 1970, Susann made a brief return to the stage when she appeared in Blanche Yurka&#x27;s off-Broadway revival of Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;. Clive Barnes in &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned the production; of the cast, he praised only Yurka, but he did mention that &quot;Jacqueline Susann looks a great deal prettier than the publicity stills on her book jackets might lead you to believe.&quot;

==Television career==
From 1948 to 1950, Susann appeared on &quot;The Morey Amsterdam Show&quot;, a comedy series (telecast first on CBS, then on DuMont), in which she played Lola (later Jackie) the Cigarette Girl to Amsterdam&#x27;s nightclub emcee. In 1951, she hosted &quot;Jacqueline Susann&#x27;s Open Door&quot; (DuMont), the premise of which was to help people—most of whom had experienced hardships—find jobs. She appeared in such series as &quot;Danger&quot; (CBS), &quot;Studio One&quot; (CBS), and &quot;Suspense&quot; (CBS), but found herself typecast: &quot;I got cast as what I looked like—a glamorous divorcée who gets stabbed or strangled.&quot; In the summer of 1956, she appeared in NBC&#x27;s revival of the panel show &quot;This Is Show Business&quot;, which was produced by her husband.

In addition to her acting and hosting work, Susann did commercials. In 1955, she became spokesperson for the Schiffli Lace and Embroidery Institute. Over the next six years, she wrote, produced, and starred in commercials that aired during such shows as New York&#x27;s local &quot;Night Beat&quot; (DuMont&#x27;s WABN), with Mike Wallace, and then nationally on such shows as &quot;The Mike Wallace Interview&quot; (ABC) and &quot;The Ben Hecht Show&quot; (ABC). Sometimes she was joined on the air by her poodle, Josephine. Susann energetically promoted the product and made personal appearances on its behalf. One night in the early 1960s, as she was leaving a New York restaurant, Susann heard someone shout, &quot;There&#x27;s the Schiffli girl!&quot; Susann, realizing that 25 years of hard work had culminated only in recognition as the &quot;Schiffli girl,&quot; was discouraged. She later appeared in a 1971 episode of the crime drama &quot;Mannix&quot; (&quot;The Crime That Wasn&#x27;t&quot;, airdate January 29, 1971).

==Books==
===&quot;Yargo&quot;===
During the mid-1950s, Susann wrote a science-fiction novel called &quot;The Stars Scream&quot; (published posthumously as &quot;Yargo&quot;). In the early 1960s, she considered writing a book about show business and drug use, to be entitled &quot;The Pink Dolls&quot;.

===&quot;Every Night, Josephine!&quot;===
In 1962, after encouragement from showman Billy Rose, husband of Susann&#x27;s friend, Joyce Mathews (1919–1999; twice married to Milton Berle), she began to adapt into book form letters she had written about her beloved poodle, Josephine.

Published by Bernard Geis Associates on November 16, 1963, &quot;Every Night, Josephine!&quot; sold 35,000 copies in hardcover, and by 1973 sold 1.7 million paperbacks. This affectionate account of Josephine&#x27;s hijinks earned positive reviews and appeared briefly on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s best seller list, peaking at #8. In support of &quot;Josephine!&quot;, Susann undertook her first book tour, on which she was accompanied by the subject herself; often she and Josephine wore matching outfits. Even after publishing her novels, Susann cited &quot;Josephine!&quot; as her favorite of her own books.

===&quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;===

&quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; spans twenty years (1945–1965) in the lives of three young women: Anne Welles, the New England beauty who liberates herself from her staid small town by coming to New York, where she falls in love with the dashing Lyon Burke; Neely O&#x27;Hara, an ebullient vaudevillian who becomes a Hollywood star and self-destructs; and Jennifer North, a showgirl with little talent but a gorgeous face and figure, who becomes a friend to both. All three women fall prey to the &quot;dolls,&quot; amphetamines and barbiturates, a euphemism Susann coined. The book was published by Bernard Geis on February 10, 1966, and &quot;took off like a Cape Canaveral space shot.&quot; The story was said to be a &quot;roman à clef&quot;, with characters in the novel reportedly based on real-life celebrities such as Judy Garland, Dean Martin, and Ethel Merman.

Although &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, in an advance review, called the novel &quot;powerful and sometimes fascinating,&quot; the book received largely negative reviews. Gloria Steinem panned the book in &quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot; as did the reviewer in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called it the &quot;Dirty Book of the Month,&quot; and said, &quot;it might more accurately be described as a highly effective sedative, a living doll.&quot;

Despite the poor reviews, the book was a commercial juggernaut. On May 8, 1966, in its ninth week on the list, the book reached #1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, where it remained for 28 consecutive weeks. With a total of 65 weeks on the list, the book became the best selling novel of 1966. By the time of Susann&#x27;s death in 1974, it had entered the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the best selling novel in publishing history, with more than 17 million copies sold. By 2016, the book had sold more than 31 million copies.

In 1967, the book was adapted into the film of the same name, starring Barbara Parkins as Anne, Patty Duke as Neely, Sharon Tate as Jennifer, and Susan Hayward as Helen Lawson, the aging Broadway legend. Susann made a cameo appearance as a reporter at the scene of Jennifer North&#x27;s suicide. &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; received scathing reviews, but was a widespread commercial success, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of its year with $44.4 million at the domestic box office, a huge amount for its time. Susann herself hated the film; after its November premiere aboard the passenger liner, &quot;Princess Italia&quot;, she confronted the film&#x27;s director, Mark Robson, and stated, &quot;This picture is a piece of shit.&quot;

In 2001, author Rae Lawrence published a continuation of &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, titled &quot;Jacqueline Susann&#x27;s Shadow of the Dolls&quot; (Crown), which was reputedly based on notes left by Susann for an intended sequel. In its review, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; stated, &quot;This tedious, tame sequel is aptly titled, as it languishes deep in the shadow of the original... Susann&#x27;s original still packs a wallop; the sequel is a pulled punch.&quot;

===&quot;The Love Machine&quot;===

Susann&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Love Machine&quot;, is the story of Robin Stone, a ruthless but tormented executive in the cut-throat world of 1960s network television, and three women who love him: Amanda, the doomed fashion model; Maggie, the independent television personality turned movie actress; and Judith, the insecure wife of the network founder. Like &quot;Valley&quot;, the book was considered a &quot;roman à clef&quot;, with Robin reportedly based on former CBS president James Aubrey.

Published by Simon &amp; Schuster on May 14, 1969, the book was an immediate success: it spent 32 weeks (13 weeks at #1) on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and was the third highest-selling novel of its year. Reviews were not favorable; one reviewer in &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the book to &quot;popcorn... a kernel of an idea... exploded into bite-sized nothingness,&quot; while &quot;Time&quot; magazine complained that the book &quot;lacks Valley&#x27;s primitive vigor.

Film rights were sold to Columbia Pictures for a then-record $1.5 million. Directed by Jack Haley, Jr., the film adaptation was released in 1971, starring Dyan Cannon, Robert Ryan, and John Phillip Law. Irving Mansfield was executive producer but the film was a critical and commercial flop. Susann, who had loathed the film version of &quot;Valley&quot;, believed this adaptation was even worse.

===&quot;Once Is Not Enough&quot;===

Susann&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Once Is Not Enough&quot;, was published by Morrow on March 20, 1973. &quot;Once&quot; is the story of January Wayne, daughter of a famous film and stage producer, who is hospitalized in Switzerland for three years. When she returns home to New York City, she finds that the world is far different from the one she had left. January contends with the social upheavals of the late 1960s and early 1970s in a graphic, driving story. Susann was candid about the theme of the book, stating that it was one of &quot;mental and spiritual incest&quot;. After her death, film critic Andrew Sarris pointed out that &quot;If there is any single key to the oeuvre of Jacqueline Susann it is to be found in an extended Electra complex.&quot;

As with her previous novels, reviews were negative (a writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; complained of the book&#x27;s &quot;nearly 500 steadily monotonous pages&quot;), but sales were spectacular: the book spent 36 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, eight of which were at #1, and became the second highest-selling novel of 1973. Susann, with this book, made publishing history as the first writer to have three consecutive number one novels on the &quot;Times&quot; list. The book was filmed in 1975 by Guy Green as &quot;Jacqueline Susann&#x27;s Once Is Not Enough&quot;, with Kirk Douglas, Alexis Smith, Melina Mercouri, Brenda Vaccaro (in an Oscar-nominated performance), and Deborah Raffin. The film, executive-produced by Irving Mansfield, was not a critical favorite, but was a commercial success, grossing $15.7 million (the equivalent of $65.2 million in 2016).)

===Posthumous works===
Susann&#x27;s final work was a novella, &quot;Dolores&quot;, a &quot;roman à clef&quot; about Jacqueline Kennedy, originally written for the February 1974 issue of the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; (which became the best-selling issue in the magazine&#x27;s history). Susann&#x27;s manuscript, too long for the &quot;Journal&quot;, was cut, but the excised material was restored for the book publication on July 8, 1976. Despite harsh reviews and the absence of Susann as a promotional tool, the book spent 25 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list (seven consecutive weeks at #2), and became the third highest-selling novel of 1976.

&quot;Yargo&quot;, Susann&#x27;s romantic science fiction novel written during the 1950s, was published in February 1979 as a paperback original by Bantam Books. The novel is a radical departure from the works that made her famous. During the 1970s, Susann had spoken of future works. They included a novel about brothers who have their show business start in vaudeville, to be called &quot;The Comedy Twins&quot;; a novel about a poetess, &quot;The Heroine&quot;; a continuation of the story of Neely O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s sons; and her autobiography.

==Success==
Jacqueline Susann enjoyed the fame that her books brought. &quot;Confrontational, sassy, [and] entertaining,&quot; she appeared frequently on television, especially on talk shows. When asked what Ethel Merman thought of &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, Susann responded, &quot;We didn&#x27;t speak before the book came out. Let&#x27;s just say that now we&#x27;re not speaking louder.&quot; Referring to Philip Roth and his best-selling novel &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, notorious for its graphic descriptions of masturbation, she said to Johnny Carson, &quot;Philip Roth is a good writer, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to shake hands with him.&quot;

Not everyone was a fan. Gore Vidal said, &quot;She doesn&#x27;t write, she types.&quot; In July 1969, Truman Capote appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and announced that Susann looked &quot;like a truck driver in drag.&quot; On Susann&#x27;s next visit to the show, Johnny Carson gave her a chance to respond to Capote by asking, &quot;What do you think of Truman?&quot; Susann quipped, &quot;I think history will prove he&#x27;s one of the best presidents we&#x27;ve had.&quot;

==Personal life==
On April 2, 1939, Susann married press agent Irving Mansfield, who had impressed her by successfully placing &quot;items&quot; about her in the theater and society pages of New York newspapers. Despite persistent rumors of infidelity on Susann&#x27;s part, she and Mansfield were devoted to each other and remained married until her death in 1974.

On December 6, 1946, Susann gave birth to their only child, a son whom they named Guy Hildy Mansfield, &quot;Hildy&quot; being for cabaret singer Hildegarde, who was the boy&#x27;s godmother. At the age of three, Guy was diagnosed as severely autistic, and eventually had to be institutionalized; Susann and Mansfield did not reveal the true reason for his absence from home, fearing that he would be stigmatized should he eventually recover. The heartbreak from seeing their son in an institution reportedly was the impetus for her consuming pills for the rest of her life. Reportedly, Susann and Mansfield rarely missed a week visiting their son.

In 1954, the Mansfields adopted a black, half-toy half-miniature poodle, whom they named Josephine, in honor of comedian Joe E. Lewis. Josephine became the subject of Susann&#x27;s first published book, and was to be the subject of a sequel, &quot;Good Night, Sweet Princess&quot;, which Josephine did not live to write. Josephine died on January 6, 1970, just days before her sixteenth birthday.

In 1962, at the age of 44, Susann was diagnosed with breast cancer, and underwent a radical mastectomy. During her recuperation, she made a pact with God: if she were given ten more years of life, she would prove herself to be the best-selling writer in the world. With her diagnosis, Susann felt an urgency to make money as quickly as possible, to ensure her son would be properly looked after for the rest of his life.

On August 8, 1969, she was invited to visit Sharon Tate at her house for a dinner party she was holding, as Susann was residing nearby at the Beverly Hills Hotel. However, she elected not to go when Rex Reed dropped in for a visit; the next day, she was horrified to hear about the murder that occurred in the Tate residence. She reflected on this years later, stating &quot;It could all have happened a lot sooner if we&#x27;d gone to Sharon&#x27;s that night.&quot; 
Later investigators found multiple witnesses who declared that no party had been planned for that evening at the Tate house, which contradicts Susann&#x27;s account.

==Death==
After suffering from a persistent cough, Susann, who was concerned about her upcoming book tour in support of &quot;Once Is Not Enough&quot;, checked into Doctors Hospital on January 11, 1973. Test results showed a nodular lesion in her right lung; she was transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital for a bronchoscopy and biopsy. On January 18, she received a diagnosis of lung cancer, and immediately began cobalt treatments and daily chemotherapy injections. According to Irving Mansfield, there was some disagreement between doctors as to whether this was a metastatic breast cancer or an original lung cancer; accurate evaluation would determine the plan of treatment and subsequent prognosis.

Despite the grueling treatment, Susann&#x27;s cancer spread, and she entered Doctors Hospital for the last time, on August 20, 1974, her 56th birthday. After days lapsing in and out of a coma, she died on September 21. Her last words to Mansfield were, &quot;Hey, doll, let&#x27;s get the hell out of here.&quot; She was survived by her husband, her son, and her mother.

==Influence==
Jacqueline Susann is acknowledged to be the first &quot;brand-name&quot; novelist, a novelist who sells independent of critical attention. With her husband, Irving Mansfield, Susann revolutionized book promotion, and they are widely credited with creating the modern-day book tour. Michael Korda, editor of Susann&#x27;s &quot;Love Machine&quot; said in 1995 that, prior to Susann, &quot;people weren&#x27;t so much interested in selling books as they were in publishing them.&quot; To what had once been considered a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s profession,&quot; she brought a show business sensibility. She toured extensively in support of each book, making appearances at bookstores and on countless television and radio shows. Her books were advertised on the entertainment pages of major newspapers, and Mansfield tested her book covers to see how they appeared on television. She even served coffee and doughnuts to the truck drivers who would be delivering her books. She lavished attention on booksellers, sending them thank you notes, and even bought copies of her book for bookstore clerks. &quot;A new book is like a new brand of detergent,&quot; she said. &quot;You have to let the public know about it. What&#x27;s wrong with that?&quot;

==Depictions==
In 1998, Susann was played by actress Michele Lee in the television film &quot;Scandalous Me: The Jacqueline Susann Story&quot; (USA), based on Barbara Seaman&#x27;s biography &quot;Lovely Me: The Life of Jacqueline Susann&quot;. Peter Riegert played Mansfield; also in the cast was Barbara Parkins (who played Anne in the 1967 film adaptation of &quot;Valley&quot;) as agent Annie Laurie Williams. The film was not well-reviewed, with &quot;Variety&quot; writing, &quot;None of the storied genius that Susann exhibited in promoting herself along with her books is much in evidence. ... [it is] a movie that broadly captures all of the famed author&#x27;s flaws but none of her essence.&quot;

&quot;Scandalous Me&quot; was followed in 2000 by the theatrical film &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Great&quot;, based on a &quot;New Yorker&quot; profile by Michael Korda, with Bette Midler and Nathan Lane. The film was not well-received critically and was a box office bomb, with a worldwide gross of just $3 million on a $44 million budget. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Jackie Susann deserved better.&quot; Midler was nominated for a Razzie award as Worst Actress for her performance.

In November 2001, &quot;Paper Doll&quot;, a play by Mark Hampton and Barbara Zitwer, premiered at the Pittsburgh Public Theater, with Marlo Thomas as Susann and F. Murray Abraham as Mansfield. Reviews were mixed, but the production was a hit with audiences. Fran Drescher was reportedly cast for the Broadway production, but that production was cancelled.

Susann was also the subject of a one-woman play by Paul Minx called &quot;See How Beautiful I Am: The Return of Jackie Susann&quot;, during which a dying Susann discusses her life and career. The show was performed as part of the Edinburgh Festival in 2001 as well as the New York International Fringe Festival in 2008.

== In popular culture ==
Susann is mentioned by name (along with Harold Robbins) in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; by Admiral James T. Kirk. His first officer, Spock, then comments that Susann was one of the 20th century &quot;giants&quot; of literature.

She is mentioned by name in the chorus of the song &quot;Adult Books&quot; by the band X. The song is featured on their 1981 album &quot;Wild Gift&quot;.

In the TV series &quot;Endeavour&quot; (season 6, episode 2, &quot;Apollo&quot;), Susann is mentioned. One of the characters says: &quot;I had a solitary dinner and took Jacqueline Susann to bed.&quot;

<doc id="300343" wikidata="Q93049" url="?curid=300343" title="List of municipalities in Albacete">
<text>Albacete is a province in the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha, Spain, that is divided into 87 municipalities. Spanish census, the province is the 35th largest by population, with inhabitants, and the 9th largest by land area, spanning . Municipalities are the basic local political division in Spain, and can only belong to one province. They enjoy a large degree of autonomy in their local administration, being in charge of tasks such as urban planning, water supply, lighting, roads, local police, and firefighting.

The organisation of municipalities in Spain is outlined in a local government law (; ) passed on 2 April 1985 and finalised by an 18 April 1986 royal decree. The Statute of Autonomy of Castilla–La Mancha also contains provisions concerning the relations between the municipalities and the autonomous government of Castilla–La Mancha. All citizens of Spain are required to register in the municipality in which they reside. Each municipality is a corporation with independent legal personhood: its governing body is called the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; (municipal council or corporation), a term often also used to refer to the municipal offices (city and town halls). The &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; is composed of the mayor (), the deputy mayors (&quot;tenientes de alcalde&quot;) and the plenary assembly (&quot;pleno&quot;) of councillors (&quot;concejales&quot;). Municipalities are categorised by population for the purpose of determining the number of councillors: three when the population is up to 100 inhabitants, five for 101250, seven for 2511,000, nine for 1,0012,000, eleven for 2,0015,000, thirteen for 5,00110,000, seventeen for 10,00120,000, twenty-one for 20,00150,000, and twenty-five for 50,001100,000. One councillor is added for every additional 100,000 inhabitants, with a further one added when the number of councillors based on this methodology would be even in order to prevent tied votes.

The mayor and the deputy mayors are elected by the plenary assembly, which is itself elected by universal suffrage. Elections in municipalities with more than 250 inhabitants are carried out following a proportional representation system with closed lists, whilst those with a population lower than 250 use a block plurality voting system with open lists. The plenary assembly must meet periodically at the seat of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot;, with meetings occurring more or less frequently depending on the population of the municipality: monthly for those whose population is larger than 20,000, once every two months if it ranges between 5,001 and 20,000, and once every three months if it does not exceed 5,000. Many &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; also have a local governing board (), which is named by the mayor from amongst the councillors and is required for municipalities of more than 5,000 inhabitants. The board, whose role is to assist the mayor between meetings of the plenary assembly, may not include more than one third of the councillors.

The largest municipality by population in the province as of the 2023 Spanish census is Albacete, its capital, with 173,202 residents, while the smallest is Villa de Ves, with 61 residents. The largest municipality by area is also Albacete, which spans 1,126.98 km², while Cotillas is the smallest at 14.46 km².

<text>Dale Leon Bumpers (August 12, 1925 – January 1, 2016) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 38th Governor of Arkansas (1971–1975) and in the United States Senate (1975–1999). He was a member of the Democratic Party. He was counsel at the Washington office of law firm Arent Fox LLP, where his clients included Riceland Foods and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.

==Background==
Bumpers was born August 12, 1925, in Charleston in Franklin County, in west central Arkansas, near the larger city of Fort Smith, the son of William Rufus Bumpers, who served in the Arkansas House of Representatives in the early 1930s, and the former Lattie Jones (1889–1949). Bumpers&#x27;s brother, Raymond J. Bumpers, died of dysentery. Another older brother, Carroll Bumpers, was born in 1921. He also had a sister named Margaret. Bumpers&#x27;s parents died five days apart in March 1949 of injuries sustained in an automobile accident; the couple are interred at Nixon Cemetery in Franklin County.

Bumpers attended public schools and the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1943 to 1946 during World War II. Bumpers graduated from Northwestern University Law School in Chicago, in 1951. From his time in Illinois, he became a great admirer of Adlai Stevenson, II, the Democratic presidential candidate in 1952 and 1956. Bumpers was admitted to the Arkansas bar in 1952 and began practicing law in his hometown that same year. He was from 1952 to 1970 the Charleston city attorney. While serving as city attorney, he convinced the school board to accept the Brown v. Board of Education ruling integrating public schools. Charleston was the first School District in the former Confederate South to fully integrate, an accomplishment that Bumpers was very proud of. He served as special justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1968.

Bumpers lost his 1962 bid for the same state House seat once represented by his father, who had wanted to run for the United States House of Representatives but could not amass the funding to do so.

==Governor of Arkansas==

Bumpers was virtually unknown when he announced his campaign for governor in 1970. However, his oratorical skills, personal charm, and outsider image put him in a runoff election for the Democratic nomination with former governor Orval Faubus. Bumpers defeated Faubus in the runoff, then defeated the incumbent Republican governor Winthrop Rockefeller in November. Bumpers was often described as a new kind of Southern Democrat who would bring reform to his state and the Democratic Party. His victory over Rockefeller ushered in a new era of youthful reform-minded governors, including two of his successors, David Pryor (who would later serve alongside Bumpers in the Senate) and future U.S. President Bill Clinton.

Dan Durning reports that Bumpers&#x27; foremost objective was to streamline the state government by reducing the number of agencies under his office. Bumpers accomplished this by reassigning 60 major agencies to 13 cabinet-level departments, which enhanced his decision-making power and implementation capacity. Unlike Rockefeller, who could not overcome special interest groups, Bumpers achieved this reorganization with remarkable success. The momentum propelled his substantive program. Bumpers spearheaded legislative reforms to create a more progressive tax system; top rates moved from 5% to 7%. This significantly boosted state revenues as the state industrialized and generated well-paid employees and executives. He utilized the additional revenue to increase teacher salaries and improve schools, which helped him in a major voting bloc. Bumpers opposed sales tax increases, because they were regressive. Despite requiring a 3/4 majority to pass both houses, the tax measures passed, leaving a lasting legacy. Other notable legislative achievements included a home rule law, the creation of a consumer protection division, repeal of some liquor laws, and upgrades to prison facilities. In a special session in 1972, significant programs were approved to upgrade county social services for the elderly, the handicapped, and the mentally disabled. Though some of Bumpers&#x27; initiatives failed, such as the proposed limitation on campaign expenditures, his overall success energized his statewide coalition for his successful re-election campaign in 1972.

According to Dan Durning&#x27;s account, Bumpers succeeded in achieving more reforms during the 1973 General Assembly, with a particular focus on education. The reforms included the establishment of a state-supported kindergarten program, provision of free textbooks for high school students, increased support for the education of children with disabilities, salary hikes and better retirement benefits for teachers, a major construction program for state colleges and universities, and encouragement of community college programs by extending state coverage of operational costs. Nonetheless, Bumpers&#x27; proposals to allocate $10 million for the purchase of wilderness and scenic lands, and to approve the Equal Rights Amendment for women, were both turned down by the legislature.

Dan Durning argues that Bumpers&#x27;s legislative proposals achieved remarkable success due to various factors. First, Bumpers enjoyed strong public support as he had defeated the disliked Republican governor Winthrop Rockefeller. Secondly, the newly elected general assembly in 1971 was more open to change than previous ones, owing to new members especially from cities, and the decline of the old guard men from rural counties. Thirdly, Bumper&#x27;s striking ability to use personal persuasion helped him establish favorable relationships with key players in the political establishment. Finally, Bumper&#x27;s independence from any special interest groups allowed him to pursue his own agenda without any obligations.

==U.S. Senate elections==
Bumpers was elected to the United States Senate in 1974. He unseated the long-term incumbent J. William Fulbright in the Democratic primary by a wide margin and then faced the Republican banker John Harris Jones. Jones accused Bumpers of excessive spending as governor, citing the construction of a $186 million state office complex. Bumpers not only ignored Jones but instead campaigned mostly for the young Democrat Bill Clinton, who failed in that heavily Democratic year to unseat Republican U.S. Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt in Arkansas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district. Bumpers polled 461,056 votes (84.9%) to Jones&#x27;s 82,026 (15.1%), the weakest Republican showing since Fulbright won in 1944.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;many to their sorrow have had trouble taking Bumpers seriously ... Dandy Dale, the man with one speech, a shoeshine, and a smile.&quot;

In 1980, Bumpers comfortably survived, 477,905 votes (59.1 percent) to 330,576 (40.9 percent), the Ronald Reagan victory in Arkansas by defeating the Republican candidate, William P. &quot;Bill&quot; Clark (born 1943), a Little Rock investment banker who filed for the Senate only one hour prior to the deadline. (This William Clark is unrelated to the Reagan confidante William P. Clark Jr. (1931–2013)). In his unsuccessful 1976 race as a Democrat for Arkansas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district seat, &quot;Bill&quot; Clark had passed out twenty thousand Clark candy bars but received fewer votes and was saddled with an unpaid campaign debt exceeding $30,000. Clark accused Bumpers of being &quot;fuzzy on the issues&quot; and challenged Bumpers&#x27;s support for gasoline rationing during the energy crisis. Clark criticized Bumpers for having voted against defense appropriations twenty-three times between 1975 and 1978 and noted, &quot;Only this year [when seeking reelection] he has voted for a couple of defense items.&quot; Clark questioned Bumpers&#x27;s opposition to school prayer and support for the Panama Canal Treaties of 1978, an issue which Reagan had used against President Jimmy Carter as well. Clark further claimed that Bumpers had derided citizens of Newton County, a frequent Republican stronghold in Arkansas, as &quot;stupid hill people&quot;. Newton County in turn cast 57.2 percent of its votes for Clark, who prevailed in twelve of the state&#x27;s seventy-five counties, mostly those in the northwestern section of the state. Clark also carried Bumpers&#x27;s home county of Franklin. The Republican hopeful asked voters, &quot;If Dale Bumpers doesn&#x27;t vote for you, why should you vote for him?&quot;

Unlike Bumpers, Bill Clinton lost in the Reagan electoral vote landslide, temporarily sidelined by the Republican Frank D. White. In 1986, Bumpers defeated his Republican opponent, later U.S. Representative for Arkansas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district and Governor Asa Hutchinson. In 1992, after besting State Auditor Julia Hughes Jones with 64 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary, he defeated future governor Mike Huckabee in the general election. The next year, Jones switched to the GOP and unsuccessfully ran for secretary of state in 1994. In 1998, when Bumpers retired, the Democratic choice, former U. S. Representative Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas&#x27;s 1st congressional district, comfortably defeated the Republican nominee, Fay Boozman, a state senator who was later the Arkansas Department of Health director under Governor Huckabee.

===Senate tenure===
Bumpers was elected to the Senate four times, beginning with his huge victory over Fulbright, the veteran chairman of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Bumpers chaired the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship from 1987 until 1995, when the GOP took control of the Senate for a dozen years following the 1994 elections. Bumpers served as ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources from 1997 until his retirement in 1999. In the Senate, Bumpers was known for his oratorical skills and for his prodigious respect for the Constitution of the United States. He never supported any constitutional amendment.

Bumpers decided not to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, despite support from many colleagues, including Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, who ultimately also contested the 1988 nomination won by Michael Dukakis. Initially named as one of Walter Mondale&#x27;s top potential choices for his vice presidential running mate in 1984, he took his name out of the running early in the process.

Bumpers stated that his main reason for not running was fear of &quot;a total disruption of the closeness my family has cherished.&quot; Many observers felt that Bumpers perhaps lacked the obsessive ambition required of a presidential candidate, especially one who would have started out the process with low name identification. Another factor often mentioned was Bumpers&#x27;s key vote in killing labor law reform in 1978, a vote that angered organized labor and had clearly not been forgotten by labor leaders nearly a decade later.

===Clinton impeachment===
After his retirement from the Senate, Bumpers, a self-declared close friend of President Clinton, acted as defense attorney during Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial. He gave an impassioned closing argument during the Senate trial.
Quotes from the closing argument of the White House presentation, January 21, 1999:

==Honors==
In 1995, the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville founded the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences in his honor.

In 2014, the White River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas was renamed &quot;Dale Bumpers White River National Wildlife Refuge&quot;. At a dedication ceremony, Daniel M. Ashe, director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, said:
The Service is proud to recognize the many contributions Senator Bumpers has made to give many future generations the same opportunity to enjoy Arkansas&#x27; natural beauty as we have had. He is a giant among conservationists and a visionary who followed an unconventional path to set aside some of Arkansas&#x27; last wild places. It is fitting that he will be forever linked with the White River.

==Causes==
Bumpers and his wife Betty were both known for their dedication to the cause of childhood immunization. The Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institutes of Health was established by former president Clinton to facilitate research in vaccine development.

Early in his legal career, the Charleston School Board asked his advice on how it should respond to the Supreme Court decision in the 1954 case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas&quot;, which found the segregation of public schools on the basis of race to be unconstitutional. Bumpers advised the school board to comply with the decision immediately. In July 1954, the board voted to desegregate its schools, and on August 23, 1954, the school year began with eleven African-American children attending schools in Charleston. This prompt action to desegregate public schools was rare: The Charleston School District was the first in the eleven states that comprised the former Confederacy to integrate their public schools following the Supreme Court decision.

Bumpers opposed constitutional amendments throughout his Senate tenure and was critical of his Republican colleague Jesse Helms for attempting that route to enact conservative policy proposals. However, Bumpers said that he worked well with Republican leaders Howard Baker and Bob Dole.

==Death==
After a period of failing health, Bumpers died on January 1, 2016, at his home in Little Rock at the age of 90. He had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and had sustained a broken hip shortly before his death.

==Bumpers in fiction==
In Jeffrey Archer&#x27;s 1977 novel &quot;Shall We Tell the President?&quot;, Bumpers was elected as the Vice President of the United States in a ticket headed by Ted Kennedy, defeating Ronald Reagan during the 1984 election. In the 1986 revised edition of the novel, Archer replaced Kennedy with the fictional character of Florentyna Kane, and Bumpers with the real-life Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.

<doc id="300355" wikidata="Q93047" url="?curid=300355" title="List of municipalities in Alicante">
<text>Alicante (&quot;Alacant&quot; in Valencian) is a province in the autonomous community of Valencia, Spain, that is divided into 141 municipalities. Spanish census, the province is the 5th largest by population, with inhabitants, and the 41st largest by land area, spanning . Municipalities are the basic local political division in Spain, and can only belong to one province. They enjoy a large degree of autonomy in their local administration, being in charge of tasks such as urban planning, water supply, lighting, roads, local police, and firefighting.

The organisation of municipalities in Spain is outlined in a local government law (; ) passed on 2 April 1985 and finalised by an 18 April 1986 royal decree. The Statute of Autonomy of Castilla–La Mancha also contains provisions concerning the relations between the municipalities and the autonomous government of Castilla–La Mancha. All citizens of Spain are required to register in the municipality in which they reside. Each municipality is a corporation with independent legal personhood: its governing body is called the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; (municipal council or corporation), a term often also used to refer to the municipal offices (city and town halls). The &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; is composed of the mayor (), the deputy mayors (&quot;tenientes de alcalde&quot;) and the plenary assembly (&quot;pleno&quot;) of councillors (&quot;concejales&quot;). Municipalities are categorised by population for the purpose of determining the number of councillors: three when the population is up to 100 inhabitants, five for 101250, seven for 2511,000, nine for 1,0012,000, eleven for 2,0015,000, thirteen for 5,00110,000, seventeen for 10,00120,000, twenty-one for 20,00150,000, and twenty-five for 50,001100,000. One councillor is added for every additional 100,000 inhabitants, with a further one added when the number of councillors based on this methodology would be even in order to prevent tied votes.

The mayor and the deputy mayors are elected by the plenary assembly, which is itself elected by universal suffrage. Elections in municipalities with more than 250 inhabitants are carried out following a proportional representation system with closed lists, whilst those with a population lower than 250 use a block plurality voting system with open lists. The plenary assembly must meet periodically at the seat of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot;, with meetings occurring more or less frequently depending on the population of the municipality: monthly for those whose population is larger than 20,000, once every two months if it ranges between 5,001 and 20,000, and once every three months if it does not exceed 5,000. Many &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; also have a local governing board (), which is named by the mayor from amongst the councillors and is required for municipalities of more than 5,000 inhabitants. The board, whose role is to assist the mayor between meetings of the plenary assembly, may not include more than one third of the councillors.

The largest municipality by population in the province as of the 2023 Spanish census is Alicante/Alacant, its capital, with 349,282 residents, while the smallest is Tollos, with 40 residents. The largest municipality by area is Orihuela, which spans 365.36 km², while L&#x27;Alqueria d&#x27;Asnar is the smallest at 1.08 km².

<doc id="300361" wikidata="Q541270" url="?curid=300361" title="Jessie Royce Landis">
<text>Jessie Royce Landis (born Jessie Medbury; November 25, 1896 – February 2, 1972) was an American actress. Her name is also seen as Jesse Royce-Landis. She remains perhaps best-known for her mother roles in the Hitchcock films &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; (1955) and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959).

==Early life==
Jessie Royce Landis was born Jessie Medbury in Chicago, Illinois, to Paul, an orchestra musician, and Ella Medbury. Her acting surname &quot;Landis&quot; derives from her first husband, although she was married twice more.

A scholarship that Landis received when she was 14 enabled her to attend the Hinshaw Dramatic School, which led to her acting two years later with the Evanston Stock Company.

==Career==

Landis was a stage actress for much of her career.

When her first husband&#x27;s family encountered financial problems, she joined the North Shore Players as leading lady and director. In 1924, she left those dual roles to go on tour with &quot;The Highwayman.&quot;

Her Broadway career began with &quot;The Honor of the Family&quot; (1926) and ended with &quot;Roar Like a Dove&quot; (1964). In her early years on Broadway, she continued to act in touring productions. In the early 1950s, Landis spent three seasons acting on stage in London. Landis was recognized for the &quot;best performance of the year&quot; for her acting in &quot;Larger Than Life&quot; in London in 1950.

In the era of old-time radio, Landis had the roles of Irene Emerson on &quot;Helpmate&quot; and the housekeeper on &quot;The House on Q Street&quot;. She also was part of &quot;a stellar cast of Broadway actors and actresses&quot; in the cast of &quot;We Are Always Young&quot; on WOR in New York in 1941.

In the 1950s, she began appearing in movies as a character actress, such as her roles in &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; (1955), and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), both starring Cary Grant and directed by Alfred Hitchcock. In &quot;North by Northwest&quot; she played Grant&#x27;s character&#x27;s mother, and in &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; and &quot;The Swan&quot; (1956), she played the mother of the character played by Grace Kelly. Landis&#x27;s appearance in &quot;North by Northwest&quot; earned her publicity for portraying Cary Grant&#x27;s mother despite claiming to be nearly a year younger. Landis listed 1904 as the year of her birth. However, she had actually shaved eight years off her age. She appears in the 1900 U.S. Census as a 3-year-old born in November 1896; not old enough to be his (biological) mother.

Landis made many television appearances in programs such as &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, and &quot;Boris Karloff&#x27;s Thriller&quot;.

Landis&#x27; autobiography &quot;You Won&#x27;t Be So Pretty (But You&#x27;ll Know More)&quot; was published in 1954.

==Marriages==
Landis was married three times. In June 1915, she secretly married Perry Lester Landis, &quot;a scion of one of Evanston&#x27;s prominent families&quot;. Their son, Medbury Perry Landis, was born with Down syndrome in 1916. When she returned to the stage, he was put in a special school over his father&#x27;s objections. The couple never lived together again, although they were not divorced until 1925, and their son died in 1928.

Landis was married to Rex Smith from 1937 to 1944. In 1956, she married her third husband and widower, United States Army Major General John F. R. &quot;Jeff&quot; Seitz (died 1978).

==Death==
Landis died of cancer at Danbury Hospital in Danbury, Connecticut, on February 2, 1972, aged 75.

<doc id="300379" wikidata="Q365015" url="?curid=300379" title="Jeff Davis (Arkansas politician)">
<text>Jeff Davis (born Jefferson Davis; May 6, 1862 – January 3, 1913) was an American Democratic politician who served as the 20th governor of Arkansas from 1901 to 1907 and in the U.S. Senate from 1907 to 1913. He took office as one of Arkansas&#x27;s first New South governors and proved to be one of the state&#x27;s most polarizing figures. Davis used his silver tongue and aptitude for demagoguery to exploit existing feelings of agrarian frustration among poor white farmers and thus built a large populist appeal. However, since Davis often blamed city-dwellers, blacks, and Yankees for problems on the farm, the state was quickly and ardently split into &quot;pro-Davis&quot; and &quot;anti-Davis&quot; factions.

Davis began his political career as Arkansas Attorney General, where he immediately began making political waves. His office challenged the legality of the Kimball State House Act and made an extremely-controversial extraterritorial interpretation of the Rector Antitrust Act. His fight to prevent trusts from doing business in Arkansas and the extreme lengths that he went to enforce his opinion would be a common theme throughout his political career. He gained credibility among the poor white farmers, who would become his base.

Davis&#x27;s three two-year terms as governor &quot;produced more politics than government,&quot; but he gained construction of a new state house and reformed the penal system. An almost-constant series of scandals and outrageous behavior characterized his time in office, which followed him when he won election to the Senate in 1906. Davis is often classified with such populist politicians as Benjamin Tillman, Robert Love Taylor, Thomas E. Watson, James K. Vardaman, Coleman Livingston Blease, and then Huey Long, controversial figures who were Southern demagogues, populists, and political bosses.

==Early life==

Davis was born near Rocky Comfort in Little River County in southwestern Arkansas. His parents were Lewis W. Davis, a Baptist preacher originally from Kentucky, and his wife Elizabeth Phillips, originally from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Lewis Davis did not join the Confederate army until drafted in 1864. He named his only son after Jefferson Davis, then-President of the Confederate States of America. His military service was largely performed as a chaplain&#x27;s commission, but he quit the ministry following the war and became a lawyer.

===American Civil War and Reconstruction===

No Civil War battles were fought within Sevier County&#x27;s bounds, but there were many opportunities for the war to make an impression on the young Jeff Davis. After the Union captured Little Rock in 1863, the state capitol was moved to Washington. Union General Nathaniel Banks later led the Red River Campaign through the county, an unsuccessful attempt to capture Shreveport, Louisiana via southwest Arkansas. Beginning in 1865, Laynesport, not far from the Davis property, was fortified as a Confederate garrison. Perhaps equally indelible was the romanticism of &quot;The Lost Cause&quot; myth in the years following the war; as a majority of southwestern Arkansas residents remained staunch Confederate supporters.

Following the war, Lewis Davis was elected to serve as county and probate judge of Sevier County, and later Little River County following its creation by the state legislature in 1867. The following year, Congressional or Radical Reconstruction swept Davis and most other Democrats from office by temporarily banning former Confederates from office and passing amendments to enfranchise freedmen. Confederate supporters did not accept this political overhaul, turning to vigilante groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and Knights of the White Camelia to intimidate blacks and Republicans. The rough and tumble nature of Little River County was especially conductive for gangs, outlaws and violence.

Eventually the situation devolved to such lawlessness that governor Powell Clayton declared martial law in Little River and nine other counties to restore order. Desperado Cullen Baker initially assembled a posse to oppose Clayton&#x27;s militia, but after several skirmishes, the militia gained control of the county. Local history tells of rape, torture, murder and pillaging of blacks and white Republican sympathizers by the militia in the ensuing months. The martial law months were later described by Jeff Davis as the &quot;most bitter episode of his youth&quot;. In 1869 the Davis family moved to Dover, Arkansas in the Arkansas River Valley.

===Move to Pope County===

Following a move to Pope County, Lewis Davis found that his previous service as judge quickly elevated him within a very small legal community. However, the Davis family had moved into a post-war situation that was similarly violent to that of Little River County and rooted deep in Pope County&#x27;s past. With the population divided sharply into city-country and Union-Rebel factions, both sides held grudges long after the war was over. The Republican domination of local government resulted in resentment by the ex-Confederate Democrats, and the situation exploded in 1872. In what was later known as the Pope County Militia War, the county experienced a period of political and civil troubles while an unofficial militia headed by four radical Republican aligned county officials ran roughshod over the county. By its end, three of the four had been killed. Pope County Democrats became heroes across the state for openly providing armed resistance to Powell Clayton&#x27;s state militia. Such Reconstruction violence continued to have a strong effect on ten-year-old Jeff Davis.

==Education and early career==

Davis attended public schools in Russellville, Arkansas. After being rejected by West Point in 1878, Davis enrolled at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, where he studied until 1880. He transferred to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. Although he completed the two-year law curriculum in one year, the Vanderbilt University Law School withheld his diploma for failure to satisfy their residency requirement.

With the help of his father&#x27;s influence, Davis returned to Russellville in the summer of 1881 and was accepted to the Arkansas Bar Association despite being underaged. In the fall of 1881, Davis enrolled at Cumberland University, which granted his law degree in May 1882.

Now twenty years old, Davis joined his father&#x27;s law firm, L.W. Davis and Son, Attorneys, in Russellville as a junior law partner. Focusing on homestead cases, the law practice had become rather successful. The elder Davis, buoyed by a growing law practice while also working as a newspaper editor, real estate broker, and local booster, had become one of the county&#x27;s most successful citizens. The elder Davis won election to the Arkansas General Assembly in 1877. Jeff Davis became deeply involved in political campaigns as early as 1884.

After supporting Grover Cleveland in the 1888 presidential election, Davis decided to run for district prosecuting attorney in the Fifth Judicial District the following cycle.

==Politics==

At the time, the South was ruled by an unofficial one-party system, with Democratic hegemony, white supremacy, and black disfranchisement remaining intertwined after Reconstruction and well into the 20th century. Prominent landowning white men of the former planter class were returned to power by Democratic supporters and known as Redeemers in the waning years of Reconstruction. After 1877, they largely ruled statewide and national positions as well as an increasing number of local positions once the state passed disenfranchisement of blacks. They sought to reverse Republican gains made during Reconstruction and to return to white supremacy of the Antebellum South by disenfranchising most blacks and imposing Jim Crow laws. An insurgent paramilitary component, including groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, also rose to prominence during the period. Together with common whites, they committed countless lynchings and other acts of violence against Republicans, blacks, and other groups.

===Style and contemporaries===
Davis is often classified with politicians such as Benjamin Tillman, Robert Love Taylor, Thomas E. Watson, James K. Vardaman, Coleman Livingston Blease, and later Huey Long, controversial figures who were Southern demagogues, populists, and political bosses. Davis was one of many Southern demagogue politicians who rose to power on a populist message of agrarian frustration with big business and elites. His coarse language, insults, and theatrics were all crafted to enhance his &quot;common man&quot; credentials. Davis made a career of skewering the business interests, newspapers, and urban dwellers to appeal to the poor rural citizens, the majority of the population. He portrayed himself as “just another poor country boy” against the moneyed interests that held back the common man. Davis often used words such as &quot;rednecks&quot; or &quot;hillbillies&quot; but as terms of endearment rather than pejorative, a technique that Huey Long would learn from Davis and later use successfully in Louisiana.

Like many of his contemporaries, Davis used a rhetoric that was strongly racist and segregationist. Although Davis did not succeed in implementing many of his racist promises on the stump, he supported disfranchisement of blacks, segregation of school taxes, and white supremacy. He attacked 1904 gubernatorial opponent Carroll D. Wood for appointing a black man as a jury commissioner and promised that &quot;no man could be appointed to office under my administration unless he was a white man, a Democrat, and a Jeff Davis man.&quot;

It was said that many of his supporters incorrectly believed Davis to be related to Confederate President Jefferson Davis, which the politician did nothing to discourage and may have covertly encouraged.

===Early career===
Davis served as prosecuting attorney of the Fifth Judicial District of Arkansas from 1892 to 1896.

====Attorney General====
Davis was elected as Arkansas Attorney General in 1898 and served a single term. He focused on one of the primary issues of the Progressive Era: the creation of antitrust law to regulate trusts, meaning large companies or combinations abusing market power or tending toward monopoly.
Despite passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 at the federal level, the law was sufficiently broad to have little immediate impact, and was largely made ineffective by the United States Supreme Court case &quot;United States v. E. C. Knight Co.&quot;, leaving state legislatures to address trusts. A new antitrust bill passed by the 32nd Arkansas General Assembly, focused on perceived price fixing of fire insurance rates in the cities of Arkansas, especially Hot Springs, raised the issue&#x27;s prominence in Arkansas politics by uniting city dwellers alongside rural Arkansans in anger against the trusts.

====Governor====
Elected in 1900, Davis served as Governor of Arkansas from 1901 to 1907.

In 1905, when US President Theodore Roosevelt visited Arkansas, Davis greeted him with a speech that defended lynching as a means of social control. Roosevelt responded with a calmer speech that defended the rule of law.

===US Senate===
Davis was elected to the US Senate by the state legislature, as was customary at the time, serving one term from March 4, 1907 until his death. He was chairman of the Committee on the Mississippi and its Tributaries.

==Death==
Davis served in the Senate until his death in 1913. He is buried at historic Mount Holly Cemetery, in Little Rock, Arkansas.

<text>Smooth muscle is one of the three major types of vertebrate muscle tissue, the others being skeletal and cardiac muscle. It can also be found in invertebrates and is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is non-striated, so-called because it has no sarcomeres and therefore no striations (&quot;bands&quot; or &quot;stripes&quot;). It can be divided into two subgroups, &quot;single-unit&quot; and &quot;multi-unit&quot; smooth muscle. Within single-unit muscle, the whole bundle or sheet of smooth muscle cells contracts as a syncytium.

Smooth muscle is found in the walls of hollow organs, including the stomach, intestines, bladder and uterus. In the walls of blood vessels, and lymph vessels, (excluding blood and lymph capillaries) it is known as vascular smooth muscle. There is smooth muscle in the tracts of the respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems. In the eyes, the ciliary muscles, iris dilator muscle, and iris sphincter muscle are types of smooth muscles. The iris dilator and sphincter muscles are contained in the iris and contract in order to dilate or constrict the pupils. The ciliary muscles change the shape of the lens to focus on objects in accommodation. In the skin, smooth muscle cells such as those of the arrector pili cause hair to stand erect in response to cold temperature and fear.

==Structure==

===Gross anatomy===
Smooth muscle is grouped into two types: single-unit smooth muscle, also known as visceral smooth muscle, and multiunit smooth muscle. Most smooth muscle is of the single-unit type, and is found in the walls of most internal organs (viscera); and lines blood vessels (except large elastic arteries), the urinary tract, and the digestive tract. It is not found in the heart which has cardiac muscle. 

In single-unit smooth muscle a single cell in a bundle is innervated by an autonomic nerve fiber (myogenic). An action potential can be propagated through neighbouring muscle cells due to the presence of many gap junctions between the cells. Due to this property, single-unit bundles form a syncytium that contracts in a coordinated fashion making the whole muscle contract or relax, such as the uterine muscles during childbirth.

Single-unit visceral smooth muscle is myogenic; it can contract regularly without input from a motor neuron (as opposed to multiunit smooth muscle, which is neurogenic - that is, its contraction must be initiated by an autonomic nervous system neuron). A few of the cells in a given single unit may behave as pacemaker cells, generating rhythmic action potentials due to their intrinsic electrical activity. Because of its myogenic nature, single-unit smooth muscle is usually active, even when it is not receiving any neural stimulation. Multiunit smooth muscle is found in the trachea, in the iris of the eye, and lining the large elastic arteries.

However, the terms single- and multi-unit smooth muscle represent an oversimplification. This is due to the fact that smooth muscles for the most part are controlled and influenced by a combination of different neural elements. In addition, it has been observed that most of the time there will be some cell-to-cell communication and activators/inhibitors produced locally. This leads to a somewhat coordinated response even in multiunit smooth muscle.

Smooth muscle differs from skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle in terms of structure, function, regulation of contraction, and excitation-contraction coupling. However, smooth muscle tissue tends to demonstrate greater elasticity and function within a larger length-tension curve than striated muscle. This ability to stretch and still maintain contractility is important in organs like the intestines and urinary bladder. Smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract is activated by a composite of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) that are electrically coupled and work together as an SIP functional syncytium.

===Microanatomy===
====Smooth muscle cells====

A smooth-muscle cell is a spindle-shaped myocyte with a wide middle and tapering ends, and a single nucleus. Like striated muscle, smooth muscle can tense and relax. In the relaxed state, each cell is 30–200 micrometers in length, some thousands of times shorter than a skeletal muscle cell. There are no myofibrils present, but much of the cytoplasm is taken up by the proteins, myosin and actin, which together have the capability to contract.

====Myosin====
Myosin is primarily class II in smooth muscle.
* Myosin II contains two &quot;heavy chains&quot; (MHC) which constitute the head and tail domains. Each of these heavy chains contains the N-terminal head domain, while the C-terminal tails take on a coiled-coil morphology, holding the two heavy chains together (imagine two snakes wrapped around each other, such as in a caduceus). Thus, myosin II has two heads. In smooth muscle, there is a single gene (MYH11) that codes for the heavy chains myosin II, but there are splice variants of this gene that result in four distinct isoforms. Also, smooth muscle may contain MHC that is not involved in contraction, and that can arise from multiple genes.
* Myosin II also contains 4 &quot;light chains&quot; (MLC), resulting in 2 per head, weighing 20 (MLC20) and 17 (MLC17) kDa. These bind the heavy chains in the &quot;neck&quot; region between the head and tail.
** The MLC20 is also known as the &quot;regulatory light chain&quot; and actively participates in muscle contraction. Two MLC20 isoforms are found in smooth muscle, and they are encoded by different genes, but only one isoform participates in contraction.
** The MLC17 is also known as the &quot;essential light chain&quot;. Its exact function is unclear, but it is believed that it contributes to the structural stability of the myosin head along with MLC20. Two variants of MLC17 (MLC17a/b) exist as a result of alternative splicing at the MLC17 gene.
Different combinations of heavy and light chains allow for up to hundreds of different types of myosin structures, but it is unlikely that more than a few such combinations are actually used or permitted within a specific smooth muscle bed. In the uterus, a shift in myosin expression has been hypothesized to avail for changes in the directions of uterine contractions that are seen during the menstrual cycle.

====Actin====
The thin filaments that are part of the contractile machinery are predominantly composed of alpha-actin and gamma-actin. Smooth muscle alpha-actin is the predominant isoform within smooth muscle. There is also a lot of actin (mainly beta-actin) that does not take part in contraction, but that polymerizes just below the plasma membrane in the presence of a contractile stimulant and may thereby assist in mechanical tension. Alpha-actin is also expressed as distinct genetic isoforms such as smooth muscle, cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle specific isoforms of alpha-actin.

The ratio of actin to myosin is between 2:1 and 10:1 in smooth muscle. Conversely, from a mass ratio standpoint (as opposed to a molar ratio), myosin is the dominant protein in striated skeletal muscle with the actin to myosin ratio falling in the 1:2 to 1:3 range. A typical value for healthy young adults is 1:2.2.

====Other associated proteins====
Smooth muscle does not contain the protein troponin; instead calmodulin (which takes on the regulatory role in smooth muscle), caldesmon and calponin are significant proteins expressed within smooth muscle.
*Tropomyosin is present in smooth muscle, spanning seven actin monomers and is laid out end to end over the entire length of the thin filaments. In striated muscle, tropomyosin serves to block actin–myosin interactions until calcium is present, but in smooth muscle, its function is unknown.
*Calponin molecules may exist in equal number as actin, and has been proposed to be a load-bearing protein.
*Caldesmon has been suggested to be involved in tethering actin, myosin and tropomyosin, and thereby enhance the ability of smooth muscle to maintain tension.
Also, all three of these proteins may have a role in inhibiting the ATPase activity of the myosin complex that otherwise provides energy to fuel muscle contraction.

====Dense bodies====
The actin filaments are attached to dense bodies, which are analogous to the Z-discs in striated muscle sarcomeres. Dense bodies are rich in alpha-actinin (α-actinin), and also attach intermediate filaments (consisting largely of vimentin and desmin), and thereby appear to serve as anchors from which the thin filaments can exert force. Dense bodies also are associated with beta-actin, which is the type found in the cytoskeleton, suggesting that dense bodies may coordinate tensions from both the contractile machinery and the cytoskeleton. Dense bodies appear darker under an electron microscope, and so they are sometimes described as electron dense.

The intermediate filaments are connected to other intermediate filaments via dense bodies, which eventually are attached to adherens junctions (also called focal adhesions) in the cell membrane of the smooth muscle cell, called the sarcolemma. The adherens junctions consist of large number of proteins including alpha-actinin (α-actinin), vinculin and cytoskeletal actin. The adherens junctions are scattered around &quot;dense bands&quot; that are circumfering the smooth muscle cell in a rib-like pattern. The dense band (or dense plaques) areas alternate with regions of membrane containing numerous caveolae. When complexes of actin and myosin contract, force is transduced to the sarcolemma through intermediate filaments attaching to such dense bands.

====Contraction====
During contraction, there is a spatial reorganization of the contractile machinery to optimize force development. part of this reorganization consists of vimentin being phosphorylated at Ser56 by a p21 activated kinase, resulting in some disassembly of vimentin polymers.

Also, the number of myosin filaments is dynamic between the relaxed and contracted state in some tissues as the ratio of actin to myosin changes, and the length and number of myosin filaments change.

Isolated single smooth muscle cells have been observed contracting in a spiral corkscrew fashion, and isolated permeabilized smooth muscle cells adhered to glass (so contractile proteins allowed to internally contract) demonstrate zones of contractile protein interactions along the long axis as the cell contracts.

Smooth muscle-containing tissue needs to be stretched often, so elasticity is an important attribute of smooth muscle. Smooth muscle cells may secrete a complex extracellular matrix containing collagen (predominantly types I and III), elastin, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. Smooth muscle also has specific elastin and collagen receptors to interact with these proteins of the extracellular matrix. These fibers with their extracellular matrices contribute to the viscoelasticity of these tissues. For example, the great arteries are viscolelastic vessels that act like a Windkessel, propagating ventricular contraction and smoothing out the pulsatile flow, and the smooth muscle within the tunica media contributes to this property.

====Caveolae====
The sarcolemma also contains caveolae, which are microdomains of lipid rafts specialized to cell signaling events and ion channels. These invaginations in the sarcoplasm contain a host of receptors (prostacyclin, endothelin, serotonin, muscarinic receptors, adrenergic receptors), second messenger generators (adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C), G proteins (RhoA, G alpha), kinases (rho kinase-ROCK, protein kinase C, protein Kinase A), ion channels (L type calcium channels, ATP sensitive potassium channels, calcium sensitive potassium channels) in close proximity. The caveolae are often close to sarcoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria, and have been proposed to organize signaling molecules in the membrane.

==Excitation-contraction coupling==

A smooth muscle is excited by external stimuli, which causes contraction. Each step is further detailed below.

===Inducing stimuli and factors===
Smooth muscle may contract spontaneously (via ionic channel dynamics) or as in the gut special pacemakers cells interstitial cells of Cajal produce rhythmic contractions. Also, contraction, as well as relaxation, can be induced by a number of physiochemical agents (e.g., hormones, drugs, neurotransmitters – particularly from the autonomic nervous system).

Smooth muscle in various regions of the vascular tree, the airway and lungs, kidneys and vagina is different in their expression of ionic channels, hormone receptors, cell-signaling pathways, and other proteins that determine function.

====External substances====
For instance, blood vessels in skin, gastrointestinal system, kidney and brain respond to norepinephrine and epinephrine (from sympathetic stimulation or the adrenal medulla) by producing vasoconstriction (this response is mediated through alpha-1 adrenergic receptors). However, blood vessels within skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle respond to these catecholamines producing vasodilation because they possess beta-adrenergic receptors. So there is a difference in the distribution of the various adrenergic receptors that explains the difference in why blood vessels from different areas respond to the same agent norepinephrine/epinephrine differently as well as differences due to varying amounts of these catecholamines that are released and sensitivities of various receptors to concentrations.

Generally, arterial smooth muscle responds to carbon dioxide by producing vasodilation, and responds to oxygen by producing vasoconstriction. Pulmonary blood vessels within the lung are unique as they vasodilate to high oxygen tension and vasoconstrict when it falls. Bronchiole, smooth muscle that line the airways of the lung, respond to high carbon dioxide producing vasodilation and vasoconstrict when carbon dioxide is low. These responses to carbon dioxide and oxygen by pulmonary blood vessels and bronchiole airway smooth muscle aid in matching perfusion and ventilation within the lungs. Further different smooth muscle tissues display extremes of abundant to little sarcoplasmic reticulum so excitation-contraction coupling varies with its dependence on intracellular or extracellular calcium.

Recent research indicates that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling is an important regulator of vascular smooth muscle contraction. When transmural pressure increases, sphingosine kinase 1 phosphorylates sphingosine to S1P, which binds to the S1P2 receptor in plasma membrane of cells. This leads to a transient increase in intracellular calcium, and activates Rac and Rhoa signaling pathways. Collectively, these serve to increase MLCK activity and decrease MLCP activity, promoting muscle contraction. This allows arterioles to increase resistance in response to increased blood pressure and thus maintain constant blood flow. The Rhoa and Rac portion of the signaling pathway provides a calcium-independent way to regulate resistance artery tone.

===Spread of impulse===
To maintain organ dimensions against force, cells are fastened to one another by adherens junctions. As a consequence, cells are mechanically coupled to one another such that contraction of one cell invokes some degree of contraction in an adjoining cell. Gap junctions couple adjacent cells chemically and electrically, facilitating the spread of chemicals (e.g., calcium) or action potentials between smooth muscle cells. Single unit smooth muscle displays numerous gap junctions and these tissues often organize into sheets or bundles which contract in bulk.

===Contraction===
Smooth muscle contraction is caused by the sliding of myosin and actin filaments (a sliding filament mechanism) over each other. The energy for this to happen is provided by the hydrolysis of ATP. Myosin functions as an ATPase utilizing ATP to produce a molecular conformational change of part of the myosin and produces movement. Movement of the filaments over each other happens when the globular heads protruding from myosin filaments attach and interact with actin filaments to form crossbridges. The myosin heads tilt and drag along the actin filament a small distance (10–12 nm). The heads then release the actin filament and then changes angle to relocate to another site on the actin filament a further distance (10–12 nm) away. They can then re-bind to the actin molecule and drag it along further. This process is called crossbridge cycling and is the same for all muscles (see muscle contraction). Unlike cardiac and skeletal muscle, smooth muscle does not contain the calcium-binding protein troponin. Contraction is initiated by a calcium-regulated phosphorylation of myosin, rather than a calcium-activated troponin system.

Crossbridge cycling causes contraction of myosin and actin complexes, in turn causing increased tension along the entire chains of tensile structures, ultimately resulting in contraction of the entire smooth muscle tissue.

====Phasic or tonic====

Smooth muscle may contract phasically with rapid contraction and relaxation, or tonically with slow and sustained contraction. The reproductive, digestive, respiratory, and urinary tracts, skin, eye, and vasculature all contain this tonic muscle type. This type of smooth muscle can maintain force for prolonged time with only little energy utilization. There are differences in the myosin heavy and light chains that also correlate with these differences in contractile patterns and kinetics of contraction between tonic and phasic smooth muscle.

====Activation of myosin heads====
Crossbridge cycling cannot occur until the myosin heads have been activated to allow crossbridges to form. When the light chains are phosphorylated, they become active and will allow contraction to occur. The enzyme that phosphorylates the light chains is called myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), also called MLC20 kinase. In order to control contraction, MLCK will work only when the muscle is stimulated to contract. Stimulation will increase the intracellular concentration of calcium ions. These bind to a molecule called calmodulin, and form a calcium-calmodulin complex. It is this complex that will bind to MLCK to activate it, allowing the chain of reactions for contraction to occur.

Activation consists of phosphorylation of a serine on position 19 (Ser19) on the MLC20 light chain, which causes a conformational change that increases the angle in the neck domain of the myosin heavy chain, which corresponds to the part of the cross-bridge cycle where the myosin head is unattached to the actin filament and relocates to another site on it. After attachment of the myosin head to the actin filament, this serine phosphorylation also activates the ATPase activity of the myosin head region to provide the energy to fuel the subsequent contraction. Phosphorylation of a threonine on position 18 (Thr18) on MLC20 is also possible and may further increase the ATPase activity of the myosin complex.

====Sustained maintenance====
Phosphorylation of the MLC20 myosin light chains correlates well with the shortening velocity of smooth muscle. During this period there is a rapid burst of energy utilization as measured by oxygen consumption. Within a few minutes of initiation the calcium level markedly decrease, MLC20 myosin light chains phosphorylation decreases, and energy utilization decreases and the muscle can relax. Still, smooth muscle has the ability of sustained maintenance of force in this situation as well. This sustained phase has been attributed to certain myosin crossbridges, termed latch-bridges, that are cycling very slowly, notably slowing the progression to the cycle stage whereby dephosphorylated myosin detaches from the actin, thereby maintaining the force at low energy costs. This phenomenon is of great value especially for tonically active smooth muscle.

Isolated preparations of vascular and visceral smooth muscle contract with depolarizing high potassium balanced saline generating a certain amount of contractile force. The same preparation stimulated in normal balanced saline with an agonist such as endothelin or serotonin will generate more contractile force. This increase in force is termed calcium sensitization. The myosin light chain phosphatase is inhibited to increase the gain or sensitivity of myosin light chain kinase to calcium. There are a number of cell signalling pathways believed to regulate this decrease in myosin light chain phosphatase: a RhoA-Rock kinase pathway, a Protein kinase C-Protein kinase C potentiation inhibitor protein 17 (CPI-17) pathway, telokin, and a Zip kinase pathway. Further Rock kinase and Zip kinase have been implicated to directly phosphorylate the 20kd myosin light chains.

====Other contractile mechanisms====
Other cell signaling pathways and protein kinases (Protein kinase C, Rho kinase, Zip kinase, Focal adhesion kinases) have been implicated as well and actin polymerization dynamics plays a role in force maintenance. While myosin light chain phosphorylation correlates well with shortening velocity, other cell signaling pathways have been implicated in the development of force and maintenance of force. Notably the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on the focal adhesion adapter protein-paxillin by specific tyrosine kinases has been demonstrated to be essential to force development and maintenance. For example, cyclic nucleotides can relax arterial smooth muscle without reductions in crossbridge phosphorylation, a process termed force suppression. This process is mediated by the phosphorylation of the small heat shock protein, hsp20, and may prevent phosphorylated myosin heads from interacting with actin.

===Relaxation===
The phosphorylation of the light chains by MLCK is countered by a myosin light-chain phosphatase, which dephosphorylates the MLC20 myosin light chains and thereby inhibits contraction. Other signaling pathways have also been implicated in the regulation actin and myosin dynamics. In general, the relaxation of smooth muscle is by cell-signaling pathways that increase the myosin phosphatase activity, decrease the intracellular calcium levels, hyperpolarize the smooth muscle, and/or regulate actin and myosin muscle can be mediated by the endothelium-derived relaxing factor-nitric oxide, endothelial derived hyperpolarizing factor (either an endogenous cannabinoid, cytochrome P450 metabolite, or hydrogen peroxide), or prostacyclin (PGI2). Nitric oxide and PGI2 stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase and membrane bound adenylate cyclase, respectively. The cyclic nucleotides (cGMP and cAMP) produced by these cyclases activate Protein Kinase G and Protein Kinase A and phosphorylate a number of proteins. The phosphorylation events lead to a decrease in intracellular calcium (inhibit L type Calcium channels, inhibits IP3 receptor channels, stimulates sarcoplasmic reticulum Calcium pump ATPase), a decrease in the 20kd myosin light chain phosphorylation by altering calcium sensitization and increasing myosin light chain phosphatase activity, a stimulation of calcium sensitive potassium channels which hyperpolarize the cell, and the phosphorylation of amino acid residue serine 16 on the small heat shock protein (hsp20)by Protein Kinases A and G. The phosphorylation of hsp20 appears to alter actin and focal adhesion dynamics and actin-myosin interaction, and recent evidence indicates that hsp20 binding to 14-3-3 protein is involved in this process. An alternative hypothesis is that phosphorylated Hsp20 may also alter the affinity of phosphorylated myosin with actin and inhibit contractility by interfering with crossbridge formation. The endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor stimulates calcium sensitive potassium channels and/or ATP sensitive potassium channels and stimulate potassium efflux which hyperpolarizes the cell and produces relaxation.

==Invertebrate smooth muscle==
In invertebrate smooth muscle, contraction is initiated with the binding of calcium directly to myosin and then rapidly cycling cross-bridges, generating force. Similar to the mechanism of vertebrate smooth muscle, there is a low calcium and low energy utilization catch phase. This sustained phase or catch phase has been attributed to a catch protein that has similarities to myosin light-chain kinase and the elastic protein-titin called twitchin. Clams and other bivalve mollusks use this catch phase of smooth muscle to keep their shell closed for prolonged periods with little energy usage.

==Specific effects==
Although the structure and function is basically the same in smooth muscle cells in different organs, their specific effects or end-functions differ.

The contractile function of vascular smooth muscle regulates the lumenal diameter of the small arteries-arterioles called resistance arteries, thereby contributing significantly to setting the level of blood pressure and blood flow to vascular beds. Smooth muscle contracts slowly and may maintain the contraction (tonically) for prolonged periods in blood vessels, bronchioles, and some sphincters. Activating arteriole smooth muscle can decrease the lumenal diameter 1/3 of resting so it drastically alters blood flow and resistance. Activation of aortic smooth muscle doesn&#x27;t significantly alter the lumenal diameter but serves to increase the viscoelasticity of the vascular wall.

In the digestive tract, smooth muscle contracts in a rhythmic peristaltic fashion, rhythmically forcing foodstuffs through the digestive tract as the result of phasic contraction.

A non-contractile function is seen in specialized smooth muscle within the afferent arteriole of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which secretes renin in response to osmotic and pressure changes, and also it is believed to secrete ATP in tubuloglomerular regulation of glomerular filtration rate. Renin in turn activates the renin–angiotensin system to regulate blood pressure.

==Growth and rearrangement==
The mechanism in which external factors stimulate growth and rearrangement is not yet fully understood. A number of growth factors and neurohumoral agents influence smooth muscle growth and differentiation. The Notch receptor and cell-signaling pathway have been demonstrated to be essential to vasculogenesis and the formation of arteries and veins. The proliferation is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and is inhibited by nitric oxide.

The embryological origin of smooth muscle is usually of mesodermal origin, after the creation of muscle cells in a process known as myogenesis. However, the smooth muscle within the Aorta and Pulmonary arteries (the Great Arteries of the heart) is derived from ectomesenchyme of neural crest origin, although coronary artery smooth muscle is of mesodermal origin.

== Related diseases ==
Multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome is a genetic condition in which the body of a developing embryo does not create enough smooth muscle for the gastrointestinal system. This condition is fatal.

Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) can be a symptom of an auto-immune disorder, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or lupus.

Smooth muscle tumors are most commonly benign, and are then called leiomyomas. They can occur in any organ, but they usually occur in the uterus, small bowel, and esophagus. Malignant smooth muscle tumors are called leiomyosarcomas. Leiomyosarcomas are one of the more common types of soft-tissue sarcomas. Vascular smooth muscle tumors are very rare. They can be malignant or benign, and morbidity can be significant with either type. Intravascular leiomyomatosis is a benign neoplasm that extends through the veins; angioleiomyoma is a benign neoplasm of the extremities; vascular leiomyosarcomas is a malignant neoplasm that can be found in the inferior vena cava, pulmonary arteries and veins, and other peripheral vessels.

<text>Daniel Frederick Bakeman (October 9, 1759 – April 5, 1869) was the last survivor receiving a veteran&#x27;s pension for service in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).

==Early life==
Bakeman claimed that he was born on October 9, 1759, in Schoharie County, New York. Other sources indicate that he may have been born in northern New Jersey, near the Delaware River, and that his parents moved to the Schoharie County area when he was a boy. His parents were Dutch immigrants Andreas Phillip Bakeman and Catarien Miller, and his name sometimes appears in written records as &quot;Bochman&quot;. He was baptized in Schenectady on November 27, 1773.

==American Revolution==
According to Bakeman&#x27;s later testimony, during the American Revolution, he served as a private in the Tryon County militia for the last four years of the war, and was a member of the company commanded by a captain named Van Arnum during the period when the county militia was commanded by Marinus Willett. According to an obituary, Bakeman took part in the 1781 Battle of Johnstown, and served as a teamster for the militia following his time in the ranks.

Though no captain named Van Arnum (possibly Van Aernam, a prominent family in Cattaraugus County in Bakeman&#x27;s later life) or anything approximating it appears in the rolls of the Tryon County militia, and though no soldier named Bakeman or Bochman appears in the roll; the descriptions Bakeman provided of his Revolutionary service in the pension application he submitted later in life were judged to be credible. Interestingly the US Department of the Interior had one listing of &quot;Bakeman&quot;: &quot;Bakeman, Henry of Granbry, Oswego&quot; [County] with the following remarks: &quot;Suspended for evidence of identity of the service credited to a soldier of the same name of Colonel Willett&#x27;s regiment, Captain Peter B. Teare&#x27;s company.&quot;

==Post-war==
After the war, Bakeman farmed in the Mohawk Valley. In 1782, he married Susan Brewer, and they were the parents of eight children: Philip, Richard, Christopher, Betsey, Margaret, Susan, Mary, and Christine. Records show that in 1825 the Bakeman family settled in Arcade, New York, where they owned a home on the north side of the County Line Road. In 1845 they moved to Freedom, New York, and they later moved to Stark. Bakeman appeared in the 1860 United States census as &quot;Frederick Bakeman&quot; living in Freedom with his wife, his daughter Susan, and a grandchild, Jacob N. Bakeman (born 1838).

In Bakeman&#x27;s later years, he was often called upon by local leaders to take part in important ceremonies, and on Independence Day he was known to march around Freedom firing salutes with his musket.

==Later life==
Bakeman was the victim of house fires at least three times during his lifetime, including once while on a four-day trip from central New York to Albany to buy wheat and other farm supplies. In the mid-1860s, he applied for a pension, and stated that the records of his service burned in one of his house fires. As with many veterans who could not provide discharge certificates or other verifying documents, Bakeman&#x27;s application included affidavits from friends and neighbors, who attested that he had a reputation for honesty, and that they had previously heard him describe his military service. The testimony of these individuals and Bakeman&#x27;s own affidavit were judged to be credible, and on February 14, 1867, the United States Congress passed a special act which granted Bakeman a pension of $500 per year. 
At the time, the longest surviving veterans who were on the pension rolls were Lemuel Cook of Clarendon, New York (died May 20, 1866), and Samuel Downing of Edinburgh, New York (died February 19, 1867). George Fruits (died August 6, 1876) also claimed to be the last surviving veteran of the Revolutionary War, but he was never on the pension rolls, and research by A. Ross Eckler Jr. in the 1970s indicated that Fruits was 17 years younger than he claimed, and was not a veteran of the Revolution.

==Death and burial==
Bakeman died in Freedom on April 5, 1869, and is buried in Freedom&#x27;s Sandusky Cemetery. The &quot;Annual Report&quot; of the U.S. Commissioner of Pensions for 1874 noted that &quot;With the death of Daniel T. Bakeman, of Freedom, Cattaraugus County, N.Y., April 5, 1869, the last of the pensioned soldiers of the Revolution passed away.&quot;

<doc id="300390" wikidata="Q1806179" url="?curid=300390" title="Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code">
<text>Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code (known in America as Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code) is the third book of Irish children&#x27;s fiction author Eoin Colfer&#x27;s &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series. It is preceded by &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident&quot; and followed by &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception&quot;. The storyline follows Artemis Fowl and his companions as they struggle to recover the &quot;C Cube&quot;, a supercomputer Artemis had constructed from fairy technology, when Jon Spiro manages to steal it. Critical response was generally favourable.

==Plot==
Artemis Fowl II, the 13-year-old criminal mastermind, has created a supercomputer which he calls the &quot;C Cube&quot;, from the stolen fairy LEPrecon helmets confiscated by Butler in the siege of Fowl Manor. It far surpasses any human technology made so far. Fowl meets Chicago businessman Jon Spiro in London to show him the Cube, in an attempt to buy a considerable amount of gold in exchange for keeping the technology off the market. However, Spiro ambushes and outwits Artemis and steals the Cube. In the process, Butler, Artemis&#x27; bodyguard, is shot by one of Spiro&#x27;s staff, Arno Blunt.

Artemis&#x27; demonstration of the Cube inadvertently detects Fairy technology below ground, causing a shutdown of all equipment in Haven city. In response, Commander Root sends Captain Holly Short to London to find what the disturbance was caused by. She locates Artemis, who persuades her to revive Butler with fairy magic and the aid of cryogenics. The procedure saves Butler&#x27;s life, but ages him approximately 15 years. Artemis reveals the Cube&#x27;s existence to Holly and the LEPrecon&#x27;s technical expert Foaly the centaur.

Jon Spiro, meanwhile, has commissioned a mob family from Chicago to capture Artemis to break the Cube&#x27;s Eternity Code which prevents Spiro from accessing its software. One of its employees is the dwarf Mulch Diggums, who is sent along with the thug Loafers to Fowl Manor to do the job. Although Mulch is rumbled, Loafers is incapacitated by Juliet, Butler&#x27;s little sister, who has just returned from a failed final test at Madame Ko&#x27;s Academy, where Butler trained to be a bodyguard. After a discussion with Root, who gives them 48 hours before he sends in a full Retrieval team, Artemis comes up with an elaborate plan to retrieve the Cube from Spiro&#x27;s office in Chicago, involving the use of Holly, Mulch and Juliet. Root demands a mind-wipe of the three humans after the job is done, so Artemis leaves Butler in Ireland to ensure their memories survive.

The heist is ultimately successful, with Artemis retrieving the Cube after tricking Spiro into entering a rival company&#x27;s headquarters to steal their new products. The Chicago police immediately arrive to arrest Spiro and his associates, and Foaly wipes Artemis&#x27; movements from the CCTV. Holly and Juliet remove Artemis from the crime, and return with Mulch to Ireland. Although Arno Blunt escapes and tries to enter Ireland to kill Artemis, Butler has him detained and frightens him into confessing his crimes. Root then has the three humans mind-wiped, after Holly mesmerizes Artemis to see if there were any traces left to trigger his memories. Unbeknownst to all, Artemis has had Butler commission three sets of contact lenses to stop the process. Artemis&#x27; plan to retrieve his memories involves Mulch Diggums: Artemis has the date of the search warrant of Mulch&#x27;s cave changed to the day after his first arrest, rendering all subsequent convictions null and void. Artemis then hands Mulch a gold medallion before his mind-wipe, which is actually a computer disc containing all of Artemis&#x27; memories. Although Mulch is incarcerated, he takes comfort in the knowledge that &quot;together they will be unstoppable.&quot;

==Secret message==
In European editions, the code on the cover reads &quot;Think fairy, think again&quot; the slogan for the original Artemis Fowl. The code is not written in Gnommish or Centaurian, instead supposedly written in the &quot;eternity code&quot; with which the C Cube is encrypted. 

In the hardcover edition, the code for &quot;Eoin Colfer Artemis Fowl The Eternity Code Puffin&quot; is printed on the spine underneath the dustjacket, allowing the reader to decipher the code inside the book, which is a message from Artemis asking the reader to help him regain his memories by spreading the message that &quot;Artemis Fowl must find Mulch Diggums

In the reprint of the book, the Eternity Code is changed to Gnommish.

==Critical reception==
Critical response was generally positive. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, complimented the book on its &quot;Agile prose, rapid-fire dialogue and wise-acre humour.&quot; Entertainment Weekly rated the book A−, saying that &quot;The kid&#x27;s still got it...Harry better watch his back&quot;, and that the characters were &quot;still silly and saucy&quot;. Disney Family Entertainment rated it three stars out of five and remarked that it was not &quot;great literature&quot;, but it was well written and would be an entertaining summer reading book.

<text>The Balearic Islands are a province and autonomous community in Spain and lie in the Mediterranean Sea east of mainland Spain. They are divided into 67 municipalities - 53 on the island of Mallorca (Majorca), 8 on the island of Menorca (Minorca), 5 on the island of Eivissa (Ibiza) and 1 comprising the island of Formentera.

The municipalities are grouped into 9 &quot;comarques&quot; (&quot;comarcas&quot; in Castillian Spanish) - six on the island of Mallorca (Palma de Mallorca, Serra de Tramuntana, Raiguer, Pla de Mallorca, Migjorn and Llevant), while the other islands each form one comarque. In the table below, Serra de Tramuntana and Pla de Mallorca are abbreviated to &quot;Serra&quot; and &quot;Pla&quot; respectively.

The Catalan form is the sole official one. Older texts may use Castillian (Spanish) forms or spellings and where different these names are given in brackets after the Catalan name.

<text>Simon P. Hughes, Jr. (April 14, 1830 – June 29, 1906) was an American lawyer, jurist, and politician who served as the 15th governor of Arkansas from 1885 to 1889. He previously served as an officer of the Confederate States Army in the Western and Trans-Mississippi theaters of the American Civil War.

==Early life and education==
Simon P. Hughes, Jr. was born in Smith County, Tennessee, the son of Simon P. Hughes and Mary Hubbard Hughes. Hughes Sr., originally from Prince Edward County, Virginia, was a farmer, sheriff and a member of the Tennessee legislature from 1842 to 1843, Mary Hubbard was a native of Oglethorpe County, Georgia. In 1842, Mary Hughes died and the family moved to Bowie County, Texas. Hughes Sr. died in Texas in 1844, making Hughes at orphan at the age of fourteen.

Hughes moved to Arkansas in December 1849, and was educated at Sylvan Academy and Clinton College in Tennessee. In 1853, Hughes was elected sheriff of Monroe County, Arkansas and served for two years. Hughes was admitted to the bar in Arkansas in 1857, and started private practice in Clarendon, Arkansas. During the American Civil War, he was elected captain in the 23d Arkansas Infantry of the Confederate States Army rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Later in the war, following a reorganization of the 23d Arkansas, Hughes enlisted as a private in Charles L. Morgan&#x27;s Independent Texas Cavalry unit.

<doc id="300409" wikidata="Q3030571" url="?curid=300409" title="Haptic technology">
<text>Haptic technology (also kinaesthetic communication or 3D touch) is technology that can create an experience of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. These technologies can be used to create virtual objects in a computer simulation, to control virtual objects, and to enhance remote control of machines and devices (telerobotics). Haptic devices may incorporate tactile sensors that measure forces exerted by the user on the interface. The word &quot;&quot;, from the (&quot;haptikos&quot;), means &quot;tactile, pertaining to the sense of touch&quot;. Simple haptic devices are common in the form of game controllers, joysticks, and steering wheels.

Haptic technology facilitates investigation of how the human sense of touch works by allowing the creation of controlled haptic virtual objects. Most researchers distinguish three sensory systems related to sense of touch in humans: cutaneous, kinaesthetic and haptic. All perceptions mediated by cutaneous and kinaesthetic sensibility are referred to as tactual perception. The sense of touch may be classified as passive and active, and the term &quot;haptic&quot; is often associated with active touch to communicate or recognize objects.

== History ==
One of the earliest applications of haptic technology was in large aircraft that use servomechanism systems to operate control surfaces. In lighter aircraft without servo systems, as the aircraft approached a stall, the aerodynamic buffeting (vibrations) was felt in the pilot&#x27;s controls. This was a useful warning of a dangerous flight condition. Servo systems tend to be &quot;one-way&quot;, meaning external forces applied aerodynamically to the control surfaces are not perceived at the controls, resulting in the lack of this important sensory cue. To address this, the missing normal forces are simulated with springs and weights. The angle of attack is measured, and as the critical stall point approaches a stick shaker is engaged which simulates the response of a simpler control system. Alternatively, the servo force may be measured and the signal directed to a servo system on the control, also known as &quot;force feedback&quot;. Force feedback has been implemented experimentally in some excavators and is useful when excavating mixed material such as large rocks embedded in silt or clay. It allows the operator to &quot;feel&quot; and work around unseen obstacles.

In the 1960s, Paul Bach-y-Rita developed a vision substitution system using a 20x20 array of metal rods that could be raised and lowered, producing tactile &quot;dots&quot; analogous to the pixels of a screen. People sitting in a chair equipped with this device could identify pictures from the pattern of dots poked into their backs.

The first US patent for a tactile telephone was granted to Thomas D. Shannon in 1973. An early tactile man-machine communication system was constructed by A. Michael Noll at Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. in the early 1970s and a patent was issued for his invention in 1975.

In 1994, the Aura Interactor vest was developed. The vest is a wearable force-feedback device that monitors an audio signal and uses electromagnetic actuator technology to convert bass sound waves into vibrations that can represent such actions as a punch or kick. The vest plugs into the audio output of a stereo, TV, or VCR and the audio signal is reproduced through a speaker embedded in the vest.
In 1995, Thomas Massie developed the PHANToM (Personal HAptic iNTerface Mechanism) system. It used thimble-like receptacles at the end of computerized arms into which a person&#x27;s fingers could be inserted, allowing them to &quot;feel&quot; an object on a computer screen.

In 1995, Norwegian Geir Jensen described a wristwatch haptic device with a skin tap mechanism, termed Tap-in. The wristwatch would connect to a mobile phone via Bluetooth, and tapping-frequency patterns would enable the wearer to respond to callers with selected short messages.

In 2015, the Apple Watch was launched. It uses skin tap sensing to deliver notifications and alerts from the mobile phone of the watch wearer.

== Types of mechanical touch sensing ==
Human sensing of mechanical loading in the skin is managed by Mechanoreceptors. There are a number of types of mechanoreceptors but those present in the finger pad are typically placed into two categories. Fast acting (FA) and slow acting (SA). SA mechanoreceptors are sensitive to relatively large stresses and at low frequencies while FA mechanoreceptors are sensitive to smaller stresses at higher frequencies. The result of this is that generally SA sensors can detect textures with amplitudes greater than 200 micrometers and FA sensors can detect textures with amplitudes less than 200 micrometers down to about 1 micrometer, though some research suggests that FA can only detect textures smaller than the fingerprint wavelength. FA mechanoreceptors achieve this high resolution of sensing by sensing vibrations produced by friction and an interaction of the fingerprint texture moving over fine surface texture.

== Implementation ==
Haptic feedback (often shortened to just haptics) is controlled vibrations at set frequencies and intervals to provide a sensation representative of an in-game action; this includes &#x27;bumps&#x27;, &#x27;knocks&#x27;, and &#x27;tap&#x27; of one&#x27;s hand or fingers.

The majority of electronics offering haptic feedback use vibrations, and most use a type of eccentric rotating mass (ERM) actuator, consisting of an unbalanced weight attached to a motor shaft. As the shaft rotates, the spinning of this irregular mass causes the actuator and the attached device to shake. Piezoelectric actuators are also employed to produce vibrations, and offer even more precise motion than LRAs, with less noise and in a smaller platform, but require higher voltages than do ERMs and LRAs.

=== Controller rumble ===

One of the most common forms of haptic feedback in video games is controller rumble. In 1976, Sega&#x27;s motorbike game &quot;Moto-Cross&quot;, also known as &quot;Fonz&quot;, was the first game to use haptic feedback, causing the handlebars to vibrate during a collision with another vehicle.

=== Force feedback ===
Force feedback devices use motors to manipulate the movement of an item held by the user. A common use is in automobile driving video games and simulators, which turn the steering wheel to simulate forces experienced when cornering a real vehicle. Direct-drive wheels, introduced in 2013, are based on servomotors and are the most high-end, for strength and fidelity, type of force feedback racing wheels.

In 2007, Novint released the Falcon, the first consumer 3D touch device with high resolution three-dimensional force feedback. This allowed the haptic simulation of objects, textures, recoil, momentum, and the physical presence of objects in games.

=== Air vortex rings ===
Air vortex rings are donut-shaped air pockets made up of concentrated gusts of air. Focused air vortices can have the force to blow out a candle or disturb papers from a few yards away. Both Microsoft Research (AirWave) and Disney Research (AIREAL) have used air vortices to deliver non-contact haptic feedback.

=== Ultrasound ===
Focused ultrasound beams can be used to create a localized sense of pressure on a finger without touching any physical object. The focal point that creates the sensation of pressure is generated by individually controlling the phase and intensity of each transducer in an array of ultrasound transducers. These beams can also be used to deliver sensations of vibration, and to give users the ability to feel virtual 3D objects. The first commercially available ultrasound device was the Stratos Explore by Ultrahaptics that consisted of 256-transducer array board and a Leap motion controller for hand tracking

Another form of tactile feed back results from active touch when a human scans (runs their finger over a surface) to gain information about a surfaces texture. A significant amount of information about a surface&#x27;s texture on the micro meter scale can be gathered through this action as vibrations resulting from friction and texture activate mechanoreceptors in the human skin. Towards this goal plates can be made to vibrate at an ultrasonic frequency which reduces the friction between the plate and skin.

=== Electrical stimulation ===
Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be used to create haptic sensations in the skin or muscles. Most notable examples include haptic suits Tesla suit, Owo haptic vest and wearable armbands Valkyrie EIR. In addition to improving immersion, e.g. by simulating bullet hits, these technologies are sought to create sensations similar to weight and resistance, and can promote muscle training.

== Applications ==

=== Control ===

==== Telepresence ====
Haptic feedback is essential to perform complex tasks via telepresence. The Shadow Hand, an advanced robotic hand, has a total of 129 touch sensors embedded in every joint and finger pad that relay information to the operator. This allows tasks such as typing to be performed from a distance. An early prototype can be seen in NASA&#x27;s collection of humanoid robots, or robonauts.

==== Teleoperation ====
Teleoperators are remote controlled robotic tools. When the operator is given feedback on the forces involved, this is called &quot;haptic teleoperation&quot;. The first electrically actuated teleoperators were built in the 1950s at the Argonne National Laboratory by Raymond Goertz to remotely handle radioactive substances. Since then, the use of force feedback has become more widespread in other kinds of teleoperators, such as remote-controlled underwater exploration devices.

Devices such as medical simulators and flight simulators ideally provide the force feedback that would be felt in real life. Simulated forces are generated using haptic operator controls, allowing data representing touch sensations to be saved or played back.

==== Medicine and dentistry ====
Haptic interfaces for medical simulation are being developed for training in minimally invasive procedures such as laparoscopy and interventional radiology, and for training dental students. A Virtual Haptic Back (VHB) was successfully integrated in the curriculum at the Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine. Haptic technology has enabled the development of telepresence surgery, allowing expert surgeons to operate on patients from a distance. As the surgeon makes an incision, they feel tactile and resistance feedback as if working directly on the patient.

==== Automotive ====
With the introduction of large touchscreen control panels in vehicle dashboards, haptic feedback technology is used to provide confirmation of touch commands without needing the driver to take their eyes off the road. Additional contact surfaces, for example the steering wheel or seat, can also provide haptic information to the driver, for example, a warning vibration pattern when close to other vehicles.

==== Aviation ====
Force-feedback can be used to increase adherence to a safe flight envelope and thus reduce the risk of pilots entering dangerous states of flights outside the operational borders while maintaining the pilots&#x27; final authority and increasing their situation awareness.

=== Electronic devices ===

==== Video games ====
Haptic feedback is commonly used in arcade games, especially racing video games. In 1976, Sega&#x27;s motorbike game &quot;Moto-Cross&quot;, also known as &quot;Fonz&quot;, was the first game to use haptic feedback, causing the handlebars to vibrate during a collision with another vehicle. Tatsumi&#x27;s &quot;TX-1&quot; introduced force feedback to car driving games in 1983. The game &quot;Earthshaker!&quot; added haptic feedback to a pinball machine in 1989.

Simple haptic devices are common in the form of game controllers, joysticks, and steering wheels. Early implementations were provided through optional components, such as the Nintendo 64 controller&#x27;s &quot;Rumble Pak&quot; in 1997. In the same year, the Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro with built-in feedback was released by Immersion Corporation. Many console controllers and joysticks feature built-in feedback devices, which are motors with unbalanced weights that spin, causing it to vibrate, including Sony&#x27;s DualShock technology and Microsoft&#x27;s Impulse Trigger technology. Some automobile steering wheel controllers, for example, are programmed to provide a &quot;feel&quot; of the road. As the user makes a turn or accelerates, the steering wheel responds by resisting turns or slipping out of control.

Notable introductions include:

* 2013: The first direct-drive wheel for sim racing is introduced.
* 2014: A new type of haptic cushion that responds to multimedia inputs by LG Electronics.
* 2015: Steam Machines (console-like PCs) by Valve include a new Steam Controller that uses weighted electromagnets capable of delivering a wide range of haptic feedback via the unit&#x27;s trackpads. These controllers&#x27; feedback systems are user-configurable, delivering precise feedback with haptic force actuators on both sides of the controller.
* 2017: The Nintendo Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con introduced the HD Rumble feature, developed with Immersion Corporation, using actuators from Alps Electric.
* 2018: The Razer Nari Ultimate, gaming headphones using a pair of wide frequency haptic drivers, developed by Lofelt.
* 2020: The Sony PlayStation 5 DualSense controllers supports vibrotactile haptic provided by voice coil actuators integrated in the palm grips, and force feedback for the Adaptive Triggers provided by two DC rotary motors. The actuators in the hand grip are able to give varied and intuitive feedback about in-game actions; for example, in a sandstorm, the player can feel the wind and sand, and the motors in the Adaptive Triggers support experiences such as virtually drawing an arrow from a bow.
* 2021, SuperTuxKart 1.3 was released, adding support for force feedback. Force feedback is extremely uncommon for free software games.

==== Mobile devices ====

Tactile haptic feedback is common in cellular devices. In most cases, this takes the form of vibration response to touch. Alpine Electronics uses a haptic feedback technology named &quot;PulseTouch&quot; on many of their touch-screen car navigation and stereo units. The Nexus One features haptic feedback, according to their specifications. Samsung first launched a phone with haptics in 2007.

Surface haptics refers to the production of variable forces on a user&#x27;s finger as it interacts with a surface such as a touchscreen.

Notable introductions include: 
* Tanvas uses an electrostatic technology to control the in-plane forces experienced by a fingertip, as a programmable function of the finger&#x27;s motion. The TPaD Tablet Project uses an ultrasonic technology to modulate the apparent slipperiness of a glass touchscreen.
* In 2013, Apple Inc. was awarded the patent for a haptic feedback system that is suitable for multitouch surfaces. Apple&#x27;s U.S. Patent for a &quot;Method and apparatus for localization of haptic feedback&quot; describes a system where at least two actuators are positioned beneath a multitouch input device, providing vibratory feedback when a user makes contact with the unit. Specifically, the patent provides for one actuator to induce a feedback vibration, while at least one other actuator uses its vibrations to localize the haptic experience by preventing the first set of vibrations from propagating to other areas of the device. The patent gives the example of a &quot;virtual keyboard,&quot; however, it is also noted that the invention can be applied to any multitouch interface. Apple&#x27;s iPhones (and MacBooks) featuring the &quot;Taptic Engine&quot;, accomplish their vibrations with a linear resonant actuator (LRA), which moves a mass in a reciprocal manner by means of a magnetic voice coil, similar to how AC electrical signals are translated into motion in the cone of a loudspeaker. LRAs are capable of quicker response times than ERMs, and thus can transmit more accurate haptic imagery.

==== Virtual reality ====
Haptics are gaining widespread acceptance as a key part of virtual reality systems, adding the sense of touch to previously visual-only interfaces. Systems are being developed to use haptic interfaces for 3D modeling and design, including systems that allow holograms to be both seen and felt. Several companies are making full-body or torso haptic vests or haptic suits for use in immersive virtual reality to allow users to feel explosions and bullet impacts.

==== Personal computers ====
In 2015, Apple Inc.&#x27;s MacBook and MacBook Pro started incorporating a &quot;Tactile Touchpad&quot; design with button functionality and haptic feedback incorporated into the tracking surface. The tactile touchpad allows for a feeling of &quot;give&quot; when clicking despite the fact that the touchpad no longer moves.

=== Sensory substitution ===
==== Sound substitution ====
In December 2015 David Eagleman demonstrated a wearable vest that &quot;translates&quot; speech and other audio signals into series of vibrations. This allowed hearing-impaired people to &quot;feel&quot; sounds on their body; it has since been made commercially as a wristband.

==== Tactile electronic displays ====
A tactile electronic display is a display device that delivers text and graphical information using the sense of touch. Devices of this kind have been developed to assist blind or deaf users by providing an alternative to visual or auditory sensation.

=== Teledildonics ===
Haptic feedback is used within teledildonics, or &quot;sex-technology&quot;, in order to remotely connect sex toys and allow users to engage in virtual sex or allow a remote server to control their sex toy. The term was first coined by Ted Nelson in 1975, when discussing the future of love, intimacy and technology. In recent years, teledildonics and sex-technology have expanded to include toys with a two-way connection that allow virtual sex through the communication of vibrations, pressures and sensations. Many &quot;smart&quot; vibrators allow for a one-way connection either between the user, or a remote partner, to allow control of the toy.

=== Neurorehabilitation and balance ===
For individuals with upper limb motor dysfunction, robotic devices utilizing haptic feedback could be used for neurorehabilitation. Robotic devices, such as end-effectors, and both grounded and ungrounded exoskeletons have been designed to assist in restoring control over several muscle groups. Haptic feedback applied by these robotic devices helps in the recovery of sensory function due to its more immersive nature.

Haptic technology can also provide sensory feedback to ameliorate age-related impairments in balance control and prevent falls in the elderly and balance-impaired. Haptic Cow and Horse are used in veterinary training.

===Puzzles===
Haptic puzzles have been devised in order to investigate goal-oriented haptic exploration, search, learning and memory in complex 3D environments. The goal is to both enable multi-fingered robots with a sense of touch, and gain more insights into human meta-learning.

=== Art ===
Haptic technologies have been explored in virtual arts, such as sound synthesis or graphic design, that make some loose vision and animation. Haptic technology was used to enhance existing art pieces in the Tate Sensorium exhibit in 2015. In music creation, Swedish synthesizer manufacturer Teenage Engineering introduced a haptic subwoofer module for their OP-Z synthesizer allowing musicians to feel the bass frequencies directly on their instrument.

=== Space ===
The use of haptic technologies may be useful in space exploration, including visits to the planet Mars, according to news reports.

<text>Die Tageszeitung (, &quot;The Daily Newspaper&quot;), stylized as &quot;die tageszeitung&quot; and commonly referred to as taz, is a German daily newspaper. It is run as a cooperative – it is administered by its employees and a co-operative of shareholders who invest in a free independent press, rather than to depend on advertising and paywalls.

Founded in 1978 in Berlin as part of an independent, progressive and politically left-leaning movement, it has focused on current politics, social issues such as inequality, ecological crises both local and international, and other topics not covered by the more traditional and conservative newspapers. It mostly supports the alternative green political sphere and the German Green Party, but &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; has also been critical of the SPD/Greens coalition government (1998–2005). It is one of Germany&#x27;s most important newspapers and amongst the top seven. It was for a long time described as &quot;alternative-left&quot; and critical of existing current structures () but became more moderate/liberal under new editors in-chief from 2010. 

The newspaper&#x27;s logo, a paw print, derives from the similarity of the name &quot;taz&quot; to a German word for paw, &quot;Tatze&quot;. Its position in the media landscape varies between the fifth and the sixth most read newspaper of Germany. In 2021 taz overtook for the first time the conservative Die Welt as the fifth most read daily newspaper of Germany.

At the general meeting of the taz publishing cooperative in 2024, the management announced that the daily newspaper will publish its last paper print on 17 October 2025. After that it will only appear online; the columnistic weekend edition will remain in print.

Barbara Junge and Ulrike Winkelmann are editors-in-chief; vice-editor-inchief is Katrin Gottschalk, chief reporter Peter Unfried.

== History ==

&quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; was established in 1978. From the beginning, &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; was intended to be an alternative to the mainstream press, in its own words: &quot;irreverent, commercially independent, intelligent and entertaining.&quot; One expression of its alternative approach to journalism was the payment of unified salaries for all employees until 1991. Nowadays, employees in highly responsible positions receive bonuses. Still, salaries of managers paid by &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; are considerably lower than what is paid in the rest of the industry.

Since 1995, the &quot;WOZ Die Wochenzeitung&quot; (formerly &quot;WoZ&quot;) and &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; have included a German-language edition of the monthly &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot; to supplement the newspapers. Most of the articles in the monthly supplement are translations of the French-language edition of the &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;. When it existed, taz also added the Turkish language newspaper of Germany &quot;Perşembe.&quot;

Since 1992, &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; has been owned by more than 22,214 paying members (as of August 2022). Its circulation has dropped in recent years, with subscriptions including e-paper now down to 42,000. In 1995, it was the first German national newspaper to make all of the content of issue available online. &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; considers to phase out its printed daily edition, but has not (as of December 2023).

From the beginning, &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; appeared in a nationwide edition as well as in a Berlin local edition. Over the years, local editorial offices for North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Hamburg and Bremen were added. While the latter two were merged to &quot;taz nord&quot; (North) the NRW offices were closed as of July 2007.

In the 2013 elections the magazine was among the supporters of the Social Democratic Party. Taz was the first and only newspaper to have an independent Turkish-language edition online, known as taz.gazete between 2017 and 2020. It also was amongst the first to have articles in simple German for neuro-diverse people. It publishes from time to time in English as &quot;taz in English&quot;.

At the general meeting of the taz publishing cooperative in 2024, the management announced that the daily newspaper will publish its last paper print on 17 October 2025. After that it will only appear online; the columnistic weekend edition will remain in print.

== Structure ==
The newspaper is supported by a cooperative under German law. Many readers help finance the newspaper. taz employees are paid under the collective agreement for newspapers in Germany.

== Political stance ==
In its founding years, the taz covered the political spectrum of the extra-parliamentary opposition (APO) in the Federal Republic of Germany in its advisory meetings and opinions. Their political stance was mostly close to The Greens, the SPD and the later the PDS. The newspaper identified less with its successor party, The Left. In the 2000s, the newspaper became closer to the than more center A90/Greens and reported a lot of the opportunities and possibilities of green politics. 

In 2023, long-time taz-journalist Ulrich Schulte switched sides and became head of the press office of the Federal Ministry for the Environment and Consumer Protection (BMUV), led by Steffi Lemke (A90/Greens).

==&quot;Potato Affair&quot;==
On 26 June 2006 &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; published a satirical article on its last page, headlined &quot;Die Wahrheit&quot; (&quot;the truth&quot;) that is reserved for satire and nonsense. It was titled &quot;The new potato of Poland. Rogues who want to rule the world. Today: Lech &#x27;Katsche&#x27; Kaczynski&quot;. This article ridiculed President of Poland Lech Kaczyński and Prime Minister of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński. Lech Kaczyński then cancelled talks that were scheduled between Germany, Poland and France (the Weimar Triangle), officially for reasons of sickness.

==Headlines==
The &quot;taz&quot; is noted for its tongue-in-cheek headlines, such as:
* &quot;Oh mein Gott!&quot; (Oh my god!) – On the election of Joseph Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI
* &quot;Es ist ein Mädchen&quot; (It&#x27;s a girl) – On the election of Angela Merkel as the first female Chancellor of Germany
* &quot;Oops – they did it again!&quot; – On the re-election of George W. Bush as President of the United States

On 5 June 2008, the paper published a picture headlined &quot;Onkel Baracks Hütte&quot; (Uncle Barack&#x27;s Cabin) with a picture of the White House below the headline as part of an article about then-Senator Barack Obama. That headline, which made reference to the book &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, was perceived as racist by some of its readership.

== taz Panter Foundation ==
The taz Panter Foundation is a legally capable foundation based in Berlin. The legal form of a foundation makes it possible to separate non-profit activities from the business activities of taz and to further expand them with the help of supporters. It was established in 2008 to award the taz Panter Prize, which has been presented since 2005. 

The taz Panter Foundation is currently working on three goals: Firstly, it regularly holds international workshops to qualify foreign colleagues, who mainly come from countries where press freedom is under threat. Secondly, the Panter Foundation provides journalistic trainings and further education programs, especially for younger people. And thirdly, the foundation promotes democracy and civic engagement, for example by awarding the annual taz Panter prize.

<text>Utagawa Toyokuni (; 1769 – 24 February 1825), also often referred to as Toyokuni I, to distinguish him from the members of his school who took over his &quot;gō&quot; (art-name) after he died, was a great master of ukiyo-e, known in particular for his kabuki actor prints. He was the second head of the renowned Utagawa school of Japanese woodblock artists, and was the artist who elevated it to the position of great fame and power it occupied for the rest of the nineteenth century.

==Biography==

He was born, the son of Kurahashi Gorobei, a carver of dolls and puppets, including replicas of kabuki actors. At around 14, Toyokuni was apprenticed to the first head of the Utagawa house, Utagawa Toyoharu, whom his father knew well and who lived nearby. One of his fellow pupils under Toyoharu was Toyohiro, whose pupil was the great landscape artist Hiroshige. In recognition of his artistic ability, Toyokuni later took the name Utagawa Toyokuni, following the common practice of using one syllable of his master&#x27;s name.

Toyokuni seems not to have been an &quot;intuitive genius&quot; determined to forge a new path; rather, he seems to have studied intently those who came before him, particularly Utamaro, Chōbunsai Eishi and Eishōsai Chōki. and through a great deal of hard work produced first a mastery, and then a synthesis of their styles, to create a style of his own.

He was known mostly for his prints related to the kabuki theatre, in particular his &quot;yakusha-e&quot; actor portraits, a field which he took to new heights. He also, however, produced other genres such as &quot;musha-e&quot; warrior prints, &quot;shunga&quot; erotica, and most notably &quot;bijin-ga&quot;.

In his actor prints, like Sharaku, one sees the real subject; but his prints merely portrayed what he saw, unlike Sharaku who exaggerated those aspects he saw as the most key. It is said of Toyokuni&#x27;s prints that they recreate exactly what one would see on stage; they show actors acting, not merely just pictures of actors. Together, these characteristics made Toyokuni&#x27;s prints far more popular among theatre-goers than Sharaku&#x27;s, although history has come to judge Sharaku the keener observer and greater artist.

His popularity and prolific output may in part have been his undoing, though. From 1803 through 1817, his work became more static, even as it became more popular. He continued to produce large quantities of prints, but the quality as a rule did not match that of his earlier days. Occasional prints from this period, however, show his old brilliance.

He died in Edo in 1825, surrounded by many of his pupils.

==Names==

Like most Edo period Japanese artists, Toyokuni was known by several names throughout his lifetime, some sequentially and some concurrently.

* Family name (姓 - &quot;sei&quot;): Kurahashi (倉橋)
* Childhood name (幼名 - &quot;yōmyō&quot;): Kumakichi (熊吉) 
* Nickname (通称 - &quot;tsūshō&quot;): Kumaemon (熊右衛門)
* Art names (号 - &quot;gō&quot;): Utagawa Toyokuni (歌川豊国), Utagawa Ichiyōsai (歌川 一陽斎), Ichiyōsai Toyokuni (一陽斎 豊国)
* Posthumous Buddhist name (戒名 - &quot;kaimyō&quot; / 法名 - &quot;hōmyō&quot;): Tokumyōin Jissaireigō Shinji

In addition, the name &#x27;Toyokuni&#x27; has been transcribed through several kanji character combinations, both by the artist himself and by those writing about him.

* Characters used to write Toyokuni: 豊国, 豊國, 豊圀, 豐國, 豐圀 
Today, Toyokuni is almost universally written using the characters 豊国. Each of the other kanji are no longer in common usage.

==Pupils==
Toyokuni&#x27;s two major pupils were the woodblock print masters Kunisada and Kuniyoshi, but he had a host of students in his school. Indeed, so powerful was the Utagawa school after Toyokuni&#x27;s time that almost every Japanese print artist of note either had one of these two characters in his &quot;gō&quot;, or, like Yoshitoshi, was a student of one who did.

His &quot;gō&quot;, &quot;Toyokuni&quot;, was initially used after his death by his son-in-law, Toyoshige, who is therefore known to us as Toyokuni II. Thereafter, it was handed down and used by each head of the Utagawa school in turn. Kunisada is thus also known as Toyokuni III.

==Retrospective observations==

Evaluations of him as an artist are somewhat mixed. Indeed, he himself is reported to have once said:

: &quot;My pictures – they are merely something that I draw, and nothing more than that!&quot;

The main criticisms of his works relate to his &quot;predominantly imitative&quot; style, and to the &quot;marked decline&quot; in the quality of works from later in his career. However, Toyokuni&#x27;s style is admired for characteristics such as &quot;decorative bombast&quot;, and &quot;bold, taut designs&quot;. He is also credited with such innovations as diptych, triptych and polyptych formats, and with training future masters of ukiyo-e. His work captured the world around him, particularly the kabuki theatre, with great clarity, and his style was a step forward. In addition, it was commercially successful, and thus freed woodblock prints from many of the restrictive canons which had limited previous generations of artists.

==Print series==
Here is a very incomplete list of his print series, with dates:
* &quot;Views of Actors on Stage&quot; (ca. 1793)
* &quot;Sketches of Seven Elegant Paragons of Beauty&quot; (ca. 1800)
* &quot;Views of Elegant Geisha in Characteristic Poses&quot; (ca. 1801)
* &quot;Tomimoto the Geisha&quot; (ca. 1830-1844)

<text>The Taz () is a river located in western Siberia, has a length of and drains a basin estimated at . Its middle and lower course are located within Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, while its upper course borders with Krasnoyarsk Krai.

The now ruined city of Mangazeya was located by the Taz.

==Course==
The Taz begins near Lake Dynda, Siberian Uvaly, a hilly area of the West Siberian Plain. It flows roughly northwestwards across largely uninhabited areas. Its mouth is in the Taz Estuary, a roughly long estuary that begins in the area of the settlement of Tazovsky and ends in the Gulf of Ob. A portage connects the Taz with the Turukhan and the Yenisey. There are numerous lakes in its basin, such as the Chyortovo.

Its major tributaries include the Bolshaya Shirta and Khudosey from the right and the Tolka and Chaselka from the left.

<doc id="300420" wikidata="Q669652" url="?curid=300420" title="Mesophile">
<text>A mesophile is an organism that grows best in moderate temperature, neither too hot nor too cold, with an optimum growth range from . The optimum growth temperature for these organisms is 37 °C (about 99 °F). The term is mainly applied to microorganisms. Organisms that prefer extreme environments are known as extremophiles. Mesophiles have diverse classifications, belonging to two domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and to kingdom Fungi of domain Eucarya. Mesophiles belonging to the domain Bacteria can either be gram-positive or gram-negative. Oxygen requirements for mesophiles can be aerobic or anaerobic. There are three basic shapes of mesophiles: coccus, bacillus, and spiral.

==Habitat==
The habitats of mesophiles can include cheese and yogurt. They are often included during fermentation of beer and wine making. Since normal human body temperature is 37 °C, the majority of human pathogens are mesophiles, as are most of the organisms comprising the human microbiome.

==Mesophiles vs. extremophiles==
Mesophiles are the opposite of extremophiles. Extremophiles that prefer cold environments are termed psychrophilic, those preferring warmer temperatures are termed thermophilic or thermotropic and those thriving in extremely hot environments are hyperthermophilic.
A genome-wide computational approach has been designed by Zheng, et al. to classify bacteria into mesophilic and thermophilic.

==Adaptations==
All bacteria have their own optimum environmental surroundings and temperatures in which they thrive. Many factors are responsible for a given organism&#x27;s optimal temperature range, but evidence suggests that the expression of particular genetic elements (alleles) can alter the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the organism. A study published in 2016 demonstrated that mesophilic bacteria could be genetically engineered to express certain alleles from psychrophilic bacteria, consequently shifting the restrictive temperature range of the mesophilic bacteria to closely match that of the psychrophilic bacteria.

Due to the less stable structure of mesophiles, it has reduced flexibility for protein synthesis. Mesophiles are not able to synthesize proteins in low temperatures. It is more sensitive to temperature changes, and the fatty acid composition of the membrane does not allow for much fluidity. Decreasing the optimal temperature of 37 °C to 0 °C to 8 °C leads to a gradual decrease in protein synthesis. Cold-induced proteins (CIPs) are induced during low temperatures, which then allows cold-shock proteins (CSPs) to synthesize. The shift back to the optimal temperature sees an increase, indicating that mesophiles are highly dependent on temperature. Oxygen availability also affects microorganism growth.

There are two explanations for thermophiles being able to survive at such high temperatures whereas mesophiles can not. The most evident explanation is that thermophiles are believed to have cell components that are relatively more stable than the cell components of mesophiles which is why thermophiles are able to live at higher temperatures than mesophiles. &quot;A second school of thought, as represented by the writings of Gaughran (21) and Allen (3), believes that rapid resynthesis of damaged or destroyed cell constituents is the key to the problem of biological stability to heat.&quot;

==Oxygen requirements==
Due to the diversity of mesophiles, oxygen requirements greatly vary. Aerobic respiration requires the use of oxygen and anaerobic does not. There are three types of anaerobes. Facultative anaerobes grow in the absence of oxygen, using fermentation instead. During fermentation, sugars are converted to acids, alcohol, or gases. If there is oxygen present, it will use aerobic respiration instead. Obligate anaerobes cannot grow in the presence of oxygen. Aerotolerant anaerobes can withstand oxygen.

==Roles==
Microorganisms play an important role in decomposition of organic matter and mineralization of nutrients. In aquatic environments, the diversity of the ecosystem allows for the diversity of mesophiles. The functions of each mesophile rely on the surroundings, most importantly temperature range. Bacteria such as mesophiles and thermophiles are used in the cheesemaking due to their role in fermentation. &quot;Traditional microbiologists use the following terms to indicate the general (slightly arbitrary) optimum temperature for the growth of bacteria: psychrophiles (15–20 °C), mesophiles (30–37 °C), thermophiles (50–60 °C) and extreme thermophiles (up to 122 °C)&quot;. Both mesophiles and thermophiles are used in cheesemaking for the same reason; however, they grow, thrive and die at different temperatures. Psychrotrophic bacteria contribute to dairy products spoiling, getting mouldy or going bad due to their ability to grow at lower temperatures such as in a refrigerator.

==Examples==
Some notable mesophiles include &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Other examples of species of mesophiles are &quot;Clostridium kluyveri&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas maltophilia&quot;, &quot;Thiobacillus novellus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, and &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;. Different types of diseases and infections typically have pathogens from mesophilic bacteria such as the ones listed above.

===&quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;===
&quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; is a gram-positive bacterium. It is closely related to &quot;Bacillus&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;. It is a rod-shaped, facultative anaerobe that is motile by peritrichous flagella. &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; motility is limited from 20 °C to 25 °C. At the optimal temperature, it loses its motility. This bacterium is responsible for listeriosis which derives from contaminated food.

===&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;===
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; was first identified in 1880. It is responsible for different infections stemming from an injury. The bacterium overcomes the body&#x27;s natural mechanisms. Long lasting infections of &quot;S. aureus&quot; includes pneumonia, meningitis, and osteomyelitis. &quot;S. aureus&quot; is commonly contracted in hospital settings.

===&quot;Escherichia coli&quot;===
&quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is a gram-negative, rod-shaped facultative anaerobic bacterium that does not produce spores. The bacterium is a member of Enterobacteriaceae. It is capable of producing enterotoxins which are thermolabile or thermostable. Other characteristics of &quot;E. coli&quot; are that it is oxidase-negative, citrate-negative, methyl-red positive, and Voges-Proskauer-negative. To sum up &quot;E. coli&quot;, it is a coliform. It is able to use glucose and acetate as a carbon source for fermentation. &quot;E. coli&quot; is commonly found in the gut of living organisms. &quot;E. coli&quot; has many capabilities such as being a host for recombinant DNA and being a pathogen.

<text>A housing estate (or sometimes housing complex, housing development, [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]] or community) is a group of homes and other buildings built together as a single development. The exact form may vary from country to country.

Popular throughout the United States and the United Kingdom, they often consist of single family detached, semi-detached (&quot;duplex&quot;) or terraced homes, with separate ownership of each dwelling unit. Building density depends on local planning norms.

In major Asian cities, such as Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Singapore, Seoul, Taipei, and Tokyo, an estate may range from detached houses to high-density tower blocks with or without commercial facilities; in Europe and America, these may take the form of town housing, high-rise housing projects, or the older-style rows of terraced houses associated with the Industrial Revolution, detached or semi-detached houses with small plots of land around them forming gardens, and are frequently without commercial facilities and such.

In Central and Eastern Europe, living in housing estates is a common way of living. Most of these housing estates originated during the communist era because the construction of large housing estates was an important part of building plans in communist countries in Europe. They can be located in suburban and urban areas.

Accordingly, a housing estate is usually built by a single contractor, with only a few styles of house or building design, so they tend to be uniform in appearance.

A housing development is &quot;often erected on a tract of land by one builder and controlled by one management.&quot; In the United Kingdom, the term is quite broad and can include anything from high-rise government-subsidised housing right through to more upmarket, developer-led suburban tract housing. Such estates are usually designed to minimise through-traffic flows and provide recreational space in the form of parks and greens.

==Etymology==
The use of the term may have arisen from an area of housing being built on what had been a country estate as towns and cities expanded in and after the 19th century. It was in use by 1901.
Reduction of the phrase to mere &quot;estate&quot; is common in the United Kingdom and Ireland (especially when preceded by the specific estate name), but not in the United States.

== Housing types ==
There are several different housing types utilized by housing developers. Each of the different housing types will have their distinctive characteristics, density ranges, number of units, and floors.
*Single Detached: This type of housing will be detached from other housing types. This type of unit houses lower densities. Lawns are an option for this kind of design, with distinctive public and private spaces. A single detached can have up to three floors.
**Commonly referred to as: House, Cottage, Villa, or Bungalow.
*Duplex, Triplex: This type of housing can have two or three dwelling units in a detached building. The units could be together or separate depending on the location of the duplex. A duplex will also have an option for a yard in order to keep their private space. This type of housing will allow for higher density housing compared to the single detached units. Duplex, and Triplex can account for 2-3 units, and have up to 3 floors.
**Commonly referred to as: Semi-detached, Double House, Accessory unity, Ancillary unit, Carriage unit, or Twin Home.
*Big house, Multiplex: Big house, Multiplex can come in many forms, it can have a single or muli-level unit. Just like the duplex, it can have multiple floors, up to 3 floors. It can account for up to 5 units as well. This type of housing will have a higher density than single detached housing.
**Commonly referred to as: Quadruplex, Mansion townhomes, back to back semi-detached, or Grand house.
*Other types: Side Attached, Stacked Rowhouse, Small Apartment, Low-rise Apartment, Mid-rise Apartment, Apartment over Commercial, High-Rise Apartment.

==Asia==
===Hong Kong===
Due to dense population and government control of land use, Hong Kong&#x27;s most common residential housing form is the highrise housing estate, which may be publicly owned, privately owned, or semi-private. Due to the real-estate developers oligopoly (sometimes called real estate hegemony, ) in the territory, and the economies of scale of mass developments, there is the tendency of new private tower block developments with 10 to over 100 towers, ranging from 30 to 70 stories high.

Public housing provides affordable homes for those on low incomes, with rents which are heavily subsidised, financed by financial activities such as rents and charges collected from car parks and shops within or near the estates. They may vary in scale, and are usually located in the remote or less accessible parts of the territory, but urban expansion has put some of them in the heart of the urban area. Although some units are destined exclusively for rental, some of the flats within each development are earmarked for sale at prices that are lower than for private developments.

Private housing estates usually feature a cluster of high-rise buildings, often with its own shopping centre or market in the case of larger developments. Mei Foo Sun Chuen, built by Mobil, is the earliest (1965) and largest (99 blocks) example of its kind. Since the mid-1990s, private developers have been incorporating leisure facilities including clubhouse facilities, namely swimming pools, tennis courts and function rooms in their more up-market developments. The most recent examples would also have cinemas, dance studios, cigar-rooms.

Uniform high-rise developments may form &#x27;wall effect ()&#x27;, adversely affecting air circulation, causing some controversy. In-fill developments will tend to be done by smaller developers with less capital. These will be smaller in scale, and less prone to the wall effect.

===Pakistan===
Given the security situation and power shortages in South Asia, &#x27;gated communities&#x27; with self-generated energy and modern amenities (24-hour armed security, schools, hospitals, a fire department, retail shopping, restaurants and entertainment centres ) such as Bahria Town and DHA have been developed in all major Pakistani cities. Bahria Town is the largest private housing society in Asia. Bahria has been featured by international magazines and news agencies such as GlobalPost, Newsweek, Los Angeles Times and Emirates 24/7, referred to as the prosperous face of Pakistan. Gated communities in Pakistan are targeted towards upper middle class and upper class, and are mostly immune from problems of law enforcement.

==Europe==
===Czech Republic and Slovakia===
Forms of housing estates may vary in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. During the Communist era of Czechoslovakia, construction of large housing estates (, ) was an important part of building plans in the country, as the government wanted to provide large quantities of fast and affordable housing for all people, as well as to slash costs by employing uniform designs over the whole country. They also sought to foster a &quot;collectivistic&quot; in its people.

Most buildings in Czech and Slovak housing estates are the so called &quot;paneláks&quot;, a colloquial term in Czech and Slovak for a large panel system panel building constructed of pre-fabricated, pre-stressed concrete, such as those extant in the former Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic &amp; Slovakia) and elsewhere in the world. Large housing estates of concrete panel buildings (paneláks) now dominate the streets of Prague, Bratislava and other towns. The largest such housing estate in Central Europe can be found in Petržalka (population about 130,000), a part of the Slovak capital of Bratislava.

People living in these housing estates usually own their individual apartments, mainly due to the fact that majority of the individual apartments went from being publicly owned by the state to being privately owned, as they were sold to most apartment occupants by the government for small, symbolic prices after the fall of socialism. People can also rent apartments, usually through real estate agents and private landlords, although some apartments are still owned by the state and are usually used for social housing. There&#x27;s usually a mix of social classes in these housing estates.

===Britain and Ireland===

In Britain and Ireland, housing estates have become prevalent since the Second World War, as a more affluent population demanded larger and more widely spaced houses coupled with the increase of car usage for which terraced streets were unsuitable.

Housing estates were produced by either local authorities (more recently, housing associations) or by private developers. The former tended to be a means of producing public housing leading to monotenure estates full of council houses often known as &quot;council estates&quot;. The latter can refer to higher end tract housing for the middle class and even upper middle class.

The problems incurred by the early attempts at high density tower-block housing turned people away from this style of living. The resulting demand for land has seen many towns and cities increase in size for relatively moderate increases in population. This has been largely at the expense of rural and greenfield land. Recently, there has been some effort to address this problem by banning the development of out-of-town commercial developments and encouraging the reuse of brownfield or previously developed sites for residential building. Nevertheless, the demand for housing continues to rise, and in the UK at least has precipitated a significant housing crisis.

==North America==
===United States===
Forms of housing estates in the United States include tract housing, apartment complexes, and public housing.

<text>NOAA Weather Radio (NWR), also known as NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards, is an automated 24-hour network of VHF FM weather radio stations in the United States which broadcast weather information directly from a nearby National Weather Service office. Its routine programming cycle includes local or regional weather forecasts, synopsis, climate summaries or zone/lake/coastal waters forecasts, and can be shortened to specifically include hazardous weather outlooks, short-term forecasts, special weather statements or tropical weather summaries during hazardous weather events. It occasionally broadcasts other non-weather related events such as national security statements, natural disaster information, environmental and public safety statements such as AMBER Alerts, civil emergencies, fires, evacuation orders, and other hazards sourced from the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s (FCC) Emergency Alert System. NOAA Weather Radio uses automated broadcast technology that allows for the recycling of segments featured in one broadcast cycle into another and for consistent regular updating of segments to each of the transmitters.

Weather radios are widely sold online and in retail stores that specialize in consumer electronics in Canada and the US. They are available in many supermarkets and drugstores in the southern and midwestern US, which are particularly susceptible to severe weather—large portions of these regions are commonly referred to as &quot;Tornado Alley&quot;.


== History ==
The U.S. Weather Bureau first began broadcasting marine weather information in Chicago and New York City on two VHF radio stations in 1960 as an experiment. Proving to be successful, the broadcasts expanded to serve the general public in coastal regions in the 1960s and early 1970s. By early 1970, ESSA listed 20 U.S. cities using 162.55 MHz and one using 163.275 &quot;ESSA VHF Radio Weather.&quot; Later, the U.S. Weather Bureau adopted its current name, National Weather Service (NWS), and was operating 29 VHF-FM weather-radio transmitters under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which replaced ESSA in 1970. The service was designed with boaters, fishermen, travelers and more in mind, allowing listeners to quickly receive a &quot;life-saving&quot; weather bulletin from their local weather forecast office (WFO), along with routinely updated forecasts and other climatological data in a condensed format at any time of the day or night. The general public could have the latest weather updates when they needed them, and the benefit of more lead-time to prepare during severe conditions. In 1974, NOAA Weather Radio (NWR), as it was now called, reached about 44 percent of the U.S. population over 66 nationwide transmitters. NWR grew to over 300 stations by the late 1970s.

Local NWS staff were the voices heard on NWR stations from its inception until the late 1990s when &quot;Paul&quot; was introduced. The messages were recorded on tape, and later by digital means, then placed in the broadcast cycle. This technology limited the programming variability and locked it into a repetitive sequential order. It also slowed down the speed of warning messages when severe weather happened, because each NWS office could have up to eight transmitters. &quot;Paul&quot; was a computerized voice using the DECtalk text-to-speech system. &quot;Paul&#x27;s&quot; voice was dissatisfactory and difficult to understand; thus &quot;Craig&quot;, &quot;Tom,&quot; &quot;Donna&quot; and later &quot;Javier&quot; were introduced in 2002 using the Speechify text-to-speech system from SpeechWorks (not to be confused with the iOS app of the same name). A completely new voice from the VoiceText text-to-speech system, also named &quot;Paul&quot;, was introduced in 2016 and implemented nationwide by late in the year. Live human voices are still used occasionally for weekly tests of the Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) and 1,050 Hz tone alerting systems, station IDs, and in the event of system failure or computer upgrades. They will also be used on some stations for updates on the time and radio frequency.

In the 1990s, the National Weather Service adopted plans to implement SAME technology nationwide; the roll-out moved slowly until 1995, when the U.S. government provided the budget needed to develop the SAME technology across the entire radio network. Nationwide implementation occurred in 1997 when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the SAME standard as part of its new Emergency Alert System (EAS). NOAA Weather Radio&#x27;s public alerting responsibilities expanded from hazardous weather-only events to &quot;all hazards&quot; being broadcast.

=== Expansion ===
In the wake of the 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak, one of the key recommendations from the U.S. Weather Bureau&#x27;s storm survey team, was the establishment of a nationwide radio network that could be used to broadcast weather warnings to the general public, hospitals, key institutions, news media, schools, and the public safety community. Starting in 1966, the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) started a nationwide program known as &quot;ESSA VHF Weather Radio Network.&quot; In the early 1970s, this was changed to NOAA Weather Radio. The service was expanded to coastal locations during the 1970s in the wake of Hurricane Camille based upon recommendations made by the Department of Commerce after the storm in September 1969.

Since then, a proliferation of stations have been installed and activated to ensure near-complete geographical coverage and &quot;weather-readiness&quot;, many of which have been funded by state emergency management agencies in cooperation with the NOAA to expand the network, or state public broadcasting networks. To avoid interference and allow for more specific area coverage, the number of frequencies in use by multiple stations grew to two with the addition of 162.400 MHz in 1970 followed by the third (162.475) in 1975 with the remaining four (162.425, 162.450, 162.500 &amp; 162.525) coming into use by 1981.

In the 1950s, the Weather Bureau started with KWO35 in New York City and later added KWO39 in Chicago. By 1965 it had added KID77 in Kansas City, home to the Severe Local Storms Center, as the third continuous VHF radio transmitter with the fourth, KBA99 in Honolulu, operating by January 1967.

Denver became the 60th NWR station in September 1972 and by December 1976 there were roughly 100 stations transmitting on three channels in December 1976.
Growth accelerated in the mid-1970s with NWR reaching 200 radio stations in May 1978 with WXK49 in Memphis, Tennessee; 300 in September 1979 with WXL45 in Columbia, Missouri; and by 1988, the NWS operated about 380 stations covering approximately 90 percent of the nation&#x27;s population. This grew to over 500 radio stations by May 1999, and over 800 by the end of 2001. As of January 2020, there were about 1,032 stations in operation in fifty states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and Saipan, with over 95% effective coverage.

==Operations==
The NOAA Weather Radio network is provided as a public service by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA also provides secondary weather information, usually limited to marine storm warnings for sea vessels navigating the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, to HF band &quot;time stations&quot; WWV and WWVH. These shortwave radio stations continuously broadcast time signals and disseminate the &quot;official&quot; U.S. Government time, and are operated by the Department of Commerce&#x27;s National Institute of Standards and Technology.

=== Radio ===
The radio service transmits weather and marine forecasts (where applicable) and other related information, without any interruptions. In addition, NWR works in cooperation with the FCC&#x27;s Emergency Alert System (EAS), providing comprehensive severe weather alerts and civil emergency information. In conjunction with federal, state and local emergency managers and other public officials, NWR has the ability to broadcast alerts and post-event information for all types of hazards, including natural (such as earthquakes or avalanches), human-made (such as chemical releases or oil spills), technological (such as nuclear power plant emergencies) and other public safety (such as &quot;AMBER alerts&quot; or 9-1-1 telephone outages). Listening to a NOAA Weather Radio station requires a VHF radio receiver or scanner capable of receiving at least one of seven specific VHF-FM channels within the frequency range of 162.400 through 162.550 MHz, collectively known as the &quot;Weather Band&quot;. For example, a receiver that only tunes in standard AM or FM broadcast stations will not suffice.

=== Television ===

Many cable television systems and some commercial television stations will, during EAS activation, rebroadcast the audio of a warning message first heard on their local NWR station, to alert viewers of a severe weather event or civil emergency, usually with the issuance of a tornado warning or tornado emergency, especially in tornado-prone areas of the country.

==Programming==
===Broadcast schedule===
Local NOAA offices update the content broadcast over NOAA Weather Radio transmitters on a regular basis, according to the following schedule:
Updates to routine observational products are typically recorded once per hour, and are broadcast at five or 10, and at 15 minutes past the hour.

===Broadcast routine===


As a continuous spoken weather service, NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards maintains a multi-tier concept for relaying meteorological observations, routine forecasts and weather hazards to the general public. Actual forecasts and offered products vary by the area serviced by the transmitter. During severe weather situations, Watch Information Statements for government-designated jurisdictions served by the local NWR station are typically inserted within the station&#x27;s normal playlist of routine products; a special severe weather playlist temporarily suspends most regularly scheduled routine products in the event National Weather Service-issued warnings (mainly severe thunderstorm, tornado or flash flood warnings) are in effect for the station&#x27;s broadcast area, which solely incorporate watch, warning and Special Weather Statements, and any active Short-Term Forecasts and Hazardous Weather Outlooks.


These are additional products that are included in the broadcast cycle occasionally (but are broadcast at randomized times, depending on the individual transmitter[s]):
* Air Quality Index Statement
* Agricultural Forecast
* Area Forecast Discussion
* Area Weather Update
* Daily/Monthly Hydrometeorological Products
* Heat Index Forecast
* High Seas Forecast
* Hydro-Met Data Report
* Miscellaneous Hydrologic Data
* Miscellaneous Local Product
* Miscellaneous River Product
* Public Information Statement
* Offshore Forecast
* Quantitative Precipitation Forecast
* State Forecast
* Suppression Forecast
* Tabular State Forecast
* Terminal Aerodrome Forecast
* Travellers Forecast

== Weather radio receivers ==

There are a variety of different types of weather radio receivers available in the U.S., including:
* Professional-grade receivers, typically rack-mounted, for use by broadcast radio and television stations and public agencies who are responsible for acting on or retransmitting weather and emergency alert broadcasts.
* Base-station consumer radios powered by commercial AC power (often with a battery backup).
* Hand-held battery powered radios, suitable for use by hikers, boaters, and in emergency preparedness kits.
* Hand-crank portable radios that do not require AC or battery power, especially designed for use in emergency preparedness kits.
* Weather radio receivers integrated as an auxiliary function into other devices, such as GMRS radios, portable televisions, FM radios, etc.
* Radio receiver modules, such as the Si4707 from Silicon Labs, designed for electronics experimenters and project builders have in the past been available.
Historically, it was not uncommon to sell portable radios that featured AM, FM, and TV audio (VHF channels 2–13), with the weather band included some distance down the dial from TV channel 7 (after the U.S. digital TV conversion, the television sound function of these radios became obsolete).

One of the early consumer weather alert radios (model KH6TY) was designed and manufactured by Howard (Skip) Teller, who was issued a patent on the alerting mechanism and was instrumental in the design of the PSK31 Digipan software and hardware, and the Amateur radio NBEMS emergency communications system.

Since April 2004, radio models marketed as &quot;Public Alert-certified&quot; must include these features and meet certain performance criteria, as specified in electronics industry standard CEA-2009.

The price of a consumer-grade weather radio varies depending on the model and its extra features.
==Radio frequencies used==

The United States&#x27; NWS, Canada&#x27;s Weatheradio, Mexico&#x27;s SARMEX and Bermuda operate their government weather radio stations on the same marine VHF radio band, using FM transmitters, and the same seven frequencies (162.400 – 162.550 MHz) as NOAA Weather Radio (NWR). Bermuda only uses 162.550 (land) and 162.400 (marine).

NWR transmitters operate VHF-FM between 5–1,000 watts. NWR channels operating in the range of 162.3625–162.5875 MHz (162.4–.55 ± 37.5 kHz) have a band spacing of 25 kHz and may have bandwidths up to 16 kHz. The original &quot;weather&quot; frequency used by multiple stations was 162.550 MHz, followed by 162.400 in 1970, 162.475 in 1975, and the last four (162.425, 162.450, 162.500 &amp; 162.525 MHz) in 1981.

163.275 MHz was used by KHB47 in New London, Connecticut initially in 1969 until switching to 162.400 in 1970 to avoid overlapping with KWO35 in New York, and internally by NWS in case of power outage, but is no longer in active use. 169.075 MHz was initially used by WWG75 transmitting from Mt. Haleakala on Maui in 1970 before also switching to 162.400 by 1972.

===Channel designations===
NOAA Weather Radio, Weatheradio Canada and SARMEX all refer to the seven stations by their frequencies (MHz):
Other channel designations such as WX1 through WX7 &quot;have no special significance but are often designated this way in consumer equipment&quot; and &quot;other channel numbering schemes are also prevalent/possible&quot; according to NOAA and USCG. Ordering channels by when they were established (WX1, WX2, ...) is &quot;becoming less &#x27;popular&#x27; over time than a numerical ordering of channels.&quot; Weather radios may list stations in the order of their WX#, or by a &quot;Preset Channel&quot; number 1 through 7 in ascending frequency order.

The &quot;WX#&quot; format is continued from WX8 up to WX12 on some lists and radios to include 163.275 MHz and or one or more of the Canadian continuous marine broadcast (CMB) frequencies 161.650, 161.775, 161.750, 162.000. Unlike WX1-WX7 typically ordered by frequency adoption by NWS, there is no consistent frequency inclusion nor assignment for WX8-WX12. Effective January 1, 2019, channels 2027 (161.950 MHz, 27B) and 2028 (162.000 MHz, 28B) are designated as ASM 1 and ASM 2 respectively for application specific messages (ASM) as described in Recommendation ITU-R M.2092.

The &quot;WX&quot; arose from the Morse code prosign shorthand for weather reports (WX) combined with the order number that the seven frequencies were adopted for use nationally. More frequencies helped prevent interference from other nearby transmitters, growing in use in the 1990s in less populated rural, areas and as fill-in broadcast translators relaying an existing station or sending a separate, more localized broadcast into remote or mountainous areas, or those areas with reception trouble.

As with conventional broadcast television and radio signals, it may be possible to receive more than one of the seven weather channels at a given location, dependent on factors such as the location, transmitter power, range and designated coverage area of each station. The NWS suggests that users determine which frequency (as opposed to channel) is intended for their specific location so that they are assured of receiving correct and timely information.

===Present day===

All seven NWR channels are available on stand-alone weather radio receivers that are sold online and in retail stores (available for prices ranging from US$20 and up), as well as on most marine VHF radio transceivers, amateur radios and digital scanners. In addition, more mainstream consumer electronics, such as clock radios, portable multi-band receivers and two-way radios (such as FRS, GMRS and CB radio), now feature the ability to also receive NWR channels. Many of the aforementioned devices also incorporate automatic alerting capabilities. Many American television stations offer discounted pricing for radios to viewers as a public courtesy (especially in highly tornado-prone areas), where they are often marketed as an essential safety device on par with a smoke alarm for home fires.

===Coverage===
According to NOAA, reliable signal reception typically extends in about 40 miles radius from a full-power (1,000 W) transmitter, depending on level terrain. However, signal blockages can occur, especially in mountainous areas. As of 2016, there are over a thousand NWR transmitters across the U.S., covering 95% of the population. Because each transmitter can cover several counties, typically a person will program their weather radio to receive only the alerts for their county or nearby surrounding counties where weather systems are most likely to move in from.

==Alerting==

Whenever a weather or civil emergency alert is issued for any part of a NWR station&#x27;s coverage area, many radios with an alert feature will sound an alarm or turn on upon detection of a that sounds just before the voice portion of an alert message. The specification calls for the NWS transmitter to sound the alert tone for ten seconds and for the receiver to react to it within five seconds. This system simply triggers the alarm or turns on the radio of every muted receiver within reception range of that NWR station (in other words, any receiver located &quot;anywhere&quot; within the transmitter&#x27;s broadcast area). Generally, receivers with this functionality are either older or basic models.

Many newer or more sophisticated alerting receivers can detect, decode and react to a digital signal called Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME), which allows users to program their radios to receive alerts only for specific geographical areas of interest and concern, rather than for an entire broadcast area. These advanced models may also have colored LED status lights which indicate the level of the alert as an &quot;advisory&quot;/&quot;statement&quot;, &quot;watch&quot; or &quot;warning&quot; (either amber or green for advisories and statements, orange or yellow for watches, red for warnings).

When an alert is transmitted, the is broadcast first (heard as three repeated audio &quot;bursts&quot;), followed by the 1,050 Hz attention tone, then the voice message, then the end-of-message (EOM) data signal (repeated quickly three times). This encoding/decoding technology has the advantage of avoiding &quot;false alarms&quot; triggered by the 1,050 Hz tone itself in locations outside the intended warning area. Broadcast areas are generally divided into SAME locations by county or marine zone using the standard U.S. Government FIPS county codes.

NOAA&#x27;s SAME alert protocol was later adopted and put into use by the Emergency Alert System (EAS) in 1997 – the replacement for the earlier Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) and even earlier CONELRAD – now required by the FCC for standard broadcast TV and radio stations. Environment Canada eventually integrated SAME alerting capability into its Weatheradio Canada network in 2004. Organizations are able to disseminate and coordinate emergency alerts and warning messages through NOAA Weather Radio and other public systems by means of the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System.

In September 2008, Walgreens announced that it would utilize SAME technology to deliver local weather alerts via a system of LED billboards located outside its drugstore locations to provide an additional avenue of weather information. Many national billboard companies (such as Outfront Media, Clear Channel Outdoor and Lamar, among others) also use their color LED billboard networks to display weather warnings to drivers, while state-owned freeway notification boards, which utilize the EAS/NOAA infrastructure for AMBER Alerts, also display weather warnings.

==Emergency alert test procedure==


Every local National Weather Service weather forecast office is required to conduct a scheduled weekly test of the NOAA Weather Radio public alert system, generally occurring every Wednesday between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. (noon). Certain Weather Forecast Offices conduct this twice a week, usually testing two time on Wednesday, usually between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. (noon) and then again between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. Other offices test once on Wednesday, and then again on Saturday. Some NOAA Weather Radio stations also broadcast tests of the Emergency Alert System on predetermined days and times.

If there is a threat of severe weather that day in a NWR station&#x27;s listening area, the weekly test is postponed until the next available fair-weather day (sometimes, a short message stating the reason for the test&#x27;s cancellation is broadcast). The required weekly test (SAME event code &quot;RWT&quot;) interrupts regular NWR programming — during the test, a SAME data header is sent, followed by a 1050 Hz attention tone, the voice test message, then a SAME end-of-message (EOM) signal. The text of the test message used by most NWS offices, with variations depending on the office, is typically as follows:

Or, for other offices which test on Wednesday:

==Voices==
From the introduction of NOAA Weather Radio until the late 1990s, nearly all the voices heard in the broadcasts were those of the staff at local National Weather Service (NWS) offices. The messages were manually recorded, first on tape cartridges and later digitally, and then placed in the broadcast cycle. As the NWS added more transmitters to provide broader radio coverage, the staff had difficulty keeping broadcast cycles updated in a timely fashion, especially during major severe weather outbreaks.

=== System upgrades ===
==== 1990s Console Replacement System ====
To manage the increasing number of transmitters for each office and to speed the overall delivery of warning messages to the public, the Console Replacement System (CRS) was deployed at NWS weather forecast offices in 1997. CRS introduced a computerized voice nicknamed &quot;Paul&quot;, using a text-to-speech system which was based on the DECtalk technology. This system was chosen over more readily available concatenative synthesis because each forecast, watch and warning requires unique wording to relay the most accurate and relevant information. Concatenation is typically used by telephone companies, banks and other service businesses where a limited vocabulary of recorded words can easily take the place of specific, repetitive phrases and sentences. NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts contain a wide variety of information which changes with the weather. Forecasters need to have many words to choose from when writing their forecasts and warnings for the public. Although CRS greatly enhanced the delivery speed and scheduling of Weather Radio messages, some listeners disliked Paul&#x27;s voice, as it was very monotone and did not resemble a normal speaking voice due to CRS not having the technological advances at the time to resemble human speech patterns.
==== 2002 Voice Improvement Program ====
In 2002, the National Weather Service contracted with Siemens Information and Communication and SpeechWorks to introduce improved, more natural voices. The Voice Improvement Plan (VIP) was implemented, involving a separate computer processor linked into CRS that fed digitized sound files to the broadcast suite. The improvements involved one male voice (&quot;Craig&quot;), and one female voice (&quot;Donna&quot;). Additional upgrades in 2003 improved &quot;Donna&quot; and introduced an improved male voice nicknamed &quot;Tom&quot;, which had variable intonation based on the urgency of the report. As part of this upgrade, a Spanish voice, &quot;Javier&quot;, was added at a few sites. Due to the superior quality of the &quot;Tom&quot; voice, most NWS offices used it for the majority of broadcasts and announcements.
====Broadcast Message Handler====
In 2016, the NWS replaced almost all of the CRS systems in operation at its Weather Forecast Offices—which had been in use for over 20 years and were approaching the end of the system&#x27;s expected service life—with the Broadcast Message Handler (BMH). The new system is more closely integrated with the AWIPS software and intended to be more reliable. The BMH units replaced &quot;Donna&quot; and &quot;Tom&quot; with an improved &quot;Paul&quot; voice (its classification from new voice partner NeoSpeech). Many stations have dubbed him &quot;Paul II&quot; or &quot;Paul Jr&quot; to avoid confusion with CRS &quot;Perfect Paul&quot;. For the NWS offices that incorporate Spanish programming into the NWR broadcast cycle, VIP &quot;Javier&quot; was replaced with a much improved female voice named &quot;Violetta&quot; (another voice from NeoSpeech). The upgrade initially began at six offices: Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina; Brownsville, Texas; Omaha, Nebraska; Portland, Oregon; Anchorage, Alaska; and Tiyan, Guam. Many of the stations saw an initial negative reaction primarily due to many mispronunciations. Most local NWS Offices provide a method of reporting these problems, and have the ability to reprogram the voices accordingly.
=== Human voices ===
Human voices are still heard on occasion, but sparingly, mainly during station identifications, public forecasts, National Marine Fisheries Service messages, public information statements, public service announcements, required weekly tests, and severe weather events. The capability exists for a meteorologist to broadcast live on any transmitter if computer problems occur or added emphasis is desired, or to notify listeners who are concerned about a silent station on another frequency whether that station is dark due to technical errors, prolonged power outage, or a weather event has forced it off the air.

=== Broadcasting in Spanish ===
Some weather forecast offices will issue a secondary report in Spanish during severe weather events or warnings. Few NWR stations broadcast weather information in Spanish. Four offices use dedicated stations which broadcast in the Spanish language, separate from their corresponding English-language channels: San Diego (WNG712 in Coachella/Riverside), El Paso (WNG652), Miami (WZ2531 in Hialeah, since 2012), and Brownsville (WZ2541 in Pharr and WZ2542 in Harlingen, since 2014). These stations originally used a synthesized Spanish male voice named &quot;Javier&quot; for all broadcasts, but have since been upgraded with the BMH female voice &quot;Violetta&quot;. The Albuquerque WFO often repeats weather alerts in Spanish after their initial dissemination in English. Station WXJ69 in San Juan, Puerto Rico broadcasts all information, including forecasts, in the same manner.

==Live streaming==
Several websites provide internet audio streaming of a subset of the NOAA Weather radio stations. The most prominent of these, the Wunderadio section of weather information website Weather Underground, discontinued live streams of NWR broadcasts in April 2017.
As the Wunderadio internet streaming service dissolved, many sources such as noaaweatherradio.org, broadcastify.com, weatherusa.net/radio and PlanoWeather developed, allowing previous users of the service to continue monitoring live streams from Wunderadio, as well as newer broadcasts from different locations.

<doc id="300433" wikidata="Q1137504" url="?curid=300433" title="SoHo, Hong Kong">
<text>SoHo (Chinese: ; also and 荷南美食區; formally 中環蘇豪區) is an area of Hong Kong located on the western edge of Central, bordering Sheung Wan, known for its bars, restaurants and entertainment venues. The name is derived from its location: South of [[SoHo, Hong Kong|Ho]]llywood Road.

==History==
The Central–Mid-Levels escalator was built in 1993; the now vibrant character of SoHo is attributed to the creation of the escalator system, which at the time was the longest escalator system in the world. Prior to the escalator construction, the area was populated by many elderly locals, old go-downs and porcelain shops.

The area now consists of restaurants, bars, nightclubs, art galleries and antique stores of Staunton Street and Elgin Street. SoHo also is home to the first full-time comedy club in Asia, The TakeOut Comedy Club Hong Kong. Hong Kong taxi drivers usually regard &quot;SoHo&quot; to mean either Staunton Street or Elgin Street.

Buildings in the SoHo area are a mix of commercial/residential, with the commercial businesses on the lower floors, and residential above the First Floors. Around the same time the Mid-Levels Escalator was built, a few foreigners started to move into the area, taking up both commercial premises and renting flats. At the time the flats were cheaper than other expat areas in Hong Kong, and only a few minutes&#x27; walk from the business district.

The name SoHo was first mentioned in a 1996 article in the South China Morning Post newspaper attributed to Elgin Street restaurant owner Thomas Goetz, who came up with the acronym. Goetz was also instrumental in forming SoHo&#x27;s first business group, and The SoHo Association Limited (TSAL) was established in 1998 to represent its members in relation to difficulties they were experiencing with the local government departments in relation to licensing, and to collectively promote the area. The first Chairman was Jean-Paul Gauci, who had opened many businesses in the area.

However, in 2000, Democratic Party member Kam Nai-wai wanted to see SoHo formally renamed the &quot;Elgin/Staunton Street Themed Dining Area&quot;, and Kam and some long-term residents associated the name SoHo with being a place of disrepute, with red light district associations. The irony is Elgin Street was known in the 1860s as &quot;Hung Mo Giu Gai,&quot; or &quot;Foreign Girls Street,&quot; due to the vast number of European-staffed brothels. It was renamed after Lord Elgin, British envoy to China, during the Second Opium War (1857–1860). For several years the Democratic Party fought an ongoing battle against the new bars and restaurants in the area, and also against formal adoption of the name &quot;SoHo&quot;, preferring instead the descriptive &quot;Staunton/Elgin Street Themed Dining Area&quot; so as not to associate the area with alcohol consumption. The name &quot;SoHo&quot; could also cause association with the London area of the same name.

Like much of Hong Kong, this district treads a precarious balance between preserving the Chinese and colonial culture that shaped it, and recent modern developments. The escalator is a quintessential symbol of modernity which has encroached on the residential neighbourhood, bringing with it expats and the bars, cafes and boutiques which help cocoon some from Cantonese traditions.

The contrast between the past and present enriches the area and makes for great sightseeing on foot. The newly signposted &quot;Sun Yat-sen Historical Trail&quot; guides visitors along 16 points of historical interest from The University of Hong Kong to Central, taking in century old steps and leafy residential lanes. Unfortunately, most of the sites from Dr Sun&#x27;s past have long been razed, replaced by concrete skyscrapers that are characteristic of 21st century Hong Kong. Even the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Museum&#x27;s grandiose facade off Caine Road is easy to miss, perched as it is upon Castle Road which turns up through Mid-Levels, surrounded by modern blocks.

Nowhere is the contrast more apparent than on the northern edge of SoHo, on Hollywood Road itself where the brand new multistorey Centre Stage upscale residential complex towers alongside the historic Man Mo Temple.

<doc id="300441" wikidata="Q3124270" url="?curid=300441" title="Lan Kwai Fong">
<text>Lan Kwai Fong (often abbreviated as LKF) is a small square of streets in Central, Hong Kong. The area was dedicated to hawkers before the Second World War, but underwent a renaissance in the mid-1980s. It is now a popular expatriate haunt in Hong Kong for drinking, clubbing, and dining. The street Lan Kwai Fong is L-shaped with two ends joining with D&#x27;Aguilar Street.

==Location==
Lan Kwai Fong as an area is defined by D&#x27;Aguilar Street and the smaller lane, Lan Kwai Fong, an L-shaped, cobble-stoned lane. Both streets turn 90 degrees to form a rectangle. It is near the Mid-Levels. Its eating and drinking establishments are considered upmarket in price and the area is also considered a tourist spot. From the west side of the rectangle, Wo On Lane and Wing Wah Lane extend to host several more spots for drinks and food. The area arguably extends to Wellington Street and Wyndham Street, through to the Hong Kong Fringe Club. It is also home to a small number of art galleries.

==History==
Before the Second World War, Lan Kwai Fong was dedicated to hawkers.

In early days, the square housed many mui yan (), female marriage arrangers who were intermediaries between two families in traditional times. It was consequently known as Mui Yan Hong or Hung Leung Hong. 

After the opening of the disco club &quot;Disco Disco&quot; by Gordon Huthart on 23 December 1978 in the basement of 40 D&#x27;Aguilar Street, the development of the Lan Kwai Fong area accelerated, and it became known worldwide. The disco club was popular among celebrities and expats until it closed in 1986.

Inspired by Montreal&#x27;s Crescent Street, the Montreal-raised businessman Allan Zeman opened a restaurant called &quot;California&quot; on Lan Kwai Fong in 1983, as a place for expats, earning him the nickname &quot;the Father of Lan Kwai Fong&quot; (). 

Between 2011 and 2015, a massive change was underway, following Zeman&#x27;s decision to replace his block in Lan Kwai Fong, which led to a substantial area of Lan Kwai Fong becoming a construction site.

==Special occasions==
The crowds during special occasions such as Halloween or New Year&#x27;s Eve put the place at a literal standstill with the large numbers. Police control is employed at such times, to manage the crowds.

==Street culture==
In recent years, street performing has become a new scene in Hong Kong&#x27;s street culture. Some of the performers decide to set their stages at Lan Kwai Fong, usually with the medium of singing and playing guitar in an acoustic setting.

==New Years Eve tragedy==
On 1 January 1993, 21 people were killed and 62 injured in a large-scale human crush incident whilst celebrating the New Year&#x27;s Day in Lan Kwai Fong.

More than 15,000 people were crammed into the area for the New Year countdown at the time. As midnight approached there was a crowd collapse. The Hong Kong government appointed Court of First Instance judge Kemal Bokhary to conduct an inquest into the disaster. The stringent crowd control measures now in force at major holidays and events are a direct consequence of the inquest&#x27;s recommendations.

==Transport==
There are several ways to access Lan Kwai Fong other than taxi, which include:

Public transport

*MTR, Central station, Exit &quot;D2&quot;
*Airport Express, Hong Kong station, Exit &quot;B2&quot; or &quot;C&quot;
*Public bus, route no. 12M, 13 and 40M

<doc id="300445" wikidata="Q407172" url="?curid=300445" title="Human chorionic gonadotropin">
<text>Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone for the maternal recognition of pregnancy produced by trophoblast cells that are surrounding a growing embryo (syncytiotrophoblast initially), which eventually forms the placenta after implantation. The presence of hCG is detected in some pregnancy tests (HCG pregnancy strip tests). Some cancerous tumors produce this hormone; therefore, elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant may lead to a cancer diagnosis and, if high enough, paraneoplastic syndromes, however, it is unknown whether this production is a contributing cause or an effect of carcinogenesis. The pituitary analog of hCG, known as luteinizing hormone (LH), is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages.

Beta-hCG is initially secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast.

== Structure ==

Human chorionic gonadotropin is a glycoprotein composed of 237 amino acids with a molecular mass of 36.7 kDa, approximately 14.5kDa αhCG and 22.2kDa βhCG.

It is heterodimeric, with an α (alpha) subunit identical to that of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and a β (beta) subunit that is unique to hCG.
* The α (alpha) subunit is 92 amino acids long.
* The β-subunit of hCG gonadotropin (beta-hCG) contains 145 amino acids, encoded by six highly homologous genes that are arranged in tandem and inverted pairs on chromosome 19q13.3 - &quot;CGB&quot; (&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;). It is known that CGB7 has a sequence slightly different from that of the others.

The two subunits create a small hydrophobic core surrounded by a high surface area-to-volume ratio: 2.8 times that of a sphere. The vast majority of the outer amino acids are hydrophilic.

beta-hCG is mostly similar to beta-LH, with the exception of a Carboxy Terminus Peptide (beta-CTP) containing four glycosylated serine residues that is responsible for hCG&#x27;s longer half-life.

== Function ==

Human chorionic gonadotropin interacts with the LHCG receptor of the ovary and promotes the maintenance of the corpus luteum for the maternal recognition of pregnancy at the beginning of pregnancy. This allows the corpus luteum to secrete the hormone progesterone during the first trimester. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can sustain the growing fetus.

It has been hypothesized that hCG may be a placental link for the development of local maternal immunotolerance. For example, hCG-treated endometrial cells induce an increase in T cell apoptosis (dissolution of T cells). These results suggest that hCG may be a link in the development of peritrophoblastic immune tolerance, and may facilitate the trophoblast invasion, which is known to expedite fetal development in the endometrium. It has also been suggested that hCG levels are linked to the severity of morning sickness or hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnant women.

Because of its similarity to LH, hCG can also be used clinically to induce ovulation in the ovaries as well as testosterone production in the testes. As the most abundant biological source is in women who are presently pregnant, some organizations collect urine from pregnant women to extract hCG for use in fertility treatment.

Human chorionic gonadotropin also plays a role in cellular differentiation/proliferation and may activate apoptosis.

==Production==
Naturally, it is produced in the human placenta by the syncytiotrophoblast.

Like any other gonadotropins, it can be extracted from the urine of pregnant women or produced from cultures of genetically modified cells using recombinant DNA technology.

In Pubergen, Pregnyl, Follutein, Profasi, Choragon and Novarel, it is extracted from the urine of pregnant women. In Ovidrel, it is produced with recombinant DNA technology.

==hCG forms==
Three major forms of hCG are produced by humans, with each having distinct physiological roles. These include regular hCG, hyperglycosylated hCG, and the free beta-subunit of hCG. Degradation products of hCG have also been detected, including nicked hCG, hCG missing the C-terminal peptide from the beta-subunit, and free alpha-subunit, which has no known biological function. Some hCG is also made by the pituitary gland with a pattern of glycosylation that differs from placental forms of hCG.

Regular hCG is the main form of hCG associated with the majority of pregnancy and in non-invasive molar pregnancies. This is produced in the trophoblast cells of the placental tissue. Hyperglycosylated hCG is the main form of hCG during the implantation phase of pregnancy, with invasive molar pregnancies, and with choriocarcinoma.

Gonadotropin preparations of hCG can be produced for pharmaceutical use from animal or synthetic sources.

==Testing==

Blood or urine tests measure hCG. These can be pregnancy tests. hCG-positive can indicate an implanted blastocyst and mammalian embryogenesis or can be detected for a short time following childbirth or pregnancy loss. Tests can be done to diagnose and monitor germ cell tumors and gestational trophoblastic diseases.

Concentrations are commonly reported in thousandth international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). The international unit of hCG was originally established in 1938 and has been redefined in 1964 and in 1980. At the present time, 1 international unit is equal to approximately 2.35×10−12 moles, or about 6×10−8 grams.

It is also possible to test for hCG to have an approximation of the gestational age.

===Methodology===

Most tests employ a monoclonal antibody, which is specific to the &quot;β-subunit&quot; of hCG (β-hCG). This procedure is employed to ensure that tests do not make false positives by confusing hCG with LH and FSH. (The latter two are always present at varying levels in the body, whereas the presence of hCG almost always indicates pregnancy.)

Many hCG immunoassays are based on the sandwich principle, which uses antibodies to hCG labeled with an enzyme or a conventional or luminescent dye.
Pregnancy urine dipstick tests are based on the lateral flow technique.
* The urine test may be a &quot;chromatographic immunoassay&quot; or any of several other test formats, home-, physician&#x27;s office-, or laboratory-based. Published detection thresholds range from 20 to 100 mIU/mL, depending on the brand of test. Early in pregnancy, more accurate results may be obtained by using the first urine of the morning (when urine is most concentrated). When the urine is dilute (specific gravity less than 1.015), the hCG concentration may not be representative of the blood concentration, and the test may be falsely negative.
* The serum test, using 2-4 mL of venous blood, is typically a chemiluminescent or fluorimetric immunoassay that can detect βhCG levels as low as 5 mIU/mL and allows quantification of the βhCG concentration.

===Reference levels in normal pregnancy===
The hCG levels grow exponentially after conception and implantation. hCG levels typically peak around weeks 8-11 of pregnancy and are generally higher in the first trimester compared to the second trimester.

The following is a list of serum hCG levels:

&quot;LMP&quot; is the last menstrual period dated from the first day of the last menstrual period 

If a pregnant woman has serum hCG levels that are higher than expected, they may be experiencing a multiple pregnancy or an abnormal uterine growth. Falling hCG levels may indicate the possibility of a miscarriage. hCG levels which are rising at a slower rate than expected may indicate an ectopic pregnancy.

===Interpretation===
The ability to quantitate the βhCG level is useful in monitoring germ cell and trophoblastic tumors, follow-up care after miscarriage, and diagnosis of and follow-up care after treatment of ectopic pregnancy. The lack of a visible fetus on vaginal ultrasound after βhCG levels reach 1500 mIU/mL is strongly indicative of an ectopic pregnancy. Still, even an hCG over 2000 IU/L does not necessarily exclude the presence of a viable intrauterine pregnancy in such cases.

As pregnancy tests, quantitative blood tests and the most sensitive urine tests usually detect hCG between 6 and 12 days after ovulation. It must be taken into account, however, that total hCG levels may vary in a very wide range within the first 4 weeks of gestation, leading to false results during this period. A rise of 35% over 48 hours is proposed as the minimal rise consistent with a viable intrauterine pregnancy.

=== Associations with pathologies ===
Gestational trophoblastic disease like hydatidiform moles (&quot;molar pregnancy&quot;) or choriocarcinoma may produce high levels of βhCG due to the presence of syncytiotrophoblasts, part of the villi that make up the placenta, and despite the absence of an embryo. This, as well as several other conditions, can lead to elevated hCG readings in the absence of pregnancy.

hCG levels are also a component of the triple test, a screening test for certain fetal chromosomal abnormalities/birth defects. High hCG levels in the maternal serum could suggest Down syndrome, potentially due to continued hCG production by the placenta beyond the first trimester.

A study of 32 normal pregnancies came to the result that a gestational sac of 1–3 mm was detected at a mean hCG level of 1150 IU/L (range 800–1500), a yolk sac was detected at a mean level of 6000 IU/L (range 4500–7500) and fetal heartbeat was visible at a mean hCG level of 10,000 IU/L (range 8650–12,200).

==Uses==

===Tumor marker===
Human chorionic gonadotropin can be used as a tumor marker, as its β subunit is secreted by some cancers including seminoma, choriocarcinoma, teratoma with elements of choriocarcinoma, other germ cell tumors, hydatidiform mole, and islet cell tumor. For this reason, a positive result in males can be a test for testicular cancer. The normal range for men is between 0-5 mIU/mL. Combined with alpha-fetoprotein, β-HCG is an excellent tumor marker for the monitoring of germ cell tumors. 

===Fertility===

Human chorionic gonadotropin injection is extensively used for final maturation induction in lieu of luteinizing hormone. In the presence of one or more mature ovarian follicles, ovulation can be triggered by the administration of HCG. As ovulation will happen between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection, procedures can be scheduled to take advantage of this time sequence, such as intrauterine insemination or sexual intercourse. Also, patients that undergo IVF, in general, receive HCG to trigger the ovulation process, but have an oocyte retrieval performed at about 34 to 36 hours after injection, a few hours before the eggs actually would be released from the ovary.

As hCG supports the corpus luteum, administration of hCG is used in certain circumstances to enhance the production of progesterone.

Several vaccines against human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for the prevention of pregnancy are currently in clinical trials.

====Use in males====
In males, hCG injections are used to stimulate the Leydig cells to synthesize testosterone. The intratesticular testosterone is necessary for spermatogenesis from the sertoli cells. Typical medical uses for hCG in males include treating certain types of hypogonadism (either as monotherapy, or, more commonly, in combination with exogenous testosterone), as well as to either treat or prevent infertility, for example, during testosterone replacement therapy hCG is often used to restore or maintain fertility and prevent testicular atrophy.

====HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl warnings====
In the case of female patients who want to be treated with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl:
a) Since infertile female patients who undergo medically assisted reproduction (especially those who need in vitro fertilization), are known to often be suffering from tubal abnormalities, after a treatment with this drug they might experience many more ectopic pregnancies. This is why early ultrasound confirmation at the beginning of a pregnancy (to see whether the pregnancy is intrauterine or not) is crucial. Pregnancies that have occurred after a treatment with this drug have a higher risk of multiple pregnancy. Female patients who have thrombosis, severe obesity, or thrombophilia should not be prescribed this medicine as they have a higher risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events after or during a treatment with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl. b)Female patients who have been treated with this medicine are usually more prone to pregnancy losses.

In the case of male patients: A prolonged treatment with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl is known to regularly lead to increased production of androgen. Therefore: Patients who have overt or latent cardiac failure, hypertension, renal dysfunction, migraines, or epilepsy might not be allowed to start using this medicine or may require a lower dose of HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl. This drug should be used with extreme caution in the treatment of prepubescent teenagers in order to reduce the risk of precocious sexual development or premature epiphyseal closure. This type of patients&#x27; skeletal maturation should be closely and regularly monitored.

Both male and female patients who have the following medical conditions must not start a treatment with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl: (1) Hypersensitivity to this drug or to any of its main ingredients. (2) Known or possible androgen-dependent tumors for example male breast carcinoma or prostatic carcinoma.

===Anabolic steroid adjunct===
HCG is included in some sports&#x27; banned substances lists.

When exogenous AAS (Anabolic Androgenic Steroids) are put into the male body, natural negative-feedback loops cause the body to shut down its own production of testosterone via shutdown of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA). This causes testicular atrophy, among other things. HCG is commonly used during and after steroid cycles to maintain and restore testicular size as well as normal testosterone production.

High levels of AASs, that mimic the body&#x27;s natural testosterone, trigger the hypothalamus to shut down its production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Without GnRH, the pituitary gland stops releasing luteinizing hormone (LH). LH normally travels from the pituitary via the blood stream to the testes, where it triggers the production and release of testosterone. Without LH, the testes shut down their production of testosterone. In males, HCG helps restore and maintain testosterone production in the testes by mimicking LH and triggering the production and release of testosterone.

Professional athletes who have tested positive for HCG have been temporarily banned from their sport, including a 50-game ban from MLB for Manny Ramirez in 2009 and a 4-game ban from the NFL for Brian Cushing for a positive urine test for HCG. Mixed Martial Arts fighter Dennis Siver was fined $19,800 and suspended 9 months for being tested positive after his bout at UFC 168.

=== HCG diet ===
British endocrinologist Albert T. W. Simeons proposed HCG as an adjunct to an ultra-low-calorie weight-loss diet (fewer than 500 calories). Simeons, while studying pregnant women in India on a calorie-deficient diet, and obese boys with pituitary issues (Frölich&#x27;s syndrome) treated with low-dose HCG, observed that both lost fat rather than lean (muscle) tissue. He reasoned that HCG must be programming the hypothalamus to do this in the former cases in order to protect the developing fetus by promoting mobilization and consumption of &quot;abnormal&quot;, &quot;excessive&quot; adipose deposits. Simeons in 1954 published a book entitled &quot;Pounds and Inches&quot;, designed to combat obesity. Simeons, practicing at Salvator Mundi International Hospital in Rome, Italy, recommended low-dose daily HCG injections (125 IU) in combination with a customized ultra-low-calorie (500 cal/day, high-protein, low-carbohydrate/fat) diet, which was supposed to result in a loss of adipose tissue without loss of lean tissue.

Other researchers did not find the same results when attempting experiments to confirm Simeons&#x27; conclusions, and in 1976 in response to complaints the FDA required Simeons and others to include the following disclaimer on all advertisements:

There was a resurgence of interest in the &quot;HCG diet&quot; following promotion by Kevin Trudeau, who was banned from making HCG diet weight-loss claims by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in 2008, and eventually jailed over such claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;FTC 2008/10&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1976 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded that HCG is not more effective as a weight-loss aid than dietary restriction alone.

A 1995 meta analysis found that studies supporting HCG for weight loss were of poor methodological quality and concluded that &quot;there is no scientific evidence that HCG is effective in the treatment of obesity; it does not bring about weight-loss or fat-redistribution, nor does it reduce hunger or induce a feeling of well-being&quot;.

On November 15, 2016, the American Medical Association (AMA) passed policy that &quot;The use of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for weight loss is inappropriate.&quot;

According to the American Society of Bariatric Physicians, no new clinical trials have been published since the definitive 1995 meta-analysis.

The scientific consensus is that any weight loss reported by individuals on an &quot;HCG diet&quot; may be attributed entirely to the fact that such diets prescribe calorie intake of between 500 and 1,000 calories per day, substantially below recommended levels for an adult, to the point that this may risk health effects associated with malnutrition.

====Homeopathic HCG for weight control====
Controversy about, and shortages of, injected HCG for weight loss have led to substantial Internet promotion of &quot;homeopathic HCG&quot; for weight control. The ingredients in these products are often obscure, but if prepared from true HCG via homeopathic dilution, they contain either no HCG at all or only trace amounts. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that oral HCG is bioavailable due to the fact that digestive protease enzymes and hepatic metabolism renders peptide-based molecules (such as insulin and human growth hormone) biologically inert. HCG can likely only enter the bloodstream through injection.

The United States Food and Drug Administration has stated that over-the-counter products containing HCG are fraudulent and ineffective for weight loss. They are also not protected as homeopathic drugs and have been deemed illegal substances. HCG is classified as a prescription drug in the United States and it has not been approved for over-the-counter sales by the FDA as a weight loss product or for any other purposes, and therefore neither HCG in its pure form nor any preparations containing HCG may be sold legally in the country except by prescription. In December 2011, FDA and FTC started to take actions to pull unapproved HCG products from the market. In the aftermath, some suppliers started to switch to &quot;hormone-free&quot; versions of their weight loss products, where the hormone is replaced with an unproven mixture of free amino acids or where radionics is used to transfer the &quot;energy&quot; to the final product.

, the United States Food and Drug Administration has prohibited the sale of homeopathic and over-the-counter hCG diet products and declared them fraudelent and banned.

==Tetanus vaccine conspiracy theory==
Catholic Bishops in Kenya are among those who have spread a conspiracy theory asserting that HCG forms part of a covert sterilization program, forcing denials from the Kenyan government.

In order to induce a stronger immune response, some versions of human chorionic gonadotropin-based anti-fertility vaccines were designed as conjugates of the β subunit of HCG covalently linked to tetanus toxoid. It was alleged that a non-conjugated tetanus vaccine used in developing countries was laced with a human chorionic gonadotropin-based anti-fertility drug and was distributed as a means of mass sterilization. This charge has been vigorously denied by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. Others have argued that an hCG-laced vaccine could not possibly be used for sterilization, since the effects of the anti-fertility vaccines are reversible (requiring booster doses to maintain infertility) and a non-conjugated vaccine is likely to be ineffective. Finally, independent testing of the tetanus vaccine by Kenya&#x27;s health authorities revealed no traces of the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone.

<text>Dirk Lochlin Struan (1797–1841) is the fictional main character of James Clavell&#x27;s 1966 novel &quot;Tai-Pan&quot;. The title comes from a Cantonese term that Clavell loosely translates as &quot;supreme leader&quot;, and Struan is the Tai-pan or head of his own trading company in China, Struan &amp; Company. In Clavell&#x27;s literary universe, moreover, Struan is presented as &quot;the&quot; Tai-pan, and his company as the Noble House, the greatest private trading company in nineteenth-century Asia. A Scotsman, &quot;the devil Struan&quot; is portrayed as a tough and resourceful rogue, endowed with vision and determination. A man of extremity, he is capable of tremendous love and terrible hate. He will stop at nothing to protect his home, his family, and the Noble House.

==Fictional biography==
In 1805, at the age of seven, Dirk Struan began his nautical adventures as a powder monkey on a King&#x27;s ship at the Battle of Trafalgar, and becomes bound to the sea for life. Struan was 12 years old (1809) when he found service on the East India Company merchant ship &quot;Vagrant Star&quot; to China. Under the command of Tyler Brock, third mate and future nemesis, Dirk Struan was whipped mercilessly. Dirk Struan vowed to someday destroy Brock.

In 1811 a fateful night in the Malacca Strait, &quot;Vagrant Star&quot; ran aground on a reef and sank. At the age of fourteen, Struan swam ashore and found his way to Singapore. Later, Dirk Struan discovered that Tyler Brock survived as well.

By 1817, Dirk Struan was a Captain-Owner of his own ship on the opium run. Tyler Brock was his chief rival. Also this year, Dirk Struan married Ronalda in Scotland, but immediately traveled to Macau. Within a few years, Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock dominated the opium trade.

In 1821, Culum Struan was born. He was the son of Dirk Struan and Ronalda. Shortly after his birth, Ronalda and Culum were sent to Glasgow. Ronalda would never return to China. Also this year, Gordon Chen was born. He was the illegitimate son of Dirk Struan and his mistress, Chen Kai Sung.

In 1826, the British East India Company decided to make an example of Struan and Brock. The Company withdrew their licenses and the two men were financially wiped out. Brock was left with his ship, Struan with nothing. Brock entered a secret agreement with another opium trader. Dirk Struan pilfered a lorcha from pirates in Macau. He became a clandestine opium smuggler for other China traders. He relentlessly confiscated more pirate ships. Using them to make dangerous illicit opium runs up the China coast, he made even greater profits.

In 1834, free trade reform advocates succeeded in ending the monopoly of the British East India Company under the Charter Act 1833. Finally, British trade opened to private entrepreneurs. With the freedom to legally trade, Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock became merchant princes. Their armed fleets expanded and bitter rivalry honed their enmity even keener.

In 1837, Jin-Qua arranged for May-may, his favorite granddaughter, to become Dirk Struan&#x27;s mistress. She was secretly assigned the task of teaching &quot;the green-eyed devil&quot; Struan &quot;civilized&quot; (Chinese) ways.

By 1838, Dirk Struan was considered the Tai-pan of all tai-pans; Struan &amp; Company was recognized as the Noble House. Business concerns of the Noble House included smuggling opium from India into China, trading spices and sugar from the Philippines, importing Chinese tea and silk into England, handling cargo papers, cargo insurance, renting of dockyard facilities and warehouse space, trade financing, and other numerous lines of business and trade. The company possessed nineteen intercontinental clipper ships. A close rival, Brock &amp; Sons Trading Company, possessed thirteen. Additionally, Struan &amp; Company possessed hundreds of small ships and lorchas for upriver coastal smuggling.

In 1839, Gordon Chen was remarkably intelligent and a very skilled businessman. However, he longed for recognition from his biological father, Dirk Struan. To achieve this objective, he decided to become indispensable to Dirk Struan and the Noble House.

From January to July 1841, events detailed in Clavell&#x27;s novel &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; unfold. The Noble House was on the brink of financial collapse and about to be destroyed by rival Tyler Brock. In desperation and upon prompting by Mary Sinclair, Dirk Struan turned to Jin Qua. In exchange for a series of favours and promises, Dirk Struan received a loan of &quot;40 Lac&quot; (approximately £1,000,000) in silver bullion from Jin Qua.

The first part of the arrangement, Struan agreed to certain trade concessions. The second part of the arrangement, Struan agreed that a member of the Chen family would forever be comprador of the Noble House. The third part of the arrangement, Struan agreed to sell Jin Qua a sizable plot of land in Hong Kong with the deed to be recorded in the name of Gordon Chen.

The fourth part of the arrangement, Struan agreed to the &quot;coin debt&quot;. Four bronze coins were split in half. Four halves were given to Dirk Struan and the other four halves were kept by Jin Qua. Anyone who presented a half coin to the tai-pan of the Noble House must be granted whatever he asked, whether legal or illegal. All future tai-pan of the Noble House must swear to keep this bargain. This served as repayment for the loan of silver.

Tess Brock and Culum Struan fell in love and married. The couple condemned their fathers&#x27; hatred for each other. Tyler Brock disowned his little Tess, a grudging act that has terrible consequences.

Due to the bargain struck between Dirk Struan and Jin Qua, Gordon Chen managed Jin Qua&#x27;s financial interests in Hong Kong, investing in land and money lending. Gordon Chen seized leadership of the Hong Kong triad. Partly due to assistance from his father and partly due to running protection rackets, Gordon Chen quickly became the wealthiest Chinese man in Hong Kong.

Gordon Chen concealed this information from his father. When his status as Dragon Head of the triad was revealed, his position was nearly ruined. Fortunately, facts were dismissed as lies. Although, Dirk Struan was not entirely convinced.

As part of his efforts to protect his father, Gordon Chen arranged the assassination of Gorth Brock and sought a cure for May-may&#x27;s malaria. The first half-coin of Jin Qua was presented to Dirk Struan by the pirate warlord Wu Fang Choi.

On July 21, 1841, Dirk Struan was killed in a typhoon before he can fulfil his oath to destroy Brock. Culum Struan became the second tai-pan of the Noble House. Gordon Chen began placing spies on Struan &amp; Company&#x27;s ships. Gordon Chen raised Duncan and Kate Struan, the children of Dirk Struan and May-may.

The enmity between Struan and Brock is a prominent theme in Clavell&#x27;s Asian Saga. Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock left many children, legitimate and illegitimate, who take up their respective fathers&#x27; mantles and continue the battle. Tess Brock Struan takes control of the Noble House after the death of Culum Struan and brings about the personal bankruptcy and death of her father but the battle between the two companies continues for several more generations. The last descendant of Tyler Brock, Quillan Gornt, dies in a boating accident over 120 years later. After this accident there is no one from the Brock line left to threaten the Noble House.

The romance between Dirk and his Chinese mistress, May-may, developed within the conventions of the genre as a basis for the novel&#x27;s optimistic theme of cross-cultural fusion. Dirk Struan has several children who feature in the story, including Culum Struan, Gordon Chen, Winifred Dunross Struan, Duncan Struan, and Kate Struan.

Clavell&#x27;s hero was inspired by the historical William Jardine, and the Noble House of Struan&#x27;s is modelled on the real-life &quot;Princely House&quot; of Jardine, Matheson &amp; Company of Hong Kong.

==Depictions in film==
Patrick McGoohan was announced to play Dirk Struan in a film version of &quot;Tai Pan&quot; in 1968 but this was never made due to budget issues. In the late 1970s Steve McQueen signed to play the role for a reported $10 million fee in an adaptation written by George MacDonald Fraser (who thought Sean Connery would have made ideal casting); however he later dropped out of the project; Roger Moore became briefly attached, but the movie was never made.

Eventually Australian actor Bryan Brown played Struan in the movie &quot;Tai Pan&quot; (1986), which was a box office flop.

<text>An art name (pseudonym or pen name), also known by its native names hào (in Mandarin Chinese), gō (in Japanese), (in Korean), and tên hiệu (in Vietnamese), is a professional name used by artists, poets and writers in the Sinosphere. The word and the concept originated in China, where it was used as nicknames for the educated, then became popular in other East Asian countries (especially in Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and the former Kingdom of Ryukyu).

In some cases, artists adopted different pseudonyms at different stages of their career, usually to mark significant changes in their life. Extreme practitioners of this tendency were Tang Yin of the Ming dynasty, who had more than ten &quot;hao&quot;, Hokusai of Japan, who in the period 1798 to 1806 alone used no fewer than six, and Kim Jeong-hui of the Joseon Dynasty who had up to 503.

==History==

===China===

In Chinese culture, &quot;Hao&quot; refers to honorific names made by oneself or given by others when one is in middle age. After one&#x27;s gaining the &quot;Hao&quot;, other persons may then call such a person by one&#x27;s &quot;Hao&quot; even without such a person being presented . &quot;Hao&quot; usually is made by a person oneself, but sometimes is given by a high-ranked official or even is bestowed by the monarch.

The use of this name as a nom de plume or artistic name, however, appears to have begun only during the Six Dynasties period, with Tao Yuanming and Ge Hong among the first literati to have given themselves &quot;Hao&quot;.

Art names came into vogue during the Tang dynasty, during which time they could either be coined by the persons themselves, or given to them as a name by others. Most &quot;Hao&quot; can be placed within a few categories: 

* &quot;Hao&quot; derived from the locations or characteristics of the person&#x27;s residence. For instance, Tao Yuanming was Wuliu Xiansheng, &quot;Mister Five-Willows&quot;, while Su Shi was Dongpo Jushi, &quot;Householder of the Eastern Slope&quot;, after his residence while exiled in Huangzhou. These were mostly self-coined. 
* &quot;Hao&quot; derived from certain well known sayings by the person. For example, Ouyang Xiu was known as Liuyi Jushi, &quot;Householder of the Six Ones&quot;, after his self description as &quot;One myriad books, one thousand inscriptions, one qin, one game of chess, one flask of wine and one old man&quot;. 
* &quot;Hao&quot; derived from one&#x27;s famous poetic lines or images. These were most often given by others in admiration. Li Bai, for his free-spirited behaviour, was known as Zhe Xianren, &quot;Banished Immortal&quot;; while the poet He Zhu was known as He Meizi, &quot;He the Plum&quot;, after an acclaimed line about yellow plums. 
* &quot;Hao&quot; derived from one&#x27;s official posts, birthplace, or a place where they served as officials. Du Fu was known as Du Gongbu, &quot;Du of the Ministry of Works&quot;, having briefly been a senior officer in that ministry. Tang Xianzu was called &quot;Tang of Nanhai&quot; for his birthplace. 

By the Song dynasty, the majority of literati called each other by their art names, which in turn often changed; this situation continued up to the 20th century.

===Japan===

In early modern Japan, a woodblock print artist&#x27;s first &quot;gō&quot; was usually given to them by the head of the school (a group of artists and apprentices, with a senior as master of the school) in which they initially studied; this &quot;gō&quot; usually included one of the characters of the master&#x27;s &quot;gō&quot;. For example, one of Hokusai&#x27;s earliest pseudonyms was Shunrō; his master Katsukawa Shunshō having granted him the character &#x27;shun&#x27; from his own name.

One can often trace the relationship among artists with this, especially in later years, when it seems to have been fairly (although not uniformly) systematic (particularly in the Utagawa school) that the first character of the pupil&#x27;s &quot;gō&quot; was the last of the master&#x27;s &quot;gō&quot;.

Thus, an artist named Toyoharu had a student named Toyohiro, who, in turn, had as a pupil the famous landscape artist Hiroshige.

Another figure who studied under Toyoharu was the principal head of the Utagawa school, Toyokuni. Toyokuni had pupils named Kunisada and Kuniyoshi. Kuniyoshi, in turn, had as a student Yoshitoshi, whose pupils included Toshikata.

=== Korea ===
In Korea, these names are called (). According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Korean Culture,&quot; they arrived on the peninsula from China during the Three Kingdoms of Korea period (57 BC – 668 AD). They are now relatively uncommon, although some recent authors use pen names (), which are seen as very similar to a subvariant of called .

People can either create their own or it can be given to them by others. Typically people select their own based on the meaning of the name. When other people give a person a , it typically reflects their shared social context or relationship (parent to child, friend to friend, teacher to student, etc). Names can also be selected to avoid naming taboos.

While most are made of two characters, they can be of any length. For example, the poet Kim Sang-ok had one that is ten characters long (). A person can also have any number of ; Kim exemplified this by having over twenty. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&quot;, he had the most art names of any modern Korean poet. An extreme example is that of the Joseon scholar Kim Jeong-hui who, by the estimate of famous calligrapher Oh Je-bong, had as many as 503. Some people change to reflect changes in their mood or situation.

Some are also exclusively written in the native Korean alphabet Hangul, without corresponding Chinese characters (Hanja). This too could be a symbolic choice. For example, the linguist Lee Byeong-gi chose a pure Hangul name () in part to reflect his sentiments as a Korean independence activist.

When a person writes an explanation for their , the explanation is called a () or (). A number of texts that catalogue and categorize various exist, which are called ().

==== Types of &quot;ho&quot; ====
 can be subdivided into () or ().

 are typical art names (pseudonyms for artists, writers, etc).

 refers to the name of the building where an intellectual lives. In other words, intellectuals could be referred to by their house&#x27;s name (it was once common practice for Korean intellectuals to name their houses). For example, if someone&#x27;s house was named () and that person went to the park one day, one could use their as such: &quot;Ch&#x27;unghyodang went to the park.&quot; This was sometimes convenient to distinguish between people with similar names. While was typically reserved for the owner of the house, it could also be used to refer to other occupants. For example: &quot;the eldest son of Ch&#x27;unghyodang&quot;.

==Reused names==

In some schools, in particular the main Utagawa school, the &quot;gō&quot; of the most senior member was adopted when the master died and the chief pupil assumed his position. Perhaps as a sign of respect, artists might take the &quot;gō&quot; of a previous artist. This makes attribution difficult. The censors&#x27; seal helps determine a particular print&#x27;s date. Style also is significant. For example, Kunisada, once he changed his &quot;gō&quot; to Toyokuni, initiated the practice of signing prints with a signature in the elongated oval &quot;toshidama&quot; (&#x27;New Year&#x27;s Jewel&#x27;) seal of the Utagawa school, an unusual cartouche with the zig-zag in the upper right-hand corner. His successors continued this practice.

In modern scholarship on the subject, a Roman numeral identifies an artist in the sequence of artists using a &quot;gō&quot;. Thus, Kunisada I is also known as Toyokuni III, since he was the third artist to use that &quot;gō&quot;.

<text>Sandra Zaiter (November 21, 1943 – September 25, 2022) was a Dominican-born Puerto Rican actress, children&#x27;s television show host, singer, composer and athlete.

==Early life and career==

Zaiter was born in the Dominican Republic to Maronite Christians of Lebanese ancestry. Early in her life she participated in church groups and established her residence in Puerto Rico.

Zaiter participated in the Puerto Rican production of &quot;Arriba la Gente&quot;. Before she began her television career, Zaiter won the local OTI Festival as a composer. Her television career took off in the late 1970s when she began recording children&#x27;s albums as a singer. She hosted the Puerto Rican version of &quot;Romper Room&quot; on WRIK-TV until the station closed temporarily. She later moved to WKAQ-TV where she starred, produced, wrote and hosted alongside Lou Briel and Dagmar. Together they hosted a children&#x27;s show called &quot;Teatrimundo&quot; and later &quot;Telecómicas&quot; as well. She was the spokesperson for the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) in Puerto Rico and a sponsor of the association&#x27;s telethon. In the 1990s, Puerto Rican actress and producer Ángela Meyer wrote and produced a drama mini-series based on Zaiter&#x27;s life titled &quot;Gaviota de la Esperanza&quot; (&quot;Seagull of Hope&quot;) which was broadcast by Telemundo.

Zaiter hosted a weekly show on WIPR-TV called &quot;Contra Viento y Marea&quot; (&quot;Against Wind and Tide&quot;). The show aimed to provide guidance and assistance to the disabled. Zaiter did many public appearances throughout her life and participated in the yearly presentation of the Sandra Zaiter Award to those who have distinguished themselves helping the disabled. The studio where &quot;Día a Día con Raymond y Dagmar&quot; is broadcast at WKAQ-TV in Puerto Rico is named after Zaiter ever since the premiere of the mid-day show in 2007.

==Paralyzed by accident==
Zaiter was an experienced diver and swimmer until suffering a life-threatening accident in the 1970s after misjudging the depth of the water at night. She hit her head on a rock during a dive at a beach in Cayo Icacos a small, uninhabited island off the coast of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. She was paralyzed by the accident and was wheelchair-bound for the rest of her life.

<text>The Utagawa school () was one of the main schools of ukiyo-e, founded by Utagawa Toyoharu. It was the largest ukiyo-e school of its period. The main styles were bijin-ga (beautiful women) and uki-e (perspective picture). His pupil, Toyokuni I, took over after Toyoharu&#x27;s death and led the group to become the most famous and powerful woodblock print school for the remainder of the 19th century.

Hiroshige, Kunisada, Kuniyoshi and Yoshitoshi were Utagawa students. The school became so successful and well known that today more than half of all surviving ukiyo-e prints are from it.

Founder Toyoharu adopted Western-style deep perspective, an innovation in Japanese art. His immediate followers, Utagawa Toyohiro and Toyokuni adopted bolder, more sensuous styles than Toyoharu and specialized in different genres — Toyohiro in landscapes and Toyokuni in kabuki actor prints. Later artists in the school specialized in other genres, such as warrior prints and mythic parodies.

==Utagawa school and inherited art-names==

It was a Japanese custom for successful apprentices to take the names of their masters. In the main Utagawa school, there was a hierarchy of &quot;gō&quot; (art-names), from the most senior to junior. As each senior person died, the others would move up a step.

The head of the school generally used the &quot;gō&quot; (and signed his prints) as &quot;Toyokuni&quot;. When Kunisada I proclaimed himself head of the school (c. 1842), he started signing as &quot;Toyokuni&quot;, and the next most senior member, Kochoro (a name also previously used by Kunisada I, but not as his chief &quot;gō&quot;), started signing as &quot;Kunisada&quot; (Kunisada II, in this case).

The next most senior member after him, in turn, began signing as &quot;Kunimasa&quot; (Kunimasa IV, in this case), which had been Kochoro&#x27;s &quot;gō&quot; before he became Kunisada II. (The original Kunimasa I had been a student of Toyokuni I.)

Following is a list of some members of the main Utagawa school, giving the succession of names, along with the modern numbering of each:

* Toyokuni (I)
* Toyoshige -&gt; Toyokuni (II)
* Kunisada (I) -&gt; Toyokuni (III)
* Kochoro -&gt; Kunimasa (III) -&gt; Kunisada (II) -&gt; Toyokuni (IV)
* Kochoro (II) -&gt; Kunimasa (IV) -&gt; Kunisada (III) -&gt; Toyokuni (V)

See here for a more extensive list.

==Two different Toyokuni IIs==

An additional complexity is the fact that there are two different artists who are sometimes referred to as &quot;Toyokuni II&quot;; and similarly for the later-numbered artists called &quot;Toyokuni&quot;.

The first Toyokuni II was Toyoshige, a mediocre pupil and son-in-law of Toyokuni I who became head of the Utagawa school after Toyokuni I died.

Kunisada I (Toyokuni III) apparently despised Toyoshige, and refused to acknowledge him as head of the Utagawa school. Apparently, this was because he felt that as the best pupil, he should have been named head after the old master died, and was upset with Toyoshige, who apparently got the position because of his family connection.

When Kunisada I took the art-name Toyokuni (c. 1842), he effectively removed Toyokuni II from house history and for a period actually signed as &quot;Toyokuni II&quot;. However, he is now numbered, Toyokuni III. There are prints which signed &quot;Toyokuni II&quot; which are by the artist now known as Toyokuni III.

This numbering persisted, so when Kochoro became head of the Utagawa school, he signed as &quot;Toyokuni III&quot;, although he would be the fourth Toyokuni. Likewise Kochoro II eventually signed as &quot;Toyokuni IV&quot;, and is now numbered Toyokuni V.

== Family ==
According to the encyclopedia of Ukiyo-e in the late 1980s, the Utagawa school had 151 students, 147 workers from Kuniyoshi, and 173 people from Kuniyoshi. Students who studied at the Utagawa school would gain the chance to receive the Utagawa name if their skill is approved. The master would give out the Utagawa surname, and the use of “Toshinomaru”, which is Utagawa&#x27;s own family crest that is only found within the Utagawa family to the best students. The “Yearball”, rounded design, was the symbol of the Utagawa family. This symbol was easy to recognize, so the people who wore the Utagawa crested kimono did not need the ticket to the Edo theater at that time. The “Tatsunori no Maru” crest of the same shape with an added line, was used only by the master of Muneya and his workers. The next master was decided at a convention of the very large Utagawa Ichimon family. The master was mainly decided by personality and their Ukiyo-e skills. However, the higher the rank, the better chance that they would be chosen. There were gifts such as crests from the shogunate in the house using this family crest. Utagawa Kazumon did not only pay attention to the aesthetic of the picture, but also tried to maintain a close relationship with the masses, calling himself “painter”.

== Shita-e ==
Shita-e drawings are still used in the present time, with rough sketches and more refined brush paintings, on different kinds of paper with and without corrections, depending on the artist. Moreover, since the final drawing will be carved away, the drawings that would remain would be either sketches or copies of the final shita-e. It is still uncertain who produced the final shita-e, however the clues that remain are the series of sketches and corrections in red ink. More research remains to be done in this area, yet one reason for the vast success of the Utagawa School and its ability to support so many artists was the studio setup of printmaking in the nineteenth century. Paradoxically, the focus on a limited number of great printmakers of the day actually increased their standing and sales, and so supported the pupils beneath them.

<doc id="300458" wikidata="Q2739533" url="?curid=300458" title="League of God's House">
<text>The League of God&#x27;s House (German: &quot;Gotteshausbund&quot;, Italian: &quot;Lega Caddea&quot;, ) was formed in what is now Switzerland on 29 January 1367, to resist the rising power of the Bishopric of Chur and the House of Habsburg. The League allied with the Grey League and the League of the Ten Jurisdictions in 1471 to form the Three Leagues. The League of God&#x27;s House, together with the two other Leagues, was an associate of Old Swiss Confederacy throughout the 15th and 16th centuries. After the Napoleonic wars the League of God&#x27;s House became a part of the Swiss canton of Graubünden.

==Before the League==
The region that would become the League of God&#x27;s House has always been heavily influenced by the Diocese of Chur. The Bishop of Chur is first mentioned in 451 when its Bishop St. Asimo attended the Synod of Milan, but probably existed a century earlier. During the 5th and 6th centuries there is evidence of an extensive Romanisation and conversion to Christianity in the region around Chur. In 536 the region was conquered by the Merovingian Kingdom, but due to distance and isolation it quickly fell back into &quot;de facto&quot; independence. During this time the region was known as &quot;Churrätien&quot; or &quot;Churwalchen&quot; and occupied politically virtually the same territory that the Bishopric of Chur spiritually led. 
In 773 the political and spiritual power in the region was consolidated into a single family. However this situation only lasted until 806 when Charlemagne split the political and spiritual power into two. This split and the resulting conflicts let to the collapse of &quot;Churrätien&quot; and the creation of numerous small independent communities, with the power center of Chur in the middle. 
For centuries after the split, the Bishops of Chur wished to expand their power both politically and spiritually.

==Foundation of the League==
In the 14th century the core communities of the Bishopric of Chur lay along the north–south road on the Septimer-Julier route. The bishop ruled the region around Chur and had the right of high judgement in the Fünf Dörfer, Chur, Oberhalbstein, Oberengadin, Bergell, Schams, Rheinwald, Unterengadin and Vinschgau.

After 1363 relationships between the bishop of Chur and his subjects worsened. Austrian dukes from the House of Habsburg had acquired the County of Tyrol which included Münstertal and Unterengadin and were trying to expand into the Bishopric of Chur. The foreign and frequently absent bishop Peter Gelyto von Böhmen, who had driven the bishopric deep into debt, was willing to sell the political leadership of the area in exchange for a yearly salary. As a first step, in 1366 he rented out the Fürstenburg fortress at Burgeis in the Vinschgau. In response to this development representatives from the cathedral church of St. Luzius, the valley communities and the city of Chur met in 1365 in Wildenberg Castle in Zernez. On 29 January 1367 they met again in Chur, with revolution in mind.

The meeting represented the three sources of power in the area: first, the spiritual community, represented by personnel from the bishop&#x27;s cathedral; second, representatives of the large valley communities (six representatives each from Domleschg, Schams, and Bergell; four from Oberhalbstein; three from Oberengadin; and two from Unterengadin); and third, representatives of the citizens of Chur. The group met without the bishop and voted to limit his power sharply and to demand authority over financial matters.

The decision of 1367 was not a formal federation or alliance, but represented a desire to stick together in a crisis. However the decision included a desire to hold future assemblies and to closely monitor the power of the bishop. These future meetings set the stage for closer alliances between the individual communities. In 1409 they established a standing council and appointed a &quot;Vogt&quot; or bailiff over the bishop. In the spring of 1468 Bishop Ortlieb von Brandis angered the League. They assembled an army, attacked several of the Bishop&#x27;s estates, including Riom and Greifenstein, and occupied them. The Bishop was forced to ask the city of Zürich to intervene. Zürich negotiated with the League and convinced them to return the castles to the Bishop. Between 1524 and 1526 the Ilanzer Article removed the last vestiges of the bishop&#x27;s political power.

==Expansion of the League==
Throughout the 15th century the League continued to expand. The &quot;vier Dörfer&quot; (the four villages, the rest of the five or fünf Dörfer) joined the League, along with Avers and the uppermost part of the Albula valley. The Münster valley (Münstertal) and Puschlavs valley joined about 1498. During the mid-15th century the League of God&#x27;s House began to pursue a common foreign policy with the other two Leagues (Grey League and League of the Ten Jurisdictions). In 1499 during the Swabian War the League together with the other two Leagues defeated a Habsburg army at the Battle of Calven and took the Vinschgau from the Bishopric of Chur. Over time the power of the Bishop of Chur weakened, but Chur became the center of the League of God&#x27;s House. After about 1700, the mayor of Chur automatically became the leader of the League of God&#x27;s House.

==Three Leagues==

After about 1471 the three separate Leagues were allied together as the Three Leagues. The &quot;Bundesbrief&quot; of 23 September 1524 created a constitution for the Three Leagues that would remain until the Napoleonic dissolution of the League. However the League was not a unified state in the modern sense. The Three Leagues worked together as a federation of three states and virtually all affairs of the League were settled by referendum. The Three Leagues were also unique in early modern Europe for practicing a form of communalism, in which each League was founded, governed and defended through collective decisions.

The Three Leagues were normally allied with the Old Swiss Confederacy. Initially this was a response to the expansion of the Habsburgs. The Musso war against the Duchy of Milan in 1520 pushed the League closer to the Swiss Confederacy. The League remained in association with the Swiss until the Napoleonic Wars, when it was absorbed into the Swiss Helvetic Republic founded in 1798. After the Napoleonic Act of Mediation in 1803, the Three Leagues became the canton of Graubünden. The League of God&#x27;s House remained a distinct part of the political organization of the canton from 1803 until 1854.

<doc id="300459" wikidata="Q231919" url="?curid=300459" title="Pulcheria">
<text>Aelia Pulcheria (; ; 19 January 398 or 399 – 453) was an Eastern Roman empress who advised her brother, the emperor Theodosius II, during his minority and then became wife to emperor Marcian from November 450 to her death in 453.

She was the second (and oldest surviving) child of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. In 414, the fifteen-year old Pulcheria became the guardian of her younger brother Theodosius II and was also proclaimed Augusta. Through her religious devotion and involvement in the contemporary ecclesiastical scene, Pulcheria had significant, though changing, influence during her brother&#x27;s reign. After Theodosius II died on 26 July 450, Pulcheria married Marcian on 25 November 450, while simultaneously not violating her vow of virginity. She died three years later, in July 453.

Pulcheria influenced the Christian Church and its theological development by being involved in the Council of Ephesus and guiding the Council of Chalcedon, in which the Church ruled on christological issues. The Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church subsequently recognized her as a saint.

==Early life==
Pulcheria was born into the Theodosian dynasty, whose Eastern branch in the later Roman Empire ruled from Constantinople. Her parents were the eastern Roman emperor Arcadius and empress Aelia Eudoxia. Pulcheria&#x27;s older sister, Flaccilla, was born in 397 but probably died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia (born in 400), the future emperor Theodosius II (born in 401), and Marina (born in 401).

Arcadius&#x27; reign experienced a conflict between his wife and the Archbishop of Constantinople John Chrysostom. Sozomen reports that much of the rivalry was based on a silver statue of Eudoxia set up outside the cathedral of Constantinople, Hagia Sophia, which Chrysostom condemned: &quot;The silver statue of the empress … was placed upon a column of porphyry; and the event was celebrated by loud acclamations, dancing, games, and other manifestations of public rejoicing … John declared that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the [C]hurch.&quot; Also according to Sozomen, Chrysostom had condemned the empress for her grandiose style in his sermons, which enraged her and resulted in Chrysostom&#x27;s immediate deposition. Later in life, Pulcheria returned the relics of John Chrysostom and installed them for the church, in gratitude for his pious life.

Eudoxia died in 404, and Arcadius in 408. They left behind four young children, including Theodosius II, then 7 years of age, who had been his father&#x27;s nominal co-emperor since 402 and was now sole emperor. The praetorian prefect Anthemius at first led government affairs. The imperial chamberlain Antiochus educated Theodosius, but upon reaching adulthood the emperor dismissed him from office. 

==Augusta==

On 4 July 414, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity and was proclaimed &quot;Augusta&quot;. From then on until Theodosius&#x27; adulthood, Pulcheria began to act as her brother and his government&#x27;s guardian. 

Pulcheria was highly esteemed at court. In the Byzantine Senate a bust of her was erected, along with those of other &quot;augusti&quot;. Pulcheria was a &quot;deo coronata&quot; and possessed &quot;basileia&quot;. 

===Vow of virginity===

When she took the vow of virginity in 414, her sisters followed her example. This was to deter potential suitors. Sozomen explains that:
She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses ...

It is possible that Pulcheria may have had another motive to remain unmarried, as she would have had to relinquish her power to a potential husband. In addition, the husbands of Pulcheria and her sisters could have wielded overbearing influence on their young brother, or even posed a threat to him.

Increasingly, the imperial palace assumed a monastic tone more so than the previous regime. Sozomen describes the pious ways of Pulcheria and her sisters in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;:

They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor…and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God.
Rituals within the imperial palace included chanting and reciting passages of sacred scripture and fasting twice per week. The sisters relinquished luxurious jewelry and apparel, which most women of the imperial court wore.

===Education of Theodosius===

Pulcheria provided many instructions necessary for Theodosius to be a successful emperor when he would come of age. According to Sozomen, Pulcheria&#x27;s training of Theodosius included good deportment, horsemanship, and how to don clothes. However, as adult, Theodosius was accused by some people of providing lackluster leadership.

Philostorgius says she handled imperial rescripts for her brother during his minority. Sozomen states that not only did Pulcheria train her brother in the duties and customs of imperial office but governed the state until her brother reached adulthood. This claim is taken seriously by some modern historians, but others argue that it was the collective advisory body, rather than Pulcheria, that directed the government.

===Church and Judaism===

Many important events occurred during her time as &quot;augusta&quot; and her brother&#x27;s reign as emperor; however, Pulcheria&#x27;s influence was mostly ecclesiastical. In a letter from Pope Leo I, a contemporary of Pulcheria, he complimented her great piety and despisal of the errors of heretics. 

Pulcheria and Theodosius potentially held anti-Jewish sentiments, which may have contributed to laws against Jewish worship in the capital. Before the reign of Theodosius II, synagogues were treated as private property and protected by the imperial government. Theodosius enacted a law that forbade the construction of synagogues and required the destruction of those in existence. Theodosius also ordered the execution of a group of Jews after strife among Christians emerged in Palestine.

Pulcheria was also famous for her philanthropy. She erected many churches and buildings for the poor in and around Constantinople. Pulcheria&#x27;s building projects in Constantinople were so vast that a whole district was named the &quot;Pulcherianai&quot;. As well as contributing new churches and districts to the city, Pulcheria contributed significantly to the Christian Church by reinstating bishops who were dismissed and returning the remains of others, such as Flavian, as relics of the church.

===War with Persia===

Pulcheria&#x27;s time as Augusta also was marked by war and ongoing conflict with Sassanid Persia. The imperial court called for war against Persia when the Persian king Yazdegerd I executed a Christian bishop who had destroyed a Zoroastrian altar. Theodosius sent troops into battle, described by Socrates as &quot;ready to do anything for the sake of Christianity.&quot; Though the war was inconclusive, a surviving inscription declares that Theodosius was able to conquer through his sisters&#x27; vows of virginity. Theodosius thus made his sister&#x27;s virginity a tool of war propaganda, and because of her vow to be faithful only to God, the hand of God would help Roman troops in battle against Persia.

===Relationship with Aelia Eudocia===
The relationship between Pulcheria and Aelia Eudocia, Theodosius II&#x27;s wife, was strained. The two women over the years had developed a rivalry, possibly based on their different backgrounds and religious beliefs. Eudocia was originally named &quot;Athenais&quot; and was born in Athens to a Greek philosopher and professor of rhetoric. According to a later source, when her father died, he left her with little means, only &quot;one hundred gold coins&quot;. She visited her aunt in Constantinople out of desperation. On 7 June 421, Theodosius married Athenais, and her name was changed to &quot;Eudocia&quot;. Opinions differ as to whether Pulcheria really recommended Eudocia to her brother, a claim made by John Malalas. The rivalry between the two women was posed by some scholars to have been motivated by Eudocia&#x27;s envy of Pulcheria&#x27;s power in court.

Centuries later, Theophanes the Confessor wrote that Eudocia and the chief minister, the eunuch Chrysaphius, convinced Theodosius to rely less on his sister&#x27;s influence and more on that of his new wife. This caused Pulcheria in the late 440s to leave the imperial palace and live in &quot;Hebdomon, a seaport seven miles from Constantinople.&quot; However, Eudocia had already left Constantinople for Jerusalem, and the chronology of her departure does not support Theophanes&#x27; narrative. The rivalry of Eudocia and Pulcheria may have come to a head when Eudocia openly supported monastic Miaphysitism in Jerusalem. Nonetheless, the sources do not speak of any dispute between them in this period.

==Wife of Marcian==
While hunting on horseback in 450, Theodosius II fell from his horse and injured his spine; he died two days later. What exactly happened in government during the interregnum is unclear. It is speculated by some historians that Pulcheria reigned over the empire alone for about one month after the death of Theodosius, which may have primarily consisted of arranging the public funeral of Theodosius. As the deceased emperor lacked surviving male children, Pulcheria could bestow dynastic legitimacy on an outsider by marrying him. She honoured her vow of virginity despite entering a legitimate marriage. She married Marcian, a tribune and close associate of general Aspar, probably at the general&#x27;s suggestion. Marcian&#x27;s origins were of low status in comparison to those of previous emperors: &quot;Marcian was a man of little substance, with no ancient aristocratic or imperial blood. He was Roman, however, and thus the bond of &quot;kedeia&quot; at once communicated eligibility for &quot;basileia&quot;.&quot; One condition of the marriage was that Marcian obey and respect Pulcheria&#x27;s vow of virginity, which he did. In order for the marriage to not seem scandalous to the Roman state, the church proclaimed that &quot;Christ himself sponsored the union and it therefore should not provoke shock or unjustified suspicions.&quot; After their marriage, Pulcheria and Marcian had Chrysaphius killed.

==Ecclesiastical Policy==

===First Council of Ephesus===

The First Council of Ephesus, held in 431 in Theodosius&#x27;s reign, involved two rival bishops: Nestorius, who was Archbishop of Constantinople, and Cyril, the Patriarch of Alexandria. The dispute grew from their disagreement over the nature of Christ.

Nestorius advocated diminishing the influence of the doctrine of the &quot;Theotokos&quot;, i.e. &quot;Mother of God&quot;, in the church. This conflicted with the religious beliefs of Pulcheria, as she was a virgin empress, and a rivalry between them ensued, during which Nestorius launched a smear campaign against her. Nestorius also tried to remove Pulcheria&#x27;s image and her altar cloth from the altar, against her wishes. However, Pulcheria and her allies, including Eusebius of Dorylaeum, struck back by launching a campaign against Nestorius. Meanwhile, Cyril had already publicly condemned Nestorius and wrote to the imperial court stating that the doctrine of the &quot;Theotokos&quot; was correct. Theodosius and his advisors decided to hold a council, thereby allowing Nestorius an opportunity to vindicate himself.

However, the Council, teeming with Cyril&#x27;s allies, condemned Nestorius&#x27; position. Nestorians, who were unable to take part in the previous council, held their own council to denounce Cyril. The emperor first tried to find a middle ground but eventually favored Cyril. The title of &quot;Theotokos&quot; was decreed as orthodox. He also deposed Nestorius and banished him to a monastery in Antioch. Thus, Pulcheria&#x27;s campaign against Nestorius was successful, but ecclesiastical controversies did not stop there.

===Second Council of Ephesus===

In 449, Christological debates flared up again. Theodosius summoned another council to Ephesus to resolve the disputes. At this council, Pope Leo I was the primary advocate for Pulcheria&#x27;s claims of the doctrine, and he &quot;…forcefully intervened, sending a Tome, a long letter, to Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople, in which he argued for the two natures, but questioned the legality of the recent condemnation of a certain Eutyches for denying them. At this the party of Dioscorus, Cyril&#x27;s successor in Alexandria was able to overturn the situation, whereupon Leo asked for a second council, calling that [council in] Ephesus the &quot;Robber Council&quot;.&quot;

During this council, Flavian was beaten and died from his injuries. He was later declared a saint and martyr.

===Council of Chalcedon===

Two years later, Pulcheria and Marcian summoned the Council of Chalcedon, attended by 452 bishops. It condemned the doctrines of both Nestorius and Eutyches, developed the doctrines of Cyril and Pope Leo I into one, and it declared the doctrine of the &quot;Theotokos&quot; orthodox. It also reversed the decision of the second Council of Ephesus and denounced it as &#x27;Robber Council&#x27;. According to historian Averil Cameron, the Council of Chalcedon &quot;…developed and clarified the creed of Nicaea, according to which God was Father, Son and Holy Spirit, by further proclaiming that Christ was at all times after the Incarnation fully God and fully human.&quot; Pulcheria and Marcian were both hailed as the &quot;new Constantine&quot; and &quot;new Helena&quot; at the council. From this council grew an irreconcilable gulf between Chalcedonians, those who upheld the council&#x27;s decision, and Miaphysites, who opposed it.

Pulcheria devoted the last years of her life to the &quot;Theotokos&quot;, and had three churches in Constantinople dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary: the Monastery of the Panagia Hodegetria, the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae, and the Chalkoprateia.

==Death and veneration==
Pulcheria died in 453, but the specific day is unknown. She probably died in Constantinople. Her death shocked the people of Constantinople, since she had formed a bond with the city&#x27;s inhabitants.

Even in her last days Pulcheria thought of ways to help the poor of Constantinople, for &quot;in her will she reinforced that bond by instructing that all of her remaining wealth be distributed among the poor…&quot;

After her death, she was declared a saint by the church, which is today the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches.

==In art==

Pulcheria brought many holy relics to churches in Constantinople. The Trier Adventus Ivory, now housed in the treasury of Trier Cathedral, Germany, has been interpreted as depicting the installation of one of these relics. Historian Kenneth Holum describes the Ivory thus: &quot;On the Ivory Theodosius wears distinctive costume and inclines slightly forward, but essentially he remains only part of the cortege and thus of the ceremonial context. The direction of the wagon&#x27;s movement inexorably toward the scene at the right, toward the diminutive woman clothed in the rich costume of an Augusta … in it she deposited the holy relics.&quot;

However, this interpretation is disputed, and another opinion is that the ivory shows the later Empress Irene of the eighth century, who sponsored renovation of the church.&lt;br&gt;

<doc id="300460" wikidata="Q3493813" url="?curid=300460" title="Tidal volume">
<text>Tidal volume (symbol VT or TV) is the volume of air inspired and expired with each passive breath. It is typically assumed that the volume of air inhaled is equal to the volume of air exhaled such as in the figure on the right. In a healthy, young human adult, tidal volume is approximately 500 ml per inspiration at rest or 7 ml/kg of body mass.

==Mechanical ventilation==
Tidal volume plays a significant role during mechanical ventilation to ensure adequate ventilation without causing trauma to the lungs. Tidal volume is measured in milliliters and ventilation volumes are estimated based on a patient&#x27;s ideal body mass. Measurement of tidal volume can be affected (usually overestimated) by leaks in the breathing circuit or the introduction of additional gas, for example during the introduction of nebulized drugs.

Ventilator-induced lung injury such as Acute lung injury (ALI) /Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) can be caused by ventilation with very large tidal volumes in normal lungs, as well as ventilation with moderate or small volumes in previously injured lungs, and research shows that the incidence of ALI increases with higher tidal volume settings in nonneurologically impaired patients. 
. Similarly A 2018 systematic review by The Cochrane Collaboration provided evidence that low tidal volume ventilation reduced post operative pneumonia and reduced the requirement for both invasive and non invasive ventilation after surgery

Initial settings of mechanical ventilation:

===Patients without pre-existing lung disease===
Protective lung ventilation strategies should be applied with VT 6ml/kg to 8ml/kg with RR = 12 to 20 and an average starting target minute ventilation of 7 L/min.

===Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease===
Protective lung volumes apply 6ml/kg to 8ml/kg with a rate high enough for proper alveolar ventilation but does not create or aggravate intrinsic Positive End-Expiry Pressure (PEEP).

===Acute respiratory distress syndrome===
Protective lung ventilation strategies apply. VT 6 to 8 ml/kg or as low as 5 ml/kg in severe cases. Permissive hypercapnia can be employed in an attempt to minimize aggressive ventilation leading to lung injury. Higher PEEPs are often required however not all ARDS patients require the same PEEP levels. Patient should be started on 6 ml/kg and PEEP increased until plateau pressure is 30 cm H20 in most severe cases.

<text>Alan Jay Perlis (April 1, 1922 – February 7, 1990) was an American computer scientist and professor at Purdue University, Carnegie Mellon University and Yale University. He is best known for his pioneering work in programming languages and was the first recipient of the Turing Award.

==Biography==
Perlis was born to a Jewish family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1939. In 1943, he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (later renamed Carnegie Mellon University).

During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army, where he became interested in mathematics. He then earned both a master&#x27;s degree (1949) and a Ph.D. (1950) in mathematics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His doctoral dissertation was titled &quot;On Integral Equations, Their Solution by Iteration and Analytic Continuation&quot;.

In 1952, he participated in Project Whirlwind. He joined the faculty at Purdue University and in 1956, moved to the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He was chair of mathematics and then the first head of the computer science department. In 1962, he was elected president of the Association for Computing Machinery.

He was awarded the inaugural Turing Award in 1966, according to the citation, &quot;for his influence in the area of advanced programming techniques and compiler construction.&quot; This is a reference to the work he had done on &quot;Internal Translator&quot; in 1956 (described by Donald Knuth as the first successful compiler), and as a member of the team that developed the programming language ALGOL.

In 1971, Perlis moved to Yale University to take the chair of computer science and hold the Eugene Higgins chair. In 1977, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.

In 1982, he wrote an article, &quot;Epigrams on Programming&quot;, for the Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s (ACM) SIGPLAN journal, describing in one-sentence distillations many of the things he had learned about programming over his career. The epigrams have been widely quoted.
He remained at Yale until his death in 1990.
