<text>Kwai Chung is an urban area within Tsuen Wan New Town in the New Territories of Hong Kong. Together with Tsing Yi Island, it is part of the Kwai Tsing District of Hong Kong. It is also part of Tsuen Wan New Town.

In 2000, it had a population of 287,000. Its area is 9.93 km2. Areas within Kwai Chung include: Kwai Fong, Kwai Hing, Lai King, Tai Wo Hau. Kwai Chung is the site of part of the container port of Hong Kong.

==Origin of the name==
In earlier times Kwai Chung was called Kwai Chung Tsai (). Kwai Chung was a stream (Chung) that emptied into Gin Drinkers Bay (). The whole bay was reclaimed for land and the stream is no longer visible.

==Divisions==
Traditionally, Kwai Chung is divided into Sheung Kwai Chung (), and Ha Kwai Chung (). Administratively, the former is called North Kwai Chung, and the latter South Kwai Chung.

Sheung Kwai Chung, Chung Kwai Chung Village () and Ha Kwai Chung Village () are recognized villages under the New Territories Small House Policy.

==Economy==
Kwai Chung is the home of the principal commercial cargo handling area of Hong Kong, the Kwai Chung Container Terminal, one of the largest and busiest port facilities in the world. The main commercial port was relocated here from Yau Ma Tei in the 1980s, in preparation for the West Kowloon Reclamation, which has left the original waterfront of Yau Ma Tei almost half a mile inland.

The area has the head office of Kerry Logistics.

==Education==
*Lutheran School for the Deaf is in Kwai Chung.
*S.T.F.A. Lee Shau Kee College

Sheung Kwai Chung and Chung Kwai Chung (Upper and Central Kwai Chung) are in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 64, which includes multiple aided schools (schools operated independently of the government but funded with government money); none of the schools in the net are government schools.

Ha Kwai Chung (Lower Kwai Chung) is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 65, which includes multiple aided schools; none of the schools in the net are government schools.

<doc id="302183" wikidata="Q3500262" url="?curid=302183" title="Aunus expedition">
<text>The Aunus expedition (; ) was an attempt by Finnish volunteers to occupy parts of East Karelia in 1919, during the Russian Civil War. &quot;Aunus&quot; is the Finnish name for Olonets Karelia. This expedition was one of many Finnic &quot;kinship wars&quot; (&quot;heimosodat&quot;) fought against forces of Soviet Russia after the Russian Revolution of 1917 and during the Russian Civil War.

==Background==
In February 1918 General Mannerheim, the commander of the anti-communist White Guards, wrote his famous &quot;sword scabbard order of the day,&quot; in which he said that he would not put his sword into the scabbard until East Karelia was free of Russian control. After the Finnish Civil War there was much public discussion about joining East Karelia to Finland, although the primarily Finnic Russian East Karelia never was a part of the Swedish Empire or the Grand Duchy of Finland.

Earlier attempts in 1918 to Petsamo and White Karelia (Viena expedition) had failed, partly due to a passive attitude of the Karelians. Later the British occupied White Karelia.

During the summer of 1918, the government of Finland received various appeals from East Karelia for joining the area to Finland. Especially active were the inhabitants of the parish of Repola, which had held a vote to join Finland. The Finnish Army occupied the parish in the fall of 1918. In January 1919 a small expedition of volunteers occupied the parish of Porajärvi, but was quickly repulsed by Bolshevik forces. Porajärvi held a vote on January 7 to also join Finland.

In February 1919 Mannerheim made clear to the Western powers and the White Army that Finland would attack the Bolsheviks in Saint Petersburg if it would receive material and moral support. During the same time the plans for the Aunus expedition were prepared and Jaeger-Major Gunnar von Hertzen was chosen as the commander of the troops. He thought that the expedition would succeed with a thousand Finnish volunteers, but only if the Karelians would join the fighting. Mannerheim approved the plan, but demanded that Britain would also have to approve of it before it could proceed.

On May 15, 1918, as the Olonets Government of Southern Karelia would be founded following Finland&#x27;s decleration of war on Sovet Russia.

==Expedition==

The expedition crossed the border on the night of April 21, 1919. The goals were to capture Lodeynoye Pole, Petrozavodsk and the Murmansk railroad. The troops were divided into three groups and were made up of 1000 volunteers. The southern group advanced to Lodeynoye Pole in just three days, but was pressed back behind River Tuulos by Bolshevik troops. The northern group captured Prääsä. At this time it became obvious that there were not enough troops to complete the goals of the expedition. A new round of recruiting 2000 new volunteers was started and Mannerheim made Aarne Sihvo the new commander of the expedition.

Following the capture of Olonets on April 23, 1919, the Olonets Government of Southern Karelia was renamed to the Provisional Caretaker Government of Olonets.

Major Paavo Talvela&#x27;s regiment started an attack aimed at Petrozavodsk on June 20, but was beaten by Red Army and Finnish Red Guard forces just outside the town. The British troops that operated along the Murmansk railroad were quite close by, but did not participate.

The Finns had hoped that the Karelian population would have joined the troops as volunteers but only a few did and their morale was never very high.

The initiative now passed to the Bolsheviks. On June 26 over 600 Finns of the Red Officer School in Saint Petersburg made a landing at Vitele across Lake Ladoga behind the Finnish lines. The southern group was forced to retreat to Finland after suffering heavy losses. Talvela&#x27;s group was also forced to retreat back to Finland.

==Aftermath==
The only result from the expedition was that the parish of Porajärvi declared on June 6 that it wished to join Finland, as the parish of Repola had already done in 1918. The regular Finnish Army moved in to occupy the parish. In the treaty of Tartu in 1920 Finland and Soviet Union agreed on their common border. Repola and Porajärvi were left on the Soviet side and the Finnish troops had to be withdrawn before February 14, 1921. The young police chief in Repola, Bobi Sivén, shot himself in protest.

<text>Banyeres de Mariola (), known simply as Banyeres ( ), is a settlement and a municipality in the north of the province of Alicante (Spain), 860 metres above sea level, with a population of 7,500. The main employer is the local textile industry. The town has a Moorish castle that dates from 1214, and is surrounded by mountains, almond and olive trees.

From the 22 to the 25 April each year the town celebrates the &quot;Moros i Cristians&quot; (Moors and Christians) festival, commemorating the 13th century defeat by the Christians of the occupying Moorish rulers. It is a festival of pageantry, costume, and pyrotechnics.

== Climate ==
According to the Köppen climate classification, Banyeres has a &quot;Csa&quot; hot-summer mediterranean climate, highly influenced by the altitude and the distance from the sea, having also continental factors. The winters are cool, and the summers are hot during the day and mild during the night.

<doc id="302185" wikidata="Q184735" url="?curid=302185" title="Bernard Bolzano">
<text>Bernard Bolzano (, ; ; ; born Bernardus Placidus Johann Nepomuk Bolzano; 5 October 1781 – 18 December 1848) was a Bohemian mathematician, logician, philosopher, theologian and Catholic priest of Italian extraction, also known for his liberal views.

Bolzano wrote in German, his native language. For the most part, his work came to prominence posthumously.

==Family==
Bolzano was the son of two pious Catholics. His father, Bernard Pompeius Bolzano, was an Italian who had moved to Prague, where he married Maria Cecilia Maurer who came from Prague&#x27;s German-speaking family Maurer. Only two of their twelve children lived to adulthood.

==Career==
When he was ten years old, Bolzano entered the Gymnasium of the Piarists in Prague, which he attended from 1791 to 1796.

Bolzano entered the University of Prague in 1796 and studied mathematics, philosophy and physics. Starting in 1800, he also began studying theology, becoming a Catholic priest in 1804. He was appointed to the new chair of philosophy of religion at Prague University in 1805. He proved to be a popular lecturer not only in religion but also in philosophy, and he was elected Dean of the Philosophical Faculty in 1818.

Bolzano alienated many faculty and church leaders with his teachings of the social waste of militarism and the needlessness of war. He urged a total reform of the educational, social and economic systems that would direct the nation&#x27;s interests toward peace rather than toward armed conflict between nations. His political convictions, which he was inclined to share with others with some frequency, eventually proved to be too liberal for the Austrian authorities. On December 24, 1819, he was removed from his professorship (upon his refusal to recant his beliefs) and was exiled to the countryside and then devoted his energies to his writings on social, religious, philosophical, and mathematical matters.

Although forbidden to publish in mainstream journals as a condition of his exile, Bolzano continued to develop his ideas and publish them either on his own or in obscure Eastern European journals. In 1842 he moved back to Prague, where he died in 1848.

==Mathematical work==
Bolzano made several original contributions to mathematics. His overall philosophical stance was that, contrary to much of the prevailing mathematics of the era, it was better not to introduce intuitive ideas such as time and motion into mathematics. To this end, he was one of the earliest mathematicians to begin instilling rigor into mathematical analysis with his three chief mathematical works &quot;Beyträge zu einer begründeteren Darstellung der Mathematik&quot; (1810), &quot;Der binomische Lehrsatz&quot; (1816) and &quot;Rein analytischer Beweis&quot; (1817). These works presented &quot;...a sample of a new way of developing analysis&quot;, whose ultimate goal would not be realized until some fifty years later when they came to the attention of Karl Weierstrass.

To the foundations of mathematical analysis he contributed the introduction of a fully rigorous ε–δ definition of a mathematical limit. Bolzano was the first to recognize the greatest lower bound property of the real numbers. Like several others of his day, he was skeptical of the possibility of Gottfried Leibniz&#x27;s infinitesimals, that had been the earliest putative foundation for differential calculus. Bolzano&#x27;s notion of a limit was similar to the modern one: that a limit, rather than being a relation among infinitesimals, must instead be cast in terms of how the dependent variable approaches a definite quantity as the independent variable approaches some other definite quantity.

Bolzano also gave the first purely analytic proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, which had originally been proven by Gauss from geometrical considerations. He also gave the first purely analytic proof of the intermediate value theorem (also known as Bolzano&#x27;s theorem). Today he is mostly remembered for the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, which Karl Weierstrass developed independently and published years after Bolzano&#x27;s first proof and which was initially called the Weierstrass theorem until Bolzano&#x27;s earlier work was rediscovered.

==Philosophical work==
Bolzano&#x27;s posthumously published work &quot;Paradoxien des Unendlichen (The Paradoxes of the Infinite)&quot; (1851) was greatly admired by many of the eminent logicians who came after him, including Charles Sanders Peirce, Georg Cantor, and Richard Dedekind. Bolzano&#x27;s main claim to fame, however, is his 1837 &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot; (&quot;Theory of Science&quot;), a work in four volumes that covered not only philosophy of science in the modern sense but also logic, epistemology and scientific pedagogy. The logical theory that Bolzano developed in this work has come to be acknowledged as ground-breaking. Other works are a four-volume &quot;Lehrbuch der Religionswissenschaft&quot; (&quot;Textbook of the Science of Religion&quot;) and the metaphysical work &quot;Athanasia&quot;, a defense of the immortality of the soul. Bolzano also did valuable work in mathematics, which remained virtually unknown until Otto Stolz rediscovered many of his lost journal articles and republished them in 1881.

===&quot;Wissenschaftslehre (Theory of Science)&quot;===
In his 1837 &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot; Bolzano attempted to provide logical foundations for all sciences, building on abstractions like part-relation, abstract objects, attributes, sentence-shapes, ideas and propositions in themselves, sums and sets, collections, substances, adherences, subjective ideas, judgments, and sentence-occurrences. These attempts were an extension of his earlier thoughts in the philosophy of mathematics, for example his 1810 &quot;Beiträge&quot; where he emphasized the distinction between the objective relationship between logical consequences and our subjective recognition of these connections. For Bolzano, it was not enough that we merely have &quot;confirmation&quot; of natural or mathematical truths, but rather it was the proper role of the sciences (both pure and applied) to seek out &quot;justification&quot; in terms of the fundamental truths that may or may not appear to be obvious to our intuitions.

====Introduction to &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot;====
Bolzano begins his work by explaining what he means by &quot;theory of science&quot;, and the relation between our knowledge, truths and sciences. Human knowledge, he states, is made of all truths (or true propositions) that men know or have known. However, this is a very small fraction of all the truths that exist, although still too much for one human being to comprehend. Therefore, our knowledge is divided into more accessible parts. Such a collection of truths is what Bolzano calls a science (&quot;Wissenschaft&quot;). It is important to note that not all true propositions of a science have to be known to men; hence, this is how we can make discoveries in a science.

To better understand and comprehend the truths of a science, men have created textbooks (&quot;Lehrbuch&quot;), which of course contain only the true propositions of the science known to men. But how to know where to divide our knowledge, that is, which truths belong together? Bolzano explains that we will ultimately know this through some reflection, but that the resulting rules of how to divide our knowledge into sciences will be a science in itself. This science, that tells us which truths belong together and should be explained in a textbook, is the &quot;Theory of Science&quot; (&quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot;).

====Metaphysics====
In the &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot;, Bolzano is mainly concerned with three realms:

(1) The realm of language, consisting in words and sentences. 
(2) The realm of thought, consisting in subjective ideas and judgements. 
(3) The realm of logic, consisting in objective ideas (or ideas in themselves) and propositions in themselves.

Bolzano devotes a great part of the &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot; to an explanation of these realms and their relations.

Two distinctions play a prominent role in his system. First, the distinction between parts and wholes. For instance, words are parts of sentences, subjective ideas are parts of judgments, objective ideas are parts of propositions in themselves. Second, all objects divide into those that exist, which means that they are causally connected and located in time and/or space, and those that do not exist. Bolzano&#x27;s original claim is that the logical realm is populated by objects of the latter kind.

====&quot;Satz an Sich&quot; (proposition in itself)====
&quot;Satz an Sich&quot; is a basic notion in Bolzano&#x27;s &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot;. It is introduced at the very beginning, in section 19. Bolzano first introduces the notions of proposition (spoken or written or thought or in itself) and idea (spoken or written or thought or in itself). &quot;The grass is green&quot; is a proposition (&quot;Satz&quot;): in this connection of words, something is said or asserted. &quot;Grass&quot;, however, is only an idea (&quot;Vorstellung&quot;). Something is represented by it, but it does not assert anything. Bolzano&#x27;s notion of proposition is fairly broad: &quot;A rectangle is round&quot; is a proposition — even though it is false by virtue of self-contradiction — because it is composed in an intelligible manner out of intelligible parts.

Bolzano does not give a complete definition of a &quot;Satz an Sich&quot; (i.e. proposition in itself) but he gives us just enough information to understand what he means by it. A proposition in itself (i) has no existence (that is: it has no position in time or place), (ii) is either true or false, independent of anyone knowing or thinking that it is true or false, and (iii) is what is &#x27;grasped&#x27; by thinking beings. So a written sentence (&#x27;Socrates has wisdom&#x27;) grasps a proposition in itself, namely the proposition [Socrates has wisdom]. The written sentence does have existence (it has a certain location at a certain time, say it is on your computer screen at this very moment) and expresses the proposition in itself which is in the realm of in itself (i.e. &quot;an sich&quot;). (Bolzano&#x27;s use of the term &quot;an sich&quot; differs greatly from that of Kant; for Kant&#x27;s use of the term see &quot;an sich&quot;.)

Every proposition in itself is composed out of ideas in themselves (for simplicity, we will use &quot;proposition&quot; to mean &quot;proposition in itself&quot; and &quot;idea&quot; to refer to an objective idea or idea in itself). Ideas are negatively defined as those parts of a proposition that are themselves not propositions. A proposition consists of at least three ideas, namely: a subject idea, a predicate idea and the copula (i.e. &#x27;has&#x27;, or another form of &quot;to have&quot;). (Though there are propositions which contain propositions, we won&#x27;t take them into consideration right now.)

Bolzano identifies certain types of ideas. There are simple ideas that have no parts (as an example Bolzano uses [something]), but there are also complex ideas that consist of other ideas (Bolzano uses the example of [nothing], which consists of the ideas [not] and [something]). Complex ideas can have the same content (i.e. the same parts) without being the same — because their components are differently connected. The idea [A black pen with blue ink] is different from the idea [A blue pen with black ink] though the parts of both ideas are the same.

====Ideas and objects====
It is important to understand that an idea does not need to have an object. Bolzano uses &quot;object&quot; to denote something that is represented by an idea. An idea that has an object, represents that object. But an idea that does not have an object represents nothing. (Don&#x27;t get confused here by terminology: an objectless idea is an idea without a representation.)

Consider, for further explanation, an example used by Bolzano. The idea [a round square], does not have an object, because the object that ought to be represented is self-contrary. A different example is the idea [nothing] which certainly does not have an object. However, the proposition [the idea of a round square has complexity] has as its subject-idea [the idea of a round square]. This subject-idea does have an object, namely the idea [a round square]. But, that idea does not have an object.

Besides objectless ideas, there are ideas that have only one object, e.g. the idea [the first man on the moon] represents only one object. Bolzano calls these ideas &#x27;singular ideas&#x27;. Obviously there are also ideas that have many objects (e.g. [the citizens of Amsterdam]) and even infinitely many objects (e.g. [a prime number]).

====Sensation and simple ideas====
Bolzano has a complex theory of how we are able to sense things. He explains sensation by means of the term intuition, in German called &quot;Anschauung&quot;. An intuition is a simple idea, it has only one object (&quot;Einzelvorstellung&quot;), but besides that, it is also unique (Bolzano needs this to explain sensation). Intuitions (&quot;Anschauungen&quot;) are objective ideas, they belong to the &quot;an sich&quot; realm, which means that they don&#x27;t have existence. As said, Bolzano&#x27;s argumentation for intuitions is by an explanation of sensation.

What happens when you sense a real existing object, for instance a rose, is this: the different aspects of the rose, like its scent and its color, cause in you a change. That change means that before and after sensing the rose, your mind is in a different state. So sensation is in fact a change in your mental state. How is this related to objects and ideas? Bolzano explains that this change, in your mind, is essentially a simple idea (&quot;Vorstellung&quot;), like, &#x27;this smell&#x27; (of this particular rose). This idea represents; it has as its object the change. Besides being simple, this change must also be unique. This is because literally you can&#x27;t have the same experience twice, nor can two people, who smell the same rose at the same time, have exactly the same experience of that smell (although they will be quite alike). So each single sensation causes a single (new) unique and simple idea with a particular change as its object. Now, this idea in your mind is a subjective idea, meaning that it is in you at a particular time. It has existence. But this subjective idea must correspond to, or has as a content, an objective idea. This is where Bolzano brings in intuitions (&quot;Anschauungen&quot;); they are the simple, unique and objective ideas that correspond to our subjective ideas of changes caused by sensation. So for each single possible sensation, there is a corresponding objective idea. Schematically the whole process is like this: whenever you smell a rose, its scent causes a change in you. This change is the object of your subjective idea of that particular smell. That subjective idea corresponds to the intuition or &quot;Anschauung&quot;.

====Logic====
According to Bolzano, all propositions are composed out of three (simple or complex) elements: a subject, a predicate and a copula. Instead of the more traditional copulative term &#x27;is&#x27;, Bolzano prefers &#x27;has&#x27;. The reason for this is that &#x27;has&#x27;, unlike &#x27;is&#x27;, can connect a concrete term, such as &#x27;Socrates&#x27;, to an abstract term such as &#x27;baldness&#x27;. &quot;Socrates has baldness&quot; is, according to Bolzano, preferable to &quot;Socrates is bald&quot; because the latter form is less basic: &#x27;bald&#x27; is itself composed of the elements &#x27;something&#x27;, &#x27;that&#x27;, &#x27;has&#x27; and &#x27;baldness&#x27;. Bolzano also reduces existential propositions to this form: &quot;Socrates exists&quot; would simply become &quot;Socrates has existence (&quot;Dasein&quot;)&quot;.

A major role in Bolzano&#x27;s logical theory is played by the notion of &quot;variations&quot;: various logical relations are defined in terms of the changes in truth value that propositions incur when their non-logical parts are replaced by others. Logically analytical propositions, for instance, are those in which all the non-logical parts can be replaced without change of truth value. Two propositions are &#x27;compatible&#x27; (&quot;verträglich&quot;) with respect to one of their component parts x if there is at least one term that can be inserted that would make both true. A proposition Q is &#x27;deducible&#x27; (&quot;ableitbar&quot;) from a proposition P, with respect to certain of their non-logical parts, if any replacement of those parts that makes P true also makes Q true. If a proposition is deducible from another with respect to all its non-logical parts, it is said to be &#x27;logically deducible&#x27;.
Besides the relation of deducibility, Bolzano also has a stricter relation of &#x27;grounding&#x27; (&quot;Abfolge&quot;). This is an asymmetric relation that obtains between true propositions, when one of the propositions is not only deducible from, but also explained by the other.

====Truth====
Bolzano distinguishes five meanings the words &quot;true&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; have in common usage, all of which Bolzano takes to be unproblematic. The meanings are listed in order of properness:

I. Abstract objective meaning: &quot;Truth&quot; signifies an attribute that may apply to a proposition, primarily to a proposition in itself, namely the attribute on the basis of which the proposition expresses something that in reality is as is expressed. Antonyms: &quot;falsity, falseness, falsehood&quot;.

II. Concrete objective meaning: (a) &quot;Truth&quot; signifies a proposition that has the attribute &quot;truth&quot; in the abstract objective meaning. Antonym: (a) &quot;falsehood&quot;.

III. Subjective meaning: (a) &quot;Truth&quot; signifies a correct judgment. Antonym: (a) &quot;mistake&quot;.

IV. Collective meaning: &quot;Truth&quot; signifies a body or multiplicity true propositions or judgments (e.g. the biblical truth).

V. Improper meaning: &quot;True&quot; signifies that some object is in reality what some denomination states it to be. (e.g. the true God). Antonyms: &quot;false, unreal, illusory&quot;.

Bolzano&#x27;s primary concern is with the concrete objective meaning: with concrete objective truths or truths in themselves. All truths in themselves are a kind of propositions in themselves. They do not exist, i.e. they are not spatiotemporally located as thought and spoken propositions are. However, certain propositions have the attribute of being a truth in itself. Being a thought proposition is not a part of the concept of a truth in itself, notwithstanding the fact that, given God&#x27;s omniscience, all truths in themselves are also thought truths. The concepts &#x27;truth in itself&#x27; and &#x27;thought truth&#x27; are interchangeable, as they apply to the same objects, but they are not identical.

Bolzano offers as the correct definition of (abstract objective) truth: a proposition is true if it expresses something that applies to its object. The correct definition of a (concrete objective) truth must thus be: a truth is a proposition that expresses something that applies to its object. This definition applies to truths in themselves, rather than to thought or known truths, as none of the concepts figuring in this definition are subordinate to a concept of something mental or known.

Bolzano proves in §§31–32 of his &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot; three things:

There is at least one truth in itself (concrete objective meaning):
:1. There are no true propositions (assumption)
:2. 1. is a proposition (obvious)
:3. 1. is true (assumed) and false (because of 1.)
:4. 1. is self-contradictory (because of 3.)
:5. 1. is false (because of 4.)
:6. There is at least one true proposition (because of 1. and 5.)
B. There is more than one truth in itself:
:7. There is only one truth in itself, namely A is B (assumption)
:8. A is B is a truth in itself (because of 7.)
:9. There are no other truths in themselves apart from A is B (because of 7.)
:10. 9. is a true proposition/ a truth in itself (because of 7.)
:11. There are two truths in themselves (because of 8. and 10.)
:12. There is more than one truth in itself (because of 11.)
C. There are infinitely many truths in themselves:
:13. There are only n truths in themselves, namely A is B ... Y is Z (assumption)
:14. A is B ... Y is Z are n truths in themselves (because of 13.)
:15. There are no other truths apart from A is B ... Y is Z (because of 13.)
:16. 15. is a true proposition/ a truth in itself (because of 13.)
:17. There are n+1 truths in themselves (because of 14. and 16.)
:18. Steps 1 to 5 can be repeated for n+1, which results in n+2 truths and so on endlessly (because n is a variable)
:19. There are infinitely many truths in themselves (because of 18.)

====Judgments and cognitions====
A known truth has as its parts (&quot;Bestandteile&quot;) a truth in itself and a judgment (Bolzano, &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot; §26). A judgment is a thought which states a true proposition. In judging (at least when the matter of the judgment is a true proposition), the idea of an object is being connected in a certain way with the idea of a characteristic (§ 23). In true judgments, the relation between the idea of the object and the idea of the characteristic is an actual/existent relation (§28).

Every judgment has as its matter a proposition, which is either true or false. Every judgment exists, but not &quot;für sich&quot;. Judgments, namely, in contrast with propositions in themselves, are dependent on subjective mental activity. Not every mental activity, though, has to be a judgment; recall that all judgments have as matter propositions, and hence all judgments need to be either true or false. Mere presentations or thoughts are examples of mental activities which do not necessarily need to be stated (behaupten), and so are not judgments (§ 34).

Judgments that have as its matter true propositions can be called cognitions (§36). Cognitions are also dependent on the subject, and so, opposed to truths in themselves, cognitions do permit degrees; a proposition can be more or less known, but it cannot be more or less true. Every cognition implies necessarily a judgment, but not every judgment is necessarily cognition, because there are also judgments that are not true. Bolzano maintains that there are no such things as false cognitions, only false judgments (§34).

==Philosophical legacy==
Bolzano came to be surrounded by a circle of friends and pupils who spread his thoughts about (the so-called Bolzano Circle), but the effect of his thought on philosophy initially seemed destined to be slight.

Alois Höfler (1853–1922), a former student of Franz Brentano and Alexius Meinong, who subsequently become professor of pedagogy at the University of Vienna, created the &quot;missing link between the Vienna Circle and the Bolzano tradition in Austria.&quot; Bolzano&#x27;s work was rediscovered, however, by Edmund Husserl and Kazimierz Twardowski, both students of Brentano. Through them, Bolzano became a formative influence on both phenomenology and analytic philosophy.

<doc id="302187" wikidata="Q2368856" url="?curid=302187" title="Curry (programming language)">
<text>Curry is a declarative programming language, an implementation of the functional logic programming paradigm, and based on the Haskell language. It merges elements of functional and logic programming, including constraint programming integration.

It is nearly a superset of Haskell but does not support all language extensions of Haskell. In contrast to Haskell, Curry has built-in support for non-deterministic computations involving search.

==Foundations of functional logic programming==

===Basic concepts===
A functional program is a set of functions defined by equations or rules. A functional computation consists of replacing subexpressions by equal (with regard to the function definitions) subexpressions until no more replacements (or reductions) are possible and a value or normal form is obtained. For instance, consider the function double defined by

 double x = x+x

The expression “” is replaced by . The latter can be replaced by if we interpret the operator “” to be defined by an infinite set of equations, e.g., , , etc. In a similar way, one can evaluate nested expressions (where the subexpressions to be replaced are quoted):

 &#x27;double (1+2)&#x27; → &#x27;(1+2)&#x27;+(1+2) → 3+&#x27;(1+2)&#x27; → &#x27;3+3&#x27; → 6

There is also another order of evaluation if we replace the arguments of operators from right to left:

 &#x27;double (1+2)&#x27; → (1+2)+&#x27;(1+2)&#x27; → &#x27;(1+2)&#x27;+3 → &#x27;3+3&#x27; → 6

In this case, both derivations lead to the same result, a property known as confluence. This follows from a fundamental property of pure functional languages, termed referential transparency: the value of a computed result does not depend on the order or time of evaluation, due to the absence of side effects. This simplifies reasoning about, and maintaining, pure functional programs.

As many functional languages like Haskell do, Curry supports the definition of algebraic data types by enumerating their constructors. For instance, the type of Boolean values consists of the constructors and that are declared as follows:

 data Bool = True | False

Functions on Booleans can be defined by pattern matching, i.e., by providing several equations for different argument values:

 not True = False
 not False = True

The principle of replacing equals by equals is still valid provided that the actual arguments have the required form, e.g.: 
 not &#x27;(not False)&#x27; → &#x27;not True&#x27; → False

More complex data structures can be obtained by recursive data types. For instance, a list of elements, where the type of elements is arbitrary (denoted by 
the type variable ), is either the empty list “” or the non-empty list “” consisting of a first element and a list : 

 data List a = [] | a : List a 

The type “” is usually written as and finite lists x1x2...xn are written as x1x2...xn. We can define operations on recursive types by inductive definitions where pattern matching supports the convenient separation of the different cases. For instance, the concatenation operation “” on polymorphic lists can be defined as follows (the optional type declaration in the first line specifies that “” takes two lists as input and produces an output list, where all list elements are of the same unspecified type):

 (++) :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] 
 [] ++ ys = ys 
 (x:xs) ++ ys = x : xs++ys 

Beyond its application for various programming tasks, the operation “” is also useful to specify the behavior of other functions on lists. For instance, the behavior of a function last that yields the last element of a list can be specified as follows: for all lists xs and elements e, xs = e if ∃ysyse = xs. 
Based on this specification, one can define a function that satisfies this specification by employing logic programming features. Similarly to logic languages, functional logic languages provide search for solutions for existentially quantified variables. In contrast to pure logic languages, they support equation solving over nested functional expressions so that an equation like yse = is solved by instantiating ys to the list and e to the value . In Curry one can define the operation last as follows:

 last xs | ys++[e] =:= xs = e where ys,e free

Here, the symbol “” is used for equational constraints in order to provide a syntactic distinction from defining equations. Similarly, extra variables (i.e., variables not occurring in the left-hand side of the defining equation) are explicitly declared by “” in order to provide some opportunities to detect bugs caused by typos. A conditional equation of the form l c r is applicable for reduction if its condition c has been solved. In contrast to purely functional languages where conditions are only evaluated to a Boolean value, functional logic languages support the solving of conditions by guessing values for the unknowns in the condition. Narrowing as discussed in the next section is used to solve this kind of conditions.

===Narrowing===
Narrowing is a mechanism whereby a variable is bound to a value selected from among alternatives imposed by constraints. Each possible value is tried in some order, with the remainder of the program invoked in each case to determine the validity of the binding. Narrowing is an extension of logic programming, in that it performs a similar search, but can actually generate values as part of the search rather than just being limited to testing them.

Narrowing is useful because it allows a function to be treated as a relation: its value can be computed &quot;in both directions&quot;. The Curry examples of the previous section illustrate this.

As noted in the prior section, narrowing can be thought of as reduction on a program term graph, and there are often many different ways (&quot;strategies&quot;) to reduce a given term graph. Antoy et al. proved in the 1990s that a particular narrowing strategy, &quot;needed narrowing&quot;, is optimal in the sense of doing a number of reductions to get to a &quot;normal form&quot; corresponding to a solution that is minimal among sound and complete strategies. Needed narrowing corresponds to a lazy strategy, in contrast to the SLD-resolution strategy of Prolog.

===Functional patterns===
The rule defining shown above expresses the fact that the actual argument must match the result of narrowing the expression . Curry can express this property also in the following more concise way:

 last (ys++[e]) = e

Haskell does not allow such a declaration since the pattern in the left-hand side contains a defined function (). Such a pattern is also called &quot;functional pattern&quot;. Functional patterns are enabled by the combined functional and logic features of Curry and support concise definitions of tasks requiring deep pattern matching in hierarchical data structures.

===Non-determinism===
Since Curry is able to solve equations containing function calls with unknown values, its execution mechanism is based on non-deterministic computations, similarly to logic programming. This mechanism supports also the definition of &quot;non-deterministic operations&quot;, i.e., operations that delivers more than one result for a given input. The archetype of non-deterministic operations is the predefined infix operation , called &quot;choice&quot; operator, that returns one of its arguments. This operator is defined by the following rules:

 x ? y = x
 x ? y = y

Thus, the evaluation of the expression returns as well as . Computing with non-deterministic operations and computing with free variables by narrowing has the same expressive power.

The rules defining show an important feature of Curry: all rules are tried in order to evaluate some operation. Hence, one can define by

 insert x ys = x : ys
 insert x (y:ys) = y : insert x ys

an operation to insert an element into a list at an indeterminate position so that the operation defined by

 perm [] = []
 perm (x:xs) = insert x (perm xs)

returns any permutation of a given input list.

===Strategies===
Due to the absence of side effects, a functional logic program can be executed with different strategies. To evaluate expressions, Curry uses a variant of the &quot;needed narrowing&quot; strategy which combines lazy evaluation with non-deterministic search strategies. In contrast to Prolog, which uses backtracking to search for solutions, Curry does not fix a particular search strategy. Hence, there are implementations of Curry, like KiCS2, where the user can easily select a search strategy, like depth-first search (backtracking), breadth-first search, iterative deepening, or parallel search.

<text>In mathematics, the adjoint representation (or adjoint action) of a Lie group &quot;G&quot; is a way of representing the elements of the group as linear transformations of the group&#x27;s Lie algebra, considered as a vector space. For example, if &quot;G&quot; is formula_1, the Lie group of real &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; invertible matrices, then the adjoint representation is the group homomorphism that sends an invertible &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix formula_2 to an endomorphism of the vector space of all linear transformations of formula_3 defined by: formula_4.

For any Lie group, this natural representation is obtained by linearizing (i.e. taking the differential of) the action of &quot;G&quot; on itself by conjugation. The adjoint representation can be defined for linear algebraic groups over arbitrary fields.

==Definition==

Let &quot;G&quot; be a Lie group, and let
:formula_5
be the mapping , 
with Aut(&quot;G&quot;) the automorphism group of &quot;G&quot; and given by the inner automorphism (conjugation)
:formula_6
This Ψ is a Lie group homomorphism.

For each &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, define to be the derivative of at the origin:
:formula_7
where is the differential and formula_8 is the tangent space at the origin ( being the identity element of the group ). Since formula_9 is a Lie group automorphism, Ad&quot;g&quot; is a Lie algebra automorphism; i.e., an invertible linear transformation of formula_10 to itself that preserves the Lie bracket. Moreover, since formula_11 is a group homomorphism, formula_12 too is a group homomorphism. Hence, the map
:formula_13
is a group representation called the adjoint representation of &quot;G&quot;.

If &quot;G&quot; is an immersed Lie subgroup of the general linear group formula_14 (called immersely linear Lie group), then the Lie algebra formula_15 consists of matrices and the exponential map is the matrix exponential formula_16 for matrices &quot;X&quot; with small operator norms. We will compute the derivative of formula_9 at formula_18. For &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; and small &quot;X&quot; in formula_15, the curve formula_20 has derivative formula_21 at &quot;t&quot; = 0, one then gets:
:formula_22
where on the right we have the products of matrices. If formula_23 is a closed subgroup (that is, &quot;G&quot; is a matrix Lie group), then this formula is valid for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; and all &quot;X&quot; in formula_10.

Succinctly, an adjoint representation is an isotropy representation associated to the conjugation action of &quot;G&quot; around the identity element of &quot;G&quot;.

===Derivative of Ad===
One may always pass from a representation of a Lie group &quot;G&quot; to a representation of its Lie algebra by taking the derivative at the identity.

Taking the derivative of the adjoint map
:formula_25
at the identity element gives the adjoint representation of the Lie algebra formula_26 of &quot;G&quot;:
:formula_27
where formula_28 is the Lie algebra of formula_29 which may be identified with the derivation algebra of formula_10. One can show that
:formula_31
for all formula_32, where the right hand side is given (induced) by the Lie bracket of vector fields. Indeed, recall that, viewing formula_15 as the Lie algebra of left-invariant vector fields on &quot;G&quot;, the bracket on formula_10 is given as: for left-invariant vector fields &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;,
:formula_35
where formula_36 denotes the flow generated by &quot;X&quot;. As it turns out, formula_37, roughly because both sides satisfy the same ODE defining the flow. That is, formula_38 where formula_39 denotes the right multiplication by formula_40. On the other hand, since formula_41, by the chain rule,
:formula_42
as &quot;Y&quot; is left-invariant. Hence,
:formula_43,
which is what was needed to show.

Thus, formula_44 coincides with the same one defined in below. Ad and ad are related through the exponential map: Specifically, Adexp(&quot;x&quot;) = exp(ad&quot;x&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot; in the Lie algebra. It is a consequence of the general result relating Lie group and Lie algebra homomorphisms via the exponential map.

If &quot;G&quot; is an immersely linear Lie group, then the above computation simplifies: indeed, as noted early, formula_45 and thus with formula_46,
:formula_47.
Taking the derivative of this at formula_48, we have:
:formula_49.
The general case can also be deduced from the linear case: indeed, let formula_50 be an immersely linear Lie group having the same Lie algebra as that of &quot;G&quot;. Then the derivative of Ad at the identity element for &quot;G&quot; and that for &quot;G″&quot; coincide; hence, without loss of generality, &quot;G&quot; can be assumed to be &quot;G″&quot;.

The upper-case/lower-case notation is used extensively in the literature. Thus, for example, a vector in the algebra formula_15 generates a vector field in the group . Similarly, the adjoint map of vectors in formula_15 is homomorphic to the Lie derivative of vector fields on the group considered as a manifold.

Further see the derivative of the exponential map.

== Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra ==
Let formula_15 be a Lie algebra over some field. Given an element of a Lie algebra formula_15, one defines the adjoint action of on formula_15 as the map 
:formula_56
for all in formula_15. It is called the adjoint endomorphism or adjoint action. (formula_58 is also often denoted as formula_59.) Since a bracket is bilinear, this determines the linear mapping
:formula_60
given by . Within Endformula_61, the bracket is, by definition, given by the commutator of the two operators:
:formula_62
where formula_63 denotes composition of linear maps. Using the above definition of the bracket, the Jacobi identity
:formula_64 
takes the form 
:formula_65
where , , and are arbitrary elements of formula_15.

This last identity says that ad is a Lie algebra homomorphism; i.e., a linear mapping that takes brackets to brackets. Hence, ad is a representation of a Lie algebra and is called the adjoint representation of the algebra formula_15.

If formula_15 is finite-dimensional and a basis for it is chosen, then formula_69 is the Lie algebra of square matrices and the composition corresponds to matrix multiplication.

In a more module-theoretic language, the construction says that formula_15 is a module over itself.

The kernel of ad is the center of formula_15 (that&#x27;s just rephrasing the definition). On the other hand, for each element in formula_15, the linear mapping formula_73 obeys the Leibniz&#x27; law:
:formula_74
for all and in the algebra (the restatement of the Jacobi identity). That is to say, ad&quot;z&quot; is a derivation and the image of formula_15 under ad is a subalgebra of Derformula_61, the space of all derivations of formula_15.

When formula_78 is the Lie algebra of a Lie group &quot;G&quot;, ad is the differential of Ad at the identity element of &quot;G&quot;.

There is the following formula similar to the Leibniz formula: for scalars formula_79 and Lie algebra elements formula_80,
:formula_81

== Structure constants ==

The explicit matrix elements of the adjoint representation are given by the structure constants of the algebra. That is, let {ei} be a set of basis vectors for the algebra, with 
:formula_82
Then the matrix elements for 
adei
are given by
:formula_83

Thus, for example, the adjoint representation of su(2) is the defining representation of so(3).

== Examples ==
*If &quot;G&quot; is abelian of dimension &quot;n&quot;, the adjoint representation of &quot;G&quot; is the trivial &quot;n&quot;-dimensional representation.
*If &quot;G&quot; is a matrix Lie group (i.e. a closed subgroup of formula_84), then its Lie algebra is an algebra of &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrices with the commutator for a Lie bracket (i.e. a subalgebra of formula_85). In this case, the adjoint map is given by Ad&quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;gxg&quot;−1.
*If &quot;G&quot; is SL(2, R) (real 2×2 matrices with determinant 1), the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot; consists of real 2×2 matrices with trace 0. The representation is equivalent to that given by the action of &quot;G&quot; by linear substitution on the space of binary (i.e., 2 variable) quadratic forms.

==Properties==

The following table summarizes the properties of the various maps mentioned in the definition

The image of &quot;G&quot; under the adjoint representation is denoted by Ad(&quot;G&quot;). If &quot;G&quot; is connected, the kernel of the adjoint representation coincides with the kernel of Ψ which is just the center of &quot;G&quot;. Therefore, the adjoint representation of a connected Lie group &quot;G&quot; is faithful if and only if &quot;G&quot; is centerless. More generally, if &quot;G&quot; is not connected, then the kernel of the adjoint map is the centralizer of the identity component &quot;G&quot;0 of &quot;G&quot;. By the first isomorphism theorem we have
:formula_86

Given a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra formula_15, by Lie&#x27;s third theorem, there is a connected Lie group formula_88 whose Lie algebra is the image of the adjoint representation of formula_15 (i.e., formula_90.) It is called the adjoint group of formula_15.

Now, if formula_15 is the Lie algebra of a connected Lie group &quot;G&quot;, then formula_88 is the image of the adjoint representation of &quot;G&quot;: formula_94.

== Roots of a semisimple Lie group ==
If &quot;G&quot; is semisimple, the non-zero weights of the adjoint representation form a root system. (In general, one needs to pass to the complexification of the Lie algebra before proceeding.) To see how this works, consider the case &quot;G&quot; = SL(&quot;n&quot;, R). We can take the group of diagonal matrices diag(&quot;t&quot;1, ..., &quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot;) as our maximal torus &quot;T&quot;. Conjugation by an element of &quot;T&quot; sends

:formula_95

Thus, &quot;T&quot; acts trivially on the diagonal part of the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot; and with eigenvectors &quot;t&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;t&quot;&quot;j&quot;−1 on the various off-diagonal entries. The roots of &quot;G&quot; are the weights diag(&quot;t&quot;1, ..., &quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot;) → &quot;t&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;t&quot;&quot;j&quot;−1. This accounts for the standard description of the root system of &quot;G&quot; = SL&quot;n&quot;(R) as the set of vectors of the form &quot;ei&quot;−&quot;ej&quot;.

=== Example SL(2, R) ===
When computing the root system for one of the simplest cases of Lie Groups, the group SL(2, R) of two dimensional matrices with determinant 1 consists of the set of matrices of the form:

: formula_96

with &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; real and &quot;ad&quot; − &quot;bc&quot; = 1.

A maximal compact connected abelian Lie subgroup, or maximal torus &quot;T&quot;, is given by the subset of all matrices of the form

: formula_97

with formula_98. The Lie algebra of the maximal torus is the Cartan subalgebra consisting of the matrices

: formula_99

If we conjugate an element of SL(2, &quot;R&quot;) by an element of the maximal torus we obtain

: formula_100

The matrices

: formula_101

are then &#x27;eigenvectors&#x27; of the conjugation operation with eigenvalues formula_102. The function Λ which gives formula_103 is a multiplicative character, or homomorphism from the group&#x27;s torus to the underlying field R. The function λ giving θ is a weight of the Lie Algebra with weight space given by the span of the matrices.

It is satisfying to show the multiplicativity of the character and the linearity of the weight. It can further be proved that the differential of Λ can be used to create a weight. It is also educational to consider the case of SL(3, R).

== Variants and analogues ==
The adjoint representation can also be defined for algebraic groups over any field.

The co-adjoint representation is the contragredient representation of the adjoint representation. Alexandre Kirillov observed that the orbit of any vector in a co-adjoint representation is a symplectic manifold. According to the philosophy in representation theory known as the orbit method (see also the Kirillov character formula), the irreducible representations of a Lie group &quot;G&quot; should be indexed in some way by its co-adjoint orbits. This relationship is closest in the case of nilpotent Lie groups.

<text>An electric piano is a musical instrument that has a piano-style musical keyboard, where sound is produced by means of mechanical hammers striking metal strings or reeds or wire tines, which leads to vibrations which are then converted into electrical signals by pickups (either magnetic, electrostatic, or piezoelectric). The pickups are connected to an instrument amplifier and loudspeaker to reinforce the sound sufficiently for the performer and audience to hear. Unlike a synthesizer, the electric piano is not an electronic instrument. Instead, it is an electro-mechanical instrument. Some early electric pianos used lengths of wire to produce the tone, like a traditional piano. Smaller electric pianos used short slivers of steel to produce the tone (a lamellophone with a keyboard &amp; pickups). The earliest electric pianos were invented in the late 1920s; the 1929 &quot;Neo-Bechstein&quot; electric grand piano was among the first. Probably the earliest stringless model was Lloyd Loar&#x27;s Vivi-Tone Clavier. A few other noteworthy producers of electric pianos include Baldwin Piano and Organ Company, and the Wurlitzer Company.

Early electric piano recordings include Duke Ellington&#x27;s in 1955 and Sun Ra&#x27;s &quot;India&quot; as well as other tracks from the 1956 sessions included on his second album &quot;Super Sonic Jazz&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Super Sonic Sounds&quot;). The popularity of the electric piano began to grow in the late 1950s after Ray Charles&#x27;s 1959 hit record &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;, reaching its height during the 1970s, after which they were progressively displaced by more lightweight electronic pianos capable of piano-like sounds without the disadvantages of electric pianos&#x27; heavy weight and moving mechanical parts. Another factor driving their development and acceptance was the progressive electrification of popular music and the need for a portable keyboard instrument capable of high-volume amplification. Musicians adopted a number of types of domestic electric pianos for rock and pop use. This encouraged their manufacturers to modify them for stage use and then develop models primarily intended for stage use.

Digital pianos that provide an emulated electric piano sound have largely supplanted the actual electro-mechanical instruments in the 2010s, due to the small size, light weight, and versatility of digital instruments, which can produce a huge range of tones besides piano tones (e.g., emulations of Hammond organ sounds, synthesizer sounds, etc.). However, some performers still perform and record with vintage electric pianos. In 2009, Rhodes produced a new line of electro-mechanical pianos, known as the Rhodes Mark 7, followed by an offering from Vintage Vibe.

==History==

The Neo-Bechstein electric piano was built in 1931. The Vierlang-Forster electric piano was introduced in 1937. The RCA Storytone electric piano was built in 1939 in a joint venture between Story &amp; Clark and RCA. The case was designed by John Vassos, the American industrial designer. It debuted at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. The piano has normal strings and hammer action but no soundboard. The sound is amplified through electromagnetic pickups, circuitry and a speaker system, making it the world&#x27;s first commercially available electric piano.

Many types were initially designed as a less-expensive alternative to an acoustic piano for home or school use. Some electric pianos were designed with multiple keyboards that could be connected for use in school or college piano labs, so that teachers could simultaneously instruct a group of students using headphones.
==Types==
The term &quot;electric piano&quot; can refer to several different instruments which vary in their sound-producing mechanisms and consequent timbral characters.

===Struck strings===
Yamaha, Baldwin, Helpinstill and Kawai&#x27;s electric pianos are actual grand or upright pianos with strings and hammers. The Helpinstill models have a traditional soundboard; the others have none, and are more akin to a solid-body electric guitar.

On Yamaha&#x27;s pianos, such as the CP-70, the vibration of the strings is converted to an electrical signal by piezoelectric pickups under the bridge. Helpinstill&#x27;s instruments use a set of electromagnetic pickups attached to the instrument&#x27;s frame. All these instruments have a tonal character similar to that of an acoustic piano.

===Struck reeds===
Wurlitzer electronic pianos (sometimes called &quot;Wurli&quot; as a nickname) use flat steel reeds struck by felt hammers. The reeds fit within a comb-like metal plate, and the reeds and plate together form an electrostatic or capacitive pickup system. This system produces a very distinctive tone – sweet and vibraphone-like when played gently, and developing a hollow resonance as the keys are played harder. The reeds are tuned by adding or removing mass from a lump of solder at the free end of the reed. Replacement reeds are furnished with a slight excess of solder, and thus tuned &quot;flat&quot;; the user is required – by repeated trial and error – to gradually file off the excess solder until the correct tuning is achieved. The Columbia Elepian (also branded as Maestro), the Brazilian-made Valente, and the Hohner Electra-Piano use a reed system similar to the Wurlitzer but with electromagnetic pickups similar to the Rhodes piano.

In 2015, Brazilian inventor Tiago Valente created the first prototype of the Valente Electric Piano, an electromechanical instrument where the hammers strike reeds, similar to the ones used in a Wurlitzer. In 2020, the Valente Electric Piano was launched commercially; at the time of launch, Valente said that he took inspiration from the Suette Piano, another reed electric piano that was made in Brazil in the 1980s.

===Struck tuning-forks===
The tuning fork here refers to the struck element having two vibrating parts. In Fender Rhodes instruments, the struck portion of the &quot;fork&quot; is a tine of stiff steel wire. The other part of the fork, parallel and adjacent to the tine, is the tonebar, a sturdy steel bar which acts as a resonator and adds sustain to the sound. The tine is fitted with a spring which can be moved along its length to allow the pitch to be varied for fine-tuning. The tine is struck by the small neoprene (originally felt) tip of a hammer activated by a greatly simplified piano action (each key has only three moving parts including the damper). Each tine has an electromagnetic pickup placed just beyond its tip (see also tonewheel). The Rhodes piano has a distinctive bell-like tone, fuller than the Wurlitzer, with longer sustain and with a &quot;growl&quot; when played hard.

===Plucked reeds===
The Hohner Pianet uses adhesive pads made from an undressed leather surface cushioned by a foam rubber backing. The leather is saturated with a viscous silicone oil to adhere to and pluck metal reeds. When the key is released, the pad acts as a damper. An electrostatic pickup system similar to Wurlitzer&#x27;s is used. The tone produced resembles that of the Wurlitzer but brighter and with less sustain, largely owing to the design having no sustain pedal mechanism. The same firm&#x27;s &quot;Cembalet&quot; uses rubber plectra and separate urethane foam dampers but is otherwise almost identical.

Hohner&#x27;s later &quot;Pianet T&quot; uses silicone rubber suction pads rather than adhesive pads and replaces the electrostatic system with passive electromagnetic pickups similar to those of the Rhodes. The Pianet T has a far mellower sound not unlike that of the Rhodes instruments. None of the above instruments have the facility for a sustain pedal.

A close copy of the Cembalet is the &quot;Weltmeister Claviset&quot;, also marketed as the &quot;Selmer Pianotron&quot;. This has electromagnetic pickups with a battery-powered preamplifier, and later models have multiple tone filters and a sustain pedal.

===Other electric keyboard instruments===
Although not technically pianos, the following are electric harpsichords and clavichords.

Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;Solid-Body Electric Harpsichord&quot; or &quot;Combo Harpsichord&quot; is an aluminum-framed instrument of fairly traditional form, with no soundboard and with two sets of electromagnetic pickups, one near the plectra and the other at the strings&#x27; midpoint. The instrument&#x27;s sound has something of the character of an electric guitar, and has occasionally been used to stand in for one in modern chamber music. Roger Penney of Bermuda Triangle Band worked on the design and development of the original instrument for the Cannon Guild Company, a premier harpsichord maker located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This instrument had an aluminium bar frame, a spruce wood soundboard, bar magnetic pickups, and a Plexiglas (clear plastic) openable lid. The prototypes and design were sold to Baldwin who made some modifications, and then manufactured the instrument under their own name.

Hohner&#x27;s &quot;Clavinet&quot; is essentially an electric clavichord. A rubber pad under each key presses the string onto a metal anvil, causing the &quot;fretted&quot; portion of the string to vibrate. This is detected by a series of pickups, which convert them into an electrical signal.

<text>Baron Audley is a title in the Peerage of England first created in 1313, by writ to the Parliament of England, for Sir Nicholas Audley of Heighley Castle, a member of the Anglo-Norman Audley family of Staffordshire.

The third Baron, the last of the senior Audley line, died without issue in 1391, when the barony fell into abeyance; it was revived in 1408 for the descendants of his sister Joanne Audley, and her husband, Sir John Tuchet, (b. 1327); the 11th Baron Audley was created Earl of Castlehaven and his son, the 2nd Earl, was attainted of felony and executed, forfeiting the ancient English barony but not the Irish earldom. (The Castlehavens also held two other different baronies Audley of Orier (1616) and Audley of Hely (1633).) The titles were revived by Act of Parliament in 1678 for his son, James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven, devolving in the same line until the death of John Tuchet, 8th Earl of Castlehaven in 1777, when the earldom became extinct, and the Audley title passed to George Thicknesse-Tuchet as the 19th Baron Audley. The title has been abeyant since the death of Richard Souter, 25th Baron Audley in 1997, leaving three daughters.

The title of Baron Audley was created a second time on 20 November 1317, again by writ of summons, in favour of Sir Hugh Audley of Stratton Audley, grandson of James Audley of Audley (1220–1272). He married Lady Margaret de Clare, daughter of the Gilbert, Earl of Hertford and Gloucester (of 1218 creation, extinct 1314)). Audley was created Earl of Gloucester in 1337, but upon his death in 1347, the earldom became extinct and the barony fell dormant. His only daughter and heir married Ralph Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford, thus &quot;de jure&quot; the barony devolved with the earldom of Stafford until 1521 when Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham was attainted of his noble titles.

<doc id="302192" wikidata="Q1629859" url="?curid=302192" title="Drax Power Station">
<text>Drax power station is a large biomass power station in Drax, North Yorkshire, England. It has a 2.6 GW capacity for biomass and had a 1.29 GW capacity for coal that was retired in 2021. Its name comes from the nearby village of Drax. It is situated on the River Ouse between Selby and Goole. Its generating capacity of 3,906 megawatts (MW), which includes the shut down coal units, is the highest of any power station in the United Kingdom, providing about 6% of the United Kingdom&#x27;s electricity supply.

Opened in 1974 and extended in the 1980s, the station was initially operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board. Since privatisation in 1990 ownership has changed several times, and it is operated by the Drax Group. Completed in 1986, it was the newest coal-fired power station in England until it closed in 2021. Flue gas desulphurisation equipment was fitted between 1988 and 1995. The high and low pressure turbines were replaced between 2007 and 2012.

By 2010, the station was co-firing biomass. In 2012, the company announced plans to convert three generating units to solely biomass, burning 7.5 million tonnes imported from the United States and Canada. This work was completed in 2016 and a fourth unit was converted in 2018. The company planned to convert its remaining two coal units to Combined Cycle Gas Turbine units and 200 MW battery storage. However, those two coal units were shut in 2021 without converting them to biomass.

In 2025, the UK government extended its operation to 2031, but at a reduced load factor so it would run less than half as often from 2027 using 100% sustainable biomass.

==History==
Drax was initially conceived by the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) in 1962 as the country&#x27;s largest power station thus far, at about 3,000 MW. Subsequently, it was decided to use this opportunity as their first station to use the 660 MW turbogenerator sets which were planned to become the new standard, so the planning consents were revised to about 4,000 MW.

Following the Selby Coalfield discovery in 1967 the Board would build three large power stations to use its coal. These were an expansion of the station at Ferrybridge, a new station at Eggborough, and Drax, which would be the largest.

===Construction===
Authority to carry out preparatory works was granted in December 1964, leading to full permission in March 1966, on the basis that the station would be designed to accommodate six 660 MW units, but that only the first three be proceeded with for the time being.

Ground work for these three units, known at the time as &#x27;Drax First Half&#x27;, started in 1967. Two units were synchronised to the grid in 1973, and the third in 1974.

Although authorised, the second half of the project – known as &quot;&#x27;Drax Completion&quot;&#x27; – was deferred, because during the project&#x27;s gestation the Board&#x27;s energy mix policy shifted to working towards a majority nuclear system. The Board decided in 1977 that construction of the final three units would commence in 1979 with the target of commissioning in 1985/6, as part of meeting load growth with an adjusted mix policy aiming for a balance of coal, nuclear, and oil. However, later that year in July, the Government requested that Drax Completion proceed immediately, ahead of requirements, in order to secure jobs in the North East&#x27;s heavy manufacturing industries. The Board agreed to this subject to being compensated.

The architects were Jeff King and Dennis Merritt of Clifford, Tee and Gale. The architectural critic Reyner Banham was scathing of the design: &#x27;less a brick cathedral than a concrete bunker... obsession with ribbed surfaces and forceful projections that have their origins in brutalism&#x27;. Costain constructed the foundations and cable tunnels; Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd. laid the roads and built the ancillary buildings; Mowlem laid the deep foundations; Alfred McAlpine built the administration and control buildings; Balfour Beatty undertook general building works; and James Scott installed cabling. 

Tarmac Construction undertook the civil engineering works; Holst Civil Engineers built the chimney; Bierrum &amp; Partners built the cooling towers; N.G. Bailey installed cabling; Reyrolle, English Electric and South Wales Switchgear produced and installed the switchgear; English Electric manufactured the generator cooling water pumps; T.W. Broadbent maintained the temporary electrical supplies; and Sulzer Brothers manufactured the boiler feed pumps. In both phases the boilers were made by Babcock Power Ltd and the generators by C. A. Parsons and Company.

The second phase was completed in 1986.

Construction of the power station entailed the demolition of a farm known as Wood House.

Mitsui Babcock fitted flue-gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment between 1988 and 1995.

===Post-privatisation===
On privatisation of the CEGB in 1990, the station was transferred from the CEGB to the privatised generating company National Power, which sold it to the AES Corporation in November 1999 for £1.87 billion (US$3 billion). AES relinquished ownership in August 2003, after falling into £1.3 billion of debt. Independent directors continued the operation to ensure security of supply. In December 2005, after refinancing, ownership passed to the Drax Group.

Separate acquisition offers from International Power, private equity group Texas Pacific, and a private equity backed bid from Constellation Energy were rejected for undervaluing the company. The company&#x27;s valuation subsequently increased to 2005 as a result of rising electricity prices, and on 15 December 2005 Drax Group plc floated its shares on the London Stock Exchange, issuing £400 million worth of shares, on a valuation of £2.6 billion.

In 2009, Drax Group submitted a planning application for the 300 MW biomass Ouse Renewable Energy Plant next to the power station. Government approval was obtained in mid 2011. In February 2012 the company ceased planning development of the plant, citing logistics costs, and uncertainty concerning government financial support for biomass.

===Carbon capture and storage===
In 2006 Drax Power Limited, in response to a government consultation, stated they were sponsoring development studies into carbon capture and storage (CCS), but noted that it was not then commercially viable, with costs comparable with nuclear or offshore wind power. On 17 June 2009, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband announced plans that would require all UK coal-fired power stations to be fitted with CCS technology by the early 2020s or face closure.

In 2012 a CCS project at Drax was shortlisted for government funding. In 2013 the White Rose Carbon Capture and Storage project (formerly the UK OXY CCS project) was shortlisted for the UK government&#x27;s CCS scheme and in late 2013 was awarded a two-year FEED contract (Front End Engineering Design) for the CCS project. As of June 2014, Drax is engaged in a joint venture with Alstom and BOC to build a 626 MW oxygen-fuelled combustion power station adjacent to the existing Drax site. National Grid would simultaneously construct a pipeline to transport to the Yorkshire coast for sequestration.

In July 2014 the project was awarded €300 million funding from the European Commission.


In September 2015 Drax announced it would not be making any further investments into the CCS scheme after completion of the feasibility study because negative changes to government support for renewable energy had made the project too financially risky, plus drops in the company&#x27;s share price due to the same uncertainty had reduced Drax&#x27;s ability to raise funds. Front End Engineering Design was expected to continue under Alstom and BOC with the project still being hosted at Drax. In late 2015 the UK Government withdrew its potential financial support for CCS projects – up to £1 billion of funding, reversing support promised in the governing party&#x27;s 2015 election manifesto. As a result, Leigh Hackett, CEO of Capture Power stated that &quot;[I]t is difficult to imagine its continuation in the absence of crucial government support&quot;.

In May 2018, Drax announced a new carbon capture and storage pilot scheme that it would undertake in conjunction with the Leeds-based firm, C-Capture. The focus of this pilot will be on capturing carbon post combustion from the biomass burners as opposed to the coal burners. Drax will invest £400,000 into the project. The company, C-Capture, is a side company of the Department of Chemistry established at the University of Leeds. This would yield about of stored per day from the process, which could be sold on for use in the drinks industry. The pilot scheme was launched in February 2019. The capture of carbon from biomas burners is known as Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).

==Design and specification==

The main buildings are of steel frame and metal clad construction. The main features are a turbine hall, a boiler house, a chimney and 12 cooling towers. The boiler house is high, and the turbine hall is long.

The chimney stands tall, with an overall diameter of , and weighs 44,000 tonnes. It consists of three elliptical flues of reinforced concrete, each serving two of the six boilers, set within a cylindrical &#x27;wind shield&#x27;, also of reinforced concrete. The topmost elements, the three cap rings of the flues which extend above the wind shield, are of cast iron. When finished, the chimney was the largest industrial chimney in the world, and is still the tallest in the United Kingdom. The chimney&#x27;s dimensions, including the height, were dictated by a design total capacity of 5,100 m3/s of gases at 26 m/s. As the station was designed and constructed prior to the CEGB&#x27;s commitment to Flue Gas Desulphurisation, extensive measures were made to limit acid attack from &#x27;sulphurous condensate&#x27;, namely the lining of the flues with a fluoroelastomer, and coating of the upper of the external surfaces with a mix of acid-resisting tiles and said fluoroelastomer.

The twelve tall natural draft cooling towers stand in two groups of six to the north and south of the station. They are made of reinforced concrete, in the typical hyperboloid design, and each have a base diameter of .

The station was the third-largest coal-fired power station in Europe, after Bełchatów Power Station in Poland, and Neurath Power Station in Germany. It produces around 24 terawatt hours (TWh) (86.4 petajoules) of electricity annually. Although it generates around 1,500,000 tonnes of ash and 22,800,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, it is the most carbon-efficient coal-fired power plant in the United Kingdom.

The design life was set out in terms of number of start-ups and operating &quot;cycles&quot;, but with the presumption that the station would operate as a standard 2nd-tier (nuclear stations being 1st-tier) baseload generator in the pattern well established under the centralised state-owned electricity system, it was summarised as &quot;in the order of 40 years&quot;. The minimum requirement was for providing &#x27;full load for weekdays, over a spell of 3 months&#x27; with an availability over 85%. Weekend operations were expected to be between 50–100% of full power. Despite this intent for baseload operation, it was designed with a reasonable ability for load-following, being able to ramp up or down by 5% of full power per minute within the range of 50–100% of full power.

===Ouse jetty ===
The power station also has a jetty on the River Ouse, with a loading capacity of 200 tonnes. Historically the jetty was built and used for the construction of the power station in the 1960s/70s – such as the delivery of equipment. In 2015 a planning application was submitted for the improvement of the jetty&#x27;s load capacity to 500 tonnes by White Rose CCS developer &quot;Capture Power Limited&quot; (Drax/Alstom/BOC joint venture), for the construction of the CCS project.

==Fuel supply==
The main transport route to the power station for fuel (originally coal) is train via a -long freight-only section of the former Hull and Barnsley Railway, from the Pontefract Line at Hensall Junction. A balloon loop rail layout is used so that wagons of coal do not need to be shunted after being unloaded. Merry-go-round trains are used, so that wagons can be unloaded without the train stopping as it passes through an unloading house. On average, there are 35 deliveries a day, 6 days a week.

The power station also has a jetty (see § Jetty) – imports via the jetty ended c.1980 – in 2004 the jetty was trialled for the import of Tall Oil by barge.

===Coal supply until 2021===
In its original form, the station had a maximum potential consumption of 36,000 tonnes of coal a day. In 2011, it consumed 9.1 million tonnes of coal. This coal came from a mixture of both domestic and international sources, with domestic coal coming from mines in Yorkshire, the Midlands and Scotland, and foreign supplies coming from Australia, Colombia, Poland, Russia and South Africa. As of 2020, all coal was sourced internationally.

Fuel and other bulk commodities were supplied via a 6 mile stretch of the old Hull and Barnsley Railway line off the Wakefield and Goole railway line. Rail facilities include a west-facing junction on the Goole line, gross-weight and tare-weight weighbridges, limestone and gypsum handling facilities, including a handling building and control room for the FGD plant, FGD Sidings G and H, biomass offload (Track A), coal offload (Tracks A, B and C), bypass line (Track D), oil siding (Track E) and ash loading (Track F) and an unloading building and control room.

When the station opened, most of the coal burned was from local collieries in Yorkshire, including Kellingley Colliery, Prince of Wales, Ackton Hall, Sharlston Colliery, Fryston Colliery, Askern Colliery and Bentley Colliery. Following the miners&#x27; strike in the mid-1980s, by 2006, all but Kellingley had closed. (Kellingley closed at the end of 2015.) UK Coal had a five-year contract to supply coal, which ended at the end of 2009, from Kellingley, Maltby and, until its closure in 2007, Rossington. Coal was also brought from Harworth Colliery until it was mothballed, and was supplied by Daw Mill in Warwickshire.

The foreign coal was brought via various ports by rail. In c.2007 GB Railfreight won a contract to move coal brought from the Port of Tyne, celebrated by the company naming one of their locomotives &quot;Drax Power Station&quot; in 2007. DB Cargo UK haul coal from the nearby ports of Hull and Immingham, and from Hunterston Terminal on the west coast of Scotland.

In 2021, all coal supplies to Drax Power Station and commercial electricity generation from coal ended in accordance with the plan to end coal fired generation announced in 2020 which will see Drax transition to biomass ahead of the deadline to phase out coal from the UK energy system.

==Biomass==
===Co-firing===

The station tested co-firing biomass in the summer of 2004, and in doing so was the first power station in the UK to be fuelled by wood. The initial trial of 14,100 tonnes of willow was locally sourced from nearby Eggborough. Since the trial, the station&#x27;s use of biomass has continued. It uses direct injection for firing the biomass, whereby it bypasses the pulverising mills and is either injected directly into the boiler or the fuel line, for greater throughput. In 2009 a target was set for 12.5% of the station&#x27;s energy to be sourced from biomass, and the shift to biomass was intended to contribute to the aim of cutting emissions by 15%. 

The station burns a large range of biomass, mostly wood pellets, sunflower pellets, olive, peanut shell husk and rape meal. The majority comes from overseas. A 100,000 tonne pa capacity straw pelletization facility was constructed at Capitol Park, Goole in 2008, opened 2009. Construction of specialised biomass handling facilities began in 2009 at the Port of Tyne and at Drax.

===New biomass plants===
In the 2000s Drax Group applied for planning permission to build a new 300 MW power station, fuelled entirely by biomass, to the north of the station; the Ouse Renewable Energy Plant was expected to burn 1,400,000 tonnes of biomass each year, saving 1,850,000 tonnes of emissions, and expected to create 850 construction jobs and 150 permanent jobs created once opened, through direct and contract employment. Plans were submitted to the Department of Energy and Climate Change in July 2009 for review; if permission was granted, construction was scheduled begin in late 2010 and to take up to three and a half years. Two other 300 MW biomass plants were planned by Drax at the ports of Hull and Immingham.

In 2012 Drax group abandoned plans for the discrete biomass plant development, due to changes in government subsidies for biomass energy production favouring plant conversions over newly built plants. It switched to a project to convert half of the units at its existing plant to biomass firing.

===Full firing with biomass===
In September 2012 Drax Group announced the conversion to full firing with biomass of three of its six units. The first unit was scheduled to be online by June 2013, the second unit in 2014, and the third by 2017; initially a biomass supply had been secured for the first unit. The cost was estimated at £700 million ($1.13 billion), including modifications to fuel mills and boilers and the construction of storage structures and conveyors for the wood pellet fuel. Each unit will consume about 2.3 million tonnes of biomass yearly, requiring an estimated annual total of 7.5 million tonnes in 2017. This is equivalent to two-thirds of Europe&#x27;s entire energy biomass consumption in 2010, and requires of forest to supply on a continuous basis. North America was expected to be the source of the vast majority of the biomass, although some would be domestically sourced willow and elephant grass.

Drax Group&#x27;s decision was enabled by a new UK government policy, effective in April 2013, to award 1.0 tradable ROCs (renewable obligation certificates) per megawatt of power generation from coal power plants that are fully converted to burn biomass; CEO Dorothy Thompson stated the company intended to become a predominately biomass-fuelled energy producer. By April 2013 financing for the scheme include £190 million through sale of shares, £100 million from Prudential/ M&amp;G UK Companies Financing Fund, £50 million from the UK Green Investment Bank, and £75 million Friends Life (underwritten by HM Treasury), as well as a £400 million credit facility.

As of 2013 there were plans to install 1 million tonne per year wood pellets pelletizing plants at Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, and Gloster, Mississippi, which would be shipped by road and rail to the port of Baton Rouge, Louisiana then shipped in 50,000-tonne cargo ships to UK. In the financial report for 2013, Drax announced that an additional 2 million tons pelletisation capacity was being considered, likely to be built in the US.

In 2013 the company signed an agreement with Associated British Ports to develop handling facilities at the Hull, Immingham and Grimsby; construction of automated facilities began in 2013, creating capacities of 3 and 1 million tonnes per year at the ports of Immingham and Hull respectively, adding to the 1.4 million tonne per year Port of Tyne biomass facility built in 2009. In the same year a new design covered rail wagon with high volumetric capacity for transporting the low density biomass pellets was unveiled for use by Drax in the UK; 200 wagons of the type were ordered. At Drax pellets would be stored in domes, and transferred by a conveyor system before grinding to dust for use.

The Shepherd Building Group was contracted to construct the biomass handling and storage facilities at Drax, with RPS Group as the civil engineer. The design included automated rail to storage handling, screening and storage facilities consisting of four high by wide storage domes with a capacity of . The concrete dome technology was supplied by E &amp; D Company, PLLC (trading as Engineering System Solutions, ES2) and Dome Technology LLC.

By July 2013 one firing unit had been converted, and was reported to be functioning correctly; by 2013 the conversion of the second and third units was scheduled for 2014 and during or before 2016 respectively. The second unit was converted by May 2014, initially co-firing an 85% biomass/coal mix due to limited biomass supply.

In April 2014 Drax was awarded a renewable contract for difference (CFD) subsidy for biomass based power generation on another converted coal firing unit, but a third unit, which had been previously marked as eligible for CFD funding was excluded; Drax Group then legally challenged the decision, initially obtaining a ruling in its favour, which was overturned in the Court of Appeal. In July 2014 the High Court ruled in Drax&#x27;s favour.

Biomass conversion at Drax led to it requiring 82% of UK biomass imports from the US in 2014 (60% overall of all US wood pellet export), a large factor in a 40% yearly increase in biomass export from that country; US sourced imports represented 58% of Drax&#x27;s biomass use in 2014, with 22% from Canada.

A port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana was completed by April 2015. In mid-2015 Drax reached an agreement with Peel Ports to construct a 3 million ton per year biomass importation facility at the Port of Liverpool, estimated cost £100 million. The rail connected facility was to include 100,000 tonnes storage, and be constructed by Graham Construction.

In September 2015 Drax Group and Infinis began a legal action against the UK government due to claimed insufficient notice being given about the withdrawal of a climate related tax exemption (see Climate Change Levy) – Drax claimed the change would reduce its earnings by £30 million. The claim was rejected by the High Court in February 2016.

In December 2016 the European Competition Commission approved UK government subsidies for the conversion of the third unit to biomass burning.

In 2024, Drax paid a penalty of £25 million to Ofgem after the regulator determined there was &quot;an absence of adequate data governance and controls in place&quot; regarding Canadian wood sources from April 2021 to March 2022. Ofgem found the breach was technical and not deliberate.

Drax&#x27;s subsidy scheme was scheduled to end in 2027, with Drax arguing for an extension to 2030. In February 2025, the UK government extended its operation from 2027 to 2031, but at a reduced 27% maximum load factor using 100% sustainable wood, so it would run &quot;less than half as often as it currently does&quot;, generally only at times of high electricity demand. Drax was given a contract for difference at £113/MWh in 2012 pounds, CPI inflation linked so about £155/MWh in 2025.

===Petroleum coke===
The station started to trial the co-firing of petroleum coke (petcoke) in one of its boilers in June 2005, ending in June 2007, burning 15% petcoke and 85% coal. Petcoke was burned to make the electricity more competitive as the price of running the FGD equipment was making the electricity more expensive. The Environment Agency (EA) granted permission for the trial in June 2004, despite the plans being opposed by Friends of the Earth and Selby Council. To meet their concerns, emissions were constantly monitored through the trial, and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating the FGD plant to remove the high sulphur content of the emissions. The trial proved that there were no significant negative effects on the environment, and so in late 2007 Drax Group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burning. The EA granted permission in early 2008 after agreeing with Drax&#x27;s findings that the fuel had no significant negative effects on the environment. The station was able to burn up to 300,000 tonnes of the fuel a year, and stock up to 6,000 tonnes on site.

==Electricity generation==

Coal is fed into one of 30 coal bunkers, each with a capacity of 1,000 tonnes. Each bunker feeds two of the 60 pulverisers, each of which can crush 36 tonnes of coal an hour. The station has six Babcock Power boilers, each weighing 4,000 tonnes. The powdered coal from ten pulverisers is blasted into each boiler through burners, which are ignited by propane. In 2003 the original burners were replaced by low nitrogen oxide burners. 

Each of the six boilers feed steam to a steam turbine set, consisting of one high pressure (HP) turbine, one intermediate pressure (IP) turbine and three low pressure (LP) turbines. Each HP turbine generates 140 MW. Exhaust steam from them is fed back to the boiler and reheated, then fed to the 250 MW IP turbines and finally passes through the 90MW LP turbines. This gives each generating set a generating capacity of 660 MW: with six generating sets, the station has a total capacity of 3,960 MW. Each of the generating units is equipped with the Advanced Plant Management System (APMS), a system developed by RWE npower and Thales, and implemented by Capula.

The station also has six gas turbines providing backup for breakdowns, or shut downs in the National Grid. Their annual output is generally low, generating 75 MW and three of the units have been mothballed and are out of operation, but they could be refurbished. Emissions from these units are released through the station&#x27;s second, smaller chimney, to the south of the main stack.

Between 2007 and 2012 the high and low pressure turbines were replaced by Siemens in a £100 million programme.

===Cooling system===
Water is essential to a thermal power station, heated to create steam to turn the steam turbines. Water used in the boilers is taken from two licensed boreholes on site. Once this water has been through the turbines it is cooled by condensers using water taken from the nearby River Ouse. Water is pumped from the river by a pumphouse on the river, north of the station. Once it has been through the condenser, the water is cooled by one of the natural draft cooling towers, with two towers serving each generating set. Once cooled, the water is discharged back into the river.

==Waste products==
===Flue gas desulphurisation===
All six units are served by an independent wet limestone-gypsum FGD plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide. This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. 

A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes to be used in the manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line). DB Cargo UK transport the gypsum.

In 2023, Drax announced a full withdrawal from using coal power past the winter contingency agreement, Drax announced that it will now embark on a decommissioning process to remove coal-related infrastructure from the site. This will commence with the removal of the flue gas desulphurisation plant that was built in the 1990s to remove 90% of the sulphur from the plant’s air emissions.

===Ash use and disposal===
Pulverised fuel ash (PFA) and furnace bottom ash (FBA) are two byproducts from the burning of coal. Each year, the station produces about 1,000,000 tonnes of PFA and around 220,000 tonnes of FBA: all FBA and 85% of PFA is sold. Under the trade name Drax Ash Products, the ash is sold to the local building industry, where it is used in the manufacture of blocks, cement products, grouting and the laying of roads. The ash is also used in other parts of the UK.

Between 2005 and 2007, PFA was used as an infill at four disused salt mines in Northwich in Cheshire. 1,100,000 tonnes was used in the project, which was to avoid a future risk of subsidence in the town. Ash was delivered by DB Schenker in ten trains a week, each carrying 1,100 tonnes. Following a trial in January 2010, PFA is also transported to Waterford, Ireland by boat. One ship a month will transport 1,200 tonnes for the manufacture of construction materials. This will replace 480 lorry journeys annually and is deemed more environmentally friendly.

The unsold PFA is sent by conveyor belt to the Barlow ash mound, which is used for disposal and temporary stockpile. Three conveyors feed the mound, with a total capacity of 750 tonnes an hour. FGD gypsum is disposed of on the mound if it is not of a high enough grade to be sold. The mound has won a number of awards for its nature conservation work.

==Environmental effects==
The environmental effects of coal burning are well documented. Coal is considered to be &quot;easily the most carbon-intensive and polluting form of energy generation available&quot;. In 2007 the station produced 22,160,000 tonnes of , making it the largest single source of in the UK. Between 2000 and 2007, there has been a net increase in carbon dioxide of over 3,000,000 tonnes. The station also had the highest estimated emissions of nitrogen oxides in the European Union.

In 2007, in a move to try to lower emissions, Drax Group signed a £100 million contract with Siemens Power Generation to re-blade the steam turbines over four years. This is the largest steam turbine modernisation ever undertaken in the UK, and will increase efficiency. Coupled with the co-firing of biomass, this was part of a target to reduce emissions by 15% by 2011.

Drax&#x27;s annual report for 2013 reported that Drax&#x27;s annual emissions were at 20,612,000 tonnes of . This was a slight decrease from 2007 levels due to the burning of biomass. Drax remained the UK&#x27;s largest single emitter of carbon dioxide up until 2016, when the power station claimed that its improvement programmes and conversion to burning biomass, had meant a drastic decrease in greenhouses gases being released into the atmosphere.

Drax has opted in to the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) and thus is permitted to continue operating beyond 2015. The use of flue gas desulfurisation ensures that the limits on sulphur dioxide emissions are not exceeded.

==Protests, industrial action and incidents==
===Climate Camp (2006)===

On 31 August 2006, over 600 people attended a protest against the high carbon emissions. It was coordinated by the Camp for Climate Action group. At least 3,000 police officers from 12 forces were reported to have been drafted in for the duration of the protest, to safeguard electricity supplies and prevent the protesters from shutting the station down. Thirty-nine people were arrested after trying illegally to gain access to the plant.

===Train protest (2008)===
At 8:00 am on 13 June 2008, more than 30 climate change campaigners halted an EWS coal train en route to the station by disguising themselves as rail workers by wearing high-visibility clothing and waving red flags. Stopping the train on a bridge across the River Aire, they scaled the wagons with the aid of the bridge&#x27;s girders. They then mounted a banner reading &quot;Leave it in the ground&quot; on the side of the wagon and tied the train to the bridge, preventing it from moving. They then shovelled more than 20 tonnes of coal on to the railway line. The protest lasted the whole day, until several protesters were removed from the train by police that night. The station&#x27;s management said that the protest had no effect on output. The action was coordinated by Camp for Climate Action.

===Worker strike (2009)===
On 18 June 2009, fewer than 200 contractors walked out of or failed to show up in a wildcat strike, showing solidarity with workers at the Lindsey Oil Refinery in Lincolnshire where 51 workers had been laid off while another employer on the site was recruiting more staff. A spokeswoman said the strike did not affect electricity output.

===Biomass fires (2011, 2013)===
In October 2011 a fire started by spontaneous combustion in a stockpile at the Port of Tyne biomass facility. Another fire occurred at the same facility in a conveyor transfer tower in October 2013.

<doc id="302201" wikidata="Q11249" url="?curid=302201" title="Midtown Manhattan">
<text>Midtown Manhattan is the central portion of the New York City borough of Manhattan, serving as the city&#x27;s primary central business district. Midtown is home to some of the city&#x27;s most prominent buildings, including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, the headquarters of the United Nations, Grand Central Terminal, and Rockefeller Center, as well as several prominent tourist destinations, including Broadway, Times Square, and Koreatown. Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan is the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere.

Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the world, and has been ranked as the densest central business district in the world in terms of employees, at . Midtown also ranks among the world&#x27;s most expensive locations for real estate; Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan has commanded the world&#x27;s highest retail rents and had been ranked as the most expensive shopping street in the world before falling to second in 2024. Midtown Manhattan is the country&#x27;s largest commercial, entertainment, and media center, and is also a growing financial and fintech center.

Many of New York City&#x27;s skyscrapers, including its tallest hotels and apartment towers, are located in Midtown Manhattan. The neighborhood hosts commuters and residents working in its offices, hotels, and retail establishments, tourists and students. Times Square, the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, is a major center of the world&#x27;s entertainment industry. Sixth Avenue also has the headquarters of three of the four major U.S. television networks.

Midtown is part of Manhattan Community District 5. It is patrolled by the 14th and 18th precincts of the New York City Police Department.

==Location==

Geographically, the northern boundary of Midtown Manhattan is commonly defined to be 59th Street; its southern boundary is less clear, and variously taken to be 34th Street, 23rd Street, or even 14th Street. Midtown spans the entire island of Manhattan along an east–west axis, bounded by the East River on its east and the Hudson River to its west. &quot;The Encyclopedia of New York City&quot; defines Midtown as extending from 34th Street to 59th Street and from 3rd Avenue to 8th Avenue.

===Neighborhoods===



In addition to its central business district, Midtown Manhattan encompasses many neighborhoods, including Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and Chelsea on the West Side, and Murray Hill, Kips Bay, Turtle Bay, and Gramercy Park on the East Side. It is sometimes broken into &quot;Midtown East&quot; and &quot;Midtown West&quot;, or north and south as in the New York City Police Department&#x27;s &quot;Midtown North&quot; and &quot;Midtown South&quot; precincts.

===Differing demarcations===
The border of Midtown Manhattan is nebulous and further confused by the fact that the term &quot;Midtown Manhattan&quot; can be used to refer either to a district or a group of neighborhoods and districts in Manhattan:
* The area between 14th and 86th Streets includes roughly the center of Manhattan; however, the term Midtown Manhattan can also apply to the area between 31st Street and 59th Streets, although there are still office buildings south of 31st Street.
* Manhattan Community District 5 is located from 14th to 59th Streets, generally between Lexington Avenue and Eighth Avenue. Community District 5 is largely coterminous with Midtown but also includes the Flatiron District, NoMad, Union Square, and parts of Gramercy Park and Rose Hill.
* Midtown proper (within the boundaries of Manhattan Community District 5, and excluding overlapping neighborhoods) is located from 34th to 59th Streets between Third Avenue and Eighth Avenue.
* The &quot;Plaza District&quot;, a term used by Manhattan real estate professionals to denote the most expensive area of midtown from a commercial real estate perspective, lies between 42nd Street and 59th Street, from 3rd Avenue to 7th Avenue, about a square kilometer or half a square mile.
* &quot;Midtown South&quot; can refer to the part of Midtown between 23rd Street and around 42nd Street (although its northern boundary is defined differently depending on the source).
* &quot;Midtown West&quot; can refer to the area between 34th and 59th Streets, and between 5th and 12th Avenues.
* &quot;Midtown East&quot; can refer to the area between 42nd and 59th Streets, and between 5th Avenue and the East River.
* In 1982, the City of New York identified the &quot;Manhattan Core&quot; as the area that includes some of the city&#x27;s most populous neighborhoods, major institutions, parks and transit hubs, and the city&#x27;s primary Central Business District (CBD), defined as Manhattan below 60th Street. The &quot;Manhattan Core&quot; includes some areas slightly further north of 86th Street in Manhattan, as well as the area below 14th Street. However, this definition is problematic because it ignores the fact that Manhattan has not one but two zones that are job centers, which are separated by a wide swath of low-rise (by New York City standards) residential development: Midtown (which is &quot;in&quot; Midtown Manhattan) and the Financial District (also known simply as &quot;Downtown&quot; because of its location in southern Manhattan). In other sources, these districts are referred to as separate central business districts.
===Cityscape===
==Economy==
Midtown Manhattan, along with Lower Manhattan, is one of the world&#x27;s leading financial centers.

===Corporate headquarters===
Midtown Manhattan is the world&#x27;s largest central business district, with 400 million square feet (37.2 million m2) of office space in 2018.

====Foreign subsidiary operations====
Haier operates its United States offices in the Haier Building at 1356 Broadway, formerly the headquarters of the Greenwich Savings Bank. Haier held the opening ceremony on March 4, 2002. Sumitomo Corporation operates its New York Office, the headquarters of the corporation&#x27;s United States operations, at 600 Third Avenue, 10016 in the Murray Hill neighborhood. El Al&#x27;s North American headquarters are in Midtown. The Air France USA regional headquarters are in 125 West 55th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Hachette Book Group USA has its headquarters in 237 Park Avenue. In 1994 Alitalia considered moving its USA headquarters from Midtown to Lower Manhattan, but decided to keep the offices where they were at the last minute. Global Infrastructure Partners has an office in Midtown Manhattan.

===Tech and biotech===
Silicon Alley, the common metonym for New York City&#x27;s high tech sector, is based in Midtown South, specifically the Flatiron District. Prominent Silicon Alley companies in Midtown include AppNexus, Blue Apron, Gilt, Betterment, Oscar, SoFi, Rent the Runway, Warby Parker, and WeWork. The technology sector has been expanding across Midtown Manhattan since 2010. The biotechnology sector is also growing in Midtown Manhattan based upon the city&#x27;s strength in academic scientific research and public and commercial financial support. By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, had raised more than US$30 million from investors, including Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, for initial funding to create biotechnology startups at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which encompasses more than on East 29th Street and promotes collaboration among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, medical, and research institutions.
The New York City Economic Development Corporation&#x27;s Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture capital partners, including Celgene, General Electric Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed a minimum of US$100 million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures in life sciences and biotechnology.

===Real estate===

Real estate is a major force in Midtown Manhattan&#x27;s economy, and indeed the city&#x27;s, as the total value of all New York City property was estimated at US$914.8 billion for the 2015 fiscal year. Manhattan has perennially been home to some of the nation&#x27;s, as well as one of the world&#x27;s, most marketable real estate, including the Time Warner Center, which had the highest-listed market value in the city in 2006 at US$1.1 billion, to be subsequently surpassed in October 2014 by the Waldorf Astoria New York, which became the most expensive hotel ever sold after being purchased by the Anbang Insurance Group, based in China, for . In the same year, six of the top ten most expensive zip codes in the United States by median housing price were located in Manhattan, underscoring the borough&#x27;s dominant position in the real estate market. When 450 Park Avenue was sold on July 2, 2007, for US$510 million, about US$1,589 per square foot (US$17,104/m2), it broke the barely month-old record for an American office building of US$1,476 per square foot (US$15,887/m2) based on the sale of 660 Madison Avenue. In 2014, Manhattan was home to six of the top ten zip codes in the United States by median housing price. In 2019, the most expensive home sale ever in the United States achieved completion in Midtown Manhattan, at a selling price of US$238 million, for a penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park at 220 Central Park South.

The COVID-19 pandemic and hybrid work models have prompted consideration of commercial-to-residential conversion within the neighborhood&#x27;s real estate sector. In August 2023, Mayor Eric Adams announced a program aimed at creating &quot;a 24/7, live-work, mixed-use neighborhood&quot; in Midtown South though the conversion of commercial and office space to residential, as part of an effort to create 20,000 new residences citywide in a decade.

===Broadway theatre===

<text>In mathematics, an element of a *-algebra is called self-adjoint if it is the same as its adjoint (i.e. formula_1).

== Definition ==

Let formula_2 be a *-algebra. An element formula_3 is called self-adjoint if 

The set of self-adjoint elements is referred to as 

A subset formula_4 that is closed under the involution *, i.e. formula_5, is called 

A special case of particular importance is the case where formula_2 is a complete normed *-algebra, that satisfies the C*-identity (formula_7), which is called a C*-algebra.

Especially in the older literature on *-algebras and C*-algebras, such elements are often called Because of that the notations formula_8, formula_9 or formula_10 for the set of self-adjoint elements are also sometimes used, even in the more recent literature.

== Examples ==

* Each positive element of a C*-algebra is 
* For each element formula_11 of a *-algebra, the elements formula_12 and formula_13 are self-adjoint, since * is an 
* For each element formula_11 of a *-algebra, the real and imaginary parts formula_15 and formula_16 are self-adjoint, where formula_17 denotes the 
* If formula_18 is a normal element of a C*-algebra formula_2, then for every real-valued function formula_20, which is continuous on the spectrum of formula_11, the continuous functional calculus defines a self-adjoint element 

== Criteria ==

Let formula_2 be a *-algebra. Then:

* Let formula_3, then formula_13 is self-adjoint, since formula_25. A similarly calculation yields that formula_12 is also 
* Let formula_27 be the product of two self-adjoint elements Then formula_11 is self-adjoint if formula_29 and formula_30 commutate, since formula_31 always 
* If formula_2 is a C*-algebra, then a normal element formula_18 is self-adjoint if and only if its spectrum is real, i.e. 

== Properties ==
=== In *-algebras ===

Let formula_2 be a *-algebra. Then:

* Each element formula_3 can be uniquely decomposed into real and imaginary parts, i.e. there are uniquely determined elements formula_36, so that formula_37 holds. Where formula_38 and (a - a^*)&lt;/math&gt;.}}
* The set of self-adjoint elements formula_39 is a real linear subspace of From the previous property, it follows that formula_2 is the direct sum of two real linear subspaces, i.e. 
* If formula_41 is self-adjoint, then formula_11 is 
* The *-algebra formula_2 is called a hermitian *-algebra if every self-adjoint element formula_41 has a real spectrum 

=== In C*-algebras ===

Let formula_2 be a C*-algebra and formula_41. Then:

* For the spectrum formula_47 or formula_48 holds, since formula_49 is real and formula_50 holds for the spectral radius, because formula_11 is 
* According to the continuous functional calculus, there exist uniquely determined positive elements formula_52, such that formula_53 with For the norm, formula_54 holds. The elements formula_55 and formula_56 are also referred to as the positive and negative parts. In addition, formula_57 holds for the absolute value defined for every element 
* For every formula_58 and odd formula_59, there exists a uniquely determined formula_60 that satisfies formula_61, i.e. a unique formula_62-th root, as can be shown with the continuous functional

<text>Alf Robert Olof Svensson (born 1 October 1938) is a Swedish politician and author. He was a Member of the European Parliament from 2009 to 2014. Svensson was the leader of the Christian Democrats in Sweden between 1973 and 3 April 2004. He was a Member of Parliament from 1985 to 1988, and again from 1991 until his election to the European Parliament in 2009. Between 1991 and 1994 he was Minister for Development Cooperation in the liberal-conservative Cabinet led by Prime Minister Carl Bildt.

==Biography==
Svensson was trained as a teacher, and taught Swedish and history at a high school in Huskvarna from 1963 until 1973.

He was a member of the Christian Democrats from the party&#x27;s foundation in 1964; he was also one of the founders of its youth wing, Young Christian Democrats, in 1966, and was its chairman from 1970 to 1973. In 1973 he became the leader of the party, after its first leader Birger Ekstedt had died in 1972. Svensson was elected to the council of Gränna, following which he was elected to Jönköping&#x27;s municipal council and later to Jönköping&#x27;s county council.

At the 1985 elections the Christian Democrats, which had so far not won any parliamentary representation, entered into an election alliance with the Centre Party. Owing to this Svensson won a seat in the Riksdag (parliament), making him the first Christian Democrat MP, but disappointingly for the party this was its only such success. At the 1988 elections the alliance had been dissolved, and the Christian Democrats failed to get enough votes to enter the parliament on its own. At the 1991 elections the party secured the election of 26 MPs, and Svensson received the cabinet post of Minister for Development Cooperation in a four-party coalition government under the leadership of Carl Bildt.

Svensson resigned as party leader in 2004 and was succeeded by Göran Hägglund, but remained in parliament. Svensson has been party leader for 30 years, a record in Swedish politics. In the 2009 election to the European Parliament, he was elected an MEP and left the Riksdag. During his time as an MEP in European parliament, Svensson encouraged the EU to pay attention to poorer countries in the union as well called for improved cordination between member states.

Svensson, whose leadership of the Christian Democrats lasted over three decades (1973–2004), is a firm supporter of the European Union and its Economic and Monetary Union, unlike many of his voters who are in general more sceptical about the introduction of the euro.

=== Family ===
Svensson is married and has three children.

<text>Minimum message length (MML) is a Bayesian information-theoretic method for statistical model comparison and selection. It provides a formal information theory restatement of Occam&#x27;s Razor: even when models are equal in their measure of fit-accuracy to the observed data, the one generating the most concise &quot;explanation&quot; of data is more likely to be correct (where the &quot;explanation&quot; consists of the statement of the model, followed by the lossless encoding of the data using the stated model). MML was invented by Chris Wallace, first appearing in the seminal paper &quot;An information measure for classification&quot;. MML is intended not just as a theoretical construct, but as a technique that may be deployed in practice. It differs from the related concept of Kolmogorov complexity in that it does not require use of a Turing-complete language to model data.

==Definition==
Shannon&#x27;s &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot; (1948) states that in an optimal code, the message length (in binary) of an event formula_1, formula_2, where formula_1 has probability formula_4, is given by formula_5.

Bayes&#x27;s theorem states that the probability of a (variable) hypothesis formula_6 given fixed evidence formula_1 is proportional to formula_8, which, by the definition of conditional probability, is equal to formula_9. We want the model (hypothesis) with the highest such posterior probability. Suppose we encode a message which represents (describes) both model and data jointly. Since formula_10, the most probable model will have the shortest such message. The message breaks into two parts: formula_11. The first part encodes the model itself. The second part contains information (e.g., values of parameters, or initial conditions, etc.) that, when processed by the model, outputs the observed data.

MML naturally and precisely trades model complexity for goodness of fit. A more complicated model takes longer to state (longer first part) but probably fits the data better (shorter second part). So, an MML metric won&#x27;t choose a complicated model unless that model pays for itself.

==Continuous-valued parameters==
One reason why a model might be longer would be simply because its various parameters are stated to greater precision, thus requiring transmission of more digits. Much of the power of MML derives from its handling of how accurately to state parameters in a model, and a variety of approximations that make this feasible in practice. This makes it possible to usefully compare, say, a model with many parameters imprecisely stated against a model with fewer parameters more accurately stated.

==Key features of MML==
* MML can be used to compare models of different structure. For example, its earliest application was in finding mixture models with the optimal number of classes. Adding extra classes to a mixture model will always allow the data to be fitted to greater accuracy, but according to MML this must be weighed against the extra bits required to encode the parameters defining those classes. 
* MML is a method of Bayesian model comparison. It gives every model a score.
* MML is scale-invariant and statistically invariant. Unlike many Bayesian selection methods, MML doesn&#x27;t care if you change from measuring length to volume or from Cartesian co-ordinates to polar co-ordinates.
* MML is statistically consistent. For problems like the Neyman-Scott (1948) problem or factor analysis where the amount of data per parameter is bounded above, MML can estimate all parameters with statistical consistency.
* MML accounts for the precision of measurement. It uses the Fisher information (in the Wallace-Freeman 1987 approximation, or other hyper-volumes in other approximations) to optimally discretize continuous parameters. Therefore the posterior is always a probability, not a probability density.
* MML has been in use since 1968. MML coding schemes have been developed for several distributions, and many kinds of machine learners including unsupervised classification, decision trees and graphs, DNA sequences, Bayesian networks, neural networks (one-layer only so far), image compression, image and function segmentation, etc.

<doc id="302212" wikidata="Q202093" url="?curid=302212" title="Heart of Midlothian F.C.">
<text>Heart of Midlothian Football Club, commonly known as Hearts, is a professional football club in Edinburgh, Scotland. The team competes in the Scottish Premiership, the top division of Scottish football. Hearts, the oldest football club in the Scottish capital, was formed in 1874, its name influenced by Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot;. The club crest is based on the Heart of Midlothian mosaic on the city&#x27;s Royal Mile; the team&#x27;s colours are maroon and white.

Hearts have played home matches at Tynecastle Park since 1886. After converting the ground into an all-seater stadium in 1990, it now has a capacity of following the completion of a rebuilt main stand in 2017. They have training facilities at the Oriam, Scotland&#x27;s national performance centre for sport, where they also run their youth academy.

Hearts have won the Scottish league championship four times, most recently in 1959–60, when they also retained the Scottish League Cup to complete a League and League Cup double – the only club outside of the Old Firm to achieve such a feat.

The club&#x27;s most successful period was under former player turned manager Tommy Walker from the early 1950s to mid 1960s, during which they won two league titles and five major cups and finished inside the league&#x27;s top four positions for 11 consecutive seasons and 1954 and 1962. Jimmy Wardhaugh, Willie Bauld and Alfie Conn Sr., known as the Terrible Trio, were forwards at the start of this period with wing half linchpins Dave Mackay and John Cumming. Wardhaugh was part of another notable Hearts attacking trinity in the 1957–58 league winning side: along with Jimmy Murray and Alex Young, they set the record for the number of goals scored in a Scottish top-flight winning campaign (132) and also became the only side to finish a season in the Scottish top tier with a goal difference exceeding 100 (+103).

Hearts have won the Scottish Cup eight times, most recently in 2012 after a 5–1 victory over Hibernian, their local rivals. They have since been beaten finalists in 2019, 2020 and 2022. All four of Hearts&#x27; Scottish League Cup triumphs came under Walker, most recently a 1–0 victory against Kilmarnock in 1962. Their most recent League Cup Final appearance was in 2013, where they lost 3–2 to St Mirren.

In 1958, Heart of Midlothian became the third Scottish and fifth British team to compete in European competition. The club reached the quarter-finals of the 1988–89 UEFA Cup, losing to Bayern Munich 2–1 on aggregate.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
The club was formed by a group of friends from the Heart of Midlothian Quadrille Assembly Club. The group of friends bought a ball before playing local rules football at the Tron from where they were directed by a local policeman to The Meadows to play. Local rules football was a mix of rugby and association football. In December 1873 a match was held between XIs selected by Mr Thomson from Queen&#x27;s Park and Mr Gardner from Clydesdale at Raimes Park in Bonnington. This was the first time that Association rules had been seen in Edinburgh. Members from the dance club viewed the match and in 1874 decided to adopt the association rules. The new side was Heart of Mid-Lothian Football Club. The exact date of the club&#x27;s formation was never recorded; however, 1874 is regarded as the year of formation as it was when association rules were taken on, although Tom Purdie claimed the club was formed in 1873. The earliest mention of &quot;Heart of Midlothian&quot; in a sporting context is a report in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper from 20 July 1864 of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; vs Heart of Mid-Lothian at cricket. It is not known if this was the same club who went on to form the football club, but it was common for football clubs in those days to play other sports as well.

The club took its name from historic county Midlothian, dating from the Middle Ages, as well as the Heart of Midlothian mosaic on the Royal Mile, which marks the historic entrance to the Old Tolbooth jail, which was demolished in 1817 but was kept fresh in the mind by Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot;.
Led by captain Tom Purdie the club played its matches in the East Meadows and in 1875 Hearts became members of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and were founder members of the Edinburgh Football Association. By becoming members of the SFA Hearts were able to play in the Scottish Cup for the first time. Hearts played against 3rd Edinburgh Rifle Volunteers F.C. in October 1875 at Craigmount Park in Edinburgh. The game ended in a scoreless draw. A replay was held at the Meadows which again finished 0–0. Under rules at the time both clubs progressed to the next round with Hearts losing out to Drumpellier in the next round.

In the 1884–85 season, clubs in Scotland struggled to attract quality players who preferred to play professionally in England. After an 11–1 win in the Scottish Cup over Dunfermline a protest was raised against the club for fielding two professional players, which was against the rules at the time. Hearts were suspended by the SFA for two years - the first ever suspension of an SFA club. They were readmitted after a change of the club&#x27;s committee.

=== Early success ===
Hearts had considerable success in the early years of the Scottish Football League, winning the league championship in 1895 and 1896. They also won four Scottish Cups in a 15-year period from 1891 to 1906. The team played against Sunderland in the 1894–95 World Championship, but lost with a 5–3 score. Hearts did win the World Championship title in 1902, beating Tottenham Hotspur 3–1 in Tynecastle Park, after a 0–0 in London a few months earlier.

=== Hearts in World War I ===

In November 1914, Heart of Midlothian comfortably led the First Division, having started the 1914–15 season with eight straight victories, including a 2–0 defeat of reigning champions Celtic.

This streak coincided with the start of the First World War and the beginnings of a public debate upon the morality of continuing professional football while young soldiers were dying on the front-line. A motion was placed before the Scottish Football Association to postpone the season, with one of its backers, Airdrieonians chairman Thomas Forsyth declaring that &quot;playing football while our men are fighting is repugnant&quot;. While this motion was defeated at the ballot box, with the SFA opting to wait for War Office advice, the East London philanthropist Frederick Nicholas Charrington was orchestrating a public campaign to have professional football in Britain suspended, and achieving great popular support for his cause. The prime tactic of Charrington&#x27;s campaign was to shame football players and officials into action through public and private denouncement. In response, sixteen players from Hearts enlisted in Sir George McCrae&#x27;s new volunteer battalion, joining en masse on 25 November 1914. The battalion was to become the 16th Royal Scots and was the first to earn the &quot;footballer&#x27;s battalion&quot; sobriquet. The group of volunteers also contained some 500 Hearts supporters and ticket-holders, 150 followers of Hibernian and a number of professional footballers from Raith Rovers, Falkirk and Dunfermline.

Military training was thus added to the Hearts players football training regime, and the side had a 20-game unbeaten run between October and February. However, exhaustion from their army exertions, twice including 10-hour nocturnal-marches the night before a league game, eventually led to a drop in form, as several enlisted players missed key games. Defeats to St Mirren and Morton allowed Celtic to usurp the &quot;Maroons&quot; and eventually claim the league title by 4 points.

The war claimed the lives of seven first team players: Duncan Currie, John Allan, James Boyd, Tom Gracie, Ernest Ellis, James Speedie and Harry Wattie as well as former player David Philip.

There are two war memorials to mark this period; The McCrae&#x27;s Battalion Great War Memorial in Contalmaison and the Heart of Midlothian War Memorial in Haymarket, Edinburgh donated to the city by the club in 1922. The latter was placed in storage due to the Edinburgh Trams work but has now been replaced a little to the east of its previous position. A further memorial commemorating the 1914 Hearts team has been proposed by the club. An annual pilgrimage is held by football supporters to Contalmaison every year, whilst Hearts hold their memorial services at Haymarket or, whilst it was in storage, at Tynecastle Park.

=== Inter war years ===
Hearts collected no senior silverware in the inter war years. Tommy Walker joined the Hearts ground staff aged 16 in February 1932. As Scottish clubs could not then officially sign players until the age of 17, Walker played junior football for Linlithgow Rose until his birthday in May. A talented and elegant inside-forward, Walker quickly earned a place in the Hearts first team, helping the side to victory in the 1933 Jubilee edition of the Rosebery Charity Cup, in a season in which they finished 3rd in the league. He was a regular first team player by 1933–34 but despite some emphatic victories, inconsistent form limited Hearts to a sixth-place finish.

Despite Walker scoring 192 league goals for Hearts and playing in sides boasting numerous internationals, such as Scots Dave McCulloch, Barney Battles, Andy Anderson and Alex Massie, Welshman Freddie Warren and Irishman Willie Reid, Walker was destined not to win a major honour as a player at Tynecastle. The closest Hearts came to success during his period there was a second place league finish in 1937–38.

=== Tommy Walker&#x27;s managerial era ===
The first seeds of the Tommy Walker managerial success at Hearts were sown by Davie McLean. On 9 October 1948 after a mediocre start to the 1948–49 season, Hearts&#x27; manager McLean gave a competitive first team debut to 20 year old centre forward Willie Bauld and 19 year old inside left Jimmy Wardhaugh, and 22 year old inside right Alfie Conn Sr. had already broken through to the first team so this game marked the first time all three were deployed as a combined attacking force. They became dubbed the &quot;Terrible Trio&quot; and scored over 900 Hearts goals between them (Wardhaugh 376, Bauld 355, Conn 221). As a unit they played 242 games together. The combination of Wardhaugh&#x27;s dribbling skills and non-stop running, Bauld&#x27;s cerebral play and prodigious aerial ability, and Conn&#x27;s energetic, tenacious style and powerful shooting complemented each other well. Their first match as a forward combination ended in a 6–1 defeat of Scot Symon&#x27;s East Fife team of the era. This was notable as Symon&#x27;s team had defeated the &quot;Maroons&quot; 4–0 three weeks earlier.

A few weeks later in December 1948 Tommy Walker left during his third season at Chelsea to return to Hearts. He took the role of player-assistant to manager McLean. McLean&#x27;s intention was that Walker would be a steadying influence in a developing young team. However, after a single appearance at right-half in a 1–0 home defeat by Dundee, Walker retired to concentrate fully on learning the managerial ropes. Tangible progress was made in the League Championship in 1949–50 when Hearts finished third. As Tommy Walker had become more influential, McLean was co-opted to the Board on 16 March 1950.

McLean&#x27;s death on 14 February 1951 saw Walker promoted to the position of manager. Walker&#x27;s reign was to prove the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history. Walker was always quick to acknowledge the contribution made by McLean and his fatherly interest in the welfare and development of the players. The important foundations Walker inherited from McLean included the &quot;Terrible Trio&quot; forwards, the full back pair of Bobby Parker and Tam McKenzie and half backs Bobby Dougan and Davie Laing. To this established core John Cumming had recently broken through to the first team in the left half position he was to dominate for many years. Freddie Glidden was already at Tynecastle but yet to first team debut as was the then schoolboy Dave Mackay. Walker made Parker the team Captain.

Mackay&#x27;s key signing as a professional was under Walker in 1952 (initially part-time whilst also working as a joiner). Mackay&#x27;s pairing with Cumming at wing half was to become the nucleus of the team in the middle of the pitch. Mackay was a supremely talented all round player of ferocious tackling, endless running and sublime ball control. Cumming&#x27;s &quot;Iron Man&quot; nickname says much of his fearless determination. Despite his commitment he retained control of his temper and was never booked in his career. Cumming was the only player to collect medals for all seven of the trophies Hearts won under Walker. &quot;He never had a bad game. It was either a fairly good game or an excellent game,&quot; said Mackay later of his former teammate. Both went on to become full Scotland internationalists while playing for Hearts.

Bauld&#x27;s value to the team was underlined in 1952–53, when he missed eight vital league games through ankle injuries. Hearts were struggling, but with Bauld&#x27;s return to full fitness came a change in fortunes. From the bottom half of the league they surged up the table to finish in fourth place (as they had the two previous seasons). That resurgence also took them to a 1952–53 Scottish Cup semi final against Rangers before 116,262 fans at Hampden Park in Glasgow. Wardhaugh scored in the 2–1 defeat. Hearts were now though on an upward trajectory.

In 1953–54, Wardhaugh became the A Division&#x27;s top scorer with 27 goals as Hearts appeared set to win the League championship. However, on 13 March 1954 in the Scottish Cup quarter final 3–0 defeat away to Aberdeen, Parker broke his jaw, Conn injured his back, and Wardhaugh collected a serious shin bone injury. Dougan already had a lengthy knee injury meaning 9 November 1953 was his last competitive Hearts first team game (Dougan only subsequently played for Hearts in friendlies). Walker immediately tried Glidden to cover and he took over the centre half berth from Dougan. A stuttering end to their season saw Celtic overtake them. The young Mackay was given his first team debut on 7 November of that 1953–54 season one week before his nineteenth birthday. Naturally more left sided than right, Mackay played in the number six jersey normally associated with the absent Cumming. Mackay&#x27;s next two appearances though weren&#x27;t until mid March immediately after the Aberdeen cup defeat when again he played in Cumming&#x27;s position. It wasn&#x27;t until 17 April 1954 in a 1–0 win at Clyde that Walker first selected Mackay, Glidden and Cumming in the numbers four, five and six.

The team was boosted by the signing of Ian Crawford in August 1954. Mackay was given his extended place in the team in the 1954–55 season immediately after Laing&#x27;s 5 September transfer to Clyde. It was from this point that Walker settled on Mackay, Glidden and Cumming as his combination for the number four, five and six jerseys. They promptly became a trophy winning force lifting the first of seven trophies over nine seasons between 1954 and 1963. In October of the 1954–55 season they won their first trophy since 1906, 48 years before. They beat Motherwell 4–2 in the 1954 Scottish League Cup final. Bauld scored three and Wardhaugh scored one in the final giving the team their break through trophy. Hearts gained some recompense against Celtic from the season before by beating them home and away in that 1954–55 Scottish League Cup group stage.

After signing Alex Young and Bobby Kirk, Walker&#x27;s side proceeded to win the 1955–56 Scottish Cup. They thrashed Rangers 4–0 in the quarter-finals with goals from Crawford, Conn and a Bauld double. Cumming&#x27;s commitment to the team was typified in that 1956 Scottish Cup final before 132,840 fans. With blood streaming from a first half head injury from a clash with Celtic&#x27;s Willie Fernie he said, &quot;Blood doesn&#x27;t show on a maroon jersey&quot;. He returned to the playing field in the 3–1 win and was man of the match. That quote is now displayed above the entrance to the players tunnel at Tynecastle. Kirk could play in either full back role and played on the right in the final at the expense of Parker. Glidden lifted the trophy as Hearts captain in what he recalled as the &quot;sweetest&quot; moment in his footballing career.

Wardhaugh was the top tier&#x27;s leading scorer again that season. The scorers in the cup final win over Celtic were Crawford with two and one from Conn. Conn ended that 1955–56 season at the peak of his powers aged 29 with a career best 29 goals from 41 games. On 2 May 1956 two weeks after the cup win Conn became the third of the terrible trio to collect a full Scotland cap. At Hampden Park he put his side ahead after 12 minutes in a 1–1 draw with Austria. However the following September he suffered a broken jaw playing against Hibernian keeping him out until January. The days of the &quot;Terrible Trio&quot; as a combined force were nearing their end.

17 year old Gordon Marshall debuted in 1956 as did George Thomson in February 1957. Marshall, a future England under 23 internationalist, became a Hearts goalkeeping regular until 1963. Hearts led the Scottish League for most of the 1956–57 season. The title hinged on Rangers visit to Tynecastle on 13 April. A capacity crowd watched a tense game in which Rangers keeper, George Niven, was man of the match. Hearts could not beat him and the only goal came from Billy Simpson of Rangers who scored on the break in 35 minutes. Rangers had games in hand which they won to overtake Hearts and lift the trophy.

Walker completed the set of having won all three major Scottish football trophies with the League Championship in 1957–58. Conn suffered a serious ankle injury meaning he only played in five league games all season. Injury hit Conn left Hearts for Raith Rovers in September 1958 just two years after his 1956 zenith. He did so after 408 first team games and 221 goals. With an injury hit Bauld only playing nine times in the league title win a new Hearts attacking trio were dominant. For a third time Wardhaugh was the League&#x27;s top marksman with 28 strikes. This was one ahead of Jimmy Murray&#x27;s 27 and four more than Young&#x27;s 24. Mackay, now Captain, was fourth in Hearts&#x27; league scoring charts with 12. Hearts won that League title in 1957–58 with record-breaking points, goals scored and goal difference. Their record from 34 league games of 62 points out of a maximum possible 68 was 13 more than their nearest rival. They scored 132 goals (still the Scottish top tier record) with only 29 against for a record net difference of +103. This was Hearts&#x27; greatest ever league side. Murray and Mackay both played for Scotland at the 1958 FIFA World Cup where Murray scored in a 1–1 draw against Yugoslavia. Parker was a fringe player in the league winning season, his last season as a Hearts player. He moved to the club coaching staff before joining the Board of Directors where he also had a spell as chairman.

In the 1958–59 Scottish League Cup group stage Hearts eliminated Rangers. That October 1958 Scottish League Cup final was won with a heavy 5–1 defeat of Partick Thistle. Bauld and Murray each scored two and Johnny Hamilton netted one. Hearts defended their league title by being leaders in mid December. However a side visiting Ibrox missing injured Mackay were beaten 5–0 with all goals in the first 35 minutes. This put Rangers into top position in the table on goal average. This precipitated a run of only two wins from the next seven games without injured Mackay. Hearts beat Queen of the South in a 2–1 home league win on 7 March 1959. After that QoS game Rangers with six games to play were firm favourites for the title, six points ahead of second placed Hearts. Even if Hearts were to win their remaining seven games including a game in hand and beating Rangers in their visit Tynecastle in Rangers&#x27; penultimate game of the season, Rangers would still have to drop two points elsewhere and give away a superior goal average. The league game against QoS was Mackay&#x27;s last for Hearts after they accepted a bid of £32,000 from Tottenham Hotspur for their captain who was fit at this time despite having had lengthy spells out injured in the previous 12 months. Bobby Rankin was brought in to bolster the squad and scored twice in each of his first two games (both victories). On the penultimate Saturday of the league campaign goals by Cumming and Rankin at home to Rangers&lt;ref name=&quot;lhhttp://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/195904111.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; meant Hearts were four points behind with a game in hand. In midweek they next won 4–2 at Aberdeen with Rankin scoring a hat-trick. The last day of the season began with Rangers two points clear with an identical goal average to Hearts. Rangers thus needed a point to clinch the title but lost 2–1 at home to Aberdeen. Despite missing Bobby Kirk at right back with a knee injury, Rankin&#x27;s ninth goal from his fifth Hearts game had Hearts 1–0 up at half time at Celtic Park. Any victory would have given Hearts the title. Then Celtic&#x27;s Bertie Auld playing at left wing equalised before Eric Smith scored Celtic&#x27;s winning second goal to seal the title for their cross city rivals leaving those at Tynecastle to wonder what would have happened if Mackay hadn&#x27;t been sold when he was.

Mackay&#x27;s name as a club mainstay at half back was eventually taken over by Billy Higgins. That League Cup win was also Glidden&#x27;s last trophy as a recurring back injury that season numbered his playing days at Tynecastle. 36 year old MacKenzie left in 1959 as did Wardhaugh. He scored 206 goals in 304 league games and a total of 376 goals in 518 games for Hearts.

After collecting three Scottish championships and 19 full Scotland caps at Hibernian, Gordon Smith had a recurring ankle injury leading to his free transfer in 1959. Smith believed that an operation could cure the injury and paid for an operation on the offending ankle himself. He then signed for Hearts, his boyhood heroes. He enjoyed immediate success at Tynecastle, winning both the 1959 Scottish League Cup final and league title in his first season with the club. Hamilton scored for Hearts in that second successive League Cup Final and Young hit the winner. Third Lanark were beaten 2–1. 1960 ended with Walker being awarded the OBE for services to football.

The 1960s saw Hearts fortunes fluctuate as Walker attempted to adapt to football&#x27;s tactical changes by implementing a 4–2–4 formation. Young and Thomson departed for Everton in November 1960. At Everton Young was known as &quot;The Golden Vision&quot; and became another from the Walker production line of full Scotland internationalists. Smith had an injury hit season leading to his joining Dundee (who became the third club with whom he won the Scottish title). Hearts signed further future full internationalists in Willie Wallace and David Holt. Hearts lost the 1961 Scottish League Cup final after a replay. Cumming scored a deserved equalising penalty for Hearts in the first game 1–1 draw they largely dominated against the Scot Symon managed Rangers. Norrie Davidson scored a then equalising Hearts goal when they lost in the 3–1 replay defeat.

Bauld left Hearts in 1962 with 355 goals from 510 first team appearances. Another future internationalist, Willie Hamilton, joined for the run culminating in the 1962 Scottish League Cup final win. Hearts won the trophy for a fourth time with a 1–0 final win over Willie Waddell&#x27;s fine Kilmarnock side of that era. Davidson&#x27;s goal this time proved decisive. Like in the 1954–55 win Hearts eliminated Celtic in that 1962–63 Scottish League Cup group stage.

In 1964–65 Hearts fought out a championship title race with Waddell&#x27;s Kilmarnock. In the era of two points for a win Hearts were three points clear with two games remaining. Hearts drew with Dundee United meaning the last game of the season with the two title challengers playing each other at Tynecastle would be a league decider. Kilmarnock needed to win by a two-goal margin to take the title. Hearts entered the game as favourites with both a statistical and home advantage. They also had a solid pedigree of trophy winning under Walker. Waddell&#x27;s Kilmarnock in contrast had been nearly men. Four times in the previous five seasons they had finished league runners-up including Hearts’ triumph in 1960. Killie had also lost three domestic cup finals during the same period including the 1962 League Cup Final defeat to Hearts. Hearts had won five of the six senior cup finals they played in under Walker. Even the final they had lost was in a replay after drawing the first game. Hearts&#x27; Roald Jensen hit the post after six minutes. Kilmarnock then scored twice through Davie Sneddon and Brian McIlroy after 27 and 29 minutes. Alan Gordon had an excellent chance to clinch the title for Hearts in second half injury time but was denied by a Bobby Ferguson diving save pushing the ball past the post. The 2–0 defeat meant Hearts lost the title by an average of 0.042 goals. Subsequently, Hearts were instrumental in pushing through a change to use goal difference to separate teams level on points. Ironically this rule change later denied Hearts the title in 1985–86.

Following a slump in results, Walker resigned in September 1966. Under his management Hearts had won 7 senior trophies and been runners up in five others. Cumming left the playing staff a year later and joined the coaching team.

=== Latter 20th century ===
The highlight of the late 60s was the run to the 1968 Scottish Cup Final when they lost 3–1 to George Farm&#x27;s Dunfermline Athletic. The players of greatest note in the late sixties were Jim Cruickshank, Alan Anderson and Donald Ford with Drew Busby joining the three in the 1970s. The high point of the 1970s was another run to the Scottish Cup Final. In 1975–76 they again lost 3–1 in the final this time to Rangers. After the advent of the ten team Premier Division in 1975, Hearts were subsequently relegated for the first time in 1977. This began a sequence of yo-yoing between the Premier League and First Division six times in seven seasons.

On 25 May 1981, 34-year-old Wallace Mercer became chairman after buying a controlling interest in Hearts for £265,000. Hearts had just been relegated from the top flight for the third time in five seasons. The following December (1981), Mercer promoted Alex MacDonald to be Player-Manager. At the end of the 1982–83 season, Hearts were promoted back to the top flight. This marked an upturn in their fortunes to rejoin the more competitive clubs in Scotland&#x27;s top flight. The 1985–86 season was their best since 1965. The league campaign started with the loss of five of the first eight games. From there the club went on a 27-game unbeaten league run, reaching the top of the league on 21 December after a 1–0 win at St Mirren.

Hearts needed a draw from the last game of the season away to Dundee on 3 May 1986 to win the Scottish league title. Before that final game they were two points ahead of Celtic and with a superior goal difference of four goals. However, this strong statistical position was undermined in the run up to the game when several players in the Hearts squad were hit by a viral infection. Craig Levein failed to recover to make the game in Dundee. Celtic were 4–0 up away at St Mirren at half time in their final fixture. Thus, at half time the players knew that they would have to deliver a result at Dens Park. Substitute Albert Kidd forced Hearts to concede a corner kick with seven minutes remaining. The in-swinging corner was touched on and fell to Kidd who put Dundee ahead. This was the first goal Hearts had conceded from a corner all season. Hearts now needed an equaliser to win the title. However, Kidd went on a run with the ball from the halfway line down the right wing beating two Hearts players. After then playing a one-two with a teammate on the edge of the Hearts box he finished to score a second with four minutes left. Dundee won 2–0. This combined with Celtic winning 5–0 against St Mirren meant the top two clubs finished the season on the same number of points. Hearts lost out to Celtic by a goal difference of three. Had goal difference been the rule in 1965 Hearts would have been champions; had goal average still applied in 1986, they would have won the league. Hearts lobbying after the league loss in 1965 cost them the title in 1986.

Hearts had been chasing a League and Scottish Cup double. After eliminating Rangers and Jim McLean&#x27;s Dundee United they faced Alex Ferguson&#x27;s Aberdeen in the final; Aberdeen won 3–0 meaning Hearts finished runners-up as they had in the league.

Hearts finished league runners-up again in 1988 and 1992. The club reached the quarter-finals of the 1988–89 UEFA Cup losing out to Bayern Munich 2–1 on aggregate. After MacDonald&#x27;s summer 1990 departure the club struggled to settle on a manager. Within a two-year period, Joe Jordan, Sandy Clark and Tommy McLean were all sacked. From April 1989 to April 1994, Hearts went on a run of 22 games in a row without defeat against arch-rivals Hibernian in the Edinburgh derby.

In 1994 Mercer sold his shares in Hearts to Chris Robinson and Leslie Deans. Under Mercer, Hearts finished second in the Scottish top tier three times and once in the Scottish Cup, but his time at the helm concluded without senior silverware. His personal influence at the club is perhaps best remembered with an attempted merger with Hibs in 1990. Seen by Hibs fans as an attempted take over to liquidate their club, Mercer&#x27;s attempts were met with bitterness and acrimony before he backed away.

In 1998, Hearts beat Rangers 2–1 to lift the Scottish Cup under the management of ex Hearts player, Jim Jefferies. Colin Cameron scored a first-minute penalty and Stéphane Adam added after half time. This was Hearts&#x27; first senior trophy win since the 1962–63 Scottish League Cup won in the Tommy Walker era.

=== Into the 21st century ===
Hearts finished third in 2003 and 2004, and reached the inaugural group stages of the UEFA Cup in 2004–05, but finished bottom of their group, despite Robbie Neilson&#x27;s goal giving a 2–1 victory over FC Basel. During the 2004–05 season, they finished fifth in the league.

In 2004, then club CEO Chris Robinson announced plans to sell Tynecastle, which he claimed was &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;, and instead have Hearts rent Murrayfield from the Scottish Rugby Union. This move was deemed necessary due to the club&#x27;s increasingly large debt. The plan was very unpopular with supporters, and a campaign, entitled &quot;Save Our Hearts&quot;, was set up to try to block the move. As Robinson and his supporters had a slight majority of the club&#x27;s shares, a preliminary deal to sell the stadium was struck with the Cala property development company for just over £20 million.

=== The Romanov era ===

In August 2004 the midst of Hearts&#x27; financial difficulties Russian-Lithuanian multi-millionaire Vladimir Romanov entered into talks to take over Hearts in what was dubbed the &quot;Romanov Revolution&quot;. Romanov had already made failed attempts to purchase Dundee United, Dundee and Dunfermline. Romanov offered the prospect of the club staying at a redeveloped Tynecastle, which was very attractive to Hearts supporters. At the end of September 2004 Chris Robinson agreed to sell his 19.6% stake to Romanov. Romanov called an extraordinary general meeting in January 2005 so that the club could pass a motion to exercise the escape clause in the deal with Cala Homes. The backing of Leslie Deans and the McGrail brothers meant that the motion was passed with over 70% support. The sale of Robinson&#x27;s shares was completed on 2 February 2005 after Romanov made financial guarantees that the club could continue to trade without selling Tynecastle. This sale increased Romanov&#x27;s stake to 29.9%, giving him effective control of the club. Romanov&#x27;s takeover was welcomed by a fans&#x27; representative. Romanov increased his shareholding in Hearts to 55.5% on 21 October 2005, and offered to buy the rest of the shares. Chairman George Foulkes sold his shares to Romanov and encouraged others to do likewise. Romanov eventually increased his majority share in Hearts to 82%.

Romanov&#x27;s management of the club&#x27;s debt became a cause for concern. During his takeover Romanov pledged to eradicate the club&#x27;s debt. Soon after the takeover was completed, the debt was transferred from HBOS and SMG to the financial institutions controlled by Romanov, Ūkio bankas and UBIG. At the end of July 2007 the club were £36M in debt. On 7 July 2008, Hearts issued a statement that stated the club would issue debt for equity to reduce the debt by £12M. A further issue was completed in 2010. Since the takeover Hearts had failed to pay players wages on time on several occasions, and were threatened with administration twice due to failure to pay an outstanding tax bills with the bill finally being settled in August 2011. Results released for the financial year ending 31 July 2010 showed that Hearts had made a small profit for the first time since 1999, although they were still heavily in debt.

Hearts&#x27; first manager of the Romanov era was George Burley, who was appointed during close season by new chief executive Phil Anderton, who replaced Chris Robinson as chief executive. With their new manager and signings, Hearts got off to a tremendous start in the 2005–06 season. The team won their first eight league matches, equalling a club record set in 1914. Romanov shocked Scottish football by sacking George Burley on the following day whilst Hearts were sitting top of the SPL table; Hearts ultimately finished second. Hearts fans were led to expect a &quot;top class manager&quot; would replace Burley. Kevin Keegan, Bobby Robson, Claudio Ranieri and Ottmar Hitzfeld were all linked with the vacancy. Anderton, who had been making the approaches for these coaches, was sacked by Romanov on 31 October 2005. Foulkes, who had helped to bring Romanov to the club in the first place, resigned in protest at Anderton&#x27;s dismissal. Romanov replaced both of them with his son, Roman Romanov. This proved to be a feature of his time at the club, going through nine permanent managers in seven years. The next managerial change after those came on 1 August 2011 when Jim Jefferies was sacked during his second spell at the club and replaced by former Sporting CP boss Paulo Sérgio.

Romanov stated that his ultimate aim was for Hearts to win the Champions League. Hearts competed in the Champions League during season 2006–07 but progressed only as far the second qualifying round before dropping down to the UEFA Cup. Since then Hearts have been unable to split the Old Firm for a second time to earn a Champions League place. Hearts target became finishing third or above in the SPL.

Romanov also owned the Lithuanian club FBK Kaunas and Belarusian club FC Partizan Minsk. Several players were loaned by FBK Kaunas to Hearts when Romanov acquired control of the club.

The club began experiencing severe financial problems in November 2011, which meant they were unable to pay the players&#x27; wages, and the club was put up for sale. The squad&#x27;s October salaries were late and the November wages were paid twenty-nine days late, just one day before their December salaries were due. The December pay failed to arrive on time, and a complaint was lodged with the Scottish Premier League by the players&#x27; union. During this period the club advised fringe players they were free to leave the club. On 4 January 2012 the SPL ordered Hearts to pay all outstanding wages by 11 January 2012 and insisted that January&#x27;s wages had to be paid on time on 16 January. Hearts paid all outstanding wages that day following the sale of Eggert Jónsson to Wolves. On 17 January, the day after Hearts&#x27; wages were due to be paid, it was revealed all players had been paid. Despite this, the SPL issued a statement saying Hearts had failed to pay all players on 16 January and an emergency board meeting had been called; Hearts refuted this, saying payment of the remuneration had been made to all players.
On 7 November 2012, Hearts were issued with a winding-up order by the Court of Session in Edinburgh after failing to pay a tax bill on time.

In early June 2013, during the close season, a Hearts media statement stated that they would need to raise £500,000 in capital to keep the club up and running during the break between seasons. With no match day income coming in and a lack of finance from owner Romanov, the club were left in a position where they had to put their whole squad up for sale.

On 17 June 2013, Heart of Midlothian began the process of entering into administration with debts of £25 million, owing recently bankrupt Ūkio bankas £15 million.

On 18 June 2013, a Scandinavian consortium offered to pay the club £500,000 immediately in return for a share of any future transfer income from up to 12 players; this was rejected by Hearts. The process of entering administration began on 19 June 2013 when the club&#x27;s parent company, Ukio Bankas Investment Group (UBIG), filed papers at the Court of Session on Edinburgh for accountancy firm BDO to be named as administrators.

===Administration===
On 17 June 2013 Hearts announced that they had lodged court papers stating their intention to enter administration, and on 19 June 2013 the administrators BDO were appointed to run the club. This meant that the club was unable to register players over 21 until February 2014 at the earliest. As long as they were still in administration they would not be able to bring in players of any age.

As well as the signing embargo, Hearts were to be deducted a third of the previous season&#x27;s points tally which meant the club would start the 2013–2014 season with −15 points. During this period the BDO administrator Trevor Birch pleaded with Hearts fans to purchase season tickets and stated that they needed to sell at least another 3000 season tickets to raise another £800,000 to keep the club running and avoiding liquidation. The fans met this number and took total season ticket sales beyond the 10,000 mark, giving the club more survival time.
A deadline of 12 July 2013 was set for interested parties to put in formal bids for the club; there were three bids entered for the club which were received from the supporters group &quot;The Foundation of Hearts&quot;, the second from a new company called &quot;HMFC limited&quot; which was backed by American firm Club Sports 9 and a third from former Livingston FC owner Angelo Massone through Five Star Football Limited.

On 15 August 2013, &quot;The Foundation of Hearts&quot; were given preferred bidders status to make a CVA with Hearts&#x27; creditors. The money that the foundation used to purchase the club came from monthly donations from fans; the foundation received an interest-free loan from a wealthy fan, which was to be paid back using the monthly direct debts from the fans. On 2 December, Hearts&#x27; creditors agreed to the CVA deal proposed by &quot;The Foundation of Hearts&quot;.

The club&#x27;s relegation from the Scottish Premiership was confirmed on 5 April 2014. Hearts won 4–2 away to Partick Thistle, but St Mirren beat Motherwell 3–2, making it impossible for Hearts to catch up.

On Monday 12 May 2014, The Ann Budge fronted Bidco 1874 took control of Heart of Midlothian Plc, thus bringing to an end to Vladimir Romanov&#x27;s involvement with the club. Budge, who fronted and financed the Bidco 1874 group which took over the reins at the club, became an unpaid executive chairwoman of the club. The Bidco group planned to hold the club for a possible five years, before the fans backed Foundation of Hearts supporters group take control. The Foundation put in £1 million for the running of the club until the final legal exit of administration. The Foundation then paid a further £2.6 million (£2.5m to cover the loan given by Bidco1874 Ltd to Hearts to finance the Creditors&#x27; Voluntary Agreement + £100,000 for the shares) to take 75% of the shares in the club and with that the running and decision making within the club. In addition, the Foundation also committed itself to provide a further £2.8m (£1.4m per year for two years) working capital for the club. Funding for the deal came from 8000+ people donating cash via a monthly direct debit.

The club officially exited administration on 11 June 2014, also bringing to an end the signing embargo that had been imposed upon the club a year earlier.

=== Post administration ===
Hearts earned an immediate return to the Scottish Premiership by clinching the 2014–15 Scottish Championship title with seven games remaining. Hearts remained undefeated for the first 20 league matches before a 3–2 home defeat to Falkirk ended that run. They won the title, winning 29 of 36 games, scoring 96 goals, conceding just 26 goals with a points total of 91. They finished the season 21 points ahead nearest challengers city-rivals Hibernian and 24 points ahead of third placed Rangers. The season included handing Cowdenbeath a joint club record defeat 10–0. At the PFA Scotland Awards, Hearts had six players named in Championship Team of the Year, two Young Player of the Year nominees, three Championship Player of the Year nominees, and Neilson shortlisted for Manager of the Year.

This period of renewed stability unravelled in the years following 2015. Despite finishing as runners up in the 2019 Scottish Cup final, the club could only achieve mid-table placings in 2017, 2018 and 2019. This decline took a turn for the worse in 2019–20, and Hearts were relegated after finishing bottom of the Scottish Premiership, having won only four matches across the course of the season (which had been truncated due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Their relegation was confirmed in June 2020, after league reconstruction talks instigated by Budge collapsed. The club confirmed that they would be pursuing legal action against the SPFL following their demotion to the Scottish Championship. The legal action failed, as a Scottish Football Association arbitration panel ruled that the SPFL had acted within its powers.

Robbie Neilson was appointed as Hearts manager for a second time in June 2020, signing a three-year deal. Former manager Jim Jefferies was recruited as an advisor to the board and manager in July. In August 2020, Andrew McKinlay was appointed as the club&#x27;s new Chief Executive. In June 2021, club captain Steven Naismith announced his retirement from football, taking up the role of Football Development Manager, focusing on the development of youth players &quot;making their way towards the first team&quot;.

On 30 August 2021, Ann Budge officially transferred the club&#x27;s shares to the Foundation of Hearts, meaning Hearts officially became the biggest fan owned club in the United Kingdom.

Hearts won the 2020–21 Scottish Championship, finishing ahead of second-placed Dundee by 12 points. This confirmed their return to the Scottish Premiership. In their first season back in the top flight, Hearts finished third and secured European group stage football in the UEFA Conference League. The following season, 2022–23, Hearts secured a fourth-placed finish. After finishing third in the 2023–24 season they returned to European football – initially entering the UEFA Europa League final play-off stage, however they failed to advance and dropped into the UEFA Conference League league stage. After gaining a single point in their first six league games (the worst start to a season in the club&#x27;s history), manager Steven Naismith was sacked on 22 September 2024, with Neil Critchley replacing him as head coach a month later.

== Colours and badge ==

The original Hearts football strip was all white shirts and trousers with maroon trimmings, and a heart sewn onto the chest. For one season they played in red, white and blue stripes. These were the colours of a club called St. Andrew, who had taken their name and colours from the University of St Andrews, that Hearts had absorbed. Since then the predominant club colours have been maroon and white. The strip typically has a maroon top and a white collar, although the strip was predominantly white in the 2010–11 season. The shorts are normally white, although maroon was used in the 2008–09 season. The socks are normally maroon with some white detail.

Hearts&#x27; current home kit is all maroon.

The badge is a heart, based on the Heart of Midlothian mosaic on the Royal Mile. There is a tradition to spit on the mosaic when passing, harking back to the days when the city gaol stood there.

For the 2014–15 season the club chose to commemorate 100 years since McCrae&#x27;s Battalion with not only a commemorative strip, of maroon shirt, white shorts and black socks, but with a commemorative badge as well. The club chose to have no sponsor on the home top as a mark of respect to those who had joined the regiment.

== Stadium ==

Hearts initially played at The Meadows, Powburn and Powderhall before moving to the Gorgie area in 1881. In 1886, they moved to their current site, Tynecastle Park, named for the Tynecastle Tollhouse at the entrance to the grounds of Merchiston. The stadium has hosted nine full Scotland international matches. 

For most of the 20th century, Tynecastle was a mostly terraced ground, with a seated main stand that was designed by Archibald Leitch and opened in 1919. The terraced sections were replaced by the Gorgie, Wheatfield and Roseburn Stands in the mid-1990s, making Tynecastle an all-seated stadium. In 2017, the main stand was demolished and replaced by a brand new stand which increased the ground&#x27;s capacity to 20,099. While this work was undertaken, Hearts played some of their home league matches at the nearby Murrayfield Stadium.

Hearts have a traditional local rivalry in Edinburgh with Hibs; the Edinburgh derby match between the two clubs is one of the oldest rivalries in world football. Graham Spiers has described it as &quot;one of the jewels of the Scottish game&quot;. The clubs first met on Christmas Day 1875, when Hearts won 1–0, in the first match ever contested by Hibs. The two clubs became distinguished in Edinburgh after a five-game struggle for the Edinburgh Football Association Cup in 1878, which Hearts finally won with a 3–2 victory after four successive draws. The clubs have met twice in a Cup Final, in the 1896 Scottish Cup final, which Hearts won 3–1 and the 2012 Scottish Cup final which Hearts won 5–1. The 1896 final is also notable for being the only Scottish Cup Final to be played outside Glasgow.

Hearts have the better record in derbies. Approximately half of all derbies have been played in local competitions and friendlies. Hibs recorded the biggest derby win in a competitive match when they won 7–0 at Tynecastle on New Year&#x27;s Day 1973.

While it has been noted that religious, ethnic or political background lies behind the rivalry, that aspect has been described as minor in relation to the sectarianism in Glasgow. In practice geography has been the main factor in establishing the support bases of the Edinburgh rivals: support for Hibs has always been founded in Leith and the surrounding areas in the north and east of the city, whereas the rest of Edinburgh has tended towards Hearts. Although the clubs are inescapable rivals, the rivalry is mainly &quot;good-natured&quot; and has had beneficial effects due to the demographic diversities; considering both of the clubs&#x27; territories have a variety of neighbourhoods that differ economically, politically, denominationally, or all three at once.

== Supporters and culture ==
Heart of Midlothian are one of two full-time professional football clubs in Edinburgh. Hearts&#x27; average attendance during the 2022–23 season was 18,525. Important matches (particularly the Edinburgh derby, European fixtures, and games against the Old Firm) always see Tynecastle at or very close to full capacity.

=== Songs and chants ===
&quot;The Hearts Song&quot; was written and performed by Scottish comedian Hector Nicol, a St Mirren fan. A new modernised version of &quot;The Hearts Song&quot;, performed by Colin Chisholm and the Glasgow Branch, has been played before matches at Tynecastle in recent seasons, though the original version returned for the 2019–20 season. In the 2020–21 season the modern version once again replaced the old version.

The folk anthem &quot;There Will Always Be Heart of Midlothian&quot; by Neil Grant has been played regularly at Tynecastle Park since 2018. At the request of the Foundation of Hearts, Neil performed the rousing track live at Tynecastle during the Ladbrokes Premiership match against St Johnstone on 26 January 2019. The track gained additional exposure after being played on the BBC&#x27;s popular &quot;Off the Ball&quot; radio series.

=== In popular culture ===
Celebrity fans of Hearts include Stephen Hendry, Ronnie Corbett, Ken Stott, Alex Salmond, Sir Chris Hoy, Wattie Buchan, Eilidh Doyle, Lee McGregor, Andrew Oldcorn, Gavin Hastings, Martin Geissler, Nicky Campbell, Tom Wilson, Grant Hutchison and Scott Hutchison.

Grove Street and the Ballas, two rival gangs in the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, dress in green and maroon clothes respectively. Since &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; developer Rockstar North is based in Edinburgh, fans believe this to be a reference to Hearts and their Edinburgh derby rivals Hibernian. 

Hearts were featured in the American comedy-drama series &quot;Succession&quot; (in the episodes &quot;Dundee&quot; and &quot;DC&quot;) as part of a storyline in which Roman Roy buys the team to impress his Scottish-born billionaire father Logan Roy, only to discover that Logan actually supports Hearts&#x27; rivals Hibernian.

In the 2022 film &quot;Aftersun&quot;, Sophie (Frankie Corio) can be seen wearing a 1998–99 Hearts shirt on more than one occasion.

<doc id="302214" wikidata="Q1115913" url="?curid=302214" title="Commodore 16">
<text>The Commodore 16 is a home computer made by Commodore International with a 6502-compatible 7501 or 8501 CPU, released in 1984 and intended to be an entry-level computer to replace the VIC-20. A cost-reduced version, the Commodore 116, was mostly sold in Europe.

The C16 and C116 belong to the same family as the higher-end Plus/4 and are internally very similar to it (albeit with less RAM – 16 KB rather than 64 KB – and lacking the Plus/4&#x27;s user port and Three-Plus-One software). Software is generally compatible among all three provided it can fit within the C16&#x27;s smaller RAM and does not utilize the user port on the Plus/4.

While the C16 was a failure on the US market, it enjoyed some success in certain European countries and Mexico.

==Intention==
The C16 was intended to compete with other sub-$100 computers from Timex Corporation, Mattel, and Texas Instruments (TI). Timex&#x27;s and Mattel&#x27;s computers were less expensive than the VIC-20, and although the VIC-20 offered better expandability, a full-travel keyboard, and in some cases more memory, the C16 offered a chance to improve upon those advantages. The TI-99/4A was priced in-between Commodore&#x27;s VIC-20 and Commodore 64, and is somewhat between them in capability, but TI was lowering its prices. On paper, the C16 was a closer match for the TI-99/4A than the aging VIC-20.

Commodore president Jack Tramiel feared that one or more Japanese companies would introduce a consumer-oriented computer and undercut everyone&#x27;s prices. Although Japanese companies would soon dominate the U.S. video game console market, their feared dominance of the home computer field never materialized. Additionally, Timex, Mattel, and TI departed the computer market before the C16 was released.

==Description==
Outwardly the C16 resembles the VIC-20 and the Commodore 64, but with a dark-gray or dark-brown case and light-gray keys. The keyboard layout differs slightly from the earlier models, adding an escape key and four cursor keys replacing the shifted-key arrangement the C-64 and VIC inherited from the PET series. The C16 is in some respects faster than the Commodore 64 and VIC-20; the processor runs at a speed roughly 75% faster, and the BASIC interpreter contains dedicated graphics commands, making drawing images considerably faster.

The system was designed around the TED chip which included NTSC and PAL video, sound and DRAM refresh functionality. Though according to the designer it &quot;was supposed to be as close to a single-chip computer as we could get in the 1980s,&quot; the CPU, RAM, ROM and some glue logic were still on their own separate chips. (This was considerably less integrated than microcontrollers of the day, but those did not generally offer video and sound functionality.)

The C16 has 16 KB of RAM with 12 KB available to its built-in BASIC interpreter. The TED chip offered a palette of 121 colors, which was considerably more than the 16 colors available on the Commodore 64&#x27;s VIC-II video chip, but it lacked the VIC-II&#x27;s sprites and the sound capabilities were not as advanced as the SID also used in the Commodore 64.

From a practical user&#x27;s point of view, three tangible features the C16 lacks are a modem port and VIC-20/C64-compatible Datasette and game ports. Commodore sold a C16-family-specific Datassette (the Commodore 1531) and joysticks, but the pins are identical to those used on the Commodore 64, so can be used with a simple adapter, in fact Commodore themselves sold Commodore 16 models with C2N datasettes designed for the Commodore 64 with adapters after the initial production run. The reason for changing the joystick ports was to reduce size. The C16&#x27;s serial port (Commodore&#x27;s proprietary &quot;serial CBM-488 bus&quot;, was a variation of the Commodore PET IEEE interface as used on the VIC-20 and Commodore 64, which meant that printers and disk drives were interchangeable with the older machines. As it was a serial interface, modems could be connected with a suitable interface. Partially for cost reasons, the user port, designed for modems and other devices, was omitted from the C16 (although the connections for it were still present on the system board). Despite costing less than the Plus/4, the C16&#x27;s keyboard was higher quality and easier to type on.



The Commodore 16 is one of three computers in its family. The even-less-successful Commodore 116 is functionally and technically similar but was shipped in a smaller case with a rubber chiclet keyboard and was only available in Europe. The family&#x27;s flagship, the Commodore Plus/4, was shipped in a similar case but has a 59-key full-travel keyboard (with a specifically advertised &quot;cursor key diamond&quot; of four keys, contrasted with the VIC-20&#x27;s and C64&#x27;s two + shift key scheme inherited from the PET), 64 KB of RAM, a modem port, and built-in entry-level office suite software. Although shipped with 16K from the factory, it was possible to modify the C16 for 64K, making it able to run any Plus/4 software except applications that required the user port or built-in programs.

Hardware designer Bil Herd notes that the C116 is the original member of this family of computers and is the original vision as imparted by Jack Tramiel to the engineering department. It was designed to sell for $49 to $79. The C16 and the Plus/4 came later and were mostly driven by the company trying to figure out what to do with the new computer family after Tramiel&#x27;s departure from Commodore. 

In an early stage of development of the C16, Commodore was planning to have single-layer PCBs built in as an attempt of cost reducing, with the manufacturing cost of such a PCB being around $12. But these plans were later discarded possibly due to technical problems. It was the first and only attempt of Commodore using single-layer PCBs inside their computers, and only one such PCB is known to be preserved.

==Market performance==
The C16 was a major failure in the U.S. and was discontinued within a year, but it sold reasonably well in Europe as a low-end game machine (over 90% of all C16 software was produced by European developers) and in Mexico as well.

The C16&#x27;s failure in the US market was likely due to a lack of software support, incompatibility with the C64, and lack of importance to Commodore after its competitors withdrew from the market.

A total of 1 million Plus/4s, C16s, and C116s were sold, with the latter two accounting for about 60% of its total volume.

Beginning in 1986, remaining C16, C116 and Plus/4 inventories were sold at a much-reduced price on the Eastern Bloc market, chiefly Hungary. Hungary did not produce any home computers at the time, the Soviet and Bulgarian models were far too expensive for most Hungarians while the East German models were not for sale to private parties, and most Western models were completely unavailable. Thus, this move by Commodore was the first chance for many people in Hungary to own a computer at all. It created a fanbase that lasted well into the 1990s and that contributed several unofficial ports of popular Commodore 64 programs.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, the C16 was sold as a beginner&#x27;s computer from early 1985 to 1992. Aurrerá supermarkets distributed them with Grupo Sigma S.A., a local distributor of Commodore USA. The computer was marketed as &quot;Sigma-Commodore 16&quot; (all other Commodore computers sold in Mexico had the same moniker). Basically, this model is the same as the American/European C16; as it doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;Ñ&quot; key needed for writing the Spanish language, the only difference is the custom label.

Aurrera Supermarket also sold software, peripherals and books about to how to program Commodore Computers. All this merchandise was displayed in special modules at the electronics department called &quot;El Universo de la Computación&quot; (The Universe of the Computer Science). The success of Commodore in Mexico was in granted by the fact that Aurrera Supermarket let anyone test the machines in store, so people gathered to play games and exchange programs in unofficial computer clubs.

At least four annual software writing contests were held sponsored by Aurrera Supermarket, Grupo Sigma and Commodore between 1985 and 1989. These contests had entries for programming, custom hardware and computer graphics for the C16, C64, C128 and Amiga. Prizes included money, Commodore software and hardware and the right to have the software published by Grupo Sigma for the local market. The contest winners had limited sales restricted only to Mexico, so the resulting original software is almost impossible to find.

Grupo Sigma stopped supporting the brand in mid-1993, in favor of the growing (and more profitable) IBM PC compatible market.

<doc id="302218" wikidata="Q101761" url="?curid=302218" title="Zipper">
<text>A zipper (N. America), zip, zip fastener (UK), formerly known as a clasp locker, is a commonly used device for binding together two edges of fabric or other flexible material. Used in clothing (e.g. jackets and jeans), luggage and other bags, camping gear (e.g. tents and sleeping bags), and many other items, zippers come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and colors. In 1892, Whitcomb L. Judson, an American inventor from Chicago, patented the original design from which the modern device evolved.

The zipper gets its name from a brand of rubber boots (or galoshes) it was used on in 1923. The galoshes could be fastened with a single zip of the hand, and soon the hookless fasteners came to be called &quot;Zippers&quot;.

==Description==
A zipper consists of a slider mounted on two rows of metal or plastic teeth that are designed to interlock and thereby join the material to which the rows are attached. The slider, usually operated by hand, contains a Y-shaped channel that, by moving along the rows of teeth, meshes or separates them, depending on the direction of the slider&#x27;s movement. The teeth may be individually discrete or shaped from a continuous coil, and are also referred to as &quot;elements&quot;. The word &quot;zipper&quot; is onomatopoetic, as the device makes a high-pitched &quot;zip&quot; when used&quot;.&quot;

In many jackets and similar garments, the opening is closed completely when the slider is at the top end. 
Some jackets have double-separating zippers with two sliders on the tape. When the sliders are on opposite ends of the tape, the jacket is closed. If the lower slider is raised then the bottom part of the jacket may be opened to allow more comfortable sitting or bicycling. When both sliders are lowered then the zipper may be totally separated. 

Bags, suitcases and other pieces of luggage also often feature two sliders on the tape: the part of the zipper between them is unfastened. When the two sliders are located next to each other, which can be at any point along the tape, the zipper is fully closed.

Zippers may:
* increase or decrease the size of an opening to allow or restrict the passage of objects, as in the fly of trousers or in a pocket;
* join or separate two ends or sides of a single garment, as in the front of a jacket, or on the front, back or side of a dress or skirt to facilitate dressing;
* attach or detach a separable part of the garment to or from another, as in the conversion between trousers and shorts or the connection or disconnection of a hood and a coat;
* attach or detach a small pouch or bag to or from a larger one. One example of this is military rucksacks, which have smaller pouches or bags attached to the sides using one or two zippers;
* be used to decorate an item.

These variations are achieved by sewing one end of the zipper together, sewing both ends together, or allowing both ends of the zipper to fall completely apart.

A zipper costs relatively little, but if it fails, the garment may be unusable until the zipper is repaired or replaced—which can be quite difficult and expensive. Problems often lie with the zipper slider; when it becomes worn it does not properly align and join the alternating teeth. With separating zippers, the insertion pin may tear loose from the tape; the tape may even disintegrate from use. If a zipper fails, it can either jam (i.e. get stuck) or partially break off.

==History==
In 1851, John Sallow received a patent for an &quot;Improvement in Fastenings for Garments&quot;. He did not try seriously to market it, thus missing the recognition that he might otherwise have received. Howe&#x27;s device was more like an elaborate drawstring than a true slide fastener.

Forty-two years later, in 1893, Whitcomb L. Judson, who invented a pneumatic street railway, patented a &quot;Shoe-Fastening&quot;. The device served as a (more complicated) hook-and-eye shoe fastener. With the support of businessman Colonel Lewis Walker, Judson launched the Universal Fastener Company to manufacture the new device. Judson&#x27;s &quot;clasp locker&quot; had its public debut at the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair and met with little commercial success. Judson is sometimes given credit as the inventor of the zipper, but his device was not used in clothing.

The Universal Fastener Company moved to Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1901, reorganized as the Fastener Manufacturing and Machine Company. Gideon Sundbäck, a Swedish-American electrical engineer, was hired to work for the company in 1906. Good technical skills and marriage to the plant manager&#x27;s daughter, Elvira Aronson, led Sundbäck to the position of head designer. The company moved to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where it operated for most of the 20th century under the name Talon, Inc. Sundbäck worked on improving the fastener, and, in 1909, he registered a patent in Germany. The US rights to this invention were on the name of the Meadville company (operating as the Hookless Fastener Co.), but Sundbäck retained non-U.S. rights and used these in subsequent years to set up Lightning Fastener Co. in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. Sundbäck&#x27;s work with this firm has led to the common misperception that he was Canadian and that the zipper originated in that country.

In 1916, newspapers in Australia reported displays of the &quot;new hookless fastener&quot;, a device from America that &quot;the world has been waiting for&quot; by a live model in the store window of Raynor&#x27;s of Melbourne.

Gideon Sundbäck increased the number of fastening elements from four per inch (about one every 6.4 mm) to ten or eleven (around every 2.5 mm), introduced two facing rows of teeth that pulled into a single piece by the slider and increased the opening for the teeth guided by the slider. The patent for the &quot;Separable Fastener&quot; was issued in 1917. Gideon Sundbäck also created the manufacturing machine for the new device. The &quot;S-L&quot; or &quot;strapless&quot; machine took a special Y-shaped wire and cut scoops from it, then punched the scoop dimple and nib, and clamped each scoop on a cloth tape to produce a continuous zipper chain. Within the first year of operation, Sundbäck&#x27;s machinery was producing a few hundred feet (around 100 meters) of fastener per day. In March of the same year, Mathieu Burri, a Swiss inventor, improved the design by adding a lock-in system attached to the last teeth, but his version never got into production due to conflicting patents.

In 1923, during a trip to Europe, Sundbäck sold his European rights to Martin Othmar Winterhalter, who improved the design by using ribs and grooves instead of Sundbäck&#x27;s joints and jaws and started producing with his company Riri on a large scale first in Germany, then in Switzerland.
The popular North American term &quot;zipper&quot; (UK &quot;zip&quot;, or occasionally &quot;zip-fastener&quot;) came from the B. F. Goodrich Company in 1923. The company used Gideon Sundbäck&#x27;s fastener on a new type of rubber boots (or galoshes) and referred to it as the zipper, and the name stuck. The two chief uses of the zipper in its early years were for closing boots and tobacco pouches. Zippers began being used for clothing in 1925 by Schott NYC on leather jackets.

In the 1930s, a sales campaign began for children&#x27;s clothing featuring zippers. The campaign praised zippers for promoting self-reliance in young children by making it possible for them to dress themselves. The zipper beat the button in 1937 in the &quot;Battle of the Fly&quot;, after French fashion designers raved over zippers in men&#x27;s trousers. &quot;Esquire&quot; declared the zipper the &quot;Newest Tailoring Idea for Men&quot;, and that among the zippered fly&#x27;s many virtues was that it would exclude &quot;The Possibility of Unintentional and Embarrassing Disarray.&quot;

The most recent innovation in the zipper&#x27;s design was the introduction of models that could open on both ends, as on jackets. The zipper has become by far the most widespread fastener, and is used on clothing, luggage, leather goods, and various other objects.

==Types==

* Coil zippers now form the bulk of sales of zippers worldwide. The slider runs on two coils on each side; the &quot;teeth&quot; are formed by the windings of the coils. Two basic types of coils are used: one with coils in spiral form, usually with a cord running inside the coils; the other with coils in ladder form, also called the Ruhrmann type. Coil zippers are made of polyester coil and are thus also termed polyester zippers. Nylon was formerly used to make them, and though only polyester is used now, the type is still also termed a nylon zipper.
* Invisible zippers have the teeth hidden behind a tape, so that the zipper is &quot;invisible&quot;. It is also called the &quot;concealed&quot; zipper. The tape&#x27;s color matches the garment&#x27;s, as does the slider&#x27;s and the puller&#x27;s. This kind of a zipper is common in skirts and dresses. Invisible zippers are usually coil zippers. They are also seeing increased use by the military and emergency services because the appearance of a button down shirt can be maintained while providing a quick and easy fastening system. A regular invisible zipper uses a lighter lace-like fabric on the zipper tape, instead of the common heavier woven fabric on other zippers. 
* Reverse coil zippers are a variation of the coil zipper. In a reverse coil zipper, the coil is on the reverse (back) side of the zipper and the slider works on the flat side of the zipper (normally the back, now the front). Unlike an invisible zipper where the coil is also on the back, the reverse coil shows stitching on the front side and the slider accommodates a variety of pulls (the invisible zipper requires a small, tear-drop pull due to the small slider attachment). Water resistant zippers are generally configured as reverse coil so that the PVC coating can cover the stitching. A rubber- or PVC-coated reverse zipper is called a waterproof zipper. 
* Metal zippers are the classic zipper type, found mostly in jeans and pencil cases today. The teeth are not a coil, but are instead individual pieces of metal molded into shape and set on the zipper tape at regular intervals. Metal zippers are made with brass, aluminium and nickel. All these zippers are basically made from flat wire. A special type of metal zipper is made from pre-formed wire, usually brass, but sometimes other metals, too. Only a few companies in the world have this technology. This type of pre-formed metal zipper is mainly used in high grade jeans-wear, work-wear, etc., where high strength is required and zippers need to withstand tough washing.
* Plastic-molded zippers are identical to metallic zippers, except that the teeth are plastic instead of metal. Metal zippers can be painted to match the surrounding fabric; plastic zippers can be made in any color of plastic. Plastic zippers mostly use polyacetal resin, though other thermoplastic polymers are used as well, such as polyethylene. Used most popularly for pencil cases, small plastic pouches and other stationery.
* Open-ended zippers use a &quot;box and pin&quot; mechanism to lock the two sides of the zipper into place, often in jackets. Open-ended zippers can be of any of the above described types.
* Two way open-ended zippers have a puller on each end of the zipper tape instead of having an insertion pin and pin box at the bottom. Someone wearing a garment with this kind of zipper can slide up the bottom puller to accommodate more leg movement without stressing the pin and box of a one-way open-ended zipper. It is most commonly used on long coats.
* Two way closed-ended zippers are closed at both ends; they are often used in luggage and can have either one or two pullers on the zipper.
* Magnetic zippers allow for one-handed closure and are used in sportswear.

===Air and water tightness===


Airtight zippers were first developed by NASA for making high-altitude pressure suits and later space suits, capable of retaining air pressure inside the suit in the vacuum of space.

The airtight zipper is built like a standard toothed zipper, but with a waterproof sheeting (which is made of fabric-reinforced polyethylene and is bonded to the rest of the suit) wrapped around the outside of each row of zipper teeth. When the zipper is closed, the two facing sides of the plastic sheeting are squeezed tightly against one another (between the C-shaped clips) both above and below the zipper teeth, forming a double seal.

This double-mated surface is good at retaining both vacuum and pressure, but the fit must be very tight to press the surfaces together firmly. Consequently, these zippers are typically very stiff when zipped shut and have minimal flex or stretch. They are hard to open and close because the zipper anvil must bend apart teeth that are being held under tension. They can also be derailed, causing damage to the sealing surfaces, if the teeth are misaligned while straining to pull the zipper shut.

These zippers are very common where airtight or watertight seals are needed, such as on scuba diving dry suits, ocean survival suits, and hazmat suits.

A less common water-resistant zipper is similar in construction to a standard toothed zipper, but includes a molded plastic ridge seal similar to the mating surfaces on a Ziploc bag. Such a zipper is easier to open and close than a clipped version, and the slider has a gap above the zipper teeth for separating the ridge seal. This seal is structurally weak against internal pressure, and can be separated by pressure within the sealed container pushing outward on the ridges, which simply flex and spread apart, potentially allowing air or liquid entry. Ridge-sealed zippers are sometimes used on lower-cost surface dry suits.

==Anti-slide zipper locks==
Some zippers include a designed ability for the slider to hold in a steady open or closed position, resisting forces that would try to move the slider and open the zipper unexpectedly. There are two common ways this is accomplished:

The zipper handle can have a short protruding pin stamped into it, which inserts between the zipper teeth through a hole on the slider, when the handle is folded down flat against the zipper teeth. This appears on some brands of trousers. The handle of the fly zipper is folded flat against the teeth when it is not in use, and the handle is held down by both slider hinge tension and the fabric flap over the fly.

The slider can also have a two-piece hinge assembly attaching the handle to the slider, with the base of the hinge under spring tension and with protruding pins on the bottom that insert between the zipper teeth. To move the zipper, the handle is pulled outward against spring tension, lifting the pins out from between the teeth as the slider moves. When the handle is released the pins automatically engage between the zipper teeth again. They are called &quot;auto-lock sliders&quot;.

A three-piece version of the above uses a tiny pivoting arm held under tension inside the hinge. Pulling on the handle from any direction lifts the pivoting arm&#x27;s pins out of the zipper teeth so that the slider can move.

==Components==
The components of a zipper are:
#Top Tape Extension (the fabric part of the zipper, that extends beyond the teeth, at the top of the chain)
#Top Stop (two devices affixed to the top end of a zipper, to prevent the slider from coming off the chain)
#Slider (the device that moves up and down the chain to open or close the zipper)
#Pull Tab or Puller (the part of the slider that is held to move the slider up or down)
#Tape Width (refers to the width of the fabric on both sides of the zipper chain)
#Chain or Zipper Teeth (the continuous piece that is formed when both halves of a zipper are meshed together) and Chain Width (refers to the specific gauge of the chain – common gauge sizes are #3, #5, #7, #8 and #10, the bigger the number, the wider the teeth/chain width is)
#Bottom Stop (a device affixed to the bottom end of a zipper, to prevent further movement of the half of the zipper from separating)
#Bottom Tape Extension (the fabric part of the zipper, that extends beyond the teeth, at the bottom of the chain)
#Single Tape Width (refers to the width of the fabric on one side of the zipper chain)
#Insertion Pin (a device used on a separating zipper whose function is to allow the joining of the two zipper halves)
#Retainer Box or Pin Box (a device used on a separating zipper whose function is to correctly align the pin, to begin the joining of the zipper halves)
#Reinforcement Film (a strip of plastic fused to each half of the zipper tape to allow a manufacturer to electronically &quot;weld&quot; the zipper onto the garment or item that is being manufactured, without the need of sewing or stitching)

==Manufacturing==
&quot;Forbes&quot; reported in 2003 that although the zipper market in the 1960s was dominated by Talon Zipper (US) and Optilon (Germany), Japanese manufacturer YKK grew to become the industry giant by the 1980s. YKK held 45 percent of world market share, followed by Optilon (8 percent) and Talon Zipper (7 percent).

Tex Corp (India) has also emerged as a significant supplier to the apparel industry.

In Europe, the Cremalleras Rubi company was established in 1926 in Spain. It sold over 30 million zippers in 2012.

In 2005, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that China had 80 percent of the international market. Most of its product is made in Qiaotou, Yongjia County.

==Mechanism==
From , the following mechanism of the zipper improved by Gideon Sundback in 1917 is explained:

The zipper is analogous in function to a drawstring, but different in mechanism. A drawstring works by tension in the string drawing the eyelets of the piece together, since the tension acts to straighten the string and forces the eyelets toward a line. The zipper works by an elastic, that is, reversible, deformation of the &quot;locking members&quot; (teeth). The zipper teeth are shaped and sized so that the forces which act on the zipper when the garment it is sewn on is worn cannot unlock the teeth. The slider constrains the teeth positions, moves them along a given path, and acts on the teeth one-by-one in its &quot;Y-shaped channel&quot;, and so, can reversibly lock and unlock them. This is a lock and key design. In Sundback&#x27;s invention the teeth are symmetric with &quot;exterior and interior rounded surfaces&quot; that are &quot;elongated transversely&quot;. The teeth have a material part (&quot;external projection&quot;) and a space (&quot;internal recess&quot;). The material part of one tooth is slightly smaller than the space on the other and so shaped to act as a &quot;contractible jaw&quot;—the jaw is elastically opened and then closed as it goes over the other tooth. The &quot;snug fit&quot; that results when &quot;one member nests within the recess of an adjoining member&quot; is a stable locked state. The maximum force when the slider operates is in between the unlocked and locked positions, giving two stable mechanical equilibria. The &quot;snug fit&quot; is stable, not only to forces from wear that act in the same direction as those of the slider, but also to transverse and longitudinal (both perpendicular) forces.

The zipper is analogous in mechanism to a bobby pin, where the person&#x27;s hand slides hair into and out of the pin&#x27;s &quot;contractible jaw&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Zippers have entered into urban legends. American folklorist Jan Brunvand noted that &quot;The zipper has been the subject of jokes and legends since... the 1920s&quot;. Those stories reflect &quot;modern anxieties and desires&quot;, emphasizing embarrassments and accidents, primarily involving the flies of men&#x27;s trousers in stories such as &quot;The Unzipped Stranger&quot; and &quot;The Unzipped Fly&quot;.

In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley repeatedly mentioned zippers, implying that, in their newness (as of the early 1930s), mechanical complexity, ease of use, and speed, zippers were somehow corrosive of natural human values.

==Durability and repairs==
The zipper is often the least durable component in any garment or type of equipment. Most often, the zipper fails to close due to a worn or bent slider not being able to apply the necessary force to the sides of the teeth to cause them to interlock. This problem can sometimes be redressed by using small pliers to carefully squeeze the back part of the slider together a fraction of a millimeter. This can compensate for the wear of the slider. The slider is typically made as a magnesium diecast which breaks easily. It is necessary to reduce the force on the pliers before it can be felt that the slider actually gives in. If it is not yet possible to successfully close the zipper, the pressure applied to the slider should only gradually be increased. Another way to reduce the gap of the open end of the slider is by preparing a small block of wood by sawing a slot into one end so that it fits over the upper arm of the slider. Then a hammer can be used to exact a force onto the slider by carefully hitting the wood.

When the protective coating of the diecast slider has been worn off by prolonged use, the material can corrode. The corrosion products are usually metal salts which can accumulate and block the slider from moving. When this happens, the salt can often be dissolved by submerging the slider in vinegar or another mild acid. Otherwise, the slider needs to be removed and replaced.

<text>In a computer system, a chipset is a set of electronic components on one or more integrated circuits that manages the data flow between the processor, memory and peripherals. The chipset is usually found on the motherboard of computers. Chipsets are usually designed to work with a specific family of microprocessors. Because it controls communications between the processor and external devices, the chipset plays a crucial role in determining system performance. Sometimes the term &quot;chipset&quot; is used to describe a system on chip (SoC) used in a mobile phone.

==Computers==
In computing, the term &quot;chipset&quot; commonly refers to a set of specialized chips on a computer&#x27;s motherboard or an expansion card. In personal computers, the first chipset for the IBM PC AT of 1984 was the NEAT chipset developed by Chips and Technologies for the Intel 80286 CPU.


In home computers, game consoles, and arcade hardware of the 1980s and 1990s, the term &quot;chipset&quot; was used for the custom audio and graphics chips. Examples include the Original Amiga chipset and Sega&#x27;s System 16 chipset.

In x86-based personal computers, the term &quot;chipset&quot; often refers to a specific pair of chips on the motherboard: the &quot;northbridge&quot; and the &quot;southbridge&quot;. The northbridge links the CPU to very high-speed devices, especially RAM and graphics controllers, and the southbridge connects to lower-speed peripheral buses (such as PCI or ISA). In many modern chipsets, the southbridge contains some on-chip integrated peripherals, such as Ethernet, USB, and audio devices.

Motherboards and their chipsets often come from different manufacturers. , manufacturers of chipsets for x86 motherboards include AMD, Intel, VIA Technologies and Zhaoxin.

In the 1990s, a major designer and manufacturer of chipsets was VLSI Technology in Tempe, Arizona. Some of their innovations included the integration of PCI bridge logic, the GraphiCore 2D graphics accelerator and direct support for synchronous DRAM, the forerunner of DDR SDRAM memory.

The Apple Macintosh SE, Macintosh II and later the Quadras series used chipsets from VLSI Technology, even though they were ASICs designed by Apple. After the switch to PowerPC, Apple used various ASIC suppliers for their chipsets such as VLSI technology, Texas Instruments, LSI Logic or Lucent Technologies (later known as Agere Systems). When Apple switched to Intel they used traditional PC chipsets.

In the 1980s, Chips and Technologies pioneered the manufacturing of chipsets for PC-compatible computers. Computer systems produced since then often share commonly used chipsets, even across widely disparate computing specialties. For example, the NCR 53C9x, a low-cost chipset implementing a SCSI interface to storage devices, could be found in Unix machines such as the MIPS Magnum, embedded devices, and personal computers.

==Move toward processor integration in PCs==

Traditionally in x86 computers, the processor&#x27;s primary connection to the rest of the machine was through the motherboard chipset&#x27;s northbridge. The northbridge was directly responsible for communications with high-speed devices (system memory and primary expansion buses, such as PCIe, AGP, and PCI cards, being common examples) and conversely any system communication back to the processor. This connection between the processor and northbridge is commonly designated the front-side bus (FSB). Requests to resources not directly controlled by the northbridge were offloaded to the southbridge, with the northbridge being an intermediary between the processor and the southbridge. The southbridge handled &quot;everything else&quot;, generally lower-speed peripherals and board functions (the largest being hard disk and storage connectivity) such as USB, parallel and serial communications. In 1990s and early 2000s, the interface between a northbridge and southbridge was the PCI bus.

Before 2003, any interaction between a CPU and main memory or an expansion device such as a graphics card(s) — whether AGP, PCI or integrated into the motherboard — was directly controlled by the northbridge IC on behalf of the processor. This made processor performance highly dependent on the system chipset, especially the northbridge&#x27;s memory performance and ability to shuttle this information back to the processor. In 2003, however, AMD&#x27;s introduction of the Athlon 64 series of processors changed this. The Athlon 64 marked the introduction of an integrated memory controller being incorporated into the processor itself thus allowing the processor to directly access and handle memory, negating the need for a traditional northbridge to do so. Intel followed suit in 2008 with the release of its Core i series CPUs and the X58 platform.

In newer processors integration has further increased, primarily through the inclusion of the system&#x27;s primary PCIe controller and integrated graphics directly on the CPU itself. As fewer functions are left un-handled by the processor, chipset vendors have condensed the remaining northbridge and southbridge functions into a single chip. Intel&#x27;s version of this is the &quot;Platform Controller Hub&quot; (PCH) while AMD&#x27;s version was called Fusion Controller Hub (FCH). The PCH is still called a chipset. This is an enhanced southbridge for the remaining peripherals—as traditional northbridge duties, such as memory controller, expansion bus (PCIe) interface and even on-board video controller, are integrated into the CPU die itself (the chipset often contains secondary PCIe connections though). However, the Platform Controller Hub was also integrated into the processor package as a second die for mobile variants of the Skylake processors. 

AMD&#x27;s FCH has been discontinued since the release of the Carrizo series of CPUs as it has been integrated into the same die as the rest of the CPU. However, since the release of the Zen architecture, there&#x27;s still a component called a chipset which only handles relatively low speed I/O such as USB and SATA ports and connects to the CPU with a PCIe connection. In these systems all PCIe connections are routed directly to the CPU. The UMI interface previously used by AMD for communicating with the FCH is replaced with a PCIe connection. Technically the processor can operate without a chipset; it only continues to be present for interfacing with low speed I/O. AMD server CPUs adopt a self contained system on chip design instead which doesn&#x27;t require a chipset.

The northbridge to southbridge interconnect interfaces used now are DMI (Intel) and UMI (AMD). These can also be used for connecting from a processor to a chipset.

<text>On 20 July 1944, Adolf Hitler and his top military associates entered the briefing hut of the Wolf&#x27;s Lair military headquarters, a series of concrete bunkers and shelters located deep in the forest of East Prussia, not far from the location of the World War I Battle of Tannenberg. Soon after, an explosion killed three officers and a stenographer, injuring everyone else in the room. This assassination attempt was the work of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, an aristocrat who had been severely wounded while serving in the North African theater of war, losing his right hand, left eye, and two fingers of his left hand.

The bomb plot was a carefully planned coup d&#x27;état attempt against the Nazi regime, orchestrated by a group of army officers. Their plan was to assassinate Hitler, seize power in Berlin, establish a new pro-Western government and save Germany from total defeat.

Immediately after the arrest and execution of the plot leaders in Berlin by Friedrich Fromm, the Gestapo (the secret police force of Nazi Germany) began arresting people involved or suspected of being involved. This opportunity was also used to eliminate other, unrelated critics of the Nazi regime. In total, an estimated 7,000 people were arrested of which approximately 4,980 were executed, some slowly strangled with piano wire on Hitler&#x27;s insistence. A month after the failed attempt on Hitler&#x27;s life, the Gestapo initiated Aktion Gitter.

Some of those involved include:

<text>George was a monthly magazine centered on the theme of politics-as-lifestyle founded by John F. Kennedy Jr. and Michael J. Berman with publisher Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. in New York City in September 1995. Its tagline was &quot;Not Just Politics As Usual.&quot; It was published from 1995 to 2001.

==Overview==
For the debut issue, creative director Matt Berman (no relation to co-founder Michael Berman) conceived a cover which received a great deal of attention for its image of Cindy Crawford dressed as George Washington photographed by Herb Ritts.

&quot;George&quot; departed from the format of traditional political publications, whose audience primarily comprised people in or around the political world. The general template for &quot;George&quot; was similar to magazines such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot; or &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. The consistent underlying theme was to marry the themes of celebrity and media with the subject of politics in such a way that the general public would find political news and discourse about politics more interesting to read.

==Reception==
When it first appeared, &quot;George&quot; attracted great interest, and for a brief period had the largest circulation of any political magazine in the nation, partly due to the celebrity status of Kennedy, but it soon began losing money. Kennedy and &quot;George&quot; occasionally courted controversy to boost sales, one notable example being the 1997 issue wherein Kennedy in his editorial lambasted his cousins Michael Kennedy and Joe Kennedy II, whose marital scandals had recently made news, as &quot;poster boys for bad behavior&quot;.

Kennedy later complained that the magazine was not taken seriously in the publishing world.

Critics called &quot;George&quot; &quot;the political magazine for people who don&#x27;t understand politics,&quot; assailing it for &quot;stripping any and all discussion of political issues from its coverage of politics&quot;. In a feature in its final issue, &quot;Spy&quot; magazine asserted that the magazine&#x27;s premise was flawed because, &quot;Politics overlapped with Pop Culture in such a limited number of ways&quot;. That fairly critical profile in &quot;Spy&quot; described &quot;George&quot; as &quot;scrambling for celebrities &#x27;with tits&#x27; as often as possible to put on the cover and then trying to figure out what that person had to do with politics&quot;.

==Decline==
After Kennedy died in a plane crash in 1999, Hachette Filipacchi Magazines purchased Kennedy&#x27;s portion of the magazine from his estate and continued for over a year, with Frank Lalli as editor-in-chief. With falling advertising sales, the magazine ceased publication in 2001, two years after Kennedy&#x27;s death.
In 2005, Harvard Kennedy School held a panel discussion titled &quot;Not Just Politics as Usual&quot;, which commemorated the 10th anniversary of the magazine&#x27;s launch. The panel was moderated by Tom Brokaw and featured appearances by other journalists.

=== Back-issue popularity ===
A February 1997 edition of &quot;George&quot; with the tagline &quot;Survival Guide to the Future&quot;, wherein Kennedy interviews Bill Gates, has become well sought-after by adherents of the QAnon conspiracy theory, with one copy online being listed at $3,499.99.

<text>Tungurahua (; from Quichua &quot;tunguri&quot; (throat) and &quot;rahua&quot; (fire), &quot;Throat of Fire&quot;) is an active stratovolcano located in the Cordillera Oriental of Ecuador. The volcano gives its name to the province of Tungurahua. Volcanic activity restarted on August 19, 1999, and is ongoing , with several eruptive episodes since then, the most recent lasting from February 26 to March 16, 2016.

== Etymology ==
According to one theory the name &quot;Tungurahua&quot; is a combination of the Quichua &quot;tunguri&quot; (throat) and &quot;rahua&quot; (fire) meaning &quot;Throat of Fire&quot;. According to another theory it is based on the Quichua &quot;uraua&quot; for crater. Tungurahua is also known as &quot;The Black Giant&quot; (&quot;Gigante Negro&quot; in spanish), and in local indigenous mythology it is referred to as &quot;Mama Tungurahua&quot; (&quot;Mother Tungurahua&quot;).

== Geography and geology ==
=== Location ===
Tungurahua is located in the Cordillera Oriental of the Andes of central Ecuador, south of the capital Quito. Nearby notable mountains are Chimborazo () and El Altar (). It rises above the small thermal springs town of Baños de Agua Santa () which is located at its foot to the north. Other nearby towns are Ambato ( to the northwest) and Riobamba ( to the southwest). Tungurahua is part of the Sangay National Park.

=== Glacier ===
With its elevation of , Tungurahua just over tops the snow line (about ). Tungurahua&#x27;s top is snow-covered and did feature a small summit glacier which melted away after the increase of volcanic activity in 1999.

=== Volcanism ===
Today&#x27;s volcanic edifice (Tungurahua III) is constructed inside its predecessor&#x27;s (Tungurahua II) caldera which collapsed about 3000 (±90) years ago. The original edifice (Tungurahua I) collapsed at the end of the Late Pleistocene.

==== Historical volcanic activity ====
Tungurahua&#x27;s eruptions are Strombolian. They produce andesite and dacite. All historical eruptions originated from the summit crater and have been accompanied by strong explosions, pyroclastic flows and sometimes lava flows. In the last 1,300 years Tungurahua entered every 80 to 100 years into an activity phase of which the major have been the ones of 1773, 1886 and 1916–1918.

Study of volcanic ash layers deposited in the lakes of El Cajas National Park show that there were major eruptions 3,034±621, 2,027±41, 1,557±177, 733±112 years ago (cal BP).

==== Recent volcanic activity ====
In 2000, after a long period of quiescence, the volcano entered an eruptive phase that continued until 2017. The renewed activity in October 1999 produced major ashfall and led to the temporary evacuation of more than 25,000 inhabitants from Baños and the surrounding area Activity continued at a medium level until May 2006, when activity increased dramatically, culminating in violent eruptions on 14 July 2006 and 16 August 2006. The 16 August 2006 eruption has been the most violent since activity commenced in 1999. This eruption was accompanied by a high ash plume which spread over an area of , depositing ash and tephra to the southwest of the volcano. Several pyroclastic flows were generated that killed at least five people, and destroyed a number of hamlets and roads on the eastern and northwestern slopes of the volcano.

A further eruption and evacuation occurred on 4 December 2010. Ecuador&#x27;s National Agency of Risk Control issued a &quot;red alert&quot;, later downgraded to orange. The Ecuadorean Institute for Geophysics reported a rapid increase in seismic activity, a number of explosions and an ash cloud reaching in height. Another eruption occurred on 18 December 2012 forcing evacuation of those living on the volcano&#x27;s slopes. The volcano erupted again in July 2013, and again on 1 February 2014.

== First ascent ==
In June 1802, the Prussian-born explorer Alexander von Humboldt tried without success to reach the summit. During their seven-year-long South America expedition (1868 to 1876), the German volcanologists Alphons Stübel and Wilhelm Reiss climbed Cotopaxi (Reiss with Angel Escobar; 28 November 1872) and Tungurahua (Stübel with Eusebio Rodríguez; 9 February 1873).

<doc id="302244" wikidata="Q2663549" url="?curid=302244" title="Lies, damned lies, and statistics">
<text>&quot;Lies, damned lies, and statistics&quot; is a phrase describing the persuasive power of statistics to bolster weak arguments, &quot;one of the best, and best-known&quot; critiques of applied statistics. It is also sometimes colloquially used to doubt statistics used to prove an opponent&#x27;s point.

The phrase was popularized in the United States by Mark Twain (among others), who attributed it to the British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. However, the phrase is not found in any of Disraeli&#x27;s works and the earliest known appearances were years after his death. Several other people have been listed as originators of the quote, and it is often attributed to Twain himself.

==History==
Mark Twain popularized the saying in &quot;Chapters from My Autobiography&quot;, published in the &quot;North American Review&quot; in 1907. &quot;Figures often beguile me,&quot; Twain wrote, &quot;particularly when I have the arranging of them myself; in which case the remark attributed to Disraeli would often apply with justice and force: &#x27;There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.&#x27;&quot;

Alternative attributions include, among many others (for example Walter Bagehot and Arthur James Balfour), the radical English journalist and politician Henry Du Pré Labouchère (1831–1912), Jervoise Athelstane Baines, and British politician and scholar Leonard H. Courtney, who used the phrase in 1895 and two years later became president of the Royal Statistical Society. Courtney is quoted by as attributing the phrase to a &quot;wise statesman&quot;, but he may have been referring to a future statesman rather than a past one. The phrase has also been attributed to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

The phrase is quoted frequently in 1895, but here is a 1894 example: &quot;His less enthusiastic neighbor thinks of the proverbial kinds of falsehoods, “lies, damned lies, and statistics,” and replies: “Reports of large numbers of cases subjected to operation seldom fail to beget a suspicion of unjustifiable risk.”&quot;

A Dictionary of English Folklore claims that the earliest instance resembling the phrase found in print is a letter written in the British newspaper &quot;National Observer&quot; on June 8, 1891, published June 13, 1891, p. 93(–94):
NATIONAL PENSIONS
[To the Editor of The National Observer]
London, 8 June 1891
&quot;Sir, —It has been wittily remarked that there are three kinds of
falsehood: the first is a &#x27;fib,&#x27; the second is a downright lie, and the third and most
aggravated is statistics. It is on statistics and on the absence of statistics
that the advocate of national pensions relies ...&quot; Later, in October 1891, as a query in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;, the pseudonymous questioner, signing as &quot;St Swithin&quot;, asked for the originator of the phrase, indicating common usage even at that date. The pseudonym has been attributed to Eliza Gutch.

The American Dialect Society list archives include numerous posts by Stephen Goranson that cite research into uses soon after the above.
They include:
* Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke (1843–1911) is reported twice in October 1891 to have used the phrase, without attributing it to others:
: &quot;Sir Charles Dilke [1843–1911] was saying the other day that false statements might be arranged according to their degree under three heads, fibs, lies, and statistics.&quot; &quot;The Bristol Mercury and Daily Post&quot;, Monday, October 19, 1891
:The Derby Mercury (Derby, England), October 21, 1891; Issue 9223 &quot;Sir Charles Dilke and the Bishops&quot; &quot;A mass meeting of the slate quarry-men of Festiniog [Ffestiniog, Wales] was held Wednesday night [Oct. 14] to protest against certain dismissals from one of the quarries ...&quot; He [Dilke] observed that the speeches of the Bishops on the disestablishment question reminded him that there were three degrees of untruth—a fib, a lie, and statistics (Laughter)&quot;
* The phrase, as noted by Robert Giffen in 1892, was a variation on a phrase about three types of unreliable witnesses, a liar, a damned liar, and an expert from the Economic Journal the paper was previously read at a meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science at Hobart in January 1892. Robert Giffen (1837–1910, Walter Bagehot&#x27;s assistant editor at &quot;The Economist&quot; 1868 ff.; 1882–4 President of the Statistical Society): &quot;An old jest runs to the effect that there are three degrees of comparison among liars. There are liars, there are outrageous liars, and there are scientific experts. This has lately been adapted to throw dirt upon statistics. There are three degrees of comparison, it is said, in lying. There are lies, there are outrageous lies, and there are statistics.&quot;
* That phrase can be found in &quot;Nature&quot;, page 74 November 26, 1885: &quot;A well-known lawyer, now a judge, once grouped witnesses into three classes: simple liars, damned liars, and experts. He did not mean that the expert uttered things which he knew to be untrue, but that by the emphasis which he laid on certain statements, and by what has been defined as a highly cultivated faculty of evasion, the effect was actually worse than if he had.&quot;
* A minute of the X Club meeting held on 5 December 1885, recorded by Thomas Henry Huxley, noted &quot;Talked politics, scandal, and the three classes of witnesses—liars, d—d liars, and experts.&quot; Quoted in 1900 in Leonard Huxley&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley&quot;.

Colin White traces the origins to François Magendie (1783–1855). According to White, while arguing against using blood-letting to treat fever and confronted with statistical numbers he believed to be manufactured, this French physiologist stated: &quot;Thus the alteration of the truth which is already manifesting itself in the progressive form of lying and perjury, offers us, in the superlative, the statistics.&quot; In White&#x27;s opinion, the world had a need of this phrase, many people &quot;would have been proud&quot; to coin it, and the origins are now obscured, as the phrase passed &quot;from wit to wit&quot;. White is referring to the work of Paul Delaunay, however, Delaunay&#x27;s text, while using the phrase, does not explicitly attribute it to Magendie. John Bibby and David R. Bellhouse also mention Magendie&#x27;s authorship.

==Uses==
The phrase has been used in the title of a number of popular expositions, including:
*&quot;Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics: The Manipulation of Public Opinion in America&quot;, by Michael Wheeler (W. W. Norton &amp; Co. 1976; Dell paperback 1978).
*&quot;Quotes, Damned Quotes ... some of them to do with statistics&quot; (1985), by John Bibby – an attempt to untangle the history of this quotation.
*&quot;Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists&quot; (2001), by University of Delaware sociologist Joel Best ().
*&quot;Lies, Damned Lies, and Drug War Statistics: A Critical Analysis of Claims Made by the Office of National Drug Control Policy&quot; (2014), by Matthew B. Robinson &amp; Renee G. Scherlen SUNY Press; 

The essay &quot;The Median Isn&#x27;t the Message&quot; by Stephen Jay Gould begins by repeating this quote. Gould explains how the statistic that peritoneal mesothelioma, the form of cancer with which he was diagnosed in 1982, has a &quot;median survival time of eight months&quot; is misleading.

&quot;Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics&quot; is the title of episode 21 in the first season of NBC drama &quot;The West Wing.&quot;

<text>In criminal law, property is obtained by false pretenses when the acquisition results from the intentional misrepresentation of a past or existing fact.

==Elements==
The elements of false pretenses are:
*a false representation
*of a material past or existing fact
*which the person making the representation knows is false
*made for the purpose of causing
*and which does cause
*the victim to pass title
*to his property

False pretenses is a statutory offense in most jurisdictions; subject matter covered by statute varies accordingly, and is not necessarily limited to tangible personal property - some statutes include intangible personal property and services. For example, the North Carolina false pretense statute applies to obtaining &quot;any money, goods, property, services, choses in action, or any other thing of value ...&quot;

Under common law, false pretense is defined as a representation of a present or past fact, which the thief knows to be false, and which he intends will and does cause the victim to pass title of his property. That is, false pretense is the acquisition of title from a victim by fraud or misrepresentation of a material past or present fact.

===&quot;A false representation...&quot;===

There must be a description or portrayal of something that is false. If a person makes a statement about something that he mistakenly believes to be untrue there is no false representation.

For example, if a person represents that the stone in a ring is a diamond when he believes that is in fact made of cubic zirconia, he is not guilty of false pretenses if it turns out that the ring was in fact a diamond. The representation must be false at the time title passes. Thus if the representation was false when made but is true at the time title to the property passes there is no crime.

For example, representing to a seller that you have funds available in your bank account to pay for the goods when in fact your account has a zero balance is not false pretenses if at the time the transaction takes place adequate funds are present in the account. The representation may be oral or written. The misrepresentation has to be affirmative. A failure to disclose a fact does not fit this misrepresentation in common law, unless there is a fiduciary duty between the thief and victim. Moreover, opinion and puffing are not considered misrepresentation as they color the facts but do not misrepresent them.

===&quot;...of a material past or existing fact...&quot;===
The representation must relate to a material past or existing fact. A representation concerning a future state of facts is not sufficient. Nor is merely an expression of opinion.

===&quot;...which the person making the representation knows is false...&quot;===

A mistaken representation about some past or existing state of facts is not sufficient for false pretense.

===&quot;...made for the purpose of causing and which does cause...&quot;===

It is essential that the victim of the false pretenses must actually be deceived by the misrepresentation: the victim must transfer title to the property in reliance on the representation; and the victim being deceived must be a major (if not the only) reason for the victim&#x27;s transferring title to the defendant.

Simply making a false promise or statement is not sufficient. It is not a defense to false pretenses charge that a reasonable person would not have been deceived by the false representation. No matter how gullible the victim, if they were in fact deceived then the offense has been committed.

On the other hand, the offense requires the victim believe the representation to be true. If the person to whom the representation has been made has doubts or serious misgivings about the truth of the representation but nonetheless goes through with the transaction, they have not been deceived - they have basically assumed the risk of a false representation.

===&quot;...the victim to pass title to his property.&quot; ===
False pretense is conventionally referred to as a crime against &quot;title&quot; and &quot;title&quot; must pass from the victim to the perpetrator for the crime to be complete. However, this is not to be taken literally for the simple reason that a person who obtains ownership of property by deceit does not obtain full title to the property; only a voidable title. False pretense applies to situations where the wrongdoer by deceit obtains &quot;title or ownership – or whatever property interest the victim had in the chattel, if it was less than title.&quot; If the victim has an interest is the property less than full title the acquisition of that interest through false representation can be false pretenses unless the only interest the person has is possession of the property. In such case the crime would be larceny by trick rather than false pretenses. Larceny by Trick also applies to situations where the wrongdoer by deceit obtains possession only, with the victim retaining ownership or some superior interest in the chattel. Determining whether the victim obtained title or possession can present problems. Generally a sell or conditional sell is sufficient to pass title for purposes of false pretenses whereas lending property does not involve a transfer of title. Note that if property is falsely obtained for a specific purpose - for example money to buy a car that does not exist - the crime is larceny by trick rather than false pretenses because the victim intended to pass title to the money only upon completion of the transaction; until such time the victim intended to deliver possession only.

The essential distinction between false pretenses and larceny and embezzlement is that false pretenses requires that the victim pass title to the defendant whereas the other offenses do not.

The determination as to whether the offense is larceny or false pretenses can have significant effect on the ability of true owner to reclaim the appropriated property. If false pretenses, a bona fide purchaser for value would acquire title superior to the victim; whereas, if the crime is larceny a purchaser from the wrongdoer, bona fide or otherwise, would not acquire any title to the property and would have to return the property to the victim.

== United States ==
United States statutes on this subject are mainly copied from the English statutes, and the courts there in a general way follow the English interpretations. The statutes of each state must be consulted. Under federal law, obtaining money or property through false pretenses as part of a scheme or artifice to defraud, and using means of interstate commerce such as a telephone, is illegal under title 18 USC section 1343; the crime is usually referred to as &quot;Wire Fraud.&quot; There are Federal laws providing penalties for false personation of the lawful owner of public stocks, &amp;c., or of persons entitled to pensions, prize money, &amp;c., or the false making of any order purporting to be a money order.

===History===
The first &quot;modern&quot; false pretense statute, the Obtaining Money by False Pretences, etc. Act 1757 (30 Geo. 2. c. 24) was enacted by Parliament in 1757. The statute prohibited obtaining &quot;money, goods, wares, or merchandise&quot; by &quot;false pretence.&quot; The first general embezzlement statute, the Embezzlement Act 1799 (39 Geo. 3. c. 85), was enacted by Parliament in 1799. Neither of these statutes were part of the American common law. However, most states passed laws similar to the English statutes.

=== Arizona ===
In Arizona, obtaining money or property by falsely impersonating another is punishable as for larceny. Obtaining credit by false pretenses as to wealth and mercantile character is punishable by six months imprisonment and a fine not exceeding three times the value of the money or property obtained.

=== Illinois ===
In Illinois, whoever by any false representation or writing signed by him, of his own respectability, wealth or mercantile correspondence or connections, obtain; credit and thereby defrauds any person of money, goods, chattels or any valuable thing, or who procures another to make a false report of his honesty, wealth, &amp;c., shall return the money, goods, &amp;c., and be fined and imprisoned for a term not exceeding one year. Obtaining money or property by bogus cheques, the confidence game, or three card monte, sleight of hand, fortune-telling, &amp;c., is punishable by imprisonment for from one to ten years. Obtaining goods from warehouse, mill or wharf by fraudulent receipt wrongly stating amount of goods deposited by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than ten years. Fraudulent use of railroad passes is a misdemeanor. A person who knowingly personates a public official, a veteran, the recipient of a medal, the holder of a title, or profits from a false academic degree is unlawful.

=== Massachusetts ===
In Massachusetts it is simple larceny to obtain by false pretenses the money or personal chattel of another. Obtaining by false pretence the making, acceptance or endorsement of a bill of exchange or promissory note, the release or substitution of collateral or other security, an extension of time for payment of an obligation, or the release or alteration of the obligation of a written contract, is larceny and punishable by imprisonment.

=== New York ===
In New York, obtaining property by false pretenses, felonious breach of trust and embezzlement are included in the term larceny, but the methods of proof required to establish each crime remain as before the code. Obtaining lodging and food on credit at hotel or lodging house with intent to defraud is a misdemeanor. Purchase of property by false pretences as to persons means or ability to pay is not criminal when in writing signed by the party to be charged

== United Kingdom ==
False pretences as a concept in the criminal law is no longer used in English law. It used to refer to the means whereby the defendant obtained any chattel, money or valuable security from any other person with intent to defraud, indictable as a misdemeanour under the Larceny Act 1861 as amended by the Larceny Act 1916. The modern concept is a deception and it is used as the common basis of the &quot;actus reus&quot; (the Latin for &quot;guilty act&quot;) in the deception offences under the Theft Act 1968 and in the Theft Act 1978. The Fraud Act 2006 repealed these latter two acts and replaced deception offences with other offences.

===History===
The three major theft offences were larceny, embezzlement and false pretences. Larceny was a common law offence (created by judicial action) while embezzlement and false pretences were statutory offences (created by legislative action). Larceny is by far the oldest. The elements of larceny were &quot;well-settled&quot; by the 13th century. The only other theft offence then existing was cheat which was a misdemeanor. Cheat was a primitive version of the crime of false pretences and involved obtaining property by the use of false weights or measures. In 1541 a statute, the Counterfeit Letters, etc. Act 1541 (33 Hen. 8. c. 1) was enacted by Parliament that made it a misdemeanor to obtain property by a false token or a counterfeit letter &quot;made in any other man&#x27;s name.&quot; This statute did not cover obtaining property by the use false spoken words. The first &quot;modern&quot; false pretence statute, the Obtaining Money by False Pretences, etc. Act 1757 (30 Geo. 2. c. 24), was enacted by Parliament in 1757. The statute prohibited obtaining &quot;money, goods, wares, or merchandise&quot; by &quot;false pretence.&quot; The first general embezzlement statute, the Embezzlement Act 1799 (39 Geo. 3. c. 85), was enacted by Parliament in 1799.

The broad distinction between this offence and larceny is that in the former the owner intends to part with his property, in the latter he does not. This offence dates as a statutory crime practically from 1756. At common law the only remedy originally available for an owner who had been deprived of his goods by fraud was an indictment for the crime of cheating, or a civil action for deceit. These remedies were insufficient to cover all cases where money or other properties had been obtained by false pretences, and the offence was first partially created by a statute of Henry VIII, the Counterfeit Letters, etc. Act 1541 (33 Hen. 8. c. 1), which enacted that if any person should falsely and deceitfully obtain any money, goods, etc., by means of any false token or counterfeit letter made in any other man&#x27;s name, the offender should suffer any punishment other than death, at the discretion of the judge. The scope of the offence was enlarged to include practically all false pretences by the Obtaining Money by False Pretences, etc. Act 1757, the provisions of which were embodied in the Larceny Act 1861.

The pretence must be a false pretence of some existing fact, made for the purpose of inducing the prosecutor to part with his property (e.g. it was held not to be a false pretence to promise to pay for goods on delivery), and it may be by either words or conduct. The property, too, must have been actually obtained by the false pretence. The owner must be induced by the pretence to make over the absolute and immediate ownership of the goods, otherwise it is larceny by means of a trick. It is not always easy, however, to draw a distinction between the various classes of offences. In the case where a man goes into a restaurant and orders a meal, and, after consuming it, says that he has no means of paying for it, it was usual to convict for obtaining food by false pretences. But in &quot;R v Jones&quot; , an English court found that it is neither larceny nor false pretences, but an offence under the Debtors Act 1869, of obtaining credit by fraud.

&quot;R v Danger&quot; revealed a lacuna in the law. This was remedied by section 90 of the Larceny Act 1861. That section was replaced by section 32(2) of the Larceny Act 1916.

Section 32 of the Larceny Act 1916 read:

The offence of obtaining by false pretences, contrary to section 32(1) of the Larceny Act 1916, was replaced by the offence of obtaining property by deception, contrary to section 15 of the Theft Act 1968. Section 32(2) of the Larceny Act 1916 was replaced by section 20(2) of the Theft Act 1968.

<doc id="302249" wikidata="Q831611" url="?curid=302249" title="Willet">
<text>The willet (Tringa semipalmata) is a large shorebird in the family Scolopacidae. It is a relatively large and robust sandpiper and is the largest of the species called &quot;shanks&quot; in the genus &quot;Tringa&quot;. Its closest relative is the lesser yellowlegs, a much smaller bird with a very different appearance apart from the fine, clear, and dense pattern of the neck, which both species show in breeding plumage. It breeds in North America and the West Indies and winters in southern North America, Central America, the West Indies and South America.

==Taxonomy==
The willet was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Scolopax&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Scolopax semipalmata&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;semipalmated snipe&quot; from New York that had been described in 1785 by both the English ornithologist John Latham and by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant. The willet was formerly assigned to the genus &quot;Catoptrosorus &quot; that had been introduced for the species in 1827 by Charles Lucien Bonaparte. In 2006 it was moved to the current genus &quot;Tringa&quot; based on a molecular phylogenetic study published the previous year. The genus name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin word given to the green sandpiper by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603 based on Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific epithet &quot;semipalmata&quot; combines the Latin &quot;semi-&quot; meaning &quot;half&quot; or &quot;small&quot; with &quot;palmatus&quot; meaning &quot;palmate&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:

*&quot;T. s. inornata&quot; : breeds from the Prairie Provinces of Canada south to northeastern California, northern Colorado and western Nebraska; winters mainly on the Pacific coasts from the southern United States from coastal S USA to northern South America as far south as northern Chile. Some winter on the Atlantic coast southwards from the southern United States. 
*&quot;T. s. semipalmata&quot; : breeds from southern Newfoundland and along the Atlantic coast of the United States into the Gulf of Mexico, including the Caribbean Islands; winters in the West Indies and along the eastern coast of South America as far south as southern Brazil and Argentina. There are no documented records of this taxon wintering in the United States.

It has been suggested that the two subspecies be treated as separate species as there are clear differences in distribution, behavior, morphology, and genetics, but this has yet to be widely adopted.

The willet is a very rare vagrant to Europe with records from the Azores, mainland Portugal, France, Norway and Finland. The Portuguese record from Alcochete near Lisbon on 29 April 2009 showed characteristics of the eastern subspecies.

==Description==

The willet is an inelegant and heavily built shorebird with a structure similar to that of the common redshank but being larger in size than the greater yellowlegs while resembling a godwit in flight with black primary coverts and primaries contrasting with a broad white band, white secondaries with a white rump and gray tail band. With its reclassification into the &quot;Tringa&quot; genus, it stands as the largest species in this prominent sandpiper genus. It is in overall length and weighs . The sexes are similar in plumage but the female is slightly larger.

The black underwing coverts may be conspicuous in flight. Willets are identified on the ground by their gray legs and shortish, heavy but straight bill. The plumage is gray above with a white rump, and white below with a distinct white area above the lores and a narrow whitish eye ring giving the bird a spectacled appearance. The underparts are white. In breeding plumage, the bird shows brown barring on the upperparts. Non-breeding birds are plainer.

===Voice===
The willet&#x27;s name is onomatopoeic and refers to its loud piercing &quot;&quot;pill-will-willet&quot; territorial song., which is higher pitched and repeated at a faster rate in Eastern willets than in Western birds. Other calls include a predator response call given by breeding birds which is a repeated, staccato &quot;kleep&quot;, while non breeding birds alarms include a high, pitched anxious &quot;kip-kip-viek&quot; call and a &quot;kreei&quot; call. They also have a distinctive call when crossing another willet&#x27;s territory and this &quot;klay-dir&quot;&quot; call is also used as a contact call when willets are migrating.

==Distribution and habitat==
Two subspecies (which may actually be different species) have very different breeding habitats. The eastern willet breeds in coastal saltmarshes while the western willet breeds in freshwater prairie marshes, sloughs, potholes and other inland wetlands. In winter both subspecies are coastal birds being found on both rocky and sandy coasts as well as on mudflats and in coastal marshes.

==Behavior and ecology==
They are territorial both on the breeding grounds and on the wintering areas but form loose breeding colonies or wintering groups. When displaying the wings are held stiffly and downcurved in flight while on the ground the display gives prominence to the distinctive pattern of the underwings. They are normally vigilant birds, with the birds closer to the landward edge of a saltmarsh being the first to utter their alarm calls, in a manner reminiscent of the common redshank in Europe, although some individuals may be approachable.

===Food and feeding===
Willets are flexible in their feeding habits and hunt by walking steadily and pecking prey from the substrate, although they also probe into the mud or silt with their sensitive bill and may actively stalk larger prey in shallow water. A favored prey on the coasts is small fiddler crabs as well as mole crabs, worms, clams and other invertebrates. They have also been known to occasionally eat plant material. Willets also actively hunt more mobile prey such as fish and aquatic insects in the water and will wade up to their bellies to pursue such prey. Prey recorded in western willets during breeding include water scavenger beetles (Hydrophilidae), diving beetles (Dytiscidae), snout beetles (Curculionidae), spiders (Araneae) and fish (Cypriniformes). In winter, western willets have been recorded eating shore crabs (&quot;Hemigrapsus&quot;), brachyuran crabs (&quot;Uca princeps&quot;, &quot;Leptuca crenulata&quot;), crabs (&quot;Pachygrapsus&quot;), clams (&quot;Macoma&quot;, &quot;Gemma gemma&quot;), nereid worms (&quot;Neanthes&quot;), mussels (&quot;Mytilus&quot;), whelks (Nassariidae) and others. Eastern willets eat primarily marine coastal prey, including fiddler crabs (&quot;Minuca minax&quot;, &quot;Minuca pugnax&quot;, &quot;Leptuca pugilator&quot;), other crabs (&quot;Armases cinereum&quot;, &quot;Sesarma reticulatum&quot;), mole crabs (&quot;Emerita talpoida&quot;), amphipods (&quot;Corophium volutator&quot;) and other marine invertebrates. The sensitive bill means that willets can hunt at night as well as during the day. They often use rocks, trees or fence posts to perch on.

===Breeding===

The male normally leads the female through the territory and creates trial nest scrapes for the female to consider until she selects the site. The nest is a shallow depression scraped out by the birds using their feet and breast, it measures 15 cm across and 5 cm deep. It is placed among grass close to the water&#x27;s edge in western willets and in saltmarsh or sand dunes in eastern willets. If the nest is placed among grass the female may pull grass stalks over the nest for camouflage. Fine grass leaves and small pebbles may be used to line the nest and grass lining may be brought from some distance where the nest is on bare ground. The male and female may form a long-term monogamous bond and return to the same territory in successive breeding seasons. The male defends the territory from other willets, challenging his neighbors with a ritualized walk along the mutual boundary of their territory, and often this leads to fights. Both sexes incubate the eggs for 22–29 days, although the male tends to incubate at night, the female departs from the territory before the precocial young are fledged leaving them in the care of the male for the last two weeks or so before they fledge.

==Conservation==
The willet is still common in some parts of its range despite an apparent decline since the 1960s. It is also considered to be a species at risk of becoming threatened or endangered without conservation action. The western subspecies is threatened by the conversion of native grasslands and drainage of wetlands for agriculture while the wintering habitat has been degraded locally in California by coastal development. Willets are also vulnerable to being killed by colliding with power lines laid through their wetland breeding areas. The passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918 protected the willet from intensive exploitation by hunters for food and allowed its numbers to rebound to present levels. There are a total of 250,000 willets in North America, of which 150,000 were counted from the western flyway, and 90,000 in the eastern. Since the Western willet winters in the east, that means that there are probably much less than 90,000 Eastern willets.

<text>Council communism or councilism is a current of communist thought that emerged in the 1920s. Inspired by the November Revolution, council communism was opposed to state socialism and advocated workers&#x27; councils and council democracy. Councilism is also opposed to Leninism and Stalinism. It is regarded as being strongest in Germany and the Netherlands during the 1920s.

== History ==

=== Emergence ===
Council communism emerged in the years after 1918, as some communists in Germany and the Netherlands concluded that the Russian Revolution had led to power being concentrated in the hands of a new political elite. Its most prominent early proponents were the German educator Otto Rühle, the Dutch astronomer Anton Pannekoek, and the Dutch poet Herman Gorter. They were initially enthusiastic supporters of the Bolsheviks and the Russian Revolution. In 1918, Gorter said that the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin &quot;stands out above all other leaders of the Proletariat&quot; and that Karl Marx was Lenin&#x27;s sole peer. In 1919, Pannekoek wrote that &quot;in Russia communism has been put into practice for two years now&quot;.

When the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) was formed in December 1918, a majority in the party was opposed to electoral politics and trade unionism. These positions placed it to the left of Bolshevik orthodoxy. In 1919, the Communist International (Comintern) was formed to promote Bolshevik policies internationally. In October 1919, Paul Levi, the head of the KPD leadership, pushed through a new party line that followed the Comintern&#x27;s policies. This line called for participation in parliamentary elections and fighting for control of established labor unions. In effect, this forced the left majority out of the party and about half of its 100,000 members left. In April 1920, the left formed the Communist Workers&#x27; Party of Germany (KAPD) with an initial membership of about 38,000. The move was partly motivated by the fact that the left perceived the KPD&#x27;s reaction to the Kapp Putsch as weak. The same year, the General Workers&#x27; Union of Germany (AAUD) was formed as a revolutionary labor union partly modeled on the American Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). It was seen by some as the union federation affiliate of the KAPD.

In 1918, Gorter wrote the pamphlet &quot;The World Revolution&quot; pointing to differences between the situations in Russia and Western Europe. Pannekoek asserted in &quot;World Revolution and Communist Tactics&quot;, a pamphlet he published in 1920, that communist tactics in Western Europe were necessarily different from those in Russia. He argued that in Western Europe the bourgeoisie was more established and experienced and that as a result class struggle must oppose bourgeois institutions such as parliaments and trade unions. He emphasized the importance of class consciousness among the masses and deemed the avant-garde party model advocated by the Bolsheviks a potential obstacle to revolution.

Immediately after the KAPD&#x27;s formation, it sought admission to the Comintern. At the Second World Congress of the Comintern in 1920, the Comintern leaders Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Grigory Zinoviev unanimously rejected the KAPD&#x27;s positions. An open letter by the Comintern&#x27;s executive committee informed the KAPD that the Comintern fully supported the KPD in its dispute with the left. Some KAPD delegates left the congress early in protest. Lenin criticized the KAPD, Pannekoek, and other left groups in the 1920 pamphlet &quot;&quot;Left-Wing&quot; Communism: An Infantile Disorder&quot;, accusing them of spreading confusion. He claimed that a refusal to work in parliaments and labor unions would leave workers under the influence of reactionary leaders. He conceded that there were considerable differences between Russia and the more advanced countries in Western Europe, but held that &quot;it is the Russian model that reveals to all countries something – and something highly significant – of their near and inevitable future&quot; and that certain features of the Russian Revolution were universally valid. Gorter took on the task of answering Lenin. His &quot;Open Letter to Comrade Lenin&quot; reiterated the argument that the differences in the class structure between East and West necessitated differences in communist tactics.

Despite this dispute, the KAPD, and other similar groups, initially sought to change the international communist movement from within. At the Third World Congress of the Comintern in 1921, the KAPD failed to rally a left opposition and therefore withdrew from the International. The council communist critique of Bolshevism became more fundamental. Council communists concluded that the Bolsheviks were not in fact building socialism. In 1921, Pannekoek argued that the Russian Revolution was but a bourgeois revolution like the French Revolution. Gorter characterized it as initially a dual revolution, a working-class revolution against capitalism and a capitalist revolution against feudalism, but argued that this dualism was resolved with the New Economic Policy of 1921 and that Soviet Russia had become unambiguously a capitalist state. 

By 1921, council communism had broken with the official communist movement and formed a distinct current, according to the historian Marcel van der Linden. Many authors agree with van der Linden in dating the emergence of council communism to the early 1920s, but others, like Philippe Bourrinet and John Gerber, refer to the tendency as the Dutch–German form of left communism during this period and date the advent of council communism to the 1930s. According to Frits Kool, the term &quot;council communism&quot; was first used by Franz Pfemfert in 1921. According to van der Linden, council communism was defined by five basic principles:
*Capitalism was in decline and had to be abolished immediately.
*It had to be replaced by workers&#x27; control over the economy through council democracy.
*The bourgeoisie manipulated the working class with its social democratic allies in order to maintain capitalism.
*This manipulation must be resisted by boycotting electoral politics and fighting traditional labor unions.
*The Soviet Union was not an alternative to capitalism, but a new type of capitalism.
The German and Dutch left was part of a broader left communist movement that pushed back against the imposition of the Bolshevik model on Western Europe. In Vienna, Georg Lukács emphasized the importance of the spontaneity of the working class. In Italy, Amadeo Bordiga was opposed to electoral politics, but had little regard for councils as the basis for a reorganization of society and advocated vanguard parties as Lenin did. In Russia, the Workers&#x27; Opposition criticized the bureaucratization of working-class organizations and sympathized with the KAPD.

According to Hans Manfred Bock, the leadership of the German council communist movement consisted mostly of intellectuals who had already been part of the left wing of the SPD before World War I as well as younger intellectuals, people with a Bohemian background and academics, who were radicalized by the war. Its membership consisted mostly of younger workers who had not been politically active before the war and former soldiers embittered by the brutality of the war.

In September 1921, the Communist Workers&#x27; Party of the Netherlands (KAPN) was formed as a Dutch analog to the KAPD. Gorter was supportive of this decision and became its chief spokesman, but Pannekoek was skeptical because he felt conditions for a new organization were not ripe in the Netherlands. The KAPN was modeled on the KAPD and its program was nearly identical to the German party&#x27;s. It did not, however, manage to replicate the KAPD&#x27;s mass base and never had more than 200 members. In Bulgaria, too, there was a left communist wing in the Communist Party. Led by Ivan Ganchev and influenced by the KAPD, the left formed the Bulgarian Communist Workers&#x27; Party (BRKP) in January 1922. It had just over a thousand members, mostly workers and few intellectuals. In the United Kingdom, the former suffragist Sylvia Pankhurst, also opposed to parliamentary politics, was excluded from the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in September 1921. She formed the Communist Workers&#x27; Party (CWP) in February 1922. It claimed to have 500 members, but likely had far fewer.

===Decline===
From its inception, the KAPD was beset by disputes and internal turmoil. The party was composed of a wide variety of political tendencies and it did not create stable organizations, as its proponents feared they could become bureaucratic and hold back the working class&#x27;s revolutionary dynamic. As Weimar Germany stabilized in the early 1920s and the council movement of the German Revolution ebbed, the disputes became more pronounced.

As early as the KAPD&#x27;s founding congress, Rühle and Franz Pfemfert, the editor of the journal &quot;Die Aktion&quot;, were opposed to any centralized party structures and the traditional division of the labor movement into political parties and economic labor unions. In his 1920 brochure &quot;Revolution is not a Party Matter&quot;, Rühle argued that the goal of the revolutionary movement was to take over production and therefore had no need for a party, which would necessarily become opportunist. Accordingly, Rühle and his supporters left the KAPD in November 1920 and, when it became clear that the pro-KAPD faction was in control of the AAUD in June 1921, they set up the AAUD–Unitary Organization (AAUD–E). The AAUD–E criticized the KAPD for differing from the KPD only in its rejection of parliamentarianism. At the KAPD&#x27;s second congress in August 1920, the National Bolshevik wing of the party was expelled. This wing was led by Heinrich Laufenberg and Fritz Wolffheim. They supported a strong German nation that, after a successful proletarian revolution, would ally itself with the Soviet Union in a struggle against Western capital and militarism. They also invoked anti-Semitic stereotypes in their critique of Paul Levi, claiming that &quot;because Levi is a Jew, he will play the card of Jewish finance-capital&quot;.

The next major dispute in the KAPD concerned the formation of a new International opposed to the Comintern, the participation of the AAUD in wage struggles, and the role of the party&#x27;s leadership around Karl Schröder. Schröder&#x27;s leadership in the KAPD became increasingly controversial and he was perceived by some as attempting to exert dictatorial control. Politically, Schröder&#x27;s faction argued that capitalism was in a final crisis that would lead to its demise, but that workers were not yet ready for capitalism&#x27;s end as they were still under the control of reformist leaders. From this they concluded that the KAPD&#x27;s role was to firmly adhere to strict revolutionary principles so it could lead workers at a later time. Schröder&#x27;s opponents agreed that capitalism was in decline, but for them this implied the necessity of a struggle to win workers over and they were more open to flexibility in tactics such as participation in wage struggles, which Schröder dismissed as reformism. In March 1922, this dispute led to a split into an Essen tendency, led by Schröder, and a Berlin tendency, each with its own AAUD affiliate. The Berlin tendency was stronger, but most intellectuals in the KAPD including Gorter joined the Essen tendency. Pannekoek was exasperated by the factionalism in the movement and stayed out of the dispute, though he mostly sympathized with the Berlin tendency.

After the KAPD withdrew from the Comintern in 1921, its leadership decided to make plans for the formation of a new International. Schröder and Gorter supported this, but many in the organization were skeptical that the time was right for this move. In April 1922, after the party split, the Essen KAPD and the KAPN formed the Communist Workers&#x27; International (KAI). The BRKP and the CWP joined later. The KAI also claimed to have a Russian affiliate, but in reality it only consisted of two Russians living in Berlin. Gorter wrote the KAI&#x27;s program. Its organizational structure was similar to the Comintern&#x27;s, but it never attained any significant influence or activity. The split in the KAPD was replicated in the Bulgarian and Dutch organizations, as groups in each party supported the Essen KAPD and others the Berlin KAPD.

After 1922, the council communist organizations declined and disintegrated. The German organizations were down to 20,000 supporters in 1923 and just a few hundred by 1933. The Essen KAPD declined most quickly. In 1923, a faction left to form the League of Council Communists, most of whose members then joined the AAUD–E. In 1925, the Essen KAPD&#x27;s main leaders including Schröder left to rejoin the SPD as they thought the revival of the council movement of the revolutionary period unlikely. In 1927, Gorter died and by 1929 the group could not afford to publish its newspaper. The Berlin KAPD, having lost its leadership and theorists to the Essen KAPD, spent the next years issuing repeated and widely ignored calls for insurrection. In 1927, it lost its AAUD affiliate which declared itself a party in its own right. The AAUD–E quickly became an assortment of individual groups and tendencies rather than a coherent organization. It lost its leading theorist Rühle in 1925, when he concluded that the political situation was too reactionary for revolutionary politics. In 1927, it merged with a group excluded from the KPD and a union organization to form the Spartacist League of Left Communist Organizations, which in turn merged with the Berlin AAUD in 1931 to create the Communist Workers&#x27; Union of Germany, but this organization had a membership of just 343.

By the early 1930s, council communism as a large-scale movement had come to an end. According to John Gerber, council communism was a product of the post-war turmoil and, as a result of the end of the council movement, the council communists&#x27; politics became abstract. He also attributes council communism&#x27;s decline as a mass movement to failures by its proponents. They did not develop a politics that could survive under a stabilized capitalism. Council communists did not gain an understanding of the composition of the council movement, the reasons for its decline, and the influence of Leninism and democracy on workers. All this was exacerbated, according to Gerber, by council communists&#x27; dogmatism and a lack of leadership at the lower levels.

===Continuation in small groups===
After the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933, organized council communism disappeared, although a few groups continued in the resistance to the regime. It continued in several small groups in the Netherlands. The Group of International Communists (GIC) became a coordinating center for international debates until the late 1930s. It published the movement&#x27;s central texts, most prominently Henk Canne Meijer&#x27;s &quot;The Rise of a New Labour Movement&quot; and Helmut Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Theses on Bolshevism&quot;. Council communists popped up in several other countries. The German emigrant Paul Mattick brought it to the United States where he published the &quot;International Council Correspondence&quot;. J.A. Dawson published the &quot;Southern Advocate of Workers&#x27; Councils&quot; in Australia and Laín Diez published council communist texts in Chile.

The 1960s student movement led to a brief resurgence of council communism, mainly in France, Italy, and Germany. After the decline of the 1968 movement, it mostly disappeared again, but for a few small groups in Europe and North America.

== Theory ==
While sharing a common general direction, council communists differed widely in their views on many issues.

In contrast to reformist social democracy and to Leninism, the central argument of council communism is that democratic workers councils arising in factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organisation and governmental power, maintaining that the working class should not rely on Leninist vanguard parties or reforms of the capitalist system to bring socialism. Alternatively, the party would maintain a propagandic and &quot;minoritarian&quot; role. Council communists see the mass strike and new yet to emerge forms of mass action as revolutionary means to achieve a communist society. Where the network of worker councils would be the main vehicle for revolution, acting as the apparatus by which the dictatorship of the proletariat forms and operates.

The government and the economy should be managed by workers&#x27; councils composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose authoritarian socialism. They also oppose the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a party-led revolution will necessarily produce a party dictatorship.

Council communism and other types of libertarian Marxism such as autonomism are often viewed as being similar to anarchism due to similar criticisms of Leninist ideologies for being authoritarian and the rejection of the idea of a vanguard party. As such, it is referred to as anti-authoritarian and anti-Leninist Marxism.

<text>Tsuen Wan New Town is a new town in Hong Kong. It spans Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung and the eastern part of Tsing Yi Island. Traditionally, the administrative officials of Tsuen Wan managed the area of Tsuen Wan proper, Kwai Chung, Tsing Yi Island, Ma Wan and Northeast Lantau Island. Its total development area is about . The population of the new town is approximately 801,800, with the planned capacity being 845,000.

Development of the Tsuen Wan satellite town commenced in the 1950s, along with Kwun Tong satellite town. In 1961, the government of Hong Kong decided to expand the satellite town into neighbouring Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi, and Tsuen Wan New Town was established as the first new town in Hong Kong. In 1982, the Tsuen Wan District was created under the District Administration Scheme. In 1985, with the explosion of population in the new town, Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi were spun off to form the new Kwai Tsing District. Thus, the town is now under two administrative districts. In some recent official reports, Kwai Chung New Town and Tsing Yi New Town are separated from Tsuen Wan New Town.

Despite being a part of the New Territories, the town is also considered a part of the Hong Kong metro area by the Planning Department and Urban Renewal Authority. Along with Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, it is the only area in the New Territories classified as the core urban area of Hong Kong. Part of this is because the town was developed early and is not geographically separated from Kowloon by hills. Also, there are no New Territories taxis service within most parts of the town, unlike other new towns in the New Territories.

<doc id="302256" wikidata="Q2549288" url="?curid=302256" title="Commodity fetishism">
<text>In Marxist philosophy, commodity fetishism is the perception of the economic relationships of production and exchange as relationships among things (money and merchandise) rather than among people. As a form of reification, commodity fetishism presents economic value as inherent to the commodities, and not as arising from the workforce, from the human relations that produced the commodity, the goods and the services.

== Concept ==
In the first chapter of &quot;Capital: A Critique of Political Economy&quot; (1867), commodity fetishism is used to explain how the social organization of labour manifests in the buying and selling of commodities (goods and services). In the marketplace, social relations among people—who makes what, who works for whom, the production-time for a commodity, etc.—are represented as social relations among objects.

In the process of commercial exchange, commodities appear in a depersonalized form, obscuring the social relations inherent to their production. Marx explained the sociology of commodity fetishism:

According to Marx, the operation of commodity fetishism requires the owners of capital to actively ignore or maintain an indifference to the relational whole that produces a commodity.

==Development==
The theory of commodity fetishism () originated from Karl Marx&#x27;s references to &quot;fetishes&quot; and &quot;fetishism&quot; in his analyses of religious superstition, and in the criticism of the beliefs of political economists. Marx borrowed the concept of &quot;fetishism&quot; from &quot;The Cult of Fetish Gods&quot; (1760) by Charles de Brosses, which proposed a materialist theory of the origin of religion. Moreover, in the 1840s, the philosophic discussion of fetishism by Auguste Comte, and Ludwig Feuerbach&#x27;s psychological interpretation of religion also influenced Marx&#x27;s development of commodity fetishism.

Marx&#x27;s first mention of fetishism appeared in 1842, in his response to a newspaper article by Karl Heinrich Hermes, which defended Germany on religious grounds. Hermes agreed with the German philosopher Hegel in regarding fetishism as the crudest form of religion. Marx dismissed that argument and Hermes&#x27;s definition of religion as that which elevates man &quot;above sensuous appetites&quot;. Instead, Marx said that fetishism is &quot;the religion of sensuous appetites&quot;, and that the fantasy of the appetites tricks the fetish worshipper into believing that an inanimate object will yield its natural character to gratify the desires of the worshipper. Therefore, the crude appetite of the fetish worshipper smashes the fetish when it ceases to be of service.

The next mention of fetishism was in the 1842 &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; newspaper articles about the &quot;Debates on the Law on Thefts of Wood&quot;, wherein Marx spoke of the Spanish fetishism of gold and the German fetishism of wood as commodities:
In the &quot;Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844&quot;, Marx spoke of the European fetish of precious-metal money:
In the ethnological notebooks, he commented upon the archaeological reportage of &quot;The Origin of Civilization and the Primitive Condition of Man: Mental and Social conditions of Savages&quot; (1870), by John Lubbock. In the &quot;Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy&quot; (Grundrisse, 1859), he criticized the liberal arguments of the French economist Frédéric Bastiat; and about fetishes and fetishism Marx said:
In &quot;A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy&quot; (1859), Marx referred to &quot;A Discourse on the Rise, Progress, Peculiar Objects, and Importance of Political Economy&quot; (1825), by John Ramsay McCulloch, who said that &quot;In its natural state, matter ... is always destitute of value&quot;, with which Marx concurred, saying that &quot;this shows how high even a McCulloch stands above the fetishism of German &#x27;thinkers&#x27; who assert that &#x27;material&#x27;, and half a dozen similar irrelevancies are elements of value&quot;.

Furthermore, in the manuscript of &quot;Results of the Immediate Process of Production&quot; (c. 1864), an appendix to &quot;Capital: Critique of Political Economy, Volume 1&quot; (1867), Marx said that:
Hence did Karl Marx apply the concepts of &quot;fetish&quot; and &quot;fetishism&quot;, derived from economic and ethnologic studies, to the development of the theory of commodity fetishism, wherein an economic abstraction (value) is psychologically transformed (reified) into an object, which people choose to believe has an intrinsic value, in and of itself.

==Critique==
===In the critique of political economy===

Marx proposed that in a society where independent, private producers trade their products with each other, of their own volition and initiative, and without much coordination of market exchange, the volumes of production and commercial activities are adjusted in accordance with the &quot;fluctuating values&quot; of the products (goods and services) as they are bought and sold, and in accordance with the fluctuations of supply and demand. Because their social coexistence, and its meaning, is expressed through market exchange (trade and transaction), people have no other relations with each other. Therefore, social relations are continually mediated and expressed with objects (commodities and money). How the traded commodities relate will depend upon the costs of production, which are reducible to quantities of human labour, although the worker has no control over what happens to the commodities that they produce. (See: &quot;Entfremdung&quot;, Marx&#x27;s theory of alienation)

===Domination of things===
The concept of the &quot;intrinsic value&quot; of commodities (goods and services) determines and dominates the economic (business) relationships among people, to the extent that buyers and sellers continually adjust their beliefs (financial expectations) about the value of things—either consciously or unconsciously—to the proportionate price changes (market value) of the commodities over which buyers and sellers believe they have no true control. That psychologic perception transforms the trading-value of a commodity into an independent entity (an object), to the degree that the social value of the goods and services appears to be a natural property of the commodity itself. Thence objectified, &quot;the market&quot; appears as if self-regulated (by fluctuating supply and demand) because, in pursuit of profit, the consumers of the products ceased to perceive the human co-operation among capitalists that is the true engine of the market where commodities are bought and sold; such is the domination of things in the market.

===Objectified value===
The value of a commodity originates from the human being&#x27;s intellectual and perceptual capacity to consciously (subjectively) ascribe a relative value (importance) to a commodity, the goods and services manufactured by the labour of a worker. Therefore, in the course of the economic transactions (buying and selling) that constitute market exchange, people ascribe &quot;subjective&quot; values to the commodities, which the buyers and the sellers then perceive as &quot;objective&quot; values, the market-exchange prices that people will pay for the commodities.

===Naturalization of market behaviour===
In a capitalist society, the human perception that &quot;the market&quot; is an independent, sentient entity, is how buyers, sellers, and producers naturalize market exchange (the human choices and decisions that constitute commerce) as a series of &quot;natural phenomena ... that ... happen of their own accord&quot;. Such were the political-economy arguments of the economists whom Karl Marx criticized when they spoke of the &quot;natural equilibria&quot; of markets, as if the price (value) of a commodity were independent of the volition and initiative of the capitalist producers, buyers, and sellers of commodities.

In the 18th century, the Scottish social philosopher and political economist Adam Smith, in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776) proposed that the &quot;truck, barter, and exchange&quot; activities of the market were corresponding economic representations of human nature, that is, the buying and selling of commodities were activities intrinsic to the market, and thus are the &quot;natural behaviour&quot; of the market. Hence, Smith proposed that a market economy was a self-regulating entity that &quot;naturally&quot; tended towards economic equilibrium, wherein the relative prices (the value) of a commodity ensured that the buyers and sellers obtained what they wanted for and from their goods and services.

In the 19th century, Karl Marx contradicted the artifice of Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;naturalisation of the market&#x27;s behaviour&quot; as a politico-ideologic apology—by and for the capitalists—which allowed human economic choices and decisions to be misrepresented as fixed &quot;facts of life&quot;, rather than as the human actions that resulted from the will of the producers, the buyers, and the sellers of the commodities traded at market. Such &quot;immutable economic laws&quot; are what &quot;Capital: Critique of Political Economy&quot; (1867) revealed about the functioning of the capitalist mode of production, how goods and services (commodities) are circulated among a society; and thus explain the psychological phenomenon of commodity fetishism, which ascribes an independent, objective value and reality to a thing that has no inherent value—other than the value given to it by the producer, the seller, and the buyer of the commodity.

===Masking===
In a capitalist economy, a character mask (&quot;Charaktermaske&quot;) is the functional role with which a person relates and is related to in a society composed of stratified social classes, especially in relationships and market-exchange transactions; thus, in the course of buying and selling, the commodities (goods and services) usually appear other than they are, because they are masked (obscured) by the role-playing of the buyer and the seller. Moreover, because the capitalist economy of a class society is an intrinsically contradictory system, the masking of the true socio-economic character of the transaction is an integral feature of its function and operation as market exchange. In the course of business competition among themselves, buyers, sellers, and producers cannot do business (compete) without obscurity—confidentiality and secrecy—thus the necessity of the character masks that obscure true economic motive.

Central to the Marxist critique of political economy is the obscurantism of the juridical labour contract, between the worker and the capitalist, that masks the true, exploitive nature of their economic relationship—that the worker does not sell his and her labour, but that the worker sells individual labour power, the human capacity to perform work and manufacture commodities (goods and services) that yield a profit to the producer. The work contract is the mask that obscures the economic exploitation of the difference between the wages paid for the labour of the worker, and the new value created by the labour of the worker.

Marx thus established that in a capitalist society the creation of wealth is based upon &quot;the paid and unpaid portions of labour [that] are inseparably mixed up with each other, and the nature of the whole transaction is completely masked by the intervention of a contract, and the pay received at the end of the week&quot;; and that:
===Opacity of economic relations===
The primary valuation of the trading-value of goods and services (commodities) is expressed as money-prices. The buyers and the sellers determine and establish the economic and financial relationships; and afterwards compare the prices in and the price trends of the market. Moreover, because of the masking of true economic motive, neither the buyer, nor the seller, nor the producer perceive and understand every human labour-activity required to deliver the commodities (goods and services), nor do they perceive the workers whose labour facilitated the purchase of commodities. The economic results of such collective human labour are expressed as the &quot;values&quot; and the &quot;prices&quot; of the commodities; the value-relations between the amount of human labour and the value of the supplied commodity.

===Capitalism as religion===

In the essay &quot;Capitalism as Religion&quot; (1921), Walter Benjamin said that whether or not people treat capitalism as a religion was a moot subject, because &quot;One can behold in capitalism a religion, that is to say, capitalism essentially serves to satisfy the same worries, anguish, and disquiet formerly answered by so-called religion.&quot; That the religion of capitalism is manifest in four tenets:

==Applications==
===Cultural theory===
Since the 19th century, when Karl Marx presented the theory of commodity fetishism, in Section 4, &quot;The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret thereof&quot;, of the first chapter of &quot;Capital: Critique of Political Economy&quot; (1867), the constituent concepts of the theory, and their sociologic and economic explanations, have proved intellectually fertile propositions that permit the application of the theory (interpretation, development, adaptation) to the study, examination, and analysis of other cultural aspects of the political economy of capitalism, such as:

====Social prestige====
In the 19th century, Thorstein Veblen (&quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions&quot;, 1899) developed the social status (prestige) relationship between the producer of consumer goods and the aspirations to prestige of the consumer. To avoid the status anxiety of not being of or belonging to &quot;the right social class&quot;, the consumer establishes a personal identity (social, economic, cultural) that is defined and expressed by the commodities (goods and services) that they buy, own, and use; the domination of things that communicate the &quot;correct signals&quot; of social prestige, of belonging. (See: Conspicuous consumption.)

====Reification====
In &quot;History and Class Consciousness&quot; (1923), György Lukács started from the theory of commodity fetishism for his development of reification (the psychological transformation of an abstraction into a concrete object) as the principal obstacle to class consciousness. About which Lukács said: &quot;Just as the capitalist system continuously produces and reproduces itself economically on higher levels, the structure of reification progressively sinks more deeply, more fatefully, and more definitively into the consciousness of Man&quot;—hence, commodification pervaded every conscious human activity, as the growth of capitalism commodified every sphere of human activity into a product that can be bought and sold in the market. (See: &quot;Verdinglichung&quot;, Marx&#x27;s theory of reification.)

====Industrialized culture====
Commodity fetishism is theoretically central to the Frankfurt School philosophy, especially in the work of the sociologist Theodor W. Adorno, which describes &quot;how&quot; the forms of commerce invade the human psyche; how commerce casts a person into a role not of his or her making; and how commercial forces affect the development of the psyche. In the book &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; (1944), Adorno and Max Horkheimer presented the Theory of the Culture Industry to describe how the human imagination (artistic, spiritual, intellectual activity) becomes commodified when subordinated to the &quot;natural commercial laws&quot; of the market.

To the consumer, the cultural goods and services sold in the market appear to offer the promise of a richly developed and creative individuality, yet the inherent commodification severely restricts and stunts the human psyche, so that the man and the woman consumer has little &quot;time for myself&quot;, because of the continual personification of cultural roles over which he and she exercise little control. In personifying such cultural identities, the person is a passive consumer, not the active creator, of his or her life; the promised life of individualistic creativity is incompatible with the collectivist, commercial norms of bourgeois culture.

In &quot;Capital, Volume 1&quot;, Marx remarked that &quot;In bourgeois society the legal fiction prevails that each person, as a buyer, has an encyclopedic knowledge of commodities&quot;. From 2017 onward, however, the world&#x27;s consumers can use the Google Lens app on their mobile phone, to scan any object in order to find out information and prices for that object (or a very similar object). According to a survey by financial services firm Empower, Americans nowadays spend 2.5 hours a day, or 873 hours per year, on &quot;dreamscrolling&quot; (i.e digital window shopping and gazing at dream purchases).

====Commodity narcissism====
In the study &quot;From Commodity Fetishism to Commodity Narcissism&quot; (2012) the investigators applied the Marxist theory of commodity fetishism to psychologically analyse the economic behaviour (buying and selling) of the contemporary consumer. With the concept of commodity narcissism, the psychologists Stephen Dunne and Robert Cluley proposed that consumers who claim to be ethically concerned about the manufacturing origin of commodities, nonetheless behaved as if ignorant of the exploitative labour conditions under which the workers produced the goods and services, bought by the &quot;concerned consumer&quot;; that, within the culture of consumerism, narcissistic men and women have established shopping (economic consumption) as a socially acceptable way to express aggression. Researchers find no evidence that a greater manufacturing base can spur economic growth, while improving government effectiveness and regulation quality are more promising for facilitating economic growth.

==== Ethical consumption ====
Environmentally &quot;conscious&quot; consumers want their purchased products to be environmentally ethical. According to James G. Carrier, on a personal level their purchases can make them feel more positively moral and second they can help put pressure on firms in a competitive market to change the way they do things. Marx&#x27;s 1867 notion of commodity fetishism which concerns the idea that ethical consumption is going beyond the two reasons first noted by Carrier. Certain commodities are perceived in a particular way that the consumer ignores or denies the labor time entailed in the process of production or for that matter any detailed background people and process that is viable in creating an ethical product. Capitalists have the intention of selling to an audience with commercial gain - the use of nature as a strategy is vital in urging people to buy their product. Ethical consumption is mostly concerned with the social, political and environmental context of objects - and consumers want a product that meets their moral criteria, something non-exploitative. These baseline concepts need to be visible and eye-catching with recognizable verifications. This is very common in ecotourism who produce eco-friendliness as a reason to buy and visit. Advertising protection and conservation attracts visitors and media attention. These capitalists make no point to vary in their images and photographs or captions - the repetition of nature is always colorful and vibrant, gentle and reserved. They are &quot;fetishizing&quot; nature as a marketing technique. Portraying themselves as a business that protects nature satisfies their clientele so that the consumer cannot see the objects and mechanisms used to actually produce it. Carrier describes how the environment itself is fetishized as a consumable product through parks and other areas of land being used as bodies or images attached to promises of natural experiences or protection efforts in return for money. Carrier also offers the example of fair-trade coffee as a way that commodity fetishism is seen in ethical consumption. If fair-trade coffee promises that it is direct, cooperative supply chain between growers and consumers through images of coffee growers and messaging on the bag of coffee, this becomes more relevant to consumer decision making than the reality that many other &quot;middle-men&quot; were needing in the roasting, packaging, marketing, and transportation of that commodity.

Ethical consumption is believed by advocates of the theory to allow people to lead more moral lives as well as affect the world by placing economic pressure on firms to change their production processes and products to become more ethical to remain competitive within the greater market. The fetishization of nature and natural resources often leads through its commodification as a product to be advertised. Conceptual categories need to be &quot;legible, be visible and recognizable&quot; in order to be effective as ethical standards. The advertising on items listed and named as fair trade often misrepresents the actual production process, especially in products requiring extensive and hard labor to produce, such as coffee. It also often becomes exploitative as it uses the images of ethnic small holders rather than the ethnic migrants and wage laborers who do the majority of the work. The use of images not only fetishizes the product, but defines ethicality as a whole. A common narrative now is whether or not ethical consumption is at all possible in a globalized world of highly interconnected capitalism and trade. It relies on ideas of greenwashing in which producers use environmentalism and fair trade ideals to advertise their products without living up to the ideals. The false image of environmentalism disguises the unsustainable practices being utilized. Another critique is the overall effectiveness of individual consumer choices without large-scale systemic change through government regulation. Accessibility is another issue, as ethical products are often more expensive and less accessible to low-income activists.

==== Social alienation ====

In &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; (1967), Guy Debord presented the theory of &quot;le spectacle&quot;—the systematic conflation of advanced capitalism, the mass communications media, and a government amenable to exploiting those factors. The spectacle transforms human relations into objectified relations among images, and vice versa; the exemplar spectacle is television, the communications medium wherein people passively allow (cultural) representations of themselves to become the active agents of their beliefs. The spectacle is the form that society assumes when the Arts, the instruments of cultural production, have been commodified as commercial activities that render an aesthetic value into a commercial value (a commodity). Whereby artistic expression then is shaped by the person&#x27;s ability to sell it as a commodity, that is, as artistic goods and services.

Capitalism reorganizes personal consumption to conform to the commercial principles of market exchange; commodity fetishism transforms a cultural commodity into a product with an economic &quot;life of its own&quot; that is independent of the volition and initiative of the artist, the producer of the commodity. What Karl Marx critically anticipated in the 19th century, with &quot;The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret thereof&quot;, Guy Debord interpreted and developed for the 20th century—that in modern society, the psychologic intimacies of intersubjectivity and personal self-relation are commodified into discrete &quot;experiences&quot; that can be bought and sold. The Society of the Spectacle is the ultimate form of social alienation that occurs when a person views his or her being (self) as a commodity that can be bought and sold, because they regard every human relation as a (potential) business transaction. (See: &quot;Entfremdung&quot;, Marx&#x27;s theory of alienation)

====Semiotic sign====
Jean Baudrillard applied commodity fetishism to explain the subjective feelings of men and women towards consumer goods in the &quot;realm of circulation&quot;; that is, the cultural mystique (mystification) that advertising ascribed to the commodities (goods and services) in order to encourage the buyer to purchase the goods and services as aids to the construction of his and her cultural identity. In the book &quot;For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign&quot; (1972), Baudrillard developed the semiotic theory of &quot;the Sign&quot; (sign value) as a development of Marx&#x27;s theory of commodity fetishism and of the exchange value &quot;vs.&quot; use value dichotomy of capitalism.

===Intellectual property===
In the 21st century, the political economy of capitalism reified the abstract objects that are information and knowledge into the tangible commodities of intellectual property, which are produced by and derived from the labours of the intellectual and the white collar workers.

====Philosophic base====
The economist Michael Perelman critically examined the belief systems from which arose intellectual property rights, the field of law that commodified knowledge and information. Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis critically reviewed the belief systems of the theory of human capital. Knowledge, as the philosophic means to a better life, is contrasted with capitalist knowledge (as commodity and capital), produced to generate income and profit. Such commodification detaches knowledge and information from the (user) person, because, as intellectual property, they are independent, economic entities.

====Knowledge: authentic and counterfeit====
In &quot;Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&quot; (1991), the Marxist theorist Fredric Jameson linked the reification of information and knowledge to the post-modern distinction between &quot;authentic knowledge&quot; (experience) and &quot;counterfeit knowledge&quot; (vicarious experience), which usually is acquired through the mass communications media. In &quot;Critique of Commodity Aesthetics: Appearance, Sexuality and Advertising in Capitalist Society&quot; (1986), the philosopher Wolfgang Fritz Haug presents a &quot;critique of commodity aesthetics&quot; that examines how human needs and desires are manipulated and reshaped for commercial gain.

====Financial risk management====
The sociologists Frank Furedi and Ulrich Beck studied the development of commodified types of knowledge in the business culture of &quot;risk prevention&quot; in the management of money. The Post–World War II economic expansion (c. 1945–1973) created very much money (capital and savings), while the dominant bourgeois ideology of money favoured the risk-management philosophy of the managers of investment funds and financial assets. From such administration of investment money, manipulated to create new capital, arose the preoccupation with risk calculations, which subsequently was followed by the &quot;economic science&quot; of risk prevention management. In light of which, the commodification of money as &quot;financial investment funds&quot; allows an ordinary person to pose as a rich person, as an economic risk-taker able to risk losing money invested to the market. Hence, the fetishization of financial risk as &quot;a sum of money&quot; is a reification that distorts the social perception of the true nature of financial risk, as experienced by ordinary people. Moreover, the valuation of financial risk is susceptible to ideological bias; that contemporary fortunes are achieved from the insight of experts in financial management, who study the relationship between &quot;known&quot; and &quot;unknown&quot; economic factors, by which human fears about money can be manipulated and exploited.

====Commodified art====
The cultural critics Georg Simmel and Walter Benjamin examined and described the fetishes and fetishism of art, by means of which &quot;artistic&quot; commodities are produced for sale in the market, and how commodification determines and establishes the value of the artistic commodities (goods and services) derived from legitimate Art; for example, the selling of an artist&#x27;s personal effects as &quot;artistic fetishes&quot;.

====Legal traducement====
In the field of law, the scholar Evgeny Pashukanis (&quot;The General Theory of Law and Marxism&quot;, 1924), the Austrian politician Karl Renner, the German political scientist Franz Leopold Neumann, the British socialist writer China Miéville, the labour-law attorney Marc Linder, and the American legal philosopher Duncan Kennedy (&quot;The Role of Law in Economic Theory: Essays on the Fetishism of Commodities&quot;, 1985) have respectively explored the applications of commodity fetishism in their contemporary legal systems, and reported that the reification of legal forms misrepresents social relations.

==Criticism==
In &quot;Portrait of a Marxist as a Young Nun&quot; (1988), Professor Helena Sheehan said that the analogy between religious faith and commodity fetishism is a mistaken interpretation, because people do not worship commodities (money and merchandise) by attributing supernatural powers to inanimate objects, to a fetish. That the belief that value-relationships inherent to a commodity described is not religious belief, because value-relations do not possess the psychological characteristics of spiritual beliefs. That interpretation is proved by the possibility of a person&#x27;s possessing religious faith, whilst being aware of the psychology of commodity fetishism, and thus being critical of the fetishization of money and merchandise, thus, a person&#x27;s disbelief in the golden calf is integral to the person&#x27;s iconoclasm against the idolatry of money.

<text>Wayne State University (WSU) is a public research university in Detroit, Michigan, United States. Founded in 1868, Wayne State consists of 13 schools and colleges offering approximately 375 programs. It is Michigan&#x27;s third-largest university with nearly 24,000 graduate and undergraduate students. Wayne State University, along with the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, compose the University Research Corridor of Michigan. Wayne State is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

Wayne State&#x27;s main campus comprises 203 acres linking more than 100 education and research buildings. It also has three satellite campuses in Macomb and Wayne counties. The Wayne State Warriors compete in the NCAA Division II Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC).

==History==

Wayne State University was established in 1868 as the Detroit Medical College by five returning Civil War veterans. The college charter from 1868 was signed by founder Theodore Andrews McGraw, M.D., a University of Michigan graduate (B.A. 1859). In 1885, the Detroit College of Medicine merged with its competitor, the Michigan College of Medicine and they consolidated buildings. After the reorganization, McGraw became the first president and dean. The institutions evolved into the Wayne State University School of Medicine.

In 1881, the Detroit Normal Training School for Teachers was established by the Detroit Board of Education. In 1920, after several relocations to larger quarters, the school became the Detroit Teachers College. The Board of Education voted in 1924 to make the college a part of the new College of the City of Detroit. Eventually it became the Wayne State University College of Education.

In 1917, the Detroit Board of Education founded the Detroit Junior College and would make Detroit Central High School&#x27;s Old Main Hall its campus. Detroit&#x27;s College of Pharmacy and the Detroit Teachers College were added to the campus in 1924, and were organized into the College of the City of Detroit. The original junior college became the College of Liberal Arts. The first bachelor&#x27;s degrees were awarded in 1925. The College of Liberal Arts of the College of the City of Detroit became the Wayne State University College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Recognizing the need for a good law school, a group of lawyers, including Allan Campbell, the school&#x27;s founding dean, established Detroit City Law School in 1927 as part of the College of the City of Detroit. Originally structured as a part-time evening program, the school&#x27;s first class graduated with the bachelor of laws degree (LL.B.) in 1928 and achieved full American Bar Association accreditation in 1939. The school became Wayne State University Law School.

In 1933, the Detroit Board of Education voted to unify its colleges into a university. In January 1934, that institution was officially named Wayne University, taking its name from Wayne County (in which both the university and the city of Detroit reside), which was itself named after Revolutionary War Major-General Anthony Wayne. Wayne University added a School of Social Work in 1935, and the School of Business Administration in 1946. Wayne University was renamed Wayne State University in 1956 and the institution became mandated by an amendment to the Michigan Constitution in 1959. The Wayne State University Board of Governors created the Institute of Gerontology in 1965 in response to a State of Michigan mandate. The institute&#x27;s primary mission in that era was to engage in research, education and service in the field of aging. Wayne State University in 1973 added the College of Lifelong Learning. In 1985, the School of Fine and the Performing Arts, and the College of Urban, Labor and Metropolitan Affairs further grew the university.

In the early 21st century, WSU constructed the Integrative Biosciences Center (IBio), a facility for interdisciplinary work in the biosciences. More than 500 researchers, staff and principal investigators work out of the building, which opened in 2016. In 2013, M. Roy Wilson became Wayne State&#x27;s 12th president. In 2018, the new Mike Ilitch School of Business facility opened in The District Detroit.

In 2023, Kimberly Andrews Espy became Wayne State&#x27;s 13th president.

===Media===
The official student newspaper is &quot;The South End&quot;. The university hosts the public radio station WDET and runs the student online radio station WAYN. The WSU Alumni Association publishes the &quot;Wayne State&quot; magazine.

==Athletics==
The school&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic program was established in 1917 by director of athletics David L. Holmes, who initially coached all sports. His track teams were nationally known into the 1950s; in his first 10 years, he produced two Olympians from the school&#x27;s Victorian-era gym. Although he had major ambitions for Wayne and scheduled such teams as Notre Dame and Penn State in the 1920s, the lack of facilities and money for athletics kept the program small.

A student poll selected the name of &quot;Tartars&quot; for the school&#x27;s teams in 1927. In 1999, the university changed the name to the &quot;Warriors.&quot; Wayne State competes in men&#x27;s baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, swimming and diving, and tennis, and women&#x27;s basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.

WSU participates in NCAA Division II in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC) for all sports except for fencing, which competes in the single division Midwest Fencing Conference. The school previously competed in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s NCAA Division I ice hockey as a member of College Hockey America (CHA). The university dropped its men&#x27;s program at the end of the 2007-08 season and the women&#x27;s hockey program was ended in 2011.

<text>Et in Arcadia ego (also known as Les bergers d&#x27;Arcadie or The Arcadian Shepherds) is a 1637–38 painting by Classical painter Nicolas Poussin. It depicts a pastoral scene with idealized shepherds from classical antiquity, and a woman, possibly a shepherdess, gathered around an austere tomb that includes the Latin inscription &quot;Et in Arcadia ego&quot;, which is translated to &quot;Even in Arcadia, there am I&quot;; &quot;Also in Arcadia am I&quot;; or &quot;I too was in Arcadia&quot;. Poussin also painted another version of the subject in 1627 under the same title.

The 1630s version is held in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, while the 1627 version is held at Chatsworth House, England. An earlier treatment of the theme was painted by Guercino –1622, also titled &quot;Et in Arcadia ego&quot;.

==Inspiration==
A tomb with a memorial inscription (to Daphnis) amid the idyllic settings of Arcadia is first described in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot; V 42 ff. Virgil took the idealized Sicilian rustics included in the &quot;Idylls&quot; of Theocritus and set them in the primitive Greek region of Arcadia (see Eclogues VII and X). The idea was taken up anew in the circle of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici in the 1460s and 1470s, during the Florentine Renaissance.

In his pastoral work &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1504), Jacopo Sannazaro fixed the Early Modern perception of Arcadia as a lost world of idyllic bliss, remembered in regretful dirges. The first pictorial representation of the familiar &quot;memento mori&quot; theme, which was popularized in 16th-century Venice, now made more concrete and vivid by the inscription , is Guercino&#x27;s version, painted between 1618 and 1622. (It is held in the Galleria Nazionale d&#x27;Arte Antica, Rome.) The inscription gains force from the prominent presence of a skull in the foreground, beneath which the words are carved.

==1627 version==
Poussin&#x27;s own first version of the painting (now in Chatsworth House) was probably commissioned as a reworking of Guercino&#x27;s version. It is in a more Baroque style than the later version, and is characteristic of Poussin&#x27;s early work. In the Chatsworth painting, the shepherds are discovering the half-hidden and overgrown tomb, and are reading the inscription with curious expressions. The woman, standing at the left, is posed in sexually suggestive fashion, very different from her austere counterpart in the later version, which is based on a statue from antiquity known as the &quot;Cesi Juno&quot;. The later version has a far more geometric composition and the figures are much more contemplative.

==Interpretation==

The literal translation of &quot;Et in Arcadia Ego&quot; is &quot;Even in Arcadia, there am I&quot;. Poussin&#x27;s earliest biographer, Giovanni Pietro Bellori, understood the &#x27;I&#x27; of the phrase to refer to Death, thus making the painting a &quot;memento mori&quot;, reminding the viewer that even in the blissful utopia of Arcadia, death still exists. Another biographer, André Félibien, interpreted the &#x27;I&#x27; to refer to the occupant of the tomb, but still took the overall meaning of the painting to be a reminder that death is present even in idyllic Arcadia.

The most important difference between the two versions is that in the latter version, one of the two shepherds recognizes the shadow of his companion on the tomb and circumscribes the silhouette with his finger. According to an ancient tradition (see Pliny the Elder, &quot;Natural History&quot; XXXV 5, 15), this is the moment in which the art of painting is first discovered. Thus, the shepherd&#x27;s shadow is the first image in art history. But the shadow on the tomb is also a symbol of death (in the first version symbolized by a skull on the top of the tomb). The meaning of this highly intricate composition seems to be that, from prehistory onward, the discovery of art has been the creative response of humankind to the shocking fact of mortality. Thus, death’s claim to rule even Arcadia is challenged by art (symbolized by the beautifully dressed maiden), who must insist that she was discovered in Arcadia too, and that she is the legitimate ruler everywhere, whilst death only usurps its power.

The vagueness of the phrase is the subject of a famous essay by the art historian Erwin Panofsky, who suggested that, compared to Poussin&#x27;s 1627 version, this second version shifted the focus from a warning about the inevitability of death to a contemplation of the past and a sense of nostalgia. In the course of this re-interpretation of his own composition by Poussin himself the meaning of the inscription changed. Notwithstanding the rules of Latin grammar, according to which &quot;et&quot; should be conjuncted with &quot;Arcadia&quot;, not with &quot;ego&quot;, in Panofsky’s view, the speaker now is no longer death, but the dead, who, speaking to the viewer from the tomb, reminds him that he himself once was enjoying his happy life in Arcadia. This new meaning of the second version prepared the way for the translation &quot;Auch ich war in Arkadien (geboren)&quot; (&quot;I, too, was born in Arcadia&quot;) given by Herder, Schiller and Goethe. The sentence now comes out of the viewer’s mouth, which means that he, like every human being, once was born in Arcadia.

==Sculpted versions==
This undated, mid-eighteenth-century marble bas-relief is part of the Shepherds Monument, a garden feature at Shugborough House, Staffordshire, England. Beneath it is the cryptic Shugborough inscription, as yet undeciphered. The reversed composition suggests that it was copied from an engraving, the compositions of which are commonly reversed because direct copies to the plate produce mirror images on printing.

In 1832 another relief was sculpted as part of the monument marking Poussin&#x27;s tomb in Rome, on which it appears beneath a bust of the artist. In the words of art historian Richard Verdi, it appears as if the shepherds are contemplating &quot;their own author&#x27;s death.&quot;

<doc id="302268" wikidata="Q783210" url="?curid=302268" title="Bracknell">
<text>Bracknell () is a town and civil parish in Berkshire, England, the westernmost area within the Greater London Urban Area and the administrative centre of the borough of Bracknell Forest. It lies to the east of Reading, south of Maidenhead, southwest of Windsor and west of central London. Bracknell is the third largest town in Berkshire.

The name Bracknell is derived from the Saxon &quot;Braccan Heal&quot; or &quot;Braccan Heale&quot;, first recorded in a charter boundary of 942 AD. In the Middle Ages, Bracknell developed into two small market villages, Old Bracknoll and New Bracknoll. By the 19th century, the two Bracknells had combined into a single market town, which was an important centre of local industry, most notably for its brick trade. In the 20th century, Bracknell experienced a period of rapid growth after it was declared a New Town. Planned at first for a population of 25,000, Bracknell New Town was further expanded in the 1960s to accommodate a population of 45,000. During this time, Bracknell absorbed many of its surrounding villages including Easthampstead, Ramslade and Old Bracknell. As of 2021, Bracknell Forest has an estimated population of around 113,205. Today, the town is a busy commercial centre within the so-called Silicon Thames Valley and the UK headquarters for several technology companies.

Bracknell is bordered to the south by Swinley Forest and by Crowthorne Woods to the south-east and south. Its neighbouring villages of Binfield, Warfield and Winkfield are part of the borough of Bracknell Forest and are gradually becoming absorbed into the Bracknell metropolitan area. To the east, the urban area joins up with Ascot to form a continuous conurbation that extends to Central London.

==History==

The name Bracknell is first recorded in a Winkfield Boundary Charter of AD 942 as &quot;Braccan heal&quot;, and may mean &quot;Nook of land belonging to a man called Bracca&quot;, from the Old English &quot;Braccan&quot; (genitive singular of a personal name) + &quot;heal, healh&quot; (a corner, nook or secret place). An early form of the town&#x27;s name, &quot;Brakenhale&quot;, still survives as the name of one of its schools. The town covers all of the old village of Easthampstead (though not all of the old parish) and the hamlet of Ramslade.

There is a Bronze Age round barrow at Bill Hill. Easthampstead Park was a favoured royal hunting lodge in Windsor Forest and Catherine of Aragon was banished there until her divorce was finalised. It was later the home of the Trumbulls who were patrons of Alexander Pope from Binfield.

To the north-east of the town, in the suburb of Quelm Park, is the Quelm Stone, a standing stone, and to the south-west, just over the border in Crowthorne, is Caesar&#x27;s Camp, an Iron Age hill fort.

One of the oldest buildings in the town is the &#x27;Old Manor&#x27; public house, a 17th-century brick manor house featuring a number of priest holes. Next door once stood the &#x27;Hind&#x27;s Head&#x27; coaching inn, where it is said Dick Turpin used to drink. It is believed that there were once tunnels between the two, along which the famous highwayman could escape from the authorities. Other surviving old pubs are the Red Lion and the Bull, both timber-framed and dating from before the 18th century.

The oldest place of worship in the town is the parish church of St Michael and St Mary Magdalene in Easthampstead. There has been a church there since Saxon times, although the present building dates from the mid 19th century, except for the lower portions of the Tudor tower. Holy Trinity Church near the town centre was built in 1851.

===New town===
Bracknell was designated a new town on 17 June 1949, in the aftermath of the Second World War. The site was originally a small market town in the civil parish of Warfield in the Easthampstead Rural District. Very little of the original Bracknell is left. The location was preferred to White Waltham, which was also considered, because the Bracknell site avoided encroaching on good quality agricultural land. It had the additional advantage of being on a railway line.

The new town was planned for 25,000 people; it was intended to occupy over of land in and around &#x27;Old Bracknell&#x27;, in the area now occupied by Priestwood, Easthampstead, Bullbrook and Harmans Water. The existing town centre and industrial areas were to be retained with new industry brought in to provide jobs. The town has since expanded far beyond its intended size into farmland to the south.

The New Town was planned on the neighbourhood principle, with a series of neighbourhoods each with a population of around 10,000 with (no more than around five minutes walk away) a church, a small parade of shops, a primary school, small business space, a community centre and a pub. The plans included pedestrianisation, the construction of a ring road around the town centre, and segregation of industrial areas from residential areas.

A feature of some of the estates is that streets only have names, not odonyms – in Birch Hill, Crown Wood, Great Hollands and others there is no &quot;Road&quot;, &quot;Avenue&quot;, &quot;Street&quot;, just &#x27;Frobisher&#x27;, &#x27;Jameston&#x27;, &#x27;Juniper&#x27;, &#x27;Jevington&#x27;. The residential streets are, however, named in alphabetical order in Great Hollands and Wildridings, with As to Ds, such as Donnybrook, in Hanworth, Js, such as &#x27;Jameston&#x27;, &#x27;Juniper&#x27; and &#x27;Jevington&#x27; in Birch Hill.

==Regeneration==
Because of Bracknell&#x27;s age, it was decided in 1995 by the local authorities that it should undergo renovation. Designs and plans were submitted and rejected first time round. The council went for a second attempt and were accepted, work was due to commence early in 2008 but due to the global credit crisis, the plans were postponed. The cost is estimated at £750 million. The regeneration will provide brand new services, a completely redeveloped town centre, 1,000 new homes and new police and bus stations.

The Borough Council continues to work in partnership with the Bracknell Regeneration Partnership (comprising Legal and General and Schroder) to regenerate the town centre.

The first stage of the redevelopment began with the opening of a new Waitrose store in December 2011. By June 2013 shops in the northern part of the town in Broadway and Crossway had been vacated. Demolition of the new town&#x27;s old retro-futuristic, Brutalist central area then began in September 2013, and was completed in December of the same year. Construction of the new centre began in February 2015. On 4 September 2015, it was announced that the new development would be known as The Lexicon. The Lexicon opened on 7 September 2017, comprising of new retail space, a 12-screen cinema which includes a 4DX screen, restaurants and cafes, completely new paving and public realm and 1300 parking spaces as well as improved access by public transport, the council having substantially refurbished the bus station in 2015.

The scheme won at the Revo Awards 2018: Gold in the Re:new category and Best of the Best in the Re:turn category. Shortlisted for the Planning Awards 2017 in the Regeneration category, the scheme won Development of the Year at the 2018 Thames Valley Property Awards. The town saw visitor numbers of 16m in its first year (compared with around 4-5m prior to the town centre&#x27;s demolition). The town centre rose in the retail rankings to number 33 (from 255 before redevelopment). In January 2019, the town had risen again to 29 in the retail rankings.

A second retail centre, the Peel Centre, managed by Land Securities, has 2 car parks, a leisure area called &quot;The Point&quot;. and includes stores Such as The Range, Sports Direct and New Look. The Point includes an Odeon multiplex 10-screen cinema and a bowling alley.

Bracknell is the first post-war New Town centre to have been substantially regenerated and represents a significant exemplar development.

==Demography==

According to the Office for National Statistics in 2018 there were 121,676 people in Bracknell Forest.

According to the 2011 Census.

94% of Bracknell residents can speak English. The second language being Nepalese, at 0.90%, followed by Polish at 0.70%, Tagalog/Filipino at 0.30% and French and Spanish, both at 0.30%.

61% of residents identify themselves as Christian. The second most common belief is &#x27;none&#x27;, with 35% of residents choosing this in the census, in third place is Hinduism at 1.61%, followed by Islam at 1.13% and Buddhism at 0.73%.

The demonym for a person from Bracknell is Bracknellian.

==Business==

The town is home to companies such as 3M, Panasonic, Egnyte, Fujitsu (formerly ICL), Dell, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Micron Technology, Brocade Communications Systems, Siemens (originally Nixdorf), Riverbed, Honeywell, Intercall, Broadcom, Avnet Technology Solutions, Bird Technologies, Novell, and Honda.

The Southern Industrial Area houses the head office of Waitrose. The site which houses the Waitrose head office also houses the central distribution centre. Waitrose has operated from the town since the 1970s with its old store based at Birch Hill Shopping Centre until closure with a new store opened in the town centre in 2011.

Manufacturing industry has largely disappeared since the 1980s. Former significant sites included Racal Communications in Western and London Road, Clifford&#x27;s Dairy in Downshire Way and British Aerospace (originally Sperry Gyroscope) now occupied by Arlington Square, a business park of which the first stage was completed in 1995. The Thomas Lawrence brickworks on the north side of the town was famous for &#x27;red rubber&#x27; bricks to be found in the Royal Albert Hall and Westminster Cathedral, and in restoration work at 10 Downing Street and Hampton Court Palace.

In the town centre was the 12-storey Winchester House, formerly owned by 3M who moved to new premises in Farley Wood on the town&#x27;s northern edge in 2004. The building was demolished and has been replaced with a large block of flats The town was also the home of Racal and Ferranti Computer Systems Ltd. The Met Office maintained a large presence in the town until 2003, when it relocated to Exeter in Devon; however, the junction of the A329 and A3095 is still named the &quot;Met Office Roundabout&quot;. Many businesses are located on the town&#x27;s three industrial areas.

Easthampstead Park in the southern suburb of Easthampstead was a conference centre owned by Bracknell Forest Borough Council. In 2019 an agreement was made between the local authority and a hotel group, Active Hospitality. The building is now leased to the company and has reopened as a hotel 

==Local government==
Bracknell was made a civil parish in its own right in 1955. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the entire Easthampstead Rural District became the Bracknell District on 1 April 1974. In 1988, it was granted borough status, and it changed its name to Bracknell Forest. When Berkshire County Council was abolished on 1 April 1998 (and the non-metropolitan county was reclassified as a ceremonial county), Bracknell Forest became one of the six unitary authorities which together make up Berkshire. Bracknell Forest Borough Council&#x27;s offices are at Time Square in Market Street.

==Geography==
The town covers areas previously in the parishes of Easthampstead, Warfield, Binfield and Winkfield. The town&#x27;s centre lies just north of the railway station with completely pedestrianised and much undercover shopping around Princess Square, Charles Square and the Broadway. There are &#x27;out-of-town&#x27; shops, a multiscreen cinema and ten pin bowling complex at the Peel Centre. Just to the west are the Western and Southern industrial estates, either side of the railway line. There are many residential suburbs (see settlement table below) of varying dates, the oldest being Priestwood and, of course, Easthampstead village.

The former RAF Staff College buildings in Harmans Water, now closed, was part of the Joint Services Command and Staff College. From 2008, the site was redeveloped for housing by Wimpey, with an estimated 730 houses. The south-western corner of the town remains rural around Easthampstead Park and the wooded Yew Tree Corner. A newer housing development called Jennett&#x27;s Park was built (from 2007) at Peacock Farm and on part of what was historically the grounds of Easthampstead Park. There are large ponds at Farley Wood and the Easthampstead Mill Pond between Great Hollands and Wildridings, and two lakes at South Hill Park. The &quot;Bull Brook&quot; emerges above ground just within the bounds of the suburb of Bullbrook.

==Culture==

In the south of the town is South Hill Park, a mansion dating from 1760, although much rebuilt, that now houses a large arts centre. The Wilde Theatre was opened in 1984, named after Oscar Wilde who created the character &#x27;Lady Bracknell&#x27; in his play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, which was also the inaugural production at the theatre in April of that year. South Hill Park has been home to a number of major music festivals over the years:

* 1975 – 1990s Bracknell Jazz Festival
* 1970s – 1980s Bracknell Folk Festival (&quot;The Handsome Mouldiwarp Festival&quot;)
* 1988 – Womad Festival
* 1980s – 1990s – Bracknell Music Festival / South Hill Park Festival
* 2000s – 2013 – Big Day Out festival, a free, annual World Music and acoustic/folk festival

Bracknell has been used in the filming of many TV shows and films, such as &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (Martins Heron) and &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (Birch Hill). Bracknell is given the name &#x27;Laxton&#x27; in the TV detective series Pie in the Sky and Waterside Park was used for the exterior of the police HQ in the same series. Bracknell has also featured in the 1991 Roger Daltrey film &quot;Buddy&#x27;s Song&quot;.

&quot;The Offence&quot; (1972), a psychological thriller with Sean Connery and Ian Bannen, was filmed in Bracknell. There are scenes in the town centre, on Broadway, Charles Square and Market Street. The flat for Connery&#x27;s character was filmed at the listed Point Royal, and the bulk of the outdoor scenes were taken around Wildridings, specifically Arncliffe, Crossfell, Mill Pond and Mill Lane.

The wages snatch scene in &quot;Villain&quot; (1971), a gangster film with Richard Burton, was filmed in Ellesfield Avenue on the Southern Industrial Estate outside the former Clark Eaton glass factory, with the ICL tower block visible in the background; after the robbery the gang make their getaway along Peacock Lane nearby and hijack a car at the junction with the footpath from Tarmans Copse (now Osprey Avenue on the Jennett&#x27;s Park estate).

Bracknell is featured in the PlayStation 3 video game &quot;&quot; set in 1951, as the location at which power conduits travel deep underground South East England to power the Chimeran fortresses. It also featured in the sequel &quot;Resistance 2&quot; in a similar role.

The BBC show The Wrong Mans is set almost entirely in Bracknell.

<doc id="302270" wikidata="Q265813" url="?curid=302270" title="Susana Higuchi">
<text>Susana Shizuko Higuchi Miyagawa (, , Hepburn: , ; 26 April 1950 – 8 December 2021) was a Peruvian politician and engineer. She served as First Lady of Peru from 1990 to 1994 as the wife of President Alberto Fujimori. In 1994, she described her husband as a corrupt tyrant and divorced him in 1995. 

Higuchi was elected as a member of the Independent Moralizing Front (&quot;Frente Independiente Moralizador&quot;, FIM), a reformist political party allied with then president Alejandro Toledo, in both the 2000 and 2001 general elections. She served as a member of the Congress for two terms from 2000 to 2006,

== Early life ==
Of Japanese descent, Higuchi was born in Lima, Peru. She attended Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria specializing in hydraulics, working for the El Sol tire company and established her family in La Victoria District, Lima. Higuchi was often viewed as being independent and outspoken, initiating the first steps of her relationship with Alberto Fujimori despite the disagreement of her parents. The two spent four months dating, with Higuchi noting Fujimori&#x27;s resemblance to her brother who died in a motorcycle accident and their shared interest in science and statistics.

== Career ==
After marrying Fujimori, she opened the company Construcciones Fuji, often directing workers in her daily outfit of a regular shirt, jeans and boots. At this time, she was the primary income-earner in the family as Fujimori earned a modest professor salary, creating an unequal and strained relationship. 

== First Lady of Peru ==
As first lady during her husband&#x27;s presidency, Higuchi was among the early people in Peru to allege criminal misdoings on the part of her husband. As early as 1992, she denounced several of her Fujimori in-laws for corruption in connection, especially Juana and Rosa Fujimori, alleging Fujimori&#x27;s sisters sold used clothing donated by Japan for millions of dollars. The Congress of Peru was beginning to investigate the allegations, though President Fujimori initiated the 1992 Peruvian coup d&#x27;état and dissolved Congress before any formal inquiries could begin.

In 1994, she publicly condemned her husband as a tyrant and his government as corrupt. Fujimori reacted by formally stripping her of the title First Lady in August 1994, appointing their elder daughter Keiko First Lady in her place. Higuchi thereupon established her own political party, the &quot;Harmony 21st century&quot;, and announced her intention to enter politics as a candidate for mayor of Lima in the 1995 elections. In December 1994 the Harmony party was ruled ineligible because it failed to muster the required number of signatures to qualify as a legitimate political party.

Because of her outspokenness, Higuchi was subjected to repeated efforts to silence her. Peru&#x27;s media, which operated in accordance to President Fujimori, also ignored stories regarding the alleged abuses against Higuchi. One journalist of Channel 2, Juan Subauste, said that they interviewed Higuchi in 1994 in the Plaza Mayor where she said that she was mistreated and locked in her room, though the interview was never reported in Peru until the 2000s due to the oversight of Channel 2 by the National Intelligence Service of Vladimiro Montesinos. In 2001, she told investigators probing the corruption of the Fujimori years that she had been tortured &quot;five hundred times&quot; by the intelligence services of the Peruvian Army. Fujimori denied that Higuchi had been tortured. He said the scars on her back and neck were not caused by torture, but were the result of a traditional Chinese and Japanese therapy called moxibustion, which Higuchi underwent to help her stop smoking and to relieve back troubles.

In July 2001, she alleged that in 1990, shortly before coming to power, her ex-husband received a donation of US$12.5 million from Japanese citizens destined for poor children in Peru, but he deposited it in a private bank account in Japan.

== Personal life ==
Higuchi married Alberto Fujimori on 25 July 1974 and formally divorced him in 1995. They have four children: Keiko Sofía, Hiro Alberto, Sachi Marcela, and Kenji Gerardo. Higuchi died of cancer in 2021.

<text>The Meteors are an English psychobilly band formed in 1980. Originally from London, England, they are one of the pioneers of the psychobilly subgenre — which fuses punk rock with rockabilly — its distinctive sound and style. &quot;Starting in the neo-rockabilly scene, the Meteors were initially shunned for being too spooky and mean. Excuses for exclusion from rockabilly concerts varied from the band having too extreme of a sound to their drummer having green hair.&quot; The Meteors blended elements of punk rock, 1960s garage band surf music, rockabilly, and horror film themes in their music and are thought to be one of the first bands to use the label &#x27;Psychobilly&#x27; to define a genre and musical style, though the term is used as a lyrical motif as part of the narrative in the Johnny Cash and The Tennessee Three song, &quot;One Piece at a Time&quot;.

==Biography==
The Meteors were formed in 1980 by P. Paul Fenech (guitar and vocals), Nigel Lewis (upright bass/electric bass and vocals), and Mark Robertson (drums). Fenech and Lewis had played in rockabilly bands before, but left their former band, Raw Deal, in order to experiment with a new sound that mixed horror and science fiction lyrics with a punk rock / rockabilly crossover. 

The band made their first TV appearance on Thames TV afternoon show &quot;White Light&quot; in late 1980. The Meteors made a short film in late 1980 with comedian Keith Allen called &quot;Meteor Madness&quot;. It was released as a double feature with 2 Tone ska film &quot;Dance Craze&quot; in March 1981. The movie featured four songs, which made it onto the band&#x27;s first vinyl single first issued on Ace Records and later on Big Beat. The tracks were also issued as a rare 12&quot; mini-album called &quot;The Meteors Meet Screaming Lord Sutch&quot;. Soon after that, they issued the double A-side anthems &quot;Radioactive Kid&quot; and &quot;Graveyard Stomp&quot;. A session was recorded for the John Peel BBC radio show in June 1981. Again, to date, these tracks have never been officially released. In August 1981, the band were signed to Island Records and recorded their first full-length album, &quot;The Case Of The Meteors In Heaven&quot;, and 7&quot; single, &quot;The Crazed&quot;. The Meteors have gone through many line-up changes since, with Fenech being the only original member to date. Fenech has also released solo albums and played in side projects including The Legendary Raw Deal (rockabilly), The Surfing Dead (instrumental), and The Murder Brothers. Fenech also helped the young Austrian band Sir Psyko &amp; His Monsters by mixtaping their album &quot;Reaperstale&quot; as well as in recording one of the live shows in 2012 in Berlin called &quot;Welcome to Our Hell&quot;.

<doc id="302275" wikidata="Q1423458" url="?curid=302275" title="Mothra">
<text>is a fictional monster, or &quot;kaiju&quot;, that first appeared in the 1961 film &quot;Mothra&quot;, produced and distributed by Toho Studios. Mothra has appeared in several Toho &quot;tokusatsu&quot; films, often as a recurring monster in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise. She is typically portrayed as a colossal sentient larva (caterpillar) or imago, accompanied by two miniature fairies speaking on her behalf. Unlike several other Toho monsters, Mothra is a largely heroic character, having been variously portrayed as a protector of her own island culture, the Earth and Japan. Mothra&#x27;s design is influenced by silkworms, their imagos, and those of giant silk moths in the family Saturniidae. The character is often depicted hatching offspring (in some cases, twins) when approaching death, a nod to the Saṃsāra doctrine of numerous Indian religions.

Mothra is one of Toho&#x27;s most popular monsters and second only to Godzilla in her total number of film appearances. Polls taken during the early 1990s indicated that Mothra was particularly popular among women who were, at the time, the largest demographic among Japan&#x27;s movie-going audience, a fact that prompted the filming of 1992&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot;, which was the best-attended Toho film since &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;. IGN listed Mothra as #3 on its &quot;Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters&quot; list, while &quot;Complex&quot; listed the character as #7 on its &quot;The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time&quot; list.

Though Mothra is generally portrayed as female, male individuals of her species have also been featured in the franchise, including Battra in &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot;, and a male Mothra larva who appears alongside his non-identical twin sister in &quot;&quot;

==Overview==
===Name===
The name is the suffixation of &quot;-ra&quot; to the English word &quot;moth&quot;; since the Japanese language does not have dental fricatives, it is approximated &quot;Mosura&quot; in Japanese. The &quot;ra&quot; suffix follows the precedent set by Godzilla (&quot;Gojira&quot;), which in turn is derived from , which serves to indicate the character&#x27;s enormous size.

Dican International Pictures entitled the movie &quot;Godzilla vs. the Thing&quot;, probably to avoid legal action from Columbia Pictures, which had released the original &quot;Mothra&quot;.

===Development===
Mothra was first conceived in the January 1961 serial &quot;The Luminous Fairies and Mothra&quot; by authors Shinichiro Nakamura, Takehiko Fukunaga and Yoshie Hotta, who had been commissioned by Toho to write the outline of a future film. The character was further developed by Shinichi Sekizawa, whose experiences of starving in the South Pacific islands during World War II prompted him to envision a movie featuring an island where mysterious events occurred.

In her 1961 debut, Mothra&#x27;s adult form consisted of a wire-operated mechanical puppet, while the larva was a suitmation puppet operated by six stuntmen crawling in single file. In &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; three years later, the adult Mothra puppet was modified with radio-controlled legs, while the larvae were portrayed via a combination of motor-driven props and hand puppets. The larval Mothra featured in &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; remained largely unchanged from its previous appearance, though the color of its eyes was changed from blue to red. The adult Mothra prop featured in &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; was reused in &quot;Ebirah, Horror of the Deep&quot;, though previous heavy use had dulled its colors, frayed the fur on the head and damaged the wings.

During the early Heisei era of &quot;Godzilla &quot;films, which ignored the continuity established in pre-1984 movies, several attempts were made to develop a Mothra standalone feature. Akira Murao wrote a screenplay in 1990 entitled &quot;Mothra vs. Bagan&quot;, which revolved around a shape-shifting dragon called Bagan who sought to destroy humanity for its abuse of the Earth&#x27;s resources, only to be defeated by Mothra, the god of peace. The screenplay was revised by Kazuki Ōmori after the release of &quot;Godzilla vs. Biollante&quot;, though the project was ultimately scrapped by Toho, due to the poor box office performance of &quot;Godzilla vs. Biollante&quot;, as well as the assumption that Mothra was a character born purely out of Japanese culture and thus would have been difficult to market overseas, unlike the more internationally recognized Godzilla. With the success of &quot;Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah&quot;, Toho sought to continue the series&#x27; newfound profitability by reintroducing familiar monsters rather than inventing new ones. Mothra was chosen as Godzilla&#x27;s next antagonist on account of the character&#x27;s popularity with women, who constituted the majority of cinemagoers at the time. Special effects head Koichi Kawakita co-wrote a screenplay entitled &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigamoth&quot; in 1991, which would have pitted Mothra against Godzilla and an irradiated Mothra doppelganger called Gigamoth, though this was rejected early on and replaced with the final plotline that was seen in the film &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot;. Kawakita&#x27;s depiction of Mothra&#x27;s adult form was given the ability to fire energy beams, which were rendered via optical effects, and the pollen dust emitted from its wings were given a sparkling effect not seen in prior movies. During the character&#x27;s transformation from larva to adult, it was initially planned to have Mothra&#x27;s unfolding wings rendered through CGI, though this was scrapped on account of it not looking &quot;sensitive&quot; enough. Although the movie was a financial success, the Mothra props were criticized by several authors, who noted that the adult Mothra&#x27;s brighter colors made it look like a &quot;plush toy&quot; and that its wings flapped less gracefully than in previous incarnations, as they were made of heavy cloth. The Mothra puppet&#x27;s immobile chicken-like feet and the lack of undulation in the larva prop&#x27;s movements were also commented on as being inferior to the effects seen in 1960s Mothra movies. Criticism was also leveled at Mothra&#x27;s altered origin story, which portrayed her as an extraterrestrial, thus dampening the character&#x27;s motivation for protecting Earth. The character&#x27;s newfound popularity nevertheless prompted Toho to produce &quot;Rebirth of Mothra&quot; in 1996.

For &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot;, director Shūsuke Kaneko had originally planned on using Anguirus as one of Godzilla&#x27;s antagonists, but was pressured by Toho chairman Isao Matsuoka to use the more recognizable and profitable Mothra, as the previous film in the franchise, &quot;Godzilla x Megaguirus&quot;, which featured an original and unfamiliar antagonist, was a box office and critical failure.

For 2003&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, special effects director Eiichi Asada sought to model Mothra directly on her appearance in the original 1961 film and to keep optical effects to a minimum. As with &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah&quot;, the adult Mothra was given mobile legs, though they were made to constantly move, as it was felt that the prop stopped looking realistic once they became immobile. Creature designer Shinichi Wakasa had initially wanted Mothra&#x27;s wings to have the angular design seen in &quot;Rebirth of Mothra II&quot;, though the prop was ultimately given the wing shape seen in the 1960s movies. In addition, Mothra&#x27;s twin larvae, one male and one female, were given nicknames by the staff on set - the male, who can be distinguished by his longer tusks and spikes, was nicknamed Taro, while the female was nicknamed Hanako.

===Mothra&#x27;s fairies===

Mothra is usually accompanied by tiny twin female fairies, which Shinichi Sekizawa termed , meaning &quot;little beauties&quot;. The original draft for &quot;Mothra&quot; called for four fairies, though Sekizawa reduced the number to two, as twins were comparatively rare in Japan, thus adding to the characters&#x27; mystique. Toho also sought to reinforce its links with Columbia Pictures, by featuring the singing duo the Peanuts, who had been popularized in America by Columbia Records. Yūji Koseki composed the song &quot;Mosura no uta&quot; (&quot;Song of Mothra&quot;) for the fairies to sing when summoning Mothra. The song was originally sung in Indonesian, but there is also a later version, set to the same tune, sung in Japanese:
The Peanuts were given an additional song in &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; entitled &quot;Cry for Happiness&quot;, composed by Hiroshi Miyagawa. The Peanuts did not reprise their role in &quot;Ebirah, Horror of the Deep&quot; and were replaced by the singing duo Pair Bambi.

In &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot;, the fairies are renamed the and are played by Keiko Imamura and Sayaka Osawa. This casting move was criticized by Godzilla historian Steve Ryfle, who lamented the fact that the two actresses were not identical and that their singing voices were &quot;paper thin.&quot; According to Takao Okawara, the Cosmos scenes were among the hardest scenes he had ever filmed, as the actresses had to synchronize their movements without looking at each other.

In the &quot;Rebirth of Mothra&quot; trilogy, Mothra&#x27;s fairies are called the which consist of Moll, Lora, and their estranged sister Belvera. Moll and Lora contrast with prior adaptations because they possess separate personalities and rarely act in unison. Megumi Kobayashi was cast as Moll for all three films, Sayaka Yamaguchi as Lora for the first two films, Misato Tate as Lora for the third film and Aki Hano as Belvera for all three films.

&quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot; does not feature Mothra&#x27;s fairies, but they are however given a nod in the form of a pair of twin girls wearing white clothes during the scene where Mothra flies over Tokyo. They are played by sisters Ai and Aki Maeda.

In the anime trilogy directed by Gen Urobuchi, the fairies are human-sized sisters named Maina and Miana. Their people are the , descendants of humans that evolved through Mothra&#x27;s influence with both telepathy and an immunity to the assimilative properties of nanometal.

In &quot;&quot;, it&#x27;s revealed that Monarch researcher Dr. Ilene Chen (played by Zhang Ziyi) has an identical twin sister named Dr. Ling Chen, who is also in Monarch and is present at Mothra&#x27;s hatching. The Chens are part of a family which appears to consist almost entirely of pairs of identical twin sisters, two of whom are shown visiting Infant Island (Mothra&#x27;s traditional home) in 1961. The film&#x27;s director and co-screenwriter, Michael Dougherty, confirmed the twins to be an updated version of the fairies, explaining, &quot;It was important to me to find ways to modernize the ideas that [Mothra] has followers. Modernize the priestesses. [There] are still certain realms of believability to keep in take. You have to ease people into the more fantastical aspects.&quot; He noted that the twins were a &quot;perfect example&quot; of humans and monsters cooperating and forming a &quot;symbiotic relationship with each other&quot;, saying, “The twins are an example of a very successful, long relationship...so I wanted to make sure that we found some way to incorporate them, even if it was a little bit of an Easter egg.” Dougherty, who is half-Vietnamese, felt the need to retain the twins&#x27; Asian ethnicity.
==Character biography==
===Shōwa (1961–1968)===

In the Showa continuity, Mothra is depicted as a mystical being that is worshiped by a primitive human culture native to Infant Island. &quot;Mothra&quot; has her hatching from an egg after her priestesses are abducted by a Rolisican capitalist hoping to exploit them as media celebrities. The larva Mothra swims to Tokyo and cocoons herself around the Tokyo Tower. Upon reaching her adult form, Mothra flies to Rolisica&#x27;s capital and causes widespread destruction until her priestesses are returned to her.

Mothra in this era, most notably the first individual appeared in the 1961 film is the largest incarnation of all, being 180 meters in length with a wingspan of 250 meters and weighed 20,000 tonnes as an Imago, and 135 meters in body length and weighed 15,000 tonnes as a larva. In later films, the size of the Imagoes decreased to 53 meters in 1964 film and 40 meters in body length and 8,000 tonnes in weight in 1968 film respectively, while the size of the larva in 1966 film stayed the same to the 1961 individual.

In &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot;, a Mothra egg appears on the coast of Japan, and is exploited as a tourist attraction. Mothra&#x27;s priestesses attempt to negotiate the return of the egg to Infant Island, but are rebuffed. Godzilla attacks Japan, forcing humanity to beseech an embittered Mothra to intervene. Mothra willingly sacrificed herself whilst fighting Godzilla, but the latter is defeated when two larvae emerge from the egg and encase Godzilla in a cocoon.

In &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;, it is revealed that only one of the larvae survived. The remaining larva attempts to convince Godzilla and Rodan to join forces with her in order to fight King Ghidorah, but the two monsters reject her proposal. Mothra is nearly killed attempting to fight Ghidorah alone, but is saved through the intervention of Godzilla and Rodan.

The larva ultimately gains adulthood in &quot;Ebirah, Horror of the Deep&quot;, where she saves a group of slaves taken from Infant Island from a terrorist base on Letchi Island undergoing a self-destruct sequence.

Another larva appears in &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot;, living alongside other monsters in Monsterland. Along with the other monsters, Mothra is briefly enslaved by the evil Kilaaks, who force her to attack Beijing and later join Godzilla in the destruction of Tokyo. The Kilaaks&#x27; mind control is ultimately broken and Mothra joins the other monsters in the final battle against King Ghidorah. This was the character&#x27;s final starring role in the Showa era, although Mothra would later be seen in stock footage from &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; and &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; for &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot; in 1972.

===Heisei (1992–1998)===
1992&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot; portrays Mothra as a guardian of the Earth who presided over an advanced civilization over 12,000 years ago. When the civilization created a device designed to control the Earth&#x27;s climate, the Earth responded by creating the Black Mothra, Battra, which Mothra defeated, but not before the civilization was wiped out. Mothra&#x27;s egg is later discovered in 1992 on Infant Island by the Marutomo real estate agency, which seeks to exploit it and Mothra&#x27;s priestesses for profit. The egg hatches during a fight between Godzilla and a resurrected Battra, and the larva later attacks Tokyo in order to save her priestesses. Mothra forms a cocoon around the National Diet Building, attains her adult form, then briefly fights Battra before joining forces with him in order to fight Godzilla. Battra dies in the attempt and Mothra pledges to fulfill her fallen comrade&#x27;s role in preventing a meteorite from devastating the Earth in 1999.

In &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot;, Mothra detected SpaceGodzilla&#x27;s advance towards Earth and sends her priestesses to warn the planet of his arrival.

The &quot;Rebirth of Mothra&quot; trilogy is separate from the Godzilla Heisei continuity and portrays Mothra as the last remaining member of a species of giant moths who guard the Elias&#x27; civilization. This civilization was destroyed millions of years ago by the dragon Desghidorah, whom Mothra defeated. Mothra lays an egg in modern times, but is too weak to fight Desghidorah once it returns. The egg hatches and the new Mothra, goes to protect her mother, but sadly Mothra is mortally wounded by Desghidorah while the larva is still too weak to combat the dragon. After Mothra dies, the new Mothra metamorphoses into an adult, then manages to kill Desghidorah.

Mothra returns in &quot;Rebirth of Mothra II&quot;, where she acquires a new and more powerful form in order to fight the pollution monster Dagahra.

In &quot;Rebirth of Mothra III&quot;, Mothra is forced to travel backwards through time to the Cretaceous Period in order to retroactively kill the space dragon King Ghidorah and remove Ghidorah from history. After seemingly defeating Ghidorah&#x27;s younger form in the Cretaceous period, Mothra hibernates in a cocoon constructed by an ancestral Mothra larvae for 65 million years until the present day, where she defeats Ghidorah&#x27;s far stronger modern form with a new, equally strong form of her own.

===Millennium (2001–2004)===
In &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot;, Mothra is portrayed as having been one of the three guardians of Yamato, originating 1,000 years before the events of the film. Initially an antagonist, Mothra was imprisoned in Lake Ikeda, only to be reawakened in 2001 to halt Godzilla&#x27;s destruction of Tokyo. She is defeated, but transfers her spirit to King Ghidorah.

&quot;&quot; has the Mothra from the original 1961 film send her priestesses to demand that Japan dismantle the anti-Godzilla weapon Kiryu or face destruction, as she considers the cyborg to be against the natural order, having been created using the bones of the first Godzilla. When the second Godzilla lands, Mothra attempts to fight the monster alongside Kiryu, but is killed in the process. Two larvae hatch on Infant Island and reach Tokyo in order to fight Godzilla, whom they encase in a cocoon, which is then transported into the ocean by Kiryu.

&quot;&quot;, which ignores the continuity of the previous film, establishes that Mothra protected the Earth 10,000 years ago from the cyborg Gigan. In the distant future, Gigan returns, under the control of the Xiliens, and is confronted by Mothra. In the ensuing battle, Mothra catches fire, but manages to kill Gigan by ramming into him and exploding. However, in a mid-credits scene, Mothra is shown to be alive after all and flying back to Infant Island to be reunited with the Shobijin.

===Reiwa era (2018–2021)===
While Mothra never made a physical appearance, she was mentioned in &quot;&quot; to have been killed by Godzilla years prior, though her egg ended up in the protection of the Houtua people, a species of evolved humans who adapted Mothra-like features to survive the now Godzilla ruled Earth. An astral projection of Mothra&#x27;s unborn child in their adult form appears in &quot;&quot;.

In &quot;Godzilla Singular Point&quot;, dozens of small moths, that bear a striking resemblance to Mothra, appear. (&quot;Visual similarities include: blue eyes, orange and yellow patterns on the wings, a &#x27;false eye&#x27; pattern as seen on Mothra as well as other species of Lepidoptera&quot;). These small moths even seem to shed their golden scales, similar to how Mothra has done the same thing in the past. These moths also have a brief interaction with Jet Jaguar, making it the first on-screen interaction between the two Toho characters (&quot;outside of comics, video games, spin-offs, etc.&quot;).

However, due to this show&#x27;s nature to rename / rebrand existing monsters as new ones (&quot;For example: A creature that heavily resembles “Varan”, both in its visual design &amp; its sound design, is later revealed to be a different creature&quot;), there is no direct confirmation that this is actually Mothra. One may assume these moths are related to Mothra in some way (&quot;or actually are several Mothras&quot;), but the show does not provide any context as to what they actually are.

Several of Mothra&#x27;s previous incarnations make cameo appearances in the show&#x27;s ending credits (&quot;alongside several other Toho properties&quot;).

===MonsterVerse (2019–present)===
In 2014, Legendary Pictures announced that they had acquired the rights to Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah from Toho to use in their MonsterVerse.

In the post-credits scene at the end of the 2017 film &quot;&quot;, Mothra appears in a series of cave paintings depicting other monsters that are known to exist that are shown in the footage to James Conrad and Mason Weaver, along with Godzilla, Rodan and King Ghidorah.

A casting call confirmed that Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah would all be featured in &quot;&quot;. Viral marketing for the movie showed that Mothra retained her status as a creature who is deified as an angelic-like goddess, referred to as the Queen of the Monsters. Monarch Sciences, the film&#x27;s promotional website, identifies the Yunnan rainforest as Mothra&#x27;s location (however, Infant Island was referenced within the film, and the name &quot;Mosura&quot; is said to be derived from a small Indonesian island) and states in its adult form to be capable of emitting beta-wave bioluminescence that can be projected through the intricate patterns on its wings and weaponized into destructive and blinding ‘god rays’. Further promotional material also revealed narrower wings, a wider wingspan (at 803 feet or 244.75 meters, it is second only to her original 250-meter wingspan), long praying mantis-like forearms and legs as opposed to bird-like limbs and a body design that is more reminiscent of real-life moths, with a smaller body and head. The markings on her wings are said to mark her as the &quot;Queen of the Monsters&quot; and that they apparently link Mothra to Godzilla, the King of the Monsters, since the eye spots on her wings are modeled after Godzilla&#x27;s eyes. Within the film, she is shown to have a symbiotic relationship with Godzilla, and temporarily paralyzes Rodan by stabbing him through the chest with a hidden abdominal stinger. These changes make Mothra the most heavily redesigned monster in the series.

Mothra first appears hatching from her egg in her larval state and is calmed by Dr. Emma Russell using the ORCA bio-acoustics device, becoming docile. When eco-terrorists led by Colonel Alan Jonah arrive soon after and capture Russell, her daughter Madison and the ORCA device, Mothra retreats under a waterfall and cocoons herself, later emerging from her cocoon in her adult form and flying off. During the fight in Boston, Mothra defeats Rodan and is disintegrated by King Ghidorah while protecting a fallen Godzilla. Her power is transferred to Godzilla as a result via her ashes, preventing him from suffering a nuclear meltdown and allowing him to defeat Ghidorah by achieving his burning form. During the credits, a news program speculates about the existence of a second Mothra egg, which the director later confirmed.

Mothra returned in &quot;Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&quot;. When the Iwi sense that the tyrannical Skar King is about to come for them, they send a signal to Jia, the sole survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, so she can find them and re-awaken Mothra to aid Godzilla in battle. After a wounded Kong tells them the Skar King is on his way, Jia successfully reawakens Mothra. Mothra reunites with Godzilla and convinces him to join forces with Kong. Mothra then joins the battle in the Hollow Earth and takes down Skar King&#x27;s apes, preventing them from reaching the surface. She also aids Godzilla when Shimo, the mother Titan under Skar King&#x27;s control, almost freezes him. Eventually Godzilla and Kong manage to come out victorious, with Shimo being freed from Skar King&#x27;s control and starts freezing him over so that Kong can eventually destroy him. Mothra then helps the Iwi rebuild the barrier that protects them and then flies off deep into Hollow Earth.

<doc id="302278" wikidata="Q273383" url="?curid=302278" title="Memento mori">
<text> (Latin for &quot;remember (that you have) to die&quot;) is an artistic or symbolic trope acting as a reminder of the inevitability of death. The concept has its roots in the philosophers of classical antiquity and Christianity, and appeared in funerary art and architecture from the medieval period onwards.

The most common motif is a skull, often accompanied by bones. Often, this alone is enough to evoke the trope, but other motifs include a coffin, hourglass, or wilting flowers to signify the impermanence of life. Often, these would accompany a different central subject within a wider work, such as portraiture; however, the concept includes standalone genres such as the and in visual art and cadaver monuments in sculpture.

==Pronunciation and translation==
In English, the phrase is typically pronounced , .

 is the active future imperative of , &#x27;to remember, to bear in mind&#x27;, usually serving as a warning: &quot;remember!&quot; is the present infinitive of the deponent verb &#x27;to die&#x27;. Thus, the phrase literally translates as &quot;you must remember to die&quot; but may be loosely rendered as &quot;remember death&quot; or &quot;remember that you die&quot;.

==History of the concept==

===In classical antiquity===
The philosopher Democritus trained himself by going into solitude and frequenting tombs. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot;, where the death of Socrates is recounted, introduces the idea that the proper practice of philosophy is &quot;about nothing else but dying and being dead&quot;.

The Stoics of classical antiquity were particularly prominent in their use of this discipline, and Seneca&#x27;s letters are full of injunctions to meditate on death. The Stoic Epictetus told his students that when kissing their child, brother, or friend, they should remind themselves that they are mortal, curbing their pleasure, as do &quot;those who stand behind men in their triumphs and remind them that they are mortal&quot;. The Stoic Marcus Aurelius invited the reader (himself) to &quot;consider how ephemeral and mean all mortal things are&quot; in his &quot;Meditations&quot;.

In some accounts of the Roman triumph, a companion or public slave would stand behind or near the triumphant general during the procession and remind him from time to time of his own mortality or prompt him to &quot;look behind&quot;. A version of this warning is often rendered into English as &quot;Remember, Caesar, thou art mortal&quot;, for example in &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;.

===In early Christianity===
Several passages in the Old Testament urge a remembrance of death. In Psalm 90, Moses prays that God would teach his people &quot;to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom&quot; (). In Ecclesiastes, the Preacher insists that &quot;It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for this is the end of all mankind, and the living will lay it to heart&quot; (). In Isaiah, the lifespan of human beings is compared to the short lifespan of grass: &quot;The grass withers, the flower fades when the breath of the blows on it; surely the people are grass&quot; (Is. 40:7).

The expression &quot;memento mori&quot; developed with the growth of Christianity, which emphasized Heaven, Hell, Hades and salvation of the soul in the afterlife.

===In Europe from the medieval era to the Victorian era===
====Christian Theology====
The thought was then utilized in Christianity, whose strong emphasis on divine judgment, heaven, hell, and the salvation of the soul brought death to the forefront of consciousness. In the Christian context, the &quot;memento mori&quot; acquires a moralizing purpose quite opposed to the &quot;nunc est bibendum&quot; (&quot;now is the time to drink&quot;) theme of classical antiquity. To the Christian, the prospect of death serves to emphasize the emptiness and fleetingness of earthly pleasures, luxuries, and achievements, and thus also as an invitation to focus one&#x27;s thoughts on the prospect of the afterlife. A biblical injunction often associated with the &quot;memento mori&quot; in this context is &quot;In omnibus operibus tuis memorare novissima tua, et in aeternum non peccabis&quot; (the Vulgate&#x27;s Latin rendering of Ecclesiasticus , &quot;in all thy works be mindful of thy last end and thou wilt never sin.&quot;) This finds ritual expression in the rites of Ash Wednesday, when ashes are placed upon the worshipers&#x27; heads with the words, &quot;Remember, Man, that you are dust and unto dust, you shall return.&quot;

&quot;Memento mori&quot; has been an important part of ascetic disciplines as a means of perfecting the character by cultivating detachment and other virtues, and by turning the attention towards the immortality of the soul and the afterlife.

====Architecture====

The most obvious places to look for &quot;memento mori&quot; meditations are in funeral art and architecture. Perhaps the most striking to contemporary minds is the &quot;transi&quot; or &quot;cadaver tomb&quot;, a tomb that depicts the decayed corpse of the deceased. This became a fashion in the tombs of the wealthy in the fifteenth century, and surviving examples still offer a stark reminder of the vanity of earthly riches. Later, Puritan tomb stones in the colonial United States frequently depicted winged skulls, skeletons, or angels snuffing out candles. These are among the numerous themes associated with skull imagery.

Another example of &quot;memento mori&quot; is provided by the chapels of bones, such as the Capela dos Ossos in Évora or the Capuchin Crypt in Rome. These are chapels where the walls are totally or partially covered by human remains, mostly bones. The entrance to the Capela dos Ossos has the following sentence: &quot;We bones, lying here bare, await yours.&quot;

====Visual art====

Timepieces have been used to illustrate that the time of the living on Earth grows shorter with each passing minute. Public clocks would be decorated with mottos such as &quot;ultima forsan&quot; (&quot;perhaps the last&quot; [hour]) or &quot;vulnerant omnes, ultima necat&quot; (&quot;they all wound, and the last kills&quot;). Clocks have carried the motto &quot;tempus fugit&quot; (&quot;time flies&quot;). Old striking clocks often sported automata who would appear and strike the hour; some of the celebrated automaton clocks from Augsburg, Germany, had Death striking the hour. In the private sphere, some people carried smaller reminders of their own mortality. For example, Mary, Queen of Scots, owned a large watch carved in the form of a silver skull, embellished with the lines of Horace, &quot;Pale death knocks with the same tempo upon the huts of the poor and the towers of Kings.&quot;

In the late 16th and through the 17th century, &quot;memento mori&quot; jewelry was popular. Items included mourning rings, pendants, lockets, and brooches. These pieces depicted tiny motifs of skulls, bones, and coffins, in addition to messages and names of the departed, picked out in precious metals and enamel.

During the same period, there emerged the artistic genre known as &quot;vanitas&quot;, Latin for &quot;emptiness&quot; or &quot;vanity&quot;. Especially popular in Holland and then spreading to other European nations, vanitas paintings typically represented assemblages of numerous symbolic objects such as human skulls, guttering candles, wilting flowers, soap bubbles, butterflies, and hourglasses. In combination, vanitas assemblies conveyed the impermanence of human endeavours and of the decay that is inevitable with the passage of time. See also the themes associated with the image of the skull. The 2007 screenprint by the street-artist Banksy &quot;Grin Reaper&quot; features the Grim Reaper with acid-house smiley face sitting on a clock demonstrating death awaiting us all.

====Literature====
&quot;Memento mori&quot; is also an important literary theme. Well-known literary meditations on death in English prose include Sir Thomas Browne&#x27;s &quot;Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial&quot; and Jeremy Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Holy Living and Holy Dying&quot;. These works were part of a Jacobean cult of melancholia that marked the end of the Elizabethan era. In the late eighteenth century, literary elegies were a common genre; Thomas Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot; and Edward Young&#x27;s &quot;Night Thoughts&quot; are typical members of the genre.

In the European devotional literature of the Renaissance, the &quot;Ars Moriendi&quot;, &quot;memento mori&quot; had moral value by reminding individuals of their mortality.

====Music====
Apart from the genre of requiem and funeral music, there is also a rich tradition of &quot;memento mori&quot; in the Early Music of Europe. Especially those facing the ever-present death during the recurring bubonic plague pandemics from the 1340s onward tried to toughen themselves by anticipating the inevitable in chants, from the simple Geisslerlieder of the Flagellant movement to the more refined cloistral or courtly songs. The lyrics often looked at life as a necessary and God-given vale of tears with death as a ransom, and they reminded people to lead sinless lives to stand a chance at Judgment Day. The following two Latin stanzas (with their English translations) are typical of &quot;memento mori&quot; in medieval music; they are from the virelai &quot;Ad Mortem Festinamus&quot; of the Llibre Vermell de Montserrat from 1399:

====Danse macabre====
The &quot;danse macabre&quot; is another well-known example of the &quot;memento mori&quot; theme, with its dancing depiction of the Grim Reaper carrying off rich and poor alike. This and similar depictions of Death decorated many European churches.

====Gallery====
===The salutation of the Hermits of St. Paul of France===
&quot;Memento mori&quot; was the salutation used by the Hermits of St. Paul of France (1620–1633), also known as the Brothers of Death. It is sometimes claimed that the Trappists use this salutation, but this is not true.

===In Puritan America===

Colonial American art saw a large number of &quot;memento mori&quot; images due to Puritan influence. The Puritan community in 17th-century North America looked down upon art because they believed that it drew the faithful away from God and, if away from God, then it could only lead to the devil. However, portraits were considered historical records and, as such, they were allowed. Thomas Smith, a 17th-century Puritan, fought in many naval battles and also painted. In his self-portrait, we see these pursuits represented alongside a typical Puritan &quot;memento mori&quot; with a skull, suggesting his awareness of imminent death.

The poem underneath the skull emphasizes Thomas Smith&#x27;s acceptance of death and of turning away from the world of the living:

Why why should I the World be minding, Therein a World of Evils Finding. Then Farwell World: Farwell thy jarres, thy Joies thy Toies thy Wiles thy Warrs. Truth Sounds Retreat: I am not sorye. The Eternall Drawes to him my heart, By Faith (which can thy Force Subvert) To Crowne me (after Grace) with Glory.

===Mexico&#x27;s Day of the Dead===
Much &quot;memento mori&quot; art is associated with the Mexican festival Day of the Dead, including skull-shaped candies and bread loaves adorned with bread &quot;bones&quot;.

This theme was also famously expressed in the works of the Mexican engraver José Guadalupe Posada, in which people from various walks of life are depicted as skeletons.

Another manifestation of &quot;memento mori&quot; is found in the Mexican &quot;Calavera&quot;, a literary composition in verse form normally written in honour of a person who is still alive, but written as if that person were dead. These compositions have a comedic tone and are often offered from one friend to another during Day of the Dead.

===Contemporary culture===

Roman Krznaric suggests &quot;memento mori&quot; is an important topic to bring back into our thoughts and belief system; &quot;Philosophers have come up with lots of what I call &#x27;death tasters&#x27; – thought experiments for seizing the day.&quot;

These thought experiments are powerful to get us re-oriented back to death into current awareness and living with spontaneity. Albert Camus stated &quot;Come to terms with death, thereafter anything is possible.&quot; Jean-Paul Sartre expressed that life is given to us early, and is shortened at the end, all the while taken away at every step of the way, emphasizing that the end is only the beginning every day.

==Similar concepts across cultures==
===In Buddhism===
The Buddhist practice &quot;maraṇasati&quot; meditates on death. The word is a Pāli compound of &quot;maraṇa&quot; &#x27;death&#x27; (an Indo-European cognate of Latin &quot;mori&quot;) and &quot;sati&quot; &#x27;awareness&#x27;, so very close to &quot;memento mori&quot;. It is first used in early Buddhist texts, the suttapiṭaka of the Pāli Canon, with parallels in the āgamas of the &quot;Northern&quot; Schools.

===In Japanese Zen and samurai culture===
In Japan, the influence of Zen Buddhist contemplation of death on indigenous culture can be gauged by the following quotation from the classic treatise on samurai ethics, &quot;Hagakure&quot;:

The Way of the Samurai is, morning after morning, the practice of death, considering whether it will be here or be there, imagining the most sightly way of dying, and putting one&#x27;s mind firmly in death. Although this may be a most difficult thing, if one will do it, it can be done. There is nothing that one should suppose cannot be done.

In the annual appreciation of cherry blossom and fall colors, &quot;hanami&quot; and &quot;momijigari&quot;, it was philosophized that things are most splendid at the moment before their fall, and to aim to live and die in a similar fashion.

=== In Tibetan Buddhism ===

In Tibetan Buddhism, there is a mind training practice known as Lojong. The initial stages of the classic Lojong begin with &#x27;The Four Thoughts that Turn the Mind&#x27;, or, more literally, &#x27;Four Contemplations to Cause a Revolution in the Mind&#x27;. The second of these four is the contemplation on impermanence and death. In particular, one contemplates that;
* All compounded things are impermanent.
* The human body is a compounded thing.
* Therefore, death of the body is certain.
* The time of death is uncertain and beyond our control.

There are a number of classic verse formulations of these contemplations meant for daily reflection to overcome our strong habitual tendency to live as though we will certainly not die today.

==== Lalitavistara Sutra ====
The following is from the Lalitavistara Sūtra, a major work in the classical Sanskrit canon:

==== The Udānavarga ====
A very well-known verse in the Pali, Sanskrit and Tibetan canons states [this is from the Sanskrit version, the &quot;Udānavarga&quot;]:

==== Shantideva, Bodhicaryavatara ====
Shantideva, in the Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra &#x27;Bodhisattva&#x27;s Way of Life&#x27; reflects at length:
====In more modern Tibetan Buddhist works====

In a practice text written by the 19th-century Tibetan master Dudjom Lingpa for serious meditators, he formulates the second contemplation in this way:

The contemporary Tibetan master, Yangthang Rinpoche, in his short text &#x27;Summary of the View, Meditation, and Conduct&#x27;:

The Tibetan Canon also includes copious materials on the meditative preparation for the death process and intermediate period bardo between death and rebirth. Amongst them are the famous &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, in Tibetan &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot;, the &quot;Natural Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo&quot;.

===In Islam===
The &quot;remembrance of death&quot; (, &quot;Tadhkirat al-Mawt&quot;; deriving from , &quot;tadhkirah&quot;, Arabic for &quot;memorandum&quot; or &quot;admonition&quot;), has been a major topic of Islamic spirituality since the time of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in Medina. It is grounded in the Qur&#x27;an, where there are recurring injunctions to pay heed to the fate of previous generations. The hadith literature, which preserves the teachings of Muhammad, records advice for believers to &quot;remember often death, the destroyer of pleasures.&quot; Some Sufis have been called &quot;ahl al-qubur,&quot; the &quot;people of the graves,&quot; because of their practice of frequenting graveyards to ponder on mortality and the vanity of life, based on the teaching of Muhammad to visit graves. Al-Ghazali devotes to this topic the last book of his &quot;The Revival of the Religious Sciences&quot;.

===Iceland===
The Hávamál (&quot;Sayings of the High One&quot;), a 13th-century Icelandic compilation poetically attributed to the god Odin, includes two sections – the Gestaþáttr and the Loddfáfnismál – offering many gnomic proverbs expressing the memento mori philosophy, most famously Gestaþáttr number 77:

<doc id="302284" wikidata="Q1244726" url="?curid=302284" title="Wolfson College, Cambridge">
<text>Wolfson College () is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England. The majority of students at the college are postgraduates. The college also admits &quot;mature&quot; undergraduates (aged 21 and above), with around 15% of students studying undergraduate degree courses at the university. The college was founded in 1965 as &quot;University College&quot;, but was refounded as Wolfson College in 1973 in recognition of the benefaction of the Wolfson Foundation. Wolfson is located to the south-west of Cambridge city centre, near the University Library.

As one of the more modern colleges in Cambridge, Wolfson does not follow all of the traditions of some of the university&#x27;s older colleges. For example, since the college&#x27;s founding there has been no &quot;High Table&quot; reserved for Fellows at Formal Hall dinners; students and Fellows mix and dine together, and the tradition of wearing academic gowns to such occasions is encouraged but is not compulsory. Both Fellows and students at the college have access to all the facilities. With students from over 70 countries, Wolfson claims to be one of Cambridge&#x27;s most cosmopolitan colleges. It was the first college of the university to admit men and women as both students and Fellows.

The current President of Wolfson College is scientist Ijeoma Uchegbu.

==History==
After the Second World War, the number of graduates of other universities who went to Cambridge to do research increased significantly. The university therefore decided to found University College in 1965 to help accommodate these students. The college was based at Bredon House, a property built in the early twentieth century by John Stanley Gardiner, who was a Professor of Zoology at the university from 1909 to 1937. He donated the house, with its long narrow garden running from Barton Road to Selwyn Gardens, to the university upon his death in 1946. The college then purchased further property on its eastern boundary.

University College was opened on 30 June 1965 as a college for postgraduate students, with the classicist John Sinclair Morrison as its first President. At the time, all the undergraduate colleges of the university were single-sex institutions and University College was the first in the university to admit men and women as both students and Fellows. The college, from its outset, set out to be a cosmopolitan and egalitarian institution with distinct differences from the older, more traditional Cambridge colleges, with no Senior Combination Room, no &quot;High Table&quot; reserved for Fellows at formal dinners in the college and no portraits hung in the Dining Hall.

The college&#x27;s founding deed required the college to either find an endowment within 10 years or face dissolution. In 1972, the Wolfson Foundation agreed to provide a capital endowment and help to fund the construction of central buildings around Bredon House and the college&#x27;s East and West Courts. In recognition of this, the college was renamed Wolfson College on 1 January 1973.

The new buildings (designed by the architect Michael Mennim) were opened by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in 1977. Though most of the college&#x27;s buildings are modern, the design of the campus is similar to that of the university&#x27;s older colleges, with buildings grouped around two main courts. The floor of the entrance hall to the main building is made of thin slices of granite taken from the old London Bridge (the main section of which was taken to Arizona to be rebuilt in the late 1960s).

Further building and acquisition of neighbouring properties has continued. In the 1980s, the college purchased the house and garden owned by Sir Vivian Fuchs on the western side on the college. Plommer House on the northern side of the college was also left to the college in his will by Hugh Plommer, a founding Fellow of the college. The acquisition of property has allowed for the building of a number of new facilities, mainly funded by donations from philanthropic foundations and individuals. Other major benefactions have come from the Fairleigh Dickinson Foundation and the Toda Foundation. In the 1990s, with the help of the Gatsby Foundation, the college purchased the &quot;western field&quot; on which was built the Chancellor&#x27;s Centre and further residential blocks.

== Buildings and Grounds ==

=== The Lee Library ===
Opened in 1994, the Lee Seng Tee Library (Lee Library) was donated to the college by the Singaporean businessman and philanthropist Lee Seng Tee (whose daughter studied at the college). Lee also donated the funds used to build the Lee Seng Tee Hall. The library was designed by architects Brewer, Smith and Brewer. The ground floor foyer contains a scale model of the armillary sphere on the roof of the Peking Observatory. On the first floor is a bust of Lee Kong Chian, father of the benefactor. The library contains over 60 quiet places to work and is open 24 hours a day all year, apart from 25–26 December and 1 January. The college is located a short walk from the University Library.

In February 2018, students at the college were evacuated from the Lee library, and a number of accommodation blocks, after a WWII practice grenade was found in the President&#x27;s Garden. There were no injuries and it was soon discovered that the device was a practice grenade with no live ammunition.

=== College Gardens ===
In the first half of the twentieth century, much of the land on which the college is now situated comprised gardens which belonged to houses in Selwyn Gardens. As the college grew particular natural landmarks, such as the mulberry tree outside the Porters&#x27; lodge, were retained as features. The garden comprises a wide variety of trees, scented shrubs, dwarf conifers, as well as a distinctive range of shrubs with colourful stems.

The college&#x27;s head gardener occasionally provides a guided tour of the gardens to local interested groups. During the summer, Wolfson opens its gardens to the public as part of the NGS Open Gardens network.

==Student life==
The college is known for its entertainment events and performances, which attract visitors from many other colleges of the university. These activities include formal dinners, concerts, dancing nights, and music displays. The college frequently hosts live comedy nights, called the Wolfson Howler, featuring acts performed by comedians ranging from fellow students to internationally-recognised names.

The Club Room, at the heart of the college, includes the college bar and a dance floor space, and is a café during the day. It is the main communal space for students, and is the venue for many entertainment events.

The Wolfson College Boat Club is a popular society, and Wolfson is one of the strongest graduate rowing colleges in Cambridge.

The college is also a constituent member of the All Greys, the Cambridge mature college rugby side.

== History ==


The first known dynasty from Uttara Kannada District are Chutus of Banavasi. Uttara Kannada was the home of the Kadamba kingdom from the 350 to 525. They ruled from Banavasi. After the subjugation of the Kadambas by the Chalukyas, the district came under successive rule of empires like Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas and Vijayanagar empire. Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta is said to have stayed for a time in the district under the protection of Nawayath Sultan Jamal Al-Din at Hunnur. This place is presently known as Hosapatna and is located in the town of Honnavar. Ruins of an old mosque and its minaret can still be seen in the village. The district came under the rule of Maratha Empire in the 1750s and later part of Mysore Kingdom, who ceded it to the British at the conclusion of the Fourth Mysore War in 1799. It was initially part of Kanara district in Madras Presidency. The district was divided to North and South Kanara districts in 1859. The British finally transferred Uttara Kannada district to Bombay Presidency in 1862.

After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, Bombay Presidency was reconstituted as Bombay State. In 1956, the southern portion of Bombay State was added to Mysore State, which was renamed Karnataka in 1972.

Significant and picturesque, the Sadashivgad fort of historical importance is now a tourist destination located by the Kali river bridge, which has been built at the confluence of the river and the Arabian Sea. The renowned Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, who visited Uttara Kannada in 1882, dedicated an entire chapter of his memoirs to this town. The 22-year-old Rabindranath Tagore stayed with his brother, Satyendranath Tagore, who was the district judge in Uttara Kannada. There is a substantial amount of Chardo families in this area as they had migrated due to the persecution of the Portuguese in Goa.

===Portuguese===

Cintacora, also known as Chittakula, and Sindpur, were Portuguese and Chittakula was known to them as a very old port. When the fort of Sadashivgad was built in this area, the village also came to be known by that name. Pir fort, named for the Dargah of Shah Karamuddin, was captured and burnt by the Portuguese in 1510. The creek at the mouth of the Kali River was a trading center which came into great prominence after Sadashivgad was built and the Portuguese realized the advantages of its sheltered harbour.

===British===
In 1638, a rival English trading body, the Courteen Association, established a factory at Uttara Kannada (actually the village named Kadwad, situated eastwards on the banks of the Kali river). It was a trade port frequented by traders from Arabia and Africa. Baitkhol port (the current civil port of Uttara Kannada) was known for its natural harbour. The name Baithkhol is Arabic term, Bait-e-kol, meaning bay of safety. Muslin was the chief commodity purchased but Uttara Kannada was also a source for pepper, cardamom, cassia and coarse blue cotton cloth. Situated on India&#x27;s west coast, 50 miles south-east of Goa, Uttara Kannada was noted for its safe harbour. In 1649, the Courteen Association united with the British East India Company and Uttara Kannada became a company factory.
===Kingdom of Mysore===
In the Treaty of Mangalore signed in 1784, between Tipu Sultan and the East India Company, one finds reference to Uttara Kannada and Sadashivgad written as Karwar and Sadasewgude respectively.

Bhatkal and Honnavar were the chief ports of Tippu Sultan in the district.

===The British Empire===
The British made Carwar the district headquarters of North Canara in 1862. Since 1862, the time from which it came under Bombay presidency, Uttara Kannada was described as a first rate harbour between Bombay and Colombo.

===Maratha Empire===
It became a part of Maratha territory. It was a part of the Bombay Presidency until 1950.

<doc id="302289" wikidata="Q4203806" url="?curid=302289" title="Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS, Inc.">
<text>Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS, Inc. (194 F.3d 1211 (11th Cir. 1999)) is a United States court case that involved a longstanding dispute about the public domain copyright status of the text of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s famous speech, known by the key phrase &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;, originally delivered at the August 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The court ruled that King&#x27;s delivery of the speech was a &quot;performance&quot;, rather than a &quot;general publication&quot;, of its text, and therefore overruled a lower court judgment granting summary judgment in CBS&#x27;s favor. The two sides ultimately settled the matter out of court instead of appealing to a higher court.

==The facts==
The facts of the underlying dispute are as follows: when King delivered his speech publicly to a large audience, both live and televised, its text had not been submitted to the Register of Copyright to obtain federal copyright protection. Under state law, common law copyright subsisted only before publication of the work. Therefore, it was argued that the work had been published to the general public when he delivered the speech, with extensive media coverage, and by so doing the text of his speech entered the public domain and could be freely copied and distributed by third parties However, King registered the text of his speech the next month as being an unpublished work and after his death his estate filed this lawsuit in order to enforce the copyright.

This litigation began after CBS refused to pay King&#x27;s estate royalties for using footage from King&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech in a segment of its documentary series &quot;20th Century with Mike Wallace&quot;, which was produced in collaboration with the A&amp;E Network.

==The ruling==
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that the public performance of his speech did not constitute &quot;general publication&quot; and thus by giving this speech in public he did not forfeit his copyright in its text. Thus, King&#x27;s estate is able to require a license fee for redistribution of the speech&#x27;s text, whether in a television program, a history book, a dramatic re-enactment, or otherwise.

==Legal analysis==
The case is analyzed under the previous copyright law, the Copyright Act of 1909 (&quot;1909 Act&quot;), rather than the Copyright Act of 1976 (&quot;1976 Act&quot;) as the previous act was in force when the facts arose. Under the 1909 statute common law copyright subsisted until a work was published. Contrary to modern US practices and the Berne Convention, statutory copyright under the 1909 Act could only be obtained by completing the necessary copyright formalities, in other words, by registering the work with the Registrar of Copyrights in Washington, D.C.. CBS argued that Dr. King had not complied with the statute, and thus, by performing the work, he essentially granted it to the public domain. He had also distributed copies of the text to the press before he delivered the speech. His estate argued to the contrary that the work had never been published at the time of its initial performance by Dr. King and thus retained common law copyright. The public performance of the work did not constitute a &quot;general publication&quot; of the work but rather was a &quot;limited publication&quot; that did not divest common law rights.

===General v. limited publication===
There are two ways in which a general publication may occur. First, a general publication occurs if tangible copies of the work are distributed to the general public in such a manner as allows the public to exercise dominion and control over the work. Second, a general publication may occur if the work is exhibited or displayed in such a manner as to permit unrestricted copying by the general public.

===Distribution to the news media===
Case law also shows that distribution to the news media (as King had done with the text of the speech), as opposed to the general public, for the purpose of enabling the reporting of a contemporary newsworthy event, is only a limited publication.

From the judgment of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals:

:&quot;A performance, no matter how broad the audience, is not a publication; to hold otherwise would be to upset a long line of precedent. This conclusion is not altered by the fact that the Speech was broadcast live to a broad radio and television audience and was the subject of extensive contemporaneous news coverage. We follow the above cited case law indicating that release to the news media for contemporary coverage of a newsworthy event is only a limited publication.&quot;

==Concurring reasons==
The main judgment was given by Chief Judge Anderson and Senior Circuit Judges Roney and Cook.

Judge Cook gave separate concurring reasons. He did not accept the limited v. general publication rule as being determinative; his thinking centered on the fact that no tangible copy without a copyright notice, which the law then required, was distributed before the registration of the work. That fact and the oral speech being distributed to the media both determined that the copyright was not put into the public domain.

==Outcome==
The ruling that the copyright was in force meant that the case was remanded to the district court and the Estate&#x27;s lawsuit against CBS could proceed. CBS and the King Estate reached a settlement before proceeding further in the courts.

<text>The Parliament of Australia (officially the Parliament of the Commonwealth and also known as the Federal Parliament) is the federal legislature of Australia. It consists of three elements: the monarch of Australia (represented by the governor-general), the Senate (the upper house), and the House of Representatives (the lower house). It combines elements from the Westminster system, in which the party or coalition with a majority in the lower house is entitled to form a government, and the United States Congress, which affords equal representation to each of the states, and scrutinises legislation before it can be signed into law. 

The upper house, the Senate, consists of 76 members: twelve for each state, and two for each of the self-governing territories. Senators are elected using the proportional system and as a result, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. The governing party or coalition has not held a majority in the Senate since 1981 (except between 2005 and 2007) and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and independents to get legislation passed.

The lower house, the House of Representatives, currently consists of 151 members, each elected using full preferential voting from single-member electorates (also known as electoral divisions or seats). This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major political groups, the centreright Coalition (consisting of the Liberal and National parties) and the centreleft Labor Party. The government of the day must achieve the confidence of this House in order to gain and remain in power.

The House of Representatives has a maximum term of three years, although it can be dissolved early. The Senate has fixed terms, with half of the state senators&#x27; terms expiring every three years (the terms of the four territory senators are linked to House elections). As a result, House and Senate elections almost always coincide. A deadlock-breaking mechanism known as a double dissolution can be used to dissolve the full Senate as well as the House if the Senate refuses to pass a piece of legislation passed by the House.

The two houses of Parliament meet in separate chambers of Parliament House (except in rare joint sittings) on Capital Hill in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory.

==History==
===Temporary home in Melbourne (1901–1927)===
The Commonwealth of Australia came into being on 1 January 1901 with the federation of the six Australian colonies. The inaugural election took place on 29 and 30 March and the first Australian Parliament was opened on 9 May 1901 in Melbourne by Prince George, Duke of Cornwall and York, later King George V. The only building in Melbourne that was large enough to accommodate the 14,000 guests was the western annexe of the Royal Exhibition Building. After the official opening, from 1901 to 1927 the Parliament met in Parliament House, Melbourne, which it borrowed from the Parliament of Victoria (which sat, instead, in the Royal Exhibition Building until 1927). During this time, Sir Frederick Holder became the first speaker and also the first (and thus far only) parliamentarian to die during a sitting. On 23 July 1909 during an acrimonious debate that had extended through the night to 5 am, Holder exclaimed: &quot;Dreadful, dreadful!&quot; before collapsing as a result of a cerebral haemorrhage.
===Old Parliament House (1927–1988)===
The Constitution provided that a new national capital would be established for the nation. This was a compromise at Federation due to the rivalry between the two largest Australian cities, Sydney and Melbourne, which both wished to become the new capital. The site of Canberra was selected for the location of the nation&#x27;s capital city in 1908. A competition was announced on 30 June 1914 to design Parliament House, with prize money of £7,000. However, due to the start of World War I the next month, the competition was cancelled. It was re-announced in August 1916, but again postponed indefinitely on 24 November 1916. In the meantime, John Smith Murdoch, the Commonwealth&#x27;s chief architect, worked on the design as part of his official duties. He had little personal enthusiasm for the project, as he felt it was a waste of money and expenditure on it could not be justified at the time. Nevertheless, he designed the building by default.

The construction of Old Parliament House, as it is called today, commenced on 28 August 1923 and was completed in early 1927. It was built by the Commonwealth Department of Works, using workers and materials from all over Australia. The final cost was about £600,000, which was more than three times the original estimate. It was designed to house the parliament for a maximum of 50 years until a permanent facility could be built, but was actually used for more than 60 years.

The building was opened on 9 May 1927 by the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). The opening ceremonies were both splendid and incongruous, given the sparsely built nature of Canberra of the time and its small population. The building was extensively decorated with Union Jacks and Australian flags and bunting. Temporary stands were erected bordering the lawns in front of the Parliament and these were filled with crowds. A Wiradjuri elder, Jimmy Clements, was one of only two Aboriginal Australians present, having walked for about a week from Brungle Station (near Tumut) to be at the event. Dame Nellie Melba sang &quot;God Save the King&quot;. The Duke of York unlocked the front doors with a golden key, and led the official party into King&#x27;s Hall where he unveiled the statue of his father, King George V. The Duke then opened the first parliamentary session in the new Senate Chamber.
===New Parliament House (1988–present)===
In 1978 the Fraser government decided to proceed with a new building on Capital Hill, and the Parliament House Construction Authority was created. A two-stage competition was announced, for which the Authority consulted the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and, together with the National Capital Development Commission, made available to competitors a brief and competition documents. The design competition drew 329 entries from 29 countries.

The competition winner was the Philadelphia-based architectural firm of Mitchell/Giurgola, with the on-site work directed by the Italian-born architect Romaldo Giurgola, with a design which involved burying most of the building under Capital Hill, and capping the edifice with an enormous spire topped by a large Australian flag. The façades, however, included deliberate imitation of some of the patterns of the Old Parliament House, so that there is a slight resemblance despite the massive difference of scale. The building was also designed to sit above Old Parliament House when seen from a distance.

Construction began in 1981, and the House was intended to be ready by Australia Day, 1988, the 200th anniversary of European settlement in Australia. It was expected to cost $220 million. Neither the deadline nor the budget was met. In the end it cost more than $1.1 billion to build.

New Parliament House was finally opened by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, on 1988, the anniversary of the opening of both the first Federal Parliament in Melbourne on 1901 and the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra on 1927.

In March 2020, the 46th Parliament of Australia was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia; an adjournment rather than prorogation. Its committees would continue to operate using technology. This unprecedented move was accompanied by two motions raised by the Attorney-General of Australia, Christian Porter, and passed on 23 March 2020. One motion was designed to allow MPs to participate in parliament by electronic means, if agreed by the major parties and the speaker; the second determined that with the agreement of the two major parties, the standing orders could be amended without requiring an absolute majority.

==Composition and electoral systems==
The Constitution establishes the Commonwealth Parliament, consisting of three components: the King of Australia, the Senate and the House of Representatives.
===Monarch===
All of the constitutional functions of the King are exercisable by the governor-general (except the power to appoint the governor-general), whom the King appoints as his federal representative in Australia on the advice of the prime minister. However, by convention, the governor-general exercises these powers only upon the advice of ministers, except for limited circumstances covered by the reserve powers.

In Parliament, the monarch legally shares co-equally the law making powers of the Commonwealth with the Senate and House of Representatives. As such their royal assent (usually expressed by the governor-general) is required for a bill to become an act and thus part of the law. The government does not formally advise the governor-general to grant assent, but it is expected that they will act in accordance with the democratically elected houses of Parliament and assent has never been refused.

===Senate===

The upper house of the Australian Parliament is the Senate, which consists of 76 members. Like the United States Senate, on which it was partly modelled, the Australian Senate includes an equal number of senators from each state, regardless of population.

The Constitution allows Parliament to determine the number of senators by legislation, provided that the six original states are equally represented. Furthermore, the Constitution provides that each original state is entitled to at least six senators. However, neither of these provisions applies to any newly admitted states, or to territories. Since an act was passed in 1973, senators have been elected to represent the territories. Currently, the two Northern Territory senators represent the residents of the Northern Territory as well as the Australian external territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The two Australian Capital Territory senators represent the Australian Capital Territory, the Jervis Bay Territory and since 1 July 2016, Norfolk Island. Only half of the state Senate seats go up for re-election each three years (except in the case of a double dissolution) as they serve six-year terms; however territory Senators do not have staggered terms and hence face re-election every three years.

Until 1949, each state elected the constitutional minimum of six senators. This number increased to ten from the 1949 election, and was increased again to twelve from the 1984 election. The system for electing senators has changed several times since Federation. The original arrangement used a first-past-the-post block voting, on a state-by-state basis. This was replaced in 1919 by preferential block voting. Block voting tended to produce landslide majorities. For instance, from 1920 to 1923 the Nationalist Party had 35 of the 36 senators, and from 1947 to 1950, the Australian Labor Party had 33 of the 36 senators.

In 1948, single transferable vote proportional representation on a state-by-state basis became the method for electing senators. This change has been described as an &quot;institutional revolution&quot; that has led to the rise of a number of minor parties such as the Democratic Labor Party, Australian Democrats and Australian Greens who have taken advantage of this system to achieve parliamentary representation and the balance of power. From the 1984 election, group ticket voting was introduced in order to reduce a high rate of informal voting but in 2016, group tickets were abolished to end the influence that preference deals amongst parties had on election results and a form of optional preferential voting was introduced.

Section 15 of the Constitution provides that a casual vacancy of a senator shall be filled by the state Parliament. If the previous senator was a member of a particular political party the replacement must come from the same party, but the state Parliament may choose not to fill the vacancy, in which case section 11 requires the Senate to proceed regardless. If the state Parliament happens to be in recess when the vacancy occurs, the Constitution provides that the state governor (acting on the advice of the respective state government) can appoint someone to fill the place until fourteen days after the state Parliament resumes sitting. The state Parliament can also be recalled to ratify a replacement.

===House of Representatives===

The lower house of the Australian Parliament, the House of Representatives, is made up of single member electorates with a population of roughly equal size. As is convention in the Westminster system, the party or coalition of parties that has the majority in this House forms the government with the leader of that party or coalition becoming the prime minister. If the government loses the confidence of the House, they are expected to call a new election or resign.

Parliament may determine the number of members of the House of Representatives but the Constitution provides that this number must be &quot;as nearly as practicable, twice the number of Senators&quot;; this requirement is commonly called the &quot;nexus clause&quot;. Hence, the House presently consists of 151 members. Each state is allocated seats based on its population; however, each original state, regardless of size, is guaranteed at least five seats. The Constitution does not guarantee representation for the territories. Parliament granted a seat to the Northern Territory in 1922, and to the Australian Capital Territory in 1948; these territorial representatives, however, had only limited voting rights until 1968. Federal electorates have their boundaries redrawn or redistributed whenever a state or territory has its number of seats adjusted, if electorates are not generally matched by population size or if seven years have passed since the most recent redistribution.

From 1901 to 1949, the House consisted of either 74 or 75 members (the Senate had 36). Between 1949 and 1984, it had between 121 and 127 members (the Senate had 60 until 1975, when it increased to 64). In 1977, the High Court ordered that the size of the House be reduced from 127 to 124 members to comply with the nexus provision. In 1984, both the Senate and the House were enlarged; since then the House has had between 148 and 151 members (the Senate has 76).

First-past-the-post voting was used to elect members of the House of Representatives until in 1918 the Nationalist Party government, a predecessor of the modern-day Liberal Party of Australia, changed the lower house voting system to full preferential voting for the subsequent 1919 election. This was in response to Labor unexpectedly winning the 1918 Swan by-election with the largest primary vote, due to vote splitting among the conservative parties. This system has remained in place ever since, allowing the Coalition parties to safely contest the same seats. Full-preference preferential voting re-elected the Bob Hawke government at the 1990 election, the first time in federal history that Labor had obtained a net benefit from preferential voting.

===Both houses===
It is not possible to be simultaneously a member of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, but a number of people have been members of both houses at different times in their parliamentary career.

Only Australian citizens are eligible for election to either house. They must not also be a subject or citizen of a &quot;foreign power&quot;. When the Constitution was drafted, all Australians (and other inhabitants of the British empire) were British subjects, so the word &quot;foreign&quot; meant outside the Empire. But, in the landmark case &quot;Sue v Hill&quot; (1999), the High Court of Australia ruled that, at least since the passage of the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot;, Britain has been a &quot;foreign power&quot;, so that British citizens are also excluded.

Compulsory voting was introduced for federal elections in 1924. The immediate justification for compulsory voting was the low voter turnout (59.38%) at the 1922 federal election, down from 71.59% at the 1919 federal election. Compulsory voting was not on the platform of either the Stanley Bruce-led Nationalist/Country party coalition government or the Matthew Charlton-led Labor opposition. The actual initiative for change was made by Herbert Payne, a backbench Tasmanian Nationalist Senator who on 16 July 1924 introduced a private Senator&#x27;s bill in the Senate. Payne&#x27;s bill was passed with little debate (the House of Representatives agreeing to it in less than an hour), and in neither house was a division required, hence no votes were recorded against the bill. The 1925 federal election was the first to be conducted under compulsory voting, which saw the turnout figure rise to 91.4%. The turnout increased to about 95% within a couple of elections and has stayed at about that level since.

Since 1973, citizens have had the right to vote upon turning 18. Prior to this it was 21.

Australian Federal Police officers armed with assault rifles have been situated in the Federal Parliament since 2015. It is the first time in Australian history that a parliament has possessed armed personnel.

==Procedure==
Each of the two Houses elects a presiding officer. The presiding officer of the Senate is called the President; that of the House of Representatives is the Speaker. Elections for these positions are by secret ballot. Both offices are conventionally filled by members of the governing party, but the presiding officers are expected to oversee debate and enforce the rules in an impartial manner.

The Constitution authorises Parliament to set the quorum for each chamber. The quorum of the Senate is one-quarter of the total membership (nineteen); that of the House of Representatives is one-fifth of the total membership (thirty-one). In theory, if a quorum is not present, then a House may not continue to meet. In practice, members usually agree not to notice that a quorum is not present, so that debates on routine bills can continue while other members attend to other business outside the chamber. Sometimes the Opposition will &quot;call a quorum&quot; as a tactic to annoy the Government or delay proceedings, particularly when the Opposition feels it has been unfairly treated in the House. Proceedings are interrupted until a quorum is present. It is the responsibility of the government whip to ensure that, when a quorum is called, enough government members are present to form a quorum.

Both Houses may determine motions by voice vote: the presiding officer puts the question, and, after listening to shouts of &quot;Aye&quot; and &quot;No&quot; from the members, announces the result. The announcement of the presiding officer settles the question, unless at least two members demand a &quot;division&quot;, or a recorded vote. In that case the bells are rung throughout Parliament House summoning Senators or Members to the chamber. During a division, members who favour the motion move to the right side of the chamber (the side to the Speaker&#x27;s or President&#x27;s right), and those opposed move to the left. They are then counted by &quot;tellers&quot; (government and opposition whips), and the motion is passed or defeated accordingly. In the Senate, in order not to deprive a state of a vote in what is supposed to be a states&#x27; house, the president is permitted a vote along with other senators (however, that right is rarely exercised); in the case of a tie, the president does not have a casting vote and the motion fails. In the House of Representatives, the Speaker does not vote, but has a casting vote if there is a tie.

Most legislation is introduced into the House of Representatives and goes through a number of stages before it becomes law. The legislative process occurs in English, although other Australian parliaments have permitted use of Indigenous languages with English translation. Government bills are drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.

The first stage is a first reading, where the legislation is introduced to the chamber, then there is a second reading, where a vote is taken on the general outlines of the bill. Although rare, the legislation can then be considered by a House committee, which reports back to the House on any recommendations. This is followed by a consideration in detail stage, where the House can consider the clauses of the bill in detail and make any amendments. This is finally followed by a third reading, where the bill is either passed or rejected by the House. If passed, the legislation is then sent to the Senate, which has a similar structure of debate and passage except that consideration of bills by Senate committees is more common than in the House and the consideration in detail stage is replaced by a committee of the whole. Once a bill has been passed by both Houses in the same form, it is then presented to the governor-general for royal assent.
==Functions==
The principal function of the Parliament is to pass laws, or legislation. Any parliamentarian may introduce a proposed law (a bill), except for a money bill (a bill proposing an expenditure or levying a tax), which must be introduced in the House of Representatives. In practice, the great majority of bills are introduced by ministers. Bills introduced by other members are called private members&#x27; bills. All bills must be passed by both houses and assented to by the governor-general to become law. The Senate has the same legislative powers as the House, except that it may not amend or introduce money bills, only pass or reject them. The enacting formula for acts of Parliament since 1990 is simply &quot;The Parliament of Australia enacts:&quot;.

Commonwealth legislative power is limited to that granted in the Constitution. Powers not specified are considered &quot;residual powers&quot;, and remain the domain of the states. Section 51 grants the Commonwealth power over areas such as taxation, external affairs, defence and marriage. Section 51 also allows state parliaments to refer matters to the Commonwealth to legislate.

Section 96 of the Australian Constitution gives the Commonwealth Parliament the power to grant money to any State, &quot;on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit&quot;. In effect, the Commonwealth can make grants subject to states implementing particular policies in their fields of legislative responsibility. Such grants, known as &quot;tied grants&quot; (since they are tied to a particular purpose), have been used to give the federal parliament influence over state policy matters such as public hospitals and schools.

The Parliament performs other functions besides legislation. It can discuss urgency motions or matters of public importance: these provide a forum for debates on public policy matters. Senators and members can move motions on a range of matters relevant to their constituents, and can also move motions of censure against the government or individual ministers. On most sitting days in each house there is a session called question time in which senators and members address questions without notice to the prime minister and other ministers. Senators and members can also present petitions from their constituents. Both houses have an extensive system of committees in which draft bills are debated, matters of public policy are inquired into, evidence is taken and public servants are questioned. There are also joint committees, composed of members from both houses.

==Conflict between the houses==

In the event of conflict between the two houses over the final form of legislation, the Constitution provides for a simultaneous dissolution of both houses – known as a double dissolution. Section 57 of the Constitution states that, 

In an election following a double dissolution, each state elects their entire 12-seat Senate delegation, while the two territories represented in the Senate each elect their two senators as they would in a regular federal election. Because all seats are contested in the same election, it is easier for smaller parties to win seats under the single transferable vote system: the quota for the election of each senator in each Australian state in a full Senate election is 7.69% of the vote, while in a normal half-Senate election the quota is 14.28%.

If the conflict continues after such an election, the governor-general may convene a joint sitting of both houses to consider the bill or bills, including any amendments which have been previously proposed in either house, or any new amendments. If a bill is passed by an absolute majority of the total membership of the joint sitting, it is treated as though it had been passed separately by both houses, and is presented for royal assent. With proportional representation, and the small majorities in the Senate compared to the generally larger majorities in the House of Representatives, and the requirement that the number of members of the lower house be &quot;nearly as practicable&quot; twice that of the Senate, a joint sitting after a double dissolution is more likely than not to lead to a victory for the lower house over the Senate. This provision has only been invoked on one occasion, after the election following the 1974 double dissolution. However, there are other occasions when the two houses meet as one.

==Committees==

In addition to the work of the main chambers, both the Senate and the House of Representatives have a large number of investigatory and scrutiny committees which deal with matters referred to them by their respective houses or ministers. They provide the opportunity for all members and senators to ask questions of witnesses, including ministers and public officials, as well as conduct inquiries, and examine policy and legislation. Once a particular inquiry is completed the members of the committee can then produce a report, to be tabled in Parliament, outlining what they have discovered as well as any recommendations that they have produced for the government or house to consider.

The ability of the houses of Parliament to establish committees is referenced in section 49 of the Constitution, which states that, 

Parliamentary committees can be given a wide range of powers. One of the most significant powers is the ability to summon people to attend hearings in order to give evidence and submit documents. Anyone who attempts to hinder the work of a Parliamentary committee may be found to be in contempt of Parliament. There are a number of ways that witnesses can be found in contempt, these include; refusing to appear before a committee when summoned, refusing to answer a question during a hearing or to produce a document, or later being found to have lied to or misled a committee. Anyone who attempts to influence a witness may also be found in contempt. Other powers include, the ability to meet throughout Australia, to establish subcommittees and to take evidence in both public and private hearings.

Proceedings of committees are considered to have the same legal standing as proceedings of Parliament, they are recorded by Hansard, except for private proceedings, and also operate under the protections of parliamentary privilege. Every participant, including committee members and witnesses giving evidence, is protected from being prosecuted under any civil or criminal action for anything they may say during a hearing. Written evidence and documents received by a committee are also protected.

Types of committees include:

Standing committees, which are established on an ongoing basis and are responsible for scrutinising bills and topics referred to them by the chamber or minister; examining the government&#x27;s budget and activities (in what is called the budget estimates process); and for examining departmental annual reports and activities.

Select committees, which are temporary committees, established in order to consider a particular matter. A select committee expires when it has published its final report on an inquiry.

Domestic committees, which are responsible for administering aspects of the Parliament&#x27;s own affairs. These include the Selection Committees of both Houses that determine how the Parliament will deal with particular pieces of legislation and private members&#x27; business, and the Privileges Committees that deal with matters of parliamentary privilege.

Legislative scrutiny committees, which examine legislation and regulations to determine their impact on individual rights and accountability.

Joint committees are also established to include both members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Joint committees may be standing (ongoing) or select (temporary) in nature.
==Relationship with the Government==
Under the Constitution, the governor-general has the power to appoint and dismiss ministers who administer government departments. In practice, the governor-general chooses ministers in accordance with the traditions of the Westminster system. The governor-general appoints as prime minister the leader of the party that has a majority of seats in the House of Representatives; the governor-general then, on the advice of the prime minister, appoints the other ministers, chosen from the majority party or coalition of parties.

These ministers then meet in a council known as Cabinet. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. The Constitution does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the Federal Executive Council, which is Australia&#x27;s highest formal governmental body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the executive council. The governor-general is bound by convention to follow the advice of the executive council on almost all occasions, giving it de facto executive power. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office of vice-president of the executive council and acts as presiding officer of the executive council in the absence of the governor-general. The Federal Executive Council is the Australian equivalent of the executive councils and privy councils in other Commonwealth realms such as the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada and the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

A minister is not required to be a senator or member of the House of Representatives at the time of their appointment, but their office is forfeited if they do not become a member of either house within three months of their appointment. This provision was included in the Constitution (section 64) to enable the inaugural ministry, led by Edmund Barton, to be appointed on 1 January 1901, even though the first federal elections were not scheduled to be held until 29 and 30 March.

After the 1949 election, John Spicer and Bill Spooner became ministers in the Menzies Government on 19 December, despite their terms in the Senate not beginning until 22 February 1950.

The provision was also used after the disappearance and presumed death of the Liberal prime minister Harold Holt in December 1967. The Liberal Party elected John Gorton, then a senator, as its new leader, and he was sworn in as prime minister on 10 January 1968 (following an interim ministry led by John McEwen). On 1 February, Gorton resigned from the Senate to stand for the 24 February by-election in Holt&#x27;s former House of Representatives electorate of Higgins due to the convention that the prime minister be a member of the lower house. For 22 days (2 to 23 February inclusive) he was prime minister while a member of neither house of parliament.

On a number of occasions when ministers have retired from their seats prior to an election, or stood but lost their own seats in the election, they have retained their ministerial offices until the next government is sworn in.

==Role of the Senate==

Unlike upper Houses in other Westminster system governments, the Senate is not a vestigial body with limited legislative power. Rather it was intended to play – and does play – an active role in legislation. Rather than being modelled solely after the House of Lords, as the Canadian Senate was, the Australian Senate was in part modelled after the United States Senate, by giving equal representation to each state. The Constitution intended to give less populous states added voice in a federal legislature, while also providing for the revising role of an upper house in the Westminster system.

One of the functions of the Senate, both directly and through its committees, is to scrutinise government activity. The vigour of this scrutiny has been fuelled for many years by the fact that the party in government has seldom had a majority in the Senate. Whereas in the House of Representatives the government&#x27;s majority has sometimes limited that chamber&#x27;s capacity to implement executive scrutiny, the opposition and minor parties have been able to use their Senate numbers as a basis for conducting inquiries into government operations.

The Constitution prevents the Senate from originating or amending the annual appropriation bills &quot;for the ordinary annual services of the Government&quot;; they may only defer or reject them. As a result, whilst the framers of the Constitution intended that the executive government would require the support of the House of Representatives, the text of the Constitution also effectively allows the Senate to bring down the government once a year by blocking the annual appropriations bills, also known as blocking supply&quot;.&quot; 

The ability to block supply was the origin of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. The Opposition used its numbers in the Senate to defer supply bills, refusing to deal with them until an election was called for both houses of parliament, an election which it hoped to win. The prime minister, Gough Whitlam, contested the legitimacy of the blocking and refused to resign. The prime minister argued that a government may continue in office for as long as it has the support of the lower house, while the opposition argued that any government who has been denied supply is obliged to either call new elections or resign. In response to the deadlock, the governor-general Sir John Kerr dismissed Whitlam&#x27;s government and appointed Malcolm Fraser as caretaker prime minister on the understanding that he could secure supply and would immediately call new elections. This action in itself was a source of controversy and debate continues on the proper usage of the Senate&#x27;s ability to block supply and on whether such a power should even exist.

The blocking of supply alone cannot force a double dissolution. There must be legislation repeatedly blocked by the Senate which the government can then choose to use as a trigger for a double dissolution.

==Parliamentary departments==
There are four parliamentary departments supporting the Australian Parliament:
*Department of the Senate, which consists of seven Offices and whose work is determined by the Senate and its committees.
*Department of the House of Representatives, which provides various services to support the smooth operation of the House of Representatives, its committees and certain joint committees.
*Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS), which performs diverse support functions, such as research; the Parliamentary Library of Australia; broadcasting on radio and TV; Hansard transcripts; computing services; and general maintenance and security.
*Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO), which &quot;improves transparency around fiscal and budget policy issues&quot; and provides costing services to parliamentarians.

==Privileges==
Members of the Australian Parliament do not have legal immunity: they can be arrested and tried for any offence. They do, however, have parliamentary privilege: they cannot be sued for anything they say in Parliament about each other or about persons outside the Parliament. This privilege extends to reporting in the media of anything a senator or member says in Parliament. The proceedings of parliamentary committees, wherever they meet, are also covered by privilege, and this extends to witnesses before such committees.

From the beginning of Federation until 1987, parliamentary privilege operated under section 49 of the Constitution, which established the privileges of both houses and their members to be the same as the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at the time of the Constitution&#x27;s enactment. The Parliament was also given the power to amend its privileges. In 1987, the Parliament passed the &quot;Parliamentary Privileges Act&quot;, which clarified the meaning and extent of privilege as well as how the Parliament deals with breaches.

There is a legal offence called contempt of Parliament. A person who speaks or acts in a manner contemptuous of the Parliament or its members can be tried and, if convicted, imprisoned. The Parliament previously had the power to hear such cases itself, and did so in the Browne–Fitzpatrick privilege case, 1955. This power has now been delegated to the courts. There have been few convictions. In May 2007, Harriet Swift, an anti-logging activist from New South Wales was convicted and reprimanded for contempt of Parliament, after she wrote fictitious press releases and letters purporting to be from Federal MP Gary Nairn as an April Fools&#x27; Day prank.

==Broadcasting==
Radio broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings began on 10 July 1946. They were originally broadcast on Radio National. Since August 1994 they have been broadcast on ABC News, a government-owned channel set up specifically for this function. It operates 24 hours a day and broadcasts other news items when parliament is not sitting.

The first televised parliamentary event was the historic 1974 Joint Sitting. Regular free-to-air television broadcasts of question time began in August 1990 from the Senate and February 1991 from the House of Representatives. Question time from the House of Representatives is televised live, and the Senate question time is recorded and broadcast later that day. Other free-to-air televised broadcasts include: the Treasurer&#x27;s Budget speech and the Leader of the Opposition&#x27;s reply to the Budget two days later; the opening of Parliament by the governor-general; the swearing-in of governors-general; and addresses to the Parliament by visiting heads of state.

In 2009, the pay TV company Foxtel launched A-SPAN, now called Sky News Extra, which broadcasts live sittings of the House of Representatives and the Senate, parliamentary committee meetings and political press conferences.

The Parliament House official website provides free extensive daily proceedings of both chambers as well as committee hearings live on the Internet.

==Current parliament==

The current Parliament is the 47th Australian Parliament. The most recent federal election was held on 21 May 2022 and the 47th Parliament first sat on 26 July.

The outcome of the 2022 election saw the Labor Party return to government for the first time in nine years, winning 77 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives (an increase of 9 seats compared to the 2019 election), a majority government. The Liberal/National Coalition, which had been in power since the 2013 election, lost 19 seats compared to the previous election to finish with 58 seats, and went into opposition. The crossbench grew to its largest ever size, with 16 members; 4 Greens, 1 Centre Alliance MP, 1 Katter&#x27;s Australian Party MP, and 12 independents.

In the Senate, the Labor government retained 26 seats, the Liberal/National Coalition dropped to 32 seats, the Greens increased to 12 seats, the Jacqui Lambie Network had 2 seats, One Nation had 2 seats, the United Australia Party won 1 seat, and independent David Pocock won 1 seat in the Australian Capital Territory.

On 17 February 2023, Alan Tudge announced that he would retire from Parliament and resign as the member for the Division of Aston. This triggered a by-election held on 1 April 2023, contested by Liberal Roshena Campbell and Labor&#x27;s Mary Doyle. Doyle was declared elected, marking the first time in 103 years that a government won a by-election in a seat held by the opposition. This increased the balance of the government&#x27;s power by one in the lower house from 77 to 78.

==Historical compositions==
===Senate===
The Senate has included representatives from a range of political parties, including several parties that have seldom or never had representation in the House of Representatives, but which have consistently secured a small but significant level of electoral support, as the table shows.

Results represent the composition of the Senate after the elections. The full Senate has been contested on eight occasions; the inaugural election and seven double dissolutions. These are underlined and highlighted in puce.

===House of Representatives===
A two-party system has existed in the Australian House of Representatives since the two non-Labor parties merged in 1909. The 1910 election was the first to elect a majority government, with the Australian Labor Party concurrently winning the first Senate majority. Prior to 1909 a three-party system existed in the chamber. A two-party-preferred vote (2PP) has been calculated since the 1919 change from first-past-the-post to preferential voting and subsequent introduction of the Coalition. ALP = Australian Labor Party, L+NP = grouping of Liberal/National/LNP/CLP Coalition parties (and predecessors), Oth = other parties and independents.

<text>Lieutenant John Felton ( – 29 November 1628) was an English army officer who assassinated George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham by stabbing him to death in the Greyhound Pub at Portsmouth on 23 August 1628. Charles I of England trusted Buckingham, who made himself rich in the process but proved a failure at foreign and military policy. Charles gave him command of a military expedition against Spain in 1625. It was a total fiasco with many dying from disease and starvation. He led another disastrous military campaign in 1627. Buckingham was hated and the damage to the king&#x27;s reputation was irreparable. Buckingham&#x27;s assassination by Felton was widely celebrated by the English public even after Felton&#x27;s execution.

==Early life==
John Felton was born around 1595, possibly in Suffolk, to a family related to the Feltons of Playford in Suffolk and distantly related to Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel. His father, Thomas Felton, prospered as a pursuivant, one appointed to the task of hunting down those who refused to attend Anglican church services. His mother, Elanor, was the daughter of William Wight, the one-time mayor of Durham.

The family&#x27;s fortunes declined when Thomas&#x27; lucrative position was given to Henry Spiller in 1602. Thomas died around 1611, while he was imprisoned in the Fleet Prison for debt, although his widow was later able to secure a £100 per annum pension from the crown. Felton&#x27;s brother Edmund Felton also fell into debt trying to right the wrongs done against his father by Spiller, through petitions and printing and distribution of books and pamphlets.

==Army career==
Nothing is known of John Felton&#x27;s life until the mid-1620s, when he was an army officer. He served in the Cádiz Expedition of 1625, an attempt to capture the Spanish city of Cadiz that was backed by Buckingham. This resulted in a decisive Spanish victory, with 7,000 English troops and 62 out of 105 ships lost. Felton then served as a lieutenant in Ireland in 1626, during which time his commanding officer died and Felton tried, but failed, to be appointed as his replacement.

In May or June 1627 Felton petitioned to be appointed a captain on Buckingham&#x27;s military expedition of 1627, part of the Anglo-French War of 1627 to 1629. The purpose of the expedition was to capture the French fortress of Saint-Martin-de-Ré on the Île de Ré. This would secure the sea-approaches to the city of La Rochelle and encourage the French Huguenot population of the city to rebel against the French crown.

Felton had connections in political circles but despite help from two Members of Parliament, Sir William Uvedale and Sir William Beecher, his initial request to join the expedition was turned down. Two months later he was appointed a lieutenant with the second wave of troops that left for the Île de Ré in August 1627.

The expedition was a disaster for the English; the troops were ill-supplied and lacked the large artillery needed for the siege they laid at Saint-Martin-de-Ré. Many were lost on 27 October, during a final, desperate assault on the fortress of Saint-Martin, which failed because the attackers&#x27; siege ladders were shorter than the walls of the fortress. The English evacuated soon after, losing 5,000 out of 7,000 troops during the campaign.

After returning to England Felton lived in London for nine months. Although his mother, brother and sister lived in the city he did not stay with them but lived in a lodging house. Those who encountered him during this time later described him as being taciturn and melancholic. His sister recalled that, since his return from Ré, Felton had been &quot;much troubled by dreams of fighting&quot;. This was possibly indicative of what would be described as post-traumatic stress disorder in modern terms. During this time Felton submitted petitions to members of the Privy Council over two matters, £80 of back-pay he believed he was owed and his promotion to captain, which he believed he had been unfairly denied. He had no success in resolving these grievances and came to believe the Duke of Buckingham was responsible for both of them.

==Assassination of Buckingham==

Buckingham was hugely unpopular in the land for the national disgrace of defeat by the French, although with the help of the king, Charles I, he had avoided legal moves against him by Parliament for corruption and incompetence. By August 1628 Felton had come to believe that his personal grievances against Buckingham were part of a larger picture of treacherous and wicked governance of England by the Duke. He resolved to kill Buckingham and after saying goodbye to his family travelled to Portsmouth. Buckingham was staying there while trying to organise a new military campaign.

On the morning of Saturday 23 August Buckingham left his lodgings, the Greyhound Inn in Portsmouth, after having breakfast. Felton was able to make his way through the crowd that surrounded Buckingham and stabbed him in the chest with a dagger. He missed a chance of escape in the ensuing chaos and shortly after the murder he presented himself before the crowd that had gathered and, expecting to be well received, announced his guilt. He was immediately arrested and taken before magistrates, who sent him to London for interrogation.

==Felton&#x27;s case==
The authorities were convinced Felton had not acted alone and were anxious to get from him the names of any accomplices. The Privy Council attempted to have Felton questioned under torture on the rack but the judges resisted, unanimously declaring its use to be contrary to the laws of England.

While the truth of this story is contested, and indeed widely doubted, it remains the case that the Privy Council never issued a torture warrant again, and the last warrant under the Royal Signet was issued in 1640. Indeed in 1641 the Star Chamber was abolished by the Habeas Corpus Act 1640.

==Aftermath==

The unpopularity of the Duke meant Felton&#x27;s action was met with widespread approval. While he was awaiting trial it was celebrated in poems and pamphlets. Copies of written statements he carried in his hat during the assassination were also widely circulated. A poem by the Oxford scholar and cleric Zouch Townley claimed that Felton had saved England and King Charles from the corruption of Buckingham&#x27;s politicking. The number of surviving copies of this work suggests it was widely circulated. However contemporary reports state Townley fled to Holland after it had become known he was the author.
An anonymous poem, &quot;Upon the Duke&#x27;s Death&quot;, begins
The work goes on at length with an argument that Buckingham&#x27;s assassination was not even a crime but that the Duke himself had been a criminal who had placed himself above the law.

Other works contrasted the Duke, who was claimed to be popish, cowardly, effeminate and corrupt, with Felton, who was described as Protestant, brave, manly and virtuous. The writer Owen Feltham described Felton as a second Brutus.

The son of Alexander Gill the Elder was sentenced to a fine of £2,000 and the removal of his ears after being overheard drinking to the health of Felton and stating that Buckingham had joined King James I in hell. However these punishments were remitted after his father and Archbishop Laud appealed to King Charles I.

After being tried and found guilty Felton was hanged at Tyburn on 29 November 1628. In a miscalculation by authorities, his body was sent back to Portsmouth for exhibition where, rather than becoming a lesson in disgrace, it was made an object of veneration. A gulf was revealed between a public who revered Felton and the authorities that punished him.

There are 18th and 19th century accounts of a dagger, claimed to have been the one used by Felton, being on display at Newnham Paddox in Warwickshire. Newnham Paddox was the family seat of the Earls of Denbigh and Buckingham&#x27;s sister, Susan, had married William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh. How the dagger (if authentic) came to be at Newham Paddox was explained by it being recovered after the assassination and sent to Buckingham&#x27;s widow, Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham, who was also living there.

== In fiction ==
===&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;===
Felton&#x27;s assassination of the Duke was fictionalised in Alexandre Dumas, père&#x27;s &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1844) and features in several film adaptations of the novel.

In Dumas&#x27; novel, Felton is portrayed as a Puritan who serves the fictional Lord de Winter. Felton is entrusted by de Winter to guard Milady de Winter, the widow of de Winter&#x27;s brother and a French spy. Milady&#x27;s master, Cardinal Richelieu, has ordered her to deter Buckingham from helping La Rochelle or else he will reveal his affair with the French Queen and if he still pursue his goals to have Buckingham murdered so that he will not aid the Huguenot cause in the city of La Rochelle. As she and Felton question each other she puts on a façade of sorrow and broken innocence, even pretending to be a Puritan like Felton and inventing a story of being drugged and raped by Buckingham. Milady manages to seduce Felton in a matter of days and they escape together. Felton is sent to stab Buckingham, which he then justifies on the grounds of his lack of promotion in order to protect Milady. However Felton realises that he has been deceived when Milady sails away without him, and he is left to be hanged for his crime.

In the 1961 French film &quot;Les Trois Mousquetaires&quot;, Felton was played by Sacha Pitoëff; in the 1969 film of the &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; Felton is played by Christopher Walken.

In the 1973 film &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and its 1974 sequel &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot;, Felton is played by Michael Gothard. Felton appears briefly in the first film as a Puritan servant of Buckingham (Lord de Winter does not appear in the films). The second film portrays his gradual seduction by Milady at some length and then his assassination of Buckingham, carried out under her influence.

===Other works===
Felton is the central character in a play by the dramatist Edward Stirling. Called &quot;John Felton; or the Man of the People&quot;, it was first performed at the Royal Surrey Theatre in 1852.

The Duke&#x27;s assassination features in Philippa Gregory&#x27;s novel &quot;Earthly Joys&quot; (1998). In Ronald Blythe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Assassin&quot; (2004) Felton is depicted as a complex character whose motives for the assassination are altruistic.

The 2024 television miniseries &quot;Mary and George&quot; depicts the Duke&#x27;s assassination at the climax of the final episode; Felton is portrayed by Robert Lonsdale.
