<text>Zhou Tai () (died 223), courtesy name Youping, was a military general serving under the warlord Sun Quan during the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period of China. He previously served under Sun Ce, Sun Quan&#x27;s elder brother and predecessor.

==Service under Sun Ce==
Zhou Tai was from Xiacai County (), Jiujiang Commandery (), which is present-day Fengtai County, Anhui. 
Around the early 195, he and Jiang Qin came to serve Sun Ce, who was on a series of conquests in the Jiangdong region, where Zhou Tai helped Sun Ce to defeat Liu Yao and Wu Ju in this campaign. When Sun Ce occupied Kuaiji Commandery (present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang) after the commandery&#x27;s Administrator, Wang Lang, surrendered to him, he appointed Zhou Tai as a Major of Separate Command () and put him in command of some troops.

Sun Ce&#x27;s younger brother, Sun Quan, favoured Zhou Tai so he requested for Zhou to be transferred to his unit. Once, when Sun Ce was away on a campaign against some bandits who had emerged in the six counties of Kuaiji, Sun Quan was left in Xuancheng County (宣城縣; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui) with less than 1,000 men. Out of negligence, Sun Quan did not set up defence posts, so when thousands of bandits suddenly attacked Xuancheng, he attempted to flee. However, by then, Sun Quan had already been surrounded by the bandits, who attacked him and slashed at his saddle, causing much panic among his men. Only Zhou Tai, with his spirits roused, rushed to protect Sun Quan, emboldening those near him and making them able to fight again. When the bandits finally dispersed, Zhou Tai had sustained 12 deep wounds all over his body and he took a long time to recover.

In 199, Zhou Tai followed Sun Ce to attack Liu Xun at Wan County (皖縣; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui) and Huang Zu at Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; commandery capital in present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei). When he returned from the campaigns, he passed by Yuzhang Commandery () and was appointed as the Chief () of Yichun County (宜春縣; present-day Yichun, Jiangxi). The residents in the counties under his governorship provided him with the necessary funding and supplies for his troops.

==Service under Sun Quan==
Sun Ce was assassinated in 200 CE while he was out on a hunting expedition and was succeeded by Sun Quan. In 208, Zhou Tai participated in the Battle of Jiangxia against Huang Zu. Later that year, Zhou Tai fought at the Battle of Red Cliffs under the command of Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu, and the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei scored a major victory over Cao Cao&#x27;s forces. Zhou Tai was also involved in the Battle of Jiangling, a follow-up to Red Cliffs, and Sun Quan&#x27;s forces defeated Cao Cao&#x27;s general Cao Ren and captured Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei). After the battles, Zhou Tai was ordered to garrison at Cen County ().

In 217, Cao Cao launched another attack on Sun Quan, leading to the Battle of Ruxu. Zhou Tai participated in the defence of Ruxu, and Sun Quan&#x27;s forces succeeded in driving back the invaders. After Cao Cao&#x27;s retreat, Zhou Tai was appointed General Who Pacifies Barbarians () and was ordered to remain behind to guard Ruxu. At the time, Zhu Ran and Xu Sheng were also stationed at Ruxu and were Zhou Tai&#x27;s subordinates, but they were reluctant to submit to Zhou&#x27;s command. Sun Quan made a special trip to Ruxu and he threw a party for all the military officers there. Sun Quan personally served wine to Zhou Tai and asked him to undress. He pointed at every scar on Zhou Tai&#x27;s body and asked Zhou about it, whereupon Zhou would relate stories of the battles he fought in. At the end, Sun Quan told Zhou Tai to put on his clothes and they revelled through the night. The following day, Sun Quan instructed a herald to grant Zhou Tai his imperial parasol.

The &quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot; () further described this incident as follows:

Zhu Ran, Xu Sheng and the other officers were impressed with Zhou Tai and they submitted to his command.

In 219, Sun Quan sent his general Lü Meng to invade and seize Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province, which were defended by Guan Yu. After the success of the invasion, Sun Quan planned to attack Liu Bei in Shu (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) so he appointed Zhou Tai as the Administrator () of Hanzhong Commandery even though Hanzhong was still under Liu Bei&#x27;s control then. He also appointed Zhou Tai as General of Vehement Might () and awarded him the title &quot;Marquis of Lingyang&quot; ().

==Death==
Zhou Tai died sometime during the Huangwu era (222–229) in Sun Quan&#x27;s reign. His year of death was not specified, but the Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny estimated it to be around 223.

==Descendant==
Zhou Tai&#x27;s son, Zhou Shao (), was appointed as a Cavalry Commandant () and commanded some troops. He fought in the Battle of Ruxu of 222–223 against the Wei general Cao Ren and made contributions in battle. Later in 228, he participated in the Battle of Shiting under Lu Xun&#x27;s command, which saw a victory for Wu forces over the Wei army led by Cao Xiu. Zhou Shao was promoted to Major-General () for his achievement. He died in 230 and was succeeded by his younger brother, Zhou Cheng (), who inherited his military appointment and their father&#x27;s marquis title.

==Appraisal==
Zhou Tai was noted to be faithful and polite.

Zhou Tai&#x27;s bravery saving Sun Quan during the bandits&#x27; attack on Xuancheng was greatly appreciated by Sun Ce, who appointed him as the Chief () of Chungu County (春穀縣; northwest of present-day Fanchang County, Anhui). This made Sun Quan remind his generals about Zhou Tai&#x27;s personal deeds saving Sun Quan&#x27;s life.

Zhou Tai was praised by Chen Shou as one of the &quot;twelve tiger minister of Jiangdong&quot; (江東十二虎臣). The appraisal of courage and strength of Zhou Tai was also given by Lu Ji.

==In popular culture==
Zhou Tai appears as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series.

<doc id="306783" wikidata="Q4055394" url="?curid=306783" title="2003 London blackout">
<text>The 2003 London blackout was a serious power outage that affected parts of south London and north-west Kent in the evening of 28 August 2003. It was caused by a series of faults at National Grid transmission substations, which supplied the distribution network operator in the area, EDF Energy (now UK Power Networks).

It was the largest blackout in South East England since the Great Storm of 1987, affecting 476,000 customers. Power was lost at 18:20 BST and restored to EDF Energy 37 minutes later at 18:57, although it reportedly took longer for all customers to be reconnected.

A week later, on 5 September, a similar incident affected a substantial part of Birmingham.

==Impact==

A total of 476,000 customers supplied from National Grid&#x27;s New Cross, Hurst, and Wimbledon substations lost power, with a total of 724 MW lost — approximately 20% of London&#x27;s electricity demand at the time. The London Fire Brigade took around 400 calls and made hundreds of rescues for people stuck in lifts. 1800 main-line rail trains and sixty percent of the London Underground was affected, with passengers stuck in trains underground and power lost in signalling centres. 270 sets of traffic lights failed.

==Sequence of events==

* 18:11 - A Buchholz alarm alerts the National Grid control centre that gas is present in the oil in a transformer at Hurst substation. This is a significant safety concern which requires prompt action.
* 18:20 - The affected transformer is switched out of service by opening two circuit breakers. As Hurst is a &quot;mesh substation&quot;, this also disconnects the circuit supplying Hurst from Littlebrook substation. New Cross and Hurst substations are now supplied by a single 275 kV circuit from Wimbledon substation.
* 18:20 - An automatic protection relay at Wimbledon disconnects the remaining circuit, completely isolating New Cross and Hurst substations, as well as part of Wimbledon substation, and causing the blackout.
* 18:25 - Power is restored to the isolated transformers at Wimbledon substation, and the network is secured against further faults. The re-energised transformers are not yet made available to EDF Energy to supply customers.
* 18:40 - Power is restored to EDF from Hurst substation - approximately one third of the total number of affected customers.
* 18:48 - Power is restored to EDF from Wimbledon substation.
* 18:57 - Power is restored to EDF from New Cross substation. The transmission system is now operating normally, although it is reported that it takes longer for EDF to restore power to all customers.

==Reaction==
After the event, energy minister Stephen Timms and Mayor of London Ken Livingstone called for a prompt report. &quot;The Independent&quot; published an editorial comparing the event to the Northeast blackout of 2003, which had happened two weeks previously in the USA and Canada, and accusing National Grid of under-investment. London Underground was accused by unions of putting passengers at risk, having closed its own power station at Lots Road as part of the privatisation of its electricity supply.

A report was published by National Grid on 10 September, while the regulator Ofgem published an interim report on 30 September, and a full report in June 2004.

==Causes==
Several factors contributed to this outage. The direct cause of the blackout was an incorrectly installed protection relay at Wimbledon substation, which protected the circuit to New Cross. In 2001 a 1 ampere relay was accidentally installed instead of a 5 A model, resulting in the relay tripping at a current level five times lower than the correct rating. When the transformer at Hurst was isolated, the current in the circuit increased to 1,460 A — significantly below the 4,450 A operating capacity of the underground cable, but sufficient to cause the incorrectly-sized protection relay to trip.

The Buchholz alarm which triggered the incident was found to be due to low oil levels in the shunt reactor &quot;SR3&quot; at Hurst, which was not in service at the time of the incident. However, the alarm message received at the National Grid control desk was ambiguous, and the operators interpreted it as referring to the transformer &quot;SGT3&quot;, which was in use at the time.

After the incident, an anonymous engineer highlighted the oil leak to the press, indicating that it was spotted some weeks before the blackout, and accusing National Grid of poor maintenance. The Ofgem report found that National Grid had been aware of the leak since March 2003, and had decided to manage it by periodically refilling the oil until scheduled maintenance.

<doc id="306795" wikidata="Q8008040" url="?curid=306795" title="William Duckworth (composer)">
<text>William Duckworth (January 13, 1943 – September 13, 2012) was an American composer, author, educator, and Internet pioneer. He wrote more than 200 pieces of music and is credited with the composition of the first postminimal piece of music, &quot;The Time Curve Preludes&quot; (1977–78), for piano. Duckworth was a Professor of Music at Bucknell University. Together with Nora Farrell, his wife, he ran Monroe Street Music, the publisher of many Duckworth&#x27;s pieces.

==Biography==
Duckworth was born in North Carolina in 1943. He obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music from East Carolina University, then master&#x27;s and doctorates in music education from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He studied composition under composer Ben Johnston and wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the notation of composer John Cage. Duckworth received a 2002 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award, as well as a fellowship from the National Endowment of the Arts in 1977. Duckworth collaborated with his future wife, Nora Farrell, on his internet projects before marrying her. Over the years Duckworth enjoyed a close collaboration with James Jordan who frequently performs Duckworth&#x27;s music with his world-renowned choral ensembles. Duckworth died at his home in West New York, New Jersey, after a long fight with pancreatic cancer.

==Work as a composer==
Duckworth wrote more than 200 pieces of music. His best-known compositions include &quot;The Time Curve Preludes&quot;, 24 short pieces for piano, and &quot;Southern Harmony&quot;, which consists of 20 pieces for an eight-part chorus and employs features of shape note singing and minimalism. Other works include &quot;Mysterious Numbers&quot;, written for chamber orchestra, &quot;Imaginary Dances&quot;, for solo piano, and &quot;Simple Songs about Sex and War&quot;, written in collaboration with poet Hayden Carruth. &quot;The Time Curve Preludes&quot; were recorded by Bruce Brubaker in 2009, and by R. Andrew Lee in 2011. In the last months of his life, Duckworth completed a piano concerto for Brubaker.

==Career in education==
Duckworth was professor and former chairman of the Department of Music at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Penn. A 1992 profile in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine described him as a &quot;hip, bright, innovative teacher.&quot; Duckworth instructed Martin Rubeo, founder of the alternative rock band Gramsci Melodic, when the latter was a student at Bucknell University.

==Internet activities==
Much of Duckworth&#x27;s late music was composed and performed as part of &#x27;Cathedral&#x27;. Conceived in 1996 and launched on June 10, 1997, &quot;Cathedral&quot; is a work in music and art which depicts five &quot;mystical moments in time&quot;: The building of the Great Pyramid in Giza, the building of Chartres Cathedral, the 19th century Native American Ghost Dance movement, the detonation of the atomic bomb, and the creation of the World Wide Web.

More recently, &quot;Cathedral&quot; has served as the site for the distribution of &quot;The iPod Opera 2.0: The Myth of Orpheus, the Chronicler and Eurydice&quot;, podcast in 26 episodes as MP3 and QuickTime video files. The video episodes may be downloaded and played on many different kinds of computer systems, including Apple OS, Windows and Linux computers, while the MP3 files may be downloaded and burned as an audio disk. The completion of the podcast in February 2007 was timed to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the first performance of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;.

&quot;Cathedral&quot; features an instrument called the PitchWeb, which allows anyone with a computer to play along with the Cathedral Band when the band is performing live over the Internet. Duckworth plays the PitchWeb on a laptop computer when the band performs live.

&quot;Cathedral&quot; was conceived during a conversation Duckworth had with his wife, Nora Farrell, a software designer who specializes in music and publishing web applications. Farrell collaborated with Duckworth on &quot;Cathedral&quot; and elements of it such as &quot;The iPod Opera 2.0.&quot; As a member of the Cathedral Band, she edits the PitchWeb contributions by outside musicians.

A chapter in Duckworth&#x27;s 2005 book, &quot;Virtual Music: How the Web Got Wired for Sound&quot;, discusses the &quot;Cathedral&quot; site.

<text>Interstate 278 (I-278) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in New Jersey and New York in the United States. The road runs from US Route 1/9 (US 1/9) in Linden, New Jersey, northeast to the Bruckner Interchange in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The majority of I-278 is in New York City, where it serves as a partial beltway and passes through all five of the city&#x27;s boroughs. I-278 follows several freeways, including the Union Freeway in Union County, New Jersey; the Staten Island Expressway (SIE) across Staten Island; the Gowanus Expressway in southern Brooklyn; the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway (BQE) across Northern Brooklyn and Queens; a small part of the Grand Central Parkway in Queens; and a part of the Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx. I-278 also crosses multiple bridges, including the Goethals, Verrazzano-Narrows, Kosciuszko, and Robert F. Kennedy bridges.

I-278 was opened in pieces from the 1930s through the 1960s. Some of its completed segments predated the Interstate Highway System and are thus not up to standards, and portions of I-278 have been upgraded over the years. In New York, the various parts of I-278 were planned by Robert Moses, an urban planner in New York City. The segments proposed tore through many New York City neighborhoods, causing controversy. Despite its number, I-278 does not connect to I-78. There were once plans to extend I-278 west to I-78 east of the Route 24 interchange in Springfield, New Jersey. This was canceled because of opposition from the communities along the route. The segment that does exist in New Jersey was opened in 1969. There were also plans to extend I-78 east across Manhattan and into Brooklyn via the Williamsburg Bridge; this would have been a second interchange between I-278 and its parent highway, but these plans were also thwarted. I-78 was also planned to extend east beyond I-278 to John F. Kennedy International Airport, and then curve northward on the Clearview Expressway, ending at the Bruckner Interchange in the Bronx. If these plans were fully completed, I-78 and I-278 would have met at three interchanges.

Two segments of I-278 have had different route number designations formerly planned or designated for it. I-87 was once planned to follow the segment of I-278 between the Williamsburg Bridge and the Major Deegan Expressway, but this ultimately became a part of I-278. Additionally, the Bruckner Expressway portion of I-278 had been designated with different route numbers. At first, it was to be I-895 between I-87 and the Sheridan Expressway and I-678 past there. Later, I-278 was planned to follow the Bruckner Expressway and the Sheridan Expressway to I-95 (with no route number for the Bruckner Expressway past there) before the current numbering took place by 1970, with I-895 designated onto the Sheridan Expressway (which was subsequently downgraded to a state highway in 2017).

===New Jersey===

The New Jersey segment of I-278 begins in Linden, Union County, at the junction with US 1 and US 9 (US 1/9), where it merges into the southbound direction of that road. The freeway heads east and carries two lanes in each direction, with the eastbound direction widening to three lanes. I-278 runs between urban residential areas to the north and the Bayway Refinery to the south as it continues into Elizabeth. In this area, the road meets Route 439 and the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) at the only intermediate interchange that I-278 has in New Jersey. This short length is sometimes called the Union Freeway. After this interchange, I-278 turns southeast and crosses the New Jersey Turnpike, Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; (CSAO) Chemical Coast Secondary line, a Staten Island Railway freight line that is used by CSAO, industrial areas, CSAO&#x27;s Bayway Industrial Track line, and finally Arthur Kill on the six-lane Goethals Bridge into Staten Island, a borough of New York City. This bridge is maintained by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ).

===Staten Island Expressway===

Upon coming onto Staten Island, I-278 becomes the SIE. After the Goethals Bridge, the highway passes under the Travis Branch railroad line that is owned by the Staten Island Railway and operated by CSAO and has a toll gantry serving the bridge. At this point, the freeway becomes eight lanes and maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), coming to an exit for Western and Forest avenues before reaching a directional interchange with the West Shore Expressway (New York State Route 440 (NY 440). NY 440 forms a concurrency with I-278, and the road heads into residential neighborhoods. The road carries four lanes eastbound and three lanes westbound as it comes to the exit serving Richmond Avenue. Immediately after, NY 440 splits from the SIE at a large interchange, heading north on the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway. This interchange also provides access to Victory Boulevard. East of this point, the expressway gains a bus lane in each direction. The six-lane I-278 turns to the east past this point, with Gannon Avenue South and Gannon Avenue North serving as frontage roads, and reaches the Bradley Avenue exit.

The next interchange the SIE is with Todt Hill Road and Slosson Avenue. This exchange was the original terminal of the bus lane in each direction that also serves as a high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV lane) that was built in 2005. After Todt Hill Road and Slosson Avenue, I-278 runs through a wooded area where it comes to an incomplete interchange that was to be the northern terminus of the Richmond Parkway. The road continues back into residential areas and comes to an interchange serving Clove Road and Richmond Road. Past this, I-278 passes over the Staten Island Railway rapid transit line. The next interchange the freeway has is with Hylan Boulevard. A short distance later, the SIE comes to a large interchange that serves Lily Pond Avenue and Bay Street. Immediately after, I-278 reaches the former toll plaza for the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, where electronic toll collection is in effect. I-278 goes onto the Verrazzano Bridge linking to Brooklyn over The Narrows. This bridge, which is maintained by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA), has six lanes on the lower level and seven lanes on the upper level which includes one HOV lane. In addition to local traffic on Staten Island, the expressway provides the most direct route from Brooklyn and Long Island to New Jersey. It is widely known throughout the New York City area as one of the most congested roads in the city.
===Gowanus Expressway===
After the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, I-278 continues into Brooklyn on the Gowanus Expressway. Immediately after the bridge, the freeway comes to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for the Belt Parkway. After this, a full interchange serves 92nd Street at which point I-278 becomes a single-level six-lane freeway. Soon after, one of the eastbound lanes becomes an HOV lane, continuing east to the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. restricted to buses, carpools, and vehicles with three or more occupants. On weekdays, this HOV lane carries eastbound traffic in the morning and westbound traffic in the afternoon. The lane is closed at other times, including certain New York City government holidays.

The Gowanus Expressway continues northeast into urban residential neighborhoods and reaches an eastbound interchange at Fort Hamilton Parkway and a westbound interchange at 86th Street. Turning more to the north, I-278 comes to a partial interchange at 65th Street, with an exit eastbound and entrance eastbound. The road curves northwest at this point and comes to a directional interchange providing access to 3rd Avenue and the Belt Parkway. The Gowanus Expressway turns northeast again at the interchange with Belt Parkway, and it continues along an elevated alignment above Third Avenue, running through urban residential and commercial areas. Along this viaduct, I-278 has interchanges with 38th Street/39th Street and the Prospect Expressway (NY 27).

After the interchange with the Prospect Expressway (NY 27), the freeway widens to eight lanes and heads north, coming to an interchange with the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel approach (officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel, I-478), with the exit ramps splitting from the median of I-278. Westbound access to the tunnel is provided by the Hamilton Avenue exit. In this area, the freeway passes over the Gowanus Canal, an extremely polluted canal that was once used for shipping. The site has been designated a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency.

===Brooklyn–Queens Expressway===

After the exit for the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, I-278 heads north onto the six-lane BQE, passing through urban neighborhoods near Downtown Brooklyn on a depressed alignment. The next interchange the highway reaches serves Atlantic Avenue. After Atlantic Avenue, the road runs along the East River harbor in Downtown Brooklyn/Brooklyn Heights and is partially covered to create the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. , the roadway has been reduced to two lanes in each direction between Atlantic Avenue and the Brooklyn Bridge as part of efforts to extend the life of the roadway and meet modern safety standards for lane width and shoulders.I-278, at this point maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation, makes a sharp turn to the east away from the East River and comes to an interchange serving the Brooklyn Bridge and Cadman Plaza. The freeway continues on an elevated alignment and makes a turn southeast as it comes to ramps accessing the Manhattan Bridge. As of 2022, the city portion is planned to be rebuilt.
North of the bridges, the highway becomes state-maintained again and reaches at an exit serving Tillary Street and Flushing Avenue. At this point, the BQE continues east through residential areas and turns northeast upon coming to the Wythe Avenue/Kent Avenue exit. The road passes through the Williamsburg neighborhood on a depressed alignment, reaching an interchange that serves the Williamsburg Bridge, with an exit at Metropolitan Avenue a short distance later. I-278 becomes elevated again as it passes through more neighborhoods and comes to the interchange with Humboldt Street/McGuinness Boulevard. The BQE enters more industrial areas as it comes to the Meeker Avenue/Morgan Avenue exit.

I-278 crosses the Newtown Creek into Queens on the Kosciuszko Bridge. Upon entering Queens, the BQE runs north between residential neighborhoods to the east and Calvary Cemetery to the west before coming to an interchange with the LIE (I-495). After I-495, the freeway makes a turn to the east, passing over a residential street before crossing over New Calvary Cemetery. The road turns northeast through more urban neighborhoods and reaches an interchange at Queens Boulevard (NY 25). At this point, I-278 becomes city-maintained again and passes under the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Main Line as it continues into a depressed alignment. The BQE turns north as it approaches the exit for Broadway and Roosevelt Avenue. I-278 heads back onto a viaduct and comes to a single-point urban interchange at Northern Boulevard (NY 25A). A short distance past Northern Boulevard (NY 25A), the freeway splits into east and west segments with four lanes each that respectively merge into the Grand Central Parkway east- and westbound. Astoria Boulevard is accessible from either leg. Both legs receive Interstate funding, though only the western leg is signed as part of I-278.

===Grand Central Parkway and Robert F. Kennedy Bridge===
I-278 turns west to run along the eight-lane state-maintained Grand Central Parkway, with Astoria Boulevard (and Hoyt Avenue later on) serving as a frontage road. The road runs along a depressed alignment, passing under Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor, then the New York City Subway&#x27;s BMT Astoria Line at 31st Street. The Grand Central Parkway overlap ends at the interchange with 31st Street, and I-278 continues northwest along the tolled, eight-lane Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, which passes over Astoria. Eastbound tolls are collected electronically at this point.
I-278 crosses the East River on the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, which maintained by the TBTA. It then enters Wards Island, which is a part of the borough of Manhattan. On Wards Island, the highway heads north through Wards Island Park and passes to the east of Manhattan Psychiatric Center as it passes over the border onto Randalls Island, which is connected to Wards Island by land. I-278 passes through the bridge&#x27;s former toll plaza before an interchange that provides access to FDR Drive by way of another segment of the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge over the Harlem River. After this interchange, the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge carries the route over the Bronx Kill into the Bronx, where westbound tolls are collected electronically.

===Bruckner Expressway===
In the Bronx, I-278 becomes the Bruckner Expressway and reaches an interchange with the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87). At this point, the Bruckner Expressway heads northeast on a six-lane elevated alignment through industrial areas with some residences, paralleling the Northeast Corridor. Along this section, there is a westbound exit and eastbound entrance for East 138th Street. Sheridan Boulevard (NY 895) splits from the eastbound direction of I-278 as the Bruckner Expressway makes a turn to the east into residential and commercial neighborhoods on a surface alignment, crossing the Bronx River on a drawbridge. The road has an interchange at Hunts Point Avenue before coming to the Bronx River Parkway. Continuing east, the road has an exit serving White Plains Road and Castle Hill Avenue.

I-278&#x27;s eastern terminus is at the Bruckner Interchange further to the east. Here, the Bruckner Expressway becomes I-95 and continues towards the New England Thruway. At this interchange, I-278 also has access to the Clearview Expressway (I-295), the Hutchinson River Expressway (I-678), and the Hutchinson River Parkway itself. Legally, the New York section of I-278 is defined as part of Interstate Route Connector 512 and all of Interstate Route Connector 518 in New York Highway Law § 340-a.

==History==

===New Jersey===

The New Jersey portion of freeway was planned in 1955 as the Union Freeway and designated as I-278 in 1958. It was to connect the Goethals Bridge west to I-78 at the tripoint of Springfield, Union Township, and Millburn. The western part of this planned freeway faced strong opposition. Even though it was to run along an abandoned railroad right-of-way, it would traverse through dense development in Roselle Park, Kenilworth, and Union Township, thereby making the project further disliked. By 1967, state officials decided not to pursue the continuation of I-278 and used the funds for I-278 to build I-195 across Central Jersey instead. The only section of I-278 in New Jersey was built between US 1/9 in Linden and the Goethals Bridge, opening to traffic in 1969 at a cost of $11.5 million (equivalent to $ in ).
The Union Freeway Extension was revived in the late 1960s and was to start at US 1/9 but end at I-287 in Hanover Township, following Route 24 between I-78 and I-287. However, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) rejected the proposal in 1970, thus ending the I-278 project.

The original four-lane Goethals Bridge, which predated the I-278 designation, was replaced with two new three-lane cable-stayed bridges, each carrying traffic in one direction. The new eastbound bridge opened to both directions of traffic in June 2017, and westbound traffic was shifted to the new westbound bridge in May 2018.

===Staten Island Expressway===
The SIE was first planned in 1941 as the Cross-Richmond Express Highway, a freeway connecting the Goethals and Verrazzano-Narrows bridges that was a part of a comprehensive system of freeways and parkways for the borough of Staten Island. In 1945, Robert Moses took over planning for the freeway and called it the Clove Lakes Expressway. The plan received approval in stages through the mid-1950s, and construction on the expressway began in 1959. By this time, the SIE had received the I-278 designation.
The construction of the SIE was particularly noted for the massive movement of earth required to build the section of the highway between Clove Road and Price Street (now Narrows Road North, a service road of the expressway) between Grymes Hill and Emerson Hill. The earth removed from the cut in the hill was placed in a remote section of central Staten Island adjacent to Sea View Hospital and has since been nicknamed &quot;Moses Mountain&quot;. Originally, Moses intended for a spur of the expressway, the Richmond Parkway, to follow the central ridge of the island, connecting with the Outerbridge Crossing in the southwestern part of the island. However, there was massive local opposition to this spur, and, unlike previous projects by Moses, the northern half of the spur was canceled when Mayor John Lindsay took office in 1966. The southern half of this proposed spur was built, however. The aborted section, from the expressway to Richmond Avenue, has become a part of the Staten Island Greenbelt, one of New York City&#x27;s public parks. A ramp stub of an interchange on the expressway, cut into the hills of Todt Hill, still exists. Part of the trail system of the greenbelt was using the abandoned overpass bridge as pedestrian crossing of the expressway up until 2013, when it was dismantled for lane widening improvements.

The first link of the SIE opened in January 1964, from the Goethals Bridge to Victory Boulevard. The remainder opened later that year. The freeway had a total cost of $47 million (equivalent to $ in ). In 1998, bus lanes were created on the eastern part of the SIE near the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge; they were extended west to Todt Hill Road/Slosson Avenue in 2005. In 2008, the bus lanes were opened to high-occupancy vehicles during rush hours.

In July 2008, officials announced a $50-million (equivalent to $ in ) project to improve the severe traffic conditions on a stretch of the expressway. Included in the project is the construction of six new on- and offramps, improvements to and relocations of existing on- and offramps, and other improvements to surrounding roads. This followed numerous minor alterations to alleviate traffic, such as time/distance displays and the designated bus lanes. Construction started in November 2010, with the project then expected to cost $75 million (equivalent to $ in ). A new exit 15, which served Lily Pond Avenue and Bay Street on the eastern end of Staten Island, opened to traffic on July 9, 2012, replacing a former exit further to the east. Signage was also changed to display Fingerboard Road and Lily Pond Avenue as the outlet for the new exit, rather than Lily Pond Avenue and Bay Street. On January 17, 2013, westbound exit 13 was permanently closed in favor of a new interchange setup, which involved two new ramps: exit 13B for Richmond Road and Targee Street and exit 13A for Clove Road.

===Gowanus Expressway===

The Gowanus Expressway was initially the Gowanus Parkway, first planned in the 1930s. Construction of the road, overseen by Robert Moses, started in 1939, with the parkway being built on top of the BMT Third Avenue Line. The parkway was completed in 1941 and became part of the Belt Parkway that received the NY 27A designation. The Gowanus Parkway was to be reconstructed into the Gowanus Expressway in the 1950s to connect the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. The first segment of the Gowanus Expressway, from the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel to the Prospect Expressway (NY 27), was opened in May 1950. The freeway was initially planned to be twelve lanes, with two three-lane roadways in each direction, but it was ultimately reduced to a six-lane highway to reduce disruption to the Bay Ridge neighborhood. The Gowanus Expressway was incorporated into the Interstate Highway System and became a component of I-278. The conversion of Gowanus Expressway to a six-lane freeway configuration was completed in 1964 at a cost of $100 million (equivalent to $ in ). The NY 27A designation was removed from the Gowanus Expressway by 1970.

By 2000, an HOV lane was added to the eastbound Gowanus Expressway to serve traffic heading toward Manhattan. Over the years, the viaduct structure of the Gowanus Expressway has deteriorated. In 1998, a $16-million (equivalent to $ in ) feasibility study for a tunnel for the Gowanus Expressway was awarded. NYSDOT was considering putting the road in a tunnel, but, in November 2011, the FHWA canceled the project. The viaduct&#x27;s vertical steel supports show material missing due to rust, but the federal government has stated that it is not in danger of collapse. In 2019, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) took over maintenance of the Gowanus Expressway from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).

===Brooklyn–Queens Expressway and Grand Central Parkway===

The BQE was initially planned in 1936 as the Brooklyn–Queens Connecting Highway, a link between the Gowanus Parkway and the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge. The brief portion of I-278 on the Grand Central Parkway, connecting the BQE and the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, had opened in the 1930s. A part of the Brooklyn–Queens Connecting Highway, namely the Kosciuszko Bridge and the viaducts leading to the bridge, opened in 1939 between Meeker Avenue/Morgan Avenue and Queens Boulevard (NY 25).

In 1940, Moses proposed an expressway between Queens and Brooklyn to relieve local streets of congestion from the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges. The section between the Kosciuszko and Williamsburg bridges opened on May 25, 1950. A further extension between the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel and the Brooklyn Bridge, which included the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, was opened on June 23, 1954, connecting to the Gowanus Expressway. This was followed by a mile-long () section between the Williamsburg Bridge and Flushing Avenue on September 1, 1958. Two sections of the expressway opened on August 26, 1959: a segment between the Brooklyn Bridge and Tillary Street in Brooklyn and between the Grand Central Parkway and Roosevelt Avenue in Queens. The expressway between Tillary Street and Flushing Avenue, around the Brooklyn Navy Yard, was opened shortly thereafter on January 6, 1960. The road in its entirety was completed on December 23, 1964 at a cost of $137 million (equivalent to $ in ), with the opening of a mile-long () underpass connecting Queens Boulevard with Roosevelt Avenue. The major interchange with the Long Island Expressway was rebuilt in 1966 for $32.7 million (equivalent to $ in ).
The construction of the BQE, overseen by Moses, tore through many residential neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens instead of following the East River. One portion of the expressway, the two-tiered promenade section in Brooklyn Heights that was designed by Moses, was originally planned to go straight through Hicks Street, then connect to the Brooklyn Bridge at Adams Street. Another route that was proposed by Moses would have continued up Hicks Street past Atlantic Avenue, removing all the buildings on one side of Court Street, then curving east into Tillary Street (at Cadman Plaza). The Brooklyn Heights Association was able to fight these proposed routes, which created the two-tiered section above Furman Street with the promenade over it. Several tunnels were later proposed to replace the promenade, but none of the tunnel proposals were supported or funded.

In 1958, existing segments of the expressway were eligible for Interstate Highway funding. For a short time, the segment of highway between the Robert F. Kennedy and Williamsburg bridges was to be designated I-87 and continue north as the Major Deegan Expressway. By 1959, the I-278 designation was given to the entire length of the highway. Since the roadway was constructed prior to modern expressway standards, the road needed to be upgraded to meet these standards. By the 1990s, a major multiyear project beginning in the 1980s brought upgrades to the BQE.
In the early 2000s, the expressway underwent another upgrade project that replaced the viaduct within Downtown Brooklyn and Fort Greene. Simultaneously, the Queens section of the BQE between Queens Boulevard and 25th Avenue was also renovated. The Koscisuzko Bridge was replaced from 2014 to 2017 with a new eastbound span that temporarily served both directions of traffic. A second span of the Kosciuszko Bridge opened in 2019 for westbound traffic, adding more lanes to the BQE across the bridge.

Formerly, the frontage road of the Grand Central Parkway between the BQE and the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge served as a truck route, since large trucks are not permitted on the parkway. Exemptions are provided for smaller trucks that conform with strict regulations, but only on the section of the Grand Central Parkway that overlaps with I-278. In December 2017, the state concluded a $2.5-million (equivalent to $ in ) project that lowered the roadbed of the section of the parkway that is concurrent with I-278. This section of I-278 now has a vertical clearance, which allows most trucks to stay on I-278. In late 2024, the NYCDOT began considering a plan to construct freeway caps above parts of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, as well as converting the spaces under the expressway into public plazas.

====Proposed reconstruction in Brooklyn Heights====

In 1999, the think tank Reason Foundation proposed placing the BQE within Brooklyn Heights in a tunnel. However, NYCDOT did not seriously consider this suggestion until 2016 when it studied six possible tunnel configurations. NYCDOT found that only the tunnel option starting at 21st Street on Third Avenue and ending near Kent Avenue in Williamsburg would be feasible. This option would have served as a bypass, with vehicles heading to Downtown Brooklyn, or the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges using the triple cantilever structure, which would be tolled. At the same time, the Brooklyn Heights Promenade was deteriorating significantly and was set to undergo renovations starting 2020. The structure is supported by steel rods inside rebar, which is corroding due to the seeping of road salt into widening cracks. If nothing was done on the roadway by 2026, weight restrictions would have to be implemented, with trucks diverted to local roads, and, by 2036, the city would have to shut down this section of the BQE.

In late 2018, NYSDOT proposed rebuilding the double-decker, section of I-278 running under the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, which had deteriorated severely over the years. Two options were proposed. The cheaper option, which would cost $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion (equivalent to $ to $ in ) and take six years, entailed building a temporary six-lane highway in the location of the promenade while they repaired the underlying structure. Under this option, lanes would be widened, and shoulders would have been added. In conjunction with the project, NYCDOT hoped to unify Van Voorhees Park, improve safety at the interchange with Atlantic Avenue, and possibly build a pedestrian bridge from Brooklyn Bridge Park to the promenade. The other, more expensive option, which would cost $3.4 billion to $4 billion (equivalent to $ to $ in ) and take over eight years, was to repair the existing six-lane highway one lane at a time. The promenade walkway would be closed for up to six years under the first option and for two years under the second option, with periodic closures for construction use. The NYCDOT commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, called the project &quot;the most challenging project not only in New York City, but arguably in the United States right now&quot;. For the project, $1.7 billion in city funding was allocated, with the remainder to be footed from the state and federal governments.
Because of sizable opposition to demolishing the promenade, mayor Bill de Blasio later stated that his administration was open to considering other ideas, including routing the expressway over Brooklyn Bridge Park. Hundreds of people, including Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams and City Comptroller Scott Stringer, rallied on the promenade, calling for more public review. Local residents are strongly opposed to the construction of the temporary six-lane highway as it would run right up against their homes. In response, the Brooklyn Heights Association came up with an alternate plan, which called for the construction of a temporary bilevel roadway running besides the promenade on land including a parking lot.

Support for reducing the size of or tearing down the BQE increased, with articles in &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; calling for the removal of the highway. They noted how the removal of highways in other cities improved local neighborhoods and led to economic development. Commissioner Trottenberg had dismissed calls to tear down the highway saying that the city got most of its freight by truck and that &quot;For better or for worse, these Moses-built highways [...] now the city has grown around them and it&#x27;s not an option to just say we can&#x27;t deal with that traffic.&quot; City Council Speaker Corey Johnson called for the city to study alternatives, including the removal of the BQE in its entirety, in his State of the City address. On March 13, 2019, Stringer issued a plan calling for converting the triple cantilever structure and the open cut in Cobble Hill into a truck-only highway between Hamilton Avenue in Carroll Gardens and the Brooklyn Bridge. Under the plan, only the bottom level would be rebuilt and then be decked over by a linear park and boulevard. The report expected passenger vehicles to be diverted into the underused Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, whose tolls might be lowered when congestion pricing in New York City was implemented. In early April, de Blasio announced that he would create a panel to formally evaluate each alternative and that the panel&#x27;s evaluations would end by mid-2019. In February 2020, officials proposed a tunnel from the Gowanus Expressway to Flushing Avenue. The proposal was expected to cost $11 billion, to be paid by tolls.

In late 2021, the section between Atlantic Avenue and the Brooklyn Bridge was reduced from three to two lanes per direction, a move that city officials said could prolong the viaduct&#x27;s life by 20 years. The city also planned to ticket overweight vehicles. There was still no long-term plan for the viaduct by mid-2022, but three preliminary plans for the highway&#x27;s reconstruction were announced in December 2022. NYCDOT formally presented the three plans to the public in February 2023, and city officials began issuing summonses to overweight vehicles in August of that year. In February 2024, the Federal Highway Administration rejected the city&#x27;s request for $800 million to redesign and rebuild the cantilever. By the next month, no design had been finalized, and the start date for the triple cantilever&#x27;s reconstruction had been postponed to 2028.

===Bruckner Expressway===
The Bruckner Expressway was originally Bruckner Boulevard, designated as part of NY 1A. In the 1930s, a freeway was planned on the Bruckner Boulevard alignment in order to provide a connection between the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge and a freeway leading north into Westchester County. Moses took over planning for the road in 1951 and called for an elevated freeway between the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge and the Bronx River and a depressed freeway east of there. Construction on the elevated segment of the Bruckner Expressway began in 1957 and on the depressed segment in 1959. The depressed portion was opened in 1961 while the elevated portion of the Bruckner Expressway was opened in 1962. In 1972, the large Bruckner Interchange was finished, completing the route.

Over the years, the I-278 portion of the Bruckner Expressway has had different designations. When the Interstate Highway System was first created, the road was to be part of I-895 from I-87 to the Sheridan Expressway and I-678 from there to I-95. Later, I-278 was planned to follow the Bruckner Expressway from I-87 to the Sheridan Expressway, where it would continue on that freeway to I-95, while the Bruckner Expressway was not designated an Interstate north of there. By 1970, I-278 was routed onto its current alignment, with I-895 (now NY 895) created along the Sheridan Expressway.

==Public transportation==
Multiple express buses operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority operate along I-278:
* The Staten Island express routes operate on the Staten Island Expressway, Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and Gowanus Expressway.
* The Staten Island express routes operate over the Goethals Bridge.
* The Brooklyn express routes operate on the Gowanus Expressway.
* The Bronx express routes operate on the Bruckner Expressway.
The local routes operate over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. In addition, the local bus operates on the Kosciuszko Bridge; the operates over a small section of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway; and the operates on the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge.

<doc id="306799" wikidata="Q1678488" url="?curid=306799" title="TACACS">
<text>Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS, ) refers to a family of related protocols handling remote authentication and related services for network access control through a centralized server. The original TACACS protocol, which dates back to 1984, was used for communicating with an authentication server, common in older UNIX networks including but not limited to the ARPANET, MILNET and BBNNET. It spawned related protocols:
* Extended TACACS (XTACACS) is a proprietary extension to TACACS introduced by Cisco Systems in 1990 without backwards compatibility to the original protocol. TACACS and XTACACS both allow a remote access server to communicate with an authentication server in order to determine if the user has access to the network. 
* TACACS Plus (TACACS+) is a protocol developed by Cisco and released as an open standard beginning in 1993. Although derived from TACACS, TACACS+ is a separate protocol that handles authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. TACACS+ has largely replaced its predecessors.

==History==
TACACS was originally developed in 1984 by BBN, later known as BBN Technologies, for administration of ARPANET and MILNET, which ran unclassified network traffic for DARPA at the time and would later evolve into the U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s NIPRNet. Originally designed as a means to automate authentication – allowing someone who was already logged into one host in the network to connect to another on the same network without needing to re-authenticate – it was first formally described by BBN&#x27;s Brian Anderson TAC Access Control System Protocols, BBN Tech Memo CC-0045 with minor TELNET double login avoidance change in December 1984 in IETF RFC 927. Cisco Systems began supporting TACACS in its networking products in the late 1980s, eventually adding several extensions to the protocol. In 1990, Cisco&#x27;s extensions on top of TACACS became a proprietary protocol called Extended TACACS (XTACACS). Although TACACS and XTACACS are not open standards, Craig Finseth of the University of Minnesota, with Cisco&#x27;s assistance, published a description of the protocols in 1993 as IETF RFC 1492 for informational purposes.

==Technical descriptions==

===TACACS===
TACACS is defined in RFC 1492, and uses (either TCP or UDP) port 49 by default. TACACS allows a client to accept a username and password and send a query to a TACACS authentication server, sometimes called a TACACS daemon. It determines whether to accept or deny the authentication request and sends a response back. The TIP (routing node accepting dial-up line connections, which the user would normally want to log in into) would then allow access or not, based upon the response. In this way, the process of making the decision is &quot;opened up&quot; and the algorithms and data used to make the decision are under the complete control of whoever is running the TACACS daemon.

===XTACACS===
Extended TACACS (XTACACS) extends the TACACS protocol with additional functionality. It also separates the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) functions out into separate processes, allowing them to be handled by separate servers and technologies.

===TACACS+===
TACACS+ is a Cisco designed extension to TACACS that is described in RFC 8907. TACACS+ includes a mechanism that can be used to obfuscate the body of each packet, while leaving the header clear-text. Moreover, it provides granular control in the form of command-by-command authorization.

TACACS+ has generally replaced TACACS and XTACACS in more recently built or updated networks. TACACS+ is an entirely new protocol which is not compatible with its predecessors, TACACS and XTACACS.

=== Comparison with RADIUS ===

There are a number of differences between the two protocols which make them substantially different in normal usage.

TACACS+ can only use TCP, while RADIUS normally operates over UDP, but can also use TCP (RFC6613), and for additional security, TLS (RFC 6614) and DTLS (RFC7360).

TACACS+ can operate in two modes. One mode is where all traffic including passwords are sent in clear-text, and the only security is IP address filtering. The other mode is data obfuscation (RFC 8907 Section 4.5), where the packet header is clear-text, but the body including passwords is obfuscated with an MD5-based method. The MD5-based obfuscation method is similar to that used for the RADIUS User-Password attribute (RFC 2865 Section 5.2), and therefore has similar security properties.

Another difference is that TACACS+ is used only for administrator access to networking equipment, while RADIUS is most often used for end-user authentication. TACACS+ supports &quot;command authorization&quot;, where an administrator can log in to a piece of networking equipment, and attempt to issue commands. The equipment will use TACACS+ to send each command to a TACACS+ server, which can choose to authorize, or reject the command.

Similar functionality exists in RADIUS in RFC 5607, but support for that standard appears to be poor or non-existent.

TACACS+ offers robust functionality for administrator authentication and command authorization, but is essentially never used for authenticating end-user access to networks. In contrast, RADIUS offers minimal functionality for administrator authentication and command authorization, while offering strong support (and is widely used) for end-user authentication, authorization, and accounting.

As such, the two protocols have little overlap in functionality or in common usage.

<doc id="306802" wikidata="Q3958553" url="?curid=306802" title="Seward Collins">
<text>Seward Bishop Collins (April 22, 1899 – December 8, 1952) was an American New York socialite and publisher. By the end of the 1920s, he was a self-described &quot;fascist&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Collins was born in Albion, New York, on April 22, 1899, to Irish Catholic parents. His father Herbert was involved early on in the development of United Cigar Stores, a chain that would eventually grow to over 3,000 locations. He graduated from The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and then from Princeton University.

==Career==
Collins entered New York&#x27;s literary life in 1926, as a bon vivant. He knew many literary giants of his day, had an affair with Dorothy Parker, and amassed a large collection of erotica. His bookstore, The American Review Bookshop, was at 231 West 58th Street in New York City. It carried many journals, broadsheets and newsletters that supported nationalist and fascist causes in Europe and Asia.

In 1936, he married Dorothea Brande. A man of independent wealth, Collins published two literary journals, &quot;The Bookman&quot; (1927–1933) and the far-right &quot;American Review&quot; (1933–1937).

Collins was infatuated with the writings of prominent humanists of his day, including Paul Elmer More and Irving Babbitt. Politically, he moved from left-liberalism in the early 1920s and eventually away from More&#x27;s and Babbitt&#x27;s Humanism to what he called &quot;fascism&quot; by the end of the decade. In &quot;The American Review&quot;, he sought to develop an American form of fascism and praised Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and German dictator Adolf Hitler in an article titled &quot;Monarch as Alternative,&quot; which appeared in the first issue in 1933. In that essay, Collins attacked both capitalism and communism and heralded the &quot;New Monarch,&quot; who would champion the common good over and against the machinations of capitalists and communists. His praise of Hitler was grounded in his belief that Hitler&#x27;s rise to power that year heralded the end of the communist threat, as is illustrated by this excerpt:

One would gather from the fantastic lack of proportion of our press—not to say its gullibility and sensationalism—that the most important aspect of the German revolution was the hardships suffered by Jews under the new regime. Even if the absurd atrocity stories were all true, the fact would be almost negligible beside an event that shouts aloud in spite of the journalistic silence: the victory of Hitler signifies the end of the Communist threat, &quot;forever&quot;. Wherever Communism grows strong enough to make a Communist revolution a danger, it will be crushed by a Fascist revolution.

In a 1936 interview that he granted to Grace Lumpkin in the pro-communist periodical &quot;FIGHT against War and Fascism&quot;, Collins stated: &quot;I am a fascist. I admire Hitler and Mussolini very much. They have done great things for their countries.&quot; When Lumpkin objected to Hitler&#x27;s persecution of the Jews, Collins replied: &quot;It is not persecution. The Jews make trouble. It is necessary to segregate them.&quot;

&quot;The American Review&quot; ran articles by many leading literary critics of the day, including the Southern Agrarians, who, though hardly fascists, accepted a Northern publisher for their anti-modern essays. Several of them came to regret (and renounce) their relationship with Collins, however, after his political views became better known. One of them, Allen Tate, wrote a rebuttal of fascism for the liberal &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Nevertheless, Tate remained in contact with Collins and continued to publish in &quot;The American Review&quot; until its demise, in 1937.

In addition to featuring essays by many critics of modernity, &quot;The American Review&quot; also became the a vehicle for spreading the ideas associated with English Distributism, the supporters of which included G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc.

Collins and his wife, a spiritual medium, were actively involved with psychic phenomena during the 1930s. Their circle of friends included W.H. Salter, Theodore Besterman and Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, all of whom were affiliated with the Society for Psychical Research in London.

Collins is remembered primarily as a fascist editor and publisher who detested both capitalism and communism and counted many pre-War writers as his friends or colleagues. His essay &quot;Monarch as Alternative,&quot; mentioned above, appears in &quot;Conservatism in America Since 1930&quot;, a collection of essays by conservative writers published by New York University Press in 2003.

A 2005 biography of Collins, &quot;And Then They Loved Him: Seward Collins &amp; the Chimera of an American Fascism&quot;, argues that he was never a real &quot;fascist.&quot; This book, which is based on Collins&#x27; actual papers and letters (as well as his FBI file), argues that Collins was in fact a Distributist, i.e., a follower of G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc, who inexplicably called Agrarianism &quot;fascism.&quot; Indeed, the book concludes that Collins then became a kind of scapegoat after 1941 when many other members of the American social and intellectual elites were eager to distract attention from their own flirtations with fascism in the 1920s and 1930s. Yet his praise of Hitler and Mussolini, noted above, testifies to his beliefs, at least during the 1930s.

<text>Iona University () is a private Roman Catholic university with a main campus in New Rochelle, New York. It was founded in 1940 by the Congregation of Christian Brothers and occupies a campus of in New Rochelle and a campus of in Bronxville, New York.

Iona University offers more than 60 undergraduate programs and 45 graduate programs in the School of Arts &amp; Science, LaPenta School of Business and the NewYork-Presbyterian Iona School of Health Sciences. It also offers graduate courses in Manhattan and has 14 study abroad programs. As of academic year 2018–2019, the institution enrolled approximately 4,000 undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds representing 35 states and 47 countries of origin.

==History==
In 1919, the administrators and board members of the Iona School—a grade school founded three years earlier by the Irish Christian Brothers—negotiated the purchase of an 18-acre parcel of land in New Rochelle&#x27;s Beechmont neighborhood for $85,000 from the land owner, retired Presbyterian minister Thomas Hall.

In 1940, the idea of the college&#x27;s founding community of Brothers was to start a small, affordable college for the sons of New York&#x27;s working class. At the time, the Christian Brothers taught in seven high schools in the Archdiocese of New York, including Iona Prep, All Hallows, Rice High School, and Power Memorial. They recognized that many of their graduates could not afford the cost of local universities, and so began to form Iona College.

In June 1940, members of the Iona School community, along with members of the school&#x27;s Mothers’ Club, gathered to dedicate a new science building on the school&#x27;s campus—the building that the Mothers’ Club has raised $100,000 to build. It was there that they learned that just one day prior, not only had permission been granted to form Iona College on the same campus as the Iona School, but that the college would be commandeering the new science building for its own. The building would be named Cornelia Hall after the first president of the new Iona College.

On September 19, 1940, Iona College opened its doors with nine Christian Brothers and six lay faculty greeting the first class. The Christian Brothers named the college after Iona, the island monastery of St. Columba [Irish: St. Colmcille; Scottish Gaelic: Calum Cille; Manx: Colum Keeilley] located on the west coast of Scotland. Columba founded the monastery in 563 AD. The Congregation of Christian Brothers was itself founded in 1802 by Edmund Ignatius Rice in Waterford, Ireland.

Previous to opening in New York, the brothers taught at Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. They had been brought in from St Bonaventure College in St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. They operated the Halifax institution until 1940 when they were given a tearful sendoff after a run-in with the new archbishop, John T McNally.

In fall 1941, Iona College began its academic year with 121 freshmen and sophomores, but America&#x27;s entry into World War II caused Iona&#x27;s small enrollment to decline by the year&#x27;s end. Only three members of the entering class went on to receive BA degrees in August 1944. When World War II concluded, returning veterans, helped by the GI Bill and attracted by Iona&#x27;s practical majors, soon stretched the college to capacity. In 1948, 71 men graduated; by 1950, the number was up to 300.

In June 1966, Iona College issued diplomas to its first graduate students—which included two clergymen who earned their master&#x27;s in pastoral counseling. By 1968, the college conferred its first MBA degrees. Three years later, the college, which was traditionally male, welcomed its first freshmen class that included women, officially making the college fully co-educational. Approximately 200 women, one-quarter of the freshmen class, registered that semester. Prior to this point, female students had been part of campus in graduate programs, summer classes, and cross-registration agreements with neighboring traditionally female institutions.

In 1989, Elizabeth Seton College of Yonkers, New York, a two-year junior college, merged with Iona College, becoming the Elizabeth Seton School of Associate Degree Studies within the college. The program existed until 1995, when Iona College reevaluated and reaffirmed its mission to be a four-year institution, and the Seton School of Associate Degree Studies was closed.

In 2011, Iona College admitted that it had reported inflated figures from 2002–2011 about &quot;acceptance rates, SAT scores, graduation rates, and alumni who give annually&quot; in a bid to influence college rankings. Afterward, an internal audit office was established to ensure data integrity.

On January 28, 2021, the presidents of Concordia College and Iona announced that the Concordia campus would be acquired by Iona College forming part of a new Bronxville campus. Iona and Concordia made a teach-through agreement allowing most Concordia students to finish their degrees at Iona.

On July 12, 2022, the current president of Iona, Seamus Carey, announced through a YouTube livestream that the school will be known as Iona University.

<doc id="306811" wikidata="Q843634" url="?curid=306811" title="Malum in se">
<text>&#x27; (plural &#x27;) is a Latin phrase meaning or . The phrase is used to refer to conduct assessed as sinful or inherently wrong by nature, independent of regulations governing the conduct. It is distinguished from , which refers to acts that are wrong only because they are prohibited by law.

For example, most human beings believe that murder, rape, and theft are wrong, regardless of whether a law governs such conduct or where the conduct occurs, and is thus recognizably . In contrast, crimes are criminal not because they are inherently bad, but because the act is prohibited by the law of the state. For example, most United States jurisdictions require drivers to drive on the right side of the road. This is not because driving on the left side of a road is considered immoral, but because consistent rules promote safety and order on the roads.

The question between inherently wrong versus prohibited most likely originated in Plato&#x27;s Socratic dialogue, Euthyphro, in which Socrates famously asked &quot;Is the pious (τὸ ὅσιον) loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?&quot; (10a). Is it good because the gods will it or do the gods will it because it is good?

This concept was used to develop the various common law offences. In the Case of Proclamations, it was determined that &quot;that which is against common law is , is such an offence as is prohibited by Act of Parliament&quot;.

Another way to describe the underlying conceptual difference between &quot; and &quot; is &quot; and &quot;, namely something that is commanded () because it is just () and something that is just () because it is commanded (iussum).

<text>The Great Mouse Detective (released as Basil the Great Mouse Detective in some countries and The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective during its 1992 re-release) is a 1986 American animated mystery adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Based on the children&#x27;s book series &quot;Basil of Baker Street&quot; by Eve Titus and Paul Galdone, the film is written and directed by John Musker, Dave Michener, Ron Clements, and Burny Mattinson. Featuring the voices of Vincent Price, Barrie Ingham, Val Bettin, Susanne Pollatschek, Candy Candido, Diana Chesney, Eve Brenner, and Alan Young, the plot follows a mouse detective who undertakes to help a young mouse find and save her father from the criminal mastermind Professor Ratigan.

&quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; draws heavily on the tradition of Sherlock Holmes with a heroic mouse who consciously emulates the detective. Titus named the main character after actor Basil Rathbone, who is best remembered for playing Holmes in film (and whose voice, sampled from a 1966 reading of &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; was the voice of Holmes in this film, 19 years after his death). Sherlock Holmes also mentions &quot;Basil&quot; as one of his aliases in the Arthur Conan Doyle story &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter&quot;.

&quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; was released to theaters on July 2, 1986, to positive reviews from critics and financial success, in sharp contrast to the box office underperformance of Disney&#x27;s previous animated feature film, &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985). The film&#x27;s timely success has been credited with keeping Walt Disney Animation going after the previous film&#x27;s failure by renewing upper management&#x27;s confidence in the department, thus setting the stage for the Disney Renaissance when feature animated films would become the corporation&#x27;s most lucrative and prestigious product.

==Plot==

In 1897 London, a young mouse named Olivia Flaversham celebrates her birthday with her single father, Mr. Flaversham. However, a bat with a crippled wing and a peg leg arrives unexpectedly and kidnaps Flaversham. Olivia leaves to find Basil of Baker Street, the famous Great Mouse Detective, but gets lost. David Q. Dawson, a retired army surgeon mouse newly returned from Afghanistan, meets Olivia and escorts her to Basil&#x27;s residence. Being busy already, Basil initially dismisses them. Olivia then mentions the bat that abducted her father, and Basil realizes that Olivia saw Fidget, the assistant of Professor Ratigan, the criminal mastermind whom Basil was working to catch. It is then revealed that Ratigan kidnapped Flaversham to create a clockwork robot replica of the Queen of the Mice, so that Ratigan can usurp her place as &quot;Supreme Ruler of all Mousedom&quot;. Flaversham initially refuses to participate in the scheme, but capitulates when Ratigan threatens to harm Olivia.

Meanwhile, Fidget appears in Basil&#x27;s window, then suddenly disappears. Basil, Dawson and Olivia take Toby, Sherlock Holmes&#x27; pet Basset Hound, to trail Fidget&#x27;s scent. They trace Fidget to a human-sized toyshop; while searching the area, Dawson finds Fidget&#x27;s checklist, and Basil discovers Fidget has been stealing clockwork mechanisms and toy soldiers&#x27; uniforms.

Fidget ambushes and kidnaps Olivia before Basil and Dawson can stop him. Basil does some chemical tests to the checklist, discovering it came from the &quot;Rat Trap&quot;, a tavern near the junction of the sewer and the Thames. Basil and Dawson disguise themselves as sailors and head to the tavern; they spot Fidget there, and follow him to Ratigan&#x27;s headquarters, only to be ambushed by Ratigan and his henchmen. Ratigan has the pair tied to a spring-loaded mousetrap connected to a Rube Goldberg machine of various killing devices. Ratigan then sets out for Buckingham Palace, where his henchmen hijack the royal guards&#x27; roles and kidnap the Mouse Queen. Inspired by a remark Dawson made, Basil deduces the trap&#x27;s weakness, freeing himself, Dawson and Olivia.

At Buckingham Palace, Ratigan forces Flaversham to operate the toy Queen, while the real one is taken to be fed to Felicia, Ratigan&#x27;s pet cat. The toy Queen declares Ratigan the ruler of all Mousedom, and he announces his dictatorial plans for his new &quot;subjects&quot;. After Basil, Dawson, and Olivia save Flaversham and the real Queen, they restrain Fidget and Ratigan&#x27;s other henchmen, while Toby chases Felicia until she jumps over a wall, inadvertently into a pack of Royal Guard Dogs. Basil seizes control of the mechanical queen, making it denounce Ratigan as a fraud while breaking it into pieces. Realizing Ratigan&#x27;s treason, the enraged crowd attacks, but Ratigan escapes on his dirigible with Fidget, holding Olivia hostage.

Basil, Dawson, and Flaversham create an airship from a matchbox, balloons, and a Union Jack, and set off in pursuit. Ratigan tosses Fidget overboard to lighten the load; however, Basil jumps onto the dirigible to confront Ratigan, causing it to crash straight into Big Ben&#x27;s clockface. Inside the clocktower, Basil restrains Ratigan, rescues Olivia, and safely delivers her to Flaversham. Ratigan breaks free and attacks Basil; however, when the clock strikes 10:00, the vibrations cause Ratigan to fall to his death. He attempts to take Basil with him, but Basil grabs a part of Ratigan&#x27;s dirigible and saves himself.

Back at Baker Street, the group recounts their adventures. The Flavershams depart for home, and Dawson reluctantly resolves to leave as well. A new client arrives, and Basil introduces Dawson to her as his friend and investigative partner, prompting Dawson to remain and assist in Basil&#x27;s future cases.

==Production==
The idea of doing an animated film about Sherlock Holmes with animals was first discussed during the production of &quot;The Rescuers&quot;. Veteran layout artist Joe Hale is credited with suggesting to adapt the children&#x27;s book series &quot;Basil of Baker Street&quot; by Eve Titus, but the project fell into development limbo because of the similarities to &quot;The Rescuers&quot;. In 1982, Ron Clements proposed adapting the children&#x27;s book series into an animated feature and, along with story artist Pete Young, it was pitched to Disney President Ron Miller who approved the project. Earlier in his career, Clements created a 15-minute Sherlock Holmes animated short recorded on Super 8 film. Because the animators were displeased with the direction &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was heading, &quot;Basil of Baker Street&quot; was approved as an alternative project.

Burny Mattinson and John Musker were assigned as the original directors while Dave Michener was also added as co-director. Miller became the producer for the film. The first idea for the victim was for Olivia—then an older and potential love interest whom Dawson falls for, but Miller suggested the character be &quot;a little girl, someone they [the audience] can feel sorry for.&quot; One of the dropped characters was a stool pigeon who always hung around Buckingham Palace and tipped Basil off about the skullduggery. The writers dropped the characters deciding for Basil to figure it out for himself.

With the departure of Miller in 1984, the board of directors appointed Michael Eisner, who had resigned from Paramount Pictures, to become the new CEO. Eisner recruited former production head Jeffrey Katzenberg to become studio chairman over Disney&#x27;s film division. Following a story reel screening of &quot;Basil&quot;, Eisner and Katzenberg complained about the slow pacing of the story and ordered for rewrites before animation would commence. Although the intended release was set for Christmas 1987, Eisner slashed the projected production budget at $24 million in half where it was green-lit at $10 million and moved the release date up to July 1986 giving the production team one year to complete the film. To replace Miller who had been producer, Feature Animation chairman Roy E. Disney assigned Mattinson to serve as director/producer, but finding both tasks much too laborious, Mattinson decided to remain as producer. Musker and Michener remained as directors, but with the shortened production schedule, Clements became an additional director.

Following the box office under-performance of the 1985 Paramount/Amblin film &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Eisner decided to rename &quot;Basil of Baker Street&quot; into &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; feeling the name &quot;Basil&quot; was &quot;too English&quot;. The re-titling of the film proved to be unpopular with the filmmakers so much that animator Ed Gombert wrote a satirical interoffice memo, allegedly by studio executive Peter Schneider, which gave preceding Disney films generic titles such as &quot;Seven Little Men Help a Girl&quot;, &quot;The Wonderful Elephant Who Could Really Fly&quot;, &quot;The Little Deer Who Grew Up&quot;, &quot;The Girl with the See-through Shoes&quot;, &quot;Two Dogs Fall in Love&quot;, &quot;Puppies Taken Away&quot;, and &quot;A Boy, a Bear and a Big Black Cat&quot;. These generic titles would later become a category on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;.

===Casting===
Following a succession of American and British actors who read for the part of Basil, Royal Shakespeare actor Barrie Ingham won the role within six minutes of his audition. Val Bettin was co-director Ron Clements&#x27;s first choice for Dawson. For Olivia, Susanne Pollatschek was selected over hundreds of other applicants while Alan Young, who had voiced Scrooge McDuck for &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, was selected to voice her father Hiriam because of his authentic Scottish brogue.

When the filmmakers watched the 1950 comedy film &quot;Champagne for Caesar&quot; to study Ronald Colman&#x27;s performance as a possible model for Basil, they immediately decided to cast Vincent Price, who also starred in the film, as Ratigan. A veteran actor for fifty-two years, Price was willing to do an audition commenting &quot;If anybody but Disney had asked me, I would have been offended.&quot; Following a voice test, veteran voice artist Candy Candido recorded his dialogue for Fidget in one hour. To heighten the pitch, the tape recording of his voice was sped up. Candido&#x27;s natural voice was kept for one character shouting &quot;Get off, you eight-legged bum.&quot;

===Animation===
Basil was first modeled on Bing Crosby, but the animators eventually took inspiration from Leslie Howard. Initially, Ratigan had been designed as thin, weasely, and ratlike. Following the screening of &quot;Champagne for Caesar&quot;, Glen Keane noted that following the casting of Price, &quot;his expressive voice and attitude inspired us to further redesign the character.&quot; Additionally, during one story meeting, Glen Keane decided to base the stature of Ratigan on then-Disney CEO Ron Miller, who was a 6&#x27;6&quot; former football player for the Los Angeles Rams. Furthermore, Keane lifted his personality as he was thumbing through these &quot;photographs of people of London in the 1800s, of railroad men, and there was this one guy smoking a cigar—he had a top hat and there was just something about this guy—this Ratigan ... this rat sucking the cigar, completely dressed to the hilt, he was sharp and perfect—he&#x27;s a sewer rat dressed like a king and he lives as a king!&quot; The following supervising animators included Mark Henn for Basil, Hendel Butoy for Dawson, Rob Minkoff for Olivia, Andreas Deja for Queen Moustoria, Ruben Aquino for Mrs. Judson, and Mike Gabriel for Toby and Felicia.

The original finale was to take place on the hands of Big Ben with Ratigan eventually falling to his demise. However, layout artist Mike Peraza approached Musker with the idea of restaging the final confrontation so the characters would break through the face of Big Ben with the grinding clockwork gears providing added menace, in which Musker agreed. Peraza&#x27;s inspiration for the scene was a Japanese anime film, &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; (1979), the feature film debut of animator Hayao Miyazaki which is part of the &quot;Lupin III&quot; franchise; &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot;, which Peraza was a fan of, featured a climactic scene involving characters amidst giant turning gears in a clock tower. Pereza and his team was sent to London for video reference and were granted unprecedented access to the clockworks inside Big Ben. Because the bells would chime at every quarter-hour, the team completed their research in one hour.

Back at the Feature Animation building, animators Phil Nibbelink and Tad Gielow spent months designing the interior of Big Ben, with each gear produced as wire-frame graphics on a computer that was printed out and traced onto animation cels onto which the colors and characters were added. The two-minute climax scene thus used computer-generated imagery (CGI), making it the first Disney film to extensively use computer animation, a fact that Disney used to promote the film during marketing.

The film was the last work to feature Eric Larson as an animation consultant before his retirement. Larson was the last of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men, the group that had defined much of Disney&#x27;s theatrical direction since the 1930s. The character of Dr. Dawson was modeled on Larson as a tribute.

==Music==
Unusually for a Disney animated feature, there was no soundtrack album released alongside the film; it was released in 1992 alongside the film&#x27;s reissue under its new title by Varèse Sarabande, the only Disney cartoon to have an original soundtrack on the label to date (and the only one not to be issued under a Walt Disney imprint). The album marked the debut of Henry Mancini for score composition of an animated feature aside from the animated opening for &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;.

Initially, Mancini composed a song titled &quot;Are You the One Who Loves Me?&quot; to serve as a parody of a Victorian British music hall. Already in rough animation, the song was recorded by Shani Wallis. However, Katzenberg and the new management desired a more contemporary song as they would help make the film more marketable. Michael Jackson was considered by Eisner to voice a character who would enter the saloon, confront Basil, and sing a song at the tavern, but the suggestion was met with uncomfortable silence for which Eisner withdrew the idea; Eisner later proposed for Madonna to perform the song. Eventually, Melissa Manchester was brought in; she wrote and performed &quot;Let Me Be Good to You&quot;, by which the rough animation had to be re-timed and often re-animated to properly sync with the song. Mancini also co-wrote two of the film&#x27;s three original songs, &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Criminal Mind&quot; and &quot;Goodbye So Soon&quot; (both performed by Vincent Price).

Original songs performed in the film include:

==Release==
During the film&#x27;s initial theatrical release, the film was accompanied with the short, &quot;Clock Cleaners&quot;.

===Home media===
Following the theatrical re-release in February 1992, the film was released on VHS and Laserdisc in July 1992 as part of the Walt Disney Classics series. It was placed into moratorium on April 30, 1993. It was released again on VHS on August 3, 1999 (with a game sheet inside it as part of a contest) and on DVD in 2002 with a short making-of featurette. In the United Kingdom, it was first released on VHS in 1992 followed by re-releases in 1993 and 1995.

A &quot;Mystery in the Mist Edition&quot; of &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; was released on DVD on April 13, 2010, and on Blu-ray Disc on October 9, 2012. Unlike previous home media releases, which all used the 1992 reissue title print (&quot;The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective&quot;), this DVD restored the original 1986 title card, which had previously not been seen since the original 1986 release. The DVD also has the film in its 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio, which brings it closer to its original theatrical aspect ratio. The Blu-ray edition is region-free and thus can be played in any region of the world. The Blu-ray was finally released in the UK on November 9, 2015, and released in France on Blu-ray on October 20, 2015.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
On their syndicated television show, &quot;At the Movies&quot;, the film received a &quot;two thumbs up&quot; rating from critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. In his print review for &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;, Siskel enthusiastically praised the film as the most &quot;truly memorable animated feature in 25 years&quot; that &quot;travels a wide emotional range, taking us from cuddly to scary, from recognition to wonder.&quot; Likewise, in his print review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert gave the film three stars out of four in which he praised the film&#x27;s animation and compared the film to that of Disney&#x27;s golden age. He summarized that &quot;the result is a movie like &quot;The Great Mouse Detective,&quot; which looks more fully animated than anything in some 30 years.&quot;

London&#x27;s &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;As usual with film noir [...] it is the villain who steals the heart and one is rooting for in the breathtaking showdown high up in the cogs and ratchets of Big Ben.&quot; Nina Darnton of &quot;The New York Times&quot; applauded that &quot;[t]he heroes are appealing, the villains have that special Disney flair – humorous blackguards who really enjoy being evil – and the script is witty and not overly sentimental.&quot; Johanna Steinmetz, also from &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;, graded the film three-and-a-half stars (out of four) writing &quot;This movie is cute, cute, cute, but it&#x27;s a higher grade of cute than &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981). The key to good Disney animation is character and facial expression, and &quot;Detective&quot; abounds in both.&quot; Alex Stewart reviewed &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #83, and stated that &quot;After their dismal fudge of &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, it&#x27;s good to see the Disney studios taking a step, however cautious, towards the world of animation as it is today. The style is looser and more vigorous, and, in a climactic fight inside Big Ben, effectively amalgamates computer-drawn clockwork with hand-drawn characters.&quot;

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received approval rating based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s consensus states that &quot;&quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; may not rank with Disney&#x27;s classics, but it&#x27;s an amiable, entertaining picture with some stylishly dark visuals.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 73 based on 13 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Animation critic Charles Solomon listed this as one of the best animated films of the 1980s while singling out Keane&#x27;s key work on Ratigan.

===Box-office===
The film grossed around $50 million worldwide against a budget of over $14 million during its initial release. Its inexpensive success after its predecessor&#x27;s under-performance gave the new management of Disney confidence in the viability of their animation department, though it was surpassed at the box office by &quot;An American Tail&quot;. Re-titled as &quot;The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective&quot;, the film was re-released theatrically on February 14, 1992, where it grossed $13,288,756. &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; has had a lifetime North American gross of $38.7 million across its original release and reissue.

==Legacy==
Basil and Professor Ratigan were characters to meet-and-greet at the Disney Parks, until both were retired after 2004.

In the television series &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, a little statue of Basil opened the secret passage to Darkwing&#x27;s hidden base. Some of the characters from the film have recurring cameo appearances in the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;.

Professor Ratigan is one of the villains with a main focus in the anthology film &quot;Once Upon a Halloween&quot;. He is also one of the villains present in the board game &quot;Disney Villainous&quot;.

Basil of Baker Street appears as a playable character in the video game &quot;Disney Heroes: Battle Mode&quot;.

Like every other Walt Disney Animation Studios character, Basil, Ratigan, Dawson, and Olivia have cameo appearances in the short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;.

Additionally, in honor of Mickey Mouse&#x27;s 75th anniversary, was planned a film under the title &quot;The Search for Mickey Mouse&quot; in which Mickey gets kidnapped by unknown forces, forcing Minnie Mouse to enlist Basil of Baker Street to investigate his disappearance. However, the project was cancelled after it suffered script problems.

In 2022, &quot;Rapunzel&#x27;s Tangled Adventure&quot;, &quot;Monsters At Work&quot; and &quot;Wish&quot; alumni Tom Caulfield revealed that he alongside &quot;The Ghost and Molly McGee&quot; creators Bill Motz and Bob Roth pitched a crossover series featuring &quot;The Rescuers&quot; and &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; at Disney Television Animation. The series would have featured the descendant of Basil working at a modern version of The Rescue Aid Society more akin to &quot;The Kingsman&quot; or lead by Bianca. According to Caulfield the project was scrapped due the release of the &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; film&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Continental Mark II is an ultra-luxury coupé that was sold by the Continental Division of Ford for the 1956 and 1957 model years. The first (and only) product line of Continental, the Mark II was developed as the worldwide flagship vehicle of Ford Motor Company. Developed as a successor for the 1939–1948 Lincoln Continental, the Mark II derived its nameplate from European manufacturing practice, denoting a second generation of the model family; Ford would later use this nomenclature for the Mark Series of flagship personal luxury cars.

As the most expensive American-produced automobile of the time, the Mark II was marketed against the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud and the Bentley Continental. Produced solely as a two-door hardtop coupe, the Mark II was largely hand-assembled, sourcing its V8 powertrain from the standard Lincoln line.

Following the 1957 model year, the Mark II was discontinued, with the hand-built coupe replaced by a rebranded Lincoln. For 1969, Ford revived the Mark series chronology, debuting the (second) Continental Mark III coupe, leading to five successive generations, ending with the 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII coupe. Alongside its nameplate nomenclature, the Mark II debuted the integrated &quot;Continental&quot; spare-tire trunklid (in place of a bumper-mounted spare tire); each generation of the Mark Series (alongside the 1977–1980 Lincoln Versailles and 1982–1987 Lincoln Continental) used a variation of this feature. The Mark II also debuted the rectangular four-point star emblem, which remains in use on Lincoln-brand vehicles (in modified form) today.

The Mark II was assembled by Ford at Allen Park Body and Assembly in Allen Park, Michigan. Following the discontinuation of the Mark II, the facility was converted to the headquarters of the ill-fated Edsel brand. Today, it remains as the Ford Pilot Plant, where Ford pre-production vehicles are hand-assembled for testing and production development.

==Background==

For the 1949 model year, all three divisions of Ford Motor Company unveiled their first post-war product line, with Lincoln discontinuing the Lincoln Continental after six years of production (interrupted by World War II). Following World War II, the Lincoln and Mercury brands had been grouped together within a common division to streamline their operations. While the Lincoln Continental had gone on to build a positive reputation, the Continental was an aging design, as a variant of the 1936 Lincoln-Zephyr.

Following the withdrawal of the 1939–1948 Lincoln Continental, by the early 1950s, interest in a successor vehicle proved sufficient for Ford Motor Company to commence development on a successor. In 1952, the company formed the Special Product Operations team (later Special Products Division). Led by William Clay Ford, the team consisted of John Reinhart (chief stylist), Gordon Buehrig (chief body engineer; designer of the Cord 810), and Harley Copp (chief engineer).

Initially meeting with rejection from upper Ford management, in 1953, design work was approved to bring a successor to the Continental to production. A full-size clay model was approved in June 1953, “subject to minor revisions.” The same year, the two-door luxury segment saw several American-produced vehicles enter production, with the launch of the limited-production Cadillac Eldorado, Buick Skylark, and Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta convertibles by General Motors (coinciding with the launch of the Chevrolet Corvette, as a sports car roadster), the Chrysler C-300 and the Packard Caribbean convertible.

Under William Clay Ford, the Special Products Division set out several objectives. In addition to creating a successor to the 1939–1948 Lincoln Continental, the Continental Mark II was also intended to revive the memory of the 1930s coachbuilt Lincoln Model K, among the flagship American automobiles of the time. In April 1955, the Continental Division was created by Ford Motor Company as a stand-alone division to handle the Continental Mark II. While a two-door hardtop would be offered as the debut vehicle, the model range would expand to a retractable-hardtop convertible and a four-door hardtop sedan.

Ford noted in 1956 that: “At the very beginning of this program, four major design objectives were set forth: 1. The new Continental was to have distinctive styling. The styling was to be based upon clean, classic lines, rather than modernistic innovations. 2. The new car was to include technological advancements and special features which would enhance its value to the customer in terms of comfort, durability, safety, performance, and prestige. 3. The overall height of the car was not to exceed 58 in. 4. There was to be maximum interchangeability of chassis parts with Lincoln, including engine, transmission, rear axle, and suspension.”

While the original Continental coupe sold relatively poorly in contrast to its convertible counterpart, the Special Products Division had set out to introduce a full range of body styles in contrast to the Cadillac Eldorado and Packard Caribbean.

==Model overview==
Intended as a successor to the Lincoln Continental, effectively making its predecessor a Mark I, the Continental Mark II made its world debut at the Paris Motor Show in October 1955, a year and eight months after the introduction of the smaller two-passenger Ford Thunderbird personal luxury car (roadster). The Mark II debuted in the United States at Ford Motor Company headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. With a $9,966 base price ($ in dollars ), the Mark II was the most expensive domestic-produced automobile sold in the United States at the time. The only extra cost option offered for the Mark II was a $595 ($ today) air conditioner. Despite its high price, Ford Motor Company estimated it lost nearly $1,000 ($ today) for every unit produced.

=== Chassis ===

The rear-wheel-drive Continental Mark II is constructed using a body-on-frame chassis layout. To lower its body and to optimize the use of dual exhausts, the Mark II uses a Y-shaped frame designed for the model line. A fully boxed crossmember was placed under the front seats, with six tube-style crossmembers located through the rest of the chassis.

While the suspension layout itself was largely adapted from the Lincoln model line, to improve the handling and ride of the 5,000 pound vehicle, the Mark II introduced speed-sensitive shock absorbers for the front wheels.

To streamline production, powertrain components were adapted from the Lincoln model line and checked through the division&#x27;s quality-control program during production. The 368 cubic-inch Lincoln Y-block V8 powered the Mark II, paired with the 3-speed Turbo-Drive automatic transmission. For 1956, the engines produced 285 hp, increased to 300 hp for 1957. For a distinctive appearance, the engine had unique finned, cast-aluminum valve covers. Because the engine sat lower than in the Lincoln—and at a different driveline angle—a special oil pan was necessary “to provide the required volume of oil for extremely steep grades.” In a 1956 report from Popular Mechanics, the Mark ll produced 16.7 mpg at 50 mph.
=== Body ===
While Continental was planned as a three-model range, the Mark II two-door hardtop coupe was the sole model to reach production. Sharing its 126-wheelbase with the Lincoln model line, the Mark II was over four inches shorter, two inches narrower, and over three inches lower than the Lincoln Premiere and Capri. In an extensive contrast to other American luxury cars, the body of the Mark II was conservatively styled, with chrome limited to the bumpers, grille, rocker panels, and window trim. Few curves were added to the body, with the exception of a body accent line on the fenders and doors.

In a notable departure from both American and European styling precedents, neither tailfins nor pontoon fenders were seen; a swing-away left taillamp hid the fuel cap from view. To update the Continental tire styling feature, Ford engineers moved the vertical tire inside the trunk; as the spare tire was still vertically mounted, the &quot;tire bulge&quot; design was introduced in order to allow for the trunklid to close.

While Continental was intended largely as a luxury vehicle, interior elements of the Mark II were intended to make the vehicle more personal than a typical American luxury vehicle. Central to the interior design was the wraparound windshield (mounted 8 inches further rearward than in a Lincoln). In contrast to Lincoln and Mercury vehicles of the time, the Continental Mark II was given a vertically angled steering wheel (with a full set of gauges grouped behind the steering wheel).

The Continental Mark II would have an extensive list of standard equipment for the time, equipped with power steering, power brakes, power windows, power seats, power vent windows, and full instrumentation, including a tachometer and a low-level fuel warning. In total, the Mark II was offered with nineteen standard exterior colors and 43 interior design schemes (with five interior fabrics). In a break from other luxury products offered by competitors, two-tone paint combinations were not available, while privately the customer could be accommodated if the appearance was desired.

=== Quality control ===

In place of style or outright performance, to justify its exclusive price, Ford Motor Company sought to market the Continental model line as the highest-quality American automobile; in line with the coachbuilt cars of the 1930s, the Mark II was largely hand-built. While sharing its design with the standard Lincoln model line, each Continental Mark II engine was effectively factory-blueprinted; after selection from the Lincoln assembly line, the engine was disassembled and reassembled after numerous quality-control and performance inspections. Each of the four wheel covers was hand-assembled with individually fastened vanes; each letter of &quot;Continental&quot; was individually bolted onto the trunklid.

As American leather was sprayed vs vat dyed, Bridge of Weir leather (imported from Scotland) was used throughout the interior; as Continental felt the results were better-wearing, the leather used the Vat dye process and was dyed in the United States. While metallic-style exterior paints had become popular on 1950s American luxury cars, durability concerns forced Continental to adapt lacquer-based paint colors (the first Ford Motor Company vehicle to do so).

During the development of the Continental division by Ford Special Products, Ford Motor Company sought to develop the most stringent quality control programs ever seen in the American automotive industry, coming up with seven major initiatives for Continental. The quality control program included all employees at the assembly facility, from assembly workers to upper management. In one instance, a transporter truck of Mark IIs was returned to the factory as a gate security guard noticed a paint defect on one vehicle.

== Branding ==

Developed as the successor to the first-generation Lincoln Continental, the branding of the Continental Mark II has been a source of confusion. Though the Continental Division was a stand-alone division (with a dedicated manufacturing facility), its product line was marketed and serviced through the Lincoln-Mercury dealer network (as Continentals shared mechanical commonality with Lincolns).

In July 1956, Ford closed the Continental Division, integrating Continental into Lincoln.

===Post Mark II===
For 1958, the Continental branding underwent further confusion. Though Continental no longer existed as a stand-alone division, the branding was used for a new car, as Ford introduced the Continental Mark III. Developed under a mandate to reduce its price to $6,000 (more competitive with Cadillac Sixty Specials and Imperial LeBarons). One of the largest cars ever built by Ford Motor Company, the Mark III was forced to abandon hand assembly, now built alongside the Lincoln Premiere; the model line was distinguished by its reverse-slant rear-window roofline (on all bodystyles, including convertibles).

For 1959, the Mark III became the Mark IV, though receiving only minor model-year changes. For 1960, Ford introduced the Lincoln Continental Mark V, effectively ending the use of the stand-alone Continental name.

For 1961 production, Ford condensed the Lincoln brand solely to a single Lincoln Continental nameplate, dropping any generational nomenclature. With the exception of the 1977-1980 Lincoln Versailles, Continental was the exclusive nameplate used by Lincoln until the 1981 rebranding of full-size Lincolns as the Lincoln Town Car.

===Mark Series revival===
For the 1969 model year, Ford Motor Company introduced the Continental Mark III flagship personal luxury car. Though the nameplate had been used in 1958, the design was developed as a contemporary successor of the Mark II, effectively removing the 1958-1960 generation retroactively from the Mark Series.

Far less expensive than the Mark II, the Mark III was derived from the Ford Thunderbird, sharing its chassis and wheelbase. One of the most advanced American vehicles of the time, the Mark III was fitted with full power equipment, full instrumentation, air conditioning, and was one of the first vehicles offered with an optional sunroof and anti-lock brakes. Many features of the exterior design of the Mark III was adopted by the Lincoln Continental for 1970, influencing Lincoln design through the end of the decade.

Through the 1970s, Ford followed the Mark III with the 1972 Mark IV and the 1977 Mark V; the latter two generations are derived from the 1972 Ford Thunderbird chassis.

===Rivalry with Eldorado===

==== Eldorado Brougham vs. Mark II (1957-1960) ====
In response to the Continental Mark II, General Motors released the Cadillac Eldorado Brougham four-door hardtop. Taking over the lead for most-expensive American car, the Eldorado Brougham cost US$13,074 ($ in dollars ), over $3,000 more than the Mark II. The first four-door Eldorado, the Brougham was fitted with rear-hinged coach doors, a stainless-steel roof, additional lower chrome body trim, and four front headlights. One of the most sophisticated cars of its time, the Eldorado Brougham was fitted with self leveling air suspension, cruise control, automatic parking brake, power windows and door locks, and power trunk release and antenna.

A second-generation Eldorado Brougham was produced from 1959 to 1960; styled by GM, the limited-production $13,075 model was assembled in Italy by Pininfarina. More conservatively styled than its predecessor, the second-generation Eldorado Brougham previewed many design features introduced on early 1960s Cadillacs (including smaller tailfins). In contrast to its predecessor, the new generation shared greater commonality with the standard Eldorado, though air conditioning, automatic high beams, and cruise control remained.

==== Eldorado vs. Mark Series (1967-1998) ====
For 1967, GM redesigned the Cadillac Eldorado; while remaining the flagship two-door Cadillac, it was repackaged as a personal luxury car, sharing a front-wheel drive chassis with the Oldsmobile Toronado. Following the 1969 debut of the Mark III, Ford and General Motors established an informal brand rivalry between their company flagship luxury vehicles (similar to the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro). Through the 1998 withdrawal of the Lincoln Mark VIII, both the Eldorado and various generations of the Mark Series competed directly against one another in the marketplace (with the exception of the 1980-1983 Continental Mark VI).

Motor Trend reviewed various generations of both model lines against one another in a &quot;King of the Hill&quot; series through the 1970s and 1980s.

===End of Continental brand===
For 1986, Ford took a definitive stance over the Continental brand name; after existing as a sub-marque sold through Lincoln-Mercury for 18 years, the Continental Mark Series was officially rebranded as a Lincoln model line. The Continental Mark VII became the Lincoln Mark VII, adopting Lincoln badging and a Lincoln VIN designation.

==Production and sales==
The Continental Mark II was produced at the Allen Park Body &amp; Assembly facility in Allen Park, Michigan. Established as the headquarters and assembly plant for Continental, in a major break from Ford tradition, a moving assembly line was largely dispensed with to facilitate hand-built construction and inspection. In the factory, each vehicle was assembled on a mobile carrier; as each segment of assembly and inspection was completed, vehicles were moved by hand to different assembly stations. Following the 1957 withdrawal of the Mark II, the facility was repurposed, becoming the headquarters of Edsel. Today, the facility is used as the Ford Vehicle Operations General Office and New Model Programs Development Center, used to develop new vehicles and their manufacturing.

In total, 3,005 Continental Mark IIs were produced. This number includes three prototypes and 13 pre-production vehicles. Serial numbers for Mark IIs ran from 975 to 3989; numbers 986 to 998 were unused. The first regular production car was number 1001. The three prototype cars were numbered 500, 501, and 502F. The first two were scrapped in June 1956, and the third car survives today.

While a convertible never reached production, two 1956 Mark IIs were converted to convertibles on an official basis. One was converted by Hess &amp; Eisenhardt (no. 1126), while another was converted by Derham Body Company (no. 3190). The latter car was given to the wife of William Clay Ford as a personal vehicle; initially painted white, it was later painted sky blue.

Many Mark IIs were purchased new by wealthy and prominent figures. These included Barry Goldwater (no. 2804), Dwight Eisenhower (no. 3411), Frank Sinatra (no. 1884), and Liz Taylor (no. 3196).

== Appearances in media ==

The Continental Mark II was featured in the 1956 film &quot;High Society&quot;, starring Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, and Louis Armstrong.

After its sale to George Barris, the 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car (which used a Mark II chassis and powertrain) was converted to become the Batmobile for the namesake 1960s TV series.

== Legacy ==
While the Mark II two-door hardtop was the exclusive model line produced by Continental, several elements of the Mark II would live on in other Ford Motor Company vehicles. While the Continental retractable hardtop never saw production, the top mechanism would be utilized in the 1957–1959 Ford Skyliner; the mechanism also would see use by the 1961–1967 Lincoln Continental and the 1958-1966 Ford Thunderbird.

As part of the Lincoln brand history, the Continental Mark II is the beginning of the Mark series (with two successors in its model history), introducing the integrated &quot;Continental tire&quot;. The four-point star emblem of Lincoln debuted on the Mark II and has remained in use on Lincoln vehicles since 1958.

Today, approximately half of the original circa 3,000 cars still exist in various states of repair; an active Mark II Forum exists.

<doc id="306815" wikidata="Q1260428" url="?curid=306815" title="Maximus II of Antioch">
<text>Maximus II of Antioch was a Patriarch of Antioch. After the deposition of Domnus II of Antioch by the Second Council of Ephesus, in 449, Dioscorus I of Alexandria persuaded the emperor Theodosius II to fill the vacancy with one of the clergy of Constantinople. Maximus was selected and ordained, in violation of canon law, by Patriarch Anatolius of Constantinople, without the official sanction of the clergy or people of Antioch.

Maximus II, though his elevation was under questionable conditions, gained a positive reputation in the conduct of his diocese and province. He dispatched &quot;epistolae tractoriae&quot; through the churches subject to him as metropolitan, requiring the signatures of the bishops to Pope Leo I&#x27;s famous &quot;Leo&#x27;s Tome&quot; and to another document condemning both Nestorius and Eutyches.

Having thus discreetly assured his position, he was summoned to the Council of Chalcedon in October 451 and took his seat without question, and when the acts of the Second Council of Ephesus were quashed, including the deposition of the other prelates, a special exception was made of the substitution of Maximus II for Domnus II on the express ground that Leo I had opened communion with him and recognized his episcopate (Philippe Labbe, &quot;Concilia&quot;, iv. 682).

His most important controversy at Chalcedon was with Juvenal of Jerusalem regarding the limits of their respective patriarchates. It was long and bitter; at last a compromise was accepted by the council, that Antioch should minister to the provinces of the two Phoenicias and Arabia and that the three provinces of Palestine should fall under the Patriarch of Jerusalem.

Maximus II next appears in a letter, dated 11 June 453, from Leo the Great, to whom he had appealed in defence of the prerogatives of his see. Leo I promised to help him against either Jerusalem or Constantinople, exhorting him to assert his privileges as bishop of the third see in Christendom (i.e. only inferior to Alexandria and Rome). Maximus II&#x27;s zeal for the orthodox faith receives warm commendation from Leo I, who exhorts him as &quot;consors apostolicae sedis&quot; to maintain the doctrine founded by St. Peter &quot;speciali magisterio&quot; in the cities of Antioch and Rome, against the erroneous teaching both of Nestorius and Eutyches and to watch over the churches of the East generally and keep Leo informed about events. Leo I closes his letter with a desire that Maximus will restrain unordained persons, whether monks or laity, from public preaching and teaching.

Two years later, in 455, the episcopate of Maximus II came to a disastrous close by his deposition. The nature of his offence is nowhere specified. We do not know how much longer he lived or what became of him.

<doc id="306817" wikidata="Q44683" url="?curid=306817" title="Chavo Guerrero Jr.">
<text>Salvador Guerrero IV (born October 20, 1970) better known by his ring names Chavo Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero Jr., is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his tenures in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/WWE), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), All Elite Wrestling (AEW), Lucha Underground (LU), Ring of Honor (ROH) and Nación Lucha Libre (NLL).

As a singles wrestler, Guerrero Jr. is a former ECW World Champion in WWE, and a six-time Cruiserweight Champion between WWE and WCW. He also achieved success in tag team wrestling, being a five-time world tag team champion – winning the WWE Tag Team Championship twice with his uncle Eddie Guerrero as Los Guerreros, the WCW World Tag Team Championship once with Corporal Cajun as the Misfits in Action, and the TNA World Tag Team Championship twice with Hernandez. Between WCW, WWE, and TNA, he has held a dozen total championships, including one world championship.

==Early life==
Salvador was born and raised in El Paso, Texas. Guerrero grew up watching wrestling and going to wrestling promotions where he watched his family wrestle. There was also a wrestling ring in the Guerreros&#x27; back yard. Chavo played with his uncle Eddie Guerrero constantly in the wrestling ring while practicing moves on each other.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1994–1996)===
Guerrero made his professional wrestling debut in May 1994 wrestling in Mexico. He toured with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) during 1996, featuring mainly on the lower card. Guerrero competed in the Best of the Super Junior IV tournament but did not earn enough points to become the victor.

===World Championship Wrestling (1996–2001)===

He joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in May 1996. He made his in-ring debut wrestling Steven Regal in a dark match. On July 22—Guerrero&#x27;s &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; debut—he lost to Dean Malenko via submission. On August 3, 1996, Guerrero received his first title shot in WCW against Ric Flair on &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; for the WCW United States Championship. Flair beat Guerrero via submission to retain his championship.

Guerrero&#x27;s first pay-per-view (PPV) appearance was in a dark match loss to Konnan on WCW Hog Wild. Then at &quot;WCW WorldWide&quot;, on August 11, 1996, he and Eddie Guerrero defeated High Voltage. After a series of singles wins, Guerrero faced Diamond Dallas Page after a short feud on Fall Brawl in a losing effort on September 15.

While in WCW, Chavo shared the limelight with his uncle Eddie, becoming a reluctant ally of his uncle&#x27;s. As part of their storyline, Eddie continually tried to make Chavo adopt Eddie&#x27;s cheating tactics, but he often refused to do so. Eventually, Guerrero&#x27;s treatment at the hands of Eddie would drive him &quot;crazy,&quot; and he adopted the gimmick of a psycho fixated with a hobby horse he dubbed &quot;Pepé.&quot; This led to a feud with Norman Smiley in which Pepé was thrown into a woodchipper. Another result of his insanity was his inability to join Eddie&#x27;s Latino World Order stable, which was a take-off of the nWo. On June 14, 1998, Chavo defeated his uncle Eddie at The Great American Bash PPV. In July 1998 at the Bash at the Beach PPV, Guerrero faced Stevie Ray in a &quot;tune up match&quot; before he faced Eddie in a Hair vs Hair match, a match where the winner gets to shave his opponent&#x27;s hair. Chavo lost via opposum pin and began to shave his own hair off.

On January 17, 1999 at Souled Out, Guerrero was defeated by Norman Smiley in a match that was booked due to Guerrero&#x27;s companion Pepe being burnt by Smiley, ending the Pepe gimmick.

Guerrero and Billy Kidman tag teamed for a WCW tag team title tournament held on &quot;Nitro&quot;. Guerrero then turned on Kidman after being eliminated from the tournament, starting a feud. Guerrero faced Kidman for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship on WCW Superbrawl 9 on February 21, 1999 but failed to win the championship.

He was also a member of the comedy stable The Misfits in Action (MIA), consisting of himself, Hugh Morris (better known as Bill DeMott), Lash LeRoux and Van Hammer. They were managed by Major Gunns. Guerrero was billed as &quot;Lieutenant Loco.&quot; As Loco, he defeated Daffney for the Cruiserweight Championship in a triangle match also involving Disco Inferno on June 7, 2000 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;. On June 11, 2000 at The Great American Bash, Lt. Loco defeated Disco Inferno to retain the title. Loco lost the championship to Lance Storm a month later on &quot;Nitro&quot;. At WCW Mayhem, Loco left the MIA and reverted to Chavo Guerrero Jr.

Guerrero won the Cruiserweight Championship from Mike Sanders on the December 6 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;. He retained the title against Rey Mysterio Jr. on February 18, 2001 at SuperBrawl Revenge. As Cruiserweight Champion, Guerrero engaged in a feud against &quot;Sugar&quot; Shane Helms eventually losing the championship to Helms at Greed.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (2001–2011)===

====Los Guerreros (2001–2004)====

Guerrero&#x27;s contract with WCW was one of the twenty-five contracts that were included in WCW&#x27;s sale to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in March 2001. Like most of the wrestling talent that came over with WCW, Guerrero wrestled as a heel under the WCW banner as his WWF debut was as part of The Alliance, a group of WCW and ECW employees who had, in storyline, invaded the WWF after their promotion was bought out. On April 13, 2002, Guerrero faced Billy Kidman on an episode of &quot;WWF Metal&quot; for the Cruiserweight Championship and lost the match via pinfall. Guerrero spent time as an undercard wrestler in the company, which was soon rebranded World Wrestling Entertainment, wrestling for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship on numerous occasions.

Soon after returning to the active roster, Guerrero was aligned with his uncle Eddie, forming the tag team Los Guerreros. In contrast to his previous WCW storyline with his uncle, Guerrero fully adopted his uncle&#x27;s policy of &quot;Lie, Cheat and Steal&quot; to win matches as part of the gimmick. Los Guerreros won the tag team championships at Survivor Series on November 17, when they defeated Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit and Edge and Rey Mysterio in a Triple threat tag team elimination match. The duo turned face due to their popularity. On the February 6, 2003 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Los Guerreros lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to Team Angle. At WrestleMania XIX on March 30, they were again defeated by Team Angle in a triple threat match for the tag team titles, also involving the team of Benoit and Rhyno. They continued to feud with Team Angle and won the championships back on the September 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. One month later, they lost the titles to Basham Brothers on the October 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. After losing their WWE Tag Team Championship, Guerrero became jealous of his uncle&#x27;s growing popularity and WWE Championship ambitions, and on the January 8, 2004 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Chavo attacked Eddie after losing to the Basham Brothers in a rematch for the WWE Tag Team Championship and broke from the team, thus turning heel once again. He was soon joined by his father Chavo Sr. who sided with his son instead of his brother. Guerrero and his father teamed together to defeat Eddie and Kurt Angle on the January 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; Eddie, however, defeated Guerrero at the Royal Rumble on January 25 to end their feud.

====Cruiserweight Champion and Kerwin White (2004–2005)====

At No Way Out on February 15, Guerrero defeated Rey Mysterio to win the WWE Cruiserweight Championship, following interference from his father (now known as Chavo Classic). At WrestleMania XX on March 14, Guerrero successfully defended his title in a 10-man Cruiserweight Open by last eliminating Mysterio. In the following weeks, Guerrero defeated Mysterio, Funaki, Ultimo Dragon, Spike Dudley, Jamie Noble, Nunzio in one-on-one title matches. On the May 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero issued an open challenge for anyone he had not yet defeated to face him for his title. The challenge was answered by Jacqueline, who defeated Guerrero for the title after she gave him a &quot;low blow.&quot; He regained the title at Judgment Day on May 16. Guerrero then dropped the title on the May 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to his father, who &quot;accidentally&quot; pinned his son in a Triple Threat match which also involved Spike Dudley. Rey Mysterio later regained the title, and he and Chavo faced each other at The Great American Bash on June 27, however Mysterio won the match.

On the August 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero suffered a legitimate concussion due to Billy Kidman&#x27;s shooting star press and had to be taken to the hospital. Guerrero returned as a face on the October 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, exacting revenge from Kidman, who had turned heel as a result of the injury to Guerrero. Shortly after his feud with Kidman ended, Guerrero returned to his heel persona after receiving a negative reaction while facing then-cruiserweight champion Funaki in a losing effort during a &quot;SmackDown!&quot; show in Japan. Guerrero went on to win the Cruiserweight Championship once again at No Way Out on February 20, 2005, after eliminating Paul London in a six-way cruiserweight gauntlet match. He lost the title to London in a battle royal on the March 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;; Guerrero was the first person eliminated from the battle royal when everyone else in the match ganged up to throw him out right at the beginning.

In June, Guerrero became one of the last minute trades in the 2005 WWE Draft, which saw him jump from SmackDown! to the Raw brand. The next week, on the July 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he denounced his Hispanic heritage in favor of the &quot; way&quot;. This came after two weeks of being battered by the Mexican faction, the Mexicools. It led to the changing of his persona to &quot;Kerwin White&quot;, a stereotypical, middle-class, white, conservative, Anglo-American man. He dyed his hair blond and often drove a golf cart to the ring which held his golf clubs. Soon after his debut, White started making suggestive remarks towards African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and other non-White people, specifically directed towards Shelton Benjamin. On the September 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, White cost Benjamin a match against Rob Conway. Benjamin defeated White by disqualification the following week when White attacked him with his golf club. At Unforgiven on September 18, White was beaten by Benjamin. White then hired Nick Nemeth on the September 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as his new &quot;caddie&quot; to help him in his matches. Reflecting on the Kerwin White character during an interview with Chris Van Vliet in 2020, Guerrero recalled how he pitched being dressed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan on TV to get maximum heat while explained how his gimmick got people of all races to hate him by saying:

====Aftermath of Eddie Guerrero&#x27;s death (2005–2007)====

On the morning of November 13, Guerrero checked into the same hotel as his uncle, Eddie, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Guerrero was alerted by hotel security that Eddie did not respond to a wake-up call and upon opening the locked door to the room, Guerrero found his uncle unconscious. Guerrero attempted CPR but Eddie was declared dead when paramedics arrived on the scene. Later that afternoon, Guerrero appeared at a press conference with WWE chairman Vince McMahon to address Eddie&#x27;s death. These events resulted in Guerrero dropping the Kerwin White gimmick and wrestling under his real name as a face. He defeated John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) on the November 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, using the &quot;Three Amigos&quot; triple suplexes and the Frog Splash in tribute to Eddie. He also used the cheating tactic, &quot;playing possum,&quot; which Eddie made famous; behind the back of the distracted referee, Guerrero gently tossed a steel chair to a dazed JBL while Guerrero laid down, pretending to have been hit. The referee then turned and, seeing the &quot;unconscious&quot; Guerrero, almost disqualified the oblivious, chair-wielding JBL but stopped short so the tribute-style match could continue.

On the February 24, 2006 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero attacked Randy Orton when Orton began to insult Eddie and the heritage of the Guerreros. Guerrero was soon dragged out by security. On the February 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Guerrero faced off against Shelton Benjamin in a qualifying match for the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 22 on April 2. During the match, Orton interfered and hit Guerrero with the RKO, allowing Benjamin to get the pinfall victory. He proceeded to unsuccessfully challenge Benjamin for the WWE Intercontinental Championship on the April 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. In a segment that aired on &quot;WWE Unlimited&quot;, an emotional Guerrero decided to quit WWE, in storyline, after believing he had let his family, Eddie, and the fans down and expressed his doubts about being a wrestler.

Guerrero appeared at Judgment Day on May 21 to support Rey Mysterio. At The Great American Bash on July 23, Guerrero interfered in Mysterio&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship match, seemingly to help Mysterio. Guerrero, however, hit Mysterio with a steel chair, which allowed challenger King Booker to win the match and the title, turning heel once again. On the August 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero accused Mysterio of using Eddie&#x27;s name to succeed, claiming that he had disrespected Eddie&#x27;s memory. Guerrero went on to defeat Mysterio at SummerSlam on August 20 after Vickie Guerrero (Eddie&#x27;s widow) accidentally knocked Mysterio off the top turnbuckle. On the August 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Vickie came down to the ring to apologize to Mysterio and Guerrero but turned on Mysterio by hitting him in the back with a steel chair. The following week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Vickie announced herself as Guerrero&#x27;s new manager. Mysterio gained his revenge on Guerrero by defeating him in a Falls Count Anywhere match at No Mercy on October 8. Guerrero eventually challenged Mysterio to an &quot;I Quit&quot; match on the October 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which Guerrero won after injuring Mysterio&#x27;s knee.

A week later, Chris Benoit, another old friend of Eddie&#x27;s, began feuding with Guerrero and Vickie, and the men would have numerous confrontations over the following weeks. Benoit defeated Guerrero to retain the WWE United States Championship at Survivor Series on November 26. After weeks of continued interaction, the two faced off in a United States Championship rematch at Armageddon on December 17 that Guerrero lost when he tapped out to a Sharpshooter. Guerrero got yet another rematch the following Friday, losing the match after Vickie hit Benoit with the title belt. Guerrero snapped after the match, knocking over Vickie and attacking Benoit. The feud concluded with Benoit forcing Guerrero to submit in a No Disqualification match.

At No Way Out on February 18, 2007, Guerrero won a Cruiserweight Open Match when he pinned Jimmy Wang Yang, thus winning the Cruiserweight Championship from Gregory Helms. On June 24, Guerrero retained his title against Wang Yang at . At The Great American Bash on July 22, he lost the Cruiserweight Championship to Hornswoggle in another Cruiserweight Open when Hornswoggle pinned Jamie Noble.

Guerrero then turned his attention to Rey Mysterio, whom he had put out of action, in storyline, in 2006. Before Mysterio&#x27;s return at SummerSlam on August 26, Guerrero mocked Mysterio&#x27;s knee injury and taunted him during matches. He was, however, unable to defeat Mysterio at SummerSlam. On the September 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero then lost an &quot;I Quit&quot; rematch to Mysterio, after Mysterio assaulted his left knee with a steel chair. This allowed Guerrero to have time off to serve his suspension for violating the WWE Wellness Policy.

====ECW Champion and La Familia (2007–2009)====
Guerrero remained inactive until the December 18 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, where he appeared after the main event between WWE United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter and ECW Champion CM Punk and attacked the vulnerable Punk, sending a message that he wanted a title shot. Guerrero challenged Punk to several matches until he finally won the third on the January 15, 2008 episode of &quot;ECW&quot; after interference from World Heavyweight Champion Edge to earn a championship match. On the January 22 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Guerrero defeated Punk in a No Disqualification match to win the ECW Championship following interference from Edge. In the process he proclaimed Edge and company as his &quot;familia&quot;. He then successfully defended his title against Punk at No Way Out on February 17 and on March 4 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;.

At WrestleMania XXIV on March 30, Guerrero lost the ECW Championship to Kane in a record eleven seconds. Shortly afterward, Bam Neely debuted to act as his bodyguard. Guerrero lost a rematch against Kane at Backlash on April 27 and also failed to become the number one contender at One Night Stand on June 1. After Edge turned on La Familia, Guerrero returned to singles and tag team action with Neely. He also failed to regain the ECW Championship at Unforgiven on September 7 in a Championship Scramble match, and later against champion Matt Hardy.

Guerrero was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. He then became involved in the feud between Vickie Guerrero and Santino Marella. At Extreme Rules on June 7, 2009, Guerrero and Vickie were defeated by Marella in a Hog Pen match. Upon Vickie&#x27;s departure from WWE, Guerrero continued to feud with Marella and defeated him on the June 18 episode of &quot;WWE Superstars&quot;. Guerrero next feuded with Hornswoggle, where the two faced off in various types of matches (in which a handicap of some sort was imposed on Guerrero by the various celebrity guests left in charge of &quot;Raw&quot; every week) with Hornswoggle gaining the wins. Guerrero finally picked up a win when he teamed with Chris Masters to defeat Hornswoggle and Santino Marella in a tag team match on the September 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

====Final storylines and departure (2010–2011)====
As part of the 2010 WWE Supplemental Draft, Guerrero was drafted back to the SmackDown brand. He started an alliance with Dolph Ziggler, and the duo defeated Christian in a handicap match. On the July 9, 2010 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Guerrero competed in a triple threat Money in the Bank qualifying match, along with Ziggler and MVP. Throughout the match, it became apparent that Vickie Guerrero (Ziggler&#x27;s manager) had told Guerrero and Ziggler to work together to ensure Ziggler qualified for the match. During the match, however, when both MVP and Ziggler were down, Guerrero attempted to pin MVP to win the match himself, turning his back on Vickie and Ziggler, thus ending the alliance.

On March 8, 2011, Guerrero was announced as a NXT Pro to Darren Young for the fifth season of &quot;NXT&quot;. On the May 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown,&quot; Guerrero commentated on a match between Tyson Kidd and Sin Cara, which Sin Cara won. On the May 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown,&quot; Guerrero aided Sin Cara in his match against Daniel Bryan. At Over the Limit on May 22, Sin Cara defeated Guerrero, and again on &quot;SmackDown&quot; to end their feud. Afterward, Guerrero mainly appeared on NXT with Darren Young. His last match in WWE was teaming up with JTG and Young against Yoshi Tatsu, Conor O&#x27;Brian and Vladimir Kozlov on NXT in a losing effort. On June 25, at his request, Guerrero was released by WWE, ending his 10-year tenure there.

===Independent circuit (2011–2021)===

Guerrero appeared for the first time since his WWE departure at World Wrestling Council (WWC)&#x27;s Anniversario event on July 15 and 16, 2011. On July 16, Guerrero defeated El Sensacional Carlitos and Orlando Colón to win the WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship. In December 2011, Guerrero took part in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s India project, Ring Ka King. During the first week of tapings, Guerrero and Bulldog Hart were crowned the promotion&#x27;s inaugural Tag Team Champions. On July 28, 2012, Guerrero appeared at a Vendetta Pro Wrestling event in Lompoc, California, defeating Joey Ryan for the vacant Vendetta Pro Wrestling Heavyweight Championship, holding the title until October 27, 2012 when he lost it to Chris Masters.

On August 2, 2014, Guerrero teamed with his father Chavo Guerrero Sr. at Vendetta Pro Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;Summer Sizzle V – VendettaVersary&quot; event in a &quot;Father &amp; Son vs. Father &amp; Son&quot; Tag Team match against La Familia de Tijuana (Damián 666 and Bestia 666). Los Guerreros picked up the win. Following the match, Damián made a challenge to Guerrero Jr. to a hair-vs-hair match, in which he volunteered to put Bestia&#x27;s hair on the line against the hair of Guerrero Sr. Guerrero Jr. picked up the win, but Bestia fled the arena, claiming later that he never agreed to the stipulation himself. On September 19, 2014, Guerrero made his debut for Chikara, when he, Hernandez and Homicide, representing LAX, took part in the 2014 King of Trios. They were eliminated from the tournament in the first round by the Golden Trio (Dasher Hatfield, Icarus and Mark Angelosetti).

In 2017, Chavo signed with Imperio Lucha Libre to compete in the title tournament for the Imperio Sudamerican Title.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2012–2013)===

On July 18, 2012, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) announced that they had signed Guerrero to a contract. He made his debut on July 26 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, aligning himself with Hernandez and beginning a short feud with Gunner and Kid Kash. Guerrero appeared on August 12 at Hardcore Justice, where he teamed with Hernandez to defeat Gunner and Kash. The two subsequently set their sights on the TNA World Tag Team Championship, unsuccessfully challenging champions Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian) for the titles on September 6 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. Guerrero and Hernandez ultimately defeated Daniels and Kazarian on October 14 at Bound for Glory, in three-way match, also involving A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle to become the new TNA World Tag Team Champions. On January 25, at the tapings of January 31 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Guerrero and Hernandez lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to the Dirty Heels (Austin Aries and Bobby Roode).

Guerrero and Hernandez received their rematch for the titles on March 10 at Lockdown, but were again defeated by Aries and Roode in a three-way match, also involving Daniels and Kazarian. On following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Guerrero and Hernandez were set for another shot at the titles, but the two were ambushed by the Aces &amp; Eights before the match could start. The title match took place the following week, where Guerrero and Hernandez failed again to regain the TNA World Tag Team Championship, following interference from Daniels and Kazarian. On the next episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Guerrero and Hernandez defeated Daniels and Kazarian to earn another shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Guerrero and Hernandez received their title shot on April 11 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, where they defeated Aries and Roode in a Two-out-of-Three Falls match, with the added stipulation that they would have to break up if they lost, to regain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On June 2 at Slammiversary XI, Guerrero and Hernandez lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to Gunner and James Storm in a fatal four-way elimination match, also involving Austin Aries and Bobby Roode and Bad Influence. On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Guerrero was defeated by Hernandez in a 2013 Bound for Glory Series qualifying match. On December 12, Guerrero collected a briefcase in the Feast or Fired match, which was revealed the following week to contain a pink slip meaning he was fired from TNA. Guerrero&#x27;s profile was later removed from the official site, and TNA issued a press release confirming his release as legitimate.

===Lucha Underground (2014–2019)===
In September 2014, it was reported that Guerrero had signed with &quot;Lucha Underground&quot;. Guerrero wrestled in the first match of the debut episode of &quot;Lucha Underground&quot; on October 29, losing to Blue Demon Jr. On November 5 episode, Guerrero used a chair to attack both Blue Demon Jr. and Sexy Star, who was Guerrero&#x27;s tag partner earlier in the episode, turning Heel in the process. On January 7, 2015, episode (taped October 5, 2014), Guerrero participated in a 20-men Aztec Warfare battle royal to become the inaugural Lucha Underground Champion. However, he was attacked by Blue Demon and eliminated by Sexy Star. On January 18, 2015, (aired February 18) Guerrero was defeated by Mil Muertes and left &quot;Lucha Underground&quot;.

On May 20, 2015, Guerrero appeared in a video where he offered his help to Aztec Dragon to save his protegeé, Black Lotus. However, on June 3, Guerrero attacked Lotus, aligned himself with Dario Cueto and The Crew. Guerrero returned to &quot;Lucha Underground&quot; on June 10 (taped March 22, 2015), defeating Blue Demon Jr. 
On January 10, 2016, Guerrero won the vacant Gift of the Gods Championship in a match also involving Aero Star, El Siniestro de la Muerte, Joey Ryan, Sexy Star, Texano, and Willie Mack, though he lost the championship a week later to Cage. On November 3 Guerrero lost to Rey Mysterio in a &quot;loser leaves Lucha Underground&quot; match and per stipulation had to leave the temple.

Guerrero returned in Aztec Warfare 4 on the season 4 premiere, entering at number 17 and making it to the final 3 before being eliminated by Pentagon Dark. During the second part of Ultima Lucha Cuatro, Chavo saved his cousin Shaul Guerrero from being assaulted by Famous B, turning him back into a face.

The series was discontinued after season finale, &quot;Ultima Lucha Cuatro&quot;.

===Nación Lucha Libre (2019–2020)===
In 2019, Guerrero and fellow professional wrestler Alberto El Patron created their own promotion, Nación Lucha Libre. The promotion debuted on July 11 with their first show that featured wrestling from El Patron, El Hijo del Fantasma, L.A. Park, Thunder Rosa, Bestia 666, and Bandido. Three days later their promotion debuted their weekly show on Imagen TV in Mexico. Nación Lucha Libre closed down on January 8, 2020.

=== Return to Impact Wrestling (2019) ===
On September 13, 2019, he made an appearance for TNA, now known as Impact Wrestling at their Operation Override Twitch special. In the match, he defended his World Class Championship against MVP. Due to the disqualification finish, the two had a rematch at the following night&#x27;s Victory Road Impact Plus Monthly Specials.

=== All Elite Wrestling and Ring of Honor (2021–2022) ===
Guerrero made his All Elite Wrestling debut on the July 21, 2021 episode of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, where he was presented as the &quot;executive consultant&quot; for Andrade El Idolo. This was his first appearance on TNT since he lost to the new WCW Cruiserweight Champion Shane Helms in the final episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; on March 26, 2001. However, their partnership was short-lived when El Idolo turned on him on September 11, 2021, after interfering in his match against PAC.

After it, Guerrero took time off to film &quot;Young Rock&quot; in Australia. During this time, he was removed from the roster website.

On April 1, 2022, Guerrero reappeared during AEW&#x27;s future sister promotion Ring of Honor&#x27;s Supercard of Honor XV, at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas, on the card&#x27;s main event as Bandido&#x27;s manager. The match was to determine the Undisputed ROH Champion. Bandido lost the match, in part thanks to Guerrero interfering in the match in two occasions, which did not go well with Bandido.

==Other media==
He has appeared in at least 19 video games, including WCW games (&quot;WCW/nWo Revenge&quot;), and WWE games such as &quot;WWE Survivor Series&quot;, &quot;WWE Smackdown!

===Acting===
Guerrero&#x27;s acting career has consisted of minor roles over the years. In 1996, he appeared in the TV show &quot;Red Shoe Diaries&quot;, in which he played a wrestler.

He played a character named Eddie on the Investigation Discovery series &quot;Detective&quot; in 2017 on episode titled &quot;Warm Revolver&quot;.

He made an appearance as the fictional wrestler James Vazquez also known as El Mayordomo on the NBC TV series &quot;Grimm&quot;&#x27;s fifth-season episode &quot;Silence of the Slams&quot;. The episode aired on March 18, 2016. Also in 2016, Chavo played as a character named &quot;Silas&quot; in &quot;Fight to the Finish&quot;, an action/sport/romance and was directed by Warren Sheppard. He also played a character named &quot;Tex-Mex&quot; in the movie 2016 &quot;Vigilante Diaries&quot;, an action movie.

In 2017 and 2018 Guerrero served as a fight coordinator for the Netflix TV show &quot;GLOW&quot;, training the cast as professional wrestlers. His uncle Mando Guerrero held the same position in the original &quot;GLOW&quot; series that inspired the Netflix show. Guerrero made cameos for two episodes of the second season as the wrestler Chico Guapo.

In 2021 Guerrero began working as Wrestling Coordinator for the NBC TV show &quot;Young Rock.&quot;

In 2023, he landed the role of The Sheik in the film &quot;The Iron Claw&quot; where he also served as consultant.

===Comic books===
Guerrero worked with Lion Forge Studios to create &quot;Chavo Guerrero&#x27;s Warrior&#x27;s Creed&quot; in which he stars as the main character. The first issue was published in June 2016. At least four issues of the comic have been published. The comics were written by author Fabian Nicieza.

==Personal life==
Chavo is the son of Salvador &quot;Chavo&quot; Guerrero and Nancy Vasquez. He married his wife Shari in 1998 and has two sons with her.

On August 30, 2007, Guerrero, along with nine other WWE wrestlers were named by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as having been given illegal steroids not in compliance with the WWE&#x27;s Talent Wellness program. Guerrero received somatropin, nandrolone, and anastrozole between April 2005 and May 2006. Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, and Brian Adams were also discovered to have been given steroids prior to their deaths during this investigation, as well as Sylvain Grenier.

In July 2016, Guerrero and his father were named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.

<text>Jazz Aviation LP, commonly shortened to Jazz, is a Canadian regional airline based at Halifax Stanfield International Airport, in Enfield, Halifax, Nova Scotia, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chorus Aviation. Jazz Aviation provides regional and charter airline services in Canada and the United States, primarily under contract to Air Canada using the brand name Air Canada Express, and also as Jazz Charters.

It is Canada&#x27;s third-largest airline in terms of fleet size but not in terms of passengers carried annually, number of employees, or destinations served. Its Air Canada Express operations serve 79 destinations in Canada and the United States. Under a capacity purchase agreement, Air Canada sets the Jazz route network and flight schedule, and purchases all of Jazz&#x27;s seat capacity based on predetermined rates. Its main base is Halifax Stanfield International Airport, with hubs at Toronto Pearson International Airport, Victoria International Airport, Vancouver International Airport, Montréal–Trudeau International Airport, and Calgary International Airport.

Prior to April 2011, Air Canada&#x27;s regional operations were branded as Air Canada Jazz. Following the award of a contract to Sky Regional Airlines, the Air Canada Express brand was introduced as an umbrella for all regional operations. The Jazz brand is now entirely managed by Jazz Aviation LP.

==History==

===Corporate history===
Air Canada Regional Inc. was established in 2001 from the consolidation of the Air Canada Connector carriers Air BC, Air Nova, Air Ontario, and Canadian Regional Airlines (shortly after the merger between Canadian Airlines and Air Canada). The merger was finalized in 2002 with the creation of a new brand: Air Canada Jazz.

In 2006, ACE Aviation Holdings, the owners of Air Canada, sold off all of its Air Canada Jazz assets. Air Canada Jazz was then an independent company known as Jazz Air Income Fund, which launched an initial public offering in February 2006; units of the income trust traded as JAZ.UN.

On November 15, 2010, the airline was restructured and changed its name to Chorus Aviation, became a public corporation, and traded as &quot;CHR&quot; at the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In 2011, Air Canada announced it would phase out the use of the &quot;Air Canada Jazz&quot; name and livery, and instead brand its regional operations as &quot;Air Canada Express&quot;, with the subtitle &quot;operated by Jazz&quot;.

===Operational history===
In February 2006, Air Canada announced that City Centre Aviation Limited (CCAL) had served a 30-day termination notice for Jazz&#x27;s month-to-month lease of terminal space at Toronto City Centre Airport. The Toronto Port Authority itself does not control any significant terminal space at the airport, but it extended permission for Jazz to continue using the airport; however, since the airline could not find terminal space, they cancelled service to the airport at the end of February 2006. CCAL had been bought by REGCO Holdings, (now Porter Aviation Holdings), the owners of Porter Airlines, which launched service from the airport later that year.

In August 2008, Jazz Aviation removed all life jackets from its aircraft to lower fuel costs. According to the airline, passengers are to use floating seat cushions in the event of an emergency over water. The airline also stated that the probability of a water landing on the regional airline routes was almost zero, as no operation over great bodies of water occurs except for the Great Lakes and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and that in all circumstances, the airline always remains within from land, as stipulated in the law, which removes the obligation from carrying any flotation devices.

==Other ventures==

===Thomas Cook Canada===
In April 2010, Jazz Aviation LP had reached an agreement with Thomas Cook Group to operate a fleet of at least six Boeing 757-200 aircraft during the winter 2010 / 2011 season. The deal with Thomas Cook Group followed the collapse of Canadian airline Skyservice, which previously operated aircraft for Thomas Cook during the winter season. The aircraft, which were leased from British operator Thomas Cook Airlines, were used on flights to destinations in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America. On September 30, 2010, it was announced that the deal had been extended until 2015.

Sunquest charter service to sun destinations operated by Jazz Aviation, doing business as Thomas Cook Canada, began on November 5, 2010. However, on April 13, 2012, Thomas Cook Canada had terminated the remaining three years of the five-year flight services agreement with Jazz, and the service ended on April 30, 2012.

For the 2011 / 2012 season, flights departed from the Canadian airports at Toronto, Halifax, Calgary, and Vancouver. Destinations included Aruba, Nassau, Puerto Plata, Punta Cana, Montego Bay, Cancún, Cozumel, Puerto Vallarta, Los Cabos, and Curaçao.

===PLUNA Líneas Aéreas Uruguayas S.A.===
In April 2010, Jazz Aviation purchased a one-third interest in the Latin American Regional Aviation Holding Corporation (LARAH). In turn, LARAH owns a 75% interest in PLUNA, the Uruguayan flag carrier, while the remaining 25% is owned by the Uruguayan government. PLUNA said on July 6, 2012, that it was &quot;suspending all flights indefinitely&quot; and announced that 720 of the 900 staff would be sent on unemployment pay until a new associate for the company is found or the airline is definitively sold.

==Destinations==
Jazz serves 71 destinations across Canada and the United States.

==Fleet==
The Jazz Aviation fleet listed with Transport Canada (TC) as of January 2025:
Bombardier Aerospace delivered the first of its new regional jet variant, the 75-passenger Bombardier CRJ705 to Jazz Aviation on May 27, 2005. The aircraft was the first of 15 CRJ705 and 15 Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft ordered in September 2004. Originally, the order had been for 30 CRJ705s and 15 CRJ200s but was changed to 15 and 15, subsequently, 15 Embraer 175 aircraft were added to the Air Canada mainline fleet. A 16th CRJ705 was added to replace a CRJ100 which was written off. The new aircraft undertook its first revenue-earning flight on June 1, 2005, from Calgary to Houston. In mid-2006, the last Air Canada CRJ100 was transferred to Jazz.

On February 9, 2010, Jazz Aviation announced that it had finalized an agreement with Bombardier Commercial Aircraft for 15 Q400 NextGen turboprops, with options for an additional 15 aircraft with deliveries to start in May 2011. They were to be configured in a 74-passenger, all-economy layout. The Q400s were used to replace older CRJ100/200 models which were returned to lessor. The Q400s were delivered in the new Air Canada Express paint scheme and were the first aircraft in the Jazz fleet to have the Air Canada Express branding.

On April 26, 2016, Jazz Aviation announced that the remaining CRJ705 aircraft would be converted to CRJ900s.

On January 14, 2019, Chorus Aviation, the parent company of Jazz Aviation, announced an extension to its Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) with Air Canada until 2035. Along with the extension of the CPA, 14 additional CRJ900 aircraft would be acquired, the first five of which would be sourced by Air Canada from SkyWest Airlines.

In 2021, Air Canada Express consolidated all of its regional flying to Jazz and transferred a fleet of Embraer 175 regional jets to the company from Sky Regional Airlines.

In May 2024, Jazz and Expliseat announced that it will be retrofitting 25 Dash 8-400s with TiSeat 2V seats, replacing the NextGen interior.

==Onboard services==
All Jazz flights operating for Air Canada offer a complimentary hot and cold beverage service as well as sweet or savoury snacks, with alcoholic beverages available for purchase.

==Incidents==
*On May 20, 2007, Jazz Aviation flight 8911, operated by a Bombardier CRJ-100 registered C-FRIL, which originated in Moncton, had its main landing gear collapse at Toronto Pearson International Airport while turning from the runway onto the taxiway after an extremely hard landing. There were no injuries. The aircraft was written off and was cancelled from the Canadian Aircraft Register on July 18, 2007.
* On November 6, 2014, a Bombardier Q400 operating as Air Canada Express Flight 8481, originating in Calgary and destined for Grande Prairie, blew a tire upon takeoff. The plane diverted to Edmonton due to high cross winds in Calgary. As the plane landed the right landing gear failed and a propeller blade broke off and impacted the fuselage. Four passengers were injured and taken to hospital, the last being released two days later; all had minor injuries.
* On February 24, 2015, a Dash 8-100 operating Jazz Aviation flight 7795, originating in Toronto and destined for Sault Ste. Marie, struck a runway lead-in light on approach in poor weather conditions and was substantially damaged. No injuries were reported.
*On May 9, 2019, Jazz Aviation Flight 8615, Toronto (CYYZ) to Sudbury (CYSB) was operated by a Dash 8-300 with tail C-FJXZ. The flight departed for Sudbury and diverted back to Toronto due to bad weather in Sudbury. While taxiing back to the gate the plane was struck by a Menzies fuel truck. The left side of the aircraft sustained major damage to the nose cone, left propeller and left rear portion of the aircraft. At the time of the incident, there were five reported injuries cared for and transported by Peel Regional Paramedics to hospital.

<doc id="306828" wikidata="Q1258807" url="?curid=306828" title="Domnus II of Antioch">
<text>Domnus II of Antioch was the Patriarch of Antioch (441 – 449), nephew of John I of Antioch, and friend of the influential Theodoret of Cyrrhus.

== Biography ==
Domnus was ordained deacon by the Patriarch Juvenal of Jerusalem in 429 and remained at the Monastery of St. Euthymius in Palestine for two years. In 431, he left the monastery to aid his uncle, Patriarch John I of Antioch, as part of the Nestorian controversy. Domnus went to Antioch to support proponents of the School of Antioch in favour of Nestorianism against supporters of Patriarch of Alexandria Cyril of Alexandria and his successor Dioscurus I.

In 441, upon the death of his uncle, Domnus was elected successor with support he had acquired in Antioch. In 445, he summoned a synod of Syrian bishops and confirmed the deposition of Athanasius of Perrha. In 447, Domnus II consecrated Irenaeus to the see of Tyre (Theodoret, &quot;Epistle&quot; 110); but emperor Theodosius II, commanded that the appointment should be annulled on the grounds that Irenaeus was both a &quot;digamus&quot; and a supporter of Nestorianism - Iranaeus had formerly been a Roman count and friend of Nestorius at Council of Ephesus, having helped protect him. Morever, Domnus II defended Ibas, bishop of Edessa, against charges of promulgating Nestorian doctrines, and summoned a council at Antioch (448) which decided in favor of Ibas and deposed his accusers. Domnus II&#x27;s sentence, though revoked by Flavian, Patriarch of Constantinople, was confirmed by three episcopal commissioners to whom he and the emperor Theodosius II had committed the matter.

As a result, he was deposed at the Second Council of Ephesus on 8 August 449. Cowed by the authoritarian spirit of Dioscorus of Alexandria, and unnerved by the violence of Barsumas and his monks, Domnus II revoked his former condemnation of Eutyches, and voted for the condemnation of Flavian of Constantinople, but in vain. He was the only bishop then deposed and banished who was not reinstated after the Council of Chalcedon – though this may have been by request so he could retire to his beloved monastery.

At that council Maximus II of Antioch, his successor in the see of Antioch, obtained permission to assign Domnus II a pension from the revenues of the church, and on his recall from exile Domnus II returned to the monastic home of his youth, ending his days in the Monastery of St. Euthymius, where in 452, according to Theophanes the Confessor, he afforded a refuge to Juvenal of Jerusalem when he was driven from his see (Theophanes, p. 92).

<doc id="306829" wikidata="Q1427197" url="?curid=306829" title="Big Bend National Park">
<text>Big Bend National Park is a national park of the United States located in West Texas, bordering Mexico. The park has national significance as the largest protected area of Chihuahuan Desert topography and ecology in the United States, and was named after a large bend in the Rio Grande/Río Bravo. The park protects more than 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds, 56 species of reptiles, and 75 species of mammals. Additional park activities include scenic drives, programs led by Big Bend park rangers, and stargazing.

The area has a rich cultural history, from archeological sites dating back nearly 10,000 years to more recent pioneers, ranchers, and miners. The Chisos Mountains are located in the park, and are the only mountain range in the United States to be fully contained within the boundary of a national park. Geological features in the park include sea fossils and dinosaur bones, as well as volcanic dikes.

The park encompasses an area of , entirely within Brewster County. For more than , the Rio Grande/Río Bravo forms the boundary between Mexico and the United States, and Big Bend National Park administers approximately along that boundary.

Because the Rio Grande serves as an international boundary, the park faces unusual constraints while administering and enforcing park rules, regulations, and policies. In accordance with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the park&#x27;s territory extends only to the center of the deepest river channel as the river flowed in 1848. The rest of the channel and the land south of it lies within Mexican territory. The park is bordered by the protected areas of Cañón de Santa Elena and Maderas del Carmen in Mexico.

==Geography and climate==

The park is in an unincorporated area of Brewster County, Texas.

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Big Bend National Park has a hot arid climate (&quot;BWh&quot;).

The park exhibits dramatic contrasts and its climate may be characterized as one of extremes. Dry and hot late spring and summer days often exceed in the lower elevations. Winters are normally mild but subfreezing temperatures occasionally occur. Because of the range in altitude from about along the river to Emory Peak in the Chisos Mountains at , a wide variation in available moisture and temperature exists throughout the park. These variations contribute to an exceptional diversity in plant and animal habitats. Some species in the park, such as the Chisos oak (&quot;Quercus graciliformis&quot;), are found nowhere else in the United States.

The of river that form the southern park boundary include the spectacular canyons of Santa Elena, Mariscal, and Boquillas. The Rio Grande, which meanders through this portion of the Chihuahuan Desert, has cut deep canyons with nearly vertical walls through three uplifts made primarily of limestone. Throughout the open desert areas, the highly productive Rio Grande riparian zone includes numerous plant and animal species and significant cultural resources. The vegetative belt extends into the desert along creeks and arroyos.

The park&#x27;s Chisos Mountains are sky islands surrounded by desert. A significant part of the park&#x27;s tremendous biodiversity is represented by isolated populations of plants and animals found in the Chisos Mountains and in many of the desert springs distributed across the park.

South of the border lie the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Coahuila and newly protected areas for flora and fauna, which are regions known as the Maderas del Carmen and the Cañón de Santa Elena.



==History==
During the early historic period (before 1535) several Indian groups were recorded as inhabiting the Big Bend. The Chisos Indians were a loosely organized group of nomadic hunters and gatherers who probably practiced limited agriculture on a seasonal basis. The origin of the Chisos Indians is not known. Linguistically, they were associated with the Conchos Indians of northern Chihuahua and northwestern Coahuila. They spoke a member of Uto-Aztecan, a language family whose speakers ranged from central Mexico to the Great Basin of the U.S.

The Jumano was a nomadic group that traveled and traded throughout West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, but some historic records indicate they were enemies of the Chisos. Around the beginning of the 18th century, the Mescalero Apaches began to invade the Big Bend region and displaced the Chisos Indians. One of the last Native American groups to use the Big Bend was the Comanches, who passed through the park along the Comanche Trail on their way to and from periodic raids into the Mexican interior. These raids continued until the mid-19th century. The last of the great military leaders of the native peoples of the region was an Apache of Spanish ancestry named Alzate, who was active as late as the late 1860s.

The European presence in the region begins &quot;circa&quot; 1535 AD with the first Spanish explorations into this portion of North America. The expedition of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca passed near the Big Bend and was followed by other expeditions. Some of these expeditions were searching for gold and silver, or farm and ranch land. Others, such as those by the Franciscan missionaries, were intended to establish centers in which the natives could be evangelized. In an attempt to protect the northern frontier of the New Spain, from which emerged present-day Mexico, a line of &quot;presidios&quot;, or forts, was established along the Rio Grande in the late 18th century. The Presidio de San Vicente was built near present-day San Vicente, Coahuila, and the Presidio de San Carlos was built near present-day Manuel Benavides, Chihuahua. Some of the presidios were soon abandoned, because of financial difficulties and because they could not effectively stop Indian intrusions into Mexico. The soldiers and settlers of these presidios moved to newer presidios where the interests of the Spanish Empire were more defensible. Such was the case of Santa Rosa Maria del Sacramento, now Muzquiz, Coahuila.

Very little study has been made of the Spanish occupation of the Big Bend following the abandonment of the presidios. In 1805, a Spanish settlement called Altares existed south of the Rio Grande. The region became a part of Mexico when it achieved its independence from Spain in 1821. Mexican families lived in the area when English-speaking settlers began arriving following the secession of Texas during the latter half of the 19th century.

Following the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848, the U.S. Army made military surveys of the uncharted land of the Big Bend. Forts and outposts were established across Trans-Pecos Texas to protect migrating settlers from Indian attacks. A significant proportion of the soldiers in the late 1800s were African American and came to be called the &quot;buffalo soldiers&quot;, a name that was apparently given to them by the Native Americans. Lieutenant Henry Flipper, the first American of African ancestry to graduate from West Point, served in Shafter, Texas, near the end of the 19th century. (Shafter, named for General William R. Shafter, lies west of the Big Bend along the highway from Presidio to Marfa.) Ranchers began to settle in the Big Bend about 1880, and by 1900, sheep, goat, and cattle ranches occupied most of the area. The delicate desert environment was soon overgrazed.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, valuable mineral deposits were discovered and brought by settlers who worked in the mines or supported the mines by farming or by cutting timber for the mines and smelters. Communities sprang up around the mines. Boquillas and Terlingua both resulted from mining operations. During this period, the Rio Grande flood plain was settled by farmers. Settlements developed with names like Terlingua Abajo, San Vicente, La Coyota, and Castolon. Often, no more than clusters of families were living and farming in the same area, and they were successful only to the degree that the land was able to support them.

In May 1916, a raid on Glenn Springs received national attention, motivating President Wilson to issued orders for the mobilization of the Texas National Guard to aid federal forces along the border. A permanent cavalry camp was established at Glenn Springs in 1916 and remained until 1920, when the border situation improved.

===Establishing a park===
In the 1930s, many people who loved the Big Bend country saw that it was a land of unique contrast and beauty that was worth preserving for future generations. In 1933, the Texas Legislature passed legislation to establish Texas Canyons State Park. Later that year, the park was redesignated Big Bend State Park. In 1935, the United States Congress passed legislation that would enable the acquisition of the land for a national park. The State of Texas deeded the land that it had acquired to the federal government, and on June 12, 1944, Big Bend National Park became a reality. The park opened to visitors on July 1, 1944.

Big Bend remains one of the largest, most remote, and one of the least-visited national parks in the contiguous United States. In the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019, an average of 377,154 visitors entered the park annually.

==Geology==

The oldest recorded tectonic activity in the park is related to the Paleozoic Marathon orogeny, although Proterozoic events (over 550 Mya) possibly have some deep control. The Marathon orogeny (part of the Ouachita-Marathon-Sonora orogenic belt) is part of thrusting of rocks from the South American Plate over the North American Plate. This can be best seen in the Persimmon Gap area of the park. This orogenic event is linked to the lack of Triassic- and Jurassic-age rocks in the park.

Between the Triassic and the Cretaceous, the South American Plate rifted from the North American Plate, resulting in the deposition of the Glen Rose Limestone, Del Carmen Limestone, Sue Peaks Formation, Santa Elena Limestone, Del Rio Clay, Buda Limestone, and Boquillas formations (preserved in the Sierra del Carmen–Santiago Mountains, Nine Point Mesa, Mariscal Mountain, and Mesa de Anguila areas). Also during this time, the Chihuahua trough formed as the Gulf of Mexico opened, which resulted in east–west striking normal faulting. As a result of this depositional time, dinosaur, forest and other fossils are preserved in the park.

Following the ending of rifting in the Late Cretaceous to the early Cenozoic, the Big Bend area was subjected to the Laramide orogeny. This period of (now east–west) compression caused the northeast-facing Mesa de Anguila (an uplifted monocline on the park&#x27;s southwest margin), the southwest-facing Sierra del Carmen–Santiago Mountains (an uplifted and thrust-faulted monocline that forms the park&#x27;s boundary on the east) and the Tornillo Basin. During the middle Cenozoic, most of the volcanic rocks, including the Chisos Group, the Pine Canyon caldera complex, and the Burro Mesa Formation, formed.

The most recent tectonic activity in the park is basin and range faulting from the Neogene to Quaternary. This period of east–west extension has resulted in Estufa and Dehalo bolsons in the Chisos Mountains, as well as the Terlingua and Sierra del Carmen, Chalk Draw, and Burro Mesa Faults. The Rio Grande has entered the Big Bend area roughly 2 million years ago, and since then, extensive erosion and downcutting have occurred.

==Cultural resources==
Cultural resources in the park range from the Paleo-Indian period 10,500 years ago through the historic period represented by Native American groups, such as the Chisos, Mescaleros, and Comanche. More recently, Spanish, Mexican, Anglo, and Irish settlers farmed, ranched, and mined in the area.

Throughout the prehistoric period, humans found shelter and maintained open campsites throughout the park. The archeological record reveals an Archaic-period desert culture, whose inhabitants developed a nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle that remained virtually unchanged for several thousand years.

The historic cultural landscape centers upon various subsistence or commercial land use. The riparian and tributary environments were used for subsistence and irrigation farming. Transportation networks, irrigation structures, simple domestic residences and outbuildings, and planed and terraced farmland lining the stream banks characterize these landscapes.

==Flora and fauna==
Despite its harsh desert environment, Big Bend has more than 1,200 species of plants (including 60 cactus species), over 600 species of vertebrates, and about 3,600 insect species. The variety of life is largely due to the diverse ecology and changes in elevation between the dry, hot desert, the cool mountains, and the fertile river valley.

===Plants===

The variety of cactus and other plant life add color to the Big Bend region. Cactus in the park include prickly pear (&quot;Opuntia&quot; spp.), claretcup (&quot;Echinocereus coccineus&quot;), and pitaya (&quot;E. enneacanthus&quot;). In the spring, the wildflowers are in full bloom and the yucca flowers display bright colors. Bluebonnets (&quot;Lupinus&quot; spp.) are prevalent in Big Bend, and white and pink bluebonnets are sometimes visible by the road. Other flowering plants such as the desert marigold (&quot;Baileya multiradiata&quot;), desert willow (&quot;Chilopsis linearis&quot;), ocotillo (&quot;Fouquieria splendens&quot;), rock nettle (&quot;Eucnide urens&quot;), and lechuguilla (&quot;Agave lechuguilla&quot;) abound in Big Bend.

Of particular importance to the region was the candelilla plant (&quot;Euphorbia antisyphilitica&quot;). This was used to create candelilla wax, and was the motivation for wax camps within the area of Big Bend National Park such as Glenn Springs, Texas.

===Animals===

Most of the animals are not visible in the day, particularly in the desert. The park comes alive at night, with many of the animals foraging for food. About 150 cougar (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) sightings are reported per year, despite the fact that only two dozen cougars live in the park. Other species that inhabit the park include coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys&quot; spp.), greater roadrunner (&quot;Geococcyx californianus&quot;), golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), gray fox (&quot;Urocyon cinereoargenteus&quot;), collared peccary (&quot;Dicotyles tajacu&quot;), and black-tailed jackrabbit (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;). Mexican black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus eremicus&quot;) are also present in the mountain areas.

Plans to reintroduce the Mexican wolf (&quot;Canis lupus baileyi&quot;) to Big Bend National Park were rejected in the late 1980s by the state of Texas. Disagreement over the reintroduction included the question of whether the park contained enough prey animals, such as deer and javelinas, to sustain a wolf population.

====Birds====
More than 450 species of birds have been recorded at Big Bend NP.

Eight basic land-cover types occur at the park. In order of predominance, they are desert shrubland, igneous grassland, limestone grassland, riparian vegetation, montane woodland, bare ground, developed areas, and surface water.

Birders flock to the park, as it is home to the only area in the United States within the breeding range of the Colima warbler (&quot;Leiothlypis crissalis&quot;). The colima warbler arrives in the Chisos Mountains in mid-April to summer in the high canyons of the mountains. By mid-September, it returns to its wintering grounds in southwestern Mexico. The species is a ground nester and prefers the oak-maple habitat found in Boot Canyon and similar high, cool areas from Laguna Meadow to Boot Canyon and the South Rim. The first U.S. record of the northern tufted flycatcher (&quot;Mitrephanes phaeocercus&quot;), a Central American species, was from this site in November 1991.

== Fossils ==

=== The History of Paleontology at Big Bend National Park ===
Paleontologists began working at Big Bend National Park site as early as 1907, with the discovery of sharks and ammonite fossils by Johan Udden. Then, from 1938 to 1939, a handful of men worked at three fossil quarries in Big Bend as part of a W.P.A. project. Other fossil hunters, including Barnum Brown and Roland &quot;R.T.&quot; Bird, arrived in search of dinosaur remains in 1940. Among other discoveries, Brown and Bird uncovered neck vertebrae of a giant sauropod, &quot;Alamosaurus,&quot; as well as partial jawbones of a crocodylian species, &quot;Deinosuchus&quot;. 

The first museum built to display fossils at the park burned down in 1941, mammoth teeth and saber tooth cat fossils were lost in the blaze. A new exhibit of fossil bones opened in 1957, and displayed fossils of &quot;Hyracotherium&quot;, a horse ancestor, and &quot;Coryphodon&quot;, a large hippo-like animal that lived during the Eocene, about 55 million years ago (mya). In 1990, the fossils were replaced with replicas, but the museum was overhauled in the 2000s - a redesigned Fossil Discovery Exhibit opened in 2017. Today, citizens need permits to legally collect fossils in Big Bend National Park.

=== Fossils by Ecosystem and Time Period ===

==== Big Bend Underwater ====
135 mya, Big Bend was underwater. Fossils from this time period include sharks, marine reptiles such as plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, plankton and foraminifera microfossils - as well as the remains of larger mollusks. Fossils from 85–82 mya show that Big Bend was covered by warm waters frequented by sharks, small mosasaurs, and fish such as &quot;Xiphactinus&quot;. Spiral-shelled ammonites and invertebrates of the marine shelf are also common.

==== Big Bend Delta ====
When water levels fell 83-72 mya, the area that is now Big Bend became a complex mosaic of deltas, populated by 
fish and sharks, big turtles, and crocodylian. There is also evidence of terrestrial species such as herds of hadrosaurs, horned ceratopsids, armored nodosaurs, and tyrannosauroids. 

==== The Javelina Formation (72–67 mya) ====
Big Bend was, at this time, well above sea level. Some of its animals include early carnivorous mammals, hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, tyrannosauroids, and the largest known pterosaur, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;. Its waterways were filled with fish, rays, and amphibians.

==== Black Peaks Formation (67–66 mya) ====
In geological strata marking the end of the Cretaceous, the remains of flowering plants, conifers, gar, rays, as well as the bones of &quot;Alamosaurus&quot; have been found. The 
Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event occurred around 66 mya, wiping out seventy percent of life on land, including all non-bird dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and 90 percent of ocean life. 


The park has several hot springs, including the springs in the Hot Springs Historic District. The main hot spring is called Hot Springs; it is also known as Bocadillas Hot Springs and Langford Hot Springs. Hot Springs is on the National Register of Historic Places. The hot springs were the first major tourist attraction in the Big Bend area before the national park was established. In 1909, J.O. Langford began developing the springs. There was a small stone soaking tub of local stone from the time before Langford&#x27;s development was excavated at the site. A dugout shelter existed at the site that the Langford family renovated as a residence. The Langfords then constructed an adobe house, a stone bathhouse, and bathing shelters made of brushwood. Later in 1927 they rebuilt the bathhouse and built a store and a motor court with seven attached cabins.

==Tourism==


Big Bend&#x27;s primary attraction is its hiking and backpacking trails. Particularly notable among these are the Chimneys Trail, which visits a rock formation in the desert; the Marufo Vega trail, a loop trail that passes through scenic canyons on the way to and from the Rio Grande; the South Rim trail which circles the high mountains of the Chisos; and the Outer Mountain Loop trail in the Chisos, which incorporates parts of the South Rim loop, descends into the desert along the Dodson Trail, and then returns to the Chisos Basin, completing a 30-mile loop. Other notable locations include Santa Elena Canyon, Grapevine Hills, and the Mule Ears, two imposing rock towers in the middle of the desert. Professional backpacking guide services provide trips in the park.

The park administers of the Rio Grande for recreational use. Professional river outfitters provide tours of the river. Use of a personal boat is permitted, but a free river float permit is required. In June 2009, the Department of Homeland Security began treating all float trips as trips that had left the country and required participants to have an acceptable form of identification such as a passport to re-enter the country.

Visitors often cross the Rio Grande to visit the Mexican village of Boquillas. The Department of Homeland Security closed the border crossing in 2002 due to increased security following the September 11 attacks, but in April 2013, the Boquillas crossing reopened as an official Class B Port of Entry between the U.S. and Mexico. It is open Wednesday through Sunday between 9 am and 6 pm.

With more than 450 species of birds recorded in the park, a widely popular activity is birdwatching. Many species stop in the park during their annual migrations.

Five paved roads are in Big Bend. Persimmon Gap to Panther Junction is a road from the north entrance of the park to park headquarters at Panther Junction. Panther Junction to Rio Grande Village is a road that descends from the park headquarters to the Rio Grande. Maverick Entrance Station to Panther Junction is a route from the western entrance of the park to the park headquarters. Chisos Basin Road is long and climbs to above sea level at Panther Pass before descending into the Chisos Basin. The Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive leads to the Castolon Historic District and Santa Elena Canyon.

=== International dark-sky park ===

In 2012, the park was designated an international dark-sky park by the International Dark-Sky Association. The association also recognized the park with its Gold Tier designation as &quot;free from all but the most minor impacts of light pollution.&quot; Measurements made by the National Park Service show that Big Bend has the darkest skies in the contiguous United States. Thousands of stars, bright planets, and the Milky Way are visible on clear nights.
==Education==
San Vicente Independent School District is based on the park grounds. San Vicente ISD&#x27;s facility moved to the Panther Junction area circa 1951 so children of park employees had a local school. Much of the park is in San Vicente ISD while other parts are physically in Terlingua Common School District. High school aged students from San Vicente ISD attend high school at Big Bend High School of Terlingua CSD.

Prior to 1996 Alpine High School of the Alpine Independent School District served as the high school for students from Terlingua CSD, and also for students of San Vicente ISD. The high school opened in 1996. San Vicente began sending students to Big Bend High when it was established in 1996.

<text>Henry Wharton Conway (March 18, 1793 – November 9, 1827) was a United States naval officer during the War of 1812 and a politician in Arkansas Territory, who was elected as a territorial delegate (1823–1827) to the United States House of Representatives for three consecutive congresses. He died in 1827 as a result of wounds from a duel with Robert Crittenden, a former friend and political ally.

==Biography==
Conway was born into a planter family on March 18, 1793, as the son of Thomas and Ann ( Rector) Conway, in Greene County, Tennessee. He was educated by private tutors. He had two younger brothers who followed him into politics in the West.

==Career==
During the War of 1812, Conway was commissioned as an Ensign in the United States Navy, and was promoted to Lieutenant in 1813. In 1817, Conway became a clerk in the U.S. Treasury. Having saved money for his journey, the following year he joined the migration West to the Missouri Territory. In 1820, he moved to the Arkansas Territory. There he became active in territorial politics, forming a friendship and an alliance with Robert Crittenden. His younger brothers James S. and Elias N. Conway also later became politicians in Arkansas after it became a state in 1836; they served as first and fifth governors of the state, respectively. In Arkansas Territory, he was appointed as receiver of public moneys, serving from 1820 through 1821.

Conway was elected in 1822 as a territorial delegate to the Eighteenth Congress and was re-elected to the Nineteenth, and Twentieth Congresses, serving in total from March 4, 1823 until his death. Following political differences in 1825, Conway and Crittenden grew apart, publicizing their feud in newspapers.

==Death and legacy==
The conflict between Conway and Crittenden resulted in a duel held on October 29, 1827, near Napoleon. Conway was mortally wounded and died several days later on November 9, 1827. He is interred at Scull Cemetery, Arkansas Post, Arkansas.

Conway County, Arkansas, is named after him.

<text>Ambrose Hundley Sevier (November 4, 1801 – December 31, 1848) was an attorney, politician and planter from Arkansas. A member of the political Conway-Johnson family that dominated the state and national delegations in the antebellum years, he was elected by the legislature as a Democratic U.S. Senator. He served as Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives.

==Early life and education==
Ambrose Hundley Sevier was born near Greeneville, Tennessee in Greene County, Tennessee. Sevier moved to Missouri in 1820 and to Little Rock, Arkansas in 1821. In Arkansas he became clerk of the Territorial House of Representatives. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1823.

==Marriage and family==
Sevier married Juliette Johnson, the sister of Robert Ward Johnson, who also became an influential politician in the state. Their father Benjamin Johnson had gone to Arkansas as the first territorial judge; in 1836 he was appointed as the first federal district judge when the territory became a state. Ambrose and Juliette had several children.

==Political career==
Sevier was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives and served from 1823 to 1827; he was elected as Speaker of that body in 1827.

He was elected as a Jacksonian Delegate to the 20th US Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Henry Wharton Conway, killed as a result of a duel with a former friend. Sevier was reelected and served as delegate in three successive congresses from 1828 to 1836, when Arkansas was admitted to the Union. Sevier is known as the &quot;Father of Arkansas Statehood&quot;.

In 1836 Sevier was elected as the first member of the United States Senate from Arkansas. He was reelected in 1837 and 1843. He resigned from office in 1848. During the 29th Congress, he was allowed to hold the seat of President &quot;pro tem&quot; of the Senate for a day, though he was not elected to that post. During his tenure, he served as chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs and was a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations.

In 1848 Sevier and Nathan Clifford, the Attorney General of the United States, were appointed ambassadors to Mexico by President James K. Polk to negotiate the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo at the end of the Mexican–American War.

After completing this project, Ambrose Hundley Sevier died the last day of that year on his plantation in Pulaski County, Arkansas. He was buried in the historic Mount Holly Cemetery. The State of Arkansas erected a monument in the cemetery in his honor.

Sevier was part of the powerful &quot;Family&quot; of Democratic politicians in Arkansas, who included his first cousins: Representative Henry Wharton Conway, Governor James Sevier Conway, and Governor Elias Nelson Conway; brother-in-law Senator Robert Ward Johnson, and son-in-law Governor Thomas James Churchill.

<text>The Natchez Trace, also known as the Old Natchez Trace, is a historic forest trail within the United States which extends roughly from Nashville, Tennessee, to Natchez, Mississippi, linking the Cumberland, Tennessee, and Mississippi rivers.

Native Americans created and used the trail for centuries. Early European and American explorers, traders, and immigrants used it in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. European Americans founded inns, also known as &quot;stands&quot;, along the Trace to serve food and lodging to travelers. Most of these stands closed as travel shifted to steamboats on the Mississippi and other rivers. The heyday of the Trace began in the 1770s and ended in the 1820s, by the 1830s the route was already in disrepair and its time as a major interregional commercial route had come to an end.

Today, the path is commemorated by the Natchez Trace Parkway, which follows the approximate path of the Trace, as well as the related Natchez Trace Trail. Parts of the original trail are still accessible, and some segments are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Origins==
Largely following a geologic ridge line, prehistoric animals followed the dry ground of the Trace to distant grazing lands, the salt licks of today&#x27;s Middle Tennessee, and to the Mississippi River. Native Americans used many early footpaths created by the foraging of bison, deer, and other large game that could break paths through the dense undergrowth. In the case of the Trace, bison traveled north to find salt licks in the Nashville area.

After Native Americans began to settle the land, they blazed the trail and improved it further until it became a relatively well-established path. Numerous prehistoric indigenous settlements in Mississippi were established along the Natchez Trace. Among them were the 2,000-year-old Pharr Mounds of the Middle Woodland period, located near present-day Tupelo, Mississippi.

The first recorded European explorer to travel the Trace in its entirety was an unnamed Frenchman in 1742, who wrote of the trail and its &quot;miserable conditions&quot;. Early European explorers depended on the assistance of Native American guides to go through this territory — specifically, the Choctaw and Chickasaw who occupied the region. These tribes and earlier prehistoric peoples, collectively known as the Mississippian culture, had long used the Trace for trade. The Chickasaw leader, Chief Piomingo, made use of the trail so often that it became known as Piominko&#x27;s Path during his lifetime. Another early common name was Trail to the Chickasaw Nation.

==Development==


Even before the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, President Thomas Jefferson wanted to connect the distant Mississippi frontier to other settled areas of the United States. To foster communication with what was then called the Southwest, he directed the construction of a postal road between Daniel Boone&#x27;s Wilderness Road (the southern branch of the road ended at Nashville) and the Mississippi River.

The U.S. signed treaties with the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes to maintain peace as European Americans entered the area in greater numbers. In 1801, the United States Army began trailblazing along the Trace, performing major work to prepare it as a thoroughfare. The work was done by soldiers reassigned from Tennessee and later by civilian contractors. Jefferson called it the &quot;Columbian Highway&quot; to emphasize American sovereignty in the area. The people who used it, however, dubbed the road &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Backbone&quot; due to its remoteness, rough conditions, and the frequently encountered highwaymen found along the new road. Aaron Burr wrote to his daughter, that the &quot;&#x27;road...you will see laid down...on the map...as having been cut by the order of the minister of war[,]...is imaginary; there is no such road.&#x27; The region between Washington, Mississippi, and the Choctaw domain was, Burr reported, &#x27;a vile country, destitute of springs or of running water—think of drinking the nasty puddle water, covered with green scum, and full of animaculae—bah! … [H]ow glad I was to get [into the high country,] all fine, transparent, lively streams, and itself [the Tennessee] a clear, beautiful, magnificent river.&#x27;&quot;

By 1809, the trail was fully navigable by wagon, with the northward journey taking two to three weeks. Critical to the success of the Trace as a trade route was the development of inns and trading posts, referred to at the time as &quot;stands&quot;.

Many early migrants in Tennessee and Mississippi settled along the Natchez Trace. Some of the most prominent were Washington, Mississippi (the old capital of Mississippi); &quot;Old&quot; Greenville, Mississippi (where Andrew Jackson married Rachel Jackson in 1791); and Port Gibson, Mississippi. The Natchez Trace was used during the War of 1812 and the ensuing Creek War, as soldiers under Major General Andrew Jackson&#x27;s command traveled southward to subdue the Red Sticks and to defend the country against invasion by the British. Jackson most likely knew the road well from his career as an interstate slave trader operating between Natchez and Nashville beginning in 1789.

By 1817, the continued development of Memphis (with its access to the Mississippi River) and Jackson&#x27;s Military Road (heading south from Nashville) formed more direct and faster routes to New Orleans. Trade shifted to either of these routes along the east or west of the area, away from the Trace. As author William C. Davis wrote in his book &quot;A Way Through the Wilderness&quot; (1995), the Trace was &quot;a victim of its own success&quot; by encouraging development in the frontier area.

With the rise of steamboat culture on the Mississippi River after the invention of the steam engine, the Trace lost its importance as a national road, as goods could be moved more quickly, cheaply, and in greater quantity on the river. Before the invention of steam power, the Mississippi River&#x27;s south-flowing current was so strong that northbound return journeys generally had to be made over land.

Although many authors have written that the Trace disappeared back into the woods, much of it was used by people living nearby. Large sections of the Trace in Tennessee were converted to county roads for operation, and sections continue to be used today.

==Early 19th century==
Though the Natchez Trace was briefly used as a major United States route, it served an essential function for years. The Trace was the only reliable land link between the eastern states and the trading ports of Mississippi and Louisiana. All sorts of people traveled down the Trace: itinerant preachers, highwaymen, traders, and peddlers among them.

As part of the &quot;Great Awakening&quot; movement that swept the country in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the &quot;spiritual development&quot; along the Trace started from the Natchez end and moved northward. Several Methodist preachers began working a circuit along the Trace as early as 1800. By 1812 they claimed a membership of 1,067 white Americans and 267 African Americans. The Methodists were soon joined in Natchez by other Protestant denominations, including Baptist missionaries and Presbyterians.

The latter accompanied the migration of Scots-Irish and Scots into the frontier areas. Presbyterians and their frontier offshoot, the Cumberland Presbyterians, were the most active of the three denominations in this country. They claimed converts among Native Americans. The Presbyterians started working from the south; the Cumberland Presbyterians worked from the north, as they had migrated to Tennessee from Kentucky.

As with the much-unsettled frontier, banditry regularly occurred along the Trace. Much of it centered around the river landing Natchez Under-The-Hill, as compared with the rest of the town atop the river bluff. Under-the-Hill, where barges and keelboats put in with goods from northern ports, was a hotbed of gamblers, prostitutes, and drunken crew from the boats. Many of the rowdies, referred to as &quot;Kaintucks&quot;, were rough Kentucky frontiersmen who operated flatboats down the river. They delivered goods to Natchez in exchange for cash and sought gambling contests in Natchez Under-the-Hill. They walked or rode horseback the 450 miles back up the Trace to Nashville. In 1810, an estimated 10,000 &quot;Kaintucks&quot; used the Trace annually to return to the north to start another river journey.

Other dangers lurked on the Trace in the areas outside city boundaries. Highwaymen (such as John Murrell and Samuel Mason) terrorized travelers along the road. They operated large gangs of organized brigands in one of the first examples of land-based organized crime in the United States.

==Stands along the trace==


The inns, or stands, as they were called along the Natchez Trace, provided lodging for travelers from the 1790s to the 1840s. These stands furnished food and accommodations and contributed to the spread of news, information, and new ideas. The food was basic: corn in the form of hominy was a staple, and bacon, biscuits, coffee with sugar, and whiskey were served. Lodging was normally on the floor; beds were available only to a few due to many travelers and cramped conditions. Some travelers chose to sleep outdoors or on the porches.

==Death of Meriwether Lewis==

Meriwether Lewis, of the Lewis and Clark Expedition fame, died while traveling on the Trace. Then serving as appointed governor of the Louisiana Territory, he was on his way to Washington, D.C., from his base in St. Louis, Missouri. Lewis stopped at Grinder&#x27;s Stand (near current-day Hohenwald, Tennessee) for overnight shelter in October 1809. He was distraught over many issues, possibly affected by his use of opium. He was believed by many to have committed suicide there with a gun.

Some uncertainty persists as to whether it was suicide. His mother believed he had been murdered, and rumors circulated about possible killers. Thomas Jefferson and Lewis&#x27;s former partner, William Clark, accepted the report of suicide. Lewis was buried near the inn along the Trace. In 1848, a Tennessee state commission erected a monument at the site.

On the bicentennial of Lewis&#x27;s death (2009), the first national public memorial service honoring his life was held; it was also the last event of the Lewis and Clark Expedition Bicentennial.

<doc id="306850" wikidata="Q192550" url="?curid=306850" title="El Dorado">
<text>El Dorado (, ) is a mythical city of gold supposedly located somewhere in South America. The king of this city was said to be so rich that he would cover himself from head to foot in gold dust – either daily or on certain ceremonial occasions – before diving into a sacred lake to wash it off. The legend was first recorded in the 16th century by Spanish colonists in America; they referred to the king as El Dorado, &#x27;The Golden One&#x27;, a name which eventually came to be applied to the city itself.

It is unknown whether this story had any basis in fact, but it may have been inspired by the culture of the Muisca, an Indigenous people inhabiting a plateau in the Andean mountains in modern-day Colombia. The Muisca were skilled goldsmiths; they made frequent use of golden objects in their religious ceremonies, and also manufactured ornaments and jewellery for trade with the neighbouring tribes. Early European settlers, searching for the source of the gold they found among the lowland peoples, made several attempts to reach the plateau. The first to succeed was Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada in 1537. Quesada and his men conquered the territory of the Muisca in the name of Spain, and looted large quantities of gold from their palaces and temples.

It was shortly after this that the legend of El Dorado began to spread among the European colonists. In the decades that followed, the city was sought for in various places across the continent. Antonio de Berrio, Quesada&#x27;s heir, believed that El Dorado lay within the Guianas, and tried on three occasions to forge a path into the uncharted highlands. Before he could make a third attempt, he was taken captive by Walter Raleigh, who then launched his own expedition into the Guianas.

Raleigh likewise failed to reach his goal, but a later survey by his lieutenant, Lawrence Kemys, brought back some local information regarding a great lake called Lake Parime that supposedly lay somewhere further inland. This lake, considered a prime candidate for the location of the golden city, became the object of further searches, and was included in maps throughout the 17th century. Over time, as the area became better charted, the existence of the lake was thrown into doubt. In the early 19th century, Alexander von Humboldt conclusively declared Lake Parime to be a myth, bringing an end to the popular belief in El Dorado.

Nevertheless, the subject has had a lasting cultural impact. The mystery surrounding the lost city, and the supposed wealth of its inhabitants, have influenced creative media since the time of Voltaire, who included a trip to El Dorado in his 18th-century satire &quot;Candide&quot;. More recently, the search for El Dorado has furnished plotlines for films and video games such as &quot;Outer Banks&quot;, &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot;, &quot;Paddington in Peru&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, and has provided a motif for numerous musical artists, including Aterciopelados and Shakira.

==Background==
Christopher Columbus, the first known European to reach the Americas after the Scandinavians, made landfall in the Caribbean islands in 1492. On seeing the golden ornaments worn by some of the native inhabitants, he assumed that he had discovered a prosperous country, and spent several months travelling from island to island, searching for the source of the gold. Although he found no mines, he was unshaken in his conviction that these new lands held great wealth. He promised the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, who were sponsoring the expedition, that with a little assistance he could &quot;give them as much gold as they have need of&quot;.

Columbus would have been aware of a number of European legends that told of wealthy utopias located in the western hemisphere. The ancient Greeks believed that somewhere in the Atlantic lay the Isles of the Blessed, an earthly paradise with a permanently temperate climate. According to the 2nd-century author Lucian, the inhabitants of these Isles dwelt in cities made of gold, ivory and emeralds. The Atlantic also gave its name to the mythical continent of Atlantis, which was said to be home to an advanced civilization rich in gold, silver and orichalcum. During the Middle Ages, stories were told of the Isle of Seven Cities, a supposed Christian haven which frequently appeared on 15th-century maps, and which may have inspired the later legend of the Seven Cities of Gold. Columbus also had an interest in finding the location of two regions mentioned in the Bible, Ophir and Tarshish, from whence King Solomon was said to have imported vast quantities of treasure. Columbus believed that not only these two countries but also the Garden of Eden were to be found somewhere on the newly discovered continent, and many of those who followed him shared the same beliefs.

The early settlers in the Caribbean islands, however, found their expectations disappointed. The natives possessed a small amount of gold but did not mine it systematically, and the Spaniards&#x27; own mining activities quickly exhausted the local supply. The settlers&#x27; attention therefore turned towards the mainland, and colonies began to be established along the American coast. Despite this unpromising beginning, the conquest of the Aztecs by Hernán Cortés and the conquest of the Incas by Francisco Pizarro soon rekindled European hopes that vast gold deposits still remained to be uncovered.

==Origin of the legend==
===Rumours of gold===
The first European incursion into Venezuela was made by Ambrosius Dalfinger, governor of the Spanish settlement of Coro. Dalfinger was an employee of the Welser banking family, a German firm to whom Charles V of Spain had granted, as security for a loan, the governorship of Venezuela and a licence to explore the country. One of the Welsers&#x27; principal concerns was to find a passage through the continent to the Pacific Ocean (then known as the South Sea); such a passage, if found, would open up a new route to India and give Spain an edge in the spice trade. 

It was to this end that in August 1529, Dalfinger set out with an expeditionary force to Lake Maracaibo. The Europeans drastically underestimated the breadth of the South American landmass, and it seemed possible that this lake would prove to connect with the Pacific. During the course of their nine-month journey, they looted numerous golden trinkets from the local population, and were told that these had been acquired through trade with a certain tribe high up in the mountains. Upon his return to Coro, Dalfinger found that in his absence he had been presumed dead; the Welser had sent along a replacement governor, Hans Seissenhofer, who had named Nikolaus Federmann as deputy. Dalfinger now resumed the governorship, but temporarily left Federmann in charge while he recovered from an illness.

Federmann, taking advantage of his new authority, soon launched his own expedition into the interior. Placating the indigenous tribes with gifts of beads and iron tools, and searching for information about the South Sea, he was told that the countries bordering this sea were rich in gold, pearls, and gemstones. Enquiring further, Federmann&#x27;s party were directed to a hilltop from which they could see what appeared to be a large body of water. This was in fact the &quot;llanos&quot;, a grassland plain which is subject to periodic floods. Having failed to find a route to the Pacific, and faced with difficult terrain, mass illness, and increasingly hostile natives, Federmann was forced to return to Coro empty-handed.

Dalfinger banished Federmann from Venezuela for four years as punishment for abandoning his post. Dalfinger then ventured inland once again in June 1531, travelling south-west to the banks of the river Cesar. Here, he heard of a mountain province called &quot;Xerira&quot;, which was said to be the source of all the golden artefacts found amongst the lowland peoples. This was probably a reference to Jerira, located at the northernmost extreme of the Muisca plateau. Dalfinger also heard that the tribe which made the golden objects also exported large quantities of salt. Armed with this clue, he led his party south to the trading centre of Tamalameque, then followed the salt trail into the highlands. At a height of 8,000 feet, waging war against the natives in freezing temperatures, they realised they could go no further south and turned back towards Coro. Dalfinger died on the return journey after being shot with a poisoned arrow.

Meanwhile, another group of &quot;conquistadors&quot;, led by Diego de Ordaz, were searching for the source of the Orinoco River. Sailing inland from the east, rowing hard against the current, they eventually reached the confluence of the Orinoco and the Meta. They attempted to continue south along the Orinoco, but soon ran into impassible rapids. Returning downriver, they were attacked by Caribs; Ordaz&#x27;s men routed their attackers and captured two. One of the prisoners, being asked if he knew of any gold in the vicinity, told the Spaniards that if they followed the westward course of the Meta River they would find a kingdom ruled by &quot;a very valiant one-eyed Indian&quot;, and that if they found him &quot;they could fill their boats with that metal&quot;. Ordaz attempted to follow this advice immediately, but it was now the dry season and the river level was dropping rapidly. Finally admitting defeat, Ordaz sailed for Spain to make preparations for a second expedition, but died of an illness at sea. Before long, &quot;Meta&quot; would become the general name for the legendary golden kingdom.

In 1534, Sebastián de Belalcázar, one of Pizarro&#x27;s lieutenants, conquered the Incan city of Quito, where he expected to find great quantities of treasure. Not finding as much as he had hoped, he assumed that the real treasure had been hidden and set about capturing the local chiefs, whom he tortured for information. One of the chiefs captured during these campaigns was not an Incan; he said that he came from a land twelve days&#x27; march to the north. The Spaniards called him &quot;el indio dorado&quot;, &quot;the golden Indian&quot;. The reason for this is not clear, but it may have been because he wore golden armour or other body ornaments. Interested in finding the homeland of this &quot;golden Indian&quot;, Belalcázar sent an expedition party north, where they discovered the province of Popayán. However, Belalcázar himself made no further move at this time.

===Conquest of the Muisca===

====Journeys of Hohermuth and Quesada====

Following the death of Dalfinger, Georg Hohermuth von Speyer became the new governor of Coro, arriving at the colony in 1535. Federmann returned to Coro in the same year and resumed his former post as deputy. Hohermuth sent Federmann on an expedition to the Upar valley in the west, while he led an expedition of his own to the south, hoping to find gold in one direction or the other. Hohermuth&#x27;s party followed the course of the Andes south-southwest along the edge of the &quot;llanos&quot;; a two-year trek brought them to the region of the Ariari River, where they heard rumours of a rich land to the west. By this time, however, morale was low – over two hundred men had died along the way, and many of the remainder were too ill to fight – and Hohermuth was forced to turn back.

On the other side of the mountain range, a party led by the lawyer-turned-general Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada was also searching for the land of Meta. This expedition had set out from the Spanish colony of Santa Marta in April 1536, with the dual goal of finding an overland route to Peru and a strait to the Pacific. It was thought that both these goals could be accomplished by following the Magdalena River to its source. The party travelled south as far as La Tora (modern-day Barrancabermeja), where they found the river became too narrow and fast-flowing for any further progress to be made. Although they had suffered heavy losses, Quesada convinced his men not to turn straight back for home, declaring that &quot;it would be ignoble to return with nothing done&quot;. He had noticed cakes of rock salt in use among the tribes of La Tora and surrounding areas, which he suspected had been acquired by trade with a more advanced society to the east. His thoughts turned to the rumours he had heard of the &quot;powerful and rich province called Meta&quot;, and he decided, like Dalfinger before him, to follow the salt trail into the mountains.

In March 1537, after a lengthy climb, Quesada&#x27;s party arrived at the edge of a high plateau, at a place which they named Grita Valley (near modern-day Vélez). This plateau was home to a prosperous civilization; the villages they passed through now yielded impressive quantities of gold and emeralds. They were entering into the territory of the Muisca.

====Quesada&#x27;s conquest of the Muisca====
The Muisca were an agricultural people who built in wood rather than stone. They were not a unified tribe, but a loose organization of independent chiefdoms. The two most important rulers, to whom most of the other chieftains paid fealty, were the &quot;zipa&quot;, who ruled the lands to the south, and the &quot;zacque&quot;, who ruled the lands to the north. The Muisca were skilled at goldsmithing and cotton-weaving, but they produced little cotton of their own and there were no gold mines within their territory. They acquired these raw materials through trade, their own principal exports being salt, which was extracted from naturally-occurring deposits, and manufactured objects such as golden jewellery and cotton blankets. Most of the golden objects crafted by the Muisca were actually made of a gold-copper alloy called &quot;tumbaga&quot;. Gold played an important role in Musica religion; it decorated the principal temples and was used for votive offerings and funerary goods, often in the form of an anthropomorphic &quot;tunjo&quot;.

Quesada&#x27;s first move upon arriving at the Muisca plateau was to march on the &quot;zipa&quot;&#x27;s palace at Bacatá (modern-day Funza). The native armies sent to halt the advance of the Spaniards were easily defeated, and by the end of April Quesada had entered Bacatá. The &quot;zipa&quot;, however, had fled, taking all his treasure with him. After a few failed attempts to track him down, Quesada removed to the northern territory, where he had heard there were emerald mines. He found the mines at Somondoco, but they were difficult to work and his men were unable to recover more than a few emeralds. He therefore continued north to Tunja, home of the &quot;zacque&quot;, and here the &quot;conquistadors&quot; uncovered &quot;the single greatest haul of treasure in the entire conquest of Muisca territory&quot;. They captured the &quot;zacque&quot; and looted the palace, then turned their attention to nearby Sogamoso. This was a major religious centre and the location of the Muisca&#x27;s most sacred temple. The Spaniards accidentally burnt this temple to the ground, but not before acquiring another substantial haul of gold.

Not satisfied with these twin gains, Quesada led his men back to Bacatá to resume the search for the treasure of the &quot;zipa&quot;. Finally discovering the ruler&#x27;s stronghold in the mountains, he launched a night-time attack, during which the &quot;zipa&quot; was accidentally killed. The &quot;zipa&quot;&#x27;s successor, Sagipa, negotiated an alliance with the Spaniards, but was unable to tell them the location of the hidden treasure. In an effort to make him talk, they eventually tortured him to death, though Quesada himself disclaimed any responsibility for this action.

====Arrival of Belalcázar and Federmann====
In early 1539, after nearly two years on the plateau, Quesada received reports that a group of Europeans were camped in the Magdalena valley near Neiva, southwest of Bacatá. This was an army led by Sebastián de Belalcázar. Belalcázar had left Quito hurriedly in March 1538, after learning that his former general, Francisco Pizarro, had issued a warrant for his arrest. Arriving at Popayán, he had decided to venture east into the highlands. According to Belalcázar&#x27;s treasurer, Gonzalo de la Peña, the expedition left Popayán &quot;in search of a land called &quot;el dorado&quot;&quot;. This is the first appearance of this phrase in the historical record. 

Quesada sent a scouting party to investigate the newcomers; the rival expeditions met amicably, and shortly afterwards Quesada was informed that Belalcázar&#x27;s forces were approaching Bacatá. At the same time, he was told by his Indigenous allies that a third army was making its way up the slopes from the direction of the &quot;llanos&quot;. This force would prove to be headed by Nikolaus Federmann.

Federmann, following his mission to the Upar valley, had returned to Coro in September 1536. Finding Hohermuth still absent, he embarked on an unauthorized journey to the south-southwest, following Hohermuth&#x27;s trail. He was joined by survivors of another venture led by Jerónimo de Ortal, who had attempted to follow in Ordaz&#x27;s footsteps and locate the headwaters of the Meta. His men had mutinied against Ortal and struck out on their own; meeting up with Federmann, they brought with them the idea that the legendary land of gold was situated on higher ground. Federmann, like Hohermuth, skirted the edge of the Andes, but at one point took a detour into the plains, which happened to prevent his party from meeting Hohermuth&#x27;s returning expedition. Contemporary accounts suggest that Federmann deliberately avoided Hohermuth so as not to have to abandon his own quest and give assistance. 

Reaching the Ariari River towards the end of 1538, Federmann heard from the natives that there was much gold to be found to the west, and consequently began an assault on the Andean slopes. In February 1539, Federmann&#x27;s bedraggled troops emerged onto the plateau near Pasca. Within two months, the armies of Federmann, Quesada and Belalcázar were encamped within sight of each other at Bacatá, &quot;all within a six-league triangle&quot;. Each of the new arrivals believed that they had a claim to the plateau and its spoils. The geography of South America was still uncertain, and Belalcázar insisted that the Muisca territory lay within his jurisdiction, while Federmann argued that it was part of Venezuela. Quesada, a lawyer by training, resolved the tension by drawing up a contract. He granted each of his rival &quot;conquistadors&quot; a portion of the wealth he had looted from the Muisca, and all three agreed to return to Spain together and lay their territorial claims before the Council of the Indies. Then, on 29 April 1539, the three men jointly founded the city of Bogotá in the name of Charles V.

===Development of the legend===
====Contemporary accounts====
Aside from the aforementioned statement by Gonzalo de la Peña (from a testimony given in July 1539), there are no written references to a place or a person called &quot;El Dorado&quot; prior to 1541. It was in this year that the historian Oviedo recorded a story that was current among the Spanish inhabitants of Quito, relating to a native ruler called the &quot;Golden Chief or King&quot;:

The timing suggests that this story was brought back to Quito by the men who had assisted in the conquest of the Muisca. Oviedo did not specify where the golden prince was to be found, but by the 1580s the legend had become definitely associated with the Muisca, as evidenced by the following account written by Juan de Castellanos:

A later author, Antonio Herrera, connected this &quot;itinerant Indian&quot; with the &quot;indio dorado&quot; captured by Belalcázar in 1534. However, modern scholars have argued that there would be no reason for a citizen of Bacatá to travel as far south as Quito, either for purposes of trade or, as suggested by Herrera, as a diplomatic envoy. It is likely that Castellanos&#x27;s account is unreliable, and that Belalcázar had not heard the El Dorado legend prior to his arrival in Muisca territory.

A new element in Castellanos&#x27;s version of the story is the king&#x27;s habit of making oblations on a raft. In the early 17th century, Pedro Simón elaborated on this ceremony, claiming that it took place at Lake Guatavita near Bogotá, and that the gold dust was offered as a sacrifice to a supernatural entity living in the lake. Juan Rodríguez Freyle, in 1636, was the first to describe the ceremony as an investiture ritual undergone by each new &quot;zipa&quot;. Freyle claimed to have received his information from the nephew of the last Indigenous ruler of Guatavita that followed the Inca trail South to their Gold mines at Puente del Inca.

====Modern-day assessment====
Historians disagree on the veracity of these reports. Warwick Bray states that the Spanish conquerors heard the legend from Muisca natives who had witnessed the ceremony first-hand. Demetrio Ramos Pérez, followed by John Hemming among others, argues that the story was invented by the Spaniards themselves. José Ignacio Avellaneda regards it as &quot;rather certain&quot; that the legend had a factual basis. J. P. Quintero-Guzmán suggests that the Guatavita ceremony may have been a one-time event which lived on in the oral history of the Muisca until the arrival of the Spaniards.

Lakes did feature heavily in Muisca religion. It was said that the mother goddess Bachué emerged from a lake before peopling the earth, and then returned to the water in the form of a serpent. Guatavita was one of several sacred lakes found within Muisca territory, and it was not uncommon for gold, emeralds and other objects to be deposited at the lakeside as sacrificial offerings.

An archaeological find known as the Muisca raft has often been cited as evidence for the historicity of the El Dorado legend. Discovered in 1969 in a cave in the region of Pasca, this golden artefact depicts a man of high status, probably a chief, seated on a raft and surrounded by attendants. Quintero-Guzmán calls the relationship between this object and the legend of the golden man &quot;almost undeniable&quot;. A similar object, discovered at Lake Siecha in 1856 but later destroyed in a fire, was also described as a representation of the same ceremony, though others argued that it depicted an ordinary leisure cruise.

==The search for El Dorado==
===Pizarro and Orellana===

Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of Francisco, was governor of Quito at the time when the legend of El Dorado was developing. In February 1541, he led an expedition out of Quito to the east, hoping to find the country of this golden king. He was guided in his choice of direction by the report of a Spaniard who claimed to have been in a place called Cinnamon Valley, and had heard that beyond the valley was a flat, open country whose inhabitants wore golden jewellery. Accompanying the expedition as second-in-command was Francisco Orellana, a kinsman of the Pizarros.

On finding a few cinnamon trees, Pizarro enquired among the locals about the way to El Dorado; when they were unable to give him any information, he had them tortured and killed. After some aimless searching, the expedition arrived at the banks of the Coca River, where they met an Indigenous chief named Delicola. Pizarro&#x27;s reputation preceded him, and Delicola quickly told him what he wanted to hear: that further downstream he would find a wealthy and powerful civilization. Pizarro built a boat, and the expedition sailed down the Coca to the Napo River.

On 25 December, Pizarro was forced to call a halt, as his starving men were threatening to mutiny. Delicola, whom they had brought with them as a prisoner, assured them the land they sought was just a few days&#x27; journey down the river. It was decided that Orellana should take the healthiest men aboard the boat and go in search of food, while Pizarro and the others followed on foot. However, Orellana was unable to find sufficient quantities of food to satisfy Pizarro&#x27;s army, and soon realized that in any case returning upstream would be impossible. He made the decision to abandon Pizarro and sail on. Reaching the confluence of the Napo River with the Amazon, he and his men became the first Europeans to sail upon the latter river. They successfully navigated its entire length, eventually emerging into the Atlantic Ocean.

During their voyage, Orellana&#x27;s party passed through a long stretch of land inhabited by the Omagua. Impressed by their religious idols, their skilfully crafted pottery, and their well-maintained trading routes, Orellana took captives and questioned them about their culture. They told him that very wealthy people lived a little way inland, but Orellana decided that he lacked the manpower to investigate further. Nonetheless, his account of the great wealth of the Omagua would prove influential to future expeditions.

===Hernán de Quesada and Philip von Hutten===

When Jiménez de Quesada departed for Spain, he left his brother Hernán in temporary command of the Muisca province, now known as New Granada. When Hernán de Quesada heard the story of El Dorado, he was eager to be the first to find it, and believed that his position in the heart of Colombia, together with the local knowledge of his men, would give him an advantage in the search. He consequently organized an expedition to the south, leaving Bogotá in September 1541. After a time, suffering greatly from illness and starvation, but urged on by persistent rumours of golden lands ahead, his party turned westward and found themselves in the region of Pasto, an area already colonized by Belalcázar. The expedition was here given up as a failure.

In early 1542, Philipp von Hutten, a German nobleman who had travelled with Hohermuth, set out to find the rich country that he was sure Hohermuth had almost discovered. He was joined by Bartholomeus Welser, a member of the merchant banking family which governed Venezuela. Leading their men along the edge of the &quot;llanos&quot;, they came upon the tracks of Hernán de Quesada&#x27;s south-bound expedition. Judging that Quesada would not have deserted his province except in expectation of finding even greater wealth, they decided to follow the same route. A native chief informed them that there were no rich settlements in that direction, and added that he had received word from neighbouring tribes that the Spaniards who had passed that way earlier were now all dead or dying, but von Hutten believed this to be merely an attempt to distract him from his mission.

Towards the end of 1543, on the banks of the Guaviare River, von Hutten heard from the locals that nearby were &quot;enormous towns of very rich people who possessed innumerable wealth&quot;. He was guided to a village of the Omagua people, and was told that the village chief owned several life-sized effigies of solid gold, and that still richer chieftains lived in the regions beyond. The Europeans launched an attack, during which von Hutten and his captain were badly wounded by native lancers. The expedition retreated to Coro, with the intention of returning with a larger force. Upon their return, however, a Spanish revolt against the Germans resulted in the execution by beheading of Bartholomeus Welser and von Hutten.

===Pedro de Ursúa and Aguirre===
In 1550, Charles V ordered the suspension of all expeditions while a debate was held in Spain on their legitimacy. This official suspension lasted nearly a decade, until in 1559 Pedro de Ursúa received permission from the Viceroy of Peru to equip an expedition to the Amazon. It was, by now, widely believed among the Peruvian settlers that the fabled El Dorado lay in the lands of the Omagua. The stories of the European explorers had been corroborated by a band of Indigenous Brazilians who had lately arrived in the Peruvian town of Chachapoyas, having traveled upstream along the Amazon. They said that they had been among the Omagua, and spoke of &quot;the inestimable value of their riches, and the vastness of their trading&quot;. Fired by these reports, Ursúa assembled a force of 370 Spaniards, embarking with a flotilla of small boats on 26 September 1560.

A secondary purpose of the expedition was to find employment for the idle veterans of recent civil wars; among them Lope de Aguirre, a disgraced former soldier who had no interest in El Dorado and little motive for loyalty to his superiors. On 1 January 1561, Aguirre led a mutiny against the leaders of the expedition. The mutineers killed Pedro de Ursúa and elected Fernando de Guzman, a Spanish nobleman, as their &quot;lord and prince&quot;. A few months later, Aguirre had Guzman assassinated and assumed command. The quest for El Dorado was abandoned, and the mutineers sailed down the Amazon with the intention of conquering Peru. They reached the ocean and sailed north, before landing at Borburata and marching overland towards the Andes. At Barquisimeto, the journey came to an end when Aguirre was killed by his own men.

===Martín de Poveda and Jimenez de Quesada===
In 1566, a new expedition was launched from Peru, led by Martín de Poveda and accompanied by Pedro Maraver de Silva and Diego Soleto. They travelled north along the Andes from Chachapoyas to Bogotá, finally determining that El Dorado was not to be found anywhere within this region. However, information received from the natives along the route now pointed towards the eastern &quot;llanos&quot; as the site of the legendary city.

Meanwhile, Jiménez de Quesada had taken up residence in New Granada, and had been appointed Adelantado of the colony. Enthused by the arrival of Martín de Poveda&#x27;s troops, and their news that El Dorado lay to the east, Quesada obtained permission from the king to conquer and explore the eastern plains. He departed in December 1569, with an army of three hundred Spaniards and fifteen hundred slaves. Nothing was heard of him for two and a half years; after which time it was reported that he was returning to Bogotá with only fifty surviving soldiers and thirty slaves, having &quot;made no settlement and ... achieved nothing&quot;.

===Antonio de Berrio===

Quesada died in 1579, and his estates and title were inherited by his son-in-law, Antonio de Berrio. As Quesada&#x27;s will stipulated that his successor must continue to search &quot;most insistently&quot; for El Dorado, Berrio obediently gathered together an expeditionary force and set out across the &quot;llanos&quot;. By April 1584, he was encamped four leagues from the Orinoco River, which runs along the western edge of the plain. Berrio believed that El Dorado was located somewhere in the highlands of the Guianas, on the far side of the river. Captured natives confirmed under questioning that these highlands were home to &quot;great settlements and a very great number of people, and great riches of gold and precious stones&quot;. They also spoke of a great lake within the Guianas which they called Manoa. Berrio led his men across the Orinoco but soon found that they were not fit to continue any further, and he was forced to turn for home.

In March 1587, Berrio launched a second expedition. He crossed the river once more and spent several months exploring the forests on the other side, searching for a route into the mountains. Eventually his men rebelled against him and deserted, leaving him no choice but to return again to Bogotá.

During the third attempt, which began in March 1590, Berrio decided to row downstream along the Orinoco, north and east, in order to reach the Caroní River, which discharges into the Orinoco from the Guianas. The Caroní was known to be unnavigable, but Berrio hoped that a pass to the Guianas could be found by following its banks. Upon reaching the point of convergence, he found he had not enough men to make the ascent. He continued down the Orinoco, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean not far from the island of Trinidad. He and his followers founded a new town on the island, San José de Oruña, and began preparations for a final assault on the Guianas.

===Walter Raleigh===
On 22 March 1595, an English fleet headed by Walter Raleigh arrived off the coast of Trinidad. Raleigh made peaceful overtures to the Spanish inhabitants of the island, trading with them and entertaining them on board his ships. Under the influence of wine, the Spaniards spoke freely of Berrio&#x27;s activities in Guiana, the geography of the land, and of the riches they believed were to be found in the interior. On 7 April, Raleigh launched a surprise attack against the town of San José and captured Berrio. Having gleaned what information he could from the experienced &quot;conquistador&quot;, Raleigh announced his own intention to strike out into Guiana and find the golden city.

Unable to bring his ships into the narrow channels of the Orinoco delta, he had his carpenters adapt one of them (possibly a galleass) so that it drew only five feet of water; this vessel was able to carry sixty men, while another forty were distributed among the smaller boats. They made slow progress through the delta, soon becoming lost in what Raleigh described as a &quot;labyrinth of rivers&quot;. Eventually, however, they emerged into the Caño Manamo, and from there into the Orinoco proper.

A little further upriver, near the confluence of the Orinoco and the Caroní, Raleigh met a native chief called Topiawari, with whom he entered into friendly relations. Topiawari told him that his people had recently been driven out of inland Guiana by a warlike tribe from the west; this seemed to bolster the theory, current among the Spanish and strongly held by Raleigh, that El Dorado was populated by fugitive Incans from Peru. Topiawari would later inform Raleigh that the invading tribe was rich in gold, and that their nearest town, just four day&#x27;s journey to the south, was the source of &quot;all those plates of gold which were scattered among the borderers, and carried to other nations far and near ... but that those of the land within were far finer&quot;.

Raleigh continued on to the mouth of the Caroní, and here found that the strength of the current prevented any further progress. He sent out two reconnaissance parties overland, himself accompanying a third. A few precious-looking stones were found, which the men eagerly tore out of the hard ground with their fingers and daggers, but most of these proved to be worthless. They received information that at the head of the Caroní stood a great lake some forty miles wide, in which large quantities of alluvial gold could be found; but having no means of advancing, and threatened by the rising waters of the Orinoco, Raleigh gave up the expedition, hoping to return at a more opportune time.

It was not until 1616, over twenty years later, that Raleigh received permission from James I to attempt a second expedition in Guiana. He promised the king that he could recover an abundance of gold from a certain mine near the Caroní that he had heard of on his former voyage. James gave Raleigh strict instructions not to engage in any hostilities against the Spanish, who still controlled the area around the Orinoco. On reaching South America, Raleigh remained aboard the ship and sent a force headed by Lawrence Kemys to seek out the mine. For unclear reasons, Kemys attacked and captured the Spanish town of Santo Tomé; Raleigh&#x27;s son Wat was killed in the battle. Unable to find the mine, the men returned to the ship, where Kemys, facing Raleigh&#x27;s displeasure, committed suicide. Raleigh was put on trial in England – charged with lying about the mine and with attempting to stir up conflict between England and Spain – and was executed.

==Lake Parime==
During Berrio&#x27;s first expedition, he had heard of a vast lake called Manoa supposedly located in the highlands of the Guianas. El Dorado had long been associated with a lake, so this report added fuel to the theory that the fabled golden city lay somewhere east of the Orinoco. In 1596, Lawrence Kemys heard reports of a lake called Parime or Parima, which he assumed to be identical with Manoa; it was said to be so large that the natives &quot;know no difference between it and the main sea&quot;. This lake was included in maps of the Guianas throughout the 17th century, though no European had seen it.

In 1674, two Jesuits, Jean Grillet and François Bechamel, traversed the area and found no trace of a lake. In 1740, Nicholas Horstmann discovered Lake Amucu, a little way south of the supposed location of Lake Parime; Amucu was a reedy lake only a mile wide, with no golden city on its banks. Doubts began to emerge as to Lake Parime&#x27;s existence. In 1800, Alexander von Humboldt conducted a survey of the area around the Orinoco; he discovered that &quot;Parime&quot; was the word used by local tribes for any large body of water, and suggested that the seasonal flooding of the plains around Lake Amucu might be the source of the legend. This theory was corroborated by Robert Schomburgk, who visited Lake Amucu in 1836. Humboldt&#x27;s influence eventually resulted in the final disappearance of Lake Parime from maps and gazetteers – the effacement, as Schomburgk wrote, &quot;of those last vestiges of that delusive bubble, El Dorado&quot;.

==Cultural influence==

Despite its dismissal as a myth, the subject of El Dorado has retained its hold on the popular imagination into the present day. One early work of fiction to feature the golden city is &quot;Candide&quot;, a 1759 satire by the French philosopher Voltaire. The novel aims to contrast the idealism of its principal characters with the harsh realities of life, but in El Dorado the situation is reversed. The city is represented as a &quot;pure Utopia&quot;, a fulfilment of all ideals, but the protagonists leave because they find its moral perfection unsatisfying. Another literary use of the motif is in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s 1849 poem &quot;Eldorado&quot;. The story of the &quot;gallant knight&quot; related in the poem is generally taken as a metaphor for the search for truth, with the final stanza hinting that it cannot be found in this world.

The city has been depicted on-screen in such films as &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; and &quot;Amazon Obhijaan&quot;. Some filmmakers have taken inspiration from the struggles of the &quot;conquistadors&quot;: Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; presents a fictionalized retelling of Lope de Aguirre&#x27;s rebellion, and the Spanish film &quot;Gold&quot;, by Agustín Díaz Yanes, depicts the trials of a 16th-century Spaniard in America, also partly based on Aguirre. Video games have likewise sought to simulate the experience of the early explorers. A campaign in the strategy game &quot;Age of Empires II&quot; allows the player to take control of Francisco de Orellana, while &quot;Europa Universalis IV: El Dorado&quot; provides the option of sending out expeditionary forces to uncover the mysteries of the Americas. The adventure game &quot;&quot;, set in the modern day, involves a search for El Dorado, which turns out to be the name of a cursed golden idol.

El Dorado features in several album and song titles by artists such as Neil Young (&quot;Eldorado&quot;), Electric Light Orchestra (&quot;Eldorado&quot;) and 24kGoldn (&quot;El Dorado&quot;). The Colombian artist Shakira supported her &quot;El Dorado&quot; album with a world tour which concluded in Bogotá. Aterciopelados, a Colombian rock group, also have an album titled &quot;El Dorado&quot; which explores the country&#x27;s cultural history. El Dorado is also mentioned in the Beatles’ avant-garde song &quot;Revolution 9&quot;.

<text>The Linguistic Society of Hong Kong Cantonese Romanization Scheme, also known as Jyutping, is a romanisation system for Cantonese developed in 1993 by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong (LSHK).

The name &quot;Jyutping&quot; (itself the Jyutping romanisation of its Chinese name, ) is a contraction of the official name, and it consists of the first Chinese characters of the terms &quot;jyut6 jyu5&quot; () and &quot;ping3 jam1&quot; (; pronounced &quot;pīnyīn&quot; in Mandarin).

Despite being intended as a system to indicate pronunciation, it has also been employed in —in effect, elevating Jyutping from its assistive status to a written language. 
==History==

The Jyutping system departs from all previous Cantonese romanisation systems (approximately 12, including Robert Morrison&#x27;s pioneering work of 1828, and the widely used Standard Romanization, Yale and Sidney Lau systems) by introducing z and c initials and the use of eo and oe in finals, as well as replacing the initial y, used in all previous systems, with j.

In 2018, it was updated to include the -a and -oet finals, to reflect syllables recognized as part of Cantonese phonology in 1997 by the Jyutping Work Group of the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong.

== Initials ==

== Finals ==
* Only the finals &quot;m&quot; and &quot;ng&quot; can be used as standalone nasal syllables.
* Used for elided words in casual speech such as &quot;a6&quot; in 四十四 (&quot;sei3 a6 sei3&quot;), elided from &quot;sei3 sap6 sei3&quot;.
* Referring to the colloquial pronunciation of these words.
* Used for onomatopoeias such as &quot;oet6&quot; for belching or &quot;goet4&quot; for snoring.

== Tones ==

There are nine tones in six distinct tone contours in Cantonese. However, as three of the nine are entering tones (), which only appear in syllables ending with &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;k&quot;, they do not have separate tone numbers in Jyutping (though they do in the ILE romanization of Cantonese; these are shown in parentheses in the table below). A mnemonic which some use to remember this is or &quot;Feng Shui [dictates that] we will be lucky.&quot;
== Comparison with Yale romanisation ==
Jyutping and the Yale romanisation of Cantonese represent Cantonese pronunciations with the same letters in:
* The initials: &quot;b&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;gw&quot;, &quot;kw&quot;, &quot;w&quot;.
* The vowel: &quot;aa&quot; (except when used alone), &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;yu&quot;.
* The nasal stop: &quot;m&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;.
* The coda: &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;.
But they differ in the following:
* The vowels &quot;eo&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; represent and respectively in Jyutping, whereas the &quot;eu&quot; represents both vowels in Yale.
* The initial &quot;j&quot; represents in Jyutping whereas &quot;y&quot; is used instead in Yale.
* The initial &quot;z&quot; represents in Jyutping whereas &quot;j&quot; is used instead in Yale.
* The initial &quot;c&quot; represents in Jyutping whereas &quot;ch&quot; is used instead in Yale.
* In Jyutping, if no consonant precedes the vowel &quot;yu&quot;, then the initial &quot;j&quot; is appended before the vowel. In Yale, the corresponding initial &quot;y&quot; is never appended before &quot;yu&quot; under any circumstances.
* Jyutping defines five finals not in Yale: &quot;a&quot; &quot;, eu&quot; , &quot;em&quot; , &quot;ep&quot; , oet . These finals are used in colloquial Cantonese words, such as &quot;deu6&quot; (), &quot;lem2&quot; (), and &quot;gep6&quot; ().
* To represent tones, only tone numbers are used in Jyutping whereas Yale traditionally uses tone marks together with the letter &quot;h&quot; (though tone numbers can be used in Yale as well).

== Comparison with ILE romanisation ==
Jyutping and ILE romanisation represent Cantonese pronunciations with the same letters in:
* The initials: &quot;b&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;gw&quot;, &quot;kw&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;w&quot;.
* The vowel: &quot;aa&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot;.
* The nasal stop: &quot;m&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;.
* The coda: &quot;i&quot; (except for its use in the coda in Jyutping; see below), &quot;u&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;.
But they have some differences:
* The vowel &quot;oe&quot; represents both and in ILE whereas &quot;eo&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; represent and respectively in Jyutping.
* The vowel &quot;y&quot; represents in ILE whereas both &quot;yu&quot; (used in the nucleus) and &quot;i&quot; (used in the coda of the final -&quot;eoi&quot;) are used in Jyutping.
* The initial &quot;dz&quot; represents in ILE whereas &quot;z&quot; is used instead in Jyutping.
* The initial &quot;ts&quot; represents in ILE whereas &quot;c&quot; is used instead in Jyutping.
* To represent tones, the numbers 1 to 9 are usually used in ILE, although the use of 1, 3, 6 to replace 7, 8, 9 for the checked tones is acceptable. However, only the numbers 1 to 6 are used in Jyutping.

== Examples ==

==Jyutping input method==
The Jyutping method () refers to a family of input methods based on the Jyutping romanization system.

The Jyutping method allows a user to input Chinese characters by entering the Jyutping romanization of a Chinese character (with or without tone, depending on the system) and then presenting the user with a list of possible characters with that pronunciation.

As of macOS Ventura, Jyutping input with Traditional Chinese now comes standard on macOS under the name &quot;Phonetic – Cantonese&quot;.

<text>Robert Ward Johnson (July 22, 1814 – July 26, 1879) was an American planter and lawyer who served as the senior Confederate States senator for Arkansas, a seat that he was elected to in 1861. He previously served as a delegate from Arkansas to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1862.

==Early life and education==

Robert Ward Johnson was born on July 22, 1814, in Scott County, Kentucky, to Benjamin and Matilda ( Williams) Johnson. His father had three brothers who were elected as U.S. Congressmen and the family was politically prominent in the state. His grandfather had acquired thousands of acres of land in the area at the end of the eighteenth century. The family were slaveholders. His siblings included a sister Juliette. His paternal uncles were Richard Johnson, a United States Representative and Senator, and vice president of the United States under Martin Van Buren; and his brothers James Johnson and John Telemachus Johnson, older and younger, respectively, who were each elected as U.S. Representatives from Kentucky.

In 1821 when Johnson was seven, his parents moved the family to Arkansas Territory, where his father had been appointed as Superior Judge. They settled in Little Rock. His father was appointed in 1836 as the first federal district judge in the new state of Arkansas. Johnson was later sent back to Kentucky to study at the Choctaw Academy, which his uncle Richard Johnson had founded in 1825 on his farm near Georgetown, primarily to educate Choctaw boys from the Southeast in the English language and European-American culture. He was handsomely paid by the federal government.

At times, 200–300 boys attended the academy. The Choctaw students were at the school in the period prior to the Indian Removal in the 1830s of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot;, but they were under pressure in the Southeast from encroaching settlers. His uncle kept the school going into the late 1830s, after some peoples had been forcibly relocated to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. The young Johnson went on to study at St. Joseph&#x27;s College, an academy in Bardstown, and graduated.

After St. Joseph&#x27;s, Johnson returned to Little Rock. He studied law as a legal apprentice and was admitted to the bar in 1835. He married Sarah Frances Smith in 1836. They had six children together; three survived to adulthood. Sarah died in 1862, during the American Civil War. The next year, Johnson at the age of 49 married her younger sister, Laura. They had no children.

==Political career==
In Little Rock, Johnson soon became involved in Democratic Party politics. He was elected as the prosecuting attorney for Little Rock and served from 1840 to 1843. He effectively acted as the state&#x27;s attorney.

His sister Juliette married Ambrose Sevier, who was later elected as US Senator from Arkansas. Both Sevier and Johnson became part of The Family, a group of men related by marriage and politics, who dominated the state Democratic Party and politics, and its national representation in the antebellum years.

Prior to the American Civil War, Johnson moved his family to Helena, Arkansas, in the Mississippi Delta, where he established his law practice. Johnson was elected from there, beginning in 1846, to the Thirtieth, Thirty-first, and Thirty-second Congresses. He became chairman of the House Committee on Indian Affairs. In this period, his brother-in-law Sevier was chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.

Johnson declined to run for reelection in 1852. He was appointed by the legislature to the United States Senate to fill the unexpired term of Senator Solon Borland. In 1855, he was elected by the legislature to the seat, serving the full term until 3 March 1861. After the outbreak of the American Civil War, he served as a delegate to the Provisional Government of the Confederate States in 1862. He served as a member of the Confederate Senate from 1862 to 1865.

==Later life and death==
The American Civil War ended Johnson&#x27;s political career. Property damage and the abolition of slavery ruined him economically. After the war, he practiced law in Washington, D.C., for more than a decade. Returning to Arkansas in the late 1870s, he ran unsuccessfully for reelection to the Senate in 1878. Johnson died in Little Rock in 1879. He is buried in the historic Mount Holly Cemetery there.

<text>The Archdiocese of Turku is the oldest diocese in Finland. Medieval bishops of the Catholic Church were also &quot;de facto&quot; secular leaders of the country until the end of the 13th century.

After the Reformation in Scandinavia, Lutheran bishops became state officials. When Finland became a separate grand duchy, the then bishop of Turku was designated as an archbishop in 1817. Since 1868, the archbishops of Turku and Finland have been considered primates of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland.

== Bishop Henry ==
Henry, Bishop of Uppsala is often mentioned in contemporary sources as the first bishop of Finland. According to legend, the English-born Henry arrived in Finland with King Eric IX of Sweden during the First Swedish Crusade, later suffering martyrdom in the 1150s. His position as Bishop of Finland is, however, totally unhistorical, and not claimed even by legendary accounts.

== Catholic bishops of Finland ==
*Rodulff 1156?–1178? (first mentioned in the 15th century, uncertain)
*Fulco 1178?–1198? (first mentioned in the 15th century, uncertain)
&quot;An unnamed Bishop of Finland is mentioned dead in 1209. Papal letters to unnamed Bishops of Finland have survived from 1221, 1229 and 1232.&quot;
*Thomas 1230s?–1245 
*Bero I 1248–1258

== Catholic bishops of Turku (Åbo, Aboa) ==
The position Bishop of Finland was renamed Bishop of Turku, first mentioned in 1259, in a move to harmonise the name of the dioceses with other Swedish sees.

<doc id="306869" wikidata="Q1027380" url="?curid=306869" title="Solon Borland">
<text>Solon Borland (September 21, 1808 – January 1, 1864) was an American politician, journalist, physician and military officer. He served as a United States Senator from Arkansas from 1848 to 1853. Later in life, he served as an officer of the Confederate States Army including commanded of a cavalry regiment in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Solon Borland was born on September 21, 1808, in Nansemond County, Virginia to Thomas Borland, a native of Scotland, and Harriet Godwin Borland. When he was a youth, his family moved to Murfreesboro, North Carolina, where he attended Hertford Academy. Borland also studied medicine in Philadelphia and Louisville. As a captain in 1831, he led a company of Virginia militia forces that were dispatched to Southampton County to fight Nat Turner&#x27;s slave rebellion. He owned slaves himself.

==Politics==
After the war, Borland was elected as a United States Senator to fill the unexpired term of Ambrose Hundley Sevier. His views were generally of a disunionist version, and he was not popular with many Senate members. During an 1850 debate over Southern rights, he physically attacked Mississippi Senator Henry Foote. He discovered soon after his return to Little Rock, Arkansas, that his views were not popular at home, either. In 1852 he opposed the decision of sending Commodore Perry to open Japan to international trade on grounds that the leaders of that country did not offend U.S. interests by refusing to open their country to international trade. Borland resigned from the United States Senate in 1853 and was appointed as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary (Nicaragua).

Immediately after his arrival in Managua, Borland called for the U.S. Government to repudiate the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, and for the American military to support Honduras in the event of a possible war with Great Britain. In a public address in Nicaragua, he stated that it was his greatest ambition to see Nicaragua &quot;forming a bright star in the flag of the United States&quot;. He was reprimanded for this by Secretary of State William Marcy. While leaving Greytown in May, 1854, Borland interfered with the local arrest of an American citizen. A crowd had gathered, and a bottle was thrown which hit Borland in the face. Enraged, he reported the incident to the U.S. president, who promptly dispatched a gunboat, and demanded an apology. When none was given, Greytown was bombarded and destroyed.

Borland returned to Little Rock in October 1854, and resumed his medical practice and operation of his pharmacy. Borland declined a nomination from President Pierce as governor of the New Mexico Territory. However he remained active in local politics, and very vocal as to his views on state&#x27;s rights and secession.

==Military==

=== Mexican–American War ===
During the Mexican–American War, Borland was commissioned major of the Arkansas Mounted Infantry Regiment serving under Archibald Yell. Borland served throughout the war, having turned over his newspaper business to associates. He was taken as a prisoner of war by the Mexican army on January 23, 1847, just south of Saltillo. He escaped, and was discharged when his regiment was disbanded and mustered out in June, but continued in the army as volunteer aide-de-camp to General William J. Worth during the remainder of the campaign, from the Battle of Molino del Rey to the capture of Mexico City on September 14, 1847.

=== American Civil War ===
At the start of the American Civil War, Borland was appointed as a commander of Arkansas Militia by Arkansas Governor Henry M. Rector, and ordered to lead the expedition that seized Fort Smith, Arkansas, in the first days of the war, despite the fact that Arkansas had not yet seceded. By the time Borland and his forces arrived in Fort Smith, the Federal troops had already departed, and there were no shots fired. He was replaced as commander at the Arkansas Secession convention less than a month later, but he was able to obtain a position as a commander for Northeast Arkansas. For a time in 1861 he commanded the depot at Pitman&#x27;s Ferry, near Pocahontas, Arkansas, responsible for troop deployments and supplies. Borland&#x27;s only son with his third wife, George Godwin Borland, had joined the Confederate States Army despite being only 16 years of age, and would later be killed in action. Borland&#x27;s first wife, Huldah G. Wright (1809–1837), bore him a son Harold who served in the Confederate States Army as a major, assigned to the Eastern Sub-district of Texas of the Trans-Mississippi Department.

Borland helped recruit troops for the Confederacy during this period, helping to raise the 3rd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment on June 10, 1861, becoming its first colonel. The regiment was sent to Corinth, Mississippi, but without Borland. It would eventually serve under Major-General Joseph Wheeler, seeing action in the Second Battle of Corinth and the Battle of Hatchie&#x27;s Bridge, along with other battles as a part of the Army of Mississippi. However, Borland never left Arkansas.

While in command of northern Arkansas, he ordered an embargo of goods to end price speculation, which was rescinded by Governor Rector. Borland protested that a governor could not countermand an order from a Confederate official, but in January 1862 his order was countermanded by the Confederate States Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin. In declining health and resenting that embarrassment, Borland resigned from further service to the Confederacy in June, 1862, moving to Dallas County, Arkansas. He died on January 1, 1864, in Harris County, Texas. His burial place is in the old City Cemetery, Houston.

== Journalism ==
In 1843, following his second wife&#x27;s death, Borland moved to Little Rock, where he founded the &quot;Arkansas Banner&quot;, which became an influential newspaper in statewide Democratic Party politics. Three years later, Borland challenged the editor of the rival &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot;, a Whig newspaper, to a duel due to a slander published against him.

In October 1855, Borland, with Albert Pike and Christopher C. Danley, abandoned the Democratic Party, claiming the party had become abolitionist. Danley, who was an editor for the aforementioned &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot;, took ownership from William E. Woodruff and turned it into a mouthpiece for the Know Nothing party, which Danley and Borland had joined in October 1855.

<text>Conrad Yeatis &quot;Sonny&quot; Clark (July 21, 1931 – January 13, 1963) was an American jazz pianist and composer who mainly worked in the hard bop idiom.

==Early life==
Clark was born and raised in Herminie, Pennsylvania, a coal mining town east of Pittsburgh. His parents were originally from Stone Mountain, Georgia. His miner father, Emery Clark, died of a lung disease two weeks after Sonny was born. Sonny was the youngest of eight children. At age 12, he moved to Pittsburgh.

==Later life and career==
While visiting an aunt in California at age 20, Clark decided to stay and began working with saxophonist Wardell Gray. Clark went to San Francisco with Oscar Pettiford and after a couple months, was working with clarinetist Buddy DeFranco in 1953. Clark toured the United States and Europe with DeFranco until January 1956, when he joined The Lighthouse All-Stars, led by bassist Howard Rumsey.

Wishing to return to the east coast, Clark served as accompanist for singer Dinah Washington in February 1957 in order to relocate to New York City. In New York, Clark was often requested as a sideman by many musicians, partly because of his rhythmic comping. He frequently recorded for Blue Note Records as one of their house musicians, playing as a sideman with many hard bop players, including Kenny Burrell, Donald Byrd, Paul Chambers, John Coltrane, Dexter Gordon, Art Farmer, Curtis Fuller, Grant Green, Philly Joe Jones, Clifford Jordan, Jackie McLean, Hank Mobley, Art Taylor, and Wilbur Ware. He also recorded sessions with Charles Mingus, Sonny Rollins, Billie Holiday, Stanley Turrentine, and Lee Morgan.

As a leader, Clark recorded albums &quot;Dial &quot;S&quot; for Sonny&quot; (1957, Blue Note), &quot;Sonny&#x27;s Crib&quot; (1957, Blue Note), &quot;Sonny Clark Trio&quot; (1957, Blue Note), &quot;Cool Struttin&#x27;&quot; (1958, Blue Note), &quot;Blues in the Night&quot; (1979, Blue Note, also released on &quot;Standards&quot;), and a second piano trio album titled &quot;Sonny Clark Trio&quot; (1960, Time Records).

Clark died in New York City on January 13, 1963 (aged 31). The official cause was listed as a heart attack, but the likely cause was a heroin overdose.

==Legacy==
Close friend and fellow jazz pianist Bill Evans dedicated the composition &quot;NYC&#x27;s No Lark&quot; (an anagram of &quot;Sonny Clark&quot;) to him after his death, included on Evans&#x27; &quot;Conversations with Myself&quot; (1963). John Zorn, Wayne Horvitz, Ray Drummond, and Bobby Previte recorded an album of Clark&#x27;s compositions, &quot;Voodoo&quot; (1985), as the Sonny Clark Memorial Quartet. Zorn also recorded several of Clark&#x27;s compositions with Bill Frisell and George E. Lewis on &quot;News for Lulu&quot; (1988) and &quot;More News for Lulu&quot; (1992).

<text>Baal-hanan (Hebrew: בַּעַל חָנָן / בָּעַל חָנָן,  &quot;Baʿal Ḥanan&quot;  &quot;Baʿal Ḥānān&quot; / &quot;Bāʿal Ḥānān&quot;) means &quot;Baal has been gracious&quot;. There are two men by this name in the Hebrew Bible.

In , Baal-hanan is a King of Edom. He is also mentioned in the King List in . He succeeded Shaul and was himself succeeded by Hadad. He was the son of Achbor.

He is called the son of Achbor; but the name of his native city is not given. For this and other reasons, Marqaurt supposes that &quot;son of Achbor&quot; is a duplicate of &quot;son of Beor&quot; (Gen. 36:32), and that &quot;Baal-hanan&quot; in the original text is given as the name of the father of the next king, Hadar.

The date and even historicity of his reign are unknown, as he is not mentioned in any other surviving source.

In the Books of Chronicles there is also a second man by this name, from the city of Geder. In he is described as being responsible to King David for the care of olive and sycamore trees.

<text>A disdrometer is an instrument used to measure the drop size distribution and velocity of falling hydrometeors. Some disdrometers can distinguish between rain, graupel, and hail.

The uses for disdrometers are numerous. They can be used for traffic control, scientific examination, airport observation systems, and hydrology. The latest disdrometers employ microwave or laser technologies. 2D video disdrometers can be used to analyze individual raindrops and snowflakes.

<text>Paveway is a series of laser-guided bombs (LGBs).

&quot;Pave&quot; or PAVE is sometimes used as an acronym for &quot;precision avionics vectoring equipment&quot;; literally, electronics for controlling the speed and direction of aircraft. Laser guidance is a form of Pave.

Pave, paired with other words, is the first name for various laser systems that designate targets for LGBs, for example Pave Penny, Pave Spike, Pave Tack and Pave Knife, and for specialized military aircraft, such as AC-130U Pave Spectre, MH-53 Pave Low, and HH-60 Pave Hawk.

== Development ==
The Paveway series of laser-guided bombs was developed by Texas Instruments, with the project starting in 1964. The program was conducted on a shoestring budget, but the resultant emphasis on simplicity and economical engineering proved to be a benefit, and a major advantage over other more complex guided weapons. The first test, using a M117 bomb as the warhead, took place in April 1965.

Early version featured aerodynamic designs led by Richard Johnson.

In January 1967 the US Air Force authorized Project 3169 as the formal engineering program for development of precision guided munitions, renewing its contract with TI in March to redesign the M117 kit, with a very aggressive timeline, projecting deployment for combat testing in the Vietnam War in one year. Direction of the program was assigned to the Guided Bomb Program Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in August and flight testing begun in November at Eglin Air Force Base under the direction of an interagency organization called the Pave Way Task Force. At that time the program had three divisions:
* Paveway 1 – laser-guided munitions
* Paveway 2 – an electro-optical guidance (TV) munition developed by Rockwell International designated HOBO (&quot;&quot;Ho&quot;ming &quot;Bo&quot;mb&quot;), of which 4,000 were eventually produced and 500 launched in combat, and
* Paveway 3 – an infrared homing system that was never deployed.

Paveway 1 became the emphasis of the program because Paveway 2, although considerably more accurate and capable, cost 4-5 times more per unit and was much less applicable to most targeting situations in Vietnam. Prototype weapons were sent to Southeast Asia for combat testing with the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing from May to August 1968. In the combat evaluations the BOLT-117 achieved a circular error probability (CEP) of while the Paveway achieved a CEP of with one in every four bombs scoring a direct hit.

Paveway kits attach to a variety of warheads, and consist of a semi-active laser (SAL) seeker, a computer control group (CCG) containing guidance and control electronics, thermal battery, and pneumatic control augmentation system (CAS). There are front control canards and rear wings for stability. The weapon guides on reflected laser energy: the seeker detects the reflected light (&quot;sparkle&quot;) of the designating laser, and actuates the canards to guide the bomb toward the designated point.

The original Paveway series, retroactively named Paveway I, gave way in the early 1970s to the improved Paveway II, which had a simplified, more reliable seeker and pop-out rear wings to improve the weapon&#x27;s glide performance. Both Paveway I and Paveway II use a simple &#x27;bang-bang&#x27; control system, where the CAS commands large canard deflections to make course corrections, resulting in a noticeable wobble. This had relatively little effect on accuracy, but expends energy quickly, limiting effective range. As a consequence, most users release Paveway I and II weapons in a ballistic trajectory, activating the laser designator only late in the weapon&#x27;s flight to refine the impact point.

In 1976, the USAF issued a requirement for a new generation, dubbed Paveway III, that finally entered service in 1986. The Paveway III system used a much more sophisticated seeker with a wider field of view and proportional guidance, minimizing the energy loss of course corrections. Paveway III has a considerably longer glide range and greater accuracy than Paveway II, but it is substantially more expensive, limiting its use to high-value targets. Although Paveway III kits were developed for the smaller Mk 82 weapons, limited effectiveness caused the USAF to adopt the kit only for the larger 907 kg (2,000 lb) class weapons (the Mk 84 and BLU-109). Paveway III guidance kits were also used on the GBU-28/B penetration bomb fielded at the close of the 1991 Gulf War. The Paveway III system was also used during the Indian offensive in the Kargil War of 1999 by the Indian Air Force with the Mirage 2000 as a launch platform. Raytheon, the sole provider of Paveway III variants, is currently delivering both standard and enhanced versions to the US Government and foreign customers.

Existing LGBs in US service can be upgraded to Dual Mode Laser Guided Bombs (DMLGB) by adding GPS receivers which enable all weather employment. Lockheed Martin won the initial contract to provide DMLGBs to the US Navy (USN) in 2005, however subsequent-year money has been &quot;zeroed&quot; in favor of a follow-on Direct Attack Moving Target Capability (DAMTC) program. Raytheon&#x27;s version, the &quot;Enhanced Paveway II&quot;, has been contracted both within the US and abroad.

Raytheon&#x27;s advanced Paveway IV 225 kg (500 lb) bomb has been in service since 2008 with Britain&#x27;s RAF. In US service it is designated the GBU-49. In 2017 the F-35 program office rushed to field the GBU-49 to use its ability to strike moving targets and fill the gap left by the early retirement of the CBU-103 cluster bomb.

In March 2017, Lockheed rebranded its Paveway Dual-Mode Plus weapon as the &quot;Paragon&quot; with the aim of competing against the laser-guided variant of the JDAM, as it offers the same capability while being &quot;at least 30 percent cheaper&quot; due to new, less costly microprocessors and engineering for the guidance electronics.

==Variants==
The Paveway series of bombs includes:
* GBU-10 Paveway II – Mk 84 or BLU-109 2,000 lb (907 kg) bomb
* GBU-11 Paveway – M118 3,000 lb (1,360 kg) bomb. Saw limited use during the Vietnam War
* GBU-12 Paveway II – Mk 82 500 lb (227 kg) bomb
* GBU-16 Paveway II – Mk 83 1,000 lb (454 kg) bomb
* GBU-58 Paveway II – Mk 81 250 lb (113.4 kg) bomb
* GBU-22 Paveway III – Mk 82 500 lb (227 kg) bomb. Developed at the same time as GBU-24, with some limited export success, but was not adopted by United States as it was felt to be too small a warhead for the desired effects at the time.
* GBU-24 Paveway III – Mk 84/BLU-109 2,000 lb (907 kg) class bomb
* GBU-27 Paveway III – BLU-109 2,000 lb (907 kg) bomb with penetration warhead, specially designed for F-117 because the large fins of GBU-24 couldn&#x27;t fit into the bomb bay of F-117.
* GBU-28 Paveway III – During the Gulf War, the deepest and most hardened Iraqi bunkers could not be defeated by the BLU-109/B penetrator warhead, so a much more powerful &quot;bunker buster&quot; GBU-28 was developed. The latest warhead used in the GBU-28/B series is the BLU-122/B, a development of earlier BLU-113 on early GBU-28s.
* Paveway IV – 500 lb (227 kg) bomb
* GBU-48 Enhanced Paveway II – Mk 83 1,000 lb (454 kg) bomb. Raytheon&#x27;s Enhanced dual-mode GPS and Laser guided version of the laser-only GBU-16.
* GBU-49 Enhanced Paveway II – BLU-133 500 lb (227 kg) bomb. Raytheon&#x27;s Enhanced dual-mode GPS and Laser guided version of the laser-only GBU-12.
* GBU-50 Enhanced Paveway II – Mk 84 or BLU-109 2,000 lb (907 kg) bomb. Raytheon&#x27;s Enhanced dual-mode GPS and Laser guided version of the laser-only GBU-10.
* GBU-59 Enhanced Paveway II – Mk 81 250 lb (113.4 kg) bomb. Raytheon&#x27;s Enhanced dual-mode GPS and Laser guided version of the laser-only GBU-58.
Although GBU-48 etc. are the formal designation for the versions with GPS/INS, they are widely referred to as EGBU-16 etc. (&quot;Enhanced GBU-16&quot;).

=== Numbering systems===
Due to the aforementioned numbering systems, there is considerable scope for confusion regarding weapons called &#x27;Paveway X&#x27;. The numbering systems include:
* The original numbering system from 1-3, with the different planned variants differing in types of guidance. As 2 and 3 never entered service, this numbering system is obsolete.
* The system used currently by US forces, which numbers in chronological order
* The system used by the RAF, which numbers earlier versions of the Paveway as 2 and 3 - with 2 referring to a 1,000 lb bomb and 3 referring to a 2,000 lb bomb - and Enhanced Paveway 2 and 3 to refer to GPS/INS-added versions of the same. The Paveway 4 is the same weapon in this and the above system.

==Assembly==
== Trademark ==
Lockheed Martin and Raytheon compete to supply LGBs to the United States Air Force, and others. Raytheon claimed the exclusive right to use &quot;Paveway™&quot; as a trademark for selling LGB-related products. Lockheed Martin claimed &quot;Paveway&quot; is a generic term in the defense industry. Lockheed objected to Raytheon&#x27;s registration of &quot;Paveway&quot; in opposition proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. On September 27, 2011, the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board decided that &quot;Paveway&quot; is a generic term, in the United States, for LGBs.

Raytheon subsequently sued Lockheed Martin in Arizona federal court alleging trademark infringement, Lockheed filed counterclaims in the suit. In September, 2014 the companies agreed that Raytheon is the exclusive owner of &quot;Paveway™&quot; for laser-guided bombs and related goods and services and that &quot;Paveway&quot; is a protectable trademark, but that Raytheon will license the mark to Lockheed for use in connection with single-mode laser-guided bomb kits. The two companies compete each year for U.S. and foreign orders.

<text>A laser-guided bomb (LGB) is a guided bomb that uses semi-active laser guidance to strike a designated target with greater accuracy than an unguided bomb. First developed by the United States during the Vietnam War, laser-guided bombs quickly proved their value in precision strikes of difficult point targets. These weapons use on-board electronics to track targets that are designated by laser, typically in the infrared spectrum, and adjust their glide path to accurately strike the target. Since the weapon is tracking a light signature, not the object itself, the target must be illuminated from a separate source, either by ground forces, by a pod on the attacking aircraft, or by a separate support aircraft.

Data from the 28,000 laser guided bombs dropped in Vietnam showed that laser-guided bombs achieved direct hits nearly 50% of the time, despite the laser having to be aimed out the side window of the back seat of another aircraft in flight. Unguided bombs had an accuracy rate of just 5.5% per mission, which usually included large numbers of the munitions. Because of this dramatically higher precision, laser-guided munitions can carry less explosive and cause less collateral damage than unguided munitions. Today, laser-guided bombs are one of the most common and widespread guided bombs, used by many of the world&#x27;s air forces.

== Development ==
Laser-guided weapons (LGW) were first developed in the United States in the early 1960s. The United States Air Force (USAF) issued the first development contracts in 1964, leading to the development of the Paveway series, which was used operationally in the Vietnam War starting in 1968. 

Originally the project began as a surface-to-air missile seeker developed by Texas Instruments. When TI executive Glenn E. Penisten attempted to sell the new technology to the Air Force, Col. Joe Davis Jr. inquired if it could instead be used as a ground attack system to overcome problems US aircraft were having with the accuracy of bombing in Vietnam. Davis had already witnessed a test of the Army&#x27;s new laser target designator made by Martin Marietta, but no seeker existed to make use of the system. Davis had already performed tests from the back seat of an F-4 Phantom and proved that it was possible to accurately target objects from a moving aircraft. His mock testing proved correct, and during further testing with live seekers, it took just six attempts to improve the seeker&#x27;s accuracy from to within of the target. This greatly exceeded the design requirements. It was commissioned by the USAF in 1967 and two different types, the BOLT-117, and the Paveway I completed a combat evaluation in Vietnam from May to August 1968. Without the existence of tracking pods the Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) in the back seat of an F-4 Phantom II fighter bomber used a hand-held Airborne Laser Designator to guide the bombs, but half of the LGBs still hit their targets despite the difficulties inherent in keeping the laser on the target. LGBs proved to offer a much higher degree of accuracy than unguided weapons but without the expense, complexity, and limitations of guided air-to-ground missiles like the AGM-12 Bullpup. The LGB proved particularly effective against difficult fixed targets like bridges, which previously had required huge loads of &quot;dumb&quot; ordnance to destroy.

It was determined that 48% of Paveways dropped during 1972–73 around Hanoi and Haiphong achieved direct hits, compared with only 5.5% of unguided bombs dropped on the same area a few years earlier. The average Paveway landed within of its target, as opposed to for gravity bombs. The leap in accuracy brought about primarily by laser guidance made it possible to take out heavily defended, point objectives that had eluded earlier air raids. 

The most dramatic example was the Thanh Hoa Bridge, south of Hanoi, a critical crossing point over the Red River. Starting in 1965, U.S. pilots had flown 871 sorties against it, losing 11 planes without managing to put it out of commission. In 1972 the “Dragon’s Jaw” bridge was attacked with Paveway bombs, and 14 jets managed to do what the previous 871 had not: drop the span and cut a critical North Vietnamese supply artery.

In the wake of this success, other nations, specifically the Soviet Union, France, and Great Britain began developing similar weapons in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while US weapons were refined based on combat experience.

In October 2010, India developed its first Sudarshan laser-guided bomb with the help of IRDE, a lab of DRDO.

The USAF and other air forces are now seeking to upgrade their LGBs with GPS guidance as a backup. These weapons, such as the USAF Enhanced Guided Bomb Unit (part of the Paveway family), use laser designation for precision attacks but contain an inertial navigation system with a GPS receiver for backup so that if the target illumination is lost or broken, the weapon will continue to home in on the GPS coordinates of the original target.

<doc id="306900" wikidata="Q948562" url="?curid=306900" title="Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction">
<text>Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction, colloquially known as Tommy John surgery, is a surgical graft procedure where the ulnar collateral ligament in the medial elbow is replaced with either a tendon from elsewhere in the patient&#x27;s body, or with one from a deceased donor. The procedure is common among collegiate and professional athletes in several sports, particularly in baseball. The surgery is performed to restore optimal function for repetitive elbow movements or specifically throwing ability, often extending the careers of professional athletes. In many athletes, the surgery is done more than once during their careers.

The procedure was devised in 1974 by orthopedic surgeon Frank Jobe, a Los Angeles Dodgers team physician who served as a special advisor to the team until his death in 2014. It is named after the first baseball player to undergo the surgery, major league pitcher Tommy John, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 26 seasons. The initial operation, John&#x27;s successful post-surgery career, and the relationship between the two men was the subject of a 2013 ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary.

== Uses ==
The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) can become stretched, frayed, or torn through the repetitive stress of the throwing motion. The risk of injury to the UCL is believed to be extremely high, as the amount of stress through the structure approaches its ultimate tensile strength during a hard throw.

This injury is associated with baseball, although it sometimes appears in other sports. Compared to athletes who play other sports, baseball players are at elevated risk of overuse injuries and injuries caused by early sports specialization among children and teenagers.

The results of a 2002 study suggest that the total number of pitches thrown is the greatest determinant. The study examined the throwing volume, pitch type and throwing mechanics of 426 pitchers aged nine to fourteen for one year. Compared to pitchers who threw 200 or fewer pitches in a season, those who threw 201–400, 401–600, 601–800, and 800+ pitches faced an increased risk of 63%, 181%, 234%, and 161% respectively. The types of pitches thrown showed a smaller effect; throwing a slider was associated with an 86% increased chance of elbow injury while throwing a curveball was associated with an increase in pain. There was only a weak correlation between throwing mechanics perceived as bad and injury-prone.

Research into throwing injuries in young athletes has led to age-based recommendations for pitch limits.

Increasingly often, pitchers require a second procedure after returning to pitching. During the periods from 2001 to 2012 and 2013 to 2015, 18 major-league pitchers underwent the procedure for a second time. As of April 2015, the average amount of time between procedures is 4.97 years.

== Risks ==
There is a risk of damage to the ulnar nerve.

=== Misconceptions ===

Some baseball pitchers believe that they can throw harder after ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction than they could beforehand. As a result, orthopedic surgeons have reported that parents of young pitchers have asked them to perform the procedure on their uninjured sons in the hope that it will increase performance. However, many people, including Frank Jobe, believe that any post-surgical increases in performance are most likely the result of the increased stability of the elbow joint and pitchers&#x27; increased attention to their fitness and conditioning. Jobe believed that rather than allowing pitchers to gain speed, the surgery and rehab protocols merely allow pitchers to return to their pre-injury levels of performance.

== Technique ==

=== Reconstruction ===

A surgical incision of is made near the elbow. Holes to accommodate a replacement graft tendon are drilled in the ulna and humerus bones of the elbow. A harvested tendon, such as the palmaris tendon from the forearm of the same or opposite elbow, the patellar tendon, hamstring, toe extensor or a donor&#x27;s tendon (allograft), is then woven in a figure-eight pattern through the holes and anchored. The ulnar nerve is usually moved to prevent pain, as scar tissue can apply pressure to the nerve. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis allowing discharge the same day, with the arm in a splint to protect the repair for the first week. After one week, a brace is employed to protect the reconstruction for about six weeks following surgery.

=== Repair ===

Repair is largely viable in cases of acute UCL avulsion type-injury at the proximal or distal end, with the main benefit of the procedure is reduced rehabilitation time compared to that of UCL reconstruction. Early attempts at UCL repair yielded poor results and were largely abandoned until anchor fixation was improved in 2008.

== Recovery ==

The rehabilitation process following surgery is typically divided into four separate phases.

# Rehabilitation phase 1 (postoperative weeks zero to three) consists of prevention of stiffness, promotion of healing, and simultaneous protection of the reconstructed graft with a hinged elbow brace
# The goals of phase 2 (weeks four to eight) are to gain strength and gain full range of movement
# During phase 3 (weeks nine to 13), the rehabilitation is focused on flexibility and neuromuscular control with a progression toward sports-related activities
# The progression to a throwing program is made during phase 4 (weeks 14 to 26) for overhead athletes

Full competition throwing is usually permitted at seven to nine months, and pitchers are ready to return to the game at approximately 10 to 18 months.

== Incidence ==

Over two decades preceding 2016, the number of UCLR surgeries increased threefold, a rate that was expected to continue to rise. A 2015 study showed that the rate of UCLR surgery for those aged 15 to 19 was the highest among all age ranges and was increasing by 9% each year.

USA Baseball, Major League Baseball, and Little League Baseball initiated the Pitch Smart program designed to lower the risk of elbow injuries in adolescent pitchers. The main risk factors for elbow injury from overhand throwing are the number of pitches per game, innings pitched per season, months pitched per year and poor pitching biomechanics that may increase torque and force on the elbow.

== History ==


At the time of John&#x27;s operation, Jobe estimated the chance for success of the operation at one in 100. By 2009, the odds of complete recovery had risen to 85–92%.

Following his 1974 surgery, John missed the entire 1975 season rehabilitating his arm before returning for the 1976 season. Before his surgery, John had won 124 games. He won 164 games after surgery, retiring in 1989 at age 46.

For baseball players, full rehabilitation takes about 1215 months for pitchers and about six months for position players. Players typically begin throwing about 16 weeks after surgery. While 80% of players return to pitching at the same level as before the surgery, for those Major League Baseball pitchers who receive the surgery twice, 35% never pitch again in the major leagues.

Jobe has stated that if he had invented the technique ten years earlier, it might have been nicknamed Sandy Koufax surgery, after Dodgers hall of famer Sandy Koufax, who retired with &quot;essentially the same thing as Tommy John.&quot;

<text>The term magistrate is used in a variety of systems of governments and laws to refer to a civilian officer who administers the law. In ancient Rome, a &quot;magistratus&quot; was one of the highest ranking government officers, and possessed both judicial and executive powers. In other parts of the world, such as China, magistrate is a word applied to a person responsible for administration over a particular geographic area. Today, in some jurisdictions, a magistrate is a judicial officer who hears cases in a lower court, and typically deals with more minor or preliminary matters. In other jurisdictions (e.g., England and Wales), magistrates are typically trained volunteers appointed to deal with criminal and civil matters in their local areas.

==Original meaning==
In ancient Rome, the word &quot;magistratus&quot; referred to one of the highest offices of state. Analogous offices in the local authorities, such as &quot;municipium&quot;, were subordinate only to the legislature of which they generally were members, &quot;ex officio&quot;, often a combination of judicial and executive power, constituting one jurisdiction. In Rome itself, the highest magistrates were members of the so-called &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, &#x27;course of honors&#x27;. They held both judicial and executive power within their sphere of responsibility (hence the modern use of the term &quot;magistrate&quot; to denote both judicial and executive officers), and also had the power to issue &quot;ius honorarium&quot;, or magisterial law. The Consul was the highest Roman magistrate. The Praetor (the office was later divided into two, the Urban and Peregrine Praetors) was the highest judge in matters of private law between individual citizens, while the Curule Aediles, who supervised public works in the city, exercised a limited civil jurisdiction in relation to the market. Roman magistrates were not lawyers, but were advised by jurists who were experts in the law.

The term was maintained in most feudal successor states to the western Roman Empire. However, it was used mainly in Germanic kingdoms, especially in city-states, where the term magistrate was also used as an abstract generic term denoting the highest office, regardless of the formal titles (e.g. Consul, Mayor, Doge), even when that was actually a council. The term &quot;chief magistrate&quot; applied to the highest official, in sovereign entities the head of state and/or head of government.

==Continental Europe and its former colonies==

Under the civil law systems of European countries, such as Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands, &quot;magistrat&quot; (French), &quot;magistrato&quot; (Italian) and &quot;magistraat&quot; (Dutch) are generic terms which comprise both prosecutors and judges, distinguished as the &#x27;standing&#x27; versus &#x27;sitting&#x27; magistrature, respectively.

In France and Italy, and several other European countries, examining magistrate judges have represented the victim and are part of overseeing investigations from the beginning of a case, in consultation with police and prosecutors. In France they are titled investigative judge (&quot;&quot;, &quot;judge of inquiry&quot;). Italy and some other nations have ended this practice.

In Portugal, besides being used in the scope of the judiciary to designate prosecutors and judges, the term &quot;magistrado&quot; was also used to designate certain government officials, like the former civil governors of district. These were referred as &quot;administrative magistrates&quot;, to distinguish them from the judiciary magistrates. The President of Portugal is considered the Supreme Magistrate of the Nation.

In Finland, &quot;maistraatti&quot; (the Finnish-language cognate of &quot;magistrate&quot;, officially translated as &quot;local register office&quot;) is a state-appointed local administrative office whose responsibilities include keeping population information and public registers, acting as a public notary and conducting civil marriages.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico&#x27;s Federal Law System, a &quot;magistrado&quot; (magistrate) is a superior judge (and the highest-ranking State judge), hierarchically beneath the Supreme Court Justices (Ministros de la Corte Suprema).

The &quot;magistrado&quot; reviews the cases seen by a judge in a second term if any of the parties disputes the verdict. For special cases, there are &quot;magistrados superiores&quot; (superior magistrates) who review the verdicts of special court and tribunal magistrates.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, the magistrational roles of the judge were transferred to a newly established legal body of the judiciary in 1942, which is that of the &quot;Rechtspfleger&quot; or judicial magistrate.

==English common law tradition==

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====

Magistrates hear &#x27;summary offences&#x27; and some &#x27;triable-either-way offences&#x27; in the Courts of England and Wales. In 2021, there were 12,651 magistrates, a number that has fallen steadily in recent years, decreasing by 50% from 25,170 since 2012. Magistrates have a maximum sentencing power of up to 12 months&#x27; imprisonment, and/or an unlimited fine. In practice, magistrates have a wide range of sentencing options, which include issuing fines, imposing community orders, or dealing with offences by means of a discharge. In more serious cases, where magistrates consider that their sentencing powers are insufficient, they can send &#x27;either-way&#x27; offenders to the Crown Court for sentencing.

All criminal cases begin in a magistrates&#x27; court. The most serious cases (for example murder, rape, etc) are sent to the Crown Court, although magistrates&#x27; will often decide on issues such as bail and any preliminary matters. Lesser offences, including all summary only offences and some either-way offences will be dealt with entirely in the magistrates&#x27; court. A wide range of other legal matters are within the remit of magistrates, such as matters relating to licensing and debt collection, for example. In the past, magistrates have been responsible for granting licences to sell alcohol; this function is now exercised by local councils, although there is a right of appeal to the magistrates&#x27; court. Magistrates are also responsible for granting orders such as search warrants to the police and other authorities. It used to be a requirement that they live within a radius of the area they preside over (the &quot;commission area&quot;) in case they are needed to sign a warrant after hours. However, &quot;commission areas&quot; were replaced with &quot;Local Justice Areas&quot; by the Courts Act 2003, meaning magistrates no longer need to live within , although, in practice, many still do. Section 7 of the Courts Act 2003 states that &quot;There shall be a commission of the peace for England and Wales—…b) addressed generally, and not by name, to all such persons as may from time to time hold office as justices of the peace for England and Wales&quot;. Thus, every magistrate in England and Wales may act as a magistrate anywhere in England or Wales.

There are two types of magistrates in England and Wales: Justices of the Peace, and District Judges (formerly known as stipendiary magistrates). Justices of the peace (JPs) are trained volunteers appointed from the local community; the nature of their role means that it is not necessary for them to be legally qualified, but they do have the assistance of a legally qualified adviser in Court. JPs require intelligence, common sense, integrity, and the capacity to act fairly. They are selected by a local advisory committee and only recommended to the Lord Chancellor for appointment if they can demonstrate the six key qualities required of a judicial office holder, these are: (a) good character, (b) commitment and reliability, (c) social awareness, (d) sound judgement, (e) understanding and communication and (f) maturity and sound temperament. Membership is widely spread throughout the area covered and drawn from all walks of life. Police officers, traffic wardens, RSPCA employees and certain other categories of employees, as well as their close relatives, will not be appointed, nor will those convicted of certain criminal offences including recent minor offences.

All new justices of the peace undergo comprehensive training before sitting. There is a mentoring programme to help guide new appointees (mentors are magistrates with at least three years&#x27; service). The training, delivered by the Judicial College, covers the necessary law and procedure required for their role. They continue to receive training throughout their judicial career, and are appraised every four years (every two years for a Presiding Justice) to check that they continue to remain competent in their role. Additional training is given to justices choosing to sit in the Youth Court or those dealing with family matters. New JPs sit with mentors on at least six occasions during their first eighteen months. Justices of the peace are unpaid appointees, but they may receive allowances to cover travelling expenses, subsistence and loss of earnings for those not paid by their employer while sitting as a magistrate, up to a maximum of £116.78 a day. A justice of the peace may sit at any magistrates&#x27; court in England and Wales, but in practice, they are appointed to their local bench (a colloquial and legal term for the local court). Justices of the peace will normally sit as a panel of three, with two as a minimum in most cases, except those cases dealt with under the single justice procedure. Many are members of the Magistrates&#x27; Association, which provides advice and training and also represents magistrates.

The other type of magistrate is known as a district judge (magistrates&#x27; courts). Unlike justices of the peace, district judges (magistrates&#x27; courts) usually sit alone, although still have the benefit of a legal adviser. They are paid Judges appointed by open competition through a process administered by the Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC) and are required to be qualified solicitors, barristers, or chartered legal executives. Some also sit in the family court. Questions have been raised by the Magistrates&#x27; Association as to the legal safeguards of a single district judge allowed to hear a case, decide the outcome, and pass sentence without reference to another party, however the criminal procedure rules do require some cases to be heard by a district judge, such as those matters relating to extradition or where the contested issue is a disputed point of law.

According to the official statistics for diversity of the judiciary in April 2021, 56% of sitting magistrates were women, 13% were Black, Asian and minority ethnic and 82% per aged above 50.

====Scotland====
In the courts of Scotland, the office of stipendiary magistrate was established by Section 5 of the District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975, and was replaced by the office of summary sheriff by Section 218 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014. In Scotland, the lowest level of law-court, a justice of the peace court, is presided over by a justice of the peace, who like in England and Wales are trained volunteers. Stipendiary magistrates are, &quot;ex officio&quot;, justices of the peace, and when sitting in a JP court had the summary criminal jurisdiction and powers of a sheriff.

===Australia===
====Federal magistrate====
A federal magistrate was an office created on 23 December 1999 along with the establishment of the Federal Magistrates&#x27; Court by the Australian Government as a result of royal assent of the &quot;Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth)&quot;. Its first judicial officers were appointed in 2000; it first applications were filed on 23 June 2000 and the Court&#x27;s first sittings were conducted on 3 July 2000 in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, , Parramatta and Townsville.

The Federal Magistrates&#x27; Court of Australia dealt with more minor Commonwealth law matters which had previously been heard by the Federal Court of Australia (administrative law, bankruptcy, consumer protection, trade practices, human rights, and copyright) or the Family Court (divorce, residence [or custody], and contact with [or access to] the children, property division upon divorce, maintenance, and child support). In some areas, such as bankruptcy and copyright, the court had virtually unlimited jurisdiction.

The federal magistrates would hear shorter or less complex matters or matters in which the monetary sum in disputes does not exceed given amounts. For instance, property divisions where the total assets are A$700,000 or less and consumer law matters (trade practices) where the amount claimed is less than $750,000. The first Chief Federal Magistrate, Diana Bryant left the court in 2004 when she was appointed Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, the third person to be appointed that position since the establishment of the Family Court.

Eventually, the Federal Magistrates&#x27; Court assumed a significant part of the workload of the Federal Court and the Family Court. By May 2004, the court was dealing with 73% of the total number of applications made in the three courts). The Federal Magistrates&#x27; Court was exercising jurisdiction well in excess of that of the state magistrates&#x27; courts, and similar to that of the District and County courts of the Australian states.

On 12 April 2013, in recognition of its increased jurisdiction and its role as an intermediate court servicing regional centres as well as capital cities throughout Australia, the Federal Magistrates&#x27; Court was renamed the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, the Act renamed as the &quot;Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999&quot;, and its judicial officers received the title &quot;judge&quot; instead of &quot;federal magistrate&quot;.

====State magistrate====
The state magistrates in Australia derive from the English magistrates. All magistrates are salaried officers.

The jurisdiction of the magistrates varies from state-to-state. They preside over courts which are, depending on the state, called magistrates&#x27; courts, Local Court, or courts of petty sessions.

Magistrates hear bail applications, motor licensing applications, applications for orders restraining a given individual from approaching a specific person (&quot;intervention orders&quot; or &quot;apprehended violence orders&quot;), summary criminal matters, the least serious indictable criminal matters, and civil matters where the disputed amount does not exceed A$40,000 to A$100,000 (depending on the state).

In some states, such as Queensland and NSW, the magistrate may appear robed; although, some magistrates are known to prefer a business suit. Magistrates presiding in the Koori Court (which deals with Aboriginal defendants) were originally of a mind not to appear robed; however, elders within the Indigenous community urged magistrates to continue wearing robes to mark the solemnity of the court process to defendants. Robing is being considered for magistrates in other states; however, neither counsel nor solicitors appear robed in any Australian magistrates&#x27; court. Robing in summary courts is unlikely to extend to the legal profession.

Historically, magistrates in Australia have been referred to as &quot;Your Worship&quot;. (From Old English &quot;weorthscipe&quot;, meaning being worthy of respect.) However, members of the magistracy are now addressed as &quot;Your Honour&quot; in all states. This was partly to recognize the increasing role magistrates play in the administration of justice, but also to recognize the archaic nature of &quot;Your Worship&quot;, and the tendency for witnesses and defendants to incorrectly use &quot;Your Honour&quot; in any event. It is also acceptable to address a magistrate simply as Sir or Madam.

===Hong Kong===

As of 2024, there are seven magistrates&#x27; courts in Hong Kong. Magistrates are appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission and must be qualified barristers. Magistrates exercise criminal jurisdiction over a wide range of offences. Although there is a general limit of two years&#x27; imprisonment or a fine of HK$100,000, certain statutory provisions give Magistrates the power to sentence up to three years&#x27; imprisonment and to impose a fine up to HK$5,000,000.

===Bangladesh===
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1898, there are two classes of magistrates in Bangladesh, namely judicial magistrate and executive magistrate.

There are four classes of judicial magistrate (chief metropolitan magistrate in metropolitan areas and chief judicial magistrate in other areas, magistrate of the first class, metropolitan magistrate in metropolitan areas), magistratem of the second class and magistrates of the third class.

====Executive magistrate====

According to section 10(6 )of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) 1898, members of the Bangladesh Civil Service (Administration) Cadre in the capacity of assistant commissioner, upozila mirbahi officer and additional deputy commissioner shall be executive magistrates and may exercise the power of executive magistrates within their existing respective local areas. Besides this, according to the provision of the section 10(5), the government may, if it thinks it expedient or necessary, appoint any persons employed in the Bangladesh Civil Service (Administration) to be an executive magistrate and confer the powers of an executive magistrate on any such member.

Every administrative district has the following executive magistrates:

:District magistrate: In every district and in every metropolitan area, the government shall appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be executive magistrates and shall appoint one of them to be the district magistrate.

:Additional district magistrate : The government may also appoint any executive magistrate to be an additional district magistrate who shall have all or any of the powers of a district magistrate under the code or under any other law for the time being in force, as the government may direct.

:Additional deputy commissioner:, all of whom are executive magistrates.

:Upazila nirbahi officer or sub-district executive officer

:Assistant commissioner including senior assistant commissioner and assistant commissioner (land).

===India===
There are two classifications of magistrates: judicial magistrates, who are part of the judiciary (court), and executive magistrates, who are government administrative officials and belong to the executive branch of the government.

==== Judicial magistrates ====
There are four categories of magistrates in the judiciary of India. This classification is given in the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (CrPC). It stipulates that in each sessions district, there shall be:
* a chief judicial magistrate
* a sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM)
* a judicial magistrates first class (JFCM/JMFC)

The chief judicial magistrate [CJM] (including additional chief judicial magistrates) hear all types of criminal cases. All magistrates&#x27; courts are controlled by the CJM. who looks over the work of judicial magistrates, but cannot take any action against them. The CJM can only report the misbehavior of judicial magistrates to the High Court. A court of chief judicial magistrates can sentence a person to jail for up to seven years and impose fines up to any amount. The CJM is the most senior magistrate in their district.

There is a sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) in every subdivision. They hear cases related to the Dowry Act, EC Act, and other criminal cases. They also maintain and control the judicial court below them. A court of sub-divisional judicial magistrates may sentence a person to imprisonment for up to three years and impose a fine of up to . Judicial magistrates can try criminal cases.

A judicial magistrate of first class (also known as judicial first class magistrate) can sentence a person to jail for up to three years and impose a fine of up to .

==== Executive magistrates ====
An executive magistrate is an officer of the executive branch of the state government (e.g., government department, typically the land revenue department) rather than the Judicial branch. The primary mandate of an Executive Magistrate is to preserve public tranquility and prevent any actions that may disrupt peace and order. They are vested with specific powers under both the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS - the &quot;Indian Citizen Safety Code&quot;) and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS - the &quot;Indian Justice Code&quot;). These powers are conferred by Sections 125–129, 152, 163, 164 and 166 of the BNSS. They are distinct from Judicial Magistrates, who preside over courts, conduct trials and try criminal cases. These officers cannot try any accused nor pass verdicts. A person arrested on the orders of a court located outside the local jurisdiction should be produced before an executive magistrate who can also set the bail amount for the arrested individual to avoid police custody, depending on the terms of the warrant. The executive magistrate also can pass orders restraining persons from committing a particular act or preventing persons from entering an area (Section 163, BNSS). There is no specific provision to order a &quot;curfew&quot;. The executive magistrates alone are authorised to use force against people. In plain language, they alone can disperse an &quot;unlawful assembly&quot;. Technically, the police are to assist the executive magistrate. Executive magistrates can dictate to the police the manner of force (baton charge, tear gas, blank fire, firing) and how much force should be used. They can also seek the assistance of the armed forces to quell a riot.

There are, in each revenue district (as opposed to a sessions district) the following kinds of executive magistrates:
* a district magistrate (DM)
* two or more additional district magistrates (ADM)
* four or more sub-divisional magistrates (SDM)
* at least ten executive magistrates
All of the executive magistrates of the district, except the ADM, are under the control of the DM.

These magistrates are normally conferred on the officers of the Revenue Department, although an officer can be appointed exclusively as an executive magistrate. Normally, the collector of the district is appointed as the DM. Similarly, the sub-collectors/sub divisional officers are appointed as the SDMs. Tehsildars and deputy/additional tehsildars are appointed as executive magistrates.

In some metropolitan areas, the government has conferred specific or full powers of an Executive Magistrate upon Police Commissioners and their deputies within the police commissionerate system.

Under the old CrPC, there was no distinction between the executive and judicial magistrates and some states still follow the old CrPC.

===New Zealand===
The position of stipendiary magistrate in New Zealand was renamed in 1980 to that of district court judge. The position was often known simply as &quot;magistrate&quot; or with the postnominal initials &quot;SM&quot; in newspapers&#x27; court reports.

In the late 1990s, a position of community magistrate was created for District Courts on a trial basis. A community magistrate sits in the hierarchy just below a district court judge. They only have criminal case jurisdiction. They are lay judicial officers, not needing to hold a law degree, although many do.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, a magistrate is a judicial officer appointed to preside over a magistrate&#x27;s court to a particular jurisdiction under the &quot;Judicature Act No 02 of 1978&quot;. The post was formally known as police magistrate when the courts were known as police magistrate courts. Magistrates have jurisdiction over the criminal cases filed under the penal code. They carry out first mortem and post mortem examinations, issue search warrants and arrest warrants, produce suspected persons and grant bail. In many cases, magistrates preside over primary courts Unofficial magistrates can be appointed from among the senior lawyers of the local bar. There are four types of magistrate

* Chief magistrate (only of the metropolitan area of Colombo)
* Magistrate/municipal magistrate 
* Additional magistrate (found when there are more than one Magistrate in one station)
* Unofficial magistrate

===United States===
Magistrates are somewhat less common in the United States than in Europe, but the position does exist in some state jurisdictions and in federal courts.

The term &quot;magistrate&quot; is often used (chiefly in judicial opinions) as a generic term for any independent judge who is capable of issuing warrants, reviewing arrests, etc. When used in this way, it does not denote a judge with a particular office. Instead, it denotes (somewhat circularly) a judge or judicial officer who is capable of hearing and deciding a particular matter. That capability is defined by state statute or by common law. In Virginia, for example, the Constitution of 1971 created the office of magistrate to replace the use in cities and counties of the justice of the peace, which is common in many states for this function.

As noted above, the terms &quot;magistrate&quot; or &quot;chief magistrate&quot; were sometimes used in the early days of the republic to refer to the president of the United States, as in President John Adams&#x27;s message to the U.S. Senate upon the death of George Washington: &quot;His example is now complete, and it will teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates, citizens, and men, not only in the present age, but in future generations, as long as our history shall be read&quot; (19 December 1799).

====Federal courts====

In the United States federal courts, a magistrate judge is a judicial officer authorized by &quot;&quot; They were formerly known as U.S. commissioners, and then as magistrates. Magistrate judges, as they have been designated since 1990, are appointed by the life-term federal district judges of a particular court, serving terms of eight years if full-time, or four years if part-time, and may be reappointed. Magistrate judges conduct a wide range of judicial proceedings to expedite the disposition of the civil and criminal caseloads of the United States district courts. Congress set forth in the statute the powers and responsibilities that could be delegated by district court judges to magistrate judges. To achieve maximum flexibility in meeting the needs of each court, however, Congress left to the individual courts the actual determination of which duties to assign to magistrate judges.

====State courts====

In many state court systems in the United States, magistrate courts are the successor to Justice of the Peace courts, and frequently have authority to handle the trials of civil cases up to a certain dollar amount at issue, applications for bail, arrest and search warrants, and the adjudication of petty or misdemeanor criminal offences. In Ohio, magistrates are subordinate to the judge or judges who appoint them, and all of their decisions are subject to the review, amendment, approval, or reversal by a judge. In some states, including West Virginia and Georgia, magistrates are elected and not appointed.

==Other traditions==

===China===

Magistrate, or chief magistrate, is also a common translation of the Chinese &quot;xianzhang&quot; (县长/縣長 &quot;literally: county leader&quot;) the political head of a county or &quot;xiàn&quot;/&quot;hsien&quot; (县/縣) which ranks in the third level of the administrative hierarchy of China. Magistrates are also the administrative heads of government of counties during the Republican era. The county magistrate elections are heavily and sometimes bitterly contested, and are often a stepping-stone to higher office. The translation dates from imperial China in which the county magistrate was the lowest official in the imperial Chinese bureaucracy and had judicial in addition to administrative functions.

After losing the Chinese Civil War, county magistrate elections in the Republic of China were first open to election in the 1960s and, before the end of martial law in 1991, were the highest elected position of any real power, and hence, the focus of election campaigns by the Tangwai movement. The magistrates became the first level head of government after the central government reduced provincial powers in 1998. In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the county leader is elected by the local people&#x27;s congress but the process is controlled by the Communist Party.

===Russia===

In Russia, magistrates (justices of the peace) handle minor criminal cases where imprisonment is for less than three years such as slander, petty hooliganism, public drunkenness, and serious traffic violations of a non-criminal nature, minor civil cases such as simple divorces, some property cases, disputes over land, and some labor cases, as well as some federal administrative law cases.

The magistrates are the only judges of the regional level within the judiciary of Russia. All other courts, including the district courts, are federal, as they are financed from the federal budget and their judges are appointed by the president of Russia, while the magistrates are financed from the regional budgets and are usually appointed by regional legislatures or elected by the population of a judicial district .

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, &quot;magistrate&quot; is a designation for the persons holding the most senior executive and judicial offices. On the federal level, the members of the Federal Council, the Federal Chancellor, and the judges on the Federal Supreme Court are called magistrates. The designation of magistrate is not a title or style. It does not, by itself, confer any particular privileges.

===Siam===
In Siam, the position of &quot;yakkrabutr&quot; (ยกกระบัตร) is similar to that of the &quot;magistrate&quot; and was given to palace officials sent to provincial capitals to administers law and ensure justice on behalf of the monarch. The position was phased out and reformed into the position of &quot;prosecutor&quot; in 1916 during the reign of Rama VI.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, there are five categories of magistrates, namely resident magistrate, senior resident magistrate, principal magistrate, senior principal magistrate and chief magistrate. Chief magistrate is the highest ranking among magistrates and also assumes administrative control of magistrate courts in his or her jurisdiction. A chief magistrate has jurisdiction in a dispute that does not exceed seven million Kenya shillings. For senior principal magistrates, the limit is in disputes not exceeding five million Kenya shillings; for principal magistrates it is disputes not exceeding four million Kenya shillings. Senior resident magistrates have jurisdiction in disputes not exceeding three million Kenya shillings and resident magistrates in disputes not exceeding two million Kenya shillings.

==In popular culture==
* The British humorist P.G. Wodehouse wrote in one of his &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; stories, &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot; (1955), &quot;Well, you know what magistrates are. The lowest form of pond life. When a fellow hasn&#x27;t the brains and initiative to sell jellied eels, they make him a magistrate.&quot; Bertie Wooster often appeared before magistrates when he was arrested for minor offences.
* A plump and foolish magistrate is a key character in Amy Tan&#x27;s children&#x27;s book (and the related PBS television show) &quot;Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat&quot;.
* In the post-colonial novel &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot; by J. M. Coetzee, the story is told from the narrative perspective of the magistrate of one of the settlements in what is presumed to be Africa.
* In the Walt Disney movie &quot;Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier&quot;, Crockett is appointed magistrate of the local community.
* Magistrates appear in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe as well. On &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, Constable Odo often threatens detainees or those he suspects are guilty of various crimes and violations that he will send them to the magistrate, or tells them sarcastically, in response to their pleas of innocence, to &quot;Tell it to the magistrate.&quot;
* In the first installment of the popular &quot;StarCraft&quot; real-time strategy series, one plays as a magistrate working for the Confederacy, a cruel government. One later joins the Sons of Korhal, aiding in the rebellion.
* In the videogame series &quot;Ace Attorney&quot;, there is a fictional children&#x27;s television show called &quot;The Steel Samurai&quot;, which is referenced in many cases. The main antagonist of the show is the Evil Magistrate.

<text>Jamaica is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. It has a popular large commercial and retail area, though part of the neighborhood is also residential. Jamaica is bordered by Hollis, St Albans, and Cambria Heights to the east; South Jamaica, Rochdale Village, John F. Kennedy International Airport, and Springfield Gardens to the south; Laurelton and Rosedale to the southeast; Richmond Hill, South Ozone Park, and Aqueduct Racetrack to the west and southwest; Briarwood to the northwest; and Kew Gardens Hills, Jamaica Hills, and Jamaica Estates to the north.

Jamaica&#x27;s original designation was for an area greater than the current neighborhoods, and was settled under Dutch rule in 1656. It was originally called &quot;&quot;. Under English rule, Jamaica became the center of the &quot;Town of Jamaica&quot;; the name is of Lenape origin and wholly unrelated to that of the country. It was the first county seat of Queens County, holding that title from 1683 to 1788, and was the first incorporated village on Long Island. When Queens was incorporated into the City of Greater New York in 1898, both the town of Jamaica and the village of Jamaica were dissolved, but the neighborhood of Jamaica regained its role as county seat.

Jamaica is the location of several government buildings such as Queens Civil Court, the civil branch of the Queens County Supreme Court, the Queens County Family Court and the Joseph P. Addabbo Federal Building, home to the Social Security Administration&#x27;s Northeastern Program Service Center. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s Northeast Regional Laboratory as well as the New York District Office are located in Jamaica. Jamaica Center, the area around Jamaica Avenue, is a major commercial center. The New York Racing Association, based at Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park, lists its official address as Jamaica (central Jamaica once housed the Jamaica Racetrack, now the massive Rochdale Village housing development). John F. Kennedy International Airport and the hotels nearby are also located in Jamaica. The neighborhood is located in Queens Community District 12. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 103rd and 113th Precincts.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===

The neighborhood was named &quot;Yameco&quot;, a corruption of the word &quot;yamecah&quot;, meaning &quot;beaver&quot;, in the language spoken by the Lenape, the Native Americans who lived in the area at the time of first European contact. The semivowel &quot;y&quot; sound of English is spelled with a &quot;j&quot; in Dutch, the language of the first people to write about the area; the English retained the Dutch spelling but replaced the semivowel sound with the affricate [dʒ] sound that the letter &quot;j&quot; usually represents in English. The name of the Caribbean island country Jamaica is unrelated, coming from the Taíno term &quot;Xaymaca&quot;, meaning &quot;land of wood and water&quot; or &quot;land of springs&quot;; the &quot;x&quot; spelling became a hard &quot;j&quot;.

=== Precolonial and colonial periods ===
Jamaica Avenue was an ancient trail for tribes from as far away as the Ohio River and the Great Lakes, coming to trade skins and furs for wampum. It was in 1655 that the first settlers paid the Native Americans with two guns, a coat, and some powder and lead, for the land lying between the old trail and &quot;Beaver Pond&quot; (now filled in; what is now Tuckerton Street north of Liberty Avenue runs through the site of the old pond, and Beaver Road was named for its western edge). Dutch Director-General Peter Stuyvesant dubbed the area &quot;&quot; (&quot;rest-town&quot;) in granting the 1656 land patent. Among its founding settlers was Robert Coe, who was appointed as the first magistrate by the Dutch government, serving until the English took over in 1664, making it a part of the county of Yorkshire.

In 1683, when the Crown divided the colony of New York into counties, Jamaica became the county seat of Queens County, one of the original counties of New York.

Colonial Jamaica had a band of 56 minutemen who played an active part in the Battle of Long Island, the outcome of which led to the occupation of the New York City area by British troops during most of the American Revolutionary War. Rufus King, a signer of the United States Constitution, relocated to Jamaica in 1805. He added to a modest 18th-century farmhouse, creating the manor which stands on the site today; King Manor was restored at the turn of the 21st century to its former glory, and houses King Manor Museum.

=== Late 18th and 19th centuries ===
By 1776, Jamaica had become a trading post for farmers and their produce. For more than a century, their horse-drawn carts plodded along Jamaica Avenue, then called King&#x27;s Highway. The Jamaica Post Office opened September 25, 1794, and was the only post office in the present-day boroughs of Queens or Brooklyn before 1803. Union Hall Academy for boys and Union Hall Seminary for girls were chartered in 1787. The academy eventually attracted students from all over the United States and the West Indies. The public school system was started in 1813 with funds of $125. Jamaica Village, the first village on Long Island, was incorporated in 1814 with its boundaries being from the present-day Van Wyck Expressway (on the west) and Jamaica Avenue (on the north, later Hillside Avenue) to Farmers Boulevard (on the east) and Linden Boulevard (on the south) in what is now St. Albans. By 1834, the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad company had completed a line to Jamaica.

In 1850, the former Kings Highway (now Jamaica Avenue) became the Brooklyn and Jamaica Plank Road, complete with toll gate. In 1866, tracks were laid for a horsecar line, and 20 years later it was electrified, the first in the state. On January 1, 1898, Queens became part of the City of New York, and Jamaica became the county seat.


=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
The present Jamaica station of the Long Island Rail Road was completed in 1913, and the BMT Jamaica Line arrived in 1918, followed by the IND Queens Boulevard Line in 1936 and the IND/BMT Archer Avenue lines in 1988, the latter of which replaced the eastern portion of the Jamaica Line that was torn down in 1977–85. The 1920s and 1930s saw the building of the Valencia Theatre (now restored by the Tabernacle of Prayer), the &quot;futuristic&quot; Kurtz furniture store, and the Roxanne Building. In the 1970s, it became the headquarters for the Islamic Society of North America. King Kullen opened in 1930, the first self-service supermarket in the country.

The many foreclosures and the high level of unemployment of the 2000s and early 2010s induced many black people to move from Jamaica to the South, as part of the New Great Migration. On October 23, 2014, the neighborhood was the site of a terrorist hatchet attack on two New York City Police Department officers; the police later killed the attacker.

The First Reformed Church, Grace Episcopal Church Complex, Jamaica Chamber of Commerce Building, Jamaica Savings Bank, King Manor, J. Kurtz and Sons Store Building, La Casina, Office of the Register, Prospect Cemetery, St. Monica&#x27;s Church, Sidewalk Clock at 161-11 Jamaica Avenue, New York, NY, Trans World Airlines Flight Center, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Demographics ==

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Jamaica was 53,751 an increase of 1,902 (3.5%) from the 51,849 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 3.6% (1,949) Non-Hispanic White, 22.2% (11,946) Black or African American, 0.9% (466) Native American, 24.3% (13,073) Asian, 0.1% (66) Pacific Islander, 5.2% (2,814) from other races, and 4.9% (2,647) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 38.7% (20,790) of the population.

The entirety of Community Board 12, which mainly comprises Jamaica but also includes Hollis, had 232,911 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 80.5 years. This is slightly lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 22% are between ages 0 and 17; 27% between 25 and 44; and 27% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 14% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community Board 12 was $61,670. In 2018, an estimated 20% of Jamaica and Hollis residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. One in eight residents (12%) were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 56% in Jamaica and Hollis, higher than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Jamaica and Hollis are considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

===Demographic distribution===

The borough of Queens is one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the world. Jamaica is large and has a diverse population, predominantly African Americans, Caribbean/West Indians, Hispanics, and Asians/Asian Indians.

Jamaica was not always as diverse as it is today. Throughout the 19th to early 20th centuries, Jamaica was mainly populated with whites as Irish immigrants settled around the places known today as Downtown and Baisley Pond Park. In the 1950s, however, a long period of white flight began that lasted through the 1970s and 1980s with mainly middle-income African Americans taking their place. Beginning in 1965 and through the 1970s, more West Indians immigrated to the United States than ever before, most of whom settled in New York City. Many Salvadoran, Colombian, and Dominican immigrants moved in. These ethnic groups tended to stay more towards the Jamaica Avenue and South Jamaica areas. Decrease in crime attracted many families to Jamaica&#x27;s safe havens; Hillside Avenue reflects this trend. Along 150th to 161st streets, much of the stores and restaurants typify South American and Caribbean cultures.

Farther east is the rapidly growing East Indian community. Mainly spurred on by the Jamaica Muslim Center, Bangladeshis have flocked to this area due to easy transit access and the numerous Bangladeshi stores and restaurants lining 167th and 168th Streets. Bangladeshis are the most rapidly growing ethnic group; however, it is also an African-American commercial area. Many Sri Lankans live in the area for similar reasons as the Bangladeshi community, reflected by the numerous food and grocery establishments along Hillside Avenue catering to the community. Significant Filipino and African communities thrive in Jamaica, along with the neighboring Filipino community in Queens Village and the historic, well established African-American community residing in Jamaica.

From 151st Street to 164th Street, many groceries and restaurants are representative of the West Indies. Mainly of Guyanese and Trinidadian origin, these merchants serve their respective populations in and around the Jamaica Center area. Many East Indian shops are located east from 167th Street to 171st Street. Mainly supported by the ever-growing Bangladeshi population, thousands of South Asians come here to shop for Bangladeshi goods. Some people call the area &quot;Little South Asia&quot; similar to that of Jackson Heights. Jamaica is another South Asian ethnic enclave in New York City, as South Asian immigration and the city&#x27;s South Asian population has grown rapidly.

== Economy ==

=== History ===
Economic development was long neglected. In the 1960s and 1970s, many big box retailers moved to suburban areas where business was more profitable. Departing retailers included brand name stores and movie theaters that once thrived in Jamaica&#x27;s busiest areas. Macy&#x27;s and the Valencia theater were the last companies to move out in 1969. The 1980s crack epidemic created even more hardship and crime. Prime real estate spaces were filled by hair salons and 99 cent stores. Furthermore, existing zoning patterns and inadequate infrastructure did not anticipate future development.

Since then, the decrease of the crime rate has encouraged entrepreneurs who plan to invest in the area. The Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, the local business improvement district, acquired valuable real estate for sale to national chains in order to expand neighborhood commerce. As well they have completed underway proposals by allocating funds and providing loans to potential investors who have already established something in the area. One Jamaica Center is a mixed-use commercial complex that was built in 2002. Many banks have at least one branch along various major streets: Jamaica Avenue, Parsons Boulevard, Merrick Boulevard, and Sutphin Boulevard. In 2006, a $75 million deal between the developers, the Mattone Group and Ceruzzi Enterprises, and Home Depot cleared the way for a new location at 168th Street and Archer Avenue.

The most prominent piece of development has been the renovation and expansion of the Jamaica station from 2001 to 2006. The station, which served the Long Island Rail Road, was expanded with a transfer to the AirTrain JFK to John F. Kennedy International Airport. A further capacity increase included a platform at Jamaica station.

Efforts have been made to follow the examples of major redevelopment occurring in Astoria, Long Island City, Flushing, and Downtown Brooklyn. In 2005, the New York City Department of City Planning drafted a plan that would rezone 368 blocks of Jamaica in order to stimulate development, relieve traffic congestion, and shift upscale amenities away from low-density residential neighborhoods. The plan includes up-zoning the immediate areas around Jamaica Station to accommodate passengers traveling through the area. To improve infrastructure the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation has agreed to create more greenery and open spaces to allow pedestrians to enjoy the scenery. At the same time, the city has reserved the right to protect the suburban/residential charm of neighboring areas. Several blocks will be down-zoned to keep up with the existing neighborhood character. In 2007 the City Council overwhelmingly approved the plan, providing for structures of up to 28 stories to be built around the main transit hub as well as residential buildings of up to 7 stories to be built on Hillside Avenue.

According to real-estate listing service StreetEasy, Jamaica&#x27;s real-estate prices are rising the fastest out of all localities in New York City. The community&#x27;s median home prices rose 39% in 2015. The median sales price for a small row house in 2015 was $330,000, and the median asking rent for a three-bedroom house in 2015 was $1,750. Sutphin Boulevard has been described as &quot;the next tourist hot spot&quot;. Jamaica&#x27;s proximity to the JFK AirTrain has stimulated the development of several hotels. The 165th Street Mall Improvement Association is a NYC BID Association that focuses on these specific developed stores in Jamaica, Queens.

=== Notable businesses ===

The Federal Aviation Administration Eastern Region has its offices at Rockaway Boulevard in South Jamaica, near JFK Airport. Several businesses are at the nearby John F. Kennedy International Airport. North American Airlines has its headquarters on the property of JFK. Nippon Cargo Airlines maintains its New York City offices there. 

The Northeastern Program Service Center (NEPSC) is located in the Joseph P. Addabbo Federal Building at Parsons Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue. The NEPSC serves approximately 8.6 million retirement, survivor, and disability insurance beneficiaries, whose Social Security numbers (SSN) begin with 001 through 134, 729, and 805 through 808. The NEPSC also processes disability claims for beneficiaries age 54 and over for the same SSN series. Constructed in 1989, the federal building is a 12-story masonry and steel office structure that was built for the agency and was given $8.5 million 2017 dollars to consolidate operations to the lower 2 floors and bring other federal leaseholders from other parts of Queens to occupy the upper floors. The funds approved were part of budget cuts proposed during the Obama administration.

==Police and crime==

<text>The Storm Shadow is a Franco-British low-observable, long-range air-launched cruise missile developed since 1994 by Matra and British Aerospace, and now manufactured by MBDA. &quot;Storm Shadow&quot; is the weapon&#x27;s British name; in France it is called SCALP-EG (which stands for &quot;Système de Croisière Autonome à Longue Portée – Emploi Général&quot;; English: &quot;Long Range Autonomous Cruise Missile System – General Purpose&quot;). The missile is based on the French-developed Apache anti-runway cruise missile, but differs in that it carries a unitary warhead instead of cluster munitions.

To meet the requirement issued by the French Ministry of Defence for a more potent cruise missile capable of being launched from surface vessels and submarines, and able to strike strategic and military targets from extended standoff ranges with even greater precision, MBDA France began development of the &quot;Missile de Croisière Naval&quot; (&quot;Naval Cruise Missile&quot;) or &quot;MdCN&quot; in 2006 to complement the SCALP. The first firing test took place in July 2013 and was successful. The MdCN has been operational on French FREMM frigates since 2017 and also equips France&#x27;s Barracuda nuclear attack submarines, which entered operational service in 2022.

In 2017, a joint contract to upgrade the respective Storm Shadow/SCALP stockpiles in French and British service was signed. It is expected to sustain the missile until its planned withdrawal from service in 2032.

Since 2023, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Storm Shadow missiles have been supplied to Ukraine in large quantities. Multiple Russian ships have been either sunk or heavily damaged by them. 

France, the UK and Italy are together developing the Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapon (FC/ASW) to replace SCALP/Storm Shadow and each nation&#x27;s respective anti-ship missiles by 2028 and 2034.

==Characteristics==
The missile weighs about , with a conventional warhead of . It has a maximum body diameter of and a wingspan of . It is propelled at Mach 0.8 by a Microturbo TRI 60-30 turbojet engine and has a range of approximately .

The weapon can be launched from a number of different aircraft—the Saab Gripen, Dassault Mirage 2000, Dassault Rafale, the Panavia Tornado, both the Italian Tornado IDS and formerly the British Tornado GR4 (now retired), and a modified Sukhoi Su-24. Storm Shadow was integrated with the Eurofighter Typhoon as part of the Phase 2 Enhancement (P2E) in 2015, but will not be fitted to the F-35 Lightning II.

The Storm Shadow&#x27;s BROACH warhead features an initial penetrating charge to clear soil or enter a bunker, then a variable delay fuze to control detonation of the main warhead. Intended targets are command, control and communications centres; airfields; ports and power stations; ammunition management and storage facilities; surface ships and submarines in port; bridges and other high value strategic targets.

The missile is fire and forget, programmed before launch. Once launched, it cannot be controlled or commanded to self-destroy and its target information cannot be changed. Mission planners programme the weapon with details of the target and its air defences. The missile follows a path semi-autonomously, on a low flight path guided by GPS and terrain mapping to the target area. Close to the target, the missile climbs to increase its field of view and improve penetration, matches the target stored image with its IR camera and then dives into the target.

Climbing to altitude is intended to achieve the best probability of target identification and penetration. During the final maneuver, the nose cone is jettisoned to allow a high resolution thermographic camera (infrared homing) to observe the target area. The missile then tries to locate its target based upon its targeting information (DSMAC). If it cannot, and there is a high risk of collateral damage, the missile is capable of flying to a crash point instead of risking inaccuracy.

Enhancements reported in 2005 included the capability to relay target information just before impact and usage of one-way (link back) data link to relay battle damage assessment information back to the host aircraft, under development under a French DGA contract. At the time, inflight re-targeting capability using a two-way data link was planned. In 2016, it was announced that Storm Shadow would be refurbished under the Selective Precision Effects At Range 4 (SPEAR 4) missile project, with the upgrade being completed in 2022.

Some reports suggest a reduced capability version complying with Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) restrictions was created for export, for example to the United Arab Emirates.

The missile relies on classified US-owned cartographic data, using Terrain Contour Matching or TERCOM, to guide the missile to the target. This gives the US government veto of any sales to foreign countries under ITAR. In 2018 the French government tried to bypass this by creating a &quot;ITAR-free&quot; version of the missile for sale to Egypt that didn&#x27;t use TERCOM. The missiles would have relied solely on GPS and inertial navigation systems to get to the target, making the missile more vulnerable to electronic warfare. An issue in Ukraine, where Russian jams GPS signals, is that US approval and data is necessary for the missiles to operate to peak performance.

==History==
Matra and British Aerospace were selected as the prime contractors for the Conventionally Armed Standoff Missile (CASOM) in July 1996; their Storm Shadow missile beat submissions from McDonnell Douglas, Texas Instruments/Short Brothers, Hughes/Smiths Industries, Daimler-Benz Aerospace/Bofors, GEC-Marconi and Rafael. The Storm Shadow design was based on Matra&#x27;s Apache anti-runway cruise missile. A development and production contract was signed in February 1997, by which time Matra and BAe had completed the merger of their missile businesses to form Matra BAe Dynamics. France ordered 500 SCALP missiles in January 1998.

The first successful fully guided firing of the Storm Shadow/SCALP EG took place at the CEL Biscarosse range in France at the end of December 2000 from a Mirage 2000N.

The first flight of Storm Shadow missiles on the Eurofighter Typhoon took place on 27 November 2013 at Decimomannu Air Base in Italy, and was performed by Alenia Aermacchi using instrumented production aircraft 2.

The SCALP EG and Storm Shadow are identical except for how they integrate with the aircraft.

In July 2016, the UK&#x27;s MoD awarded a £28 million contract to support the Storm Shadow over the next five years.

===Combat use===

RAF Tornados used Storm Shadow missiles operationally for the first time during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Although they were yet to officially enter service, &quot;an accelerated testing schedule&quot; saw them employed by the RAF&#x27;s 617 Squadron in the conflict.

During the 2011 military intervention in Libya, the Storm Shadow/SCALP-EG was fired at pro-Gaddafi targets by French Air Force Rafales and Italian Air Force and Royal Air Force Tornados. Targets included the Al Jufra Air Base, and a military bunker in Sirte, the home town of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. In December 2011, Italian defence officials noted that Italian Tornado IDS aircraft had fired between 20 and 30 Storm Shadows during the Libyan Campaign. This was the first time that Italian aircraft had fired the missile in live combat, and it was reported the missile had a 97 per cent success rate.

French aircraft fired 12 SCALP missiles at ISIS targets in Syria as part of Operation Chammal. These launches took place on 15 December 2015 and 2 January 2016. It is thought that these firings may have been approved after a decision by the French MoD to reduce their inventory of SCALP missiles to reduce costs. On Sunday 26 June 2016 the RAF used four Storm Shadow missiles against an ISIS bunker in Iraq. The Storm Shadow missiles were launched from two Tornado aircraft. All four missiles scored direct hits, penetrating deep into the bunker. Storm Shadow missiles were used due to the bunker&#x27;s massive construction.

In October 2016 the UK Government confirmed UK-supplied missiles were used by Saudi Arabia in the conflict in Yemen.

In April 2018 the UK Government announced they used Storm Shadow missiles deployed by Panavia Tornado GR4s to strike a chemical weapon facility in Syria. According to US Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility near Homs was hit by 9 US Tomahawks, 8 British Storm Shadows, 3 French MdCN cruise missiles, and 2 French SCALP cruise missiles. Satellite images showed that the site was destroyed in the attack. The Pentagon said that no missiles had been intercepted, and that the raids were &quot;precise and overwhelming&quot;. In response, the Russian Ministry of Defence, during a press conference in Moscow, presented parts of what they claimed was a downed Storm Shadow missile.

It has been suggested that Storm Shadows, deployed by either Emirati Mirage 2000s or Egyptian Rafales, could have been used in the July 2020 airstrike against Al-Watiya Air Base during the Second Libyan Civil War. The attack against the base, which housed Turkish military personnel supporting the internationally recognized Government of National Accord, injured several Turkish soldiers, destroyed their MIM-23 Hawk anti-aircraft missiles systems and their KORAL electronic warfare system.

On 11 March 2021, two Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4 jets operating out of RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus hit a cave complex south west of the city of Erbil in northern Iraq, where a significant number of ISIS fighters were reported, marking the first combat use of the Storm Shadow from the Typhoon.

=== Use by Ukraine ===
On 11 May 2023, the United Kingdom announced that it was supplying Storm Shadows to the Ukrainian military during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This followed a pledge from the UK in February 2023 to send Ukraine long-range missiles in response to Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukraine has insisted it would not use such weapons on Russian territory. UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace emphasized the delivery as a &quot;calibrated, proportionate response to Russia&#x27;s escalation&quot;, noting Russian use of even longer-range munitions including the Kh-47M2 hypersonic missile, 3M-54 Kalibr cruise missile, and Shahed-136 one-way attack drone.

The grant of Storm Shadow missiles is a significant boost to the Ukrainian military, as they are capable of striking targets at much longer ranges than had previously been possible, including command-and-control nodes and logistics points in occupied Crimea to interrupt Russia&#x27;s ability to support the frontline. Shortly after, France announced it would be delivering the SCALP EG, its version of the missile, to Ukraine as well. France said it was not delivering weapons capable of hitting Russian soil. The UK on 18 May confirmed Ukraine had already successfully used the Storm Shadow. Although no information was publicly disclosed regarding when exactly the French missiles were delivered to Ukraine, Ukraine&#x27;s ambassador to France, Vadym Omelchenko, confirmed in an interview with LB.ua on 22 August 2023 that all SCALP missiles promised by French president Emmanuel Macron had been delivered already, likely by the time of the latter&#x27;s announcement in May. Omelchenko further stated that the first batch of missiles (reported by some outlets to number 50 units) had more than proven its worth and that supplies of SCALP batches by France would continue. Previously, on August 6, a few days after the attack on the Chongar Strait railway bridge, the SCALP&#x27;s operational status in Ukraine had visually been confirmed as were its use in the attack and its successful integration to Ukrainian Su-24 bombers.
Russia claimed Ukraine used Storm Shadow missiles to strike industrial sites in Luhansk on 13 May 2023, just two days after their delivery had been announced. According to a report by Russian news outlet Izvestia, the cruise missiles are launched from specially modified Su-24 strike aircraft and fly under the cover of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters equipped with AGM-88 HARMs. Ukrainian command also uses UAVs and ADM-160 MALD decoys to divert Russian air defenses and protect the aircraft and ordnance from being intercepted. Ukraine&#x27;s Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov confirmed the Su-24 as the Ukrainian Air Force&#x27;s Storm Shadow launch platform, tweeting a photo of a Su-24MR with a missile on each of its inboard underwing pylons. The pylons use an adaptor derived from retired RAF Tornado GR4 aircraft.

Reznikov said at the end of May that the missiles had hit 100% of their targets, although Russia&#x27;s Defence Ministry has claimed to have shot some down.

On 12 June, a strike which involved the Storm Shadow killed Major General Sergey Goryachev in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. At the time he was Chief of Staff of the 35th Combined Arms Army. On 22 June, the Chonhar road bridge connecting Crimea with Kherson Oblast was struck by a Storm Shadow missile to interrupt Russian logistics. A largely intact Storm Shadow crashed in Zaporizhzhia in early July. TASS claimed Russian forces had shot it down and recovered the wreckage to study the missile&#x27;s design and help develop countermeasures to it.

On 9 July 2023, Storm Shadow/SCALP missile was shot down by Russian air defence and captured later.

On 29 July 2023, a Storm Shadow or SCALP missile hit the Chongar Strait railway bridge linking occupied Crimea with the Kherson Oblast, landing between the two tracks on the bridge approach.

On 13 September 2023, Storm Shadow and/or SCALP missiles were used in a strike against the Sevastopol port, seriously damaging the &quot;Rostov na Donu&quot; submarine and seriously damaging (according to some sources, beyond repair) the Ropucha-class landing ship &quot;Minsk&quot;.

On 22 September 2023, at least three Storm Shadow and/or SCALP missiles hit the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. According to the Ukraine military, the missile attack targeted a meeting of the Russian Navy&#x27;s leadership. &quot;After the hit of the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, 34 officers were killed, including the commander of the Russian Black Sea Fleet&quot;, they said. While no confirmation of Sokolov&#x27;s alleged death is known, neither has any reliable source depicted him as alive and well since the attack took place. They also claimed that the strike wounded at least 100 other Russian service personnel.

On 26 December 2023 it is believed two Storm Shadow and/or SCALP missiles were launched against the Russian occupied port of Feodosia with the Russian landing ship Novocherkassk being hit and turned into a burning wreck.

At a news conference on 28 May 2024, French President Macron said he permitted Ukraine to use SCALP missiles to strike targets inside Russia, a major departure from previous guidelines that restricted the use of foreign-supplied weapons only to occupied territory. This expansion of use is still restricted to neutralization of military facilities being used for attacks into Ukraine.

In July 2024, the British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that the British government would allow the defensive use of Storm Shadow missiles on targets inside Russia.

On 25 September 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the West that if attacked with conventional weapons Russia would consider a nuclear retaliation, in an apparent deviation from the no first use doctrine. Putin went on to threaten nuclear powers that if they supported another country&#x27;s attack on Russia, then they would be considered participants in such an aggression. Experts say Putin&#x27;s announcement is aimed at dissuading the United States, the United Kingdom and France from allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied long-range missiles such as the ATACMS and Storm Shadow in strikes against Russia.

On 20 November 2024, Ukraine was reported to have fired British Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for the first time.
The use of Storm Shadow missiles comes after Russia launched a counteroffensive in Kursk, which was invaded by Ukrainian troops in August. It also follows the Biden administration&#x27;s decision to give Ukraine the green light to use US-made long-range missiles inside Russia earlier this week. Kyiv first used ATACMS to strike a military facility in Bryansk early on 19 November.
It was later reported that the 20 November strikes had hit an underground military facility in Maryino, Kursk Oblast, allegedly killing Russian general Lt-Gen Valery Solodchuk, some other Russian officers, and North Korean troops. Russian authorities did not confirm the losses and there has been no independent verification yet.

==Export variant==

===Black Shaheen===
Developed by France for export to the United Arab Emirates for use with its Mirage 2000, modifications were made to reduce the range reportedly to in order to comply with Missile Technology Control Regime guidelines.

==MdCN==

In 2006, MBDA France began the development of a more potent deep strike naval cruise missile to be deployed on a new series of French warships and submarines for land-attack operations in order to complement the SCALP/Storm Shadow. This Missile de Croisière Naval (MdCN), formerly dubbed &quot;SCALP Naval&quot;, became operational on the French FREMM multipurpose frigates in 2017 and on s in June 2022, using the A70 version of the Sylver launcher on the former and the 533 mm torpedo tubes on the latter. As it is not launched from a plane like the SCALP, the MdCN uses a booster during its launch phase to break out of the ship and gain some initial velocity.

Despite the fact that it was previously called SCALP Naval, it is not a variant of the Storm Shadow, has no stealth shaping, but is a more conventional, longer range sea-launched cruise missile, very similar to Tomahawk.

== Replacement ==

Between 2016 and 2018, France and the United Kingdom began jointly developing a replacement for Storm Shadow/SCALP for both the French Air and Space Force and the Royal Air Force, as well as the Exocet and Harpoon anti-ship missiles for the French Navy and Royal Navy. As of 2022, the programme was examining two complementary concepts; a subsonic, low observable missile and a supersonic, highly manoeuvrable missile. On 20 June 2023 at the Paris Air Show, Italy signed a letter of intent to join the programme. Italy confirmed its initial funding contribution in November and this also came with the announcement that the programme would produce a deep-strike land-attack missile by 2028 and an anti-ship missile by 2034.

<text>Stellar radio sources, radio source stars or radio stars are stellar objects that produce copious emissions of various radio frequencies, whether constant or pulsed. Radio emissions from stars can be produced in many varied ways.

==Among neutron stars==
Pulsars, a type of neutron star, are examples of radio stars. &quot;Rotation-powered pulsars&quot; are, as the name suggests, powered by the slow-down of their rotation. The rotation powers a magnetic field, which generates the radio emissions. Not all rotation-powered pulsars generate their pulses in the radio spectrum. Some of them, from the millisecond pulsars, generate X-rays instead. Aside from radio pulsars and X-ray pulsars, there are also gamma ray pulsars, which are mostly magnetars. Some radio pulsars are also optical pulsars.

Aside from pulsars, another type of neutron star is also characterized by radio emissions: the rotating radio transient (RRAT). As suggested by the name, the radio emission is erratic.

==Quasars are not radio stars==
Quasars (quasi-stellar radio sources) are not radio stars. They also emit radio frequencies, but from the effects of supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies. Although they appear to be stars, they are not stars, but the hyperactive heart of a galaxy.

==By other stellar objects==
;Astrophysical masers
Some late-type stars can produce astrophysical masers from their atmospheres and beam out coherent bursts of microwaves.

;The Sun
The Sun, the nearest star to Earth, is known to emit radio waves, though it is virtually the only regular star that has been detected in the radio spectrum, because it is so close. It is not considered a radio star because it is not a strong radio source.

;Main-sequence stars in general
Some studies have found that main-sequence stars may extremely rarely emit radio waves. A 2009 survey found a maximum of 112 candidate radio stars cross-matching the FIRST and NVSS surveys, but estimated that 108 ± 13 of the samples are from &quot;contamination&quot; from background sources. They estimate that less than 1.2 in 1 million stars between an apparent magnitude of 15 and 19.1 emit more than 1.25 mJy in the 21-centimeter band.

;Fast radio bursts

Fast radio bursts (FRB) are hypothesized to originate from extra-galactic sources. These bright, brief emissions of ~1 GHz radio occur at the rate of 104 per day across the sky, and no emission counterparts have been found in other bands. An alternative scenario is that FRBs are emitted as the result of flare activity on nearby stars within a kiloparsec of the Sun. This would make it easier to explain the luminosity of these events.

;Red dwarfs
In 2020, 10 days before reports about BLC1 – reported to be an apparent possible radio signal from Proxima Centauri, astronomers reported &quot;a bright, long-duration optical flare, accompanied by a series of intense, coherent radio bursts&quot; from the nearest star to the Sun. They state that it constitutes the &quot;most compelling detection of a solar-like radio burst from another star to date&quot; and strongly indicates a causal relationship between these emissions.

Like BLC1, the signal was recorded in April and May 2019. Despite this, their finding has not been put in direct relation to the BLC1 signal by scientists or media outlets as of January 2021 but implies that planets around Proxima Centauri and other red dwarfs are likely to be rather uninhabitable for humans and other currently known organisms.

<text>ALARM (Air Launched Anti-Radiation Missile) is a British anti-radiation missile designed primarily to destroy enemy radars for the purpose of Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD). It was used by the RAF and is still used by the Royal Saudi Air Force. The weapon was retired by the UK at the end of 2013.

== History ==
The Ministry of Defence received offers for a new anti-radiation missile in late 1982; British Aerospace Dynamics offered ALARM while Texas Instruments teamed with Lucas Aerospace offered its HARM missile. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine announced the selection of ALARM on 29 July 1983. The initial order was 750 missiles for the RAF. The selection process was controversial; the battle between the contractors was bitter, the Ministry of Defence favoured ALARM to retain UK industrial capabilities while the Treasury favoured the cheaper and proven HARM.

In early 1986, BAe recognised that Royal Ordnance was having difficulties delivering the missile&#x27;s motor, named Nuthatch, and began to consider alternatives. Royal Ordnance&#x27;s solution to the required burn-loiter-burn characteristic of the engine was complex. In July 1987, BAe, by then the owner of Royal Ordnance, replaced the Nuthatch motor with a lower risk motor designed by Bayern-Chemie. BAe&#x27;s £200 million contract for the missile was renegotiated with the price increased to £400 million and delivery pushed back from 1988 to 1990. The radar seeker was made by Marconi Space and Defence Systems (GEC) at Stanmore.

The ALARM missile was officially retired by the UK at the end of 2013, but continued to be used by the Saudis.

==Features==
ALARM is a fire-and-forget system, with an added loiter capability. In loiter mode, ALARM will, when launched, climb to an altitude of . If the target radar shuts down, the missile will deploy a parachute and descend slowly until the radar lights up. The missile will then fire a secondary motor to attack the target.

==Combat use==
ALARM has been used in the following conflicts:
* 1991 Gulf War (Operation Granby), during which 121 missiles were used.
* Kosovo War (Operation Allied Force), during which 6 missiles were used.
* 2003 invasion of Iraq (Operation Telic), during which 47 missiles were used.
* 2011 Libya (Operation Ellamy).

<doc id="306913" wikidata="Q1087043" url="?curid=306913" title="Modding">
<text>Modding (from &quot;modifying&quot;) is the act of modifying hardware, software, or anything else to perform a function not originally intended by the designer, or to achieve bespoke specification or appearance. The term is often used in reference to video game modding, particularly in regard to creating new or altered content and sharing that via the web. It may be applied to the overclocking of computers in order to increase the frequency at which the CPU operates. Case modding is a popular activity amongst many computer enthusiasts which involves the customization of a computer case or the installation of water cooling technology. In connection with automobiles, modding can connote engine tuning, remapping of a vehicle&#x27;s engine control unit or customization of the coachwork.

== Computers and digital equipment ==

=== Legal issues ===
Modding may sometimes infringe the legal rights of the copyright owner. Some nations have laws prohibiting modding and accuse modders of attempting to overcome copy protection schemes. In the United States, the DMCA has set up stiff penalties for mods that violate the rights of intellectual property owners. In the European Union, member states have agreed the EU Copyright Directive and are transposing it into national law. A 22-year-old man was convicted by Caerphilly Magistrates&#x27; Court in the United Kingdom in July 2005 for selling a modded Xbox with built in software and games. However it is also worthy of note that some other European countries have not interpreted the legal issues in the same way. In Italy a judge threw out a Sony case saying it was up to owners of a console what they did with it. Similarly in Spain, mod chips have been ruled as legal despite the EU copyright legislation. Modding may be an unauthorized change made to a software or hardware to a platform in gaming. Case mods are modifications to a device with the altering of certain styles. For example, people who mod a Microsoft Xbox 360 can alter the LED lights on the controller to glow different colors.

On August 5, 2009, Matthew Crippen, a 27-year-old student at California State University, Fullerton, was arrested for modifying game consoles including the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Wii for profit. Crippen testified that it was so owners could play their backup discs of DRM-laden gaming software that they legally own. However, the DMCA states that it is illegal to circumvent copyright protection software, even for non-infringing uses such as backing up legally owned games. In December 2010 the prosecutors dropped all charges against Crippen because of inadmissible evidence obtained through an audio-less video recording deemed illegal by California law.

=== Video game consoles ===

A common example of one kind of modding is video game console mod chips, which can allow users to play homemade games, games legitimately purchased in other regions, or legal backup copies, but can also allow illegal unauthorized copies by allowing the player to play personally recorded CD or DVD copies of video games. Modchips, in their current form, were first available for the Sony PlayStation (and later the PlayStation 2). Various other types of copyright circumvention systems also existed for the Nintendo 64 and the older Game Boy consoles (though neither include actual modding, but instead backup devices).

==== Types of modding ====
There are two different ways of running unsigned code on a game console. One is through soft modding (modifying software, normally using a softmod) to allow the user to change data contained on its hard drive in the case of the Xbox. Another type of modding, known as hard modding, is done by modifying the hardware, such as components connected to the Hypervisor in order to run exploits to the BIOS of the console or to run unsigned code and games. This form of &#x27;modding&#x27; (more correctly termed as hacking), while not as popular as softmodding, is mostly done as it is able to &#x27;run&#x27; many different types of software. Soft modding is more popular because of its ease of installation and its relatively low price (it can even be done for free with the right tools).

Another type of console modding is about appearances, much like computer case modification. Which includes, adding lights (most likely LEDS, cathodes or other electro-luminescent lighting). Cutting the game system case, to fit hardware and/or expose the internal systems. Cooling is a large part of console hard &#x27;modding&#x27;, including: heat sink upgrades, more powerful or quieter fans, some even go so far as to abandon common heat exchange to air all together by liquid cooling a console (most notably in the Xbox 360, which initially had some heat problems).

=== Game software ===
On the other side, some companies actively encourage modding of their products. In cases such as TiVo and Google, there has been an informal agreement between the modders and the company in which the modders agree not to do anything that destroys the company&#x27;s business model and the company agrees to support the modding community by providing technical specifications and information. Some commercial video games thrive through a modding community. In the case of &quot;Half-Life&quot; and &quot;Warcraft III&quot;, mods called &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and &quot;Defense of the Ancients (DotA)&quot; respectively&quot;,&quot; drove sales of the original software for years.

=== Device drivers ===

Modded drivers are made for improved performance which official versions of drivers do not offer or in cases where there are no official versions of drivers for new hardware designed for older operating systems such as Windows 98.

=== Computer hardware ===
Case modding may range from simple case (or &quot;chassis&quot;) painting, to extensive case modifications with custom-fabricated pieces. The terms &quot;modding&quot; and &quot;modder&quot; have expanded to encompass a broad range of customization by personal-computer enthusiasts, especially in gaming PCs, including: custom and homemade hard- and soft-line liquid cooling loops; installation of LED strips and other lighting effects; replacement of stock cooling fans with high-performance ones (on CPU coolers, power supplies, cases, drive bays, and other components); &quot;delidding&quot; of CPUs and GPUs to replace their stock thermal paste and pads with high-thermal-conductivity ones; addition of individually sleeved (and often color-coordinated) cabling; replacement of various heat sinks with custom liquid-cooling water blocks on components normally air-cooled (e.g. RAM, GPUs, and SSDs); addition of new components not usually found in PCs, such as electronic timers or temperature and humidity alarms; custom soldering to replace or change the behavior of components; expansion of the motherboard&#x27;s capabilities with PCIe add-in cards and risers (the latter also used to mount graphics cards sideways to show them off better); addition of server hardware into a consumer-grade system; and extensive overclocking through detailed benchmarking that seeks to squeeze out every last percentage of performance improvement without the system becoming unstable.

== Cars and vehicles ==
=== Orthopedic ===

Ortho-modding is the car adaptation (seats, pedals, etc.) to help drivers to prevent, correct and diminish light orthopedic and backbone/spine problems.

=== Eco-modding ===

Eco-modding is the reduction of drag, petroleum car adaptation to use renewable energy (generally, changing or adding a new engine or motor), generally hydrogen or electricity. See hybrid car. Occasionally, it has been known to run a Diesel engine on plant and animal oils. See Biodiesel.

=== Performance tuning ===

Car and engine tuning are modification of a car for enhanced performance, in engine power output, handling, aerodynamics, or cosmetic purposes. See also :Category:Vehicle modification.

== Industrial machines ==
Factories get rather expensive machines that are used to mass-produce specialized parts. These machines can be altered to make parts other than how the manufacturers of the machines designed or intended them. The legality of doing this depends on who owns the machines, and whether the agreement, that supplied the machines to the factories, said anything about this, and what the laws are in the nation where this is being done.

For example, the machines might be leased from the manufacturer of the machines. If they are ever to be returned, they need to go back in the same kind of condition and engineering shape as when they were first delivered. There is an annual physical inventory to make sure the factory has everything that they are leasing. This audit might be done by representatives of the leasing company, who are looking to see recognizable machines, that match their models and safety rules.

== Pens ==
Pen-modding is the act of combining many pen parts either to help with pen spinning, in which a perfect balance is desired to create an ideal spinning pen, or simply for decoration. These pen mods can either be made by combining parts from different pens and/or mechanical pencils, or by buying modded pens online. In some cases, pen mods can exceed over $30–40 USD per pen.

<text>Kruger National Park () is a South African national park and one of the largest game reserves in Africa. It covers an area of in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in northeastern South Africa, and extends from north to south and from east to west. The administrative headquarters are in Skukuza. Areas of the park were first protected by the government of the South African Republic in 1898, and it became South Africa&#x27;s first national park in 1926.

To the west and south of the Kruger National Park are the two South African provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, respectively. To the north is Zimbabwe and to the east is Mozambique. It is now part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, a peace park that links Kruger National Park with the Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe, and with the Limpopo National Park in Mozambique.

The park is part of the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere, an area designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as an International Man and Biosphere Reserve.

== History ==
=== Sabi Game Reserve (1898–1926) ===
Sabi Game Reserve was initially created to control hunting and to protect the diminishing number of animals in the area. The reserve was located in the southern one-third of the modern park.
James Stevenson-Hamilton became the first warden of the reserve in 1902. Singwitsi Reserve, named after the Shingwedzi River and now in northern Kruger National Park, was proclaimed in 1903. During the following decades all the native tribes were removed from the reserve and during the 1960s the last were removed at Makuleke in the Pafuri triangle. In 1926, Sabi Game Reserve, the adjacent Shingwedzi Game Reserve, and farms were combined to create Kruger National Park.

During 1923, the first large groups of tourists started visiting the Sabi Game Reserve, but only as part of the South African Railways&#x27; popular &quot;Round in Nine&quot; tours. The tourist trains travelled the Selati railway line between Komatipoort on the Mozambican border and Tzaneen in the then northern Transvaal.

=== Kruger National Park ===

Kruger National Park was proclaimed in 1918 and a commission established to pursue its planning and development. The first secretary of the commission was 
Johannes Andries (Dries) de Ridder, a civil servant.
Warden James Stevenson-Hamilton retired on 30 April 1946, after 44 years as warden of the Kruger Park. He was replaced by Colonel J. A. B. Sandenbergh of the South African Air Force.
In 1959, work commenced to completely fence the park&#x27;s boundaries. Work started on the southern boundary along the Crocodile River and in 1960 the western and northern boundaries were fenced, followed by the eastern boundary with Mozambique. The purpose of the fence was to curb the spread of diseases, facilitate border patrolling and inhibit the movement of poachers.

The Makuleke area in the northern part of the park was forcibly taken from the Makuleke people by the government in 1969 and about 1500 of them were relocated to land to the south so that their original tribal areas could be integrated into the greater Kruger National Park.
In 1996 the Makuleke tribe submitted a land claim for , namely the Pafuri or Makuleke region in the northernmost part of the park. The land was given back to the Makuleke people, however, they chose not to resettle on the land but to engage with the private sector to invest in tourism. This resulted in the building of several game lodges from which they earn royalties.

In the late 1990s, the fences between the Kruger Park and Klaserie Game Reserve, Olifants Game Reserve, and Balule Nature Reserve were dropped and incorporated into the Greater Kruger Park with added to the Reserve. In 2002, Kruger National Park, Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe, and Limpopo National Park in Mozambique were incorporated into a peace park, the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park.

== Location and geography ==

The park lies in the northeast of South Africa, in the eastern parts of Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces. Phalaborwa, Limpopo is the only town in South Africa that borders the Kruger National Park. It is one of the largest national parks in the world, with an area of . The park is approximately long, and has an average width of . At its widest point, the park is wide from east to west.
To the north and south of the park two rivers, the Limpopo River and the Crocodile respectively, act as their natural boundaries. To the east, the Lebombo Mountains separate it from Mozambique. Its western boundary runs parallel with this range, roughly distant. The park varies in altitude between in the east and in the south-west near Berg-en-Dal. The highest point in the park is here, a hill called Khandzalive. Several rivers run through the park from west to east, including the Sabie, Olifants, Letaba and Luvuvhu while the Crocodile River (Mpumalanga) and Limpopo River run along the parks border.


The climate of the Kruger National Park and lowveld is subtropical/tropical, specifically a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;). Summer days are humid and hot. The rainy season is from September until May. The Kruger National Park website lists September and October as the driest periods, culminating at the beginning of the rainy season late in October. Because the park spans from north to south, climate can vary throughout the park. Skukuza in the southern part of the park is about cooler throughout the year than Pafuri in the north, with significantly more rainfall.

== Biodiversity ==

=== Vegetation ===
Plant life consists of four main areas, which correspond roughly to the four quadrants of the park. The main veld types are determined by the rainfall gradient (400 to 750 mm per annum) and geological substrates.

==== Shrub mopane veld ====
Shrub mopane covers almost the entire northeastern part of the park.

==== Red bush-willow and mopane veld ====
This area lies in the park&#x27;s western half, north of the Olifants River. The two most prominent species here are the red bush-willow (&quot;Combretum apiculatum&quot;) and the mopane tree (&quot;Colophospermum mopane&quot;).

==== Thorn trees and red bush-willow veld ====
This area lies between the western boundary and roughly the centre of the park south of the Olifants River. &quot;Combretums&quot;, such as the red bush-willow (&quot;Combretum apiculatum&quot;), and &quot;Acacia&quot; species predominate while there are a great number of marula trees (&quot;Sclerocarya afra&quot;). The &quot;Acacias&quot; are dominant along the rivers and streams, the very dense Nwatimhiri bush along the Sabie River between Skukuza and Lower Sabie being a very good example.

==== Knob-thorn and marula veld ====
South of the Olifants River in the park&#x27;s eastern half, this area provides the most important grazing land. Species such as red grass (&quot;Themeda triandra&quot;) and buffalo grass (&quot;Panicum maximum&quot;) predominate while the knob-thorn (&quot;Acacia nigrescens&quot;), leadwood (&quot;Combretum imberbe&quot;) and marula (&quot;Sclerocarya afra&quot;) are the main tree species.

====Local vegetation communities====
Several smaller areas in the park carry distinctive vegetation. The Pretoriuskop sourveld and Malelane mountain bushveld receive relatively high rainfall. Here sickle bush and silver cluster-leaf (&quot;Terminalia sericea&quot;) are prominent. The sandveld communities northeast of Punda Maria are equally distinctive, with a wide variety of unique plant species. The bush-clad hills along the Levuvhu River also shelter an interesting floral diversity and some near-endemic species.

=== Mammals ===
All the big five game animals are found at Kruger National Park, which has more species of large mammals than any other African game reserve (at 147 species). There are webcams set up to observe the wildlife.

Kruger supports packs of the endangered African wild dog, of which there are thought to be only about 400 in the whole of South Africa.

=== Birds ===

A fairly uniform aggregate of bird species is present from the southern to central areas of the park, but a decline in diversity is noticeable in the mopane-dominated flats northwards of the Olifants. Most species breed in summer when rains sustain most vegetable and animal food, but the larger birds of prey conversely breed during the dry winter, when their prey is most exposed. Out of the 507 species of birds found at Kruger, 253 are residents, 117 non-breeding migrants, and 147 are nomads.

Constituting the southern lowveld, the park&#x27;s avifaunal affinities are mainly with the tropical north. Some representatives of this group are the African openbill, hooded vulture, Dickinson&#x27;s kestrel, white-crowned lapwing, brown-necked parrot, Senegal coucal, broad-billed roller, trumpeter hornbill, Böhm&#x27;s spinetail, tropical boubou, Meves&#x27;s starling and scarlet-chested sunbird. Some 30 waterbird and wader species are dependent on the rivers or associated dams, including the African finfoot, white-backed night heron, white-crowned lapwing and water thick-knee. Other species are limited to riparian thicket or forest, including African goshawk, crested guineafowl, Natal spurfowl, Narina trogon, Pel&#x27;s fishing owl, bearded scrub robin, terrestrial brownbul and black-throated wattle-eye. This habitat is often reduced by drought or floods or the understorey is opened up by elephant.

Some of the larger birds require large territories or are sensitive to habitat degradation. Six of these birds, which are by and large restricted to Kruger and other extensive conservation areas, have been assigned to a fanciful grouping called the &quot;Big Six Birds&quot;. They are the lappet-faced vulture, martial eagle, saddle-billed stork, kori bustard, ground hornbill and the reclusive Pel&#x27;s fishing owl, which is localized and seldom seen. The 2011 aerial survey found 22 martial eagle nest sites, the 2015 survey an additional 17, while the 2020 survey found 70 nest locations in all, though the activity of these has yet to be determined. There are 25 to 30 breeding pairs of saddle-billed storks in the park, besides a handful of non-breeding individuals. In 2012 178 family groups of ground hornbills roamed the park and 78 nests were known, of which 50% were active. A 2013 study estimated that 904 pairs of white-backed vulture, 78 pairs of lappet-faced vulture and 60 pairs of white-headed vulture breed in the park.

=== Other vertebrates ===
Kruger is inhabited by 114 species of reptile, including black mambas, African rock pythons, and 3,000 Nile crocodiles. As yet, knowledge of the densities and distributions of the reptiles, especially on smaller spatial scales, is limited by sampling bias and a strong dependence on the park&#x27;s public infrastructure is evident. 34 species of amphibians are found in the park, as well as 49 fish species. A Zambezi shark, &quot;Carcharhinus leucas&quot;, also known as the bull shark, was caught at the confluence of the Limpopo and Luvuvhu Rivers in July 1950. Zambezi sharks tolerate fresh water and can travel far up rivers like the Limpopo.

=== Invertebrates ===

219 species of butterfly and skipper are native to the park. The fastest and most robust of these belong to the genus &quot;Charaxes&quot;, of which 12 species have been recorded. Genera &quot;Papilio&quot; and &quot;Acraea&quot; are also well-represented, with about 10 and 15 species respectively. The total number of Lepidoptera species in the park is unknown but could be in the order of 7,000, many of which range widely in African savanna. The mopane moth in the northern half of the park is one of the best known, and communities outside the park have at times been given permits to harvest their caterpillars. The park has a high diversity of termites and 22 genera are known to occur, including the mound-building genera &quot;Macrotermes&quot;, &quot;Cubitermes&quot;, &quot;Amitermes&quot;, &quot;Odontotermes&quot; and &quot;Trinervitermes&quot;. A new species of woodlouse, &quot;Ctenorillo meyeri&quot;, has been discovered inside termite nests, east of Phalaborwa and near Mopani Rest Camp. It is the first instance of a termitophilous species from the family Armadillidae. Many species of mosquito occur in the park, including the &quot;Culex&quot;, &quot;Aedes&quot; and &quot;Anopheles&quot; genera which target mammals. &quot;A. arabiensis&quot; is the most prevalent of the 9 or more &quot;Anopheles&quot; species in the park, and their females transmit malaria.
As of 2018, 350 species of arachnids, excluding ticks and mites, are known from Kruger. These are mostly true spiders, including 7 species of baboon spider, but also 9 scorpion and 7 pseudoscorpion species, 18 solifugid species (sun and roman spiders), 2 species of harvestmen and 1 species of tailless whip scorpion.

== Threats ==
The park&#x27;s ecosystem is subject to several threats, including intensive poaching, urban development at its borders, global warming and droughts, animal overpopulation, and mining projects.

Light pollution produced by rest camps and nearby towns affects the biodiversity of Kruger National Park. In particular, it alters the composition of nocturnal wildlife and the hunting behaviour of predators. In 2022 it was announced that Nkosi City, an R8 billion development is planned near the western border of the park.

Floods or raising of the walls of the Massingir and Corumana dams in Mozambique could potentially damage, by silting, the pristine gorges of the Olifants and Sabie rivers respectively. The Olifants River Gorge has a deep, single thread, pool-rapid structure which is home to many crocodiles, besides hippos and fish. The fish population of the Olifants has already been diminished by hundreds of dams in its upper reaches.

== Anti-poaching measures ==

Kruger is not exempt from the threat of poaching that many other African countries have faced. Many poachers are in search of ivory from elephant tusks or rhino horns, which are similar in composition to human fingernails. The park&#x27;s anti-poaching unit consists of 650 SANParks game rangers, assisted by the SAPS and the SANDF (including the SAAF). As of 2013, the park is equipped with two drones borrowed from Denel and two Aérospatiale Gazelle helicopters, donated by the RAF to augment its air space presence. Automated movement sensors relay intrusions along the Mozambique border to a control center, and a specialist dog unit has been introduced. Buffer zones have been established along the border with Mozambique, from where many poachers have infiltrated the park, as an alternative to costly new fences. The original 150 km long fences were dropped in 2002 to establish the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park. The national anti-poaching committee oversees all activities and coordinates interested parties.

=== Poachers ===
Kruger&#x27;s big game poachers operate with night vision instruments and large caliber rifles, fitted with suppressors and sophisticated telescopic sights. They are mostly Mozambique citizens who initiate their carefully planned incursions from the border region of South Africa and Mozambique. In 2012, about 200 poachers were apprehended, while about 30 were killed in skirmishes.
In July 2012, a Kruger game ranger and policeman were the first to die in an anti-poaching operation, while other employees reported intimidation by poachers. A Kruger personnel strike affected some anti-poaching operations, and some employees have been directly implicated.
Rangers in and around the park have been pressured or blackmailed by poaching syndicates to provide intelligence on the whereabouts of rhinos and anti-poaching operations.

In December 2012, Kruger started using a Seeker II drone against rhino poachers, which was loaned to the South African National Parks authority by its manufacturer Denel Dynamics, South Africa.

In June 2019, a Helix surveillance aircraft system was deployed on night missions in the park, and apprehended half a dozen suspected poachers.
Other threats to poachers include the dangerous nature of the park itself. In February 2018, a poacher was believed to have been trampled by elephants and then eaten by lions, leaving rangers to later find only a human skull and a pair of trousers, alongside a loaded hunting rifle.
In December 2021, two accused poachers were arrested in the Kruger National Park&#x27;s Skukuza after they were discovered in possession of unauthorized rifles and ammunition.

==== Rhino ====
Poachers make no distinction between white and black rhinos, but losses of black rhinos are low due to their reclusive and aggressive nature. Rhino horn fetches between $66,000 and $82,000 per kilogram, and the CITES ban has proved largely ineffectual against the trade in rhino horn. The second horn is sometimes also hacked from the skull to obtain about 100 ml of moisture that is sold locally as traditional medicine Muti.

Poaching rhino horn escalated in the 21st century, with 949 rhinos killed in Kruger in the first 12 years, and more than 520 in 2013 alone. A memorandum of agreement is seen as a necessary milestone in stemming the tide between South Africa and Vietnam, in addition to the one with China, while negotiations have not yet started with Thailand. The amount of rhino horn held in storage is not publicly known. Since 2009, some Kruger rhinos have been fitted with invisible tracing devices in their bodies and horns which enable officials to locate their carcasses and to track the smuggled horns by satellite. South Africa&#x27;s 22,000 white and black rhinos represent some 93% of these species&#x27; world population, 12,000 of which are found in Kruger.

In July 2022, Navara, an elephant poacher who frequented Kruger, was arrested in Maputo in a sting operation for possessing rhino horns. As of 2023, he is serving a 30-year prison sentence.

==== Elephant ====
Kruger experienced significant elephant poaching in the 1980s. Due to international and national efforts, including a worldwide ban on ivory sales beginning in 1989, the poaching was abated for many years, but a sharp rise in 2014 has continued and the numbers of elephants poached per year in the park is growing at an alarming rate.

Following approval by CITES, 47 tonnes of stockpiled ivory from Kruger were auctioned on 6 November 2008. The sale fetched approximately US$6.7 million which was allocated to increased anti-poaching measures. The intention was to flood the market, crash prices and make poaching less profitable. But instead, the legal sale was followed by &quot;an abrupt, significant, permanent, robust and geographically widespread increase&quot; in elephant poaching, as subsequent research showed.

The latest Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), summit voted down proposals for further one-off ivory sales from stockpiles for having led to increases in poaching across the continent. Across the continent the African elephant population decreased 30% in the period between 2007 and 2014. 
=== Other ===
It is foreseen that the placement of wire traps to procure meat would eventually become the most challenging form of poaching. A scheme has been proposed to reward adjacent communities with the proceeds of game sales in return for their cooperation in game preservation. The larger communities include Bosbokrand, Acornhoek, Hazyview, Hoedspruit, Komatipoort, Malelane, Marloth Park, Nelspruit and Phalaborwa. Communities along the northern boundary have complained about a number of issues that affect them, including livestock killed by escaped predators. In 2021 and 2022 there were cases of poisoning of carcasses near Punda Maria, evidently to obtain the body parts of scavengers.

<text>Valero Energy Corporation is an American-based fuels producer mostly involved in manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels and other related products. It is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, United States. Throughout the United States, Canada, and the U.K., the company owns and operates 15 refineries with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 3.2 million barrels per day, two renewable diesel plants that produce approximately 1.2 billion gallons per year, and 12 ethanol plants with a combined production capacity of 1.6 billion gallons as its subsidiaries.

According to a number of estimates, Valero has become a major producer of corn ethanol and renewable diesel, both low-carbon liquid transportation fuels.

== History ==
Valero was established on January 1, 1980, as a spinoff of Coastal States Gas Corporation&#x27;s Subsidiary, LoVaca Gathering Company. The company took over the natural gas operations of the LoVaca Gathering Company, later renamed the Valero Transmission Company. In the 1970s, the Coastal company faced litigation due to its inability to honor contracts to supply utilities around Texas due to a natural gas shortage. After six years, Coastal agreed to a $1.6 billion settlement, which included the establishment of Valero as a new company.

The name Valero comes from &quot;Mission San Antonio de Valero,&quot; the original name of the mission in the Alamo. The company acquired Corpus Christi Marine Services Company, a small barge company in Corpus Christi, Texas, in April 1981 when it purchased a stake in Saber Energy Inc. of Houston. In May 1985, Valero Refining and Marketing Company was born from Valero&#x27;s subsidiary, Saber Energy Inc.

In 1997, Valero merged its natural gas service business with Pacific Gas and Electric Company and spun off its refining assets to form Valero Energy Corporation. At the same time, the remaining divisions, which consisted of natural gas operations, merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of PG&amp;E. In May of that year, Valero Energy acquired three refineries from Bassis Petroleum. The following year, the company expanded its operations by purchasing the Paulsboro Refinery in New Jersey from Mobil, making it the second-largest independent refiner in the U.S.

In 2000, Valero purchased the Benicia, California, refinery and interest in 350 Exxon-branded service stations in California, mainly in the San Francisco Bay Area. The company also began retailing gasoline under the Valero brand. In June 2001, Valero acquired two asphalt plants on the West Coast.

In 2001, Valero completed its acquisition of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock. With this acquisition, the company also received ownership of Shamrock Logistics L.P., which was renamed Valero L.P. In 2006, Valero L.P. was spun off and renamed NuStar Energy. Starting in 2002, Valero has expanded its marketing to the East Coast, specifically the Northeast and Florida, using the Valero brand.

By 2003, Valero completed its acquisition of El Paso Corp&#x27;s refineries, pipeline system and terminal assets in Corpus Christi and South Texas. On April 25, 2005, the company purchased Premcor, Inc., for $8 billion. In June 2005, Valero announced that it was beginning a two-year process of converting Diamond Shamrock stations to the Valero brand. And in 2008, the company bought 72 Albertsons gas stations.

In 2009, it was reported that Valero lost an average $1 million per day since the beginning of the year. In November of that year, the company was forced to lay off 500 employees, and subsequently began to permanently shut down its refinery in Delaware City, Delaware.

In 2009, Valero Energy Corporation entered the ethanol market by acquiring 7 ethanol plants in March, and another 3 ethanol plants, purchased in December, all located in the Midwest of the United States.

In 2011, Valero Energy Corporation entered into a joint venture with a subsidiary of Darling Ingredients Inc. to establish Diamond Green Diesel Holdings (DGD). This venture resulted in the construction of a renewable diesel plant adjacent to Valero&#x27;s refinery in St. Charles, Louisiana.

On March 11, 2011, Valero announced that it had agreed to a major European purchase from Chevron Corp., Chevron&#x27;s Pembroke Refinery in Wales together with marketing and logistical assets throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland, which include 4 pipelines, 11 terminals, an aviation fuel business, about 1,000 retail outlets, inventory and other items.

In 2013, Valero spun off its retail operations into a new publicly traded company, CST Brands. Under long-term supply agreements, Valero continues to supply fuel to more than 7,000 retail locations, many of which use brand names owned by Valero. That same year, the company started renewable diesel production at the DGD joint venture plant next to Valero’s St. Charles refinery in Louisiana.

In 2021, DGD began expansion of the DGD St. Charles plant in 2019 and increased its renewable diesel capacity. In 2022, the second DGD plant, located next to Valero’s refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, began its operations.

A change to the logo, store canopy and facade was announced in April 2018. Known as &quot;Vanguard&quot;, with various hues of blue, white, and yellow, Valero explained that applying the new design to all its stores would take several months to complete.

In January 2023, Valero and Darling Ingredients Inc. announced an investment decision on a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”) project at the Diamond Green Diesel Port Arthur plant.

== Operations ==
Valero&#x27;s operations are managed through three main segments: refining, renewable diesel, and ethanol.

=== Refining ===
This segment includes the operations of Valero&#x27;s 15 petroleum refineries. The segment also encompasses the marketing of refined petroleum products and the logistics assets supporting these operations.

=== Renewable Diesel ===
Valero operates this segment through Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), which has two plants in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. These plants have a combined annual production capacity of about 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha.

=== Ethanol ===
Valero&#x27;s ethanol segment includes 12 plants combined production capacity of around 4.1 million gallons per day or approximately 1.6 billion gallons annually.

== Finances ==

For the fiscal year 2017, Valero Energy reported earnings of US$4.065 billion, with an annual revenue of US$93.980 billion, an increase of 24.2% over the previous fiscal cycle. Valero Energy&#x27;s shares traded at over $67 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$39.2 billion in November 2018. Valero is ranked No. 31 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue as of 2018.

For 2023, the company reported earnings of US$9.149 billion, with an annual revenue of US$144.766 billion. Valero Energy&#x27;s shares traded at $130 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$44 billion. Valero is ranked No. 40 on the Fortune 500 rankings of United States corporations by total revenue as of 2022.
==Environmental record==
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Valero 28th among U.S. corporations based on their airborne pollutant emissions. This ranking considers both the quantity (3.4 million pounds in 2005) and the toxicity of the emissions.

In 2010, Valero was reportedly the largest financial supporter of California Proposition 23, contributing over $4 million by August of that year. Proposition 23 aimed to delay the implementation of California&#x27;s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 until the state achieved an unemployment rate of 5.5% or lower for a full year. Critics argued that because that had happened only three times over the last 40 years, the proposition would have had the practical effect of repealing the law.

Valero owns two oil refineries in California. The Benicia Refinery is located on the Carquinez Strait, a tributary of the San Francisco Bay and the Wilmington Refinery, located south from downtown Los Angeles. The company&#x27;s refineries in Wilmington (CA), Benicia (CA), and Port Arthur (TX) were noted for processing crude oil from the Amazon region of South America, raising environmental concerns regarding the protection of the Amazon rainforest. In 2015, the Wilmington and Benicia refineries processed approximately 13,000 and 7,200 barrels of Amazonian crude oil per day, respectively.

In 2022, non-profit environmental group San Francisco Baykeeper sued Valero and Amports, a shipping operator, alleging that the companies had been dumping petroleum coke (or &quot;petcoke&quot;) from Valero&#x27;s Benicia Refinery into the San Francisco Bay. The lawsuit was settled in October 2024 for $2.38 million, with the companies also agreeing to site cleanup and investment in equipment to reduce spills and dust.

In 2024, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District and California Air Resources Board fined Valero $82 million over air pollution violations following a 2019 inspection at Valero&#x27;s Benicia Refinery, with the fine being the largest in the District&#x27;s history.

== EPA Compliance and mitigation ==
In 2020, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a settlement with Valero and its subsidiaries regarding alleged Clean Air Act violations related to fuel quality standards and compliance requirements at the company&#x27;s refineries and an import facilities. The related consent decree requires Valero to implement a company-wide Fuels Management System to help ensure its production complies with regulations. In 2023, an audit by Montrose Environmental concluded that Valero has taken substantial actions to address environmental and health concerns in underserved communities, aligning with the U.S. EPA&#x27;s principles of environmental justice.

===Carbon footprint===
Valero Energy reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 27,500 Kt (-2,000 /-6.8% y-o-y).

==Defense contracts==
In the past years, Valero Energy Corp. has secured contracts worth several hundred millions of dollars from the United States Defense Logistics Agency Energy (DLA Energy) through the U.S. Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) to provide fuel for various defense needs.

==Divestitures==
During 2010, Valero sold its operations on the United States Atlantic coast.

In November 2009, Valero Energy closed its operations at Delaware City. Later, Valero Energy reached an agreement to sell the assets of its Delaware City Refining and Delaware Pipeline to a Petroplus Holdings subsidiary, PBF Energy Partners LP, for approximately $220 million in September 2010.

Shortly after the divestiture of Delaware City, the company sold its refinery at the Port of Paulsboro to PBF Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of PBF Energy, as well. The sale concluded Valero&#x27;s refinery ownership on the East Coast.

==Acquisitions==
Through acquisitions in 2011, Valero entered the European market while strengthening its position in the United States, by reducing costs in supplying the Atlantic coast.

On August 1, 2011, Valero acquired the Pembroke Refinery from Chevron, as well as the marketing and logistics assets, for $730 million, excluding working capital, which was valued at approximately $1 billion. The Pembroke plant is one of the largest and most complex refineries in Western Europe with a total throughput capacity of per day and a Nelson complexity index rating of 11.8.

Valero also purchased ownership interest in four major pipelines and eleven fuel terminals, a -per-day aviation fuel business, and a network of more than 1,000 Texaco-branded wholesale sites. Valero has continued with the Texaco brand in these markets.

==Retail==
Valero retails gasoline branded as Valero, Shamrock, Diamond Shamrock, Beacon, and Total, the last under license from TotalEnergies. While this arm of the company was the most visible to the public, it was, according to CEO Bill Greehey, &quot;a very small part of [Valero&#x27;s] operations&quot;.

Valero attempted to shift its focus from being a discount gasoline brand to becoming a premium brand. As part of the shift, Valero began to rebrand its Ultramar, Beacon, Total, and Diamond Shamrock stations to the Valero brand. The Beacon and Shamrock brands are used by retailers as a low-cost alternative to the premium Valero brand. The Shamrock brand is based on the former Shamrock Oil and Gas Company, which merged with Diamond Alkali in 1967 to form Diamond Shamrock, thus declaring the trademark from official abandonment. The name Ultramar, while being eliminated in the United States, continued as Valero&#x27;s brand name in Canada. Valero introduced its updated &quot;Corner Store&quot; retail concept on December 28, 2007, opening the company&#x27;s first prototype in western San Antonio. The Corner Store retail division, originally part of Diamond Shamrock, was absorbed into Valero&#x27;s business portfolio in 2001. Not all Valero gas stations included a Corner Store - one Valero gas station in Euless, Texas east of Fort Worth was co-branded with a 7-Eleven convenience store.

===Creation of CST Brands===
On July 31, 2012, during the 2nd Quarter Earnings Conference Call, Valero announced intentions to separate the retail business from the remainder of the company. CFO Mike Ciskowski stated &quot;We believe the separation of our retail business by way of a tax-efficient distribution to our shareholders will create operational flexibility within the business and unlock value for our shareholders.&quot; In 2013, Valero completed the spinoff of the retail operations as CST Brands. Valero no longer owns retail operations using the Diamond Shamrock, Shamrock, Beacon, Ultramar, or Total names, but Valero continues to supply fuel.
Valero also supplies fuel in the United Kingdom and Ireland under the Texaco and Valero brand, and in October 2023 started test marketing of the Valero brand at 3 service stations close to its refinery in Wales, United Kingdom. In 2020, the Valero brand was introduced in Mexico and as of 2024 is the branded fuel supplier for 260 gas stations across the country.

===Credit cards===
Valero issues its own private label credit cards for its stations through its credit card-only subsidiary, DSRM National Bank. The initials stand for &quot;Diamond Shamrock Refining &amp; Marketing&quot;, the unit of Diamond Shamrock which created it before being purchased by Valero. The credit card operations are based in Amarillo, Texas, a city where Diamond Shamrock was once previously based.

<text>The Singer Building (also known as the Singer Tower) was an office building and early skyscraper in Manhattan, New York City. The headquarters of the Singer Manufacturing Company, was at the northwestern corner of Liberty Street and Broadway in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. Frederick Gilbert Bourne, leader of the Singer Company, commissioned the building, which architect Ernest Flagg designed in multiple phases from 1897 to 1908. The building&#x27;s architecture contained elements of the Beaux-Arts and French Second Empire styles.

The building was composed of four distinct sections. The original 10-story Singer Building at 149 Broadway was erected between 1897 and 1898, and the adjoining 14-story Bourne Building on Liberty Street was built from 1898 to 1899. In the first decade of the 20th century, the two buildings were expanded to form the 14-story base of the Singer Tower, which rose another 27 stories. The facade was made of brick, stone, and terracotta. A dome with a lantern capped the tower. The foundation of the tower was excavated using caissons; the building&#x27;s base rested on shallower foundations. The Singer Building used a steel frame, though load-bearing walls initially supported the original structure before modification. When completed, the 41-story building had a marble-clad entrance lobby, 16 elevators, of office space, and an observation deck.

With a roof height of , the Singer Tower was the tallest building in the world from 1908 to 1909, when it was surpassed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower. The base occupied the building&#x27;s entire land lot; the tower&#x27;s floors took up just one-sixth of that area. Despite being regarded as a city icon, the Singer Building was razed between 1967 and 1969 to make way for One Liberty Plaza, which had several times more office space than the Singer Tower. At the time of its destruction, the Singer Building was the tallest building ever to be demolished by its owners, a distinction it held until 2019.

== Architecture ==
The Singer Building was at the northwest corner of Liberty Street and Broadway in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, abutting the City Investing Building to the north. The land lot was nearly rectangular, though slightly skewed due to the layout of the street grid, and measured on Broadway by on Liberty Street. The structure, as completed in 1908, was composed of four distinct sections: the original Singer and Bourne buildings, an annex next to both buildings, and the tower. All of these structures were designed by Ernest Flagg for Frederick Bourne, who led the Singer Manufacturing Company.

The structure was designed with elements of the Beaux-Arts style and the French Second Empire style. American architect George W. Conable prepared plans and working drawings. An architectural office with an engineering department led by Otto F. Semsch, and mechanical equipment engineer consultants Charles G. Armstrong and steel engineers Boller &amp; Hodge, oversaw construction. Over 40 other companies were involved in the construction process, and nearly 100 construction contracts were awarded. There were no general contractors on the project; the owners communicated directly with the suppliers responsible for each contract.

When the tower addition was completed in 1908, its roof was high. The tower was topped by a flagpole, giving it a ground-to-pinnacle height of . The Singer Building was the world&#x27;s tallest building at the time of its completion and the world&#x27;s tallest building to be destroyed upon its demolition. Contemporary sources at the time of the building&#x27;s construction described the &quot;Singer Tower&quot; as referring only to the building&#x27;s tower portion, rather than its base. The &quot;Singer Building&quot; name originally referred only to a portion of the base, although by the mid–20th century it referred to the entire structure.

===Form===

The base of the building filled the entire lot. It was composed of the 10-story original structure (later expanded to 14 stories) and the 14-story annex known as the Bourne Building. The original Singer Building, on the southeastern portion of the lot, had a frontage of on Broadway and on Liberty Street. The Bourne Building, on the southwestern portion, was 58 feet deep and had a frontage of approximately on Liberty Street. From 1906 to 1907, the original Singer Building was extended northward and the Bourne Building was extended westward. The original Singer and Bourne buildings were about tall.

The 41-story tower above the northwest corner of the base was square in plan, with floor dimensions of . When the dome and lantern at the tower&#x27;s pinnacle were included, the Singer Tower was the equivalent of a 47-story building. The tower was set back behind the base&#x27;s frontage on Broadway, and it filled only one-sixth of the total lot area. There was a gap of between the Singer Building&#x27;s tower and the City Investing Building immediately to the north, which was built during the same time. The columns required to support the Singer Tower would have been too large to place atop the original Singer Building, so they were instead built in the northern portion of the lot. The tower had a height-to-width ratio of 7:1, setting a record at the time of its completion.

=== Facade ===
The facade was made of red brick, light-colored stone, and terracotta. Some of terracotta was used for both the facade and the interior partitions. About five million bricks were used in the entire project, including one million in the tower section. About of North River bluestone was also used, as was of limestone, mainly above the 33rd floor. The contractors for these materials included John B. Rose Company for the brick; Martin P. Lodge for the bluestone; J. J. Spurr &amp; Sons for the limestone; and New Jersey Terra Cotta for the terracotta.
For decorative elements, of sheet copper was used. Whale Creek Iron Works provided ornamental iron while Jno. Williams Inc. provided the ornamental bronze. There were of glass in the entire building, about 10percent of which was interior glass. There was extensive ornamentation throughout the building, including eight arches atop the tower&#x27;s exterior.

==== Base ====
The original Singer Building was faced with stone and brick. When it was built, the plans called for the lowest two stories to be clad with stone. The third story contained a balcony extending along both facades. The four following stories were faced with brick and contained windows with stone surrounds. The seventh story was clad with stone and had a balcony doubling as a cornice, while the facade on the eighth story was made of brick. The original top stories comprised a decorative copper-and-slate roof with dormers and stone chimneys. The main entrance was on Liberty Street and had sculptures and ornament. The Bourne Building was faced with Indiana Limestone on its lowest two stories and red brick above. The base had ironwork ornamentation in their mullions and window railings.

After the 1906–1907 modifications, the main entrance faced Broadway on the eastern facade. This main entrance had a three-story-tall semicircular arch. A two-story architrave was beneath the arch, with an engraved cartouche reading &quot;Singer&quot; at the center. The upper part of the arch had a fanlight with five vertical mullions, below which was a bronze grille measuring wide and tall.

As a result of the modifications, the first three stories were faced with rusticated North River bluestone. Four stories were added between the seventh floor and the three-story roof during that time, and the Broadway facade was expanded from two bays to five. With the modifications, the vertical bays were separated with vertical strips from the fourth to the 10th floors, with pediments above the sixth-floor windows. The 11th and 12th floors of the modified base consisted of two rows of small windows, with the 11th-floor windows spaced between brackets supporting a 12th-floor iron balcony. The top two stories contained dormer windows projecting from the mansard roof. The sloped portions of the roof were clad with slate shingles, while glazed roof tiles covered the flat portion.

==== Tower ====

The Singer Tower&#x27;s facade was made of brick masonry ranging in thickness from at the top to at the base. The Singer Tower contained five bays on each side, each measuring wide. Construction plans show that there were 36 windows on each floor. The faces of the tower were made of dark red brick, except for decorative elements such as trimmings, copings, courses, and windowsills, which were made of North River bluestone. On each side, vertical limestone piers separated the outermost bays from the three center bays, dividing the facade into three vertical sections. The outermost bays were illuminated by small windows. The corners of the tower were made of solid masonry, which concealed the diagonal steel bracing inside. The tower had cast-iron balconies and fascias, as well as wrought-iron jambs and mullions. The use of iron balconies, as well as the large amount of glass in the facade, was inspired by the design of the Little Singer Building at 561 Broadway, built in 1904.

Horizontal belt courses wrapped around the tower above the 17th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 29th, and 30th stories, while there were terracotta balconies on each side at the 18th, 24th, and 30th stories. Iron balconies also projected from the building at intervals of seven stories. Near the top of the tower, the vertical stone bands on each side formed a tall arch evocative of the tower&#x27;s dome. On the 36th floor, an ornamental balcony cantilevered about outward on each side; it was supported by brackets on the 35th floor. Stone architraves surrounded the corner windows of the 36th and 37th stories, while ornate stone arches framed the center bays on the 36th through 38th stories. There were oval windows on each corner at the 38th floor. Above that level, a heavy stone cornice ran around the corners and above the arches.

The top of the tower contained a dome covering the top three stories, capped by a lantern that measures across at its base and stretches tall. The dome&#x27;s roof was made of slate, while the roof ornamentation, dormers, and lantern were made of copper sheeting. In its final years, the dome&#x27;s trapezoidal skylights were replaced with dormer windows. The top of the lantern was above ground level, and a steel flagpole rose above the lantern, bringing the height of the Singer Tower to when measured from ground to tip. The flagpole was actually long, but the base of the flagpole was embedded into the tower. The entire exterior was lit at night by 1,600 incandescent lamps and thirty projectors, which were visible at distances of up to .

===Structural features===
==== Superstructure ====
Load-bearing walls initially supported the original Singer Building at 149 Broadway, while the Bourne Building annex at 85–89 Liberty Street had an internal steel skeleton. The original Singer Building was altered between 1906 and 1908 to use a steel skeleton. The entire building used 850 steel columns. The columns were generally constructed in two-story segments. One- to three-story-tall column segments were used on the basements, first floor, and 14th through 16th floors. Rafters supported the mansard roof of the base, excluding the tower. Milliken Brothers Inc. was the structural steel supplier for the project.

The Singer Tower addition of 1906–1908 had a steel skeleton and weighed . The tower&#x27;s columns were spaced apart on their centers. Because the three center bays on each side contained windows, only the corners used diagonal bracing and, as such, were treated as square prisms. Inside, there was another structure for the central elevator shafts, which were connected to the corners of the tower via longitudinal beams. A girder supported the columns at the tower&#x27;s corners at the fourth floor, while 36 columns rose from the basement into the tower. Four pillars were placed at each corner of the tower and six more pillars were placed in the elevator shafts. Each truss extended upward for two stories, causing the columns and braces to act as wind-resistant cantilevers. The braces on the north and south contained 11 panels each while those on the east and west contained 10 panels. The four columns at the center of the tower supported its dome.

The superstructure was erected using two boom derricks. One of them, with a capacity of , a mast, and a boom, lifted the steel beams from ground level to a 17th-story platform. The other was installed on the 17th floor and had a capacity of ; this derrick erected the tower&#x27;s steel. Generally, it took less than five minutes to transfer the steel from ground level to the superstructure. German steel was used in the Singer Tower&#x27;s framing because of Flagg&#x27;s belief that German workmanship was better than that of Americans. The tower&#x27;s superstructure was intended to withstand wind pressure of , even though the highest recorded wind pressure in the neighborhood was less than at the time of the Singer Building&#x27;s construction.

The internal structure also used of Portland cement and of concrete subflooring. The Singer Building&#x27;s floors generally used terracotta flat arches deep, and many of the internal partitions also used terracotta blocks.

==== Foundation ====
The underlying layer of bedrock extended as deep as , above which were layers of quicksand, hardpan, rocks, clay, and soil. The groundwater level was below the Singer Building. The ground composition under the lot varied significantly, as the hardpan was compact in some places and loose in others. Below the groundwater level, the saturation of the ground made it unfeasible to dig the cellar conventionally. The Foundation Company excavated the tower&#x27;s foundation using pneumatic caissons. The caissons were used to extract the underlying soil, then filled with concrete to create piers.

Each caisson pier was designed to carry . A gridiron of steel girders was placed atop the caisson piers. Because of the design of the tower addition&#x27;s wind-bracing superstructure, the upward pull on some of the piers was greater than the dead load these piers carried. As a result, eyebars of different lengths were embedded in 10 of the caissons, the concrete being poured onto the eyebars. The rods were embedded into the caisson piers. The system, devised in house by Flagg&#x27;s office, was more than twice as expensive as a conventional foundation would have cost for a building of the Singer Tower&#x27;s size. The original plan was for the caissons to be sunk only deep, but the builders changed plans midway through the excavations, so that the caissons would go to hardpan.

The original portions of the building were built on below the sidewalk level. These foundations were strengthened when the tower was added. The total weight of the Singer Building, including the tower addition, was carried by 54 steel columns atop the concrete foundation piers.

=== Interior ===
The Singer Building was intended to be fireproof, and the tower section used mostly concrete floors, with wood used in some doors, windows, railings and decorative elements. The base used more wood than the tower, mainly in the floors, windows, and doors. All the building&#x27;s stairs were made of cast iron. The interior trim in the Singer Building was made of metal painted to resemble wood, including in the doors. Actual wooden furniture was used in the Singer Company&#x27;s main offices on the 34th floor. There were also ornamental plaster features executed by H. W. Miller Inc. Plaster was used extensively for the walls and ceilings. The usable office space in the building totaled .

The Singer Building took water from the New York City water supply system, where it was filtered through ammonia coils and then through two filters into two suction tanks. Inside the Singer Building, there were seven water tanks to serve a projected demand of each hour. Three tanks on the Singer Tower&#x27;s 29th, 39th, and 42nd floors had a combined capacity of 15,000 gallons and served several portions of the tower. To provide water to the base, there was one tank of in the Bourne Building and three tanks of a combined in the original Singer Building. This allowed all the offices in the tower portion to be provided with cold, hot, and ice water. Two heaters in the basement provided heated water to the entire building. There was also a refrigeration plant with two pumps and a small freezing system capable of producing of ice daily.

The Singer Building contained a vacuum steam system, although the ground-floor lobby and the basement vaults were heated by an indirect-steam system. Heating came from steel radiators on each floor; the radiators in the ground-floor banking rooms and the Singer Company&#x27;s 33rd and 34th floor offices were enclosed within ornamental screens. About 1,600 steam radiators were installed throughout the building. As well as providing heat, the building&#x27;s boilers also provided electric power to the entire building. Initially, the Bourne and original Singer buildings had boilers aggregating and power generators with a capacity of . With the 1906–1908 addition, boilers aggregating were installed, and generators with a capacity of were added, replacing the old ones. A steel smokestack at the northwest corner of the building was shared with the City Investing Building to the north.

====Lobby====

The lobby, accessed from Broadway, was finished with Pavonazzo marble and had of bronze work. &quot;New York Times&quot; architectural writer Christopher Gray characterized the lobby as exuding &quot;celestial radiance&quot;. Two rows of eight square marble piers trimmed with bronze beading supported the lobby ceiling. Each pier was made of Pavonazzo marble and had a border of Montarenti Sienna marble. There were large bronze medallions atop each pier, depicting either the Singer Company&#x27;s monogram or a needle, thread, and bobbin. At the tops of the piers were decorative pendentives, which supported glazed plaster domes above. The pendentives were ornately decorated with gold leaf. The domes&#x27; drums originally contained flat, circular amber glass lights in steel frames, which were later replaced with modern glass lighting fixtures.

Immediately outside the entrance, on either side of the lobby, were stairs leading up to a balcony and down to the basement, while the south wall contained stairs to the original Singer Building. The stairs were made of cast iron and wrought iron, and the handrails and newel posts were made of bronze. The elevators were clustered on the northern wall, opposite the stairs to the original Singer Building. Each of the elevator doors in the lobby were made of four bronze leaves. A balcony, trimmed with bronze, overlooked the lobby. There were Italian marble stairs at the rear of the lobby which split into two flights connecting to either portion of the balcony. A master clock on the central landing of the rear stairs controlled all the clocks in the building. The lobby was a popular spot for meetings.

There were also two secondary entrances on Liberty Street—one to the original Singer Building and one to the Bourne Building. Both secondary entrances connected to the main lobby to the north. There was retail space on the ground floor as well.

==== Basement ====
The boiler room and mechanical plant were in the basement, and consisted of five boilers and five generators. The boilers were clustered under the western portion of the building, while an engine room was in the center. A pump room and machine room were in the southeastern corner, with a chief engineer&#x27;s office, electrician&#x27;s room, and waste paper room. A compressor room was at the northeastern corner.

From the basement, a corridor extended east to the safe deposit vaults. There were 10 vaults used by the Safe Deposit Company of New York, within a space of . The vaults each contained several thousand safe deposit boxes, and the vault walls were formed of several layers of steel. The door to the largest vault weighed over . The vaults abutted three committee rooms for the company.

==== Other floors ====
The 2nd through 13th floors contained offices flanking a T-shaped corridor facing away from the elevators. The ceilings of these story were generally painted in white watercolor while the walls were light tan. In addition, these stories contained oak trim, partitions, and decorative moldings. The average story at the base contained 40 offices.

The tower stories contained a U-shaped layout surrounding the elevators in the center of the building, with emergency stairs in the tower&#x27;s core. In the Singer Building&#x27;s tower, there were very few partitions, except for elevators and restrooms. The average floor in the tower contained 16 offices. On these stories, the ceilings were painted ivory, the walls were olive green, and the metal trim was painted to resemble wood grain. The Singer Company&#x27;s main offices, on the 33rd through 35th floors, had a plethora of ornamental plaster.

The highest publicly accessible point in the Singer Building was above the curb, at the lantern balcony. When the observation deck opened on June 23, 1908, visitors paid $0.50 () to use the observation area at the top of the building. From this observation deck, visitors could see as far as away. After two people jumped from the deck and died, the Singer Tower was nicknamed &quot;Suicide Pinnacle&quot;, and its deck was closed by the 1930s. From the observation deck, a series of steep ladders and stairs led to the lantern.

==== Elevators ====
There were 15 Otis electric traction elevators in the completed building, and one electric-drum elevator, for a total of 16 elevators. The tower portion had nine elevators, eight of which ran from the lobby. Four were &quot;local&quot; elevators making all stops between the lobby and the 13th floor; two of these continued down to the basement. Four &quot;express&quot; elevators ran from the lobby to the upper floors; three of them terminated at the 35th floor and the fourth at the 40th floor. Another &quot;shuttle&quot; elevator served only the 35th through 38th floors. The elevators could carry loads of up to and could travel from the lobby to the top floor at , faster than any other elevator then in existence.

The base had seven elevators: four in the Bourne Building and three in the original Singer Building. Two of the elevators in the base, one each in the Bourne and original Singer buildings, served all floors from the basement to the roof. The other five ran only from the first floor to the 14th floor. The original Singer Building&#x27;s elevators were in a single group on the southeastern side of the building, while the Bourne Building&#x27;s elevators were in two pairs opposite each other. The building&#x27;s managers hired female elevator operators, whom they characterized as &quot;businesslike in appearance and polite in manner&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;slovenly male operator with the ever-ready &#x27;back talk&#x27;&quot;. The cabs also had telephones, with which the elevator operators and starters could communicate.

==History==

During the late 19th century, New York City trailed Chicago in the development of early skyscrapers; New York had just four buildings over 16 stories tall in 1893, compared to twelve such buildings in Chicago. Part of the delay was caused by New York City authorities, who until 1889 would not allow metal-frame construction techniques. Skyscraper development in New York City changed in 1895 with the construction of the American Surety Building, a 20-story, development that broke Chicago&#x27;s height record. From then on, New York thoroughly embraced skeleton frame construction. The early years of the 20th century saw a range of technically sophisticated, architecturally confident skyscrapers built in New York; academics Sarah Landau and Carl Condit term this &quot;the first great age&quot; of skyscraper development.

Isaac M. Singer and Edward C. Clark had founded I. M. Singer &amp; Company in 1851. The company, which manufactured sewing equipment, became the Singer Manufacturing Company in 1865. The Singer Manufacturing Company was also involved in real estate during the latter half of the 19th century, Clark commissioning Henry Janeway Hardenbergh to design the Dakota and other New York City residential buildings in the 1880s. By the following decade, at the behest of Clark&#x27;s son Alfred Corning Clark, the Singer Company was instead working with Ernest Flagg, then a recent graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts. Frederick Bourne, who had become the Singer Company&#x27;s president in 1889, oversaw the firm&#x27;s expansion into European markets during that time.

=== Original building and annex ===
In February 1890, the Singer Manufacturing Company acquired the lot at 151–153 Broadway. The next month, they bought the lots at 149 Broadway and 83 Liberty Street, at the northwest corner of the two streets. The three lots had cost the company over $950,000 (), and at the time were occupied by four- to six-story buildings. The three lots were separate prior to the Singer Company&#x27;s acquisition but, under their ownership, were combined.

The Singer Manufacturing Company hired Ernest Flagg for the design of their new headquarters. Flagg filed plans for the new Singer Building at 149 Broadway in early 1897. They called for a 10-story stone-and-brick building with banking rooms on the lowest two stories, rental office space on six of the center stories, and the Singer Company&#x27;s offices on the upper stories. Construction began that year. While workers were excavating the site in June 1897, a water main burst and flooded the lot. Despite this, the new Singer Building was completed in early 1898.

In December 1897, before the new Singer headquarters was completed, Bourne bought three five-story structures for the company at 85–89 Liberty Street, on a plot measuring . Flagg was retained to design the 14-story Bourne Building on the site, and when he submitted building plans in 1898, the annex was estimated to cost $450,000. Bourne did not take title to the Bourne Building&#x27;s site until September 1899, and the Bourne Building was completed the same year. By 1900, the Singer and Bourne buildings were both fully occupied. The tenants included the law office of Augustus Van Wyck, and the Trust Company of America. Boiler manufacturers Babcock &amp; Wilcox were long-term tenants, occupying the Singer Building for more than forty years from the beginning of the 20th century.

=== Expansion ===
Further acquisitions followed in the first decade of the 20th century. In 1900, Bourne bought an iron-front building at 155 and 157 Broadway, with a frontage of about on Broadway. The purchase of 163 Broadway, a house with a frontage of only , followed in 1902, and in 1903 by the purchase of the five-story 93 Liberty Street, which added a frontage of . By 1905, the Singer Company controlled most of the block along both Broadway and Liberty Street; the original Singer Building was an L-shaped structure extending west and then north from the northwestern corner of Broadway and Liberty Street.

==== Tower construction ====
Concurrently with the land acquisitions, Flagg was retained to design a second addition to the Singer Building in 1902. By early the next year, he was planning a building that would be the tallest in the world, with over 35 stories. However, the Singer Manufacturing Company did not reveal specific details until February 1906, when it announced that it would build a tower, the world&#x27;s tallest. Revised plans were filed in July 1906, which provided for a more wind-resistant structure. The company intended to occupy the space above the 31st floor and planned to rent out the bottom section of the tower to tenants to subsidize their use of the upper floors. The Singer Company projected that it would earn $250,000 in rent per year, given a baseline rental cost of . Engineers were hired to create the construction plans as soon as the architect&#x27;s plans and specifications were published.

Before the foundations were built, the builders drilled several test boreholes to determine the composition of the underlying soil. Contracts for digging the foundation were awarded in August 1906 before the plans were approved. The plans for the Singer Tower were approved on September 12, 1906, and excavation began later that month, with work officially beginning on September 19. A timber platform, measuring wide and descending from Broadway to the excavation site, was constructed so that workers could receive materials and extract soil more efficiently. The first steel shipments for the anchorages arrived in October 1906. Foundation work was completed on February 18, 1907.

The superstructure was constructed afterward. A temporary elevator was installed while the tower&#x27;s superstructure was being erected. During the construction process, city building inspectors alleged the builders had violated city law by installing concrete flooring instead of hollow-tile floors. As a result, the builders were ordered to replace some non-compliant arches. By August 1907, the steel frame had reached 36 stories, surpassing the Washington Monument&#x27;s height. That month, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden visited the 29th floor to see the construction process. On October 4, 1907, the building topped out with the hoisting of the flagpole. After the building topped out, the interiors were furnished and plastered. Despite high winds, there were no serious accidents during construction. There was a small fire on the 40th floor in February 1908, which the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described at the time as &quot;the highest fire in any building in the world&quot;.

==== Base expansion ====
In late 1905, Flagg was hired to design a westward annex to the Bourne Building and a northward annex to the original Singer Building. The Bourne and Singer buildings were to be united internally, and the old Singer Building was to be expanded to 14 stories. The top story of the Bourne Building would also be expanded so that it would cover the same area as the Bourne Building&#x27;s lower floors. Plans for the Bourne and Singer extensions were filed in late 1906 and early 1907, respectively.

During the construction of the Singer Tower, the original Singer Building was shored up and additional foundations were built. The top three stories of the old Singer Building, including the mansard roof, were temporarily taken apart in June 1907, so that four more stories could be inserted above the existing seventh story. As such, the old eighth story of the old Singer Building became the new 12th story. This added of usable space without disturbing tenants on the lower floors. Several columns were erected at the old building&#x27;s front and rear elevations, extending from the basement to the 11th floor to support the raised roof. Holes were created in the existing floors of the Singer Building so that they could be supported by steel columns instead of by the bearing walls. The old Singer Building was extended north by , the three extra bays on Broadway having the same style as the original two.In the Bourne Building, the three existing elevators were removed and replaced with four elevators, necessitating the complete replacement of the framing around the old elevator shafts. A small window replaced the main entrance to the original Singer Building.

===Completion and further use===
On May 1, 1908, the tower was opened to the public. The construction workers held a dinner that week to celebrate the completion of work. A month later, on June 23, the observation balcony opened. The Singer Building quickly became a symbol of Manhattan with its floodlit tower. Surpassing Philadelphia City Hall in height, the Singer Building remained the tallest in the world for a year after its tower&#x27;s completion. The record was surpassed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, at 24th Street and Madison Avenue.

In the building&#x27;s first few months, the elevators were involved in at least two deaths; a painter was decapitated on May 4, 1908, while a plumber&#x27;s assistant was crushed between an elevator cab and a shaft on July 24, 1908. In a publicity stunt in 1911, the aviator Harry Atwood flew around the Singer Building. The expanded building&#x27;s tenants included the Chatham and Phenix National Bank, whose main office moved to the Singer Building in 1916. The Safe Deposit Company of New York originally used the vaults. The power source for the building&#x27;s steam plant was converted from coal to oil in 1921, making the Singer Building the city&#x27;s first office building to use oil as a fuel.

In 1921, the Singer Company placed the building up for sale at an asking price of $10 million. Four years later, the company made an agreement with a buyer representing the Utilities Power and Light Corporation, a holding company for several states&#x27; power companies. The transaction involved a cash deal of $8.5 million. According to property records, the sale was never finalized. Also in 1925, a subbasement vault was dug for the Chatham and Phenix National Bank after the bank&#x27;s merger with the Metropolitan Trust Company, and three of the lower floors were renovated for the bank&#x27;s use.The Singer Company made relatively few changes to the building; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the firm was &quot;wise enough to leave magnificence alone&quot;. Over the Singer Building&#x27;s existence, its lighting system was changed at least five times. The copper ornamentation on the tower&#x27;s dome was restored in 1939. The flagpole and roof cresting were removed entirely in early 1947. The building experienced an electrical fire in 1949 that forced the evacuation of the entire building, although only one person was injured. To comply with modern building codes, automatic elevators were installed in either 1957 or 1959. In addition, some offices received air conditioning, though they retained their original thermostats. The revolving doors at the base had been removed by 1958, being replaced with standard doors. Toward the end of its existence, the Singer Building&#x27;s two large ground-level storefronts were subdivided into smaller ones.

===Demolition===
Taller buildings continued to be constructed in New York City; by its 50th anniversary in 1958, the Singer Building was only the 16th tallest in the city. Singer announced it would sell the building in 1961, and the company moved to 30 Rockefeller Plaza. According to property records, Iacovone Rose bought the Singer Building and immediately sold it to Financial Place Inc. Real estate developer William Zeckendorf acquired the building and attempted to convince the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to move there. The plans failed after the NYSE opted to expand its existing headquarters instead. Even so, the construction of the World Trade Center nearby in the mid-1960s caused real-estate values in Lower Manhattan to increase dramatically. In 1964, United States Steel bought the Singer and City Investing buildings. U.S. Steel planned to demolish the entire block to erect a 50- or 54-story headquarters on the same site. Meanwhile, under U.S. Steel&#x27;s ownership, the Singer Building began to decay.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) was created in 1965, in the wake of several notable buildings in the city having either been demolished or threatened with demolition. Although the Singer Building was considered to be one of the most iconic buildings in New York City, the LPC never considered designating it as a landmark, which would have prevented the building&#x27;s demolition. In August 1967, LPC executive director Alan Burnham said that, if the building were to have been made a landmark, the city would have to either find a buyer or acquire the building on its own. Sam Roberts later wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the Singer Building had been one of the city&#x27;s notable structures that &quot;weren&#x27;t considered worth preserving&quot;. Demolition had commenced by September 1967, despite protests by &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; magazine and other preservationists, who suggested incorporating the lobby into the U.S. Steel Building. A writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed in March 1968 that the lobby looked like &quot;a bomb had hit it&quot;. The last piece of scrap had been carted away in early 1969, when the &quot;Daily News&quot; observed: &quot;The Singer fell victim to a malady called progress.&quot;

The U.S. Steel Building (later known as One Liberty Plaza) was built on the site and completed in 1973. One Liberty Plaza contained per floor, compared with the per floor in the Singer Building&#x27;s tower. One Liberty Plaza had at least twice the two former buildings&#x27; combined interior area. At the time of the Singer Building&#x27;s demolition, it was the tallest building ever to be destroyed. The record was surpassed during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which caused the collapse of the nearby World Trade Center. The Singer Building remained the tallest building to be destroyed by its owners until 2019, when workers started demolishing the 270 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. In the 21st century, the Singer Building became a subject of the unfounded Tartaria conspiracy theory, which claimed that the skyscraper was evidence of a long-lost civilization.

== Impact ==
Flagg, a noted critic of existing skyscrapers, justified taking on the project as a way of generating support for skyscraper reform, by convincing the public that such tall skyscrapers were detrimental because they blocked light from reaching the surrounding streets. As late as 1904, one architectural magazine wrote that &quot;ten stories were his limit&quot;. According to Flagg, buildings over tall, or 10 to 15 stories, needed to have a setback tower occupying no more than a quarter of the lot. He had once written, &quot;Our rooms and offices are becoming so dark that we must use artificial light all day long.&quot; The Singer Building&#x27;s design expressed Flagg&#x27;s opinions on city planning and skyscraper design. The building&#x27;s design partly influenced the city&#x27;s 1916 Zoning Resolution, which required many skyscrapers in New York City to have setbacks as they rose. For over four decades, the ordinance prevented the city&#x27;s new skyscrapers from overwhelming the streets with their sheer bulk. These setbacks were not required if the building occupied 25 percent or less of its lot area.

&quot;New York Times&quot; architectural critic Christopher Gray said in 2005 that the Singer Building&#x27;s tower resembled &quot;a bulbous mansard and giant lantern&quot;. Architectural writer Jason Barr stated in 2016 that the Singer Building was a &quot;transitional building&quot; in skyscraper development. Landau and Condit described the building as &quot;an aesthetic triumph that enriched the city by demonstrating the sculptural possibilities of the steel-framed skyscraper&quot;. &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; wrote in 1957 that the Singer Building was a &quot;very coherent, virile piece of design&quot;. Just before the building&#x27;s demolition, &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; wrote that the building was &quot;distinguished for more than mere height&quot;. Ada Louise Huxtable said, &quot;The master never produced a more impressive ruin than the Singer Building under demolition.&quot;

Not all critics appraised the Singer Building positively. &quot;The New York Globe&quot; in the 1900s had called the Singer Building an &quot;architectural giraffe&quot; and said such a tall building would hinder the ability of fire services to rescue people on the upper floors.

<text>San Jose del Monte, officially the City of San Jose del Monte (abbreviated as SJDM or CSJDM; ; ; ; ; ), is a component city in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 651,813 people, making it the largest local government unit within the province of Bulacan and Central Luzon, and the 18th most populated city in the Philippines.

It was proclaimed as a component city on 10 September 2000, through Republic Act No. 8797. Its conversion into a highly urbanized city was by the virtue of Proclamation No. 1057 issued by President Rodrigo Duterte on 4 December 2020; the conversion was rejected on a referendum held on 30 October 2023, by the voters of Bulacan including the concerned city.

==Etymology==
San José del Monte derived its name from Saint Joseph, whose statue was found in a veritable forest. The hunters called it as such, which means “Saint Joseph of the Mountain” in Spanish.

==History==
Early accounts of the founding of the city, as gathered from the old people, contend that it was formerly a part of the town of Meycauayan. This is supported by a decree from the Archbishop of Manila dated March 1750 on the creation of new municipalities. The municipality of San Jose del Monte was then officially founded on 2 March 1752.

The decree included the list of families who volunteered to be relocated. These families, most if not all from Lagulo (now Malhacan) in Meycauayan, brought with them rice, wine, nganga, and salt in exchange for the wild pigs, deer, yantok, and almasigan of the Itas and Dumagats, the native inhabitants of the area. Solares, including intended lots for main roads, were peacefully distributed to the new occupants after being measured and surveyed.

In all probability, the hunters reported their findings to the parish priest of Meycauayan. It was said that the priest built a stone church at the site where the town proper is now located. The statue was installed in the new church. Extant Catholic Church records reveal that the first parish priest was Father Antonio de Moral. He took charge of the parish in 1845.

During the revolt against Spain, the town became a battleground between the Katipuneros and the Spanish forces. The revolutionaries lost and the vengeful Spanish soldiers burned down the settlement. The townspeople fled for their lives to nearby towns. At the advent of American rule, it was made a part of Santa Maria until 1918 when the town was recreated and Ciriaco Gallardo appointed the first municipal president. Public schools were opened at the start of the American regime but due to the scarcity of the population, the highest grade organized was at the fourth grade.

During the Japanese occupation, the town became an ideal hiding place for the locally recognized guerrillas because of the town&#x27;s hilly and wooden terrain. The Japanese Imperial Army took over the local government of San Jose del Monte from 1942 to 1943. In resistance, the municipality formed its guerrilla unit. San Jose del Monte experienced large casualties when the Americans bombed the town center on 11 January 1945, and again on 14 January 1945. When the combined Filipino and American troops came, peace reigned but not for long.

At the height of the Hukbalahap Rebellion, the town was raided on 10 October 1950. The Huks burned down the town hall. The town was raided for the second time on 21 March 1951. The Huks did not succeed because of the precautionary measures instituted by the town officials after which the Huks were gradually eliminated.

In the 1980s, thousands of informal settlers from Metro Manila were relocated to San Jose del Monte. Due to the large number of residents, Bulacan Governor Roberto Pagdanganan recalled in 1996 that the relocation did not ensure new livelihoods for its informal settlers, thus turning many squatters toward criminality; he noted that the town had the highest crime rate in the province according to police reports.

In 1988, Eduardo Roquero was elected mayor of the municipality by a margin of eight (8) votes against his closest opponent, reelectionist Reynaldo Villano.

On 14 February 2024, Luneta Morales, an 83-year-old choir member was killed due to chest injuries while 63 attendees suffered multiple injuries when the &quot;Vicariate of Saint Joseph&quot; Saint Peter the Apostle Church (San Jose del Monte, Bulacan) 30-year-old balcony-gallery, weakened by infesting termites collapsed during an Ash Wednesday service past 7 a.m. Dennis Villarojo said &quot;those affected and their families are being assisted by the Diocese of Malolos with parish priest Fr. Rómulo Pérez and his parochial vicar Fr. Divino Cayanan.

On 13 February 2025, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) unveiled the city’s first historical marker on Saint Joseph the Worker Parish at Barangay Población I, recognizing its historical value for the city since its construction first as a &quot;visita&quot; of Meycauayan before becoming a separate parish on 11 February 1752, more than a month after San José del Monte became a separate municipality. This comes with the groundbreaking event for constructing the San José del Monte Historical Center () at the former city hall site before its transfer to Barangay Dulong Bayan. It would be the city’s first museum.

===Cityhood===
====2000 plebiscite and later events====
In December 1999, district representative Angelito Sarmiento filed the bill converting the then municipality of San Jose del Monte into a component city. This was approved on July 15, 2000 as &quot;Republic Act No. 8797&quot;.

A plebiscite was held on September 10, 2000. Despite a low turnout, the cityhood was approved mostly by migrants, mainly from Metro Manila which composed seventy percent of the residents by then; only nine of the 59 villages voted against the bill. The official proclamation was held in the evening. San Jose del Monte became the first city in Bulacan since Malolos failed in the cityhood bid in December 1999. (Malolos was eventually declared a city in 2002 by the Commission on Elections which had reversed the official result following a recount.) It was also recorded as the country&#x27;s 86th chartered city.

Through &quot;RA No. 9230&quot;, amending the city charter and approved on December 18, 2003, the city was granted its own legislative district, the province&#x27;s first lone district, while &quot;barangays&quot; were classified into two districts for purposes of representation in the &quot;Sangguniang Panlungsod&quot;. Officers were to be first elected in 2004.

====Highly urbanized city====
On 4 December 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte declared San Jose del Monte as a highly urbanized city through Proclamation No. 1057. However, it will have to go through a plebiscite to ratify its city charter. It was supposed to be held four months after the 2022 national and local elections but it was overdue ever since then. Hence, the proclamation remained pending for its HUC status for a long time beyond the national and local elections. On 11 September 2023, COMELEC, released a resolution that synchronized the plebiscite on 30 October 2023, along with the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections.

The majority of voters rejected the conversion, as declared by the COMELEC two days after the plebiscite. Meanwhile, a tenth of those who joined did not vote, leaving blank ballots.

==Geography==
The elevation of the city ranges from approximately above sea level; the relief transitions from warm lowland to cool upland as one goes eastward. This is because the city is part of the Sierra Madre mountain range. Plains and river valley flats characterize the western and southwestern quadrant. The central portion and much of its eastern section are made up of undulating hills with low relief. High relief areas and moderate slopes best describe its extreme eastern and northwestern quadrant. Slopes of 3%-8% are extensively found in the city, particularly in the western half. Slopes of 30%-50% comprise the smallest portion of the total land area.

The rivers and creeks that flow in San Jose del Monte are direct tributaries of the Angat River, which flows from the Angat Reservoir. Major natural waterways of San Jose del Monte are the Kipungok, Santo Cristo, and Santa Maria River systems. Kipungok River separates San Jose del Monte from Caloocan and Rodriguez. It is directly connected to the Marilao River, which flows downwards to Manila Bay. Draining to these rivers are creeks and streams, which act as catchment areas for the surface water runoff of the city. Among these are the Bigte, Kantulot, Katinga, and Salamin creeks.

Located in the southeast of the province, it is bordered by the cities of Caloocan and Quezon City in Metro Manila to the south, by the municipality of Rodríguez in Rizal to the east, the municipalities of Santa María and Marilao to the west and Norzagaray to the north. San Jose del Monte is from Malolos and from Manila.

The city is home to some of the biggest resettlement areas in the Philippines like the Sapang Palay resettlement area spread over 36 barangays, Pabahay 2000 in Barangay Muzon South, and Towerville in Barangay Minuyan Proper. Most of the city&#x27;s population come from former informal settlers along the creeks, esteros, riverbanks and railway tracks of Metro Manila.

===General Land Use===

Growing commercial, residential, and light industrial areas, are found all over the city at major road intersections and along major thoroughfares. However, the bulk of San Jose del Monte&#x27;s built-up areas are mostly west of Quirino Highway at the primary level to gently sloping 8% terrain, dividing the city into a heavily built-up western section and the largely agricultural eastern section. Most of the city&#x27;s schools, government institutions, commercial developments, industries, and other urban amenities are in this section. The largest contiguous built-up area is at Sapang Palay Resettlement Project area, followed by the conurbation in Tungkong Mangga and Muzon.

The developments east of the Quirino Highway are mostly scattered residential areas and agricultural lands. However, there are a few subdivisions that are some distance away from Ciudad Real and take advantage of its secluded and rural atmosphere. These are the Blessed Sacrament Seminary and an Augustinian convent.

In between the built-up clusters are pockets of agricultural lands, which are continuously converted into built-up uses. Planted in these lands are crops such as rice and corn. The clustering pattern for both built-up and agricultural uses is partly due to the decisions made by settlers about the hilly conditions that dominate the topography. Most households in the western half of San Jose del Monte opted to convert their lands to residential uses while others maintained the farms. This left upland uses, such as those about forest use, more common towards the easternmost zones.

Most vegetative outgrowths are in areas that are difficult to build on. But there are instances when these outgrowths are integrated into the built-up areas, usually found in the West: several heavily vegetated areas. Supplementing these are mini forest projects of the city government. The City Agriculture Office maintains a Mini Forest Project in Barangay Muzon along the San Jose del Monte–Marilao Road and a mahogany planting site.

===Barangays===

San Jose del Monte is politically subdivided into 62 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

It is originally made up of only five barangays: Poblacion, Halang (Muzon), Sapang Palay, Santo Cristo, and Gaya-Gaya. Over time, these five mother barangays were divided to provide better accommodation for the people, particularly in the Sapang Palay Resettlement Area (Hacienda de Sapang Palay), which stretches to Minuyan.

There is an ongoing land dispute with the municipality of Norzagaray, Bulacan regarding both territories. Such disputes can be located in the upper portion of Assumption, the eastern portion of Santo Niño II, the eastern portion of San Martin de Porres, the eastern portion of Lawang Pari, the eastern portion of Minuyan Proper, Kaybanban, San Roque, Paradise III, San Isidro, the upper portion of Tungkong Mangga, the upper portion of Ciudad Real barangays in San Jose del Monte and lower portion of Tigbe, the lower portion of Bitungol, the lower portion of Minuyan, lower portion of Bigte, lower portion of San Mateo (Sitio Karahume), mountainous portion of San Lorenzo in Norzagaray.

Historical maps of Bulacan, before the creation of Doña Remedios Trinidad, indicate that &quot;both territories&quot; of San Jose del Monte and Norzagaray stretch up to Tayabas province.

These barangays are grouped into two districts, the first with a ZIP Code of 3023, and the second with 3024. Twenty-six (26) barangays comprise the first district while the 36 barangays located in Sapang Palay compose the second district.

The city&#x27;s former administrative center was located in Población 1, which is now transferred to Dulong Bayan, which is now the city&#x27;s new seat of government. San Jose del Monte has 4 major urban centers, called nodes: Muzon node (consisting of the four barangays of Muzon), Poblacion node (consisting of the two barangays of Población), Sapang Palay node (consisting of the barangays surrounding Sampol Market), and Tungkong Mangga node.

The most recently created barangays are Muzon Proper, Muzon East, Muzon West, and Muzon South created by dividing Barangay Muzon. The four barangays were made through the approval of a law on 25 March 2023 through a referendum.
==Demographics==
In the 2020 census, the population of San Jose del Monte was 651,813 people, with a density of . This makes it the largest local government unit in Bulacan province. It is also the largest city in Central Luzon (Region III).

With the coming of settlers to San Jose del Monte, its population increased tremendously. Its population increased dramatically since the 1950s as the population tended to move from rural areas to towns and cities. Its proximity to Manila allowed it to accommodate its spillover population. This is further hastened by the development of nearby Quezon City and the accompanying increase in population and infrastructure.

The forced relocation of informal settlers and the lure of government to provide them with their own homes allowed the town to continue to grow despite the lack of government facilities. As such, San Jose del Monte exhibited an increasing percentage share of the provincial population from as low as 2% in 1960 to 9% in 1990 and then to 17% in 2015. The town surpassed the population of Meycauayan in the 1980 census and Malolos in the 1990 census, then the largest towns of Bulacan. By 2015, it has more than two times the population of the now second place Santa María town (256,454 people in the 2015 Census).

If current population growth holds (2010-2015, +4.55%), the population of San Jose del Monte is expected to double and breach one million by the 2030 Census.
===Languages===
The city, along with the municipalities of San Miguel, Doña Remedios Trinidad, and Norzagaray, is the homeland of the Dumagat Kabuloan or Alta Kabuloan, the first inhabitants of Bulacan, with a language named exactly as their people. Their language is currently endangered and is in dire need of local government intervention. The majority of residents in the town are native speakers of the Tagalog language.

==Economy==
===Agriculture===

Major crops are leafy vegetables, root crops (cassava as its OTOP), pineapple, mango, and coffee beans.

===Livestock and poultry===
The major income earner is large- and small-scale swine production. There are 60 commercial livestock and poultry farms in the city. The major poultry producers are RFM Corporation, Vitarich, and FELDAN.

===Trade and commerce===

The city has three major business district growth areas: Tungkong Mangga, Muzon, and Sapang Palay (Sampol). They are in wholesale and retail trade.

The minor business districts include Towerville in Minuyan Proper, Palmera in Kaypian, Northgate in Santo Cristo, Citrus, Poblacion 1, Grotto in Graceville, Francisco Homes, Gumaoc, and San Rafael III.

<doc id="306951" wikidata="Q192465" url="?curid=306951" title="Chick Corea">
<text>Armando Anthony &quot;Chick&quot; Corea (June 12, 1941 – February 9, 2021) was an American jazz pianist, composer, bandleader and occasional percussionist. His compositions &quot;Spain&quot;, &quot;500 Miles High&quot;, &quot;La Fiesta&quot;, &quot;Armando&#x27;s Rhumba&quot; and &quot;Windows&quot; are widely considered jazz standards. As a member of Miles Davis&#x27;s band in the late 1960s, he participated in the birth of jazz fusion. In the 1970s he formed Return to Forever. Along with McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock and Keith Jarrett, Corea is considered to have been one of the foremost pianists of the post-John Coltrane era.

Corea continued to collaborate frequently while exploring different musical styles throughout the 1980s and 1990s. As of January 2025, he has won 28 Grammy Awards and was nominated 72 times for the award.

==Early life and education==
Armando Corea was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, on June 12, 1941, to parents Anna (née Zaccone) and Armando J. Corea. He was of southern Italian descent, his father having been born to an immigrant from Albi, a commune in the Province of Catanzaro in the Calabria region. His father, a trumpeter who led a Dixieland band in Boston in the 1930s and 1940s, introduced him to the piano at the age of four. Surrounded by jazz, he was influenced at an early age by bebop and musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Horace Silver, and Lester Young. He came into possession of a drumset at age 11, and would occasionally play drums for the rest of his career.

Corea developed his piano skills while exploring music on his own. At first, his father taught him piano, but eventually, the elder Corea thought it proper that his son receive instruction from a professional teacher. At the age of eight, he began taking formal lessons with Italian concert pianist Salvatore Sullo. Sullo was indifferent to the young Corea’s passion for jazz, instead teaching him to play classical piano, but being introduced to classical music helped spark Corea’s interest in musical composition.

Given a black tuxedo by his father, he started playing gigs while still in high school. He enjoyed listening to Herb Pomeroy&#x27;s band at the time and had a trio that played Horace Silver&#x27;s music at a local jazz club. He eventually moved to New York City, where he studied music at Columbia University, then transferred to the Juilliard School. He later dropped out so he could spend more time playing gigs.

==Career==

Corea began his professional recording and touring career in the early 1960s with Mongo Santamaria, Willie Bobo, Blue Mitchell, Herbie Mann, and Stan Getz. In 1966, he recorded his debut album, &quot;Tones for Joan&#x27;s Bones&quot;. In March 1968, he recorded the highly regarded trio album, &quot;Now He Sings, Now He Sobs&quot;, with drummer Roy Haynes and bassist Miroslav Vitouš.

In the fall of 1968, Corea began recording and touring with Miles Davis, appearing on the widely praised Davis studio albums &quot;Filles de Kilimanjaro&quot;, &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, and &quot;On the Corner&quot;. He also appeared on later compilation albums &quot;Big Fun&quot;, &quot;Water Babies&quot;, and &quot;Circle in the Round&quot;. He left Davis&#x27; band shortly after its performance at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival.

Bassist Dave Holland departed the Davis group with Corea to form their own group, Circle, with multireedist Anthony Braxton and drummer Barry Altschul. They were active from 1970 to 1971, and recorded on Blue Note and ECM. In 1971, Corea, at the behest of ECM producer Manfred Eicher, began playing solo piano, recording the sessions that became &quot;Piano Improvisations Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Piano Improvisations Vol. 2&quot; in April of that year. In 1974, Corea collaborated with Richie Grasso on the latter&#x27;s album &quot;Season of Grace&quot;, produced by Morris Levy&#x27;s Tiger Lily Records.

===Jazz fusion===

Named after their eponymous 1972 album, Corea&#x27;s Return to Forever band relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation, and initially drew upon Hispanic music styles more than rock music. On their first two records, the group consisted of Flora Purim on vocals and percussion, Joe Farrell on flute and soprano saxophone, Miles Davis bandmate Airto on drums and percussion, and Stanley Clarke on acoustic double bass. Drummer Lenny White and guitarist Bill Connors later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which blended the earlier Latin music elements with rock and funk-oriented music. This incarnation of the band recorded the album &quot;Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy&quot;, before Connors&#x27; replacement by Al Di Meola, who later played on &quot;Where Have I Known You Before&quot;, &quot;No Mystery&quot; and &quot;Romantic Warrior&quot;.

In 1976, Corea released &quot;My Spanish Heart&quot;, influenced by Hispanic music and featuring vocalist Gayle Moran (Corea&#x27;s wife) and violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. The album combined jazz and flamenco, supported by Minimoog synthesizer and a horn section. He collaborated with flamenco guitarist Paco De Lucía years later on the &quot;Touchstone&quot; and &quot;Zyryab&quot; albums.

===Duet projects===

In the 1970s, Corea started working with vibraphonist Gary Burton, with whom he recorded several duet albums for ECM, including 1972&#x27;s &quot;Crystal Silence&quot;. They reunited in 2006 for a concert tour. A new record called &quot;The New Crystal Silence&quot; was issued in 2008 and won a Grammy Award in 2009. The package includes a disc of duets and another disc with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.

Towards the end of the 1970s, Corea embarked on a series of concerts with fellow pianist Herbie Hancock. These concerts were presented in elegant settings with both artists dressed formally and performing on concert grand pianos. The two played each other&#x27;s compositions, as well as pieces by other composers such as Béla Bartók, and duets. In 1982, Corea performed &quot;The Meeting&quot;, a live duet with the classical pianist Friedrich Gulda.

In December 2007, Corea recorded a duet album, &quot;The Enchantment&quot;, with banjoist Béla Fleck. Fleck and Corea toured extensively for the album in 2007. Fleck was nominated in the Best Instrumental Composition category at the 49th Grammy Awards for the track &quot;Spectacle&quot;.

In 2008, Corea collaborated with Japanese pianist Hiromi Uehara on the live album &quot;Duet (Chick Corea and Hiromi)&quot;. The duo played a concert at Tokyo&#x27;s Budokan arena on April 30.

In 2015, he reprised the duet concert series with Hancock, again sticking to a dueling-piano format, though both now integrated synthesizers into their repertoire. The first concert in this series was at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle and included improvisations, compositions by the duo, and standards by other composers.

===Later work===
Corea&#x27;s other bands included the Chick Corea Elektric Band, its trio reduction called &quot;Akoustic Band&quot;, Origin, and its trio reduction called the New Trio. Corea signed a record deal with GRP Records in 1986 which led to the release of ten albums between 1986 and 1994, seven with the Elektric Band, two with the Akoustic Band, and a solo album, &quot;Expressions&quot;.

The Akoustic Band released a self-titled album in 1989 and a live follow-up, &quot;Alive&quot;, in 1991, both featuring John Patitucci on bass and Dave Weckl on drums. It marked a return to traditional jazz trio instrumentation in Corea&#x27;s career, and the bulk of his subsequent recordings have featured acoustic piano.

In 1992, Corea started his own label, Stretch Records.
In 2001, the Chick Corea New Trio, with bassist Avishai Cohen and drummer Jeff Ballard, released the album &quot;Past, Present &amp; Futures&quot;. The eleven-song album includes only one standard (Fats Waller&#x27;s &quot;Jitterbug Waltz&quot;). The rest of the tunes are Corea originals. He participated in 1998&#x27;s &quot;Like Minds&quot; with old associates Gary Burton on vibraphone, Dave Holland on bass, Roy Haynes on drums, and Pat Metheny playing guitars.

During the later part of his career, Corea also explored contemporary classical music. He composed his first piano concerto—an adaptation of his signature piece &quot;Spain&quot; for a full symphony orchestra—and performed it in 1999 with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2004, he composed his first work without keyboards: his String Quartet No. 1 was written for the Orion String Quartet and performed by them at 2004&#x27;s Summerfest in Wisconsin.

Corea continued recording fusion albums such as &quot;To the Stars&quot; (2004) and &quot;Ultimate Adventure&quot; (2006). The latter won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group.

In 2008, the third version of Return to Forever (Corea, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, and Di Meola) reunited for a worldwide tour. The reunion received positive reviews from jazz and mainstream publications. Most of the group&#x27;s studio recordings were re-released on the compilation &quot;Return to Forever: The Anthology&quot; to coincide with the tour. A concert DVD recorded during their performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival was released in May 2009. He also worked on a collaboration CD with the vocal group The Manhattan Transfer.

A new group, the Five Peace Band, began a world tour in October 2008. The ensemble included John McLaughlin, whom Corea had previously worked with in Miles Davis&#x27;s late 1960s bands, including the group that recorded Davis&#x27;s classic album &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;. Joining Corea and McLaughlin were saxophonist Kenny Garrett and bassist Christian McBride. Drummer Vinnie Colaiuta played with the band in Europe and on select North American dates; Brian Blade played all dates in Asia and Australia, and most dates in North America. The vast reach of Corea&#x27;s music was celebrated in a 2011 retrospective with Corea guesting with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts; a &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer had high praise for the occasion: &quot;Mr. Corea was masterly with the other musicians, absorbing the rhythm and feeding the soloists. It sounded like a band, and Mr. Corea had no need to dominate; his authority was clear without raising volume.&quot;

A new band, Chick Corea &amp; The Vigil, featured Corea with bassist Hadrien Feraud, Marcus Gilmore on drums (carrying on from his grandfather, Roy Haynes), saxes, flute, and bass clarinet from Origin vet Tim Garland, and guitarist Charles Altura.

Corea celebrated his 75th birthday in 2016 by playing with more than 20 different groups during a six-week stand at the Blue Note Jazz Club in Greenwich Village, New York City. &quot;I pretty well ignore the numbers that make up &#x27;age&#x27;. It seems to be the best way to go. I have always just concentrated on having the most fun I can with the adventure of music.&quot;

==Personal life==
Corea and his first wife Joanie had two children, Thaddeus and Liana; the marriage ended in divorce. In 1972, Corea married his second wife, vocalist/pianist Gayle Moran.

In 1968, Corea read &quot;&quot;, author L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s most well-known self-help book, and developed an interest in Hubbard&#x27;s other works in the early 1970s: &quot;I came into contact with L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s material in 1968 with &quot;Dianetics&quot; and it kind of opened my mind up and it got me into seeing that my potential for communication was a lot greater than I thought it was.&quot;

Corea said that Scientology became a profound influence on his musical direction in the early 1970s: &quot;I no longer wanted to satisfy myself. I really want to connect with the world and make my music mean something to people.&quot; With Clarke Corea played on &quot;Space Jazz: The soundtrack of the book Battlefield Earth&quot;, a 1982 album to accompany L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s novel &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;.

Corea was excluded from a concert during the 1993 World Championships in Athletics in Stuttgart, Germany. The concert&#x27;s organizers excluded him after the state government of Baden-Württemberg had announced it would review its subsidies for events featuring avowed members of Scientology. After Corea&#x27;s complaint against this policy before the administrative court was unsuccessful in 1996, members of the United States Congress, in a letter to the German government, denounced the ban as a violation of Corea&#x27;s human rights. Corea was not banned from performing in Germany, however, and had several appearances at the government-supported International Jazz Festival in Burghausen; he was awarded a plaque on Burghausen&#x27;s &quot;Street of Fame&quot; in 2011.

Corea died at his home in Tampa, Florida, from a rare cancer on February 9, 2021, shortly after his diagnosis. He was 79.

In 2010, he was named &quot;Doctor Honoris Causa&quot; at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

<text>Milton is a town in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,723. According to local legend, the town was named after the English poet John Milton, but the name most likely originated from William FitzWilliam, 4th Earl FitzWilliam, who held the title Viscount Milton and was a supporter of independence for the colonies during the American Revolution.

Milton has a municipal building, school system, library, police force, fire department, rescue squad, several churches, as well as civic and social organizations. The Town website can be found here: https://www.miltonvt.gov/

==History==
Milton was chartered by Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire on June 8, 1763. In February 1782, the town was first settled by William Irish, Leonard Owen, Amos Mansfield, Absalom Taylor, and Thomas Dewey. There were approximately 300 settlers living in Milton by 1795. It was necessary to build a new meeting place, as meeting in private homes would no longer suffice. The Town House was built in 1849. In 1878, it was destroyed by a fire. 

Early settlers in Milton made most of their income from lumber and potash until 1840, when dairy became popular and butter and cheese were sold. Eventually, milk was also shipped to Boston and New York.

Milton was the home of Catamount Speedway, which operated from 1965 until 1988. Many drivers who raced there went on to prominent careers, including Shelburne native Kevin Lepage.

==Geography==
Milton is located in northern Chittenden County, bordered by Franklin County to the north and Grand Isle County to the northwest, across an arm of Lake Champlain. The town includes the community of Milton in the east, as well as the communities of Cozy Corner, West View, Checkerberry Village, Milton Falls, Milton Village, and West Milton from east to west across the center of the town. The Lamoille River flows from northeast to southwest across the town, entering Lake Champlain at the town&#x27;s southwestern corner. U.S. Route 2 crosses the eastern arm of Lake Champlain to Grand Isle from Sand Point, just north of the Lamoille River delta. Sand Bar State Park is located along Route 2.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Milton has a total area of , of which is land and , or 15.62%, is water.

== Communities ==
Milton is home to many communities many of which exist due to the travel limitations before the automobile, as such many now only house people and have no churchs, stores, or schools. A list of the Communities of the Town of Milton:

* Milton Falls (based around the Route 7 Main Street intersection)
* Milton Village (based around the Milton schools and Milton Square)
* Cozy Corners (based around the Middle Road Railroad Street intersection)
* West View (located between Checkerberry Village and Cozy Corners)
* Checkerberry Village (based around Checkerberry Square which now longer exists) 
* West Milton (everything west of the La Moille/Lamoille river plus some land mainly on the riverbank of the east side of the La Moille/Lamoille river)
* Miltonboro Village (based around the Miltonboro Church [Miltonboro church no longer exists] and Cemetery)
* Miltonboro (North West Corner of the Town of Milton)
* Sopertown (based around the Everst Rd, Beebe Hill Rd intersection)

Milton Falls was where historically many businesses operated, although now most businesses operate in Milton Village, many of the larger commercial businesses are located in Milton Square. Miltonboro Village is a small community completely surrounded by Miltonboro, it is where many who lived in West Milton and Miltonboro went to mail letters, go to church, get on the stagecoach or meet people getting off it. Miltonboro Village is not very relevant today as it is just made up of three houses and a cemetery, but at one point in time there was a stagecoach station, a post office, a church, a cemetery, some houses and farms, and possibly a general store many of which were located on a road that came off of Beebe Hill road and housed most of the aforementioned buildings, although said road is now gone and information or photos of Miltonboro are hard to find because during its time as a strong community it was very rural and not many photographs were taken.

<text>The Spike is a 1980 spy thriller novel by Arnaud de Borchgrave and Robert Moss (New York: Crown Publishers, 1980). Drawing on de Borchgrave&#x27;s experience as a jet-setting &quot;Newsweek&quot; journalist and conservative Washington insider, it tells the story of a radical &#x27;60s journalist, Bob Hockney, who stumbles upon a Soviet plot for global supremacy by 1985. When he tries to expose the web of blackmail, sex and espionage, he&#x27;s hamstrung by his editors&#x27; liberal media bias.

In the news world, to &quot;spike&quot; a story means to cancel its publication. De Borchgrave and Moss envision a scenario in which the KGB exploits the attitudes of the unsuspecting Western media, which was allegedly more interested in unmasking CIA agents than stopping the Soviets, threatening to thwart Hockney&#x27;s big scoop.

The best-selling book was marketed not only as a spy thriller but an exposé of real-life Washington. &quot;Time&quot; called the book a &quot;roman à clef&quot; for its fictionalized versions of real people and organizations, including Zbigniew Brzezinski and the radical left-wing magazine &quot;Ramparts&quot;.

In a 1980 interview with &quot;The New York Times,&quot; de Borchgrave mentions that he came up with the idea for a novel after he and his wife had to hide in the English countryside, after anonymous threats were made in response to a &quot;Newsweek&quot; article he wrote that named some of the terrorists behind the 1972 Munich massacre.

The authors&#x27; 1983 follow-up, &quot;Monimbo&quot;, envisioned Miami race rioters as the pawns of Nicaraguan and Cuban communists.

<text>The Yakama are a Native American tribe with nearly 10,851 members, based primarily in eastern Washington state.

Yakama people today are enrolled in the federally recognized tribe, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. Their Yakama Indian Reservation, along the Yakima River, covers an area of approximately 1.2 million acres (5,260 km2). Today the nation is governed by the Yakama Tribal Council, which consists of representatives of 14 tribes.

Many Yakama people engage in ceremonial, subsistence, and commercial fishing for salmon, steelhead, and sturgeon in the Columbia River and its tributaries, including within land ceded by the tribe to the United States. Their right to fish in their former territory is protected by treaties and was re-affirmed in late 20th-century court cases such as &quot;United States v. Washington&quot; (known as the Boldt Decision, 1974) and &quot;United States v. Oregon&quot; (&quot;Sohappy v. Smith&quot;, 1969), though more than a century of U.S. industrial pollution has contaminated these waterways with dangerous levels of toxic chemicals. The Columbia Basin Initiative aims to improve salmon-fishing for the tribe.

==Etymology==
Scholars disagree on the origins of the name Yakama. The Sahaptin words, &quot;E-yak-ma,&quot; means &quot;a growing family&quot;, and &quot;iyakima,&quot; means &quot;pregnant ones&quot;. Other scholars note the word, &quot;yákama,&quot; which means &quot;black bear,&quot; or &quot;ya-ki-ná,&quot; which means &quot;runaway&quot;.

They have also been referred to as the &quot;Waptailnsim,&quot; &quot;people of the narrow river,&quot; and &quot;Pa&#x27;kiut&#x27;lĕma,&quot; &quot;people of the gap,&quot; which describes the tribe&#x27;s location along the Yakima River. The Yakama identify as the &quot;Mamachatpam.&quot;

== Historic Yakama Band and Territories ==
″Yakima″ or ″Yakama″ was first a collective term for five (originally six) regional bands who spoke the same language or dialect of Sahaptin, also known as &quot;Ichishkíin Sɨ́nwit&quot; (″this language″). Usually they named the individual bands, village groups, local groups, and rivers after a specific rock formation, their main camps, or after an important village or fishing site.

The English names of the following local rivers were derived from Sahaptin: the Klickitat, Umatilla, Walla Walla, Palouse, Yakima, Satus, Toppenish, Tieton, and Wenatchee (in each case the original native term referred not to the river itself, which generally was left unnamed): 
* Yakama (proper) or Lower Yakama (Autonym in Yakama: Mámachatpam) – Chief Kamiakin&#x27;s people: Their territory encompasses the watershed of the Lower Yakima River east of the Cascade Range, hence they were called &quot;Lower Yakima&quot; to distinguish them from their upriver cousins – the ″Kittitas or Upper Yakama.″ As they were the largest group in population, they were often termed as &quot;Yakama&quot; or &quot;Yakama proper&quot;. Their lands stretched from Selah (″Quiet Water″) and Wenas just north of today&#x27;s Yakima south to the area around today&#x27;s Prosser (named for the nearby Prosser Falls as &quot;Tapteil, Tap tut, Toptut&quot; – ″rapids or falls″). All major rivers in this area – such as the Naches River, and Ahtanum, Toppenish and Satus reeks – are tributaries of the Yakima River.
** Síla-ħlama (along the Yakima River between Wenas and Umtanum creeks, the northernmost Lower Yakama Band)
** Wínas-ħlama (along Wenas Creek, the ″cross river″ between the Upper Yakama and Lower Yakama)
** Nahchísh-ħlama (″People along the Roaring Water, i.e. Naches River″), lived along the Tieton and Naches rivers (the latter meaning ″roaring, rough or turbulent water″), the largest tributary of the Yakima River. They were closely linked to the &quot;Taitnapam&quot; (″People of the Tieton River″) regional band west of the Cascade Range)
** Tkaíwaichaś-ħlama / Tkai&#x27;waichash-hlama (along Cowiche Creek near the eastern foothills of the Cascade Mountain range)
** Átanŭm-ħlama (″People along Ahtanum Creek″, named after their territory along Ahtanum Creek, a right tributary to the Yakima River, entering the Yakima River immediately upstream of Ahtanum Ridge anticline (Union Gap), their main village &quot;Pa&#x27;kiut / Páxutakyuu-t&quot; (&quot;both hills together or gap&quot;, &quot;heads joined&quot;) in the valley between Ahtanum Ridge and Rattlesnake Ridge was the most important of the Lower Yakama; hence the self-designation of this particular local or village group as &quot;Pa&#x27;kiut&#x27;-ħlama / Pa&#x27;kiut&#x27;lĕma&quot; (″People of the gap″, lit. ″People of Mountain Heads Coming Together″) was transferred by the Europeans as &quot;Pah-quy-ti-koot-lema /Pakiutlema&quot; or as &quot;Narrow River Indians&quot; to all Lower Yakama bands and later to neighboring Yakama bands to)
** Písko-ħlama / Pisko-pum (″Sagebrush People″, along Toppenish Creek of the Toppenish plains, a right tributary of the Yakima River)
** Sí-ħlama (on Yakima River above the mouth of Toppenish Creek)
** first Thápnĭś-ħlama / Thap-pah-nish (also on Toppenish Creek – Toppenish Creek was named after &quot;Tẋápniš / Txápni-sh&quot; (″that which suddenly goes forth″ or ″protruded, stuck out″, an allusion to a large landslide that occurred on the ridge south of White Swan, Washington – the contemporary Yakima Indian Reservation town of Toppenish is a corruption of this native term); this self-designation was transferred by the Europeans as &quot;Toppenish&quot; to refer to all Lower Yakama and neighboring Yakama bands)
** second Thápnĭś-ħlama / Thap-pah-nish (on Toppenish Creek north of the Simcoe Mountains (in Yakama: &quot;Sim Quwe&quot; – &quot;saddle back&quot; or ″a dip between two hills like a saddle back″)
** Símkoe-ħlama (along Simcoe Creek in the Simcoe Valley, later there was established Fort Simcoe, this area, originally known as &quot;Mool-mool&quot;, had been a camp site for the summer and early fall seasons) 
** Se&#x27;tas-ħlama / Setass-lema (on Satus Creek)
** Taptat-ħlama (″People at the rapids, i.e. Prosser Falls″, along Yakima River from the mouth of Satus Creek to present Kiona, with a key fishery at Prosser Falls (today: Prosser, in Yakama: &quot;Tapteil&quot;, &quot;Tap tut&quot;, &quot;Toptut&quot; – ″rapids, waterfalls″; this self-designation was also transferred by the Europeans as &quot;Tap-teil-lema / Tap-teil-min&quot; or its proper variant &quot;Waptail-lema / Waptailmim&quot; to all Lower Yakama and neighboring Yakama bands) 
* Upper Yakama or Kittitas (meaning of the word Kittitas vary – perhaps ″shale rock, white chalk, or white clay ″, but in any case the name probably refers to the region&#x27;s soil composition) (in Yakama: Pshwánwapam / Psch-wan-wap-pam / Pish-wana-pum – ″Many Rocks People″ or ″Stony Ground People″, also given as ″River Rock People″) – Chief Owhi&#x27;s and Chief Qualchan&#x27;s people: Their territory was usually north of Wenas Creek and Selah Creeks and along the Upper Yakima River, therefore they were called &quot;Upper Yakima&quot; in reference to the downriver living Yakama / Yakama proper (or Lower Yakama) bands. They occupied the northern Yakima River tributaries Cle Elum River (in Yakama: Tie-el-Lum – &quot;swift water&quot;), Teanaway River (in Yakama: Tyawnawí-ins – &quot;[salmon] drying place&quot;), Kachess River to the Wenatchee Mountains and Saddle Mountains in the east. Their territory included three large lakes in the Cascade Range (from east to west): Cle Elum Lake, Kachess Lake (&quot;more fish&quot;) and Keechelus Lake (&quot;few fish&quot;).
* Klikatat / Klickitat (a corruption of the place name &quot;látaxat&quot; for a key fishery at the falls of the Klickitat River or &quot;ládaxat&quot;, an Upper Chinook name for a Klickitat village with resident Kiksht-speaking Wishram, in Yakama: Xwálχwaypam / Qwû&#x27;lh-hwai-pûm / X̣ʷáɬx̣ʷaypam – ″Prairie People″ or ″People of the village χwálχway (Steller&#x27;s Jay&#x27;)″, located at the junction of the Klickitat and Little Klickitat Rivers) – Chief Slockish&#x27;s people: Their territory was generally situated north of the Columbia River, at the headwaters of the Cowlitz, Lewis, Washougal, White Salmon, and Klickitat rivers.
* Cowlitz Klickitat or Lewis River Klickitat Band, erroneously called Upper Cowlitz or Lewis River Cowlitz, sometimes Lewis River Chinook (in Yakama: Taitnapam / Taidnapam / Táitinpam – ″People of the Tieton River″): Closely allied with their Yakama kin (Áypaχ-pam – ″People of the Plains″ or ″People of the river mouth″) east of the Cascades – they had permanently occupied and controlled the Upper Cowlitz (shch&#x27;il) above Mossyrock, Cispus River (shíshpash), Tilton River (lalálx), the uppermost Nisqually River and Lewis River basins. They apparently intermarried with Salish-speaking Lower Cowlitz (in Yakama: T&#x27;lkwi&#x27;lipam / λ&#x27;kwílipam) communities downriver and travelled freely as far as the mouth of the Cowlitz River (in Yakama: shchil-aypáχ – ″Cowlitz River mouth″), as well as moving freely through adjacent Yakama-controlled territory east of the Cascade Crest. Their own name &quot;Taitnapam&quot; indicates that they originally came from east off the Cascades – along the Tieton River (in Yakama: Táitin) hence territory of the Nahchísh-ħlama, a Yakama/Lower Yakama band along the Naches River; they had strong linguistic and family ties to that band and to the Klikatat / Klickitat.
** Qw&#x27;:ltɫa&#x27;ma / Qwiilt-lá-ma (occupied the Mossyrock Prairie near Mossyrock on the east end of the Klickitat Prairie along Upper Cowlitz River)
** Lalalxɫa&#x27;ma / Lalalx-lá-ma (their main settlement &quot;lalálx&quot; was at the mouth of the Tilton River, which was also called &quot; lalálx &quot;)
** Wasaɫa&#x27;ma (lived around Morton at the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in the Tilton River Valley southwest of Mount Rainier)
** Nucnu:ɫa&#x27;ma (lived in Cowlitz River Canyon)
** Sw:ktsw&#x27;ktɫa&#x27;ma / Swikt-swikt-lá-ma (lived around today Nesika, Washington, on Riffe Lake, south of Morton and upriver of Mossyrock, and in Steel Canyon, Winters Mountain and Green Mountain)
** K&#x27;wpɫa&#x27;ma (lived at the Cowlitz Falls of Cowlitz River, which was a key fishery site)
** Cicpacɫa&#x27;ma (lived along Cispus River)
** Qiyanxuɫa&#x27;ma / Q&#x27;iyanxw-lá-ma (lived along Cowlitz River, ca. 7 miles west of Kiona, Washington)
** Ca&#x27;q&#x27;kɫa&#x27;ma / Shíq&#x27;k-lá-ma (lived along Kiona Creek, a tributary of the Cowlitz River)
* Wanapum / Wánapam (″River People″): They lived south of the Saddle Mountains on both sides of the Columbia River downriver to the mouth of the Snake River, most important settlement as well as fishing grounds was at Priest Rapids, 1953 the construction of the Priest Rapids Dam and the Wanapum Dam flooded the Wánapam living and fishing grounds to create the Priest Rapids Lake reservoir. Today still about 60 Wánapam are living near today&#x27;s Priest Rapids Dams. The Wanapam dreamer-prophet Smohalla (″Dreamer″ or ″Preacher″) was the most prominent leader of the Washane (&quot;Dreamer Religion&quot;), other prophets were Chief Homli (of the Walla Walla), Kotiakan (of the Pa&#x27;kiut&#x27;-ħlama local group of Lower Yakama) as well Lishwailait and Ashnithlai (both Klickitat). Adherents included Chief Joseph and his Nez Percé followers as well as Native people from other tribes in the region. 
* Mishalpam (in Yakama: Mical-ɫa&#x27;ma – ″Eatonville people″, lit. ″Mashel River people″), later called Upper (Mountain) Nisqually, today also commonly known as Meshal / Me-Schal / Mashel / Mica&#x27;l Band of Nisqually – Chief Leschi&#x27;s people: Their territory was generally on the west side of the Cascade Range and northwest of the kindred &quot;Klikatat / Klickitat&quot; and encompassed the Mashel River, tributary of the Nisqually, and the Upper Nisqually and Upper Puyallup River Valleys reaching up to Mount Rainier (Talol/Tacoma/Tahoma) (&quot;bigger than Mount Baker&quot;) – together with &quot;Klikatat / Klickitat&quot; they occupied Ohop Valley in Pierce County (around present-day cities Eatonville and Roy); their primary village site was &quot;Basha&#x27;labsh&quot; on Meshal River, near present-day La Grande, Washington. They intermarried with downstream and closer to the coast living Southern Lushootseed-speaking Nisqually (Squalli-Absh / Sqʷaliʼabš) (&quot;People of the Grassland&quot;), a Coast Salish people, had switched from Sahaptin to &quot;Nisqually / Sqʷali&#x27;abš&quot; no later than in the 19th century. Chief Leschi (from &quot;Basha&#x27;labsh&quot;, with a Yakama mother) was one of the most important leaders during the Puget Sound War (1855 und 1856) of an intertribal alliance of Coast Salish (Nisqually, Puyallup (S&#x27;Puyalupubsh) and Muckleshoot) and Sahaptin (Mishalpam, Klikatat / Klickitat and Yakama) peoples.

Their lands lay within the Yakima Rivers (in Yakama: &quot;Tapteal&quot; – ″rapids″ because of the waterfalls at Prosser, Washington) watershed and for the most part east of the Cascade Range, to the south along the northern tributaries of the Columbia River (in Yakama: &quot;Nch&#x27;i-Wána&quot; – ″great river″) (here the Yakama bands frequently lived in bilingual villages together with Southern/Columbia River Sahaptin-speaking bands: Umatilla, Skin-pah/Skin, Tenino/Warm Springs), to the southwest along the Lower Snake River and Columbia River (here the Yakama bands lived also in bilingual villages together with Lower Snake River Sahaptin-speaking local groups of Chamnapam/Chem-na-pum, Wauyukma and Naxiyampam), to the northeast their tribal territories ranged up to the Wenatchee River (because of frequently intermarriages some of the originally Interior Salish-speaking Wenatchi bands switched to Sahaptin as first language), in the north to the lakes of Cle Elum Lake (after the Upper Yakama / Kittitas name &quot;Tie-el-Lum&quot;, meaning &quot;swift water&quot;, referring to the Cle Elum River), Kachess Lake (&quot;more fish&quot;) and Keechelus Lake (&quot;few fish&quot;) at the headwaters of the Yakima River (with the directly northwest living Coast-Salish-speaking Snoqualmie the Yakama bands kept family ties), in the west across the Cascade Range to the headwaters of the Cowlitz River (shch&#x27;il), Lewis River ((wl&#x27;ɫt&#x27;kh) and White Salmon River (where there were also family ties with Coast-Salish-speaking Lower Cowlitz and Upper Chinookan/Kiksht-speaking Wasco-Wishram).

==History==

The Yakama people are similar to the other native inhabitants of the Columbia River Plateau. They were hunters and gatherers well known for trading salmon harvested from annual runs in the Columbia River. In 1805 or 1806, they encountered the Lewis and Clark Expedition at the confluence of the Yakima River and Columbia River.

As a consequence of the Walla Walla Council and the Yakima War of 1855, the tribe was forced to cede much of their land and move onto their present reservation. The Treaty of 1855 identified the 14 confederated tribes and bands of the Yakama, including &quot;Yakama (Lower Yakama or Yakama proper, autonym: Mámachatpam), Palouse (now written Palus, Yakama name: Pelúuspem), Pisquouse (P&#x27;squosa, now Wenatchi), Wenatshapam (Yakama name: Winátshapam, now Wenatchi), Klikatat (Yakama name: Xwálxwaypam or L&#x27;ataxat), Klinquit (a Yakama subtribe), Kow-was-say-ee (Yakama name: Kkáasu-i or K&#x27;kasawi, Tenino subtribe, today&#x27;s Crow Butte, Washington, opposite of Boardman, Oregon), Li-ay-was (not identified), Skin-pah (Sk&#x27;in tribe or Sawpaw, also known as Fall Bridge and Rock Creek people or K&#x27;milláma, a Tenino subtribe; perhaps another Yakama name for the Umatilla, which were known as Rock Creek Indians), Wish-ham (Yakama name: Wíshχam, now Wishram, speaking Upper Chinook (Kiksht)), Shyiks (a Yakama subtribe), Ochechotes (Uchi&#x27;chol, a Tenino subtribe), Kah-milt-pay (Kahmiltpah, Q&#x27;míl-pa or Qamil&#x27;lma, perhaps a Klikatat subtribe), and Se-ap-cat (Si&#x27;apkat, perhaps a Kittitas (Upper Yakama) subtribe, Kittitas autonym: Pshwánapam or Psch-wan-wap-pams), confederated tribes and bands of Indians, occupying lands hereinafter bounded and described and lying in Washington Territory, who for the purposes of this treaty are to be considered as one nation, under the name &#x27;Yakama&#x27;…&quot;. (Treaty with the Yakama, 1855) The name was changed from Yakima to Yakama in 1994 to reflect the native pronunciation.

== Language ==
Yakama is a northwestern dialect of Sahaptin, a Sahaptian language of the Plateau Penutian family. Since the late 20th century, some native speakers have argued to use the traditional Yakama name for this language, &quot;Ichishkíin Sínwit&quot;. The tribal Cultural Resources program wants to replace the word Sahaptin, which means &quot;stranger in the land&quot;.
