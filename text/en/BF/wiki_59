<text>Octavio Antonio Fernández Castro (June 30, 1962 – February 16, 2020), better known as Tony Fernández, was a Dominican baseball player who played as a shortstop in Major League Baseball (MLB) for seven teams from 1983 to 2001, most notably the Toronto Blue Jays. A five-time All-Star, Fernández was known for his defensive skills, winning four consecutive Gold Glove Awards (1986–1989). He batted over .300 four times, led the major leagues with 17 triples in 1990, collected 30 doubles six times and 20 stolen bases seven times. He also led American League shortstops in assists three times, and in putouts and fielding average twice each. After moving to the National League in a blockbuster trade following the 1990 season, he returned to the Blue Jays in a mid-season trade in 1993, and played a major role in helping the club repeat as World Series champions, batting .333 with nine runs batted in during the series.

==Early life==
Fernández was born in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic. He was scouted by the Toronto Blue Jays&#x27; Latin America scout Epy Guerrero and was signed as an undrafted free agent in 1979.

==Career==
Promoted to the Blue Jays in 1983, Fernández became the team&#x27;s full-time shortstop in 1985, and contributed significantly to the team winning its first division title that year. Fernández continued to star for the Jays for several years afterwards. His 213 hits in 1986 were, at the time, a major league single-season record for a shortstop.

Before the 1991 season, Fernández was traded to the San Diego Padres in a deal that also sent Jays star Fred McGriff to San Diego in exchange for Roberto Alomar and Joe Carter. Fernández played for San Diego for two years. After the 1992 season, the Padres traded him to the New York Mets for D. J. Dozier, Wally Whitehurst, and a player to be named later. After a disappointing start to the 1993 season, the Mets traded him back to the Blue Jays for Darrin Jackson. He played well for the remainder of the season and was instrumental in helping the Blue Jays win the 1993 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. In that World Series, Fernández drove in nine runs, a record for a shortstop.

Before the 1995 season, Fernández signed a two-year contract with the New York Yankees. It was because of an injury early in the season to Fernández that Derek Jeter was called up to the major leagues for the first time. Fernández injured his elbow during spring training in 1996, and missed the entire season. When Fernández left the Yankees, he would end up becoming the last Yankees player to wear #6, as it would be worn by manager Joe Torre in 1996 and end up being retired for him in 2014.

Fernández signed with the Cleveland Indians for the 1997 season. Thanks in large part to his own game-winning home run against Baltimore in the American League Championship Series—the only 1–0 game in MLB postseason history with an extra-innings home run—he played in the 1997 World Series with the Indians. In Game 7 of the World Series against the Florida Marlins, Fernández hit a two-run single in the top of the third inning for the Indians&#x27; only runs of the game, and was in position to be credited with the Series-winning hit for Cleveland, had they won the game. However, in the bottom of the 11th inning, Fernández committed an error on a potential double play ball while playing at second base, and the eventual World Series-winning run was put on base as a result.

In 1998, he rejoined the Blue Jays, and revitalized his hitting, batting over .300 in two seasons there. In 2000, Fernández played for the Seibu Lions in Japan before returning to the majors the following year. When he returned in 2001, he briefly played for the Milwaukee Brewers but returned to Toronto late in the season, and retired at its conclusion.

A very thin man, Fernández had a tilted, wavering batting stance that made it appear as if he might not be strong enough to hold his bat. From early in his career he carried a scar on his right cheek from a pitched ball. Fernández was a noted fitness fanatic.

Early in his career, Fernández was well known for his exceptional defensive skills at shortstop, and was described by Ivan Maisel in a Sports Illustrated article as having &quot;the range of a Texas cattleman&quot;. He was especially famous for leaping into the air while simultaneously making an underhanded throw to first base, on balls hit far to his right.

Fernández was awarded four consecutive Gold Glove Awards for his defense, from 1986 to 1989. Fernández was also named to five All-Star teams. He finished his career with a .288 batting average in 2,158 games played, and batted .327 in postseason play. Fernandez hit for the cycle as a New York Yankee on September 3, 1995, against the Oakland Athletics. He set a nine-year record for shortstops with a .992 fielding percentage in 1989, while still holding the single-season fielding percentage record for third basemen with .991 in 1994.

On October 17, 2016, Fernandez was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel, where he thanked the fans in Toronto, Ontario and in Canada for embracing him.

==Illness and death==
Fernández announced in 2017 he had been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease. On February 16, 2020, he died at a hospital in Weston, Florida following complications with a stroke, pneumonia, and an induced coma. His remains were returned home to San Pedro de Macorís and buried in the Municipal Cemetery.

<doc id="301636" wikidata="Q869575" url="?curid=301636" title="CrazySexyCool">
<text>CrazySexyCool is the second studio album by American girl group TLC, released on November 15, 1994, by LaFace and Arista Records. Following the group&#x27;s record deal, they released their debut album &quot;Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip&quot; in 1992 to positive reviews and commercial success. The group began working on a follow-up in 1993 but experienced an unproductive recording process due to personal issues, notably those of member Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes, who was struggling with alcoholism and her volatile relationship with football player Andre Rison. The album&#x27;s recording lasted until September 1994, with Lopes&#x27; role diminished while she was in rehab.

&quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; saw the group reunite with producers Dallas Austin, Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, and Jermaine Dupri, as well as new collaborators Organized Noize and Chucky Thompson. It also featured contributions from Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs, who helped with the notable hip hop soul sound; the album featured hip hop beats, funk, deep grooves, propulsive rhythms, and smooth production. The album&#x27;s lyrical content was seen as a departure from the group&#x27;s debut and was seen as a coming-of-age project which explored themes such as sexuality, romanticism, inexperience, and youthful optimism.

&quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, a chart on which it stayed for over two years. It has been certified 12-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making TLC the first girl group in history to be awarded diamond status. It has since sold over 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by an American girl group. It has also been featured on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and was listed as a &quot;New Classic&quot; by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2008. The album was ranked at number seven on &quot;Billboard&quot; list of the best diamond-certified albums of all time.

==Background==
===Debut album===
On February 28, 1991, Tionne Watkins and Lisa Lopes signed production, management, and publishing deals with Pebbitone, with Perri Reid becoming their general manager. The two-member TLC-Skee made its first recorded appearance on a track for LaFace act Damian Dame&#x27;s self-titled 1991 LP. Pebbles found the third member in Rozonda Thomas, one of Damian Dame&#x27;s part-time backup dancers.

Thomas was signed to the act in April 1991, at about which time the group&#x27;s name was shortened to TLC. To maintain TLC&#x27;s name as an acronym for the girls&#x27; names, Watkins became &quot;T-Boz&quot;, Lopes became &quot;Left-Eye&quot;, and Thomas became &quot;Chilli.&quot; The girls were then signed to LaFace in May through the production deal with Pebbitone; their records would be distributed by Arista Records/BMG. TLC was immediately set up to go into the studio with Reid and Edmonds, Dallas Austin, Jermaine Dupri, and Marley Marl producing their first album, &quot;Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip&quot;. The new trio debuted as backing vocalists on &quot;Rebel (With a Cause)&quot;, a track on Jermaine Jackson&#x27;s sole album for LaFace, &quot;You Said&quot; (1991).

Production on &quot;Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip&quot; wrapped up in December 1991. The album reached number 14 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number three on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. According to Nielsen SoundScan, it has sold 2.5 million copies in the US. It was eventually certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping four million copies in the US.

===Personal struggles===
Lopes was often vocal about her personal life and difficult past. She readily admitted that she had come from an abusive, alcoholic background and struggled with alcohol problems herself. These problems became headline news in 1994, when she set fire to Andre Rison&#x27;s tennis shoes in a bathtub, which ultimately spread to the mansion they shared, destroying it. Lopes claimed that Rison had beaten her after a night out, and she set fire to his shoes to get back at him. However, she said burning down the house was an accident. Lopes later revealed that she did not have a lot of freedom within the relationship and was abused mentally and physically, having released all her frustrations on the night of the fire.
Lopes, who was sentenced to five years probation and therapy at a halfway house, was never able to shake the incident from her reputation. Her relationship with Rison continued to make headlines, with rumors of an imminent wedding, later debunked by &quot;People&quot; magazine.

==Recording==
The album&#x27;s recording began in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. The album was recorded at numerous studios, including Doppler Studios, Bosstown Recording Studios, KrossWire Studio and GADaddy&#x27;s; D.A.R.P. Studios in Atlanta, Georgia; the Music Grinder Studios in Los Angeles, California; and The Hit Factory in New York City.

During the album&#x27;s recording, Lopes was forced to have less of an input, as she had pled guilty in an arson accident and was sent to a rehab facility as punishment. The rehab facility only released her for a couple of recording sessions, during which time she cut just a handful of album-worthy rap verses.

For the album&#x27;s production and writing, the group worked with producers including Babyface, Dallas Austin, Jermaine Dupri and more. Thomas stated that they had used these producers because they always worked with them stating that they worked with Dallas, Babyface, and Dupri on the first album &quot;the only thing we had new was Organized Noize.&quot; Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest did the interludes. However, during the album&#x27;s recording, the band members were not always in the studio together; sometimes they went in one by one due to scheduling conflicts.

&quot;Waterfalls&quot; was written by Lopes with Marqueze Etheridge and Organized Noize, who also produced the song. Watkins and Thomas perform the song with Lopes, who also provides a rap. The background vocals are performed by the members of TLC, as well as Debra Killings and Cee-Lo Green. Speaking of Green&#x27;s involvement, Watkins said, &quot;He was in Goodie Mob, we grew up together, we go way back. He did and it was amazing! I love his voice.&quot;
The lyrics of the song reference 1990s issues such as violence associated with illegal drug trade and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. At the end of the second verse, Watkins sings, &quot;His health is fading and he doesn&#x27;t know why / Three letters took him to his final resting place.&quot; She said that it was important for the group to &quot;get the message across without seeming like preaching.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; was noted as a departure from the group&#x27;s debut, and was seen as move away from the group&#x27;s predominantly rap connections. The songs on the album contained sensual R&amp;B sounds built over edgy hip-hop beats; containing propulsive rhythms along with clap-commanding high production, bouncy funk elements and smooth rhythms.

The album&#x27;s lyrical content was also seen as a departure from &quot;Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that compared to the lyrical content of their debut, which was seen as &quot;kiddie-cute hip-hop&quot;, &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; is filled with adult-female sexuality, and &quot;hide- and-seek coyness.&quot; It was seen as a coming-of-age sophomore album, according to Sheldon Pearce from Consequence of Sound, who stated the album had themes of &quot;guileless and horny twenty something&quot; lyrics that harmlessly explored sexuality and romanticism with the &quot;naïveté that comes from inexperience and youthful optimism.&quot; The album lyrics also touch upon themes of relationships from both the impassioned and erotic sides.

==Release and promotion==
To promote &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot;, TLC—along with Boyz II Men, Montell Jordan, and Mary J. Blige—performed in the annual Budweiser Superfest Tour in early 1995, consisting of 23 dates in North America. The Atlanta, Chicago and Indianapolis shows featured an expanded roster of performers, including Blackstreet and Monica.

All four singles from the album reached the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, two of them reaching number one.

Lead single, &quot;Creep&quot;, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for four weeks, and was one of the biggest singles of 1995, coming in at number three in &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Hot 100 Singles of 1995. It also reached number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

The second single, &quot;Red Light Special&quot;, peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number three on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

The third single, &quot;Waterfalls&quot;, became TLC&#x27;s most successful song, spending seven weeks at number one. It was also the second-biggest single of 1995 according to &quot;Billboard&quot;, earning TLC two songs in the top three of the 1995 &quot;Billboard&quot; year-end chart. Internationally, the song reached the top five in several countries.

&quot;Diggin&#x27; on You&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth and final single, and reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also reached number seven on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

==Critical reception==
&quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; was met with critical acclaim. In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as a &quot;smooth, seductive collection of contemporary soul reminiscent of both Philly soul and Prince&quot;, adding that the material was &quot;consistently strong&quot;. Erlewine continued to write that the album is &quot;powered&quot; by new jack swing and hip-hop beats with influences of mid-tempo funk, deep grooves, horns and guitar lines. He also referred to &quot;Waterfalls&quot; as &quot;one of the classic R&amp;B songs of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s review for &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, the article stated that TLC &quot;emerged with the most effervescent and soulful girl-group R&amp;B anyone had seen since the Supremes.&quot;

In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the album at number 43 on their &quot;100 Greatest Albums of the 90s&quot;. They stated: &quot;Left Eye, Chilli and T-Boz looked like a one-shot when they first emerged from the nascent Atlanta with 1992&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t 2 Proud 2 Beg&quot;. But &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; was a real shocker, packed bumper to bumper with great songs, sassy vocals and voluptuous beats for burning down the house. &#x27;Creep&#x27; celebrates the kicks of illicit lust on the down low, &#x27;Waterfalls&#x27; digs deep into Memphis soul and &#x27;If I Was Your Girlfriend&#x27; does Prince better than The Artist has all decade. The showstopper: &#x27;Red Light Special&#x27;, an impossibly steamy make-out ballad that undresses and caresses everyone with ears to hear it. &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; established TLC as pop pros who could do it all, combining the body slam of hip-hop and the giddy uplift of a jump-rope rhyme without breaking a nail.&quot;

In a 2015 article for &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, music critics Michael Madden and Sheldon Pearce write about how the album has impacted artists well into today&#x27;s era whose R&amp;B sound has been heavily influenced by strong hip-hop elements. &quot;There should probably be more talk of TLC&#x27;s role in forging the current R&amp;B landscape, which is heavily, if not entirely, influenced by hip-hop culture now. The two genres have seemingly been grafted onto one another, and there&#x27;s something of a codependent relationship between the two. To that effect, there&#x27;s something to be said for that dynamic existing here, too, how the album&#x27;s sequencing contributes to the music&#x27;s effectiveness and how it still translates to the modern day.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; debuted at number 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 77,500 copies in its first week. On the issue dated July 29, 1995, the album peaked at number three with 117,000 units sold. The album was certified 12-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 11, 2019, and as of July 2017, it had sold 7.7 million copies in the United States, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in the country; it had sold an additional 1.27 million copies through the BMG Music Club as of February 2003. Internationally, it reached number one in New Zealand, as well as the top five in Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. As of July 2006, &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; had sold over 23 million copies worldwide.

==Accolades==
&quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; was nominated for six Grammy Awards at the 1996 Grammy Awards. &quot;Waterfalls&quot; was nominated for the Record of the Year. Two of the album&#x27;s nominations were for its songwriters: Dallas Austin for &quot;Creep&quot;, and Babyface for &quot;Red Light Special&quot;. TLC ended up winning two awards, Best R&amp;B Album and Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for &quot;Creep&quot;.

TLC also received multiple wins and nominations at the Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards and Soul Train Music Awards, including Artist of the Year at the 1995 Billboard Music Awards. At the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards, TLC won four awards for the video to &quot;Waterfalls&quot;, including Video of the Year and the Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award.

<text>Barrier islands are a coastal landform, a type of dune system and sand island, where an area of sand has been formed by wave and tidal action parallel to the mainland coast. They usually occur in chains, consisting of anything from a few islands to more than a dozen. They are subject to change during storms and other action, but absorb energy and protect the coastlines and create areas of protected waters where wetlands may flourish. A barrier chain may extend for hundreds of kilometers, with islands periodically separated by tidal inlets. The largest barrier island in the world is Padre Island of Texas, United States, at long. Sometimes an important inlet may close permanently, transforming an island into a peninsula, thus creating a barrier peninsula, often including a beach, barrier beach.
Though many are long and narrow, the length and width of barriers and overall morphology of barrier coasts are related to parameters including tidal range, wave energy, sediment supply, sea-level trends, and basement controls. The amount of vegetation on the barrier has a large impact on the height and evolution of the island.

Chains of barrier islands can be found along approximately 13-15% of the world&#x27;s coastlines. They display different settings, suggesting that they can form and be maintained in a variety of environments. Numerous theories have been given to explain their formation.

A human-made offshore structure constructed parallel to the shore is called a breakwater. In terms of coastal morphodynamics, it acts similarly to a naturally occurring barrier island by dissipating and reducing the energy of the waves and currents striking the coast. Hence, it is an important aspect of coastal engineering.

==Constituent parts==
;Upper shoreface
The shoreface is the part of the barrier where the ocean meets the shore of the island. The barrier island body itself separates the shoreface from the backshore and lagoon/tidal flat area. Characteristics common to the upper shoreface are fine sands with mud and possibly silt. Further out into the ocean the sediment becomes finer. The effect of waves at this point is weak because of the depth. Bioturbation is common and many fossils can be found in upper shoreface deposits in the geologic record.

;Middle shoreface
The middle shoreface is located in the upper shoreface. The middle shoreface is strongly influenced by wave action because of its depth. Closer to shore the sand is medium-grained, with shell pieces common. Since wave action is heavier, bioturbation is not likely.

;Lower shoreface
The lower shoreface is constantly affected by wave action. This results in development of herringbone sedimentary structures because of the constant differing flow of waves. The sand is coarser.

;Foreshore
The foreshore is the area on land between high and low tide. Like the upper shoreface, it is constantly affected by wave action. Cross-bedding and lamination are present and coarser sands are present because of the high energy present by the crashing of the waves. The sand is also very well sorted.

;Backshore
The backshore is always above the highest water level point. The berm is also found here which marks the boundary between the foreshore and backshore. Wind is the important factor here, not water. During strong storms high waves and wind can deliver and erode sediment from the backshore.

;Dunes
Coastal dunes, created by wind, are typical of a barrier island. They are located at the top of the backshore. The dunes will display characteristics of typical aeolian wind-blown dunes. The difference is that dunes on a barrier island typically contain coastal vegetation roots and marine bioturbation.

;Lagoon and tidal flats
The lagoon and tidal flat area is located behind the dune and backshore area. Here the water is still, which allows fine silts, sands, and mud to settle out. Lagoons can become host to an anaerobic environment. This will allow high amounts of organic-rich mud to form. Vegetation is also common.

== Location ==

Barrier Islands can be observed on every continent on Earth, except Antarctica. They occur primarily in areas that are tectonically stable, such as &quot;trailing edge coasts&quot; facing (moving away from) ocean ridges formed by divergent boundaries of tectonic plates, and around smaller marine basins such as the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Areas with relatively small tides and ample sand supply favor barrier island formation.

=== Australia ===

Moreton Bay, on the east coast of Australia and directly east of Brisbane, is sheltered from the Pacific Ocean by a chain of very large barrier islands. Running north to south they are Bribie Island, Moreton Island, North Stradbroke Island and South Stradbroke Island (the last two used to be a single island until a storm created a channel between them in 1896). North Stradbroke Island is the second largest sand island in the world and Moreton Island is the third largest.

Fraser Island, another barrier island lying 200 km north of Moreton Bay on the same coastline, is the largest sand island in the world.

=== United States ===
Barrier islands are found most prominently on the United States&#x27; East and Gulf Coasts, where every state, from Maine to Florida (East Coast) and from Florida to Texas (Gulf coast), features at least part of a barrier island. Many have large numbers of barrier islands; Florida, for instance, had 29 (in 1997) in just along the west (Gulf) coast of the Florida peninsula, plus about 20 others on the east coast and several barrier islands and spits along the panhandle coast. Padre Island, in Texas, is the world&#x27;s longest barrier island; other well-known islands on the Gulf Coast include Galveston Island in Texas and Sanibel and Captiva Islands in Florida. Those on the East Coast include Miami Beach and Palm Beach in Florida; Hatteras Island in North Carolina; Assateague Island in Virginia and Maryland; Absecon Island in New Jersey, where Atlantic City is located; and Jones Beach Island and Fire Island, both off Long Island in New York. No barrier islands are found on the Pacific Coast of the United States due to the rocky shore and short continental shelf, but barrier peninsulas can be found. Barrier islands can also be seen on Alaska&#x27;s Arctic coast.

=== Canada ===

Barrier Islands can also be found in Maritime Canada, and other places along the coast. A good example is found at Miramichi Bay, New Brunswick, where Portage Island as well as Fox Island and Hay Island protect the inner bay from storms in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

=== Mexico ===

Mexico&#x27;s Gulf of Mexico coast has numerous barrier islands and barrier peninsulas.

===New Zealand===
Barrier islands are more prevalent in the north of both of New Zealand&#x27;s main islands. Notable barrier islands in New Zealand include Matakana Island, which guards the entrance to Tauranga Harbour, and Rabbit Island, at the southern end of Tasman Bay. See also Nelson Harbour&#x27;s Boulder Bank, below.

===India===
The Vypin Island in the Southwest coast of India in Kerala is 27 km long. It is also one of the most densely populated islands in the world.

=== Indonesia ===
The Indonesian Barrier Islands lie off the western coast of Sumatra. From north to south along this coast they include Simeulue, the Banyak Islands (chiefly Tuangku and Bangkaru), Nias, the Batu Islands (notably Pini, Tanahmasa and Tanahbala), the Mentawai Islands (mainly Siberut, Sipura, North Pagai and South Pagai Islands) and Enggano Island. 

=== Europe ===

Barrier islands can be observed in the Baltic Sea from Poland to Lithuania as well as distinctly in the Wadden Islands, which stretch from the Netherlands to Denmark. Lido di Venezia and Pellestrina are notable barrier islands of the Lagoon of Venice which have for centuries protected the city of Venice in Italy. Chesil Beach on the south coast of England developed as a barrier beach. Barrier beaches are also found in the north of the Azov and Black seas.

==Processes==

===Migration and overwash===
Water levels may be higher than the island during storm events. This situation can lead to overwash, which brings sand from the front of the island to the top and/or landward side of the island. This process leads to the evolution and migration of the barrier island.

===Critical width concept===
Barrier islands are often formed to have a certain width. The term &quot;critical width concept&quot; has been discussed with reference to barrier islands, overwash, and washover deposits since the 1970s. The concept basically states that overwash processes were effective in migration of the barrier only where the barrier width is less than a critical value. The island did not narrow below these values because overwash was effective at transporting sediment over the barrier island, thereby keeping pace with the rate of ocean shoreline recession. Sections of the island with greater widths experienced washover deposits that did not reach the bayshore, and the island narrowed by ocean shoreline recession until it reached the critical width. The only process that widened the barrier beyond the critical width was breaching, formation of a partially subaerial flood shoal, and subsequent inlet closure.

Critical barrier width can be defined as the smallest cross-shore dimension that minimizes net loss of sediment from the barrier island over the defined project lifetime. The magnitude of critical width is related to sources and sinks of sand in the system, such as the volume stored in the dunes and the net long-shore and cross-shore sand transport, as well as the island elevation. The concept of critical width is important for large-scale barrier island restoration, in which islands are reconstructed to optimum height, width, and length for providing protection for estuaries, bays, marshes and mainland beaches.

==Formation theories==

Scientists have proposed numerous explanations for the formation of barrier islands for more than 150 years. There are three major theories: offshore bar, spit accretion, and submergence. No single theory can explain the development of all barriers, which are distributed extensively along the world&#x27;s coastlines. Scientists accept the idea that barrier islands, including other barrier types, can form by a number of different mechanisms.

There appears to be some general requirements for formation. Barrier island systems develop most easily on wave-dominated coasts with a small to moderate tidal range. Coasts are classified into three groups based on tidal range: microtidal, 0–2 meter tidal range; mesotidal, 2–4 meter tidal range; and macrotidal, &gt;4 meter tidal range. Barrier islands tend to form primarily along microtidal coasts, where they tend to be well developed and nearly continuous. They are less frequently formed in mesotidal coasts, where they are typically short with tidal inlets common. Barrier islands are very rare along macrotidal coasts. Along with a small tidal range and a wave-dominated coast, there must be a relatively low gradient shelf. Otherwise, sand accumulation into a sandbar would not occur and instead would be dispersed throughout the shore. An ample sediment supply is also a requirement for barrier island formation. This often includes fluvial deposits and glacial deposits. The last major requirement for barrier island formation is a stable sea level. It is especially important for sea level to remain relatively unchanged during barrier island formation and growth. If sea level changes are too drastic, time will be insufficient for wave action to accumulate sand into a dune, which will eventually become a barrier island through aggradation. The formation of barrier islands requires a constant sea level so that waves can concentrate the sand into one location.

===Offshore bar theory===
In 1845 the Frenchman Elie de Beaumont published an account of barrier formation. He believed that waves moving into shallow water churned up sand, which was deposited in the form of a submarine bar when the waves broke and lost much of their energy. As the bars developed vertically, they gradually rose above sea level, forming barrier islands.

Several barrier islands have been observed forming by this process along the Gulf coast of the Florida peninsula, including: the North and South Anclote Bars associated with Anclote Key, Three Rooker Island, Shell Key, and South Bunces Key.

===Spit accretion theory===
American geologist Grove Karl Gilbert first argued in 1885 that the barrier sediments came from longshore sources. He proposed that sediment moving in the breaker zone through agitation by waves in longshore drift would construct spits extending from headlands parallel to the coast. The subsequent breaching of spits by storm waves would form barrier islands.

===Submergence theory===
William John McGee reasoned in 1890 that the East and Gulf coasts of the United States were undergoing submergence, as evidenced by the many drowned river valleys that occur along these coasts, including Raritan, Delaware and Chesapeake bays. He believed that during submergence, coastal ridges were separated from the mainland, and lagoons formed behind the ridges. He used the Mississippi–Alabama barrier islands (consists of Cat, Ship, Horn, Petit Bois and Dauphin Islands) as an example where coastal submergence formed barrier islands. His interpretation was later shown to be incorrect when the ages of the coastal stratigraphy and sediment were more accurately determined.

Along the coast of Louisiana, former lobes of the Mississippi River delta have been reworked by wave action, forming beach ridge complexes. Prolonged sinking of the marshes behind the barriers has converted these former vegetated wetlands to open-water areas. In a period of 125 years, from 1853 to 1978, two small semi-protected bays behind the barrier developed as the large water body of Lake Pelto, leading to Isles Dernieres&#x27;s detachment from the mainland.

===Boulder Bank===
An unusual natural structure in New Zealand may give clues to the formation processes of barrier islands. The Boulder Bank, at the entrance to Nelson Haven at the northern end of the South Island, is a unique 13 km-long stretch of rocky substrate a few metres in width. It is not strictly a barrier island, as it is linked to the mainland at one end. The Boulder Bank is composed of granodiorite from Mackay Bluff, which lies close to the point where the bank joins the mainland. It is still debated what process or processes have resulted in this odd structure, though longshore drift is the most accepted hypothesis. Studies have been conducted since 1892 to determine the speed of boulder movement. Rates of the top-course gravel movement have been estimated at 7.5 metres a year.

==Types==
Richard Davis distinguishes two types of barrier islands, wave-dominated and mixed-energy. 

===Wave-dominated===
Wave-dominated barrier islands are long, low, and narrow, and usually are bounded by unstable inlets at either end. The presence of longshore currents caused by waves approaching the island at an angle will carry sediment long, extending the island. Longshore currents, and the resultant extension, are usually in one direction, but in some circumstances the currents and extensions can occur towards both ends of the island (as occurs on Anclote Key, Three Rooker Bar, and Sand Key, on the Gulf Coast of Florida). Washover fans on the lagoon side of barriers, where storm surges have over-topped the island, are common, especially on younger barrier islands. Wave-dominated barriers are also susceptible to being breached by storms, creating new inlets. Such inlets may close as sediment is carried in them by longshore currents, but may become permanent if the tidal prism (volumn and force of tidal flow) is large enough. Older barrier islands that have accumulated dunes are less subject to washovers and opening of inlets. Wave-dominated islands require an abundant supply of sediment to grow and develop dunes. If a barrier island does not receive enough sediment to grow, repeated washovers from storms will migrate the island towards the mainland.

===Mixed-energy===

Wave-dominated barrier islands may eventually develop into mixed-energy barrier islands. Mixed-energy barrier islands are molded by both wave energy and tidal flux. The flow of a tidal prism moves sand. Sand accumulates at both the inshore and off shore sides of an inlet, forming a flood delta or shoal on the bay or lagoon side of the inlet (from sand carried in on a flood tide), and an ebb delta or shoal on the open water side (from sand carried out by an ebb tide). Large tidal prisms tend to produce large ebb shoals, which may rise enough to be exposed at low tide. Ebb shoals refract waves approaching the inlet, locally reversing the longshore current moving sand along the coast. This can modify the ebb shoal into swash bars, which migrate into the end of the island up current from the inlet, adding to the barrier&#x27;s width near the inlet (creating a &quot;drumstick&quot; barrier island). This process captures sand that is carried by the longshore current, preventing it from reaching the downcurrent side of the inlet, starving that island.

Many of the Sea Islands in the U.S. state of Georgia are relatively wide compared to their shore-parallel length. Siesta Key, Florida has a characteristic drumstick shape, with a wide portion at the northern end near the mouth of Phillipi Creek.

== Ecological importance ==
Barrier islands are critically important in mitigating ocean swells and other storm events for the water systems on the mainland side of the barrier island, as well as protecting the coastline. This effectively creates a unique environment of relatively low energy, brackish water. Multiple wetland systems such as lagoons, estuaries, and/or marshes can result from such conditions depending on the surroundings. They are typically rich habitats for a variety of flora and fauna. Without barrier islands, these wetlands could not exist; they would be destroyed by daily ocean waves and tides as well as ocean storm events. One of the most prominent examples is the Louisiana barrier islands.

<text>Joseph Chris Carter (born March 7, 1960) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as an outfielder and first baseman for the Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Indians, San Diego Padres, Toronto Blue Jays, Baltimore Orioles, and San Francisco Giants. Carter hit a walk-off home run to win the 1993 World Series for the Blue Jays, their second consecutive championship. Carter is one of only two players to end a World Series with a home run, the other being Bill Mazeroski.

==College career==
Joe Carter attended Wichita State University, leaving after his junior year. He was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; magazine&#x27;s College Player of the Year in 1981.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
In the 1981 MLB draft, the Chicago Cubs chose him with the second overall pick. He began to blossom in the minor leagues in 1982, batting .319 with 25 home runs and 98 RBIs in 110 games for the Midland Cubs of the AA Texas League. He was promoted to the AAA Iowa Cubs in 1983, where he batted .307 with 22 home runs and 83 RBIs in 124 games.

===Chicago Cubs (1983)===
Carter reached the Majors in with the Cubs. He hit .176 in 23 games, and began the 1984 season back in Iowa.

===Cleveland Indians (1984–1989)===
On June 13, 1984, Carter was traded with three other players to the Cleveland Indians for Rick Sutcliffe, George Frazier, and Ron Hassey. Carter enjoyed a breakout season with the Indians in 1986, when he led the major leagues with 121 runs batted in and recorded career highs of 200 base hits, 341 total bases, and 108 runs scored. In Cleveland, Carter established himself as a prolific power hitter, hitting as many as 35 home runs in a season and regularly driving in 100 or more runs. He usually hit nearly as many doubles as he did homers, and would get respectable numbers of triples in many years too. He was also a very good baserunner, stealing 20-30 bases a year with a high rate of success; in 1987, Carter became a member of the single-season 30–30 club for home runs/stolen bases.

===San Diego Padres (1990)===
After a strong season, Carter was traded by Cleveland to the San Diego Padres for prospects Sandy Alomar Jr., Carlos Baerga, and Chris James. Although he continued to drive in runs, he also continued to have defensive problems. The Padres subsequently dealt him to the Toronto Blue Jays along with Roberto Alomar in exchange for star players Fred McGriff and Tony Fernández.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1991–1997)===
Carter&#x27;s overall game improved dramatically in , as he helped the Toronto Blue Jays win the division title and hit the game-winning single that clinched the AL East championship; he also emerged for the first time as a team leader. In , he helped the Jays win their first World Series championship, the first ever won by a Canadian-based team. Carter hit two home runs and recorded the final out of the Series, taking a throw to first base from reliever Mike Timlin to nab Otis Nixon of the Atlanta Braves, who bunted. This was the first time a World Series ended on a bunt.

Carter and Edwin Encarnación are the only two Blue Jays to hit two home runs in one inning, with Carter&#x27;s coming against the Baltimore Orioles in 1993 and Encarnacion&#x27;s against the Houston Astros in 2013.

====1993 World Series====
In , the Blue Jays reached the World Series again, facing the Philadelphia Phillies. In Game 6, with the Blue Jays leading three games to two, Carter came to bat with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning with the Blue Jays trailing 6–5 and Rickey Henderson and Paul Molitor on base. On a 2–2 count, Carter hit a three-run walk-off home run off Phillies pitcher Mitch Williams (against whom he had previously been 0–4 in his career) to win the World Series, only the second time a Series has ended with a home run (the other being in 1960, when Bill Mazeroski did it for the Pittsburgh Pirates against the New York Yankees), and the only time the home run has been hit by a player whose team was trailing in the bottom of the ninth inning in a potential championship clinching game. Upon hitting the home run, Carter jumped up and down many times, most notably while rounding first base, where his helmet came off. Tom Cheek, the Blue Jays&#x27; radio broadcaster, called the play: &quot;Touch &#x27;em all, Joe, you&#x27;ll never hit a bigger home run in your life!&quot;

====1994–1997====
Carter continued to play for the Blue Jays until 1997, and led the Blue Jays in home runs and RBIs in 1994 and 1995.

When he represented the Blue Jays at the 1996 All-Star Game, he received boos for his home run that won the Blue Jays the 1993 World Series, as the game took place at Veterans Stadium, then the home of the Philadelphia Phillies. During the 1997 season, he snuck an unlicensed maple wood baseball bat manufactured by Sam Bat into a game.

===Baltimore Orioles and San Francisco Giants (1998)===

He became a free agent in and briefly played for the Baltimore Orioles and San Francisco Giants before retiring. Carter ended his career by popping out to end the game in a one-game playoff against the Chicago Cubs.

===Career statistics===
Carter was named to five All-Star teams. In his career he hit 396 home runs and drove in 1445 runs. He drove in 100 runs in a season ten times, including the year, which was cut short due to the strike that occurred 115 games into the year. He was the first player to record 100 RBI for three different teams in three consecutive seasons. In 1993, while a Toronto Blue Jay, Carter set an American League record when he hit 3 home runs in a game for the fifth time in his career. (The record was tied 10 years later by Blue Jay Carlos Delgado.)

Carter was also involved in the final plays of four games in which the Blue Jays clinched a championship: 1) The game-winning single to drive home Roberto Alomar and clinch the 1991 American League East division championship, 2) catching the final out at first base in the 1992 World Series, 3) catching the final out on a fly ball to right field in the 1993 American League Championship Series, and 4) the walk-off home run in Game 6 of the 1993 World Series.

==Post-retirement==

From to , Carter served as a color commentator for the Toronto Blue Jays on CTV Sportsnet, leaving to work for the Chicago Cubs. From to , Carter served as the color commentator, alongside play-by-play man Chip Caray, for the Chicago Cubs on WGN-TV. Carter was replaced by the man whom Carter himself replaced, Steve Stone.

Carter became eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2004, however, he received 19 votes, representing 3.8% of the vote and was dropped from future ballots. Carter is currently eligible for induction via the Today&#x27;s Game era committee.

Carter was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003.

In September 2006, Carter was awarded the Major League Baseball Hometown Heroes Award, as the former or current player who best represents the legacy of his franchise&#x27;s history, as voted by fans.

In 2008, Carter appeared on an episode of &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot;.

On August 7, 2009, Carter, along with many of his 1992 and 1993 Toronto Blue Jay World Series alumni teammates, attended a reunion/pre-game ceremony at the SkyDome. The event was organized by Carter himself and included three dozen players, coaches and athletic trainers from the Blue Jays&#x27; 1992 and 1993 World Series rosters.

On May 19, 2012, the Cleveland Indians honored Carter with a bobblehead giveaway bearing his likeness during their game against the Miami Marlins. Carter attended and signed autographs, as well as throwing out the ceremonial first pitch.

On July 14, 2015, in a pregame ceremony before the 2015 All-Star Game, it was announced that Carter was elected by fans as a Franchise Four member of the Toronto Blue Jays, as one of the four most valuable players in franchise history.

==Charity involvement==
Carter co-chairs the annual &quot;Joe Carter Classic&quot;, a celebrity golf tournament in the Toronto area founded in 2010 to benefit the Children&#x27;s Aid Foundation. The tournament has raised over $2.5 million for the foundation. Previous events have featured celebrities including Charles Barkley, Ray Bourque, and Gordie Howe.

==In popular culture==
*In the 1999 Canadian hip hop single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride&quot; by Choclair, one of the verses cites Carter&#x27;s walk-off home run in the 1993 World Series, &quot;It was the 9th inning, with two outs, I hit the home run to left field like Carter did to Philly&quot;. In actuality, there was only one out when Carter hit his home run.
*In the 1999 film &quot;Big Daddy&quot;, a plot twist at the end of the film revealed by Jon Stewart&#x27;s character, Kevin Gerrity, is that he fathered a child conceived in Toronto as a by-product of celebrating Carter&#x27;s walk-off home run to win the 1993 World Series, and later meeting a woman that same night while inebriated.
*In July 2015, Carter&#x27;s walk-off home run celebration was used as the track artwork for the song &quot;Back to Back&quot; released by Toronto native Drake.

<doc id="301649" wikidata="Q262428" url="?curid=301649" title="Tadukhipa">
<text>Tadukhipa (in the Hurrian language Tadu-Hepa), was a princess of the Mitanni kingdom. She was the daughter of King Tushratta of Mitanni and his queen Juni, and the niece of Artashumara. Tadukhipa&#x27;s aunt Gilukhipa (sister of Tushratta) had married Pharaoh Amenhotep III in his 10th regnal year. Tadukhipa was to marry Amenhotep III more than two decades later.

==Early life==
Tadukhipa was the daughter of King Tushratta of Mitanni, who is believed to have reigned c. 1382 BC–1342 BC. She is believed to have been born around Year 21 of the reign of Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III (c. 1366 BC). Almost nothing is known of her early years. In approximately Year 36 of Amenhotep&#x27;s reign (c. 1352), Tushratta sent her to Egypt to marry the pharaoh, who was a close ally.

Relatively little is known about this princess of Mitanni. She is believed to have been born around Year 21 of the reign of Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III, (c. 1366 BC). Fifteen years later, Tushratta married his daughter to his ally Amenhotep III to cement their two states alliances in Year 36 of Amenhotep III&#x27;s reign (1352 BC). Tadukhipa is referenced in seven of Tushratta&#x27;s thirteen Amarna letters, of about 1350-1340 BC. Tushratta requested that his daughter would become a queen consort, even though that position was held by Queen Tiye. Amenhotep III never sent the golden statues he offered in return, and, after his death, Tushratta sent some missives complaining about the lack of reciprocity.

==Life in Egypt==
King Tushratta sent his daughter to Egypt with many gifts for Pharaoh Amenhotep. These gifts included: a gold-plated chariot inlaid with precious stones, a pair of horses, a litter adorned with gold and precious stones, clothes and garments, a horse saddle adorned with gold eagles, jewelry such as bracelets, armlets, and other ornaments, and a large chest to hold those items. Amenhotep had offered to send golden statutes to Tushratta as part of the marriage agreement. However, no evidence exists that the gifts were sent to Mitanni.

Tushratta had requested that his daughter become Great Royal Wife to Amenhotep. However, the position was already held by Queen Tiye. Amenhotep III died soon after Tadukhipa&#x27;s arrival in Egypt and his son, Amenhotep IV, became pharaoh. Tadukhipa&#x27;s existence in Egypt is attested to through Amarna letters that mention her, including missives Tushratta sent asking after the golden statutes he was promised by Amenhotep III. It is speculated that Tadukhipa eventually remarried Amenhotep IV, however it has not been definitively proven.

==Identification with Kiya or Nefertiti==
Some scholars tentatively identify Tadukhipa with Kiya, a known wife of Akhenaten. It has been suggested that the story of Kiya may be the source for the New Kingdom story called the &quot;Tale of Two Brothers.&quot; This fable tells the story of how the pharaoh fell in love with a beautiful foreign woman after smelling her hair. If Tadukhipa was later known as Kiya, then she would have lived at Amarna where she had her own sunshade and was depicted with the pharaoh and at least one daughter.

Others such as Petrie, Drioton and Vandier have suggested that Tadukhipa was given a new name after becoming the consort of Akhenaten and is to be identified the famous queen Nefertiti. This theory suggests that Nefertiti&#x27;s name &quot;the beautiful one has come&quot; refers to foreign origin, such as Tadukhipa&#x27;s Mitanni origin. Seele, Meyer and others have pointed out that Tey, wife of Ay, held the title of nurse to Nefertiti, and that this argues against this identification. A mature princess arriving in Egypt would not need a nurse.

<text>The Southern Review is a quarterly literary magazine that was established by Robert Penn Warren in 1935 at the behest of Charles W. Pipkin and funded by Huey Long as a part of his investment in Louisiana State University. It publishes fiction, poetry, critical essays, and excerpts from novels in progress by established and emerging writers and includes reproductions of visual art. &quot;The Southern Review&quot; continues to follow Warren&#x27;s articulation of the mission when he said that it gives &quot;writers decent company between the covers, and [concentrates] editorial authority sufficiently for the journal to have its own distinctive character and quality&quot;.

==History==
An earlier &quot;Southern Review&quot; was published in Charleston, South Carolina from 1828 to 1832, and another in Baltimore from 1867 to 1879.

The initial staff consisted of editor-in-chief Charles W. Pipkin, Robert Penn Warren and Cleanth Brooks as managing editors, and Albert Erskine as business manager. In 1942, after 28 issues, publishing was interrupted and restarted again in 1965. Past editors-in-chief and co-editors have been Albert R. Erskine Jr., Lewis P. Simpson, Donald E. Stanford, James Olney, Fred Hobson, Dave Smith, Bret Lott, Jeanne M. Leiby, Cara Blue Adams, and Emily Nemens. The co-editors as of August 2018 are Sacha Idell and Jessica Faust.

=== Reception ===
In 1936, shortly after the journal&#x27;s founding, poetry editor Morton D. Zabel credited &quot;The Southern Review&quot; with &quot;a competence almost unrivaled at the moment in American letters.&quot; In 1941, on the occasion of the journal&#x27;s 5th anniversary, John Crowe Ransom stated &quot;&quot;The Southern Review&quot;″s five year achievement is close to the best thing in the history of American letters.&quot;

<doc id="301658" wikidata="Q1753199" url="?curid=301658" title="Trolley problem">
<text>The trolley problem is a series of thought experiments in ethics, psychology, and artificial intelligence involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number. The series usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway trolley or train is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life-and-death dilemmas (medical, judicial, etc.) are posed, each containing the option to either do nothing, in which case several people will be killed, or intervene and sacrifice one initially &quot;safe&quot; person to save the others.

Opinions on the ethics of each scenario turn out to be sensitive to details of the story that may seem immaterial to the abstract dilemma. The question of formulating a general principle that can account for the differing judgments arising in different variants of the story was raised in 1967 as part of an analysis of debates on abortion and the doctrine of double effect by the English philosopher Philippa Foot. Later dubbed &quot;the trolley problem&quot; by Judith Jarvis Thomson in a 1976 article that catalyzed a large literature, the subject refers to the meta-problem of why different judgments are arrived at in particular instances.

Philosophers Judith Thomson, Frances Kamm, and Peter Unger have also analysed the dilemma extensively. Thomson&#x27;s 1976 article initiated the literature on the trolley problem as a subject in its own right. Characteristic of this literature are colorful and increasingly absurd alternative scenarios in which the sacrificed person is instead pushed onto the tracks as a way to stop the trolley, has his organs harvested to save transplant patients, or is killed in more indirect ways that complicate the chain of causation and responsibility.

Earlier forms of individual trolley scenarios antedated Foot&#x27;s publication. Frank Chapman Sharp included a version in a moral questionnaire given to undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin in 1905. In this variation, the railway&#x27;s switchman controlled the switch, and the lone individual to be sacrificed (or not) was the switchman&#x27;s child. German philosopher of law Karl Engisch discussed a similar dilemma in his habilitation thesis in 1930, as did German legal scholar Hans Welzel in a work from 1951. In his commentary on the Talmud, published long before his death in 1953, Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz considered the question of whether it is ethical to deflect a projectile from a larger crowd toward a smaller one. Similarly, in &quot;The Strike&quot;, a television play broadcast in the United States on June 7, 1954, a commander in the Korean War must choose between ordering an air strike on an encroaching enemy force at the cost of his own 20-man patrol unit, or calling off the strike and risking the lives of the main army made up of 500 men.

Beginning in 2001, the trolley problem and its variants have been used in empirical research on moral psychology. It has been a topic of popular books. Trolley-style scenarios also arise in discussing the ethics of autonomous vehicle design, which may require programming to choose whom or what to strike when a collision appears to be unavoidable. More recently, the trolley problem has also become an internet meme.

== Original dilemma ==
Foot&#x27;s version of the thought experiment, now known as &quot;Trolley Driver&quot;, ran as follows:

A utilitarian view asserts that it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at all). This fact makes diverting the trolley obligatory. An alternative viewpoint is that since moral wrongs are already in place in the situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the incommensurability of human lives. Under some interpretations of moral obligation, simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then doing nothing would be considered an immoral act.

== Empirical research ==

In 2001, Joshua Greene and colleagues published the results of the first significant empirical investigation of people&#x27;s responses to trolley problems. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, they demonstrated that &quot;personal&quot; dilemmas (like pushing a man off a footbridge) preferentially engage brain regions associated with emotion, whereas &quot;impersonal&quot; dilemmas (like diverting the trolley by flipping a switch) preferentially engaged regions associated with controlled reasoning. On these grounds, they advocate for the dual-process account of moral decision-making. Since then, numerous other studies have employed trolley problems to study moral judgment, investigating topics like the role and influence of stress, emotional state, impression management, levels of anonymity, different types of brain damage, physiological arousal, different neurotransmitters, and genetic factors on responses to trolley dilemmas.

Trolley problems have been used as a measure of utilitarianism, but their usefulness for such purposes has been widely criticized.

In 2017, a group led by Michael Stevens performed the first realistic trolley-problem experiment, where subjects were placed alone in what they thought was a train-switching station, and shown footage that they thought was real (but was actually prerecorded) of a train going down a track, with five workers on the main track, and one on the secondary track; the participants had the option to pull the lever to divert the train toward the secondary track. Five of the seven participants did not pull the lever.

=== Survey data ===
The trolley problem has been the subject of many surveys in which about 90% of respondents have chosen to kill the one and save the five. If the situation is modified where the one sacrificed for the five was a relative or romantic partner, respondents are much less likely to be willing to sacrifice the one life.

A 2009 survey by David Bourget and David Chalmers shows that 68% of professional philosophers would switch (sacrifice the one individual to save five lives) in the case of the trolley problem, 8% would not switch, and the remaining 24% had another view or could not answer.

=== Criticism ===
In a 2014 paper published in the &quot;Social and Personality Psychology Compass&quot;, researchers criticized the use of the trolley problem, arguing, among other things, that the scenario it presents is too extreme and unconnected to real-life moral situations to be useful or educational.

In her 2017 paper, Nassim JafariNaimi lays out the reductive nature of the trolley problem in framing ethical problems that serves to uphold an impoverished version of utilitarianism. She argues that the popular argument that the trolley problem can serve as a template for algorithmic morality is based on fundamentally flawed premises that serve the most powerful with potentially dire consequences on the future of cities.

In 2017, in his book &quot;On Human Nature&quot;, Roger Scruton criticises the usage of ethical dilemmas such as the trolley problem and their usage by philosophers such as Derek Parfit and Peter Singer as ways of illustrating their ethical views. Scruton writes, &quot;These &#x27;dilemmas&#x27; have the useful character of eliminating from the situation just about every morally relevant relationship and reducing the problem to one of arithmetic alone.&quot; Scruton believes that just because one would choose to change the track so that the train hits the one person instead of the five does not mean that they are necessarily a consequentialist. As a way of showing the flaws in consequentialist responses to ethical problems, Scruton points out paradoxical elements of belief in utilitarianism and similar beliefs. He believes that Nozick&#x27;s experience machine thought experiment definitively disproves hedonism. In his 2017 article &quot;The Trolley Problem and the Dropping of Atomic Bombs,&quot; Masahiro Morioka considers the dropping of atomic bombs as an example of the trolley problem and points out that there are five &quot;problems of the trolley problem&quot;, namely, 1) rarity, 2) inevitability, 3) safety zone, 4) possibility of becoming a victim, and 5) the lack of perspective of the dead victims who were deprived of freedom of choice.

In a 2018 article published in &quot;Psychological Review&quot;, researchers pointed out that, as measures of utilitarian decisions, sacrificial dilemmas such as the trolley problem measure only one facet of proto-utilitarian tendencies, namely permissive attitudes toward instrumental harm, while ignoring impartial concern for the greater good. As such, the authors argued that the trolley problem provides only a partial measure of utilitarianism.

== Related problems ==
The basic Switch form of the trolley problem also supports comparison to other, related dilemmas:

=== The Fat Man ===
Resistance to this course of action seems strong; when asked, a majority of people will approve of pulling the switch to save a net of four lives, but will disapprove of pushing the fat man to save a net of four lives. This has led to attempts to find a relevant moral distinction between the two cases.

One possible distinction could be that in the first case, one does not intend harm towards anyone – harming the one is just a side effect of switching the trolley away from the five. However, in the second case, harming the one is an integral part of the plan to save the five. This solution is essentially an application of the doctrine of double effect, which says that one may take action that has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong. So, the action is permissible even if the harm to the innocent person is foreseen, so long as it is not intended. This is an argument which Shelly Kagan considers (and ultimately rejects) in his first book &quot;The Limits of Morality&quot;.

=== The Fat Villain ===
This variation is similar to &quot;The Fat Man&quot;, with the additional assertion that the fat man who may be pushed is a villain who is responsible for the whole situation: the fat man was the one who tied five people to the track, and sent a trolley in their direction with the intention of killing them. In this variation, a majority of people are willing to push the fat man.

Unlike in the previous scenario, pushing the fat villain to stop the trolley may be seen as a form of retributive justice or self-defense.

== Implications for autonomous vehicles ==
Variants of the original Trolley Driver dilemma arise in the design of software to control autonomous cars. Situations are anticipated where a potentially fatal collision appears to be unavoidable, but in which choices made by the car&#x27;s software, such as into whom or what to crash, can affect the particulars of the deadly outcome. For example, should the software value the safety of the car&#x27;s occupants more, or less, than that of potential victims outside the car.

A platform called Moral Machine was created by MIT Media Lab to allow the public to express their opinions on what decisions autonomous vehicles should make in scenarios that use the trolley problem paradigm. Analysis of the data collected through Moral Machine showed broad differences in relative preferences among different countries. Other approaches make use of virtual reality to assess human behavior in experimental settings. However, some argue that the investigation of trolley-type cases is not necessary to address the ethical problem of driverless cars, because the trolley cases have a serious practical limitation. It would need to be a top-down plan in order to fit the current approaches of addressing emergencies in artificial intelligence.

Also, a question remains of whether the law should dictate the ethical standards that all autonomous vehicles must use, or whether individual autonomous car owners or drivers should determine their car&#x27;s ethical values, such as favoring safety of the owner or the owner&#x27;s family over the safety of others. Although most people would not be willing to use an automated car that might sacrifice themselves in a life-or-death dilemma, some believe the somewhat counterintuitive claim that using mandatory ethics values would nevertheless be in their best interest. According to Gogoll and Müller, &quot;the reason is, simply put, that [personalized ethics settings] would most likely result in a prisoner’s dilemma.&quot;

In 2016, the German government appointed a commission to study the ethical implications of autonomous driving. The commission adopted 20 rules to be implemented in the laws that will govern the ethical choices that autonomous vehicles will make. Relevant to the trolley dilemma is this rule:

8. Genuine dilemmatic decisions, such as a decision between one human life and another, depend on the actual specific situation, incorporating “unpredictable” behaviour by parties affected. They can thus not be clearly standardized, nor can they be programmed such that they are ethically unquestionable. Technological systems must be designed to avoid accidents. However, they cannot be standardized to a complex or intuitive assessment of the impacts of an accident in such a way that they can replace or anticipate the decision of a responsible driver with the moral capacity to make correct judgements. It is true that a human driver would be acting unlawfully if he killed a person in an emergency to save the lives of one or more other persons, but he would not necessarily be acting culpably. Such legal judgements, made in retrospect and taking special circumstances into account, cannot readily be transformed into abstract/general ex ante appraisals and thus also not into corresponding programming activities. …

<doc id="301660" wikidata="Q7456892" url="?curid=301660" title="Setting pole">
<text>A setting pole or quant (quant pole) is a pole, handled by a crew member, to move boats, barges (in which case it is also called a barge pole) or punts by pushing the craft in the desired direction. The pole is used to push against the river or sea bed or, in some cases, the bank of the river. If used from the stern of the craft, the action is usually called &quot;punting.&quot; Especially on larger vessels, it is more effective if the operator starts at the bow and walks aft along a side deck, pushing against the bottom all the waythis action is called &quot;quanting&quot; or &quot;setting&quot;. If there is a short stretch where the water is too deep for the pole to reach the bottom, the pole can be used as a paddle. Whilst this is substantially less effective than a bladed oar or paddle, it is sufficient to keep the boat moving.

A setting pole is usually made of ash or a similar resilient wood or of hollow metal so that in either case it floats if left in the water. They are usually capped on one or both ends with metal to withstand the repeated pushing against the bottom and rocks, and to help the end of the pole sink to the bottom more quickly. A barge quant often has a cap at the top and a prong at the bottom to stop it from sinking into the mud. On the Norfolk Broads these are called a Bott and a Shoe respectively.

It can range in length from , to over . A quant is used not only to propel craft, but also to steer them by acting as a rudder. The operator of the quant can stick the quant behind the barge or punt to determine the direction of travel.

There is also a popular saying: &quot;&quot; (sometimes rendered as &quot;a 10-foot pole&quot;).

==History==

===Origins===
Use of a setting pole is probably the oldest form of propulsion of waterborne craft.

==Regional variants==
===American West===

Setting poles were used widely on the rivers of the 18th and 19th century American West to propel keelboats. The 1804 Lewis and Clark expedition relied on setting poles to propel their barge on the Missouri River. They brought six purpose-built setting poles, each eighteen feet long and capped with iron on the bottom, though they ended up losing some and replacing them with dog-travois poles taken from an abandoned Native American camp.

===Mesopotamian Marshes===
Setting poles are also used widely on the Mesopotamian Marshes to propel the mashoof canoes used by the Marsh Arabs. These poles are called &quot;marda&quot; ( in Literary Arabic) and are long and made from wood and sturdy reeds.

===Oxbridge===
The best known form of setting pole is the single-ended punt pole used in Oxford and Cambridge. A setting pole may also be used in river canoeing for navigating portions of river where the water is too shallow for a paddle to create thrust, or where the desired direction of travel is opposite a current moving fast enough to make paddling inefficient. Setting poles are also useful for fending off drifting logs and negotiating sandbars, shoals, and rocks.

===Norfolk Broads===
On the Norfolk Broads, a quant is used to propel yachts and working craft, especially those lacking an engine, when the wind does not suit. Large sailing wherries employed a quant pole at least in length.

==Using a quant (quanting)==


===Propulsion===
The quanter stands at the front of the barge or, for a punt, normally on the rear deck. The angle at which the quant is held depends on the depth of the water and the desired speed of travel. A steeper angle is required for deeper water (the bottom of the quant must be able to reach the bed of the river or canal) and a shallower angle required for speed. The quanter drives the quant downward and slightly backward to push the craft forwards. On a larger boat, the quanter then walks down the side of the boat, facing aft and braced against the quant pole, the boat being propelled forward at the speed he walks. To reverse, the quant can be pushed forwards. The quant is then pulled out of the water by placing hand over hand on it and pulling upwards (as if one were climbing down a pole).

When punting, as in Oxford and Cambridge, the quanter stands stationary at the back (Oxford and Cambridge disagree on which is the rear end: decked in Cambridge and undecked in Oxford) and slides the quant into the water at an angle forwards. As the punt glides forwards the loosely held quant becomes increasingly vertical. When the quant is just past the vertical, i.e. sloping downwards from front to back of the punt, the quanter pushes on the quant to propel the punt forwards. At the end of the pushing stroke the quant is twisted with a downward roll of the wrists to break it free from the bottom, and then retrieved by being thrown forwards hand-over-hand in readiness for the next stroke. A rhythmic and smooth style is usually considered to be &#x27;good form&#x27;.

Disaster may strike if the quanter loses grip on the quant while attempting to extract it from the bottom, and the quant is left &#x27;stuck in the mud&#x27; at an increasing distance behind the punt. This is &quot;not&quot; &#x27;good form&#x27;. It is not unknown, when the quant sticks in the mud, for an inexperienced quanter to choose to hold onto the quant rather than letting go, with the result that the quanter is left dangling from the end of the quant, and subsides slowly into the water. This, too, is considered &quot;not&quot; &#x27;good form&#x27;.

===Steering===
By dragging the quant at an angle behind the barge or punt upon the water, the craft can be made to turn. The craft will slow on the side on which the quant is in the water, so the craft will move in that direction. The greater the angle made between the quant and the barge or punt, the greater the turning angle. This effect can be enhanced (greater turning force), by pushing the quant forward through the water on the desired direction side of the craft.

Alternatively, propelling the boat with the quant placed such that there is an angle between the direction of motion and the line of the quant itself will push the rear of the craft away from the planted end of the quant, and so enable changes of direction. This method allows for corrections and steering to be accomplished without significantly slowing the craft, although it generally requires a greater degree of skill.

<text>Wivenhoe ( ) is a town and civil parish in the Colchester district, in north-eastern Essex, England, approximately south-east of Colchester. Historically Wivenhoe village, on the banks of the River Colne, and Wivenhoe Cross, on the higher ground to the north, were two separate settlements; however, with considerable development in the 19th century, the two have since merged.

At the 2011 census, the town had a population of 7,637, compared with 7,221 in 2001.

The town&#x27;s history centres on fishing, ship building and smuggling.

Much of lower Wivenhoe is also a designated conservation area, with many streets being of particular architectural interest.

==Etymology==
The place-name &quot;Wivenhoe&quot; is Saxon in origin, deriving from the personal name &quot;Wifa&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;Wife&#x27;s&quot; spur or promontory (hoe). The place-name is now usually pronounced &#x27;Wivvenho&#x27;, but the Essex accent would traditionally have rendered it as &#x27;Wivvenhoo&#x27;. According to folk etymology, the name derived from &quot;Wyvernhoe&quot;, originating from the mythical beast called a wyvern and the previously mentioned ridge (hoe). The town&#x27;s football team, Wivenhoe Town FC, is nicknamed &#x27;The Wyverns&#x27;.

== History ==
Wivenhoe is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wiivnhou&quot; in the hundred of Lexden, when it formed part of the land of Robert Gernon, where there was a mill, of meadow and pasture for 60 sheep. 
The church of St. Mary the Virgin is in the High Street and existed by 1254 when Simon Battle was the patron. The North and South aisles were built in 1340 and 1350, making it the oldest building still standing in Wivenhoe. It has a chancel with north and south chapels and a north vestry, an aisled and clerestoried nave with north and south porches, and a west tower on which there is an open-sided cupola added to the roof by 1734. The walls are of rubble, which includes some Roman tile, with ashlar dressings. Elizabeth de Vere (d. 1537), widow of John, 13th earl of Oxford, left Wivenhoe church the vestments and ornaments from her private chapel. The tower was plastered in 1563.

Wivenhoe developed as a port and until the late 19th century was effectively a port for Colchester, as large ships were unable to navigate any further up the River Colne, which widens here into its estuary. Wivenhoe had two prosperous shipyards. It became an important port for trade for Colchester and developed shipbuilding, commerce and fishing industries. The period of greatest prosperity for the town came with the arrival of the railway in 1863.

In 1884 the town suffered significant damage when it lay close to the epicentre of one of the most destructive UK earthquakes of all time – the 1884 Colchester earthquake. In 1890, there was a population of about 2,000 mostly engaged in fishing for oysters and sprats and in ship and yacht building. A dry dock was built in 1889 and extended in 1904, making it one of the largest on the East Coast; it was demolished in the mid-1960s. In the 1960s, Wivenhoe Park was chosen as the location for the University of Essex.

During the UK miners&#x27; strike, the now defunct Wivenhoe Port imported coal and became subject to picketing by miners (many from Yorkshire), which led to a very substantial police presence, some of them drafted in from other counties, and violent skirmishes as striking miners tried to prevent vehicles entering and leaving the port.

==Wivenhoe Park==

Wivenhoe Park, bordering on the town of Colchester, is the location for the University of Essex. The site was the home for several centuries of the Rebow family, descendants of Flemish clothweavers from Colchester. Wivenhoe House was designed for Isaac Martin Rebow in 1759 by Thomas Reynolds; the park itself was designed by Richard Woods and was remodelled in 1846–1847 by Thomas Hopper. A view of the house across the lake was painted by John Constable on a social visit to Major-General Francis Slater Rebow in 1816 for a fee of 100 guineas.

==Transport==

Wivenhoe railway station is situated on the Sunshine Coast Line, a branch off the Great Eastern Main Line, which links Colchester with the seaside resorts of Clacton-on-Sea and Walton-on-the-Naze. Direct electric services, operated by Abellio Greater Anglia, run from Wivenhoe station to Clacton-on-Sea, Walton-on-the-Naze, Colchester and London Liverpool Street. The station was the junction for the now defunct line to Brightlingsea (1866–1964).

The town is connected by a seasonal foot ferry service, which runs on weekends and bank holidays according to the tide from April to mid-October, across the river Colne to Fingringhoe and Rowhedge. A boat service also runs during the Summer with dates determined by tide, from Brightlingsea. Connecting water links for this service are also available from St. Osyth and East Mersea.

Local bus services are operated by First Essex and Hedingham &amp; Chambers. 
Routes serving Wivenhoe include the 74 from Colchester to Clacton.

Wivenhoe is located just over one hour away from Stansted Airport and 30 minutes from Harwich International Port.

==Society and leisure==

Wivenhoe has a population of between nine and ten thousand people with a mixture of students from the University of Essex, a long-standing artistic community, and commuters. Property prices averaged £286,000 in February 2008. The town has a number of small local shops: there is a bookshop which was established in 1976, (shortlisted for the national Independent Bookseller of the Year award 2008) a chemist, two post offices, corner house coffee shop, toy shop, delicatessen, tea rooms, Co-op, pet supplier, florist and art gallery. There are five pubs including the Black Buoy Pub, Horse and Groom, The Greyhound, The Station, and the Rose and Crown. Some of which are the venue for musical events, including a jazz club. The Crab &amp; Winkle Gallery can be found at the town&#x27;s railway station. The town is popular with students from the university who walk from the campus to enjoy the facilities of the town&#x27;s public houses and its waterfront.

The town has a number of sports and leisure clubs and societies: Wivenhoe Sailing Club&#x27;s clubhouse is just downstream of the river barrier. Wivenhoe Town Football Club play at Broad Lane Sports Ground, which is also used by Colchester United Ladies and was home to Wivenhoe Old Boys Football Club, and is also home to Wivenhoe Tennis Club. Wivenhoe Town Cricket Club is located on Rectory Road. There are a number of musical and theatre groups, and an art gallery. The King George V Playing Field is in the lower half of the town, with a small skate park, football pitches, a small play park and a dog-walking area. There is a bowls club on De Vere Lane and a bridge club meets in the Town Council&#x27;s offices.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sudbury TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Essex, Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio Essex, Actual Radio and Colne Radio, a community based station. The town is served by local newspapers, &quot;Colchester Gazette&quot;, &quot;Essex County Standard&quot; and &quot;East Anglian Daily Times&quot;.

==Education==
Wivenhoe has two primary schools: Broomgrove Infant and Junior, and Millfields Primary.

Secondary schools are available in the surrounding area. The University of Essex has been located at Wivenhoe Park since 1964.

==Notable residents==
Wivenhoe manor was owned by John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford and was passed down with the earldom until sold by Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford in 1584. The actor-manager Sir John Martin-Harvey was born in the village in 1863 (died 1944) and is commemorated by a blue plaque on Quay House, one of his childhood homes. He was the son of yacht-designer John Harvey and grandson of Thomas Harvey, yacht builder. The &quot;Volante&quot; was built by Thomas Harvey &amp; Son (Thomas &amp; Thomas Harvey junior) in the Halifax Yard at Ipswich. The &quot;Volante&quot; competed in the first America&#x27;s Cup in 1851.

Harry Bensley, who became famous for taking on a wager to walk around Britain and eighteen other countries while wearing an iron mask and pushing a perambulator, lived in the village with his wife Kate after having served in the First World War, whilst pianist and popular entertainer Semprini (1908–1990) lived in Talisman House, adjacent to the high street in Wivenhoe, during his retirement.
Wivenhoe was also the home of actress Joan Hickson (1906–1998) who played Miss Marple in the BBC adaptations of Agatha Christie&#x27;s novels and children&#x27;s author, journalist, and writer Leila Berg (1917–2012). Berg was an advocate for the empowerment of children, particularly through literature, which prompted her to devise and launch the &#x27;Nippers&#x27; series of early readers books published by Macmillan in 1968, which sought to address the exclusion of working-class and ethnic minority lives from children&#x27;s books.

British academic Anthony Everitt (b. 1940) who publishes regularly in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Financial Times&quot; also lives in Wivenhoe. Everitt was Secretary-General of the Arts Council of Great Britain and is author of &quot;Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome&#x27;s Greatest Politician&quot;. He is a visiting professor in the performing and visual arts at Nottingham Trent University, a companion of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts and an Honorary Fellow of the Dartington College of Arts. Other residents include the poet and musician Martin Newell, writer A. L. Kennedy, James Dodds, painter, printmaker and publisher under the imprint of Jardine Press, who has been described as &quot;boatbuilding&#x27;s artist laureate&quot;, and the singer Polly Scattergood, who was born in Wivenhoe before moving to London.

Painter Francis Bacon owned a house on Queens Road (no. 68) which he purchased for £6,500 so he could spend time out of London visiting his friends, the artists Dickie Chopping (1917–2008) and Denis Wirth-Miller (1915–2011). The house remained as it was for many years after his death in 1992. Several journalists and writers have also been based in the lower end of the town: George Gale (former editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; cartoonist and &quot;Daily Express&quot; columnist) parodied by &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine as &#x27;George G. Ale&#x27;, and Peregrine Worsthorne, (former editor of the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;) who both had homes there. Poet and political activist Anna Mendelson (as &#x27;Grace Lake&#x27;) was a resident of Wivenhoe and associated with the short-lived British terrorist organisation the Angry Brigade whilst a student at Essex University.

The musician Keith Christmas was born in Wivenhoe in 1946 and lived there until 1961, in a house at the top of the High Street called Myrtle Villa.

<text>A watercraft or waterborne vessel is any vehicle designed for travel across or through water bodies, such as a boat, ship, hovercraft, submersible or submarine.

==Types==
Historically, watercraft have been divided into two main categories. 
*Rafts, which gain their buoyancy from the fastening together of components that are each buoyant in their own right. Generally, a raft is a &quot;flow through&quot; structures, whose users would have difficulty keeping dry as it passes through waves. Consequently, apart from short journeys (such as a river crossing) their use is confined to warmer regions (roughly 40° N to 40° S). Outside this area, use of rafts at sea are impracticable due to the risks of exposure to the crew. Rafts divide into a number of types bundle raft can be made from, for example, papyrus that has been tied into bundles. These can even be shaped
*Boats and ships, which float by having the submerged part of their structure exclude water with a waterproof surface, so creating a space that contains air, as well as cargo, passengers, crew, etc. In total, this structure weighs less than the water that would occupy the same volume.

Watercraft can be grouped into &quot;surface vessels&quot;, which include ships, yachts, boats, hydroplanes, wingships, unmanned surface vehicles, sailboards and human-powered craft such as rafts, canoes, kayaks and paddleboards; &quot;underwater vessels&quot;, which include submarines, submersibles, unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), wet subs and diver propulsion vehicles; and &quot;amphibious vehicles&quot;, which include hovercraft, car boats, amphibious ATVs and seaplanes. Many of these watercraft have a variety of subcategories and are used for different needs and applications.

==Design==

The design of watercraft requires a tradeoff among internal capacity (tonnage), speed and seaworthiness. Tonnage is important for transport of goods, speed is important for warships and racing vessels, and the degree of seaworthiness varies according to the bodies of water on which a watercraft is used. Regulations apply to larger watercraft, to avoid foundering at sea and other problems. Design technologies include the use of computer modeling and ship model basin testing before construction.

==Propulsion==

Watercraft propulsion can be divided into five categories.
*Water power is used by drifting with a river current or a tidal stream. An anchor or weight may be lowered to provide enough steerage way to keep in the best part of the current (as in drudging) or paddles or poles might be used to keep position.
*Human effort is used through a pole pushing against the bottom of shallow water, or paddles or oars operating in the surface of the water. 
*Wind power is used by sails
*Towing is used, either from the land, such as the bank of a canal, with the motive power provided by draught animals, humans or machinery, or one watercraft may tow another.
*Mechanical propulsion uses a motor whose power is derived from burning a fuel or stored energy such as batteries. This power is commonly converted into propulsion by propellers or by water jets, with paddle wheels being a largely historical method.

Any one watercraft might use more than one of these methods at different times or in conjunction with each other. For instance, early steamships often set sails to work alongside the engine power. Before steam tugs became common, sailing vessels would back and fill their sails to maintain a good position in a tidal stream while drifting with the tide in or out of a river. In a modern yacht, motor-sailingtravelling under the power of both sails and engineis a common method of making progress, if only in and out of harbour.

<doc id="301666" wikidata="Q1179448" url="?curid=301666" title="De Sitter space">
<text>In mathematical physics, &quot;n&quot;-dimensional de Sitter space (often denoted dS&quot;n&quot;) is a maximally symmetric Lorentzian manifold with constant positive scalar curvature. It is the Lorentzian analogue of an &quot;n&quot;-sphere (with its canonical Riemannian metric).

The main application of de Sitter space is its use in general relativity, where it serves as one of the simplest mathematical models of the universe consistent with the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. More specifically, de Sitter space is the maximally symmetric vacuum solution of Einstein&#x27;s field equations with a positive cosmological constant formula_1 (corresponding to a positive vacuum energy density and negative pressure).

De Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space are named after Willem de Sitter (1872–1934), professor of astronomy at Leiden University and director of the Leiden Observatory. Willem de Sitter and Albert Einstein worked closely together in Leiden in the 1920s on the spacetime structure of our universe. De Sitter space was also discovered, independently, and about the same time, by Tullio Levi-Civita.

== Definition ==
A de Sitter space can be defined as a submanifold of a generalized Minkowski space of one higher dimension, including the induced metric. Take Minkowski space R1,&quot;n&quot; with the standard metric:
formula_2

The &quot;n&quot;-dimensional de Sitter space is the submanifold described by the hyperboloid of one sheet
formula_3
where formula_4 is some nonzero constant with its dimension being that of length. The induced metric on the de Sitter space is induced from the ambient Minkowski metric. It is nondegenerate and has Lorentzian signature. (If one replaces formula_5 with formula_6 in the above definition, one obtains a hyperboloid of two sheets. The induced metric in this case is positive-definite, and each sheet is a copy of hyperbolic &quot;n&quot;-space. See &quot;&quot;.)

The de Sitter space can also be defined as the quotient of two indefinite orthogonal groups, which shows that it is a non-Riemannian symmetric space.

Topologically, dS&quot;n&quot; is (which is simply connected if ).

== Properties ==
The isometry group of de Sitter space is the Lorentz group . The metric therefore then has independent Killing vector fields and is maximally symmetric. Every maximally symmetric space has constant curvature. The Riemann curvature tensor of de Sitter is given by
: formula_7
(using the sign convention formula_8 for the Riemann curvature tensor). De Sitter space is an Einstein manifold since the Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric:
: formula_9

This means de Sitter space is a vacuum solution of Einstein&#x27;s equation with cosmological constant given by
: formula_10

The scalar curvature of de Sitter space is given by
: formula_11

For the case , we have and .

== Coordinates ==
=== Static coordinates ===
We can introduce static coordinates formula_12 for de Sitter as follows:
: formula_13

where formula_14 gives the standard embedding the -sphere in R&quot;n&quot;−1. In these coordinates the de Sitter metric takes the form:
: formula_15

Note that there is a cosmological horizon at formula_16.

=== Flat slicing ===
Let
: formula_17
where formula_18. Then in the formula_19 coordinates metric reads:
: formula_20
where formula_21 is the flat metric on formula_22&#x27;s.

Setting formula_23, we obtain the conformally flat metric:
: formula_24

=== Open slicing ===
Let
: formula_25
where formula_26 forming a formula_27 with the standard metric formula_28. Then the metric of the de Sitter space reads
: formula_29
where
: formula_30
is the standard hyperbolic metric.

=== Closed slicing ===
Let
: formula_31
where formula_14s describe a formula_33. Then the metric reads:
: formula_34

Changing the time variable to the conformal time via formula_35 we obtain a metric conformally equivalent to Einstein static universe:
: formula_36

These coordinates, also known as &quot;global coordinates&quot; cover the maximal extension of de Sitter space, and can therefore be used to find its Penrose diagram.

=== dS slicing ===
Let
: formula_37
where formula_14s describe a formula_39. Then the metric reads:
: formula_40
where
: formula_41
is the metric of an formula_42 dimensional de Sitter space with radius of curvature formula_4 in open slicing coordinates. The hyperbolic metric is given by:
: formula_44

This is the analytic continuation of the open slicing coordinates under formula_45 and also switching formula_46 and formula_47 because they change their timelike/spacelike nature.

<text>In mathematics and physics, &quot;n&quot;-dimensional anti-de Sitter space (AdS&quot;n&quot;) is a maximally symmetric Lorentzian manifold with constant negative scalar curvature. Anti-de Sitter space and de Sitter space are named after Willem de Sitter (1872–1934), professor of astronomy at Leiden University and director of the Leiden Observatory. Willem de Sitter and Albert Einstein worked together closely in Leiden in the 1920s on the spacetime structure of the universe. Paul Dirac was the first person to rigorously explore anti-de Sitter space, doing so in 1963.

Manifolds of constant curvature are most familiar in the case of two dimensions, where the elliptic plane or surface of a sphere is a surface of constant positive curvature, a flat (i.e., Euclidean) plane is a surface of constant zero curvature, and a hyperbolic plane is a surface of constant negative curvature.

Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity places space and time on equal footing, so that one considers the geometry of a unified spacetime instead of considering space and time separately. The cases of spacetime of constant curvature are de Sitter space (positive), Minkowski space (zero), and anti-de Sitter space (negative). As such, they are exact solutions of the Einstein field equations for an empty universe with a positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant, respectively.

Anti-de Sitter space generalises to any number of space dimensions. In higher dimensions, it is best known for its role in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which suggests that it is possible to describe a force in quantum mechanics (like electromagnetism, the weak force or the strong force) in a certain number of dimensions (for example four) with a string theory where the strings exist in an anti-de Sitter space, with one additional (non-compact) dimension.

== Non-technical explanation ==

=== Technical terms translated ===
A maximally symmetric Lorentzian manifold is a spacetime in which no point in space and time can be distinguished in any way from another, and (being Lorentzian) the only way in which a direction (or tangent to a path at a spacetime point) can be distinguished is whether it is spacelike, lightlike or timelike. The space of special relativity (Minkowski space) is an example.

A constant scalar curvature means a general relativity gravity-like bending of spacetime that has a curvature described by a single number that is the same everywhere in spacetime in the absence of matter or energy.

Negative curvature means curved hyperbolically, like a saddle surface or the Gabriel&#x27;s Horn surface, similar to that of a trumpet bell.

=== Spacetime in general relativity ===
General relativity is a theory of the nature of time, space and gravity in which gravity is a curvature of space and time that results from the presence of matter or energy. Energy and mass are equivalent (as expressed in the equation &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;2). Space and time values can be related respectively to time and space units by multiplying or dividing the value by the speed of light (e.g., seconds times meters per second equals meters).

A common analogy involves the way that a dip in a flat sheet of rubber, caused by a heavy object sitting on it, influences the path taken by small objects rolling nearby, causing them to deviate inward from the path they would have followed had the heavy object been absent. Of course, in general relativity, both the small and large objects mutually influence the curvature of spacetime.

The attractive force of gravity created by matter is due to a negative curvature of spacetime, represented in the rubber sheet analogy by the negatively curved (trumpet-bell-like) dip in the sheet.

A key feature of general relativity is that it describes gravity not as a conventional force like electromagnetism, but as a change in the geometry of spacetime that results from the presence of matter or energy.

The analogy used above describes the curvature of a two-dimensional space caused by gravity in general relativity in a three-dimensional superspace in which the third dimension corresponds to the effect of gravity. A geometrical way of thinking about general relativity describes the effects of the gravity in the real world four-dimensional space geometrically by projecting that space into a five-dimensional superspace with the fifth dimension corresponding to the curvature in spacetime that is produced by gravity and gravity-like effects in general relativity.

As a result, in general relativity, the familiar Newtonian equation of gravity formula_1 (i.e. the gravitational pull between two objects equals the gravitational constant times the product of their masses divided by the square of the distance between them) is merely an approximation of the gravity effects seen in general relativity. However this approximation becomes inaccurate in extreme physical situations, like relativistic speeds (light, in particular), or very large &amp; dense masses.

In general relativity, gravity is caused by spacetime being curved (&quot;distorted&quot;). It is a common misconception to attribute gravity to curved space; neither space nor time has an absolute meaning in relativity. Nevertheless, to describe weak gravity, as on the Earth, it is sufficient to consider time distortion in a particular coordinate system. We find gravity on the Earth very noticeable while relativistic time distortion requires precision instruments to detect. The reason why we do not become aware of relativistic effects in our everyday life is the huge value of the speed of light ( approximately), which makes us perceive space and time as different entities.

=== De Sitter space in general relativity ===
De Sitter space involves a variation of general relativity in which spacetime is slightly curved in the absence of matter or energy. This is analogous to the relationship between Euclidean geometry and non-Euclidean geometry.

An intrinsic curvature of spacetime in the absence of matter or energy is modeled by the cosmological constant in general relativity. This corresponds to the vacuum having an energy density and pressure. This spacetime geometry results in momentarily parallel timelike geodesics diverging, with spacelike sections having positive curvature.

=== Anti-de Sitter space distinguished from de Sitter space ===
An anti-de Sitter space in general relativity is similar to a de Sitter space, except with the sign of the spacetime curvature changed. In anti-de Sitter space, in the absence of matter or energy, the curvature of spacelike sections is negative, corresponding to a hyperbolic geometry, and momentarily parallel timelike geodesics eventually intersect. This corresponds to a negative cosmological constant, where empty space itself has negative energy density but positive pressure, unlike the standard ΛCDM model of our own universe for which observations of distant supernovae indicate a positive cosmological constant corresponding to (asymptotic) de Sitter space.

In an anti-de Sitter space, as in a de Sitter space, the inherent spacetime curvature corresponds to the cosmological constant.

The anti-de Sitter space AdS2 is also the de Sitter space dS2 through an exchange of the timelike and spacelike labels. Such a relabelling reverses the sign of the curvature, which is conventionally referenced to the directions that are labelled spacelike.

=== De Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space viewed as embedded in five dimensions ===
The analogy used above describes curvature of a two-dimensional space caused by gravity in a flat ambient space of one dimension higher. Similarly, the (curved) de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spaces of four dimensions can be embedded into a (flat) pseudo-Riemannian space of five dimensions. This allows distances and angles within the embedded space to be directly determined from those in the five-dimensional flat space.

=== Caveats ===
The remainder of this article explains the details of these concepts with a much more rigorous and precise mathematical and physical description. People are ill-suited to visualizing things in five or more dimensions, but mathematical equations are not similarly challenged and can represent five-dimensional concepts in a way just as appropriate as the methods that mathematical equations use to describe easier-to-visualize three- and four-dimensional concepts.

There is a particularly important implication of the more precise mathematical description that differs from the analogy-based heuristic description of de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space above. The mathematical description of anti-de Sitter space generalizes the idea of curvature. In the mathematical description, curvature is a property of a particular point and can be divorced from some invisible surface to which curved points in spacetime meld themselves. So for example, concepts like singularities (the most widely known of which in general relativity is the black hole) which cannot be expressed completely in a real world geometry, can correspond to particular states of a mathematical equation.

The full mathematical description also captures some subtle distinctions made in general relativity between space-like dimensions and time-like dimensions.

== Definition and properties ==
Much as spherical and hyperbolic spaces can be visualized by an isometric embedding in a flat space of one higher dimension (as the sphere and pseudosphere respectively), anti-de Sitter space can be visualized as the Lorentzian analogue of a sphere in a space of one additional dimension. The extra dimension is timelike. In this article we adopt the convention that the metric in a timelike direction is negative.
The anti-de Sitter space of signature can then be isometrically embedded in the space formula_2 with coordinates and the metric
: formula_3
as the quasi-sphere
: formula_4
where formula_5 is a nonzero constant with dimensions of length (the radius of curvature). This is a (generalized) sphere in the sense that it is a collection of points for which the &quot;distance&quot; (determined by the quadratic form) from the origin is constant, but visually it is a hyperboloid, as in the image shown.

The metric on anti-de Sitter space is that induced from the ambient metric. It is nondegenerate and, in the case of has Lorentzian signature.

When , this construction gives a standard hyperbolic space. The remainder of the discussion applies when .

=== Closed timelike curves and the universal cover ===
When , the embedding above has closed timelike curves; for example, the path parameterized by formula_6 and all other coordinates zero, is such a curve. When these curves are inherent to the geometry (unsurprisingly, as any space with more than one temporal dimension contains closed timelike curves), but when , they can be eliminated by passing to the universal covering space, effectively &quot;unrolling&quot; the embedding. A similar situation occurs with the pseudosphere, which curls around on itself although the hyperbolic plane does not; as a result it contains self-intersecting straight lines (geodesics) while the hyperbolic plane does not. Some authors define anti-de Sitter space as equivalent to the embedded quasi-sphere itself, while others define it as equivalent to the universal cover of the embedding.

=== Symmetries ===
If the universal cover is not taken, anti-de Sitter space has  as its isometry group. If the universal cover is taken the isometry group is a cover of . This is most easily understood by defining anti-de Sitter space as a symmetric space, using the quotient space construction, given below.

=== Instability ===
The unproven &quot;AdS instability conjecture&quot; introduced by the physicists Piotr Bizon and Andrzej Rostworowski in 2011 states that arbitrarily small perturbations of certain shapes in AdS lead to the formation of black holes. Mathematician Georgios Moschidis proved that given spherical symmetry, the conjecture holds true for the specific cases of the Einstein-null dust system with an internal mirror (2017) and the Einstein-massless Vlasov system (2018).

== Coordinate patches ==
A coordinate patch covering part of the space gives the half-space coordinatization of anti-de Sitter space. The metric tensor for this patch is
: formula_7
with formula_8 giving the half-space. This metric is conformally equivalent to a flat half-space Minkowski spacetime.

The constant time slices of this coordinate patch are hyperbolic spaces in the Poincaré half-space metric. In the limit as formula_9, this half-space metric is conformally equivalent to the Minkowski metric formula_10. Thus, the anti-de Sitter space contains a conformal Minkowski space at infinity (&quot;infinity&quot; having y-coordinate zero in this patch).

In AdS space time is periodic, and the universal cover has non-periodic time. The coordinate patch above covers half of a single period of the spacetime.

Because the conformal infinity of AdS is timelike, specifying the initial data on a spacelike hypersurface would not determine the future evolution uniquely (&quot;i.e.&quot; deterministically) unless there are boundary conditions associated with the conformal infinity.

The adjacent image represents the &quot;half-space&quot; region of anti-de Sitter space and its boundary. The interior of the cylinder corresponds to anti-de Sitter spacetime, while its cylindrical boundary corresponds to its conformal boundary. The green shaded region in the interior corresponds to the region of AdS covered by the half-space coordinates and it is bounded by two null, &quot;aka&quot; lightlike, geodesic hyperplanes; the green shaded area on the surface corresponds to the region of conformal space covered by Minkowski space.

The green shaded region covers half of the AdS space and half of the conformal spacetime; the left ends of the green discs will touch in the same fashion as the right ends.

== As a homogeneous, symmetric space ==
In the same way that the 2-sphere
: formula_11
is a quotient of two orthogonal groups, anti-de Sitter with parity (reflectional symmetry) and time reversal symmetry can be seen as a quotient of two generalized orthogonal groups
: formula_12
whereas AdS without P or C can be seen as the quotient
: formula_13
of spin groups.

This quotient formulation gives formula_14 the structure of a homogeneous space. The Lie algebra of the generalized orthogonal group formula_15 is given by matrices
: formula_16,
where formula_17 is a skew-symmetric matrix. A complementary generator in the Lie algebra of formula_18 is
: formula_19 
These two fulfill formula_20. Explicit matrix computation shows that 
formula_21 and formula_22. Thus, anti-de Sitter is a reductive homogeneous space, and a non-Riemannian symmetric space.

== An overview of AdS spacetime in physics and its properties ==
formula_14 is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vacuum solution for the theory of gravitation with Einstein–Hilbert action with negative cosmological constant formula_24, (formula_25), i.e. the theory described by the following Lagrangian density:
: formula_26,
where is the gravitational constant in -dimensional spacetime.
Therefore, it is a solution of the Einstein field equations:
: formula_27
where formula_28 is Einstein tensor and formula_29 is the metric of the spacetime. Introducing the radius formula_5 as formula_31, this solution can be immersed in a formula_32-dimensional flat spacetime with the metric formula_33 in coordinates formula_34 by the following constraint:
: formula_35

=== Global coordinates ===
formula_14 is parametrized in global coordinates by the parameters formula_37 as:
: formula_38,
where formula_39 parametrize a formula_40 sphere, and in terms of the coordinates formula_41 they are formula_42, formula_43, formula_44 and so on. The formula_14 metric in these coordinates is:
: formula_46
where formula_47 and formula_48. Considering the periodicity of time formula_49 and in order to avoid closed timelike curves (CTC), one should take the universal cover formula_50. In the limit formula_51 one can approach to the boundary of this spacetime usually called formula_14 conformal boundary.

With the transformations formula_53 and formula_54 we can have the usual formula_14 metric in global coordinates:
: formula_56
where formula_57

=== Poincaré coordinates ===
By the following parametrization:
: formula_58
the formula_59 metric in the Poincaré coordinates is:
: formula_60
in which formula_61. The codimension 2 surface formula_62 is the Poincaré Killing horizon and formula_63 approaches to the boundary of formula_14 spacetime. So unlike the global coordinates, the Poincaré coordinates do not cover all formula_14 manifold. Using formula_66 this metric can be written in the following way:
: formula_67
where formula_68. By the transformation formula_69 also it can be written as:
: formula_70

This latter coordinates are the coordinates which are usually used in AdS/CFT correspondence, with the boundary of AdS at formula_71. 

=== FRW open slicing coordinates ===
Since AdS is maximally symmetric, it is also possible to cast it in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic form like FRW spacetimes (see Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric). The spatial geometry must be negatively curved (open) and the metric is 
: formula_72
where formula_73 is the standard metric on the formula_74-dimensional hyperbolic plane. Of course, this does not cover all of AdS. These coordinates are related to the global embedding coordinates by
: formula_75
where formula_76 parameterize the formula_77.

=== De Sitter slicing ===
Let
: formula_78
where formula_76 parameterize the formula_77. Then the metric reads:
: formula_81
where
: formula_82
is the metric of an formula_83 dimensional de Sitter space with radius of curvature formula_5 in open slicing coordinates. The hyperbolic metric is given by:
: formula_85

=== Geometric properties ===
AdS&quot;n&quot; metric with radius formula_5 is one of the maximal symmetric &quot;n&quot;-dimensional spacetimes. It has the following geometric properties:
:; Riemann curvature tensor : formula_87
:; Ricci curvature : formula_88
:; Scalar curvature : formula_89

<text>Trotula is a name referring to a group of three texts on women&#x27;s medicine that were composed in the southern Italian port town of Salerno in the 12th century. The name derives from a historic female figure, Trota of Salerno, a physician and medical writer who was associated with one of the three texts. However, &quot;Trotula&quot; came to be understood as a real person in the Middle Ages and because the so-called &quot;Trotula&quot; texts circulated widely throughout medieval Europe, from Spain to Poland, and Sicily to Ireland, &quot;Trotula&quot; has historic importance in &quot;her&quot; own right.

==The &quot;Trotula&quot; texts: genesis and authorship==
In the 12th century, the southern Italian port town of Salerno was widely reputed as &quot;the most important center for the introduction of Arabic medicine into Western Europe&quot;. In referring to the School of Salerno in the 12th century, historians mean a school in the sense of a school of thought: an informal community of masters and pupils who, over the course of the 12th century, developed more or less formal methods of instruction and investigation; there is no evidence of any physical or legal entity before the 13th century.

&quot;Conditions of Women&quot;, &quot;Treatments for Women&quot;, and &quot;Women’s Cosmetics&quot; are usually referred to collectively as &quot;The Trotula&quot;. They cover topics from childbirth to cosmetics, relying on varying sources from Galen to oral traditions, providing practical instructions. These works vary in both organization and content. &quot;Conditions of Women&quot; and &quot;Women’s Cosmetics&quot; circulated anonymously until they were combined with &quot;Treatments for Women&quot; sometime in the late 12th century. For the next several hundred years, the &quot;Trotula&quot; ensemble circulated throughout Europe, reaching its greatest popularity in the 14th century. More than 130 copies exist today of the Latin texts, and over 60 copies of the many medieval vernacular translations.

=== &quot;Liber de sinthomatibus mulierum&quot; (&quot;Book on the Conditions of Women&quot;) ===
The &quot;Liber de sinthomatibus mulierum&quot; (&quot;Book on the Conditions of Women&quot;) was novel in its adoption of the new Arabic medicine that had just begun to make inroads into Europe. As Green demonstrated in 1996, &quot;Conditions of Women&quot; draws heavily on the gynecological and obstetrical chapters of the &quot;Viaticum&quot;, Constantine the African&#x27;s Latin translation of Ibn al-Jazzar&#x27;s Arabic &quot;Zad al-musafir&quot;, which had been completed in the late 11th century. Arabic medicine was more speculative and philosophical, drawing from the principles of Galen. Galen, as opposed to other notable physicians, believed that menstruation was a necessary and healthy purgation. Galen asserted that women are colder than men and unable to “cook” their nutrients; thus they must eliminate excess substance through menstruation. Indeed, the author presents a positive view of the role of menstruation in women&#x27;s health and fertility: &quot;Menstrual blood is special because it carries in it a living being. It works like a tree. Before bearing fruit, a tree must first bear flowers. Menstrual blood is like the flower: it must emerge before the fruit—the baby—can be born.&quot; Another condition that the author addresses at length is suffocation of the womb; this results from, among other causes, an excess of female semen (another Galenic idea). Seemingly conflicted between two different theoretical positions—one that suggested it was possible for the womb to &quot;wander&quot; within the body, and another which saw such movement as anatomically impossible—the author seems to admit the possibility that the womb rises to the respiratory organs. Other issues discussed at length are treatment for and the proper regimen for a newly born child. There are discussions on topics covering menstrual disorders and uterine prolapse, chapters on childbirth and pregnancy, in addition to many others. All the named authorities cited in the &quot;Liber de sinthomatibus mulierum&quot; are male: Hippocrates, Oribasius, Dioscorides, Paulus, and Justinus.

=== &quot;De curis mulierum&quot; (&quot;On Treatments for Women&quot;) ===
&quot;De curis mulierum&quot; (&quot;On Treatments for Women&quot;) is the only one of the three &quot;Trotula&quot; texts that is actually attributed to the Salernitan practitioner Trota of Salerno when it circulated as an independent text. However, it has been argued that it is perhaps better to refer to Trota as the &quot;authority&quot; who stands behind this text than its actual author. The author does not provide theories related to gynecological conditions or their causes, but simply informs the reader how to prepare and apply medical preparations. There is a lack of cohesion, but there are sections related to gynecological, andrological, pediatric, cosmetic, and general medical conditions. Beyond a pronounced focus on treatment for fertility, there is a range of pragmatic instructions like how to “restore” virginity, as well as treatments for concerns such as difficulties with bladder control and cracked lips caused by too much kissing. In a work stressing female medical issues, remedies for men&#x27;s disorders are included as well.

=== &quot;De ornatu mulierum&quot; (&quot;On Women’s Cosmetics&quot;) ===
&quot;De ornatu mulierum&quot; (&quot;On Women&#x27;s Cosmetics&quot;) is a treatise that teaches how to conserve and improve women&#x27;s beauty. It opens with a preface (later omitted from the &quot;Trotula&quot; ensemble) in which the author refers to himself with a masculine pronoun and explains his ambition to earn &quot;a delightful multitude of friends&quot; by assembling this body of learning on care of the hair (including bodily hair), face, lips, teeth, mouth, and (in the original version) the genitalia. As Green has noted, the author likely hoped for a wide audience, for he observed that women beyond the Alps would not have access to the spas that Italian women did and therefore included instructions for an alternative steam bath. The author does not claim that the preparations he describes are his own inventions. One therapy that he claims to have personally witnessed, was created by a Sicilian woman, and he added another remedy on the same topic (mouth odor) which he himself endorses. Otherwise, the rest of the text seems to gather together remedies learned from empirical practitioners: he explicitly describes ways that he has incorporated &quot;the rules of women whom I found to be practical in practicing the art of cosmetics.&quot; But while women may have been his sources, they were not his immediate audience: he presented his highly structured work for the benefit of other male practitioners eager, like himself, to profit from their knowledge of making women beautiful.

Six times in the original version of the text, the author credits specific practices to Muslim women, whose cosmetic practices are known to have been imitated by Christian women on Sicily. And the text overall presents an image of an international market of spices and aromatics regularly traded in the Islamic world. Frankincense, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and galangal are all used repeatedly. More than the other two texts that would make up the &quot;Trotula&quot; ensemble, the &quot;De ornatu mulierum&quot; seems to capture both the empiricism of local southern Italian culture and the rich material culture made available as the Norman kings of southern Italy embraced Islamic culture on Sicily.

== The Medieval legacy of the &quot;Trotula&quot; ==
The &quot;Trotula&quot; texts are considered the &quot;most popular assembly of materials on women&#x27;s medicine from the late twelfth through the fifteenth centuries.&quot; The nearly 200 extant manuscripts (Latin and vernacular) of the &quot;Trotula&quot; represent only a small portion of the original number that circulated around Europe from the late 12th century to the end of the 15th century. Certain versions of the &quot;Trotula&quot; enjoyed a pan-European circulation. These works reached their peak popularity in Latin around the turn of the 14th century. The many medieval vernacular translations carried the texts&#x27; popularity into the 15th century and, in Germany and England, the 16th.

All three &quot;Trotula&quot; texts circulated for several centuries as independent texts. Each is found in several different versions, likely due to the interventions of later editors or scribes. Already by the late 12th century, however, one or more anonymous editors recognized the inherent relatedness of the three independent Salernitan texts on women&#x27;s medicine and cosmetics, and so brought them together into a single ensemble. In all, when she surveyed the entire extant corpus of &quot;Trotula&quot; manuscripts in 1996, Green identified eight different versions of the Latin &quot;Trotula&quot; ensemble. These versions differ sometimes in wording, but more obviously by the addition, deletion, or rearrangement of certain material. The so-called &quot;standardized ensemble&quot; reflects the most mature stage of the text, and it seemed especially attractive in university settings. A survey of known owners of the Latin &quot;Trotula&quot; in all its forms showed it not simply in the hands of learned physicians throughout western and central Europe, but also in the hands of monks in England, Germany, and Switzerland; surgeons in Italy and Catalonia; and even certain kings of France and England.

===Medieval vernacular translations===

The trend toward using vernacular languages for medical writing began in the 12th century, and grew increasingly in the later Middle Ages. The many vernacular translations of the &quot;Trotula&quot; were therefore part of a general trend. The first known translation was into Hebrew, made somewhere in southern France in the late 12th century. The next translations, in the 13th century, were into Anglo-Norman and Old French. And in the 14th and 15th centuries, there are translations in Dutch, Middle English, French (again), German, Irish, and Italian. Most recently, a Catalan translation of one of the &quot;Trotula&quot; texts has been discovered in a 15th-century medical miscellany, held by the Biblioteca Riccardiana in Florence. This fragmentary translation of the &quot;De curis mulierum&quot; is here collated by the copyist (probably a surgeon making a copy for his own use) with a Latin version of the text, highlighting the differences.

The existence of vernacular translations suggests that the &quot;Trotula&quot; texts were finding new audiences. Almost assuredly they were, but not necessarily women. Only seven of the nearly two dozen medieval translations are explicitly addressed to female audiences, and even some of those translations were co-opted by male readers. The first documented female owner of a copy of the &quot;Trotula&quot; is Dorothea Susanna von der Pfalz, Duchess of Saxony-Weimar (1544–92), who had made for her own use a copy of Johannes Hartlieb’s paired German translations of the pseudo-Albertus Magnus &quot;Secrets of Women&quot; and &quot;Das Buch Trotula&quot;.

===&quot;Trotula&#x27;s&quot; fame in the Middle Ages===
Medieval readers of the &quot;Trotula&quot; texts would have had no reason to doubt the attribution they found in the manuscripts, and so &quot;Trotula&quot; (assuming they understood the word as a personal name instead of a title) was accepted as an authority on women&#x27;s medicine. The physician Petrus Hispanus (mid-13th century), for example, cited &quot;domina Trotula&quot; (Lady Trotula) multiple times in his section on women&#x27;s gynecological and obstetrical conditions. The Amiens chancellor, poet, and physician, Richard de Fournival (d. 1260), commissioned a copy headed &quot;Incipit liber Trotule sanatricis Salernitane de curis mulierum&quot; (&quot;Here begins the book of Trotula, the Salernitan female healer, on treatments for women&quot;). Two copies of the Latin &quot;Trotula&quot; ensemble include imaginative portrayals of the author; the pen-and-ink wash image found in an early 14th-century manuscript now held by the Wellcome Library is the most well-known image of &quot;Trotula&quot; (see image above). A few 13th-century references to &quot;Trotula,&quot; however, cite her only as an authority on cosmetics. The belief that &quot;Trotula&quot; was the ultimate authority on the topic of women&#x27;s medicine even caused works authored by others to be attributed to her, such as a 15th-century Middle English compendium on gynecology and obstetrics based on the works of the male authors Gilbertus Anglicus and Muscio, which in one of its four extant copies was called the &quot;Liber Trotularis&quot;. Similarly, a 14th-century Catalan author entitled his work primarily focused on women&#x27;s cosmetics &quot;Lo libre . . . al qual a mes nom Trotula&quot; (&quot;The Book ... which is called &#x27;Trotula&#x27;&quot;).

Alongside &quot;her&quot; role as a medical authority, &quot;Trotula&quot; came to serve a new function starting in the 13th century: that of a mouthpiece for misogynous views on the nature of women. In part, this was connected to a general trend to acquire information about the &quot;secrets of women&quot;, that is, the processes of generation. When the Munich physician Johannes Hartlieb (d. 1468) made a German translation of the &quot;Trotula&quot;, he not only elevated &quot;Trotula&#x27;s&quot; status to that of a queen, but also paired the text with the pseudo-Albertan &quot;Secrets of Women&quot;. A text called &quot;Placides and Timeus&quot; attributed to &quot;Trotula&quot; a special authority both because of what she &quot;felt in herself, since she was a woman&quot;, and because &quot;all women revealed their inner thoughts more readily to her than to any man and told her their natures.&quot; Geoffrey Chaucer is echoing this attitude when he includes &quot;Trotula&#x27;s&quot; name in his &quot;Book of Wicked Wives,&quot; a collection of anti-matrimonial and misogynous tracts owned by the Wife of Bath&#x27;s fifth husband, Jankyn, as told in The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale (Prologue, (D), 669–85) of The Canterbury Tales.

==The modern legacy of the &quot;Trotula&quot;==

=== Renaissance editions of the &quot;Trotula&quot; and early debates about authorship ===
The &quot;Trotula&quot; texts first appeared in print in 1544, quite late in the trend toward printing, which for medical texts had begun in the 1470s. The &quot;Trotula&quot; was published not because it was still of immediate clinical use to learned physicians (it had been superseded in that role by a variety of other texts in the 15th century), but because it had been newly &quot;discovered&quot; as a witness to empirical medicine by a Strasbourg publisher, Johannes Schottus. Schottus persuaded a physician colleague, Georg Kraut, to edit the &quot;Trotula&quot;, which Schottus then included in a volume he called &quot;Experimentarius medicinae&quot; (&quot;Collection of Tried-and-True Remedies of Medicine&quot;), which also included the &quot;Physica&quot; of Trota of Salerno&#x27;s near contemporary, Hildegard of Bingen. Kraut, seeing the disorder in the texts, but not recognizing that it was really the work of three separate authors, rearranged the entire work into 61 themed chapters. He also took the liberty of altering the text here and there. As Green has noted, &quot;The irony of Kraut&#x27;s attempt to endow &#x27;Trotula&#x27; with a single, orderly, fully rationalized text was that, in the process, he was to obscure for the next 400 years the distinctive contributions of the historic woman Trota.&quot;

Kraut (and his publisher, Schottus) retained the attribution of the text(s) to &quot;Trotula.&quot; In fact, in applying a singular new title--&quot;Trotulae curandarum aegritudinum muliebrium ante, in, &amp; postpartum Liber&quot; (&quot;The Book of Trotula on the Treatment of the Diseases of Women before, during, and after Birth&quot;)--Kraut and Schottus proudly emphasized &quot;Trotula&#x27;s&quot; feminine identity. Schottus praised her as &quot;a woman by no means of the common sort, but rather one of great experience and erudition.&quot; In his &quot;cleaning up&quot; of the text, Kraut had suppressed all obvious hints that this was a medieval text rather than an ancient one. When the text was next printed, in 1547 (all subsequent printings of the &quot;Trotula&quot; would recycle Kraut&#x27;s edition), it appeared in a collection called &quot;Medici antiqui omnes qui latinis litteris diversorum morborum genera &amp; remedia persecuti sunt, undique conquisiti&quot; (&quot;[The Writings of] All Ancient Latin Physicians Who Described and Collected the Types and Remedies of Various Diseases&quot;). From then until the 18th century, the &quot;Trotula&quot; was treated as if it were an ancient text. As Green notes, &quot;&#x27;Trotula&#x27;, therefore, in contrast to Hildegard, survived the scrutiny of Renaissance humanists because she was able to escape her medieval associations. But it was this very success that would eventually &#x27;unwoman&#x27; her. When the &quot;Trotula&quot; was reprinted in eight further editions between 1550 and 1572, it was not because it was the work of a woman but because it was the work of an &quot;antiquissimus auctor&quot; (&quot;a very ancient author&quot;).&quot;

&quot;Trotula&quot; was &quot;unwomaned&quot; in 1566 by Hans Caspar Wolf, who was the first to incorporate the &quot;Trotula&quot; into a collection of gynecological texts. Wolf emended the author&#x27;s name from &quot;Trotula&quot; to Eros, a freed male slave of the Roman empress Julia: &quot;The book of women’s matters of Eros, physician [and] freedman of Julia, whom some have absurdly named ‘Trotula’&quot; (&quot;Erotis medici liberti Iuliae, quem aliqui Trotulam inepte nominant, muliebrium liber&quot;). The idea came from Hadrianus Junius (Aadrian DeJonghe, 1511–75), a Dutch physician who believed that textual corruptions accounted for many false attributions of ancient texts. As Green has noted, however, even though the erasure of &quot;Trotula&quot; was more an act of humanist editorial zeal than blatant misogyny, the fact that there were now no female authors left in the emerging canon of writers on gynecology and obstetrics was never noted.

===Modern debates about authorship and &quot;Trotula&#x27;s&quot; existence===
If &quot;Trotula&quot; as a female author had no use to humanist physicians, that was not necessarily true of other intellectuals. In 1681, the Italian historian Antonio Mazza resurrected &quot;Trotula&quot; in his &quot;Historiarum Epitome de rebus salernitanis&quot; (&quot;Epitome of the Histories of Salerno&quot;). Here is the origin of the belief that &quot;Trotula&quot; held a chair at the university of Salerno: &quot;There flourished in the fatherland, teaching at the university [studium] and lecturing from their professorial chairs, Abella, Mercuriadis, Rebecca, Trotta (whom some people call &quot;Trotula&quot;), all of whom ought to be celebrated with marvelous encomia (as Tiraqueau has noted), as well as Sentia Guarna (as Fortunatus Fidelis has said).&quot; Green has suggested that this fiction (Salerno had no university in the 12th century, so there were no professorial chairs for men or women) may have been due to the fact that three years earlier, &quot;Elena Cornaro received a doctorate in philosophy at Padua, the first formal Ph.D. ever awarded to a woman. Mazza, concerned to document the glorious history of his patria, Salerno, may
have been attempting to show that Padua could not claim priority in having produced female professors.&quot;

In 1773 in Jena, C. G. Gruner challenged the idea that the &quot;Trotula&quot; was an ancient text, but he also dismissed the idea that &quot;Trotula&quot; could have been the text&#x27;s author (working with Kraut&#x27;s edition, he, too, thought it was a single text) since she was cited internally. (This is the story of Trota of Salerno&#x27;s cure of the woman with &quot;wind&quot; in the womb in the &quot;De curis mulierum&quot;.) And so the stage was set for debates about &quot;Trotula&quot; in the 19th and 20th centuries. For those who wanted a representative of Salernitan excellence and/or female achievement, &quot;she&quot; could be reclaimed from the humanists&#x27; erasure. For skeptics (and there were many grounds for skepticism), it was easy to find cause for doubt that there was really any female medical authority behind this chaotic text. This was the state of affairs in the 1970s, when second-wave feminism discovered &quot;Trotula&quot; anew. The inclusion of &quot;Trotula&quot; as an invited guest at Judy Chicago&#x27;s feminist art installation, &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; (1974–79), insured that the debate would continue.

===The reclamation of Trota of Salerno in modern scholarship===
From 1544 up through the 1970s, all claims about an alleged author &quot;Trotula,&quot; pro or con, were based on Georg Kraut&#x27;s Renaissance printed text. But that was a fiction, in that it had erased all last signs that the &quot;Trotula&quot; had been compiled out of the works of three different authors. In 1985, California Institute of Technology historian John F. Benton published a study surveying previous thinking on the question of &quot;Trotula&#x27;s&quot; association with the &quot;Trotula&quot; texts. That study was important for three major reasons. (1) Although some previous scholars had noted discrepancies between the printed Renaissance editions of the &quot;Trotula&quot; and the text(s) found in medieval manuscripts, Benton was the first to prove how extensive the Renaissance editor&#x27;s emendations had been. This was not one text, and there was no &quot;one&quot; author. Rather, it was three different texts. (2) Benton dismantled several of the myths about &quot;Trotula&quot; that had been generated by 19th- and early 20th-century scholarship. For example, the epithet &quot;de Ruggiero&quot; attached to her name was sheer invention. Likewise, claims about her date of birth or death, or who &quot;her&quot; husband or sons were had no foundation. (3) Most importantly, Benton announced his discovery of the &quot;Practica secundum Trotam&quot; (&quot;Practical Medicine According to Trota&quot;) in a manuscript now in Madrid, which established the historic Trota of Salerno&#x27;s claim to have existed and been an author.

After Benton&#x27;s death in 1988, Monica H. Green picked up the task of publishing a new translation of the &quot;Trotula&quot; that could be used by students and scholars of the history of medicine and medieval women. However, Benton&#x27;s own discoveries had rendered irrelevant any further reliance on the Renaissance edition, so Green undertook a complete survey of all the extant Latin manuscripts of the &quot;Trotula&quot; and a new edition of the &quot;Trotula&quot; ensemble. Green has disagreed with Benton in his claim that all the &quot;Trotula&quot; treatises were male-authored. Specifically, while Green agrees with Benton that male authorship of the &quot;Conditions of Women&quot; and &quot;Women&#x27;s Cosmetics&quot; is probable, Green has demonstrated that not simply is the &quot;De curis mulierum&quot; (On Treatments for Women) directly attributed to the historic Trota of Salerno in the earliest known version (where it was still circulating independently), but that the text shows clear parallels to passages in other works associated with Trota and suggests strongly an intimate access to the female patient&#x27;s body that, given the cultural restrictions of the time, would have likely only been allowed to a female practitioner.

===&quot;Trotula&#x27;s&quot; fame in popular culture===
Perhaps the best known popularization of &quot;Trotula&quot; was in the artwork &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; (1979) by Judy Chicago, now on permanent exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, which features a place setting for &quot;Trotula.&quot; The depiction here (based on publications prior to Benton&#x27;s discovery of Trota of Salerno in 1985) presents a conflation of alleged biographical details that are no longer accepted by scholars. Chicago&#x27;s celebration of &quot;Trotula&quot; no doubt led to the proliferation of modern websites that mention her, many of which repeat without correction the discarded misunderstandings noted above. A clinic in Vienna and a street in modern Salerno and even a have been named after &quot;Trotula,&quot; all mistakenly perpetuating fictions about &quot;her&quot; derived from popularizing works like that of Chicago. Likewise, medical writers, in trying to indicate the history of women in their field, or the history of certain gynecological conditions, keep recycling outworn understandings of &quot;Trotula&quot; (or even inventing new misunderstandings). Nevertheless, Chicago&#x27;s elevation of both &quot;Trotula&quot; and the real Trota&#x27;s contemporary, the religious and medical writer Hildegard of Bingen, as important medical figures in 12th-century Europe, did flag the importance of how historical remembrances of these women were created. That it took close to twenty years for Benton and Green to extract the historic woman Trota from the composite text of the &quot;Trotula&quot; was a function of the complicated textual tradition and the broad proliferation of the texts in the Middle Ages. That it is taking even longer for popular understandings of Trota and &quot;Trotula&quot; to catch up with this scholarship, has raised the question whether celebrations of Women&#x27;s History ought not include more recognition of the processes by which that record is discovered and assembled.

<doc id="301680" wikidata="Q269687" url="?curid=301680" title="Mechthild of Magdeburg">
<text>Mechthild (or Mechtild, Matilda, Matelda) of Magdeburg (c. 1207 – c. 1282/1294), a Beguine, was a Christian medieval mystic, whose book &quot;Das fließende Licht der Gottheit&quot; (&quot;The Flowing Light of Divinity&quot;) is a compendium of visions, prayers, dialogues and mystical accounts. She was the first mystic to write in Low German.
==Life==
Definite biographical information about Mechthild is scarce; what is known of her life comes largely from scattered hints in her work. She was born into a noble Saxon family. She had her first vision of the Holy Spirit at the age of twelve. In 1230, she left her home and “renounced worldly honour and worldly riches” to become a Beguine at Magdeburg. There, like Hadewijch of Antwerp, she seems to have exercised a position of authority in a Beguine community. In Magdeburg she became acquainted with the Dominicans and became a Dominican tertiary. It seems clear that she read many of the Dominican writers. It was her Dominican confessor, Henry of Halle, who encouraged and helped Mechthild to compose &quot;The Flowing Light&quot;.

Her criticism of church dignitaries and her claims to theological insight aroused so much opposition that some called for the burning of her writings. With advancing age, she was not only isolated and the object of extensive criticism, but she also became blind. Around 1272, she joined the Cistercian nunnery at Helfta which offered her protection and support in the final years of her life. Here, she finished writing down the contents of the many divine revelations she says she experienced. It is unclear whether she actually formally joined the Cistercian community or whether she simply resided there and participated in the religious services without taking Cistercian monastic vows. The nuns of Helfta were highly educated and important works of mysticism survive from Mechthild&#x27;s younger contemporaries, St Mechthild of Hackeborn and St Gertrude the Great.

It is unclear when Mechthild died. 1282 is a commonly cited date, but some scholars believe she lived into the 1290s.

==Composition==
Mechthild&#x27;s book is written in the Middle Low German that was spoken in the region of Magdeburg at the time. It includes phrases in Latin.

==Works==
Mechthild&#x27;s writings comprise the seven books of &quot;Das fließende Licht der Gottheit&quot; (&quot;The Flowing Light of Divinity&quot;), which was composed between 1250 and 1280. There appear to have been three stages in the evolution of the work. The first five books were finished by about 1260. During the next decade Mechthild added a sixth book. After joining the community of Cistercian nuns at Helfta around 1272, she added a seventh book, rather different in tone from the previous six.

&quot;The Flowing Light&quot; was originally written in Middle Low German, the language of northern Germany. While her original composition is now lost, the text survives in two later versions. First, around 1290, Dominican friars of the Halle community translated the first six books into Latin. Then, in the mid-fourteenth century, the secular priest Henry of Nördlingen translated &quot;The Flowing Light&quot; into the Alemannic dialect of Middle High German. This version survives complete in one manuscript and in fragmentary form in three others. The sole surviving copy of &quot;The Flowing Light&quot; is located in the Einsiedeln library in Switzerland and was rediscovered in 1861.

What is unusual about her writings is that she composed her work in Middle Low German at a time when most wisdom literature was composed in Latin. Thus she is remembered as an early proponent and popularizer of German as a language worthy of the divine and holy. Mechthild&#x27;s writing is exuberant and highly sophisticated. Her images of Hell are believed by some scholars to have influenced Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, and Mechthild is thought to have been represented by Dante in that work, in the character of Matelda. However, there is no concrete evidence for this and there are important differences in Dante&#x27;s conception of Hell.

While her work was translated into Latin during her lifetime, it had been largely forgotten by the 15th century. It was rediscovered in the late 19th century by Pater Gall Morel, who published the first edition. Her work has been increasingly studied, both for its academic interest and as a work of devotional literature.

== Remembrance days and artifacts ==

* Catholic: September 16 (venerated as a blessed in the Diocese of Magdeburg), August 15 (according to some sources in the universal Church).
* Evangelical: February 26 (in Calendar of Saints).
* Anglican: November 19 (in Common Worship), May 28 (Episcopal Church).

A sculpture of Mechthild of Magdeburg, The Holy Mechthild von Magdeburg, is on display in the Magdeburg Sculpture Park. It was created by Susan Turcot as part of a project in collaboration with the Art Museum of the Kloster Unser Lieben Frauen. It was installed in the sculpture park in 2010.

== Radio adaptations ==
The Medievalist Hildegard Elisabeth Keller integrated Mechthild von Magdeburg as one of five main female characters in her work &quot;The Trilogy of the Timeless&quot;, published at the end of September 2011. Selected passages have been included in the radio play The Ocean in the Thimble, which she wrote and staged. In the fictional encounter, Mechthild talks to Hildegard von Bingen, Hadewijch and Etty Hillesum.

<doc id="301682" wikidata="Q680007" url="?curid=301682" title="Filiation">
<text>Filiation is the legal term for the recognized legal status of the relationship between family members, or more specifically the legal relationship between parent and child. As described by the Government of Quebec:

Filiation is the relationship which exists between a child and the child’s parents, whether the parents are of the same or the opposite sex. The relationship can be established by blood, by law in certain cases, or by a judgment of adoption. Once filiation has been established, it creates rights and obligations for both the child and the parents, regardless of the circumstances of the child’s birth.

Filiation differs from, but impacts, both parental rights and inheritance.

An example of law regarding filiation is found in the Civil Code of Quebec, Book 2, Title 2 &quot;Filiation&quot;, which details how filiation may be established, claimed, and transferred.

== Filiation and adoption ==

When an adoption takes place under the laws of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom, a complete transfer of filiation takes place. A standard example in U.S. adoption law is seen in the California State Code:

8616. After adoption, the adopted child and the adoptive parents shall sustain towards each other the legal relationship of parent and child and have all the rights and are subject to all the duties of that relationship. 

In other nations, a form of &quot;incomplete adoption&quot; may allow filiation with the biological family to remain. An example of this is in French law, where two types of adoption exist: &quot;adoption plénière&quot;, where filiation is completely transferred, and adoption simple in which filiation to the adopting parents is added to, but does not replace, filiation with the biological family.

The legal transfer of filiation is evident in cases where adult adoptees have legally terminated their adoptions, resulting in filiation restored to their biological families. One example of this is the Satnam Parmar Adoption Termination Act (1990) that was passed in the provincial legislature of Alberta, Canada. Parts 2 and 3 of this Act state:

2 Satnam Parmar is hereby declared not to be the lawful child and heir of either Swarn Singh Parmar or Amarjit Parmar, and not to have any rights of inheritance from Swarn Singh Parmar or Amarjit Parmar that might otherwise devolve on him by law.
3 The filial relationship which existed between Satnam Parmar and his natural parents, Balbhadar Singh Parmar and Charan Kaur Parmar, prior to the Adoption Order, is hereby restored.

Another instance involving the legal transfer of filiation in adoption occurs in cases where adult adoptees and their biological families restore their original filiation via adult adoption.

<doc id="301685" wikidata="Q345182" url="?curid=301685" title="Elijah Muhammad">
<text>Elijah Muhammad (born Elijah Robert Poole; October 7, 1897 – February 25, 1975) was an American religious leader, black separatist, and self-proclaimed Messenger of Allah who led the Nation of Islam (NOI) from 1933 until his death in 1975. Elijah Muhammad was also the teacher and mentor of Malcolm X, Louis Farrakhan, Muhammad Ali, and his son, Warith Deen Mohammed.

In the 1930s, Muhammad formally established the Nation of Islam, a religious movement that originated under the leadership and teachings of Wallace Fard Muhammad and that promoted black power, pride, economic empowerment, and racial separation. Elijah Muhammad taught that Master Fard Muhammad is the &#x27;Son of Man&#x27; of the Bible, and after Fard&#x27;s disappearance in 1934, Muhammad assumed control over Fard&#x27;s former ministry, formally changing its name to the &quot;Nation of Islam&quot;.

Under Muhammad&#x27;s leadership the group grew from a small, local black congregation into an influential nationwide movement. He was unique in his combination of black nationalism with traditional Islamic themes. He promoted black self-sufficiency and self-reliance over integration, and he encouraged African Americans to create a separate state of their own. Muhammad also rejected the civil rights movement for its emphasis on integration, instead promoting a separate black community.

His views on race and his call for blacks having an independent nation for themselves, made him a controversial figure, both within and outside the Nation of Islam. He has been variously described as a black nationalist, a black supremacist, and a religious leader who fought for the rights of African Americans.

Muhammad died on February 25, 1975, after a period of declining health. He was succeeded as head of the NOI by his son, Wallace Muhammad, who renamed the organization as the World Community of al-Islam in the West. Wallace Muhammad later changed his name as part of his own transition to Sunni Islam and is now known as Imam Warith Deen Mohammed.

==Early years and life before Nation of Islam==

Elijah Muhammad was born Elijah Robert Poole in Sandersville, Georgia on October 7 1897, the seventh of thirteen children of William Poole Sr. (1868–1942), a Baptist lay preacher and sharecropper, and Mariah Hall (1873–1958), a homemaker and sharecropper.

Elijah&#x27;s education ended at the fourth grade, after which he went to work in sawmills and brickyards. To support the family, he worked with his parents as a sharecropper. When he was sixteen years old, he left home and began working in factories and at other businesses.

Elijah married Clara Evans (1899–1972) on March 7, 1917. In 1923, the Poole family was among hundreds of thousands of black families forming the First Great Migration leaving the oppressive and economically troubled South in search of safety and employment. Elijah later recounted that before the age of 20, he had witnessed the lynchings of three black men by white people. He said, &quot;I seen enough of the white man&#x27;s brutality to last me 26,000 years&quot;.

Moving his own family, parents and siblings, Elijah and the Pooles settled in the industrial north of Hamtramck, Michigan. Through the 1920s and 1930s, he struggled to find and keep work as the economy suffered during the post World War I and Great Depression eras. During their years in Detroit, Elijah and Clara had eight children, six boys and two girls.

==Conversion and rise to leadership==

While he was in Detroit, Poole began taking part in various black nationalist movements within the city. In August 1931, at the urging of his wife, Elijah Poole attended a speech on Islam and black empowerment by Wallace Fard Muhammad (Wallace D. Fard). Afterward, Poole said he approached Fard and asked if he was the &quot;Mahdi&quot; (redeemer), Fard responded that he was, but that his time had not yet come. Fard taught that black people, as original Asiatics, had a rich cultural history which was stolen from them in their enslavement. Fard stated that African Americans could regain their freedoms through self-independence and cultivation of their own culture and civilization.

Poole, having strong consciousness of both race and class issues as a result of his struggles in the South, quickly fell in step with Fard&#x27;s ideology. Poole soon became an ardent follower of Fard and joined his movement, as did his wife and several brothers. Soon afterward, Poole was given a Muslim surname, first &quot;Karriem&quot;, and later, at Fard&#x27;s behest, &quot;Muhammad&quot;. He assumed leadership of the Nation&#x27;s Temple No. 2 in Chicago. His younger brother Kalot Muhammad became the leader of the movement&#x27;s self-defense arm, the Fruit of Islam.

Fard turned over leadership of the growing Detroit group to Elijah Muhammad, and the Allah Temple of Islam changed its name to the Nation of Islam. Elijah Muhammad and Wallace Fard continued to communicate until 1934, when Wallace Fard disappeared. Elijah Muhammad succeeded him in Detroit and was named &quot;Minister of Islam&quot;. After the disappearance, Elijah Muhammad told followers that Allah had come as Wallace Fard, in the flesh, to share his teachings that are a salvation for his followers.

In 1934, the Nation of Islam published its first newspaper, &quot;Final Call to Islam&quot;, to educate and build membership. Children of its members attended classes at the newly created Muhammad University of Islam, but this soon led to challenges by boards of education in Detroit and Chicago, which considered the children truants from the public school system. The controversy led to the jailing of several University of Islam board members and Elijah Muhammad in 1934 and to violent confrontations with police. Elijah was put on probation, but the university remained open.

==Leadership of the Nation of Islam==
Elijah Muhammad took control of Temple No. 1, but only after battles with other potential leaders, including his brother. In 1935, as these battles became increasingly fierce, Elijah left Detroit and settled his family in Chicago. Still facing death threats, Elijah left his family there and traveled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he founded Temple No. 3, and eventually to Washington, D.C., where he founded Temple No. 4. He spent much of his time reading 104 books suggested by Wallace Fard at the Library of Congress.

On May 8, 1942, Elijah Muhammad was arrested for failure to register for the draft during World War II. After he was released on bail, Muhammad fled Washington, D.C., on the advice of his attorney, who feared a lynching, and returned to Chicago after a seven-year absence. Muhammad was arrested there, charged with eight counts of sedition for instructing his followers to not register for the draft or serve in the armed forces. Acquitted of sedition, but found guilty of draft evasion, Elijah Muhammad served four years in prison, from 1942 to 1946, at the Federal Correctional Institution in Milan, Michigan. During that time, his wife, Clara, and trusted aides ran the organization; Muhammad transmitted his messages and directives to followers in letters.

Following his return to Chicago, Elijah Muhammad was firmly in charge of the Nation of Islam. While Muhammad was in prison, the growth of the Nation of Islam had stagnated, with fewer than 400 members remaining by the time of his release in 1946. However, through the conversion of his fellow inmates as well as renewed efforts outside prison, he was able to redouble his efforts and continue growing the Nation.

Muhammad preached his own version of Islam to his followers in the Nation. According to him, blacks were known as the &quot;original&quot; human beings, with &quot;evil&quot; whites being an offshoot race that would go on to oppress black people for 6,000 years. The origins of the white race would come to be known as Yacub&#x27;s History within Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s teachings. In &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;, Malcolm X talks about when he first encounters this doctrine, though he would later come to regret that he ever believed in it.

He preached that the Nation of Islam&#x27;s goal was to return the stolen hegemony of the inferior whites back to blacks across America. Much of Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s teachings appealed to young, economically disadvantaged, African-American males from Christian backgrounds. Traditionally, black males would not go to church because the church did not address their needs. Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s program for economic development played a large part in the growth in the Nation of Islam. He purchased land and businesses to provide housing and employment for young black males.

By the 1970s, the Nation of Islam owned bakeries, barber shops, coffee shops, grocery stores, laundromats, night-clubs, a printing plant, retail stores, numerous real estate holdings, and a fleet of tractor trailers, plus farmland in Michigan, Alabama, and Georgia. In 1972 the Nation of Islam took controlling interest in a bank, the Guaranty Bank and Trust Co. Nation of Islam-owned schools expanded until, by 1974, the group had established schools in 47 cities throughout the United States. In 1972, Muhammad told followers that the Nation of Islam had a net worth of $75 million.

==Dietary advice==

Muhammad authored a two volume &quot;How to Eat to Live&quot; which promoted pseudoscientific views about diet and nutrition. Muhammad argued that only one meal should be eaten a day at the most and if black people eat only one meal every three days they will never get sick and may possibly live for 1000 years. He argued that eating pork will bring about depraved behaviour and culture of White westerners. According to Muhammad, beef, lamb, and camel were permissible but should be avoided if possible. He stated that &quot;Allah forbids us to eat the flesh of swine or of fish weighing 50 pounds or more&quot;.

In regard to fowl, only baby pigeons were seen as clean and if eaten should be taken straight from the nest. According to Muhammad, peas and sweet potatoes are forbidden by Allah and many foods white in colour are automatically bad for health. Muhammad argued that white people were attempting to destroy black people by weakening their health with inappropriate processed foods such as biscuits and white bread. Muhammad considered most fruits and vegetables safe to eat &quot;except collard greens and turnip salad&quot;. In regard to beans, only navy beans could be eaten. Lima beans were considered a poison which Muhammad believed made black men&#x27;s stomachs explode. Rice and spinach were allowed in moderation. There were no restrictions on garlic, onions or whole wheat bread.

Muhammad stated that he obtained his dietary advice from &quot;God in Person Master Fard Muhammad&quot;.

==Death==
On January 30, 1975, Muhammad entered Mercy Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, suffering from a combination of heart disease, diabetes, bronchitis, and asthma. There, he died of congestive heart failure nearly one month later at the age of 77 on February 25, the day before Saviours&#x27; Day. He was survived by many children, including his two daughters and six sons by his wife, most notably, he was survived by the future Muslim leader Warith Deen Muhammad.

He was buried alongside Clara at Mount Glenwood Memory Gardens South in Glenwood, Illinois.

==Legacy==
During his time as leader of the Nation of Islam, Muhammad had developed the Nation of Islam from a small movement in Detroit to an empire consisting of banks, schools, restaurants, and stores across 46 cities in America. The Nation also owned over 15,000 acres of farmland, their own truck- and air- transport systems, as well as a publishing company that printed the country&#x27;s largest black newspaper.
As a leader, Muhammad served as a mentor to many notable members, including Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali, Louis Farrakhan and his son Warith Deen Mohammed. The Nation of Islam is estimated to have between 20,000 and 50,000 members, and 130 mosques offering numerous social programs.

Upon his death, his son Warith Deen Mohammed succeeded him. Warith disbanded the Nation of Islam in 1976 and founded an orthodox mainstream Islamic organization, that came to be known as the American Society of Muslims. The organization would dissolve, change names and reorganize many times.

In 1977, Louis Farrakhan resigned from Warith Deen&#x27;s reformed organization and reinstituted the original Nation of Islam upon the foundation established by Wallace Fard Muhammad and Elijah Muhammad. Farrakhan regained many of the Nation of Islam&#x27;s original properties including the National Headquarters Mosque #2 (Mosque Maryam) and Muhammad University of Islam in Chicago.

==Controversies==
===Rift with Ernest 2X McGee===
Ernest 2X McGee was the first national secretary of the NOI and had been ousted in the late 1950s. McGee went on to form a Sunni Muslim sect and changed his name to Hamaas Abdul Khaalis. Khaalis attracted Lew Alcindor, whom Khaalis renamed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Jabbar donated a house for use as the Hanafi Madh-Hab Center. Khaalis sent letters that were critical of Muhammad and Fard to Muhammad, his ministers, and the media.

The letters stated blacks had been better off &quot;from a psychological point of view&quot; before Fard 
came along because it weaned them from Christianity to a fabricated form of Islam. Both, in his opinion, were bad. His letters also revealed what he knew of Fard, alleging he was John Walker of Gary who had come to America at 27 from Greece, had served prison time for stealing, and raping a 17-year-old girl, and had died in Chicago, Illinois, at 78.

After the letters were sent, seven of Khaalis&#x27; family members were murdered at the Hanafi Madh-Hab Center. Four men from NOI Mosque No. 12 were accused of the crime.

===Rift with Malcolm X===
====Malcolm X&#x27;s public response to the assassination of President Kennedy====
On December1, 1963, when asked for a comment about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X said that it was a case of &quot;&quot;. He added that &quot;chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they&#x27;ve always made me glad.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;in further criticism of Mr. Kennedy, the Muslim leader cited the murders of Patrice Lumumba, Congo leader, of Medgar Evers, civil rights leader, and of the Negro girls bombed earlier this year in a Birmingham, Alabama, church. These, he said, were instances of other &#x27;chickens coming home to roost&#x27;.&quot; The remarks prompted a widespread public outcry. The Nation of Islam, which had sent a message of condolence to the Kennedy family and ordered its ministers not to comment on the assassination, publicly censured their former shining star. MalcolmX retained his post and rank as minister, but was prohibited from public speaking for 90 days.

====Rape of underage girls====
Rumors were circulating that Elijah was conducting extramarital affairs with young Nation secretarieswhich would constitute a serious violation of Nation teachings. After first discounting the rumors, MalcolmX came to believe them after he spoke with Muhammad&#x27;s son Wallace and with the girls making the accusations. Muhammad confirmed the rumors in 1963, attempting to justify his behavior by referring to precedents set by Biblical prophets. Over a series of national TV interviews between 1964 and 1965, MalcolmX provided testimony of his investigation, corroboration, and confirmation by Elijah Muhammed himself of multiple counts of child rape. 

During this investigation, Malcolm X learned that seven of the eight girls had become pregnant by Elijah Muhammed, and publicly shared the information. Malcolm X also spoke of an attempt made to assassinate him, by means of an explosive device discovered in his car, and of death threats he was receiving, which he believed were in response to his exposure of Elijah Muhammad.

====Final schism and murder of Malcolm X====
The extramarital affairs, the suspension, and other factors caused a rift between the two men, with MalcolmX leaving the Nation of Islam in March 1964 to form his own religious organization, Muslim Mosque Inc. After dealing with death threats and attempts on his life for a year, MalcolmX was assassinated on February21, 1965. Many people suspected that the Nation of Islam was responsible for the killing of Malcolm X. Five days after Malcolm X was murdered, in a public speech at the Nation of Islam&#x27;s annual Saviours&#x27; Day on February 26, Elijah justified the assassination by quoting that &quot;Malcolm got just what he preached&quot;, but at the same time denied any involvement with the murder by asserting in the same speech: &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to kill Malcolm and didn&#x27;t try to kill him. We know such ignorant, foolish teaching would bring him to his own end.&quot;

===Cooperation with white supremacists===
Elijah&#x27;s pro-separation views were compatible with those of some white supremacist organizations in the 1960s. He met with leaders of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in 1961 to work toward the purchase of farmland in the Deep South. For more than ten years Elijah received major financial support from white supremacist Texas oil baron H. L. Hunt due to Elijah&#x27;s belief in racial separation from whites. The money helped Elijah to acquire opulent homes for himself and his family and establish overseas bank accounts.

He eventually established Temple Farms, now Muhammad Farms, on a tract in Terrell County, Georgia. George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party, once called Elijah &quot;the Hitler of the black man.&quot; At the 1962 Saviours&#x27; Day celebration in Chicago, Rockwell addressed Nation of Islam members. Many in the audience booed and heckled him and his men, for which Elijah rebuked them in the April 1962 issue of &quot;Muhammad Speaks&quot;.

==Personal life==
Elijah married Clara Muhammad in Georgia in 1917, and he had eight children with her. He also fathered at least nine children from extra-marital relationships. In total, it is estimated that he had 23 children, of whom 21 are documented.

After Elijah&#x27;s death, nineteen of his children filed lawsuits against the Nation of Islam&#x27;s successor, the World Community of Islam, seeking status as his heirs. Ultimately, the court ruled against them.

Children via his wife, Clara Muhammad:
Two daughters and six sons including notable:
* Jabir Herbert Muhammad (1929–2008)
* Wallace Delaney Muhammad, later known as Warith Deen Mohammed (1933–2008)
* Akbar Muhammad (1939–2016)

Children via mistresses:
* Lucille Rosary Karriem Muhammad: three daughters
* June Muhammad: one son including notable: Abdullah Muhammad and one daughter
* Evelyn Williams: one daughter
* Ola (Hughes) Muhammad: one son
* Tynnetta Muhammad: three sons and a daughter, including notable: 
**Ishmael Muhammad
* Lovetta Muhammad: one daughter
* Bernique Cushmeer: one son

==Honors==
In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Elijah Muhammad on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.

==Portrayals on screen==
Elijah Muhammad was portrayed by Al Freeman Jr. in Spike Lee&#x27;s 1992 motion picture &quot;Malcolm X&quot;. Albert Hall, who played the composite character &quot;Baines&quot; in &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, later played Muhammad in Michael Mann&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Ali&quot;. He was also portrayed by Clifton Davis in the series &quot;Godfather of Harlem&quot;. He was most recently portrayed by Ron Cephas Jones in the Drama Biography by National Geographic &quot;&quot;.

<text>Jeremy David Hounsell Dammers GCOT (born 22 May 1955) is a British musician who was a founder, keyboard player and primary songwriter of the Coventry-based ska band the Specials (also known as the Special A.K.A.) and later the Spatial AKA Orchestra. Through his foundation of the record label Two Tone, his work blending political lyrics and punk with Jamaican music, and his incorporation of 1960s retro clothing, Dammers is a pivotal figure of the ska revival. He has also been acknowledged in his work for racial unity.

==Biography==
Dammers was born 22 May 1955 in Ootacamund, Tamil Nadu, South India, the son of Horace Dammers who was later Dean of Bristol Cathedral from 1973 to 1987. Jerry Dammers attended King Henry VIII School, Coventry.

He left India at the age of 2, first living in Sheffield, then moving to Coventry at the age of 10. His initial music influences were &#x27;60s bands like the Who, the Small Faces and the Kinks, which made him want to be in a band, and he was also influenced by soul music.

Dammers was a young mod in the 1960s while at school then became a hippie, before becoming a skinhead. Dammers decided at the age of 10 he was going to have a band, and spent his teenage years learning music and writing songs. He played in a range of bands, from reggae punk, to country and western. Dammers had been a member of the Cissy Stone Soul Band, however he could not get them to play any of his work. He studied art at Coventry&#x27;s Lanchester Polytechnic (now Coventry University), where he met Horace Panter. Frustrated at only doing covers, Dammers was asked to leave the Cissy Stone Soul band, and then played keyboards with Hard Top 22, a reggae band that had many members who would later become the Selecter.

As a young lad, Dammers got thrown over the handlebars of his pushbike. This accident left him without his front teeth and his distinctive trade mark gappy smile.

=== The Specials ===
Dammers was one of the founding members of ska revivalist band the Specials. Prior to the Specials, Dammers had played with Neol Davies and other reggae musicians who would later form the Selecter. He had written songs in his teens, and his idea in forming the Specials was that it would combine reggae and punk. He formed the band, initially called the Coventry Automatics, with vocalist Tim Strickland, guitarist/vocalist Lynval Golding, drummer Silverton Hutchinson, and bassist Horace Panter in 1977. He then asked Terry Hall to join. Hall was performing vocals with Squad and Roddy Radiation, both of whom were part of the local Coventry punk scene. Dammers has said that anti-racism was a key element of the band, and the Rock Against Racism movement was formed at the same time. He also saw the Specials as an opportunity to integrate white and black people through the same music, and he picked members to make the band multi-racial. Until this time, white British people mainly played rock, blues and jazz, while black British people played reggae, jazz, and soul. The Specials was an opportunity to have black and white people in the same band, something not common at the time, through playing ska.

GQ editor Dylan Jones noted that the Specials differed from other ska bands at the time because of Dammers’ political messages in the Specials&#x27; lyrics. After talking their way onto a tour with the Clash, then a better-known group, Dammers pushed the Specials to adopt the mod/rude boy fashion sub-culture, and this look was copied by fans of the band.

They released their eponymous first album, &quot;The Specials&quot;, which was successful, and then their second album, &quot;More Specials&quot;, which was less so.

After some issues with Roddy Radiation not being able to play, Neville Staple, Terry Hall and Lynval Golding at this point left the band to form Fun Boy Three.

=== The Special AKA and &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot; ===
The band changed its lineup and rebadged as the Special AKA, releasing another album and the single &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot;. Dammers then dissolved the band. &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot; had a role in the downfall of apartheid, as it raised awareness of the issue, and became an anthem of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. &quot;The Guardian&quot; referred to it as &quot;one of the most effective protest songs in history.&quot;

Dammers at times attempted to rejoin the re-formed Specials, but in 2008 he stated that things had not worked out, and his attempts were not welcome.

=== 2 Tone Records ===
He founded 2 Tone Records, as a ska version of the Motown label, the main label that kick started the ska revival of the late 1970s/1980s. Dammers got graphic artists to produce specific art for the label, including the iconic man in the suit graphic, which was based on a photo of reggae musician Peter Tosh. The label was a sub-label of Chrysalis Records, but still independent. The era saw a lot of racism, and 2 Tone Records was a bulwark against that, celebrating racial unity and combating the rise of the National Front. The whole two-tone scene took off, and the label released early singles that would end up becoming major hits for bands including Madness, the Beat and the Selecter. The Selecter left the label, and Dammers strayed from the ska influence to bring jazz influences, most particularly on the album &quot;More Specials&quot; However, by 1984 the Special AKA were the main artist on the label, and Dammers was the only original member left. Dammers almost destroyed the label through the cost of the release of the Special AKA album, but was saved when the single &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot; became huge internationally, while also bringing enough light onto apartheid that it was a factor in the end of the regime. He got into a lot of debt, and towards the end of the label he had to stop recording because of a lack of funds. Dammers finally shut down the label in 1985, seven years after it was founded, though the message of racial unity imparted to its many followers had a positive effect on society.

Dammers&#x27; founding of 2 Tone Records, which launched Madness, the Specials, the Bodysnatchers, the Beat and the Selecter among others, his push for the punk ska cross genre of music that the Specials had played, and his suggestions for the adoption of retro 1960s mod/rude boy clothes were a key element in starting the ska revival of the late 1970s and the two tone ska/punk sound specifically.

=== After Two Tone ===
He became an anti-apartheid campaigner, helping to create Artists Against Apartheid in the US, and writing the song &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot; about the jailed African National Congress leader in South Africa. In 1985, in the wake of the Band Aid single, he organised the recording and release of the &quot;Starvation&quot; single, a version of the Pioneers&#x27; 1969 song, in aid of famine relief in Africa, featuring members of the Special AKA, UB40, Madness, the Pioneers, and the Beat.

In early 1986, Dammers took part in the Billy Bragg-fronted Red Wedge tour that also featured the Style Council, the Communards, and Junior Giscombe. He also introduced Simple Minds to producer Tony Hollingsworth and they became the first major act to agree to perform at the Anti-Apartheid Movement&#x27;s Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert, which Hollingsworth was contracted to produce, which was broadcast worldwide from London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium, on 11 June 1988. That same year, he briefly played with the re-formed Madness on their single &quot;I Pronounce You&quot; and its attendant album, &quot;The Madness&quot;.

=== Spatial AKA Orchestra ===
In 2006, Dammers started his new band, the Spatial AKA Orchestra, playing his own compositions and tributes to Sun Ra and other experimental jazz artists. The band generally features up to 20 musicians on stage, with Dammers asking various people to join, including established jazz musicians Zoe Rahman, Larry Stabbins and Denys Baptiste. They perform in elaborate Ancient Egyptian and outer space-themed costumes, and share the stage with bizarre props such as model alien heads and mummy sarcophagi. Trombonist Rico Rodriguez also featured in a number of shows. The band plays new material, as well as some of Dammers&#x27; Specials songs.

=== Work with other artists and solo work ===
In November 2006, Dammers was awarded an honorary degree from Coventry University, celebrating by DJing at the launch party of the Coventry branch of the Love Music Hate Racism organisation. In the same month, he attended a private viewing of a Harry Pye curated art exhibition in east London that featured paintings of bands and singers that had once been championed by the late BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. Dammers read out a four-page poem, in which he thanked Peel for helping his own band, and for supporting black musicians.

Carl Barât of the Libertines included a Dammers composition, &quot;Too Much Too Young&quot;, on his personal compilation album &quot;Under the Influence&quot;. Pete Doherty, former member of the Libertines, namechecked &quot;What I Like Most About You Is Your Girlfriend&quot; on &quot;Down in Albion&quot;, the first Babyshambles album. The song &quot;Merry Go Round&quot; contains the lyrics &quot;He says, &#x27;What I like most about you, Pete/Is your girlfriend and your shoes.&#x27;&quot; Those who have recorded songs written by Dammers include Tricky (&quot;Ghost Town&quot;), the Prodigy (&quot;Ghost Town&quot;) and Elvis Costello (&quot;What I Like Most About You Is Your Girlfriend&quot;).

Dammers has produced singles for Robert Wyatt, the Untouchables, UB40 and Junior Delgado. He contributed &quot;Riot City&quot; to the soundtrack of the Julien Temple film, &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;, and &quot;Brightlights&quot; to the compilation album &quot;Jamming: A New Optimism&quot;.

Dammers still regularly DJs in English nightclubs.

=== Awards ===
Dammers has been recognised widely by his peers and music critics for his role in making ska music popular in the 1980s, his creation of ska/punk fusion, and for his role in race relations and the anti apartheid movement. &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine referred to him as &quot;The Ska Punk Wizard&quot;, while the Clash&#x27;s lead singer, Joe Strummer, referred to him as the Tzar of Ska. &quot;GQ&quot; magazine referred to Dammers as the Paul McCartney/John Lennon of Ska.

Tambo in silver award, a national honour, for his role in the anti-apartheid movement (received In April 2014, Dammers received). &quot;It feels fantastic.

<text>Rochford is a town and civil parish in the Rochford District in Essex, England, north of Southend-on-Sea, from London and from Chelmsford. At the 2011 census, the civil parish had a population of 8,471.

==History==
The town is the main settlement in the Rochford district, and takes its name from Rochefort, Old English for &quot;Ford of the Hunting Dogs&quot;. The town runs into suburban developments in the parishes of Ashingdon and Hawkwell. Kings Hill, in Rochford, was notable for containing the Lawless Court up until the 19th century.

===Peculiar People===
In 1837 James Banyard (14 November 1800 – 1863) (a reformed drunk and Wesleyan preacher) and William Bridges (1802–1874) took a lease on the old workhouse at Rochford, which became the first chapel of the Peculiar People, a name taken from Deuteronomy 14:2 and 1 Peter 2:9. The Peculiar People practised a lively form of worship bound by the literal interpretation of the King James Bible, banning both frivolity and medicine. During the two World Wars some were conscientious objectors, believing that war is contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ. The Peculiar People are nowadays known as the Union of Evangelical Churches.

===First World War===
Nearby Southend Airport started life as a grass fighter station in World War I. The site was founded in the autumn of 1914 when farmland between Westbarrow Hall and the Great Eastern Railway line at Warners Bridge north of Southend Pier was acquired for RFC training purposes. Training continued until May 1915 when the site, known also as Eastwood, was taken over by the RNAS to become a Station (night) in the fight against intruding Zeppelins.

===Second World War===
Southend Airport was opened on the site on 18 September 1935. As World War II approached it was requisitioned by the Air Ministry in August 1939 for use as a fighter airfield by No.11 Group RAF. RAF Rochford was a satellite station for RAF Hornchurch and was primarily a fighter base, home mainly to Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane aircraft. Rochford airfield was accompanied by a radar base in Canewdon (around away). RAF Rochford was bombed a number of times during the war.

It was returned to civilian service on 31 December 1946.

==Geography==

The town is just to the north of Southend-on-Sea, and is separated from both Southend and Rayleigh.

==Governance==
The Member of Parliament for Rochford and Southend East is Bayo Alaba (Labour). An electoral ward in the same name exists. At the 2011 Census this ward had a population of 7,695. The Area of Rochford District (inc. Rayleigh, Hockley, Hawkwell) is also represented in Parliament and the Member of Parliament for Rayleigh and Wickford is Mark Gino Francois (Conservative).

==Landmarks==

Rochford Hall is privately owned by Rochford Hundred Golf Club. The Corn Exchange, now home to the local branch of the Women&#x27;s Institute, was completed in 1866.

==Leisure==
Clements Hall Leisure Centre is managed by Fusion Lifestyle, for Rochford District Council.

The Roach Valley Way is a 23-mile (37 km) circular path centred on Rochford and the River Crouch and River Roach estuaries.

==Sport==
Rochford Hundred Rugby Club was formed in 1962 and as of 2019 play in London &amp; South East Premier—level 5 of the English rugby union system.

Rochford Town Football Club are a non-league side who play in the second division of the Essex Olympian Football League.

Rankin&#x27;s Cricket Club was established in 1881 and play in the T Rippon Mid Essex League.

==Transport==

Trains run from Rochford railway station eastbound to Southend Victoria and westbound to Liverpool Street station in the business district of central London. Southend Airport railway station, which is sited on the eastern boundary of the airport, opened on 18 July 2011.

Rochford has bus links to the surrounding towns; routes 7, 8 and 9 travel to Rayleigh and Southend-on-Sea.

There are over twenty scheduled flight destinations within Europe available from London Southend Airport.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sudbury TV transmitter and the local relay TV transmitter. BBC London and ITV London can also be received from the Crystal Palace TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Essex on 95.3 FM, Heart East on 97.5 FM and Radio Essex on 105.1 FM. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, Southend Echo.

==Rochford Hospital==
Rochford Hospital used to be primarily the district maternity hospital. It was here, in 1956, that Sister J Ward made observations that led to the development of phototherapy for newborns suffering from jaundice. Much of the site was redeveloped and turned over to housing use once the decision was made to transfer the majority of services to Southend Hospital in 1990, with only the Acute Adult Inpatient Service remaining on part of the former site.

==Churches==
===St Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church===

The ancient Church of England parish church is St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Rochford, close to Rochford Hall, and is part of Rochford Deanery, within the Bradwell Area of the Diocese of Chelmsford. It is thought to have originated in Anglo-Saxon times, but the current church building dates from the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. It is a Grade II* listed building.

===Free churches===
Rochford Congregational Church has been part of the local community since 1750. The Congregational Church also established the first Dissenting School in the area; When others were afraid of educating the children of the lower classes because they might prove a danger to the state, the church ensured that ordinary people had &quot;a plain and useful education.&quot; 

Rochford Methodist Church, near the White Horse Public House. The Methodists have been in Rochford since 1822, originally meeting in a building where Market Alley turns into the Square. In 1841 they moved to a new building in North Street near Weir Pond Road, and in 1880 they moved to their current premises.

Rochford Community Church was founded in 1987 and meets at The Freight House near the railway station.

===Catholic church===
There is a Roman Catholic church in Ashington Road, Rochford, dedicated to St Teresa of the child Jesus. It was founded in 1953; the present church building opened in 1977.

<doc id="301690" wikidata="Q1728388" url="?curid=301690" title="Terry Hall (singer)">
<text>Terence Edward Hall (19 March 1959 – 18 December 2022) was a British musician who came to prominence as the lead singer of the 2-tone band the Specials, and later recorded with groups such as Fun Boy Three, the Colourfield, Terry, Blair &amp; Anouchka, and Vegas.

Hall released two solo studio albums and also collaborated with many artists including David Stewart, Bananarama, the Lightning Seeds, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Stephen Duffy, Dub Pistols, Gorillaz, Damon Albarn, D12, Tricky, Lily Allen and Shakespears Sister.

==Early life==
Terence Edward Hall was born on 19 March 1959 in Coventry, England, where he was also raised. He had a German-Jewish grandfather, and said of his heritage, &quot;I grew up in an environment where you didn&#x27;t really know where you were from. Coventry was built on immigrants because it was an industrial city looking for cheap labour. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an accident that a group like the Specials came out of that&quot;.

Hall was abducted by a paedophile ring on a trip to France at the age of 12. He wrote about it in an autobiographical song &quot;Well Fancy That!&quot; on the Fun Boy Three&#x27;s second album. He suffered from depression afterwards, ultimately leaving school before his fifteenth birthday, taking various short-term jobs, such as a bricklayer, quantity surveyor, and apprentice hairdresser.

==Career==
===Early years===
Hall became an active member of the burgeoning Coventry music scene of the late 1970s, playing in a local punk band called Squad and being credited as a composer on their &quot;Red Alert&quot; single.

===The Specials===

Initially the frontman of &#x27;the Coventry Automatics&#x27; in 1977–78, which became the Specials in early 1979, Hall first came to prominence in the UK in 1979 when BBC Radio 1 disc jockey (DJ) John Peel played their debut single &quot;Gangsters&quot; on his show. The band then went on to release their debut studio album, &quot;The Specials&quot;, which also contained the hits &quot;A Message to You Rudy&quot; and &quot;Too Much Too Young&quot;. In October 1980 the group released their second studio album, &quot;More Specials&quot;, which contained three more hit singles: &quot;Do Nothing&quot;, &quot;Stereotype&quot; and &quot;Rat Race&quot;.

The single &quot;Ghost Town&quot;, released in June 1981, spent three weeks at number one and ten weeks in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. The double A-side song, &quot;Friday Night Saturday Morning&quot;, penned by Hall, described a night out at the Coventry Locarno.

===Fun Boy Three===

After the Specials&#x27; single &quot;Ghost Town&quot; was released, Hall left the band to start a new group called Fun Boy Three with two of his Specials bandmates, Lynval Golding and Neville Staple. Fun Boy Three&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;The Lunatics (Have Taken Over the Asylum),&quot; was released in 1981 and was followed-up in 1982 with &quot;It Ain&#x27;t What You Do (It&#x27;s the Way That You Do It),&quot; a duet with Bananarama. Fun Boy Three then provided guest vocals for Bananarama&#x27;s single, &quot;Really Saying Something.&quot; In the same year, Hall and his bandmates appeared in the music video for &quot;Driving in My Car&quot; by Madness and released their debut studio album, &quot;Fun Boy Three&quot;, which reached No. 7 in the UK Albums Chart. In February 1983, Fun Boy Three released their second studio album, &quot;Waiting&quot;, which contained two Top Ten hits: &quot;The Tunnel of Love&quot; and &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;. The latter was a song Hall had written with Jane Wiedlin, who had already had success in the US with a version of the song by her group the Go-Go&#x27;s.

===The Colourfield===

Hall formed the Colourfield in 1984. The band released the 1985 studio album &quot;Virgins and Philistines&quot;, which included the hit single &quot;Thinking of You&quot;. The album spent seven weeks in the UK chart, peaking at No. 12. This new musical direction would culminate in collaborations with Ian Broudie and Hall contributing a number of songs to Broudie&#x27;s albums as the Lightning Seeds. Hall also co-wrote the song &quot;Smoke Ring&quot; for Broudie&#x27;s debut solo studio album &quot;Tales Told&quot;. The song was also released as the lead track on the &quot;Smoke Rings&quot; EP. A second Colourfield studio album, &quot;Deception&quot;, was released in 1987, reaching No. 95 on the UK Albums Chart.

===Terry, Blair &amp; Anouchka===

Hall teamed up with American actress Blair Booth and jeweller Anouchka Grose and began recording under the moniker of Terry, Blair &amp; Anouchka in 1989. After two singles which both scraped into the top 80 of the UK Singles Chart, the trio released their debut studio album &quot;Ultra Modern Nursery Rhymes&quot;, which failed to chart.

===Vegas===

Hall joined forces with Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics in 1992. The duo formed a band called Vegas and released &quot;Vegas&quot;, a slick electronic pop album that was heavily promoted by their label BMG. It failed to chart. Only one of the three singles lifted from the album, &quot;Possessed&quot;, managed to break the UK top 40, reaching No. 32.

===Solo===
Hall began his formal solo career in 1994 with &quot;Home&quot;. The album was produced by his former collaborator Ian Broudie of the Lightning Seeds; it reached No. 95 on the UK Albums Chart. The album also featured ex-Echo &amp; the Bunnymen bassist Les Pattinson. The highlight of the album was the single &quot;Sense&quot;, which reached No. 54 on the UK Singles Chart. The following year, Hall released the &quot;Rainbows&quot; EP in collaboration with Damon Albarn of Blur and it climbed to No. 62 on the UK Singles Chart.

Hall followed up his debut studio album with &quot;Laugh&quot; in 1997. It remains his most successful solo album, reaching No. 50 on the UK Albums Chart. The album contains the top 50 UK single, &quot;Ballad of a Landlord&quot;. Both albums featured long-time collaborator Craig Gannon.

===Hall and Mushtaq===
Hall collaborated with Mushtaq of Fun-Da-Mental on the 2003 studio album &quot;The Hour of Two Lights&quot; which contains contributions from Blur&#x27;s Damon Albarn, a twelve-year-old Lebanese girl singer, a blind Algerian rapper, a Syrian flautist, Hebrew vocalists, and a group of Polish gypsies.

===Later years===
Hall appeared as a guest on the Gorillaz and D12 collaboration single &quot;911&quot;, a 2001 song about terrorist attacks in the US. Hall sings the chorus along with Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn, while D12 rap their verses. Hall guested on the song &quot;Never Alone&quot;, which appeared on the 2003 Junkie XL studio album &quot;Radio JXL: A Broadcast from the Computer Hell Cabin&quot;.

Hall was featured on the studio album &quot;True Love&quot; by Toots and the Maytals. The album won the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album and showcased many notable musicians.

Hall provided vocals for several tracks on the Dub Pistols&#x27; 2007 studio album &quot;Speakers and Tweeters&quot;, after appearing on the band&#x27;s song &quot;Problem Is&quot; from the studio album &quot;Six Million Ways to Live&quot;. Hall also appeared live at the Glastonbury Festival on the Pyramid Stage with Lily Allen and his former Specials bandmate Lynval Golding. He also played on the Park Stage, once again with Golding and also Damon Albarn and beatboxer Shlomo, playing a version of the Specials&#x27; &quot;A Message to You Rudy&quot;. Later that year, he appeared at GuilFest on the BBC Radio 2 Stage, once again with the Dub Pistols and Golding.

===The Specials reunion===

Hall contacted his former Specials bandmates with the prospect of a reunion. He announced that the Specials would be reforming for tour dates and possibly recordings on 30 March 2008. Six members of the band performed on the Main Stage at Bestival as the surprise act on 6 September 2008. The Specials&#x27; original keyboardist and primary composer Jerry Dammers did not play at the festival and owns the trademark rights to the name &quot;the Specials,&quot; so the group was billed as &quot;Very &#x27;Special&#x27; Guests&quot;. The Specials announced 2009 tour dates to celebrate their 30th anniversary on 2 December 2008. Dammers did not join the band on the tour, although relations between the two parties were reportedly strong. Hall was quoted as saying &quot;the door remains open to him&quot;. Hall was still performing with the Specials in 2018, including a concert with the Rolling Stones, along with his original band members Lynval Golding and Horace Panter, and often DJed in various UK venues.

The Specials released a new studio album entitled &quot;Encore&quot; on 1 February 2019. Upon release it went straight to the number one spot on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the highest-charting album ever released by the Specials.

==Personal life and death==
Hall had a brief romantic relationship with Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go&#x27;s in 1980. They co-wrote the song &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;. Hall had two sons with his first wife, Jeanette Hall, including the DJ Felix Hall, and another son with his second wife, Lindy Heymann.

Hall said that he suffered from lifelong depression after being abducted and sexually abused at the age of 12. He later became addicted to the Valium he had been prescribed. Following a suicide attempt in 2004, Hall was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Hall died on 18 December 2022 from pancreatic cancer, at the age of 63.

<doc id="301693" wikidata="Q1342427" url="?curid=301693" title="Simon Fraser (explorer)">
<text>Simon Fraser (20 May 1776 – 18 August 1862) was a Canadian explorer and fur trader who charted much of what is now the Canadian province of British Columbia. He also built the first European settlement in British Columbia.

Employed by the Montreal-based North West Company, he had been by 1805 put in charge of all of the company&#x27;s operations west of the Rocky Mountains. He was responsible for building that area&#x27;s first trading posts, and in 1808, he explored what is now known as the Fraser River, which bears his name. Fraser&#x27;s exploratory efforts were partly responsible for Canada&#x27;s boundary later being established at the 49th parallel (after the War of 1812) since he, as a British subject, was the first European to establish permanent settlements in the area. According to the historian Alexander Begg, Fraser &quot;was offered a knighthood but declined the title due to his limited wealth.&quot;

==Early life==
Fraser was born on 20 May 1776 in the village of Mapletown, Hoosick, New York. He was the eighth and youngest child of Captain Simon Fraser (d.1779), of the 84th Highland Regiment, and Isabella Grant, daughter of the Laird of Daldregan. Captain Simon Fraser grew up at his family&#x27;s seat, Guisachan (Scottish Gaelic: &#x27;Giùthsachan&#x27;), as the second son of William Fraser (d.1755), 8th Laird of Guisachan and 3rd Laird of Culbokie, by his wife, Catherine, daughter of John McDonell, 4th Laird of Ardnabie. The Frasers of Guisachan and Culbokie were descended from a younger brother of the 10th Chief of the Frasers of Lovat.

Simon&#x27;s father came with his regiment to North America in 1773 and died in prison after being captured during the Battle of Bennington (1777). After the war ended, Simon&#x27;s mother was assisted by her brother-in-law, Captain John Fraser, who had been appointed Chief Justice of the Montreal district.

==Fur trade==
In 1789 at the age of 14, Fraser moved to Montreal for additional schooling, where two of his uncles were active in the fur trade, in which his kinsman, Simon McTavish, was the undisputed leading figure. In 1790, he was apprenticed to the North West Company.

==Exploration west of the Rockies==
In 1789, the North West Company had commissioned Alexander Mackenzie to find a navigable river route to the Pacific Ocean. The route he discovered in 1793 — ascending the West Road River and descending the Bella Coola River — opened up new sources of fur but proved to be too difficult to be practicable as a trading route to the Pacific. Fraser was given responsibility for extending operations to the country west of the Rockies in 1805. Mackenzie’s expeditions had been primarily reconnaissance trips, while Fraser’s assignment, by contrast, reflected a definite decision to build trading posts and take possession of the country, as well as to explore travel routes.

===Ascending the Peace River and establishing posts===
In the autumn of 1805, Fraser began ascending the Peace River, establishing the trading post of Rocky Mountain Portage House (present-day Hudson&#x27;s Hope) just east of the Peace River Canyon of the Rocky Mountains. That winter Fraser and his crew pushed through the mountains and ascended the Parsnip and Pack Rivers, establishing Trout Lake Fort (later renamed Fort McLeod) at present-day McLeod Lake. This was the first permanent European settlement west of the Rockies in present-day Canada. The name given by Fraser to this territory was New Caledonia in honor of his ancestral homeland of Scotland. Further explorations by Fraser&#x27;s assistant James McDougall resulted in the discovery of Carrier Lake, now known as Stuart Lake. In the heart of territory inhabited by the aboriginal Carrier or Dakelh nation, this area proved to be a lucrative locale for fur trading and so a post, Fort St. James, was built on its shore in 1806. From here, Fraser sent another assistant, John Stuart, west to Fraser Lake. Later, the two men would build another post there which is now known as Fort Fraser. Fraser later sent the expedition&#x27;s logbook keeper, Jules-Maurice Quesnel, up the river at the forks to see what was there and ended up naming the Quesnel River and the Quesnel Lake after him.

===Delays and the founding of Fort George (Prince George)===
Fraser had found out from the Indigenous people that the Fraser River, the route by which Mackenzie had ascended the West Road River, could be reached by descending the Stuart River, which drained Stuart Lake, and then descending the Nechako River to its confluence with the Fraser. It had been Fraser&#x27;s plan to navigate the length of the river which now bears his name. Fraser and others believed that it was, in fact, the Columbia River, the mouth of which had been explored in 1792 by Robert Gray.

Unfortunately, Fraser&#x27;s plan to begin the journey in 1806 had to be abandoned because of a lack of men and supplies, as well as the occurrence of local famine. Fraser would not be resupplied until the autumn of 1807 and so his journey could not be undertaken until the following spring. In the interval, Fraser contented himself with a journey to the confluence of the Nechako and Fraser Rivers. There he established a new post named Fort George (now known as Prince George), which would become the starting point for his trip downstream.

===Descending the Fraser River===
From the outset, the aboriginal inhabitants warned Fraser that the river below was nearly impassable. A party of twenty-four left Fort George in four canoes on May 28, 1808. They passed the West Road River where Mackenzie had turned west and on the first of June ran the rapids of the Cottonwood Canyon where a canoe became stranded and had to be pulled out of the canyon with a rope. They procured horses from the Indigenous peoples to help with the portages, but the carrying-places were scarcely safer than the rapids. They passed the mouth of the Chilcotin River on the 5th and entered a &quot;rapid couvert&quot; where the river was completely enclosed by cliffs. The next day the river was found to be completely impassable. The canoes and superfluous goods were cached and on the 11th the party set out on foot, each man carrying about 80 pounds. On the 14th they reached a large village, possibly near Lillooet where they were able to trade for two canoes. On the 19th, they reached a village at the mouth of the Thompson River, where they obtained canoes for the rest of the party. After more rapids and portages and losing one canoe but no men, they reached North Bend where they again had to abandon their canoes. In places, they used an aboriginal path that had been made by poles set on the side of the gorge (probably somewhere near Hells Gate). On the 28th, they left the Fraser Canyon near Yale where the river becomes navigable. Escorted by friendly Indigenous people and well-fed on salmon, they reached the sea on the second of July. Fraser took the latitude as 49°. Since he knew that the mouth of the Columbia was at 46°, the river that he was following was clearly not the Columbia.

Fraser proved adept at establishing friendly relations with the tribes he met and was careful to have them send word to tribes downstream of his impending arrival and good intentions. For the most part, this tactic was effective, but Fraser encountered a hostile reception by the Musqueam people as he approached the lower reaches of the river at present-day Vancouver. Their hostile pursuit of Fraser and his men prevented him from getting more than a glimpse of the Strait of Georgia on July 2, 1808. A dispute with the neighboring Kwantlen people led to a pursuit of Fraser and his men that was not broken off until near present-day Hope.

Returning to Fort George proved to be an even more perilous exercise, as the hostility that Fraser and his crew encountered from the aboriginal communities near the mouth of the river spread upstream. The ongoing hostility and threats to the lives of the Europeans resulted in a near mutiny by Fraser&#x27;s crew, who wanted to escape overland. Quelling the revolt, Fraser and his men continued north upstream from present-day Yale, arriving in Fort George on August 6, 1808. The journey upstream took thirty-seven days. In total it took Fraser and his crew months to travel from Fort George to Musqueam and back.

==Fraser and the Battle of Seven Oaks==
Fraser was just thirty-two years old when he completed the establishment of a permanent European settlement in New Caledonia through the epic journey to the mouth of the river that would one day bear his name. He would go on to spend another eleven years actively engaged in the North West Company&#x27;s fur trade, and was reassigned to the Athabasca Department, where he remained until 1814. For much of this time, he was in charge of the Mackenzie River District. After this, he was assigned to the Red River Valley area, where he was caught up in the conflict between the North West Company and Thomas Douglas, Lord Selkirk, a controlling shareholder of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company who had established the Red River Colony. The conflict culminated in the Battle of Seven Oaks in June 1816, resulting in the death of the colony&#x27;s governor, Robert Semple, and nineteen others. Though not involved in the attack, Fraser
was one of the partners arrested by Lord Selkirk at Fort William. He was taken in September to Montreal, where he was promptly released on bail. Fraser was back at Fort William in 1817 when the North West Company regained possession of the post, but that was evidently his last appearance in the fur trade. The following year, Fraser and five other partners were acquitted of all charges related to the incident in the dead colony.

==Later life==
Fraser settled on land near present-day Cornwall, Ontario, and married Catherine McDonnell on June 2, 1820. He spent the remainder of his life pursuing various enterprises, none with much success. He served as captain of the 1st Regiment of the Stormont Militia during the Rebellions of 1837. According to historian Alexander Begg, Fraser &quot;was offered a knighthood but declined the title due to his limited wealth.&quot;

He had nine children altogether; one died in infancy. Fraser was one of the last surviving partners of the North West Company when he died on August 18, 1862. His wife died the next day, and they were buried in a single grave in the Roman Catholic cemetery at St. Andrew&#x27;s West. Begg quotes Sandford Fleming in an address to the Royal Society of Canada in 1889 as saying that Fraser died poor.

An account of Fraser&#x27;s explorations can be found in his published journals: W. Kaye Lamb, &quot;The Letters and Journals of Simon Fraser, 1806-1808&quot;. Toronto, The MacMillan Company of Canada Limited, 1960.

<text>Yan Song (; 1480–1567), courtesy name Weizhong (惟中), pseudonym Jiexi (介溪), was a Chinese politician and regent of the Ming dynasty. He was notorious for being corrupt and for dominating the Ming government for two decades as Grand Secretary during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Yan Song was born in Fenyi, modern-day Jiangxi province, with ancestral roots in Shaowu. His father, a scholar who had repeatedly failed the imperial examination, while put great effort into educating his son from childhood. A talented scholar, he passed the village examinations at the age of 10, and acquired the &quot;jinshi&quot; degree at the age of 25, being inducted into the imperial secretariat (Hanlin Academy) as an editor.

His early career was quickly cut short by a severe illness which forced Yan Song to return to his hometown, though this proved to be a blessing in disguise, since it kept him away from the imperial court just as it was under the domination of powerful eunuch Liu Jin.

Yan Song returned to Beijing not long after the fall of Liu Jin, returning to work in the Hanlin Academy in both Beijing and auxiliary capital Nanjing.

===Senior Grand Secretary===

Yan Song was the Senior Grand Secretary under the Jiajing Emperor from 1544 to 1545 and from 1548 to 1562. Yan was a close ally of Zhao Wenhua. During his second term as Senior Grand Secretary, he and his son dominated court politics with the tacit consent of the fatuous monarch who shirked his responsibilities as emperor and devoted much of his time to sensual pleasures and Taoist practices. Yan Song&#x27;s wealth is said to have been so great as to have been comparable to that of the emperor. He is also well known for his corruption and had been known to openly sell government positions for cash during the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s reign, but his corruption and treachery created many political opponents. In order to suppress dissent, he had prominent critics such as Yang Jisheng imprisoned and executed. Yan Song was finally disgraced in his later years and died in poverty not long after that, while his son, Yan Shifan, was executed for collaborating with the wokou pirates who invaded Chinese coastal provinces at the time.

He was the subject of the Chinese opera called &quot;Beating Yan Song&quot; (打嚴嵩 Dǎ Yán Sōng).

<doc id="301700" wikidata="Q890211" url="?curid=301700" title="Xu Wei">
<text>Xu Wei (, 1521–1593), also known as Qingteng Shanren (), was a Chinese painter, playwright, poet, and tea master during the Ming dynasty. 

==Life==
Xu&#x27;s courtesy names were Wenqing (文清) and then later Wenchang (文長). His pseudonyms were &quot;The Mountain-man of the Heavenly Pond&quot; (天池山人 Tiānchí Shānrén), &quot;Daoist of the Green Vine House&quot; (青藤道士 Qīngténg Dàoshì) and &quot;The Water and Moon of the Bureau&#x27;s Farm&quot; (署田水月 Shǔtián Shuǐ Yuè). Born in Shanyin (modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), Xu was raised by a single mother who died when he was 14. At 21, he married a woman who died five years later. Though he passed the county civil examination at age 20, Xu was never able to pass the provincial civil service examinations, even after attempting it eight times. Nevertheless, Xu was employed by Hu Zongxian, Supreme Commander of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Fujian coastal defense against the &quot;wokou&quot; pirates.

After General Hu was arrested and lost his job, Xu Wei feared a similar fate for himself. Xu became mentally distraught at this juncture, attempting to commit suicide nine times, such as by axing himself in the skull and drilling both of his ears. His mental imbalance led to his killing of his second wife Zhang (張氏) after becoming paranoid that she was having an affair. As a punishment for this murder, he was jailed for seven years until his friend Zhang Yuanbian (張元忭) from the Hanlin Academy managed to free him at age of 53. It is possible Xu Wei suffered from bipolar disorder, a condition actually recognized in China at this time. Xu spent the rest of his life painting, but with little financial success.

==Literary career==
Xu was a playwright as well. He produced the works Singing in Place of Screaming (), as well as the treatise on southern drama Nanci Xulu (). 

He wrote the four play cycle known as &quot;Four Cries of a Gibbon&quot; (). This cycle consists of the following four plays: 
* &quot;The Mad Drummer Plays The Yuyang Triple Rolls (Mi Heng)&quot; () - describes the crimes of Cao Cao
* &quot;Zen Master Yu Has a Dream of Cuixiang&quot; () - a Buddhist story
* &quot;The Female Mulan Joins the Army in Place of Her Father&quot; () - describes Hua Mulan
* &quot;The Girl Graduate Rejects the Female Phoenix and Gains the Male Phoenix&quot; () - describes Huang Chonggu

Xu&#x27;s dramatic efforts often deal with women&#x27;s themes. 

The British orientalist Arthur Waley, in his introduction to the 1942 translation of &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; argued that Xu Wei was the author but later scholars have not been convinced.

Xu Wei was also a poet in &quot;shi&quot; style. Xu&#x27;s collected works in 30 chapters exists with a commentary by the late Ming writer Yuan Hongdao. Xu cared most about calligraphy and then poetry. A modern typeset edition of Xu Wei&#x27;s collected works, &quot;Xu Wei ji&quot;, was published by the Zhonghua Publishing House in Beijing in 1983. Previously a 17th-century edition of his collected works known as the &quot;Xu Wenchang sanji&quot; was reproduced in Taiwan in 1968. In 1990 a book length study of Xu Wei concludes that Xu Wei can be seen as a “scholar in cotton clothes” or &quot;buyi wenren&quot; (布衣文人), a scholar who failed the civil service examination, yet became active in the realm of literature. Many such individuals appeared in the late 16th and early 17th centuries and attached themselves to officials or became independent in late Ming China.

Xu Wei used &quot;splattered ink [that] utilises considerable quantities of ink that are practically poured onto the painting surface&quot;.

<text>Roderick James &quot;Roddy&quot; Byers (born 5 May 1955), known professionally as Roddy Radiation, is an English musician who played lead guitar for the Specials, as well as many rockabilly bands such as the Bonediggers and the Tearjerkers. He wrote the Specials favourites &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot;, &quot;Rat Race&quot; and &quot;Hey, Little Rich Girl&quot;, later covered by Amy Winehouse. Currently, Byers leads the Skabilly Rebels, a band that mixes ska rhythms with rockabilly.

==Biography==
Byers&#x27; first real band was formed in Coventry in 1975 and were called the Wild Boys. It was in the Wild Boys that he started songwriting. His first was &quot;1980&#x27;s Teddy Boy&quot;, and later came &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; which was recorded by the Specials for their debut album, &quot;Specials&quot; (1979).

Byers joined the Specials when the band was called the Coventry Automatics, and he wrote several songs for the band. The most successful was &quot;Rat Race&quot;, which peaked at number five in the UK Singles Chart in May 1980. Byers also wrote &quot;Hey Little Rich Girl&quot;, which appeared on the Specials second album, &quot;More Specials&quot; (1980). &quot;Hey Little Rich Girl&quot; was released as a single in Japan by Chrysalis Records in 1980, and covered by Amy Winehouse on her album &quot;Back to Black&quot;. Byers sang the lead vocal on &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; and &quot;Braggin&#x27; and Tryin&#x27; Not to Lie&quot;, which was released as a free single with initial copies of &quot;More Specials&quot;. &quot;Braggin&#x27; and Tryin&#x27; Not to Lie&quot; was credited to Roddy Radiation &amp; the Specials.

After the Specials split in 1981, Byers was dropped by Chrysalis before he re-emerged with the Tearjerkers, a band that he had begun in the last months of the Specials. The band played numerous gigs and gained a cult following. The band originally were Roddy Byers (vocals/guitar), Mark Byers (vocals/guitar), Joe Hughes (vocals/bass), Pete Davies (drums) and Slim Tearjerker aka Clive Pain (vocals/keyboards/accordion). The later version was comprised Roddy Byers (vocals/guitar) Mark Byers (vocals/guitar) Badger (bass) and Tony Lynch (drums). The Tearjerkers were signed up by Chiswick Records in 1982, and released their debut single &quot;Desire&quot; b/w &quot;Western Song&quot;. The band finally split in 1987 because, as Roddy commented, &quot;after seven years there was no major recording success&quot;.

The Bonediggers were formed shortly after the Tearjerkers ended in 1987. The band released a self-titled album on Rimshot Records the following year with a rawer, hard-edged rockabilly sound. The Bonediggers consisted of Roddy Radiation (vocals/guitar), David West (vocals/guitar), Sam Smith (bass), and Gary Muldoon (drums), later replaced by Jim Pryall. Byers still plays with Sam Smith to this day in the Skabilly Rebels. The Bonediggers would transition into the Raiders, shortly before Byers reunited with several members of the Specials to form the Specials MK2.

Byers was an essential part of the Specials 2, who formed in the early 1990s after teaming up with Desmond Dekker for the &quot;King of Kings&quot; album. The group toured for a couple of years throughout the UK, America and Japan. They released two singles &quot;Hypocrite&quot; and a cover of Toots &amp; the Maytals &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;. The band recorded two albums 1996 &quot;Today&#x27;s Specials&quot;, a compilation of covers and 1998 &quot;Guilty &#x27;til Proved Innocent!&quot; which were made up of original material. Byers contributed songs for latter&#x27;s &quot;Tears in My Beer,&quot; &quot;Bonediggin&#x27;,&quot; &quot;Keep on Learning&quot; and &quot;The Man With No Name&quot;.

After the Specials 2, Byers worked with the acoustic project, Three Men &amp; Black, which consisted of Jean Jacques Burnel (The Stranglers), Jake Burns (Stiff Little Fingers), Pauline Black (The Selecter), Bruce Foxton (The Jam) and Dave Wakeling (The Beat, General Public) and Nick Welsh (Skaville UK).

Byers&#x27; current band, the Skabilly Rebels, are based in Coventry. They are Roddy Byers - lead guitar, vocals; Adrian Lee - saxophone, keyboards;
Joe Harcourt - second guitar, backing vocals;, Connor O’Connor - bass guitar and Matt Hart - drums.

They released their debut album &quot;Blues Attack&quot; at the end of 2009 and toured the United States in 2012 and regularly tour the UK, Ireland and Europe.

<doc id="301705" wikidata="Q1949960" url="?curid=301705" title="Neville Staple">
<text>Neville Eugenton Staple (born 11 April 1955), sometimes credited as Neville Staples, is a Jamaican-born English singer, known for his work with the 2-tone ska band the Specials, the pop group Fun Boy Three, as well as with his own group, the Neville Staple Band. He also performed with Ranking Roger in the supergroup Special Beat.

==Early life==
Staple was born in Manchester, Jamaica. He left Jamaica to live in the English town of Rugby, Warwickshire at the age of five but later moved to Coventry. Neville was a regular fixture at the Locarno Ballroom in Coventry, where he met the resident DJ there, Pete Waterman. Waterman briefly managed the Specials and would later write the foreword to Staple&#x27;s 2009 biography, &quot;Original Rude Boy&quot;.

Staple&#x27;s early vocal style was mostly &quot;toasting&quot;—or chanting over a rhythm—a forerunner of rapping brought to Britain in the 1960s by musicians from Jamaica. Staple honed his toasting skills in the sound system scene in Coventry during the 1970s, first on his cousin&#x27;s &quot;Messenger Sound&quot; and later his own system called &quot;Jah Baddis&quot;.

==Career==

===The Specials===
Staple&#x27;s first involvement with the Specials was when they were still called the Coventry Automatics. Initially employed as their roadie, Staple joined the band on stage at a gig supporting the Clash. At that point, the line-up already included Jerry Dammers, Horace Panter and Silverton Hutchinson on drums. Terry Hall subsequently came in as vocalist, replacing Tim Strickland, and Roddy Radiation joined on lead guitar. John Bradbury would later take over on drums from Silverton.

In the Specials, Staple sang lead vocals on some tracks or additional and backing vocals alongside Terry Hall&#x27;s lead. He also contributed to the writing of many of their songs, but rarely received credit.

The Specials were managed for a time by the Clash&#x27;s manager, Bernard Rhodes, whom Staple toasted in the phrase &quot;Bernie Rhodes knows don&#x27;t argue&quot; at the beginning of the Specials&#x27; hit single &quot;Gangsters&quot;.

===Fun Boy Three===
When the Specials initially split up, Staple departed with Terry Hall and Lynval Golding to form Fun Boy Three. They had a string of chart hits, some in collaboration with the all-female trio Bananarama.

===Third wave of ska===
In 1990, Staple joined Ranking Roger from the Beat to form Special Beat, a revival group playing hits from both former 2 Tone bands the Specials and the Beat. This was in response to the huge explosion of interest in ska in the United States—the so-called &quot;Third Wave&quot; of ska. Neville moved to California in the 1990s to work with many of these new American ska and punk acts, including No Doubt, Rancid and Unwritten Law. Neville also featured on the song &quot;Explosive&quot; by the Canadian ska band the Planet Smashers.

Staple participated in a reunion line-up of the Specials from 1993 to 2001, and again from 2009 to 2012, after which he left the band due to mostly personal reasons, as well as some health concerns.

In 2000, Staple&#x27;s re-recordings of hits by the Specials and Fun Boy Three were released as &quot;The Very Best of the Specials and Fun Boy Three&quot;, without being prominently labelled as a solo work by Staple.

==Solo career==
Staple worked for many years in the US with various bands, including the Hitmen, the team providing the soundtrack for the 2003 movie &quot;Vampires Anonymous&quot;. Since 2004, he has toured the UK, Europe, Middle East, Australia and New Zealand with his own band, as well as several successful tours and shows alongside Ranking Roger of the Beat and Pauline Black of the Selecter, as Special Beat and Legends of Ska, respectively. He also helped to launch the career of Johnny Zee (aka Taz of Stereo Nation) of Bollywood music fame, after managing and producing him early on.

In 2004, Staple returned to the UK and formed the Neville Staple Band, releasing the critically acclaimed album &quot;The Rude Boy Returns&quot;, with contributions from Clash guitarist Mick Jones and Damned drummer Rat Scabies. The group featured former members of the British ska band Bad Manners, with Warren Middleton on trombone (later replaced by Spencer Hague), Stephen Armstrong on bass guitar, Matty Bane on drums and Andy Perriss on guitar, as well as Joe Atkinson from Flipron on keyboards/organ and occasionally Patrick Pretorius from the Talks on drums.

===Biography===
In April 2009, Staple set out on a reunion tour with the Specials. The same month also saw the launch of his biography, &quot;Original Rude Boy&quot;, published by Aurum Press. The book covers Staple&#x27;s childhood in Jamaica and early involvement with the 1970s sound system scene, as well as his work with the Specials and Fun Boy Three. Neville collaborated with former BBC journalist Tony McMahon on the book and both are registered with the Blake Friedmann literary agency.

===Later career===
In December 2013, Perriss decided to leave the Neville Staple Band after more than 12 years, replaced by Billy Shinbone on guitar.

In May 2014, Staple released &quot;Ska Crazy&quot; with his band, which included classic ska covers and brand new material. His wife Christine Staple and long-time friend Daddy Woody, a Jamaican DJ/artist, also provide vocals on the album.

Staple has also worked on various collaborations with the Mutants, including co-writing four tracks on the album &quot;Rhythm and Punk Review&quot; (one of them co-written with his wife Christine), as well as with the Talks Flipron, Dub Pistols and Duplex. In 2015, Staple produced his wife Christine&#x27;s EP &quot;Rudegirl Sounds&quot;. Christine began performing with the Neville Staple Band that same year.

From 2016 onward, Staple has continued to collaborate with other artists, including Save Ferris, the Rifffs, Jessy Greene and Ed Rome, and has toured extensively across the UK, Europe, Australia, Hong Kong and the US. &quot;Return of Judge Roughneck &amp; Dub Specials&quot; was released in February 2017 and was co-produced with Tom Lowry from Planet Studios and Staple&#x27;s wife Christine, who also co-writes and performs songs with him. The lead track video was premiered by &quot;Vive Le Rock&quot; magazine and the album received positive reviews. Staple recreated his famous Judge Roughneck character, first heard as part of the &quot;Stupid Marriage&quot; song on the Specials&#x27; debut album on 2-Tone Records. The second half of the album consists of dub music.

In 2018, another joint album with Christine Sugary Staple, &quot;Rude Rebels&quot;, was released, including collaborations with former Specials bandmate Roddy &quot;Radiation&quot; Byers.

Staple toured with his band celebrating &#x27;40 Years of Ghost Town&#x27;. The current Neville Staple Band line-up consists of Christine &quot;Sugary&quot; Staple on vocals, ex-Specials member Drew Stanshall on saxophone, ex-Bad Manners members Matty &quot;Bingo&quot; Bane on drums and Stephen &quot;Sledge&quot; Armstrong on bass, as well as Billy Shinbone on guitar, Joe Atkinson on keyboards and Pete New on trombone.

In January 2024, Staple announced that he had been diagnosed with a serious heart defect, and was therefore cancelling all future live performances.

<doc id="301707" wikidata="Q337189" url="?curid=301707" title="Arnulf of Metz">
<text>Arnulf of Metz ( 582 – 645) was a Frankish bishop of Metz and advisor to the Merovingian court of Austrasia. He later retired to the Abbey of Remiremont. In French he is also known as Arnoul or Arnoulf. In English he is known as Arnold.

==Genealogy==
The &quot;Vita Sancti Arnulfi&quot; (c. 657), written shortly after Arnulf&#x27;s death, states that he was of Frankish ancestry, from &quot;sufficiently elevated and noble parentage, and very rich in worldly goods&quot;. Tenth- and eleventh-century texts like &quot;Genealogiae Breves Regum Francorum&quot; often claim that Arnoald was Arnulf&#x27;s father, but this is considered a fabrication. Medieval Frankish historians Patrick Geary and Richard Gerberding observe that the lack of contemporary written texts makes it impossible to trace Arnulf&#x27;s ancestry.

Arnulf of Metz is traditionally considered the earliest named ancestor of Charlemagne and the Carolingian dynasty. This belief originates from two sources written after Arnulf&#x27;s death. Paul the Deacon&#x27;s &quot;Liber de episcopis Mettensibus&quot; (c. 784) presents Arnulf as Charlemagne&#x27;s third great-grandfather, while &quot;Annales Mettenses Priores&quot; (805) depicts him as only a &quot;close relative.&quot; Because these two accounts are inconsistent and written a century after Arnulf&#x27;s death, some scholars say that the familial connection between Arnulf and Charlemagne was an invention by Charlemagne.

==Life==
Arnulf was born to an important Frankish family near Nancy in Lorraine around 582. The family owned vast domains between the Moselle and Meuse rivers. As an adolescent, he was called to the Merovingian court of king Theudebert II (595–612) of Austrasia, where he was educated by Gondulf of Provence. Arnulf was later sent to serve as &quot;dux&quot; at the Schelde.

Arnulf gave distinguished service at the Austrasian court under Theudebert II. He distinguished himself both as a military commander and in the civil administration; at one time he had under his care six distinct provinces. Arnulf married in 596 to a noblewoman whom later sources identify as Dode or Doda (born c. 584), the paternal aunt of Saint Glodesind of France, an abbess of a monastery in Metz. Chlodulf of Metz was their eldest son, but more important was their second son Ansegisel, who married Begga, daughter of Pepin I of Landen. Arnulf is thus the male-line grandfather of Pepin of Herstal, great-grandfather of Charles Martel and great-great-great-grandfather of Charlemagne.

Around 611, Arnulf and his friend Romaricus, likewise an officer of the court, planned to make a pilgrimage to the Abbey of Lérins. Chlothachar, who appreciated Arnulf&#x27;s administrative skills, offered him the vacant see of Metz, the capital of the Austrasian kingdom. His wife took the veil as a nun in a monastery at Trèves, and Arnulf saw it as a sign of God and became a priest and bishop afterwards. He continued to serve as the king&#x27;s steward and courtier.

The rule of Austrasia came into the hands of Brunhilda, the grandmother of Theudebert, who ruled also in Burgundy in the name of her great-grandchildren. In 613 Arnulf joined his politics with Pepin of Landen and led the opposition of Frankish nobles against Queen Brunhilda. The revolt led to her overthrow, torture and eventual execution, and the subsequent reunification of Frankish lands under Chlothachar II.

Chlothachar later made his son Dagobert I king of Austrasia, which he ruled with the help of his adviser Arnulf. Pepin of Landen became mayor of the palace. In 624 Pepin and Arnulf encouraged Dagobert in the murder of Chrodoald, an important leader of the Frankish Agilolfings family. In 625 Arnulf took part in a council held by the Frankish bishops at Reims.

During his career he was attracted to religious life, and around 628 he retired to a hermitage at a mountain site in his domains in the Vosges to become a monk. His friend Romaric, whose parents had been killed by Brunhilda, had preceded him to the mountains around 613; there Romaric and Amatus established Remiremont Abbey. After the death of Chlothachar in 629, Arnulf settled near Habendum, where he died some time between 643 and 647. He was buried at Remiremont.

Arnulf is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church. In iconography, he is typically portrayed with a pastoral staff or a rake in his hand. His feast day is July 18.

==Legends==
There are three legends associated with Arnulf:

===The Legend of the Ring===
Arnulf was tormented by the violence that surrounded him and feared that he had played a role in the wars and murders that plagued the ruling families. Obsessed by these sins, Arnulf went to a bridge over the Moselle river. There he took off his bishop&#x27;s ring and threw it into the river, praying to God to give him a sign of absolution by returning the ring to him. Many penitent years later, a fisherman brought to the bishop&#x27;s kitchen a fish in the stomach of which was found the bishop&#x27;s ring. Arnulf repaid the sign from God by immediately retiring as bishop and becoming a hermit for the remainder of his life.

===The Legend of the Fire===
At the moment Arnulf resigned as bishop, a fire broke out in the cellars of the royal palace and threatened to spread throughout the city of Metz. Arnulf, full of courage and feeling unity with the townspeople, stood before the fire and said, &quot;If God wants me to be consumed, I am in His hands.&quot; He then made the sign of the cross at which point the fire immediately receded.

===The Legend of the Beer Mug===
It was July 642 and very hot when the parishioners of Metz went to Remiremont to recover the remains of their former bishop. They had little to drink and the terrain was inhospitable. At the point when the exhausted procession was about to leave Champigneulles, one of the parishioners, Duc Notto, prayed &quot;By his powerful intercession the Blessed Arnold will bring us what we lack.&quot; Immediately the small remnant of beer at the bottom of a pot multiplied in such amounts that the pilgrims&#x27; thirst was quenched and they had enough to enjoy the next evening when they arrived in Metz. For this reason he is known as the patron saint of Brewers.

<doc id="301708" wikidata="Q442628" url="?curid=301708" title="Isamu Noguchi">
<text>was an American artist, furniture designer and landscape architect whose career spanned six decades from the 1920s. Known for his sculpture and public artworks, Noguchi also designed stage sets for various Martha Graham productions, and several mass-produced lamps and furniture pieces, some of which are still manufactured and sold.

In 1947, Noguchi began a collaboration with the Herman Miller company, when he joined with George Nelson, Paul László and Charles Eames to produce a catalog containing what is often considered to be the most influential body of modern furniture ever produced, including the iconic Noguchi table which remains in production today. His work is displayed at the Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum in New York City.

==Early life (1904–1922)==
Isamu Noguchi was born in Los Angeles, the son of Yone Noguchi, a Japanese poet who was acclaimed in the United States, and Léonie Gilmour, an American writer who edited much of Noguchi&#x27;s work.

Yone had ended his relationship with Gilmour earlier that year and planned to marry &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporter Ethel Armes. After proposing to Armes, Yone left for Japan in late August, settling in Tokyo and awaiting her arrival; their engagement fell through months later when Armes learned of Léonie and her newborn son.

In 1906, Yone invited Léonie to come to Tokyo with their son. She at first refused, but growing anti-Japanese sentiment following the Russo-Japanese War eventually convinced her to take up Yone&#x27;s offer. The two departed from San Francisco in March 1907, arriving in Yokohama to meet Yone. Upon arrival, their son was finally given the name Isamu (, &quot;courage&quot;). However, Yone had married a Japanese woman by the time they arrived, and was mostly absent from his son&#x27;s childhood. After again separating from Yone, Léonie and Isamu moved several times throughout Japan.

In 1912, while the two were living in Chigasaki, Isamu&#x27;s half-sister, pioneer of the American Modern Dance movement Ailes Gilmour, was born to Léonie and an unknown Japanese father. Here, Léonie had a house built for the three of them, a project that she had the 8-year-old Isamu &quot;oversee&quot;. Nurturing her son&#x27;s artistic ability, she put him in charge of their garden and apprenticed him to a local carpenter. However, they moved once again in December 1917 to an English-speaking community in Yokohama.

In 1918, Noguchi was sent back to the US for schooling in Rolling Prairie, Indiana. After graduation, he left with Dr. Edward Rumely to LaPorte, where he found boarding with a Swedenborgian pastor, Samuel Mack. Noguchi began attending La Porte High School, graduating in 1922. During this period of his life, he was known by the name &quot;Sam Gilmour&quot;.

==Early artistic career (1922–1927)==
After high school, Noguchi explained his desire to become an artist to Rumely; though Rumely preferred that Noguchi become a doctor, he acknowledged Noguchi&#x27;s request and sent him to Connecticut to work as an apprentice to his friend Gutzon Borglum. Best known as the creator of Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Borglum was at the time working on the group called &quot;Wars of America&quot; for the city of Newark, New Jersey, a work of art that includes forty-two figures and two equestrian sculptures. As one of Borglum&#x27;s apprentices, Noguchi received little training as a sculptor; his tasks included arranging the horses and modeling for the monument as General Sherman. He did, however, pick up some skills in casting from Borglum&#x27;s Italian assistants, later fashioning a bust of Abraham Lincoln. At summer&#x27;s end, Borglum told Noguchi that he would never become a sculptor, prompting him to reconsider Rumely&#x27;s prior suggestion.

He then traveled to New York City, reuniting with the Rumely family at their new residence, and with Dr. Rumely&#x27;s financial aid enrolled in February 1922 as a premedical student at Columbia University. Soon after, he met the bacteriologist Hideyo Noguchi, who urged him to reconsider art, as well as the Japanese dancer Michio Itō, whose celebrity status later helped Noguchi find acquaintances in the art world. Another influence was his mother, who in 1923 moved from Japan to California, then later to New York.

In 1924, while still enrolled at Columbia, Noguchi followed his mother&#x27;s advice to take night classes at the Leonardo da Vinci Art School. The school&#x27;s head, Onorio Ruotolo, was immediately impressed by Noguchi&#x27;s work. Only three months later, Noguchi held his first exhibit, a selection of plaster and terracotta works. He soon dropped out of Columbia University to pursue sculpture full-time, changing his name from Gilmour (the surname he had used for years) to Noguchi.

After moving into his own studio, Noguchi found work through commissions for portrait busts, and won the Logan Medal of the Arts. During this time, he frequented &quot;avant garde&quot; shows at the galleries of such modernists as Alfred Stieglitz and J. B. Neuman, and took a particular interest in a show of the works of Romanian-born sculptor Constantin Brâncuși.

In late 1926, Noguchi applied for a Guggenheim Fellowship. In his letter of application, he proposed to study stone and wood cutting and to gain &quot;a better understanding of the human figure&quot; in Paris for a year, then spend another year traveling through Asia, exhibit his work, and return to New York. He was awarded the grant despite being three years short of the age requirement.

==Early travels (1927–1937)==
Noguchi arrived in Paris in April 1927 and soon afterward met the American author Robert McAlmon, who brought him to Constantin Brâncuși&#x27;s studio for an introduction. Despite a language barrier between the two artists (Noguchi barely spoke French, and Brâncuși did not speak English), Noguchi was taken in as Brâncuși&#x27;s assistant for the next seven months. During this time, Noguchi gained his footing in stone sculpture, a medium with which he was unacquainted, though he would later admit that one of Brâncuși&#x27;s greatest teachings was to appreciate &quot;the value of the moment&quot;. Meanwhile, Noguchi found himself in good company in France, with letters of introduction from Michio Itō helping him to meet such artists as Jules Pascin and Alexander Calder, who lived in the studio of Arno Breker. They became friends and Breker did a bronze bust of Noguchi.

Noguchi only produced one sculpture – his marble &quot;Sphere Section&quot; – in his first year, but during his second year he stayed in Paris and continued his training in stoneworking with the Italian sculptor Mateo Hernandes, producing over twenty more abstractions of wood, stone and sheet metal. Noguchi&#x27;s next major destination was India, from which he would travel east; he arrived in London to read up on Oriental sculpture, but was denied the extension to the Guggenheim Fellowship he needed.

In February 1929, he left for New York City. Brâncuși had recommended that Noguchi visit Romany Marie&#x27;s café in Greenwich Village. Noguchi did so and there met Buckminster Fuller, with whom he collaborated on several projects, including the modeling of Fuller&#x27;s Dymaxion car.

Upon his return, Noguchi&#x27;s abstract sculptures made in Paris were exhibited in his first one-man show at the Eugene Schoen Gallery. After none of his works sold, Noguchi altogether abandoned abstract art for portrait busts in order to support himself. He soon found himself accepting commissions from wealthy and celebrity clients. A 1930 exhibit of several busts, including those of Martha Graham and Buckminster Fuller, garnered positive reviews, and after less than a year of portrait sculpture, Noguchi had earned enough money to continue his trip to Asia.

Noguchi left for Paris in April 1930, and two months later received his visa to ride the Trans-Siberian Railway. He opted to visit Japan first rather than India, but after learning that his father Yone did not want his son to visit using his surname, a shaken Noguchi instead departed for Beijing. In China, he studied brush painting with Qi Baishi, staying for six months before finally sailing for Japan. Even before his arrival in Kobe, Japanese newspapers had picked up on Noguchi&#x27;s supposed reunion with his father; though he denied that this was the reason for his visit, the two did meet in Tokyo. He later arrived in Kyoto to study pottery with Uno Jinmatsu. Here he took note of local Zen gardens and haniwa, clay funerary figures of the Kofun period which inspired his terracotta &quot;The Queen&quot;.

Noguchi returned to New York amidst the Great Depression, finding few clients for his portrait busts. However, he hoped to sell his newly produced sculptures and brush paintings from Asia. Though very few sold, Noguchi regarded this one-man exhibition (which began in February 1932 and toured Chicago, the west coast, and Honolulu) as his &quot;most successful&quot;. Additionally, his next attempt to break into abstract art, a large streamlined figure of dancer Ruth Page entitled &quot;Miss Expanding Universe&quot;, was poorly received. In January 1933 he worked in Chicago with Santiago Martínez Delgado on a mural for Chicago&#x27;s Century of Progress Exposition, then again found a business for his portrait busts. He moved to London in June hoping to find more work, but returned in December just before his mother Leonie&#x27;s death.

Beginning in February 1934, Noguchi began submitting his first designs for public spaces and monuments to the Public Works of Art Program. One such design, a monument to Benjamin Franklin, remained unrealized for decades. Another design, a gigantic pyramidal earthwork entitled &quot;Monument to the American Plow&quot;, was similarly rejected, and his &quot;sculptural landscape&quot; of a playground, &quot;Play Mountain&quot;, was personally rejected by Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. He was eventually dropped from the program, and again supported himself by sculpting portrait busts. In early 1935, after another solo exhibition, the &quot;New York Sun&#x27;s&quot; Henry McBride labeled Noguchi&#x27;s &quot;Death&quot;, depicting a lynched African-American, as &quot;a little Japanese mistake&quot;. That same year he produced the set for &quot;Frontier&quot;, the first of many set designs for Martha Graham.

After the Federal Art Project started up, Noguchi again put forth designs, one of which was another earthwork chosen for the New York City airport entitled &quot;Relief Seen from the Sky&quot;; following further rejection, Noguchi left for Hollywood, where he again worked as a portrait sculptor to earn money for a sojourn in Mexico. Here, Noguchi was chosen to design his first public work, a relief mural for the Abelardo Rodriguez market in Mexico City. The 20-meter-long &quot;History as Seen from Mexico in 1936&quot; was hugely political and socially conscious, featuring such modern symbols as the Nazi swastika, a hammer and sickle, and the equation &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;². Noguchi also met Frida Kahlo during this time and had a brief but passionate affair with her; they remained friends until her death.

==Further career in the United States (1937–1948)==
Noguchi returned to New York in 1937. He designed the Zenith Radio Nurse, the iconic original baby monitor now held in many museum collections. The Radio Nurse was Noguchi&#x27;s first major design commission and he called it &quot;my only strictly industrial design&quot;.

He again began to turn out portrait busts, and after various proposals was selected for two sculptures. The first of these, a fountain built of automobile parts for the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s exhibit at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, was thought of poorly by critics and Noguchi alike but nevertheless introduced him to fountain-construction and magnesite. Conversely, his second sculpture, a nine-ton stainless steel bas-relief entitled &quot;News&quot;, was unveiled over the entrance to the Associated Press building at the Rockefeller Center in April 1940 to much praise. Following further rejections of his playground designs, Noguchi left on a cross-country road trip with Arshile Gorky and Gorky&#x27;s fiancée in July 1941, eventually separating from them to go to Hollywood.

Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, anti-Japanese sentiment was energized in the United States, and in response Noguchi formed &quot;Nisei Writers and Artists for Democracy&quot;. Noguchi and other group leaders wrote to influential officials, including the congressional committee headed by Representative John H. Tolan, hoping to halt the internment of Japanese Americans; Noguchi later attended the hearings but had little effect on their outcome. He later helped organize a documentary of the internment, but left California before its release; as a legal resident of New York, he was allowed to return home. He hoped to prove Japanese-American loyalty by somehow contributing to the war effort, but when other governmental departments turned him down, Noguchi met with John Collier, head of the Office of Indian Affairs, who persuaded him to travel to the internment camp located on an Indian reservation in Poston, Arizona, to promote arts and crafts and community.

Noguchi arrived at the Poston camp in May 1942, becoming its only voluntary internee. Noguchi first worked in a carpentry shop, but his hope was to design parks and recreational areas within the camp. Although he created several plans at Poston, among them designs for baseball fields, swimming pools, and a cemetery, he found that the War Relocation Authority had no intention of implementing them. To the WRA camp administrators he was a troublesome interloper from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and to the internees he was an agent of the camp administration. Many did not trust him and saw him as a spy. He had found nothing in common with the Nisei, who regarded him as a strange outsider.

In June, Noguchi applied for release, but intelligence officers labeled him as a &quot;suspicious person&quot; due to his involvement in &quot;Nisei Writers and Artists for Democracy&quot;. He was finally granted a month-long furlough on November 12, but never returned; though he was granted a permanent leave afterward, he soon afterward received a deportation order. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, accusing him of espionage, launched into a full investigation of Noguchi which ended only through the American Civil Liberties Union&#x27;s intervention. Noguchi would later retell his wartime experiences in the British World War II television documentary series &quot;The World at War&quot;.

Upon his return to New York, Noguchi took a new studio in Greenwich Village. Throughout the 1940s, Noguchi&#x27;s sculpture drew from the ongoing surrealist movement; these works include not only various mixed-media constructions and landscape reliefs, but &quot;lunars&quot; – self-illuminating reliefs – and a series of biomorphic sculptures made of interlocking slabs. The most famous of these assembled-slab works, &quot;Kouros&quot;, was first shown in a September 1946 exhibition, helping to cement his place in the New York art scene.

In 1947 he began a working relationship with Herman Miller of Zeeland, Michigan. This relationship was to prove very fruitful, resulting in several designs that have become symbols of the modernist style, including the iconic Noguchi table, which remains in production today. Noguchi also developed a relationship with Knoll, designing furniture and lamps. During this period he continued his involvement with theater, designing sets for Martha Graham&#x27;s &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; and John Cage and Merce Cunningham&#x27;s production of &quot;The Seasons&quot;. Near the end of his time in New York, he also found more work designing public spaces, including a commission for the ceilings of the Time-Life headquarters.

In March 1949, Noguchi had his first one-person show in New York since 1935 at the Charles Egan Gallery. In September 2003, The Pace Gallery held an exhibition of Noguchi&#x27;s work at their 57th Street gallery. The exhibition, entitled &quot;33 MacDougal Alley: The Interlocking Sculpture of Isamu Noguchi&quot;, featured eleven of the artist’s interlocking sculptures. This was the first exhibition to illustrate the historical significance of the relationship between MacDougal Alley and Isamu Noguchi’s sculptural work.
==Bollingen Fellowship and life in Japan (1948–1952)==

Following the suicide of his artist friend Arshile Gorky in 1948, and a failed romantic relationship with Nayantara Pandit (the niece of Indian nationalist Jawaharlal Nehru), Noguchi applied for a Bollingen Fellowship to travel the world, proposing to study public space as research for a book about the &quot;environment of leisure&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t until 15 years after his death that this project came to fruition as an international traveling exhibition and a deluxe limited-edition publication, organized by Noguchi&#x27;s long-time assistant and curator at the Noguchi Museum, Bonnie Rychlak.

==Later years (1952–1988)==

In his later years Noguchi gained in prominence and acclaim, installing his large-scale works in many of the world&#x27;s major cities.

He was married to the ethnic-Japanese icon of Chinese song and cinema Yoshiko Yamaguchi, between 1952 and 1957.

From 1959 to 1988, Noguchi was in a long-term friendship with Priscilla Morgan, a New York talent agent and art patron who strove to protect Noguchi&#x27;s artistic legacy after his death.

In 1955, he designed the sets and costumes for a controversial theatre production of &quot;King Lear&quot; starring John Gielgud.

In 1962, he was elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

In 1971, he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1986, he represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, showing a number of his Akari light sculptures.

In 1987, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

Isamu Noguchi died on December 30, 1988, at the age of 84 at New York University Medical Center of pneumonia. In its obituary for Noguchi, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;a versatile and prolific sculptor whose earthy stones and meditative gardens bridging East and West have become landmarks of 20th-century art&quot;.

<text>Sceliphron caementarium, also known as the yellow-legged mud-dauber wasp, black-and-yellow mud dauber (within the US), or black-waisted mud-dauber (outside of the US), is a species of sphecid wasp. There are some 30 other species of &quot;Sceliphron&quot; that occur throughout the world, though in appearance and habits they are quite similar to &quot;S. caementarium&quot;.

==Etymology==
The Latin species name &quot;caementarius&quot; means &quot;mason&quot; or &quot;builder of walls&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;S. caementarium&quot; is widespread in Canada, the United States, Central America and the West Indies, and has been introduced to many Pacific Islands (including Australia, Hawaii, and Japan), Peru and Europe, where it has become established in some countries of the Mediterranean Basin (Croatia, France and Corsica, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, the Canary Islands, and Madeira) and Austria, Bulgaria and Ukraine.

This species is found in a wide variety of habitats, such as rock ledges, man-made structures, puddles and other water edges, cypress domes, in long leaf pines (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;), and in turkey oaks.

==Description==

&quot;Sceliphron caementarium&quot; can reach a length of . Their petiole is generally black and is about half the length of the entire abdomen, however the population in the desert southwest often has a yellow petiole. The thorax shows various yellow markings, while the abdomen is normally black, with yellow propodeum (typical of females). The eyes are black, the antennae are black, and the legs are yellow with black trochanters and femurs. Within the United States, it is the only species with yellow-marked legs. The wings are a tawny color.

==Biology==
The black and yellow mud daubers are solitary parasitoid wasps that build nests out of mud. These sphecid wasps collect mud balls at puddle and pool edges for constructing nests. Frequently, nests are built in shaded areas inside formations that are sheltered from the weather or from other environmental elements. These sites may be naturally-occurring, or man-made structures. Some examples are: under and inside various types of bridges, barns, garages, open-air porches, or under housing eaves. The nests comprise up to 25 vertically arranged, individual cylindrical cells. After initial creation and covering of the clutch, this sphecid wasp uses more mud as a means covering and protecting the whole cluster of cells, thereby forming a smooth appearance, and a uniform nest. The entire nest may attain an area equal to, or larger than, the size of an average human fist.

After building a cell of the nest, the female wasp captures several spiders. The captured prey are stung and paralyzed before being placed in the nest (usually 6–15 per cell), and then a single egg is deposited on the prey within each cell. The wasp then seals the cell with a thick mud plug. After finishing a series of cells, she leaves and does not return. While consuming the prey and increasing in size, the larva molts several times, until it molts into a pupa. Once the pupa has developed into an adult wasp, the adult emerges from its pupal case and breaks out of its mud chamber.

Adults can be seen in mid-summer feeding on nectar at flowers, especially Queen Anne&#x27;s lace (&quot;Daucus carota&quot;), parsnips, and water parsnips (&quot;Sium suave&quot;, &quot;Sium latifolium&quot;, &quot;Berula erecta&quot;). They have a low reproductive rate. Stings are rare due to their solitary and usually nonaggressive nature; however, nests are aggressively defended.

A common species of cuckoo wasp, &quot;Chrysis angolensis&quot;, is frequently a cleptoparasite in &quot;Sceliphron&quot; nests, and is only one of many different insects that parasitize these mud daubers.

===Venom===
Although they are common components of venoms: serotonin, histamine, acetylcholine, and kinins are absent from &quot;S. caementarium&quot; venom.

==Mentions in popular media==
In 1996, Birgenair Flight 301 crashed near Puerto Rico. The most probable cause of this Boeing 757 crash was a blockage in a pitot tube by a mud dauber&#x27;s nest.

<text>Ural Federal District () is one of the eight federal districts of Russia. Its population was 12,080,523 (79.9% urban) according to the 2010 Census.

The district was established on 13 May 2000 by a decree of the President of Russia. It is located at the border of the European and Asian parts of Russia. The administrative centre of the district is the city of Yekaterinburg.

The district contributes 18% to Russia&#x27;s Gross Regional Product (GRP), although its population is only 8.5% of the Russian total.

==General information and statistics==

Ethnic composition, according to the 2010 census:

The district covers an area of , about 10% of Russia. According to the 2010 Census, the district had a population of 12,080,526, of whom 82.74% were Russians (10,237,992 people), 5.14% Tatars (636,454), 2.87% Ukrainians (355,087) and 2.15% Bashkirs (265,586). The remainder comprises various ethnicities of the former Soviet Union. 79.9% of the district&#x27;s population lived in urban areas.

In 2006, the district provided 90% of Russian natural gas production, 68% of oil and 42% of metal products. Industrial production per capita in the district is about 2.5 times higher than the average value throughout Russia. The district provides about 42% of Russian tax incomes, mostly from industry. Its major branches are fuel mining and production (53%), metallurgy (24%) and metal processing and engineering (8.8%). The latter two are especially developed in Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk Oblast which, between them, constitute 83% of Russian metallurgy and 73% of metal processing and engineering. Whereas fuel and mineral mining has been providing a nearly constant outcome between 1990 and 2006, metal processing and engineering are declining, despite the fact that they employ up to 30% of industry workers of the district. Local ore processing plants can provide only 20% of required copper, 28% chromium, 35% iron and 17% coal, and many of these resources are nearly exhausted. Meanwhile, the average distance to import them to the Ural is 2,500 km.

The district is governed by the Presidential Envoy, and individual envoys are assigned by the President of Russia to all the Oblasts of the district. Pyotr Latyshev was envoy to the Urals Federal District until his death on 2 December 2008. Nikolay Vinnichenko succeeded him on this post on 8 December 2008. On 6 September 2011 Vinnichenko was appointed the envoy to the Northwestern Federal District, and Yevgeny Kuyvashev became the Presidential Envoy in the Ural Federal District. On 18 May 2012 Vladimir Putin offered the tenure to Igor Kholmanskikh, an engineer without any previous political experience, and Kholmanskikh accepted the offer. On 26 June 2018, Kholmanskikh was replaced by Nikolay Tsukanov.

===Federal subjects===
The district comprises the Central (part) and West Siberian economic regions and six federal subjects:

Source for names of federal subjects: (note - source refers to &#x27;regions&#x27; rather than Okrugs or Oblasts)

===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey 32.7% of the population of the Ural Federal District adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 6.9% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 3.4% is an Eastern Orthodox believer without belonging to any church or adheres to other (non-Russian) Eastern Orthodox churches, 6.0% is an adherent of Islam, and 1.1% adhere to some native faith such as Rodnovery. In addition, 31.2% of the population declares to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 12.8% is atheist, and 5.9% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.

<doc id="301716" wikidata="Q4116189" url="?curid=301716" title="Thames Gateway">
<text>Thames Gateway is a term applied to an area around the Thames Estuary in the context of discourse around regeneration and further urbanisation. The term was first coined by the UK government and applies to an area of land stretching east from inner east and south-east London on both sides of the River Thames and the Thames Estuary. It stretches from Westferry in Tower Hamlets to the Isle of Sheppey/Southend-on-Sea and extends across three ceremonial counties.

==Rationale==
The area was designated during the early years of the Blair ministry as a national priority for urban regeneration because it contained large amounts of brownfield land and to take advantage of rail capacity improvements created at Stratford and in parts of Kent, by the High Speed 1 railway (officially known as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link). The term was first coined by the UK government, with the government and others also use the term Thames Estuary to apply to the area. Much of the brownfield land has now been redeveloped.

==Scope==
The Thames Gateway has a population of over 3 million and comprises generally Thameside belts of 16 local government districts:

==Profile==
The immediate settlements next to the types of land indicated, not taking the authorities as a whole, contains about half of the population of those authorities: 1.6 million people and contained in the 2000 survey some of the most deprived wards in the country, characterised by lack of access to public transport, services, employment and affordable quality housing, in particular having many overspill estates from earlier slum clearance and London&#x27;s urban planning – examples being from Thamesmead to Southend-on-Sea.

Its boundary was drawn to capture the riverside strip that formerly hosted many land-occupying industries, serving London and the South East, whose decline has left a patchy legacy of dereliction and contaminated land. Striking precursor examples of development are those pioneered at Canary Wharf and on the Greenwich Peninsula, which the governments since 2000 have aimed to reflect across this area (having widespread comparable land use to those tracts of land).

Its brownfield land, farmland and wild salt marshland has been seen by successive governments and planners as having potential to act as a catalyst for the regeneration and growth and for the social advancement of the area, helping to alleviate some of the growth pressures on London and the South East. Amid steep house price inflation and an economic boom in 2004 the government also expressed the firm belief that new private sector housing here and elsewhere would reduce that inflation.

Parts of the area are of settled character and/or already densely populated with little scope for housing developments: Southend-on-Sea, for example, is the eighth most densely populated district in the country outside London and mass expansion is not desired owing to the river at the south, the need for leisure space and animal habitat (mostly in the buffer zones separating communities) and an economic desire and legal demand to preserve the existing character of housing estates.

==Administration and delivery==
The Department for Communities and Local Government is responsible for co-ordinating the project.

The Thames Gateway project aims to improve the economy of the region through the development of marshland, farmland and brownfield land, through major transport infrastructure provision and the renaissance of existing urban conurbations.

Comparisons may be drawn with developments east of Paris along the Marne valley, which applied to a significantly smaller volume of land.

Formerly the development was in part delivered by the three regional development agencies: the London Development Agency (LDA – part of the Greater London Authority), the East of England Development Agency (EEDA) and the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA), as well as the national regeneration agency, English Partnerships.

Development that is supplemental to councils&#x27; own development plans is delivered through Local Authorities (Councils), special purpose development corporations and local enterprise partnerships, all of which are eligible for grants from government departments funded by HM Treasury. Additional government funds were supplied to the Regional Development Agencies who supported some projects in the Gateway.

==Former redevelopment zones==
Formerly, the development was split into zones each with a different agency responsible for delivery. The zones were:

==Developments==

Before 2003 most conspicuous development was situated west of Beckton. There have been substantial housing schemes at Chafford Hundred, Chatham and Greenhithe and there is a large shopping centre at Bluewater.

==Environmental implications==
Proposals for a large international airport on Cliffe Marshes were dropped from the government&#x27;s white paper on air transport in 2003 after they were rejected by local residents, the local council, as well as conservation charities such as the RSPB. The plan, which would have required the raising the ground level by 15 m. was also rejected by the Confederation of British Industry as too expensive.

On the question of airport capacity, the Government had established the independent Airports Commission, headed until 2015 by Sir Howard Davies. The Commission examined the nature, scale and timing of any requirement for additional capacity to maintain the UK&#x27;s global hub status. The Aviation Policy Framework of March 2013 was an important piece in the jigsaw, setting out the principles which the commission would take into account in presenting its recommendations reported in 2013 and in 2015. The options included an outside possibility of a floating airport off the Isle of Sheppey.

Historically the north of Kent has always been marshland but has been coming under great pressure by developers. A public inquiry found in favour of a rail freight depot proposed by ProLogis at Howbury in Slade Green. The proposal was to develop part of the Metropolitan Green Belt in the Crayford Marshes beside the existing railway depot. Roxhill Developments Ltd. had sought to modify the planned 149 acre &quot;sustainable distribution park with modern multi modal connections&quot; since at least 2015.

The London Development Agency perceived some strategic merit in the proposals, but local councillors were not convinced that such a depot would truly encourage train movements as an alternative to road haulage. This scepticism arose partly because the railways in the area are heavily used by scheduled passenger trains, to the extent that the projected Crossrail programme seemed unlikely to progress to Dartford unless new tracks were laid to boost local rail capacity. The ProLogis appeal was upheld by a 2007 Public Inquiry on the basis that the proposal supported the Energy policy of the United Kingdom and generated new jobs. Counter-arguments included that eventual warehouse occupiers would not use the site in the manner suggested, that continuous noise levels would exceed WHO Community Noise Guidelines at homes in Moat Lane and that night-time noise levels risked generating complaints from residents at Moat Lane and Oak Road.

The Environment Agency advised that future development in the &quot;Thames Gateway&quot; must go hand-in-hand with flood risk management, and take account of future plans for flood protection. The Agency insisted it was important that effective flood risk management of the whole Estuary be not prejudiced by premature decisions and developments.

The Government addressed some of these environmental concerns by designating the Thames Gateway as the UK&#x27;s &quot;eco-region&quot;, first announced in the 2007 Thames Gateway Delivery Plan. The objective of the &quot;eco-region&quot; was to protect and enhance the sustainability of the &quot;Thames Gateway&quot; in terms of environmental quality, carbon reduction, and support for &quot;green&quot; economic development. This vision was elaborated in the 2008 Thames Gateway &quot;eco-region prospectus&quot;, and implementation efforts were led by the Homes and Communities Agency with support across government and [unspecified] local stakeholders.

<text>A bathyscaphe () is a free-diving, self-propelled deep-sea submersible, consisting of a crew cabin similar to a &quot;Bathysphere&quot;, but suspended below a float rather than from a surface cable, as in the classic &quot;Bathysphere&quot; design.

The float is filled with gasoline because it is readily available, buoyant, and, for all practical purposes, incompressible. The incompressibility of the gasoline means the tanks can be very lightly constructed, since the pressure inside and outside the tanks equalizes, eliminating any differential. By contrast, the crew cabin must withstand a huge pressure differential and is massively built. Buoyancy at the surface can be trimmed easily by replacing gasoline in the tanks with water, because water has a greater density.

Auguste Piccard, inventor of the first bathyscaphe, composed the name &quot;bathyscaphe&quot; using the Ancient Greek words (&#x27;), meaning &quot;deep&quot;, and (&#x27;), meaning &quot;vessel, ship&quot;.

== Mode of operation==

To descend, a bathyscaphe floods air tanks with sea water, but unlike a submarine the water in the flooded tanks cannot be displaced with compressed air to ascend, because the water pressures at the depths for which the craft was designed to operate are too great. For example, the pressure at the bottom of the Challenger Deep is more than seven times that in a standard &quot;H-type&quot; compressed gas cylinder. Instead, ballast in the form of iron shot is released to ascend, the shot being lost to the ocean floor. The iron shot containers are in the form of one or more hoppers which are open at the bottom throughout the dive, the iron shot being held in place by an electromagnet at the neck. This is a fail-safe device as it requires no power to ascend; in fact, in the event of a power failure, shot runs out by gravity and ascent is automatic.

==History of development==

The first bathyscaphe was dubbed &quot;FNRS-2&quot;, named after the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique, and built in Belgium from 1946 to 1948 by Auguste Piccard. (&quot;FNRS-1&quot; had been the balloon used for Piccard&#x27;s ascent into the stratosphere in 1938). Propulsion was provided by battery-driven electric motors. The float held of aviation gasoline. There was no access tunnel; the sphere had to be loaded and unloaded while on deck. The first journeys were detailed in the Jacques Cousteau book &quot;The Silent World&quot;. As described in the book, &quot;the vessel had serenely endured the pressure of the depths, but had been destroyed in a minor squall&quot;. &quot;FNRS-3&quot; was a new submersible, using the crew sphere from the damaged &quot;FNRS-2&quot;, and a new larger float.

Piccard&#x27;s second bathyscaphe was actually a third vessel &quot;Trieste&quot;, which was purchased by the United States Navy from Italy in 1957. It had two water ballast tanks and eleven buoyancy tanks holding of gasoline.

==Accomplishments==

In 1960 &quot;Trieste&quot;, carrying Piccard&#x27;s son Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, reached the deepest known point on the Earth&#x27;s surface, the Challenger Deep, in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean.

The onboard systems indicated a depth of 37,800 ft (11,521 m) but this was later corrected to 35,813 ft (10,916 m) by taking into account variations arising from salinity and temperature. Later and more accurate measurements made in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep to be slightly shallower at 35,798 ft (10,911 m).

The crew of the &quot;Trieste&quot;, which was equipped with a powerful light, noted that the seafloor consisted of diatomaceous ooze and reported observing &quot;some type of flatfish, resembling a sole, about 1 foot long and 6 inches across&quot; (30 by 15 cm) lying on the seabed. This put to rest the question of whether or not there was life at such a depth in the complete absence of light.

<text>The East German uprising of 1953 ( ) was an uprising that occurred in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) from 16 to 17 June 1953. It began with strike action by construction workers in East Berlin on 16 June against work quotas during the Sovietization process in East Germany. Demonstrations in East Berlin turned into a widespread uprising against the Government of East Germany and the ruling Socialist Unity Party the next day, involving over one million people in about 700 localities across the country. Protests against declining living standards and unpopular Sovietization policies led to a wave of strikes and protests that were not easily brought under control and threatened to overthrow the East German government. The uprising in East Berlin was violently suppressed by tanks of the Soviet forces in Germany and the &quot;Kasernierte Volkspolizei.&quot; Demonstrations continued in over 500 towns and villages for several more days before eventually dying out.

The 1953 uprising was celebrated in West Germany as a public holiday on 17 June until German reunification in 1990, after which it was replaced by German Unity Day, celebrated annually on 3 October.

== Background ==
In May 1952, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany or FRG) rejected the &quot;Stalin Note&quot;, a proposal sent by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin offering reunification with the Soviet-backed German Democratic Republic (East Germany or GDR) as an independent and politically neutral Germany. With the heightened anxiety of the Cold War, Stalin&#x27;s proposal was met with intense suspicion in the FRG, which instead signed the European Defence Community Treaty that month. After these developments, it became clear to both the Soviet Union and the GDR that Germany would remain divided indefinitely. In East Berlin, General Secretary Walter Ulbricht of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), the ruling party of the GDR, interpreted Stalin&#x27;s failed attempt at German reunification as a &quot;green light&#x27;&quot; to proceed with the &quot;accelerated construction of socialism in the GDR&quot;, which the party announced at its Second Party Conference in July 1952. This move to Sovietize the GDR consisted of a drastic increase in investment allocated to heavy industry, discriminatory taxation against the last private industrial enterprises, forced collectivization of agriculture and a concerted campaign against religious activity in East Germany.

The result of these changes in the GDR&#x27;s economic direction was the rapid deterioration of workers&#x27; living standards, which continued until the first half of 1953, and represented the first clear downward trend in the living standard of East Germans since the 1947 hunger crisis. Travel costs rose as generous state subsidies were cut, while many consumer goods began to disappear from store shelves. Factories were forced to clamp down on overtime: with restricted budgets, the wage bill was deemed excessively high. Meanwhile, food prices rose as a result of both the state&#x27;s collectivization policy – 40% of the wealthier farmers in the GDR fled to the West, leaving over of otherwise productive land lying fallow – and a poor harvest in 1952. Workers&#x27; cost of living therefore rose, while the take-home pay of large numbers of workers – many of whom depended on overtime pay to make ends meet – diminished. In the winter of 1952–53, there were also serious interruptions to the supply of heat and electricity to East Germany&#x27;s cities. By November 1952, sporadic food riots and industrial unrest occurred in several major GDR industrial centres: Leipzig, Dresden, Halle and Suhl. Industrial unrest continued throughout the following spring, ranging from inflammatory speeches and anti-SED graffiti to alleged sabotage. To ease economic strain on the state caused by the &quot;construction of socialism&quot;, the Politburo decided to increase work quotas on a compulsory basis by 10% across all state-owned factories: that is, workers now had to produce 10% more for the same wage. Additionally, there were increases in prices for food, health care, and public transportation. Taken together, the work quota and price increases amounted to a 33 per cent monthly wage cut.

While Ulbricht&#x27;s response to the consequences of crash Sovietization was to tighten East Germans&#x27; belts, many East Germans&#x27; response was to simply leave the GDR, a phenomenon known as &quot;Republikflucht&quot;. In 1951, 160,000 people left; in 1952, 182,000; in the first four months of 1953, a further 122,000 East Germans left for the West, despite the now-mostly sealed border.

The new collective leadership in the Soviet Union, established following Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953, was shocked by these disconcerting statistics when it received in early April a report from the Soviet Control Commission in Germany which provided a detailed, devastating account of the East German economic situation. By 2 June, the Soviet Union leadership issued an order &quot;On Measures to Improve the Health of the Political Situation in the GDR&quot;, in which the SED&#x27;s policy of accelerated construction of socialism was roundly criticised. The huge flight of all professions and backgrounds from East Germany to the West had created &quot;a serious threat to the political stability of the German Democratic Republic.&quot; To salvage the situation, it was now necessary to end forced collectivisation and the war on private enterprise. The Five-Year Plan now needed to be changed at the expense of heavy industry and in favour of consumer goods. Political-judicial controls and regimentation had to be relaxed, and coercive measures against the Protestant Church had to cease. In addition, Ulbricht&#x27;s &quot;cold exercise of power&quot; was denounced. However, there was no explicit demand to reverse the highly unpopular increased work quotas. The Soviet decree was given to SED leaders Walter Ulbricht and Otto Grotewohl on 2 June, the day they landed in Moscow. Soviet Premier Georgy Malenkov warned them that changes were essential to avoid a catastrophe in East Germany. 
On 9 June, the SED&#x27;s Politburo met and determined how to respond to the Soviet leadership&#x27;s instructions. Although most Politburo members felt the announcement of the &quot;New Course&quot; required careful preparation within the party and the population at large, Soviet High Commissioner for Germany Vladimir Semyonov insisted it be implemented right away. Thus, the SED fatefully published the New Course programme in &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot;, the official party newspaper of the SED, on 11 June. The communiqué dutifully criticised the mistakes made by the SED and announced that most of Ulbricht&#x27;s Sovietization campaign would now be reversed, as instructed by Moscow. There was now going to be a shift towards investment in consumer goods; the pressures on small private enterprise would end; forced collectivisation would cease; and policies against religious activity would be discontinued. But, crucially, the work quota increase was not revoked, representing a threat to the legitimacy of a Marxist-Leninist state that claimed to represent its workers: the bourgeoisie and farmers stood to benefit far more from the New Course than the proletariat. The communiqué and its forthright admission of past mistakes shocked and confused many East Germans, both SED members and the wider populace. Disappointment, disbelief and confusion pervaded local party organisations, whose members felt panicked and betrayed. The wider populace viewed the New Course as a sign of weakness on the part of the East German regime.

On 12 June, the next day, 5,000 people participated in a demonstration in front of Brandenburg-Görden Prison in Brandenburg an der Havel.

On 15 June, workers at the Stalinallee &quot;Block 40&quot; site in East Berlin, now with higher hopes about the cancellation of increased work quotas, dispatched a delegation to East German Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl to deliver a petition calling for their revocation. Grotewohl ignored the workers&#x27; demands.

== Uprising ==

=== 16 June ===

An article in the trade union paper &quot;Tribune&quot; restated the necessity of the 10% work quota increases; evidently, the government was unwilling to retreat on the issue, despite the new quotas&#x27; widespread unpopularity.

At 9:00 AM on the morning of 16 June, 300 workers from the construction sites at &quot;Hospital Friedrichshain&quot; and &quot;Stalinallee Block 40&quot; in East Berlin went on strike and marched on the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB) headquarters on Wallstrasse, then to the city centre, hoisting banners and demanding a reinstatement of the old work quotas. Demands from the striking workers broadened to encompass political matters beyond the quotas. Via Alexanderplatz and Unter den Linden, most of the demonstrators moved to the government seat on Leipziger Straße; others went to SED headquarters on Wilhelm-Pieck-Straße. En route, they took over two sound trucks and used them to spread their calls for a general strike and a demonstration, set for the Strausberger Platz at 7:00 AM the next day. In front of the GDR House of Ministries, the rapidly growing crowd demanded to speak to Ulbricht and Grotewohl. Only Heavy Industry Minister Fritz Selbmann and Professor Robert Havemann, president of the GDR Peace Council, emerged from the building. Their attempts to calm the workers were drowned out by the clamour of the crowd, which shouted the pair down.

Meanwhile, the Politburo deliberated, unable to decide what to do. Despite the urgency of the situation, it was only after hours of discussion – under the pressure of the demonstrators, and probably also from Semyonov – that the leadership decided to revoke the work quota increase. The Politburo members decreed that increases in productivity would now be voluntary, and blamed the strikes and demonstrations on how the increases had been implemented, but also on foreign provocateurs. However, by the time an SED functionary reached the House of Ministries to give the workers the news, the protestors&#x27; agenda had expanded well beyond the issue of work increases. Later that afternoon, the crowd dispersed and workers returned to their sites. Save for isolated clashes between the &quot;Volkspolizei&quot; and groups of demonstrators, the rest of the day was calm. The SED leadership was surprised by the depth of resentment and the extent of anti-regime actions. Indeed, the SED leadership was so out of touch that it expected a massive propaganda drive would be sufficient to cope with the emerging crisis. It would clearly not be enough, and Ulbricht probably realised this only a few hours after the suggestion was made. The Soviet authorities were likewise completely taken aback by the widespread protests that followed the demonstrations in East Berlin. Their response was improvised and uncoordinated. Later that evening, Semyonov met with the SED leadership and informed them of his decision to send Soviet troops to Berlin.

Throughout the night of 16 June and early morning of 17 June, news of events in East Berlin spread quickly throughout the GDR via word of mouth and Western radio broadcasts, particularly Radio in the American Sector (RIAS), which had been broadcasting throughout the day about the strikes staged against increased work quotas. In the afternoon, there were broadcasts about the change in demonstrator demands from the repeal of the higher work quotas and price cuts to shouts of &quot;We want free elections&quot;. RIAS was later approached by East Berlin workers seeking its assistance in disseminating their call for a general strike the next day. RIAS&#x27;s political director, Gordon Ewing, decided that the station could not directly lend itself to being a mouthpiece to the workers; in his view, such a move could start a war. The station would not actively incite rebellion but simply broadcast information about the demonstrations, factually and comprehensively. Nonetheless, at 7.30 PM, RIAS reported that a delegation of construction workers had submitted a resolution for publication, stating that the strikers, having proved by their actions that &quot;they were able to force the government to accept their justified demands&quot;, would &quot;make use of their power at any time&quot; if their demands for lower work quotas, price cuts, free elections and amnesty for all demonstrators were not fulfilled. Later that night, the station all but provided active encouragement to demonstrate against the regime. RIAS Programme Director Eberhard Schutz called the regime&#x27;s reversal on the work quotas question &quot;a victory, which our Ostberliners share with the entire working population of the Soviet Zone.&quot; Schutz attributed the government&#x27;s U-turn to the workers&#x27; actions. He said that listeners&#x27; demands – i.e., the resignation of the government, Western-style liberties, etc. – were justified, and encouraged them to support the demonstrators. Schutz said that RIAS and the East German people expected these demands to be met: it was the East German people&#x27;s task to show the SED and the Soviet Communist Party that this was true.

Following West Germany&#x27;s Federal Minister for All-German Questions Jakob Kaiser&#x27;s admonition in a late night broadcast to East Germans to shy away from provocations, RIAS, starting with its 11 PM news broadcast, and from then on in hourly broadcasts, repeated the workers&#x27; demand to continue the strike the next day, calling specifically for all East Berliners to participate in a demonstration at 7:00 AM on the 17th at Strausberger Platz.

=== 17 June ===

==== East Berlin ====

Following Semyonov&#x27;s decision, Soviet troops entered the environs of East Berlin in the early morning of 17 June. Meanwhile, crowds of workers began to gather at Strausberger Platz and other public places, and began marching towards the city centre. En route, they encountered GDR security forces – regular and (&#x27;Barracked People&#x27;s Police&#x27;, KVP) units – who, apparently lacking instructions, did not initially intervene. Along with SED and FDJ functionaries, police officials tried – and mostly failed – to convince the marchers to return to their homes and workplaces. Where police attempted to halt or disperse the crowds, they rapidly ended up on the defensive. As the demonstrators drew in ever-greater numbers, a feeling of solidarity swept over them. Loudspeaker cars and bicycles provided communications between the different columns of marchers from the outer districts as, all morning, they converged on the city centre. On improvised banners and posters, the demonstrators again demanded the reinstatement of the old work quotas, but also price decreases, the release of fellow protestors arrested the day before, even free and fair all-German elections. Slogans like &quot;down with the government!&quot; and &quot;butter, not arms&quot; were also visible. Party posters and statues – especially those depicting SED and Soviet leaders – were burned or defaced.

By 9:00 AM, 25,000 people had gathered in front of the House of Ministries, and tens of thousands more were en route to Leipziger Strasse or in Potsdamer Platz. Between 10:00 and 11:00 AM, 80 to 100 demonstrators apparently stormed the government seat, visibly demonstrating that the 500 &quot;Volkspolizei&quot; and Stasi members had been overpowered. Then, suddenly, Soviet military vehicles appeared, followed by tanks, to repel what appeared to be an immiment takeover. Within an hour, Soviet troops had cleared and isolated the area around the government headquarters. At noon, Soviet authorities terminated all tram and metro traffic into the Eastern sector and all but closed the sector borders to West Berlin to prevent more demonstrators from reaching the city centre. An hour later, they declared martial law in East Berlin. Outside East Berlin police headquarters, Soviet tanks opened fire on &quot;the insurgents&quot;. Fighting between the Soviet Army (and later GDR police) and the demonstrators persisted into the afternoon and night – with, in some cases, tanks and troops firing directly into the crowds. Executions, most prominently of West Berlin worker Willi Gottling, and mass arrests followed.

Overnight, the Soviets and the Stasi started to arrest hundreds of people. Ultimately, up to 10,000 people were detained and at least 32, probably as many as 40, were executed, including Soviet Army soldiers who refused to obey orders. With the SED leadership effectively paralysed at the Soviet headquarters in Karlshorst, control of East Berlin passed to the Soviets there.

==== Outside of East Berlin ====

Each of East Germany&#x27;s 24 cities with a population greater than 50,000 experienced upheavals, as did approximately 80% of the towns with populations between 10,000 and 50,000. Approximately 339,000 people participated in the 129 demonstrations that took place outside of Berlin; over 225,000 launched strikes in 332 factories. The main centres of protest included the industrial region around Halle, Merseburg, and Bitterfeld, as well as middle-size towns like Jena, Görlitz, and Brandenburg. No more than 25,000 people participated in strikes and demonstrations in Leipzig, but there were 32,000 in Magdeburg, 43,000 in Dresden, 53,000 in Potsdam – and in Halle, close to 100,000.

At first, such demonstrations were relatively peaceful, but as increasing numbers began to participate, they became more violent. Looting, particularly of SED-owned shops, became a regular occurrence; there was some arson, and many SED functionaries were beaten up later in the day. In some towns, the jails were seized by demonstrators, who demanded the release of certain political prisoners. In Görlitz a group of 30,000 people destroyed the communist party headquarters, the offices of the secret police and the prison, while in Magdeburg the party headquarters and prison were set on fire. When the Soviet Army intervened in these places outside of East Berlin, they seemed more restrained and more passive; some Soviet soldiers even displayed friendly attitudes towards demonstrators.

In the countryside, meanwhile, protests took place in over 200 villages. However, many East German farmers did not take collective action against the regime: the most common expression of protest in rural areas was for farmers to leave and/or dissolve recently formed collective farms and resume farming on their own.

Although the demands made by protesters could be political – e.g. the dissolution of the East German government and organisation of free elections – they were often simply of a local and economic character. They were about issues like bread shortages, unpopular night shifts, even the number of toilets in the workplace and the fact that tea was being served in rusty urns. Also expressed were widely held grievances against the intelligentsia, who were perceived to enjoy &#x27;unfair privileges&#x27;, such as special deliveries of basic foodstuffs and other commodities.

Others, particularly workers, demanded the restoration of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in East Germany. Among former social democrats, there existed enormous bitterness against Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl, ex-leader of the East German SPD, whom they believed had &quot;betrayed the SPD&quot; by leading its merger with the rival German Communist Party to form the ruling SED in 1946. The Soviet Military Administration (SVAG) had pressured Grotewohl into the merger to protect communist rule in East Germany after the surprisingly poor performance of communist parties in elections in Hungary and Austria in November 1945. Grotewohl was &quot;rewarded&quot; with the post of Prime Minister, but within a few years the SED had significantly reduced his powers and turned the office into a mostly ceremonial role. Many East German social democrats viewed Grotewohl as a traitor who should &quot;have his neck wrung.&quot;

There were Nazi elements involved in the protests, though seldom as ringleaders. Walls, bridges and school blackboards were defaced with Nazi slogans and swastikas, and in some places, Nazi songs were sung at demonstrations. A significant minority of Germans still clung to ideas of Nazism.

== Aftermath ==
Widespread protests and demonstrations continued for days after 17 June and, according to the GDR security service, the situation had only calmed down 24 June. Deutsche Welle claims a confirmed fatality figure of 55 civilians. A declassified report authored by Andrei Grechko, chief of Soviet Forces in East Germany, claimed a total casualty figure of 209 by 18 June, Newer estimates claim a death toll of at least 125 by the end of the uprising.

Many workers lost faith in East Germany&#x27;s socialist state following the uprising, disgusted by the violent suppression of the strikes. The fact that the Volkspolizei had shot at workers – that workers had shot their own kind – led to the loss of large numbers of SED members. Throughout the &quot;bezirke&quot; of Leipzig and Karl-Marx-Stadt, hundreds of SED members, many of whom had spent decades in the labour movement, left the party. At the Textima plant in Altenberg, 450 SED members had left the party by 7 July – most of them workers, many of whom had much experience in the labour movement. There was also a widespread refusal by workers to pay their trade union dues: they ceased to financially support and confer legitimacy upon the party.

=== Ulbricht survives ===
By the time the Politburo met on 8 July, it seemed that Ulbricht&#x27;s time as party leader was coming to an end. Minister of State Security Wilhelm Zaisser conceded that the entire Politburo was responsible for the &quot;accelerated construction of socialism&quot; and its disastrous fallout, but added that leaving Ulbricht as leader &quot;would be opposed [as] catastrophic for the New Course.&quot; By the end of the meeting, just two Politburo members supported Ulbricht&#x27;s continued leadership: Free German Youth League chief Erich Honecker and Party Control Commission Chairman Hermann Matern. Ulbricht only managed to forestall a decision with a promise to make a statement at the forthcoming 15th SED CC Plenum, scheduled later that month.

The leading Soviet officials in East Berlin – Semyonov, Pavel Yudin and Vasily Sokolovsky – had reached the same conclusions in a report describing and analysing the events of 17–19 June, submitted to Moscow two weeks earlier on 24 June. In a self-serving report which sought to play down the culpability of the Soviet Commission in East Berlin and emphasise the responsibility of Ulbricht for the uprising, they concluded – &quot;inter alia&quot; – that Ulbricht&#x27;s position as General Secretary of the SED should be terminated, and that the party would move towards collective leadership, in addition to other far-reaching structural political changes in East Berlin. However, the situation in Moscow dramatically changed just two days later, on 26 June, when Soviet Security Chief Lavrentiy Beria was arrested. On 2 July, when a commission met there to discuss proposals for reform in East Germany, the decision was made to shelve the far-reaching and politically sensitive changes. The Soviet leadership, preoccupied with the Beria affair and its internal implications, became disinclined to rock the East German boat and more inclined to the &quot;status quo&quot;: maintaining power in East Germany by supporting an experienced, reliable, albeit Stalinist and unpopular, ruler.

In late July, Ulbricht, ever more certain of his continued backing in Moscow, expelled his main opponents, Zaisser, Hernstadt and Ackermann, from the Politburo, further strengthening his position.

By late August, Moscow had committed to shoring up the existing East German regime with Ulbricht in charge. By then, the situation in East Germany had stabilised thanks to new economic measures implemented by Moscow and East Berlin, and the dropping of major political changes in the GDR from the agenda. Substantial economic and financial aid was to flow into East Germany and reparation payments were to cease by the end of the year. Additional prisoners of war would be freed and Moscow&#x27;s mission in East Berlin was elevated to the status of embassy. Ultimately, Ulbricht&#x27;s position was firmly secured once more.

=== Impact on the long-term development of the GDR ===
According to historian Corey Ross, the SED party leadership derived two key lessons from 17 June.

The first was its increased concern over shop floor discontent and greater determination to preclude it from escalating into broader conflict. Factory surveillance was raised to better monitor the mood of the workforce, the Combat Groups of the Working Class was established as an on-the-spot force to prevent or quell any signs of unrest, and the Stasi was expanded and improved upon to swiftly deal with any signs of organised protest in the future.

The second was that a heavy-handed venture such as the &quot;accelerated construction of socialism&quot; could never again be embarked upon. Ulbricht was haunted throughout the 1950s by the specter of another uprising, and the government never again attempted to introduce arbitrary, blanket work quota increases like those of May and June 1953. The &quot;New Course&quot; policies – increased investment in consumer goods, housing and price and travel subventions – led to an improvement in living standards overall but failed to achieve an immediate end to the discontent that had been growing over the past year.

Protestors, meanwhile, learned that little could be gained from open confrontation – to act openly against the SED regime in large numbers was to be left to their own devices by the West against repression from the East German police and Soviet military.

== Legacy ==
In memory of the 1953 East German uprising, West Germany established the Day of German Unity as an annual national holiday on 17 June. Upon German reunification in October 1990, the holiday was moved to 3 October, the date of formal reunification. The extension of the &quot;Unter den Linden&quot; boulevard to the west of the Brandenburg Gate, called &quot;Charlottenburger Chaussee&quot;, was renamed &quot;Straße des 17. Juni&quot; (&quot;17 June Street&quot;) following the 1953 rebellion.

The uprising is commemorated in &quot;Die Lösung&quot;, a poem by Bertolt Brecht. Other prominent GDR authors who dealt with the uprising include Stefan Heym (&quot;Fünf Tage im Juni&quot; / &quot;Five Days in June&quot;, Munich 1974) and Heiner Müller (&quot;Wolokolamsker Chaussee III: Das Duell&quot; / &quot;Volokolamsk Highway III: The Duel&quot;, 1985/86).

West German band Alphaville mention &quot;the seventeenth of June&quot;, without referencing the year, in their 1984 song &quot;Summer in Berlin&quot;, from their &quot;Forever Young&quot; album. When the compilation album &quot;Alphaville Amiga Compilation&quot; was assembled for release in East Germany in 1988, the song &quot;Summer in Berlin&quot; was submitted for inclusion, but rejected &quot;for political reasons.&quot;

The 1966 Günter Grass play &quot;The Plebeians Rehearse the Uprising&quot; depicts Brecht preparing a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Coriolanus&quot; against the background of the events of 1953.

<doc id="301719" wikidata="Q646988" url="?curid=301719" title="Ancient astronauts">
<text>Ancient astronauts (or ancient aliens) refers to a pseudoscientific set of beliefs that hold that intelligent extraterrestrial beings (alien astronauts) visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity and prehistoric times. Proponents of the theory suggest that this contact influenced the development of modern cultures, technologies, religions, and human biology. A common position is that deities from most (if not all) religions are extraterrestrial in origin, and that advanced technologies brought to Earth by ancient astronauts were interpreted as evidence of divine status by early humans.

The idea that ancient astronauts existed and visited Earth is not taken seriously by academics and archaeologists, who identify such claims as pseudoarchaeological or unscientific. It has received no credible attention in peer-reviewed studies. When proponents of the idea present evidence in favor of their beliefs, it is often distorted or fabricated. Some authors and scholars also argue that ancient astronaut theories have racist undertones or implications, diminishing the accomplishments and capabilities of indigenous cultures.

Well-known proponents of these beliefs in the latter half of the 20th century who have written numerous books or appear regularly in mass media include Robert Charroux, Jacques Bergier, Jean Sendy, Erich von Däniken, Alexander Kazantsev, Zecharia Sitchin, Robert K. G. Temple, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, David Hatcher Childress, Peter Kolosimo, and Mauro Biglino.

== Overview ==

Various terms are used to reference claims about ancient astronauts, such as ancient aliens, ancient ufonauts, ancient space pilots, paleocontact, astronaut- or alien gods, or paleo- or biblical-SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence).

Believers in such ancient astronaut stories often maintain that all or some humans are either descendants or creations of extraterrestrial intelligence who landed on Earth at some point in the ancient past. An associated idea is that human knowledge, religion, and culture came from extraterrestrial visitors in ancient times, in that ancient astronauts acted as a &quot;mother culture&quot;. Additionally, proponents often claim that travelers from outer space built many of the structures on Earth (such as Egyptian pyramids and the Moai stone heads of Easter Island) or aided humans in building them. Proponents contend that the evidence for ancient astronauts comes from documentary gaps in historical and archaeological records while citing archaeological artifacts that they believe, contrary to the mainstream explanations, are anachronistic and supposedly beyond the technical capabilities of the people who made them. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;out-of-place artifacts&quot;; and include artwork and legends which believers reinterpret to fit stories of extraterrestrial contact or technologies.

As a pseudoarcheology, the idea receives notice in fringe pulp media, such as the History Channel series &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot;. Such shows use a strategy known as &#x27;fire-hosing’ to co-mingle fact with fiction in order to spread theories of an alternate past with tropes that follow white supremacist, nativist, imperialist, settler-colonial, and Christian Identity beliefs relevant to the past. The celebrity proponents of ancient aliens profess to be a part of an oppressed minority of academics that &#x27;big archaeology&#x27; is conspiring to disenfranchise while their identity of being a maverick or a rogue aligns with the individuals&#x27; lack of credentials.

Like archaeological endeavors of the criticized past, these proponents focus primarily on monumental archaeological structures claiming they could have only been constructed with extraterrestrial intervention. The implication is that the non-white Indigenous people in the regions in which these monuments appear could not have built them on their own. However, Dakota/Lakota Sioux writer Ruth H. Burns, in &quot;Atmos&quot; magazine, counters that ancient alien theory and the idea of extraterrestrials in general supports the viewpoints of indigenous, non-European peoples. She believes the denial of extraterrestrial encounters and indigenous peoples’ stories tracing their origins to extraterrestrials is part of “Indigenous erasure,” as it minimizes or completely discounts the viewpoints of indigenous peoples. Many indigenous peoples trace their ancestry to “star-people” or the like—extraterrestrials who as the progenitors of indigenous peoples cannot by definition be white or “Aryan.”

A common feature in the stories portray the aliens as light-skinned or Aryan in complexion, as prominent alien astronaut proponent Erich von Däniken claims in his foundational work &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; Some ancient astronaut proponents are thus associated with white supremacism, although their theories are sometimes applied to European cultures as well.

These claims are so outlandish that up until recently, mainstream archaeologists essentially ignored them as absurdities. The few dedicated popular science explainers and skeptics who did offer opinions on the ideas universally panned them. For example, Carl Sagan wrote, &quot;In the long litany of &#x27;ancient astronaut&#x27; pop archaeology, the cases of apparent interest have perfectly reasonable alternative explanations, or have been misreported, or are simple prevarications, hoaxes and distortions&quot;.

== History of ancient aliens beliefs and their proponents ==
Paleocontact or &quot;ancient astronaut&quot; narratives first appeared in the early science fiction of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the 1898 novel &quot;Edison&#x27;s Conquest of Mars&quot; and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. The idea was proposed in earnest by journalist Harold T. Wilkins in 1954. It grew in popularity in the 1960s, mainly due to the Space Race and the success of Erich von Däniken&#x27;s works, although it also received limited consideration as a serious hypothesis. Critics emerged throughout the 1970s, discrediting Von Däniken&#x27;s claims. Ufologists separated the idea from the UFO controversy. By the early 1980s little remaining support could be found.

=== Shklovskii and Sagan ===

 Carl Sagan co-authored a widely popular book &quot;Intelligent Life in the Universe&quot;, with Soviet astrophysicist Iosif Shklovsky and published in 1966. In his 1979 book &quot;Broca&#x27;s Brain&quot;, Sagan suggested that he and Shklovsky might have inspired the wave of 1970s ancient astronaut books, expressing disapproval of &quot;von Däniken and other uncritical writers&quot; who seemingly built on these ideas not as guarded speculations but as &quot;valid evidence of extraterrestrial contact.&quot; Sagan pointed out that while many legends, artifacts, and purported out-of-place artifacts were cited in support of ancient astronaut hypotheses, &quot;very few require more than passing mention&quot; and could be easily explained with more conventional hypotheses. Sagan also reiterated his earlier conclusion that extraterrestrial visits to Earth were possible but unproven and improbable.

=== Erich von Däniken ===

Erich von Däniken was a leading proponent of this hypothesis in the late 1960s and early 1970s, gaining a large audience through the 1968 publication of his best-selling book &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; and its sequels.

According to von Däniken, certain artifacts require a more sophisticated technological ability in their construction than that which was available to the ancient cultures who constructed them. Von Däniken maintains that these artifacts were constructed either directly by extraterrestrial visitors or by humans who learned the necessary knowledge from said visitors. These include Stonehenge, Pumapunku, the Moai of Easter Island, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the ancient Baghdad electric batteries.
Von Däniken writes that ancient art and iconography throughout the world illustrates air and space vehicles, non-human but intelligent creatures, ancient astronauts, and artifacts of an anachronistically advanced technology. Von Däniken also states that geographically separated historical cultures share artistic themes, which he argues imply a common origin. One such example is von Däniken&#x27;s interpretation of the sarcophagus lid recovered from the tomb of the Classic-era Maya ruler of Palenque, Pacal the Great. Von Däniken writes that the design represented a seated astronaut. The iconography and accompanying Maya text, however, identifies it as a portrait of the ruler himself with the World Tree of Maya mythology.

The origins of many religions are interpreted by von Däniken as reactions to encounters with an alien race. According to his view, humans considered the technology of the aliens to be supernatural and the aliens themselves to be gods. Von Däniken states that the oral and written traditions of most religions contain references to alien visitors in the way of descriptions of stars and vehicular objects traveling through air and space. One such is Ezekiel&#x27;s revelation, which Däniken interprets as a detailed description of a landing spacecraft (&quot;The Spaceships of Ezekiel&quot;).

Von Däniken&#x27;s hypotheses became popularized in the U.S. after the NBC-TV documentary &quot;In Search of Ancient Astronauts&quot; hosted by Rod Serling, and the film &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot;.

Critics argue that von Däniken misrepresented data, that many of his claims were unfounded, and that none of his core claims have been validated. In particular the Christian creationist community is highly critical of most of von Däniken&#x27;s work. Young Earth creationist author Clifford A. Wilson published &quot;Crash Go the Chariots&quot; in 1972 in which he attempted to discredit all the claims made in &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot;.

In &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot;, regarding the Nazca Lines, von Däniken states that &quot;Seen from the air, the clear-cut impression that the 60 km [37-mile] long plain of Nazca made on me was that of an airfield.&quot; Considering he was in the process of seeking evidence of ancient aliens, von Däniken exhibits confirmation bias, as he does not consider the Nazca Lines to be man-made until after the publication of &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; This etic perspective that he presents could be easily accepted by a reader familiar with air travel, and an undeveloped knowledge of the nature of the geoglyphs. Furthermore, since the majority of readers of &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; are not educated in viewing artifacts from ancient civilizations, their interpretations are highly subject to von Däniken&#x27;s opinions of the artifacts. Kenneth L. Feder argues a reader seeing the Nazca Lines for the first time in a book about aliens would be much more likely to associate those features with extraterrestrial origins, rather than from a civilization that existed on Earth.

In 1970, von Däniken admitted that the Nazca markings &quot;could have been laid out on their gigantic scale by working from a model using a system of coordinates.&quot;

=== Zecharia Sitchin ===

Zecharia Sitchin&#x27;s series &quot;The Earth Chronicles&quot;, beginning with &quot;The 12th Planet&quot;, revolves around Sitchin&#x27;s unique interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts from around the world. He hypothesizes that the gods of old Mesopotamia were astronauts from the planet &quot;Nibiru&quot;, which Sitchin states the Sumerians believed to be a remote &quot;12th planet&quot; (counting the Sun, Moon, and Pluto as planets) associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru continues to orbit the Sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit. Modern astronomy has found no evidence to support Sitchin&#x27;s ideas.

Sitchin argues that there are Sumerian texts that tell the story that 50 Anunnaki, inhabitants of a planet named Nibiru, came to Earth approximately 400,000 years ago with the intent of mining raw materials, especially gold, for transport back to Nibiru. With their small numbers they soon grew tired of the task and set out to genetically engineer laborers to work the mines. After much trial and error they eventually created &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot;: the &quot;Adapa&quot; (model man) or Adam of later mythology. Sitchin contended the Anunnaki were active in human affairs until their culture was destroyed by global catastrophes caused by the abrupt end of the last ice age some 12,000 years ago. Seeing that humans survived and all they had built was destroyed, the Anunnaki left Earth after giving humans the opportunity and means to govern themselves. Sitchin&#x27;s work has not received mainstream scholarly support and has been roundly criticized by professionals that have reviewed his hypotheses. Semitic languages scholar Michael S. Heiser says that many of Sitchin&#x27;s translations of Sumerian and Mesopotamian words are not consistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform bilingual dictionaries, produced by ancient Akkadian scribes.

Alan F. Alford, author of &quot;Gods of the New Millennium&quot; (1996), was an adherent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis. Much of his work draws on Sitchin&#x27;s hypotheses. However, he now finds fault with Sitchin&#x27;s hypothesis after deeper analysis, stating that: &quot;I am now firmly of the opinion that these gods personified the falling sky; in other words, the descent of the gods was a poetic rendition of the cataclysm myth which stood at the heart of ancient Near Eastern religions.&quot;

=== Robert Temple ===

Robert K. G. Temple&#x27;s 1976 book, &quot;The Sirius Mystery, &quot;argues that the Dogon people of northwestern Mali preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He quotes various lines of evidence, including advanced astronomical knowledge inherited by the tribe, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations such as ancient Egypt and Sumer. His work draws heavily on the studies of cultural anthropologists Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen.

His conclusions have been criticized by scientists, who point out discrepancies within Temple&#x27;s account, and suggested that the Dogon may have received some of their astronomical information recently, probably from European sources, and may have misrepresented Dogon ethnography.

=== UFO religions ===

Various new religious movements including some branches of Theosophy, Scientology, Raëlism, Aetherius Society, and Heaven&#x27;s Gate believe in ancient and present-day contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Many of these faiths see both ancient scriptures and recent revelations as connected with the action of aliens from other planetary systems. Psychologists have found that UFO religions have similarities which suggest that members of these groups consciously or subliminally associate enchantment with the memes of science fiction.

== Claims of proponents ==

Among scientists, the consensus is that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is not impossible, but unjustified and unnecessary. The &quot;mysteries&quot; cited as evidence for the hypothesis can be explained without having to invoke ancient astronauts; proponents look for mysteries where none exist. Since ancient astronauts are unnecessary, Occam&#x27;s razor should be applied and the hypothesis rejected according to the scientific consensus.

=== Ancient religious texts ===
Proponents cite ancient mythologies to support their viewpoints based on the idea that ancient creation myths of gods who descend from the heavens to Earth to create or instruct humanity are representations of alien visitors, whose superior technology accounts for their perception as gods. Proponents draw an analogy to occurrences in modern time when isolated cultures are exposed to advanced technology, such as when, in the early 20th century, &quot;cargo cults&quot; were discovered in the South Pacific: cultures who believed various Western ships and their cargo to be sent from the gods as fulfillment of prophecies concerning their return.

The ancient Sumerian myth of &quot;Enûma Eliš&quot;, inscribed on cuneiform tablets and part of the Library of Ashurbanipal, says humankind was created to serve gods called the &quot;Annunaki&quot;. Hypothesis proponents believe that the Annunaki were aliens who came to Earth to mine gold for their own uses. According to the hypothesis proponents, the Annunaki realized mining gold was taking a toll on their race, and then created the human race as slaves.

==== &quot;Ramayana&quot; ====

In Hindu mythology, the gods and their avatars travel from place to place in flying vehicles called Vimana. There are many mentions of these flying objects in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, which used by the Lankan king Ravana from Sri Lanka dates to the 5th or 4th century BCE. Below are some examples:

From Book 6, Canto CXXIII: The Magic Car:
&lt;poem&gt;Is not the wondrous chariot mine,

Named Pushpak, wrought by hands divine.
This chariot, kept with utmost care,
Will waft thee through the fields of air,
And thou shalt light unwearied down

In fair Ayodhyá&#x27;s royal town.&lt;/poem&gt;

From Book 6, Canto CXXIV: The Departure:
&lt;poem&gt;Swift through the air, as Ráma chose,

The wondrous car from earth arose.
And decked with swans and silver wings

Bore through the clouds its freight of kings.&lt;/poem&gt;

Erich von Däniken discusses the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;vimanas&quot; in Chapter 6 of &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; suggesting that they were &quot;space vehicles&quot;. To support his hypothesis, he offers a quotation which he says is from an 1889 translation of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; by C. Roy: &quot;Bhima flew with his Vimana on an enormous ray which was as brilliant as the sun and made a noise like the thunder of a storm&quot;.

==== The Bible ====

===== Book of Genesis and Book of Enoch =====
The Book of Genesis, Chapter 6 verses 1–2 and 4, states:
Many Christians consider these groups to be the different families of Adam and Eve&#x27;s children. Another interpretation is that the Nephilim are the children of the &quot;sons of God&quot; and &quot;daughters of humans&quot;, although scholars are uncertain. The King James Version translates &quot;Nephilim&quot; as &quot;giants&quot; (or Gibborim). Ancient Astronaut proponents argue that Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden fruit in order &quot;to be godlike&quot;, and this was the first step in human evolution.

The first part of the apocryphal Book of Enoch expands and interprets Genesis 6:1: that the &quot;sons of God&quot; were a group of 200 &quot;angels&quot; called &quot;Watchers&quot;, who descended to Earth to breed with humans. Their offspring are the Nephilim, &quot;giants&quot; who &quot;consumed all the acquisitions of men&quot;. When humans could no longer sustain the Nephilim, they turned against humanity. The Watchers also instructed humans in metallurgy and metalworking, cosmetics, sorcery, astrology, astronomy, and meteorology. God then ordered the Watchers to be imprisoned in the ground, and created the Great Flood (or the numerous Deluge myths) to rid Earth of the Nephilim and of the humans given knowledge by the Watchers. To ensure humanity&#x27;s survival, Noah is forewarned of the oncoming destruction. Because they disobeyed God, the book describes the Watchers as &quot;fallen angels&quot;.

Some ancient astronaut proponents argue that this story is a historical account of extraterrestrials visiting Earth, called Watchers because their mission was to observe humanity. Some of the extraterrestrials disobeyed orders; they made contact with humans, cross-bred with human females, and shared knowledge with them. The Nephilim were thus half-human-half-extraterrestrial hybrids.

Chuck Missler and Mark Eastman argue that modern UFOs carry the fallen angels, or offspring of fallen angels, and that &quot;Noah&#x27;s genealogy was not tarnished by the intrusion of fallen angels. It seems that this adulteration of the human gene pool was a major problem on the planet earth&quot;.

Von Däniken also suggests that the two angels who visited Lot in Genesis 19 were ancient astronauts, who used atomic weapons to destroy the city of Sodom.

Marc Dem reinterprets the Book of Genesis by writing that humanity started on another planet and that the God of the Bible is an extraterrestrial.

===== Book of Ezekiel =====

Chapter 1 of the Book of Ezekiel recounts a vision in which Ezekiel sees &quot;an immense cloud&quot; that contains fire and emits lightning and &quot;brilliant light&quot;. Within the cloud, the passage describes cherubim and ophanim:

In Chapter 4 of &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot;, entitled &quot;Was God an Astronaut?&quot;, von Däniken suggests that Ezekiel had seen a spaceship or spaceships; this hypothesis had been put forward by Morris Jessup in 1956 and by Arthur W. Orton in 1961. A detailed version of this hypothesis was described by Josef F. Blumrich in his book &quot;The Spaceships of Ezekiel&quot; (1974).

===== Elsewhere in the Bible =====
The characteristics of the Ark of the Covenant and the Urim and Thummim have been said to suggest high technology, perhaps from alien origins.

Robert Dione and Paul Misraki published books in the 1960s describing the events in the Bible as caused by alien technology. Barry Downing, a Presbyterian minister, wrote a book in 1968 arguing that Jesus was an extraterrestrial, citing John 8:23 and other biblical verses as evidence.

Some ancient astronaut proponents such as Von Däniken and Barry Downing believe that the concept of hell in the Bible could be a real description of the planet Venus brought to Earth by extraterrestrials showing photos of the hot surface on Venus to humans. Proponents of the hypothesis state that &#x27;God&#x27; and &#x27;Satan&#x27; were aliens that disagreed on whether or not human beings should be allowed the information that is offered by the tree of knowledge. David Childress, a leading proponent of ancient astronaut creation hypothesis, compares this story to the Greek tale of Prometheus, who gave mankind the knowledge of fire. Ancient Astronaut proponents believe the biblical concept of Satan is based on a misunderstood visit by extraterrestrials. Erich von Däniken posited that the descendants of extraterrestrials had children with hominids, and this was referred to in the Bible as the &quot;Original sin.&quot; Von Däniken believes that the biblical great flood was punishment after an extraterrestrial &#x27;God&#x27; discovered that earthbound, fallen angels were mating with ape-like early humans.

====The Book of Invasions====
Childress and others have written that the passage in the &quot;Book of Invasions&quot; describing the arrival of the Tuatha Dé Danann in Ireland, records &quot;the arrival of aliens in spacecraft with cloaking devices&quot; at Slieve Anierin. The text states &quot;so that they were the Tuatha De Danand who came to Ireland. In this wise they came, in dark clouds. They landed on the mountains of Conmaicne Rein in Connacht and they brought a darkness over the sun for three days and three nights&quot;.

=== Ancient artwork ===
==== Worldwide petroglyphic evidence ====
Ancient astronaut proponents believe Hopi cave drawings of Kachinas (spirit beings) found in the desert link the origins of the Hopi and Zuni tribes with &quot;star people&quot;. They point to similar etchings elsewhere as evidence that extraterrestrials visited many different ancient civilizations.

Other artistic support for the ancient astronaut hypothesis has been sought in Palaeolithic cave paintings. Wondjina in Australia and in the Rock Drawings in Valcamonica, in Italy (seen above) are said to bear a resemblance to present day astronauts. Supporters of the ancient astronaut hypothesis sometimes argue that similarities such as dome shaped heads, interpreted as beings wearing space helmets, prove that early man was visited by an extraterrestrial race.

==== Medieval and Renaissance art ====
More support of this hypothesis draws upon what are said to be representations of flying saucers and other unidentified flying objects in Medieval and Renaissance art.
 Some examples of these said objects include an ovoid shape in the sky of the painting &quot;Madonna con Bambino e San Giovannino&quot; (Madonna and Child with the Infant Saint John), an unidentified flying object in the &quot;Annunciazione&quot; (Annunciation) (1486) by Carlo Crivelli, a &quot;spherical object with antennae&quot; that appears similar to Sputnik in Bonaventura Salimbeni&#x27;s &quot;Santissima Trinita&quot; (Holy Trinity) (1595), and many such unidentified flying objects in Masolino Da Panicale&#x27;s &quot;Miracolo della neve&quot; (Miracle of the Snow) (1428). According to Italian art expert Diego Cuoghi, these objects contain religious symbolism behind them as most paintings of the time were of religious subjects. In such artworks, he says that angels and &quot;radiant clouds&quot; often appear in the sky. He says the object in the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; is one of these radiant clouds, the object in the &quot;Annunciazione&quot; is a vortex of angels, the Sputnik-like object of &quot;Santissima Trinita&quot; is a globe representing creation with two sceptres held by God and Christ, and the &quot;Miracolo della neve&quot; contains many lenticular clouds.

==== Nazca Lines ====

The ancient Nazca Lines are hundreds of huge ground drawings etched into the high desert of southern Peru. Some are stylized animals and humanoid figures, while others are merely straight lines hundreds of meters long. As the figures were made to be seen from a great height, they have been linked with the ancient astronaut hypothesis. In the 1970s, the pseudohistorical writer Erich von Däniken popularized a notion that the Nazca lines and figures could have been made &quot;according to instructions from aircraft&quot; and that the longer and wider lines might be runways for spacecraft. According to archaeologist Kenneth Feder, Von Däniken&#x27;s extraterrestrial interpretation is not supported by any evidence. Feder wrote that &quot;the lines are interpreted by archaeologists as ceremonial pathways of the ancient Nazca people; they were used precisely in this way in the fairly recent past.&quot;

Joe Nickell of the University of Kentucky re-created one of the figures using only wooden stakes and string.

=== Ancient artifacts ===
====Ancient flying machines====
Proponents of the ancient astronauts idea say some artifacts discovered in Egypt (the Saqqara Bird) and Colombia-Ecuador (Quimbaya artifacts) are similar to modern planes and gliders. These artifacts have been interpreted by mainstream archaeologists, however, as stylized representations of birds and insects.

=== Ancient structures and megalithic sites ===
Proposed evidence for ancient astronauts includes the existence of ancient monuments and megalithic ruins such as the Giza pyramids of Egypt, Machu Picchu in Peru, or Baalbek in Lebanon, the Moai of Easter Island and Stonehenge of England. Supporters say that these stone structures could not have been built with the technical abilities and tools of the people of the time and further argue that many could not be duplicated even today. They suggest that the large size of the building stones, the precision with which they were laid, and the distances many were transported leaves the question open as to who constructed these sites.

These ideas are categorically rejected by mainstream archeology. Some mainstream archeologists have participated in experiments to move large megaliths. These experiments have succeeded in moving megaliths up to at least 40 tons, and some have speculated that with a larger workforce larger megaliths could be towed with the use of known ancient technology.
====Pyramids of Egypt====
Von Däniken states that ancient Egypt, with its great structures of the Giza pyramid complex such as the Great Pyramid of Giza and the Great Sphinx of Giza, became a &quot;fantastic, ready-made civilization&quot; suddenly and without transitions and development. Ancient astronaut proponents suggest that sites like the pyramids of Giza were instead constructed by extraterrestrials. However, archaeological evidence demonstrates not only the long cultural trajectory of prehistoric Egypt but also the developmental processes the ancient Egyptians underwent. Egyptian tombs began with important leaders of villages being buried in the bedrock and covered with mounds of earth. Eventually, the first pharaohs had tombs covered with single-story, mud-brick, square structures called mastabas. The stepped pyramid developed out of multiple mastabas being stacked on each one in one structure. This led to the construction of pharaoh Djoser&#x27;s Step Pyramid at Saqqara, which is known from records to have been built by the ancient Egyptian architect and advisor Imhotep. It was pharaoh Sneferu who had his pyramid transitioned from a stepped to a true pyramid like the well-known pyramids of Giza. A papyrus document like a logbook kept by an official called inspector Merer has also been discovered with records of the construction of the Great Pyramid.

====Moai====
The Moai statues of Easter Island were moved miles from the Rano Raraku quarry to their current locations, and archaeologists have wondered how massive statues such as these could have been transported. The folklore of the native Rapa Nui people says that chiefs and priests used mana to make the statues of the island walk. In 1982, Czech engineer Pavel Pavel and a group of sixteen people used a replica concrete moai to test a method that could have transported the statues. They tied ropes to it and in two groups pulled and twisted it back and forth, making it move forward in a walking motion. They called it the &quot;refrigerator method&quot; and demonstrated that the massive statues could be easily moved by a small group of people.

=== Religious and cultural practices ===

A number of ancient cultures, such as the ancient Egyptians and some Native Americans, artificially lengthened the skulls of their children. Some ancient astronaut proponents propose that this was done to emulate extraterrestrial visitors, whom they saw as gods.

====Akenaten====
Among the ancient rulers depicted with elongated skulls are pharaoh Akhenaten and Nefertiti. The depiction of Akhenaten and his family with traits like elongated skulls, limbs, underdeveloped torsos, and gynecomastia in Amarna art is hypothesized to be the effect of a familial disease. Marriage between family members, especially siblings, was common in ancient Egyptian royal families, elevating the risk of such disorders. Studies on the remains of the ruling family of 18th Dynasty Egypt have found evidence of deformities and illnesses. Proposed syndromes of Akhenaten include Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan&#x27;s syndrome, Frohlich syndrome, and Antley-Bixler syndrome. Akhenaten worshipped the sun disk god Aten and it is suggested that such worship could point to a disease that is alleviated by sunlight.

== In popular culture ==

Ancient astronauts have been addressed frequently in science fiction and horror fiction in many different media. In a 2004 article in &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine, Jason Colavito writes that von Däniken borrowed many of the book&#x27;s concepts from &quot;Le Matin des Magiciens&quot; (&quot;Morning of the Magicians&quot;), that this book in turn was heavily influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos, and that the core of the ancient astronaut hypothesis originates in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s works &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot; and &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;. Colavito later expanded on this idea in his book &quot;The Cult of Alien Gods: H. P. Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture&quot;.

The idea that aliens visited Earth in the past is frequently seen in works of fiction. For example, the comic book &quot;Thor&quot; considers that all the Norse mythology is based on actual beings living in other dimensions, who were worshipped as gods by the Vikings and who reappear on Earth in modern times. Däniken&#x27;s work, however, inspired several works and franchises over time, such as &quot;Eternals&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, &quot;Prometheus&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;. All those works do not take the idea seriously, but merely use it as a narrative device. Another angle may be to leave the aliens out of the story, and focus instead on devices they left behind, as in the novels &quot;Scarlet Dream&quot;, &quot;Galactic Derelict&quot;, &quot;World of Ptavvs&quot;, &quot;Toolmaker Koan&quot;, and &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot;. Aliens may also appear as an elder race that created or shepherded humans in their early times; and may or may not be present in the work&#x27;s present day.

&quot;Ancient Aliens&quot; is a television series that features proponents of the ancient astronaut hypothesis, such as Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, David Childress, Erich von Däniken, Steven M. Greer, and Nick Pope.

<doc id="301723" wikidata="Q844073" url="?curid=301723" title="Yuengling">
<text>D. G. Yuengling &amp; Son () established in 1829, is the oldest operating brewing company in the United States. In 2018, by volume of sales, it was the largest craft brewery, sixth largest overall brewery and largest wholly American-owned brewery in the United States. Its headquarters are in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. In 2015, Yuengling produced about 2.9 million barrels, operating two Pennsylvania facilities and a brewery in Tampa, Florida.

Yuengling is an Anglicized version of &quot;Jüngling&quot;, its founder&#x27;s surname and the German term for a &quot;young person” or &quot;youngster&quot;. The family-owned brewery has traditionally changed ownership through the purchase of the company by the children of the previous owner. The flagship product is Yuengling Traditional Lager, an amber lager. It is popular enough in Pennsylvania and the Delaware Valley to be ordered in some bars by simply asking for a lager. From 1920 until 1985, Yuengling produced ice-cream. Yuengling Ice Cream returned to the market in 2014.

== History ==
German brewer David Gottlieb Jüngling (1808–1877) immigrated to the United States in 1828 from Aldingen, near Stuttgart, in the Kingdom of Württemberg. He anglicized his surname from Jüngling to Yuengling and began the &quot;Eagle Brewery&quot; on Centre Street in Pottsville in 1829. His eldest son David Jr. left the Eagle Brewery to establish the James River Steam Brewery along the James River in Richmond, Virginia. The first brewery burned down in an 1831 fire and the company relocated to W. Mahantongo Street at 5th Street, its current location. The Eagle Brewery changed its name to &quot;D. G. Yuengling and Son&quot; in 1873 after Frederick Yuengling joined his father David in running the company. Although the company&#x27;s name changed, the bald eagle remained the company&#x27;s emblem. During the late 19th century, breweries were also opened in Saratoga Springs, New York City, and Trail, British Columbia. However, they were eventually merged with the Pottsville plant.

Frank D. Yuengling began heading the company in 1899 after his father Frederick died. During the Prohibition era, Yuengling survived by producing &quot;near beers&quot; (beverages with a 0.5% alcohol content) called &quot;Yuengling Special&quot;, &quot;Yuengling Por-Tor&quot;, and &quot;Yuengling Juvo&quot;. The company also ran a dairy which produced ice cream and opened dance halls in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York City. In 1933, when Prohibition was repealed, Yuengling introduced its symbolic Winner Beer, celebrating Prohibition&#x27;s repeal, and the brewery shipped a truck load of its popular brew to the White House to show their appreciation to President Roosevelt. Richard L. Yuengling Sr. and F. Dohrman Yuengling succeeded Frank Yuengling after their father&#x27;s death in 1963.

Yuengling experienced an increase in sales after a renewed interest in history due to the United States Bicentennial in 1976. Yuengling bought the rights to use the Mount Carbon (Bavarian Premium Beer) name and label when Mount Carbon Brewery went out of business in 1977. Yuengling initially brewed beer at Mount Carbon but eventually abandoned it.

Richard L. (&quot;Dick&quot;) Yuengling Jr. took over as the 5th-generation company president in 1985, the same year its Pennsylvanian brewery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the oldest in the United States. It was also so listed in the Pennsylvania Inventory of Historic Places at some unspecified date. (The company&#x27;s website mentions only a vague national and state registration in 1976). Yuengling has been a registered trademark for various merchandise, including beer, since 1995. The Pottsville brewery was featured on an episode of The History Channel&#x27;s &quot;American Eats&quot;.

In 1987, the brewery reintroduced an amber lager they had not made in decades to take advantage of a spike in popularity of heavier-style beers. Since this time, Yuengling Lager has become its flagship brand, accounting for 80% of production and much of its rapid growth. In 1990, the brewery sold 138,000 barrels. At the time, Yuengling was the largest brewer of porter in the United States.

In the early 1990s, demand throughout the Delaware Valley and Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware outstripped the existing brewery&#x27;s abilities. In 1999, they increased their manufacturing capacity by purchasing a Stroh Brewery Company plant in Tampa, Florida, hiring the former Stroh employees, and began working with a trade union for the first time. In 2000, the company built a third brewery in Pennsylvania, in Port Carbon in Schuylkill County near Pottsville. With production at the Port Carbon, Tampa, and original Pottsville plants, the company has expanded throughout the East Coast.

Yuengling employees filed for union decertification in 2006. As a result, Yuengling did not renew a contract with Teamsters Local 830 of Philadelphia in March 2006. In response, the trade union began boycotting Yuengling products.

As of 2017, Yuengling is a moderately priced beer popular northward through New York, westward into Illinois and Kentucky, and southward through Georgia, where it has a large following. The Tampa brewery supplies the Florida Gulf Coast, the Florida Keys, Central Florida, North Florida, the Florida Panhandle as well as Alabama and Tennessee. The brewery uses corn from Minnesota and hops from Washington as ingredients in its products. Yuengling beer returned to Massachusetts on March 3, 2014, after having circulated among some bars and restaurants beginning in February.

Yuengling began distribution in the state of Georgia on October 27, 2008. Yuengling also expanded distribution into West Virginia in May 2009, Ohio in October 2011, Rhode Island in June 2014, Connecticut in September 2014, Louisiana in August 2016, and Indiana in March 2017. On December 7, 2017, Yuengling announced it would expand to Arkansas in January 2018, after teasing it would expand to either that state, Kentucky, Michigan, or Texas earlier in the day on social media. Despite losing out to Arkansas, Kentucky began serving Yuengling in draft form on March 6, 2018, and began selling it for takeout use on March 19, 2018.

Owner Dick Yuengling spoke in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on August 26, 2013. He made his anti-union beliefs clear, calling for Pennsylvania to be a &quot;right-to-work&quot; state, and praising Republican governor Tom Corbett.

A fire broke out at Yuengling&#x27;s Tampa brewery on October 26, 2013. The extent of the damage was unknown.

In February 2014, Yuengling Ice Cream returned to the market after a nearly 30-year absence. It is operated by David Yuengling, a cousin of Dick Yuengling who is likewise a descendant of David Gottlieb Jüngling. It is legally a separate company from the brewery, as was the case since 1935.

In June 2016, as part of a consent decree, Yuengling committed to paying $7 million to upgrade its water treatment facilities, as well as pay $2.8 million in fines, to settle violations of the Clean Water Act that occurred from 2008 through 2015.

In October 2016, Dick Yuengling&#x27;s endorsement of Donald Trump for president sparked unsuccessful calls for boycotts of Yuengling.

Yuengling will transfer at least 51% control of the company in the future to either of his daughters who are currently executives, Jennifer or Wendy; he told them which one privately, but not publicly. News reports in 2019 also indicated that Yuengling&#x27;s two other daughters, Debbie and Sheryl, also both work for the company, and are also &quot;next in line to take over.&quot;

In October 2019, Yuengling partnered with Hershey&#x27;s to produce a limited release collaboration beer titled Yuengling Hershey&#x27;s Chocolate Porter. This was the first collaborative beer for Yuengling in its 190-year history. The drink tastes like traditional Yuengling but has an aftertaste of Hershey&#x27;s Special Dark.

In 2021, Yuengling announced its expansion into Texas through a partnership that has its beer brewed at a Molson Coors&#x27; facility in Fort Worth.

== Products ==
* Traditional Lager
: An amber lager in the style common before Prohibition (commonly called pre-Prohibition lager). Reintroduced in 1987, it was brought back to the market by longtime Yuengling brewmaster N. Ray Norbert. It subsequently became the company&#x27;s flagship beer, and what is received if a &quot;lager&quot; is ordered throughout many parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. It is usually sold in green bottles prominently featuring the word &quot;LAGER&quot; on the label, but is also available in cans, brown quart bottles, and 24 ounce cans. It was previously offered in 22 ounce bottles, colloquially known as &quot;bombers&quot;. The term &quot;cannon&quot; has replaced the &quot;bomber&quot; name for the large cans. Yuengling Lager is 4.5 percent ABV. 
* Light Lager
: A lower-calorie version of the Traditional Lager.
* Yuengling Premium Beer This was Yuengling&#x27;s flagship brand prior to the introduction of Traditional Lager. As of 2020 its distribution is primarily limited to Pennsylvania and Florida.
: A standard American pilsner.
* Yuengling Premium Light Beer
: A lower-calorie version of the premium beer.
* Original Black &amp; Tan
: This black and tan is a mixture of Yuengling Premium Beer (40%) and Dark-Brewed Porter (60%). It was introduced in 1986.
* Dark-Brewed Porter
: A Baltic porter with a very dark cola color, appearing almost black in the glass with a pale tan head, and a strong malt flavor. Porter originated in England in the early 1700s and became popular in Colonial America, with production concentrated in Pennsylvania. When German brewers like D.G. Yuengling began brewing in America, the popularity of porter led them to add porters to their offerings. Prior to the start of the craft brewing revolution in the 1970s, British breweries had ceased brewing porters, while Yuengling, Stegmaier and Narragansett were the only breweries still producing porters on a regular basis in the United States. For this reason, these breweries have been credited with helping to keep the porter style alive. Rather than using the traditional top-fermenting ale yeasts used in most porters, Yuengling&#x27;s porter is bottom-fermented; few mainstream breweries produce this style. Since the 1800s it has been known as &quot;Pottsville Porter&quot;.
* Lord Chesterfield Ale
: Named for Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, this is Yuengling&#x27;s hoppiest beer. Although Yuengling brewed ales in the 1800s, Lord Chesterfield Ale was introduced in 1934 and was described then as a Canadian type ale. Although originally top fermented in wooden tanks, in the 1960s Yuengling switched to bottom fermenting yeast with no change in taste or character. Like the Traditional Lager, it is usually sold in green bottles (but also in cans) and has an element of corn in its profile. It is very carbonated and tends to sprout a large but short-lived head when poured. As of 2007, Lord Chesterfield is no longer sold in kegs. However, quarter kegs were put back on the market in October 2008.
*Golden Pilsner
:Introduced in 2018, Golden Pilsner is the first year-round beer introduced in 17 years. Combining pale and specialty malts, and Hallertau and Saaz hops, it has an ABV of 4.7% and comes in at 135 calories. It was initially distributed April 1 to select markets, but eventually made its way around the 22-state footprint Yuengling covers.
* Yuengling Oktoberfest
:Produced for the Oktoberfest season, beginning in 2011. It is currently Yuengling&#x27;s only seasonal beer.
*FLIGHT by Yuengling
:Introduced in 2020, FLIGHT by Yuengling is what the brewery has deemed the &quot;next generation of light beer.&quot; being lower in calories and carbohydrates than other beers in its line.
*Yuengling Bock
: Introduced in February 2009, this was a return of a discontinued beer last brewed in the 1970s. According to company sources, it was to be sold as a draught-only, spring seasonal beer. Due to its popularity Yuengling Bock beer was made available for kegs and cases in January 2010. Bock Beer was discontinued in early 2015 after not meeting sales expectations. Bock was reintroduced with a new design in 2024 as a limited time release.
===No longer produced===
* Summer Wheat
:Yuengling introduced a Summer Wheat beer in 2014. It was 4.5% ABV and was less hoppy than the normal brew. It was described as &quot;a southern true authentic Bavarian-style wheat beer. Summer Wheat was discontinued in 2017 along with Yuengling IPL when the Golden Pilsner was introduced, as &quot;part of a business strategy to focus more on the core brands.&quot;
*Yuengling IPL
:At 5% ABV, the India Pale Lager was bright in color and loaded with Bravo, Belma, Cascade, and Citra hops on a balanced lager base. The IPL was first brewed in 2015 and discontinued along with Summer Wheat in 2017.
* Old German 
: It was described in 1978 as darker in color than Yuengling Premium, deep yellow gold, with the aroma of burnt baked potato, a sharp hop taste and bitter finish. It was less expensive than Yuengling Premium. 
* Half &amp; Half
: Originated from Reading&#x27;s Northeast Taproom where they mixed a 50/50 blend of Dark-Brewed Porter and Lord Chesterfield Ale. The local bar then requested that Yuengling sell the draft pre-mixed and the official &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot; was born. It was replaced by Original Black &amp; Tan in 1986 and was discontinued.

<doc id="301726" wikidata="Q365971" url="?curid=301726" title="Camille Chamoun">
<text>Camille Nimr Chamoun (, ; 3 April 19007 August 1987) was a Lebanese politician who served as the 2nd president of Lebanon from 1952 to 1958. He was one of the country&#x27;s main Christian leaders during most of the Lebanese Civil War.

==Early years and education==
Camille Nimr Chamoun was born at Deir al-Qamar on 3 April 1900 into a prominent Maronite family. He received a law degree from Saint Joseph University.

==Career and activities==
Chamoun was first elected to the Lebanese parliament in 1934, and was reelected in 1937 and 1943. A champion of independence from France, he was arrested on 11 November 1943 and was imprisoned in the castle of Rashayya, where he was held for eleven days, along with Bishara el-Khoury and Riad Al Solh, who were to become the first president and prime minister, respectively, of the new republic. Massive public protests led to their release on 22 November, which has since been celebrated as the Lebanese Independence Day.

Chamoun was re-elected to parliament, which was then called the National Assembly, in 1947 and 1951. He was frequently absent, however, as he served as ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1944 to 1946 and as ambassador to the United Nations thereafter. He was the minister of finance from December 1946 to June 1947.

==Presidency==
When President Bechara El Khoury was forced to resign because of corruption allegations in 1952, Chamoun was elected to replace him. 

During Chamoun&#x27;s presidency, Lebanon experienced an economic boom, in particular in the construction, banking and tourism sectors. He implemented a 1954 law on the creation of joint-stock companies and a 1956 law on banking secrecy. According to Fawwaz Traboulsi, Chamoun concentrated power into his hands, blurring the limits of democracy and autocracy.

=== Crisis of 1958 ===

Near the end of his term, Pan-Arabists and other groups backed by Gamal Abdel Nasser, with considerable support in Lebanon&#x27;s Muslim (particularly Sunni) community attempted to overthrow Chamoun&#x27;s government in June 1958 after Chamoun tried to seek another term as president against the constitution. The mood may have been itself indicative of the fact that nine prime ministers formed cabinets under the six years of Chamoun&#x27;s presidency since Sunni politicians were not always able to justify their association with his politics to their constituencies and popular power base. That fact was evident in the pressures that faced the El-Bizri political base in Sidon, and the longstanding parliamentarian Nazih El-Bizri served as a cabinet minister during Chamoun&#x27;s term. Facing unrest in the country, with its epicentre in Sidon at the start of the protests, Chamoun eventually appealed to the United States for help under the new Eisenhower Doctrine, and American Marines landed in Beirut. Moreover, Naim Moghabghab, a close friend and political ally, formed and led a military group to reinforce Chamoun&#x27;s position. Many battles occurred, mainly in Beirut and in the Chouf district, where clashes between Naim Moghabghab and Kamal Jumblatt&#x27;s men led to bloody fights. The revolt was squashed, but to appease Muslim anger, General Fuad Chehab, who claimed to be a Christian enjoying considerable popularity in the Muslim community, was elected to succeed Chamoun. The American diplomat Robert D. Murphy, who had been sent to Lebanon as personal representative of US President Dwight Eisenhower, played a significant role in allowing Chamoun to finish his term normally and Chehab to be elected according to the constitutional procedures.

==Post-presidency==
On his retirement from the presidency, Chamoun founded the National Liberal Party (&quot;al-Ahrar&quot;). As its leader, Chamoun was elected to the National Assembly again in 1960, much to the consternation of Chehab. He was defeated in 1964 because of changes to the boundaries of his electoral district, which he and his supporters protested as deliberate gerrymandering. He was re-elected to the National Assembly, however, in 1968, and again in 1972, Lebanon&#x27;s last parliamentary election in his lifetime. After the election of 1968, the National Liberal Party held 11 seats out of 99, becoming the largest single party in the notoriously fractured National Assembly. It was the only political party to elect representatives from all of Lebanon&#x27;s major religious confessions.

=== Civil War ===
In the 1970s and 1980s, Chamoun served in a variety of portfolios in the cabinet, including interior minister. That was during the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990), in which Chamoun and his party participated through the party&#x27;s militia, the Tigers (in Arabic, &quot;nimr&quot; means tiger). In the early stages of the war, he helped found the Lebanese Front, a coalition of mostly-Christian politicians and parties, whose united militia, dominated by the Kataeb Party, became known as the Lebanese Forces (LF). Chamoun was chairman of the Lebanese Front from 1976 to 1978. He was defense minister in the cabinet of Rashid Karami in 1976.

In a 1976 diplomatic cable from Beirut, special US envoy L. Dean Brown stated, &quot;If I got nothing else from my meeting with Frangie, Chamoun and Gemayel, it is their clear, unequivocal and unmistakable belief that their principal hope for saving Christian necks is Syria. They sound like Assad is the latest incarnation of the Crusaders.&quot;

Though initially aligned with Syria and inviting the Syrian Army to intervene against the leftist Lebanese National Movement (LNM) and its Palestinian allies in 1976, Chamoun later gravitated towards opposition to the Syrians&#x27; presence. 

On 12 March 1980, In Dora, Mount Lebanon, a remote-controlled bomb exploded near the car of Camille Chamoun. One bodyguard was killed while Chamoun, his driver, another bodyguard and a passerby suffered minor injuries. 

In 1980, the NLP&#x27;s Tigers militia was virtually destroyed by a surprise attack from Chamoun&#x27;s Christian rival, Bachir Gemayel. After Israel&#x27;s invasion of Lebanon, Chamoun decided to enter a tactical cooperation with Israel to oppose the Syrian occupation in Lebanon.

Gemayel was elected to the presidency in August 1982, but was assassinated before taking office. Chamoun announced his candidacy, but withdrew one day before the election, after the United States endorsed Amine Gemayel. Chamoun declared his withdrawal by saying: “O Lebanese, it is no coincidence that behind my withdrawal lies the one who will impose a unilateral peace [meaning Israel] on the one who fills the presidential seat.” 

In 1985, 5 people were killed and 23 injured in a suicide attack during a meeting between Christian parties in the St. Georges Monastery in Beirut which was aimed at the five main leaders of the Christian factions of the war. A Christian group called &quot;the Vanguard of Arab Christians&quot; was named as responsible for the attack. Another assassination attempt occurred again on 7 January 1987 which killed 6 people and wounded 40 others when 165 pounds of explosives was detonated as Chamoun passed through East Beirut in the morning.

== Corruption allegations ==
According to As&#x27;ad AbuKhalil, an American document from 1975 revealed that when Chamoun, as Interior Minister, used to import glass, he asked the Tigers militia to &quot;ignite the fronts&quot; to secure glass deals.

==Personal life==
In 1930 he married Zelpha (or Zalfa) Tabet with whom he had two sons, Dany and Dory, both of whom became politicians in the NLP. Dany, his wife and two sons were all shot dead in their Beirut apartment on 21 October 1990.

In 1984 Chamoun agreed to join the National Unity government as deputy prime minister, which he held until his death on 7 August 1987, at the age of 87.

==Death==
He died of a heart attack at Saint George&#x27;s Hospital in Beirut. He spent his last months mostly in the care of his protégée Aida Yahchouchi and her husband, Joseph Wehbe. He is remembered as one of the main Christian nationalist leaders and one of the last significant figures of Lebanon&#x27;s prewar generation of politicians whose political influence was eclipsed during the war by that of younger militia commanders.

<text>The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (Dutch: &quot;Infrarood Astronomische Satelliet&quot;) (IRAS) was the first space telescope to perform a survey of the entire night sky at infrared wavelengths. Launched on 25 January 1983, its mission lasted ten months. The telescope was a joint project of the United States (NASA), the Netherlands (NIVR), and the United Kingdom (SERC). Over 250,000 infrared sources were observed at 12, 25, 60, and 100 micrometer wavelengths.

Support for the processing and analysis of data from IRAS was contributed from the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology. Currently, the Infrared Science Archive at IPAC holds the IRAS archive.

The success of IRAS led to interest in the 1985 Infrared Telescope (IRT) mission on the Space Shuttle, and the planned Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility which eventually transformed into the Space Infrared Telescope Facility, SIRTF, which in turn was developed into the Spitzer Space Telescope, launched in 2003. The success of early infrared space astronomy led to further missions, such as the Infrared Space Observatory (1990s) and the Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS instrument.

== Mission ==
IRAS was the first observatory to perform an all-sky survey at infrared wavelengths. It mapped 96% of the sky four times, at 12, 25, 60 and 100 micrometers, with resolutions ranging from 30 arcseconds at 12 micrometers to 2 arcminutes at 100 micrometers. It discovered about 350,000 sources, many of which are still awaiting identification. About 75,000 of those are believed to be starburst galaxies, still enduring their star-formation stage. Many other sources are normal stars with disks of dust around them, possibly the early stage of planetary system formation. New discoveries included a dust disk around Vega and the first images of the Milky Way core.

IRAS&#x27;s life, like that of most infrared satellites that followed, was limited by its cooling system. To effectively work in the infrared domain, a telescope must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures. In IRAS&#x27;s case, of superfluid helium kept the telescope at a temperature of , keeping the satellite cool by evaporation. IRAS was the first use of superfluids in space. The on-board supply of liquid helium was depleted after 10 months on 21 November 1983, causing the telescope temperature to rise, preventing further observations. The spacecraft continues to orbit the Earth.

IRAS was designed to catalog fixed sources, so it scanned the same region of sky several times. Jack Meadows led a team at Leicester University, including John K. Davies and Simon F. Green, which searched the rejected sources for moving objects. This led to the discovery of three asteroids, including 3200 Phaethon (an Apollo asteroid and the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower), six comets, and a huge dust trail associated with comet 10P/Tempel. The comets included 126P/IRAS, 161P/Hartley–IRAS, and comet IRAS–Araki–Alcock (C/1983 H1), which made a close approach to the Earth in 1983. Out of the six comets IRAS found, four were long period and two were short period comets.

The Supplemental IRAS Minor Planet Survey (SIMPS) would also later use the archived data to search for more minor planets, asteroids.

== Discoveries ==

Overall, over a quarter million discrete targets were observed during its operations, both inside and beyond the Solar System. In addition, new objects were discovered including asteroids and comets.
The observatory made headlines briefly with the announcement on 10 December 1983 of the discovery of an &quot;unknown object&quot; at first described as &quot;possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this solar system&quot;. Further analysis revealed that, of several unidentified objects, nine were distant galaxies and the tenth was &quot;intergalactic cirrus&quot;. None were found to be Solar System bodies.

During its mission, IRAS (and later the Spitzer Space Telescope) detected odd infrared signatures around several stars. This led to the systems being targeted by the Hubble Space Telescope&#x27;s NICMOS instrument between 1999 and 2006, but nothing was detected. In 2014, using new image processing techniques on the Hubble data, researchers discovered planetary disks around these stars.

IRAS discovered six comets, out of total of 22 discoveries and recoveries of all comets that year. This was a lot for this period, before the launch of SOHO in 1995, which would allow the discovery of many more comets in the next decade (it would detect 1000 comets in ten years).

=== Asteroid discoveries ===
== Later surveys ==
Several infrared space telescopes have continued and greatly expanded the study of the infrared Universe, such as the Infrared Space Observatory launched in 1995, the Spitzer Space Telescope launched in 2003, and the Akari Space Telescope launched in 2006.

A next generation of infrared space telescopes began when NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer launched on 14 December 2009 aboard a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base. Known as WISE, the telescope provided results hundreds of times more sensitive than IRAS at the shorter wavelengths; it also had an extended mission dubbed NEOWISE beginning in October 2010 after its coolant supply ran out.

A planned mission is NASA&#x27;s Near-Earth Object Surveillance Mission (NEOSM), which is a successor to the NEOWISE mission.

==2020 near-miss==
On , IRAS was expected to pass as closely as 12 meters from the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Gravity Gradient Stabilization Experiment (GGSE-4) of 1967, another un-deorbited satellite left aloft; the 14.7-kilometer per second pass had an estimated risk of collision of 5%. Further complications arose from the fact that GGSE-4 was outfitted with an 18 meter long stabilization boom that was in an unknown orientation and may have struck the satellite even if the spacecraft&#x27;s main body did not. Initial observations from amateur astronomers seemed to indicate that both satellites had survived the pass, with the California-based debris tracking organization LeoLabs later confirming that they had detected no new tracked debris following the incident.

<text>Kiefer William Frederick Dempsey George Rufus Sutherland (born 21 December 1966) is a Canadian actor. He is best known for his starring role as Jack Bauer in the Fox drama series &quot;24&quot; (2001–2010, 2014), for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award.

Born to actors Donald Sutherland and Shirley Douglas, he got his first leading film role in the Canadian drama &quot;The Bay Boy&quot; (1984), which earned him a Genie Award nomination. He has since appeared in such films as &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986), &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; (1987), &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988), &quot;Flatliners&quot; (1990), &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1993), &quot;Freeway&quot; (1996), &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (1996), &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998), &quot;Phone Booth&quot; (2002), &quot;Melancholia&quot; (2011), &quot;Pompeii&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot; (2023).

He has also starred in the Fox drama &quot;Touch&quot; (2012–2013), and provided the facial motion capture and voice for Venom Snake in the video games &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes&quot; (2014) and &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; (2015). From 2016 to 2019, he starred in the ABC/Netflix political drama series &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;. Sutherland has been inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and to Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, and has received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Zurich Film Festival.

== Early life ==
Sutherland was born on 21 December 1966 at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in the Paddington district of London, to Donald Sutherland and Shirley Douglas, both successful Canadian actors who had been living and working in England. His parents divorced when he was three. He has a twin sister, Rachel Sutherland, who works as a post-production film supervisor. His maternal grandfather was Scottish-born Canadian politician and former Premier of Saskatchewan Tommy Douglas, who is widely credited for bringing universal health care to Canada.

Sutherland is named after American-born writer and director Warren Kiefer, who directed Donald Sutherland in his first feature film, &quot;Castle of the Living Dead&quot;.
When he was a baby, his mother was arrested by the FBI and charged with conspiracy to possess unregistered explosives but was later exonerated. Sutherland&#x27;s family moved to Corona, California, in 1968. His parents divorced in 1970. In 1975, Sutherland moved with his mother to Toronto, Ontario. He attended Crescent Town Elementary School and St. Clair Junior High (now Gordon A. Brown Middle School) in East York, and John G. Althouse Middle School in Etobicoke. He attended several high schools, including St. Andrew&#x27;s College, Martingrove Collegiate Institute, Harbord Collegiate Institute, Silverthorn Collegiate Institute, Malvern Collegiate Institute, and Annex Village Campus. He also spent a semester at Regina Mundi Catholic College in London, Ontario and attended weekend acting lessons at Sir Frederick Banting Secondary School.

Sutherland told &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that he didn&#x27;t really know his famous father outside of holidays and summer vacations until he moved out at age 15. He told &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; (2009) that he and Robert Downey Jr. were roommates for three years when he first moved to Hollywood to pursue his career in acting. He and Downey also starred together in the film &quot;1969&quot; (1988).

== Career ==
=== 1980s: Rise to fame in Hollywood ===
Sutherland made his screen debut in &quot;Max Dugan Returns&quot; (as did Matthew Broderick), in which his father Donald Sutherland also starred. Sutherland was one of the contenders for the role of Glen Lantz in the original &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984), which ultimately became Johnny Depp&#x27;s feature film debut.

After receiving critical acclaim for his role as Donald Campbell in &quot;The Bay Boy&quot;, Sutherland moved to Hollywood. &quot;Stand by Me&quot; was the first film Sutherland made in the United States. In the film, directed by Rob Reiner, he played a neighbourhood bully in a coming-of-age story about a search for a dead body. Before that, he played a silent, supporting character, as one of Sean Penn&#x27;s friends who goes up against Christopher Walken in James Foley&#x27;s crime-thriller &quot;At Close Range&quot;.

He next appeared as a vampire David in Joel Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; in 1987. &quot;Promised Land&quot; (1988), with Meg Ryan, was the first film to be commissioned by the Sundance Film Festival.

In the Western film &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988), he starred alongside Emilio Estevez and Lou Diamond Phillips. He was considered for the role of Robin in &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), alongside Michael Keaton, in the early production before the character was deleted from the shooting script. He went on to star again with his close friend Lou Diamond Phillips, in the crime-action film &quot;Renegades&quot;. That same year, he and his father appeared at the 61st Academy Awards as presenters of the Academy Honorary Award to the National Film Board of Canada.

=== 1990s: Success in films ===
In the sequel &quot;Young Guns II&quot; (1990), Sutherland continued to play &#x27;Doc&#x27; alongside some of the original cast and with newcomer Christian Slater. , it is the only sequel to a feature film he has starred in. Sutherland starred as the lead in &quot;Flatliners&quot;, with an ensemble cast featuring Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon, a film about a student who wants to &quot;experience&quot; death&#x27;s afterlife and record what happens during it, with the help of a group of young students who are &quot;a little&quot; crazy like him; the film received positive reviews from critics. He plays a young FBI agent coming to terms with his life in a commune in &quot;Flashback&quot; (1990) alongside Dennis Hopper. Sutherland had also starred in &quot;The Nutcracker Prince&quot; as Hans/The Nutcracker.

Sutherland did not make a film in 1991. During an interview in March 2012, he said he had declined director Gus Van Sant&#x27;s offer to star in the lead role in the movie &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;, a decision that he regretted. He was quoted as saying &quot;I passed on &quot;My Private Idaho&quot; because I wanted to go skiing and didn&#x27;t even look at it. I told myself that I needed to stick to my plan ... and it was a really dumb plan.&quot;

In 1992, he played a doctor alongside Ray Liotta in the drama &quot;Article 99&quot;. He played a supporting character in &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, the continuation of the short-lived television series of the same name which ran from 1990 to 1991, as agent Sam Stanley; and also in &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992), where he played a junior officer subordinate to Jack Nicholson&#x27;s Col. Nathan R. Jessup. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

In &quot;The Vanishing&quot; (1993), he starred alongside Jeff Bridges as a desperate man seeking the whereabouts of his girlfriend, three years after she mysteriously vanished. In &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1993), Sutherland played the central character of Athos.

In 1996, Sutherland appeared in three films. He starred with Reese Witherspoon in &quot;Freeway&quot;, which gained a cult following. He starred with Sally Field in the thriller &quot;Eye for an Eye&quot;, and he appeared in &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; alongside his father Donald Sutherland.

In 1998, he starred in &quot;Dark City&quot;, the science fiction film directed by Alex Proyas in which he portrayed the historical character Daniel P. Schreber. Sutherland also starred in the film &quot;Ground Control&quot; where he played Jack Harries, an air traffic controller who had a perfect record until one air crash haunts him to leave the business. Years later, he is hurtled back into the world he thought he left behind.

=== 2000s: &quot;24&quot; ===

In 2000, he co-starred with Woody Allen in the black comedy &quot;Picking Up the Pieces&quot;, but the film was received poorly by both commercial audiences and by critics. Since then, Sutherland has starred in small projects and festival-released films. He starred in the film &quot;Beat&quot;, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2000. He also appeared in 2001 film &quot;Cowboy Up&quot;, which won the Crystal Heart Award at the 2001 Heartland Film Festival. He also starred in the film &quot;To End All Wars&quot;, which won two awards at the Heartland Film Festival and one award at the Hawaii International Film Festival.

Since 2001, Sutherland has been associated most widely with the role of Jack Bauer on the critically acclaimed television series &quot;24&quot;. After being nominated four times for the &quot;Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series&quot; Primetime Emmy Award, Sutherland won the award in 2006 for his role in &quot;24&quot;&#x27;s fifth season. In the opening skit of the 2006 Primetime Emmy Awards, Sutherland made an appearance as his &quot;24&quot; character, Jack Bauer. He was also nominated for Best actor in a Drama Television Series at the 2007 Golden Globe Awards for &quot;24&quot;. According to his 2006 contract, his salary of $40 million for three seasons of the show made him the highest-earning actor on television.

Sutherland constantly emphasizes that the show is merely &quot;entertainment&quot;. The dean of the United States Military Academy, Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan, visited the set of &quot;24&quot; in February 2007 to urge the show&#x27;s makers to reduce the number of torture scenes and Sutherland accepted an invitation from the U.S. military to tell West Point cadets that it is wrong to torture prisoners. In an interview with &quot;OK!&quot; magazine, Howard Gordon said it would be an &quot;unbearable loss&quot; if they killed off Sutherland&#x27;s character.

Due to his extensive schedule with &quot;24&quot;, he spent less time in film. In 2004, he starred in &quot;Taking Lives&quot;, alongside Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke, in which he had a &quot;flashy cameo&quot;. In &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (2006), he starred alongside Michael Douglas, as his protégé and he also starred in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Wild&quot; where he voiced the character Samson. He played the lead roles in Alexandre Aja&#x27;s supernatural horror, &quot;Mirrors&quot; (2008). In 2009, he joined the DreamWorks animated film &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;, reuniting him with actress Reese Witherspoon with whom he starred in &quot;Freeway&quot;. &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot; is Sutherland&#x27;s highest-grossing film to date.

The actor is also a frequent collaborator with director Joel Schumacher, and has appeared in &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, &quot;Flatliners&quot;, &quot;Phone Booth,&quot; the big screen adaptation of &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (the film also starred his father Donald, although their characters did not interact), and &quot;Twelve&quot; as the narrator.

In 2005, Sutherland was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto, where both of his parents have also been inducted. He ranked No. 68 on the 2006 Forbes Celebrity 100 list of the world&#x27;s most powerful celebrities, his earnings were a reported $23 million. In 2008, he was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Sutherland was the first &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; guest to be the child of a former guest; his father, Donald, appeared on the show in 1998. Sutherland was featured on the cover of the April 2006 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in an article entitled &quot;Alone in the Dark with Kiefer Sutherland&quot;. The article began with Sutherland revealing his interest to be killed off in &quot;24&quot;. However, he stated, &quot;Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I love what I do.&quot; It also revealed that he devoted 10 months a year working on &quot;24&quot;. He has starred in Japanese commercials for CalorieMate, performing a parody of his Jack Bauer character. Sutherland also provides voice-overs for the current ad campaign for the Ford Motor Company of Canada. In mid-2006, he voiced the Apple, Inc. advertisement announcing the inclusion of Intel chips in their Macintosh computer line. He also voices the introduction to NHL games on the Versus network in the US.

=== 2010s and 2020s: Post-&quot;24&quot; film, television, and music projects ===
On 14 February 2010, Fox TV announced they were temporarily suspending production of Season 8 of &quot;24&quot; due to a ruptured cyst near one of Sutherland&#x27;s kidneys. According to the report, he waited a few days before going in to have &quot;elective surgery&quot; performed. It was anticipated that he would return after a week, but a few days further were needed and Fox reported that his return to set would be 1 March.

In the 2011 drama-thriller &quot;Melancholia&quot; directed by Lars Von Trier, he played the male lead character and got the chance to share the screen with long-lost co-stars such as Charlotte Rampling and John Hurt, the film in which Kiefer was nominated for the major Danish film prize Bodil. Kiefer also shared the screen with Hurt another time, this time on the small screen, in the web series &quot;The Confession&quot;.

In 2011, Sutherland made his Broadway debut, opposite Brian Cox, Jim Gaffigan, Chris Noth and Jason Patric, in the Broadway revival of &quot;That Championship Season&quot;, which opened in March 2011.

In 2012, Sutherland starred in the Fox television series &quot;Touch&quot;. He played the father of an autistic boy who does not like to be touched, while the son also communicates future humanity interrelated events to his father through numbers and mathematics.

In &quot;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&quot; (2013), the best-selling novel adaptation directed by Mira Nair, he played a supporting character for newcomer Riz Ahmed, as a boss named Jim Cross. On 14 May 2013, it was confirmed that the show &quot;24&quot; would return for a limited series. Before that, he was also offered the lead role in the NBC drama &quot;The Blacklist&quot;. In May and July 2014, Fox aired the twelve-episode &quot;24: Live Another Day&quot;, which received acclaimed reviews from critics. Although he did not appear in 2017&#x27;s &quot;24: Legacy,&quot; he was the show&#x27;s executive producer.

Sutherland was cast in the 2014 epic romantic historical disaster movie, &quot;Pompeii&quot;, directed by Paul W. S. Anderson; though the film received generally mixed to negative reviews, and Sutherland&#x27;s Roman accent and antagonistic performance as Senator Quintus Attius Corvus received polarizing responses from critics, he regarded the film as &quot;much more fun&quot; than many of his other roles, and considered production of the film to be &quot;one of the most comfortable environments I&#x27;ve ever been in&quot;.
Sutherland also provided narration for several promotional spots for the United States Men&#x27;s National Soccer Team during the 2014 FIFA World Cup for ESPN. He has appeared in a Brazilian TV commercials for Citroën C4 sedan and a voice-over for a commercial for Bank of America. He voices Sgt. Roebuck in Treyarch&#x27;s video game &quot;Call of Duty: World at War&quot; and voices Big Boss in the video game &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes&quot; and its sequel &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;, taking over the role originally performed by David Hayter.

After working in the movie industry for more than 30 years, he had the chance to star with his father, Donald Sutherland, in the 2015 western-drama film &quot;Forsaken&quot;, which also stars Demi Moore and Brian Cox. The film screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and received mixed reviews from critics.

In 2016, Sutherland was cast in the lead role of the former ABC political drama series &quot;Designated Survivor&quot; as Tom Kirkman, the President of the United States. The show was renewed by Netflix for a third season which was released on 7 June 2019.

In 2016, Sutherland released his first album, &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, and a music video for &quot;Not Enough Whiskey&quot; from the album. The country music songs were written by Sutherland and Jude Cole. The Kiefer Sutherland Band toured in April and May of that year, and debuted at the Grand Ole Opry on June 6, 2016. A 2017 review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; said, &quot;you have the first Hollywood hobby act unshackled by convention and with a real shot at greatness.&quot; The band performed in Scotland and in Las Vegas in 2019. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Reckless and Me&quot;, was released in April 2019.
Sutherland played Det. Clay Bryce in the American action thriller television series &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, which premiered on August 3, 2020. He also starred as lead role John Weir in the 2023 Paramount+ thriller show &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot;. In the 2023 film &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;, based on the two-act play of the same name, Sutherland played the role of Lieutenant Commander Phillip Queeg, the part portrayed by Humphrey Bogart in the 1954 film adaptation. &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;, directed by William Friedkin, premiered in September 2023 at the 80th Venice International Film Festival where it screened out of competition. The film is Friedkin&#x27;s sole posthumous work, the director having died on August 7 of the same year. Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com praised Sutherland for bringing &quot;unique energy&quot; to the role, describing his performance as &quot;one of the best acting turns of his career.&quot; Total Film have also praised his performance, writing Sutherland delivers &quot;some of the best work of his career here. He&#x27;s only briefly in the film, and yet he makes every second count, fidgeting with his hands and spitting his lines as if certain words pain him. He makes Queeg a complex, complicated man, not just a stock villain.&quot;

Sutherland narrated the Apple TV+ docuseries &quot;John Lennon: Murder Without a Trial&quot;. It was released on Apple&#x27;s streaming platform on December 6, 2023.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and relationships ===
On 12 September 1987, Sutherland married Puerto Rican-born Camelia Kath, the widow of Chicago guitarist/singer Terry Kath; she was 34 and he was 20. They had one daughter, Sarah, born on February 18, 1988. Through their marriage, he became stepfather to Camelia&#x27;s daughter Michelle Kath (b. 1976), who has two sons with actor Adam Sinclair. Sutherland and Kath divorced in 1990.

Sutherland was engaged to Julia Roberts, his co-star in &quot;Flatliners&quot; (1990). The pair planned to marry on 14 June 1991, but called off the engagement four days before.

On 29 June 1996, Sutherland married Kelly Winn. The couple separated in 1999, and he filed for divorce in 2004. The divorce was finalized on 16 May 2008.

In the late 1990s, Sutherland purchased a ranch in Montana and toured on the rodeo circuit. He dated Bo Derek in 2000.

Sutherland began dating model/actress Cindy Vela of Olmito, Texas, sometime in 2014, keeping their relationship private up until 2017 when they began to be seen together in public. Vela and Sutherland became engaged in 2017.&quot;&quot; , they reside in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles.

=== Legal issues ===

Sutherland was charged in Los Angeles on 25 September 2007, on drunk driving charges, after failing a field sobriety test. His test exceeded the state&#x27;s legal blood alcohol limit, and he was later released on a $25,000 bail. It was Sutherland&#x27;s fourth DUI charge since 1989. Sutherland pleaded no contest to the DUI charge and was sentenced to 48 days in jail.

Sutherland surrendered to the NYPD on 6 May 2009 for head-butting fashion designer Jack McCollough, founder and co-designer of Proenza Schouler, at The Mercer Hotel in SoHo following a fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Several weeks later, Sutherland and McCollough issued a joint statement in which Sutherland apologized; police later dropped the charges.

=== Business ventures ===
Sutherland is the co-owner (along with Jude Cole) of the independent record label Ironworks.

Sutherland reportedly fell victim to a financial scam involving cattle in 2010. According to the Associated Press, the perpetrator, Michael Wayne Carr, took US$869,000 from Sutherland, ostensibly in order to buy steers which were never purchased. Carr pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay US$956,000 in restitution to Sutherland and his investment partner.

===Political views===
In his January 2007 interview with Charlie Rose, Sutherland said of his political views:
I believe inherently that we have a responsibility to take care of each other, so when you talk about socialized health care: absolutely, that&#x27;s a no-brainer. Free universities: absolutely, that&#x27;s a no-brainer. So, in the definition, I guess those are leaning toward socialist politics. To me, it&#x27;s common sense.

As a Canadian citizen residing in the United States for work, Sutherland said he is unable to vote in either country. However, he has stated in a 2016 interview that he would have aligned with the New Democratic Party due to his family&#x27;s history and support for the NDP. Sutherland also supports the Liberal Party&#x27;s efforts to protect universal health care and criticized the Conservative Party&#x27;s &quot;undervaluing&quot; of the Canadian public health care system.

In 2019, Sutherland called out Ontario premier Doug Ford and Ottawa MPP Lisa MacLeod for using his late grandfather&#x27;s name to &quot;push their agendas&quot;. He also criticized Ford for claiming that the late Douglas would have approved of the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; push for fiscal discipline as he argued that his grandfather&#x27;s achievements were &quot;never at the expense of social and human services to those in need&quot;. MacLeod responded by criticizing an &quot;expensive&quot; bus shelter ad for &quot;Designated Survivor&quot; outside of Queen&#x27;s Park while suggesting that Sutherland does not understand the challenges of being a politician compared to &quot;pretending to be one on TV&quot;.

===Charity work===
Sutherland is a member of a Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

<text>The Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar) is a media type which allows users to store and exchange calendaring and scheduling information such as events, to-dos, journal entries, and free/busy information, and together with its associated standards has been a cornerstone of the standardization and interoperability of digital calendars across different vendors. Files formatted according to the specification usually have an extension of . With supporting software, such as an email reader or calendar application, recipients of an iCalendar data file can respond to the sender easily or counter-propose another meeting date/time. The file format is specified in a proposed Internet standard (RFC 5545) for calendar data exchange. The standard and file type are sometimes referred to as &quot;iCal&quot;, which was the name of the Apple Inc. calendar program until 2012 (see iCal), which provides one of the implementations of the standard.

iCalendar is used and supported by many products, including:
* general consumer: Apple Calendar (formerly iCal), eM Client, Google Calendar, Yahoo! Calendar
* corporate: HCL Domino (formerly IBM Notes and Lotus Notes)
* free software: GNOME Evolution, GNU Emacs, Mozilla Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey 
It is partially supported by Microsoft Outlook and Novell GroupWise.

iCalendar is designed to be independent of the transport protocol. For example, certain events can be sent by traditional email or whole calendar files can be shared and edited by using a WebDav server, or SyncML. Simple web servers (using just the HTTP protocol) are often used to distribute iCalendar data about an event and to publish busy times of an individual. Publishers can embed iCalendar data in web pages using hCalendar, a 1:1 microformat representation of iCalendar in semantic (X)HTML.

== History ==
iCalendar was created in 1998 by the Calendaring and Scheduling Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force, chaired by Anik Ganguly of Open Text Corporation, and was authored by Frank Dawson of Lotus Development Corporation and Derik Stenerson of Microsoft Corporation. iCalendar data files are plain text files with the extension or (for files containing availability information only). RFC 5545 replaced RFC 2445 in September 2009 and now defines the standard.

iCalendar is heavily based on the earlier vCalendar by the Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) which has the file extension. After iCalendar was released, the Internet Mail Consortium stated that it &quot;hopes that all vCalendar developers take advantage of these new open standards and make their software compatible with both vCalendar 1.0 and iCalendar.&quot;

The memo &quot;Calendar Access Protocol&quot; (RFC 4324) was an initial attempt at a universal system to create real-time calendars, but was eventually abandoned. Instead, iCalendar saw some adoption for such purposes with &quot;ad hoc&quot; extensions such as GroupDAV and CalDAV emerging as informal standards and seeing some adoption in both client and server software packages.

A first effort to simplify iCalendar standards by the IETF &quot;Calendaring and Scheduling Working Group&quot; (ietf-calsify WG) ended in January 2011 without seeing adoption. The work was then picked up by the &quot;Calendaring Extensions Working Group&quot; (ietf-calext WG).

== Design ==

iCalendar data have the MIME content type . The filename extension of is to be used for files containing calendaring and scheduling information, for files with free or busy time information consistent with this MIME content type. The equivalent file type codes in Apple Macintosh operating system environments are and .

By default, iCalendar uses the UTF-8 character set; a different character set can be specified using the &quot;charset&quot; MIME parameter (if the transport method used supports MIME, such as Email or HTTP). Each line is terminated by CR+LF (in hexadecimal: ). Lines should be limited to 75 octets (not characters) long. Where a data item is too long to fit on a single line it can be continued on following lines by starting the continuation lines with a space character (in hex: 20) or a tab character (in hex: 09). Actual line feeds in data items are encoded as a backslash followed by the letter n or N (the bytes or in UTF-8).

The iCalendar format is designed to transmit calendar-based data, such as events, and intentionally does not describe what to do with that data. Thus, other programming may be needed to negotiate what to do with this data. A companion standard, &quot;iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability&quot; (iTIP) (RFC 2446), defines a protocol for exchanging iCalendar objects for collaborative calendaring and scheduling between &quot;Calendar Users&quot; (CUs) facilitated by an &quot;Organizer&quot; initiating the exchange of data. This standard defines methods such as , , , , , , (to negotiate a change in the entry), and (to decline the counter-proposal). Another companion standard, &quot;iCalendar Message-based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)&quot; (RFC 2447), defines a standard method for implementing iTIP on standard Internet email-based transports. The &quot;Guide to Internet Calendaring&quot; (RFC 3283) explains how iCalendar interacts with other calendar computer language (current and future).

The top-level element in iCalendar is the Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object, a collection of calendar and scheduling information. Typically, this information will consist of a single iCalendar object. However, multiple iCalendar objects can be grouped together. The first line must be , and the last line must be ; the contents between these lines is called the &quot;icalbody&quot;. The body must include the &quot; and &quot; calendar properties. In addition, it must include at least one calendar component.

 is used to specify that data is in the old vCalendar format. is 2.0 for the current iCalendar format as of 2016.

The body of the iCalendar object (the icalbody) contains single-line &quot;Calendar Properties&quot; that apply to the entire calendar, as well as one or more blocks of multiple lines that each define a &quot;Calendar Component&quot; such as an event, journal entry, alarm, or one of several other types. Here is a simple example of an iCalendar object with a single calendar containing a single &quot;Calendar Component&quot;, a &quot;Bastille Day Party&quot; event starting at 5pm on July 14, 1997, and ending at 4am the following morning:

The UID field distributes updates when a scheduled event changes. When the event is first generated a globally unique identifier is created. If a later event is distributed with the same UID, it replaces the original one. An example UID might be codice_1, for the 5th meeting of class 131 in semester 2 at a hypothetical college. Email-style UIDs are now considered bad practice, with a UUID recommended instead.

The most common representation of date and time is a &quot;tz timestamp&quot; such as with the format for a total fixed length of 16 characters. &quot;Z&quot; indicates the use of UTC (referring to its Zulu time zone). When used in and properties, start times are inclusive while end times are not. This allows an event&#x27;s end time to be the same as a consecutive event&#x27;s start without those events overlapping and potentially creating (false) scheduling conflicts.

Components include:

* describes an event, which has a scheduled amount of time on a calendar. Normally, when a user accepts the calendar event, this will cause that time to be considered busy, though an event can be set to be to change this interpretation. A may include a which allows an alarm. Such events have a which sets a starting time, and a which sets an ending time. If the calendar event is recurring, sets up the start of the first event.
* explains a to-do item, i.e., an action-item or assignment. Not all calendar applications recognize items. In particular, Outlook does not export Tasks as items, and ignores items in imported calendars.
* is a journal entry. They attach descriptive text to a particular calendar date, may be used to record a daily record of activities or accomplishments, or describe progress with a related to-do entry. A calendar component does not take up time on a calendar, so it has no effect on free or busy time (just like entries). In practice, few programs support entries.
* is a request for free/busy time, is a response to a request, or is a published set of busy time.
* Other component types include , (time zones) and (alarms). Some components can include other components ( is often included in other components). Some components are often defined to support other components defined after them ( is often used this way).

iCalendar is meant to &quot;provide the definition of a common format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the Internet&quot;. While the features most often used by users are widely supported by iCalendar, some more advanced capabilities have problems. For example, most vendors do not support Journals (). s have had conversion problems as well.

iCalendar&#x27;s calendar is also not compatible with some non-Gregorian calendars such as the lunar calendars used in Israel and Saudi Arabia. Although there exist one-to-one mappings between Gregorian and many other calendar scales, the lack of defined values for those calendars and limitations in various date fields can make native support impossible. For example the Hebrew calendar year may contain either 12 or 13 months, and the Japanese Emperor-based calendar scale contains many eras.

== Extensions ==

vCalendar and iCalendar support private software extensions, with a &quot;X-&quot; prefix, a number of which are in common usage.

<doc id="301737" wikidata="Q1527843" url="?curid=301737" title="Right whale">
<text>Right whales are three species of large baleen whales of the genus Eubalaena: the North Atlantic right whale (&quot;E. glacialis&quot;), the North Pacific right whale (&quot;E. japonica&quot;) and the southern right whale (&quot;E. australis&quot;). They are classified in the family Balaenidae with the bowhead whale. Right whales have rotund bodies with arching rostrums, V-shaped blowholes and dark gray or black skin. The most distinguishing feature of a right whale is the rough patches of skin on its head, which appear white due to parasitism by whale lice. Right whales are typically long and weigh up to or more.

All three species are migratory, moving seasonally to feed or give birth. The warm equatorial waters form a barrier that isolates the northern and southern species from one another although the southern species, at least, has been known to cross the equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, right whales tend to avoid open waters and stay close to peninsulas and bays and on continental shelves, as these areas offer greater shelter and an abundance of their preferred foods. In the Southern Hemisphere, right whales feed far offshore in summer, but a large portion of the population occur in near-shore waters in winter. Right whales feed mainly on copepods but also consume krill and pteropods. They may forage the surface, underwater or even the ocean bottom. During courtship, males gather into large groups to compete for a single female, suggesting that sperm competition is an important factor in mating behavior. Gestation tends to last a year, and calves are weaned at eight months old.

Right whales were a preferred target for whalers because of their docile nature, their slow surface-skimming feeding behaviors, their tendency to stay close to the coast, and their high blubber content (which makes them float when they are killed, and which produced high yields of whale oil). Although the whales no longer face pressure from commercial whaling, humans remain by far the greatest threat to these species: the two leading causes of death are being struck by ships and entanglement in fishing gear. Today, the North Atlantic and North Pacific right whales are among the most endangered whales in the world.

==Naming==
A common explanation for the name &quot;right whales&quot; is that they were regarded as the ones to hunt, as they float when killed and often swim within sight of shore. They are quite docile and do not tend to shy away from approaching boats. As a result, they were hunted nearly to extinction during the active years of the whaling industry. However, this origin is questionable: in his history of American whaling, Eric Jay Dolin writes:
For the scientific names, the generic name &quot;Eubalaena&quot; means &quot;good or true whales&quot;, and specific names include &quot;glacialis&quot; (&quot;ice&quot;) for North Atlantic species, &quot;australis&quot; (&quot;southern&quot;) for Southern Hemisphere species, and &quot;japonica&quot; (&quot;Japanese&quot;) for North Pacific species.

==Taxonomy==

The right whales were first classified in the genus &quot;Balaena&quot; in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, who at the time considered all of the right whales (including the bowhead) as a single species. Through the 19th and 20th centuries, in fact, the family Balaenidae has been the subject of great taxonometric debate. Authorities have repeatedly recategorized the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale, as one, two, three or four species, either in a single genus or in two separate genera. In the early whaling days, they were all thought to be a single species, &quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot;. Eventually, it was recognized that bowheads and right whales were in fact different, and John Edward Gray proposed the genus &quot;Eubalaena&quot; for the right whale in 1864. Later, morphological factors such as differences in the skull shape of northern and southern right whales indicated at least two species of right whale – one in the Northern Hemisphere, the other in the Southern Ocean.
As recently as 1998, Rice, in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification listed just two species: &quot;Balaena glacialis&quot; (the right whales) and &quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot; (the bowheads).
In 2000, two studies of DNA samples from each of the whale populations concluded the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale.
The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3 million and 12 million years.

In 2001, Brownell &quot;et al&quot;. reevaluated the conservation status of the North Pacific right whale as a distinct species, and in 2002, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) accepted Rosenbaum&#x27;s findings, and recommended that the &quot;Eubalaena&quot; nomenclature be retained for this genus.

A 2007 study by Churchill provided further evidence to conclude that the three different living right whale species constitute a distinct phylogenetic lineage from the bowhead, and properly belong to a separate genus.

The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the three right whales and the bowhead whale.
A cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa; the point where each node branches is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline.

Whale lice, parasitic cyamid crustaceans that live off skin debris, offer further information through their own genetics. Because these lice reproduce much more quickly than whales, their genetic diversity is greater. Marine biologists at the University of Utah examined these louse genes and determined their hosts split into three species 5–6 million years ago, and these species were all equally abundant before whaling began in the 11th century.
The communities first split because of the joining of North and South America. The rising temperatures of the equator then created a second split, into northern and southern groups, preventing them from interbreeding.
&quot;This puts an end to the long debate about whether there are three &quot;Eubalaena&quot; species of right whale. They really are separate beyond a doubt&quot;, Jon Seger, the project&#x27;s leader, told BBC News.

===Others===
The pygmy right whale (&quot;Caperea marginata&quot;), a much smaller whale of the Southern Hemisphere, was until recently considered a member of the Family Balaenidae. However, they are not right whales at all, and their taxonomy is presently in doubt. Most recent authors place this species into the monotypic Family Neobalaenidae,
but a 2012 study suggests that it is instead the last living member of the Family Cetotheriidae, a family previously considered extinct.

Yet another species of right whale was proposed by Emanuel Swedenborg in the 18th century—the so-called &quot;Swedenborg whale&quot;. The description of this species was based on a collection of fossil bones unearthed at Norra Vånga, Sweden, in 1705 and believed to be those of giants. The bones were examined by Swedenborg, who realized they belong to a species of whale. The existence of this species has been debated, and further evidence for this species was discovered during the construction of a motorway in Strömstad, Sweden in 2009.
To date, however, scientific consensus still considers &quot;Hunterius swedenborgii&quot; to be a North Atlantic right whale.
According to a DNA analysis conducted, it was later confirmed that the fossil bones are actually from a bowhead whale.
==Characteristics==

Adult right whales are typically long. They have extremely thick bodies with a girth as much as 60% of total body length in some cases. They have large, broad and blunt pectoral flippers and the deeply notched, smoothly tipped tail flukes make up to 40% of their body length. The North Pacific species is on average the largest of the three species. weigh . The upper jaw of a right whale is a bit arched, and the lower lip is strongly curved. On each side of the upper jaw are 200–270 baleen plates. These are narrow and approximately long, and are covered in very thin hairs. Right whales have a distinctive wide V-shaped blow, caused by the widely spaced blowholes on the top of the head. The blow rises above the surface.

The skin is generally black with occasional white blotches on the body, while some individuals have mottled patterns. Unlike other whales, a right whale has distinctive callosities (roughened patches of skin) on its head. The callosities appear white due to large colonies of cyamids (whale lice).
Each individual has a unique callosities pattern. In 2016, a competitive effort resulted in the use of facial recognition software to derive a process to uniquely identify right whales with about 87% accuracy based on their callosities. The primary role of callosities has been considered to be protection against predators. Right whale declines might have also reduced barnacles.

An unusually large 40% of their body weight is blubber, which is of relatively low density. Consequently, unlike many other species of whale, dead right whales tend to float. Many southern right whales are seen with rolls of fats behind blowholes that northern species often lack, and these are regarded as a sign of better health condition due to sufficient nutrition supply, and could have contributed in vast differences in recovery status between right whales in the southern and northern hemisphere, other than direct impacts by humankind.

The penis on a right whale can be up to – the testes, at up to in length, in diameter, and weighing up to 525 kg (1157 lbs), are also by far the largest of any animal on Earth. The blue whale may be the largest animal on the planet, yet the testicles of the right whale are ten times the size of those of the blue whale. They also exceed predictions in terms of relative size, being six times larger than would be expected on the basis of body mass. Together, the testicles make up nearly 1% of the right whale&#x27;s total body weight. This strongly suggests sperm competition is important in mating, which correlates to the fact that right whales are highly promiscuous.

==Range and habitat==

The three &quot;Eubalaena&quot; species inhabit three distinct areas of the globe: the North Atlantic in the western Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific in a band from Japan to Alaska and all areas of the Southern Ocean. The whales can only cope with the moderate temperatures found between 20 and 60 degrees in latitude. The warm equatorial waters form a barrier that prevents mixing between the northern and southern groups with minor exclusions. Although the southern species in particular must travel across open ocean to reach its feeding grounds, the species is not considered to be pelagic. In general, they prefer to stay close to peninsulas and bays and on continental shelves, as these areas offer greater shelter and an abundance of their preferred foods.

Because the oceans are so large, it is very difficult to accurately gauge whale population sizes. Approximate figures:

* 400 North Atlantic right whales (&quot;Eubalaena glacialis&quot;) live in the North Atlantic;
* 23 North Pacific right whales have been identified in the eastern North Pacific (&quot;Eubalaena japonica&quot;) and
* 15,000 southern right whales (&quot;Eubalaena australis&quot;) are spread throughout the southern part of the Southern Hemisphere.

===North Atlantic right whale===
Almost all of the 400 North Atlantic right whales live in the western North Atlantic Ocean. In northern spring, summer and autumn, they feed in areas off the Canadian and northeast U.S. coasts in a range stretching from New York to Newfoundland. Particularly popular feeding areas are the Bay of Fundy and Cape Cod Bay. In winter, they head south towards Georgia and Florida to give birth. There have been a smattering of sightings further east over the past few decades; several sightings were made close to Iceland in 2003. These are possibly the remains of a virtually extinct eastern Atlantic stock, but examination of old whalers&#x27; records suggests they are more likely to be strays. However, a few sightings have happened between Norway, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and Italy; at least the Norway individuals come from the Western stock.

===North Pacific right whale===
The North Pacific right whale appears to occur in two populations. The population in the eastern North Pacific/Bering Sea is extremely low, numbering about 30 individuals. A larger western population of 100–200 appears to be surviving in the Sea of Okhotsk, but very little is known about this population. Thus, the two northern right whale species are the most endangered of all large whales and two of the most endangered animal species in the world. Based on current population density trends, both species are predicted to become extinct within 200 years. The Pacific species was historically found in summer from the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the Gulf of Alaska in the east, generally north of 50°N. Today, sightings are very rare and generally occur in the mouth of the Sea of Okhotsk and in the eastern Bering Sea. Although this species is very likely to be migratory like the other two species, its movement patterns are not known.

===Southern right whale===
The last major population review of southern right whales by the International Whaling Commission was in 1998. Researchers used data about adult female populations from three surveys (one in each of Argentina, South Africa and Australia) and extrapolated to include unsurveyed areas and estimated counts of males and calves (using available male:female and adult:calf ratios), giving an estimated 1997 population of 7,500 animals. More recent data from 2007 indicate those survey areas have shown evidence of strong recovery, with a population approaching twice that of a decade earlier. However, other breeding populations are still very small, and data are insufficient to determine whether they, too, are recovering.

The southern right whale spends the summer months in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to Antarctica. It migrates north in winter for breeding, and can be seen around the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay. The South American, South African and Australasian groups apparently intermix very little, if at all, because of the strong fidelity of mothers to their feeding and calving grounds. The mother passes these instincts to her calves.

==Life history==
Right whales swim slowly, reaching only at top speed. However, they are highly acrobatic and frequently breach (jump clear of the sea surface), tail-slap and lobtail.

===Diet and predation===
The right whales&#x27; diets consist primarily of zooplankton, primarily the tiny crustaceans called copepods, as well as krill, and pteropods, although they are occasionally opportunistic feeders. As with other baleens, they feed by filtering prey from the water. They swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. The whale then expels the water, using its baleen plates to retain the prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale&#x27;s interest, be large enough that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough that it cannot escape. The &quot;skimming&quot; may take place on the surface, underwater, or even at the seabed, indicated by mud occasionally observed on right whales&#x27; bodies.

The right whales&#x27; two known predators are humans and orcas. When danger lurks, a group of right whales may cluster into a circle, and thrash their outwards-pointing tails. They may also head for shallow water, which sometimes proves to be an ineffective defense. Aside from the strong tails and massive heads equipped with callosities, the sheer size of this animal is its best defense, making young calves the most vulnerable to orca and shark attacks.

===Vocalization and hearing===
Vocalizations made by right whales are not elaborate compared to those made by other whale species. The whales make groans, pops and belches typically at frequencies around 500 Hz. The purpose of the sounds is not known but may be a form of communication between whales within the same group. Northern right whales responded to sounds similar to police sirens—sounds of much higher frequency than their own. On hearing the sounds, they moved rapidly to the surface. The research was of particular interest because northern rights ignore most sounds, including those of approaching boats. Researchers speculate this information may be useful in attempts to reduce the number of ship-whale collisions or to encourage the whales to surface for ease of harvesting.

===Courtship and reproduction===
During the mating season, which can occur at any time in the North Atlantic, right whales gather into &quot;surface-active groups&quot; made up of as many as 20 males consorting a single female. The female has her belly to the surface while the males stroke her with their flippers or keep her underwater. The males do not compete as aggressively against each other as male humpbacks. The female may not become pregnant but she is still able to assess the condition of potential mates. The mean age of first parturition in North Atlantic right whales is estimated at between 7.5 and 9 years. Females breed every 3–5 years; the most commonly seen calving intervals are 3 years and may vary from 2 up to 21 years due to multiple factors.

Both reproduction and calving take place during the winter months. Calves are approximately in weight and in length at birth following a gestation period of 1 year. The right whale grows rapidly in its first year, typically doubling in length. Weaning occurs after eight months to one year and the growth rate in later years is not well understood—it may be highly dependent on whether a calf stays with its mother for a second year.

Respective congregation areas in the same region may function as for different objectives for whales.

===Lifespan===
Very little is known about the life span of right whales. One of the few well-documented cases is of a female North Atlantic right whale that was photographed with a baby in 1935, then photographed again in 1959, 1980, 1985, and 1992. Consistent callosity patterns ensured it was the same animal. She was last photographed in 1995 with a seemingly fatal head wound, presumably from a ship strike. By conservative estimates (e.g. she was a new mother who had just reached sexual maturity in 1935), she was nearly 70 years to more than 100 years of age, if not older. Research on the closely related bowhead whale exceeding 210 years suggests this lifespan is not uncommon and may even be exceeded.

==Relationship to humans==

===Whaling===

In the early centuries of shore-based whaling before 1712, right whales were virtually the only catchable large whales, for three reasons:
* They often swam close to shore where they could be spotted by beach lookouts, and hunted from beach-based whaleboats.
* They are relatively slow swimmers, allowing whalers to catch up to them in their whaleboats.
* Once killed by harpoons, they were more likely to float, and thus could be retrieved. However, some did sink when killed (10–30% in the North Pacific) and were lost unless they later stranded or surfaced.

Basque people were the first to hunt right whales commercially, beginning as early as the 11th century in the Bay of Biscay. They initially sought oil, but as meat preservation technology improved, the animal was also used for food. Basque whalers reached eastern Canada by 1530 and the shores of Todos os Santos Bay (in Bahia, Brazil) by 1602. The last Basque voyages were made before the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). All attempts to revive the trade after the war failed. Basque shore whaling continued sporadically into the 19th century.

&quot;Yankee whalers&quot; from the new American colonies replaced the Basques. Setting out from Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Long Island, New York, they took up to a hundred animals in good years. By 1750, the commercial hunt of the North Atlantic right whale was essentially over. The Yankee whalers moved into the South Atlantic before the end of the 18th century. The southernmost Brazilian whaling station was established in 1796, in Imbituba. Over the next hundred years, Yankee whaling spread into the Southern and Pacific Oceans, where the Americans were joined by fleets from several European nations. The beginning of the 20th century saw much greater industrialization of whaling, and the harvest grew rapidly. According to whalers&#x27; records, by 1937 there had been 38,000 takes in the South Atlantic, 39,000 in the South Pacific, 1,300 in the Indian Ocean, and 15,000 in the North Pacific. The incompleteness of these records means the actual take was somewhat higher.

As it became clear the stocks were nearly depleted, the world banned right whaling in 1937. The ban was largely successful, although violations continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two right whales in 1968. Japan took twenty-three Pacific right whales in the 1940s and more under scientific permit in the 1960s. Illegal whaling continued off the coast of Brazil for many years, and the Imbituba land station processed right whales until 1973. The Soviet Union illegally took at least 3,212 southern right whales during the 1950s and &#x27;60s, although it reported taking only four.

===Whale watching===

The southern right whale has made Hermanus, South Africa, one of the world centers for whale watching. During the winter months (July–October), southern right whales come so close to the shoreline, visitors can watch whales from strategically placed hotels. The town employs a &quot;whale crier&quot; (cf. town crier) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen. In Brazil, Imbituba in Santa Catarina has been recognized as the National Right Whale Capital and holds annual Right Whale Week celebrations in September when mothers and calves are more often seen. The old whaling station there has been converted to a museum dedicated to the whales. In winter in Argentina, Península Valdés in Patagonia hosts the largest breeding population of the species, with more than 2,000 animals catalogued by the Whale Conservation Institute and Ocean Alliance.

==Conservation==
Both the North Atlantic and North Pacific species are listed as a &quot;species threatened with extinction which [is] or may be affected by trade&quot; (Appendix I) by CITES, and as &quot;endangered&quot; by the IUCN Red List. In the United States, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), a subagency of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has classified all three species as &quot;endangered&quot; under the Endangered Species Act. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, they are listed as &quot;depleted&quot;.

The southern right whale is listed as &quot;endangered&quot; under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, as &quot;nationally endangered&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System, as a &quot;natural monument&quot; by the Argentine National Congress, and as a &quot;State Natural Monument&quot; under the Brazilian National Endangered Species List.

The U.S. and Brazil added new protections for right whales in the 2000s to address the two primary hazards. While environmental campaigners were, as reported in 2001, pleased about the plan&#x27;s positive effects, they attempted to force the US government to do more. In particular, they advocated speed limits for ships within of US ports in times of high right whale presence. Citing concerns about excessive trade disruption, it did not institute greater protections. The Defenders of Wildlife, the Humane Society of the United States and the Ocean Conservancy sued the NMFS in September 2005 for &quot;failing to protect the critically endangered North Atlantic Right Whale, which the agency acknowledges is &#x27;the rarest of all large whale species&#x27; and which federal agencies are required to protect by both the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act&quot;, demanding emergency protection measures.

The southern right whale, listed as &quot;endangered&quot; by CITES and &quot;lower risk - conservation dependent&quot; by the IUCN, is protected in the jurisdictional waters of all countries with known breeding populations (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay). In Brazil, a federal Environmental Protection Area encompassing some and of coastline in Santa Catarina State was established in 2000 to protect the species&#x27; main breeding grounds in Brazil and promote whale watching.

On February 6, 2006, NOAA proposed its Strategy to Reduce Ship Strikes to North Atlantic Right Whales. The proposal, opposed by some shipping interests, limited ship speeds during calving season. The proposal was made official when on December 8, 2008, NOAA issued a press release that included the following:

* Effective January 2009, ships or longer are limited to in waters off New England when whales begin gathering in this area as part of their annual migration. The restriction extends to around major mid-Atlantic ports.
* The speed restriction applies in waters off New England and the southeastern US, where whales gather seasonally:
** Southeastern US from St. Augustine, Florida to Brunswick, Georgia from Nov 15 to April 15
** Mid-Atlantic U.S. areas from Rhode Island to Georgia from Nov 1 to April 30.
** Cape Cod Bay from Jan 1 to May 15
** Off Race Point at the northern end of Cape Cod from March 1 to April 30
** Great South Channel of New England from April 1 to July 31
* Temporary voluntary speed limits in other areas or times when a group of three or more right whales is confirmed
* Scientists would assess the rule&#x27;s effectiveness before the rule expires in 2013.

In 2020, NOAA published its assessment and found that since the speed rule was adopted, the total number of documented deaths from vessel strike decreased but serious and non-serious injuries have increased. A report by the organization Oceana found that between 2017 and 2020, disobedience of the rule reached close to 90% in mandatory speed zones while in voluntary areas, disobedience neared 85%.

===Threats===
The leading cause of death among the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates through some of the world&#x27;s busiest shipping lanes while journeying off the east coast of the United States and Canada, is being struck by ships. At least sixteen ship-strike deaths were reported between 1970 and 1999, and probably more remain unreported. According to NOAA, twenty-five of the seventy-one right whale deaths reported since 1970 resulted from ship strikes.

A second major cause of morbidity and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in plastic fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.

In 2012, the U.S. Navy proposed to create a new undersea naval training range immediately adjacent to northern right whale calving grounds in shallow waters off the Florida/Georgia border. Legal challenges by leading environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council were denied in federal court, allowing the Navy to proceed. These rulings were made despite the extremely low numbers (as low as 313 by some estimates) of right whales in existence at this time, and a very poor calving season.

<doc id="301743" wikidata="Q244410" url="?curid=301743" title="Southern right whale">
<text>The southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) is a baleen whale, one of three species classified as right whales belonging to the genus &quot;Eubalaena&quot;. Southern right whales inhabit oceans south of the Equator, between the latitudes of 20° and 60° south. In 2009 the global population was estimated to be approximately 13,600.
== Taxonomy ==
Right whales were first classified in the genus &quot;Balaena&quot; in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, who at the time considered all right whales (including the bowhead) to be a single species. In the 19th and 20th centuries the family Balaenidae was the subject of great taxonometric debate. Authorities have repeatedly recategorised the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale, as one, two, three or four species, either in a single genus or in two separate genera. In the early whaling days, they were all thought to be a single species, &quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot;.

The southern right whale was initially described as &quot;Balaena australis&quot; by Desmoulins in 1822. Eventually, it was recognised that bowheads and right whales were different, and John Edward Gray proposed the genus &quot;Eubalaena&quot; for the right whale in 1864. Later, morphological factors such as differences in the skull shape of northern and southern right whales indicated at least two species of right whale—one in the Northern Hemisphere, the other in the Southern Ocean. As recently as 1998, Rice, in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification, &quot;Marine mammals of the world: systematics and distribution&quot;, listed just two species: &quot;Balaena glacialis&quot; (all of the right whales) and &quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot; (the bowheads).

In 2000, Rosenbaum et al. disagreed, based on data from their genetic study of DNA samples from each of the whale populations. Genetic evidence now shows that the northern and southern populations of right whale have not interbred for between 3 million and 12 million years, confirming the southern right whale as a distinct species. The northern Pacific and Atlantic populations are also distinct, with the North Pacific right whale being more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale. Genetic differences between &quot;E. japonica&quot; (North Pacific) and &quot;E. australis&quot; (South Pacific) are much smaller than other baleen whales represent among different ocean basins.

It is believed that the right whale populations first split because of the joining of North and South America when the Panama isthmus formed. The rising temperatures at the equator then created a second split, into the northern and southern groups, preventing them from interbreeding.

In 2002, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) accepted Rosenbaum&#x27;s findings, and recommended that the &quot;Eubalaena&quot; nomenclature be retained for this genus.

The cladogram is a tool for visualising and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa. The point where a node branches off is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the southern right whale and the other members of its family.



Other junior synonyms for &quot;E. australis&quot; have included &quot;B. antarctica&quot; (Lesson, 1828), &quot;B. antipodarum&quot; (Gray, 1843), &quot;Hunterus temminckii&quot; (Gray, 1864), and &quot;E. glacialis australis&quot; (Tomilin, 1962) (see side panel for more synonyms).

== Description ==

Like other right whales, the southern right whale is readily distinguished from others by the callosities on its head, a broad back without a dorsal fin, and a long arching mouth that begins above the eye. Its skin is very dark grey or black, occasionally with some white patches on the belly. The right whale&#x27;s callosities appear white due to large colonies of cyamids (whale lice). It is almost indistinguishable from the closely related North Atlantic and the North Pacific right whales, displaying only minor skull differences. It may have fewer callosities on its head than North Atlantic and more on its lower lips than the two northern species. The biological functions of callosities are unclear, although protection against predators has been put forward as the primal role.

An adult female is and can weigh up to , with the larger records of in length and or up to in weight, making them slightly smaller than other right whales in the Northern Hemisphere. The testicles of right whales are likely to be the largest of any animal, each weighing around . This suggests that sperm competition is important in the mating process.

The proportion and numbers of molten-coloured individuals are notable in this species compared with the other species in the Northern Hemisphere. Some whales remain white even after growing up.

The median lifespan is around 73, with some individuals surviving to over 130.

== Behaviour ==

Like other right whales, they are rather active on the water surface and curious towards human vessels. Southern rights appear to be more active and tend to interact with humans more than the other two northern species. One behaviour unique to the southern right whale, known as &quot;tail sailing&quot;, is that of using their elevated flukes to catch the wind, remaining in the same position for a considerable amount of time. It appears to be a form of play and is most commonly seen off the coast of Argentina and South Africa. Some other species such as humpback whales are also known to display. Right whales are often seen interacting with other cetaceans, especially humpback whales and dolphins. There have been records of southern rights and humpbacks thought to be involved in mating activities off Mozambique, and along Bahia, Brazil.

A female southern right whale was spotted off the coast of Western Australia accompanying a lone humpback whale calf, although the actual relationship of this pair is unclear.

=== Reproduction ===
Southern right whales display strong maternal fidelity to their calving grounds. Calving females are known to return to calving grounds at 3-year intervals. The most commonly observed calving interval is 3 years, but intervals can range from 2 to 21 years. Calving takes place between June and November in calving grounds between 20 and 30° S.

In Australia, southern right whales have shown a preference for calving grounds along coastlines with high wave energy, such as the Head of the Bight. Here, the sound of breaking waves may mask the sound of the whales&#x27; presence, and so protect infants and calving cows from predators such as killer whales. Deep waters alongside shallower calving grounds may serve as training grounds for calves to build up their stamina ahead of migration.

Females give birth to their first calf when they are between eight and ten years old. A single calf is born after a gestation period of one year, about in weight and in length. The calf usually remains with its mother during the first year of its life, during which time it will double in length.

Southern right whales have been observed nursing unrelated orphans on occasions.

=== Feeding ===
Like right whales in other oceans, southern right whales feed almost exclusively on zooplankton, particularly krill. They feed just beneath the water&#x27;s surface, holding their mouths partly open and skimming water continuously while swimming. They strain the water out through their long baleen plates to capture their prey. A southern right whale&#x27;s baleen can measure up to long, and is made up of 220–260 baleen plates.

== Population and distribution ==
The global population of southern right whales was estimated at 13,611 in 2009. An estimate published by National Geographic in October 2008 put the southern whale population at 10,000. A population estimate of 7,000 followed a March 1998 IWC workshop. Researchers used population data from three surveys of adult females in the 1990s (Argentina, South Africa and Australia). They extrapolated to include the population of unsurveyed areas, and used known male-to-female and adult-to-calf ratios to estimate and include numbers of males and calves. Recovery of the overall population size of the species is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100 due to heavier impacts of whaling and slower recovery rates. Since hunting ceased, the population is estimated to have grown by 7% a year.

The southern right whale spends summer in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to Antarctica. If the opportunity arises, feeding can occur even in temperate waters such as along Buenos Aires. It migrates north in winter for breeding and can be seen by the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Namibia, Mozambique, Peru, Tristan de Cunha, Uruguay, Madagascar, New Zealand and South Africa; whales have also been known to winter in sub-Antarctic regions. It appears that the South American, South African and Australasian groups intermix very little if at all, because maternal fidelity to feeding and calving habitats is very strong. The mother also passes these choices to her calves.

Right whales do not normally cross the warm equatorial waters to connect with the other species and (inter)breed: their thick layers of insulating blubber make it difficult for them to dissipate their internal body heat in tropical waters. Based on historical records and unconfirmed sightings in modern periods, &quot;E. australis&quot; transits may sometimes occur through equatorial waters.

Whaling records for the hemisphere include a whaling ground in the central northern Indian Ocean and recent sightings among near-equatorial regions. If the sighting off Kiribati was truly of &quot;E. australis&quot;, this species may have crossed the Equator on irregular occasions and their original distributions might have been much broader and more northerly distributed than is currently believed. A stranding of a 21.3 m (71 feet) right whale at Gajana, northwestern India in November 1944 was reported, but the true identity of this animal is unclear.

Aside from impacts on whales and environments caused by mankind, their distributions and residences could be largely affected by presences of natural predators or enemies, and similar trends are also probable for other subspecies.

Many locations throughout the Southern Hemisphere were named after current or former presences of southern rights, including Walvis Bay, Punta Ballena, Right Whale Bay, Otago Harbour, Whangarei Harbour, Foveaux Strait, South Taranaki Bight, Moutohora Island and Wineglass Bay.

=== Africa ===

==== South Africa ====
Hermanus in South Africa has become known as a centre for whale watching. During the Southern Hemisphere winter months (June – October) the southern right whales migrate to the coastal waters of South Africa, with more than 100 whales known to visit the Hermanus area. Whilst in the area, the whales can be seen with their young as they come to Walker Bay to calve and mate. Many behaviours such as breaching, sailing, lobtailing, or spyhopping can be witnessed. In False Bay whales can be seen from the shore from July to October while both Plettenberg Bay and Algoa Bay are also home to the southern right whales from July to December. They can be viewed from land as well as by boat with licensed operators conducting ocean safaris throughout the year.

Recent increases in numbers of whales visiting the north-eastern part of South Africa, the so-called Dolphin Coast such as around Ballito and off Umdloti Beach, indicates the whales&#x27; normal ranges are expanding and that re-colonising historical habitats will likely continue as more whales migrate further north.

==== Western Africa ====
In Namibia, the majority of confirmed whales are restricted to the south of Luderitz, on the southwestern coast. Only a handful of animals venture further north to historical breeding grounds such as at Walvis Bay, but their numbers are slowly increasing. Until illegal hunting ceased, whales were rare along Namibian shores, with no sighting recorded north of Orange River until 1971. Calving activities were first confirmed as recently as the 1980s.

Historical records suggest that this whale&#x27;s regular range could have once reached further northwards up the coasts of Cape Fria (northern Namibia) and Angola as far as Baia dos Tigres (Tiger Bay).

Whaling is known to have been carried out off the coast of Gabon, for example at Cape Lopez, and there have been a few confirmed and unconfirmed sightings including one by Jim Darling, a renowned whale researcher.

==== Eastern Africa ====

Southern right whales have been spotted in very small numbers off Mozambique and Madagascar. Whales were historically seen in large numbers at various locations such as off the coast of Durban, in Delagoa/Maputo Bay, Inhaca Island, Ponta do Ouro, and around the Bazaruto Archipelago. The first sighting off Mozambique since the end of whaling was in 1997. In recent years, more whales seem to migrate further north to calve, such as at Île Sainte-Marie, Antongil Bay, Fort Dauphin Toliara, Anakao, Andavadoaka, and Antsiranana Bay, at Madagascar&#x27;s northern tip. Infrequent sightings have been confirmed off the island of Mayotte. Whales were historically taken off the coast of Tanzania, and may still be present occasionally around Zanzibar.

==== Mid–South Atlantic ====
Due to illegal whaling by the USSR, the recovery of many stocks including the population off Tristan da Cunha and adjacent areas such as Gough Island has been severely hindered, resulting in relatively few numbers of visiting animals.

Based on catch records and recent observations, right whales may be seen as far north as the islands of Saint Helena and Ascension Island.

=== South America ===

==== Brazil ====

In Brazil, more than 300 individuals have been cataloged through photo identification (using head callosities) by the Brazilian Right Whale Project, maintained jointly by Petrobras (the Brazilian state-owned oil company), and the conservation group, the International Wildlife Coalition. The State of Santa Catarina hosts a concentration of breeding and calving right whales from June to November, and females from this population also calve off Argentinian Patagonia and Uruguay. In recent years, possibly due to changing habitat environments by human activities and conflicts with local fisheries, the number of whales visiting the coasts is decreasing. Sighting in locations other than Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul remain sporadic, such as along Cidreira, Rio de Janeiro coasts like Sepetiba Bay (pt), Cabo Frio, Macaé, Prado, Bahia, Castelhanos Bay in Ilha Bela, São Paulo coasts such as within Ilha Anchieta State Park, Honey Island, and bays and estuaries of Paranaguá and Superagui National Park, Paraná, and even entering into the lagoon of Lagoa dos Patos. Recent studies also show a decrease in the number of sightings along the southeastern Brazilian coast, which includes the highly urbanized States of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

Further north, small numbers of whales migrate every year to winter or calve in Bahia, in particular at the Abrolhos Archipelago. Here, certain individuals are recorded returning at intervals of 3 or 4 years. Whaling records including those prior to Maury and Townsend indicate that right whales were once more frequent visitors further north, for example at Salvador, Bahia.

==== Argentina ====

Argentina hosts the world&#x27;s largest breeding population of southern right whales at Península Valdés, Chubut province, with over 2000 estimated individuals gathering on the gulfs of the peninsula during breeding season. The whales are considered a &quot;natural monument&quot; and protected under Argentine law, and there is a developed whale-watching tourism around them.

During the 2012 annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission&#x27;s Scientific Committee, data was presented regarding the continued phenomenon of southern right whale strandings and high rate of mortality at Península Valdés. Between 2003 and 2011, a total of 482 dead right whales were recorded at Península Valdés. There were at least 55 whale deaths in 2010, and 61 in 2011. As in previous years, the vast majority of strandings were calves of the season.
There have been increasing sightings in various other locations in recent years, such as on Golfo San Jorge, Tierra del Fuego, Puerto Deseado, Mar del Plata, Miramar, Buenos Aires, and Bahía Blanca.

==== Uruguay ====
In Uruguay, coastal areas such as Punta del Este host congregating sites for whales in breeding seasons, but these are not likely to be calving grounds. In 2013 the Uruguayan parliament approved the creation of a whale sanctuary off Latin America to aid the recovery of the population. The creation of this protected area had been prevented for nearly a decade by pro-whaling nations such as Japan.

==== Chile and Peru ====
For the critically endangered Chile/Peru population, the Cetacean Conservation Center (CCC) has been working on a separate programme for right whales. This population, containing no more than 50 individuals, is under threat from an increase in shipping lanes and the fishing industries. 124 sightings in total were recorded during the period 1964–2008. Aside from vagrants&#x27; records, Peru&#x27;s coastlines possibly host one of the northernmost confirmed range of the species along with Gabon, Senegal, Tanzania, Brazilian coasts, Madagascar, Indian Ocean, western Australia, Kermadec Islands, and tropical waters including South Pacific Islands. The Alfaguara project targeting cetaceans in Chiloe may possibly target this species as well in the future since calving activities have been confirmed in Chiloé Archipelago. Foraging grounds of this population is currently undetected, but possibly Chiloé and down south of Caleta Zorra to southern fiords such as from Penas Gulf to Beagle Channel although numbers of confirmations are small in the Beagle Channel. Hopes are arising for the establishment of a new tourism industry on the eastern side of the Strait of Magellan, especially near Cape Virgenes and Punta Dungeness, as the number of sightings increases. It is unknown whether these increases are due to re-colonisation by whales from the Patagonian population.

Occurrences of brindle individuals have been confirmed from this population as well.

=== Oceania ===
Historically, populations of southern right whales in Oceanian regions were robust. Early settlers of the River Derwent in Tasmania complained that sounds of cavorting whales kept them awake at night. (Similar stories exist about Wellington, New Zealand, but no primary sources could be found to support them.) In July 1804, clergyman Robert Knopwood claimed that in crossing the River Derwent, &quot;we passed so many whales that it was dangerous for the boat to go up the river unless you kept very near the shore&quot;. 
By the 1890s southern right whales had been brought to the brink of extinction, with over 25,000 whales killed in Australia and New Zealand.

Studies of population structure and mating systems have shown that the southwest Australian and New Zealand populations are genetically differentiated. The results of satellite tracking suggest that there are at least some interactions between populations in Australia and New Zealand, but the extent of this is unknown. The two groups may share migratory corridors and calving grounds. The return of southern right whales to the Derwent River and other parts of Australia in recent decades is a sign that they are slowly recovering from their earlier exploitation to near extinction.

==== Australia ====

Southern right whales in Australian waters show higher rate of recoveries, as they have increased from 2,100 whales in 2008 to 3,500 in 2010. Two genetically distinct groups inhabit Australian waters: the southwestern population of 2,900 whales – in 2012 currently holding the majority of the overall Australian population – and the critically endangered southeastern group, counting only dozens to 300 individuals.

===== South Australia =====
Right whales can be found in many parts of southern Australia, where the largest population is found at the Head of the Bight in South Australia, a sparsely populated area south of the middle of the Nullarbor Plain. Over 100 individuals are seen there annually from June to October. Visitors can view the whales from cliff-top boardwalks and lookouts, with whales swimming almost directly below, or by taking a scenic flight over the marine park. A more accessible South Australian location for viewing whales is Encounter Bay where the whales can be seen just off the beaches of the Fleurieu Peninsula, centred around the surfing town of Middleton. The whales have established a newer nursery-ground near Eyre Peninsula, especially at Fowlers Bay. Numbers are much smaller at these locations compared to those in the Bight, with an average of a couple of whales per day, but there were regular sightings of more than ten whales at a time off Basham Beach, near Middleton. The South Australian Whale Centre at Victor Harbor has information on the history of whaling and whale-watching in the area, and maintains an on-line database of whale sightings.
In June 2021 a female gave birth off Christies Beach, a southern suburb of Adelaide, and remained in the shallows off the beach for some time, attracting large crowds.

===== Victoria and Tasmania =====
Whale numbers are scarcer in Victoria, where the only established breeding ground which whales use each year, in very small numbers, is at Warrnambool. However, as the whales do seem to be increasing in number generally, but not showing any dramatic increases at Warrnambool, they may be extending their wintering habitats into other areas of Victoria, where the numbers of sightings are slowly increasing. These areas include around Melbourne, such as in Port Phillip Bay, along Waratah Bay, at Ocean Grove, Warrnambool, on Mornington Peninsula, in Apollo Bay, and on Gippsland coasts and at Wilsons Promontory.

Whale numbers in Tasmania are relatively small, however sightings have increased in recent years. Some whales migrate through Tasmanian waters while some others remain throughout wintering seasons.

===== Other states and territories =====

Waters off the coasts of Western Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland coasts have all historically been inhabited by whales. Their historical range was much wider than it is today, and reached around the southern coast of the continent, extending up to Australian Abrolhos Island, Exmouth and Shark Bay on the west coast, and on the east coast as far north as Hervey Bay, Moreton Bay and Great Barrier Reef. Today, the east-coast population remains endangered and very small (in the low-tens), contributing to small numbers and limited re-colonization, but increases have been confirmed in many areas such as Port Jackson, Port Stephens, Twofold Bay, Jervis Bay, Broulee, Moruya River, Narooma, and Byron Bay. 12 foraging areas have been officially announced by the Australian government.

In sub-Antarctic regions, numbers of whales visiting long-used habitats differ drastically by location. The population is recovering well at the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands, while whale numbers are less successful at Macquarie Island.

It is not known whether Australian populations will re-colonise historical oceanic habitats such as Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island with Lord Howe Seamount Chain (historically known as the &quot;Middle Ground&quot; for whalers)
in the future.

==== New Zealand ====
The current population of right whales in New Zealand waters is difficult to establish. However, studies by the Department of Conservation and sightings reported by locals have helped to build up a better picture. The pre-exploitation size of the New Zealand group is estimated at between 28,800 and 47,100 whales. 35,000 – 41,000 catches were made between 1827 and 1980. The number of whales surviving commercial and illegal whaling operations is estimated to have decreased to just 110 whales (around 30 of which were females) in 1915. As a result of such a steep decline in numbers, the population of southern right whales in this region has experienced a population bottleneck and suffers from low genetic diversity.

The population at the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands is showing a remarkable recovery but continues to have some of the lowest genetic diversities in the world. In the Campbell Islands, recovery is slower. Here, the population is estimated to have dropped to as low as 20 individuals post WWII. There had been no confirmed sightings or strandings of right whales for 36 years until 1963 when four separate sightings including a cow-calf pair were made over a wide area. Remnants of sub-Antarctic populations were reported in the 1980s and re-discovered in the 1990s.

Today, the majority of right whales congregate at the Auckland and Campbell Islands, where they form exceptionally dense and limited congregations including mating adults and calving females. In the waters around Port Ross up to 200 whales may winter at the same time. It is notable that whales of all age groups are present in this small area annually, not only using them as feeding and summering grounds but also for wintering, breeding, and calving during harsh, cold periods. Low genetic diversity as a result of population decline has caused changes in skin coloration amongst this group.
Scientists used to believe there was a very small remnant population of southern right whales inhabiting New Zealand&#x27;s main islands (North and South Island), estimated to contain 11 reproductive females. In winter, whales migrate north to New Zealand waters and large concentrations occasionally visit the southern coasts of South Island. Bay areas along Foveaux Strait from Fiordland region to northern Otago are important breeding habitats for right whales, especially Preservation, Chalky Inlets, Te Waewae Bay, and Otago Peninsula. Calving activities are observed all around New Zealand, but with more regularity around North Island shores from the Taranaki coast in the west to Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Bay of Plenty in the east, and areas in Hauraki Gulf such as Firth of Thames or Bay of Islands in the north.

There are various parts of the nation where large numbers of whales were seen historically, but sightings are less common nowadays. These areas include the Marlborough Region, especially from Clifford Bay and Cloudy Bay to Port Underwood, Golden Bay, Awaroa Bay, and coastlines on West Coast and Hokianga Harbour in Northland. Other than a handful of confirmed observations, very little information is available for modern migrations to historical oceanic habitats of Kermadec Islands and Chatham Islands. The northernmost sighting recorded historically was at 27°S.

A 2009 study revealed that the right whale populations from New Zealand&#x27;s main islands and the sub-Antarctic islands interbreed, though it is still unknown whether the two stock originally came from a single population. Feeding areas in pelagic waters are unclear while congregations have been confirmed along the southern edge of the Chatham Rise.

Some Australian ranges are located close to the ranges of New Zealand groups (Norfolk Island, Macquarie Island). It is unclear whether whales historically or currently from these Australian ranges once originated in New Zealand groups.

=== Other ===

In oceanic islands and offshore waters other than the above-mentioned areas, very little about the presence and recovery status of southern right whales is known. Right whales&#x27; historical ranges were much greater than today; during the whaling era of the 19th century whales were known to occur in lower latitude areas such as around the Pacific Islands, off the Gilbert Islands (nowadays Kiribati), and also to frequent lower latitudes of the central Indian Ocean.

It is unclear whether right whales have been historically or currently distributed among parts of hemisphere lacking great land masses and reached far more pelagic islands such as Alejandro Selkirk and Robinson Crusoe Islands, Hanga Roa, Pitcairn, Galapagos Islands, and the Easter Island.

Populations among sub-Antarctic islands in the Scotia Sea such as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and Falkland Islands were severely damaged and show slower recoveries today. Antarctic distributions are difficult to establish due to low levels of sightings around oceanic islands in these areas, including Elephant Island.

==== Indian Ocean ====
Historically, there were known to be populations which summered in the Crozet Islands and the Kerguelen Islands, and migrated to La Roche Godon and Île Saint-Paul, Île Amsterdam, and the Central Indian Ocean. They may be distinct from the population of whales seen on Mozambique coasts. Repopulation of whales among these areas of the Indian Ocean is likely to be happening at even lower rates than in other areas. Sightings have been fewer in modern periods among Crozet, Réunion, Mauritius, Marion Islands, Île Amsterdam, and Kerguelen.

Killings of these whales have been recorded on central Indian Ocean near the equator, especially around the area between Diego Garcia, Egmont Islands, and the Great Chagos Bank in the west, and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the east. The range of whales in the Indian Ocean is comparable to the range of some other populations around South America, Africa, and the South Pacific islands including Kiribati, the northernmost reach of all the populations known today.

== Whaling ==
By 1750 the North Atlantic right whale was as good as extinct for commercial purposes, and the American whalers moved into the South Atlantic before the end of the 18th century. The most southerly Brazilian whaling station was established in 1796, in Imbituba. Over the next hundred years, American whaling spread into the Southern and Pacific Oceans, where the American fleet was joined by fleets from several European nations.

The southern right whale had been coming to Australian and New Zealand waters in large numbers before the 19th century, but was extensively hunted from 1800 to 1850. Hunting gradually declined with the whale population and then all but ended in coastal waters in Australasia. The beginning of the 20th century brought industrial whaling, and the catch grew rapidly. By 1937, according to whalers&#x27; records, 38,000 were harpooned in the South Atlantic, 39,000 in the South Pacific, and 1,300 in the Indian Ocean. Given the incompleteness of these records, the total take was somewhat higher.

As it became clear that the population was nearly depleted, the harpooning of right whales was banned in 1937. The ban was largely successful, although some illegal whaling continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two right whales in 1968. Illegal whaling continued off the coast of Brazil for years, and the Imbituba station processed right whales until 1973. The USSR admitted to taking illegally over 3,300 during the 1950s and 1960s, although it only reported taking 4.

Illegal operations continued even in the 1970s, such as the case in Brazil until 1973. It was also revealed that Japan was supporting these destructive hunts by neglecting and disregarding its monitoring obligations. There were agreements between Japan and the Soviet Union to keep their illegal mass whaling activities in foreign/international protected waters secret.

Right whales began to be seen again in Australian and New Zealand waters from the early 1960s. It is possible that if the Soviet hunts had never happened, the New Zealand population would be three or four times larger than its current size.

== Conservation ==
The southern right whale, listed as &quot;endangered&quot; by CITES, is protected by all countries with known breeding populations (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay). In Argentina, it is considered a &quot;Natural Monument&quot; under national law Nº 23094, with all whales sighted on Argentine waters under legal protection. In Brazil, a federal Environmental Protection Area encompassing some and of coastline in Santa Catarina State was established in 2000 to protect the species&#x27; main breeding grounds in Brazil and promote regulated whale watching. The southern right whale is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range. This species is also covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU). In 2017, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species listed the species&#x27; status as Least Concern with a population trend listed as &quot;unknown&quot;.

In Australia, Southern right whales are listed for protection variously under state and federal legislation, as reflected in the table below:

A two-year, £740,000 project, led by the British Antarctic Survey began in 2016, to discover why almost 500 young have been washed up on the Valdes Peninsula over the last ten years. The project is funded by the UK&#x27;s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the EU. Possible reasons are a lack of krill in the whale feeding grounds at South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, exposure to toxic algae and attacks by kelp gulls (&quot;Larus dominicanus&quot;).
=== Gull attacks ===
One possibly significant contributor to the calf mortality rate has alarmed scientists – since at least 1996, kelp gulls off the coast of Patagonia have been observed attacking and feeding on live right whales. The kelp gull uses its powerful beak to peck down several centimetres into the skin and blubber, often leaving the whales with large open sores – some of which have been observed to be half a metre in diameter. This predatory behaviour, primarily targeted towards mother/calf pairs, has been continually documented in Argentinian waters, and continues today. Observers note that the whales are spending up to a third of their time and energy performing evasive manoeuvres – therefore, mothers spend less time nursing, and the calves are thinner and weaker as a result. Researchers speculate that many years ago, waste from fish processing plants allowed the gull populations to soar. Their resulting overpopulation, combined with reduced waste output, caused the gulls to seek out this alternative food source. Scientists fear that the gulls&#x27; learned behaviour could proliferate, and the IWC Scientific Committee has urged Brazil to consider taking immediate action if and when similar gull behaviour is observed in their waters. Such action may include the removal of attacking gulls, following Argentina&#x27;s lead in attempting to reverse the trend.

=== Threats ===
Southern right whales are threatened by entanglement in commercial fishing gear and ship strikes. Entanglement in fishing gear can cut through a whale&#x27;s skin, causing infection, amputation and death. Underwater noise from human activities such as drilling and dredging can interfere with whales&#x27; communication, and deter them from their usual habitats and breeding grounds.

== Whale watching ==
=== Africa ===
The southern right whale has made Hermanus, South Africa, one of the world centres for whale watching. During the winter months (June to October), southern right whales come so close to the shoreline that visitors can watch them from the shore as well as from strategically placed hotels. The town employs a &quot;whale crier&quot; (cf. town crier) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen. Hermanus also has two boat–based whale watching operators. Southern right whales can also be watched at False Bay from the shore or from the boats of operators in Simon&#x27;s Town. Plettenberg Bay along the Garden Route of South Africa is also known for whale watching including both land and boat based watching, not only for southern rights (July to December) but throughout the year. Southern right whales can also be seen off the coast of Port Elizabeth with marine eco tours running from the Port Elizabeth harbour, as some southern right whales make Algoa Bay their home for the winter months.

Although southern right whales have been seen in neighboring countries including Namibia, Mozambique, and Madagascar, they are not the targeted species for whale watching tours in these countries.

=== South America ===

In Brazil, Imbituba in Santa Catarina has been recognised as the National Right Whale Capital and holds annual Right Whale Week celebrations in September, when mothers and calves are more often seen. The old whaling station there is now a museum that documents the history of right whales in Brazil. In Argentina, Península Valdés in Patagonia hosts (in winter) the largest breeding population, with more than 2,000 catalogued by the Whale Conservation Institute and Ocean Alliance. As in the south of Argentina, the whales come within of the main beach in the city of Puerto Madryn and form a part of the large ecotourism industry. Uruguay&#x27;s Parliament on 4 September 2013, has become the first country in the world to make all of its territorial waters a haven for whales and dolphins. Every year, dozens of whales are sighted, especially in the departments of Maldonado and Rocha during winter. Swimming activities for commercial objectives had been banned in the area in 1985, but were legalised in Gulf of San Matías, the only place in the world where humans are formally allowed to swim with the species. Land-based watching and occasional kayaking with whales activities are seen at other locations not renowned for whale-watching as much as Puerto Madryn and with less restrictions on approaching whales, such as at Puerto Deseado, Mar del Plata, and Miramar in Buenos Aires.

Though their numbers are dangerously small, land-based sightings of whales are on the increase in recent years off Chile and Peru, with some hope of creating new tourism industries, especially in the Strait of Magellan, most notably around Cape Virgenes.

=== Oceania ===

In Australia&#x27;s winter and spring, southern right whales can be seen migrating along the Great Australian Bight in South Australia. Viewing locations include the Bunda Cliffs and Twin Rocks, the Head of the Bight (where a visitor centre and cliff-top viewing boardwalks exist) and at Fowler&#x27;s Bay where accommodation and charter boat tours are offered. Another popular South Australian locality for Southern right whale watching is Encounter Bay, where the South Australian Whale Centre supports local whale-watchers and tourists. In Warrnambool, Victoria, a right whale nursery is also a popular tourist attraction. The whales&#x27; migratory range is extending as the species continues to recover and re-colonize other areas of the continent, including the coastal waters of New South Wales and Tasmania. In Tasmania, the first birth since the 19th century was recorded in 2010 in the River Derwent.

Similarly, southern right whales may provide chances for the public to observe whales from shore on New Zealand&#x27;s coasts with greater regularity than in the past, especially in southern Fiordland, Southland through to the Otago coast, and on the North Island coast, especially in Northland and other locations such as the Bay of Plenty and the South Taranaki Bight. Births of calves could have always been occurring on the main islands&#x27; coasts, but were confirmed with two cow-calf pairs in 2012.

=== Subantarctic ===
In the Subantarctic Islands and in the vicinity of Antarctica, where few regulations exist or are enforced, whales can be observed on expedition tours with increasing probability. The Auckland Islands are a specially designated sanctuary for right whales, where whale-watching tourism is prohibited without authorisation.

==Popular culture==
The species was featured on a 70p commemorative stamp issued by Tristan da Cunha in 2019 as part of a set celebrating different species of whale.

<text>Saalkreis was a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the south of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from west clockwise) Mansfelder Land, Bernburg, Köthen, Bitterfeld, the district Delitzsch in Saxony, and the district Merseburg-Querfurt. The district-free city Halle is nearly surrounded by the district.
== Geography ==
The main river of the district is the Saale, which also gave it its name. Other rivers and streams flowing through the former district are the Laweke, Würde, Kabelske, Strengbach and Götsche. Whilst the western part of the region is dominated by hillocks and dissecting valleys, the north and east are characterized by flat plains. The Petersberg near Halle, at , was the highest point of the former Saalkreis and lay in the northeast of the district.

<doc id="301750" wikidata="Q622975" url="?curid=301750" title="Magnus effect">
<text>The Magnus effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a spinning object is moving through a fluid or gas (air). A lift force acts on the spinning object and its path may be deflected in a manner not present when it is not spinning. The strength and direction of the Magnus effect is dependent on the speed and direction of the rotation of the object.

The Magnus effect is named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus, the German physicist who investigated it. The force on a rotating cylinder is an example of Kutta–Joukowski lift, named after Martin Kutta and Nikolay Zhukovsky (or Joukowski), mathematicians who contributed to the knowledge of how lift is generated in a fluid flow.

== Description ==
The most readily observable case of the Magnus effect is when a spinning sphere (or cylinder) curves away from the arc it would follow if it were not spinning. It is often used by football (soccer) and volleyball players, baseball pitchers, and cricket bowlers. Consequently, the phenomenon is important in the study of the physics of many ball sports. It is also an important factor in the study of the effects of spinning on guided missiles—and has some engineering uses, for instance in the design of rotor ships and Flettner airplanes.

Topspin in ball games is defined as spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the direction of travel that moves the top surface of the ball in the direction of travel. Under the Magnus effect, topspin produces a downward swerve of a moving ball, greater than would be produced by gravity alone. Backspin produces an upwards force that prolongs the flight of a moving ball. Likewise side-spin causes swerve to either side as seen during some baseball pitches, e.g. slider. The overall behaviour is similar to that around an aerofoil (see lift force), but with a circulation generated by mechanical rotation rather than shape of the foil.

In baseball, this effect is used to generate the downward motion of a curveball, in which the baseball is rotating forward (with &#x27;topspin&#x27;). Participants in other sports played with a ball also take advantage of this effect.

== Physics ==
The Magnus effect or Magnus force acts on a rotating body moving relative to a fluid. Examples include a &quot;curve ball&quot; in baseball or a tennis ball hit obliquely. The rotation alters the boundary layer between the object and the fluid. The force is perpendicular to the relative direction of motion and oriented towards the direction of rotation, i.e. the direction the &quot;nose&quot; of the ball is turning towards. The magnitude of the force depends primarily on the rotation rate, the relative velocity, and the geometry of the body; the magnitude also depends upon the body&#x27;s surface roughness and viscosity of the fluid. Accurate quantitative predictions of the force are difficult, but as with other examples of aerodynamic lift there are simpler, qualitative explanations:

===Flow deflection===
The diagram shows lift being produced on a back-spinning ball. The wake and trailing air-flow have been deflected downwards; according to Newton&#x27;s third law of motion there must be a reaction force in the opposite direction.

===Pressure differences===
The air&#x27;s viscosity and the surface roughness of the object cause the air to be carried around the object. This adds to the air velocity on one side of the object and decreases the velocity on the other side. Bernoulli&#x27;s principle states that under certain conditions increased flow speed is associated with reduced pressure, implying that there is lower air pressure on one side than the other. This pressure difference results in a force perpendicular to the direction of travel.

===Kutta–Joukowski lift===

On a cylinder, the force due to rotation is an example of Kutta–Joukowski lift. It can be analysed in terms of the vortex produced by rotation. The lift per unit length of the cylinder formula_1, is the product of the freestream velocity formula_2 (in m/s), the fluid density formula_3 (in kg/m3), and circulation formula_4 due to viscous effects:

:formula_5

where the vortex strength (assuming that the surrounding fluid obeys the no-slip condition) is given by

:formula_6

where &quot;ω&quot; is the angular velocity of the cylinder (in rad/s) and &quot;r&quot; is the radius of the cylinder (in m).

=== Inverse Magnus effect ===
In wind tunnel studies, (rough surfaced) baseballs show the Magnus effect, but smooth spheres do not. Further study has shown that certain combinations of conditions result in turbulence in the fluid on one side of the rotating body but laminar flow on the other side. In these cases are called the &quot;inverse Magnus effect:&quot; the deflection is opposite to that of the typical Magnus effect.

==Magnus effect in potential flow==

Potential flow is a mathematical model of the steady flow of a fluid with no viscosity or vorticity present. For potential flow around a circular cylinder, it provides the following results:

===Non-spinning cylinder===
The flow pattern is symmetric about a horizontal axis through the centre of the cylinder. At each point above the axis and its corresponding point below the axis, the spacing of streamlines is the same so velocities are also the same at the two points. Bernoulli’s principle shows that, outside the boundary layers, pressures are also the same at corresponding points. There is no lift acting on the cylinder.

===Spinning cylinder===
Streamlines are closer spaced immediately above the cylinder than below, so the air flows faster past the upper surface than past the lower surface. Bernoulli’s principle shows that the pressure adjacent to the upper surface is lower than the pressure adjacent to the lower surface. The Magnus force acts vertically upwards on the cylinder.

Streamlines immediately above the cylinder are curved with radius little more than the radius of the cylinder. This means there is low pressure close to the upper surface of the cylinder. Streamlines immediately below the cylinder are curved with a larger radius than streamlines above the cylinder. This means there is higher pressure acting on the lower surface than on the upper.

Air immediately above and below the cylinder is curving downwards, accelerated by the pressure gradient. A downwards force is acting on the air.

Newton&#x27;s third law predicts that the Magnus force and the downwards force acting on the air are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

== History ==
The effect is named after German physicist Heinrich Gustav Magnus who demonstrated the effect with a rapidly rotating brass cylinder and an air blower in 1852. In 1672, Isaac Newton had speculated on the effect after observing tennis players in his Cambridge college. In 1742, Benjamin Robins, a British mathematician, ballistics researcher, and military engineer, explained deviations in the trajectories of musket balls due to their rotation.

Pioneering wind tunnel research on the Magnus effect was carried out with smooth rotating spheres in 1928. Lyman Briggs later studied baseballs in a wind tunnel, and others have produced images of the effect. The studies show that a turbulent wake behind the spinning ball causes aerodynamic drag, plus there is a noticeable angular deflection in the wake, and this deflection is in the direction of spin.

== In sport ==
The Magnus effect explains commonly observed deviations from the typical trajectories or paths of spinning balls in sport, notably association football, table tennis, tennis, volleyball, golf, baseball, and cricket.

The curved path of a golf ball known as &quot;slice&quot; or &quot;hook&quot; is largely due to the ball&#x27;s spin axis being tilted away from the horizontal due to the combined effects of club face angle and swing path, causing the Magnus effect to act at an angle, moving the ball away from a straight line in its trajectory. Backspin (upper surface rotating backwards from the direction of movement) on a golf ball causes a vertical force that counteracts the force of gravity slightly, and enables the ball to remain airborne a little longer than it would were the ball not spinning: this allows the ball to travel farther than a ball not spinning about its horizontal axis.

In table tennis, the Magnus effect is easily observed, because of the small mass and low density of the ball. An experienced player can place a wide variety of spins on the ball. Table tennis rackets usually have a surface made of rubber to give the racket maximum grip on the ball to impart a spin.

In cricket, the Magnus effect contributes to the types of motion known as &quot;drift&quot;, &quot;dip&quot; and &quot;lift&quot; in spin bowling, depending on the axis of rotation of the spin applied to the ball. The Magnus effect is &quot;not&quot; responsible for the movement seen in conventional swing bowling, in which the pressure gradient is not caused by the ball&#x27;s spin, but rather by its raised seam, and the asymmetric roughness or smoothness of its two halves; however, the Magnus effect may be responsible for so-called &quot;Malinga Swing&quot;, as observed in the bowling of the swing bowler Lasith Malinga.

In airsoft, a system known as hop-up is used to create a backspin on a fired BB, which greatly increases its range, using the Magnus effect in a similar manner as in golf.

In baseball, pitchers often impart different spins on the ball, causing it to curve in the desired direction due to the Magnus effect. The PITCHf/x system measures the change in trajectory caused by Magnus in all pitches thrown in Major League Baseball.

The match ball for the 2010 FIFA World Cup has been criticised for the different Magnus effect from previous match balls. The ball was described as having less Magnus effect and as a result flies farther but with less controllable swerve.

== In external ballistics ==
The Magnus effect can also be found in advanced external ballistics. First, a spinning bullet in flight is often subject to a crosswind, which can be simplified as blowing from either the left or the right. In addition to this, even in completely calm air a bullet experiences a small sideways wind component due to its yawing motion. This yawing motion along the bullet&#x27;s flight path means that the nose of the bullet points in a slightly different direction from the direction the bullet travels. In other words, the bullet &quot;skids&quot; sideways at any given moment, and thus experiences a small sideways wind component in addition to any crosswind component.

The combined sideways wind component of these two effects causes a Magnus force to act on the bullet, which is perpendicular both to the direction the bullet is pointing and the combined sideways wind. In a very simple case where we ignore various complicating factors, the Magnus force from the crosswind would cause an upward or downward force to act on the spinning bullet (depending on the left or right wind and rotation), causing deflection of the bullet&#x27;s flight path up or down, thus influencing the point of impact.

Overall, the effect of the Magnus force on a bullet&#x27;s flight path itself is usually insignificant compared to other forces such as aerodynamic drag. However, it greatly affects the bullet&#x27;s stability, which in turn affects the amount of drag, how the bullet behaves upon impact, and many other factors. The stability of the bullet is affected, because the Magnus effect acts on the bullet&#x27;s centre of pressure instead of its centre of gravity. This means that it affects the yaw angle of the bullet; it tends to twist the bullet along its flight path, either towards the axis of flight (decreasing the yaw thus stabilising the bullet) or away from the axis of flight (increasing the yaw thus destabilising the bullet). The critical factor is the location of the centre of pressure, which depends on the flowfield structure, which in turn depends mainly on the bullet&#x27;s speed (supersonic or subsonic), but also the shape, air density and surface features. If the centre of pressure is ahead of the centre of gravity, the effect is destabilizing; if the centre of pressure is behind the centre of gravity, the effect is stabilising.

== In aviation ==

Some aircraft have been built to use the Magnus effect to create lift with a rotating cylinder instead of a wing, allowing flight at lower horizontal speeds. The earliest attempt to use the Magnus effect for a heavier-than-air aircraft was in 1910 by a US member of Congress, Butler Ames of Massachusetts. The next attempt was in the early 1930s by three inventors in New York state.

== Ship propulsion and stabilization ==

Rotor ships use mast-like cylinders, called Flettner rotors, for propulsion. These are mounted vertically on the ship&#x27;s deck. When the wind blows from the side, the Magnus effect creates a forward thrust. Thus, as with any sailing ship, a rotor ship can only move forwards when there is a wind blowing. The effect is also used in a special type of ship stabilizer consisting of a rotating cylinder mounted beneath the waterline and emerging laterally. By controlling the direction and speed of rotation, strong lift or downforce can be generated. The largest deployment of the system to date is in the motor yacht &quot;Eclipse&quot;.

<text>Junius Marion Futrell (August 14, 1870 – June 20, 1955) was an American attorney who served as the 30th governor of Arkansas from 1933 to 1937, and the acting governor for a short period in 1913. He also served in the Arkansas House of Representatives and Arkansas Senate including as the senate president.

==Early life==
Futrell was born in Jones Ridge in Greene County in northeastern Arkansas to parents Jepthra and Arminia Levonica Eubanks Futrell. The second of three children, he attended the Arkansas Industrial University, now the University of Arkansas School of Law, from 1892 to 1893. After his sophomore year, he taught school in several Arkansas counties until 1896, marrying Tera A. Smith on September 27, 1893. Futrell also farmed and worked in the timber industry before entering politics.

==Career==
Futrell was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives and served from 1896 to 1904. He was elected Circuit Court Clerk from 1906 to 1910.

Futrell was elected to the Arkansas Senate and served from 1913 to 1917. He was the Senate President from 1915 to 1917. While President of the Senate, he served as acting governor for four months in 1913 after Governor Joseph Taylor Robinson resigned.

Futrell was admitted to the bar in Arkansas in 1913 and practiced law in Paragould until his 1922 appointment to the Second Division of the Second Circuit Court. In 1923, he moved to the Twelfth Chancery Circuit.

Futrell was elected to a full term as governor in his own right in the 1932 election and reelected in 1934. In the 1932 general election, Futrell defeated the Republican J. O. Livesay, a lawyer from Foreman, who had also been the gubernatorial nominee against Harvey Parnell in 1930. Livesay finished the race with 8.9 percent of the vote, less than half his percent polled in 1930.

As governor, he opposed state funding for education beyond the eighth grade, believing the federal government should provide such support.

The Futrell administration established the Arkansas State Planning Board and created the Arkansas Department of Public Welfare. His administration also rescinded prohibition and instituted some legalized gambling.

After leaving office, Futrell returned to the practice of law.

==Death==
Futrell died in 1955 in Little Rock and is interred at Linwood Cemetery in Paragould. He had suffered a severe stroke on July 4, 1948. Survivors included two sons and four daughters.

<doc id="301758" wikidata="Q214851" url="?curid=301758" title="Charles Richet">
<text>Charles Robert Richet (; 25 August 1850 – 4 December 1935) was a French physiologist at the Collège de France and immunology pioneer. In 1913, he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;in recognition of his work on anaphylaxis&quot;. Richet devoted many years to the study of paranormal and spiritualist phenomena, coining the term &quot;ectoplasm&quot;. He believed in the inferiority of black people, was a proponent of eugenics, and presided over the French Eugenics Society towards the end of his life. The Richet line of professorships of medical science continued through his son Charles and his grandson Gabriel. Gabriel Richet was also one of the pioneers of European nephrology.

==Career==

He was born on 25 August 1850 in Paris the son of Alfred Richet. He was educated at the Lycee Bonaparte in Paris then studied medicine at university in Paris.

Richet spent a period of time as an intern at the Salpêtrière hospital in Paris, where he observed Jean-Martin Charcot&#x27;s work with then so called &quot;hysterical&quot; patients.

In 1887, Richet became professor of physiology at the Collège de France investigating a variety of subjects such as neurochemistry, digestion, thermoregulation in homeothermic animals, and breathing. In 1898, he became a member of the Académie de Médecine. In 1914, he became a member of the Académie des Sciences.

Richet discovered the analgesic drug chloralose with Maurice Hanriot.

Richet had many interests, and he wrote books about history, sociology, philosophy, psychology, as well as theatre and poetry. He was a pioneer in aviation.

He was involved in the French pacifist movement. Starting in 1902, pacifist societies began to meet at a National Peace Congress, often with several hundred attendees. Unable to unify the pacifist forces they set up a small permanent delegation of French Pacifist Societies in 1902, which Richet led, together with Lucien Le Foyer as secretary-general.

== Discovery of anaphylaxis ==
Richet, working with Paul Portier, discovered the phenomenon of anaphylaxis. In 1901, they joined Albert I, Prince of Monaco on a scientific expedition around the French coast of Atlantic Ocean. On board Albert&#x27;s ship, &quot;Princesse Alice II&quot;, they extracted a toxin (which they called a hypnotoxin) that is produced by cnidarians such as Portuguese man o&#x27; war and sea anemone (&quot;Actinia sulcata&quot;).

In their first experiment on the ship, they injected a dog with the toxin, expecting the dog to develop immunity (tolerance) to the toxin, but instead it suffered a severe immune reaction (hypersensitivity). In 1902, they repeated the injections in their laboratory and found that dogs normally tolerated the toxin at first injection, but when given subsequent injections three weeks later, they always developed fatal shock, regardless of the dose of the toxin they were given. Thus, they discovered that the first dose, instead of inducing tolerance (prophylaxis) as they had expected, caused further doses to be deadly.

In 1902, Richet coined the term &quot;aphylaxis&quot; to describe the phenomenon; he later changed it to &quot;anaphylaxis&quot; because he thought it was more euphonious. The term is from the Greek ἀνά-, &quot;ana-&quot;, meaning &quot;against&quot;, and φύλαξις, &quot;phylaxis&quot;, meaning &quot;protection&quot;. On 15 February 1902, Richet and Portier jointly presented their experiments to the Societé de Biologie in Paris. Their research is regarded as the beginning of the scientific study of allergy (the word was coined by Clemens von Pirquet in 1906). It helped explain hay fever and other allergic reactions to foreign substances, asthma, certain reactions to intoxication, and certain cases of sudden cardiac death. Richet continued to study the phenomenon of anaphylaxis, and in 1913 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work.

==Parapsychology==
Richet was deeply interested in the idea of extrasensory perception, and in hypnosis. In 1884, Alexandr Aksakov interested him in the medium of Eusapia Palladino. In 1891, Richet founded the &quot;Annales des sciences psychiques&quot;. He kept in touch with renowned occultists and spiritualists of his time such as Albert von Schrenck-Notzing, Frederic William Henry Myers and Gabriel Delanne. In 1919, Richet became honorary chairman of the Institut Métapsychique International in Paris, and, in 1930, its full-time president.

Richet hoped to find a physical mechanism that would scientifically validate the existence of paranormal phenomena. He wrote: &quot;It has been shown that as regards subjective metapsychics the simplest and most rational explanation is to suppose the existence of a faculty of supernormal cognition ... setting in motion the human intelligence by certain vibrations that do not move the normal senses.&quot; In 1905, Richet was named president of the Society for Psychical Research in the United Kingdom.

In 1894, Richet coined the term ectoplasm. Richet believed that some apparent mediumship could be explained physically as due to the external projection of a material substance (ectoplasm) from the body of the medium, but he didn&#x27;t believe that this proposed substance had anything to do with spirits. He rejected the spirit hypothesis of mediumship as unscientific, instead supporting the sixth-sense hypothesis. According to Richet:

It seems to me prudent not to give credence to the spiritistic hypothesis... it appears to me still (at the present time, at all events) improbable, for it contradicts (at least apparently) the most precise and definite data of physiology, whereas the hypothesis of the sixth sense is a new physiological notion which contradicts nothing that we learn from physiology. Consequently, although in certain rare cases spiritism supplies an apparently simpler explanation, I cannot bring myself to accept it. When we have fathomed the history of these unknown vibrations emanating from reality – past reality, present reality, and even future reality – we shall doubtless have given them an unwonted degree of importance. The history of the Hertzian waves shows us the ubiquity of these vibrations in the external world, imperceptible to our senses.

He hypothesized a &quot;sixth sense&quot;, an ability to perceive hypothetical vibrations, and he discussed this idea in his 1928 book &quot;Our Sixth Sense&quot;. Although he believed in extrasensory perception, Richet did not believe in life after death or spirits.

He investigated and studied various mediums, such as Eva Carrière, William Eglinton, Pascal Forthuny, Stefan Ossowiecki, Leonora Piper and Raphael Schermann. From 1905 to 1910, Richet attended many séances led by the medium Linda Gazzera, claiming that she was a genuine medium who had performed psychokinesis, meaning that various objects had been moved in the séance room purely through the force of the mind. Gazzera was exposed as a fraud in 1911. Richet was also fooled into believing that Joaquin María Argamasilla, known as the &quot;Spaniard with X-ray Eyes&quot;, had genuine psychic powers. whom Harry Houdini exposed Argamasilla as a fraud in 1924. According to Joseph McCabe, Richet was also duped by the fraudulent mediums Eva Carrière and Eusapia Palladino.

The historian Ruth Brandon criticized Richet as credulous when it came to psychical research, pointing to &quot;his will to believe, and his disinclination to accept any unpalatably contrary indications&quot;.

==Eugenics and racial beliefs==
Richet was a proponent of eugenics, advocating sterilization and marriage prohibition for those with mental disabilities. He expressed his eugenist ideas in his 1919 book &quot;La Sélection Humaine&quot;. From 1920 to 1926 he presided over the French Eugenics Society.

Psychologist Gustav Jahoda has noted that Richet &quot;was a firm believer in the inferiority of blacks&quot;, comparing black people to apes, and intellectually to imbeciles.

==Works==

Richet&#x27;s works on parapsychological subjects, which dominated his later years, include &quot;Traité de Métapsychique&quot; (Treatise on Metapsychics, 1922), &quot;Notre Sixième Sens&quot; (Our Sixth Sense, 1928), &quot;L&#x27;Avenir et la Prémonition&quot; (The Future and Premonition, 1931) and &quot;La Grande Espérance&quot; (The Great Hope, 1933).

<text>Jigglypuff ( ), known in Japan as , is a Pokémon species. Jigglypuff first appeared in the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Jigglypuff is voiced by Rachael Lillis in English and by Mika Kanai in Japanese. In the live-action musical &quot;Pokémon Live!&quot;, Jigglypuff is portrayed by Leah Smith. Jigglypuff is also known for singing a lullaby in the Pokémon anime series.

Known as the Balloon Pokémon, Jigglypuff evolves from Igglybuff when it reaches a certain point of happiness, and evolves into Wigglytuff when exposed to a Moon Stone. Its English name is a combination of the words &quot;jiggly&quot; and &quot;puff&quot;, relating to its jelly-like appearance. The character has been featured in a recurring role in the anime series and served as the focus for several printed adaptions of the franchise. Since it appeared in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, Jigglypuff has received generally positive reception. It has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figurines, plush toys, and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;. It also has appeared as a playable character in every entry of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

==Design and characteristics==
Jigglypuff is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Jigglypuff was one of one hundred and fifty one different generation I Pokémon designs conceived by Game Freak&#x27;s character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first-generation of &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; games &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, which were localized outside Japan as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. Its Japanese name &quot;Purin&quot;, derives from the Japanese loanword for custard or pudding. Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species &quot;clever and descriptive names&quot; related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. According to director Junichi Masuda, there were initially concerns that Jigglypuff&#x27;s cuter design would not take off with western audiences, and considerations to redesign it were made, but ultimately scrapped. Deciding to use a name better suited for its jelly-like appearance, the species was renamed &quot;Jigglypuff.&quot; When a Jigglypuff is exposed to a Moon Stone, it evolves into Wigglytuff. It has a pre-evolution, Igglybuff, which evolves when it reaches a certain point of happiness. In English, Jigglypuff has been portrayed by Rachael Lillis and Michele Knotz, and it has been portrayed by Mika Kanai in Japanese. In the stage musical Pokémon Live!, Jigglypuff was portrayed by Leah Smith. 

Known as the Balloon Pokémon, Jigglypuff can inflate its body like a balloon or flatten it. Jigglypuff are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes and, if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. Game Freak&#x27;s staff have noted Jigglypuff as both one of their and the public&#x27;s favorite Pokémon, in terms of both anime and video game appearances, and it was one of the more heavily pushed and marketed Pokémon prior to Pikachu being the determined mascot for the series. During development of the film &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;, Jigglypuff&#x27;s design initially started as very fluffy, but was rejected, with The Pokémon Company stating it should look more like pigskin. This design did not look as appealing, and thus more fur was added to the design. The design was made to resemble &quot;fur groomed into a ball&quot; instead of a more balloon-like design.

==Appearances==
===In video games===

Jigglypuff first appears in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. In &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, a pre-evolution, Igglybuff, was introduced. It later appeared in several sequels, including &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot;. Jigglypuff was a &quot;Normal&quot; type in the series, but since &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, Jigglypuff&#x27;s typing was changed, now gaining an additional &quot;Fairy&quot; type. A Paradox Pokémon heavily resembling Jigglypuff, named Scream Tail, appears in &quot;Pokémon Scarlet&quot; and &quot;Violet&quot;.

Outside of the main series, Jigglypuff has appeared in &quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Conquest&quot;, the &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot; games, &quot;Pokémon GO&quot;, &quot;Pokémon UNITE&quot;, the &quot;Pokémon Ranger&quot; games, and the &quot;Pokémon Rumble&quot; games. Jigglypuff is a playable character in all five &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; games. It is one of the two original representatives of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series along with Pikachu. Despite not being a lead character in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, game director Masahiro Sakurai selected it to appear in Super Smash Bros. due to its similarities to Kirby, which allowed the staff to reuse the model and many animations as a base for Jigglypuff. Jigglypuff&#x27;s moves in its &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; appearances are Sing, Rollout, Pound, and Rest. Rest&#x27;s mechanics are changed entirely; instead of recovering Jigglypuff&#x27;s health like in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, the move is a brutally strong move that launches opponents. However, if it misses, it can leave Jigglypuff open to attack.

===In anime===
In the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series, Jigglypuff is a recurring character who aspires to be a great singer after the inspiration of Ash and company. Unfortunately, most potential audiences fall asleep before the song finishes. Jigglypuff&#x27;s singing can often prove problematic to the series&#x27; protagonists, as it causes all who can hear it to fall asleep. It carries around a trademark marker, which it uses as a microphone due to its resemblance to such when it is capped. When it realizes those who have been subject to its song have fallen asleep, it angrily uses the marker to draw on their faces. 

This Jigglypuff&#x27;s appearances began to decline, eventually making one last appearance in &quot;Pokémon: Advanced&quot;. It remained absent from the series until &quot;Pokémon the Series: Sun and Moon&quot;, where it once again became a recurring character.

In 2006, Viz released ten DVDs based around individual Pokémon in celebration of &quot;Pokémon&quot;&#x27;s tenth anniversary in the United States. The Pokémon featured were determined by an online poll on pokemon.com. Out of forty-five choices, Jigglypuff&#x27;s received second place and was released as volume two, with Pikachu&#x27;s being the first volume. Another compilation of Pokémon anime episodes, including &quot;The Song of Jigglypuff&quot; in which Jigglypuff is introduced, is available on both VHS and DVD, entitled &quot;Jigglypuff Pop&quot;, which was released by Viz Video (now Viz Media) and 4Kids Entertainment. 

=== In printed adaptations ===
Jigglypuff appears in various Pokémon manga adaptations. The &quot;Magical Pokémon Journey&quot; manga series has a female Jigglypuff as one of the main characters, parodying Hello Kitty. The Jigglypuff in &quot;Magical Pokémon Journey&quot; is spoiled and rich, living in a mansion with Wigglytuff and Squirtle, the former being her sister and the latter her butler. &quot;Jigglypuff&#x27;s Magic Lullaby&quot; is part of the &quot;Pokémon Tales&quot; series for very young children. Written by Megumi Hayashibara and illustrated by Kagemaru Himeno, it tells the story of a Jigglypuff who wants to make the other Pokémon happy by singing for them. Yet, as usual, her song puts them to sleep, and this makes her very sad until her friend helps her resolve the situation.

In the &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot; manga, one of the main characters, Green, has a Jigglypuff which is capable of swelling up to several times its size. This allows Green to float with it like a hot-air balloon as well as block narrow passageways—a tactic instrumental in helping Silver and her escape the Masked Man. It evolved in &quot;Breaking the Restraint&quot; into a Wigglytuff alongside two of Green&#x27;s other Pokémon with the power of her Moon Stones.

===In other media===
Jigglypuff made a cameo appearance in a season six episode of &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot;, in which the host accidentally kills one while playing &quot;Pokémon GO&quot;. Jigglypuff is one of the Pokémon that appear in the &quot;Pokémon: Detective Pikachu&quot; film, voiced using archived recordings of Rachael Lillis from the anime. The character briefly appears at a coffee bar after it accidentally put its trainer to sleep with its song.

==Promotion and reception==

Jigglypuff is often featured on products and in promotion for the series. An example of this is the full-sized Pokémon 747 aircraft by Boeing. Jigglypuff appeared on the starboard nose of the original white 1998 aircraft and above the starboard wing of the 1999 blue aircraft. Jigglypuff was also on the nose of the international version of the plane. Jigglypuff has been made into several different toy and plush forms, as well as other items. A Jigglypuff Bluetooth speaker was made by &quot;GameStop&quot;’s ThinkGeek brand, and has been approved by the Federal Communications Commission. A variety merchandise of Jigglypuff has been also made such as clothing, plushies, and jewelry.

Jigglypuff has proven to be a popular character since its introduction. Jigglypuff has been noted as one of the series&#x27; most popular characters and one of Nintendo&#x27;s mascots. The book &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon&quot;&#x27; described Jigglypuff as popular with a young, female audience across the franchise as a whole, attributing said popularity to both the immediate attraction of children to its pink color and its contrast to Pokémon species more popular with young males, such as Squirtle or Charmander. Author Harry Schlesinger also noted that Jigglypuff was popular among girls. The journal &quot;Sex Roles&quot; noted that while Jigglypuff&#x27;s gender in the anime was never explicitly stated, it was identified by a majority of people as a female character in the series. Additionally, it was the most often named &quot;female&quot; Pokémon by children when asked to recall one, which the study attributed to its pink color and ability to sing its opponents to sleep. The &quot;Australian Journal of Language and Literacy&quot; cited Jigglypuff as a tool to use for introducing children to drama, citing its mannerisms in the anime. 

Andrew Tei of Mania.com complained that Jigglypuff&#x27;s portrayal in the anime quickly becomes irritating. Carolyn Gudmundson of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; disagreed, calling Jigglypuff&#x27;s anime appearances &quot;totally badass&quot; while also criticizing its unoriginal, overused design. She later described it as falling into the &quot;huggable pink blob&quot; archetype Pokémon, which she believed to be one of the more overused Pokémon designs. James Whitbrook of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; praised its appearance in the original games, highlighting its uncommon encounter rate and unique design as making it standout in comparison to other wild Pokémon. He also noted its high popularity, especially in marketing, labelling it as &quot;ascendant&quot; in comparison to other Pokémon in the series due to its notability. Steven Bogos of &quot;The Escapist&quot; similarly described Jigglypuff as &quot;iconic&quot; but criticized its lack of power. 

Jigglypuff&#x27;s floaty and campy playstyle in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series has led to some controversy. During a 2019 tournament of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, a player decided to quit due to an opponent who played Jigglypuff repeatedly stalling. Largely credited with elevating the Melee community&#x27;s perception of Jigglypuff&#x27;s viability in competition and setting the standard of how to play the character, a notable professional &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; Player Hungrybox relies heavily on a defensive, counterattack-centric playstyle revolving around avoiding his opponent until he finds an opportunity to attack and capitalize on their mistakes; it is considered a &quot;high risk high reward&quot; playstyle, as Hungrybox&#x27;s usual goal is to eventually hit his opponent with Rest, a move unique to Jigglypuff which inflicts instant high knockback on opponents, but leaves Jigglypuff open to attack. In response to the controversy, the tournament Super Smash Con made some rules against “ledge-camping”, as the character is so effective with the tactic that some people considered it &quot;game-breaking&quot; and making the game not fun to watch.

In 2018, Jigglypuff&#x27;s singing habits became an Internet meme, and a Twitter account known as @jigglysinging was created to overlay popular songs over a clip of Jigglypuff singing. A Las Vegas street was also named after Jigglypuff.

<text>Robinia pseudoacacia, commonly known in its native territory as black locust, is a medium-sized hardwood deciduous tree, belonging to the tribe Robinieae of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to a few small areas of the United States, but it has been widely planted and naturalized elsewhere in temperate North America, Europe, Southern Africa and Asia and is considered an invasive species in some areas, such as the temperate east coast of Australia where the cultivar &quot;Frisia&quot; (Golden Robinia) was widely planted as a street tree before being classed as a weed. Another common name is false acacia, a literal translation of the specific name (&quot;pseudo&quot; [Greek &quot;ψευδο-&quot;] meaning fake or false and &quot;acacia&quot; referring to the genus of plants with the same name).

== Description ==
The roots of black locust contain nodules that allow it to fix nitrogen, as is common within the pea family. Trees reach a typical height of with a diameter of . It is a very upright tree with a straight trunk and narrow crown that grows scraggly with age. The bark is a reddish black and gray and tinged with red or orange in the grooves; it is deeply furrowed into grooves and ridges which run up and down the trunk and often cross and form diamond shapes. The branches are typically zig-zaggy and may have ridges and grooves or may be round. When young, the branches are at first coated with white silvery down; this soon disappears, and they become pale green and afterward reddish or greenish brown.

The dark blue-green leaves are lighter on the underside, and are compound, meaning that each leaf contains many smaller leaflike structures called leaflets, which are roughly paired on either side of the stem that runs through the leaf (rachis). There is typically one leaflet at the tip of the leaf (odd pinnate), and the leaves are alternately arranged on the stem. Each leaf is long and contains 9–19 leaflets, each being long, and wide. The leaflets are rounded or slightly indented at the tip and typically rounded at the base. The leaves come out of the bud folded in half, yellow green, covered with silvery down which soon disappears. Each leaflet initially has a minute stipel, which quickly falls, and is connected to the (rachis) by a short stem or petiolule. The leaves are attached to the branch with slender hairy petioles which are grooved and swollen at the base. The stipules are linear, downy, membranous at first and occasionally develop into prickles. The leaves appear relatively late in spring, and turn a clear pale yellow in autumn. The leaflets fold together in wet weather and at night (nyctinasty), as some change of position at night is a habit of the entire leguminous family.

Young trees are often spiny, especially on root suckers and branches near the ground; mature trees often lack spines. &quot;R. pseudoacacia&quot; is quite variable in the number of spines present, as some trees are densely prickly and other trees have no prickles at all. The spines typically remain on the tree until the young thin bark to which they are attached is replaced by the thicker mature bark. They develop from stipules (small leaf-like structures that grow at the base of leaves), and since stipules are paired at the base of leaves, the spines will be paired at the bases of leaves. They range from in length and are somewhat triangular with a flared base and sharp point. Their color is of a dark purple and they adhere only to the bark.

The winter buds are minute, naked (having no scales covering them), three or four together, protected in a depression by a scale-like covering lined on the inner surface with a thick coat of tomentum and opening in early spring. When the buds are forming they are covered by the swollen base of the petiole. The large flowers open in May or June for 7–10 days, after the leaves have developed. They are arranged in loose drooping clumps (racemes) which are typically long. The flowers themselves are cream-white (rarely pink or purple) with a pale yellow blotch in the center and imperfectly papilionaceous in shape. They are about wide, very fragrant, and produce large amounts of nectar. Each flower is perfect, having both stamens and a pistil (male and female parts). There are 10 stamens enclosed within the petals; these are fused together in a diadelphous configuration, where the filaments of 9 are all joined to form a tube and one stamen is separate and above the joined stamens. The single ovary is superior and contains several ovules. Below each flower is a calyx which looks like leafy tube between the flower and the stem. It is made from fused sepals and is dark green and may be blotched with red. The pedicels (stems which connect the flower to the branch) are slender, , dark red or reddish green.

The fruit is a typical legume fruit, being a flat and smooth pea-like pod long and broad. The fruit usually contains 4–8 seeds. The seeds are dark orange brown with irregular markings. They ripen late in autumn and hang on the branches until early spring. There are typically 25,500 seeds per pound. Cotyledons are oval in shape and fleshy.

=== Reproduction and dispersal ===
Black locust reproduces both sexually via flowers, and asexually via root suckers. The flowers are pollinated by insects, primarily by Hymenopteran insects. The physical construction of the flower separates the male and female parts so that self-pollination will not typically occur. The seedlings grow rapidly but they have a thick seed coat which means that not all seeds will germinate. The seed coat can be weakened via hot water, sulfuric acid, or be mechanically scarified, which will allow a greater quantity of the seeds to grow. The seeds are produced in good crops every year or every other year.

Root suckers are an important method of local reproduction of this tree. The roots may grow suckers after damage (by being hit with a lawn mower or otherwise damaged) or after no damage at all. The suckers are stems which grow from the roots, directly into the air and may grow into full trees. The main trunk also has the capability to grow sprouts and will do so after being cut down. This makes removal of black locust difficult as the suckers need to be continually removed from both the trunk and roots or the tree will regrow. This is considered an asexual form of reproduction.

The suckers allow black locust to grow into colonies which often exclude other species. These colonies may form dense thickets which shade out competition.
Black locust has been found to have either 2n=20 or 2n=22 chromosomes.

=== Flavonoid content ===
Black locust leaves contain flavone glycosides characterised by spectroscopic and chemical methods as the 7-&quot;O&quot;-β-ᴅ-glucuronopyranosyl-(1→2)[α-ʟ-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)]-β-ᴅ-glucopyranosides of acacetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavone), apigenin (5,7,4′-trihydroxyflavone), diosmetin (5,7,3′-trihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavone) and luteolin (5,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxyflavone).

=== Similar species ===
Although similar in general appearance to the honey locust, the black locust lacks that tree&#x27;s characteristic long branched thorns on the trunk, having instead pairs of short prickles at the base of each leaf; the leaflets are also much broader than honey locust. It may resemble &quot;Styphnolobium japonicum&quot;, which has smaller flower spikes and lacks spines.

== Taxonomy ==
The black locust is a plant from the subfamily of Faboideae in the family of legumes (Fabaceae) and is a relative of the pea and bean.

The black locust is commonly referred to as &quot;false acacia&quot; after its species name &quot;pseudoacacia&quot;, although it is not particularly closely related to the acacia, which belongs to the mimosa subfamily (Mimosoideae). Both species are similar in the form of their feathered leaves and thorns, but the flower shapes are very different. Confusion between species of both genera is almost impossible in higher latitudes, since acacias are native to subtropical and tropical areas and do not thrive in the cooler climates favoured by the black locust.

=== History and naming ===
The tree was identified in 1607 at Jamestown by British colonists, who used the timber to build houses. The tree was named for its resemblance to &quot;Ceratonia siliqua&quot;, known as the &quot;Old World Locust&quot;. Jesuit missionaries apparently fancied that this was the tree that supported St. John in the wilderness, despite its being native to North America.

It was introduced into Britain in 1636.

&quot;Robinia&quot; is a native North American genus, but traces of it are found in the Eocene and Miocene rocks of Europe.

The genus is named after the royal French gardeners Jean Robin and his son , who brought the plant to Europe in 1601, in what may be regarded as a reintroduction. A black locust planted by Jean Robin in 1601 still grows in the Square René Viviani in Paris, and is believed to be the oldest living tree in that city. Another was planted in 1636 by Vespasien Robin at the Jardin des plantes and can still be viewed today.

== Distribution ==
The black locust is native to the eastern United States, but the exact native range is not accurately known as the tree has been cultivated and is currently found across the continent, in all the lower 48 states, eastern Canada, and British Columbia. The native range is thought to be two separate populations, one centered about the Appalachian Mountains, from Pennsylvania to northern Georgia, and a second westward focused around the Ozark Plateau and Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas, Oklahoma and Missouri.

Black locust&#x27;s current range has been expanded by humans distributing the tree for landscaping and now includes Pakistan, India, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Northern and South Africa, temperate regions in Asia, New Zealand, Southern South America.

== Ecology ==

Black locust is a shade-intolerant species and therefore is typical of young woodlands and disturbed areas where sunlight is plentiful and the soil is dry. In this sense, black locust can be considered a weed tree. It also spreads by underground shoots or suckers, which contributes to the weedy character of this species.

When growing in sandy areas this plant can enrich the soil by means of its nitrogen-fixing nodules, allowing other species to move in. On sandy soils black locust may replace other vegetation which cannot fix nitrogen.

Black locust is a typical early successional plant, a pioneer species. It grows best in bright sunlight and does not handle shade well. It specializes in colonizing disturbed areas and edges of woodlots before it is eventually replaced with taller or more shade-tolerant species. It prefers dry to moist limestone soils but will grow on most soils as long as they are not wet or poorly drained. This tree tolerates a soil pH range of 4.6 to 8.2. Within its native range it will grow on soils of Inceptisols, Ultisols, and Alfisols groups, but does not do well on compacted, clayey or eroded soils. Black locust is a part of the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests.

Black locust is host to up to 67 species of lepidoptera, and provides valuable cover when planted on previously open areas. Its seeds are eaten by bobwhite quail and other game birds and squirrels. Woodpeckers may nest in the trunk since older trees are often infected by heart rot. The deeply grooved bark also makes it a preferred species for some bat roosts.

=== Pests ===
Locust leaf miner &quot;Odontota dorsalis&quot; attacks the tree in spring and turns the leaves brown by mid summer, slowing the growth of the tree though not seriously. Locust borer &quot;Megacyllene robiniae&quot; larvae carve tunnels into the trunk of the tree and make it more prone to being knocked down by the wind. Heart rot is the only significant disease affecting black locust. Black locust is also attacked by &quot;Chlorogenus robiniae&quot;, a virus which causes witch&#x27;s broom growths; clear leaflet veins are a symptom of the disease. The black locust is among the preferred reproductive hosts of the polyphagous shot-hole borer (PSHB, &quot;Euwallacea fornicatus&quot;). The PSHB will tunnel galleries into the trees, where it cultivates a fusarium fungus as a food source. The tree&#x27;s vascular systems are disrupted; causing dieback.

=== Invasiveness ===
Black locust is considered invasive on its native continent, specifically in the western United States, New England region, northern California, and in the Midwest. In the prairie and savanna regions of the Midwest, black locust can dominate and shade open habitats. These ecosystems have been decreasing in size, and black locust is contributing to this reduction; when black locust invades an area, it will convert the grassland ecosystem into a forested ecosystem where the grasses are displaced. Black locust has been listed as invasive in Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and is prohibited in Massachusetts.

In Australia, black locust has become naturalized within Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia. It is considered an environmental weed there. In South Africa, it is regarded as a weed because of its suckering habit.

== Toxicity ==
The bark, leaves, and wood are toxic to both humans and livestock. Important constituents of the plant are the toxalbumin robin, which loses its toxicity when heated, and robinin, a nontoxic glucoside.

Horses that consume the plant show signs of anorexia, depression, incontinence, colic, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmia. Symptoms usually occur about 1 hour following consumption, and immediate veterinary attention is required.

The sawdust and shavings from &quot;Robinia&quot; lumber can cause contact dermatitis in sensitive persons.

== Cultivation and uses ==

Black locust can be easily propagated from roots, softwood, or hardwood. Cultivars may be grafted, ensuring that parent and daughter plants will be genetically identical.

In Europe, it is often planted along streets and in parks, especially in large cities, because it tolerates pollution well.

=== Cultivars ===
Several cultivars exist, &#x27;Frisia&#x27; being one of the most planted ones.
* &#x27;Decaisneana&#x27; has been considered a cultivar but is more accurately a hybrid (&quot;R. pseudoacacia&quot; x &quot;R. viscosa&quot;). It has light rose-pink colored flowers and small or no prickles.
* ‘Frisia’, a selection with bright yellow-green leaves and red prickles, is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree.
* &#x27;Purple robe&#x27; has dark rose-pink flowers and bronze red new growth. The flowers tend to last longer than on the wild tree.
* &#x27;Tortuosa&#x27;, a small tree with curved and distorted branches.
* &#x27;Unifoliola&#x27;, a plant with fewer leaflets, no prickles, and a shorter height.
Black locust has been spread and used as a plant for erosion control as it is fast growing and generally a tough tree. The wood, considered the most durable wood in North America, has been very desirable and motivated people to move the tree to areas where it is not native so the wood can be farmed and used.

=== Food and medicine ===
==== Honey ====
Black locust is a major honey plant in the eastern US, and has been planted in European countries. In many European countries, it is the source of the renowned acacia honey. Flowering starts after 140 growing degree days. However, its blooming period is short (about 10 days) and it does not consistently produce a honey crop year after year. Weather conditions can have quite an effect on the amount of nectar collected, as well; in Ohio for example, good locust honey flow happens in one of five years.

==== Other produce ====
In traditional medicine of India, different parts of &quot;R. pseudoacacia&quot; are used as laxative, antispasmodic, and diuretic.

In Liguria, Italy and Romania the flowers are sometimes used to produce a sweet and perfumed jam. This means manual harvesting of flowers, eliminating the seeds and boiling the petals with sugar, in certain proportions, to obtain a light sweet and delicate perfume jam.

Although the bark and leaves are toxic, various reports suggest that the seeds and the young pods of the black locust are edible. Shelled seeds are safe to harvest from summer through fall, and are edible both raw and boiled. Due to the small size of the seeds, shelling them efficiently can prove tedious and difficult. In France, Italy and Romania, &quot;R. pseudoacacia&quot; flowers are eaten as &quot;beignets&quot; after being coated in batter and fried in oil; they are also eaten in Japan, largely as tempura.

=== Erosion control ===
&quot;R. pseudoacacia&quot; is considered an excellent plant for growing in disturbed areas as an erosion control plant. Black locust&#x27;s shallow, aggressive roots help hold onto the soil, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria on its root system allow it to grow on poor soils, making it an early colonizer of disturbed areas. Obviating the mass application of fertilizers, black locust and other nitrogen-fixing tree and shrub species have gained importance in managed forestry.

=== Firewood ===

Black locust is planted for firewood, as it grows rapidly, is highly resilient in a variety of soils, and it grows back rapidly after harvest from the existing root system (i.e. coppicing).

Black locust is highly valued as firewood for wood-burning stoves; it burns slowly, with little visible flame or smoke, and has a higher heat content than any other species that grows widely in the eastern United States, comparable to the heat content of anthracite. For best results, it should be seasoned like any other hardwood, but black locust is also popular because of its ability to burn even when wet. In fireplaces, it can be less satisfactory because knots and beetle damage make the wood prone to &quot;spitting&quot; coals for distances of up to several feet. If the black locust is cut, split, and cured while relatively young (within 10 years), thus minimizing beetle damage, &quot;spitting&quot; problems are minimal.

=== Construction ===
This native hardwood is also prized by North American shipwrights for making rot-resistant trunnels in traditional wooden ship construction.

The wood is extremely hard, being one of the hardest woods in Northern America with a Janka hardness test of 1,700 lbf (7,560 N) and specific gravity of 0.733 (733 kilograms per cubic metre or 45.7 pounds per cubic foot). It is very resistant to rot, and durable, making it prized for furniture, flooring, paneling, fence posts, and small watercraft. Black Locust is a highly durable organic wood product that does not require chemical treatment to preserve its beauty for 50 years or longer. Wet, newly cut planks have an offensive odor which disappears with seasoning. Black locust is still in use in some rustic handrail systems. In the Netherlands and some other parts of Europe, black locust is one of the most rot-resistant local trees, and projects have started to limit the use of tropical wood by promoting this tree and creating plantations. Flavonoids in the heartwood allow the wood to last over 100 years in soil.

With a light yellowish color and strength, the wood was much used for decorative inlays and banding in furniture in England and France in the 17th and 18th centuries, under the name &quot;acacia&quot; or &quot;Virginia acacia&quot;. Recently, Robinia has become popular for outdoor furniture and playground equipment.

In 1900, the value of &quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot; was reported to be practically destroyed in nearly all parts of the U.S. beyond the mountain forests which are its home by locust borers which riddle the trunk and branches. Were it not for these insects, it would be one of the most valuable timber trees that could be planted in the northern and middle states. Young trees grow quickly and vigorously for a number of years, but soon become stunted and diseased, and rarely live long enough to attain any commercial value.

== In culture ==
In Asia, many black locusts, called cihuai (:zh:刺槐), yanghuai (foreign huai :zh:洋槐, against native huai :zh:国槐) or simply &quot;acacias&quot;, were planted in Dalian, Liaoning, China, during its Russian and Japanese occupation, and are loved by the local people: there is Acacia Avenue (槐树大道) in downtown; the Acacia Flower Festival (槐花節) is celebrated every year in May; and acacia honey is collected in the suburbs by bee keepers.

<doc id="301768" wikidata="Q7756172" url="?curid=301768" title="The Parliament of Bees">
<text>The Parliament of Bees is the best-known of the works of the Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatist John Day. It was probably written some time between 1608 and 1616, but not published until 1641.

The poem was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 23 March 1641 and printed later in the year by the bookseller William Lee. The quarto is titled &quot;The Parliament of Bees, with their Proper Characters. Or a beehive furnished with twelve honeycombs, as pleasant as profitable. Being an allegorical description of the actions of good and bad men in these our days. By John Day, sometimes student of Caius College in Cambridge&quot;. (Spellings modernized.) The quarto is dedicated to George Butler.

The poem also exists in manuscript, identified as Lansdowne MS. 725. The manuscript&#x27;s title is &quot;An old manuscript containing the Parliament of Bees, found in a hollow tree in a garden in Hibla, in a strange language, and now faithfully translated into easy English verse by John Day, Cantabridg&quot;. (Spellings modernized.) The manuscript is prefaced with Epistles to The Reader and to William Augustine. The printed text and the manuscript show significant differences.

Some of the twelve characters had been published prior to 1641. Two, nos. 4 and 5, were printed in a volume titled &quot;The Noble Soldier&quot; (1634), attributed to &quot;S. R.&quot;. Five others, nos. 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9, appeared under different names in &quot;The Wonder of a Kingdom&quot; (1636), attributed to Thomas Dekker.

&quot;The Parliament of Bees&quot; is a series of dialogues on the subject of &quot;the doings, the births, the wars, the wooings&quot; of bees. The bees hold a parliament under Prorex, the Master Bee, and various complaints are preferred against the humble-bee, the wasp, the drone and other offenders. This satirical allegory of affairs ends with a Royal Progress by Oberon, who distributes justice to all.

<text>Mustafa Hamsho (; born 10 October 1953) is a Syrian former professional boxer who competed from 1975 to 1989, challenging twice for the undisputed middleweight world title in 1981 and 1984.

==Professional career==
The Syrian Slugger racked up a winning record in the late 1970s, and defeated Wilford Scypion on June 15, 1980 and former world middleweight champion Alan Minter on June 6, 1981 to get a shot at then-champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler in October of that year. As Hamsho waded into the champion’s punches seeking an opening, Hagler methodically used right jabs and right hooks to cut his face (which needed 55 stitches). The fight was stopped in the 11th by Hamsho&#x27;s corner after a Hagler barrage. Sports Illustrated commended Hamsho, calling him courageous for his effort.

Hamsho continued to fight, defeating Curtis Parker, future world champion Bobby Czyz, and former three-division world champion Wilfred Benítez during 1982 and 1983, then received a return visit to take on Hagler in a rematch in October 1984 in Madison Square Garden. After Hamsho tried to play rough in the early going, Hagler ended things early this time by flooring Hamsho twice in the third round (the second knockdown produced by a Floyd Patterson-like hook), thus forcing Hamsho&#x27;s trainer to jump in and stop the fight. Hamsho would continue to fight, with the biggest name on his list being Donny Lalonde, who decisioned Hamsho in the spring of 1987 and would then go on to become light heavyweight champion later that year. Hamsho&#x27;s career would then peter out over the next few years.
