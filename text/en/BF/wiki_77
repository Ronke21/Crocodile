<text>The Trans Canada Trail is a cross-Canada system of greenways, waterways, and roadways that stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific to the Arctic oceans. The trail extends over ; it is now the longest recreational, multi-use trail network in the world. The idea for the trail began in 1992, shortly after the Canada 125 celebrations. Since then it has been supported by donations from individuals, corporations, foundations, and all levels of government.

Trans Canada Trail (TCT) is the name of the non-profit group that raises funds for the continued development of the trail. However, the trail is owned and operated at the local level.

On August 26, 2017, TCT celebrated the connection of the trail with numerous events held throughout Canada. TCT has said it now plans to make the trail more accessible, replace interim roadways with off-road greenways, add new spurs and loops to the trail, and fund emergency repairs when needed.

Between September 2016 and June 2021, the TCT was known as the Great Trail. In 2021, the name was changed back to the Trans Canada Trail. 

==Origin of trail idea==
The creation of the trail was born of Canada&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebrations in 1992. It has its counterparts in such other greenway routes as the 12 EuroVelo routes, the UK&#x27;s National Cycle Network, and the United States Numbered Bicycle Routes network.

==Funding==
The Trans Canada Trail has been funded largely by Canadian federal and provincial governments, with significant contributions from corporate and individual donors. The first province to have completed its designated section of the trail was Prince Edward Island (see Confederation Trail).

==Development and maintenance==
The network of the Trans Canada Trail is made up of more than 400 community trails. Each trail section is developed, owned, and managed locally by trail groups, conservation authorities, and by municipal, provincial, territorial, and federal governments, for instance in parks such as Gatineau Park or along existing trails such as the Cataraqui Trail and Voyageur Hiking Trail. The Trans Canada Trail supports the construction and use of greenways to replace roadways.

Moreover, considerable parts of the trail are repurposed defunct rail lines donated to provincial governments by Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railway railbeds rebuilt as walking trails. As such, much of the Trans Canada Trail development emulated the successful Rails-to-Trails initiative in the United States, whereby these transportation corridors are &quot;rail banked&quot; as recreational trails, allowing conversion back to rail should future need arise.

Thousands of Canadians, community partner organizations, corporations, local businesses, and all levels of government are involved in developing and maintaining these trails. TCT does not own or operate any section of the trail. As an ensemble, the Trans Canada Trail might be one of the largest volunteer projects ever undertaken in Canada.

==Routes and amenities==
The main section runs along the southern areas of Canada, connecting most of Canada&#x27;s major cities and most populous areas. There is also a long northern arm that runs through Alberta to Edmonton and then up through northern British Columbia to the Yukon.

While the route described above has the TCT going east–west through the southern prairie provinces (via Medicine Hat and Calgary), with a northern branch going off to Edmonton and on to the north, the Trans Canada Trail officially is shown as going from Winnipeg across the northern Prairies, coming into Alberta east of Edmonton, spawning a northern walking trail near Fort Saskatchewan before entering Edmonton, then going south to Calgary and west to BC.

The trail is multi-use and depending on the section may allow hikers, bicyclists, horseback riders, cross country skiers, and snowmobilers. In theory, the trail is equipped with regularly spaced pavilions that provide shelter as well as fresh water to travellers, but this varies widely from section to section, and particularly from province to province.

&quot;Mile zero&quot; of the trail is located outside the Railway Coastal Museum in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

==Future developments==
While the trail is connected, TCT stated that it will continue to fundraise for its future development and enhancement. Among its objectives, TCT says that it plans to replace interim roadways with off-road greenways, where possible, to make it safer and more accessible for all users; to add new trail sections, and to provide emergency funding for trail sections damaged by natural disasters, etc.

The trail is not owned or operated by TCT, but the organization provides support to local partners and volunteer groups who maintain individual sections.

On September 4, 2018, TCT announced that the government of Canada would invest $30 million in trail development in the next four years. The official announcement was made by Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change.

==Controversy==
Edmund A. Aunger, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Alberta, Campus Saint-Jean, is a vocal critic of the trail, particularly in the way it has strayed from the original vision of &quot;a trail built far enough from roads to mask traffic noise and avoid collisions&quot;.

Because only 32 per cent (i.e. ) of the Trans Canada Trail consists of actual off-road trails, the Trans Canada Trail is fundamentally very different from classic pure-hiking trails like the Appalachian Trail. Furthermore, not all of the off-road trails are hiking-only. Also, because many sections are on-road, cycling is more suitable for those stretches. Additionally, since some sections are on waterways, a cross-country trekker cannot rely on any one mode of transportation alone.

Aunger states that &quot;Lacking both uniform standards and control, the Trans Canada Trail includes a confusing and dangerous hodgepodge of mountain-bike paths, roadside ditches, dirt ruts, gravel roads and hazardous ATV trails.&quot;

In 2012, Aunger&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Ann Sovis, was killed while cycling on a portion of the trail in Prince Edward Island.

==Infrastructure and route details by province and territory==

===Newfoundland and Labrador===
As of May 2017, &quot;Kilometre 0&quot; begins at Cape Spear, the most easterly point in North America. Here it is known as the East Coast Trail, a series of rugged coastal wilderness paths. The route follows the coastline north around St. John&#x27;s Bay and Freshwater Bay, connecting with the Grand Concourse walkway network at Fort Amherst. The route then follows a sidewalkway along Southside Road adjacent to St. John&#x27;s Harbour until the former Trail Eastern Terminus located at the Railway Coastal Museum. From here it follows the former Newfoundland Railway route travelling south, crossing Route 2 into Kilbride then through Bowring Park. It continues northwest through Mount Pearl then Donovans crossing Route 1 into Paradise, passing Neils Pond and Octagon Pond. The route then turns southwest in Conception Bay South and crosses Route 60 before it meets and follows the Conception Bay coastline. At Indian Pond, the Grand Concourse trail ends, and the route is known as the Newfoundland T&#x27;Railway, an 883 km linear park that consists of the former railbed and permits motorized access.

The route continues as the Newfoundland T&#x27;Railway southwest, passing through the east side of Holyrood Bay. The trail passes through Briens as it enters Hollyrood. The route again crosses Route 60, then the North Arm River, then travels north through Burnt Stump. The route travels southwest passing Woodsford, then passes through Brien&#x27;s Gullies before then crossing Route 1 again. It then passes through Brigus Junction, Mahers, then Ocean Pond, then a mostly treed area before entering Whitbourne and crossing Route 80. Continuing, the route crosses Route 100, then enters Placentia Junction before turning north, passing over Coles Pond. Crossing Route 120, the next major location is Tickle Harbour Station, where it again touches Route 1 and follows it, crossing a few more times before entering Cobb&#x27;s Pond, then Come By Chance. The route continues as it enters Goobies, then Northern Blight, then crosses Route 1 as it enters Clarenville. It follows Shoal Harbour River as it enters Thorburn Lake, then crosses Route 233 at Port Blandford, then crosses Route 1 again as it enters Terra Nova.

The trail changes to Gambo to Terra Nova Trail as it continues to Alexander Bay, then route 1, then Route 320 as it enters Gambo.

Continuing north, the next leg of the trail is called Cobb Corridor Trail as it enters Butts, then Benton, then it turns northwest as it enters Gander. As it continues, the route passes Glenwood, then continues to Notre Dame Junction, passing Route 340 and finally Norris Arm.

The next section is Newfoundland Trailway Park, continuing to Rattling Brook, as it follows the Exploits River through Junipers Brook, Bishops Falls, crossing Route 350 and continuing through Grand Falls.

Now known as Exploits Valley and Beothuk Trail, the trail moves along into Windsor, then Badger. From here it is known as Newfoundland Trailway Park and travels through West Lake and Millertown Junction. The route then passes through Quarry, Gaff Topsails, Kittys Brook, and Howley, where it crosses the Main Brook and ends in Deer Lake.

The next stretch is called the Deer Lake to Corner Brook Trail and closely follows Route 1 through Pasadena, Steady Brook, and Corner Brook on the south side of the Upper Humber River, ending as it crosses Route 450.

Continuing south, the route is now known as Newfoundland Trailway Park, passing through Mount Moriah, then continuing on Harrys River into Gallants, then crossing Route 460 as it intersects with Route 461 at Stephenville Crossing in St. George&#x27;s Bay. Passing through St. George&#x27;s, the route crosses Fischells Brook, then crosses Route 404 in Cartyville. Passing through St. Fintans, the route continues to Codroy Pond, then South Branch, Benoits Siding, Doyles, Tompkins, St Andrews, and ends in Cape Ray.

The last stretch of the trail in Newfoundland is known as the Wreckhouse Trail. This section passes through Osmond, Grand Bay, and ends in Port aux Basques, where you would take the Port Aux Basques to North Sydney Ferry to North Sydney, Nova Scotia.

===Nova Scotia===
In Nova Scotia, the trail begins where it is known as Pottle Lake to North Sydney, on Cape Breton Island in the town of North Sydney, separating itself from Highway 105 after the ferry ride from Newfoundland. As of June 2014, this portion of the route has not been completed; however, it is planned to travel through the town and cross Highway 125 following Old Branch Road on the North Side of Pottle Lake.

From here, the trail changes to Old Branch Road - George River Division and continues through Georges River and then heads southeast, touching the north east corner of Scotch Lake, then enters the community of Scotch Lake and follows Scotch Lake Road.

The route continues as Upper Leitches Creek to Scotch Lake, briefly merging with Route 223 on the Bras D&#x27;or Lakes Scenic Drive, then follows Upper Leitches Creek Road as it enters Upper Leitches Creek.

At this point it changes to the Scotch Lake – Grand Narrows trail as it continues on Tower Road, then passes the MacAulays Lakes. Here it crosses McLeod Brook as it passes through Bodale Hills. The route changes to Little Narrows as it enters the community of Rear Christmas Island. It again merges onto Highway 223 in Christmas Island and follows the highway through Grand Narrows, Iona, Jamesville, Jamesville West, and Ottawa Brook. As the route passes Bras D&#x27;or Lake, it crosses at Little Narrows, using the Little Narrows Ferry and crossing the Trans-Canada Highway at Highway 105 in Aberdeen, then continuing north through Lewis Mountain, where it becomes the Celtic Shores Coast Trail.

====Celtic Shores Coast Trail====
The Trans Canada Trail continues, passing Route 395 and going through Scotsville to a fork north of Strathlorne in the Municipality of the County of Inverness.

====Halifax, Dartmouth, Cole Harbour, and Eastern Shore area====
The only trail in Halifax is the Halifax Boardwalk. The boardwalk travels from Pier 21 to near Casino Nova Scotia. There are two trails in Dartmouth. The Dartmouth Waterfront Trail starts at Alderney Landing and ends in Woodside. The other trail goes by two names: Dartmouth Multi-use Trail and Shubie Canal Greenway. The trail visits Dartmouth&#x27;s best parks, including Shubie Park. The Trans Canada Trail continues straight on trail from Shearwater to Meaghers Grant. Shearwater Flyer Trail, Forest Hills Trail System, Salt Marsh Trail, Atlantic View Trail, Blueberry Run Trail, Gaetz Brook Greenway and Musquodoboit Trailway are the names of the rest of the area&#x27;s trails. Out of the region, the Trans Canada Trail continues on roads.

The North Trail or North Path travels north and ends in Inverness.

The South Trail passes through Strathlorne, then through Loch Ban, and then Black River, where its name changes to Mabou Rivers Trail. From here it passes through Glendyer, then crosses Route 252 as it passes through Rankinville, then crosses Route 19 in Mabou.

===Prince Edward Island===
Prince Edward Island&#x27;s portion of the Trans Canada Trail is known as the Confederation Trail. The main section runs from Tignish at kilometre 0 to Elmira at kilometre 273. Spurs extend to Charlottetown, Georgetown, Montague, Murray River, Murray Harbour, Souris, Wood Islands, and to the Confederation Bridge in Borden-Carleton, which links the Island with New Brunswick on the Canadian mainland.

===New Brunswick===
Shogomoc River Pedestrian Bridge is a suspension bridge in Lakeland Ridges, New Brunswick. Part of the Trans Canada Trail and the Sentier NB Trail network, it was opened in October 2011 by a ribbon-cutting ceremony with journalist Valerie Pringle present as a TCT representative. Sentier NB Trail provided over $300,000 towards the project. It is known as the final non-motorized trail link between the town of Grand Bay–Westfield and the border of the province of Quebec.

===Quebec===
Much of the trail&#x27;s current route through Quebec follows the &quot;Route Verte&quot; and has many cycling paths. Completed off-road hiking trails can be found in Gatineau Park and along a route linking the Papineau-Labelle Nature Reserve, Mont Tremblant Provincial Park, and the Mastigouche Nature Reserve. These form part of a planned hiking route that would eventually link Ottawa-Gatineau on the Ontario border with the Gaspe Peninsula and the New Brunswick border.

===Ontario===
As a legacy project of the 2015 Pan American Games and the 2015 Parapan American Games, the Pan Am Path helps complete the of gaps in Ontario&#x27;s portion of the Trans Canada Trail. In 2013, a one-kilometre-long honorary segment of the Trans Canada Trail was opened on the grounds of Rideau Hall in Ottawa. The Lake Huron-North Channel Waterfront route reduces use of shoulders along the Trans-Canada Highway by about 50 kilometres.

===Prairie provinces===
The route through Manitoba is a mix of off-road hiking trails, road shoulders, and waterways.

Saskatchewan has managed to avoid major highways and paved roads and uses nothing more than rural gravel roads to link off-road hiking trails. The route through this province has been proclaimed as complete with the opening of the Wakamow Valley Suspension Bridge. However, parts of the land route include some waterways that require a canoe or small boat.

The off-road sections of the trail are very fragmentary in Alberta, where opposition to the trail by special interest groups has been very strong. A major section in Alberta follows highway 2A between Edmonton and Calgary, a road that combines narrow shoulders with heavy traffic. The main role of the Alberta government so far has been to assist local trail associations in searching for better routes. Multi-use trails in the city of Fort Saskatchewan and Sturgeon County are planned to be connected with a new pedestrian bridge spanning the North Saskatchewan River, which was funded as part of a project to completely twin Highway 15 in the region.

East of Edmonton, the TCT from Elk Point to Waskatenau uses the Iron Horse Trail, which lies on the old route of the Oliver–St. Paul rail line once operated by the Canadian Northern Railway (later the Canadian National). The Iron Horse Trail allows use of feet, quads, and horses. At Waskatenau, the trail veers south to the banks of the North Saskatchewan River and winds westward to Fort Saskatchewan.

Just north of Fort Saskatchewan, the TCT forks, with the &quot;Northern walking trail&quot; winding north to Athabasca, across northern Alberta, northern BC, and the Yukon. At Athabasca, the northern walking trail spawns a water trail that takes travellers down the Athabasca River to the Mackenzie and thence to the Arctic Ocean.

===British Columbia===
The main leg of the trail enters British Columbia from Alberta, following the Elk River passing through Sparwood and the Kootenays and Columbia mountains. From there, it delves southward and westward near the Kettle river. The trail passes through the Okanagan Valley over the Kettle Valley Rail Trail, including the very popular Myra Canyon portion. From here, it heads through Princeton. Between Brookmere and the Othello Tunnels, the trail officially follows the route of the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway at Princeton and then onto parts of the Kettle Valley Railway south of Brookmere, but due to lost bridges, washouts, grade degradation, and freeway construction, it actually traces the Coquihalla Highway. The route then sideskirts down the Silverhope logging road and over the steep, overgrown, and isolated Paleface Pass into the Chilliwack Lake basin. Once down to the lake level, pavement resumes. It then continues west on a mixture of dikes and rural roads to Vancouver and West Vancouver, to connect to Horseshoe Bay. The Vancouver-to-Nanaimo section involves a trip on BC Ferries. From Nanaimo, the trail extends southward on various roads until meeting the Cowichan Valley Trail on Vancouver Island. From there, it maintains its own right-of-way (sometimes shared with the Esquimalt &amp; Nanaimo Railway) to Victoria, where another ferry returns to Vancouver.

The Salish Sea Marine Trail is an alternate route to Victoria from Horseshoe Bay, crossing the Strait of Georgia from the Sunshine Coast and the northern Gulf Islands to Nanoose Bay, then travelling south to Victoria via the southern Gulf Islands. Another marine route, the Sea to Sky Marine Trail, connects Horseshoe Bay and Gibsons to Squamish via the Howe Sound. From Squamish it joins the Sea to Sky Trail, which is officially designated as a spur of the Trans Canada Trail to Whistler and Pemberton.

===Northwest Territories===
The Northwest Territories is where the Trans Canada Trail meets the Arctic Ocean. The land-based trail comes through the Yukon up the Dempster Highway and into the N.W.T., where it continues north through the Mackenzie Delta to Tuktoyaktuk, the most northern point on the Trans Canada Trail. There is also a significant portion of the water-based trail in the N.W.T. that comes from Alberta via the Slave River, across Great Slave Lake and north along the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean.

===Nunavut===
There is a small section of the trail on Baffin Island, Nunavut, from the capital city of Iqaluit south along the Itijjagiaq trail to Kimmirut.

===Yukon===
The Yukon provides the land link between British Columbia and the Arctic. The trail enters the Yukon from British Columbia on the Alaska Highway, south of Watson Lake. Due to the vast distances and sparse population, the Yukon&#x27;s section of trail mainly follows the highway network between communities, branching off onto smaller multiuse trails near most settlements. Many of these multiuse trails are also historically significant routes, including the Copper Haul Trail near Whitehorse, the Dawson Overland Trail from Takhini to Braeburn, and the Heritage Ridge Road near Dawson City. The route north is then completed by following the Dempster Highway up to the N.W.T. border, where the trail carries on north to the Arctic Ocean.

==Promotion of the trail==
In February 2018, a &quot;special collector&#x27;s edition&quot; of the Canadian Geographic Magazine was released, titled &quot;The Great Trail&quot;. On the cover, four trails are highlighted for readers: Itijjagiaq Trail in Nunavut, The Lake Superior Water Trail in Ontario, The Edmonton River Valley in Alberta, and Cowichan Valley in British Columbia.

On September 14, 2019, the Trans Canada Trail and the Bateman Foundation teamed up to host the &quot;Nature Sketch on The Great Trail&quot; event. Seven communities across Canada hosted such events, including: Victoria, British Columbia; Vancouver, British Columbia; Calgary, Alberta; Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; Toronto, Ontario; Halifax, Nova Scotia; Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories. An artist from the Bateman Foundation team led sketching workshops for participants. This event gathered 300 people across Canada.

The 2023 documentary film &quot;500 Days in the Wild&quot; portrays the efforts of photographer Dianne Whelan to hike the entire length of the trail.

<text>Helen Amelia Thomas (August 4, 1920 – July 20, 2013) was an American reporter and author, and a long-serving member of the White House press corps. She covered the White House during the administrations of ten U.S. presidents—from the beginning of the Kennedy administration to the second year of the Obama administration.

Thomas worked for the United Press and post-1958 successor United Press International (UPI) for 57 years, first as a correspondent, and later as White House bureau manager. She then served as a columnist for Hearst Newspapers from 2000 to 2010, writing on national affairs and the White House. Thomas was the first female officer of the National Press Club, the first female member and president of the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association and the first female member of the Gridiron Club. She wrote six books; her last (with co-author Craig Crawford) was &quot;Listen Up, Mr. President: Everything You Always Wanted Your President to Know and Do&quot; (2009).

Thomas retired from Hearst Newspapers on June 7, 2010, following controversial remarks she made about Israel in an impromptu, unstructured amateur short interview when solicited for &quot;any comments on Israel,&quot; she replied, &quot;tell them to get the hell out of Palestine,&quot; leading to accusations of antisemitism. She then served as an opinion columnist for the &quot;Falls Church News-Press&quot; until February 2012.

==Early life and education==
Born in Winchester, Kentucky, Thomas was the seventh of the nine children of George and Mary (Rowady) Thomas, immigrants from Tripoli, Lebanon (then part of the Ottoman Empire). Thomas said her father&#x27;s surname, &quot;Antonious&quot;, was anglicized to &quot;Thomas&quot; when he entered the U.S. at Ellis Island, and that her parents could neither read nor write. Thomas was raised mainly in Detroit, Michigan, where her family moved when she was four years old, and where her father ran a grocery store. Of her experience growing up, Thomas said:
She also said that in Detroit in the 1920s, she came home crying from school, &quot;They wanted to make you feel you weren&#x27;t &#x27;American&#x27;... We were called &#x27;garlic eaters&#x27; &quot;. She was a member of the Antiochian Orthodox Church.

Thomas attended Detroit Public Schools, and decided to become a journalist while attending Eastern High School. She enrolled at Wayne State University in Detroit, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English in 1942, as the school did not yet offer a degree in journalism.

==Early career==
Thomas moved to Washington, D.C. Her first job in journalism was as a copygirl for the now-defunct &quot;Washington Daily News&quot;. After eight months at the paper, she joined with her colleagues in a strike action and was fired.

Thomas joined United Press in 1943 and reported on women&#x27;s topics for its radio wire service. Her first assignments focused her on societal issues, women&#x27;s news and celebrity profiles. Later in the decade, and in the early fifties, she wrote UP&#x27;s &quot;Names in the News&quot; column, for which she interviewed numerous Washington celebrities. In 1955, she was assigned to cover the United States Department of Justice. She later was assigned to cover other agencies, including the United States Department of Health, as well as Capitol Hill.

Thomas served as president of the Women&#x27;s National Press Club from 1959 through 1960. In 1959, she and a few of her fellow female journalists forced the National Press Club, then barred to women, to allow them to attend an address by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.

==Presidential correspondent==

In November 1960, Thomas began covering then President-elect John F. Kennedy, taking the initiative to switch from reporting the &quot;women&#x27;s angle&quot; to reporting the news of the day. She became a White House correspondent for UPI in January 1961. Thomas became known as the &quot;Sitting Buddha,&quot; and the &quot;First Lady of the Press.&quot; It was during Kennedy&#x27;s administration that she began ending presidential press conferences with a signature &quot;Thank you, Mr. President,&quot; reviving a tradition started by UPI&#x27;s Albert Merriman Smith during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt.
In a 2008 article, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote: &quot;Thomas, a fixture in American politics, is outspoken, blunt, demanding, forceful and unrelenting. Not only does she command respect by the highest powers in the US, her reputation is known worldwide.&quot; When Cuban leader Fidel Castro was asked in the early 2000s what was the difference between democracy in Cuba and democracy in the United States, Castro reportedly replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t have to answer questions from Helen Thomas.&quot; Thomas considered Castro&#x27;s reply to be &quot;the height of flattery.&quot;

In 1962, Thomas convinced President Kennedy not to attend the annual dinners held for the White House correspondents and photographers if they disallowed women from attending. President Kennedy moved for the dinners to be combined into one event, with women allowed to attend. In 1970, UPI named Thomas their chief White House correspondent, making her the first woman to serve in the position. She was named the chief of UPI&#x27;s White House bureau in 1974.

Thomas was the only female print journalist to accompany President Richard Nixon during his 1972 visit to China. During the Watergate scandal, Martha Mitchell, wife of United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell, frequently called Thomas to discuss how the Nixon administration was using Mitchell as a scapegoat.

Thomas circled the globe several times, traveling with every U.S. president from Richard Nixon through Barack Obama. She covered every Economic Summit since 1975, working up to the position of UPI&#x27;s White House Bureau Chief, a post she would hold for over 25 years. While serving as White House Bureau Chief, she authored a regular column for UPI, &quot;Backstairs at the White House.&quot; The column provided an insider&#x27;s view of various presidential administrations.

In 1975, the Washington Press Corps club, known as the Gridiron Club, admitted Thomas, making her the first woman to become a member. From 1975 through 1976, she served as the first female president of the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association.

Thomas was the only member of the White House Press Corps to have her own seat in the White House Briefing Room. All other seats are assigned to media outlets.

In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Thomas&#x27;s name and picture.

===Departure from UPI===
On May 17, 2000, the day after it was announced that the UPI had been acquired by News World Communications Inc., an international media conglomerate founded and controlled by Unification Church leader Reverend Sun Myung Moon which owns &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and other news media, Thomas resigned from the UPI after 57 years with the organization. She later described the change in ownership as &quot;a bridge too far.&quot; Less than two months later, she joined Hearst Newspapers as an opinion columnist, writing on national affairs and the White House.

After leaving her job as a reporter at the UPI, Thomas became more likely to air her personal, negative views. In a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she quipped, &quot;I censored myself for 50 years when I was a reporter. Now I wake up and ask myself, &#x27;Who do I hate today?&#x27;&quot;

===George W. Bush administration===
During President George W. Bush&#x27;s first term, Thomas reacted to Press Secretary Ari Fleischer&#x27;s statements about arms shipments to the terrorists by asking: &quot;Where do the Israelis get their arms?&quot;

He responded: &quot;There&#x27;s a difference, Helen, and that is—&quot;

&quot;What is the difference?&quot; she asked.

He responded: &quot;The targeting of innocents through the use of terror, which is a common enemy for Yasser Arafat and for the people of Israel, as well as—&quot;

She interrupted him, saying: &quot;Palestinian people are fighting for their land.&quot;

He responded: &quot;I think that the killing of innocents is a category entirely different. Justifying killing of innocents for land is an argument in support of terrorism.&quot;

In January 2003, following a speech at a Society of Professional Journalists banquet, Thomas told an autograph seeker, &quot;I&#x27;m covering the worst president in American history.&quot; The autograph-seeker was a sports writer for &quot;The Daily Breeze&quot; and her comments were published. After that she was not called upon during a press conference for the first time in over four decades. She wrote to the President to apologize.

For many years, Thomas sat in the front row and asked the first question during White House press conferences. However, according to Thomas in a 2006 &quot;Daily Show&quot; interview, this ended because she no longer represented a wire service. During the Bush administration, Thomas was moved to the back row during press conferences; she was called upon at briefings on a daily basis but no longer ended presidential news conferences by saying, &quot;Thank you, Mr. President.&quot; When asked why she was seated in the back row, she said, &quot;They didn&#x27;t like me. . . . I ask too many mean questions.&quot;
On March 21, 2006, Thomas was called upon directly by President Bush for the first time in three years. Thomas asked Bush about the War in Iraq:
I&#x27;d like to ask you, Mr. President, [about] your decision to invade Iraq . . . Every reason given, publicly at least, has turned out not to be true. My question is: Why did you really want to go to war? . . . You have said it wasn&#x27;t oil . . . quest for oil, it hasn&#x27;t been Israel, or anything else. What was it?

Bush responded by discussing the War on Terror, stating as a reason for the invasion that Saddam Hussein chose to deny inspectors and not to disclose required information.

In July 2006, she told &quot;The Hill&quot;, &quot;The day Dick Cheney is going to run for president, I&#x27;ll kill myself. All we need is another liar . . . I think he&#x27;d like to run, but it would be a sad day for the country if he does.&quot;

At the July 18, 2006, White House press briefing, Thomas remarked: &quot;The United States . . . could have stopped the bombardment of Lebanon. We have that much control with the Israelis . . . we have gone for collective punishment against all of Lebanon and Palestine.&quot; Press Secretary Tony Snow responded: &quot;Thank you for the Hezbollah view.&quot;

In a press conference on November 30, 2007, Thomas questioned White House Press Secretary Dana Perino as to why Americans should depend on General David Petraeus in determining when to re-deploy U.S. troops from Iraq. Perino began to answer, when Thomas interjected with &quot;You mean how many more people we kill?&quot; Perino immediately took offense, responding:
Helen, I find it really unfortunate that you use your front row position, bestowed upon you by your colleagues, to make such statements. This is a...it is an honor and a privilege to be in the briefing room, and to suggest that we, the United States, are killing innocent people is just absurd and very offensive.
Refusing to back down, Thomas responded immediately by asking Perino if she knew how many innocent Iraqis had been killed and then questioned the worth of regret when Perino responded that the administration regretted the loss of all innocent Iraqi lives.

===Obama administration===

On February 9, 2009, Thomas was present in the front row for newly elected President Obama&#x27;s first news conference. President Obama called on her with the statement, &quot;Helen. I&#x27;m excited, this is my inaugural moment,&quot; seemingly a reference to her long-term presence in the White House Press Corps. Thomas asked if he knew of any Middle Eastern country that possessed nuclear weapons, implicitly asking him to confirm or deny Israel&#x27;s alleged nuclear arsenal, despite Israel&#x27;s long held stance of &quot;nuclear ambiguity&quot;. Obama replied that he did not want to &quot;speculate&quot; on the matter.

On July 1, 2009, Thomas commented on the Obama administration&#x27;s handling of the press, &quot;we have had some control but not this control. I mean I&#x27;m amazed, I&#x27;m amazed at you people who call for openness and transparency and you have controlled...&quot;.

On August 4, 2009, Thomas celebrated her 89th birthday. President Obama, whose birthday is on the same day, presented Thomas with birthday cupcakes and sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to her before that day&#x27;s press conference.

===Comments on Israel===
Rabbi David Nesenoff of RabbiLive.com, on the White House grounds with his son and a teenage friend for a May 27, 2010, American Jewish Heritage Celebration Day, interviewed Thomas for an unscheduled short conversation as she was leaving the White House via the North Lawn driveway. When solicited for &quot;any comments on Israel,&quot; she replied, &quot;tell them to get the hell out of Palestine&quot; and: &quot;Remember, these people are occupied and it&#x27;s their land. Not German [&quot;sic&quot;], it&#x27;s not Poland.&quot; Then he asked: &quot;Where they should go? What do they do?&quot;. To which she responded: &quot;They go home.&quot; He follows-up with: &quot;Where&#x27;s the home?&quot;. She replies back with &quot;Poland, ..&quot; but in the middle of her answer, he adds to his question: &quot;So the Jews..&quot;, she adds: &quot;...Germany.&quot; He finishes off: &quot;...should go back to Poland and Germany?&quot; To which she finally responds: &quot;And America and everywhere else. Why push people out of there who have lived there for centuries? See?&quot; An about two-minutes long full cut of the May 27, 2010, interview was posted on Nesenoff&#x27;s YouTube channel on June 7.

In a later interview on CNN, on &quot;The Joy Behar Show&quot;, Thomas defended her comments. In response to Behar&#x27;s question of whether she was an antisemite, Thomas replied: &quot;Hell no! I&#x27;m a Semite, of Arab background.&quot; She then said of Israelis: &quot;They&#x27;re not Semites.&quot;

In addition, Thomas said in the CNN interview: &quot;Why do they [Jews] have to go anywhere? They aren&#x27;t being persecuted! They don&#x27;t have the right to take other people&#x27;s land.&quot; When asked if she regretted the comment, she said: &quot;We have organized lobbyists in favor of Israel, you can&#x27;t open your mouth. I can call the president of the United States anything in the book, but you say one thing about Israel and you&#x27;re off limits.&quot;

Following the controversy, The Executive Committee of the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) voted to recommend that the organization retire the Helen Thomas Award for Lifetime Achievement, which had been awarded since 2000. After her initial comments, the committee decided not to act, as it was &quot;a one-time, spontaneous remark for which she apologized&quot;, but acted after she reiterated it.

On June 4, Thomas posted the following response on her website: &quot;I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians. They do not reflect my heart-felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day come soon.&quot;

====Resignation====
Thomas&#x27;s agency, Nine Speakers, Inc., immediately dropped her as a client because of her remarks. In a statement, they said &quot;Ms. Thomas has had an esteemed career as a journalist, and she has been a trailblazer for women, helping others in her profession, and beyond. However, in light of recent events, Nine Speakers is no longer able to represent Ms. Thomas, nor can we condone her comments on the Middle East.&quot; Craig Crawford, who co-authored &quot;Listen up, Mr. President&quot;, said &quot;I ... will no longer be working with Helen on our book projects.&quot; Her scheduled delivery of a commencement speech at Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Maryland, was canceled by the school. The White House Correspondents&#x27; Association, over which she once presided, issued a statement calling her remarks &quot;indefensible&quot;. In January 2011, the Society of Professional Journalists voted to retire the Helen Thomas Award for Lifetime Achievement.

On June 7, Thomas abruptly tendered her resignation from Hearst Newspapers. The next day, in an interview on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;, President Obama called her remarks &quot;offensive&quot; and &quot;out of line&quot; and said her retirement was &quot;the right decision.&quot; He remarked that it was a &quot;shame&quot; her celebrated career had to end in such controversy, and at the same time he recognized her long service covering U.S. presidents, calling her &quot;a real institution in Washington&quot;. Her comments also garnered rebukes from numerous others, including White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, former special counsel to and White House spokesman for President Bill Clinton, Lanny Davis, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Hoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson.

Thomas did have defenders who felt she was being attacked too harshly, including former presidential candidate Ralph Nader, Fox News contributor Ellen Ratner, former UPI managing editor Michael Freedman and &quot;The Nation&quot; editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel. Nader said there was a &quot;double standard&quot; where one &quot;off-hand &#x27;ill-conceived remark&#x27;&quot; (quoting NPR ombudsman Alicia Shepard) ended Helen Thomas&#x27; career while &quot;ultra-right wing radio and cable ranters&quot; engaged in &quot;bigotry, stereotypes and falsehoods directed wholesale against Muslims, including a blatant antisemitism against Arabs&quot; keep getting rewarded with &quot;enhanced careers and fat lecture fees.&quot;

In an October 2010 radio interview with Scott Spears of WMRN, Thomas said she realized soon after making the comments that she would be fired, stating, &quot;I hit the third rail. You cannot criticize Israel in this country and survive.&quot; She added that she issued an apology because people were upset, but that ultimately, she still &quot;had the same feelings about Israel&#x27;s aggression and brutality.&quot;

==Last years==
===2010 speech and comments about Jews and Zionists===
On December 2, 2010, shortly before a speech for the eighth annual &quot;Images and Perceptions of Arab Americans&quot; conference in Dearborn, Michigan, Thomas told reporters that she still stood by the comments she had made to Nesenoff. Referring to her resignation, she said &quot;I paid a price, but it&#x27;s worth it to speak the truth.&quot; During the speech, Thomas said: &quot;Congress, the White House, Hollywood and Wall Street are owned by Zionists. No question, in my opinion.&quot; Thomas defended her comments on December 7, telling Scott Spears of Marion, Ohio radio station WMRN, &quot;I just think that people should be enlightened as to who is in charge of the opinion in this country.&quot;

The next day, the Anti-Defamation League called for journalism schools and organizations to rescind any honors given to Thomas. The organization said that Thomas had &quot;clearly, unequivocally revealed herself as a vulgar antisemite&quot; in the speech. Wayne State University in Detroit discontinued the Helen Thomas Spirit of Diversity in Media Award, which it had been granting for more than ten years, citing what it called her antisemitic remarks. Thomas objected, saying that &quot;the leaders of Wayne State University have made a mockery of the First Amendment and disgraced their understanding of its inherent freedom of speech and the press.&quot; Asked by the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; how she would respond to people who say she is antisemitic, Thomas responded: &#x27;I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m a Semite. What are you talking about?&#x27;&quot;

Thomas was interviewed for the April 2011 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, and made further contentious statements. When asked &quot;Do you actually think there’s a secret Jewish conspiracy at work in this country [the US]?&quot;, Thomas replied, &quot;Not a secret. It’s very open.&quot;

===Subsequent employment===
Thomas was employed as a columnist by the Virginia &quot;Falls Church News-Press&quot; from January 2011 to January 2012, contributing a few sporadic columns in the free weekly paper. Owner-Editor Nicholas Benton repeatedly defended the decision to hire her despite her comments. He said in 2011 that he was &quot;outraged&quot; when the Society of Professional Journalists voted on retiring a scholarship award named for Thomas. Benton defended Thomas from antisemitism by saying that Thomas &quot;is herself a Semite&quot; and was &quot;expressing a political point of view [in the interview with Nesenoff above], and not a bigoted racial sentiment.&quot;

==Personal life==
Thomas described herself as a liberal. For most of her adult life, she chose her work over her personal life. At age 51, Thomas married a colleague, Douglas Cornell, who was just retiring as the White House reporter for the Associated Press. Four years later, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and she cared for him until his death in 1982.

===Death===
Thomas died on July 20, 2013, at her home in Washington, D.C. at the age of 92. Thomas was cremated and her ashes were buried in Detroit, following a traditional Antiochian Orthodox funeral service.

==Legacy==
Many female journalists memorialized Thomas on Twitter, including Judy Woodruff, who called her a &quot;trailblazer&quot;, and Lynn Sweet, who said she was a &quot;glass ceiling breaking journalist&quot;. Andrea Mitchell tweeted that Thomas &quot;made it possible for all of us who followed.&quot;

Dana Perino, who served as press secretary to President George W. Bush, remembered that on her first day as press secretary, Thomas approached her to give her words of encouragement. President Obama released a statement calling her &quot;a true pioneer&quot; who &quot;never failed to keep presidents—myself included—on their toes.&quot;

In 2006, Thomas encouraged Arab-Americans to become journalists: &quot;For her own part, Helen Thomas says that, while she’s glad to see Americans of Arab descent winning journalism prizes, she would prefer simply to see more bylines with Arab names. So she has one instruction for newcomers: &#x27;Get into the game!&#x27; she says.&quot;

==Awards==
Thomas received numerous awards and more than 30 honorary degrees. In 1976, Thomas was named one of the &quot;World Almanac&#x27;s 25 Most Influential Women in America.&quot; In 1985, she received the Columbia University Journalism Award. and in 1984 was honored with the National Press Club Fourth Estate Award. In 2000, Thomas was presented with the Kiplinger Distinguished Contributions to Journalism Award.

In 1986 she received the William Allen White Foundation Award for Journalistic Merit from the University of Kansas. In 1993, Thomas won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. Thomas received an Al Neuharth Award for Excellence in the Media from the Freedom Forum in 1991. The White House Correspondents&#x27; Association honored her in 1998 by establishing the &quot;Helen Thomas Lifetime Achievement Award&quot;. In 2000, her alma mater, Wayne State University, established an award for journalists in her honor, the &quot;Helen Thomas Spirit of Diversity award&quot;. In December 2010, the award was discontinued by Wayne State which cited her renewed remarks similar to those in May 2010. Speaking for Wayne State, Matthew Seeger, its interim dean said, that the award is given to promote the importance of diversity in the media and that this award &quot;is no longer helping us achieve our goals.&quot; In 2007, Thomas received a Foremother Award from the National Center for Health Research.

In October 2010, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) honored Thomas with a lifetime achievement award.

In April 2012, Thomas received an award from the Palestine Liberation Organization&#x27;s General Mission to the United States. The award was presented by PLO Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi to &quot;recognize Thomas&#x27;s long career in the field of journalism, during which she defended the Palestinian position every step of the way.&quot;

The Society of Professional Journalists had an annual award for top journalists named after Thomas but decided to retire the award in 2011. The SPJ executive board initially said it would keep the award after Thomas&#x27;s May 2010 comments calling for Jews to leave Israel to the Palestinians and return to &quot;Europe, Russia and America,&quot; but the board decided to retire the award after Thomas&#x27;s remarks later in 2010 about the alleged control of the United States by Zionists. Several pro-Thomas individuals in SPJ leadership roles campaigned to have the award reinstated, but the retirement decision was upheld by SPJ&#x27;s regional leadership that year and by an 85-77 margin at the national SPJ convention, also that year, marking the permanent end of any ties between Thomas and SPJ.

<text>Joseph Louis Bernardin (April 2, 1928 – November 14, 1996) was an American Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Cincinnati from 1972 until 1982, and as Archbishop of Chicago from 1982 until his death in 1996 from pancreatic cancer. Bernardin was elevated to the cardinalate in 1983 by Pope John Paul II.

==Biography==
Joseph Bernardin was born on April 2, 1928, in Columbia, South Carolina, to Joseph Bernardin and Maria Maddalena Simion, an Austro-Hungarian born immigrant couple, from the village of Fiera di Primiero, now located in the Northern Italian region of Trentino. He was baptized and confirmed at St. Peter&#x27;s Catholic Church in Columbia. His father died of cancer when Bernardin was six. He took responsibility for his younger sister, Elaine, while his widowed mother worked as a seamstress.

Bernardin&#x27;s original academic ambition was to become a physician, inspiring him to enroll in the pre-medical program at the University of South Carolina. He then transferred to Saint Mary Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy in 1948, and subsequently enrolled in The Catholic University of America to complete his theological studies.

On April 26, 1952, Bernardin was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Charleston by John J. Russell at St. Joseph Church. This diocese covers the entire state of South Carolina. During his 14-year tenure at the Diocese of Charleston, Father Bernardin served under four bishops in capacities including chancellor, vicar general, diocesan counselor, and, when the See was vacant, diocesan administrator. In 1959, Pope John XXIII named Bernardin a Papal Chamberlain with the title Very Reverend Monsignor.

===Auxiliary Bishop of Atlanta===
On March 9, 1966, Pope Paul VI appointed Bernardin titular Bishop of Liguria and Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Atlanta. His episcopal consecration took place on April 26, 1966, at the hands of his mentor, the Archbishop of Atlanta, Paul Hallinan. Bernardin, only 38 years old, thus became the youngest bishop in America. From 1966 to 1968, Bishop Bernardin served as rector of the Cathedral of Christ the King in Atlanta, Georgia.

According to Monsignor Kenneth Velo, a former executive aide to Bernardin and head of the Catholic Church Extension Society, it was in the predominantly Baptist American South that Bernardin learned ecumenism.

===General Secretary of National Conference===
In 1968, Bernardin resigned as auxiliary bishop of Atlanta to become the first General Secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, a post he held until 1972. In 1969 Bernadin was instrumental in founding one of the conference&#x27;s most influential and successful programs, the anti-poverty Campaign for Human Development (CCHD).

During this period, Bernardin also became affiliated with the Order of Friars Minor, being received into the first order with a habit in 1972.

===Archbishop of Cincinnati===
Pope Paul VI appointed Bernardin Archbishop of Cincinnati on November 21, 1972, and he was installed there on December 19, 1972. Bernardin served the Metropolitan See of Cincinnati for nearly ten years. While there he appointed the first woman editor of the archdiocesan newspaper, &quot;The Catholic Telegraph&quot;.

While Archbishop of Cincinnati, Bernardin was named to the Sacred Congregation of Bishops, elected to the permanent council of the Synod of Bishops, and was elected president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. He worked to improve relations between Catholics and Jews, strove for better understanding between the Catholic Church and Protestant denominations, and made pastoral visits to both Poland and Hungary.

===Archbishop of Chicago===
Following the death of Cardinal John Cody of Chicago, Pope John Paul II chose Archbishop Bernardin, already prominent among his fellow American bishops, to lead the Archdiocese of Chicago. He was appointed the twelfth Bishop and seventh Archbishop of Chicago on July 10, 1982. On August 25, 1982, he was formally installed in that role by the Apostolic Delegate, Pio Laghi. Bernardin found an archdiocese in disarray, its priests disheartened by years of arbitrary administration and charges of financial misconduct. &quot;With his patient charm and willingness to listen, Bernardin won back the confidence of the clergy and the laity.&quot;

===Elevation to Cardinal===
In the Consistory of February 2, 1983, he was elevated to the Sacred College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II as Cardinal-Priest of &quot;Gesù Divino Lavoratore&quot; (Jesus the Divine Worker) as his titular church.

===Honorary degrees and awards===
In 1983, Bernardin delivered commencement addresses and received honorary degrees at the College of the Holy Cross and Notre Dame. That same year the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity was given to him by Yale University. In 1995, Bernardin was granted the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s highest honor, the Laetare Medal, given in recognition of outstanding service to the Roman Catholic Church and society.

In 1989, Bernardin was awarded the F. Sadlier Dinger Award by educational publisher William H. Sadlier, Inc. The award is presented annually in recognition of an outstanding contribution to the ministry of religious education in America. In 1990, Bernardin received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Bernardin was posthumously inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1997 in the area of Religion.

===Policy regarding clerical abuse===

Bernardin implemented a policy concerning priests accused of sexual misconduct with minors. He removed more than 20 priests and established a new review board to assess allegations, made up primarily of lay people. Bernardin&#x27;s reforms concerning this issue soon served as a model for other dioceses across the nation.

Bernardin said in a press conference that he had been accused of sexual misconduct. Former seminarian Stephen Cook claimed to have been abused by Bernardin and another priest in the 1970s. However, Cook subsequently dropped Bernardin from his lawsuit, being no longer certain that his memories, which had emerged while he was under hypnosis, were accurate. The two later reconciled. In 1995 Cook said that he had relied on people who told him things that were not true, &quot;asserting that he is absolutely convinced of Bernardin&#x27;s innocence&quot;.

Bernardin was also accused of sexual assault by James Grein in 2023, for a 1977 incident.

===Final illness===

In June 1995, following a string of international visits and pilgrimages, Bernardin underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer. On August 30, 1996, Bernardin told his flock that the cancer had returned, was in his liver, and was inoperable. He turned over the day-to-day administration of the Archdiocese to his vicar general and auxiliary bishop, Raymond Goedert. Bernardin then began to focus much of his ministry on the sick, and became the &quot;unofficial chaplain&quot; to Chicago cancer patients.

On September 23, Bernardin traveled to Rome to visit with Pope John Paul II and visit Assisi. It was on that trip that Bernardin made his funerary arrangements. Upon his return to Chicago, he arranged for the care for his mother, whom he visited daily at her nursing home, and the distribution of his personal possessions. Bernardin arranged for his personal papers and administrative files to be transported from the Residence and Pastoral Center to the Archdiocese of Chicago&#x27;s Archives and Records Center.

Two weeks before his death, he completed a book about the end of life and about his own approaching death in particular, called &quot;The Gift Of Peace&quot;, with the help of his friend and biographer Eugene Kennedy.

In his final weeks, he was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. He gave a major address, &quot;Seamless Garment of Life&quot;, at Georgetown University, where he received an award from and conversed with Father Leo J. O&#x27;Donovan, S.J., then Georgetown&#x27;s president.

He said goodbye to 800 of the diocesan and religious clergy of the Archdiocese at Holy Name Cathedral weeks before his death. On October 7, Bernardin met with the Presbyterate, and by the end of October, he withdrew from active ministry due to his deteriorating strength. In his last days, Bernardin wrote to the United States Supreme Court against assisted suicide.

On November 14, 1996, Bernardin died from pancreatic cancer at the age of 68.

The funeral homily was given by his friend Reverend Monsignor Kenneth Velo. In the weeks before his death, Bernardin emphasized to the faithful and the public that he was at peace because of his life&#x27;s profound reliance on God&#x27;s sustaining grace in his ministry and his struggles with cancer, seeing death as &quot;a continuation and a friend to prepare properly for by conducting ourselves well and letting go to abandon one&#x27;s self to God in the end&quot;. He was interred in the Bishops&#x27; Mausoleum at Mount Carmel Cemetery (Hillside, Illinois), following a Funeral Mass celebrated by his friend, Cardinal Roger Mahony, and a wake for priests at which his friend Father Scott Donahue spoke.

==Views==
===Social issues===
In 1981, Bernardin became head of the new NCCB Ad Hoc Committee on War and Peace, formed to draft a pastoral letter on nuclear proliferation. The resulting book-length letter, &quot;The Challenge of Peace: God&#x27;s Promise and Our Response&quot;, was published in 1983. An influential statement of Catholic social teaching, the document condemns nuclear warfare and states that nuclear deterrence is &quot;not an adequate strategy as a long-term basis for peace; it is a transitional strategy justifiable only in conjunction with resolute determination to pursue arms control and disarmament&quot;. In relation to his work on the nuclear question, Bernardin was featured on the front cover of a 1982 issue of &quot;Time Magazine&quot; entitled &quot;God and the Bomb&quot;.

Bernardin became a mediator between the diverging parties in the changing post-conciliar Church. In 1996, Bernardin inaugurated the Catholic Common Ground Initiative and was among the authors of its founding document &quot;Called to Be Catholic: Church in a Time of Peril,&quot; released August 12, 1996.

Bernardin is also noted for his interest in the concern of young adults, which was in part evidenced by his involvement in the nascent Theology on Tap lecture movement in the early 1980s. In 1985, he told attendees of a special Theology on Tap Mass, &quot;If I had children of my own, they would be your age. You are very special to me and to this Archdiocese.&quot;

The Windy City Gay Chorus performed at Bernardin&#x27;s funeral, reportedly at his request.

In 1985, Bernadin established an AIDS task force to determine how the Archdiocese might best care for those stricken by the AIDS crisis. In 1989, he dedicated Bonaventure House with the help of the Alexian Brothers, a residential facility for people suffering with AIDS. Bernardin was also lauded for his anti-pornography work, his leadership of the U.S. bishops, and the presidency of the Catholic Church Extension Society. In his final years, he relied heavily on the assistance of his adviser Monsignor Kenneth Velo, director of Catholic Extension.

One of his final works was writing a book about his own dying, an excerpt of which served as a &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine cover story, and which admirers saw as a lesson in dying.

===Interfaith relations===
Bernardin promoted ecumenism. While Archbishop of Cincinnati, Bernardin engaged in interfaith dialogue with Jews, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and Lutherans. In 1984, he began the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan Chicago, the successor group to the Chicago Conference on Religion and Race, and was the council&#x27;s first president. Under Bernardin, the Archdiocese of Chicago established covenants with the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago in 1986 and with the Metropolitan Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 1989.

Bernardin attended the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1993. In 1995, he led an interfaith pilgrimage to the Holy Land to meet with government and religious leaders in Israel and Palestine and promote peace. Bernardin condemned violence in Lebanon, Israel, and Northern Ireland and called for the Catholic Church to become a &quot;peace church&quot;.

==Legacy==
Bernardin was an influential figure in the Catholic Church in the United States following the Second Vatican Council; George Weigel called him &quot;arguably the most powerful Catholic prelate in American history&quot;.

Two Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of Chicago were named after him: the Cardinal Joseph Bernardin School in Orland Hills, Illinois, and the Cardinal Bernardin Early Childhood Center.

Loyola University Chicago&#x27;s Cancer Treatment Center is named the &quot;Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center.&quot;

In his hometown of Columbia, South Carolina, at the church of his Baptism and Confirmation, St. Peter&#x27;s, consecrated the Cardinal Bernadin Center; and the University of South Carolina established the annual &quot;Joseph Cardinal Bernardin Lecture&quot; in 1999. Cardinal Bernardin Way in Chicago is named after him. Catholic Theological Union (CTU) in Chicago is home to the Bernardin Center for Theology and Ministry, which hosts Bernardin&#x27;s Catholic Common Ground Initiative (CCGI).

The CCHD has established for youth achievers the Cardinal Joseph Bernardin New Leadership Award, given out each year in the United States.

==Criticism==
Neoconservative author George Weigel has been a severe critic of Bernardin and his influence in the Catholic Church in the United States. Weigel accused Bernardin of creating a &quot;Bernardin Machine&quot; to appoint bishops who dominated the American hierarchy for decades, and also of being the exponent of a &quot;culturally accommodating Catholicism&quot;. He deemed the defeat of Bishop Gerald Kicanas by then-Archbishop Timothy Dolan for the presidency of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, in November 2010, as &quot;the end of the Bernardin era&quot;.

<doc id="304084" wikidata="Q569759" url="?curid=304084" title="Harry Gibson">
<text>Harry &quot;The Hipster&quot; Gibson (June 27, 1915 – May 3, 1991), born Harry Raab, was an American jazz pianist, singer, and songwriter. He played New York style stride piano and boogie woogie while singing in a wild, unrestrained style. His music career began in the late 1920s, when, under his real name, he played stride piano in Dixieland jazz bands in Harlem. He continued to perform there throughout the 1930s, adding the barrelhouse boogie of the time to his repertoire.

== Early life ==
Gibson was Jewish. He came from a musical family that operated a player piano repair shop. He began playing piano in the 1920s as a child, in the Bronx and Harlem. His first professional piano gig was at age 13 with his uncle&#x27;s orchestra. He began playing boogie woogie and talking in a jive style. He was invited into black speakeasies in Harlem to play piano while still a teenager.

==Career==
In the 1930s, after Prohibition ended, Gibson played regularly in Harlem nightclubs. He punctuated his piano stylings with a running line of jive patter, which can be traced directly to recordings of the late-1930s jazz personality Tempo King (1915–1939), who was described by columnist Walter Winchell as &quot;the white Fats Waller&quot;. King peppered his vocals with enthusiastic exclamations. After King&#x27;s untimely death in June 1939, Gibson made King&#x27;s vocal mannerisms his own.

Gibson was fond of playing Fats Waller tunes, and when Waller heard Gibson in a club in Harlem in 1939 he hired Gibson to be his relief pianist at club dates. Between 1939 and 1945, Gibson played at Manhattan jazz clubs on 52nd Street (&quot;Swing Street&quot;), most notably the Three Deuces, run by Irving Alexander, and Leon and Eddie&#x27;s run by Leon Enkin and Eddie Davis. During one audition for a nightclub engagement, where he played piano for a girl singer, he gave his true name of Harry Raab. The club owner insisted on a &quot;showbiz&quot; name, shouting, &quot;I&#x27;m calling you two The Gibsons!&quot; Harry adopted Gibson as his professional name.

In the 1940s, Gibson was known for writing unusual songs considered ahead of their time. He was also known for his unique, wild singing style, his energetic and unorthodox piano styles, and his intricate mixture of hardcore, gutbucket boogie rhythms with ragtime, stride and jazz piano styles. He took the boogie woogie beat of his predecessors, but he made it frantic, similar to the rock and roll music of the 1950s. Examples of his wild style are found in &quot;Riot in Boogie&quot; and &quot;Barrelhouse Boogie&quot;. An example of his strange singing style is &quot;The Baby and the Pup&quot;. Other songs that he recorded were &quot;Handsome Harry, the Hipster&quot;, &quot;I Stay Brown All Year &#x27;Round&quot;, 4-F Ferdinand the Frantic Freak&quot;, &quot;Get Your Juices at the Deuces&quot; and &quot;Stop That Dancin&#x27; Up There&quot;.

Gibson recorded often, but there are very few visual examples of his work. In 1944, he filmed three songs in New York for the Soundies film jukeboxes, and he went to Hollywood in 1946 to appear as himself in the feature-length film musical &quot;Junior Prom&quot;. He preceded white rock-and-rollers by a decade: the Soundies he recorded are similar to Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27;s raucous piano numbers of the 1950s.

Like Mezz Mezzrow, Gibson consciously abandoned his ethnicity to adopt black music and culture. He grew up near Harlem in New York City, and his constant use of black jive talk was not an affectation; it was something he picked up from his fellow musicians. His song &quot;I Stay Brown All Year Round&quot; is based on this. In his autobiography, he claimed he coined the term hipster between 1939 and 1945 when he was performing on Swing Street, and he started using &quot;Harry the Hipster&quot; as his stage name.

==Classical music work==
Gibson&#x27;s wild-man theatrics belied the fact that he was also a highly trained classical musician. While working on &quot;Swing Street&quot; at night, he was a fellow at the Juilliard Graduate School during the day.

Gibson was invited to perform at Carnegie Hall, for a jazz concert held on December 2, 1944. Hosted by Eddie Condon, the program featured many celebrities from the jazz world. Gibson performed a serious rendition of Bix Beiderbecke&#x27;s piano piece &quot;In a Mist&quot;. &quot;The acoustics are so big in Carnegie Hall that when I hit that piano, I thought I was playing 40 pianos,&quot; said Gibson. &quot;After I did the Carnegie Hall concert, I got a write-up in &quot;Downbeat&quot; and he said the best thing in the whole program was Harry Gibson, the guy that went up and played Bix Beiderbecke solos. Musicraft [Records] saw the writeup, came down to the Deuces to listen to me. Billie Holiday was late for her show, and Irving Alexander always stuck me on when she was late for her show to keep the people there... And I&#x27;m doing my Harry the Hipster act... and I go out with &#x27;Barrelhouse Boogie.&#x27;&quot;
Musicraft signed Gibson on the spot, and he recruited drummer Big Sid Catlett and bassist John Simmons for a recording session the next morning, resulting in the hit album &quot;Boogie Woogie in Blue.&quot; &quot;Eight songs, and not a clinker in &#x27;em,&quot; said Gibson proudly. &quot;Right straight out, eight takes, eight songs. Perfect.&quot;

==Notoriety==
He recorded &quot;Who Put the Benzedrine in Mrs. Murphy&#x27;s Ovaltine?&quot;, released in January 1946. &quot;I was with Musicraft at the time,&quot; recalled Gibson in a radio interview with Dr. Demento. &quot;We got in there, man, we knocked the tune off and bam! I get splashes [press coverage] for a month. One month later, benzedrine becomes illegal. You dig, it was legal when I made it. They put the kibosh on the record and they stamped it subversive.&quot; Radio stations across America refused to play it, and Gibson was blacklisted in the music industry. Although his mainstream movie appearance in &quot;Junior Prom&quot; was released that year, it could not overcome the notoriety of the &quot;Benzedrine&quot; record.

Sidelined from a recording career, Gibson pursued live appearances. In 1946 he was hired by impresario J. J. Shubert for Mae West&#x27;s touring stage show. He spent time in Miami during the 1950s, and appeared at the Ball &amp; Chain nightclub in Miami on the same bill with Billie Holiday during the Christmas season of 1956. With the rising popularity of young rock-and-roll musicians among teenagers in the 1950s, older musicians were not in demand, and Gibson&#x27;s own drug use led to his decline. 

==Career change and comeback==
In the 1960s, when Gibson saw the success of the Beatles, he switched to rock and roll. By the 1970s, he was playing hard rock, blues, bop, novelty songs, and a few songs that mixed ragtime with rock and roll. His hipster act became a hippie act. His old records were revived on Dr. Demento&#x27;s national radio show, particularly &quot;Benzedrine&quot;, which was included on the 1975 compilation album &quot;Dr. Demento&#x27;s Delights&quot;.

His comeback resulted in three new albums: &quot;Harry the Hipster Digs Christmas,&quot; &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Crazy but Me,&quot; (its title taken from the lyrics of &quot;Stop That Dancin&#x27; Up There&quot;) (Progressive, 1986), and &quot;Who Put the Benzedrine in Mrs. Murphy&#x27;s Ovaltine&quot; (Delmark, 1989). The latter two feature jazz, blues, ragtime, and rock and roll songs about reefer, nude bathing, hippie communes, strip clubs, male chauvinists, &quot;rocking the 88s&quot;, and Shirley MacLaine.

Gibson may have been the only jazz pianist of the 1930s and 1940s to go on to play in rock bands in the 1970s and 1980s. The only constants were his tendency to play hard-rocking boogie woogie and his tongue-in-cheek references to drug use. In 1991, shortly before his death, his family filmed a biographical featurette on his life and music, &quot;Boogie in Blue&quot;, published as a VHS video that year.

Gibson died from a self-inflicted gunshot on May 3, 1991, after suffering from congestive heart failure. He was 75.

<text>William Moses Kunstler (July 7, 1919 – September 4, 1995) was an American attorney and civil rights activist, known for defending the Chicago Seven. Kunstler was an active member of the National Lawyers Guild, a board member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the co-founder of the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), the &quot;leading gathering place for radical lawyers in the country.&quot;

Kunstler&#x27;s defense of the Chicago Seven from 1969 to 1970 led &quot;The New York Times&quot; to label him &quot;the country&#x27;s most controversial and, perhaps, its best-known lawyer&quot;. Kunstler is also well known for defending members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, Catonsville Nine, Black Panther Party, Weather Underground Organization, the Attica Prison rioters, Meir Kahane assassin El Sayyid Nosair, and the American Indian Movement. He also won a &quot;de facto&quot; segregation case regarding the District of Columbia&#x27;s public schools and &quot;disinterred, singlehandedly&quot; the concept of federal criminal removal jurisdiction in the 1960s. Kunstler refused to defend right-wing groups, such as the Minutemen, on the grounds that &quot;I only defend those whose goals I share. I&#x27;m not a lawyer for hire. I only defend those I love.&quot;

He was a polarizing figure; many on the right wished to see him disbarred, while many on the left admired him as a &quot;symbol of a certain kind of radical lawyer.&quot; Even some other civil rights lawyers regarded Kunstler as a &quot;publicity hound and a hit-and-run lawyer&quot; who &quot;brings cases on Page 1 and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund wins them on Page 68.&quot; Legal writer Sidney Zion quipped that Kunstler was &quot;one of the few lawyers in town who knows how to talk to the press. His stories always check out and he&#x27;s not afraid to talk to you, and he&#x27;s got credibility—although you&#x27;ve got to ask sometimes, &#x27;Bill, is it &quot;really&quot; true?&#x27;&quot;

==Early life==
Kunstler was born to a Jewish family in New York City, the son of Frances Mandelbaum and Monroe Bradford Kunstler, a physician. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School. After high school, he attended Yale University, where he majored in French and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1941. He then went on to attend Columbia Law School from which he graduated in 1948. While at Yale, Kunstler was an avid poet and represented Yale in the Glascock Prize competition at Mount Holyoke College.

Rejected twice by the United States Navy, Kunstler served in the U.S. Army during World War II in the Pacific theater. He volunteered for cryptography and served in New Guinea. He rose to the rank of major and received the Bronze Star. While in the army, he was noted for his theatric portrayals in the Fort Monmouth Dramatic Association.

After his discharge from the Army, he attended law school, was admitted to the bar in New York in 1948 and began practicing law. Kunstler went through R.H. Macy&#x27;s executive training program in the late 1940s and practiced family and small-business law in the 1950s, before entering civil-rights litigation in the 1960s. He was an associate professor of law at New York Law School (1950–1951).

Kunstler won honorable mention for the National Legal Aid Association&#x27;s press award in 1957 for his series of radio broadcasts on WNEW, &quot;The Law on Trial&quot;. At WNEW, Kunstler also conducted interviews on controversial topics, such as the Alger Hiss case, on a program called &quot;Counterpoint&quot;.

==Civil rights career==
===Rise to prominence (1957–1964)===
Kunstler first made headlines in 1957 when he unsuccessfully defended William Worthy, a correspondent for the &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot;, who was one of 42 Americans who had their passports seized after violating the State Department&#x27;s travel ban on Communist China (after attending a Communist youth conference in Moscow). Kunstler refused a State Department compromise, which would have returned Worthy&#x27;s passport if he agreed to cease visiting Communist countries, a condition Worthy considered unconstitutional.

Kunstler played an important role as a civil-rights lawyer in the 1960s, traveling to many of the segregated battlegrounds to work to free those who had been jailed. Working on behalf of the ACLU, Kunstler defended the Freedom Riders in Mississippi in 1961. Kunstler filed for a writ of habeas corpus with Sidney Mize, a federal judge in Biloxi, and appealed to the Fifth Circuit; he also filed similar pleas in state courts. Judge Leon Hendrick in Hinds County refused Kunstler&#x27;s motion to cancel the mass appearance (involving hundreds of miles of travel) of all 187 convicted riders. The riders were convicted in a bench trial in Jackson and appealed to a county jury trial, where Kunstler argued that the county systematically discriminated against African-American jurors.

In 1962, Kunstler took part in efforts to integrate public parks and libraries in Albany, Georgia. Later that year, he published &quot;The Case for Courage&quot; (modeled on President Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;) highlighting the efforts of other lawyers who risked their careers for controversial clients, as well as similar acts by public servants. At the time of the publication, Kunstler was already well known for his work with the Freedom Riders, his book on the Caryl Chessman case, and his radio coverage of trials. Kunstler also joined a group of lawyers criticizing the application of Alabama&#x27;s civil libel laws and spoke at a rally against HUAC.

In 1963, for the Gandhi Society of New York, Kunstler filed to remove the cases of more than 100 arrested African-American demonstrators from the Danville Corporation Court to the Charlottesville District Court, under a Reconstruction Era statute. Although the district judge remanded the cases to city court, he dissolved the city&#x27;s injunction against demonstrations. In doing so, Judge Thomas J. Michie rejected a Justice Department &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief urging the removal to create a test case for the statute. Kunstler appealed to the Fourth Circuit. That year, Kunstler also sued public-housing authorities in Westchester County.

In 1964, Kunstler defended a group of four accused of kidnapping a white couple, and succeeded in getting the alleged weapons thrown out as evidence, as they could not be positively identified as those used. That year, he also challenged Mississippi&#x27;s unpledged elector law and racial segregation in primary elections; he also defended three members of the Blood Brothers, a Harlem gang, charged with murder.

Kunstler went to St. Augustine, Florida, in 1964 during the demonstrations led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Dr. Robert B. Hayling, which put added pressure on Congress to pass the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. Kunstler brought the first federal case under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which allowed the removal of cases from county court to be appealed; the defendants were protestors at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

===ACLU director (1964–1972)===
He was a director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) from 1964 to 1972, when he became a member of the ACLU National Council. In 1966, he co-founded the Center for Constitutional Rights. Kunstler also worked with the National Lawyers Guild.

In 1965, Kunstler&#x27;s firm - Kunstler, Kunstler, and Kinoy - was asked to defend Jack Ruby by his brother Earl, but dropped the case because they &quot;did not wish to be in a situation where we have to fight to get into the case&quot;. Ruby was eventually permitted to replace his original defense team with Kunstler, who got him a new trial. In 1966, he also defended an arsonist who burned down a Jewish Community Center, killing 12, because he was not provided a lawyer before he signed a confession.

Kunstler&#x27;s other notable clients include: Salvador Agron, H. Rap Brown, Lenny Bruce, Stokely Carmichael, the Catonsville Nine, Angela Davis, Larry Davis, Gregory Lee Johnson, Martin Luther King Jr., Gary McGivern, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Filiberto Ojeda Rios, Assata Shakur, Lemuel Smith, Morton Sobell, Wayne Williams, and Michael X.

===Chicago Seven (1969–1972)===

Kunstler gained national renown for defending the Chicago Seven (originally Chicago Eight), in a five-month trial in 1969–1970, against charges of conspiring to incite riots in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Under cross-examination, Kunstler got a key police witness to contradict his previous testimony and admit that he had not witnessed Jerry Rubin, but had rather been given his name two weeks later by the FBI. Another prosecution witness, photographer Louis Salzberg, admitted under Kunstler&#x27;s cross-examination that he was still on the payroll of the FBI.

The trial was marked by frequent clashes between Kunstler and U.S. Attorney Thomas Foran, with Kunstler taking the opportunity to accuse the government of failing to &quot;realize the extent of antiwar sentiment&quot;. Kunstler also sparred with Judge Julius Hoffman, on one occasion remarking (with respect to the number of federal marshals): &quot;this courtroom has the appearance of an armed camp. I would note that the Supreme Court has ruled that the appearance of an armed camp is a reversible error&quot;. During one heated exchange, Kunstler informed Hoffman that his entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; was three times longer than the judge&#x27;s, to which the judge replied: &quot;I hope you get a better obituary.&quot; Kunstler and co-defense attorneys Leonard Weinglass, Michael Kennedy, Gerald Lefcourt, Dennis Roberts and Michael Tigar were cited for contempt (the convictions were later overturned unanimously by the Seventh Circuit). If Hoffman&#x27;s contempt conviction had been allowed to stand, Kunstler would have been imprisoned for an unprecedented four years.
The progress of the trial—which had many aspects of guerrilla theater—was covered on the nightly news and made Kunstler the best-known lawyer in the country, and something of a folk hero. After much deadlock, the jury acquitted all seven on the conspiracy charge, but convicted five of violating the anti-riot provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The Seventh Circuit overturned all the convictions on November 21, 1972, due to Hoffman&#x27;s refusal to let defense lawyers question the prospective jurors on racial and cultural biases; the Justice Department did not retry the case.

Shortly after the 1968 Democratic Convention, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Dave Dellinger, and Robert Greenblatt received subpoenas to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Kunstler and co-counsel, Michael Kennedy, were among the group&#x27;s six defense attorneys.

On the opening day of the HUAC hearings, the subpoenaed men and their lawyers, including Kunstler and Kennedy, staged a “stand-in” to protest the investigations. “The Constitution is being raped and we as lawyers are being emasculated in an armed camp,” Kennedy shouted at the hearing.

===American Indian Movement (1973–1976)===
Kunstler arrived in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, on March 4, 1973, to draw up the demands of the American Indian Movement (AIM) members involved in the Wounded Knee incident. Kunstler, who headed the defense, called the trial &quot;the most important Indian trial of the 20th century&quot;, attempting to center the defense on the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868). Kunstler&#x27;s team represented Russell Means and Dennis Banks, two of the leaders of the occupation.

Kunstler objected to the heavy trial security on the grounds that it could prejudice the jury and Judge Fred J. Nichol agreed to ease measures. The trial was moved to Minnesota. Two authors and three Sioux were called as defense witnesses, mostly focusing on the historical (and more recent) injustice against the Sioux on the part of the U.S. government, shocking the prosecution.

In 1975, Kunstler defended AIM members Robert Robideau and Darrelle Butler in the slaying of two FBI agents, Jack Coler and Ronald Williams, at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, not far from the site of the Wounded Knee incident. Butler and Robideau had become involved in the shootout in which Coler and Williams were killed after running to the aid of other AIM members who were shooting at the agents; Kunstler argued that &quot;an atmosphere of fear and violence&quot; existed between the FBI and the AIM, and as a result Butler and Robideau had feared for their lives when they heard gunfire and acted in perceived self-defense. At the trial in 1976, Kunstler subpoenaed prominent government officials to testify about the existence of a Counter-Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO) against Native American activists. District Judge Edward J. McManus approved Kunstler&#x27;s attempt to subpoena FBI director Clarence M. Kelley. Robideau and Butler were ultimately acquitted, with the jury agreeing with Kunstler&#x27;s argument that they had acted in fear for their lives. Leonard Peltier, who had also participated in the shootout, was later convicted of the murders; he did not retain Kunstler to defend him.

Kunstler also defended a Native American woman who refused to send her daughter with muscular dystrophy to school.

===Attica (1974–1976)===
In 1974–1975, Kunstler defended a prisoner charged with killing a guard during the Attica Prison riot. Under cross-examination, Kunstler forced Correction Officer Donald Melven to retract his sworn identification of John Hill, Kunstler&#x27;s client, and Charles Pernasilice (defended by Richard Miller), admitting he still retained &quot;slight&quot; doubts that he confessed to investigators at the time of the incident. Kunstler focused on pointing out that all the other prosecution witnesses were testifying under reduced-sentencing agreements and called five prison inmates as defense witnesses (Miller called none), who testified that other prisoners hit the guard.

Despite Justice King&#x27;s repeated warnings to Kunstler to &quot;be careful, sir&quot;, Kunstler quickly became &quot;the star of the trial, the man the jurors watch most attentively, and the lawyer whose voice carries most forcefully&quot;. Although the prosecution was careful to avoid personal confrontation with Kunstler, who frequently charmed the jury with jokes, on one occasion, Kunstler provoked a shouting match with the lead prosecutor, allegedly to wake up a sleeping jury member. The jury convicted Hill of murder and Pernasilice of attempted assault. When Kunstler protested that the defendants would risk being murdered due to the judges remanding them, King threatened to send Kunstler with them. New York Governor Hugh Carey granted executive clemency to Hill and the other inmates in 1976, even though Hill&#x27;s name was not on the recommended list of pardons delivered to the governor and his appeals were still pending.

In June, Kunstler and Barbara Handshu, representing another inmate at Attica, Mariano Gonzales, asked for a new hearing on the role of FBI informant Mary Jo Cook.

===Assata Shakur (1977)===
Kunstler joined the defense staff of Assata Shakur in 1977, charged in New Jersey with a variety of felonies in connection with a 1973 shootout with New Jersey State Troopers. Shakur, sentenced to life imprisonment, in early 1979 escaped from prison. In 1984, Shakur was granted asylum in Cuba by Fidel Castro, who called the charges “an infamous lie&quot;. William Kunstler told reporters in 1979 that Shakur&#x27;s health had declined in prison; he said: “I was very happy that she escaped because I thought she was unfairly tried&quot;.

===Collaboration with Ron Kuby (1983–1995)===
From 1983 until Kunstler&#x27;s death in 1995, Ron Kuby was his partner. The two took on controversial civil-rights and criminal cases, including cases where they represented Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, head of the Egyptian-based terrorist group Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyah, responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Colin Ferguson, the man responsible for the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting, who would later reject Kuby and Kunstler&#x27;s legal counsel and choose to represent himself at trial; Qubilah Shabazz, the daughter of Malcolm X, accused of plotting to murder Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam; Glenn Harris, a New York City public-school teacher who absconded with a 15-year-old girl for two months; Nico Minardos, a flamboyant actor indicted by Rudy Giuliani for conspiracy to ship arms to Iran; Darrell Cabey, one of the persons shot by Bernard Goetz; and associates of the Gambino crime family.

Kunstler&#x27;s defense of the three clerics made him &quot;more visible, more venerated, more vilified than ever&quot;.

During the first Gulf War, they represented dozens of American soldiers who refused to fight and claimed conscientious objector status. They also represented El-Sayyid Nosair, the accused assassin of extreme Zionist leader Meir Kahane, and won acquittal for him on the murder charge, although he was convicted on other charges.

==Representation of mobsters==
Kunstler represented a number of convicted mafiosi during his career, claiming &quot;they were victims of government persecution&quot;, and said to have &quot;never made a nickel on an OC [organized crime] case&quot;. The more notorious of Kunstler&#x27;s mobster clients included Joe Bonanno, Raymond L.S. Patriarca, Nicholas L. Bianco, John Gotti, and Louis Ferrante, who claimed in his memoir, &quot;Unlocked: the Life and Crimes of a Mafia Insider,&quot; that Kunstler &quot;took a hundred grand off me.&quot;

==Other work==
Kunstler represented Larry Layton, one of the accused killers, at the behest of People&#x27;s Temple (PT) founder Jim Jones, of Congressman Leo Ryan, who in November 1978 had ventured to Jonestown, the PT settlement in Guyana, South America, to investigate the allegations by family members and dissidents that the PT (which had built its reputation on deceptive alliances with populist Christian, anti-racist and then left-wing and universalist causes) was a cult riven with torture, sexual abuse, corruption and mass suicide drills. Layton disguised himself as a defector and initiated the gunfire on November 18 against Ryan and his secretary and accompanying journalists, following which Jim Jones ordered and then enforced the deaths of more than 900 people, almost one-third of them children, as a purported act of revolution. This was the vast majority of followers in Jonestown. Layton was a cult member whose sister, Deborah Layton, was one of those whose fleeing triggered the leader&#x27;s increasing paranoia, and in her memoir describes the brainwashed and totalist (psychiatrist Robert Lifton) environment of the PT. Kuntsler&#x27;s defense was premised on the idea that Layton was not personally responsible.

In 1979, Kunstler represented Marvin Barnes, an ABA and NBA basketball player, with past legal troubles and league discipline problems. In 1981, Kunstler defended boxer James Scott at his second murder trial, which ended with Scott being found guilty of murder.

In 1989–1990, Kunstler twice argued successfully in defense of flag burning, before the Supreme Court. In &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot; and &quot;United States v. Eichman&quot;, the Court held the act to be protected speech under the First Amendment, striking down Texas state and Federal statutes on &quot;flag desecration&quot;.

Kunstler appeared as a lawyer in the movie &quot;The Doors&quot; in 1991, as a judge in the movie &quot;Malcolm X&quot; in 1992, and as himself in several television documentaries.

In 1993 Kunstler represented Yusuf Saalam of the Central Park 5 during his appeal, a move which alienated several friends.

During the 1994–95 television season, Kunstler starred as himself in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; titled &quot;White Rabbit&quot;, defending a woman charged with complicity in the 1971 murder of a policeman during the robbery of an armored car; the plot was based on the real-life story of Katherine Ann Power, who turned herself in to authorities in 1993.

==Death and legacy==
In late 1995, Kunstler died in New York City of heart failure at the age of 76. In his last major public appearance, at the commencement ceremonies for the University at Buffalo&#x27;s School of Architecture and Planning, Kunstler lambasted the death penalty, saying: &quot;We have become the charnel house of the Western world with reference to executions; the next closest to us is the Republic of South Africa.&quot; Ron Kuby, in his eulogy of Kunstler, said: &quot;While defending the Chicago Seven, [Kunstler] put the war in Vietnam on trial, asking Judy Collins to sing &#x27;Where Have All The Flowers Gone?&#x27; from the witness stand, placing a Viet Cong flag on the defense table, and wearing a black armband to commemorate the war dead.&quot;

William Kunstler was survived by his wife Margaret Ratner Kunstler (who was previously married to Kunstler&#x27;s close friend Michael Ratner) and his four daughters Karin Kunstler Goldman, Jane Drazek, Sarah Kunstler and Emily Kunstler, and several grandchildren.

Emily Kunstler and Sarah Kunstler produced a documentary about their father entitled &quot;William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe&quot;, which had a screening as part of the Documentary Competition of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.

<text>Cheshire cheese is a dense and crumbly cheese produced in the English county of Cheshire, and four neighbouring counties: Denbighshire and Flintshire in Wales, and Shropshire and Staffordshire in England.

==History==
Cheshire cheese is one of the oldest recorded named cheeses in British history: it is first mentioned, along with a Shropshire cheese, by Thomas Muffet in &quot;Health&#x27;s Improvement&quot; (c. 1580). There is an unsupported myth that Cheshire cheese is referred to in Domesday Book.

Cheshire was the most popular type of cheese on the market in the late 18th century. In 1758 the Royal Navy ordered that ships be stocked with Cheshire and Gloucester cheeses. By 1823, Cheshire cheese production was estimated at 10,000 tonnes per year; in around 1870, it was estimated as 12,000 tons per year.

Until the late 19th century, the different varieties of Cheshire cheeses were aged to a sufficient level of hardness to withstand the rigours of transport (by horse and cart, and later by boat) to London for sale. Younger, fresher, crumbly cheese that required shorter storage – similar to the Cheshire cheese of today – began to gain popularity towards the end of the 19th century, particularly in the industrial areas in the North and the Midlands. It was a cheaper cheese to make as it required less storage.

Sales of Cheshire cheese peaked at around 40,000 tonnes in 1960, subsequently declining as the range of cheeses available in the UK grew considerably. Cheshire cheese remains the UK&#x27;s largest-selling crumbly cheese, with sales of around 6,000 tonnes per year.

The county remains an important centre for cheese and cheese making, and until 2021, held the International Cheese Awards in Nantwich.

==Form==
Cheshire cheese is dense and semi-hard, and is defined by its moist, crumbly texture and mild, salty taste. Industrial versions tend to be drier and less crumbly, more like a mild Cheddar cheese, as this makes them easier to process than cheese with the traditional texture. The Cheshire family of cheeses is a distinct group that includes other crumbly cheeses from the North of England such as Wensleydale and Crumbly Lancashire.

Cheshire cheese comes in three varieties: red, white and blue. The original plain white version accounts for most of the production.

===Red===
Red Cheshire, coloured with annatto to a shade of deep orange, was developed in the hills of North Wales and sold to travellers on the road to Holyhead. This trade was so successful that the travellers came to believe that all Cheshire cheese was orange, and producers in its home county were obliged to dye their cheese in order to match the expectations of the market.

===Blue===
Blue Cheshire has blue veins like Stilton or Shropshire Blue, but is less creamy than Stilton and is not coloured orange as Shropshire Blue is. Historically, it was much favoured in London clubs since the Georgian period. It has a long history, but production ceased in the late 1980s. Recently it has been revived by several manufacturers in England.

<doc id="304089" wikidata="Q285372" url="?curid=304089" title="Eric Bischoff">
<text>Eric Aaron Bischoff (born May 27, 1955) is an American television producer, professional wrestling booker, promoter, and performer. He is best known for serving as Executive Producer and later Senior Vice President of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and subsequently, the on-screen General Manager of WWE&#x27;s Raw brand. Bischoff has also worked with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) where he served as Executive Producer of &quot;TNA iMPACT!&quot;. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2021.

With an amateur background in martial arts, Bischoff also sporadically performed as an in-ring competitor, becoming a one-time WCW Hardcore Champion, and headlining the 1998 Road Wild pay-per-view event, teaming with &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan against Diamond Dallas Page and Jay Leno. He wrote an autobiography titled &quot;Controversy Creates Cash&quot;, which was released in 2006 under WWE Books, and a second book, titled &quot;Grateful&quot;, which was released in 2022.

==Early life==
Bischoff was born on May 27, 1955, in Detroit, Michigan, and attended Dort Elementary School in suburban Roseville. In 1968, the family moved to Penn Hills, Pennsylvania. Bischoff is of German and Scottish descent. Before getting into professional wrestling, Bischoff had a number of occupations. He acted in a training video for bank employees regarding fair lending practices, owned a successful landscape construction company, worked as a veterinary assistant, competed as a professional kickboxer, and ran a butcher shop, where he sold meat via van delivery. Hulk Hogan would famously refer to this time in his life during his heel promo at the end of the 1996 WCW pay-per-view event Bash at the Beach in Daytona Beach, Florida, saying, &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t for Hulk Hogan, Eric Bischoff would still be selling meat from a truck in Minneapolis.&quot;

==Professional wrestling career==
===American Wrestling Association (1986–1991)===
Bischoff started in wrestling working for the Minneapolis, Minnesota based American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1987 under the ownership of Verne Gagne. In 1989, Bischoff would become an on-air interviewer and host of the AWA until the company folded in 1991. Bischoff at first worked in the sales department on the AWA&#x27;s syndicated programming, and became an on-air personality virtually by accident and at the last minute. Larry Nelson, whom at the time was employed by the AWA as an announcer, was arrested under suspicion of a DUI. Because of Nelson&#x27;s sudden unavailability, Verne Gagne and his son, Greg opted to recruit Bischoff (who initially had no desire to be in front of the camera) to fill-in on the interviews. Bischoff believed they thought he would be a good replacement due to his immediate availability in the television studio, and the fact that he was already wearing a suit and tie.

During the gradual demise of the AWA, the company was unable to meet payroll, and Bischoff auditioned for an announcer&#x27;s position with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1990 but was not hired. During his audition, Bischoff was asked to do an on-camera interview to a broom, which Bischoff would later consider a huge embarrassment for himself.

In his autobiography &quot;Controversy Creates Cash&quot;, Bischoff mentions working in his office during his time in the AWA when he had heard a legitimate fight outside of his door. He said he had looked up just in time to see wrestler The Sheik&#x27;s head come breaking through the wall. He said despite this, the Sheik continued the fight while a stunned Bischoff looked on.

===World Championship Wrestling (1991–2001)===
====Arrival and ascent to power (1991–1996)====
In 1991, Bischoff joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as a C-show announcer, recognized by many as “B-dawg on the C-show”, debuting at The Great American Bash. As an announcer, Bischoff reported to producer Tony Schiavone and WCW&#x27;s Vice President of Broadcasting, Jim Ross. In 1993, after WCW Vice President of Wrestling Operations Bill Watts resigned from WCW, Bischoff went to TBS executive and WCW President Bill Shaw and WCW Executive Vice President Bob Dhue to apply for the job of Executive Producer. Ross and Schiavone seemed to be the two top candidates, however, Bischoff was hired in Watts&#x27; place. Schiavone remained a producer and commentator until WCW&#x27;s demise, but Ross was granted his release from WCW and went to work for the WWF. Initially, Bischoff and Dhue worked together as partners, but frequently clashed over the direction of WCW.

In 1994, Bischoff was promoted from Executive Producer to Senior Vice President, putting him in charge of everything WCW. Dhue resigned, as did event manager Don Sandefeur and junior vice president Jim Barnett. Bischoff convinced Turner executives to better finance WCW in order to compete with the WWF. He moved WCW production to Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida. Hulk Hogan, who was filming a show called &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot; at Disney-MGM Studios, was approached by Bischoff and Ric Flair and signed to a contract with WCW. He also invested money in production values and increased the number of WCW pay-per-views (first seven a year, then 10, and then once a month). He also started a weekly live program on TNT, &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, that went directly against WWF&#x27;s flagship &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. Bischoff remained an announcer on &quot;Nitro&quot;, regularly spoiling &quot;Raw&quot; results (as the latter show was not always aired live) to boost ratings. This created what became known amongst fans as the Monday Night War, as both WCW and WWF fought for viewers and in the process kick-started a new level of mainstream popularity for pro wrestling. The changes paid off, and in 1995, WCW turned a profit for the first time in WCW&#x27;s history. By 1997, Bischoff&#x27;s official job title was President of World Championship Wrestling.

====New World Order (1996–1998)====

In 1996, Bischoff signed WWF superstar Scott Hall, better known at the time as &quot;Razor Ramon&quot;. Two weeks later on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hall was joined by Kevin Nash, most previously known as &quot;Diesel&quot; in the WWF, to become &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. Bischoff intentionally depicted the duo as WWF rebels who were not under contract to WCW. To avoid legal action by the WWF, Bischoff in a worked interview at The Great American Bash, asked point blank if they worked for the WWF, which both Hall and Nash denied. The Outsiders expanded and became the New World Order (nWo) when perennial fan-favorite Hulk Hogan aligned himself with the Outsiders in July 1996.

The nWo was depicted as a rival company engaging in a &quot;hostile takeover&quot; of WCW. Week to week, the angle grew more complex, with a mixture of main-eventers, mid-carders, executives, referees, managers, and announcers involved in various subplots related to the onscreen &quot;WCW vs nWo&quot; power-struggle. Led by the nWo storyline, WCW overtook the WWF as the number one wrestling promotion in America with &quot;Nitro&quot; defeating &quot;Raw&quot; in the ratings by a wide margin for 83 consecutive weeks. During this era, Bischoff moved from his role as commentator and joined the nWo as a manager. His television character, dubbed &quot;Eazy E&quot; by Hall (&quot;Sleazy E&quot; by the WCW commentators), became a dictator and egomaniac as the nWo boss. In the summer of 1998, Bischoff hosted a &quot;Tonight Show&quot; like segment on WCW programming with Miss Elizabeth. Ted DiBiase has said in shoot interviews that Bischoff originally hired DiBiase to be the spokesperson and financial backer for the nWo, but when the nWo was getting to be a more prominent storyline, Bischoff replaced DiBiase as nWo spokesperson.

====Downfall of WCW (1998–1999)====
When the WWF rebranded their product as &quot;WWF Attitude&quot; and began to focus on new superstars such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Mick Foley, and The Rock, and made owner/longtime announcer Vince McMahon into a character, this eventually resulted in a ratings turnaround for WWF. On April 13, 1998, WWF ended WCW&#x27;s year and a half run on top of the ratings war. Despite losing in the ratings to WWF, WCW continued to post strong ratings, attendance, and PPV buyrates throughout 1998. In 1998, WCW built one of its most popular homegrown superstars in Bill Goldberg, and gave him the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on July 6, 1998, at the Georgia Dome in front of 39,919 people on &quot;Nitro&quot;.

In late 1998 he feuded with Ric Flair. Bischoff defeated Flair at Starrcade (1998) and the next night lost to Flair on Monday Night Nitro.

In early 1999, Bischoff promoted Kevin Nash to head booker. Despite Goldberg drawing at the box office and doing three shows in December and January that did nearly a $1 million gate, the decision was made to end Goldberg&#x27;s undefeated streak and put the belt on Nash. On the January 4 &quot;Nitro&quot;, at the Georgia Dome, Nash dropped the title to Hogan in a match that became known as the Fingerpoke of Doom, and the nWo was rebranded. By March ratings began dropping, and WCW began experiencing an endless streak of ratings losses.

Throughout 1999, Bischoff reverted to focusing on aging WCW stars such as Hogan, Diamond Dallas Page, Randy Savage, Sting, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Nash, Ric Flair, and Sid Vicious. In an effort to improve ratings, WCW also began to focus heavily on several celebrities such as Master P., Chad Brock, Megadeth, Dennis Rodman, and Kiss. One of the last deals Bischoff structured was a deal with the members of the rock band Kiss to have their own wrestling character known as The Kiss Demon.

By late 1999, WCW began losing around $5 million a month. Attendance, PPV buys and ratings were down significantly. On September 10, 1999, the decision was made to relieve Bischoff of power.

====Replacement (1999–2000)====
On September 10, 1999, Bischoff was relieved of his management position with WCW by Turner Sports chief Harvey Schiller. The job title &quot;President of WCW&quot; was eliminated. He was replaced with WCW Vice President of Strategic Planning Bill Busch, who was named Senior Vice President (handling the creative side of the company with Brad Siegel handling the day-to-day operations). One of Busch&#x27;s first acts in charge was the additions of former WWF head writer Vince Russo and his colleague Ed Ferrara (both of whom had worked on &quot;Raw&quot; when the show began to overtake &quot;Nitro&quot; in the ratings) to head up WCW&#x27;s creative direction.

In April 2000, Bischoff returned as an on-air character alongside Russo to lead the heel faction The New Blood; Bischoff also worked on writing the shows with Russo during this time. He defeated Terry Funk for the WCW Hardcore Championship on June 6. Bischoff&#x27;s last on-camera role in WCW was on the June 12, 2000 &quot;Nitro&quot;. He would exit the promotion in July 2000 at Bash at the Beach, when Russo did a worked-shoot promo on Hulk Hogan.

====Attempted purchase of WCW (2001)====
On January 11, 2001, with WCW facing major financial woes, Siegel accepted Bischoff&#x27;s offer to purchase WCW. Bischoff and Fusient briefly withdrew their offer when the WWF made an inquiry on WCW (due to the terms of a settlement, WWF had a right to bid on WCW&#x27;s properties, should they ever be up for liquidation). When then-WWF broadcaster Viacom objected (fearing a WWF-owned show on a competing network), the Bischoff-Fusient consortium signed a new letter of intent.

However, the new head of Turner Broadcasting, Jamie Kellner then canceled all WCW programming due to losing money for several years from its television networks. WCW lost $60 million in 2000 alone. Kellner believed that wrestling did not fit the demographics of either TBS Superstation or TNT and would not be favorable enough to get the &quot;right&quot; advertisers to buy airtime (even though &quot;Thunder&quot; was the highest-rated show on TBS Superstation at the time). In the book &quot;NITRO: The Incredible Rise and Inevitable Collapse of Ted Turner&#x27;s WCW&quot; by Guy Evans, it is said that a key condition in WCW&#x27;s purchase deal with Fusient was that Fusient wanted control over time slots on TNT and TBS networks, regardless of whether these slots would show WCW programming or not. This influenced Kellner&#x27;s decision to ultimately cancel WCW programming. With no network on which to air its programming, WCW was of little value to Fusient, whose offer depended on being able to continue to air WCW programming on the Turner networks. Bischoff stated that &quot;it made absolutely no sense for us to do the deal under those circumstances.&quot; With WCW programming canceled (and Viacom subsequently no longer objecting), WCW&#x27;s key assets (tape library, trademarks, and selected contracts) were purchased by the WWF in March 2001 for a substantially lower price (approximately US$3.5 million) than what had been offered.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2007)===
====General Manager of &quot;Raw&quot; (2002–2005)====

In 2002, Bischoff was hired by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE, formerly WWF) to be the general manager of &quot;Raw&quot;. Although primarily an on-screen role, Bischoff had a wide range of contacts within WWE to whom he could pitch creative ideas. He debuted as the first Raw general manager on the July 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. He resurrected his characteristic brand of smarminess with the general manager position, again playing the arrogant heel character he had employed as the nWo boss in WCW. During his debut on &quot;Raw&quot;, he told the audience about how he was president of WCW, creator of the nWo and how he forced Vince McMahon to change the ways he does business. Bischoff is in second place of the longest reigns as general manager in WWE history, with three years in total. Former rival and former general manager of SmackDown Theodore Long surpassed Bischoff&#x27;s record with a combined number of six years. Bischoff&#x27;s wrestling innovations in WWE included the &quot;Raw Roulette&quot; and the Elimination Chamber, as well as feuds with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shane McMahon, John Cena, SmackDown! general manager Stephanie McMahon, and former Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) owner Paul Heyman. On June 15 at Bad Blood, Bischoff appeared during a segment along with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Mae Young where she stripped herself in the ring and shared a passionate kiss with Eric Bischoff and performed a bronco buster on Bischoff before being stunned by Austin. At Taboo Tuesday, Bischoff had his head shaved after failing to beat his (kayfabe) nephew Eugene. Bischoff then began a face turn after his head got shaved. He favored face wrestlers such as Randy Orton, Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho. Bischoff subsequently took a vacation after allowing Randy Orton&#x27;s team to become general managers for up to four weeks with every member being the general manager once a week.

Bischoff began favoring heels again after then-WWE Champion John Cena, who was drafted to &quot;Raw&quot; in June 2005, refused to participate in Bischoff&#x27;s vendetta against an impending ECW revival. As a result, Bischoff &quot;declared war&quot; on Cena (citing disdain for Cena&#x27;s rapping and &quot;thug nature&quot;) and made wrestlers such as Chris Jericho and Christian try to take away the WWE Championship from Cena. In November, Bischoff aligned himself with Kurt Angle. Following several months of &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot; invasions, Bischoff lost to SmackDown! general manager Theodore Long at Survivor Series after The Boogeyman helped Long beat Bischoff.

On the December 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Bischoff was (kayfabe) &quot;fired&quot; as general manager, when Cena body slammed him and Vince McMahon tossed him into a garbage truck – following a &quot;trial&quot; where his history of unscrupulous actions were listed – and had him driven out of the arena. Bischoff then sat out the remainder of the year and spent the start of 2006 writing a book that would become &quot;Controversy Creates Cash&quot;. Bischoff was against writing a wrestling book initially, as he believes &quot;most are bitter, self-serving revisionist history at best—and monuments to bullshit at their worst.&quot;

====Sporadic appearances and departure (2006–2007)====
On September 25, 2006, Bischoff appeared on WWE television for the first time in close to a year, and after being brought into the ring by Jonathan Coachman, he proceeded to promote his recently finished book &quot;Controversy Creates Cash&quot;, giving a worked shoot on McMahon and WWE. During his segment, Bischoff stated, &quot;Without &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; there would be no &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;...without the nWo there would be no DX...and without Eric Bischoff there would be no Mr. McMahon&quot;. After this statement, Bischoff&#x27;s microphone was immediately cut off, Jonathan Coachman&#x27;s music played and he was escorted from the arena by security.

A few days later John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) conducted a four-part interview with Bischoff, further discussing his book on WWE.com. During the interview, Bischoff discussed various topics, such as his true feelings towards Lex Luger, his thoughts on ECW promoter Paul Heyman, his decision of giving Kevin Nash booking power, and his overall reaction to the Monday Night War. The book was released on October 17, 2006, and became a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller.

Bischoff was chosen as the special guest referee for the D-Generation X (DX) versus Rated-RKO match at Cyber Sunday on November 5, with 60% of the vote. He then cheated DX out of the win, leaving Randy Orton and Edge the victors. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Bischoff was reinstated as General Manager for one night only. During his time as the General Manager on &quot;Raw&quot;, he restarted matches if he did not like the outcome. He also got revenge on Maria for her statement made in his trial the year before by making her face Umaga, forced John Cena to &quot;take the night off,&quot; and banned DX from the building. He restarted the match between Jeff Hardy and Johnny Nitro for the WWE Intercontinental Championship after Hardy won by disqualification. Bischoff restarted that match as a No Disqualification match, and Nitro took advantage of that using Melina to distract Hardy and striking him with the title belt. At the end of the show, DX interfered in the main event when Bischoff tried to help Edge and Randy Orton win the World Tag Team Championship, and forced him to be humiliated by &quot;Big Dick Johnson&quot; as revenge for costing them their match the night before.

On March 5, 2007, Bischoff made a brief appearance on &quot;Raw&quot; in Phoenix, Arizona to give Vince McMahon his thoughts on the WrestleMania 23 match against Donald Trump. In August 2007, Bischoff&#x27;s WWE contract expired. On December 10, 2007, Bischoff appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; for its 15th Anniversary Special, and was confronted by Chris Jericho, the man whom he fired on &quot;Raw&quot; on August 22, 2005.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2010–2014)===
====Immortal (2010–2012)====

In October 2009, Bischoff helped negotiate a deal among Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Hulk Hogan, and himself. According to Bischoff, Hogan gave Bischoff the power to sign contracts on his behalf. He pointed that TNA only wanted Hogan, but Hogan wouldn&#x27;t go to TNA without Bischoff. Bischoff also said that he went with Hogan to oversee his creative. He premiered alongside Hogan on the January 4, 2010, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; as part of an alliance to take over and rebuild the franchise. Behind the scenes, he was also appointed TNA executive producer.
Despite being a heel when dealing with the likes of Jeff Jarrett, Mick Foley and Abyss, Bischoff refereed his first TNA match at Against All Odds, favoring the face challenger Samoa Joe over the heel champion A.J. Styles in a match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, as part of the storyline, Bischoff punched out Styles&#x27; manager Ric Flair, after he interfered in the match, but the distraction led to Styles retaining his belt. On the March 15 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Bischoff attempted to shave Foley bald as a punishment for trying to help Jarrett in a handicap match the previous week, but was shaved bald himself, when Foley turned the tables on him. At Lockdown, Bischoff turned face by helping Team Hogan defeat Team Flair in the Lethal Lockdown match. The next months Bischoff worked with Hogan, Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe against Sting and Kevin Nash, who claimed that they knew that Bischoff and Hogan were up to something. During this time, Abyss turned on Hogan and went on a rampage, which included attacking the TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam to the point that he was forced to vacate the title, all the while claiming that he was controlled by some entity, that was coming to TNA. After he manhandled TNA president Dixie Carter on the October 7 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Bischoff presented Carter with the paperwork that would have Abyss fired after his match with Van Dam at Bound for Glory, which she then proceeded to sign.

At Bound for Glory, Bischoff turned heel with Hogan, as the two of them helped Jeff Hardy win the vacant TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Bischoff, Hogan and Hardy then aligned themselves with Abyss and Jarrett. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; it was revealed that Bischoff had tricked Carter and the paperwork she had signed a week earlier, were not to release Abyss, but to turn the company over to him and Hogan. Meanwhile, Bischoff&#x27;s and Hogan&#x27;s new stable, now known as Immortal, formed an alliance with Flair&#x27;s Fortune stable. On the November 4 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Bischoff took part in his first match in TNA, challenging the concussed Mr. Anderson to earn his shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, only for Matt Morgan to take his spot and beat Bischoff to become the number one contender. Carter returned on the November 25 episode of &quot;Reaction&quot;, informing Hogan and Bischoff that a judge had filed an injunction against the two on her behalf over not having signatory authority, indefinitely suspending Hogan from TNA. On January 31, 2011, at the tapings of the February 3 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Fortune turned on Immortal, explaining that they were not going to let TNA suffer the same fate as WCW. Hogan, having won the court battle against Carter, returned to TNA on the March 3 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, declaring himself as the new owner of the promotion.

However, on the May 12 episode of the newly renamed &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Immortal lost control of the program to Foley, who revealed himself as the Network consultant, and had been causing problems for Immortal ever since Bischoff and Hogan took over the company. However, this angle was aborted just three weeks later, when Foley left the promotion. Also in May, Bischoff declared war on the X Division, after the legitimate firing of Jay Lethal, and on the May 19 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, wrestled his second TNA match, when he teamed with Matt Hardy in a tag team match, where they defeated Generation Me (Jeremy and Max Buck). The storyline concluded on August 11, when the Network gave the division back to the original X Division wrestlers, after the success of Destination X, which saw Immortal&#x27;s Abyss lose the X Division Championship to Brian Kendrick. On October 6, it was reported that Bischoff had signed a contract extension with TNA. On October 16 at Bound for Glory, after losing control of TNA back to Carter, Hogan turned on the rest of Immortal by saving Sting from a beatdown at the hands of its members. Sting had won the match when referee Jackson James, who had earlier in the event been revealed as Bischoff&#x27;s real-life son Garett Bischoff, reluctantly called the ring bell for a submission, which led to Eric hitting his son with a steel chair following the match, starting a rivalry between the two. On April 15, 2012, at Lockdown, Eric and Garett captained opposing teams in the annual Lethal Lockdown match. Garett won the match for his team by pinning Eric, forcing his father out of TNA in the process.

====Backstage roles, lawsuit and departure (2012–2014)====
After Lockdown, Bischoff did not appear on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; and focused on his backstage roles. In October 2013, Bischoff was sent home by TNA to sit out the remainder of his contract, which expired in early 2014. In May 2015, Bischoff, his son Garett, and his business partner Jason Hervey sued TNA for unpaid salary. During an interview in August 2016, when Bischoff was asked what went wrong with TNA he said: &quot;I try to put them both out of my mind so I couldn&#x27;t tell you. No comment. I&#x27;m in the middle of a lawsuit with them so I can&#x27;t really comment.&quot; When asked about positive memories during his time with TNA he stated that he did not have any. In 2019, Bischoff said of his TNA run, &quot;For the most part, it is very regrettable&quot; and &quot;looking back, I wished I wouldn&#x27;t have done it, with one or two exceptions.&quot;

===Sporadic WWE appearances (2016–present)===
Bischoff inducted Diamond Dallas Page into the WWE Hall of Fame. On the 25th Anniversary of &quot;Raw&quot; on January 22, 2018, Bischoff made a guest appearance on the show, during a segment with other former &quot;Raw&quot; general managers and on July 22, 2019, on the &quot;Raw Reunion&quot;.

In June 2019, WWE announced that Bischoff would be the executive director of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, and part of Bischoff&#x27;s role is to act as an intermediary between WWE and Fox executives due to his background in the television industry, but he was replaced on October 15 by Bruce Prichard, and with immediate effect he had left WWE. Bryan Alvarez reported that he heard &quot;zero good things&quot; about Bischoff and that Bischoff did not know the product nor the wrestlers. According to Fox, Bischoff was released since &quot;[s]ignificant promises were made that we don&#x27;t feel were upheld&quot;.

In March 2020, Bischoff reflected on his WWE departure, stating &quot;I knew about six weeks in, eight weeks in, it just wasn&#x27;t going to work out. [...] I knew I wasn&#x27;t fitting and it wasn&#x27;t a secret. [...] It just wasn&#x27;t right. [...] I had to fit in the system and I wasn&#x27;t able to do it in the timeline it needed to be done&quot;. In June 2020, Bischoff further reflected on his departure by saying &quot;it was on me&quot; and backs his profession by blaming his failure to adapt to the new job for why his tenure was so short and described the problem as being more of a &quot;chemistry issue&quot; than anything else. Bischoff also pointed out that he had little creative control over SmackDown but was more of an overseer for Vince, who had the most say in WWE&#x27;s creative direction at the time.

On April 6, 2021, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. He also appeared on the December 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, as the officiator for the renewal of The Miz and Maryse&#x27;s vows, and on the January 21, 2022 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, during a backstage segment with Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville.

Bischoff appeared via a video on the November 26, 2024 episode of NXT to speak to Trick Williams and Ridge Holland. Bischoff appeared live in person on the December 4 episode of NXT, praising the brand and its potential and again talking with Trick Williams and Ridge Holland.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2020–2021) ===
On the August 5, 2020 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Bischoff appeared on TNT for the first time since 2000, when he moderated a debate between Chris Jericho and Orange Cassidy. He referred to his appearance as a cameo and he has not signed with All Elite Wrestling. However, on the October 28 episode, Bischoff would later return to &quot;Dynamite&quot; to ask Jericho and MJF questions during a &quot;town hall meeting&quot;, provoking the two wrestlers and setting up a match at Full Gear. On the March 3, 2021 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, he appeared as part of an Inner Circle press conference. On the May 28 episode, Bischoff returned to &quot;Dynamite&quot; to host a party for the Inner Circle. During the event, members of the Inner Circle were ambushed by MJF and others in The Pinnacle.

==Television production career==
Bischoff, with actor Jason Hervey, ran his own production company, Bischoff Hervey Entertainment, which primarily produced reality TV shows, through 2017. They produced a live &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; pay-per-view event from Florida in 2003 with WWE and another pay-per-view about the Sturgis, South Dakota motorcycle rally in 2004. They also executive produced the VH1 reality shows &quot;Scott Baio Is 45...and Single&quot;, &quot;Scott Baio Is 46...and Pregnant&quot;, &quot;I Want To Be a Hilton&quot;, and &quot;Confessions of a Teen Idol&quot;, along with the CMT show &quot;Billy Ray Cyrus...Home At Last&quot;. Bischoff-Hervey Productions also produced a wrestling reality show called &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Celebrity Championship Wrestling&quot; in which ten celebrities were trained to wrestle and one celebrity is voted off weekly. Bischoff also appeared as one of the &quot;judges&quot; on the show. In November 2009, Bischoff helped produce Hulk Hogan&#x27;s tour to Australia. Bischoff, also had a show in development with Food Network called &quot;Food Fight&quot; where pro wrestlers take on celebrity chefs in cooking and then tag-team with them in a wrestling match. In January 2013, Bischoff and Hervey produced the television series &quot;Hardcore Pawn: Chicago&quot;.

==Video game production career==
In 2013, along with partners Jason Hervey and Ike McFadden, Bischoff formed the online gaming company MX Digital. The company develops and distributes online and mobile celebrity-themed games in Europe and North America. Among the company&#x27;s first released games were &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Hulkamania&quot;, which debuted on SkyVegas in November 2012. Their next game, &quot;The Hoff&quot;, featuring actor-singer David Hasselhoff, was released widely in Europe in February 2013.

In early 2014, his online-gaming company announced a deal with actor Dan Aykroyd to launch a Blues Brothers online casino game in Europe. Later that year, MX Digital launched their games on Facebook, under the moniker &quot;MX Casino&quot;. Slot-machine-style games playable upon launch as a Facebook app included &quot;socialized&quot; versions of &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Hulkamania&quot;, as well as a similarly Facebook-friendly version of &quot;The Hoff&quot;. Also debuting in October of that year were a batch of new celebrity-themed games, this time starring the likes of Dennis Rodman, James Dean and Chuck Norris.

==Personal life==
Bischoff currently resides in Cody, Wyoming with his wife, Loree (married since 1984). Bischoff has previously lived in Scottsdale, Arizona; Stamford, Connecticut; and Los Angeles, California. He has two children: son Garett (born April 20, 1984); and daughter Montanna (born November 7, 1985). Garett, under the ring name Jackson James, made his debut for TNA Wrestling on November 7, 2010, as a referee at Turning Point, before later becoming a wrestler under his real name.

On May 5, 2011, Eric Bischoff announced that he was starting a brewing company in Cody, Wyoming. Their first beverage, called Buffalo Bill Cody Beer, featured the tag line &quot;The Spirit of the Wild West&quot;.

On July 27, 2016, Bischoff premiered his first podcast show, &quot;Bischoff on Wrestling&quot;, on MLW Radio. After October 17, 2017, he quit the show due to being shortchanged on money. In April 2018, Bischoff returned to podcasting with &quot;83 Weeks with Eric Bischoff&quot; alongside co-host, Conrad Thompson.

Bischoff is a longtime fan of Vermont-based jamband Phish and collects live recordings of their concerts.

==Legacy==
Bischoff is one of the most polarizing and controversial figures in professional wrestling history. He was instrumental in the creation of the New World Order, which played a major role in WCW&#x27;s success and peak during the Monday Night War. Mike Johnson of &quot;Pro Wrestling Insider&quot; wrote: &quot;His place in history is this and it will always be this - he&#x27;s the only person to come along and kick Vince McMahon hard enough that he forced WWF&#x27;s product to evolve and get better. No matter whether he won the ratings for 83 weeks or one week, his legacy is that he made pro wrestling change for the better in the mid-1990s.&quot; However, R.D. Reynolds and Bryan Alvarez, the authors of the book titled &quot;The Death of WCW&quot;, were critical of many of the decisions Bischoff made as head of WCW and believe that he contributed to the decline of WCW. Despite their criticisms, Reynolds attributes the death of WCW to have been the result of decisions made by Jamie Kellner.

Although critical of the time that they spent working together in WCW and TNA, Vince Russo said Bischoff has &quot;contributed [to professional wrestling] in a tremendous way ... dating all the way back to his early days at the AWA&quot;. AEW promoter Tony Khan credits Bischoff with paving the way for his promotion, stating: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be here and there would not be an AEW without [Bischoff] and there would not be wrestling on TNT right now without [him].&quot; WWE describes Bischoff as a &quot;pioneer behind the scenes in sports-entertainment, as well as an incredibly entertaining performer in front of the camera&quot;, further stating that he achieved &quot;success everywhere he went in the business&quot;.

<text>James Henderson Berry (May 15, 1841 – January 30, 1913) was a United States Senator and served as the 14th governor of Arkansas. He also served as Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives.

==Early life==

James Henderson Berry was born in Jackson County, Alabama, to Isabella Jane (née Orr) and James McFerrin Berry. The family moved to Arkansas in 1848. Berry attended Berryville Academy in Berryville, Arkansas, for one year. The academy was named after his family. Berry studied law and in 1866 was admitted to the Arkansas bar.

==American Civil War==
At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Berry joined the Confederate States Army and was commissioned as a second lieutenant with Company E, 16th Arkansas Infantry. Berry lost his right leg during the Battle of Corinth in northern Mississippi. After recuperating from his wound, he worked as a school teacher and started a private law practice.

==Political career==
Berry was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives in 1866. He was reelected in 1872 and in 1874. In his last term he was selected to be Speaker of the House after holding the position during the Brooks–Baxter War in place of Charles W. Tankersley. Berry was the chairman of the Democratic State Convention in 1876. In 1878 he became a judge for the Fourth Circuit Court and served in that post until 1882 when he was elected Governor of Arkansas. The Berry administration focused on reducing the state debt and creating a state mental hospital. Berry did not run for reelection. In March 1885, Berry was selected by the legislature to fill the unexpired term of Senator Augustus H. Garland. Berry remained in the U.S. Senate for the next 22 years.

==Later life==
In 1910, Berry accepted a position with the Arkansas History Commission to mark the graves of all Arkansas Confederate soldiers who had died in northern prisons. Berry died in Bentonville, Arkansas, and is buried at the Knights of Pythias Cemetery (present-day Bentonville Cemetery), Bentonville, Arkansas.

==Personal life==
In 1865, Berry married E.Q. &quot;Lizzie&quot; Quaile. They had six children.

<doc id="304091" wikidata="Q425902" url="?curid=304091" title="Annatto">
<text>Annatto ( or ) is an orange-red condiment and food coloring derived from the seeds of the achiote tree (&quot;Bixa orellana&quot;), native to tropical parts of the Americas. It is often used to impart a yellow to red-orange color to foods, but sometimes also for its flavor and aroma. Its scent is described as &quot;slightly peppery with a hint of nutmeg&quot; and its flavor as &quot;slightly nutty, sweet, and peppery&quot;.

The color of annatto comes from various carotenoid pigments, mainly bixin and norbixin, found in the reddish waxy coating of the seeds. The condiment is typically prepared by grinding the seeds to a powder or paste. Similar effects can be obtained by extracting some of the color and flavor principles from the seeds with hot water, oil, or lard, which are then added to the food.

Annatto and its extracts are now widely used in an artisanal or industrial scale as a coloring agent in many processed food products, such as cheeses, dairy spreads, butter and margarine, custards, cakes and other baked goods, potatoes, snack foods, breakfast cereals, smoked fish, sausages, and more. In these uses, annatto is a natural alternative to synthetic food coloring compounds, but it has been linked to rare cases of food-related allergies. Annatto is of particular commercial value in the United States because the Food and Drug Administration considers colorants derived from it to be &quot;exempt of certification&quot;.

== History ==

The annatto tree &quot;B. orellana&quot; is believed to originate in tropical regions from Mexico to Brazil. It was probably not initially used as a food additive, but for other purposes, such as ritual and decorative body painting (still an important tradition in many Brazilian native tribes, such as the Wari&#x27;); sunscreen; insect repellent; and for medical purposes. It was used for Mexican manuscript painting in the 16th century. Men of the Tsàchila tribe in Ecuador are highly recognizable thanks to their traditional bright orange hair, which is achieved by using crushed seeds of annatto. It is believed they have been doing so for centuries.

Annatto has been traditionally used as both a coloring and flavoring agent in various cuisines from Latin America, the Caribbean, the Philippines, and other countries where it was taken home by Spanish and Portuguese colonizers in the 16th century. It has various local names according to region. Its use has spread in historic times to other parts of the world, and it was incorporated in local culinary traditions of many countries outside the Americas.

== Culinary uses ==

=== Traditional cuisine ===
Ground annatto seeds, often mixed with other seeds or spices, are used in the form of paste or powder for culinary use, especially in Latin American, Jamaican, Belizean, Chamorro, Vietnamese, and Filipino cuisines. In Mexican and Belizean cuisines, it is used to make the spice &quot;recado rojo&quot;. In Venezuela, annatto is used in the preparation of &quot;hallacas, huevos pericos&quot;, and other traditional dishes. In Puerto Rico, it is often simmered in oil or ground with seasonings and herbs to make &quot;sazón&quot; or used to make &quot;pasteles&quot;, &quot;arroz con gandules&quot;, and several other dishes, where it is one of the main ingredients. Annatto paste is an important ingredient of &quot;cochinita pibil&quot;, the slow-roasted pork dish popular in Mexico. It is also a key ingredient in the drink &quot;tascalate&quot; from Chiapas, Mexico. In the Philippines, it is used for the sauce of &quot;pancit palabok&quot;. In Guam, it is used to make a staple rice dish flavored with annatto, onion, garlic, butter, and other spices.

In earlier times, the seeds of the plant were also used as a staple food in South and Central America. Today, an Inca recipe for beer made from cocoa, chilli, honey and annatto is available again. The recipe dates back to 1200 BC and is now marketed in North America under the trade name Dogfish Head Theobroma. In the prehistory and early history of South and Central America, the pure, soaked annatto seed was fermented with 5% honey for 10 days and sometimes used as a sole foodstuff. The continent&#x27;s universities have now recognised the high nutrient content of the seed and are researching ways to reintroduce annatto as a foodstuff. However, practical solutions that would guarantee a basic food supply from the wild harvest have not yet been taken up again by the population.

=== Industrial food coloring ===

Annatto is commonly used to impart a yellow or orange color to many industrialized and semi-industrialized foods, including cheese, ice cream, bakery products, desserts, fruit fillings, yogurt, butter, oils, margarines, processed cheese, and fat-based products. In the United States, annatto extract is listed as a color additive &quot;exempt from certification&quot; and is informally considered to be a natural coloring. Foods colored with annatto may declare the coloring in the statement of ingredients as &quot;colored with annatto&quot; or &quot;annatto color&quot;. In the European Union, it is identified by the E number E160b.

==== Cheese ====
In cheese, the yellow and orange hues naturally vary throughout the year as the cow&#x27;s feed changes: in the summer, with fresh grass and its natural carotene content, the milk produced would have a natural orange tint, as would the cheese made from it, while at other times of the year, the tint would be greatly reduced. As the pigment is carried in the cream, skimming the milk, which some farmers did to make butter or to sell it separately, the lesser-quality cheese from such milk would be white.

To fool the consumer, the cheesemakers introduced colorants to imitate the more intense colors of the finer summer cheese. Initially these colors came from saffron, marigold, and carrot juice, but later annatto began being used.

In the 17th century, the Dutch, who had established colonies in Guyana, traded in food, particularly an orange-red natural colorant, annatto, with the indigenous communities. Zeeland traders under the authority of the West India Company bought annatto from the inhabitants of the coastal regions of Guyana and Suriname and sold it in the Netherlands as &quot;verw&quot; (&#x27;paint&#x27;). One contemporaneous description comes from Adriaen van Berkel, in a book published in 1695, though he does not mention whether it was used in cheese.

The earliest known documentation of annatto&#x27;s use in cheese is in a 1743 Dutch volume (&quot;Household Dictionary&quot;), according to American scientist Paul Kindstedt of the University of Vermont. Other historical documents from the period confirm that annatto (then called &quot;orleaan&quot; or &quot;orleans&quot;) was being used to color cheese by the mid-18th century.

England is another country that has used annatto to color its cheeses; colorants have been added to Gloucester cheese as early as the 16th century to allow inferior cheese to masquerade as the best Double Gloucester, with annatto later being used for that purpose. This usage was subsequently adopted in other parts of the UK, for cheeses such as Cheshire and Red Leicester, as well as colored Cheddar made in Scotland. Many cheddars are produced in both white and red (orange) varieties, the only difference between the two being the presence of annatto as a coloring. That practice has extended to many modern processed cheese products, such as American cheese and Velveeta. Cheeses from other countries also use annatto, including Mimolette from France and Leyden from the Netherlands.

Cheeses that use annatto in at least some preparations include:
== Chemical composition ==
The yellow to orange color is produced by the chemical compounds bixin and norbixin, which are classified as carotenoids. The fat-soluble color in the crude extract is called bixin, which can then be saponified into water-soluble norbixin. This dual solubility property of annatto is rare for carotenoids. The seeds contain 4.5–5.5% pigment, which consists of 70–80% bixin. Unlike beta-carotene, another well-known carotenoid, annatto-based pigments are not vitamin A precursors. The more norbixin in an annatto preparation, the more yellow it is; a higher level of bixin gives it a more orange hue.

== Safety ==
Annatto condiments and colorants are safe for most people when used in food amounts, but they may cause allergic reactions in those who are sensitive. In one 1978 study of 61 patients with chronic hives or angioedema, 56 patients were orally provoked by annatto extract during an elimination diet. A challenge was performed with a dose equivalent to the amount used in of butter. Twenty-six percent of the patients reacted to this color four hours after intake, worse than synthetic dyes, such as amaranth (9%), tartrazine (11%), sunset yellow FCF (17%), allura red AC (16%), ponceau 4R (15%), erythrosine (12%) and brilliant blue FCF (14%).

Annatto is not among the &quot;Big Eight&quot; substances causing hypersensitivity reactions which are responsible for more than 90% of food related allergic reactions. The US FDA and experts at the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP) of the University of Nebraska do not include annatto in the list of major food allergens.

<text>Ozra (or Ozro) Amander Hadley (June 30, 1826 – July 18, 1915) was an American politician who served as the acting governor of Arkansas from 1871 to 1873. He also served in the Arkansas Senate. A Republican, he was from New York and became a farmer in Minnesota. He also served in local government before moving to Arkansas and opening a general store. After his political career he served in the U.S. Land Office in Little Rock and as a postmaster.

==Early life and education==
Hadley was born in Cherry Creek, New York, and was educated in the public schools. He attended Fredonia Academy, now State University of New York at Fredonia. Hadley moved to Rochester, Minnesota in 1855, where he was a farmer and became active in local politics and government, including appointment as Olmsted County Auditor. In 1865, he moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, where he opened a general store.

==Political career==
Hadley was elected as a Republican to serve in the Arkansas Senate from 1869 to 1871; he was elected president of the Senate in 1871. In 1871, as part of a political compromise (&quot;see: Brooks-Baxter War&quot;), Hadley was appointed acting governor after the resignation of his fellow Republican, Powell Clayton, a controversial figure associated with the Brooks-Baxter War. During his two-year term, Hadley sided with the Radical Republicans during the Reconstruction Era, including efforts to assist former slaves to obtain schooling, own land, vote, and hold office.

During a period of political and civil troubles that came to be called the Pope County Militia War, Major General D. P. Upham was sent by Hadley to provide aid in Pope County &quot;as is or may be necessary to execute the civil and criminal law of the state.&quot; The orders gave Upham discretionary power in the use of force and the power to call state guards and enrolled militia into service. Some state guards were utilized in the county during voter registration and the November general election but were dismissed to return home after the election.

After his gubernatorial term, Hadley served as registrar of the U.S. Land Office. He was appointed as Little Rock&#x27;s postmaster in 1878, and served until 1882.

==Later life==
In his later years, Hadley moved to Watrous, Mora County, New Mexico, where he developed a ranch. He died in Watrous in 1915.

<doc id="304097" wikidata="Q207184" url="?curid=304097" title="Press release">
<text>A press release (also known as a media release) is an official statement delivered to members of the news media for the purpose of providing new information, creating an official statement, or making an announcement directed for public release. Press releases are also considered a primary source, meaning they are original informants for information. A press release is traditionally composed of nine structural elements, including a headline, dateline, introduction, body, and other components. Press releases are typically delivered to news media electronically, ready to use, and sometimes subject to &quot;do not use before&quot; time, known as a news embargo.

A special example of a press release is a communiqué (; ), which is a brief report or statement released by a public agency. A communiqué is typically issued after a high-level meeting of international leaders.

Using press releases can benefit media corporations because they can contribute to reducing costs and improve the amount of material a media firm can output in a certain amount of time. Due to the material being pre-packaged, press releases save journalists time, not only in writing a story, but also the time and money it would have taken to capture the news firsthand.

Although using a press release can save a news outlet time and money, it constrains the format and style of its content. In addition, press releases can be favorable towards the organization that commissioned or issued them, framing the topic according to its preferred criteria. In the digital age, consumers generally want to receive information instantly, bringing about pressure on the news media to output information fast with less time for editing and fact-checking. This may cause news media companies to heavily rely on press releases to create stories.

==Elements==

Any information deliberately sent to a reporter or media source is considered a press release. This information is released by the act of being sent to the media. Public relations professionals often follow a standard professional format for press releases. Additional communication methods that journalists employ include pitch letters and media advisories. Generally, a press release body consists of four to five paragraphs with a word limit ranging from 400 to 500. However, press release length varies and can range from 300 to 800 words.

Common structural elements include:
* Letterhead or Logo
* Media Contact Information – name, phone number, email address, mailing address, or other contact information for the public relation (PR) or other media relations contact person.
* Headline – used to grab the attention of journalists and briefly summarize the news in one to six words. 
* Dek – a sub-headline that describes the headline in more detail.
* Dateline – contains the release date and usually the originating city of the press release. If the date listed is after the date that the information was actually sent to the media, then the sender is requesting a news embargo.
* Introduction – first paragraph in a press release, that generally gives basic answers to the questions of who, what, when, where and why.
* Body – further explanation, statistics, background, or other details relevant to the news.
* Boilerplate – generally a short &quot;about&quot; section, providing independent background on the issuing company, organization, or individual.
* Close – in North America, traditionally the symbol &quot;-30-&quot; appears after the boilerplate or body and before the media contact information, indicating to media that the release has ended. A more modern equivalent has been the &quot;###&quot; symbol. In other countries, other means of indicating the end of the release may be used, such as the text &quot;ends&quot;.

As the Internet has assumed growing prominence in the 24-hour news cycle, press release writing styles have evolved. Editors of online newsletters, for instance, often lack the staff to convert traditional press release prose into the print-ready copy.

==Distribution models==
In the traditional distribution model, the business, political campaign, or other entity releasing information to the media hires a publicity agency to write and distribute written information to the newswires. The newswire then scatters the information as it is received or as investigated by a journalist. Thus, resulting in the information or announcement becoming public knowledge.

An alternative model is the &quot;self-distributed press release&quot;. In this approach, press releases are either sent directly to local newspapers or to free and paid distribution services. The distribution service then provides the content, as-is, to their media outlets for publication which is usually communicated via online. This approach is often used by political institutions, for example. Another instance would be, Constitutional Courts in Europe, U.S. Supreme Court, and the U.S. State Supreme Courts issue press releases about their own decisions and the news media use these self-published releases for their reporting. 

===Video===
Some public relations firms send out video news releases (VNRs) which are pre-taped video programs or clips that can be aired intact by TV stations.

Video news releases may include interviews of movie-stars. These interviews, which have been taped on a set, are located at the movie studio and decorated with the movie&#x27;s logo.

Video news releases can be in the form of full-blown productions as well. This costs tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to be produced. Video news releases can also be in the format of TV news, or even produced specifically for the web.

Some broadcast news outlets have discouraged the use of video news releases because of citing a poor public perception. It could also be viewed as a desire to increase their credibility.

Furthermore, VNRs can be turned into podcasts and then posted onto newswires. A story can also be kept running longer by simply engaging &quot;community websites&quot;. &quot;Community websites&quot; are monitored and commented on by many journalists and feature writers.

==Embargoes==
If a press release is distributed before the information is intended to be released to the public it is considered embargoed. An embargo requests that news organizations not report the story until a specified date or time.

Unless the journalist has signed a legally binding non-disclosure agreement agreeing to honor the embargo in advance, the journalist has no legal obligation to withhold the information. However, violating the embargo risks damaging their relationship with the issuing organization and their reputation as a writer or journalist. News organizations are sometimes blacklisted after breaking an embargo. Publicists are often encouraged to only share embargoed information with journalists they have an established relationship with and/or are willing to commit to withholding the information until a predesignated time. 

== History ==
Ivy Lee, known as the father of modern public relations, made the first press release in October 1906 about a railroad accident involving the Pennsylvania Railroad. The accident caused the death of fifty people in Atlantic City, New Jersey (known as the Atlantic City train wreck). Lee documented the accident and gave out reports to fellow reporters. The biggest turning point was the honesty that Lee wrote regarding the accident and how truthful it was. &quot;The New York Times&quot; distributed his exact statement and observations. 

Due to Lee&#x27;s influence, press releases have evolved into a necessity for key details among companies to disclose to the public. Since then, press releases have been used to inform other journalists, PR&#x27;s, and other media relation people of important events, statistics, and announcements.

<doc id="304101" wikidata="Q1051088" url="?curid=304101" title="Commissioner of Baseball">
<text>The commissioner of baseball is the chief executive officer of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the associated Minor League Baseball (MiLB) – a constellation of leagues and clubs known as &quot;organized baseball&quot;. Under the direction of the commissioner, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball hires and maintains the sport&#x27;s umpiring crews, and negotiates marketing, labor, and television contracts. The commissioner is chosen by a vote of the owners of the teams. The incumbent MLB commissioner is Rob Manfred, who assumed office on January 25, 2015.

== Origin of the office ==

The title &quot;commissioner&quot;, which is a title that is now applied to the heads of several other major sports leagues as well as baseball, derives from its predecessor office, the National Baseball Commission, the ruling body of professional baseball starting with the National Agreement of 1903, which created unity between both the National League and the American League. The agreement consisted of three members: the two league presidents and a commission chairman, whose primary responsibilities were to preside at meetings and to mediate disputes. Although Cincinnati Reds president August Herrmann served as commission chairman and as such was the nominal head of major league baseball, it was the American League president Ban Johnson who dominated the commission.

The event that would eventually lead to the appointment of a single commissioner of baseball was the Black Sox Scandal – perhaps the worst of a series of incidents in the late 1910s that jeopardized the integrity of the game of baseball. However, the desire to rebuild public relations was not the only motivation behind the creation of the commissioner&#x27;s office. The scandal had not only tarnished the image of baseball, but it had brought relations between team owners and American League president Johnson to a boiling point. In particular, Chicago White Sox owner Charles Comiskey was piqued and incensed at what he perceived to be the indifference of the commission members (especially Johnson) to his suspicions that the 1919 World Series had been thrown to Herrmann&#x27;s Reds. Meanwhile, the commission came under pressure to remove Herrmann from his post due to anti-German sentiment following U.S. entry into World War I.

At the end of the 1920 season, the National League, whose owners had never been on good terms with Johnson, agreed to invite the White Sox along with the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees to join their league. The National League also unveiled plans to put a twelfth team in Cleveland or Detroit. With the American League&#x27;s status as a major league (and possibly its very existence) suddenly in jeopardy, the five American League owners loyal to Johnson sued for peace. Eventually, at the urging of Detroit Tigers owner and Johnson loyalist Frank Navin, a compromise was reached in late 1920 to reform the National Commission with a membership of non-baseball men.

== Overview of commissioners ==

=== Kenesaw Mountain Landis (1920–1944) ===

Having agreed to appoint only non-baseball men to the National Commission, the owners tapped federal judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, an ardent baseball fan, to serve as the reformed commission&#x27;s chairman. Landis responded by declaring that he would only accept an appointment as sole commissioner, with nearly unlimited authority to act in the &quot;best interests of baseball&quot; – in essence, serving as an arbitrator whose decisions could not be appealed. Finally, Landis insisted on a lifetime contract. The owners, still reeling from the perception that the sport was crooked, readily agreed.

==== Gambling ====
Landis&#x27;s first significant act was to deal with the Black Sox scandal. Following a trial, the eight players suspected of involvement in the fix were acquitted. Nevertheless, immediately following the players&#x27; acquittal, Landis banned them all from baseball for life. He famously declared, &quot;Regardless of the verdict of juries, no player who throws a ballgame, no player that undertakes or promises to throw a ballgame, no player that sits in conference with a bunch of crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing a game are discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball.&quot; Landis explained that even though the players had all been acquitted in court, there was no dispute that they had broken the rules of baseball. Therefore, he maintained that none of them could be allowed back in the game if its image was to be restored with the public. Among those banned were Buck Weaver and superstar Shoeless Joe Jackson, who have generally been viewed to be far less culpable compared to the other six accused. Landis&#x27; position was that he had no doubt that Weaver and Jackson at the very least knew about the fix, and failed to report it, and that this alone was grounds for permanent banishment.

Over the years, he dealt harshly with others proven to have thrown individual games, consorted with gamblers, or engaged in actions that he felt tarnished the image of the game. Among the others he banned were New York Giants players Phil Douglas and Jimmy O&#x27;Connell, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Gene Paulette, Giants coach Cozy Dolan, and (in 1943) Phillies owner William D. Cox. He also formalized the unofficial banishments of Hal Chase and Heinie Zimmerman. In 1921, he banned Giants center fielder Benny Kauff even though he had been acquitted of involvement in a car theft ring. Nonetheless, Landis was convinced Kauff was guilty and argued that players of &quot;undesirable reputation and character&quot; had no place in baseball.

==== An independent commissioner&#x27;s office ====
The owners had initially assumed that Landis would deal with the Black Sox Scandal and then settle into a comfortable retirement as the titular head of baseball. Instead, Landis ruled baseball with an iron hand for the next 25 years. He established a fiercely independent commissioner&#x27;s office that would go on to often make both players and owners miserable with decisions that he argued were in the best interests of the game. He worked to clean up the hooliganism that was tarnishing the reputation of players in the 1920s. Without a union to represent them, the players had no meaningful recourse to challenge Landis&#x27; virtually unchecked authority. On the other hand, Landis inserted his office into negotiations with players, where he deemed appropriate, to put an end to a few of the more egregious labor practices that had contributed to the players&#x27; discontent. He also personally approved broadcasters for the World Series.

Landis&#x27;s only significant rival in the early years was longtime American League founder and president Ban Johnson, who had been reckoned as the most powerful man in the game before Landis&#x27;s arrival. Johnson was as strong-willed as Landis, and a clash between the two was inevitable. It happened in the 1924 World Series. When several Giants were implicated in a plan to bribe players on the moribund Phillies late in the season, Johnson demanded that the Series be canceled, and loudly criticized Landis&#x27;s handling of the affair, to which Landis responded by threatening to resign. The American League owners promised to throw Johnson out of office if he stepped out of line again. Two years later, when Johnson criticized Landis&#x27;s decision to give Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker an amnesty after it surfaced they had bet on a fixed game in 1919, Landis told the American League owners to choose between him and Johnson. The owners promptly sent Johnson on a sabbatical from which he never really returned.

==== The baseball color line ====
Landis perpetuated the color line and prolonged the segregation of organized baseball. His successor, Happy Chandler, said, &quot;For twenty-four years Judge Landis wouldn&#x27;t let a black man play. I had his records, and I read them, and for twenty-four years Landis consistently blocked any attempts to put blacks and whites together on a big league field.&quot; Bill Veeck claimed Landis prevented him from purchasing the Phillies when Landis learned of Veeck&#x27;s plan to integrate the team. The signing of the first black ballplayer in the modern era, Jackie Robinson, came less than a year after Landis&#x27;s death on Chandler&#x27;s watch and was engineered by one of Landis&#x27;s old nemeses, Branch Rickey. Eleven weeks after Robinson&#x27;s debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Veeck became the first American League owner to break the color line.

==== Curbing the growth of minor league farm systems ====
Landis tried to curb the growth of minor league farm systems by innovators such as Rickey, in the name of protecting the lower levels of professional ball. Landis argued that because a parent club could unilaterally call up players from teams that were involved in pennant races, the organization was unfairly interfering with the minor competitions. His position was that the championship of each minor league was of no less importance than the championships of the major leagues and that minor league fans and supporters had the right to see their teams competing as best they could. On the other hand, the decisive factor resulting in the eventual entrenchment of the modern farm system was not Landis&#x27; demise but rather the growing presence of MLB on television, which caused attendances in the minor leagues to collapse and left these clubs in a precarious financial position that would have made Landis&#x27; position untenable in any case.

Moreover, Landis prevented the formation of a powerful third major league when he stopped Pants Rowland from upgrading the Pacific Coast League in the 1940s. Furthermore, (and despite the fact that, insofar as he was accountable at all, it was strictly to major league owners) Landis did not hesitate to aggressively use the powers of his office to force the minor leagues and their clubs to submit to his authority in a number of ways. Most notably, he uncompromisingly held to a policy that dictated any minor league player who knowingly played with or against a player banned by Major League Baseball would himself be banned from MLB for life. This threat effectively compelled every minor league to rigidly honor and enforce suspensions handed down by Landis in their competitions as well. Nevertheless, some players banned by Landis are believed to have continued playing under assumed identities at the minor league or semi-professional level.

One of the schemes Landis vigorously fought was the effort by major-league teams to &quot;cover up&quot; players they were hiding in their farm systems. The term, not used in formal communications by the league or team officials, referred to players clandestinely signed by a major-league team to a minor-league contract. Occasionally one team would serendipitously find such a player in the off-season draft, as in this occasion recorded in the book &quot;Dodger Daze and Knights&quot;:
All the clubowners and managers, and Commissioner Landis, were assembled to conduct the draft. One team representative said he &quot;claim[s] Player [Paul] Richards of Brooklyn&quot;.

&quot;You can&#x27;t do that!&quot; barked a surprised Wilbert Robinson, manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Landis.

&quot;Because Brooklyn has him covered up&quot;, sputtered Robbie.

Most of the others broke down laughing. Even Landis smirked.
==== Legacy and honors ====
Whether his decisions were praised or criticized, he was satisfied with being respected and feared. Dubbed &quot;the baseball tyrant&quot; by journalists of the day, his rule was absolute. In the context of ensuring the integrity of the game itself, baseball historians generally regard him as the right man at the right time when appointed, but also as a man who perhaps held office too long.

He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1944, in a special election held one month after his death, and the Most Valuable Player Award in each league was officially known as the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Award in his honor until 2020, following complaints from past MVP winners about Landis&#x27;s role in stonewalling racial integration.

=== Happy Chandler (1945–1951) ===

When Judge Landis died in 1944, an official in the War Department began campaigning for Senator Happy Chandler&#x27;s election to the post. Despite being the last candidate put forth in the April 1945 meetings, he was elected by a unanimous vote of the team owners, and resigned his Senate seat in October of that year.

Chandler clashed with Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo &quot;the Lip&quot; Durocher over Durocher&#x27;s association with gambling figures and his marriage to actress Laraine Day, which came amid allegations from Day&#x27;s ex-husband that Durocher had stolen her away from him. Before the start of the 1947 season, Chandler suspended Durocher for the entire season, citing &quot;conduct detrimental to baseball&quot;. The Dodgers went on to win the pennant that season under replacement manager Burt Shotton.

Chandler became known as &quot;the players&#x27; commissioner&quot; for his work on their behalf. During his service, he presided over the establishment of a pension fund for players and oversaw the initial steps toward integration of the major leagues, beginning with the debut of Jackie Robinson with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. This move was controversial with team owners, who voted 15–1 against integrating the sport in a secret January 1947 meeting. The Dodgers&#x27; Branch Rickey met with Chandler, who agreed to back the team&#x27;s move. Chandler&#x27;s stance was credited by many in the sports community with Chandler&#x27;s failure to be selected for another term as commissioner after the expiration of his first one in 1951.

Chandler was fully aware that he was jeopardizing his own commissionership by stewarding the integration process. Chandler&#x27;s attitude was a simple one, which he conveyed to Branch Rickey, and later recounted in his autobiography:I&#x27;ve already done a lot of thinking about this whole racial situation in our country. As a member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, I got to know a lot about our casualties during the war. Plenty of Negro boys were willing to go out and fight and die for this country. Is it right when they came back to tell them they can&#x27;t play the national pastime? You know, Branch, I&#x27;m going to have to meet my Maker some day. And if He asks me why I didn&#x27;t let this boy play, and I say it&#x27;s because he&#x27;s black, that might not be a satisfactory answer.

If the Lord made some people black, and some white, and some red or yellow, he must have had a pretty good reason. It isn&#x27;t my job to decide which colors can play big league baseball. It is my job to see that the game is fairly played and that everybody has an equal chance. I think if I do that, I can face my Maker with a clear conscience.

=== Ford Frick (1951–1965) ===

In , National League president Ford Frick succeeded Happy Chandler as commissioner of baseball. Frick&#x27;s critics accused him of favoring the National League in his rulings, such as how the 1960s expansion teams would be stocked.

Frick&#x27;s most well-known statement as commissioner was made in 1961 when several players were on a pace to break Babe Ruth&#x27;s single-season home run record. In a press conference, Frick stated that the single-season home run record should be separated into multiple lists, based on the length of a season. (Frick has at times been credited with the saying that there should be an asterisk to differentiate between the two records, but this was actually first suggested by &quot;New York Daily News&quot; writer Dick Young). However, as MLB did not publish an official record book at the time, Frick had no control over how publishers presented MLB records, and within a few years after Roger Maris broke Ruth&#x27;s record, all record books gave Maris sole credit as the single-season home run record holder.

Later, it was revealed that Frick had served as a ghostwriter for Ruth earlier in his career.

Although Frick did not initially express strong opposition to the establishment of the Continental League, a proposed third major league, he quietly encouraged the established Major League owners to offer franchises to several markets in which the proposed league planned to play through expansion and relocation. In doing so, he successfully caused the Continental League to fold without ever playing a game.

=== William Eckert (1965–1968) ===

More than 150 names appeared on the original list of nominees for the commissionership following Ford Frick&#x27;s retirement. The club owners initially were unable to decide if the next commissioner should come from within the ranks of the game as Frick had, or from elsewhere like Frick&#x27;s two predecessors had. They finally decided that the new commissioner should have a strong business background to deal with the problems that were confronting the game at the time.

Retired US Army LTG William Eckert became a serious candidate for the commissionership only after fellow general officer Curtis LeMay gave Major League Baseball a recommendation for him. On November 17, 1965, by a unanimous vote of the then-20 major league club owners, William Eckert became the fourth commissioner of Major League Baseball.

When he became commissioner, Eckert had not seen a game in person in over 10 years. He was a compromise choice for the job, previously being so obscure that sportswriters nicknamed him &quot;the Unknown Soldier&quot;.

During the 1968 season, Eckert incurred the public&#x27;s ire by refusing to cancel exhibition games after the April assassination of Martin Luther King nor regular-season games after the June assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, while also incurring team owners&#x27; disdain because he refused to deal forcefully with substantive business issues. Anticipating a players&#x27; strike and having no ownership confidence in his ability to handle the situation, Eckert was forced to resign at the end of the 1968 season, although he still had three years on his contract.

In spite of his much-publicized failures and shortcomings, William Eckert also developed more effective committee actions, streamlined business methods, and helped stabilize franchises with bigger stadiums and long-term leases. In addition, Eckert worked hard toward promoting the game internationally, including a 1966 post-World Series tour of Japan by the National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers.

=== Bowie Kuhn (1969–1984) ===

Bowie Kuhn&#x27;s tenure was marked by labor strikes (most notably in 1981), owner disenchantment, and the end of baseball&#x27;s reserve clause, yet baseball enjoyed unprecedented attendance gains (from 23 million in to 45.5 million in ) and television contracts during the same time frame.

Kuhn suspended numerous players for involvement with drugs and gambling, and took a strong stance against any activity that he perceived to be &quot;not in the best interests of baseball&quot;.

In , he suspended star Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain indefinitely (the suspension was later set at 3 months) due to McLain&#x27;s involvement in a bookmaking operation, and later suspended McLain for the rest of the season for carrying a gun. Among his more controversial decisions was to bar both Willie Mays (in ) and Mickey Mantle (in ) from the sport due to their involvement in casino promotion. Neither was directly involved in gambling, moreover the casinos they worked for did not even offer sports betting, let alone betting on baseball (this was not legalized in New Jersey until 2012). Mays and Mantle were reinstated by Kuhn&#x27;s successor Peter Ueberroth in .

Also in 1970, Kuhn described Jim Bouton&#x27;s &quot;Ball Four&quot; as &quot;detrimental to baseball&quot; and demanded that Bouton retract it. The book has been republished several times and is now considered a classic.

On October 13, , the World Series held a night game for the first time. Kuhn, who thought that baseball could attract a larger audience by featuring a prime time telecast (as opposed to a mid-afternoon broadcast, when most fans either worked or attended school), pitched the idea to NBC. An estimated 61 million people watched Game 4 on NBC; TV ratings for a World Series game during the daytime hours would not have approached such a record number. Kuhn&#x27;s vision in this instance has been fulfilled, as all the World Series games since 1988 have been played in prime time.

==== Curt Flood ====
On October 7, , the St. Louis Cardinals traded Curt Flood, catcher Tim McCarver, outfielder Byron Browne, and left-handed pitcher Joe Hoerner to the Philadelphia Phillies for first baseman Dick Allen, second baseman Cookie Rojas, and right-handed ace relief pitcher Jerry Johnson.

However, Flood refused to report to the moribund Phillies, citing the team&#x27;s poor record and the fact that they played in dilapidated Connie Mack Stadium before belligerent and, Flood believed, racist fans. Flood forfeited a relatively lucrative US$100,000 (equivalent to $ in ) contract by his refusal to be traded to the Phillies.

In a letter to Kuhn, Flood demanded that the commissioner declare him a free agent. Kuhn denied Flood&#x27;s request to enter free agency, citing the propriety of the reserve clause, which was language in contracts that essentially prevented a player from playing with another team even after his contract expired. In response, Flood filed a lawsuit against Kuhn and Major League Baseball on January 16, , alleging that Major League Baseball had violated federal antitrust laws. Even though Flood was making $90,000 (equivalent to $ in ) at the time, he likened the reserve clause to slavery. It was certainly a controversial analogy, even among those who opposed the reserve clause.

The case, &quot;Flood v. Kuhn&quot; (407 U.S. 258) eventually went to the Supreme Court. Flood&#x27;s attorney, former Supreme Court justice Arthur Goldberg, asserted that the reserve clause was depressing wages, and it limited players to one team for life. Major League Baseball&#x27;s counsel countered that Commissioner Kuhn acted under the way he did &quot;for the good of the game&quot;.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court, acting on &quot;stare decisis&quot; &quot;to stand by things decided&quot;, ruled 5–3 in favor of Major League Baseball, upholding a ruling in the case of &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot; (259 U.S. 200).

==== Charles O. Finley ====
Though he had a reputation as an owners&#x27; commissioner, Kuhn did not avoid confronting owners when he deemed it necessary. For example, he was a major adversary of Oakland Athletics owner Charles O. Finley. A major embarrassment for baseball resulted from Finley&#x27;s actions during the 1973 World Series. Finley forced player Mike Andrews to sign a false affidavit saying he was injured after the reserve infielder committed two consecutive errors in the 12th inning of Oakland&#x27;s Game 2 loss to the New York Mets. Andrews&#x27; teammates as well as manager Dick Williams rallied to his defense. Kuhn in return forced Finley to reinstate Andrews. In , when Finley attempted to sell several players to the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees for $3.5 million, Kuhn blocked the deals on the grounds that they would be bad for the game. Some believe that Kuhn&#x27;s actions were simply a revenge tactic, aimed at Finley, after Finley attempted to force an owners vote to remove Kuhn as commissioner in .

==== Kuhn&#x27;s war on drugs ====
After being in office for over ten years, Kuhn had grown a strong reputation for being particularly hard on players who abused drugs. Kuhn was quick to punish players who used drugs with heavy fines and big suspensions. Kansas City Royals catcher Darrell Porter told the Associated Press that during the winter of – he became paranoid, convinced that Kuhn knew about his drug abuse, was trying to sneak into his house, and planned to ban him from baseball for life. Porter found himself sitting up at night in the dark watching out the front window, waiting for Kuhn to approach, clutching billiard balls, and a shotgun. Ironically, when Porter was named the most valuable player of the 1982 World Series while playing for the Cardinals, Kuhn was on hand to congratulate him.

In , four players from the Kansas City Royals – Willie Wilson, Jerry Martin, Willie Mays Aikens, and Vida Blue – were found guilty of cocaine use. In addition, such established stars as Ferguson Jenkins, Keith Hernandez, Dave Parker, and Dale Berra admitted to having problems with drugs.
==== Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle ====

Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle were banned in 1980 and 1983 respectively after they were hired by casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, as greeters and autograph signers. These bans were highly controversial at the time since both players were retired and both in no way involved in baseball at the time, and because neither player&#x27;s duties were related in any way to sports betting, which was still illegal at the time in New Jersey in any case, let alone betting on baseball. Nevertheless, Kuhn stood firm and opined that a casino was &quot;no place for a baseball hero and Hall of Famer.&quot; The bans took place prior to the Hall formalizing its policy against inducting banned persons, and the Hall took no action as a result of Kuhn&#x27;s decision. Both players were reinstated by Kuhn&#x27;s successor in 1985.

==== Lifetime baseball passes ====
In , during the Iranian hostage crisis, Kuhn sat at a baseball game with Jeremiah Denton, a Navy admiral and former POW in Vietnam who would be elected U.S. senator later that year from the state of Alabama. Recalling the event to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Kuhn believed that &quot;that afternoon ... the idea of a lifetime baseball pass was discussed&quot;, and upon their return from Iran, each of the 52 hostages was given one of these unique passes.

==== Leaving office ====
Kuhn was both praised and attacked for the firm stand that he levied against offenders. In , some of the owners organized a move to push him out of office. In , Kuhn and his supporters made a last-ditch effort to renew his contract, but they ultimately failed. Kuhn, though, was allowed to stay for the regular season before being replaced by Peter Ueberroth.

=== Peter Ueberroth (1984–1989) ===

Peter Ueberroth was elected to succeed Bowie Kuhn on March 3, 1984, and took office on October 1 of that year. As a condition of his hiring, Ueberroth increased the commissioner&#x27;s fining ability from US$5,000 to $250,000. His salary was raised to a reported $450,000, nearly twice what Kuhn was paid.

Just as Ueberroth was taking office the Major League Umpires Union was threatening to strike the postseason. Ueberroth managed to arbitrate the disagreement and had the umpires back to work before the League Championship Series were over. The next summer, Ueberroth worked behind the scenes to limit a players&#x27; strike to one day before a new labor agreement was worked out with the Players Association (MLBPA).

During the course of his stint as commissioner, Ueberroth reinstated Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle, who had been banned from working for Major League Baseball by Kuhn because of their associations with gambling casinos. Also, Ueberroth suspended numerous players because of cocaine use, negotiated a $1.1 billion television contract with CBS, and initiated the investigation against Pete Rose&#x27;s betting habits. In 1985, Ueberroth&#x27;s first full year in office, the League Championship Series expanded from a best-of-five series to a best-of-seven series. At his urging, the Chicago Cubs chose to install lights at Wrigley Field rather than reimburse the leagues for lost night-game revenues. Ueberroth then found a new source of income in the form of persuading large corporations to pay for the privilege of having their products endorsed by Major League Baseball.

However, Ueberroth, with the assistance of the owners, also facilitated collusion, an illegal violation of the league&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement with the players, during the 1985, 1986 and 1987 off-seasons. Players entering free-agency were prevented from both signing equitable contracts and joining the teams of their choice during this period, a strategy that union leader Marvin Miller later held was &quot;tantamount to fixing, not just games, but entire pennant races, including all post-season series&quot;. The MLBPA filed collusion charges, arguing that Ueberroth and team owners had violated the collective bargaining agreement in the 1985, 1986, and 1987 seasons. The MLBPA won each case, resulting in &quot;second look&quot; free agents, and over $280 million in owner fines. Fay Vincent, who followed Ueberroth&#x27;s successor in the commissioner&#x27;s office, laid the crippling labor problems of the early 1990s directly at the feet of Ueberroth and the owners&#x27; collusion, holding that the collusion years constituted theft from the players.
Under Ueberroth, Major League Baseball enjoyed increased attendance (record attendance four straight seasons), greater awareness of crowd control and alcohol management within ballparks, a successful and vigilant anti-drug campaign, significant industry-wide improvement in the area of fair employment, and a significantly improved financial picture for the industry through greater advertisement. When Ueberroth took office, 21 of the 26 clubs were losing money; in Ueberroth&#x27;s last full season – 1988 – all clubs either broke even or finished in the black. In 1987, for example, baseball as an industry showed a net profit of $21.3 million, its first profitable year since 1973.

Nonetheless, following the announcement of the first of three large awards to the players following the collusion findings, Ueberroth stepped down as commissioner before the start of the 1989 regular season; his contract was to have run through the end of the season. He was succeeded by National League president A. Bartlett Giamatti.

=== A. Bartlett Giamatti (1989) ===
A Yale professor of English literature who became president of the university, A. Bartlett Giamatti had a lifelong interest in baseball (he was a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan). He became President of the National League in . During his stint as National League president, Giamatti placed an emphasis on the need to improve the environment for the fans and players in the ballparks. He also decided to make umpires strictly enforce the balk rule that was previously loosely enforced, and supported &quot;social justice&quot; as the only remedy for the lack of presence of minority managers, coaches, or executives at any level in Major League Baseball.

While still serving as National League president, Giamatti suspended Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose for 30 games after Rose shoved umpire Dave Pallone on April 30, 1988. Later that year, Giamatti also suspended Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Jay Howell, who was caught using pine tar during the National League Championship Series.

Giamatti, whose tough dealing with Yale&#x27;s union favorably impressed Major League Baseball owners, was unanimously elected to succeed Peter Ueberroth as commissioner on September 8, 1988, and assumed office on April 1, 1989. Giamatti was commissioner on August 24, when Pete Rose voluntarily agreed to permanent ineligibility from baseball. As reflected in the agreement with Pete Rose, Giamatti was determined to maintain the integrity of the game during his brief commissionership.
On September 1, 1989, at his vacation home on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Giamatti, a heavy smoker for many years, died suddenly of a massive heart attack at the age of 51. Giamatti died just eight days after banishing Rose and 154 days into his tenure as MLB commissioner. He became the second baseball commissioner to die in office, the first being Kenesaw Mountain Landis.

=== Fay Vincent (1989–1992) ===
Fay Vincent, who had assumed the position of deputy commissioner underneath and at the behest of his longtime friend Giamatti, became acting commissioner following Giamatti&#x27;s death on September 1, 1989, and was quickly confirmed as the 8th commissioner of baseball. He presided over the 1989 World Series, which was interrupted by the Loma Prieta earthquake; the owners&#x27; lockout during Spring training of the 1990 season; and the expulsion of George Steinbrenner in his first year. Before accepting the job as Commissioner of Baseball, Vincent consulted with Bart Giamatti&#x27;s widow, Toni, to make sure she thought it was appropriate for him to do so.

In 1990, National League president Bill White was prepared to suspend umpire Joe West for slamming Philadelphia pitcher Dennis Cook to the field, but Vincent intervened and no discipline was imposed upon West.

During his commissionership, Vincent made it known and very clear (e.g. while being interviewed by Pat O&#x27;Brien during CBS&#x27; coverage of Game 4 of the 1991 World Series) that if he had the chance, he would get rid of the designated hitter rule.

As deputy commissioner, Vincent was closely associated with Pete Rose&#x27;s lifetime banishment from baseball for gambling; although the investigation that led to Rose&#x27;s banishment began during Ueberroth&#x27;s tenure and the banishment was levied by Giamatti, Vincent led the investigation and was directly involved in the negotiations. Vincent has consistently stated that he does not support Rose&#x27;s reinstatement.

==== 1989 World Series ====

On October 17, 1989, Vincent sat in a field box behind the left dugout at San Francisco&#x27;s Candlestick Park. At 5:04 p.m., just prior to Game 3 of the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics, the 6.9 Mw Loma Prieta earthquake hit with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). At approximately 5:35 p.m., after coming to the conclusion that the power could not be restored before sunset, Vincent ordered the World Series game 3 to be postponed. According to Vincent, he had already made the decision to postpone Game 3 without telling anybody first. As a result, the umpires filed a formal protest against Vincent&#x27;s decision. However, the game had to be postponed due to trouble with gas lines as well as the power issue resulting from the earthquake.

The World Series ultimately resumed after a ten-day postponement (and some initial conflict between Vincent and San Francisco mayor Art Agnos, who felt that the World Series ought to have been delayed much longer) on October 27, 1989. While presenting the Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy to the Athletics, who wound up winning the World Series in a four-game sweep, Vincent controversially summed up the 1989 World Series as a &quot;remarkable World Series in many respects&quot;.

==== 1990 lockout ====

In February 1990, owners announced that spring training would not be starting as scheduled. This occurred after MLBPA executive director Donald Fehr became afraid that the owners would institute a salary cap. Fehr believed that a salary cap could possibly restrict the number of choices that free agents could make and a pay-for-performance scale would eliminate multi-year contracts. The lockout, which was the seventh work stoppage in baseball since 1972, lasted 32 games and wiped out all of spring training.

Vincent worked with both the owners and the MLBPA and on March 19, 1990, Vincent was able to announce a new Basic Agreement (which raised the minimum major league salary from US$68,000 to $100,000 and established a six-man study committee on revenue sharing). As a consequence of the lockout, Opening Day for the 1990 season was moved back a week to April 9, and the season was extended by three days to accommodate for the normal 162-game schedule.

==== George Steinbrenner ====
On July 30, 1990, Vincent banned New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner from baseball for life after Steinbrenner paid Howard Spira, a small-time gambler, $40,000 to dig up &quot;dirt&quot; on his outfielder Dave Winfield after Winfield had sued Steinbrenner for failing to pay his foundation the $300,000 guaranteed in his contract. Steinbrenner was eventually reinstated in 1993 (one year after Vincent left office).

==== Steve Howe ====
On June 24, 1992, Vincent permanently suspended pitcher Steve Howe for repeated drug offenses. Vincent was incensed when upper Yankee management (Buck Showalter, Gene Michael, and Jack Lawn) agreed to testify on Howe&#x27;s behalf, and threatened them with expulsion from the game:
The three men were unaffected by Vincent&#x27;s hyperbole, testified for Howe as promised, and remained active in baseball. Three months later, Vincent was removed from his job as commissioner. Later, an arbitrator overturned Vincent&#x27;s suspension of Howe on November 11, 1992.

==== 1993 expansion ====
In June 1991, Vincent declared that the American League would receive US$42 million of the National League&#x27;s $190 million in expansion revenue and that the American League would provide players in the National League expansion draft (involving the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins, the latter now known as the Miami Marlins). In an attempt to win support in the American League and balance the vote, Vincent decreed that the American League owners were entitled to only 22 percent of the $190 million take. This decision marked the first time in MLB&#x27;s expansion history that leagues were required to share expansion revenue or provide players for another league&#x27;s expansion draft. Vincent said the owners expanded to raise money to pay their collusion debt.

==== Realignment ====
Just prior to leaving office, Vincent had plans to realign the National League. Vincent wanted the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals to move from the Eastern Division to the Western Division. Part of the impetus for realignment was the geographically anomalous placement of the Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves in the West and the Cubs and the Cardinals in the east since 1969. National League president Bill White warned Vincent that realigning without league approval would be a gross violation of the National League Constitution enacted in 1876.

Many thought this plan would be beneficial to the league as a whole, especially by building a regional rivalry between the new franchise in Miami and the Atlanta Braves. The Cubs, however, opposed the move, suggesting that fans in the Central Time Zone would be forced to watch more games originating on the West Coast with later broadcast times (had the realignment included the use of a balanced schedule, the Cubs would have actually played more games against teams outside their division).

On July 17, 1992, the Chicago Cubs sued Vincent and asked the U.S. District Court in Chicago for a preliminary injunction to prevent implementation, which was granted two weeks later. After Vincent&#x27;s attorneys appealed, oral arguments were scheduled for August 30 that year. Ultimately, Vincent resigned before the litigation was scheduled to resume, so as a result, the Cubs dropped their suit against him.

Although Vincent&#x27;s vision never really came into fruition, Major League Baseball did in fact realign in 1994, albeit in the form of three divisions in each league (east, central and west) and the addition of an expanded playoff format.

==== Vincent&#x27;s relationship with the owners ====
His relationship with baseball&#x27;s owners was always tenuous at best; he resigned in 1992 after the owners gave him an 18–9 no-confidence vote. The owners were still angry at Vincent over his intervention during the 1990 Spring Training lockout, which subsequently cancelled Spring Training that year and pushed the regular season back three days. The owners were also disappointed by dwindling television ratings in light of a US$1.1 billion, four-year deal with CBS (which ultimately cost the network $500 million) beginning in 1990 (Vincent&#x27;s first full season as commissioner) and upwardly spiraling salaries. (It is also important to note that CBS itself contributed to decreasing ratings thanks to the haphazard scheduling of &quot;Game of the Week&quot; broadcasts during the regular season to the point that fans grew tired of tuning into no baseball on summer Saturdays.) They also accused him of acting in a high-handed manner, especially in the Howe affair.

The leaders in the movement to oust Vincent were members of what &quot;The Sporting News&quot; later dubbed &quot;The Great Lakes Gang&quot;:

*Bud Selig, president of the Milwaukee Brewers;
*Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of the Chicago White Sox;
*Stanton Cook, head of the Tribune Co., which owned the Chicago Cubs;
*Carl Pohlad, owner of the Minnesota Twins;
*Peter O&#x27;Malley, the longtime majority owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers

In his farewell, Vincent said 

He was replaced by Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig, whose family continued to maintain ownership over the Brewers. Fay Vincent was never able to complete the five-year term that he had inherited from Bart Giamatti. Vincent would later contend that Major League Baseball made a huge mistake by not appointing his deputy commissioner Stephen Greenberg – the son of the Hall of Fame first baseman and left fielder Hank Greenberg – as the commissioner.

=== Bud Selig (1992–2015) ===

Bud Selig served as the Executive Council chairman from 1992 to 1998, acting as the commissioner, and then was appointed as the official commissioner in 1998. Selig oversaw baseball through the 1994 strike, the introduction of the wild card, interleague play, and the merging of the National and American leagues under the Office of the Commissioner. He was instrumental in organizing the World Baseball Classic in 2006. Selig also introduced revenue sharing. He is credited for the financial turnaround of baseball during his tenure with a 400 percent increase in the revenue of MLB and annual record breaking attendance.

During Selig&#x27;s term of service, the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs became a public issue. The Mitchell Report, commissioned by Selig, concluded that the MLB commissioners, club officials, the Players Association, and the players all share &quot;to some extent in the responsibility for the steroid era&quot;. Following the release of the Mitchell Report, Congressman Cliff Stearns called publicly for Selig to step down as commissioner, citing his &quot;glacial response&quot; to the &quot;growing stain on baseball&quot;. Selig pledged on numerous occasions to rid baseball of performance-enhancing drugs, and oversaw and instituted many rule changes and penalties to that end.

Bud Selig helped introduce the following changes to Major League Baseball:
* Realignment of teams into three divisions per league, and the introduction of playoff wild card teams: one per league starting in 1994, and two per league starting in 2012
* Regular season interleague play (1997) and interleague games during the entire season (2013)
* Four additional franchises: the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins (now Miami Marlins) in 1993, followed by the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now Tampa Bay Rays) in 1998.
* An unbalanced schedule formula that heavily favors intradivisional play (2001)
* Consolidation of the National and American League offices and presidencies under the direct auspices of Major League Baseball and inclusion of all umpiring crews into a common pool for American and National League games, instead of having separate pools per league

During Selig&#x27;s years of service, new stadiums opened in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Colorado, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Arlington, St. Louis, Washington, D.C., Queens, The Bronx, and Minneapolis. In addition, the venues now known as Angel Stadium in Anaheim, Fenway Park in Boston, and Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City underwent major renovations, and similar work began on Wrigley Field in Chicago.

Selig retired from the position after the season, officially yielding to his successor on January 25, 2015, at which time Selig became the Commissioner Emeritus of Baseball.

=== Rob Manfred (2015–present) ===

Rob Manfred was elected as the 10th commissioner of baseball on August 14, 2014. Manfred, who has worked full-time for Major League Baseball since 1998, was elected on the third ballot after falling one vote short of the 23 vote (3/4 super-majority) threshold on the first two ballots. It was baseball&#x27;s first contested commissioner election in 46 years as Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf and Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno led a group in support of Boston Red Sox chairman Tom Werner, who they felt would take a tougher stance against the players in labor negotiations. Manfred took over from Bud Selig on January 25, 2015.

Manfred&#x27;s tenure has seen numerous changes to the game. In 2017, the intentional walk was changed, with pitchers no longer having to throw four balls to walk the batter, instead signaling to the bench. In 2020, during the COVID-shortened 60 game season, Manfred instituted further changes: the universal designated hitter rule (which became a full-time rule in the National League in 2022), a three-batter minimum for relief pitchers, using an automatic runner (often referred to by fans and the media as a &quot;ghost runner&quot; or &quot;Manfred man&quot;) at second base to start each extra inning, and shortening double headers to two seven-inning games rather than nine innings each. In 2023, further rule changes saw limits placed on defensive shifting, enlarging the bases from 15 inches to 18 inches, and the adoption of a pitch clock, requiring pitchers to throw a pitch no later than every 15 seconds with bases empty and 20 seconds with runners on base.

While these changes have been polarizing, further criticism has been levied against Manfred for his seemingly &quot;lackluster&quot; punishments for the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal, including his highly-publicized comment in 2020 that the World Series trophy was &quot;a piece of metal&quot;, moving the 2021 Major League Baseball All-Star Game from Atlanta to Denver in the face of Georgia&#x27;s new voting laws, and his role in the 2021–22 Major League Baseball lockout, the league&#x27;s first work stoppage in 27 years.

== Owners&#x27; &quot;coup&quot; ==
Tensions between commissioners and the baseball team owners who elected them, exacerbated by baseball&#x27;s chronic labor conflicts with the Major League Baseball Players Association beginning in the 1970s, came to a head in , when baseball owners voted no confidence in Commissioner Fay Vincent by a tally of 18–9. The owners had a number of grievances against Vincent, especially the perception that he had been too favorable to the players during the lockout of . Unlike his replacement Selig, Vincent stated that the owners colluded against the players. Vincent put it this way: &quot;The Union basically doesn&#x27;t trust the Ownership because collusion was a $280 million theft by Selig and Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf of that money from the players. I mean, they rigged the signing of free agents. They got caught. They paid $280 million to the players. And I think that&#x27;s polluted labor relations in baseball ever since it happened. I think it&#x27;s the reason union chief Donald Fehr has no trust in Selig.&quot;

Vincent resigned on September 7, 1992. Selig, the longtime owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, was appointed chairman of baseball&#x27;s Executive Council, making him the &quot;de facto&quot; acting commissioner (among the potential candidates for a permanent commissioner discussed in the media were future President George W. Bush, who was the managing partner for the Texas Rangers from 1989 to 1994, and George J. Mitchell, then-Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate). While acting commissioner, Selig presided over Major League Baseball during the 1994 players&#x27; strike, which led to the cancellation of the World Series.

Selig continued as acting commissioner until July 8, 1998, when the owners officially appointed him to the commissioner position.
Having been an owner for 30 years, Selig was seen as having closer ties to the MLB team owners than previous commissioners. Selig&#x27;s administration had many perceived successes, such as expansion and interleague play.

In May , Bud Selig surpassed Bowie Kuhn as the second longest-serving commissioner (including his time as &quot;acting commissioner&quot; from to mid-), behind Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who died in office after 24 years of service.
Beginning in 2006, Selig repeatedly stated his intention to retire at the end of his contract in 2009.
However, on 17 January 2008, it was announced that Selig accepted a 3-year extension through the 2012 season 

== Current challenges ==
A prominent issue currently faced by Major League Baseball is the usage of performance-enhancing drugs, including anabolic steroids, by ballplayers in the late 1990s through 2009. Addressing the issue of whether Selig should have taken alternate actions, former commissioner Fay Vincent wrote in the April 24, 2006, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that with most of Barry Bonds&#x27; official troubles being off the field, and with the strength of the players&#x27; union, there is little Selig can do beyond appointing an investigating committee. Vincent said that Selig is largely &quot;an observer of a forum beyond his reach&quot;.

Another challenge facing the Office of the Commissioner is competitive imbalance and struggling attendance in small markets. In 2010, just two teams (the Boston Red Sox and the Philadelphia Phillies) sold out every game and many teams failed to draw 2 million fans. In the Office of the Commissioner&#x27;s Blue Ribbon Panel on Baseball Economics, it was found that the luxury tax was failing to correct the competitive balance of the league and several steps were needed to correct the current state of revenue-generating and sharing.

<text>Albert Benjamin &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler Sr. (July 14, 1898 – June 15, 1991) was an American politician from Kentucky. He represented Kentucky in the U.S. Senate and served as its 44th and 49th governor. Aside from his political positions, he also served as the second commissioner of baseball from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. His grandson, Ben Chandler, later served as congressman for Kentucky&#x27;s Sixth District.

A multi-sport athlete during his college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1929. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon&#x27;s allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon&#x27;s choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race at that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state&#x27;s first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state&#x27;s education and transportation systems.

Convinced that he was destined to become President of the United States, Chandler challenged Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley for his U.S. Senate seat in 1938. During the campaign, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the state to campaign for Barkley, and Chandler lost a close race. The following year, Kentucky&#x27;s other senator, Marvel Mills Logan, died in office, and Chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat. A fiscal conservative and disciple of Virginia&#x27;s Harry F. Byrd, Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal and openly disagreed with the president&#x27;s decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific. In 1945, Chandler resigned his Senate seat to succeed the late Kenesaw Mountain Landis as commissioner of baseball. His most significant action as commissioner was the approval of Jackie Robinson&#x27;s contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers, effectively integrating Major League Baseball. He also established the first pension fund for Major League players, earning him the title &quot;the players&#x27; commissioner&quot;. Baseball owners were upset with Chandler&#x27;s governance, however, and did not renew his contract in 1951.

Following his term as commissioner, Chandler returned to Kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955. The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the racial integration of the state&#x27;s public schools and establishing a medical school at the University of Kentucky, later named the Chandler Medical Center in his honor. Following his second term as governor, his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963, 1967, and 1971. His endorsement of dark-horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson was seen as critical to Wilkinson&#x27;s successful gubernatorial campaign in 1987. Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler&#x27;s use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988. In his retirement, Chandler made numerous public appearances and remained active in state politics and events. Chandler died at the age of 92 years, 11 months; at the time, he was the oldest living former Kentucky governor as well as the earliest-serving former governor.

==Early life==
Albert Benjamin Chandler was born in the farming community of Corydon, Kentucky, in 1898. He was the eldest child of Joseph Sweet and Callie (Saunders) Chandler. Chandler&#x27;s father allegedly rescued his mother from an orphanage and married her when she was 15, but no record of their marriage has ever been found. In 1899, Chandler&#x27;s brother Robert was born. Two years later, their mother, still in her teens and unable to cope with raising two young children, abandoned the family. She fled the state and left her sons with their father. In his autobiography, Chandler said that his mother&#x27;s leaving them was his earliest memory. Years later, he sought his mother and found her living in Jacksonville, Florida. She had married again and he had three half-siblings. His full brother, Robert Chandler, died when he fell from a cherry tree when he was 13 years old.

Chandler was raised by his father and relatives, and by age 8, he virtually supported himself financially from his paper route and doing odd jobs in his community. In 1917, he graduated from Corydon High School, where he had been captain of the baseball and football teams. His father wanted him to study for the ministry, but Chandler instead entered Transylvania College (now Transylvania University) in Lexington, Kentucky. It was there that he received his lifelong nickname &quot;Happy&quot; because of his jovial nature. He paid for his education by doing chores for the local citizens. Chandler was captain of Transylvania&#x27;s basketball and baseball teams and the quarterback of the football team. He was a teammate of Dutch Meyer, a future member of the College Football Hall of Fame. He also joined the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society. In 1918, during World War I, the United States Army started a Student Officers&#x27; Training Corps at Transylvania, and Chandler began training to be an officer. The war ended before he was called to active duty.

In 1920, Chandler pitched a no-hitter for Grafton, North Dakota&#x27;s team in the Red River Valley League. He attended a professional baseball tryout in Saskatoon but did not make the team. He returned to Transylvania and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in June 1921. He then signed with the Class D baseball team the Lexington Reds, where he was a teammate of future Hall of Famer Earle Combs. Briefly considering a career in baseball, he finally decided to study law. He entered Harvard Law School that same year, paying his way by coaching high school sports in Wellesley, Massachusetts. His former teammate Charlie Moran, then coaching the Centre College Praying Colonels football team in Danville, Kentucky, asked him to scout the national powerhouse Harvard Crimson, an upcoming opponent for Centre. Chandler took copious notes for Moran, and Centre defeated Harvard 6–0 in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in college football history.

After a year, Chandler was not able to afford Harvard. He returned to Kentucky and continued at the University of Kentucky College of Law, coaching high school sports in Versailles and serving as the head coach of the women&#x27;s basketball team at the University of Kentucky in 1923. He was an assistant coach and scout for Charlie Moran at Centre, and he coached the freshman football team there. A member of the Order of the Coif, he received his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1924. He was admitted to the bar the following year and opened his law practice in Versailles.

On November 12, 1925, Chandler married Mildred Lucille Watkins, a teacher at the Margaret Hall School for Girls. They would have four children: Marcella, Mildred (&quot;Mimi&quot;), Albert Jr., and Joseph Daniel. Mimi Chandler played one of the four singing sisters in the 1944 film &quot;And the Angels Sing&quot;, appearing with Dorothy Lamour, Betty Hutton, and Diana Lynn before abandoning acting and working for the Kentucky Department of Tourism.

For the next five years, Chandler simultaneously practiced law, coached high school sports, and served as a scout for Centre. He joined numerous fraternal organizations, including the Freemasons, Shriners, Knights Templar, Forty and Eight, and Optimist International.

==Early political career==
Chandler entered politics when he was named chairman of the Woodford County Democratic Committee. In 1928, he was appointed master commissioner of the Woodford County circuit court. The following year, he was elected as a Democrat to represent the 22nd district in the Kentucky Senate. As a member of the Senate, he was part of a Democratic coalition that passed legislation to strip Republican governor Flem D. Sampson of many of his statutory powers.
As the 1931 gubernatorial election approached, Chandler and Prestonsburg native Jack Howard were mentioned as candidates for lieutenant governor. US Representative Fred M. Vinson backed Howard, a fellow Eastern Kentuckian, but political bosses Billy Klair, Johnson N. Camden Jr., and Ben Johnson supported Chandler. The support of another political boss, Mickey Brennan, gave Chandler the edge at the party&#x27;s nominating convention. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ruby Laffoon also owed his selection to the machinations of the state&#x27;s political bosses, notably his uncle, Representative Polk Laffoon. Problematically, Chandler was an ally of former governor J. C. W. Beckham, &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; publisher Robert Worth Bingham, and political boss Percy Haly, which put him at odds with Laffoon, a member of a Democratic faction that was headed by Russellville political boss Thomas Rhea and opposed to Beckham, Worth, and Haly. Despite the disharmony within the ticket, the worsening of the Great Depression under Republican president Herbert Hoover and Governor Sampson ensured a Democratic victory. Chandler was elected over John C. Worsham, by a vote of 426,247 to 353,573. In a break with precedent, Chandler set up an office on the executive floor of the state capitol and worked there full-time. Previous lieutenant governors had stayed in Frankfort only during legislative sessions, when they were charged with presiding over the State Senate.

Shortly after their election, the divide between Chandler and Laffoon widened over the issue of implementing a state sales tax. Laffoon favored the tax, but Chandler opposed it. As presiding officer of the State Senate, Chandler worked with House Speaker John Y. Brown Sr., to block passage of the tax. In retaliation, Laffoon&#x27;s allies in the Kentucky General Assembly stripped Chandler of some of his statutory power as lieutenant governor, and they were then able to pass the tax by a single vote in each house of the legislature.

Free from any constitutional duties during the time between sessions, Chandler had begun laying the groundwork to succeed Laffoon as governor, almost from the beginning of his term as lieutenant governor. Laffoon, however, had made it clear that he favored Thomas Rhea to be his successor. Rhea secured the services of rising political boss Earle C. Clements as his campaign manager. Hailing from Morganfield, only a short distance from Chandler&#x27;s hometown of Corydon, Clements later said that if Chandler had asked him first, he might have managed Chandler&#x27;s campaign, instead of Rhea&#x27;s. Instead, by the virtue of managing the opposing campaign, Clements became the leader of a Democratic faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades.

Chandler feared that Laffoon, who controlled the State Democratic Central Committee, would attempt to handpick the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by calling a nominating convention instead of holding a primary election and so Chandler used a bold move to circumvent Laffoon&#x27;s ability to carry out such an action. Under the Kentucky Constitution, Chandler became acting governor whenever Laffoon left the state. When Laffoon traveled to meet with President Franklin Roosevelt in Washington, DC, on February 6, 1935, Chandler used his authority to call the legislature into session to consider a bill that required each party&#x27;s gubernatorial candidates to be chosen by a primary, rather than a nominating convention. Laffoon returned to the state the next day and challenged Chandler&#x27;s authority to make the call, but Chandler&#x27;s actions would be validated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals on February 26.

Laffoon knew that the primary bill would be widely supported in the General Assembly since both the legislators and their constituents had grown to distrust party nominating conventions. Accordingly, he proposed a bill enacting a mandatory two-stage primary in which a runoff election would be held between the top two candidates in the first round. Historian Lowell H. Harrison maintained that Laffoon expected his rival faction to nominate the aging Beckham to oppose Rhea and that Laffoon hoped that a two-stage primary would wear Beckham down. Journalist John Ed Pearce, however, contends that Beckham had already declined to become a candidate, citing his own ill health and that of his son, before the special session convened. Whatever the case, the legislature passed the bill that Laffoon proposed.

==First term as governor==
After Beckham declined to run for governor, the anti-Laffoon faction supported Chandler against Rhea. During the primary campaign, Chandler seized upon the unpopular sales tax, labeling Rhea &quot;Sales Tax Tom&quot; and calling on the electorate to redeem the state from &quot;Ruby, Rhea, and Ruin&quot;. In the first round of the primary, Rhea garnered 203,010 votes to Chandler&#x27;s 189,575. Frederick A. Wallis received 38,410 votes, and Elam Huddleston received 15,501. The votes for Wallis and Huddleston meant that neither Rhea nor Chandler had achieved a majority, which triggered the runoff primary. Both Wallis and Huddleston backed Chandler in the runoff, and Chandler defeated Rhea, by a vote of 260,573 (53%) to 234,124 (47%), to secure the nomination.
Chandler promised to repeal the unpopular sales tax, lower the gasoline tax, oppose any increase in property taxes, and end the common practice of assessing state employees a percentage of their salaries to be used for campaign activities. Infuriated by their loss, Laffoon and his allies abandoned the party and supported the Republican nominee, King Swope. Policy-wise, there were few differences between the two, and personal attacks were employed by both sides. Swope&#x27;s reputation as a stern judge contrasted sharply with Chandler&#x27;s charisma, and Chandler used that to his advantage by dubbing Swope &quot;his majesty&quot;. When Chandler touted his service during World War I, Laffoon&#x27;s adjutant general Henry Denhardt countered by pointing out that Chandler had been only a cadet in training and never had engaged in active service in the war. Ultimately, the campaign turned on the failed presidential administration of the Republican ex-president Hoover and that of the sitting president, the Democratic Roosevelt. Chandler defeated Swope by a vote of 556,262 (54%) to 461,104 (45%) in the general election. The 95,000-vote margin of victory was then the largest ever recorded in a Kentucky gubernatorial election, and at only 37, Chandler was the youngest governor of any US state.

One of Chandler&#x27;s first acts as governor was to secure the repeal of the sales tax passed under Laffoon. He also successfully lobbied the legislature to abolish the two-round primary, in favor of a single primary for future elections. Knowing that he would need to raise revenue to offset the repeal of the sales tax and bring the state&#x27;s expenditures in line with its income, Chandler appointed a commission headed by ex-Governor Beckham to draft suggested budgetary legislation. Knowing that lobbyists hostile to the suggestions would likely try to encourage legislative gridlock until the constitutionally-mandated end of the 60-day session, Chandler asked his allies in the General Assembly to adjourn after 39 days to allow him to call a special legislative session that would not be time-limited and could entertain only the agenda he specified. Legislators obliged this request.

Acting on recommendations from Beckham&#x27;s commission, legislators helped offset the lost revenue from the sales tax by raising excise taxes, particularly the tax on whiskey, which was made possible by the state&#x27;s repeal of Prohibition, in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state&#x27;s first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government and by reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22.

Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more power in the hands of the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting the act.

Chandler used the savings realized from his reorganization of government to eliminate the state&#x27;s budget deficit and to pay off most of the state&#x27;s debt. That brought about further savings by eliminating debt service costs, which were applied to improvements in the state&#x27;s infrastructure and educational institutions. Chandler allocated funds for free textbooks for the state&#x27;s school children, created a teacher&#x27;s pension fund, and provided extensive funding for the state&#x27;s colleges and universities. Because segregation prevented blacks from attending graduate school in the state, Chandler secured an allocation of $5,000 annually to help blacks attend out-of-state graduate schools. He stopped short of desegregating the state&#x27;s universities, however, and told a group of black and white educators that &quot;it is not wise to educate the white and colored in the same school in the South. It is not prepared for it yet.&quot;

In 1939, he appointed the first woman trustee on the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees, Georgia M. Blazer of Ashland. She served from 1939 to 1960.

In 1936, Chandler urged implementation of the state&#x27;s first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Act. He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment, and in 1938, he proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state&#x27;s assistance rolls. He increased funding to the state&#x27;s hospitals and asylums, and he personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937. Following the flood, Chandler convinced the legislature to construct the new Kentucky State Reformatory, at La Grange.

Generally a friend of organized labor, Chandler supported miners&#x27; efforts to unionize, organized the state Department of Industrial Relations, and prohibited mine operators from being appointed as deputy sheriffs. He also endorsed the proposed Child Labor Amendment to the US Constitution and secured passage of a state anti-child-labor law that had been defeated twice in the state legislature by overwhelming margins. However, he opposed closed shops and sitdown strikes, and he used the Kentucky National Guard to quell labor-related violence in Harlan County.

In the 1936 US Senate contest in Kentucky, incumbent Democrat Marvel Mills Logan was seen as vulnerable, and Chandler backed Democratic challenger J. C. W. Beckham in the Democratic primary. That endorsement drew the ire of Chandler&#x27;s former ally, Democratic representative John Y. Brown Sr., who believed that in exchange for his support of Chandler in the 1935 gubernatorial race, Chandler would support him in the senatorial contest. An embittered Brown entered the race anyway, and the votes that he pulled from Beckham likely allowed Logan to retain the seat. Brown remained Chandler&#x27;s political enemy for the rest of his political career.

In 1936, Chandler was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Kentucky. The following year, Harvard University awarded him the same degree.

==U.S. Senator==
===Aspirations===
Both Robert Bingham and Percy Haly died in 1937. With J. C. W. Beckham aging (he would die in 1940), Chandler moved to fill the leadership void in the faction. He soon came to believe he was destined to become President of the United States. In mid-1937, he began advocating for Marvel Mills Logan, Kentucky&#x27;s junior senator, to be appointed to the US Supreme Court, creating a Senate vacancy to which Chandler, as governor, could appoint himself. The retirement of Justice George Sutherland in January 1938 gave President Franklin Roosevelt the opportunity to accommodate Chandler&#x27;s wishes, but Roosevelt preferred younger justices (Logan was 63), and Kentucky&#x27;s senior senator, Alben Barkley, recommended Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed for the appointment. Roosevelt heeded Barkley&#x27;s advice and appointed Reed instead of Logan.

Eager to augment his power and angered by the refusal of Roosevelt and Barkley to accept his suggestion of appointing Logan to the Supreme Court, Chandler did not attend a long-planned dinner in Barkley&#x27;s honor on January 22, 1938. Instead, he held an event of his own at Louisville&#x27;s exclusive Pendennis Club and alluded to his intentions of challenging Barkley during the upcoming Democratic senatorial primary. Barkley officially announced his re-election bid the following day. The death of another federal judge on January 26 provided a second opportunity for Roosevelt to appoint Senator Logan to a judgeship and appease Chandler, but Logan refused to consider the appointment. Following a January 31 meeting in Washington, DC, between Roosevelt and Chandler, in which Roosevelt urged Chandler to put his senatorial ambitions on hold, Chandler was encouraged by his political mentor, Virginia&#x27;s Harry F. Byrd, to challenge Barkley. Chandler heeded Byrd&#x27;s advice by making an official announcement of his candidacy on February 23, 1938, in Newport, Kentucky.
Barkley, who had been recently chosen as Senate Majority Leader by a single vote, was a strong supporter of Roosevelt and the New Deal. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats, who were wary of Roosevelt and sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president and opposing his handpicked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of Florida Senator Claude Pepper, who supported the New Deal, finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.

In late May 1938, Chandler&#x27;s campaign manager publicly claimed that federal relief agencies, especially the Works Progress Administration, were openly working for Barkley&#x27;s re-election. Although the WPA administrator in Kentucky denied the charges, veteran reporter Thomas Lunsford Stokes launched an investigation of the agency&#x27;s activities in the state and eventually raised 22 charges of political corruption in a series of eight articles, covering the Barkley-Chandler campaign. Federal WPA administrator Harry Hopkins claimed an internal investigation of the agency refuted all but two of Stokes&#x27; charges, but Stokes was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1939 for his investigation. In the wake of the investigation Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939 to limit the WPA&#x27;s involvement in future elections.

The negative effects of the investigation on Barkley&#x27;s campaign were minimal because of Chandler&#x27;s own use of his gubernatorial power and patronage on behalf of his own campaign. Dan Talbott, one of Chandler&#x27;s chief political advisors, encouraged supervisors of state workers to take punitive action against employees who made &quot;pessimistic expressions&quot; on Chandler&#x27;s chances in the primary. Furthermore, Chandler initiated a rural road-building project in the state, employing loyal supporters to construct and maintain the new roads. State workers who supported Chandler were employed to deliver pension checks to the state&#x27;s elderly citizens, and Talbott did not deny charges that the workers threatened to withhold the checks if the recipients did not pledge their support to Chandler.

Roosevelt personally visited Kentucky to campaign on Barkley&#x27;s behalf on July 8, 1938. As governor of the state, Chandler was on hand to greet Roosevelt on his arrival in Covington. Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president, Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley in the back seat of the open-topped vehicle that transported them to Latonia Race Track, the site of Roosevelt&#x27;s first speech. Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley but remained friendly with Chandler. After Roosevelt&#x27;s departure, Chandler played up Roosevelt&#x27;s complimentary remarks about him but downplayed or ignored critical remarks.

Late in the campaign, Chandler fell ill with chills, stomach pains, and a high fever. After first claiming the symptoms were similar to those that he had experienced a year earlier, Chandler later described his malady as &quot;intestinal poisoning&quot;. His doctor announced that Chandler, Dan Talbott, and a state police officer had all been sickened after drinking &quot;poisoned water&quot; that had been provided to Chandler for a radio address. Chandler maintained that someone from the Barkley campaign had tried to poison him, but the charge never gained much credence with the press or the electorate. Barkley frequently mocked it on the campaign trail by first accepting a glass of water offered to him and then shuddering and rejecting it. He pointed out to audiences that it was the young Chandler and not Barkley who had broken down first under the strain of the grueling campaign.

With Chandler ally Robert Bingham no longer at its helm, &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; supported Barkley, and organized labor, a key Chandler supporter in 1935, also threw its support to Barkley. Former Chandler ally John Y. Brown Sr. also took an active part in the Barkley campaign. Ultimately, Barkley defeated Chandler by a vote of 294,391 (56%) to 223,149 (42.6%). The remaining 1.4% of the vote was dividing among minor candidates. Chandler&#x27;s 70,872-vote loss was the worst loss for a primary candidate in state history.

===Appointment===
On October 9, 1939, following the death of Senator Logan, Chandler resigned as governor, elevating Lieutenant Governor Keen Johnson to the governorship. The following day, Johnson appointed Chandler to Logan&#x27;s vacated seat in the Senate. In a special election to fill the remainder of the unexpired term, Chandler then first defeated Charles R. Farnsley in the Democratic primary and Republican Walter B. Smith by a vote of 561,151 (58%) to 401,812 (42%) in the November 5, 1940, general election. Although he never forgave Roosevelt for backing Barkley in the 1938 senatorial primary, he generally supported the Roosevelt administration except for parts of the New Deal.

Chandler&#x27;s mentor, Harry F. Byrd, led a group of Southern conservatives in the Senate, and through Byrd&#x27;s influence, Chandler was appointed to the Committee on Military Affairs. In 1943, he was part of a five-person delegation from the Military Affairs Committee that traveled the world, inspecting US military bases. He vociferously disagreed with Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to prioritize the European Theatre in World War II over the Pacific Theatre.

Chandler upset many in the black community by voting against an anti-lynching bill soon after taking office. The bill levied fines against local governments and individual government officials in counties in which illegal lynchings had occurred. Of his vote against the bill, Chandler remarked, &quot;I am against lynching by anybody and of anybody, black or white, but the present bill carries penalties on local officials and local subdivisions which I think are too severe.&quot; The bill passed in the House of Representatives but died in the Senate. Later, Chandler joined with Southern senators in opposing the repeal of poll taxes, which had been long used as a mechanism to prevent blacks from voting.

At the expiration of his partial term in 1942, Chandler faced a challenge from former ally John Y. Brown Sr. in the Democratic primary. As a result of his votes on the anti-lynching bill and the poll tax repeal, the Louisville chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People worked against his re-election effort. During the campaign, Brown accused Chandler of abusing his power, including of having a swimming pool installed at his home, in violation of the federal rationing provisions that had been implemented during World War II. Chandler invited the Truman Committee to investigate the installation of the pool and no violations of the federal rationing provisions were found. Chandler went on to defeat Brown and was easily re-elected in the general election over Republican Richard J. Colbert.

Chandler believed that he had enough support at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to be nominated as Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate for that year&#x27;s presidential election. The support failed to materialize, however, after the Kentucky delegation, Earle C. Clements in particular, refused to back his nomination. The convention nominated Harry Truman as Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate. Truman became president upon Roosevelt&#x27;s death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him the chance to be US president.

==Commissioner of baseball==

After the death of baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, in November 1944, John O. Gottlieb, a friend of Chandler in the US War Department, suggested Chandler as a successor. Baseball owners who had been afraid that their players would be made eligible for the draft during the war had decided that their new commissioner needed to have the skills and influence to represent baseball&#x27;s interests in Washington, D C. As a senator, Chandler had advocated on behalf of baseball during the war, which endeared him to the owners. Furthermore, the commissioner&#x27;s $50,000 annual salary, about five times that of a US senator at the time, proved a significant enticement and so he agreed to be considered.

Other candidates being considered included National League President Ford Frick (who would succeed Chandler as commissioner in 1951), Democratic National Committee Chairman Robert E. Hannegan, former Postmaster General James Farley, US senator John W. Bricker, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, former federal Judge Fred M. Vinson, Ohio Governor Frank Lausche, and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson. After Cincinnati Reds president Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley raised strong opposition to Frick, who had been the frontrunner, New York Yankees co-owner Larry MacPhail began to advocate for Chandler. When the owners met in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 24, 1945, to vote for a new commissioner, Chandler&#x27;s name was not on the shortlist, which had Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the candidates received the required two-thirds majority, and after lobbying by MacPhail and New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham, the owners took an informal vote to see if anyone had the potential to be elected. Chandler&#x27;s name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots. Encouraged, the owners then held another formal vote. After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority. A third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.

Chandler remained in the Senate for several months after his election as commissioner because he wanted to cast his vote on the Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement and the Charter of the United Nations. He received only his Senate salary until his resignation on November 1, 1945, despite claims to the contrary by the press. Nevertheless, his delay in assuming the commissioner&#x27;s job upset many team owners, as did his late arrival to Game 3 of the 1945 World Series, which rendered him unavailable to rule on whether the weather was clement enough to begin the game. Many owners believed Chandler had been attending a political meeting, but he had actually been at a Detroit Athletic Club luncheon, where he was representing Major League Baseball.

Chandler&#x27;s election was also met with disdain from much of the press in the Eastern United States, where most of baseball&#x27;s teams resided at that time. His Southern drawl and his willingness to sing &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; with very little encouragement led some sportswriters to opine that he was too undignified for the office. Others resented his folksy, political style, calling him &quot;a preening politician&quot;, &quot;the Kentucky windbag&quot;, and &quot;a hand-shaking baby-kissing practitioner of the arts&quot;. Chandler further alienated the press by moving the commissioner&#x27;s office to Cincinnati from Chicago in 1946.
In early 1946, Jorge Pasquel and his four brothers, who owned the Mexican League, siphoned campaign funds from the upcoming Mexican presidential election and used them to offer large salaries and signing bonuses to American baseball players. In some cases, the offers were triple the salaries being paid in the Major Leagues. Chandler deterred players from considering Mexican League offers by imposing a five-year ban from Major League Baseball to anyone who played in the Mexican League and did not return by April 1, 1946. In all, eighteen players played for the Mexican league despite the ban, including Mickey Owen, Max Lanier, and Sal Maglie. Vern Stephens initially agreed to play in Mexico as well but returned before Chandler&#x27;s deadline. Ted Williams, Stan Musial, and Phil Rizzuto were also offered lucrative contracts and incentives, but all eventually declined to play in Mexico.

Shortly after the Mexican league incident, Robert Murphy, a former negotiator for the National Labor Relations Board, attempted to organize the Pittsburgh Pirates into a guild for purposes of collective bargaining. Murphy decried the reserve clause in player contracts, which gave team owners unlimited control over the player&#x27;s services, and he demanded more rights for players, including the right of contract and the right of salary arbitration. Chandler worked with Pirates officials to avoid a threatened strike by the players. Part of Chandler&#x27;s intervention included organizing a team of replacement players as a contingency plan; the team would have included Honus Wagner, then 72.

The defections to the Mexican league and the threat of a strike by the Pirates prompted owners to form an advisory committee, chaired by Larry MacPhail, to suggest needed changes that would calm the discontent among the players. On August 27, 1946, the committee presented a draft a document outlining the changes. Language in the original draft admitted that baseball was operating as a monopoly and that racial bias was the sole reason for segregation in baseball. Baseball&#x27;s attorneys stripped the controversial language from the version that was eventually adopted by the owners.

===Breaking baseball&#x27;s color line===

Days prior to Chandler&#x27;s assumption of the commissionership, the Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; general manager, Branch Rickey, had announced the signing of Jackie Robinson to a minor league contract with the Montreal Royals, making him the first black man to play for a Major League Baseball affiliate. The following year, Rickey transferred Robinson&#x27;s contract from Montreal to Brooklyn, effectively breaking baseball&#x27;s color line. In a speech at Wilberforce University in February 1948, Rickey recounted a secret meeting that had allegedly been held by baseball officials at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago on August 28, 1946. At the meeting, Rickey claimed that Ford Frick disseminated a report that stated, &quot;However well-intentioned, the use of Negro players would hazard all physical properties of baseball.&quot; According to Rickey, all 15 team owners except for him voted to endorse the report. Rickey claimed Frick meticulously collected all copies of the report at the end of the meeting to prevent them from being disseminated. Baseball historian Bill Marshall later wrote that the document and subsequent vote to which Rickey was referring was the advisory committee&#x27;s initial draft of recommended reforms. Marshall further recorded that Rickey identified the meeting and the report shortly after his speech at Wilberforce and retracted his claim of 15–1 opposition to Robinson&#x27;s entry into Major League Baseball.

Chandler, who was also allegedly at the meeting, made no public mention of it until a 1972 interview. In the interview, Chandler then corroborated the essentials of Rickey&#x27;s story, but he placed the meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in January 1947. He also recounted that later in 1947, Rickey came to his home in Kentucky to discuss the matter further. According to Chandler, Rickey professed that he would not move forward with Robinson&#x27;s transfer unless he had Chandler&#x27;s full support, which Chandler later pledged. Aside from Chandler&#x27;s anecdote, which he frequently repeated after the 1972 interview, there is no evidence that his meeting with Rickey ever took place. Nevertheless, future baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn and &quot;Washington Post&quot; sportswriter Bob Addie maintained that Robinson would not have played without Chandler&#x27;s intervention.

That Chandler supported Robinson and the racial integration of baseball is evidenced by his actions during the 1947 season. First and foremost, as commissioner, Chandler had the power to void Robinson&#x27;s contract, but he chose to approve it. Further, after extreme, race-based jeering at Robinson by the Philadelphia Phillies and their manager, Ben Chapman, Chandler threatened both the team and Chapman personally with disciplinary action for any future incidents of race-based taunting. Later that season, he decisively supported Ford Frick&#x27;s decision to suspend indefinitely any members of the St. Louis Cardinals who followed through on their threat to strike against racial integration.

===Other matters===

During the 1946 postseason, rumors began to swirl that Yankees owner Larry MacPhail was lobbying Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher to leave the Dodgers and manage the Yankees. The move angered Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, who encouraged Chandler to begin an investigation into the gambling habits of Durocher and his associate, actor George Raft. In the offseason, Chandler and Durocher had a meeting; Chandler counseled Durocher to abandon his gambling. Branch Rickey charged Chandler with maintaining a double standard, however, when the commissioner took no action after seeing MacPhail with two known gamblers at a Yankees–Dodgers preseason exhibition in Havana, Cuba. MacPhail then signed two Dodgers assistant coaches (Chuck Dressen and John Corriden) as aides to Yankee manager Bucky Harris while they were still employed by the Dodgers. Chandler suspended Dressen for 30 days and levied $2,000 fines against MacPhail and the Yankees.

The Yankees–Dodgers feud continued in the New York newspapers throughout the offseason. Charges were levelled by both sides, including accusations that Durocher was a philanderer because of his alleged involvement with married actress Laraine Day, which ultimately resulted in Day&#x27;s divorce. When Durocher subsequently married Day, a local Catholic priest declared that attending Dodgers games was a venial sin. Prompted in part by this declaration, Chandler suspended Durocher from baseball for a year, just days before Opening Day, citing &quot;conduct detrimental to baseball.&quot;

Also in 1947, Chandler sold the rights to broadcast the World Series on the radio for $475,000 and used the money from the contract to establish a pension fund for baseball players. In 1949, Chandler negotiated a seven-year contract with Gillette and the Mutual Broadcasting System to broadcast the Series. Proceeds from the $4,370,000 deal went directly into the pension fund. The same two companies negotiated a six-year, $6 million contract to broadcast the Series on television in 1950. Again, Chandler directed the proceeds into the pension fund.

In 1949, Danny Gardella, who had left the New York Giants for the Mexican League in 1946, filed suit against Major League Baseball, claiming Chandler&#x27;s ban on players who went to the Mexican League had denied him a means of pursuing his livelihood. Gardella demanded $100,000 in damages from the suspension, and claimed that the award should be tripled because baseball was subject to federal antitrust laws. Similar suits were filed by Max Lanier and Fred Martin, both of whom also played in Mexico. On June 2, 1949, a federal court refused to reinstate the three players pending their trials but urged for the antitrust issues to be adjudicated as soon as possible. Attempting to alleviate the legal pressure on Major League Baseball, Chandler lifted the bans on players who had gone to Mexico almost two years early. Lanier and Martin dropped their suits, but Gardella pursued his. After Gardella&#x27;s lawyer publicly questioned Chandler in court about baseball&#x27;s antitrust exemption for a day and a half in September 1949, baseball executives, including Chandler, agreed to settle Gardella&#x27;s case for $60,000.

Chandler&#x27;s contract as baseball commissioner was not due to expire until April 1952, but he asked for the owners to extend it in December 1949. The owners voted against offering the extension at that time but promised to reconsider the request in December 1950. The vote in 1950 was nine votes for Chandler and seven against, leaving him three votes short of the necessary three-fourths majority. Chandler asked for the extension to be reconsidered at the owners&#x27; meeting on March 12, 1951, but the vote was again 9–7. Upset that his contract was not extended, Chandler resigned effective July 15, 1951.

In an interview with &quot;The Sporting News&quot; in August 1951, Chandler cited his decision to void a trade between the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox for outfielder Dick Wakefield as a major factor in his inability to secure a new contract. The Yankees traded Wakefield to the White Sox for cash, but Wakefield refused to report to the White Sox after a salary dispute, which led to a disagreement between the teams over who was responsible for his salary. Chandler voided the trade, making Wakefield&#x27;s contract the Yankees&#x27; responsibility and angering their owner, Del Webb. It was not until the 1970s that Chandler began to cite his involvement in the integration of baseball as a reason for his contract not being renewed. Historian John Paul Hill considers that to be unlikely, however, because two of Chandler&#x27;s strongest allies, Connie Mack and Walter Briggs Sr., were ardently opposed to integration, and Bill DeWitt, the second owner in the American League to integrate, voted against him. Hill points to the Dick Wakefield dispute and Chandler&#x27;s investigations of Del Webb and Cardinals owner Fred Saigh involving their rumored connections to gambling interests to be more compelling reasons for Chandler&#x27;s dismissal.

Following his tenure as baseball commissioner, Chandler returned to his law practice. He also engaged in farming and published a newspaper, &quot;The Woodford Sun&quot;. The Kentucky Press Association and the Kentucky Broadcasting Association both named him Man of the Year. He continued his involvement in sports, presiding over the International Baseball Conference from 1952 to 1955.

==Second term as governor==
Chandler remained involved in politics throughout his tenure as baseball commissioner. In 1948, he became the leader of the Dixiecrat movement in Kentucky. He hosted Dixiecrat presidential candidate Strom Thurmond at his home when he visited the state but did not officially endorse Thurmond&#x27;s campaign. By the time that he had permanently returned to the state in mid-1951, it was too late to influence the gubernatorial contest. He spent the next four years rebuilding his political base in preparation for another run at the office.

===1955 gubernatorial campaign===
Twenty years after first holding the governorship, Chandler again entered the gubernatorial race in 1955, using the slogan &quot;Be like your Pappy and vote for Happy.&quot; His opponents in the Democratic Party, led by senator and former governor Earle C. Clements and sitting governor Lawrence Wetherby, had difficulty finding a candidate to oppose him. The most likely choice, Lieutenant Governor Emerson &quot;Doc&quot; Beauchamp, was handicapped by his connections to political bosses in Logan County. Clements virtually handpicked a relatively unknown candidate, Kentucky Court of Appeals Judge Bert T. Combs. Because Combs, whom Chandler nicknamed &quot;The Little Judge&quot;, had no record for Chandler to campaign against, Chandler portrayed him as a pawn of Clements and Wetherby, whom he derisively referred to as &quot;Clementine&quot; and &quot;Wetherbine&quot;.

The inexperienced Combs did little to help his campaign. His first campaign speech, which he dryly read verbatim from his notes, included the candid admission that it might be necessary to re-institute the state sales tax to balance the budget. Following that speech, a disappointed observer remarked, &quot;Combs opened and closed [his campaign] on the same night.&quot; That speech also gave Chandler his main issue for the campaign. He charged that Combs would raise taxes while promising that he would lower them as he had in his first term.

Chandler&#x27;s strategy in the campaign was to launch an attack upon the Wetherby administration and, before the Clements-Wetherby-Combs faction could react to it, to launch a new one. He claimed that Wetherby had used the state&#x27;s money frivolously by installing air conditioning in the state capitol and installing a $20,000 rug in his office. (An invoice showing that carpeting for the entire first floor of the capitol had cost one tenth that amount did not stop Chandler from repeating the claim, which he said &quot;didn&#x27;t hurt anybody, and people liked to hear it&quot;.) After a Wetherby administration official approved the purchase of African mahogany paneling for the governor&#x27;s office, Chandler charged that Wetherby had gone &quot;clear to Africa&quot; to find paneling for his office and promised that, if elected, he would use good, honest Kentucky wood for decoration. He also denounced the construction of a turnpike connecting Elizabethtown and Louisville, the state fairgrounds, and Freedom Hall as unnecessary.

Chandler won the Democratic primary by 18,000 votes over Combs. In the general election, he defeated Republican Edwin R. Denney by a vote of 451,647 (58%) to 322,671, (41%) then the largest margin of victory for a gubernatorial candidate in the state&#x27;s history.

===Tenure===

Soon after Chandler took office, it became clear that he could not fund the social programs initiated by Clements and Wetherby and Chandler&#x27;s own proposed programs, with the revenue then being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, which had been initiated by Wetherby to unify the state&#x27;s children&#x27;s welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to balance the budget. To deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956 and then called a special session in which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46 million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state&#x27;s coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state&#x27;s tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate tax by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100 million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.

Although Democrats held a majority in both houses of the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs. Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to co-operate with Chandler, their chief political enemy. Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers, like John B. Breckinridge, who simply had philosophical differences with the governor. Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, that group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and welfare programs, but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would not agree to pass only the measures he put before them. Because of the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term to pass many of his proposals, including his tax plan. Frequently, that meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.
During his campaign, Chandler had promised that he would fund a medical school at the University of Kentucky although the University of Louisville already had a medical school, which made a poll of state physicians show overwhelming opposition to the plan. Nevertheless, Chandler delivered on his promise by allocating $5 million to the establishment of what became known as the Albert B. Chandler Medical Center. Chandler said that the establishment of the school was his proudest achievement as governor.

Just as when he had been baseball commissioner, Chandler faced the issue of racial integration during his second term as governor. Among his first actions upon his election was to issue an executive order, ensuring that blacks and whites would have equal access to the state park system. He publicly acknowledged the US Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; as the law of the land and promised to enforce it. The Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down Kentucky&#x27;s Day Law, against integration, the following year. Some areas of the state resisted the change. Notably, in 1956, when nine black students in Sturgis, Kentucky, attempted to enter the all-white Sturgis High School, they were blocked by 500 opponents of integration. On September 4, 1956, Chandler called out the National Guard, including a force of over 900 guardsmen and several M47 Patton tanks, to disperse the crowd. The confrontation lasted a total of 18 days before the protesters peacefully dispersed. Shortly thereafter, Chandler took similar actions in response to a protest in the town of Clay, which was resolved without violence also. Of his actions, Chandler remarked, &quot;We regret it is necessary to use this means of guaranteeing equal rights to our citizens, but that we must do.&quot;

Still convinced that he was destined to become president, Chandler attended the 1956 Democratic National Convention in the hope of securing the party&#x27;s presidential nomination. Despite being told by his advisors that the convention would nominate Adlai Stevenson, Chandler continued to seek the nomination but received only 36 1/2 votes. Following Stevenson&#x27;s nomination, Chandler returned to Kentucky, bitterly disappointed. The death of Senator Alben Barkley and the expiration of Senator Clements&#x27; term would make Kentucky elect two senators also in November 1956. Clements was seeking re-election, and the state Democratic committee chose Wetherby as the nominee for Barkley&#x27;s seat. Chandler refused to use his office to support Stevenson, Clements or Wetherby, and Republicans Dwight Eisenhower, John Sherman Cooper, and Thruston Ballard Morton won the presidential and the senatorial races in the state.

In the 1959 gubernatorial primary, Chandler threw his support to Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield. The anti-Chandler forces eventually put forth Bert Combs as their nominee again.

Having learned from his previous campaign, Combs now attacked Chandler for allegedly requiring state employees to donate 2% of their salaries to his campaign. According to Combs, Chandler had deposited the money in a bank in Cuba, but the money was lost when Fidel Castro overthrew the government during the Cuban Revolution. Ultimately, Combs prevailed in the primary by a vote of 292,462 (52%) to 259,461 (46%).

Republicans nominated John M. Robsion Jr. to oppose Combs. Combs ultimately won the general election by a wide margin.

==Later life==
In 1957, Chandler was one of ten inaugural members of the Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame. A vestryman at St. John&#x27;s Church in Versailles, he was awarded the Bishop&#x27;s Medal of the Episcopal Church in 1959. The same year, he received the Cross of Military Service from the United Daughters of the Confederacy. He served as a trustee of the Ty Cobb Foundation and Transylvania University. At the 1960 Democratic National Convention, he again sought the party&#x27;s presidential nomination, as he considered that the front-runner, John F. Kennedy, was &quot;a nice young fellow ... (but) too young for the nomination&quot;. Chandler proposed for him to be the presidential nominee, with Kennedy as the nominee for vice-president, but the convention chose Kennedy for president instead.

On January 3, 1962, Chandler opened a campaign headquarters in Frankfort, announcing his bid for an unprecedented third term as governor with the slogan &quot;ABC [Albert Benjamin Chandler] in 1963&quot;. His opponent in the primary was Edward T. &quot;Ned&quot; Breathitt Jr., the choice of outgoing Governor Bert Combs. Chandler reverted to his familiar campaign themes, charging the Combs administration with wasting state funds in the construction of a floral clock at the state Capitol and denouncing Combs for re-instituting the state sales tax. However, he found it very difficult to adapt to campaigning via television, an increasingly important medium, and his attacks mostly fell flat.

Breathitt enraged Chandler by charging that when Chandler was a senator, he had voted in favor of declaring World War II, but soon afterward, he had resigned his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler&#x27;s version of events, after he voted in favor of the war declaration, he called US Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked to be put on active duty. Chandler said that Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, and then Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler&#x27;s explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.

Chandler lost to Breathitt in the primary by 62,407 votes, but his running mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, won the nomination for lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce believed that the loss marked the demise of the Chandler wing of the Democratic Party in Kentucky, but Chandler himself remained somewhat influential.
In 1965, Chandler was named to the University of Kentucky Hall of Distinguished Alumni and became commissioner of the Continental Football League (COFL). Chandler resigned from his COFL position in 1966 after league trustees supported a proposal to allow players from the major professional American football leagues, which he had been told would not happen. He served as Democratic National Committeeman from Kentucky. Becoming somewhat of a perennial candidate, he unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1967 and 1971. After his loss in the 1967 Democratic primary, he endorsed Republican Louie B. Nunn. After his election, Nunn appointed Chandler to the first of his three terms on the University of Kentucky&#x27;s board of trustees.

In 1968, Chandler was given serious consideration as the vice-presidential running mate of Alabama&#x27;s former governor, George Wallace, in the latter&#x27;s American Independent Party bid for president. Wallace instead turned to Air Force General Curtis LeMay. The ticket lost to Richard M. Nixon and Spiro T. Agnew. Chandler said that he and Wallace had been unable to come to an agreement on their positions on racial matters.

In 1971, Chandler again entered the gubernatorial race, now as an independent, but he garnered only 39,493 votes, compared to 470,720 for eventual Democratic victor Wendell H. Ford, and 412,653 for Republican challenger Tom Emberton. Ford&#x27;s successor, Julian Carroll, again appointed Chandler to the University of Kentucky&#x27;s board of trustees.

The Major League Baseball Veterans Committee chose Chandler for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. In 1987, filmmaker Robby Henson profiled Chandler in a 30-minute documentary entitled &quot;Roads Home: The Life and Times of A.B. &#x27;Happy&#x27; Chandler&quot;.

Chandler endorsed dark horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson in the 1987 Democratic primary, and his endorsement helped underdog Wilkinson gain traction early in the race. After Wilkinson&#x27;s election as governor, he appointed Chandler to a voting seat on the University of Kentucky&#x27;s board of trustees, where he had been an honorary trustee. (In 1981, Governor John Y. Brown Jr. had designated Chandler an &quot;honorary&quot;, non-voting, member of the board.) While discussing the University of Kentucky&#x27;s decision to dispose of its investments in South Africa at a meeting of the university&#x27;s board of trustees on April 5, 1988, Chandler remarked, &quot;You know Zimbabwe&#x27;s all nigger now. There aren&#x27;t any whites.&quot; The comment immediately drew calls for Chandler&#x27;s resignation from the University Senate Council and the Student Government Association, and approximately 50 students marched on university president David Roselle&#x27;s office demanding for Chandler to apologize or resign. Commenting on the controversy the next day, Chandler said, &quot;I was raised in a small town in Western Kentucky. There were 400 whites and 400 blacks, and we called them niggers and they didn&#x27;t mind. And I reverted temporarily, at least, to that expression, and of course, I wish I hadn&#x27;t.&quot; That apology did not satisfy many, and 200 protesters marched onto the State Capitol, demanding for Wilkinson to remove Chandler from the board. Wilkinson refused to remove Chandler and urged the crowd to forgive him.

Chandler published his autobiography, &quot;Heroes, Plain Folks, and Skunks&quot;, in 1989. In an interview with &quot;The Kentucky Kernel&quot;, the University of Kentucky&#x27;s student newspaper, Chandler was asked about his controversial comments the previous year, which were addressed in the book. Chandler reportedly told the paper, &quot;I said most of the Zimbabweans were niggers and they are niggers.&quot; The comment sparked fresh protests and calls for Chandler&#x27;s resignation. In response to the controversy, Chandler&#x27;s personal assistant said, &quot;He used the word again in explaining that it was not intended by him to be a racial slur&quot; and called the &quot;Kernel&quot;″s story &quot;a complete and total distortion&quot;.

Chandler died in Versailles on June 15, 1991, and was buried in the church yard of Pisgah Presbyterian Church near Versailles. Prior to his death, he had been the oldest living member of the Baseball Hall of Fame and was the longest-living former Kentucky governor.

A native of St. Louis, he served as Bishop of Kansas City–Saint Joseph (1956–1961), Archbishop of New Orleans (1964–1965), and Archbishop of Chicago (1965–1982). He was named a cardinal in 1967.

He remained at St. Louis until 1926, when he was sent to continue his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. He earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree (1928) and a Doctor of Sacred Theology (1932) from the College of the Propagation of the Faith.

Cody was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Francesco Marchetti Selvaggiani on December 8, 1931. He remained in Rome for the next six years as a staff member of the North American College and an official of the Vatican Secretariat of State. In 1938, he earned a Doctor of Canon Law degree from the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum &quot;S. Apollinare&quot;, and was awarded the Benemerenti medal for his services to the Secretariat of State. Upon his return to the United States, Cody served as private secretary to Archbishop of St. Louis John J. Glennon until 1940, when he became chancellor of the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Cody was named a privy chamberlain in 1939 and a domestic prelate in 1946. He accompanied Archbishop Glennon to Rome in 1946 when the latter was named a cardinal, and was on hand when Glennon died in Ireland on the return trip.

===Episcopacy===
On May 10, 1947, Cody was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of St. Louis and Titular Bishop of Apollonia by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 2 from Archbishop Joseph Ritter, with bishops George Joseph Donnelly and Vincent Stanislaus Waters serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of St. Louis. He was appointed coadjutor to the Bishop of Saint Joseph, Missouri, on January 27, 1954. He was appointed Bishop of Kansas City–Saint Joseph, Missouri, on August 29, 1956, and installed October 11, 1956. In 1961, he was transferred to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he was appointed coadjutor to the archbishop on August 14, 1961, appointed apostolic administrator on June 1, 1962, and acceded to the See of New Orleans on November 8, 1964. According to James Ralph, he became an object of national attention as archbishop, due to his predecessor Joseph Rummel&#x27;s efforts to desegregate the Catholic schools in the archdiocese. As the coadjutor archbishop and then archbishop of New Orleans, Cody had directed the desegregation of New Orleans’s parochial schools. Cody’s actions had generated fierce opposition, but he had not flinched under pressure.. Cody was quoted as saying, &quot;The Church&#x27;s role will be most important and It is definitely felt by many experts in the field of community relations that the Catholic Church will continue to be one of the most potent influences in bringing about racial understanding and brotherly love among all races. This was one of the salient points in the encyclical, &quot;Pacem in Terris.” The ecumenical council, showing to the world the spirit of unity and harmony among all Catholics, has been felt appreciably in the present racial crisis in our country. Through its schools and institutions of higher learning, most of which have become fully integrated. the Church can contribute greatly to the development and understanding among all people in the South.&quot; Upon the cities construction projects for integrated schools; &quot;The construction of these schools has helped considerably in bringing an acceptance of the Catholic Church&#x27;s teaching on the equality of all men.&quot;

===Archbishop of Chicago===

==== Mismanagement ====
Cody was appointed Archbishop of Chicago on June 14, 1965, and installed August 24, 1965. He was elevated to cardinal on June 26, 1967. Cody&#x27;s time in Chicago was marked by strife and controversy, including federal investigations of financial improprieties and an ambiguous relationship with Helen Dolan Wilson, who was alleged to be his mistress. Wilson, who &quot;followed (Cody&#x27;s) every move&quot; for a period of some 25 years, was alleged to have received large sums of money diverted by Cody, some of which were used to purchase &quot;a house in Boca Raton ... a luxury car, expensive clothes and furs, and holiday cash presents.&quot;

Despite the fact that approximately $1 million of Church funds disappeared under Cody&#x27;s tenure, and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops lost more than $4 million in a single year while Cody was treasurer of that organization, all investigations were suspended upon Cody&#x27;s death.

Roy Larsen, the religion editor of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote:&quot;Legally, the investigations by the paper and the federal prosecutors ended inconclusively. In that sense, the legal tactics followed by Cody and his lawyers--chiefly a strategy of delays and stalling--succeeded in preventing any indictments. Eight months before the first story was published, the US Attorney&#x27;s office issued subpoenas to Cody and the archdiocese, but the information that was sought was never turned over to the government. Even after the series was published, the stonewalling continued. A new US Attorney, Dan Webb, had taken over the investigation and issued new subpoenas, but Frank McGarr, the chief judge of the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, did nothing to move the case along. Finally, the Cardinal&#x27;s health became an issue. On April 25, 1982, he died, and in July 1982, Webb terminated the investigation, stating: &quot;Once the cardinal passed on, the investigation as to the allegations against the cardinal became moot.&quot;Cody often found his view of episcopal authority in conflict with a number of priests of his diocese. He was opposed to some of the decisions of Apostolic Delegate Jean Jadot and led a protest campaign against what he felt was his excessive progressivism and radicalism.

After the first meeting between Church and Freemasonry which had been held on 11 April 1969 at the convent of the Divine Master in Ariccia, Cody was the protagonist of a series of public handshakes between high prelates of the Roman Catholic Church and the heads of Freemasonry.

==== Relationship with the Black Community ====
Cody butted heads with Fr George Clements for similar reasons, as local Black Catholics sought more Black representation in the local pastorate, especially at Black parishes. Cody circumvented requests for Clements to be named pastor of his parish by placing a different Black priest as pastor there, a pastorally inexperienced Fr Rollins Lambert. He thought he would appease the community since he appointed a Black priest, but they were frustrated with an explicit attempt to avoid appointing a well known Black activist. A series of racially-charged town hall meetings that followed eventually resulted in Fr Lambert opposing Cody&#x27;s leadership—agreeing with Clements and others that he was a (perhaps unintentional) &quot;racist&quot;—and requesting for Clements to be made pastor. Cody eventually conceded.

The desire for (and often &quot;ask questions later&quot; nature of) inculturation by these same Black Catholics also aggravated Cody, who opposed many of the desired (and sometimes brazenly implemented) changes. In one instance, Clements replaced a statue at his parish of St Anthony of Padua with an altar to Martin Luther King Jr., which Clements attempted to justify by using the concept of popular acclaim. Cody did not budge and threatened to withdraw archdiocesan funds from the parish if the St Anthony statue was not returned to its place. Clements, a close friend of many Black Panthers (including Fred Hampton, his personal mentee), informed Cody he would have to come do it himself, but that he (Clements) would not be able to protect him if he did so. The statue remained elsewhere. Eventually Cody did withdraw financial support from Clements&#x27; parish and they operated for a time via fundraisers and special appeals.

=== Later life and death ===
The opposition to Cody&#x27;s leadership waned as his health declined in the early 1980s. He was succeeded in the summer of 1982 by the markedly progressive Joseph Bernardin. Cody died that year at the age of 74 and was interred in the Bishops&#x27; Mausoleum at Mount Carmel Cemetery (Hillside, Illinois).

<text>The news media or news industry are forms of mass media that focus on delivering news to the general public. These include news agencies, newspapers, news magazines, news channels etc.

== History ==
Some of the first news circulations occurred in Renaissance Europe. These handwritten newsletters, circulated among merchants, contained news about wars, economic conditions, and social customs. Newsletters were very scarce and no two were the same as they were all hand written, until the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1440. With movable type and ink, newspapers were now able to be mass produced for cheap. The first printed news appeared by the late 1400s in German pamphlets, which contained content that was often highly sensationalized. The first newspaper written in English was &quot;The Weekly News,&quot; published in London in 1621. Several papers followed in the 1640s and 1650s. In 1690, the first American newspaper was published by Richard Pierce and Benjamin Harris in Boston. However, it did not have permission from the government to be published and was immediately suppressed.

=== In the United States ===

In 1729, Benjamin Franklin began writing a new form of newspaper that was more satirical and involved in civic affairs than previously seen. In 1735, John Peter Zenger was accused of seditious libel by the governor of New York, William Cosby. Zenger was found not guilty, largely in part to his attorney Andrew Hamilton. Hamilton later wrote a paper in which he argued that newspapers should be free to criticize the government as long as it was true. Later, with the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791, freedom of the press would be guaranteed by the First Amendment.

In the 1830s, newspapers started seeking commercial success and turned toward reportage, beginning with the New York Sun in 1833. Advancements in technology made it cheaper to print newspapers and &quot;penny papers&quot; emerged. These issues sought out more entertaining daily news like murder and adventure, rather than politics. Penny papers attempted to reach a larger audience due to the cheap prices.

By the end of the century, modern aspects of newspapers such as banner headlines, extensive use of illustrations, &quot;funny pages,&quot; and expanded coverage of organized sporting events began to appear. Media consolidation emerged with many independent newspapers becoming part of &quot;chains&quot;.

The early 1900s saw Progressive Era journalists using a new style of investigative journalism that revealed the corrupt practices of government officials. These exposing articles became featured in many newspapers and magazines. Those who wrote them were labeled as &quot;muckrakers.&quot; They became very influential and were a vital force in the Progressive reform movement. However, after 1912, muckraking declined. The public began to think the exposés were sensationalized, but they did make a great impact on future policies.

In the early 1920s, radios became accessible and allowed large audiences to simultaneously listen to breaking news. Advertisers jumped on the opportunity to persuade the millions of captive listeners.

With the introduction of the television came The Communications Act of 1934. It was an agreement between commercial television and the people of the United States that established that 1. The airways are public property. 2. Commercial broadcasters are licensed to use the airways. 3. The main condition for use will be whether the broadcaster served &quot;the public interest, convenience, and necessity.&quot;

Television news continued to expand during the 1970s. By 1990, more than half of American homes had cable systems and nationally oriented newspapers expanded their reach. With technological advancements in the newsroom, notably the Internet, a new emphasis on computer-assisted reporting and a new blending of media forms emerged, with one reporter preparing the same story in print, online, and on camera for a newspaper&#x27;s cable station.

==Etymology==

A &quot;medium&quot; (plural &quot;media&quot;) is a carrier of something. Common things carried by media include information, art, or physical objects. A medium may provide transmission or storage of information, or both. The industries which produce news and entertainment content for the mass media are often called &quot;the media&quot; (in much the same way the newspaper industry is called &quot;the press&quot;). In the late 20th century it became commonplace for this usage to be construed as singular (&quot;The media is...&quot;) rather than as the traditional plural.

&quot;Press&quot; is the collective designation of media vehicles that carry out journalism and other functions of informative communication, in contrast to pure propaganda or entertainment communication. The term press comes from the printing press.

==Broadcasting==

Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and video signals (programs) to a number of recipients (&quot;listeners&quot; or &quot;viewers&quot;). This group may be the public in general, or a relatively large audience within the public. Broadcasting forms a very large segment of the mass media. Television and radio programs are distributed through radio broadcasting or cable, often simultaneously. By coding signals and having decoding equipment in homes, the latter also enables subscription-based channels and pay-per-view services. The sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a schedule. A broadcasting organization may broadcast several programs at the same time, through several channels (frequencies), for example BBC One and Two. On the other hand, two or more organizations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed part of the day. Digital radio and digital television may also transmit multiplexed programming, with several channels compressed into one ensemble.

===Television===
In television or broadcast journalism, news analysts (also called newscasters or news anchors) examine, interpret, and broadcast news received from various sources of information. Anchors present this as news, either videotaped or live, through transmissions from on-the-scene reporters (news correspondents).

News films, or &quot;clips,&quot; can vary in length. There are some which may be as long as ten minutes and others that need to fit in all the relevant information and material in two or three minutes. News channels have also begun to host special documentary films that are much longer durations and able to explore a news subject or issue in greater detail.

News stories are categorized with various formats according to the merit of the story. Such formats include AVO, AVO Byte, Pkg, VO SOT, VOX POP, and Ancho Visual.

* The AVO, or Anchor Voice Over, is the short form of news. The story is written in a gist. According to the script visual is edited. The anchor reads the news while the visual is broadcast simultaneously. Generally, the duration of an AVO is 30 to 40 seconds. The script is three to four lines. At first the anchor starts to read the news, and, after reading one or one-and-a-half lines, the visual is aired, overlapping the face of anchor.
* The AVO Byte has two parts: An AVO, and one or more bytes. This is the same as an AVO, except that as soon as the AVO ends, the Byte is aired.
* The Pkg has three parts: Anchor, Voice Over, and Sign Off. At first a Script is written. A voice over anchor reads the anchor or anchor intro part.

==Newspapers==
A newspaper is a lightweight and disposable publication (more specifically, a periodical), usually printed on low-cost paper called newsprint. It may be general or of special interest, and may be published daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly.

General-interest newspapers are usually journals of current news on a variety of topics. Those can include political events, crime, business, sports, and opinions (either editorials, columns, or political cartoons). Many also include weather news and forecasts. Newspapers increasingly use photographs to illustrate stories; they also often include comic strips and other entertainment, such as crosswords.

=== Print journalism ===

A story is a single article, news item or feature, usually concerning a single event, issue, theme, or profile of a person. &quot;Correspondents&quot; report news occurring in the main, locally, from their own country, or from foreign cities where they are stationed.

Most reporters &quot;file&quot; information or write their stories electronically from remote locations. In many cases, &quot;breaking stories&quot; are written by staff members, through information collected and submitted by other reporters who are out on the field gathering information for an event that has just occurred and needs to be broadcast instantly. Radio and television reporters often compose stories and report &quot;live&quot; from the scene. Some journalists also interpret the news or offer opinions and analysis to readers, viewers, or listeners. In this role, they are called commentators or columnists.
Reporters take notes and photographs or videos, either on their own, by citizens, or through a photographer. In the second phase, they organize the material, determine the focus or emphasis (identify the peg), and write their stories. The story is then edited by news or copy-editors (U.S. style) or sub-editors in Europe, who function from the &quot;news desk&quot;. The headline of the story is decided by the news desk. Often, the news desk also heavily re-writes or changes the style and tone of the first draft prepared. Finally, a collection of stories that have been picked for the newspaper or magazine &quot;edition&quot;, are laid out on dummy (trial) pages, and after the &quot;chief editor&quot; has approved the content, style and language in the material, it is sent for publishing. The writer is given a &quot;byline&quot; for the piece that is published; his or her name appears alongside the article. This process takes place according to the frequency of the publication. News can be published in a variety of formats (broadsheet, tabloid, magazine and periodical publications) as well as periods (daily, weekly, semi-weekly, fortnightly or monthly).

==Newsmagazines==

A newsmagazine, is a usually weekly magazine featuring articles on current events. These magazines generally go more in-depth into stories than newspapers, trying to give the reader an understanding of the context surrounding important events, rather than just the facts. For example, TIME magazine is an NYC based weekly newsmagazine that is known for its in depth articles on current events, politics, science, and more. TIME, with an audience of 100 million people, has built a brand on trust and authority.

==Newsreels==

A newsreel was a documentary film common in the first half of the 20th century, that regularly released in a public presentation place containing filmed news stories.

Created by Pathé Frères of France in 1908, this form of film was a staple of the typical North American, British, and Commonwealth countries (especially Canada, Australia and New Zealand). Newsreels were popular throughout European cinema programming schedule from the silent era until the 1960s when television news broadcasting completely supplanted its role. Due to television news, the popularity of newsreels began to decline, and they were eventually phased out all together.

==Online journalism==

Online journalism, otherwise known as digital journalism, is the reporting of news produced or distributed via the Internet. The Internet has allowed the formal and informal publication of news stories. Online journalism can be published by professional writers and journalists, through mainstream media websites and outlets. Or, news can be published by citizens, through blogs, vlogs, and social media.

== News coverage ==
By covering news, politics, weather, sports, entertainment, and vital events, the daily media shape the dominant cultural, social and political picture of society. Due to the rise of social media involvement in news, the most common news value has become entertainment in recent years. Apropos of this was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&#x27;s 11,000-word &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article apropos of the 2004 United States presidential election, published June 1, 2006. By June 8, there had been no mainstream coverage of the documented allegations by President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s nephew. On June 9, this sub-story was covered by a &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; article.

Media coverage during the 2008 Mumbai attacks highlighted the use of new media and Internet social networking tools, including Twitter and Flickr, in spreading information about the attacks, observing that Internet coverage was often ahead of more traditional media sources. In response, traditional media outlets included such coverage in their reports. However, several outlets were criticized as they did not check for the reliability and verifiability of the information. Some public opinion research companies have found that a majority or plurality of people in various countries distrust the news media.

=== Social media ===
People have a lot of options when it comes to choosing their consumption of news, and many are increasingly turning to social media. Over half of U.S. adults, 54%, get some of their news from social media, according to a Pew Research Center survey from September 2024. The two most popular sources are Facebook and Youtube, as 33% and 32% of users learn information from these sources, with Instagram and TikTok following close at 20% and 17%. The director of news and information research at Pew Research Center, Katerina Eva Matsa, says people aren&#x27;t just looking for facts when they seek out news, but also a sense of community. Social media groups and pages gives them a sense of community, and are easily accessible, right at their fingertips. Also according to Pew Research Center, Americans value the speed, novelty, format, and variety that the news on social media offers. Social media algorithms allow for users to see catered news and information to suit their likings and beliefs.

These algorithms have introduced users to social media news influencers that may resonate with them. &quot;News influencers&quot; have gained huge popularity in recent months, as almost 4 in 10 U.S. adults under 30, or 37%, regularly turn to them, according to another Pew Research Center study from November 2024. News influencers are defined as &quot;individuals who have a large following on social media and often post about news or political or social issues.&quot; Users say they get basic facts, opinions, funny posts, and breaking news from their respective news influencers. Americans like to connect and resonate with those who agree with their opinions and beliefs, and getting news updates from your own corner of the internet is comforting and assuring to them. Some U.S. adults have also noted that news influencers have helped them better comprehend events and issues.

=== Fake news ===
Fake news articles are untruthful-on-purpose stories that purposely mislead the reader to think one way. With the rise of new media through social media (Facebook, Youtube, etc) there has been an increase in fake news due to the ability of anyone able to share and rapidly spread information. It can be tough to decipher who to trust, and who not to. On the Internet, fake news articles can appear in the same search as truthful ones. This makes it hard for others to determine between what is fact and what is opinion. Specifically, the media coverage during the 2016 United States presidential election saw numerous misleading articles for both candidates.

== Media integrity ==
Media integrity refers to the ability of a news media outlet to serve the public interest and democratic process, making it resilient to institutional corruption within the media system, economy of influence, conflicting dependence and political clientelism. Media integrity encompasses following qualities of a media outlet:
* independence from private or political interests
* transparency about own financial interests
* commitment to journalism ethics and standards
* responsiveness to citizens
The concept was devised particularly for the media systems in the region of South East Europe, within the project South East European Media Observatory, gathering organizations which are part of the South East European Network for Professionalization of Media (SEENPM).

<text>Joseph Taylor Robinson (August 26, 1872 – July 14, 1937) was an American politician who served as United States Senator from Arkansas from 1913 to 1937, serving for four years as Senate Majority Leader and ten as Minority Leader. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the state&#x27;s 23rd governor, and was also the Democratic vice presidential nominee in the 1928 presidential election.

After studying law at the University of Virginia, Robinson returned to Arkansas, winning election to the Arkansas General Assembly. He won election to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1903 to 1913. He won election as governor of Arkansas in 1912, but resigned from that position in 1913 to take a seat in the Senate. In the Senate, Robinson established himself as a progressive and strong supporter of President Woodrow Wilson. Robinson served as the chairman of the 1920 Democratic National Convention and won election as the Senate Minority Leader in 1923. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1924 election and was nominated as the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1928. The Democratic ticket of Al Smith and Robinson lost in a landslide to the Republican ticket of Herbert Hoover and Charles Curtis.

The Democrats took control of the Senate after the 1932 Senate elections and elected Robinson as Senate Majority Leader. He passed Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs through the Senate, alienating some of his colleagues with his autocratic style. In the midst of debate over the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, Robinson died due to heart failure.

==Early life and education==

Robinson was born in Lonoke, Arkansas, the son of Matilda Jane (née Swaim) and James Madison Robinson. He attended the University of Arkansas and earned a law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law.

== Career ==
In 1894 Robinson was elected to the Arkansas Legislature and served one term. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1902 from the Sixth District of Arkansas, and was re-elected to four subsequent terms, serving until 1913.

Robinson was a presidential elector in 1900.

In 1912, Robinson was elected governor of Arkansas. He resigned his U.S. House seat on January 14, 1913, and took office as governor on January 16. However, U.S. Senator Jefferson Davis had died on January 3, after the legislature had re-elected him to a new term beginning March 4, 1913; his seat was now open. On January 27, 1913, only 12 days after Robinson took office as governor, the legislature elected him to the U.S. Senate to replace Davis.

Robinson became the last U.S. Senator elected by a state legislature rather than by direct popular vote. The Seventeenth Amendment, which required direct election, took effect on April 8, 1913. All the other senators elected to terms starting in 1913 had been elected earlier; Senator James H. Brady of Idaho was elected to fill a vacancy on January 24; he was next to last.

Robinson resigned as governor on March 8, 1913. Although he served as governor for only 55 days, he worked to provide funds to complete the new state capitol building, create a labor statistics board, adopt an official state flag, and create the Arkansas State Highway Commission.

A self-described liberal, Robinson was a supporter of progressive legislation during his lifetime, as demonstrated in a 1911 speech when he voiced his support for measures such as an eight-hour workday and pensions for old disabled workers.

===U.S. Senate===
He staunchly supported the policies of President Woodrow Wilson even as other Democrats faltered. He championed the Keating-Owen Child Labor Act and worked to enact bills to regulate railroads and other key industries. He led the Senate to arm merchant ships and voted to declare war on Germany. He also led the unsuccessful effort in the Senate to ratify the Treaty of Versailles.

Robinson was regarded as a progressive in Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s image. Robinson gained influence in the Senate and later served as Chairman of the 1920 Democratic National Convention. Robinson was re-elected to the Senate in 1918, 1924, 1930, and 1936. In 1923, the Senate Democratic leader Oscar Underwood, who served as the Senate Minority Leader, resigned due to illness. Senior Democratic Senator Furnifold Simmons was expected to take Underwood&#x27;s place, but withdrew his name from consideration after Robinson challenged him for the position. By unanimous acclamation, Robinson became the Democratic leader, a position he would hold until his death in 1937.

As minority leader, Robinson took over the distribution of patronage appointments and reformed the committee assignment process, decreeing that no senator would hold the top Democratic position in more than one important committee. A Capitol Hill resident, he never strayed far from the Senate chamber, but kept a constant watch over the proceedings in order to capitalize on any dissension within the Republican ranks. Known as a &quot;horse trader,&quot; he made deals on both sides of the aisle and helped facilitate negotiations with the era&#x27;s GOP presidents.
Robinson had presidential aspirations of his own. In 1924, he was a minor contender for the Democratic nomination. A &quot;favorite son&quot; candidate, he drew the support of his Arkansas constituents and the southern conservative members of his party. That year, however, his performance on a golf course brought him more attention than his short-lived race for the presidency. At the Chevy Chase Country Club (a favorite haunt for Washington politicians), a fellow golfer asked to move ahead of the senator&#x27;s slow-playing foursome. Robinson refused to extend the courtesy to the local surgeon. After a few angry words, he hit the doctor, knocking him to the ground. The club expelled Robinson from its membership, and the press gave him a new title; he was now the &quot;pugilist&quot; senator.

==== Majority leader ====
Robinson became Senate Majority Leader by unanimous vote in 1933 when the Democrats became the majority. He was the first Democrat to serve as formally designated Majority Leader. He took his duties seriously, refusing to delegate his numerous responsibilities. Some Senators resented his autocratic style. In debate he could be terrifying. He would grow red in the face, pound his desk, gesture wildly, and stamp his feet.
As Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal &quot;marshal,&quot; he ensured the passage of countless bills relating to the Depression and social policy, his most impressive victory being the Emergency Banking Act, which he pushed through both houses of Congress in seven hours.

Richard L. Riedel, a Senate press gallery attendant in the 1920s and 1930s, recalled, &quot;When [Robinson] would go into one of his rages, it took little imagination to see fire and smoke rolling out of his mouth like some fierce dragon. Even when he kidded me, he spoke in loud gasps while puffing his cigar. Robinson could make Senators and everyone in his presence quake by the burning fire of his eyes, the baring of his teeth as he ground out the words, and the clenching of his mighty fists as he beat on the desk before him.&quot;
The press referred to him as &quot;scrappy Joe&quot;, and he nearly fought with Senate colleagues Robert M. La Follette, Porter J. McCumber, James Thomas Heflin, and Huey Long. Once the United States entered World War I, Robinson denounced those senators who opposed the war effort. After La Follette opposed it, Robinson questioned his patriotism on the Senate floor and La Follette almost got into a brawl with Robinson and had to be restrained. His response to a guard who questioned his credentials at the 1920 Democratic National Convention was a punch in the face. Despite this temper, he maintained strong friendships across party lines.

====Court-packing proposal====
In 1937, Robinson supported Roosevelt&#x27;s proposal to restructure the United States Supreme Court (the &quot;court-packing plan&quot;). This support may have occurred in part due to Roosevelt promising Robinson the next appointment to the Supreme Court. Robinson himself was critical of the Court for having, as he saw it “delayed recovery,” together with its invalidation of a New York minimum wage law (a decision that the Court later reversed). Robinson had a much more difficult time with the president&#x27;s Reorganization Act of 1939, designed to add liberal justices to the Supreme Court. For weeks in 1937, he spoke, fought, and cajoled for the bill, but he could not stifle the criticism of scores of Republicans and Democrats.

=== 1928 presidential election ===
Robinson was the Democratic nominee for vice president in 1928, as the running mate of Alfred E. Smith. Early in 1928, Robinson clashed with Senator James Thomas Heflin, a Democrat from Alabama, who frequently inserted anti-Catholic sentiments into many of his speeches. When New York&#x27;s Catholic governor, Alfred E. Smith, announced his candidacy for president, Heflin made Smith the target of his criticism. Robinson admonished Heflin&#x27;s views, stating that religious affiliation had no bearing on a person&#x27;s credentials for higher office. On one famous occasion, he declared, &quot;I have heard [the senator] denounce the Catholic Church and the Pope of Rome and the cardinal and the bishop and the priest and the nun until I am sick and tired of it, as a Democrat.&quot; Helfin retorted, &quot;The Senator from Arkansas can not remain leader of the Democrats and fight the Roman Catholics&#x27; battle every time the issue is raised in this body.&quot; Interpreting the remark as a challenge to his authority, Robinson held a vote of confidence to gauge his colleagues&#x27; loyalty. By a near unanimous vote (Heflin was absent), the senators pledged their support to their leader and his stance against bigotry.

Though Smith lost to Republican nominee Herbert Hoover, Robinson emerged from the campaign a national figure, now known for the impassioned speeches he had made around the country on behalf of Smith and the Democratic platform. He continued to score victories as the Senate&#x27;s minority leader, but his cooperative relationship with Hoover riled the members of his party. They understood that no other senator possessed Robinson&#x27;s tenacity and influence, however, so they accepted his leadership, infuriating as it could be.

== Death ==
On July 2, 1937, Robinson was the leading advocate for Roosevelt&#x27;s court-packing bill when it was being debated. On July 12, he left the Senate chamber complaining of chest pains. Two days later, Robinson died of heart failure. Two days after Robinson&#x27;s sudden death, colleagues, friends, and family attended his funeral in the Senate chamber. The Senate chaplain gave a brief sermon, and the United States Capitol Police escorted his body to a funeral train headed to Little Rock. Thousands of mourners traveled to the Arkansas capitol to witness Robinson&#x27;s lying-in-state ceremony and to express their grief and their enormous admiration for the majority leader: the &quot;fightingest&quot; man in the U.S. Senate.

He is buried at the Roselawn Cemetery in Little Rock, Arkansas. His home in Little Rock, the Joseph Taylor Robinson House, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1994.

==Legacy==

Robinson is the namesake of Camp Joseph T. Robinson, Arkansas&#x27;s primary National Guard base; Robinson Center in downtown Little Rock; and elementary, middle and high schools on the northwestern edge of Little Rock.

Robinson&#x27;s face appears on the reverse of a United States half dollar produced for the 1936 Arkansas Centennial; he was one of only four men to appear on a U.S. coin while living. This was a commemorative issue not intended for regular circulation. A total of 25,265 coins were minted.

Robinson is mentioned in &quot;True Grit&quot;, a novel by Arkansas writer Charles Portis. In an aside that illustrates the complexities of Southern political allegiances during the relevant period, Portis&#x27;s narrator Mattie Ross says: &quot; brought a good deal of misery to the land in the Panic of ’93 but I am not ashamed to own that my family supported him and has stayed with the Democrats right on through, up to and including Governor Alfred Smith, and not only because of Joe Robinson.&quot;

<text>Wei Shuo (, 272–349 CE), courtesy name Mouyi (茂猗), sobriquet He&#x27;nan (和南), commonly addressed just as Lady Wei (衛夫人), who lived during the Eastern Jin, was one of the most famous of all Chinese calligraphers in history. She was a pioneer, who established new rules that developed the regular script. As a teacher, her most notable disciple was Wang Xizhi.

==Biography==
Born in modern Xia, Shanxi, Wei was the daughter of Wei Zhan (衛展) or the daughter or younger sister of Wei Heng (衛恆). She came from a family well-known for their skill in literature and calligraphy, and her uncle and cousin were also talented calligraphers.

Wei was married to Li Ju (李矩, not to be confused with the Jin general of the same name, Li Ju), the Governor of Ding Prefecture. Wei and Li had Li Chong (李充), also a calligrapher and a Palace Secretarial Attendant (中書侍郎). She may have been taught the style that Zhong Yao used; however, judging from comments describing her style as thin, Wei&#x27;s style may have been more narrow than Zhong&#x27;s wider style.

After her time studying the famous works of classic calligraphers, she began developing her own style, that focused on mimicking the shapes and motions found in nature, creating work of grace and vigour that became the benchmark for calligraphy from then onwards. She wrote a monumentally influential treatise on her theories of calligraphy; Wei&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Ink Brush&quot; (筆陣圖) describes the Seven Powers (七勢) that later became the famous Eight Principles of Yong. She famously compared calligraphy to war: the paper to a battlefield, the brush to a weapon and the ink to ammunition. 

==Works==
Wei&#x27;s other works include:
* &quot;Famous Concubine Inscription&quot; (名姬帖, &quot;Ming Ji Tie&quot;)
* &quot;The Inscription of Weishi He&#x27;nan&quot; (衛氏和南帖, &quot;Weishi He&#x27;nan Tie&quot;)

<doc id="304122" wikidata="Q28377812" url="?curid=304122" title="Jonny Quest">
<text>Jonny Quest is a science fiction–adventure media franchise created by Doug Wildey for Hanna-Barbera. It revolves around the titular Jonny Quest, a boy who accompanies his scientist father on extraordinary adventures. The franchise started with a 1964–65 television series of the same name, and has come to include two sequel television series, two television films and three video games. It is currently owned by Warner Bros. after Hanna-Barbera was absorbed by Warner Bros. Animation and succeeded by Cartoon Network Studios.

==Original series (1964–65)==
&quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, also known as &quot;The Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot;, is the original American science fiction/adventure animated television series that started the franchise. It was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions for Screen Gems. It was created and designed by comic-book artist Doug Wildey. Inspired by radio serials and comics in the action-adventure genre, including Doc Savage, Tom Swift, &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and &quot;Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy&quot;, the series featured more realistic art, characters, and stories than Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s previous cartoon programs. This show closely parallels the juvenile Rick Brant series. It was the first of several Hanna-Barbera action-based adventure shows, which would later include &quot;Space Ghost&quot;, &quot;The Herculoids&quot;, and &quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio&quot;, and ran on ABC in primetime on early Friday nights for one season from 1964 to 1965.

Hanna-Barbera released an LP titled &quot;Jonny Quest in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; in 1965. It is a 29-minute radioplay with Dr. Quest, Race Bannon and Jonny, in a Jules Verne-inspired sea adventure.

After two decades in reruns, during which it appeared on all three major United States television networks of the time, new episodes were produced for syndication in 1986. Subsequently, telefilms, a comic-book series, and a modernized revival series, &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot;, were produced in the 1990s.

==&quot;The New Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot;==
By the mid-1980s, the edited episodes of &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; were part of the syndication package &quot;The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera&quot;. Each episode was time-compressed and edited to reduce the runtime from 25 to 22 minutes. Edits focused on the comical scenes with Bandit. Thirteen episodes were produced in 1986 (some sources state 1987) to accompany the originals in the &quot;Funtastic World&quot; programming block. These episodes were referred to simply as &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; in their opening title sequence (the same ones seen on the original series since the censoring), and were noticeably less violent and more &quot;kid-friendly&quot; than the 1960s originals, and introduced the new regular character Hardrock, (also called the Monolith Man), a living being made of stone. Hardrock would not return in any later versions of the program.

&quot;Jonny&#x27;s Golden Quest&quot;, a feature-length television movie was produced by Hanna-Barbera for USA Network in 1993, again pitting the Quest team against Dr. Zin, who in the film murders Jonny&#x27;s mother. &quot;Jonny&#x27;s Golden Quest&quot; reused the storyline of the recent series&#x27; episode &quot;Deadly Junket&quot;, in which a little girl named Jessie Bradshaw, the daughter of a missing scientist, asked the Quest party to help find her father. Here she is revealed to be lying about her parentage at Dr. Zin&#x27;s behest, and to Race&#x27;s surprise is actually his and Jade&#x27;s daughter. Jessie would appear as a character in all subsequent versions of the &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; property. A second telefilm, &quot;Jonny Quest versus The Cyber Insects&quot;, was produced for TNT in 1995, and was promoted as being the final iteration of the &quot;Classic &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;&quot;.

All three of these productions featured the voices of Don Messick and Granville Van Dusen as Dr. Quest and Race Bannon, respectively. Messick also reprised performing the &quot;voice&quot; of Bandit in the series, but the features had this done by Frank Welker.

==&quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot;==
&quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; premiered on all three major Turner Broadcasting System entertainment cable channels (Cartoon Network, TBS, and TNT). This Quest redux returned in the late 1990s on Cartoon Network, as part of the original Toonami rotation when the block launched on March 17, 1997, and aired consistently on Toonami until September 24, 1999. It then continued to air sporadically until December 14, 2002. Almost seven years later (February 17, 2009), the first thirteen episodes of &quot;season one&quot; became available on DVD. Characters Jonny, Hadji, and Jessie are now older teenagers, and Dr. Quest&#x27;s compound has moved from TK to a rocky island off the coast of Maine.

Rumors of a problem-laden production surrounded this series since 1992. When finally broadcast, it featured two different versions of its own Quest-ian universe: the first batch of episodes (referred to as the &quot;season one&quot; episodes) gave the team a futuristic look; while the second batch (referred to as &quot;season two&quot;) harkened to original episodes from the 1960s. Several &quot;season one&quot; - and a few &quot;season two&quot; - adventures in this series took place in a cyberspace realm known as &quot;Questworld&quot;, depicted using 3-D computer animation. Both &quot;seasons&quot; aired during the same 1996–1997 television season. The show was canceled after 52 episodes (26 of each season), and plans for a live-action movie (to debut following the series premiere) never materialized.

Dr. Zin never appeared or was mentioned in Season 1, the series instead focusing on new recurring villains Jeremiah Surd and Ezekiel Rage mostly. However, the creators felt this series failed to capture enough of the spirit of the original, so they brought Zin back (second-season, episode &quot;Nemesis&quot;), revealing himself very much alive to Quest, as he holds a NASA station hostage amid the launching of a new satellite.

==Other media==
===Feature film===
In the early 1990s, Turner planned a &quot;Year of &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;&quot; marketing campaign to feature a new television series, the release of classic episodes on VHS, the creation of two new animated movies in classic continuity (&quot;Jonny&#x27;s Golden Quest&quot; and &quot;Jonny Quest versus The Cyber Insects&quot;), and the production of a live-action film. Director Richard Donner, producer Lauren Shuler Donner, and Jane Rosenthal optioned the rights for the live action film, having expressed interest in the property soon after Turner&#x27;s acquisition of Hanna-Barbera. Slated to begin production in mid-1995 with a screenplay written by Fred Dekker, and a screen test trailer video was made as an audition for improving the interest but filming was pushed back to 1996 and ultimately never began. By early 1996, the project had already fallen well-behind development of other films, such as a live-action &quot;Jetsons&quot; movie.

Zac Efron and Dwayne &quot;the Rock&quot; Johnson were reported in 2009 to have been cast as Jonny Quest and Race Bannon in an upcoming live action movie, respectively, according to a Moviehole.com interview with Johnson.

In May 2015, it was announced that Robert Rodriguez would direct a live-action version from a script co-written by Rodriguez and Terry Rossio. Adrian Askarieh has stated to IGN that the film will be Indiana Jones meets James Bond with a PG rating.

In July 2016, Forbes reported that the film would start a franchise with the script written by Rodriguez and Rossio and with either Joe Cornish, Justin Lin or Scott Derrickson as director. The film will position Jonny as a &quot;Harry Potter inside an Indiana Jones movie&quot; and specifically set up the potential for spinoffs. The script also took inspiration from a few specific stories and elements in the original 1960s TV show. The site reported that the studio was considering actors Idris Elba, Bradley Cooper and Will Smith for the role of Race Bannon.

In November 2018, Warner Bros. announced that the movie would be directed by Chris McKay. In 2021, McKay said that a script for the film has been turned in, but the studio has yet to given the film the greenlight.

===Comic books===
A &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; comic book (a retelling of the first TV episode, &quot;Mystery of the Lizard Men&quot;) was published by Gold Key Comics in 1964. &quot;Huckleberry Hound Weekly&quot; included original Jonny Quest stories from 1965-1967. began publication of a &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; series in 1986, with the first issue featuring Doug Wildey&#x27;s artwork. The series was written by William Messner-Loebs and ran for 31 issues, with 2 specials and 3 &quot;classic&quot; issues drawn by Wildey retelling &quot;Quest&quot; TV episodes (&quot;Shadow of the Condor&quot;, &quot;Calcutta Adventure&quot;, and &quot;Werewolf of the Timberland&quot;). Wildey drew several additional covers, as did Steve Rude and Dave Stevens. The series also spun off a 3-issue series named &quot;Jezebel Jade&quot; – drawn by Adam Kubert – which told the story of Jade&#x27;s relationship and adventures with Race Bannon. Jonny and the gang (including Dr. Zin) returned to comic book form in May 2015 when they joined the Mystery Machine gang in DC Comics&#x27; 10th newsstand edition of Scooby-Doo Team-Up. In 2016, DC comics announced &quot;Future Quest&quot;, a series featuring Jonny Quest and a variety of other Hanna-Barbera characters. Jonny Quest has a crossover with Adam Strange in &quot;Adam Strange/Future Quest Annual&quot; #1 on March 29, 2017. On October 13, 2023, it was announced a new &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; comic from Dynamite Entertainment is in the works.

===Computer games===
In 1991, Hi-Tec Software published &quot;Jonny Quest in Doctor Zin&#x27;s Underworld&quot;, a licensed &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; platform game for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64 home computers.

In 1993, Hollyware Entertainment published &quot;Jonny Quest: Curse of the Mayan Warriors&quot;, a licensed DOS title available only on 3.5&quot; floppy disk. The pre-release title was &quot;Jonny Quest and the Splinter of Heaven&quot;.

In 1996, Virgin Interactive published &quot;Jonny Quest: Cover-Up at Roswell&quot; for Windows 3.1 and Windows 95.

===Reception===
In January 2009, IGN named &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; as the 77th best in its &quot;Top 100 Animated TV Shows&quot;.

===Music===
Powerglove covered the theme song to &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; on their album &quot;Saturday Morning Apocalypse&quot;.

The Reverend Horton Heat performed a version of the &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; theme music (paired with the tune &quot;Stop That Pigeon&quot;) on &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, which is a tribute album of songs from Saturday morning children&#x27;s television shows and cartoons (mostly) from the 1960s and 1970s, released in 1995 by MCA.

The music group &quot;The Swingtips&quot; recorded a version of the original &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; series theme for their 2007 album &quot;Roswell&quot;.

===Direct-to-video film===
On June 23, 2015, characters from &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; starred in a crossover animated direct-to-video film with &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; entitled, &quot;Tom and Jerry: Spy Quest&quot;.

===Fanzines===
The fanzine &quot;Jonny Quest Adventurezine&quot; was published in 1979 by Cornell Kimball.

==Parodies and homages==
The characters and setting of &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; have frequently been the subject of brief parodies, especially in later animated programs, some of which have aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim late-night programming block. WarnerMedia owns both Cartoon Network and the rights to the entire Hanna-Barbera library, including &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;. In addition, there have been several substantial references to the show:

* Dr. Benton Quest appears in a cameo role during the end-credit sequence of &quot;Scoob!&quot;
* In &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; TV movie &quot;Channel Chasers&quot;, &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; is parodied as &quot;Jonny Hunt&quot;.
* The cast from &quot;Quest&quot; can be seen on several episodes of &quot;Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated&quot;. There are several episodes that bring in several characters such as Race and Dr. Quest, also making use of some &quot;Quest&quot; settings.
* Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; features characters who are satirical analogues of the &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; cast: Dr. Thaddeus &quot;Rusty&quot; Venture, his bodyguard Brock Samson, and his sons Hank and Dean. Flashbacks reveal that Rusty is himself the son of a Benton Quest analog, now coasting on the fame of his late father. During the first season, the creators of the show realized that Cartoon Network&#x27;s parent owned &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; and began using the actual characters, including Jonny as a paranoid drug addict severely damaged by the constant danger his father put him in, Race Bannon as a government intelligence operative, and Hadji as a hard-working competent engineer for Rusty&#x27;s successful brother Jonas Jr. Starting with the third season, the &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; characters were renamed: Jonny was renamed &quot;Action Johnny&quot;, Race Bannon was referred to as &quot;Red&quot; and Dr. Zin was called &quot;Dr. Z&quot;. There was no in-show explanation for the change.
* Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; features the cast in several bizarre parody episodes. In &quot;Bannon Custody Battle&quot;, Bannon and Dr. Quest fight for custody of Jonny and Hadji, and in &quot;Return of Birdgirl&quot;, Bannon and Dr. Quest apply for a same-sex marriage. Other episodes featured the Lizard Men from &quot;Mystery of the Lizard Men&quot;, the mummy from &quot;Curse of Anubis&quot;, a yeti from &quot;Monsters in the Monastery&quot;, a gargoyle from &quot;The House of the Seven Gargoyles&quot;, the robotic spider from &quot;The Robot Spy&quot;, and others.
* Jonny Quest, Hadji, and Dr. Benton Quest appeared in &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot; a &quot;Family Guy&quot; direct-to-video movie. 
* An eight-minute parody appeared in 1995 on the animated series &quot;Freakazoid&quot;, under the title &quot;Toby Danger&quot;, featuring the voices of Scott Menville, Don Messick (in his last role before he died), and Granville Van Dusen (all of whom provided voices for the original series). It was written by Tom Minton as a twelve-minute stand-alone short for &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, but edited by director Eric Radomski to fit into the available &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; time slot.
* Jonny Quest appears in the background in a &quot;South Park&quot; made-for-TV movie called &quot;&quot;.
* Matt Fraction&#x27;s spy-fi comic book series &quot;Casanova&quot; features a genius villain going by the name of Sabine Seychelle, who works with a large Indian bodyguard named Samir. Fraction describes his inspiration in the text column at the end of &quot;Casanova&quot; No. 4: &quot;I liked the idea of Jonny Quest, all adult and crooked. The son of an adventure scientist and his bePolo&#x27;d sidekick would grow up...how, exactly? Bent, I supposed. Weeeird. The kind of guy that would create phenomenal machines...and then sleep with them three at a time&quot;.
* In the Less Than Jake song &quot;Johnny Quest Thinks We&#x27;re Sellouts&quot;, Johnny Quest is the name of a disgruntled fan accusing the band of selling out to corporations, which would jeopardize their ska influence and result in their records and concert ticket prices increasing. The idea for the song came from a friend of member Chris DeMakes who went by the nickname &quot;Johnny Quest&quot; frivolously writing down &quot;Less Than Jake are sellouts&quot; in his office.
* Brazilian pop rock band Jota Quest is named after the series. Originally, they performed under the name &quot;J. Quest&quot;, but to avoid legal conflict with Hanna-Barbera, the &quot;J.&quot; was expanded to &quot;Jota&quot; (the Portuguese name for the letter &quot;J&quot;) from their second album onward.
* The Indianapolis-based punk band Racebannon takes its name from the &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; character.
* Clips from the show are also shown on the television the Parrs watch in the 2018 film &quot;Incredibles 2&quot;.

<doc id="304125" wikidata="Q1841331" url="?curid=304125" title="City Circle">
<text>The City Circle is a mostly-underground railway line located in the Sydney central business district and Haymarket, in New South Wales, Australia, that forms the core of Sydney&#x27;s passenger rail network. The lines are owned by the Transport Asset Holding Entity, a State government agency, and operated under Transport for NSW&#x27;s Sydney Trains brand. Despite its name, the City Circle is of a horseshoe shape, with trains operating in a U-shaped pattern. The constituent stations of the Circle are (clockwise): Central, Town Hall, Wynyard, Circular Quay, St James, Museum and back to Central.

==History and description==
The original concept for the City Railway was part of a report dated 1915 submitted to the government by chief railway engineer, John Bradfield, upon his return from overseas study, with work commencing the following year. His concepts were largely based on the New York City Subway, which he observed during his time in New York City.

Built in stages, the first City Circle stations to open were the heritage-listed Museum and St James, which both opened in 1926 as part of the initial electrification of Sydney railways. Next was the &quot;western limb&quot; through Town Hall and Wynyard, which opened in 1932 in conjunction with the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. This section contains four tunnels. Two connected to the Harbour Bridge, while the two City Circle tunnels terminated at Wynyard. In 1956, the dead ends at St. James and Wynyard were joined and the &quot;missing link&quot;, Circular Quay – was opened. Central and Circular Quay stations are above-ground (Circular Quay is elevated, directly underneath the Cahill Expressway), while the remainder are underground. Several unused railway tunnels also exist. The former tram tunnels at Wynyard, and other stub tunnels at St James are well known.

The City Circle is double track throughout, although it forms four tracks at Central as there are two ends of the same track. The outer track is known as the &quot;City Outer&quot; and is used by trains travelling clockwise around the City Circle. In the direction of travel it passes through Central platform 17, Town Hall platform 6, Wynyard platform 6, Circular Quay platform 2, St James platform 2, Museum platform 2. Trains can then either proceed to Central platform 22 or 23, depending on which line they are running on. Similarly, the inner track is known as the &quot;City Inner&quot; and is used by trains travelling anti-clockwise. It starts from Central platform 20 or 21, again depending on which line a train is coming from. It then passes through Museum platform 1, St James platform 1, Circular Quay platform 1, Wynyard platform 5, Town Hall platform 1 then Central platform 19.

==Services and operations==

The current service patterns generally consist of trains from the Inner West &amp; Leppington Line running into the City Circle Outer, becoming Airport &amp; South Line trains as they enter the circle. Conversely, trains from the Airport &amp; South Line generally run into the City Circle Inner, becoming Inner West &amp; Leppington Line trains. Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line trains also operate via the City Circle Inner. A set of flying junctions at Central enable these patterns to be varied.

Prior to the integration of the Eastern Suburbs line into the Illawarra Line in 1980, Illawarra line trains also operated around the City Circle.

Trains on the Western and Northern lines usually do not use the City Circle but instead, proceed across the Harbour Bridge to the North Shore line and vice versa.

=== Speed control and reduced overlap ===
&quot;For more information about signalling, see Australian railway signalling&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Up until the City Circle Resignalling of the 1990s, the western stations of the line were signalling such that a following train could enter the platform while the previous train was still departing. The signal granting access to the platform would show a restrictive aspect (probably calling-on - red over red over small amber - which indicates that the train can proceed but the block is not necessarily clear) and train stops spread along the platform would control the speed of the following train. This allowed these stations to deal with 42 trains per hour in either direction provided sub 40 second dwell times. The 1990s resignalling changed the older eastern stations to follow a similar operation. At some point the system was changed again to provide additional safety. Signals on the City Circle can no longer display a calling-on aspect, but can display low-speed (red over red over small green - which means that the block is clear but to proceed slowly, not exceeding ). Consequently, trains can no longer enter the platform while a previous train is departing and the system cannot handle more than 20 trains per hour.
=== Stations ===
The line has six stations.

<text>In video gaming, a fan translation is an unofficial translation of a video game made by fans.

The fan translation practice grew with the rise of video game console emulation in the late 1990s. A community of people developed that were interested in replaying and modifying the games they played in their youth. The knowledge and tools that came out of this community allowed them to work with translators to localize video game titles that had never been available outside of their original country of origin.

Fan translations of video game console games are usually accomplished by modifying a single binary ROM image of the game. Fan translations of PC games, on the other hand, can involve translation of many binary files throughout the game&#x27;s directory which are packaged and distributed as fan patch. In dealing with translations of console games, a console emulator is generally utilized to play the final product, although unofficial hardware, hardware mods or software mods can be used to run the translated ROM image on its native hardware.

==Purpose==
The central focus of the fan translation community is historically of Japanese-exclusive computer and video games being made playable in English for the first time, and sometimes of games recently released in Japan that are import-worthy and are unlikely to be officially localized to English-speaking countries. It has since expanded to include other languages as well. Fan translations to English have provided a starting point for translations to many other languages.

Fan translations may also be done to titles that have received official localizations that fans perceive as flawed; for example, if the game had controversial content removed (such as &quot;Bionic Commando&quot;), or there were unnecessary changes in plot and character names (such as &quot;Phantasy Star&quot;).

Some already translated RPGs are available on reproduction cartridges to play on the real hardware for some systems like the SNES.

==Origins==
The earliest English fan translations were done by Oasis, a group formed by Dennis Lardenoye and Ron Bouwland, two Dutch fans of the MSX system. Konami&#x27;s RPG &quot;SD Snatcher&quot; was translated in April 1993, and &quot;Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes&quot; was translated in 1995. Their other projects include &quot;Fray&quot;, &quot;Rune Master 3&quot;, &quot;Xak - The Art of Visual Stage&quot;, &quot;Xak 2&quot;, &quot;Xak - The Tower of Gazzel&quot;, &quot;Ys&quot;, &quot;Ys II: The Final Chapter&quot; and &quot;Wanderers From Ys&quot;.

In Korea, many fan translations of games made by &quot;ELF Corporation&quot; were produced for DOS PCs, starting around 1996. These patches were successful and ELF hired some of the translations teams for official Korean releases later on.

These were possible before emulation on PCs became popular (or even adequate enough to play games) because the games were on floppy disks, and were therefore easier to distribute to the users, in comparison to ROM cartridges used by video game consoles (the MSX also used cartridges, but methods were discovered to copy the content onto floppy disks and other media too).

==Revival after emulation==
The development of console emulators led to access to foreign video games. A revival began in 1996 when a group calling themselves Kowasu Ku formed under the lead of one &quot;Hazama&quot;. The group stated plans to translate &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, but their efforts were never publicly released. Later that summer, a user called &quot;Demi&quot; announced work on a &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; translation and founded Multiple Demiforce. It was eventually dropped in favor of &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; (NES), a more manageable goal at that time. &quot;Demi&quot; and &quot;Som2Freak&quot; used Pasofami to post four screenshots of their work to Archaic Ruins, an emulation website. Shortly after, the translation stalled and the group disbanded.

Derrick Sobodash (Shadow) and David Timko both saw the Archaic Ruins website and contacted Som2Freak expressing interest in translating &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;. He provided each with some primitive tools, and for the next few months, Shadow and Timko worked against each other. Both projects generated renewed interest in fan translation.

After months of working against each other, Shadow and Timko began cooperating. RPGe, the first major translation group was established on July 8 in the #ff5e IRC channel, on the EsperNet IRC network by Shadow, Timko, Hooie and Thermopyle. The start of RPGe sparked many other efforts to unify and within months, Translation Corporation, DeJap Translations and Starsoft Translations had formed.

RPGe&#x27;s translation of &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; was completed October 16, 1997 (version 0.96).

Notable fan translations include that of &quot;Mother 3&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest X&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; through &quot;VI&quot;, &quot;Seiken Densetsu 3&quot;, &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot;, &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Challenge&quot;, &quot;Clock Tower: The First Fear&quot;, &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;, &quot;Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Another Story&quot;, &quot;Ace Attorney Investigations 2&quot; and &quot;The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures&quot;, &quot;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot; through &quot;The Binding Blade&quot; as well as &quot;New Mystery of the Emblem&quot;, &quot;For the Frog the Bell Tolls&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix&quot;, &quot;Front Mission: Gun Hazard&quot;, &quot;Live A Live&quot;, &quot;Ripened Tingle&#x27;s Balloon Trip of Love&quot;, and &quot;Policenauts&quot;.

==Legal issues==

It is unusual for copyright holders to object to fan translations. This is probably largely because the electronic games in question are generally not considered commercially viable in the target language, so the translation is rarely seen as a source of lost revenue.

In 1999, one well-known incident in which copyright holders took action involved the translation of a Windows game maker called &quot;RPG Maker 95&quot;. The Japanese company ASCII had their lawyers send a cease and desist e-mail to the translation group KanjiHack Translations, but unlike most translation groups, KanjiHack was caught linking to a site to illegally download the entire then-recently released RPG Maker 95 software (including a copy-protection crack). The group shut down immediately but others eventually finished the project. Titles from the &quot;RPG Maker&quot; series were eventually localized and officially released in the US for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2.

In 2014, publisher Square Enix issued a cease and desist order to Sky, a romhacker who had completed a highly anticipated fan translation of the PSP game &quot;Final Fantasy Type 0&quot;, soon after they announced an HD version of the game for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. This forced him to remove all posts and pages pertaining to the project (which were eventually restored months later). Sky claimed that Square Enix had made &quot;threats and false accusations&quot;. According to Kotaku, Sky had released the translation early against the team&#x27;s wishes, possibly to preempt any legal action following a localization announcement at E3, and Square Enix may have been forced to announce the HD version prematurely as a reaction to the patch&#x27;s release.

In September 2022, translation group ZeroField, responsible for English translation spreadsheet and overlays for &quot;Trails&quot; games, received a cease and desist order from NIS America.

A popular belief in the fan translation community is that distributing only a binary patch, which must be applied to the full, original game, is legal. The reasoning is that the patch only contains the new data and directives for where it is to be placed, and does not have the original copyrighted material included in any form, and therefore it is useless unless the user applies it to a (copyrighted) ROM, the acquisition and legality of which they are left completely accountable for. This belief is untested in court. Regardless, the patch must still contain a translated script that is derived from the copyrighted script of the original, but this anti-software piracy attitude by the fan translation community may have convinced copyright holders to, by and large, turn a blind eye.

There have never been any legal cases involving fan translation issues, and such projects have been relatively widespread over the Internet for years. In recent years, anime fansubbers have started to attract the attention of some American anime distributors; as of 2004 one manga scanlator has been handed a cease and desist by a Japanese company, but most of this attention has been restricted to polite entreaties asking fan translators to refrain from dealing with licensed material. As with the fansub and scanlation scenes, most sites devoted to translation hacks will not acknowledge projects that compete with commercially available localizations, and respected groups will generally attempt to steer clear of projects that may see localization.

An article of Helbraun law firm remarks in the context of fan translations that redistributing complete games with adaptions most likely does not fall under fair use, while in patch form it might fall under fair use, but this was never tested in court.

==Game company acknowledgments==
In July 2007, RPGamer released an interview they did with Koichiro Sakamoto, a game producer from Square Enix, acknowledging fan translations:
&quot;On a similar note, we told Mr. Sakamoto that a fan translation had been done some years ago for &quot;Front Mission 1&quot;, and asked how he felt about such efforts. The producer replied that he actually found them very encouraging – it&#x27;s something the developers should be doing, but because they&#x27;re not, the fans are doing it instead. He stated that he&#x27;d like to be able to give something back to the fans, and would like to thank personally each of the fans that worked on the translation&quot;. Clyde Mandelin, a professional localizer and lead of the &quot;Mother 3&quot; fan translation project, received letters of thanks from employees of major game development companies for his translation work.

In 2010, publisher Xseed Games licensed and paid for the use of a fan translation of &quot;&quot; (PC) in the PSP port in order to offset the localization costs of such a &quot;niche&quot; game.

In 2010, Rising Star Games teamed up with Spanish fans of &quot;Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon&quot; to translate the game&#x27;s script.

In 2011, adult visual novel publisher 0verflow acknowledged the fan translation group (which later established itself as a publisher) Sekai Project and its efforts to localize &quot;School Days&quot;. Eventually, American bishoujo game publisher JAST USA licensed the game and paid for the use of Sekai Project&#x27;s work in their release, offsetting the localization costs in a similar manner. JAST USA also licensed Xuse&#x27;s &quot;Aselia the Eternal&quot; and paid the fan translation group Dakkodango Translations for use of their translation.

In 2010, the Japanese game company Minori sent two cease and desist emails to No Name Losers, a fan group that worked on an unauthorized translation patch of their game &quot;&quot;, but a partnership between Minori, No Name Losers, and American game publisher MangaGamer was later negotiated to allow the official release of Minori&#x27;s games in English.

In 2021, NIS America reached an agreement with the fan translation group Geofront to use the latter&#x27;s translations of &quot;The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Heroes: Trails to Azure&quot; as a basis for official releases.

==Gaming culture and learning==
While many studies covering fan translation examine the more technical aspects of extracting the text and manipulating it to translate it, some others focus on the literacy and language related practices gamers develop through their engagement in the fan translation of games. They adopt many roles, acquire and put into practice not only IT skills but also linguistic and sociocultural skills, and maintain interesting conversations online with fellow gamers that lead to meaningful and situated metalinguistic discussions on language chunks and translation strategies.

<text>A core-based statistical area (CBSA) is a U.S. geographic area defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). It contains a large population nucleus, or urban area, and adjacent communities that have a high degree of integration with that nucleus.

On July 15, 2015, the OMB released new standards based on the 2010 census. These standards are used to replace the definitions of metropolitan areas from the 2010 United States census data.

==Definition==
The term &quot;CBSA&quot; refers collectively to both metropolitan statistical areas and micropolitan areas. Micropolitan areas are based on Census Bureau-defined urban clusters of at least 10,000 and fewer than 50,000 people.

The basic definition of metropolitan areas was changed in 2003. A metropolitan area, as it did in 1990, requires a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area of at least 50,000 people. A metropolitan statistical area containing an urbanized area of at least 2.5 million people can be subdivided into two or more &quot;metropolitan divisions&quot;, provided specified criteria are met. Metropolitan divisions are conceptually similar to the primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) defined under previous standards.

Similarly, there are now definitions for combined statistical areas (CSAs). These areas can be formed when adjoining CBSAs meet particular standards to become new areas. Any combination of metro and micro areas may be used to form a CSA.

The metropolitan areas in New England became county-based, consistent with the rest of the U.S. Previously, these were referred to by the Census Bureau as New England county metropolitan areas (NECMA) and were separate from the normal census counts for the areas, based on cities and towns. They have essentially swapped places now, with the city and town areas (or NECTAs, for New England city and town areas) being the separate listings.

Not much changed in the basic definition, but 49 new metropolitan areas were formed. Over 550 other areas were classified as micropolitan. The rules have defined 935 CBSAs in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Eleven of the CBSAs have metropolitan divisions, 29 in total. In comparison, the definition of metropolitan areas in 1999, the last year areas were formed based on the 1990 rules for them, has 284 metropolitan areas, with 19 of the areas providing 76 primary metropolitan areas (the equivalent of divisions). Almost three times the number of areas overall are recognized by the OMB.

<text>Local coordinates are the ones used in a &quot;local coordinate system&quot; or a &quot;local coordinate space&quot;. Simple examples:

* Houses. In order to work in a house construction, the measurements are referred to a control arbitrary point that will allow to check it: stick/sticks on the ground, steel bar, nails...
* Addresses. Using house numbers to locate a house on a street; the street is a local coordinate system within a larger system composed of city townships, states, countries, postal codes, etc.

Local systems exist for convenience. On ancient times, every work was made on relative bases as there was no conception of global systems. Practically, it is better to use local systems for small works as houses, buildings... For most of the applications, it is desired the position of one element relative to one building or location, and in a more local way, relative to one furniture or person. In a regular way, you will not give your position by geographical coordinates rather than &quot;I am 15 meters away of the entry to the building&quot;. So it is a pretty common way to locate things.

It is possible to bring latitude and longitude for all terrestrial locations, but unless one has a highly precise GPS device or you make astronomical observations, this is impractical. It is much simple to use a tape, a rope, a chain... The position information (global) should be transformed into a location. Position refers to a numeric or symbolic description within a spatial reference system, where as location refers to information about surrounding objects and their interrelationships. (Topological space)

== Use ==
In computer graphics and computer animation, local coordinate spaces are also useful for their ability to model independently transformable aspects of geometrical scene graphs. When modeling a car, for example, it is desirable to describe the center of each wheel with respect to the car&#x27;s coordinate system, but then specify the shape of each wheel in separate local spaces centered about these points. This way, the information describing each wheel can be simply duplicated four times, and independent transformations (e.g., steering rotation) can be similarly effected. Bounding volumes of objects may be described more accurately using extents in the local coordinates, (i.e. an object oriented bounding box, contrasted with the simpler axis aligned bounding box). The trade-off for this flexibility is additional computational cost: the rendering system must access the higher-level coordinate system of the car and combine it with the space of each wheel in order to draw everything in its proper place.

Local coordinates also afford digital designers a means around the finite limits of numerical representation. The tread marks on a tire, for example, can be described using millimeters by allowing the whole tire to occupy the entire range of numeric precision available. The larger aspects of the car, such as its frame, might be described in centimeters, and the terrain that the car travels on could be specified in meters.

In differential topology, local coordinates on a manifold are defined by means of an atlas of charts. The basic idea behind coordinate charts is that each small patch of a manifold can be endowed with a set of local coordinates. These are collected together into an atlas, and stitched together in such a way that they are self-consistent on the manifold.

In Cartography and Maps, the traditional way of works are local datum. With a local datum the land can be mapped on relative small areas as a country. With the need of global systems, the transformations on between datum became a problem, so geodetic datum have been created. More than 150 local datum have been used in the world.

<text>Jewish history is the history of the Jews, their nation, religion, and culture, as it developed and interacted with other peoples, religions, and cultures.

Jews originated from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah, two related kingdoms that emerged in the Levant during the Iron Age. Although the earliest mention of Israel is inscribed on the Merneptah Stele around 1213–1203 BCE, religious literature tells the story of Israelites going back at least as far as c. 1500 BCE. The name &#x27;Israel&#x27; is derived from the Hebrew patriarch Jacob, who was given the name after wrestling with an angel, meaning &#x27;he who struggles with God&#x27;. The Kingdom of Israel fell to the Neo-Assyrian Empire in around 720 BCE, and the Kingdom of Judah to the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE. Part of the Judean population was exiled to Babylon. The Assyrian and Babylonian captivities are regarded as representing the start of the Jewish diaspora.

After the Persian Achaemenid Empire conquered the region, the exiled Jews were allowed to return and rebuild the temple; these events mark the beginning of the Second Temple period. After several centuries of foreign rule, the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom, but it was gradually incorporated into Roman rule. The Jewish-Roman wars, a series of unsuccessful revolts against the Romans in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple, and the expulsion of many Jews. The Jewish population in Syria Palaestina gradually decreased during the following centuries, enhancing the role of the Jewish diaspora and shifting the spiritual and demographic centre from the depopulated Judea to Galilee and then to Babylon, with smaller communities spread out across the Roman Empire. During the same period, the Mishnah and the Talmud, central Jewish texts, were composed. In the following millennia, the diaspora communities coalesced into three major ethnic subdivisions according to where their ancestors settled: the &quot;Ashkenazim&quot; (Central and Eastern Europe), the &quot;Sephardim&quot; (initially in the Iberian Peninsula), and the &quot;Mizrahim&quot; (Middle East and North Africa).

Byzantine rule over the Levant was lost in the 7th century as the newly established Islamic Caliphate expanded into the Eastern Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, North Africa, and later into the Iberian Peninsula. Jewish culture enjoyed a golden age in Spain, with Jews becoming widely accepted in society and their religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed. However, in 1492 the Jews were forced to leave Spain and migrated in great numbers to the Ottoman Empire and Italy. Between the 12th and 15th centuries, Ashkenazi Jews experienced extreme persecution in Central Europe, which prompted their mass migration to Poland. The 18th century saw the rise of the Haskalah intellectual movement. Also starting in the 18th century, Jews began to campaign for Jewish emancipation from restrictive laws and integration into the wider European society.

In the 19th century, when Jews in Western Europe were increasingly granted equality before the law, Jews in the Pale of Settlement faced growing persecution, legal restrictions and widespread pogroms. During the 1870s and 1880s, the Jewish population in Europe began to more actively discuss emigration to Ottoman Syria with the aim of re-establishing a Jewish polity in Palestine. The Zionist movement was officially founded in 1897. The pogroms also triggered a mass exodus of more than two million Jews to the United States between 1881 and 1924. The Jews of Europe and the United States gained success in the fields of science, culture and the economy. Among those generally considered the most famous were Albert Einstein and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Many Nobel Prize winners at this time were Jewish, as is still the case.

In 1933, with the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany, the Jewish situation became severe. Economic crises, racial antisemitic laws, and a fear of an upcoming war led many to flee from Europe to Mandatory Palestine, to the United States and to the Soviet Union. In 1939, World War II began and until 1941 Hitler occupied almost all of Europe. In 1941, following the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Final Solution began, an extensive organized operation on an unprecedented scale, aimed at the annihilation of the Jewish people, and resulting in the persecution and murder of Jews in Europe and North Africa. In Poland, three million were murdered in gas chambers in all concentration camps combined, with one million at the Auschwitz camp complex alone. This genocide, in which approximately six million Jews were methodically exterminated, is known as the Holocaust.

Before and during the Holocaust, enormous numbers of Jews immigrated to Mandatory Palestine. On May 14, 1948, upon the termination of the British Mandate, David Ben-Gurion declared the creation of the State of Israel, a Jewish and democratic state in &quot;Eretz Israel&quot; (Land of Israel). Immediately afterwards, all neighbouring Arab states invaded, yet the newly formed IDF resisted. In 1949, the war ended and Israel started building the state and absorbing massive waves of Aliyah from all over Europe and Middle Eastern countries. Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a population of 9.6 million people, of whom 7 million are Jewish. The largest Jewish community outside Israel is the United States, while large communities also exist in France, Canada, Argentina, Russia, United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany. For statistics related to modern Jewish demographics, see &quot;Jewish population&quot;.

==Overview==

Ancient Jewish history is known from the Bible, extra-biblical sources, apocrypha and pseudepigrapha, the writings of Josephus, Greco-Roman authors and church fathers, as well as archaeological finds, inscriptions, ancient documents (such as the Papyri from Elephantine and the Fayyum, the Dead Sea scrolls, the Bar Kokhba letters, the Babatha Archives and the Cairo Genizah documents) supplemented by oral history and the collection of commentaries in the Midrash and Talmud.

With the rise of the printing press and movable type in the early modern period, Jewish histories and early editions of the Torah/Tanakh were published which dealt with the history of the Jewish religion, and increasingly, national histories of the Jews, Jewish peoplehood and identity. This was a move from a manuscript or scribal culture to a printing culture. Jewish historians wrote accounts of their collective experiences, but also increasingly used history for political, cultural, and scientific or philosophical exploration. Writers drew upon a corpus of culturally inherited text in seeking to construct a logical narrative to critique or advance the state of the art. Modern Jewish historiography intertwines with intellectual movements such as the European Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment but drew upon earlier works in the Late Middle Ages and into diverse sources in antiquity. Today, the history of the Jews and Judaism is often divided into six periods:

# Ancient Israel and Judah (c. 1200–586 BCE)
# Second Temple period (c. 516 BCE–70 CE)
# Rabbinic or Talmudic period (70–640 CE)
# Middle Ages (640–1492)
# Early Modern period (1492–1750)
# Modern period (1750–20th century)
# Zionism, the Holocaust and the establishment of Israel (19th–21st centuries)
==Ancient Israel (1500–586 BCE)==
=== The early Israelites ===

The history of the early Jews, and their neighbours, centres on the Fertile Crescent and east coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It begins among those people who occupied the area lying between the river Nile and Mesopotamia. Surrounded by ancient seats of culture in Egypt and Babylonia, by the deserts of Arabia, and by the highlands of Asia Minor, the land of Canaan (roughly corresponding to modern Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Jordan, and Lebanon) was a meeting place of civilizations.

The earliest recorded evidence of a people by the name of Israel appears in the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt, dated to about 1200 BCE. According to the modern archaeological account, the Israelites and their culture branched out of the Canaanite peoples and their cultures through the development of a distinct monolatristic—and later monotheistic—religion centred on the national god Yahweh. They spoke an archaic form of the Hebrew language, known today as Biblical Hebrew.

The traditional religious view of Jews and Judaism of their own history was based on the narrative of the ancient Hebrew Bible. In this view, Abraham, signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the Jews and the father of Judaism, is the first Jew. Later, Isaac was born to Abraham, and Jacob was born to Isaac. Following a struggle with an angel, Jacob was given the name Israel. Following a severe drought, Jacob and his twelve sons fled to Egypt, where they eventually formed the Twelve Tribes of Israel. The Israelites were later led out of slavery in Egypt and subsequently brought to Canaan by Moses; they eventually conquered Canaan under the leadership of Joshua.

Modern scholars agree that the Bible does not provide an authentic account of the Israelites&#x27; origins; the consensus supports that the archaeological evidence showing largely indigenous origins of Israel in Canaan, not Egypt, is &quot;overwhelming&quot; and leaves &quot;no room for an Exodus from Egypt or a 40-year pilgrimage through the Sinai wilderness&quot;. Many archaeologists have abandoned the archaeological investigation of Moses and the Exodus as &quot;a fruitless pursuit&quot;. However, it is accepted that this narrative does have a &quot;historical core&quot; to it. A century of research by archaeologists and Egyptologists has arguably found no evidence that can be directly related to the Exodus narrative of an Egyptian captivity and the escape and travels through the wilderness, leading to the suggestion that Iron Age Israel—the kingdoms of Judah and Israel—has its origins in Canaan, not in Egypt: The culture of the earliest Israelite settlements is Canaanite, their cult-objects are those of the Canaanite god El, the pottery remains in the local Canaanite tradition, and the alphabet used is early Canaanite. The almost sole marker distinguishing the &quot;Israelite&quot; villages from Canaanite sites is an absence of pig bones, although whether this can be taken as an ethnic marker or is due to other factors remains a matter of dispute.

According to the Biblical narrative, the Land of Israel was organized into a confederacy of twelve tribes ruled by a series of Judges for several hundred years.

=== The Kingdoms of Israel and Judah ===

Two Israelite kingdoms emerged during Iron Age II: Israel and Judah. The Bible portrays Israel and Judah as the successors of an earlier United Kingdom of Israel, although its historicity is disputed. Historians and archaeologists agree that the northern Kingdom of Israel existed from 900 BCE and that the Kingdom of Judah existed from 700 BCE. The Tel Dan Stele, discovered in 1993, shows that the kingdom, at least in some form, existed by the middle of the 9th century BCE, but it does not indicate the extent of its power.

Biblical tradition tells that the Israelite monarchy was established in 1037 BCE under Saul, who was anointed by the prophet Samuel, and continued under David and his son, Solomon. David greatly expanded the kingdom&#x27;s borders and conquered Jerusalem from the Jebusites, turning it into the national, political and religious capital of the kingdom. Solomon, his son, later built the First Temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. Upon his death, traditionally dated to c. 930 BCE, a civil war erupted between the ten northern Israelite tribes, and the tribes of Judah (Simeon was absorbed into Judah) and Benjamin in the south. The kingdom then split into the Kingdom of Israel in the north, and the Kingdom of Judah in the south.

The Kingdom of Israel was the more prosperous of the two kingdoms and soon developed into a regional power. During the days of the Omride dynasty, it controlled Samaria, Galilee, the upper Jordan Valley, the Sharon and large parts of the Transjordan. Samaria, the capital, was home to one of the largest Iron Age palaces in the Levant. The kingdom of Israel was destroyed around 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

The Kingdom of Judah, with its capital in Jerusalem, controlled the Judaean Mountains, the Shephelah, the Judaean Desert and parts of the Negev. After the fall of Israel, Judah became a client state of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. In the 7th century BCE, the kingdom&#x27;s population increased greatly, prospering under Assyrian vassalage, despite Hezekiah&#x27;s revolt against the Assyrian king Sennacherib.

Large parts of the Hebrew Bible were written during this period. This includes the earliest portions of Hosea, Isaiah, Amos and Micah, along with Nahum, Zephaniah, most of Deuteronomy, the first edition of the Deuteronomistic history (the books of Joshua/Judges/Samuel/Kings), and Habakkuk.

With the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 605 BCE, a power struggle emerged between Egypt and the Neo-Babylonian Empire for control of the Levant, leading to Judah&#x27;s rapid decline. In 601 BCE, King Jehoiakim of Judah, who had recently submitted to Babylon, rebelled against the empire. He was soon succeeded by his son, Jehoiachin, who continued his father&#x27;s policy and faced a Babylonian invasion. In March 597 BCE, Jehoiachin surrendered to the Babylonians and was taken captive to Babylon. This defeat is documented in the Babylonian Chronicles. Zedekiah, Jehoiachin&#x27;s uncle, was then installed as king by the Babylonians.

In 587 or 586 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II, responding to a second revolt in Judah, besieged and destroyed Jerusalem. The First Temple was razed, and its sacred vessels were seized as spoils. The destruction was followed by a mass exile: the surviving inhabitants of the city, including other segments of the population, were carried off to Mesopotamia, marking the onset of the era known in Jewish history as the &quot;Babylonian Captivity&quot;. Zedekiah himself was captured, blinded, and transported to Babylon. Others fled to Egypt. The people of Judah lost their statehood, and, for those in exile, their homeland. Following the dissolution of the monarchy, the former kingdom was annexed as a province of the Babylonian Empire.

=== The Babylonian captivity (c. 587–538 BCE) ===

During the several decades between the fall of Judah and their return to Zion under Persian rule, Jewish history enters an obscure phase. Many Jews were exiled across Babylonia, Elam, and Egypt, while others remained in Judea. Jeremiah refers to communities in Egypt, including settlements in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and Pathros. Moreover, a Jewish military colony existed at Elephantine, established before the exile, where they built their own shrine. Deuteronomy was expanded and earlier scriptures were edited during the exilic period. The first edition of Jeremiah, the Book of Ezekiel, the majority of Obadiah, and what is referred to in research as &quot;Second Isaiah&quot; were all written during this time period as well.

== Second Temple period (538 BCE–70 CE) ==
===Persian period (c. 538–332 BCE)===
According to the Book of Ezra, Persian Cyrus the Great, king of the Achaemenid Empire, brought an end to the Babylonian exile in 538 BCE, a year after his conquest of Babylon. The return from exile was led by Zerubbabel, a prince from the royal line of David, and Joshua the Priest, descended from former High Priests of the Temple. They oversaw the construction of the Second Temple, completed between 521 and 516 BCE. As part of the Persian Empire, the former Kingdom of Judah became the province of Judah (&quot;Yehud Medinata&quot;) with different borders, covering a smaller territory. Contemporary scholars point to a gradual return process that extended into the late 6th and early 5th centuries BCE. The population of Persian Judah was greatly reduced from that of the kingdom, archaeological surveys showing a population of around 30,000 people in the 5th to 4th centuries BCE.

The final Torah is widely seen as a product of the Persian period (539–333 BCE, probably 450–350 BCE). This consensus echoes a traditional Jewish view which gives Ezra, the leader of the Jewish community on its return from Babylon, a pivotal role in its promulgation.

Three prophets, considered the last in Jewish tradition, were active during this period: Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. After the death of the last Jewish prophet and while still under Persian rule, the leadership of the Jewish people passed into the hands of five successive generations of zugot (&quot;pairs of&quot;) leaders. They flourished first under the Persians and then under the Greeks. As a result, the Pharisees and Sadducees were formed. Under the Persians then under the Greeks, Jewish coins were minted in Judea as Yehud coinage.

===The Hellenistic period (c. 332–110 BCE)===
In 332 BCE, Alexander the Great of Macedon defeated the Persians. After Alexander&#x27;s death and the division of his empire among his generals, the Seleucid Kingdom was formed.

The Alexandrian conquests spread Greek culture to the Levant. During this time, currents of Judaism were influenced by Hellenistic philosophy developed from the 3rd century BCE, notably the Jewish diaspora in Alexandria, culminating in the compilation of the Septuagint. An important advocate of the symbiosis of Jewish theology and Hellenistic thought is Philo.

===The Hasmonean Kingdom (110–63 BCE)===
Triggered by anti-Jewish decrees from Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes and tensions between Hellenized and conservative Jews, the Maccabean Revolt erupted in Judea in 167 BCE under the leadership of Mattathias. His son, Judas Maccabeus, recaptured Jerusalem in 164 BCE, purifying the Second Temple and reinstating sacrificial worship. The successful revolt eventually led to the formation of an independent Jewish state under the Hasmonean dynasty, which lasted from 165 BCE to 63 BCE.

Initially governing as both political leaders and High Priests, the Hasmoneans later assumed the title of kings. They employed military campaigns and diplomacy to consolidate power. Under the rule of Alexander Jannaeus and Salome Alexandra, the kingdom reached its zenith in size and influence. However, internal strife erupted between Salome Alexandra&#x27;s sons, Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, leading to civil war and appeals to Roman authorities for intervention. Responding to these appeals, Pompey led a Roman campaign of conquest and annexation, which marked the end of Hasmonean sovereignty and ushered in Roman rule over Judea.

=== The Roman period (63 BCE – 135 CE) ===
Judea had been an independent Jewish kingdom under the Hasmoneans, but it was conquered and reorganized as a client state by the Roman general Pompey in 63 BCE. Roman expansion was going on in other areas as well, and it would continue for more than a hundred and fifty years. Later, Herod the Great was appointed &quot;King of the Jews&quot; by the Roman Senate, supplanting the Hasmonean dynasty. Some of his offspring held various positions after him, known as the Herodian dynasty. Briefly, from 4 BCE to 6 CE, Herod Archelaus ruled the tetrarchy of Judea as ethnarch, the Romans denying him the title of King.

After the Census of Quirinius in 6 CE, the Roman province of Judaea was formed as a satellite of Roman Syria under the rule of a prefect (as was Roman Egypt) until 41 CE, then procurators after 44 CE. The empire was often callous and brutal in its treatment of its Jewish subjects, (see Anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire). In 30 CE (or 33 CE), Jesus of Nazareth, an itinerant rabbi from Galilee, and the central figure of Christianity, was put to death by crucifixion in Jerusalem under the Roman prefect of Judaea, Pontius Pilate. For a short time Judea was reunited and semi independent under Agrippa the Great who had good relations with both the Roman aristocracy and local Jewish citizens. After his death Judea was again annexed by Rome and his less popular son Herod Agrippa II was made ethnarch.

Roman oppressive rule, combined with economic, religious, and ethnic tensions, eventually led to the outbreak of the First Jewish–Roman War, also known as the Great Revolt, in 66 CE. Future emperor Vespasian quelled the rebellion in Galilee by 67 CE, capturing key strongholds. He was succeeded by his son Titus, who led the brutal siege of Jerusalem, culminating in the city&#x27;s fall in 70 CE. The Romans burned Jerusalem and destroyed the Second Temple. The Roman victory was celebrated with a triumph in Rome, showcasing Jewish artifacts like the menorah, which were then put on display in the new Temple of Peace. The Flavian dynasty leveraged this victory for political gain, erecting monuments in Rome and minting Judaea Capta coins. The war concluded with the siege of Masada (73-74 CE). The Jewish population suffered widespread devastation, with displacement, enslavement, and Roman confiscation of Jewish-owned land.

The destruction of the Second Temple marked a cataclysmic event in Jewish history, triggering far-reaching transformations within Judaism. With the central role of sacrificial worship obliterated, religious practices shifted towards prayer, Torah study, and communal gatherings in synagogues. According to Rabbinic tradition, Yohanan ben Zakkai secured permission from the Romans to establish a center for Torah study in Yavneh, which then served as a focal point for Jewish religious and cultural life for a generation. Judaism also underwent a significant shift away from its sectarian divisions. The Sadducees and Essenes, two prominent sects in the late Second Temple period, faded into obscurity, while the traditions of the Pharisees, including their halakhic interpretations, the centrality of the Oral Torah, and belief in resurrection became the foundation of Rabbinic Judaism.

===The Diaspora during the Second Temple period===

The Jewish diaspora existed well before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE and had been ongoing for centuries, with the dispersal driven by both forced expulsions and voluntary migrations. In Mesopotamia, a testimony to the beginnings of the Jewish community can be found in Joachin&#x27;s ration tablets, listing provisions allotted to the exiled Judean king and his family by Nebuchadnezzar II, and further evidence are the Al-Yahudu tablets, dated to the 6th-5th centuries BCE and related to the exiles from Judea arriving after the destruction of the First Temple, though there is ample evidence for the presence of Jews in Babylonia even from 626 BCE. In Egypt, the documents from Elephantine reveal the trials of a community founded by a Persian Jewish garrison at two fortresses on the frontier during the 5th-4th centuries BCE, and according to Josephus the Jewish community in Alexandria existed since the founding of the city in the 4th century BCE by Alexander the Great. By 200 BCE, there were well established Jewish communities both in Egypt and Mesopotamia (&quot;Babylonia&quot; in Jewish sources) and in the two centuries that followed, Jewish populations were also present in Asia Minor, Greece, Macedonia, Cyrene, and, beginning in the middle of the first century BCE, in the city of Rome.

In the first centuries CE, as a result of the Jewish-Roman Wars, a large number of Jews were taken as captives, sold into slavery, or compelled to flee from the regions affected by the wars, contributing to the formation and expansion of Jewish communities across the Roman Empire as well as in Arabia and Mesopotamia. Jewish communities across Cyrenaica, Cyprus, and Egypt were almost entirely obliterated due to the harsh Roman response to the Diaspora Revolt.

The book of Acts in the New Testament, as well as other Pauline texts, make frequent reference to the large populations of Hellenised Jews in the cities of the Roman world. These Hellenised Jews were affected by the diaspora only in its spiritual sense, absorbing the feeling of loss and homelessness that became a cornerstone of the Jewish creed, much supported by persecutions in various parts of the world. Of critical importance to the reshaping of Jewish tradition from the Temple-based religion to the rabbinic traditions of the Diaspora, was the development of the interpretations of the Torah found in the &quot;Mishnah&quot; and &quot;Talmud.&quot;

== Talmudic period (70–640 CE) ==
=== Diaspora Revolt (115–117 CE) ===
During the Diaspora Revolt (115–117 CE), Jewish diaspora communities across several eastern provinces of the Roman Empire engaged in widespread rebellion. Driven by messianic fervor and hopes for the ingathering of exiles and the reconstruction of the Temple, these communities may have sought to spark a broader movement possibly aimed at returning to Judea and rebuilding Jerusalem. Ancient sources describe the revolt as extremely brutal, with cases of cannibalism and mutilation, though modern scholars often consider these accounts to be exaggerated. The Roman suppression of the revolt was marked by severe measures, including ethnic cleansing, leading to the near-total destruction of Jewish diaspora communities in Libya, Cyprus and Egypt, including the significant and influential community in Alexandria.

=== Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE) ===
From 132 to 136 CE, Judaea was the center of the Bar Kokhba revolt, triggered by Hadrian&#x27;s decision to establish the pagan colony of Aelia Capitolina on the ruins of Jerusalem. Early successes led to the establishment of a short-lived Jewish state in Judea under the leadership of Simon Bar Kokhba, styled as &quot;nasi&quot; or prince of Israel. The rebel state&#x27;s coinage proclaimed &quot;Freedom of Israel&quot; and &quot;For the Freedom of Jerusalem&quot;, using ancient Hebrew script for nationalistic symbolism. However, the Romans soon amassed six legions and additional auxiliaries under Julius Severus, who then brutally crushed the uprising. Historical accounts report the destruction of fifty major strongholds and 985 villages, resulting in 580,000 Jewish deaths and widespread famine and disease. Archaeological research confirms the widespread destruction and depopulation of the Jewish heartland in Judea proper, where most of the Jewish population was either killed, sold into slavery, expelled, or forced to flee. The Romans also suffered heavy losses. Post-revolt, Jews were prohibited from entering Jerusalem, and Hadrian issued religious edicts, including a ban on circumcision, later repealed by Antoninus Pius. The province of Judaea was renamed Syria Palaestina as a punitive act against the Jews, aimed at placating non-Jewish residents and erasing Jewish historical ties to the land. Christians refused to participate in the revolt and from this point the Jews regarded Christianity as a separate religion. A rabbi of this period, Simeon bar Yochai, is regarded as the author of the Zohar, the foundational text for Kabbalistic thought. However, modern scholars believe it was written in Medieval Spain.

=== Late Roman period in the Land of Israel ===
The relations of the Jews with the Roman Empire in the region continued to be complicated. Constantine I allowed Jews to mourn their defeat and humiliation once a year on Tisha B&#x27;Av at the Western Wall. In 351–352 CE, the Jews of Galilee launched yet another revolt, provoking heavy retribution. The Gallus revolt came during the rising influence of early Christians in the Eastern Roman Empire, under the Constantinian dynasty. In 355, however, the relations with the Roman rulers improved, upon the rise of Emperor Julian, the last of the Constantinian dynasty, who unlike his predecessors defied Christianity. In 363, not long before Julian left Antioch to launch his campaign against Sasanian Persia, in keeping with his effort to foster religions other than Christianity, he ordered the Jewish Temple rebuilt. The failure to rebuild the Temple has mostly been ascribed to the dramatic Galilee earthquake of 363 and traditionally also to the Jews&#x27; ambivalence about the project. Sabotage is a possibility, as is an accidental fire. Divine intervention was the common view among Christian historians of the time. Julian&#x27;s support of Jews caused Jews to call him &quot;Julian the Hellene&quot;. Julian&#x27;s fatal wound in the Persian campaign and his consequent death had put an end to Jewish aspirations, and Julian&#x27;s successors embraced Christianity through the entire timeline of Byzantine rule of Jerusalem, preventing any Jewish claims.

In 438 CE, when the Empress Eudocia removed the ban on Jews&#x27; praying at the Temple site, the heads of the Community in Galilee issued a call &quot;to the great and mighty people of the Jews&quot; which began: &quot;Know that the end of the exile of our people has come!&quot; However, the Christian population of the city, who saw this as a threat to their primacy, did not allow it and a riot erupted after which they chased away the Jews from the city.

During the 5th and the 6th centuries, a series of Samaritan insurrections broke out across the Palaestina Prima province. Especially violent were the third and the fourth revolts, which resulted in almost the entire annihilation of the Samaritan community. It is likely that the Samaritan Revolt of 556 was joined by the Jewish community, which had also suffered a brutal suppression of Israelite religion.

In the belief of restoration to come, in the early 7th century the Jews made an alliance with the Persians, who invaded Palaestina Prima in 614, fought at their side, overwhelmed the Byzantine garrison in Jerusalem, and were given Jerusalem to be governed as an autonomy. However, their autonomy was brief: the Jewish leader in Jerusalem was shortly assassinated during a Christian revolt and though Jerusalem was reconquered by Persians and Jews within 3 weeks, it fell into anarchy. With the consequent withdrawal of Persian forces, Jews surrendered to Byzantines in 625 or 628 CE, but were massacred by Christian radicals in 629 CE, with the survivors fleeing to Egypt. The Byzantine (Eastern Roman Empire) control of the region was finally lost to the Muslim Arab armies in 637 CE, when Umar ibn al-Khattab completed the conquest of Akko.

===The Jews of pre-Muslim Babylonia (219–638 CE) ===
After the fall of Jerusalem, Babylonia (modern day Iraq) would become the focus of Judaism for more than a thousand years. The first Jewish communities in Babylonia started with the exile of the Tribe of Judah to Babylon by Jehoiachin in 597 BCE as well as after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 586 BCE. Many more Jews migrated to Babylon in 135 CE after the Bar Kokhba revolt and in the centuries after. Babylonia, where some of the largest and most prominent Jewish cities and communities were established, became the centre of Jewish life all the way up to the 13th century. By the first century, Babylonia already held a speedily growing population of an estimated 1,000,000 Jews, which increased to an estimated 2 million between the years 200 CE and 500 CE, both by natural growth and by immigration of more Jews from Judea, making up about 1/6 of the world Jewish population at that era. It was there that they would write the Babylonian Talmud in the languages used by the Jews of ancient Babylonia: Hebrew and Aramaic. The Jews established Talmudic Academies in Babylonia, also known as the Geonic Academies (&quot;Geonim&quot; meaning &quot;splendour&quot; in Biblical Hebrew or &quot;geniuses&quot;), which became the centre for Jewish scholarship and the development of Jewish law in Babylonia from roughly 500 CE to 1038 CE. The two most famous academies were the Pumbedita Academy and the Sura Academy. Major yeshivot were also located at Nehardea and Mahuza. The Talmudic Yeshiva Academies became a main part of Jewish culture and education, and Jews continued establishing Yeshiva Academies in Western and Eastern Europe, North Africa, and in later centuries, in America and other countries around the world where Jews lived in the Diaspora. Talmudic study in Yeshiva academies, most of them located in The United States and Israel, continues today.

These Talmudic Yeshiva academies of Babylonia followed the era of the Amoraim (&quot;expounders&quot;)—the sages of the Talmud who were active (both in Judah and in Babylon) during the end of the era of the sealing of the Mishnah and until the times of the sealing of the Talmud (220CE – 500CE), and following the Savoraim (&quot;reasoners&quot;)—the sages of beth midrash (Torah study places) in Babylon from the end of the era of the Amoraim (5th century) and until the beginning of the era of the Geonim. The Geonim (Hebrew: גאונים) were the presidents of the two great rabbinical colleges of Sura and Pumbedita, and were the generally accepted spiritual leaders of the worldwide Jewish community in the early medieval era, in contrast to the Resh Galuta (Exilarch) who wielded secular authority over the Jews in Islamic lands. According to traditions, the Resh Galuta were descendants of Judean kings, which is why the kings of Parthia would treat them with much honour.

For the Jews of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the yeshivot of Babylonia served much the same function as the ancient Sanhedrin—that is, as a council of Jewish religious authorities. The academies were founded in pre-Islamic Babylonia under the Zoroastrian Sassanid dynasty and were located not far from the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, which at that time was the largest city in the world. After the conquest of Persia in the 7th century, the academies subsequently operated for four hundred years under the Islamic caliphate. The first gaon of Sura, according to Sherira Gaon, was Mar bar Rab Chanan, who assumed office in 609. The last gaon of Sura was Samuel ben Hofni, who died in 1034; the last gaon of Pumbedita was Hezekiah Gaon, who was tortured to death in 1040; hence the activity of the Geonim covers a period of nearly 450 years.

One of principal seats of Babylonian Judaism was Nehardea, which was then a very large city made up mostly of Jews. A very ancient synagogue, built, it was believed, by King Jehoiachin, existed in Nehardea. At Huzal, near Nehardea, there was another synagogue, not far from which could be seen the ruins of Ezra&#x27;s academy. In the period before Hadrian, Akiba, on his arrival at Nehardea on a mission from the Sanhedrin, entered into a discussion with a resident scholar on a point of matrimonial law (Mishnah Yeb., end). At the same time there was at Nisibis (northern Mesopotamia), an excellent Jewish college, at the head of which stood Judah ben Bathyra, and in which many Judean scholars found refuge at the time of the persecutions. A certain temporary importance was also attained by a school at Nehar-Pekod, founded by the Judean immigrant Hananiah, nephew of Joshua ben Hananiah, which school might have been the cause of a schism between the Jews of Babylonia and those of Judea-Israel, had not the Judean authorities promptly checked Hananiah&#x27;s ambition.

===The Byzantine period (324–638 CE) ===
Jews were also widespread throughout the Roman Empire, and this carried on to a lesser extent in the period of Byzantine rule in the central and eastern Mediterranean. The militant and exclusive Christianity and caesaropapism of the Byzantine Empire did not treat Jews well, and the condition and influence of diaspora Jews in the Empire declined dramatically.

It was official Christian policy to convert Jews to Christianity, and the Christian leadership used the official power of Rome in their attempts. In 351 CE the Jews revolted against the added pressures of their Governor, Constantius Gallus. Gallus put down the revolt and destroyed the major cities in the Galilee area where the revolt had started. Tzippori and Lydda (site of two of the major legal academies) never recovered.

In this period, the Nasi in Tiberias, Hillel II, created an official calendar, which needed no monthly sightings of the moon. The months were set, and the calendar needed no further authority from Judea. At about the same time, the Jewish academy at Tiberius began to collate the combined Mishnah, braitot, explanations, and interpretations developed by generations of scholars who studied after the death of Judah HaNasi. The text was organized according to the order of the Mishna: each paragraph of Mishnah was followed by a compilation of all of the interpretations, stories, and responses associated with that Mishnah. This text is called the &quot;Jerusalem Talmud.&quot;

The Jews of Judea received a brief respite from official persecution during the rule of the Emperor Julian the Apostate. Julian&#x27;s policy was to return the Roman Empire to Hellenism, and he encouraged the Jews to rebuild Jerusalem. As Julian&#x27;s rule lasted only from 361 to 363, the Jews could not rebuild sufficiently before Roman Christian rule was restored over the Empire. Beginning in 398 with the consecration of St. John Chrysostom as Patriarch, Christian rhetoric against Jews grew sharper; he preached sermons with titles such as &quot;Against the Jews&quot; and &quot;On the Statues, Homily 17&quot;, in which John preaches against &quot;the Jewish sickness&quot;. Such heated language contributed to a climate of Christian distrust and hate toward the large Jewish settlements, such as those in Antioch and Constantinople.

In the beginning of the 5th century, the Emperor Theodosius issued a set of decrees establishing official persecution of Jews. Jews were not allowed to own slaves, build new synagogues, hold public office or try cases between a Jew and a non-Jew. Intermarriage between Jew and non-Jew was made a capital offence, as was the conversion of Christians to Judaism. Theodosius did away with the Sanhedrin and abolished the post of Nasi. Under the Emperor Justinian, the authorities further restricted the civil rights of Jews, and threatened their religious privileges. The emperor interfered in the internal affairs of the synagogue, and forbade, for instance, the use of the Hebrew language in divine worship. Those who disobeyed the restrictions were threatened with corporal penalties, exile, and loss of property. The Jews at Borium, not far from Syrtis Major, who resisted the Byzantine General Belisarius in his campaign against the Vandals, were forced to embrace Christianity, and their synagogue was converted to a church.

Justinian and his successors had concerns outside the province of Judea, and he had insufficient troops to enforce these regulations. As a result, the 5th century was a period when a wave of new synagogues were built, many with beautiful mosaic floors. Jews adopted the rich art forms of the Byzantine culture. Jewish mosaics of the period portray people, animals, menorahs, zodiacs, and Biblical characters. Excellent examples of these synagogue floors have been found at Beit Alpha (which includes the scene of Abraham sacrificing a ram instead of his son Isaac along with a zodiac), Tiberius, Beit Shean, and Tzippori.

The precarious existence of Jews under Byzantine rule did not long endure, largely due to the explosion of the Muslim religion out of the remote Arabian peninsula (where large populations of Jews resided, see History of the Jews under Muslim Rule for more). The Muslim Caliphate ejected the Byzantines from the Holy Land (or the Levant, defined as modern Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) within a few years of their victory at the Battle of Yarmouk in 636. Numerous Jews fled the remaining Byzantine territories in favour of residence in the Caliphate over the subsequent centuries.

The size of the Jewish community in the Byzantine Empire was not affected by attempts by some emperors to forcibly convert the Jews of Anatolia to Christianity, as these attempts met with very little success. Historians continue to research the status of the Jews in Asia Minor under Byzantine rule. (for a sample of views, see, for instance, J. Starr &quot;The Jews in the Byzantine Empire, 641–1204&quot;; S. Bowman, &quot;The Jews of Byzantium&quot;; R. Jenkins &quot;Byzantium&quot;; Averil Cameron, &quot;Byzantines and Jews: Recent Work on Early Byzantium&quot;, &quot;Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies&quot; 20 (1996)). No systematic persecution of the type endemic at that time in Western Europe (pogroms, the stake, mass expulsions, etc.) has been recorded in Byzantium. Much of the Jewish population of Constantinople remained in place after the conquest of the city by Mehmet II.

=== Diaspora communities ===

Cochin Jewish tradition holds that the roots of their community go back to the arrival of Jews at Shingly in 72 CE, after the Destruction of the Second Temple. It also states that a Jewish kingdom, understood to mean the granting of autonomy by a local king, Cheraman Perumal, to the community, under their leader Joseph Rabban, in 379 CE. The first synagogue there was built in 1568. The legend of the founding of Indian Christianity in Kerala by Thomas the Apostle relates that on his arrival there, he encountered a local girl who understood Hebrew.

Perhaps in the 4th century, the Kingdom of Semien, a Jewish nation in modern Ethiopia was established, lasting until the 17th century.

== The Medieval period ==

=== The Islamic period (638–1099) ===

In 638 CE the Byzantine Empire lost control of the Levant. The Arab Islamic Empire under Caliph Omar conquered Jerusalem and the lands of Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine and Egypt. As a political system, Islam created radically new conditions for Jewish economic, social, and intellectual development. Caliph Omar permitted the Jews to reestablish their presence in Jerusalem–after a lapse of 500 years. Jewish tradition regards Caliph Omar as a benevolent ruler and the Midrash (Nistarot de-Rav Shimon bar Yoḥai) refers to him as a &quot;friend of Israel&quot;.

According to the Arab geographer Al-Muqaddasi, the Jews worked as &quot;the assayers of coins, the dyers, the tanners and the bankers in the community&quot;. During the Fatimid period, many Jewish officials served in the regime. Professor Moshe Gil believes that at the time of the Arab conquest in the 7th century CE, the majority of the population was Christian and Jewish.

During this time Jews lived in thriving communities all across ancient Babylonia. In the Geonic period (650–1250 CE), the Babylonian Yeshiva Academies were the chief centres of Jewish learning; the Geonim (meaning either &quot;Splendor&quot; or &quot;Geniuses&quot;), who were the heads of these schools, were recognized as the highest authorities in Jewish law.

In the 7th century, the new Muslim rulers institute the kharaj land tax, which led to mass migration of Babylonian Jews from the countryside to cities like Baghdad. This in turn led to greater wealth and international influence, as well as a more cosmopolitan outlook from Jewish thinkers such as Saadiah Gaon, who now deeply engaged with Western philosophy for the first time. When the Abbasid Caliphate and the city of Baghdad declined in the 10th century, many Babylonian Jews migrated to the Mediterranean region, contributing to the spread of Babylonian Jewish customs throughout the Jewish world.

===The Jewish Golden Age in early Muslim Spain (711–1031) ===

The golden age of Jewish culture in Spain coincided with the Middle Ages in Europe, a period of Muslim rule throughout much of the Iberian Peninsula. During that time, Jews were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed.

A period of tolerance thus dawned for the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula, whose number was considerably augmented by immigration from Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest. Especially after 912, during the reign of Abd-ar-Rahman III and his son, Al-Hakam II, the Jews prospered, devoting themselves to the service of the Caliphate of Cordoba, to the study of the sciences, and to commerce and industry, especially to trading in silk and slaves, in this way promoting the prosperity of the country. Jewish economic expansion was unparalleled. In Toledo, Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the Romance languages, as well as translating Greek and Hebrew texts into Arabic. Jews also contributed to botany, geography, medicine, mathematics, poetry and philosophy.

&#x27;Abd al-Rahman&#x27;s court physician and minister was Hasdai ben Isaac ibn Shaprut, the patron of Menahem ben Saruq, Dunash ben Labrat, and other Jewish scholars and poets. Jewish thought during this period flourished under famous figures such as Samuel Ha-Nagid, Moses ibn Ezra, Solomon ibn Gabirol Judah Halevi and Moses Maimonides. During &#x27;Abd al-Rahman&#x27;s term of power, the scholar Moses ben Enoch was appointed rabbi of Córdoba, and as a consequence al-Andalus became the centre of Talmudic study, and Córdoba the meeting-place of Jewish savants.

The Golden Age ended with the invasion of al-Andalus by the Almohades, a conservative dynasty originating in North Africa, who were highly intolerant of religious minorities.

===The Crusaders period (1099–1260) ===

Sermonical messages to avenge the death of Jesus encouraged Christians to participate in the Crusades. The twelfth century Jewish narration from R. Solomon ben Samson records that crusaders en route to the Holy Land decided that before combating the Ishmaelites they would massacre the Jews residing in their midst to avenge the crucifixion of Christ. The massacres began at Rouen and Jewish communities in Rhine Valley were seriously affected.

Crusading attacks were made upon Jews in the territory around Heidelberg. A huge loss of Jewish life took place. Many were forcibly converted to Christianity and many committed suicide to avoid baptism. A major driving factor behind the choice to commit suicide was the Jewish realisation that upon being slain their children could be taken to be raised as Christians. The Jews were living in the middle of Christian lands and felt this danger acutely. This massacre is seen as the first in a sequence of antisemitic events which culminated in the Holocaust. Jewish populations felt that they had been abandoned by their Christian neighbours and rulers during the massacres and lost faith in all promises and charters.

Many Jews chose self-defence. But their means of self-defence were limited and their casualties only increased. Most of the forced conversions proved ineffective. Many Jews reverted to their original faith later. The pope protested this but Emperor Henry IV agreed to permitting these reversions. The massacres began a new epoch for Jewry in Christendom. The Jews had preserved their faith from social pressure, now they had to preserve it at sword point. The massacres during the crusades strengthened Jewry from within spiritually. The Jewish perspective was that their struggle was Israel&#x27;s struggle to hallow the name of God.

In 1099, Jews helped the Arabs to defend Jerusalem against the Crusaders. When the city fell, the Crusaders gathered many Jews in a synagogue and set it on fire. In Haifa, the Jews almost single-handedly defended the town against the Crusaders, holding out for a month, (June–July 1099). At this time there were Jewish communities scattered all over the country, including Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza. As Jews were not allowed to hold land during the Crusader period, they worked at trades and commerce in the coastal towns during times of quiescence. Most were artisans: glassblowers in Sidon, furriers and dyers in Jerusalem.

During this period, the Masoretes of Tiberias established the &quot;niqqud&quot;, a system of diacritical signs used to represent vowels or distinguish between alternative pronunciations of letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Numerous piyutim and midrashim were recorded in Palestine at this time.

Maimonides wrote that in 1165 he visited Jerusalem and went to the Temple Mount, where he prayed in the &quot;great, holy house&quot;. Maimonides established a yearly holiday for himself and his sons, the 6th of Cheshvan, commemorating the day he went up to pray on the Temple Mount, and another, the 9th of Cheshvan, commemorating the day he merited to pray at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron.

In 1141 Yehuda Halevi issued a call to Jews to emigrate to Palestine and took on the long journey himself. After a stormy passage from Córdoba, he arrived in Egyptian Alexandria, where he was enthusiastically greeted by friends and admirers. At Damietta, he had to struggle against his heart, and the pleadings of his friend Ḥalfon ha-Levi, that he remain in Egypt, where he would be free from intolerant oppression. He started on the rough route overland. He was met along the way by Jews in Tyre and Damascus. Jewish legend relates that as he came near Jerusalem, overpowered by the sight of the Holy City, he sang his most beautiful elegy, the celebrated &quot;Zionide&quot; (&quot;Zion ha-lo Tish&#x27;ali&quot;). At that instant, an Arab had galloped out of a gate and rode him down; he was killed in the accident.

===The Mamluk period (1260–1517) ===
Nahmanides is recorded as settling in the Old City of Jerusalem in 1267. He moved to Acre, where he was active in spreading Jewish learning, which was at that time neglected in the Holy Land. He gathered a circle of pupils around him, and people came in crowds, even from the district of the Euphrates, to hear him. Karaites were said to have attended his lectures, among them Aaron ben Joseph the Elder. He later became one of the greatest Karaite authorities. Shortly after Nahmanides&#x27; arrival in Jerusalem, he addressed a letter to his son Nahman, in which he described the desolation of the Holy City. At the time, it had only two Jewish inhabitants—two brothers, dyers by trade. In a later letter from Acre, Nahmanides counsels his son to cultivate humility, which he considers to be the first of virtues. In another, addressed to his second son, who occupied an official position at the Castilian court, Nahmanides recommends the recitation of the daily prayers and warns above all against immorality. Nahmanides died after reaching seventy-six, and his remains were interred at Haifa, by the grave of Yechiel of Paris.

Yechiel had emigrated to Acre in 1260, along with his son and a large group of followers. There he established the Talmudic academy &quot;Midrash haGadol d&#x27;Paris&quot;. He is believed to have died there between 1265 and 1268. In 1488 Obadiah ben Abraham, commentator on the Mishnah, arrived in Jerusalem; this marked a new period of return for the Jewish community in the land.

====Spain, North Africa, and the Middle East====
During the Middle Ages, Jews were generally better treated by Islamic rulers than Christian ones. Despite second-class citizenship, Jews played prominent roles in Muslim courts, and experienced a Golden Age in Moorish Spain about 900–1100, though the situation deteriorated after that time. Riots resulting in the deaths of Jews did however occur in North Africa through the centuries and especially in Morocco, Libya and Algeria, where eventually Jews were forced to live in ghettos.

During the 11th century, Muslims in Spain conducted pogroms against the Jews; those occurred in Cordoba in 1011 and in Granada in 1066. During the Middle Ages, the governments of Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen enacted decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues. At certain times, Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face death in some parts of Yemen, Morocco and Baghdad. The Almohads, who had taken control of much of Islamic Iberia by 1172, surpassed the Almoravides in fundamentalist outlook. They treated the &quot;dhimmis&quot; harshly. They expelled both Jews and Christians from Morocco and Islamic Spain. Faced with the choice of death or conversion, many Jews emigrated. Some, such as the family of Maimonides, fled south and east to more tolerant Muslim lands, while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms.

===Europe===
According to the American writer James Carroll, &quot;Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the Roman Empire. By that ratio, if other factors had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million.&quot;

Jewish populations have existed in Europe, especially in the area of the former Roman Empire, from very early times. As Jewish males had emigrated, some sometimes took wives from local populations, as is shown by the various MtDNA, compared to Y-DNA among Jewish populations. These groups were joined by traders and later on by members of the diaspora. Records of Jewish communities in France (see History of the Jews in France) and Germany (see History of the Jews in Germany) date from the 4th century, and substantial Jewish communities in Spain were noted even earlier.

The historian Norman Cantor and other 20th-century scholars dispute the tradition that the Middle Ages was a uniformly difficult time for Jews. Before the Church became fully organized as an institution with an increasing array of rules, early medieval society was tolerant. Between 800 and 1100, an estimated 1.5 million Jews lived in Christian Europe. As they were not Christians, they were not included as a division of the feudal system of clergy, knights and serfs. This means that they did not have to satisfy the oppressive demands for labor and military conscription that Christian commoners suffered. In relations with the Christian society, the Jews were protected by kings, princes and bishops, because of the crucial services they provided in three areas: finance, administration and medicine. The lack of political strengths did leave Jews vulnerable to exploitation through extreme taxation.

Christian scholars interested in the Bible consulted with Talmudic rabbis. As the Roman Catholic Church strengthened as an institution, the Franciscan and Dominican preaching orders were founded, and there was a rise of competitive middle-class, town-dwelling Christians. By 1300, the friars and local priests staged the Passion Plays during Holy Week, which depicted Jews (in contemporary dress) killing Christ, according to Gospel accounts. From this period, persecution of Jews and deportations became endemic. Around 1500, Jews found relative security and a renewal of prosperity in present-day Poland.

After 1300, Jews suffered more discrimination and persecution in Christian Europe. Europe&#x27;s Jewry was mainly urban and literate. The Christians were inclined to regard Jews as obstinate deniers of the truth because in their view the Jews were expected to know of the truth of the Christian doctrines from their knowledge of the Jewish scriptures. Jews were aware of the pressure to accept Christianity. As Catholics were forbidden by the church to loan money for interest, some Jews became prominent moneylenders. Christian rulers gradually saw the advantage of having such a class of people who could supply capital for their use without being liable to excommunication. As a result, the money trade of western Europe became a specialty of the Jews. But, in almost every instance when Jews acquired large amounts through banking transactions, during their lives or upon their deaths, the king would take it over. Jews became imperial &quot;servi cameræ&quot;, the property of the King, who might present them and their possessions to princes or cities.

Jews were frequently massacred and exiled from various European countries. The persecution hit its first peak during the Crusades. In the People&#x27;s Crusade (1096) flourishing Jewish communities on the Rhine and the Danube were utterly destroyed. In the Second Crusade (1147) the Jews in France were subject to frequent massacres. They were also subjected to attacks by the Shepherds&#x27; Crusades of 1251 and 1320. The Crusades were followed by massive expulsions, including the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290; in 1396 100,000 Jews were expelled from France; and in 1421, thousands were expelled from Austria. Over this time many Jews in Europe, either fleeing or being expelled, migrated to Poland, where they prospered into another Golden Age.

In Italy, Jews were allowed to live in Venice but were required to live in a ghetto, and the practice spread across Italy (see Cum nimis absurdum) and was adopted in many places in Catholic Europe. Jews outside the Ghetto often had to wear a yellow star.

===Expulsions of the Jews of Spain and Portugal===
Significant repression of Spain&#x27;s numerous community occurred during the 14th century, notably a major pogrom in 1391 which resulted in the majority of Spain&#x27;s 300,000 Jews converting to Catholicism. With the conquest of the Muslim Kingdom of Granada in 1492, the Catholic monarchs issued the Alhambra Decree, and Spain&#x27;s remaining 100,000 Jews were forced to choose between conversion and exile. The expulsion of the Jews of Spain, is regarded by Jews as the worst catastrophe between the destruction of Jerusalem in 73 CE and the Holocaust of the 1940s.

As a result, an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 Jews left Spain, the remainder joining Spain&#x27;s already numerous Converso community. Perhaps a quarter of a million Conversos thus were gradually absorbed by the dominant Catholic culture, although those among them who secretly practiced Judaism were subject to 40 years of intense repression by the Spanish Inquisition. This was particularly the case up until 1530, after which the trials of Conversos by the Inquisition dropped to 3% of the total. Similar expulsions of Sephardic Jews occurred 1493 in Sicily (37,000 Jews) and Portugal in 1496. The expelled Spanish Jews fled mainly to the Ottoman Empire and North Africa and Portugal. A small number also settled in Holland and England.

The expulsion followed a long process of expulsions and bans from what are now England, France, Germany, Austria, and Holland. In January 1492, the last Muslim state was defeated in Spain and six months later the Jews of Spain (the largest community in the world) were required to convert or leave without their property. 100,000 converted with many continuing to secretly practice Judaism, for which the Catholic church&#x27;s inquisition (led by Torquemada) now mandated a sentence of death by public burning. 175,000 left Spain.

Many Spanish Jews moved to North Africa, Poland and the Ottoman Empire, especially Thessaloniki (now in Greece) which became the world&#x27;s largest Jewish city. Some groups headed to the Middle East and Palestine, within the domains of the Ottoman Empire. About 100,000 Spanish Jews were allowed into Portugal, however five years later, their children were seized and they were given the choice of conversion or departing without them.

==The Early Modern period==
Historians who study modern Jewry have identified four different paths by which European Jews were &quot;modernized&quot; and thus integrated into the mainstream of European society. A common approach has been to view the process through the lens of the European Enlightenment as Jews faced the promise and the challenges posed by political emancipation. Scholars that use this approach have focused on two social types as paradigms for the decline of Jewish tradition and as agents of the sea changes in Jewish culture that led to the collapse of the ghetto. The first of these two social types is the Court Jew who is portrayed as a forerunner of the modern Jew, having achieved integration with and participation in the proto-capitalist economy and court society of central European states such as the Habsburg Empire. In contrast to the cosmopolitan Court Jew, the second social type presented by historians of modern Jewry is the &quot;maskil&quot;, (learned person), a proponent of the Haskalah (Enlightenment). This narrative sees the maskil&#x27;s pursuit of secular scholarship and his rationalistic critiques of rabbinic tradition as laying a durable intellectual foundation for the secularization of Jewish society and culture. The established paradigm has been one in which Ashkenazic Jews entered modernity through a self-conscious process of westernization led by &quot;highly atypical, Germanized Jewish intellectuals&quot;. Haskalah gave birth to the Reform and Conservative movements and planted the seeds of Zionism while at the same time encouraging cultural assimilation into the countries in which Jews resided.
At around the same time that Haskalah was developing, Hasidic Judaism was spreading as a movement that preached a world view nearly opposed to the Haskalah.

In the 1990s, the concept of the &quot;Port Jew&quot; has been suggested as an &quot;alternate path to modernity&quot; that was distinct from the European Haskalah. In contrast to the focus on Ashkenazic Germanized Jews, the concept of the Port Jew focused on the Sephardi conversos who fled the Inquisition and resettled in European port towns on the coast of the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and the Eastern seaboard of the United States.

=== Court Jews ===

Court Jews were Jewish bankers or businessmen who lent money and handled the finances of some of the Christian European noble houses. Corresponding historical terms are &quot;Jewish bailiff&quot; and &quot;shtadlan&quot;.

Examples of what would be later called court Jews emerged when local rulers used services of Jewish bankers for short-term loans. They lent money to nobles and in the process gained social influence. Noble patrons of court Jews employed them as financiers, suppliers, diplomats and trade delegates. Court Jews could use their family connections, and connections between each other, to provision their sponsors with, among other things, food, arms, ammunition and precious metals. In return for their services, court Jews gained social privileges, including up to noble status for themselves, and could live outside the Jewish ghettos. Some nobles wanted to keep their bankers in their own courts. And because they were under noble protection, they were exempted from rabbinical jurisdiction.

From medieval times, court Jews could amass personal fortunes and gained political and social influence. Sometimes they were also prominent people in the local Jewish community and could use their influence to protect and influence their brethren. Sometimes they were the only Jews who could interact with the local high society and present petitions of the Jews to the ruler. However, the court Jew had social connections and influence in the Christian world mainly through his Christian patrons. Due to the precarious position of Jews, some nobles could just ignore their debts. If the sponsoring noble died, his Jewish financier could face exile or execution.

=== Port Jews ===
The Port Jew is a descriptive term for Jews who were involved in the seafaring and maritime economy of Europe, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries. Helen Fry suggests that they can be considered &quot;the earliest modern Jews&quot;. According to Fry, Port Jews frequently arrived as &quot;refugees from the Inquisition&quot; and the expulsion of Jews from Iberia. They were allowed to settle in port cities because merchants granted them permission to trade in ports such as Amsterdam, London, Trieste and Hamburg. Fry notes that their connections to the Jewish Diaspora and their expertise in maritime trade made them particularly valuable to the mercantilist governments of Europe. Lois Dubin describes Port Jews as Jewish merchants who were &quot;valued for their engagement in the international maritime trade upon which such cities thrived&quot;. Sorkin and others have characterized the socio-cultural profile of these men as marked by a flexibility towards religion and a &quot;reluctant cosmopolitanism that was alien to both traditional and &#x27;enlightened&#x27; Jewish identities&quot;.

From the 16th to the 18th century, Jewish merchants dominated the chocolate and vanilla trade, exporting to Jewish centres across Europe, mainly Amsterdam, Bayonne, Bordeaux, Hamburg and Livorno.

=== The Ottoman Empire ===
During the Classical Ottoman period (1300–1600), the Jews, together with most other communities of the empire, enjoyed a certain level of prosperity. Compared with other Ottoman subjects, they were the predominant power in commerce and trade as well in diplomacy and other high offices. In the 16th century especially, the Jews were the most prominent under the &quot;millets&quot;, the apogee of Jewish influence could arguably be the appointment of Joseph Nasi to Sanjak-bey (&quot;governor&quot;, a rank usually only bestowed upon Muslims) of the island of Naxos.

At the time of the Battle of Yarmuk when the Levant passed under Muslim Rule, thirty Jewish communities existed in Haifa, Sh&#x27;chem, Hebron, Ramleh, Gaza, Jerusalem, and many in the north. Safed became a spiritual centre for the Jews and the Shulchan Aruch was compiled there as well as many Kabbalistic texts. The first Hebrew printing press, and the first printing in Western Asia began in 1577.

Jews lived in the geographic area of Asia Minor (modern Turkey, but more geographically either Anatolia or Asia Minor) for more than 2,400 years. Initial prosperity in Hellenistic times had faded under Christian Byzantine rule, but recovered somewhat under the rule of the various Muslim governments that displaced and succeeded rule from Constantinople. For much of the Ottoman period, Turkey was a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, and it continues to have a small Jewish population today. The situation where Jews both enjoyed cultural and economical prosperity at times but were widely persecuted at other times was summarised by G.E. Von Grunebaum :

It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizeable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.

=== Poland ===
In the 17th century, there were many significant Jewish populations in Western and Central Europe. The relatively tolerant Poland had the largest Jewish population in Europe that dated back to 13th century and enjoyed relative prosperity and freedom for nearly four hundred years. However, the calm situation ended when Polish and Lithuanian Jews of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were slaughtered in the hundreds of thousands by Ukrainian Cossacks during the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648) and by the Swedish wars (1655). Driven by these and other persecutions, some Jews moved back to Western Europe in the 17th century, notably to Amsterdam. The last ban on Jewish residency in a European nation was revoked in 1654, but periodic expulsions from individual cities still occurred, and Jews were often restricted from land ownership, or forced to live in ghettos.

With the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, the Polish-Jewish population was split between the Russian Empire, Austria-Hungary, and German Prussia, which divided Poland among themselves.

=== The European Enlightenment and the Haskalah (18th century) ===
During the period of the European Renaissance and Enlightenment, significant changes occurred within the Jewish community. The Haskalah movement paralleled the wider Enlightenment, as Jews in the 18th century began to campaign for emancipation from restrictive laws and integration into the wider European society. Secular and scientific education was added to the traditional religious instruction received by students, and interest in a national Jewish identity, including a revival in the study of Jewish history and Hebrew, started to grow. Haskalah gave birth to the Reform and Conservative movements and planted the seeds of Zionism while at the same time encouraging cultural assimilation into the countries in which Jews resided. At around the same time another movement was born, one preaching almost the opposite of Haskalah, Hasidic Judaism. Hasidic Judaism began in the 18th century by Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov, and quickly gained a following with its more exuberant, mystical approach to religion. These two movements, and the traditional orthodox approach to Judaism from which they spring, formed the basis for the modern divisions within Jewish observance.

At the same time, the outside world was changing, and debates began over the potential emancipation of the Jews (granting them equal rights). The first country to do so was France, during the French Revolution in 1789. Even so, Jews were expected to assimilate, not continue their traditions. This ambivalence is demonstrated in the famous speech of Clermont-Tonnerre before the National Assembly in 1789:

We must refuse everything to the Jews as a nation and accord everything to Jews as individuals. We must withdraw recognition from their judges; they should only have our judges. We must refuse legal protection to the maintenance of the so-called laws of their Judaic organization; they should not be allowed to form in the state either a political body or an order. They must be citizens individually. But, some will say to me, they do not want to be citizens. Well then! If they do not want to be citizens, they should say so, and then, we should banish them. It is repugnant to have in the state an association of non-citizens, and a nation within the nation...

=== Hasidic Judaism ===

Hasidic Judaism is a branch of Orthodox Judaism that promotes spirituality and joy through the popularisation and internalisation of Jewish mysticism as the fundamental aspects of the Jewish faith. Hasidism comprises part of contemporary Ultra-Orthodox Judaism, alongside the previous Talmudic Lithuanian-Yeshiva approach and the Oriental Sephardi tradition.

It was founded in 18th-century Eastern Europe by Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov as a reaction against overly legalistic Judaism. Opposite to this, Hasidic teachings cherished the sincerity and concealed holiness of the unlettered common folk, and their equality with the scholarly elite. The emphasis on the Immanent Divine presence in everything gave new value to prayer and deeds of kindness, alongside Rabbinic supremacy of study, and replaced historical mystical (kabbalistic) and ethical (musar) asceticism and admonishment with optimism, encouragement, and daily fervour. This populist emotional revival accompanied the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical Divine Panentheism, through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of mystical thought. The adjustment of Jewish values sought to add to required standards of ritual observance, while relaxing others where inspiration predominated. Its communal gatherings celebrate soulful song and storytelling as forms of mystical devotion.

==The 19th century==

Though persecution still existed, emancipation spread throughout Europe in the 19th century. Napoleon invited Jews to leave the Jewish ghettos in Europe and seek refuge in the newly created tolerant political regimes that offered equality under Napoleonic Law (see Napoleon and the Jews). By 1871, with Germany&#x27;s emancipation of Jews, every European country except Russia had emancipated its Jews.

Despite increasing integration of the Jews with secular society, a new form of antisemitism emerged, based on the ideas of race and nationhood rather than the religious hatred of the Middle Ages. This form of antisemitism held that Jews were a separate and inferior race from the Aryan people of Western Europe, and led to the emergence of political parties in France, Germany, and Austria-Hungary that campaigned on a platform of rolling back emancipation. This form of antisemitism emerged frequently in European culture, most famously in the Dreyfus Trial in France. These persecutions, along with state-sponsored pogroms in Russia in the late 19th century, led a number of Jews to believe that they would only be safe in their own nation. See Theodor Herzl and History of Zionism.

During this period, Jewish migration to the United States (see American Jews) created a large new community mostly freed of the restrictions of Europe. Over 2 million Jews arrived in the United States between 1890 and 1924, most from Russia and Eastern Europe. A similar case occurred in the southern tip of the continent, specifically in the countries of Argentina and Uruguay.

== The 20th century ==

=== Modern Zionism ===


During the 1870s and 1880s, the Jewish population in Europe began to more actively discuss emigration to Ottoman Syria with the aim of re-establishing a Jewish polity in Palestine and fulfilling the biblical prophecies related to Shivat Tzion. In 1882 the first Zionist settlement—Rishon LeZion—was founded by immigrants who belonged to the &quot;Hovevei Zion&quot; movement. Later on, the &quot;Bilu&quot; movement established many other settlements in Palestine.

The Zionist movement was officially founded after the Kattowitz convention (1884) and the World Zionist Congress (1897), and it was Theodor Herzl who initiated the struggle to establish a state for the Jews.

After the First World War, it seemed that the conditions that made it possible for the Jews to establish such a state had arrived: The United Kingdom captured Palestine from the Ottoman Empire, and the Jews received the promise of a &quot;National Home&quot; from the British in the form of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, given to Chaim Weizmann.

In 1920, the British Mandate of Palestine was established and the pro-Jewish Herbert Samuel was appointed High Commissioner of Palestine, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was established and several large Jewish immigration waves to Palestine occurred. The Arab co-inhabitants of Palestine were hostile to increasing Jewish immigration, however, and as a result, they began to express their opposition to the establishment of Jewish settlements and they also began to express their opposition to the pro-Jewish policy of the British government in violent ways.

Arab gangs began to commit violent acts which included the murder of individual Jews, attacks on convoys and attacks on the Jewish population. After the 1920 Arab riots and the 1921 Jaffa riots, the Jewish leadership in Palestine believed that the British had no desire to confront local Arab gangs and punish them for their attacks on Palestinian Jews. Believing that they could not rely on the British administration for protection from these gangs, the Jewish leadership created the Haganah organization in order to protect its community&#x27;s farms and Kibbutzim.

Major riots occurred during the 1929 Palestine riots and the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine.

Due to the increasing violence, the United Kingdom gradually started to backtrack from its original idea of supporting the establishment of a Jewish homeland and it also started to speculate on a binational solution to the crisis or the establishment of an Arab state that would have a Jewish minority.

Meanwhile, the Jews of Europe and the United States gained success in the fields of science, culture and the economy. Among those Jews who were generally considered the most famous were the scientist Albert Einstein and the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. At that time, a disproportionate number of Nobel Prize winners were Jewish, as is still the case. In Russia, many Jews were involved in the October Revolution and belonged to the Communist Party.

===The Holocaust===

In 1933, with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party&#x27;s rise to power in Germany, the Jewish situation became more severe. Economic crises, racial Anti-Jewish laws, and fear of an upcoming war led many Jews to flee from Europe and settle in Palestine, the United States and the Soviet Union.

In 1939, World War II began and until 1945, Germany occupied almost all of Europe, including Poland—where millions of Jews were living at that time—and France. In 1941, following the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Final Solution began, an extensive organized operation on an unprecedented scale, aimed at the annihilation of the Jewish people, and resulting in the persecution and murder of Jews in Europe, as well as Jews in European North Africa (pro-Nazi Vichy-North Africa and Italian Libya). This genocide, in which approximately six million Jews were methodically murdered with horrifying cruelty, is known as The Holocaust or the &quot;Shoah&quot; (Hebrew term). In Poland, as many as one million Jews were murdered in gas chambers at the Auschwitz camp complex.

The massive scale of the Holocaust, and the horrors that happened during it, were only understood after the war, and they heavily affected the Jewish nation and world public opinion. Efforts were then increased to establish a Jewish state in Palestine.

===The establishment of the State of Israel===

In 1945 the Jewish resistance organizations in Palestine unified and established the Jewish Resistance Movement. The movement began guerilla attacks against Arab paramilitaries and the British authorities. Following the King David Hotel bombing, Chaim Weizmann, president of the WZO appealed to the movement to cease all further military activity until a decision would be reached by the Jewish Agency. The Jewish Agency backed Weizmann&#x27;s recommendation to cease activities, a decision reluctantly accepted by the Haganah, but not by the Irgun and Lehi. The JRM was dismantled and each of the founding groups continued operating according to their own policy.

The Jewish leadership decided to centre the struggle in the illegal immigration to Palestine and began organizing a massive number of Jewish war refugees from Europe, without the approval of the British authorities. This immigration contributed a great deal to the Jewish settlements in Israel in the world public opinion and the British authorities decided to let the United Nations decide upon the fate of Palestine.

On November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 181(II) recommending partitioning Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the City of Jerusalem. The Jewish leadership accepted the decision but the Arab League and the leadership of Palestinian Arabs opposed it. Following a period of civil war the 1948 Arab–Israeli War started.

In the middle of the war, after the last British soldiers of the Palestine Mandate left, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed on May 14, 1948, the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel to be known as the State of Israel. The war ended in 1949 and Israel started building the state and absorbing massive waves of hundreds of thousands of Jews from all over the world, notably Arab countries.

Since 1948, Israel has been involved in a series of major military conflicts, including the 1956 Suez Crisis, 1967 Six-Day War, 1973 Yom Kippur War, 1982 Lebanon War, and 2006 Lebanon War, as well as a nearly constant series of ongoing minor conflicts.

Since 1977, an ongoing and largely unsuccessful series of diplomatic efforts have been initiated by Israel, Palestinian organisations, their neighbours, and other parties, including the United States and the European Union, to bring about a peace process to resolve conflicts between Israel and its neighbours, mostly over the fate of the Palestinian people.

==The 21st century==
Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a population of over 8 million people, of whom about 6 million are Jewish. The largest Jewish communities are in Israel and the United States, with major communities in France, Argentina, Russia, England, and Canada. For statistics related to modern Jewish demographics see &quot;Jewish population&quot;.

The Jewish Autonomous Oblast, created during the Soviet period, continues to be an autonomous oblast of the Russian state. The Chief Rabbi of Birobidzhan, Mordechai Scheiner, says there are 4,000 Jews in the capital city. Governor Nikolay Mikhaylovich Volkov has stated that he intends to, &quot;support every valuable initiative maintained by our local Jewish organizations&quot;. The Birobidzhan Synagogue opened in 2004 on the 70th anniversary of the region&#x27;s founding in 1934.
The number of people who identified as Jews in England and Wales rose slightly between 2001 and 2011, with the growth being attributed to the higher birth rate of the Haredi community. The estimated British Jewish population in England as of 2011 was 263,346. As of 2021, per the British Census, the Jewish population of England and Wales was 271,327.

On October 7, 2023, the militant group Hamas invaded Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing 1,139 people. The day is considered the deadliest day in Israel&#x27;s history, and the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. The attack escalated into a major war between Israel and Hamas. Many civilians were killed and displaced, and hostages were taken.

<doc id="304142" wikidata="Q335205" url="?curid=304142" title="Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley">
<text>Richard Colley Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, (20 June 1760 – 26 September 1842) was an Anglo-Irish politician and colonial administrator. He was styled as Viscount Wellesley until 1781, when he succeeded his father as 2nd Earl of Mornington. In 1799, he was granted the Irish peerage title of Marquess Wellesley of Norragh. He was also Lord Wellesley in the Peerage of Great Britain.

Richard Wellesley first made his name as fifth Governor-General of Bengal between 1798 and 1805. He later served as Foreign Secretary in the British Cabinet and as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In 1799, his forces invaded Mysore and defeated Tipu, the Sultan of Mysore, in a major battle. He also initiated the Second Anglo-Maratha War.

Wellesley was the eldest son of Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington, an Irish peer, and Anne, the eldest daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon. His younger brother, was Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

==Early life==
Wellesley was born in 1760 in Dangan Castle in County Meath, Ireland, where his family was part of the Ascendancy, the old Anglo-Irish aristocracy. He was educated at the Royal School, Armagh, Harrow School and Eton College, where he distinguished himself as a classical scholar, and at Christ Church, Oxford. He is one of the few men known to have attended both Harrow and Eton.

In 1780, he entered the Irish House of Commons as the member for Trim until the following year when, at his father&#x27;s death, he became 2nd Earl of Mornington, taking his seat in the Irish House of Lords. He was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1782, a post he held for the following year. Due to the extravagance of his father and grandfather, he found himself so indebted that he was ultimately forced to sell all the Irish estates. However, in 1781, he was appointed to the coveted position of Custos Rotulorum of Meath.

In 1784, he joined also the British House of Commons as member for the rotten borough of Bere Alston in Devon. Soon afterwards he was appointed a Lord of the Treasury by William Pitt the Younger.

The 1792 Slave Trade Bill passed the House of Commons. Mangled and mutilated by the modifications and amendments of Pitt, the Earl of Mornington, Edward James Eliot and the Attorney General, it lay for years in the House of Lords.

In 1793, he became a member of the Board of Control over Indian affairs; and, although he was best known for his speeches in defence of Pitt&#x27;s foreign policy, he was gaining the acquaintance with Oriental affairs which made his rule over India so effective from the moment when, in 1797, he accepted the office of Governor-General of India.

==India ==
=== Voyage ===

Mornington seems to have caught Pitt&#x27;s large political spirit in the period 1798 to 1805. That both had consciously formed the design of expanding their influence in the Indian subcontinent to compensate for the loss of the American colonies is not proven; but the rivalry with France, which in Europe placed Britain at the head of coalition after coalition against the French, made Mornington aware of the necessity of ensuring French power did not reign supreme in India.

=== Governor-General ===
==== War with Mysore ====
On the voyage out, he formed the design of curbing French influence in the Deccan. Soon after his arrival, in April 1798, he learned that an alliance was being negotiated between Tipu Sultan and France. He soon after was appointed Governor-General of India on May 12, replacing Lord Cornwallis. Mornington resolved to anticipate the action of the Sultan and ordered preparations for war. The first step was to order the disbandment of the French troops employed by the Nizam of Hyderabad.

The capture of Mysore followed in February 1799, and the campaign was brought to a swift conclusion by the capture of Seringapatam on 4 May 1799 and the death of Tipu Sultan, who was killed in action. In 1803, the restoration of the Peshwa, Baji Rao II, proved the prelude to the war against Daulat Rao Sindhia of Gwalior and the raja of Berar, Raghoji II Bhonsle in which his brother Arthur took a leading role.

The result of these wars and of the treaties which followed them was that French influence in India was reduced to Pondicherry, and that Britain acquired increased influence in the heartlands of central India. He proved to be a skilled administrator, and picked two of his talented brothers for his staff: Arthur was his military adviser, and Henry was his personal secretary. He founded Fort William College, a training centre intended for those who would be involved in governing India. In connection with this college, he established the governor-general&#x27;s office, to which civilians who had shown talent at the college were transferred, in order that they might learn something of the highest statesmanship in the immediate service of their chief. He endeavoured to remove some of the restrictions on the trade between Europe and Asia. He took the time to publish an appreciation of British composer Harriet Wainwright&#x27;s opera &quot;Comala&quot; in the &quot;Calcutta Post&quot; on 27 April 1804.

=== Policies ===

Both the commercial policy of Wellesley and his educational projects brought him into hostility with the court of directors, and he more than once tendered his resignation, which, however, public necessities led him to postpone till the autumn of 1805. He reached England just in time to see Pitt before his death.

He had been created a Peer of Great Britain in 1797 as Baron Wellesley, and in 1799 became Marquess Wellesley in the Peerage of Ireland. He formed an enormous collection of over 2,500 painted miniatures in the Company style of Indian natural history.

He founded short-lived &#x27;The Institution for Promoting the Natural History&#x27; in 1801 at Barrackpore near Calcutta. The institution was supervised by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton. As a part of this endeavor &#x27;Barrackpore Menagerie&#x27; was founded which survived till 1878 when animals and birds were transferred to Alipore which later became Calcutta Zoo.

A motion by James Paull (MP) to impeach Wellesley due to his expulsion of British traders from Oudh was defeated in the House of Commons by 182 votes to 31 in 1808. Mornington also disapproved of liaisons between Company officials and soldiers and locals, seeing them as improper.

==Britain==
=== Re-entering Parliament ===
After his governorship ended in 1808, he returned to Britain and began to join British politics yet again. The few years back in Parliament were quite uneventful, despite the overwhelming crisis the British government faced with the war in Europe and its domination by Napoleon Bonaparte. The growing French influence threatened Britain and its empire to the extent of causing high tensions in the country. While the crisis abroad wasn’t enough, the British government had been led by weak and unsuited men from 1806-1809 with two short-lived ministries under Lord Grenville and the Duke of Portland respectively. 

But when on the fall of the Ministry of All the Talents in 1807, Wellesley was invited by George III to join the Duke of Portland&#x27;s cabinet, he declined, pending the discussion in parliament of certain charges brought against him in respect of his tenure as governor-general and because of criticism of his administration. Resolutions condemning him for the abuse of power were moved in both the Lords and Commons but defeated by large majorities.

=== Ambassador to Spain ===
In 1809, Wellesley was soon appointed as the British ambassador to Spain by Spencer Perceval. He landed at Cádiz just after the Allies victory at the Battle of Talavera, and he tried to bring the Spanish government into an effective co-operative agreement to support the campaign against the French with his brother, Sir Arthur Wellesley who was commander-in-chief of the British Forces. However, the failure of his allies to cooperate with the British soon forced both allies to retreat after French counter-attacks.

=== Foreign Secretary ===
A few months later, after a dispute between George Canning and Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh led to a duel and soon led to the resignation of both ministers, Spencer Perceval offered Wellesley the post of Foreign Secretary in his cabinet, which he accepted. Unlike his brother Arthur, he was an eloquent speaker, but was subject to inexplicable &quot;black-outs&quot; when he was apparently unaware of his surroundings.

He held this office until February 1812, when he retired, partly from dissatisfaction at the inadequate support given to Wellington by the ministry, but also because he had become convinced that the question of Catholic emancipation could no longer be kept in the background. From early life, Wellesley had, like his brother Arthur, been an advocate of Catholic emancipation, and from then on he publicly supported that cause.

Twice Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and one of the original Knights of St Patrick, he surrendered that order on being made a Knight of the Garter on 31 March 1812.

Upon Perceval&#x27;s assassination he, along with Canning, refused to join Lord Liverpool&#x27;s administration, and he remained out of office until 1821, severely criticising the proceedings of the Congress of Vienna and the European settlement of 1814, which, while it reduced France to its ancient limits, left to the other great powers the territory that they had acquired by the Partitions of Poland and the destruction of the Republic of Venice.

He was one of the peers who signed the protest against the enactment of the Corn Laws in 1815. His reputation never fully recovered from a fiasco in 1812 when he was expected to make a crucial speech denouncing the new government, but suffered one of his notorious &quot;black-outs&quot; and sat motionless in his place.

==Family life==

Wellesley lived together for many years with Hyacinthe-Gabrielle Roland, an actress at the Palais Royal. She had three sons and two daughters with Wellesley before he married her on 29 November 1794. He moved her to London, where Hyacinthe was generally miserable, as she never learned English and she was scorned by high society: Lady Caroline Lamb was warned by her mother-in-law, Elizabeth Milbanke, a noted judge of what was socially acceptable, that no respectable woman could afford to be seen in Hyacinthe&#x27;s company.

Their children were:
* Richard Wellesley (1787–1831), a member of parliament
* Anne Wellesley (1788–1875), who married firstly Sir William Abdy, 7th Baronet, and secondly Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Charles Bentinck. She and her second husband are ancestors of King Charles III)
* Hyacinthe Mary Wellesley (1789–1849), who married Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Hatherton
* Gerald Wellesley (1792–1833), who served as the East India Company&#x27;s resident at Indore.
* The Rev. Henry Wellesley (1794–1866), Principal of New Inn Hall, Oxford.

Through his eldest daughter Lady Charles Bentinck, Wellesley was a great-great-great-grandfather to Queen Elizabeth II.

Wellesley also had at least two other illegitimate sons by his teenage mistress, Elizabeth Johnston, including Edward (later his father&#x27;s secretary), born in Middlesex (1796-1877). Wellesley&#x27;s children were seen by Richard&#x27;s other relatives, including his brother Arthur, as greedy, unattractive and cunning, and as exercising an unhealthy influence over their father; in the family circle they were nicknamed &quot;The Parasites&quot;.

Following his first wife&#x27;s death in 1816, he married, on 29 October 1825, the widowed Marianne (Caton) Patterson (died 1853), whose mother Mary was the daughter of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the last surviving signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence; her former sister-in-law was Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte. Wellington, who was very fond of Marianne (rumour had it that they were lovers) and was then on rather bad terms with his brother, pleaded with her not to marry him, warning her in particular that &quot;The Parasites&quot; would see her as an enemy. The Duke&#x27;s concern seems to have been misplaced; they had no children, but the marriage was a relatively happy one - &quot;much of the calm and sunshine of his old age can be attributed to Marianne&quot;.

== Later life==
=== Lord Lieutenant of Ireland ===

In 1821, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Catholic emancipation had now become an open question in the cabinet, and Wellesley&#x27;s acceptance of the viceroyalty was believed in Ireland to herald the immediate settlement of the Catholic claims but they would remain unfulfilled. Some efforts were made to placate Catholic opinion, notably the dismissal of the long-serving Attorney-General for Ireland, William Saurin, whose anti-Catholic views had made him bitterly unpopular. Lord Liverpool died without having grappled with the problem. His successor, Canning, died only a few months after taking up office as Prime Minister, to be succeeded briefly by Lord Goderich.

On the assumption of office by Wellington, his brother resigned the lord-lieutenancy. He is said to have been deeply hurt by his brother&#x27;s failure to find a Cabinet position for him (Arthur made the usual excuse that one cannot give a Cabinet seat to everyone who wants one).

He had, however, the satisfaction of seeing the Catholic claims settled in the next year by the very statesmen who had declared against them. In 1833, he resumed the office of Lord Lieutenant under Earl Grey, but the ministry soon fell, and, with one short exception, Wellesley did not take any further part in official life.

===Death===

On his death, he had no successor in the marquessate, but the earldom of Mornington and minor honours devolved on his brother William, Lord Maryborough, on the failure of whose issue in 1863 they fell to Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington.

He and Arthur, after a long estrangement, had been once more on friendly terms for some years: Arthur wept at the funeral and said that he knew of no honour greater than being Lord Wellesley&#x27;s brother.

Wellesley was buried in Eton College Chapel, at his old school. Wellesley&#x27;s library was sold at auction in London by R. H. Evans on 17 January 1843 (and three following days); a copy of the catalogue, annotated with prices and buyers&#x27; names, is held at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.149(1)).

==Legacy==

The Township of Wellesley, in Ontario, Canada, was named in Richard Wellesley&#x27;s honour, despite the many references (e.g.: Waterloo, Wellington County) to his brother, Arthur Wellesley in the surrounding area, as was Wellesley Island, located in the St. Lawrence river at Alexandria Bay. Wellesley Island also serves as the last point exiting the United States before crossing to Hill Island, in Canada.

Province Wellesley, in the state of Penang, Malaysia, was named after Richard Wellesley. It was originally part of the state of Kedah. It was ceded to the British East India Company by Sultan
Dziaddin Mukarram Shah II of Kedah in 1798, and has been part of the settlement and state of Penang ever since. It was renamed &quot;Seberang Perai&quot; (&quot;across the Perai&quot; in the Malay language) not long after independence within Malaya.

The Wellesley Islands off the north coast of Queensland, Australia, were named by Matthew Flinders in honour of Richard Wellesley, as was the largest island in the group, Mornington Island. Flinders is believed to have done this during his imprisonment by the French on Mauritius as Wellesley had tried to secure his release.

Mornington Peninsula, south of Melbourne, was named after him.

As of the summer of 2007, a portrait of Marquess Wellesley hangs in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace.

A street in Mirzapur (United Provinces) was named Wellesleyganj.

<text>Albert Gregory Meyer (March 9, 1903 – April 9, 1965) was an American Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Chicago from 1958 until his death in 1965. He was appointed a cardinal in 1959. He previously served as Archbishop of Milwaukee from 1953 to 1958 and as Bishop of Superior from 1946 to 1953.

Meyer was a strong advocate for racial justice and a firm supporter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He was also a voice for religious tolerance and for the reconciliation of the Catholic Church with the Jewish people.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Albert Meyer was born on March 9, 1903, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Peter James Meyer, a grocer, and Mathilda (née Thelen) Meyer, both German immigrants. The fourth of five children, he had two brothers and two sisters; one sister became a nun. As a child, Albert Meyer would pretend to celebrate mass with a toy altar and a glass of water for the chalice of wine.

Meyer received his early education under the School Sisters of Notre Dame at the parochial school of St. Mary&#x27;s Parish in Milwaukee. After finishing the eighth grade, Meyer wanted to immediately enter St. Francis de Sales Seminary in St. Francis, Wisconsin. However, James Meyer was forced to close his grocery store in 1912, forcing his son to attend Marquette Academy in Milwaukee for two years.

With the assistance of a benefactor, Albert Meyer was finally able to pay the tuition for St. Francis at age 14. In 1922, Archbishop Sebastian Messmer sent him to Rome to continue his studies at the Pontifical Urban College for the Propagation of the Faith, while residing at the seminary in the Pontifical North American College.

=== Priesthood ===
On July 11, 1926, Meyer was ordained to the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Milwaukee by Cardinal Basilio Pompili, at the church of &quot;Santa Maria sopra Minerva&quot; in Rome. Meyer then continued his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Biblical Institute, obtaining a Doctorate in Holy Scriptures in 1930.

After returning to Wisconsin in 1930, the archdiocese assigned Meyer as curate at St. Joseph&#x27;s Parish in Waukesha, Wisconsin. In 1931, he was appointed to the faculty of St. Francis de Sales Seminary, teaching religion, Greek, Latin, biblical archeology, dogmatic theology and scriptures. While at the seminary, Meyer translated three books of the New Testament into English.

When Monsignor Aloisius Muench was named bishop of the Diocese of Fargo, Meyer succeeded him as rector of the seminary in 1937. The Vatican raised Meyer to the rank of domestic prelate, with the title of monsignor, in 1938. He also served as a chaplain and adviser to the local Serra Club.

=== Bishop of Superior ===
On February 18, 1946, Meyer was appointed the sixth bishop of Superior by Pope Pius XII. Meyer was consecrated on April 11, 1946, by Archbishop Moses E. Kiley, with Bishops Muench and William O&#x27;Connor serving as co-consecrators, in the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Milwaukee.

As one of his first actions in Superior, Meyer banned young priests from owning cars and demanded that they pay back the diocese the costs of their seminary preparations. However, after receiving backlash from the clergy, Meyer dropped these demands.

Meyer in 1950 inaugurated the Diocesan Council of Women to involve Catholic women in the operation of the diocese. He also established the Apostolate of Vocations to encourage more youth to become seminarians and started the &quot;Catholic Herald Citizen&quot; diocesan news paper.Meyer wrote a series of outlines of sermons to be used by his priests; they soon gained popularity among priests throughout Wisconsin.

Meyer opened the third synod of the diocese in 1953. By the time Meyer left Superior in 1953, he had built 15 churches and opened ten schools. 

=== Archbishop of Milwaukee ===
Pius XII appointed Meyer as the seventh archbishop of Milwaukee on July 21, 1953. He was installed on September 24, 1953. In 1956, Meyer published a pastoral letter titled &quot;Decency and Modesty&quot;, in which he condemned sexual content in films and television, along with what he considered to be immodest clothing worn in public. 

Meyer in 1958 established a Council of Catholic Men to involve laymen in the running of the archdiocese. He also instituted a $3.23 million capital improvement project for the archdiocese, including St. Francis de Sales Seminary. During his tenure in Milwaukee, Meyer constructed 17 parishes and converted five mission churches into parishes.

=== Archbishop of Chicago ===

Pius Xll appointed Meyer as archbishop of Chicago on September 19, 1958. He was installed on November 14, 1958.

On December 1, 1958, a fire broke out at Our Lady of the Angels School in Chicago, killing 92 students and three nuns. While visiting the hospital and morgue with Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, Meyer was overcome with grief. Cardinal Francis Spellman travelled to Chicago from New York City to support Meyer and Pope John XXIII sent him a condolence telegram. After the fire, the archdiocese faced $44 million in lawsuits from the families of victims and survivors. Six years later, after a long series of settlement talks, Meyer decided to provide reparations to all the victims and survivors.

Meyer is featured in the 1958 film &quot;Decision for Happiness&quot;, produced by the Congregation of Sisters of St. Agnes.

In 1960, Meyer banned parishes from holding bingo games in response to reports of corruption in their management. In January 1961, during riots in the African-American Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago, he issued this statement:We must remove from the church on the local scene any possible taint of racial discrimination or racial segregation, and help provide the moral leadership for eliminating racial discrimination from the whole community.

==Cardinal==

Meyer was created cardinal priest of the church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere in Rome by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of December 14, 1959. Church observers were surprised by his appointment as he had not spent much time either in Rome after finishing his education or as archbishop of Chicago. Meyer participated at the first three sessions of the Second Vatican Council, from 1962 to 1964, and sat on its Board of Presidency. During the council, Meyer showed himself to be of liberal tendencies and was viewed as the chief intellectual among the participating American hierarchy. 

The scholarly and often shy prelate supported religious liberty. He strongly condemned racism, warning his clergy &quot;not to foster the flame of racial hatred&quot;. At the 1963 National Conference on Race and Religion in Chicago, Meyer delivered a speech along with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Meyer also worked with the community activist Saul Alinsky and supported the integration of the archdiocesan schools. 

Meyer served as a cardinal elector in the 1963 papal conclave that selected Pope Paul VI. Meyer, an occasional fisherman, once called fishing the &quot;apostolic recreation&quot;, and was also known to attend Milwaukee Braves baseball games.

==Death and legacy==
Meyer in January 1965 was hospitalized at Mercy Hospital in Chicago for treatment of gallstones. After his discharge, he started suffering severe headaches a few weeks later. He re-entered Mercy in February and was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. He underwent an operation on February 25th, but never recovered from the surgery. Albert Meyer died at age 62 on April 9, 1965, at Mercy Hospital. 

Meyer is buried in the cemetery of the University of Saint Mary of the Lake in Mundelein, Illinois. The American Jewish Committee called Meyer&quot;...one of the great liberal spirits of our time.&quot;

Meyer was honored by naming at the following institutions:

* St. Albert Parish in Land of Lakes, Wisconsin
* Cardinal Meyer Library at Marian University in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin

<doc id="304147" wikidata="Q1164079" url="?curid=304147" title="The Birds (play)">
<text>The Birds () is a comedy by the Ancient Greek playwright Aristophanes. It was performed in 414 BC at the City Dionysia in Athens where it won second place. It has been acclaimed by modern critics as a perfectly realized fantasy remarkable for its mimicry of birds and for the gaiety of its songs. Unlike the author&#x27;s other early plays, it includes no direct mention of the Peloponnesian War and there are few references to Athenian politics, and yet it was staged not long after the commencement of the Sicilian Expedition, an ambitious military campaign that greatly increased Athenian commitment to the war effort. In spite of that, the play has many indirect references to Athenian political and social life. It is the longest of Aristophanes&#x27;s surviving plays and yet it is a fairly conventional example of Old Comedy.

The plot of the play revolves around Pisthetaerus, an Athenian who convinces the birds to create a great city in the sky, and thus regain their status as the original gods. Pisthetaerus eventually transforms into a bird-like god himself, and replaces Zeus as the king of the gods.

==Plot==
The play begins with two middle-aged men stumbling across a hillside wilderness, guided by a pet crow and a pet jackdaw. One of them advises the audience that they are fed up with life in Athens, where people do nothing all day but argue over laws, and they are looking for Tereus, a king who was once metamorphosed into the Hoopoe, for they believe he might help them find a better life somewhere else. Just then, a very large and fearsome bird emerges from a camouflaged bower, demanding to know what they are up to and accusing them of being bird-catchers. He turns out to be the Hoopoe&#x27;s servant. They appease him and he returns indoors to fetch his master. Moments later the Hoopoe himself appears—a not very convincing bird who attributes his lack of feathers to a severe case of moulting. He is happy to discuss their plight with them, and meanwhile one of them has a brilliant idea: the birds, he says, should stop flying about like idiots and instead should build themselves a great city in the sky, since this would both allow them to lord it over men and enable them to blockade the Olympian gods in the same way that the Athenians had recently starved the island of Melos into submission. The Hoopoe likes the idea, and he agrees to help implement it, provided, of course, that the two Athenians can first convince all the other birds. He calls to his wife, the Nightingale, and bids her to begin her celestial music. The notes of an unseen flute swell through the theatre, and meanwhile the Hoopoe provides the lyrics, summoning the birds of the world from their different habitats—birds of the fields, mountain birds and birds of the trees, birds of the waterways, marshes and seas. These soon begin to appear, and each of them is identified by name on arrival. Four of them dance together while the rest form into a Chorus.

On discovering the presence of men, the newly arrived birds fly into a fit of alarm and outrage, for mankind has long been their enemy. A skirmish follows, during which the Athenians defend themselves with kitchen utensils that they find outside the Hoopoe&#x27;s bower, until the Hoopoe at last manages to persuade the Chorus to give his human guests a fair hearing. The cleverer of the two Athenians, the author of the brilliant idea, then delivers a formal speech, advising the birds that they were the original gods and urging them to regain their lost powers and privileges from the johnny-come-lately Olympians. The birds are completely won over and urge the Athenians to lead them in their war against the usurping gods. The clever one then introduces himself as Pisthetaerus (Trustyfriend), and his companion is introduced as Euelpides (Goodhope). They retire to the Hoopoe&#x27;s bower to chew on a magical root that will transform them into birds. Meanwhile, the Nightingale emerges from her hiding place and reveals herself as an enchantingly feminine figure. She presides over the Chorus of birds while they address the audience in a conventional parabasis:

::&quot;Hear us, you who are no more than leaves always falling, you mortals benighted by nature,&quot;
::&quot;You enfeebled and powerless creatures of earth always haunting a world of mere shadows,&quot;
::&quot;Entities without wings, insubstantial as dreams, you ephemeral things, you human beings:&quot;
::&quot;Turn your minds to our words, our etherial words, for the words of the birds last forever!&quot;

The Chorus delivers a brief account of the genealogy of the gods, claiming that the birds are children of Eros and grandchildren of Night and Erebus, thus establishing their claim to divinity ahead of the Olympians. It cites some of the benefits the audience derives from birds (such as early warnings of a change in seasons), and it invites the audience to join them since birds easily manage to do things that mere men are afraid to do (such as beating up their fathers and committing adultery).

Pisthetaerus and Euelpides emerge from the Hoopoe&#x27;s bower laughing at each other&#x27;s unconvincing resemblance to a bird. After discussion, they name the city-in-the-sky Nephelokokkygia&quot;,&quot; or literally &quot;cloud-cuckoo-land&quot; (Νεφελοκοκκυγία), and then Pisthetaerus begins to take charge of things, ordering his friend to oversee the building of the city walls while he organizes and leads a religious service in honour of birds as the new gods. During this service, he is pestered by a variety of unwelcome visitors, including a young versifier out to hire himself to the new city as its official poet, an oracle-monger with prophecies for sale, a famous geometer, Meton, offering a set of town-plans, an imperial inspector from Athens with an eye for a quick profit, and a statute-seller trying to peddle a set of laws originally written for a remote, barely-heard-of town called Olophyx. Pisthetaerus chases off all these intruders and then retires indoors to finish the religious service. The birds of the Chorus step forward for another parabasis. They promulgate laws forbidding crimes against their kind (such as catching, caging, stuffing, or eating them), and they end by advising the festival judges to award them first place or risk getting defecated on.

Pisthetaerus returns to the stage moments before a messenger arrives with a report on the construction of the new walls: they are already finished thanks to the collaborative efforts of numerous kinds of birds. A second messenger then arrives with news that one of the Olympian gods has snuck through the defenses. A hunt is organized. The goddess Iris is detected and cornered, and soon she wafts down under guard. After being interrogated and insulted by Pisthetaerus, she is allowed to fly off to her father Zeus to complain about her treatment. Hardly has she gone when a third messenger arrives, declaring that men in their multitudes are now flocking to join the new city-in-the-sky. 

Another set of unwelcome visitors arrives as advertised, singing due to the inspiration of the new city. One is a rebellious youth who exults in the notion that here at last he has permission to beat up his father. The famous poet, Cinesias, is next, waxing incoherently lyrical as the poetic mood takes hold of him. Third is a sycophant in raptures at the thought of prosecuting victims on the wing. All of them are sent packing by Pisthetaerus. Prometheus arrives next, sheltering under a parasol because he is an enemy of Zeus and he is trying not to be seen from the heavens. He has come with advice for Pisthetaerus: the Olympians are starving because men&#x27;s offerings no longer reach them; they are desperate for a peace treaty, but Pisthetaerus shouldn&#x27;t negotiate with them until Zeus surrenders both his sceptre and his girlfriend, Sovereignty—she is the real power in Zeus&#x27;s household. His mission accomplished, Prometheus departs just moments before a delegation from Zeus arrives. There are only three delegates: the brother of Zeus, Poseidon, the oafish Heracles, and some even more oafish god worshipped by barbarians called Triballus. Pisthetaerus easily outwits Heracles, who in turn bullies the barbarian god into submission, and Poseidon is thus outvoted – the delegation accepts Pisthetaerus&#x27;s terms. He is proclaimed king by a heavenly herald, and he is presented with Zeus&#x27;s sceptre by Sovereignty, a vision of loveliness. The festive gathering departs amid the strains of the wedding march: &quot;Hymen O Hymenai&#x27;O! Hymen O Hymenai&#x27;O!&quot;

==Historical background==
When &quot;The Birds&quot; was performed in 414 BC, Athenians were still optimistic about the future of the Sicilian Expedition, which had set out the year before under the joint command of Alcibiades, who had promoted it enthusiastically, and Athens&#x27; most experienced general, Nicias, who had opposed the venture. In spite of this public optimism, there was ongoing controversy in Athens over the mutilation of the Hermai, an act of impious vandalism that had cast ominous doubts over the Sicilian Expedition even before the fleet had left port. The vandalism had resulted in a &#x27;witch-hunt&#x27; led by religious extremists and endorsed by priests of the Eleusinian Mysteries, leading to the persecution of rationalist thinkers such as Diagoras of Melos. Alcibiades himself was suspected of involvement in anti-religious activities and a state ship &quot;Salaminia&quot; was sent to Sicily to bring him back to trial. However, he managed to escape from custody and a reward of one talent of gold was subsequently offered by the Athenian authorities to anyone who could claim responsibility for his death. Alcibiades had already been a controversial figure in Athenian politics for some years before then – he had combined with Nicias to bring about the ostracism of the populist leader Hyperbolus. Hyperbolus was a frequent target of satire in Aristophanes&#x27; plays, a role previously filled by Cleon, who had died in 422.

===Places and people mentioned in &quot;The Birds&quot;===
Aristophanes wrote for the amusement of his fellow citizens and his plays are full of topical references. The following explanation of topical references in &quot;The Birds&quot; is based on the work of various scholars (commonplace references to conventional gods are omitted):

Places
*Libya: A region associated with the seasonal migration of cranes (lines 710, 1136), it allows for a pun on the Greek word &quot;libas&quot; (&quot;anything that drops or trickles&quot;) – Euelpides claims to be a Libyan bird on the grounds that he has wet himself with fear (65).
*Phasis River: Pisthetaerus claims to be a bird from this river because he wets himself with fear (line 68). A popular pun associates Phasian (&quot;phasianikos&quot;) with informers or sycophants (&quot;sycophantikos&quot;) – the pun however is developed more explicitly in &quot;The Acharnians&quot; (&quot;Acharnians&quot; line 725-6)
*Phalerum: An old port of Athens, it is a source of sardines (line 76), mentioned also in an earlier play.
*&quot;Salaminia&quot;: One of two Athenian ships reserved for state errands, it had recently been sent to Sicily to fetch Alcibiades back to Athens for trial. It is mentioned here as a good reason not to live near the sea (line 147). Iris resembles it and its sister ship &quot;Paralos&quot; as an errand-runner for the authorities (1204).
*Lepreus: A town in Elis, it is suggested by The Hoopoe as a good place to start a new life but it is rejected by Euelpides because it puns with leprosy, which reminds him of Melanthius, a poet whose skin was evidently as bad as his verse (line 149).
*Opuntian Locris: A coastal region of Greece opposite Euboea, it is another destination recommended by The Hoopoe but rejected by Euelpides because &#x27;Opuntian&#x27; reminds him of Opuntius, a notorious sycophant with only one eye (line 152).
*Melos: An island that had rebelled against Athenian control, it had been starved into submission. It is mentioned here as an example of what might be done against the gods (line 186) and also because it is an epithet for Diagoras of Melos (1032), a notorious atheist outlawed from Athens (possibly due to public anger over the mutilation of the hermae). Melos is also mentioned in &quot;The Clouds&quot; as an epithet for a Diagoras-like figure (Socrates).
*Cerameicon: Athens&#x27; most conspicuous cemetery – Psithetaerus hopes to get a hero&#x27;s burial there (line 395). It is mentioned also in &quot;The Knights&quot; and &quot;The Frogs&quot;.
*Delphi: The religious centre of Greece, it is referred to by that name (lines 618, 716) and also by its ancient name &quot;Pytho&quot; (lines 856, 870). Athenians could only reach it through Boeotia, enemy territory (189). There are many references to Delphi/Pytho in Aristophanes&#x27; other plays.
*Marathon: Often associated with Athens&#x27; victory against Persia, it also happened to be a prime habitat for birds (line 246). It is mentioned in other plays also.
*Orneae: A Peloponnesian town, it was destroyed by the Argives at about this time. It is mentioned because it allows for a pun on the Greek word for &quot;birds&quot; (line 399).
*Phrygia: A good source of wool (line 493), its people make a poor comparison with Athenians (762, 1244). There are references to it in two other plays.
*Alimos: A community on the Attic coast, it was the birthplace of the historian Thucydides. Euelpides was on his way there from Athens when he was once mugged (line 496).
*Egypt: It was once ruled by cuckoos (line 504). It was the home of the pyramid and yet nobody from there helped build the wall in the sky (1133). It is mentioned in other plays also.
*Phoenicia: This was another ancient land formerly ruled by cuckoos (line 504).
*Babylon: Its famous walls resemble those of Cloudcuckooland (line 552).
*Crioa or Krioa: A deme within the Antiochides tribe, it is the nominal home of Euelpides (line 645).
*Dodona: An ancient, oracular shrine in the north west of Greece, its role is now performed by the birds (line 716).
*Hebrus: A large river north of Greece favoured by swans (line 774).
*Sparta: Home town of the enemy, it is also the name for common rope used as webbing for beds. Euelpides thinks it might be a good name for the new city-in-the-sky but Pisthetaerus would never sleep comfortably under that name (line 815). More commonly known as Lacedaimon, Sparta is the model of a xenophobic town (1012).
*Phlegra: A plain where the Olympian gods outboasted the giants (line 824).
*Pelasgicon: The northern side of the Athenian acropolis, its equivalent in Cloudcuckooland is called &quot;Pelargikon&quot; – &quot;of the stork&quot; (line 832).
*Sounion: A promontory identified with Poseidon &quot;Souniaratos&quot; (&quot;Invoked at Sounion&quot;), it is now to be identified with the hawk – &quot;Sounierax&quot; (line 868). The epithet &quot;Souniaratos&quot; appears also in &quot;The Knights&quot;.
*Ortygia: An island identified with Leto &quot;Ortygometra&quot; (Mother of Quail Island), it is now to be identified with the quail though by the same epithet &quot;Ortygometra&quot; (line 870).
*Aetna: A Sicilian city founded by the Greek tyrant Hieron I, it is fancifully mentioned by the young poet (line 926) while he addresses Pisthetaerus in the manner of the illustrious bard Pindar addressing Hieron (Pindar fragment 94).
*Corinth and Sicyon: Neighbouring towns in the northern Peloponnese, they are used metaphorically in a prophecy quoted by the oracle monger to define an intermediate space inhabited by dogs and crows i.e. Cloudcuckooland (line 968).
*Colonus: A deme within the Aegides tribe, close to Athens – the mathematician Meton had recently designed an aqueduct there.
*Olophyxia: A remote town in the troubled north-east of Greece, near Mount Athos, it is the very model of a well-regulated town (line 1041).
*Laurium: A mining district near Athens, famous for its silver – owls from there (i.e. Athenian coins) will flock to the festival judges who award victory to &quot;The Birds&quot; (line 1106).
*Alpheus: A river associated with Olympia, home of The Olympic Games – a breathless, gasping runner is said to be breathing it (line 1121).
*Thrace: A north-eastern frontier and often a battleground during the Peloponnesian War, it is where the rebellious youth is sent to act out his violent instincts (line 1369). It is mentioned in other plays.
*Pellene: A village in the northern Peloponnese where a woollen cloak was awarded to winners in local games. It is mentioned also in &quot;Lysistrata&quot;.
*Corcyra: A supply port for the Sicilian Expedition, it is mentioned here as a source of good cords for whips – the only &#x27;wings&#x27; that Psithetaerus will give the sycophant (line 1463).
Foreigners
*Medes: Brothers of the Persians, one might be expected to arrive on a camel – even if he happened to be a bird (line 277). There are several references to them in the other plays.
*Carians: Inhabiting the eastern shores of the Aegean, they are known for their involvement with crests – they invented the helmet crest and they lived on hill crests (line 292) – see also Herodotus. An Athenian named Execestides is mentioned twice on account of his Carian origins (765, 1527). There are references to Carians in two other plays.
*Persians: A delegate from Persia, Pharnaces, is scheduled to appear at the ecclesia – an opportunity for corrupt Athenian officials (line 1030). Other references to Persians are in terms of the cock, a Persian bird (lines 485, 707) that predated Darius and Megabazus (484) as lord of Persia. Persians are mentioned in other plays too.
*Chians: Staunch allies of the Athenians, they merit a mention in prayers (line 879). There are references to them in other plays also.
*Scythians: A warlike and savage people – an effete Athenian, Straton, is imagined wandering in their midst (941). Scythians feature in the role of archers (Athenian equivalent of policemen) in three plays.

*Thales: One of the sages of ancient Greece, he is a benchmark for other mathematically minded intellectuals (line 1009).
*Sardanapalus: An Assyrian king, he is the benchmark for other extravagant and self-indulgent imperialists (line 1021).
*Lydians: Formerly an imperial power, they and their neighbours the Phrygians are now such timid folk that even the rainbow goddess Iris could intimidate them (line 1244). The Lydians are mentioned also in &quot;The Clouds&quot;.
*Illyrians: A barbarous people remarkable for the savagery of their warcries – barbarian gods sound like them when attacking Zeus (line 1521).
*Triballians: A people inhabiting the Thracian frontier – one of their gods is in the delegation to Cloudcuckooland.
Poets, artists and intellectuals
*Acestor Sacas: A foreign-born tragic poet – he is drawn to Athens just as Pisthetaerus is repelled by it (line 31). He is mentioned also in &quot;The Wasps&quot;.
*Sophocles: A renowned tragic poet, he wrote a play &quot;Tereus&quot; that is the basis for The Hoopoe&#x27;s unfortunate appearance (line 100). He receives mentions in other plays also.
*Melanthius: A rather tragic tragic poet – mocked here for his leprous-like skin (line 151) and in &quot;Peace&quot; for his gluttony and lack of talent.
*Philocles: A nephew of the great tragedian, Aeschylus, he wrote a play about Tereus that was a feeble descendant of the Tereus written by Sophocles and he is nicknamed &#x27;Lark&#x27; (lines 281, 1295). He is mocked in another two plays.
*Aesop: The legendary author of fables – the birds are ignorant because they have never read him (line 471) and he is the author of a cautionary tale about the eagle and the fox (651). There are references to him in &quot;The Wasps&quot; and &quot;Peace&quot;.
*Homer: The great Bard – he is indirectly quoted describing Hera (Iris) as a timid dove (line 575) and poets as servants of the Muses (910). He is referred to by name in three other plays.
*Prodicus: A philosopher and pundit, his knowledge is not respected by the birds (line 692). He is named also in &quot;The Clouds&quot;.
*Phrynichus (tragic poet): A respected tragic poet, he collected songs from the woodland Muse like a bee (line 749). He is mentioned in other plays.
*Aeschylus: A renowned tragic poet, he is named by Pisthetaerus as the author of a verse about heroes being shot with their own arrows/feathers (line 808) – the verse was borrowed from the now lost play &quot;Myrmidons&quot;. Moreover, a description of the nightingale (677) and Iris&#x27;s threats of divine wrath (1240) are borrowed from &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, and Pisthetaerus&#x27; counter-threat to burn down Zeus&#x27;s house (1246–7) appears to have been borrowed from &quot;Niobe&quot;.
*Chairis: A musician ridiculed in two other plays as a source of unwelcome noise, he adds to the cacophony of the birds in this play (line 857).
*Simonides: A respected poet, he is a role-model for the opportunistic young versifier who hopes to be hired by Cloudcuckooland (line 919). Simonides is accused of greediness in &quot;Peace&quot;, and he is twice mentioned in &quot;The Clouds&quot;.
*Pindar: A renowned poet, he is referred to by name (line 939) and his elevated style is plagiarized by the young versifier (see remarks for &quot;Hieron I&quot; above). Some of his verses are also quoted in &quot;The Knights&quot; and &quot;The Clouds&quot;.
*Euripides: A controversial tragic poet, he is lampooned in all Aristophanes&#x27; plays and he even features as a character in three of them (&quot;The Acharnians&quot;, &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot; and &quot;The Frogs&quot;). There is no direct mention of him in this play but there are quotations from some of his plays: a derogatory reference to Lydians and Phrygians (line 1244) is from &quot;Alcestis&quot; and a Choral injunction to make way for the hero (1720) is from &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;.
*Socrates: A famously quixotic philosopher, he was the role model for a generation of hungry, unkempt men until Pisthetaerus inspired new hope (line 1282). He is said to be an unwashed guide to the Underworld and a neighbour of the weird Shadow Foot people (&quot;Skiapodes&quot; line 1555). He appears as a character in &quot;The Clouds&quot; and he is mentioned again in &quot;The Frogs&quot;.
*Chaerephon: A loyal disciple of Socrates, he is a bat from hell in this play (lines 1296 and 1564). He is mentioned several times in &quot;The Clouds&quot; and a couple of times in &quot;The Wasps&quot;.
*Cinesias: An innovative poet, he was often ridiculed by comic poets. He is a ridiculous, minor character in this play, where he is presented as a hyperbolical rhapsodist. He receives other mentions in &quot;The Frogs&quot; and &quot;Ecclesiaszusae&quot;.
*Gorgias: A renowned orator from Sicily – he and his student (or son) Philippus are barbarous monstrosities disfigured by their versatile tongues (line 1701). Both orators are mention also in &quot;The Wasps&quot;.
Athenian politicians and generals
*Aristocrates, son of Scellias: A political and military figure, his name allows for a pun on &quot;aristocracy&quot; – he is despised by Euelpides.
*Nicias: One of the leading generals in Athens, recently entrusted with command of the Sicilian Expedition – he is a benchmark for clever soldiering (line 363) and for procrastination (640). He plays a minor role as a slave in The Knights and he is also mentioned by name in that play.
*Lusicrates: A snub-nosed official, notorious for taking bribes (line 513). He is possibly the same Lusicrates mentioned in &quot;Ecclesiazusae&quot;.
*Diitrephes: One of two cavalry commanders at that time, he was also a manufacturer of wicker jackets for wine jars, with handles known as &#x27;wings&#x27; – these wings have helped him to rise to positions of authority (798) and he inspires youths to join the cavalry (1442).
*Theogenes: A prominent politician, formerly a colleague of Cleon in a fact-finding mission to Pylos and one of seventeen Athenians pledged to observe the Peace of Nicias, it is possible that he was also influential three years later in the Oligarchic Coup of 411 BC and in the Tyranny of The Thirty. He is ridiculed here as a braggart (lines 822, 1127, 1295). He is mentioned in another three plays.
*Aeschines: Possibly an influential figure many years later in Tyranny of The Thirty, he is here ridiculed as a braggart (line 823). He is mentioned also in &quot;The Wasps&quot;.
*Teleas: An influential politician – he is someone who doesn&#x27;t like flighty types of people (line 168) and he is said to have been the man responsible for sending the inspector to Cloudcuckooland (1025)
*Peisander: Represented as a ghastly soldier in &quot;Peace&quot; and a corrupt rabble-rouser in Lysistrata, he is mentioned here as a soulless, bloodthirsty Odysseus-like figure (line 1556).
*Laespodias: Another general, he was notable for a deformity of his legs, though he tried to hide it under his cloak (line 1569).
Athenian personalities
*Philocrates: A prominent figure in the bird market (lines 14, 1077).
*Callias: A spendthrift, he had squandered his inheritance paying off sycophants and loose women – he resembles a bird moulting (lines 283-4). He is mentioned again in two later plays.
*Cleonymus: Constantly the butt of Aristophanic jokes for gluttony and cowardice, he is compared here with a &#x27;Gobbler&#x27; bird that has a crest (line 289) and to a tree that drops leaves like shields (1475).
*Orestes: Identified as a drunken and violent loiterer in &quot;The Acharnians&quot;, he has since then added clothes-stealing to his bag of tricks (lines 712, 1490)
*Cleisthenes: A frequent target for jokes on account of his conspicuous effeminacy, he appears as a minor character in &quot;The Acharnians&quot; and in &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;. He is a good reason why a virago like Athena should not be patron goddess of Cloudcuckooland i.e. one gender-bender is enough (line 831).
*Straton: Yet another effete Athenian mentioned in other plays, he is imagined suffering privations among savage Scythians (line 942).
*Proxenides: Another braggart like Theogenes (see above) – the walls of Cloudcuckooland are so broad that they could ride past each other on large chariots (line 1126). Proxenides is mentioned earlier in &quot;The Wasps&quot;.
*Athenians who resemble birds: Tharreleides: jackdaw (line 17); Sporgilus the barber: sparrow (300); Spintharus, Athenian of Phrygian descent: finch (762); Son of Peisias, a traitor: partridge (766); Menippus: swallow; Lycurgus: ibis; Syracosius: jay; Meidias: quail Cleocritus, mentioned also in &quot;The Frogs&quot;: ostrich.
*Extras: Patrocleides: known for an act of incontinence (790); Leotrophides: a client worthy of the poet Cinesias (1406).
Historic, religious and mythical figures
*Cranaus: A mythological king of Athens, his name is used as an epithet for Athenians (line 123). There are similar mentions in two other plays.
*Itys: The tragically short-lived son of Tereus and Procne, his name is used by the hoopoe when summoning the nightingale (line 212).
*Agamemnon, Menelaus, Priam: Legendary kings of Greece and Troy – birds were prominently featured on their royal insignia (lines 509,512). Only Menelaus is named in other plays.
*Cebriones, Porphyrion: Two of the giants who featured in the Gigantomachy, they are emblematic of the birds&#x27; revolt against the Olympian order (lines 553, 1249–52)
*Alcmene, Semele, Alope: Nymphs who were visited by the Olympian gods, they are typical of the old days when the Olympians had free passage through the skies (lines 558-9). Alcmene is mentioned also in &quot;The Frogs&quot;, Semele in &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;.
*Erebus, Tartarus, Eros: Foundational material for genealogies such as Hesiod&#x27;s Theogony, they are here revealed to be close relatives of the birds. Erebus (lines 691, 1194) isn&#x27;t mentioned in other plays. Tartarus (693, 698) is mentioned in &quot;The Clouds&quot;, and Eros (700, 1737) in two other plays.
*Colainis: An epithet for Artemis; it allows for a weak pun with &quot;acalanthis&quot;, the Attic word for goldfinch (lines 875).
*Sabazius: A Phrygian god – his ethnic origin allows for a pun with &quot;phrygilos&quot;, the Attic word for finch (line 876). He is named in two other plays.
*Cybele: Known also as the &#x27;mountain mother&#x27; (line 746), she is here identified with the ostrich and subsequently invoked as mother of the ostrich-like Cleocritus (877).
*Bacis: A legendary soothsayer – his oracles are lampooned in this play (lines 962, 970) and in other plays.
*Pandora: The mythical source of mankind&#x27;s misfortunes, she is to be placated with the sacrifice of a white ram on the authority of Bacis (line 971).
*Diopeithes: A contemporary Athenian soothsayer and religious fanatic mentioned in other plays, he is mentioned here along with the like-minded Lampon (line 988). Lampon is mentioned also as somebody who swears &#x27;by the goose&#x27; (521).
*Alexander: The legendary prince of Troy – the festival judges can expect better gifts than he ever got if they award first place to &quot;The Birds&quot; (line 1104).
*Timon: The legendary misanthrope – what he was to the Athenians, Prometheus is to the Olympians (line 1549). He is mentioned also in &quot;Lysistrata&quot;.
*Odysseus: The hero of Homer&#x27;s epic, named in three other plays – he is presented here as a benchmark for spooky bloodlust (line 1561).
*Solon: The founding father of Athenian democracy – his laws even govern the behaviour of the gods (line 1660).

==Discussion==
It has been argued that &quot;The Birds&quot; has suffered more than any other Aristophanic play from over-interpretation by scholars. Political allegory featured prominently in 19th century interpretations: Cloudcuckooland could be identified with the Sicilian Expedition as an over-ambitious scheme, Athenians could then be identified with the birds, and their enemies with the Olympian gods. The 20th century has also come up with allegorical interpretations—for example, Pisthetaerus has been interpreted as a metaphor for Alcibiades. Cloudcuckooland has been understood by some scholars as a comic representation of an ideal polis and it has also been understood as a cautionary example of a polis gone wrong; according to yet another view, however, the play is nothing more than escapist entertainment.

The friendship between Pisthetaerus and Euelpides is realistically portrayed in spite of the unreality of their adventure. The keynote of their friendship is good-humoured teasing of each other for one another&#x27;s failings (e.g. lines 54–5, 86–91, 336–42, 800–802) and the proof of their friendship is the ease with which they work together in difficult situations, largely due to Euelpides&#x27; willingness to concede the initiative and leadership to Pisthetaerus. The father-son relationship between Philocleon and Bdelycleon in &quot;The Wasps&quot; and the husband-wife relationship between Cinesias and Myrrine in &quot;Lysistrata&quot; are other examples of Aristophanes&#x27; ability to depict humanity convincingly in the most unconvincing settings imaginable.

Toynbee, in his &quot;Study of History&quot;, argues for a link between &quot;The Birds&quot; and the New Testament, pointing out significant examples of correspondence:
*Both Pisthetaerus and Jesus are deified human beings.
*Cloudcuckooland is synonymous with the Kingdom of Heaven, as they are both idealized heavenly cities.
*The example given in Matthew 6:26 of birds that make their living without reaping or gathering is echoed from a conversation between Euelpides and Hoopoe, in lines 155–61. Another connection is a fragment of Musonius.
*The Christian imagery of the Dove as the Holy Spirit is derived from its use as the emblem of the &quot;heavenly love&quot; of Aphrodite Urania.
He believes that the New Testament was influenced by a literary tradition that began with Aristophanes. The major difference is that Aristophanes presents these ideas as comic fantasy, while the New Testament treats them as profoundly serious revelation.

==&quot;The Birds&quot; and Old Comedy==
&quot;The Birds&quot; resembles all the early plays of Aristophanes in key aspects of its dramatic structure. Such resemblances are evidence of a genre of ancient drama known as Old Comedy. Variations from these &#x27;conventions&#x27; are significant since they demonstrate either a trend away from Old Comedy, a corruption in the text or a unique dramatic effect that the author intended. Variations in this play are found in the following conventions:
*Agon: The agon is a debate or formal argument constructed as a &#x27;symmetrical scene&#x27;, with two declaimed sections and two songs. The protagonist generally defeats the antagonist in the debate and this decides the outcome of the play long before the play actually ends. The agon in &quot;The Birds&quot; (lines 451–626) is conventional in form but there is no antagonist – the two main speakers are Pisthetaerus and his friend Euelpides, with Pisthetaerus delivering a speech and Euelpides providing supportive comments. The birds provide a willing audience and they are easily won over to the protagonist&#x27;s point of view. A similarly one-sided agon is found in the next surviving play, &quot;Lysistrata&quot;.
*Parabasis: The parabasis is an address to the audience by the Chorus in the absence of any actors. Generally there is a long parabasis in the middle of the play, including a &#x27;parabasis proper&#x27; in which the Chorus speaks as the author&#x27;s representative on issues relating to his career, and usually there is a shorter parabasis near the end. In this play, the first parabasis (678–800) and the second (1058–1117) are conventional in structure but the Chorus always speaks in character as birds. Instead of speaking about the poet in the &#x27;parabasis proper&#x27;, the birds speak about themselves, outlining their genealogy, their value to the audience and their effect on the audience&#x27;s vocabulary – in all these topics however there are amusing echoes of things a Chorus would ordinarily say on behalf of the poet. This &#x27;parabasis proper&#x27; is in fact almost a satire on the convention of a parabasis proper.
*Unwelcome Visitors: The protagonist&#x27;s early victory in the agon generally tends to ease dramatic tension early in the play and this is usually offset to some extent by a stream of minor characters or &#x27;unwelcome visitors&#x27; that have to be chased off by the triumphant hero. This play is exceptional in that there are three waves of unwelcome visitors – the first wave comes before the walls of Cloudcuckooland have been completed, the second wave comes immediately after and the third wave comes as a delegation from Zeus. This repetition is the reason why &quot;The Birds&quot; is much longer than the other surviving plays.

<text>The Malayan Union (; Jawi: كساتوان مالايا) was a union of the Malay states and the Straits Settlements of Penang and Malacca. It was the successor to British Malaya and was conceived to unify the Malay Peninsula under a single government to simplify administration. Following opposition by the ethnic Malays, the union was reorganised as the Federation of Malaya in 1948.

==Formation of the Malayan Union==
Prior to World War II, British Malaya consisted of three groups of polities: the protectorate of the Federated Malay States, five protected Unfederated Malay States and the crown colony of the Straits Settlements.

On 1 April 1946, the Malayan Union officially came into existence with Sir Edward Gent as its governor, combining the Federated Malay States, Unfederated Malay States and the Straits Settlements of Penang and Malacca under one administration. The capital of the Union was Kuala Lumpur. The former Straits Settlement of Singapore was administered as a separate crown colony.

The idea of the Union was first expressed by the British in October 1945 (plans had been presented to the War Cabinet as early as May 1944) in the aftermath of the Second World War by the British Military Administration. Sir Harold MacMichael was assigned the task of gathering the Malay state rulers&#x27; approval for the Malayan Union in the same month. In a short period of time, he managed to obtain all the Malay rulers&#x27; approval. The reasons for their agreement, despite the loss of political power that it entailed for the Malay rulers, has been much debated; the consensus appears to be that the main reasons were that as the Malay rulers were resident during the Japanese occupation, they were open to the accusation of collaboration, and that they were threatened with dethronement. Hence the approval was given, though it was with utmost reluctance.

When it was unveiled, the Malayan Union gave equal rights to people who wished to apply for citizenship. It was automatically granted to people who were born in any state in British Malaya or Singapore and were living there before 15 February 1942, born outside British Malaya or the Straits Settlements only if their fathers were citizens of the Malayan Union and those who reached 18 years old and who had lived in British Malaya or Singapore &quot;10 out of 15 years before 15 February 1942&quot;. The group of people eligible for application of citizenship had to live in Singapore or British Malaya &quot;for 5 out of 8 years preceding the application&quot;, had to be of good character, understand and speak the English or Malay language and &quot;had to take an oath of allegiance to the Malayan Union&quot;. However, the citizenship proposal was never actually implemented. Due to opposition to the citizenship proposal, it was postponed then modified, which made it harder for many Chinese and Indian residents to obtain Malayan citizenship.

The Sultans, the traditional rulers of the Malay states, conceded all their powers to the British Crown except in religious matters. The Malayan Union was placed under the jurisdiction of a British Governor, signalling the formal inauguration of British colonial rule in the Malay peninsula. Moreover, while the State Councils were still kept functioning in the former Federated Malay States, they lost the limited autonomy that they enjoyed, left to administer only some less important local aspects of government, and became an extended hand of the Federal government in Kuala Lumpur. Also, British Residents replacing the Sultans as the head of the State Councils meant that the political status of the Sultans was greatly reduced.

A Supreme Court was established in 1946 of which Harold Curwen Willan was the only Chief Justice.

==Opposition, dissolution of the Malayan Union and the creation of the Federation of Malaya==
The Malays generally opposed the creation of the Union. The opposition was due to the methods Sir Harold MacMichael used to acquire the Sultans&#x27; approval, the reduction of the Sultans&#x27; powers, and easy granting of citizenship to immigrants. The United Malays National Organisation or UMNO, a Malay political association formed by Dato&#x27; Onn bin Ja&#x27;afar on 10 May 1946, led the opposition against the Malayan Union. Malays also wore white bands around their heads, signifying their mourning for the loss of the Sultans&#x27; political rights.

After the inauguration of the Malayan Union, the Malays, under UMNO continued opposing the Malayan Union. They utilised civil disobedience as a means of protest by refusing to attend the installation ceremonies of the British governors. They had also refused to participate in the meetings of the Advisory Councils, hence Malay participation in the government bureaucracy and the political process had totally stopped. The British had recognised this problem and took measures to consider the opinions of the major races in Malaya before making amendments to the constitution. The Malayan Union was dissolved and replaced by the Federation of Malaya on 1 February 1948.

<text>Malaya, officially the Federation of Malaya, was a country in Southeast Asia from 1948 to 1963. It succeeded the Malayan Union and, before that, British Malaya. It comprised eleven states – nine Malay states and two of the Straits Settlements, Penang and Malacca. It was established on 1 February 1948. 

Initially a self-governing colony of the United Kingdom, Malaya became fully sovereign on 31 August 1957, and on 16 September 1963, Malaya was superseded by Malaysia when it united with Singapore, North Borneo (Sabah), and Sarawak. Singapore was expelled on 9 August 1965, leaving the original states of Malaya as well as Sarawak and Sabah – now also known as East Malaysia – making up modern-day Malaysia.

==History==
From 1946 to 1948, the eleven states formed a single British crown colony known as the Malayan Union. Due to opposition from Malay nationalists, the Union was disbanded and replaced by the Federation of Malaya, which restored the symbolic positions of the rulers of the Malay states.

Within the Federation, while the Malay states were protectorates of the United Kingdom, Penang and Malacca remained British colonial territories. Like the Malayan Union before it, the Federation did not include Singapore, despite its traditional connections with Malaya.

The Malaya Agreement was formulated by the British–Malay Pleno Conference between June and December 1946. At the end of the meeting, the Pleno Conference produced a 100-page &quot;Blue Book.&quot; It was signed on 21 January 1948 at King House by the Malay rulers, and by Sir Edward Gent as the representative of the British government. The Agreement superseded the Agreement creating the Malayan Union, and prepared for the establishment of the Federation of Malaya on 1 February 1948. The position of the Malay rulers was also restored.

The Federation became independent from British colonial rule and became an independent member of the Commonwealth of Nations on 31 August 1957. In 1963, the Federation was reconstituted as &quot;Malaysia&quot; when it federated with the British territories of Singapore, Sarawak, and North Borneo; a claim to the latter territory was maintained by the Philippines. Singapore separated from Malaysia to become an independent republic on 9 August 1965.

==List of member states==

==System of government==
The government of the Federation of Malaya was headed by a British High Commissioner with executive powers, assisted and advised by the Federation of Malaya Executive Council and the Federation of Malaya Legislative Council.
* The Federation of Malaya Executive Council comprised 7 official and 7 unofficial members.
* The Federation of Malaya Legislative Council comprised the High Commissioner as the Council President, 14 official and 50 unofficial members representing the Straits Settlements, business groups and all races. Additionally, 9 State Council &quot;Yang Di Pertua&quot; (heads of state), Chief Ministers and 2 representatives from the Straits Settlements became unofficial members.
* The Malay Conference of Rulers would advise the High Commissioner on immigration issues. The British Resident was replaced with a Chief Minister in each state of the federation.

===Conditions of citizenship===
The conditions of citizenship of the Federation of Malaya were further tightened using law enforcement and naturalisation by application. Under the laws, the following were automatically granted citizenship:
# Citizens of the Sultan of any state
# British subjects born in Penang or Malacca who have lived continuously for 15 years in the federation
# British subjects born in the federation whose fathers were born or lived continuously for 15 years in the federation
# Anyone born in the federation, conversant in the Malay language and following Malay traditions in his or her daily life
# Anyone born in the federation whose parents were born and lived continuously for 15 years in the federation

Via naturalisation (by application), one could achieve citizenship, given these criteria:

# Born and lived for at least 8 of 12 years in the Federation of Malaya before the application was made
# Lived in the Federation of Malaya for at least 15 of 20 years before the application was made

In both cases (via naturalisation), applications must be well-behaved, swear allegiance and clarify their reasons for living in the federation, and are fluent in either the Malay or the English language.

The Federation of Malaya, through its constitution, guarantees the rights and special position of the Malay people as well as rights, powers and sovereignty of the Malay rulers in their respective states.

===Separation of powers of the federal and state governments===
The federation agreement (Perjanjian Persekutuan) set the powers of the federal and state governments. Financial matters must be handled by the respective states. The Sultan was given full power on religious issues and Malay customs. Foreign policy and defence continued to be administered by the British government. The federation agreement was made the Constitution of the Federation of Malaya and officially declared on 1 February 1948.

==Federation of Malaya Legislative Council==

The Federation of Malaya Legislative Council held its first meeting in the Tuanku Abdul Rahman Hall, Kuala Lumpur in 1948. It was opened by the British High Commissioner Sir Edward Gent. Attendees included the British Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, Lord Listowel. The membership of the Council was structured to include:
* the British High Commissioner (as President);
* 3 &quot;ex officio&quot; members (namely the Chief Secretary, the Financial Secretary, and the Attorney General);
* 11 &quot;State and Settlement Members&quot; (the President of the Council of State of each Malay state, and a member elected by each of the Settlement Councils)
* 11 official members; and
* 34 appointed &quot;unofficial&quot; members.

The unofficial members were required to be either Federation citizens or British subjects.

In 1948 the ethnic composition of the council was made up as follows:
* 28 Malay representatives, including all the chief ministers,
* 14 Chinese representatives,
* 6 Indian representatives, and
* 14 Europeans (the &quot;ex officio&quot; and official members).

Dato&#x27; Onn Jaafar stressed at the first meeting that the citizens of the Federation of Malaya did not want the interference of external powers in the affairs of the Federation; the Chinese representative Ong Chong Keng asserted that the Chinese people would be loyal to the Federation of Malaya. At this first Council meeting, several minor committees were formed:
* the Standing Committee on Finance;
* the Election Committee; and
* the Committee of Privileges.

The first session passed the Kuala Lumpur City Bill, the Transfer of Power Bill, and the Loan and Debt Bill.

==Registration of PKMM rejected==
In 1950, the Federation of Malaya Government rejected the registration of the Malay Nationalist Party of Malaya (Parti Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya, PKMM) as a legitimate political party. PKMM had two wings, namely Angkatan Pemuda Insaf and Angkatan Wanita Sedar. Initially, PKMM did not have communist leanings. After Mokhtaruddin Lasso was elected as the first PKMM president in October 1946, this party was influenced with communism. The Young Malays Union (Kesatuan Melayu Muda, KMM) merged with PKMM, and Burhanuddin al-Helmy became the second PKMM president. Burhanuddin led PKMM toward the formation of Melayu Raya, a merger of Indonesia and Malaya. In December 1947, Ishak Haji Mohamed became the third PKMM president and PKMM switched from communism to nationalism. PKMM tended against United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and colonisation. PKKM established the Pusat Tenaga Rakyat (PUTERA), a conglomeration of radical Malay Political Parties and then merged with the All-Malaya Council of Joint Action (AMCJA) which thoroughly opposed the 1948 Federation Agreement for the foundation of the Federation of Malaya. PKMM accused officials selected in the Federation of Malaya of being &quot;puppets&quot; of the &quot;Colonial Office&quot;. For PKMM, there was no basis in &quot;preparing Malaya as a democratic government&quot;.

===Judiciary===
The judicial system was a typical hierarchical structure consisting of lower courts, a High Court and a Court of Appeal. Successive Chief Justices were Sir Stafford Foster-Sutton (1950–1951) (afterwards Chief Justice of Nigeria, 1955), Sir Charles Mathew (1951–1956) and Sir James Beveridge Thomson (1957–1963).

<text>El Hierro (), nicknamed Isla del Meridiano (the &quot;Meridian Island&quot;), is the farthest south and west of the Canary Islands (an autonomous community of Spain), in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa, with a population of 11,659 (2023). Its capital is Valverde. At , it is the second-smallest of the eight main islands of the Canaries.

== Name ==

The name &quot;El Hierro&quot;, although spelled like the Spanish word for &#x27;iron&#x27;, is not related to that word. The &quot;H&quot; in the name of the metal is derived from the &quot;F&quot; of Latin &quot;ferrum&quot; (compare &quot;higo&quot; for &#x27;fig&#x27;), a phonetic mutation that was complete by the end of the Middle Ages.

The confusion with the name of the metal had effects on the international naming of the island. As early as the 16th century, maps and texts called the island after the word for &#x27;iron&#x27; in other languages: Portuguese &quot;Ferro&quot;, French &quot;l&#x27;île de Fer&quot;, and Latin &quot;Insula Ferri&quot;.

Nevertheless, the origin of the name &quot;ero&quot; or &quot;erro&quot; or &quot;yerro&quot; is not definitely known. It is thought to be derived from one of several words in the Guanche language of the pre-Hispanic inhabitants, known as Bimbaches. Juan de Abreu Galindo (in a manuscript translated and published by George Glas in 1764) gives the native name of the island as Esero (or &quot;Eseró&quot;), meaning &#x27;strong&#x27;.
Richard Henry Major, however, in notes on his translation of &quot;Le Canarien&quot;, observes that the Guanche word &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;herro&quot;, meaning &#x27;cistern&#x27;, could easily have lapsed into &quot;hierro&quot; by a process of folk etymology. It is believed that the Bimbaches had to construct cisterns to save fresh rainwater. The &quot;Gran diccionario guanche&quot; gives the meaning of the Guanche word &quot;hero&quot; in Spanish as &quot;fuente&quot; (&#x27;spring [water source]&#x27;).

== History ==

The ancient natives of the island, called &quot;Bimbaches&quot;, were subjected to Spanish rule by Jean de Béthencourt (d.1425) – more by the process of negotiation than by military action. Béthencourt had as his ally and negotiator Augeron, brother of the island&#x27;s native monarch. Augeron had been captured years before by the Europeans and now served as mediator between the Europeans and the Guanches. In return for control over the island, Béthencourt promised to respect the liberty of the natives, but his son eventually broke his promise, selling many of the &quot;bimbaches&quot; into slavery. Many Frenchmen and Galicians subsequently settled on the island. There was a revolt of the natives against the harsh treatment of the governor Lázaro Vizcaíno, but it was suppressed.

===Landslides and tsunami===
There is evidence of at least three major landslides that have affected El Hierro in the last few hundred thousand years. The most recent of these was the &#x27;El Golfo&#x27; landslide that occurred about 15,000 years ago, involving collapse of the northern flank of the island. The landslide formed the El Golfo valley and created a debris avalanche with a volume of 150–180 km3. Turbidite deposits related to this landslide have been recognized in drill cores from the Agadir Basin to the north of the Canary Islands. Detailed analysis of these deposits suggests that the slope failure did not occur as a single event but a series of smaller failures over a period of hours or days. Local tsunami are likely to have been triggered by these landslides but no evidence has been found to confirm this. 

===2011 seismic activity===
The Instituto Vulcanológico de Canarias (Volcanological Institute of the Canary Islands) and National Geographic Institute&#x27;s seismic monitoring station located in Valverde detected increased seismic activity beginning on 17 July 2011. The seismic monitoring network was increased in density on 21 July to allow better detection and location of the seismic events. There was an earthquake swarm with in excess of 400 minor tremors between 20 July and 24 July; by 27 July a further 320 earthquakes had been recorded. On 25 August there were reports that some horizontal deformation had been detected, but that there was no unusual vertical deformation. At that time, the total number of tremors had exceeded 4,000.

Between 4;15 and 4:20 a.m. on 10 October 2011 the earthquake swarm changed behaviour and produced a harmonic tremor. Harmonic tremors are produced by magma movements and can indicate that an eruption has begun. Later the same day a small submarine eruption began, 7 km south of La Restinga. On 11 October the volcanic threat level at La Restinga was raised from &quot;yellow&quot; to &quot;red&quot; after minor rockfalls on the slopes above the town. Temporary evacuation of the 600 inhabitants was ordered and, despite a reduction in activity, they were still unable to return 20 days later.
As of 7 November 2011 a confirmed surtseyan type of eruption phase has started at the fissure. On 4 December 2011 the eruption was ongoing with vigorous phreatic bubbles emerging. After the 2011 eruption, fossils of single-celled marine organisms were found in restingolites, a type of tephra, that were released into the water.

== Climate ==

The precise climate of El Hierro depends on the area. The climate ranges are from subtropical Mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot; / &quot;Csb&quot;) in the center of the island, to semi-arid (&quot;BSh&quot;) and to a desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) in coastal sections (according to the Köppen climate classification). It also has tropical climate (&quot;As&quot;) influences on some areas, as the coldest month average temperature does not fall below , but as precipitation is very low, the arid/semi-arid climate overlaps with the tropical climate, and therefore, its official classification according to AEMET is semi-arid or arid, depending on the exact area of the island. The temperatures are greatly influenced by the ocean. This is the climate chart from El Hierro Airport, which is the only airport in the island:


===Note===
==Geography, flora and fauna==
El Hierro&#x27;s size and geography supports entirely endemic species including the critically endangered El Hierro giant lizard (&quot;Gallotia simonyi&quot;), for which there is a captive breeding programme, allowing its reintroduction.

The non-barren parts of the interior rely on relief precipitation, not much more than the average of 19 rainfall days per year, high relative humidity and geothermal springs. This non-arid parts have thermophilous (geothermal heat-liking) juniper clumps and a pine forest with other evergreens.
In 2000, El Hierro was designated by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve, with 60% of its territory protected to preserve its natural and cultural diversity. Among cetaceans in these waters, it is notable that several species of lesser known beaked whales inhabit around the island.

Like the rest of the Canary Islands chain, El Hierro is volcanic and sharply mountainous. One eruption has to date been recorded on the island, but is not confirmed: from the Volcan de Lomo Negro vent in 1793, lasting a month. A submarine eruption occurred, however, offshore La Restinga village in 2011/2012. Except as landscaped at its harbour towns the shore is rocky and in places precipitous.

El Hierro is a island, formed late, about 1.2 million years ago after three successive eruptions, the island emerged from the ocean as a triangle of basaltic dykes topped with a volcanic cone more than 2,000 metres high. With continued activity resulting in the island expanding to have the largest number of volcanoes in the Canaries (over 500 cones, another 300 covered by more recent deposits), together with approximately 70 caves and volcanic galleries, including the Cueva de Don Justo whose collection of channels exceeds 6 km. Landslides, plant erosion and seasonal wind erosion have reduced the size and height of the island.
The current highest point is in the middle of the island, in Malpaso, at high.

==Tourism and transportation==

Like all of the Canary Islands, El Hierro is a tourist destination. It is served by a small airport—El Hierro Airport at Valverde—and a ferry terminal at Puerto de la Estaca, both of which connect to Tenerife. Though El Hierro has a Parador, hotel accommodations are generally in small family enterprises; as a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve, El Hierro has limited construction to less than half of its total surface and buildings to two floors, maintaining its traditional look and social structure more than the other six major Canary Islands.

== Political organization ==
The island is part of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and includes three municipalities:
Valverde is situated in the northeast and Frontera in the west, both contain several villages.

The seat of the island government (&quot;cabildo insular&quot;) is in the town of Valverde, which houses approximately half of the island&#x27;s population.

== Migration ==
El Hierro and the Canaries have become bases for migration out of Africa. In early October 2023 boats carrying well over one thousand migrants had arrived within a few days many of them on &quot;Spanish Lampedusa&quot;. &quot;It is believed that the increase in arrivals in the Canary Islands is linked to the political and social crisis in Senegal.&quot;

== The &quot;Meridian Island&quot; ==

El Hierro was used in various parts of Europe for more than 500 years as the prime meridian, especially outside of the future British Empire. By the 2nd century CE, Ptolemy already considered a definition of the zero meridian based on the westernmost piece of land in the (known) world, giving a few maps with only positive, eastern longitudes.

In 1634, in France, as ruled by Louis XIII and his minister Richelieu, it was decided that Ferro&#x27;s meridian should be used as a key reference of maps, in consideration of the island&#x27;s historic meridian and status as the westernmost-known land of peoples of the &#x27;Known World&#x27;. Flores Island is the westernmost Azore discovered by the Portuguese navigators in the early 15th century—after the First Voyage of Columbus in 1492 scholars and cartographers sometimes grouped them among the new world. The Paris elite considered El Hierro to be exactly 20° west of the Paris meridian (th of its relevant parallel of the globe).

Old international maps (outside of Anglo-North American realms) often have a common grid with Paris degrees at the top and Ferro degrees (offset by 20 from Paris) at the bottom. Louis Feuillée also worked on this problem in 1724.

== Festivals ==
The most important festival of El Hierro is the &quot;Bajada de la Virgen de los Reyes&quot;, held every four years, on the first Saturday of July (the last occasion was in 2021, and the next will be in 2025). During the festival, the Virgin of the Kings (&quot;Virgen de los Reyes&quot;, patron saint of the island of El Hierro) is taken from her sanctuary in La Dehesa (in the municipality of La Frontera) and carried to the capital of the island, Valverde, making a tour of 44 kilometres and running through all the towns of El Hierro.

The annual festival of the Virgin is celebrated every September 24.

== Natural symbols ==

The official natural symbols associated with El Hierro are &quot;Gallotia simonyi machadoi&quot; (El Hierro giant lizard) and &quot;Juniperus phoenicea&quot; (Sabina).

== Energy ==

According to the Ministry for Industry, Tourism and Commerce, El Hierro hopes to become the first island in the world to be self-sufficient for electrical energy. This will be achieved through a €54 million project combining a greater than 11-megawatt wind farm and two hydroelectric projects.

This hydro and wind-power project, created by the local Gorona del Viento El Hierro consortium with financial aid from the European Union, and officially inaugurated in 2015, consists of five E-70 wind turbines capable of producing 11.5 megawatts of wind power to supply electricity for approximately 11,000 residents, an additional number of tourists, and three water desalination facilities. The hybrid wind/pumped hydro storage system stores surplus wind power by pumping water up 700 metres (approximately 2,300 feet) to the crater of an extinct volcano. When winds are calm or when demand exceeds supply, water is released from the crater to generate 11.3 MW of electricity, filling a smaller artificial basin created at the bottom of the extinct volcano. Water in the lower basin is then pumped back up again to the upper reservoir when there is excess wind power.

The closed-loop hybrid wind/hydro system is expected to save approximately US$4M per year (calculated with January 2011 oil prices) previously spent on about 40,000 barrels of crude oil imported annually, attempting to make the island completely self-sufficient for electrical energy.

2016 was the first whole year for the power plant and it reached 40.7% of the total demand, reducing consumption of diesel by 6,000 tonnes. In 2017, the share climbed to 46.5%. The installation also powers a desalination plant that provides fresh water.

In early 2018, El Hierro covered its entire electricity demand between 25 January and 12 February with its renewable resource base, avoiding the use of polluting energy sources for more than 560 hours in 2018—and a total of almost 2,000 hours since it started operating. 

== Bimbache openART Festival ==
The Bimbache openART Festival and Global Initiative for Arts and Sustainability, founded in 2005 by German-born guitarist Torsten de Winkel and other community activists, is a non-profit effort at creating an interdisciplinary platform which seeks to bridge traditional divides, both on a musical and human level, in a globalizing world. The festival is a contribution of the international artist community to El Hierro&#x27;s &quot;Sustainable Island&quot; program and collaborates with scientists and sustainability-oriented organizations from around the world.

== El Hierro in literature ==
The island of Hierro is mentioned (1) in Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;The Island of the Day Before&quot; (&quot;&quot;, 1994), about a 17th-century Italian nobleman trapped on an island on the International Date Line; (2) in Christopher Isherwood&#x27;s short story &quot;The Turn Round the World&quot;, collected in his &quot;Exhumations&quot; (1966); and (3) in the first chapter of Steven Callahan&#x27;s (1986) maritime chronicle &quot;Adrift&quot;, in which El Hierro is his final port of departure for an ill-fated Atlantic crossing.

<text>John Raymond Dyer Sr. OAM (15 November 1913 – 23 August 2003), nicknamed Captain Blood, was an Australian rules footballer who played for the Richmond Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL) between 1931 and 1949. One of the game&#x27;s most prominent players, he was one of 12 inaugural &quot;Legends&quot; inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. He later turned to coaching and work in the media as a popular broadcaster and journalist.

== Early life ==

Dyer was born in Oakleigh, now a south-eastern suburb of Melbourne, but grew up in the small farming hamlet of Yarra Junction on the Yarra River, approximately east of the city. His parents, Ben and Nellie, were of Irish descent. The second of three children, Dyer had an elder brother, Vin, and a younger sister, Eileen. Dyer first played football at the Yarra Junction primary school. For his secondary education, Dyer was sent by his parents to St Ignatius in Richmond. He boarded in the city with an aunt. One of the brothers running the school offered Dyer a sporting scholarship to De La Salle College, Malvern. After leaving school with several sporting trophies, Dyer played with St Ignatius on Saturdays and with Richmond Hill Old Boys in a mid-week competition. Dyer&#x27;s desire was to play for Richmond in the VFL as he admired one of the Tigers&#x27; players, George Rudolph.

== Sporting career ==

In 1930, Dyer won the Metropolitan League&#x27;s award for the best player at the age of 16. Richmond officials had not yet attempted to sign him, and Dyer applied for a clearance to play with the Tigers&#x27; main rival, Collingwood. The Richmond officials wanted to see him in action before any decision was made and Dyer was in training with Richmond for the start of the 1931 season. Richmond&#x27;s coach &#x27;Checker&#x27; Hughes pitting Dyer against veteran Joe Murdoch in a practice session. Dyer hardly touched the ball and was disheartened about his prospects until Hughes consoled him by explaining the pairing with Murdoch was a trial of courage, not skill.

Hughes selected him for his debut in just the second game of the season, against North Melbourne. Dyer was made a reserve while the team achieved a VFL record score of 30.19 (199) in one of the biggest wins in VFL/AFL history. Hughes left Dyer on the bench. It was the height of the Great Depression and the going rate for the players was 3 pounds per match, but Richmond only paid half that for unused reserves, so Hughes saved the club thirty shillings on the day. Dyer got another couple of chances and showed some form, but by mid-season found himself in the seconds team, with players who were not quite league standard, but wanted to stay on at the club and earn an extra few shillings per week to support their families.

At one point, Dyer walked away from Richmond for a few weeks and returned to suburban football. Club secretary Percy Page persuaded him back by promising to clear any recalcitrant players. In the run up to the finals, with Richmond sitting second on the ladder, ruckman Percy Bentley went down with an injury that ended his season. Hughes included Dyer in the Tigers&#x27; team for the second semi final against Geelong. Playing mainly up forward, the unknown Dyer played a successful game, kicking three goals. In the Grand Final a fortnight later, again against Geelong, Geelong used their player and coach &quot;Bull&quot; Coghlan playing on Dyer. Coghlan played roughly against Dyer; Dyer had only four touches for the day and admitted many years later to being intimidated.

In 1932, partnering Bentley in the ruck, Dyer played successfully in the first half of the season before suffering a serious knee injury that put him out for the rest of the year. In ten matches, Dyer received 12 Brownlow medal votes for four best afield performances. He was chosen for Victoria after fewer than a dozen league matches. On Grand Final day, Dyer was back in reserve as his teammates won Richmond&#x27;s third premiership after several finals failures.

Dyer did reappear in 1933, wearing a dirty knee bandage. In his own phrase, Dyer was unable to &quot;turn off&quot; or &quot;pull up&quot; and he sometimes collected a teammate if his timing was out. In the Grand Final against South Melbourne, Richmond lost by eight goals, but Dyer achieved thirty touches. In the following year&#x27;s Grand Final, the Tigers won in a rematch with the Swans. Richmond&#x27;s successfully used a ruck combination of Bentley, Dyer and rover Ray Martin.

== Captain Blood ==

The number of on-field incidents grew and after a particularly difficult game during 1935, newspaper cartoonist John Ludlow in &quot;The Age&quot; drew a picture of Dyer as a pirate and a journalist nicknamed him &#x27;Captain Blood&#x27;, after the Errol Flynn film &quot;Captain Blood&quot;. Initially, Dyer was angry at the connotation and the implied slur on his sportsmanship. Dyer preferred the &#x27;hip and shoulder&#x27; method of meeting an opponent rather than grabbing him in a tackle. The force of being hit by the athletic, 89 kg frame of Dyer was often enough to leave a player prostrate and not wanting to re-enter the fray for a while. Occasionally, the hip and shoulder could go awry and Dyer&#x27;s forearm would come into play, which was a reportable offence. In a nineteen-year career, he was reported five times and suspended once.

Dyer was keen to take on a coaching role, and had reportedly been promised the position of playing coach by the Richmond committee at the end of 1939 before it reneged and re-appointed Percy Bentley. As a consequence, Dyer announced that he would not play for Richmond in 1940. He received a lucrative offer to become captain-coach of the Yarraville Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (which, at the time, was aggressively recruiting VFL stars to play under its new throw-pass rules), and he lodged a request with Richmond for a clearance to the VFA club. Richmond rejected the clearance, and Dyer was unwilling to transfer without a clearance (even though one was not required at the time). Dyer ultimately decided to remain with Richmond as a player in 1940, and he was appointed captain-coach in 1941.

He went on to play 312 games for Richmond, being voted the club&#x27;s best and fairest player in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, and 1946. He played in seven Grand Finals for two premierships in 1934 and 1943, one as captain and playing coach of the side.
Dyer was a ruckman; and, at 6&#x27;1&quot; (185 cm), was not particularly tall for that position. Possessed of great strength, he was adept at punching the ball out of a pack contesting a mark, often sending the ball more than 40 yards.

In 1947, Dyer crashed into Melbourne&#x27;s Frank Hanna in round 15. The umpire cleared him for rough conduct, though Hanna was knocked unconscious. Don Cordner checked his pulse and Hanna was covered with a blanket, including his head, and was carried off on a stretcher. Dyer thought he had killed Hanna. By three-quarter time, he still believed he had killed him until he asked a Demon player about Hanna&#x27;s condition, and Hanna had recovered.

He was selected as an interchange player in the AFL&#x27;s 1996 Team of the Century&quot;. He gradually played less as a ruckman and more as a forward later in his career. He invented the drop punt, a kicking style that gradually gained popularity over the intervening decades and is now almost universal, and has now spread to Rugby union, rugby league and American football. He kicked 443 goals, fifth on Richmond&#x27;s list of all-time goalkickers.

In 2009, &quot;The Australian&quot; nominated Dyer as one of the 25 greatest footballers never to win a Brownlow medal.

The &quot;Jack Dyer Medal&quot; is awarded each season to the winner of the Richmond Football Club&#x27;s best and fairest count. Since the 2000s, the Richmond captain has automatically switched to wearing guernsey number 17, the number worn by Dyer throughout his career. But when Trent Cotchin took over the captaincy of the Tigers in 2013, he continued wearing his number 9.

== Rescindment of Dyer&#x27;s 1932 best and fairest award ==
Following a 19-year investigation undertaken by members of the Historical Committee, no evidence was found to have any winner of a &quot;Best and Fairest Award&quot; for Richmond in 18 of the seasons between 1911 and 1936. It is thought that the awards in question were retrospectively added in 1988 and 1991 in error. As a consequence, he now shares his Richmond best and fairest tally record of 5 with fellow AFL Legend Kevin Bartlett.

== Personal life ==
He married Sybil Margaret McCasker, the cousin of Keith &quot;Bluey&quot; Truscott, on 25 November 1939 at St Ignatius&#x27; Church, Richmond.

After an assortment of jobs in his early adulthood, Dyer joined the police force in July 1935. Dyer served in the police for nine years, before he resigned to conduct a milk bar, &quot;The Tiger Milk Bar and Newsagency&quot; at 394 Church Street, Richmond. In 1949 he became the publican at the &quot;Foresters&#x27; Arms Hotel&quot; in Port Melbourne, and in 1952, the publican at the &quot;Post Office Hotel&quot; in Prahran.

On 8 March 1940, Richmond announced that they had refused the recently married Dyer a clearance to coach VFA club Yarraville; and Dyer stated that he would not cross to Yarraville without a clearance.

He and his wife Sybil had two children, Jack Jr (Jackie, born 15 December 1940) and Jill (married name Devine). Jackie had a brief career at Punt Road from 1959 to 1961, playing three games, but retired from all football aged just 23. 

Following Sybil&#x27;s sudden death in 1968, Dyer met Dorothy Eskell, with whom he spent 25 years. Dorothy supported him in his media career, and they lived together in Frankston. In his final years, Dyer lived in a nursing home.

== Media career ==

After retiring from coaching, Dyer turned to the media, where he became a commentator and football media personality. He contributed to two sports/comedy offerings on Melbourne television: &quot;World of Sport&quot;, a Sunday morning panel show; and, later, &quot;League Teams&quot;, a Thursday-night variant which later inspired &quot;AFL Footy Show&quot;. He also had a regular column which went under the name &quot;Dyer &#x27;ere&quot; (a pun on diarrhoea) in Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;Truth&quot; newspaper.

His media work began after resigning from the coaching position at Richmond. Dyer, along with former Collingwood captain Lou Richards, became an early television commentator on Australian football after the medium was introduced to Australia in 1956.

Dyer also was a radio broadcaster – for many years, he and Ian Major called football matches for radio station 3KZ (KZ-FM after the station converted to FM in 1990) as &quot;The Captain and The Major&quot;.

=== &quot;Dyerisms&quot; ===
According to various historical articles, videos, quotes on the official Richmond website, and press obituaries, Dyer was responsible for many malapropisms, witticisms, and comical gaffes, including:
*&quot;Yes, we had an enjoyable time on the French Riverina&quot; (the Riverina is a highly productive agricultural region of south-western New South Wales), and he described the problems with younger players by saying that &quot;All they want to do is sit around and smoke marinara&quot;.
Other memorable quotes include:
*&quot;I won&#x27;t say anything in case I say something.&quot;
*&quot;Bartlett&#x27;s older than he&#x27;s ever been before.&quot;
*&quot;Johnston missed one from the 10-yard square – it was impossible to miss that.&quot;
*&quot;The only way to tackle Justin Madden is . . . I don&#x27;t know.&quot;
*&quot;That&#x27;s the beauty of being small – your hands are close to your feet.&quot;
*&quot;Bamblett made a great debut last week, and an even better one today.&quot;
*&quot;The ball goes to Marceesie ... Marcheson ... McKann, er ...&quot; before co-commentator Ian Major interjected: &quot;Actually, Jack, I don&#x27;t think Marchesani was in that passage of play.&quot;
*&quot;Mark Lee&#x27;s long arms reaching up like giant testicles.&quot;
*&quot;It&#x27;s as dark out there as the Black Hole of Dakota.&quot;
*&quot;The goal posts are moving so fast I can&#x27;t keep up with the play.&quot;
*And on &quot;World of Sport&quot;, Dyer declared that Fitzroy had &quot;copulated to the opposition&quot;
*“He keeps getting where the ball ain&#x27;t.”
*“Henshaw passes the ball to Kelly, and Kelly gives a Henshaw to Glendinning.”
*“There weren’t too many best mans on the ground.”
*If you don&#x27;t mind, umpire, please!
*“He’s tuckled strongly by Tack.”
*During his coaching career at Richmond, Jack once instructed his players in a training session to “pair off in threes”.
*He once said that he hated Collingwood so much, he couldn’t even watch black-and-white TV.

== Retirement ==
Retiring from the media in the early 1990s, when KZ-FM stopped broadcasting football, Dyer successfully led opposition to an AFL proposed merger of his old club with St Kilda in 1989.

==Photograph from 1944 Essendon match==
A photograph was taken of Richmond captain-coach Dyer, aged 30 and playing his 222nd game, wearing white strapping on his left thumb and a dirty knee bandage on his left knee, breaking away from the pack, with his eyes fixed on the lake-end goals (Dyer went on to kick a goal) in the last quarter of the 1944 Preliminary Final, held at the Junction Oval on Saturday 23 September 1944, in which Richmond defeated Essendon, primarily due to Dyer&#x27;s nine goals.

Led by a four-goal burst by Dyer, who was playing at full-forward, Richmond scored 8.2 (50) to 0.5 (5) in the first quarter (kicking against the wind); and, although Essendon outscored Richmond in the last three quarters, Richmond won the match 16.12 (108) to 12.15 (87).

Dyer&#x27;s performance that day was one of the best individual performances by a Richmond player in the club&#x27;s history. A match reporter for &quot;The Argus&quot;, in an article titled &quot;Dyer&#x27;s Grand First Quarter&quot;, wrote:

The photograph, which also appeared on the cover of the Australian Post&#x27;s $4.50 booklet of ten &quot;Richmond Tigers&quot; postage stamps issued in 1996 as part of the &quot;centenary of the AFL&quot; celebrations, has also been the basis for:
* The logo of &quot;The Footy Show&quot;,
* Mitch Mitchell&#x27;s statue of Dyer at Punt Road Oval,
* A set of four paintings by John Balmain of Ron Todd, Jack Dyer, John Coleman, and Alex Jesaulenko, issued in 1996 to celebrate the VFL/AFL centenary. All were taken from photographs; Dyer&#x27;s was taken from the photograph of his break to score his ninth goal. It was also painted by Darcy Doyle, which was also used on the front cover of Brian Hansen&#x27;s 1996 book.

==Order of Australia Medal (OAM) ==
John Raymond Dyer was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the General Division (OAM), in the 1990 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List, &quot;for service to Australian Rules Football&quot;.

<text>The Forbidden Forest (; ) is a 1955 novel by the Romanian writer Mircea Eliade. The story takes place between 1936 and 1948 in Bucharest and several other European cities, and follows a Romanian man who is on a spiritual quest while being torn between two women. The book was written between the years 1949 and 1954. It contains several elements and themes which also appear in the author&#x27;s scholarly work, such as initiation rites and the division between sacred and profane time.

==Plot==
Stefan Viziru lives in Bucharest and works for the Romanian state. He lives with his wife Ioana and also has a mistress, Ileana, whom he met at a Midsummer celebration. Stefan is torn between his affection for both women and is at the same time on a spiritual quest. He wishes to discover a sacred time which stands independently from the historical time and the destructive developments in contemporary Europe. Stefan befriends several people who influence him. A philosophy teacher argues that Stefan is searching for the paradise of his childhood. When Stefan tries to provide refuge for a member of the Iron Guard, he is put in a prison camp and temporarily loses his job. Ileana becomes engaged to an officer who dies in a car accident, after which she leaves Bucharest.

Stefan&#x27;s wife Ioana and their son die in the bombings of Bucharest in 1944. Stefan realises that he loves Ileana and sets out to find her. He travels around Europe and goes through a lot of searching. Eventually he finds her, on Midsummer&#x27;s eve of 1948 in a forest in France. As they leave the forest together they are killed in a car accident.

==Publication==
The novel was first published by Éditions Gallimard in 1955 in a French translation by Alain Guillermou. The original Romanian version was published in 1971. An English translation by Mac Linscott Ricketts and Mary Park Stevenson was published in 1978 through University of Notre Dame Press.

==Reception==
Eliade himself considered &quot;The Forbidden Forest&quot; to be his best work. It received little response from the academic world upon the initial publication, although the Swedish professor Stig Wikander wrote a positive review for &quot;Sydsvenska Dagbladet Snällposten&quot;. The novel received the Fantastic and Fantasy Award for best novel at Eurocon 1978 in Brussel.

&quot;Chronicles of Culture&quot; reviewed the book in 1980:
Both fiction and epic, &quot;The Forbidden Forest&quot; is an exceptional book about war and peace. Not unlike the Russian masterpiece bearing that title, Eliade&#x27;s novel transcends the particulars of its subject matter—in this case, Romania at the outset of the Second World War—to explore the agonies of man&#x27;s condition, his inevitable recourse to violence as he fails to understand others and, above all, himself.

== Adaptations ==
=== Music ===
* Romanian composer Serban Nichifor released the poem &quot;The Forbidden Forest – Homage to Mircea Eliade&quot; for piano (2021). The poem is based on the novel.
