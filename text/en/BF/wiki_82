<text>A feral (; ) animal or plant is one that lives in the wild but is descended from domesticated individuals. As with an introduced species, the introduction of feral animals or plants to non-native regions may disrupt ecosystems and has, in some cases, contributed to extinction of indigenous species. The removal of feral species is a major focus of island restoration.

==Animals==

A feral animal is one that has escaped from a domestic or captive status and is living more or less as a wild animal, or one that is descended from such animals. Other definitions include animals that have changed from being domesticated to being wild, natural, or untamed. Some common examples of animals with feral populations are horses, dogs, goats, cats, rabbits, camels, and pigs. Zoologists generally exclude from the feral category animals that were genuinely wild before they escaped from captivity: neither lions escaped from a zoo nor the white-tailed eagles re-introduced to the UK are regarded as feral.

==Plants==
Domesticated plants that revert to wild are referred to as escaped, introduced, naturalized, or sometimes as feral crops. Individual plants are known as volunteers. Large numbers of escaped plants may become a noxious weed. The adaptive and ecological variables seen in plants that go wild closely resemble those of animals. Feral populations of crop plants, along with hybridization between crop plants and their wild relatives, brings a risk that genetically engineered characteristics such as pesticide resistance could be transferred to weed plants. The unintended presence of genetically modified crop plants or of the modified traits in other plants as a result of cross-breeding is known as &quot;adventitious presence (AP)&quot;.

==Species of feral animals==
The cat returns readily to a feral state if it has not been socialized when young. Feral cats, especially if left to proliferate, are frequently considered to be pests in both rural and urban areas, and may be blamed for devastating the bird, reptile, and mammal populations. A local population of feral cats living in an urban area and using a common food source is sometimes called a feral cat colony. As feral cats multiply quickly, it is difficult to control their populations. Animal shelters attempt to adopt out feral cats, especially kittens, but often are overwhelmed with sheer numbers and euthanasia is used. In rural areas of the US, excessive numbers of feral cats are often shot. The &quot;trap-neuter-return&quot; method has been used in many locations as an alternative means of managing the feral cat population.
The goat is one of the oldest domesticated creatures, yet readily returns to a feral state. Sheep are close contemporaries and cohorts of goats in the history of domestication, but the domestic sheep is vulnerable to predation and injury, and thus rarely seen in a feral state. However, in places where there are few predators, they may thrive, for example in the case of the Soay sheep. Both goats and sheep were sometimes intentionally released and allowed to go feral on island waypoints frequented by mariners, to serve as a ready food source.

The dromedary camel, which has been domesticated for over 3,000 years, will also readily go feral. A substantial population of feral dromedaries, descended from pack animals that escaped in the 19th and early 20th centuries, thrives in the Australian interior today.

Water buffalo run rampant in Western and Northern Australia. The Australian government encourages the hunting of feral water buffalo because of their large numbers.

Cattle have been domesticated since the neolithic era, but can survive on open range for months or years with little or no supervision. Their ancestors, the aurochs, were aggressive, similar to the modern Cape buffalo. Modern cattle, especially those raised on open range, are generally more docile, but when threatened can display aggression. Cattle, particularly those raised for beef, are often allowed to roam quite freely and have established long term independence in Australia, New Zealand and several Pacific Islands along with small populations of semi-feral animals roaming the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Such cattle are variously called mavericks, scrubbers or cleanskins. Most free roaming cattle, however untamed, are generally too valuable not to be eventually rounded up and recovered in closely settled regions.

Horses and donkeys, domesticated about 5000 BCE, are feral in open grasslands worldwide. In Australia, they are known as Brumbies; in the American west, they are called mustangs. Other isolated feral populations exist, including the Chincoteague Pony and the Banker horse. They are often referred to as &quot;wild horses&quot;, but this is a misnomer. There are truly &quot;wild&quot; horses that have never been domesticated, most notably Przewalski&#x27;s horse. While the horse was originally indigenous to North America, the wild ancestor died out at the end of the last ice age. In both Australia and the Americas, modern &quot;wild&quot; horses descended from domesticated horses brought by European explorers and settlers that escaped, spread, and thrived. Australia hosts a feral donkey population, as do the Virgin Islands and the American southwest.
The pig has established feral populations worldwide, including in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, New Guinea and the Pacific Islands. Pigs were introduced to the Melanesian and Polynesian regions by humans from several thousand to 500 years ago, and to the Americas within the past 500 years. In Australia, domesticated pigs escaped in the 18th century, and now cover 40 percent of Australia, with a population estimated at 30 million. While pigs are thought to have been brought to New Zealand by the original Polynesian settlers, this population had become extinct by the time of European colonization, and all feral pigs in New Zealand today are descendants of European stock. Many European wild boar populations are also partially descended from escaped domestic pigs and are thus feral animals within the native range of the ancestral species.
Rock doves were formerly kept for their meat or more commonly as racing animals and have established feral populations in cities worldwide.

Colonies of honey bees often escape into the wild from managed apiaries when they swarm; their behavior, however, is no different from their behavior in captivity, unless they breed with other feral honey bees of a different genetic stock, which may lead them to become more docile or more aggressive (see Africanized bees).

Large colonies of feral parrots are present in various parts of the world, with rose-ringed parakeets, monk parakeets and red-masked parakeets (the latter of which became the subject of the documentary film, &quot;The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill&quot;) being particularly successful outside of their native habitats and adapting well to suburban environments.
Wild cocks are derived from domestic chickens (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;) who have returned to the wild. Like the red junglefowl (the closest wild relative of domestic chickens), wild cocks will take flight and roost in tall trees and bushes in order to avoid predators at night. Wild cocks typically form social groups composed of, a dominant cockerel, several hens, and subordinate cocks. Sometimes the dominant cockerel is designated by a fight between cocks.

==Effects of feralization==

===Ecological impact===

A feral population can have a significant impact on an ecosystem by predation on vulnerable plants or animals, or by competition with indigenous species. Feral plants and animals constitute a significant share of invasive species, and can be a threat to endangered species. However, they may also replace species lost from an ecosystem on initial human arrival to an area, or increase the biodiversity of a human-altered area by being able to survive in it in ways local species cannot. Feral zebu have been reintroduced in Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in order to replace their ancestor, the aurochs.

===Genetic pollution===

Animals of domestic origin sometimes can produce fertile hybrids with native, wild animals which leads to genetic pollution (not a clear term itself) in the naturally evolved wild gene pools, many times threatening rare species with extinction. Cases include the mallard duck, wild boar, the rock dove or pigeon, the red junglefowl (&quot;Gallus gallus&quot;) (ancestor of all chickens), carp, and more recently salmon. Other examples of genetic swamping lie in the breeding history of dingoes. Dingoes are wild true dogs that will interbreed with dogs of other origins, thus leading to the proliferation of dingo hybrids and the possibility of the extinction of pure wild dingoes. Researches in Scotland have remarked on a similar phenomenon of the genetic mixing of feral domestic cats and their wild counterparts.

===Economic harm===
Feral animals compete with domestic livestock, and may degrade fences, water sources, and vegetation (by overgrazing or introducing seeds of invasive plants). Although hotly disputed, some cite as an example the competition between feral horses and cattle in the western United States. Another example is of goats competing with cattle in Australia, or goats that degrade trees and vegetation in environmentally-stressed regions of Africa. Accidental crossbreeding by feral animals may result in harm to breeding programs of pedigreed animals; their presence may also excite domestic animals and push them to escape. Feral populations can also pass on transmissible infections to domestic herds. Loss to farmers by aggressive feral dog population is common in India.

===Economic benefits===
Many feral animals can sometimes be captured at little cost and thus constitute a significant resource. Throughout most of Polynesia and Melanesia feral pigs constitute the primary sources of animal protein. Prior to the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, American mustangs were routinely captured and sold for horsemeat. In Australia, feral goats, pigs, horses, and dromedaries are harvested for the export for their meat trade. At certain times, animals were sometimes deliberately left to go feral, typically on islands, in order to be later recovered for profit or food use for travellers (particularly sailors) at the end of a few years.

===Scientific value===
Populations of feral animals present good sources for studies of population dynamics, and especially of ecology and behavior (ethology) in a wide state of species known mainly in a domestic state. Such observations can provide useful information for the stock breeders or other owners of the domesticated &quot;conspecifics&quot; (i.e. animals of the same species).

===Cultural or historic value===
American mustangs have been protected since 1971 in part due to their romance and connection to the history of the American West.
A similar situation is that of the Danube Delta horse from the Letea Forest in the Danube Delta. The Romanian government is considering the protection of the feral horses and transforming them into a tourist attraction, after it first approved the killing of the entire population. Due to the intervention of numerous organizations and widespread popular disapproval of the Romanians the horses have been saved, but still have an uncertain fate as their legal status is unclear and local people continue to claim the right to use the horses in their own interest.

<text>Lance Timothy Evers (; born April 3, 1969), known professionally by his ring name Lance Storm, is a Canadian retired professional wrestler. He is signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he works as a producer. He is best known for his tenures in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (WWF/WWE), where he held a combined 14 total championships (including holding three titles simultaneously in WCW).

Storm began his career in 1990, training with Chris Jericho. They worked together in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), forming a tag team known as the Thrillseekers. In 1997, Storm joined ECW, where he worked with Justin Credible as the Impact Players. He stayed with ECW until 2000, then signed with World Championship Wrestling. In WCW, Storm won the United States, Cruiserweight and Hardcore Championships at the same time, renaming them as Canadian, 100 kg and Under Championship, and Saskatchewan Hardcore International Title.

When WCW closed, his contract was bought by World Wrestling Federation (WWF), being involved in The Invasion storyline. He kept wrestling with WWF (later WWE) until 2005, when he left. Since then, Storm focused on the independent circuit as well as his training school, the Storm Wrestling Academy, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

==Early life==
Lance Timothy Evers was born in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, on April 3, 1969. Evers graduated from West Ferris Secondary School in North Bay, Ontario, and attended Wilfrid Laurier University School of Business and Economics in Waterloo, playing volleyball throughout.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Training, various promotions and Japan (1990–1996) ===
Lance Storm was trained by Ed Langley and Brad Young of the Hart Brothers Wrestling Camp at the Silver Dollar Action Centre in Calgary, where he became friends with fellow student Chris Jericho. Jericho has stated that despite the name of the school, the only involvement any of the Hart brothers had in their training was a &quot;thirty-minute cameo&quot; by Keith Hart to collect the student&#x27;s fees. Lance would later debut against Jericho in 1990 as &quot;Lance T. Storm&quot;. Early on, he mainly wrestled in Calgary but also spent time in Japan in Wrestling Association &quot;R&quot;. Along with Jericho, Storm debuted in Smoky Mountain Wrestling in 1994, forming a tag team known as the Thrillseekers. After Jericho was injured, Storm continued to compete in singles competition for a few months, even winning the &quot;Beat the Champ&quot; TV Title. He then left SMW and moved on to a Winnipeg-based West Four Wrestling Alliance, where he teamed once again with Jericho. In 1995, he began wrestling in Japan for WAR. He formed a tag team with Yuji Yasuraoka (with whom he held the WAR International Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship numerous times), as well as forming a trio with Nobutaka Araya and Koki Kitahara, with whom he held the WAR World Six-Man Tag Team Championship.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997–2000) ===

====Teaming and feuding with Chris Candido (1997–1998)====
In 1997, Storm joined Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), making his debut at Crossing the Line Again against Balls Mahoney. Early in his ECW career, he took part in a match against Rob Van Dam at Barely Legal where he was booed by the crowd for two visibly &quot;weak&quot; chair shots to Van Dam. At Heat Wave, Storm faced Taz for the ECW World Television Championship but failed to win the title.

At November to Remember in November 1997, Storm and Chris Candido defeated Tommy Rogers and Jerry Lynn. The following month, at Better Than Ever, Storm and Candido won the ECW World Tag Team Championship from the Can-Am Express. Despite being the champions, the duo retained a rivalry and at CyberSlam in February 1998, Storm defeated Candido. At Living Dangerously in March 1998, Storm and Al Snow defeated Shane Douglas and Candido. At Wrestlepalooza in May 1998, Storm and Candido defeated the Hardcore Chair Swingin&#x27; Freaks (Balls Mahoney and Axl Rotten) to retain the ECW World Tag Team Championship. In June 1998, Storm and Candido lost the ECW World Tag Team Championship to Sabu and Rob Van Dam.

On the July 22, 1998 episode of &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot;, Storm walked out on Candido during a title match against Sabu and Van Dam, thus ending their team and beginning a feud between the two men. On the September 5, 1998 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;, Storm introduced his valet Tammy Lynn Bytch, a parody of Candido&#x27;s real life girlfriend Tammy Lynn Sytch, who appeared in ECW to side with Candido and feuded with Bytch. Storm and Candido feuded until late 1998. At November to Remember, Storm defeated Jerry Lynn with Mikey Whipwreck as special guest referee.

==== Impact Players (1999–2000) ====

Following his feud with Candido, Storm joined forces with his trainee Justin Credible in February 1999 at Crossing the Line &#x27;99. The duo formed a tag team named The Impact Players. At Living Dangerously, The Impact Players faced Tommy Dreamer and Shane Douglas in a losing effort. The stable joined Storm and his valet (now renamed Dawn Marie) with Credible and his manager Jason. They first feuded with Jerry Lynn and Sabu in singles matches and by late 1999, they had begun a violent feud with Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman. The team brutalized many singles stars during this period as well. At Hardcore Heaven, Storm defeated Tommy Dreamer. At Heat Wave, The Impact Players faced Rob Van Dam and Jerry Lynn in a losing effort. At Anarchy Rulz, Storm defeated Jerry Lynn. At November to Remember, The Impact Players and Rhino defeated Raven, Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman in the night&#x27;s main event.

At Guilty as Charged, The Impact Players defeated Tommy Dreamer and Raven for their first of two ECW World Tag Team Championship reigns. After losing the titles to Tommy Dreamer and Masato Tanaka they won them back at Living Dangerously where The Impact Players defeated Raven and Mike Awesome and Tommy Dreamer and Masato Tanaka in a Three-Way Dance. However they lost the titles to Tommy Dreamer and Masato Tanaka on February 26, 2000. During this time, Storm also gained a position as a booker in ECW and had a hand in much of the product content on television and pay-per-view. At Hardcore Heaven, Storm challenged his former tag team partner Justin Credible for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship but failed to win the title. After the company began to suffer financial hardships, Storm left ECW for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in order to support his family.
=== World Championship Wrestling (2000–2001) ===

Storm left ECW in May 2000 to join WCW, where he became a singles wrestler. He made his first appearance on the June 19, 2000 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; and quickly became one of WCW&#x27;s most prominent stars, winning the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship, the Cruiserweight Championship, and the WCW Hardcore Championship in rapid succession, resulting in Storm becoming the first and only wrestler in WCW history to hold three titles simultaneously. As an affront to the fans, he renamed the titles to the Canadian Heavyweight Championship, 100 kg and Under Championship, and Saskatchewan Hardcore International Title (S.H.I.T.), respectively, complete with large Canadian flag stickers that covered the belts&#x27; faceplates. Storm then formed the group called Team Canada in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada during New Blood Rising on August 13, where he defended the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship in a match with Mike Awesome. The match was refereed by the Canadian Jacques Rougeau, who enabled Storm to defeat Awesome and retain his title by constantly changing the rules. Following the match, the semi-retired Canadian wrestler Bret Hart came to the ring and hugged Storm and Rougeau. At Fall Brawl on September 17, Storm defeated General Rection with Jim Duggan as the referee, with Duggan turning on M.I.A and joining Team Canada. He also attempted to win the World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated by champion Booker T on each occasion. Storm eventually awarded the Cruiserweight and Hardcore titles by presenting them to his Team Canada stablemates Elix Skipper and Carl Ouellet, respectively. At Halloween Havoc on October 29, Storm and Jim Duggan lost to General Rection in a Handicap match losing the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship and to free Major Gunns from Team Canada. On the November 13 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Storm defeated General Rection to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship back. At Mayhem on November 26, General Rection defeated Storm for the title. At Starrcade on December 17, Storm defeated Ernest Miller.

Storm&#x27;s stable Team Canada feuded with General Rection&#x27;s stable, the Misfits In Action, for several months. At Sin on January 14, 2001, Team Canada (Lance Storm, Mike Awesome and Elix Skipper) (with Major Gunns) defeated The Filthy Animals (Konnan, Rey Mysterio, Jr. and Billy Kidman) (with Tygress) in a Penalty Box match with Jim Duggan as special guest referee, In particular, Storm and Rection feuded with each other over Storm&#x27;s &quot;Canadian&quot; Heavyweight Title, which Rection finally won and promptly returned to the United States Heavyweight Title name. At SuperBrawl Revenge on February 18, Storm faced The Cat where he lost and The Cat became the new Commissioner of WCW. At WCW&#x27;s final PPV Greed on March 18, Team Canada (Lance Storm and Mike Awesome) defeated Konnan and Hugh Morrus. The pay-per-view event took place eight days before the final episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; and three days before the final episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;. On the final episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Team Canada (Lance Storm and Mike Awesome) challenged for the WCW World Tag Team Championship against Sean O&#x27;Haire and Chuck Palumbo but failed to win the titles.

=== World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (2001–2005) ===

==== The Alliance (2001–2002) ====

When WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2001, Storm&#x27;s contract was kept and he became a WWF employee. Storm, portrayed as a serious, humourless heel, was in The Alliance and was the first WCW superstar to ever invade a WWF program, where he debuted on the May 28, 2001 episode of &quot;WWF Raw is War&quot;. At Invasion on July 22, Storm and Mike Awesome faced Edge and Christian in a losing effort. Storm received a modest push during the Invasion angle, as he would go on to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Albert on the July 23 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. He lost the title a month later to Edge at SummerSlam on August 19. Storm formed a tag team with The Hurricane and feuded with the Hardy Boyz over the WWF and WCW Tag Team Titles for the next few months; at Unforgiven on September 23, Storm and The Hurricane competed in a Fatal Four-Way Elimination match for the WWF Tag Team Championship but failed to win, this later included a match for the WCW Tag Team Championship against the Hardy Boyz at No Mercy on October 21, which Storm and The Hurricane lost. Eventually, at Rebellion on November 3, Storm and Justin Credible faced Billy and Chuck in a losing effort. At Survivor Series on November 18, Storm competed in an Immunity Battle Royal that was won by Test, where the winner could not be fired for a year. However, Team Alliance lost in the main event and Storm was fired (in storyline) along with the rest of the Alliance roster by Vince McMahon. Storm eventually got his job back officially on the December 17 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; when he defeated The Rock with help from Test in a match that earned him a WWF contract. On the December 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Storm and Kurt Angle lost to The Rock and Rob Van Dam.

Storm remained a heel and on the January 17, 2002 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Storm and Christian faced Rikishi in a 2 on 1 Over The Top Rope Challenge which Rikishi won. At the Royal Rumble on January 20, Storm competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Al Snow. At No Way Out on February 17, Storm and Christian competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match which was won by The APA.

====The Un-Americans (2002)====

In June, Storm formed The Un-Americans along with Christian, Test, and later William Regal. During this angle, Storm and Christian won the WWE Tag Team Championship on July 21 at Vengeance by defeating Hollywood Hulk Hogan and Edge. On the August 5 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Storm and Christian retained the WWE Tag Team Championship against The Hardy Boyz by disqualification. On the August 12 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Un-Americans and Triple H defeated Booker T, The Undertaker, Goldust and The Rock in an 8-man tag team match. At SummerSlam on August 25, Storm and Christian defeated Booker T and Goldust to retain the titles. On the September 9 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Storm and Christian defeated Kane and Bradshaw when Regal hit Bradshaw with a pair of brass knuckles and joined the group. At Unforgiven on September 22, The Un-Americans (Storm, Christian, Regal, and Test) faced Kane, Goldust, Booker T, and Bubba Ray Dudley in a losing effort. Storm and Christian lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to Kane and The Hurricane on the September 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Eventually, the Un-Americans broke apart on the September 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; after they each lost their respective matches, leading to a brawl involving all the members of the group.

====Various feuds (2002–2005)====
Storm continued teaming with Regal as a regular tag team with the same anti-American gimmick; Storm would represent Canada and Regal represented England. At Armageddon on December 15, Storm and Regal competed in a fatal-four-way tag team elimination match for the World Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles. The next month, the duo won the World Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions. The first was by defeating Booker T and Goldust on the January 6, 2003 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; with help from Chief Morley, who was appointed &quot;Raw Chief of Staff&quot;, but they lost the title at the Royal Rumble on January 19 to The Dudley Boyz. Storm and Regal began their second reign as World Tag Team Champions the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; by defeating the Dudley Boyz with help from Morley again. At No Way Out on February 23, Storm and Regal defeated Kane and Rob Van Dam to retain the titles. On the March 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Morley announced that since the belts had not been defended in 30 days due to Regal&#x27;s legitimate health problems, the duo would be stripped of the title. Morley immediately named himself and Lance Storm the new World Tag Team Champions starting Storm&#x27;s fourth tag team title reign. The following week on the March 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Storm and Morley faced Kane and Rob Van Dam and The Dudley Boyz in a 3-Way Elimination match, dropping the titles to Kane and Van Dam. At Judgment Day on May 18, Storm competed in a Battle Royal for the vacant WWE Intercontinental Championship which was won by Christian.

From there, Storm was briefly involved in a storyline in which Stone Cold Steve Austin, an authority figure, encouraged the fans to chant &quot;boring&quot; during Storm&#x27;s matches including one with Storm losing to newcomer Garrison Cade on the June 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; thanks to Austin bringing out a pillow and blanket and snoring loudly into the microphone, and other distracting antics. Storm eventually found help from Goldust who helped improve Storm&#x27;s charisma, which eventually turned Storm into a face and Storm started dancing. He soon rejoined Morley, who had also become a face and reverted to his Val Venis character. Their reformed team began entering the ring with very attractive women but this time their tag team never got a push. Storm and Goldust then began teaming together for a short period of time. At Armageddon on December 14, Storm and Val Venis competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship which was won by Ric Flair and Batista. From December 2003 to March 2004, Storm mainly competed on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;.

Storm eventually turned heel once again by betraying the fans. This happened when he told them of how he was sick and tired of pleasing them with his dancing and how it was just a waste of his time on an episode of &quot;Raw&quot; following the 2004 WWE draft lottery, only to be squashed by Rhyno immediately thereafter, thus turning Rhyno into a face once again. This would turn out to be Storm&#x27;s last appearance on &quot;Raw&quot;.

In April 2004, Storm chose to retire from in-ring action. His last match was on April 19, 2004, and he faced Steven Richards at the Calgary Saddledome. He then accepted a position backstage with WWE, working as a wrestling trainer in Ohio Valley Wrestling, WWE&#x27;s main developmental territory.

On March 23, 2005, Storm came out of retirement to participate in a six-man tag team match with Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro against fellow ECW alumni Tommy Dreamer and the Dudley Boyz. On April 9, 2005, in Cloverport, Kentucky, Storm teamed with Matt Cappotelli to face Mercury and Nitro.

Storm resigned from WWE in May 2005 and announced that he intended to open his own training school in his hometown of Calgary, the Storm Wrestling Academy, with the first semester beginning in September 2005. He returned to WWE for one night on May 30, 2005, and faced Maven on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;. Storm wrestled one last time on a WWE-promoted show at ECW One Night Stand on June 12, 2005, where he defeated his close friend and former tag team partner Chris Jericho with the help of Justin Credible.

=== Late career (2005–2016) ===

Since leaving WWE, Storm has made several appearances on the independent circuit. At Hardcore Homecoming on November 4, 2005, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Storm interfered in a steel cage match between Justin Credible and Jerry Lynn, helping Credible defeat Lynn. At the December 3, 2005 Ring of Honor show &quot;Steel Cage Warfare&quot; in New York, New York, Storm congratulated World Champion Bryan Danielson following a successful title defense against Rocky Romero. On April 1, 2006, at &quot;Better Than Our Best&quot;, Storm returned to Ring of Honor to face Danielson for the World Championship in Chicago, Illinois. Prior to the event, Storm commended Bryan Danielson and said that he is the one person to make him come out of retirement. Danielson defeated Storm by submission to retain the championship. ROH fans were appreciative of Storm&#x27;s efforts and chanted &quot;You&#x27;ve still got it&quot; as a tribute.

May 26 and 27 saw Storm work for the United Kingdom-based wrestling promotion One Pro Wrestling (1PW). On May 26, he teamed with Andy Boy Simmonz, who substituted for Justin Credible due to Credible missing a flight, in a first round match of the Tag Team Championship tournament. Storm and Simmonz lost to eventual finalists A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels. The next night, Storm lost to Doug Williams in a singles match.

Storm has made rare indy appearances for Northern Ontario-based promotion Blood, Sweat &amp; Ears. On December 3, 2006, in Mississauga, Ontario, he lost to Christian Cage and suffered a throat injury due to a stiff clothesline. On July 21, 2007, he defeated Christopher Daniels before defeating Robert Roode on August 11, 2007.

On July 3, 2009, it was announced that Storm would be coming out of retirement to perform at two Ring of Honor shows on July 24 and 25, &quot;Death Before Dishonor VII: Nights 1 and 2&quot; respectively. On July 24, Storm and fellow Canadian Kevin Steen defeated Chris Hero and Davey Richards and on July 25, Storm was defeated by Hero in a one-on-one grudge match. Following the match, Storm cut an emotional promo, and later announced his belief that this would be his last match, saying &quot;I shared this match with people who share my love and respect for this business, and I am now home being Lance Evers with the family I will share the rest of my life with. I still have my school, and I will always be a part of this business, but I truly believe I am now done as a performer. They say, never say never in this business, and because of that I won’t, but I think I left it all in the ring that night and I believe I wrote the final page in the 19-year long book that was the career of Lance Storm.&quot;

In November 2009, Lance Storm announced he had accepted the position as the head booker of the Prairie Wrestling Alliance, a promotion that operates out of Edmonton. PWA and the Storm Wrestling Academy had also begun working together very closely.

<text>Nicholas More Seymour (born 9 December 1958) is an Australian musician and record producer. He is the founding bass guitarist and a mainstay of the rock group Crowded House, and is the younger brother of Mark Seymour, singer-songwriter-guitarist in the rock band Hunters and Collectors.

== Biography ==
Nicholas Seymour has two older sisters, Hilary and Helen, and an older brother, Mark (born 1956). His mother encouraged all four children to learn musical instruments and sing. When he was a young boy they all toured country Victoria, as the Seymour Family Singers. In 1972 the family moved to Melbourne, where Nick attended Yarra Junction Primary School. He taught himself to play bass guitar. After finishing secondary education he studied Visual Arts at a tertiary institute.

Seymour was a member of various local bands, starting with The Glory Boys in 1979, then The Romantics in the next year, and Scratch Record Scratch. In 1981 he became the bassist in Plays with Marionettes, which had formed in 1980 with Robin Casinader on drums, piano and Hammond organ, Edward Clayton-Jones on guitar and vocals (ex-Fabulous Marquises), and Hugo Race on lead vocals and guitar. The group performed an &quot;aggravating style of jazzy no-wave noise&quot; and broke up in February 1984. Their recordings include one side of a shared single, &quot;Witchen Kopf&quot; (1982), and &quot;Hellbelly&quot; which appeared on a various artists&#x27; compilation, &quot;This is Hot&quot; (1984). Seymour, Casinader, Clayton-Jones and Brian McMahon (keyboards) formed a group called The Horla, but it had disbanded by the end of 1984. Soon after Casinader and Clayton-Jones formed the Wreckery.

Seymour also worked as a set designer of films including, &quot;The Leonski Incident&quot; (1984), and on the TV series, &quot;Carson&#x27;s Law&quot;. At the end of 1984, he auditioned with &quot;a long line of bass players&quot; to become a founding member of The Mullanes alongside Neil Finn on lead vocals and Paul Hester on drums (both ex-Split Enz). Seymour had played to a taped series of tracks previously recorded by Finn and Hester. The group formed early in the next year and included Craig Hooper on lead guitar (ex-The Reels). Hooper left the group and remained behind in Melbourne when the remaining trio travelled to Los Angeles to start recording sessions, where they were renamed, Crowded House.
As a member of Crowded House, Seymour provides bass guitar, backing vocals and song writing, as well as artwork for album covers, costumes and stage sets. With their second album, &quot;Temple of Low Men&quot; (July 1988), he won the ARIA Music Awards of 1989 category for Best Cover Art. He was nominated for the same award for &quot;Crowded House&quot; (June 1986) in 1987, &quot;Woodface&quot; (July 1991) in 1992, and &quot;Together Alone&quot; (October 1993) in 1994. In early 1989, after a tour of Australia and Canada, Finn fired Seymour from Crowded House. According to music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, Seymour&#x27;s departure was due to Finn blaming him for causing the latter&#x27;s writer&#x27;s block. However Finn cited &quot;artistic differences&quot; as the reason. Seymour said that after a month apart, he contacted Finn and they agreed that he would return to the band. He subsequently stayed with the group until their disbandment in 1996.

In 1986 Seymour, Finn and Hester were also members of The Rock Party, a charity project for The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), which included many fellow Australasian musicians including Finn&#x27;s older brother, Tim Finn; GANGgajang members Geoff Stapleton, Robbie James and Mark Callaghan; Models members Jenny Morris and Sean Kelly; Reg Mombassa (Mental As Anything), Eddie Rayner (ex-Split Enz), Mary Azzopardi (Rockmelons), Andrew Barnum (Vitabeats), Lissa Barnum, Michael Barclay, Peter Blakeley, Deborah Conway, Danny De Costa, Greg Herbert (The Promise), Spencer P Jones, John Kennedy, Paul Kelly, Robert Susz (Dynamic Hepnotics) and Rick Swinn (The Venetians). The Rock Party released a 12&quot; three-track single &quot;Everything to Live For&quot;, which was produced by Joe Wissert, Phil Rigger and Phil Beazley. In 1990 Seymour and Hester joined Chris Bailey Combo with Bailey on lead vocals (ex-The Saints), Dror Erez, Tony Norris and Chris Wilson.

After Crowded House separated in November 1996, Seymour joined former bandmate Peter Jones (who had replaced Hester in 1994) in a pop rock band, deadstar. That group had been formed in August 1995, as a side project, by Jones (drums and percussion), Caroline Kennedy (lead vocals and guitar), and former Hunters &amp; Collectors member Barry Palmer (lead guitar and, initially, bass guitar). With Seymour aboard they toured the United Kingdom and recorded their second album, &quot;Milk&quot; (August 1997). At that time, Seymour had worked on his brother Mark&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;King Without a Clue&quot; (October 1997), alongside bandmates Jones and Palmer. Seymour left deadstar at the end of 1997.

Seymour moved to Dublin and produced the debut album, &quot;Neither Am I&quot; (October 2000), for Irish band Bell X1. He also helped establish Irish bands, Juno Falls and Vesta Varro, as well as recording a rock band, The Walls. In 2003, he re-teamed with Hester to form another group, Tarmac Adam.

Following Hester&#x27;s death in 2005, Seymour reconnected with Finn and performed on the latter&#x27;s third studio album. Over time, that project morphed into the fifth Crowded House album. In 2007, Neil Finn, Mark Hart and Nick Seymour reformed Crowded House, adding Matt Sherrod as drummer. The album &quot;Time on Earth&quot; was released in June 2007 and the group started a world tour in support of it.

Crowded House also released Intriguer in 2010. It reached #1 on the Australian charts.

Seymour composed the score for the 2012 documentary The Summit. In 2013 he guested, along with Pete Ruotolo, Steven Mogerly, Conor Murray and Hot House Flower Liam Ó Maonlaí on Rónán Ó Snodaigh&#x27;s album of songs in Irish, Sos. The band was called The Occasionals. He also played bass on the 2013 &quot;Sticky Wickets&quot; album by Irish band The Duckworth Lewis Method.

=== Personal life ===
Nick Seymour was married to Brenda Bentleigh in 1989 but they separated in 1993. In 1997 or 1998 Seymour moved to Dublin, where he had bought a home. He later established a recording studio, Exchequer Studios, with Brian Crosby of Bell X1 and producer Rob Kirwan. Seymour and his current partner have a daughter, Lola. He now lives in Sligo.

<doc id="304939" wikidata="Q491412" url="?curid=304939" title="Philosophical logic">
<text>Understood in a narrow sense, philosophical logic is the area of logic that studies the application of logical methods to philosophical problems, often in the form of extended logical systems like modal logic. Some theorists conceive philosophical logic in a wider sense as the study of the scope and nature of logic in general. In this sense, philosophical logic can be seen as identical to the philosophy of logic, which includes additional topics like how to define logic or a discussion of the fundamental concepts of logic. The current article treats philosophical logic in the narrow sense, in which it forms one field of inquiry within the philosophy of logic.

An important issue for philosophical logic is the question of how to classify the great variety of non-classical logical systems, many of which are of rather recent origin. One form of classification often found in the literature is to distinguish between extended logics and deviant logics. Logic itself can be defined as the study of valid inference. Classical logic is the dominant form of logic and articulates rules of inference in accordance with logical intuitions shared by many, like the law of excluded middle, the double negation elimination, and the bivalence of truth. 

Extended logics are logical systems that are based on classical logic and its rules of inference but extend it to new fields by introducing new logical symbols and the corresponding rules of inference governing these symbols. In the case of alethic modal logic, these new symbols are used to express not just what is &quot;true simpliciter&quot;, but also what is &quot;possibly&quot; or &quot;necessarily true&quot;. It is often combined with possible worlds semantics, which holds that a proposition is possibly true if it is true in some possible world while it is necessarily true if it is true in all possible worlds. Deontic logic pertains to ethics and provides a formal treatment of ethical notions, such as obligation and permission. Temporal logic formalizes temporal relations between propositions. This includes ideas like whether something is true at some time or all the time and whether it is true in the future or in the past. Epistemic logic belongs to epistemology. It can be used to express not just what is the case but also what someone believes or knows to be the case. Its rules of inference articulate what follows from the fact that someone has these kinds of mental states. Higher-order logics do not directly apply classical logic to certain new sub-fields within philosophy but generalize it by allowing quantification not just over individuals but also over predicates.

Deviant logics, in contrast to these forms of extended logics, reject some of the fundamental principles of classical logic and are often seen as its rivals. Intuitionistic logic is based on the idea that truth depends on verification through a proof. This leads it to reject certain rules of inference found in classical logic that are not compatible with this assumption. Free logic modifies classical logic in order to avoid existential presuppositions associated with the use of possibly empty singular terms, like names and definite descriptions. Many-valued logics allow additional truth values besides &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. They thereby reject the principle of bivalence of truth. Paraconsistent logics are logical systems able to deal with contradictions. They do so by avoiding the principle of explosion found in classical logic. Relevance logic is a prominent form of paraconsistent logic. It rejects the purely truth-functional interpretation of the material conditional by introducing the additional requirement of relevance: for the conditional to be true, its antecedent has to be relevant to its consequent.

== Definition and related fields ==
The term &quot;philosophical logic&quot; is used by different theorists in slightly different ways. When understood in a narrow sense, as discussed in this article, philosophical logic is the area of philosophy that studies the application of logical methods to philosophical problems. This usually happens in the form of developing new logical systems to either extend classical logic to new areas or to modify it to include certain logical intuitions not properly addressed by classical logic. In this sense, philosophical logic studies various forms of non-classical logics, like modal logic and deontic logic. This way, various fundamental philosophical concepts, like possibility, necessity, obligation, permission, and time, are treated in a logically precise manner by formally expressing the inferential roles they play in relation to each other. Some theorists understand philosophical logic in a wider sense as the study of the scope and nature of logic in general. On this view, it investigates various philosophical problems raised by logic, including the fundamental concepts of logic. In this wider sense, it can be understood as identical to the philosophy of logic, where these topics are discussed. The current article discusses only the narrow conception of philosophical logic. In this sense, it forms one area of the philosophy of logic.

Central to philosophical logic is an understanding of what logic is and what role philosophical logics play in it. Logic can be defined as the study of valid inferences. An inference is the step of reasoning in which it moves from the premises to a conclusion. Often the term &quot;argument&quot; is also used instead. An inference is valid if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. In this sense, the truth of the premises ensures the truth of the conclusion. This can be expressed in terms of rules of inference: an inference is valid if its structure, i.e. the way its premises and its conclusion are formed, follows a rule of inference. Different systems of logic provide different accounts for when an inference is valid. This means that they use different rules of inference. The traditionally dominant approach to validity is called classical logic. But philosophical logic is concerned with non-classical logic: it studies alternative systems of inference. The motivations for doing so can roughly be divided into two categories. For some, classical logic is too narrow: it leaves out many philosophically interesting issues. This can be solved by extending classical logic with additional symbols to give a logically strict treatment of further areas. Others see some flaw with classical logic itself and try to give a rival account of inference. This usually leads to the development of deviant logics, each of which modifies the fundamental principles behind classical logic in order to rectify their alleged flaws.

== Classification of logics ==
Modern developments in the area of logic have resulted in a great proliferation of logical systems. This stands in stark contrast to the historical dominance of Aristotelian logic, which was treated as the one canon of logic for over two thousand years. Treatises on modern logic often treat these different systems as a list of separate topics without providing a clear classification of them. However, one classification frequently mentioned in the academic literature is due to Susan Haack and distinguishes between classical logic, extended logics, and deviant logics. This classification is based on the idea that classical logic, i.e. propositional logic and first-order logic, formalizes some of the most common logical intuitions. In this sense, it constitutes a basic account of the axioms governing valid inference. Extended logics accept this basic account and extend it to additional areas. This usually happens by adding new vocabulary, for example, to express necessity, obligation, or time. These new symbols are then integrated into the logical mechanism by specifying which new rules of inference apply to them, like that possibility follows from necessity. Deviant logics, on the other hand, reject some of the basic assumptions of classical logic. In this sense, they are not mere extensions of it but are often formulated as rival systems that offer a different account of the laws of logic.

Expressed in a more technical language, the distinction between extended and deviant logics is sometimes drawn in a slightly different manner. On this view, a logic is an extension of classical logic if two conditions are fulfilled: (1) all well-formed formulas of classical logic are also well-formed formulas in it and (2) all valid inferences in classical logic are also valid inferences in it. For a deviant logic, on the other hand, (a) its class of well-formed formulas coincides with that of classical logic, while (b) some valid inferences in classical logic are not valid inferences in it. The term quasi-deviant logic is used if (i) it introduces new vocabulary but all well-formed formulas of classical logic are also well-formed formulas in it and (ii) even when it is restricted to inferences using only the vocabulary of classical logic, some valid inferences in classical logic are not valid inferences in it. The term &quot;deviant logic&quot; is often used in a sense that includes quasi-deviant logics as well.

A philosophical problem raised by this plurality of logics concerns the question of whether there can be more than one true logic. Some theorists favor a local approach in which different types of logic are applied to different areas. Early intuitionists, for example, saw intuitionistic logic as the correct logic for mathematics but allowed classical logic in other fields. But others, like Michael Dummett, prefer a global approach by holding that intuitionistic logic should replace classical logic in every area. Monism is the thesis that there is only one true logic. This can be understood in different ways, for example, that only one of all the suggested logical systems is correct or that the correct logical system is yet to be found as a system underlying and unifying all the different logics. Pluralists, on the other hand, hold that a variety of different logical systems can all be correct at the same time.

A closely related problem concerns the question of whether all of these formal systems actually constitute &quot;logical&quot; systems. This is especially relevant for deviant logics that stray very far from the common logical intuitions associated with classical logic. In this sense, it has been argued, for example, that fuzzy logic is a logic only in name but should be considered a non-logical formal system instead since the idea of degrees of truth is too far removed from the most fundamental logical intuitions. So not everyone agrees that all the formal systems discussed in this article actually constitute &quot;logics&quot;, when understood in a strict sense.

== Classical logic ==
Classical logic is the dominant form of logic used in most fields. The term refers primarily to propositional logic and first-order logic. Classical logic is not an independent topic within philosophical logic. But a good familiarity with it is still required since many of the logical systems of direct concern to philosophical logic can be understood either as extensions of classical logic, which accept its fundamental principles and build on top of it, or as modifications of it, rejecting some of its core assumptions. Classical logic was initially created in order to analyze mathematical arguments and was applied to various other fields only afterward. For this reason, it neglects many topics of philosophical importance not relevant to mathematics, like the difference between necessity and possibility, between obligation and permission, or between past, present, and future. These and similar topics are given a logical treatment in the different philosophical logics extending classical logic. Classical logic by itself is only concerned with a few basic concepts and the role these concepts play in making valid inferences. The concepts pertaining to propositional logic include propositional connectives, like &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, and &quot;if-then&quot;. Characteristic of the classical approach to these connectives is that they follow certain laws, like the law of excluded middle, the double negation elimination, the principle of explosion, and the bivalence of truth. This sets classical logic apart from various deviant logics, which deny one or several of these principles.

In first-order logic, the propositions themselves are made up of subpropositional parts, like predicates, singular terms, and quantifiers. Singular terms refer to objects and predicates express properties of objects and relations between them. Quantifiers constitute a formal treatment of notions like &quot;for some&quot; and &quot;for all&quot;. They can be used to express whether predicates have an extension at all or whether their extension includes the whole domain. Quantification is only allowed over individual terms but not over predicates, in contrast to higher-order logics.

== Extended logics ==
=== Alethic modal ===
Alethic modal logic has been very influential in logic and philosophy. It provides a logical formalism to express what is &quot;possibly&quot; or &quot;necessarily true&quot;. It constitutes an extension of first-order logic, which by itself is only able to express what is &quot;true simpliciter&quot;. This extension happens by introducing two new symbols: for possibility and for necessity. These symbols are used to modify propositions. For example, if stands for the proposition &quot;Socrates is wise&quot;, then expresses the proposition &quot;it is possible that Socrates is wise&quot;. In order to integrate these symbols into the logical formalism, various axioms are added to the existing axioms of first-order logic. They govern the logical behavior of these symbols by determining how the validity of an inference depends on the fact that these symbols are found in it. They usually include the idea that if a proposition is necessary then its negation is impossible, i.e. that is equivalent to . Another such principle is that if something is necessary, then it must also be possible. This means that follows from . There is disagreement about exactly which axioms govern modal logic. The different forms of modal logic are often presented as a nested hierarchy of systems in which the most fundamental systems, like &quot;system K&quot;, include only the most fundamental axioms while other systems, like the popular &quot;system S5&quot;, build on top of it by including additional axioms. In this sense, system K is an extension of first-order logic while system S5 is an extension of system K. Important discussions within philosophical logic concern the question of which system of modal logic is correct. It is usually advantageous to have the strongest system possible in order to be able to draw many different inferences. But this brings with it the problem that some of these additional inferences may contradict basic modal intuitions in specific cases. This usually motivates the choice of a more basic system of axioms.

Possible worlds semantics is a very influential formal semantics in modal logic that brings with it system S5. A formal semantics of a language characterizes the conditions under which the sentences of this language are true or false. Formal semantics play a central role in the model-theoretic conception of validity. They are able to provide clear criteria for when an inference is valid or not: an inference is valid if and only if it is truth-preserving, i.e. if whenever its premises are true then its conclusion is also true. Whether they are true or false is specified by the formal semantics. Possible worlds semantics specifies the truth conditions of sentences expressed in modal logic in terms of possible worlds. A possible world is a complete and consistent way how things could have been. On this view, a sentence modified by the formula_1-operator is true if it is true in at least one possible world while a sentence modified by the formula_2-operator is true if it is true in all possible worlds. So the sentence (it is possible that Socrates is wise) is true since there is at least one world where Socrates is wise. But (it is necessary that Socrates is wise) is false since Socrates is not wise in every possible world. Possible world semantics has been criticized as a formal semantics of modal logic since it seems to be circular. The reason for this is that possible worlds are themselves defined in modal terms, i.e. as ways how things &quot;could&quot; have been. In this way, it itself uses modal expressions to determine the truth of sentences containing modal expressions.

=== Deontic ===
Deontic logic extends classical logic to the field of ethics. Of central importance in ethics are the concepts of obligation and permission, i.e. which actions the agent has to do or is allowed to do. Deontic logic usually expresses these ideas with the operators formula_3 and formula_4. So if stands for the proposition &quot;Ramirez goes jogging&quot;, then means that Ramirez has the obligation to go jogging and means that Ramirez has the permission to go jogging.

Deontic logic is closely related to alethic modal logic in that the axioms governing the logical behavior of their operators are identical. This means that obligation and permission behave in regards to valid inference just like necessity and possibility do. For this reason, sometimes even the same symbols are used as operators. Just as in alethic modal logic, there is a discussion in philosophical logic concerning which is the right system of axioms for expressing the common intuitions governing deontic inferences. But the arguments and counterexamples here are slightly different since the meanings of these operators differ. For example, a common intuition in ethics is that if the agent has the obligation to do something then they automatically also have the permission to do it. This can be expressed formally through the axiom schema . Another question of interest to philosophical logic concerns the relation between alethic modal logic and deontic logic. An often discussed principle in this respect is that ought implies can. This means that the agent can only have the obligation to do something if it is possible for the agent to do it. Expressed formally: .

=== Temporal ===
Temporal logic, or tense logic, uses logical mechanisms to express temporal relations. In its most simple form, it contains one operator to express that something happened at one time and another to express that something is happening all the time. These two operators behave in the same way as the operators for possibility and necessity in alethic modal logic. Since the difference between past and future is of central importance to human affairs, these operators are often modified to take this difference into account. Arthur Prior&#x27;s tense logic, for example, realizes this idea using four such operators: formula_4 (it was the case that...), formula_6 (it will be the case that...), formula_7 (it has always been the case that...), and formula_8 (it will always be the case that...). So to express that it will always be rainy in London one could use . Various axioms are used to govern which inferences are valid depending on the operators appearing in them. According to them, for example, one can deduce (it will be rainy in London at some time) from . In more complicated forms of temporal logic, also binary operators linking two propositions are defined, for example, to express that something happens until something else happens.

Temporal modal logic can be translated into classical first-order logic by treating time in the form of a singular term and increasing the arity of one&#x27;s predicates by one. For example, the tense-logic-sentence (it is dark, it was light, and it will be light again) can be translated into pure first-order logic as . While similar approaches are often seen in physics, logicians usually prefer an autonomous treatment of time in terms of operators. This is also closer to natural languages, which mostly use grammar, e.g. by conjugating verbs, to express the pastness or futurity of events.

=== Epistemic ===
Epistemic logic is a form of modal logic applied to the field of epistemology. It aims to capture the logic of knowledge and belief. The modal operators expressing knowledge and belief are usually expressed through the symbols and . So if stands for the proposition &quot;Socrates is wise&quot;, then expresses the proposition &quot;the agent knows that Socrates is wise&quot; and expresses the proposition &quot;the agent believes that Socrates is wise&quot;. Axioms governing these operators are then formulated to express various epistemic principles. For example, the axiom schema expresses that whenever something is known, then it is true. This reflects the idea that one can only know what is true, otherwise it is not knowledge but another mental state. Another epistemic intuition about knowledge concerns the fact that when the agent knows something, they also know that they know it. This can be expressed by the axiom schema . An additional principle linking knowledge and belief states that knowledge implies belief, i.e. . Dynamic epistemic logic is a distinct form of epistemic logic that focuses on situations in which changes in belief and knowledge happen.

=== Higher-order ===
Higher-order logics extend first-order logic by including new forms of quantification. In first-order logic, quantification is restricted to singular terms. It can be used to talk about whether a predicate has an extension at all or whether its extension includes the whole domain. This way, propositions like (&quot;there are some&quot; apples that are sweet) can be expressed. In higher-order logics, quantification is allowed not just over individual terms but also over predicates. This way, it is possible to express, for example, whether certain individuals share some or all of their predicates, as in (&quot;there are some&quot; qualities that Mary and John share). Because of these changes, higher-order logics have more expressive power than first-order logic. This can be helpful for mathematics in various ways since different mathematical theories have a much simpler expression in higher-order logic than in first-order logic. For example, Peano arithmetic and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory need an infinite number of axioms to be expressed in first-order logic. But they can be expressed in second-order logic with only a few axioms.

But despite this advantage, first-order logic is still much more widely used than higher-order logic. One reason for this is that higher-order logic is incomplete. This means that, for theories formulated in higher-order logic, it is not possible to prove every true sentence pertaining to the theory in question. Another disadvantage is connected to the additional ontological commitments of higher-order logics. It is often held that the usage of the existential quantifier brings with it an ontological commitment to the entities over which this quantifier ranges. In first-order logic, this concerns only individuals, which is usually seen as an unproblematic ontological commitment. In higher-order logic, quantification concerns also properties and relations. This is often interpreted as meaning that higher-order logic brings with it a form of Platonism, i.e. the view that universal properties and relations exist in addition to individuals.

== Deviant logics ==
=== Intuitionistic ===
Intuitionistic logic is a more restricted version of classical logic. It is more restricted in the sense that certain rules of inference used in classical logic do not constitute valid inferences in it. This concerns specifically the law of excluded middle and the double negation elimination. The law of excluded middle states that for every sentence, either it or its negation are true. Expressed formally: formula_9. The law of double negation elimination states that if a sentence is not not true, then it is true, i.e. . Due to these restrictions, many proofs are more complicated and some proofs otherwise accepted become impossible.

These modifications of classical logic are motivated by the idea that truth depends on verification through a proof. This has been interpreted in the sense that &quot;true&quot; means &quot;verifiable&quot;. It was originally only applied to the area of mathematics but has since then been used in other areas as well. On this interpretation, the law of excluded middle would involve the assumption that every mathematical problem has a solution in the form of a proof. In this sense, the intuitionistic rejection of the law of excluded middle is motivated by the rejection of this assumption. This position can also be expressed by stating that there are no unexperienced or verification-transcendent truths. In this sense, intuitionistic logic is motivated by a form of metaphysical idealism. Applied to mathematics, it states that mathematical objects exist only to the extent that they are constructed in the mind.

=== Free ===
Free logic rejects some of the existential presuppositions found in classical logic. In classical logic, every singular term has to denote an object in the domain of quantification. This is usually understood as an ontological commitment to the existence of the named entity. But many names are used in everyday discourse that do not refer to existing entities, like &quot;Santa Claus&quot; or &quot;Pegasus&quot;. This threatens to preclude such areas of discourse from a strict logical treatment. Free logic avoids these problems by allowing formulas with non-denoting singular terms. This applies to proper names as well as definite descriptions, and functional expressions. Quantifiers, on the other hand, are treated in the usual way as ranging over the domain. This allows for expressions like (Santa Claus does not exist) to be true even though they are self-contradictory in classical logic. It also brings with it the consequence that certain valid forms of inference found in classical logic are not valid in free logic. For example, one may infer from (Santa Claus has a beard) that (something has a beard) in classical logic but not in free logic. In free logic, often an existence-predicate is used to indicate whether a singular term denotes an object in the domain or not. But the usage of existence-predicates is controversial. They are often opposed, based on the idea that existence is required if any predicates should apply to the object at all. In this sense, existence cannot itself be a predicate.

Karel Lambert, who coined the term &quot;free logic&quot;, has suggested that free logic can be understood as a generalization of classical predicate logic just as predicate logic is a generalization of Aristotelian logic. On this view, classical predicate logic introduces predicates with an empty extension while free logic introduces singular terms of non-existing things.

An important problem for free logic consists in how to determine the truth value of expressions containing empty singular terms, i.e. of formulating a formal semantics for free logic. Formal semantics of classical logic can define the truth of their expressions in terms of their denotation. But this option cannot be applied to all expressions in free logic since not all of them have a denotation. Three general approaches to this issue are often discussed in the literature: &quot;negative semantics&quot;, &quot;positive semantics&quot;, and &quot;neutral semantics&quot;. &quot;Negative semantics&quot; hold that all atomic formulas containing empty terms are false. On this view, the expression is false. &quot;Positive semantics&quot; allows that at least some expressions with empty terms are true. This usually includes identity statements, like . Some versions introduce a second, outer domain for non-existing objects, which is then used to determine the corresponding truth values. &quot;Neutral semantics&quot;, on the other hand, hold that atomic formulas containing empty terms are neither true nor false. This is often understood as a three-valued logic, i.e. that a third truth value besides true and false is introduced for these cases.

=== Many-valued ===
Many-valued logics are logics that allow for more than two truth values. They reject one of the core assumptions of classical logic: the principle of the bivalence of truth. The most simple versions of many-valued logics are three-valued logics: they contain a third truth value. In Stephen Cole Kleene&#x27;s three-valued logic, for example, this third truth value is &quot;undefined&quot;. According to Nuel Belnap&#x27;s four-valued logic, there are four possible truth values: &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, &quot;neither true nor false&quot;, and &quot;both true and false&quot;. This can be interpreted, for example, as indicating the information one has concerning whether a state obtains: information that it does obtain, information that it does not obtain, no information, and conflicting information. One of the most extreme forms of many-valued logic is fuzzy logic. It allows truth to arise in any degree between 0 and 1. 0 corresponds to completely false, 1 corresponds to completely true, and the values in between correspond to truth in some degree, e.g. as a little true or very true. It is often used to deal with vague expressions in natural language. For example, saying that &quot;Petr is young&quot; fits better (i.e. is &quot;more true&quot;) if &quot;Petr&quot; refers to a three-year-old than if it refers to a 23-year-old. Many-valued logics with a finite number of truth-values can define their logical connectives using truth tables, just like classical logic. The difference is that these truth tables are more complex since more possible inputs and outputs have to be considered. In Kleene&#x27;s three-valued logic, for example, the inputs &quot;true&quot; and &quot;undefined&quot; for the conjunction-operator result in the output &quot;undefined&quot;. The inputs &quot;false&quot; and &quot;undefined&quot;, on the other hand, result in &quot;false&quot;.

=== Paraconsistent ===
Paraconsistent logics are logical systems that can deal with contradictions without leading to all-out absurdity. They achieve this by avoiding the principle of explosion found in classical logic. According to the principle of explosion, anything follows from a contradiction. This is the case because of two rules of inference, which are valid in classical logic: disjunction introduction and disjunctive syllogism. According to the disjunction introduction, any proposition can be introduced in the form of a disjunction when paired with a true proposition. So since it is true that &quot;the sun is bigger than the moon&quot;, it is possible to infer that &quot;the sun is bigger than the moon or Spain is controlled by space-rabbits&quot;. According to the disjunctive syllogism, one can infer that one of these disjuncts is true if the other is false. So if the logical system also contains the negation of this proposition, i.e. that &quot;the sun is not bigger than the moon&quot;, then it is possible to infer any proposition from this system, like the proposition that &quot;Spain is controlled by space-rabbits&quot;. Paraconsistent logics avoid this by using different rules of inference that make inferences in accordance with the principle of explosion invalid.

An important motivation for using paraconsistent logics is dialetheism, i.e. the belief that contradictions are not just introduced into theories due to mistakes but that reality itself is contradictory and contradictions within theories are needed to accurately reflect reality. Without paraconsistent logics, dialetheism would be hopeless since everything would be both true and false. Paraconsistent logics make it possible to keep contradictions local, without &quot;exploding&quot; the whole system. But even with this adjustment, dialetheism is still highly contested. Another motivation for paraconsistent logic is to provide a logic for discussions and group beliefs where the group as a whole may have inconsistent beliefs if its different members are in disagreement.

==== Relevance ====
Relevance logic is one type of paraconsistent logic. As such, it also avoids the principle of explosion even though this is usually not the main motivation behind relevance logic. Instead, it is usually formulated with the goal of avoiding certain unintuitive applications of the material conditional found in classical logic. Classical logic defines the material conditional in purely truth-functional terms, i.e. is false if is true and is false, but otherwise true in every case. According to this formal definition, it does not matter whether and are relevant to each other in any way. For example, the material conditional &quot;if all lemons are red then there is a sandstorm inside the Sydney Opera House&quot; is true even though the two propositions are not relevant to each other. 

The fact that this usage of material conditionals is highly unintuitive is also reflected in informal logic, which categorizes such inferences as fallacies of relevance. Relevance logic tries to avoid these cases by requiring that for a true material conditional, its antecedent has to be relevant to the consequent. A difficulty faced for this issue is that relevance usually belongs to the content of the propositions while logic only deals with formal aspects. This problem is partially addressed by the so-called &quot;variable sharing principle&quot;. It states that antecedent and consequent have to share a propositional variable. This would be the case, for example, in but not in . A closely related concern of relevance logic is that inferences should follow the same requirement of relevance, i.e. that it is a necessary requirement of valid inferences that their premises are relevant to their conclusion.

<doc id="304941" wikidata="Q3742339" url="?curid=304941" title="E. J. Lowe (philosopher)">
<text>Edward Jonathan Lowe (; 24 March 1950 – 5 January 2014), usually cited as E. J. Lowe but known personally as Jonathan Lowe, was a British philosopher and academic. He was Professor of Philosophy at Durham University. He defended non-Cartesian dualism.

==Biography==
Lowe was born in Dover, England. His secondary education was at Bushey Grammar School, and he subsequently studied at the University of Cambridge, 1968–72 (BA in History, 1st Class), and the University of Oxford, 1972–75 (BPhil and DPhil in Philosophy). 

==Overview==
Lowe was one of the leading philosophers of his generation. He researched and published on a vast array of topics including: metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophical logic, philosophy of language, philosophy of religion, and the history of early modern philosophy. He supervised many PhD students, working on a wide variety of topics.

He made notable contributions to developing thought on ontology, essences, dualistic interactionism, and Locke studies. For Lowe, ontology comes in two parts: &quot;a priori&quot; and empirical. The &quot;a priori&quot; aspect deals in the possible ways reality could exists. The empirical aspect informs and establish what kinds of things &quot;do&quot; exists. Thus, to grasp what is actual in the world you must also ascertain was it possible. At the heart of his ontological world is a four-category ontology which consist of objects, kinds, attributes, and modes. Key to his neo-Aristotelianism is a commitment to essences. He espouses general essences and individual essences. The view follows in the Aristotelian tradition that an essence is ‘what it is’ to be a substance. His work on Locke offers a charitable reading of the philosopher, and defends Locke&#x27;s relevance to philosophy today.

== Philosophy ==

=== The Four-Category Ontology ===
Lowe’s four-category ontology takes inspiration from Aristotle’s &quot;Categories.&quot; His terminology emerges from the distinction that Aristotle made between ‘being said of’ and ‘being said in’ a subject: primary substances, secondary substances, attributes, and modes. Primary substances are neither said of nor in a subject. Secondary are said of a subject, but not in. His own addition is to label the final two categories, attributes and modes. Attributes are both said in and of, while modes are not said of a subject, but said in. Attributes and modes are his own additions to Aristotle’s language. Rather than ‘being said of’ or ‘being said in,’ Lowe introduces two distinctions: substantial and non-substantial; universals and particulars. Thus, there are substantial particulars (objects), substantial universals (kinds), non-substantial universals (attributes), and non-substantial particulars (modes). He argues that the distinction between kinds and modes are similar to the kind of distinction made between sortal and adjectival terms. The former denotes &quot;kinds&quot; of object, while the latter denotes &quot;properties&quot; of objects. Individual objects are particular instances of kinds, while the modes of individual objects are particular instances of properties.The categories and their relations are laid out in the &#x27;Ontological Square.&#x27; 

Lowe argues that his view has an advantage over other Universalist ontologies like that of David Armstrong. That is, it does not need to rely on appeals to second-order relations. Consider the law-statement, ‘Planets move in elliptical orbits.’ Lowe claims, according to a theory like Armstrong’s, a second-order necessitation relation obtains between the first-order properties: being a planet and moving in an elliptical orbit. Instead, the four-category ontology would state that the law amounts to the attribute, moving in an elliptical orbit, characterizing the kind, planet

A further advantage is in the accounts ability to distinguish between dispositional and occurrent states of objects. For example, the distinction between an object being soluble and its actually dissolving. Where counterfactuals need a covering claim, “all things being equal,” the four-category ontology can capture the dispositions through kinds and objects.An object possesses a &quot;disposition&quot; to &quot;F&quot; just in case it instantiates a kind which is characterized by the property of being &quot;F&quot;. Thus, for example, an object &quot;O&quot; has a disposition to be dissolved by water just in case &quot;O&quot; instantiates a kind, &quot;K&quot;, such that the law obtains that water dissolves &quot;K.&quot;The modes and attributes capture the object actually dissolving by their relation to the universal of the object. For Lowe, modes are features of an object, not constituent of it. Here, modes are particular ways an object is. Thus, an object may exemplify attributes dispositionally or occurrently. It exemplifies attributes dispositionally if the object instantiates the kind which is characterized by the attribute. It exemplifies attribute occurrently if the object is characterized by a mode which instantiates the attribute.

=== Essences ===
A central aspect of Lowe’s metaphysics is his view of essences. Put simply, essences are ‘what it is’ to be that object. Each object has two kinds of essences: general essences and individual essences. General essences are ‘what it is’ to be that object, and is shared by all the particulars of that object. Individual essences capture ‘what it is’ to be a particular object as opposed to some other. For Lowe, essences are not some particular thing you need to find. For example, H2O as the essence of water. Rather, you simply need to ‘grasp’ what it is to be that substance. The bar he uses for grasping an essence is obtaining an “adequate conception” of it.

===Non-Cartesian dualism===

Lowe defended non-Cartesian dualism. Non-Cartesian substance dualism (NCSD) is a type of dualism of persons and their organized bodies, wherein persons though distinct from their organized bodies are bearers of both mental properties and certain physical properties.

Lowe defined non-cartesian dualism as:

==Death==

Lowe died after several months of illness on 5th January 2014.

<text>Heart rate is the frequency of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions of the heart per minute (&quot;beats per minute&quot;, or bpm). The heart rate varies according to the body&#x27;s physical needs, including the need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide. It is also modulated by numerous factors, including (but not limited to) genetics, physical fitness, stress or psychological status, diet, drugs, hormonal status, environment, and disease/illness, as well as the interaction between these factors. It is usually equal or close to the pulse rate measured at any peripheral point.

The American Heart Association states the normal resting adult human heart rate is 60–100 bpm. An ultra-trained athlete would have a resting heart rate of 37–38 bpm. &quot;Tachycardia&quot; is a high heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest. &quot;Bradycardia&quot; is a low heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest. When a human sleeps, a heartbeat with rates around 40–50 bpm is common and considered normal. When the heart is not beating in a regular pattern, this is referred to as an &quot;arrhythmia&quot;. Abnormalities of heart rate sometimes indicate disease.

==Physiology==

While &quot;heart rhythm&quot; is regulated entirely by the sinoatrial node under normal conditions, &quot;heart rate&quot; is regulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the sinoatrial node. The accelerans nerve provides sympathetic input to the heart by releasing norepinephrine onto the cells of the sinoatrial node (SA node), and the vagus nerve provides parasympathetic input to the heart by releasing acetylcholine onto sinoatrial node cells. Therefore, stimulation of the accelerans nerve increases heart rate, while stimulation of the vagus nerve decreases it.

As water and blood are incompressible fluids, one of the physiological ways to deliver more blood to an organ is to increase heart rate. Normal resting heart rates range from 60 to 100 bpm. Bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm. However, heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention. Tachycardia is defined as a resting heart rate above 100 bpm, though persistent rest rates between 80 and 100 bpm, mainly if they are present during sleep, may be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia (see below).
* Central nervous system stimulants such as substituted amphetamines increase heart rate.
* Central nervous system depressants or sedatives decrease the heart rate (apart from some particularly strange ones with equally strange effects, such as ketamine which can cause – amongst many other things – stimulant-like effects such as tachycardia).
There are many ways in which the heart rate speeds up or slows down. Most involve stimulant-like endorphins and hormones being released in the brain, some of which are those that are &#x27;forced&#x27;/&#x27;enticed&#x27; out by the ingestion and processing of drugs such as cocaine or atropine.

This section discusses target heart rates for healthy persons, which would be inappropriately high for most persons with coronary artery disease.

===Influences from the central nervous system===

====Cardiovascular centres====
The heart rate is rhythmically generated by the sinoatrial node. It is also influenced by central factors through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Nervous influence over the heart rate is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centres of the medulla oblongata. The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve. During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to autonomic tone. This is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles. Normally, vagal stimulation predominates as, left unregulated, the SA node would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm.

Both sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli flow through the paired cardiac plexus near the base of the heart. The cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers, forming the cardiac nerves via sympathetic ganglia (the cervical ganglia plus superior thoracic ganglia T1–T4) to both the SA and AV nodes, plus additional fibers to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heartrate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions.

Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor. High blood pressure medications are used to block these receptors and so reduce the heart rate.

Parasympathetic stimulation originates from the cardioinhibitory region of the brain with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches to both the SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and ventricles. Parasympathetic stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. ACh slows HR by opening chemical- or ligand-gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization, which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs. Without any nervous stimulation, the SA node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm. Since resting rates are considerably less than this, it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows HR. This is similar to an individual driving a car with one foot on the brake pedal. To speed up, one need merely remove one&#x27;s foot from the brake and let the engine increase speed. In the case of the heart, decreasing parasympathetic stimulation decreases the release of ACh, which allows HR to increase up to approximately 100 bpm. Any increases beyond this rate would require sympathetic stimulation.
====Input to the cardiovascular centres====
The cardiovascular centre receive input from a series of visceral receptors with impulses traveling through visceral sensory fibers within the vagus and sympathetic nerves via the cardiac plexus. Among these receptors are various proprioreceptors, baroreceptors, and chemoreceptors, plus stimuli from the limbic system which normally enable the precise regulation of heart function, via cardiac reflexes. Increased physical activity results in increased rates of firing by various proprioreceptors located in muscles, joint capsules, and tendons. The cardiovascular centres monitor these increased rates of firing, suppressing parasympathetic stimulation or increasing sympathetic stimulation as needed in order to increase blood flow.

Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. The cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.

There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase HR. The opposite is also true.

Increased metabolic byproducts associated with increased activity, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, and lactic acid, plus falling oxygen levels, are detected by a suite of chemoreceptors innervated by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. These chemoreceptors provide feedback to the cardiovascular centers about the need for increased or decreased blood flow, based on the relative levels of these substances.

The limbic system can also significantly impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, it is not unusual to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol. Individuals experiencing extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those of heart attacks. These events are typically transient and treatable. Meditation techniques have been developed to ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR effectively. Doing simple deep and slow breathing exercises with one&#x27;s eyes closed can also significantly reduce this anxiety and HR.

===Factors influencing heart rate===
Using a combination of autorhythmicity and innervation, the cardiovascular center is able to provide relatively precise control over the heart rate, but other factors can impact on this. These include hormones, notably epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones; levels of various ions including calcium, potassium, and sodium; body temperature; hypoxia; and pH balance.

====Epinephrine and norepinephrine====
The catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, secreted by the adrenal medulla form one component of the extended fight-or-flight mechanism. The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and norepinephrine have similar effects: binding to the beta-1 adrenergic receptors, and opening sodium and calcium ion chemical- or ligand-gated channels. The rate of depolarization is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period of repolarization is shortened. However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla.

====Thyroid hormones====
In general, increased levels of the thyroid hormones (thyroxine(T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)), increase the heart rate; excessive levels can trigger tachycardia. The impact of thyroid hormones is typically of a much longer duration than that of the catecholamines. The physiologically active form of triiodothyronine, has been shown to directly enter cardiomyocytes and alter activity at the level of the genome. It also impacts the beta-adrenergic response similar to epinephrine and norepinephrine.

====Calcium====
Calcium ion levels have a great impact on heart rate and myocardial contractility: increased calcium levels cause an increase in both. High levels of calcium ions result in hypercalcemia and excessive levels can induce cardiac arrest. Drugs known as calcium channel blockers slow HR by binding to these channels and blocking or slowing the inward movement of calcium ions.

====Caffeine and nicotine====

Caffeine and nicotine are both stimulants of the nervous system and of the cardiac centres causing an increased heart rate. Caffeine works by increasing the rates of depolarization at the SA node, whereas nicotine stimulates the activity of the sympathetic neurons that deliver impulses to the heart.

==== Effects of stress ====
Both surprise and stress induce physiological response: elevate heart rate substantially. In a study conducted on 8 female and male student actors ages 18 to 25, their reaction to an unforeseen occurrence (the cause of stress) during a performance was observed in terms of heart rate. In the data collected, there was a noticeable trend between the location of actors (onstage and offstage) and their elevation in heart rate in response to stress; the actors present offstage reacted to the stressor immediately, demonstrated by their immediate elevation in heart rate the minute the unexpected event occurred, but the actors present onstage at the time of the stressor reacted in the following 5 minute period (demonstrated by their increasingly elevated heart rate). This trend regarding stress and heart rate is supported by previous studies; negative emotion/stimulus has a prolonged effect on heart rate in individuals who are directly impacted.
In regard to the characters present onstage, a reduced startle response has been associated with a passive defense, and the diminished initial heart rate response has been predicted to have a greater tendency to dissociation. Current evidence suggests that heart rate variability can be used as an accurate measure of psychological stress and may be used for an objective measurement of psychological stress.

====Factors decreasing heart rate====
The heart rate can be slowed by altered sodium and potassium levels, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, and hypothermia. The relationship between electrolytes and HR is complex, but maintaining electrolyte balance is critical to the normal wave of depolarization. Of the two ions, potassium has the greater clinical significance. Initially, both hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and hypernatremia (high sodium levels) may lead to tachycardia. Severely high hypernatremia may lead to fibrillation, which may cause cardiac output to cease. Severe hyponatremia leads to both bradycardia and other arrhythmias. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) also leads to arrhythmias, whereas hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) causes the heart to become weak and flaccid, and ultimately to fail.

Heart muscle relies exclusively on aerobic metabolism for energy. Severe myocardial infarction (commonly called a heart attack) can lead to a decreasing heart rate, since metabolic reactions fueling heart contraction are restricted.

Acidosis is a condition in which excess hydrogen ions are present, and the patient&#x27;s blood expresses a low pH value. Alkalosis is a condition in which there are too few hydrogen ions, and the patient&#x27;s blood has an elevated pH. Normal blood pH falls in the range of 7.35–7.45, so a number lower than this range represents acidosis and a higher number represents alkalosis. Enzymes, being the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions – are sensitive to pH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range. These variations in pH and accompanying slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, subsequently decreasing the rate of many enzymatic reactions, which can have complex effects on HR. Severe changes in pH will lead to denaturation of the enzyme.

The last variable is body temperature. Elevated body temperature is called hyperthermia, and suppressed body temperature is called hypothermia. Slight hyperthermia results in increasing HR and strength of contraction. Hypothermia slows the rate and strength of heart contractions. This distinct slowing of the heart is one component of the larger diving reflex that diverts blood to essential organs while submerged. If sufficiently chilled, the heart will stop beating, a technique that may be employed during open heart surgery. In this case, the patient&#x27;s blood is normally diverted to an artificial heart-lung machine to maintain the body&#x27;s blood supply and gas exchange until the surgery is complete, and sinus rhythm can be restored. Excessive hyperthermia and hypothermia will both result in death, as enzymes drive the body systems to cease normal function, beginning with the central nervous system.

==== Physiological control over heart rate ====

A study shows that bottlenose dolphins can learn – apparently via instrumental conditioning – to rapidly and selectively slow down their heart rate during diving for conserving oxygen depending on external signals. In humans regulating heart rate by methods such as listening to music, meditation or a vagal maneuver takes longer and only lowers the rate to a much smaller extent.

==In different circumstances==

Heart rate is not a stable value and it increases or decreases in response to the body&#x27;s need in a way to maintain an equilibrium (basal metabolic rate) between requirement and delivery of oxygen and nutrients. The normal SA node firing rate is affected by autonomic nervous system activity: sympathetic stimulation increases and parasympathetic stimulation decreases the firing rate.

===Resting heart rate===
Normal pulse rates at rest, in beats per minute (BPM):


The basal or resting heart rate (HRrest) is defined as the heart rate when a person is awake, in a neutrally temperate environment, and has not been subject to any recent exertion or stimulation, such as stress or surprise. The normal resting heart rate is based on the at-rest firing rate of the heart&#x27;s sinoatrial node, where the faster pacemaker cells driving the self-generated rhythmic firing and responsible for the heart&#x27;s autorhythmicity are located.

In one study 98% of cardiologists suggested that as a desirable target range, 50 to 90 beats per minute is more appropriate than 60 to 100. The available evidence indicates that the normal range for resting heart rate is 50–90 beats per minute (bpm). In a study of over 35,000 American men and women over age 40 during the 1999–2008 period, 71 bpm was the average for men, and 73 bpm was the average for women.

Resting heart rate is often correlated with mortality. In the Copenhagen City Heart Study a heart rate of 65 bpm rather than 80 bpm was associated with 4.6 years longer life expectancy in men and 3.6 years in women. Other studies have shown all-cause mortality is increased by 1.22 (hazard ratio) when heart rate exceeds 90 beats per minute. ECG of 46,129 individuals with low risk for cardiovascular disease revealed that 96% had resting heart rates ranging from 48 to 98 beats per minute. The mortality rate of patients with myocardial infarction increased from 15% to 41% if their admission heart rate was greater than 90 beats per minute. For endurance athletes at the elite level, it is not unusual to have a resting heart rate between 33 and 50 bpm.

=== Maximum heart rate ===

The &quot;maximum heart rate&quot; (HRmax) is the age-related highest number of beats per minute of the heart when reaching a point of exhaustion without severe problems through exercise stress. 
In general it is loosely estimated as 220 minus one&#x27;s age. 
It generally decreases with age. Since HRmax varies by individual, the most accurate way of measuring any single person&#x27;s HRmax is via a cardiac stress test. In this test, a person is subjected to controlled physiologic stress (generally by treadmill or bicycle ergometer) while being monitored by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The intensity of exercise is periodically increased until certain changes in heart function are detected on the ECG monitor, at which point the subject is directed to stop. Typical duration of the test ranges ten to twenty minutes. Adults who are beginning a new exercise regimen are often advised to perform this test only in the presence of medical staff due to risks associated with high heart rates. 

The theoretical maximum heart rate of a human is 300 bpm; however, there have been multiple cases where this theoretical upper limit has been exceeded. The fastest human ventricular conduction rate recorded to this day is a conducted tachyarrhythmia with ventricular rate of 600 beats per minute, which is comparable to the heart rate of a mouse.

For general purposes, a number of formulas are used to estimate HRmax. However, these predictive formulas have been criticized as inaccurate because they only produce generalized population-averages and may deviate significantly from the actual value. (&quot;See § Limitations&quot;.)

==== Haskell &amp; Fox (1970)====

Notwithstanding later research, the most widely cited formula for HRmax is still:

:HRmax = 220 − age

Although attributed to various sources, it is widely thought to have been devised in 1970 by Dr. William Haskell and Dr. Samuel Fox. They did not develop this formula from original research, but rather by plotting data from approximately 11 references consisting of published research or unpublished scientific compilations. It gained widespread use through being used by Polar Electro in its heart rate monitors, which Dr. Haskell has &quot;laughed about&quot;, as the formula &quot;was never supposed to be an absolute guide to rule people&#x27;s training.&quot;

While this formula is commonly used (and easy to remember and calculate), research has consistently found that it is subject to bias, particularly in older adults. Compared to the age-specific average HRmax, the Haskell and Fox formula overestimates HRmax in young adults, agrees with it at age 40, and underestimates HRmax in older adults. For example, in one study, the average HRmax at age 76 was about 10bpm higher than the Haskell and Fox equation. Consequently, the formula cannot be recommended for use in exercise physiology and related fields.

==== Other formulas ====

HRmax is strongly correlated to age, and most formulas are solely based on this. Studies have been mixed on the effect of gender, with some finding that gender is statistically significant, although small when considering overall equation error, while others finding negligible effect. The inclusion of physical activity status, maximal oxygen uptake, smoking, body mass index, body weight, or resting heart rate did not significantly improve accuracy. Nonlinear models are slightly more accurate predictors of average age-specific HRmax, particularly above 60 years of age, but are harder to apply, and provide statistically negligible improvement over linear models. The Wingate formula is the most recent, had the largest data set, and performed best on a fresh data set when compared with other formulas, although it had only a small amount of data for ages 60 and older so those estimates should be viewed with caution. In addition, most formulas are developed for adults and are not applicable to children and adolescents.

==== Limitations ====

Maximum heart rates vary significantly between individuals. Age explains only about half of HRmax variance. For a given age, the standard deviation of HRmax from the age-specific population mean is about 12bpm, and a 95% interval for the prediction error is about 24bpm. For example, Dr. Fritz Hagerman observed that the maximum heart rates of men in their 20s on Olympic rowing teams vary from 160 to 220. Such a variation would equate to an age range of -16 to 68 using the Wingate formula. The formulas are quite accurate at predicting the average heart rate of a group of similarly-aged individuals, but relatively poor for a given individual.

Robergs and Landwehr opine that for VO2 max, prediction errors in HRmax need to be less than ±3 bpm. No current formula meets this accuracy. For prescribing exercise training heart rate ranges, the errors in the more accurate formulas may be acceptable, but again it is likely that, for a significant fraction of the population, current equations used to estimate HRmax are not accurate enough. Froelicher and Myers describe maximum heart formulas as &quot;largely useless&quot;. Measurement via a maximal test is preferable whenever possible, which can be as accurate as ±2bpm.

=== Heart rate reserve ===
&quot;Heart rate reserve&quot; (HRreserve) is the difference between a person&#x27;s measured or predicted maximum heart rate and resting heart rate. Some methods of measurement of exercise intensity measure percentage of heart rate reserve. Additionally, as a person increases their cardiovascular fitness, their HRrest will drop, and the heart rate reserve will increase. Percentage of HRreserve is statistically indistinguishable from percentage of VO2 reserve.

:HRreserve = HRmax − HRrest

This is often used to gauge exercise intensity (first used in 1957 by Karvonen).

Karvonen&#x27;s study findings have been questioned, due to the following:
* The study did not use VO2 data to develop the equation.
* Only six subjects were used.
* Karvonen incorrectly reported that the percentages of HRreserve and VO2 max correspond to each other, but newer evidence shows that it correlated much better with VO2 reserve as described above.

===Target heart rate===
For healthy people, the &quot;Target Heart Rate&quot; (THR) or &quot;Training Heart Rate Range&quot; (THRR) is a desired range of heart rate reached during aerobic exercise which enables one&#x27;s heart and lungs to receive the most benefit from a workout. This theoretical range varies based mostly on age; however, a person&#x27;s physical condition, sex, and previous training also are used in the calculation. 

==== By percent, Fox–Haskell-based ====
The THR can be calculated as a range of 65–85% intensity, with intensity defined simply as percentage of HRmax. However, it is crucial to derive an accurate HRmax to ensure these calculations are meaningful.

&quot;Example for someone with a HRmax of 180 (age 40, estimating HRmax As 220 − age): &quot;

: 65% Intensity: (220 − (age = 40)) × 0.65 → 117 bpm
: 85% Intensity: (220 − (age = 40)) × 0.85 → 154 bpm

==== Karvonen method ====

The &quot;Karvonen method&quot; factors in resting heart rate (HRrest) to calculate target heart rate (THR), using a range of 50–85% intensity:

: THR = ((HRmax − HRrest) × % intensity) + HRrest
Equivalently,
: THR = (HRreserve × % intensity) + HRrest

&quot;Example for someone with a HRmax of 180 and a HRrest of 70 (and therefore a HRreserve of 110):&quot;

: 50% Intensity: ((180 − 70) × 0.50) + 70 = 125 bpm
: 85% Intensity: ((180 − 70) × 0.85) + 70 = 163 bpm

==== Zoladz method ====

An alternative to the Karvonen method is the &quot;Zoladz method&quot;, which is used to test an athlete&#x27;s capabilities at specific heart rates. These are not intended to be used as exercise zones, although they are often used as such. The Zoladz test zones are derived by subtracting values from HRmax:

: THR = HRmax − Adjuster ± 5 bpm
:: Zone 1 Adjuster = 50 bpm
:: Zone 2 Adjuster = 40 bpm
:: Zone 3 Adjuster = 30 bpm
:: Zone 4 Adjuster = 20 bpm
:: Zone 5 Adjuster = 10 bpm

&quot;Example for someone with a HRmax of 180:&quot;

: Zone 1 (easy exercise): 180 − 50 ± 5 → 125 − 135 bpm
: Zone 4 (tough exercise): 180 − 20 ± 5 → 155 − 165 bpm

=== Heart rate recovery ===
Heart rate recovery (HRR) is the reduction in heart rate at peak exercise and the rate as measured after a cool-down period of fixed duration. A greater reduction in heart rate after exercise during the reference period is associated with a higher level of cardiac fitness.

Heart rates assessed during treadmill stress test that do not drop by more than 12 bpm one minute after stopping exercise (if cool-down period after exercise) or by more than 18 bpm one minute after stopping exercise (if no cool-down period and supine position as soon as possible) are associated with an increased risk of death. People with an abnormal HRR defined as a decrease of 42 beats per minutes or less at two minutes post-exercise had a mortality rate 2.5 times greater than patients with a normal recovery. Another study reported a four-fold increase in mortality in subjects with an abnormal HRR defined as ≤12 bpm reduction one minute after the cessation of exercise. A study reported that a HRR of ≤22 bpm after two minutes &quot;best identified high-risk patients&quot;. They also found that while HRR had significant prognostic value it had no diagnostic value.

===Development===

The human heart beats more than 2.8 billion times in an average lifetime.
The heartbeat of a human embryo begins at approximately 21 days after conception, or five weeks after the last normal menstrual period (LMP), which is the date normally used to date pregnancy in the medical community. The electrical depolarizations that trigger cardiac myocytes to contract arise spontaneously within the myocyte itself. The heartbeat is initiated in the pacemaker regions and spreads to the rest of the heart through a conduction pathway. Pacemaker cells develop in the primitive atrium and the sinus venosus to form the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node respectively. Conductive cells develop the bundle of His and carry the depolarization into the lower heart.

The human heart begins beating at a rate near the mother&#x27;s, about 75–80 beats per minute (bpm). The embryonic heart rate then accelerates linearly for the first month of beating, peaking at 165–185 bpm during the early 7th week, (early 9th week after the LMP). This acceleration is approximately 3.3 bpm per day, or about 10 bpm every three days, an increase of 100 bpm in the first month.

After peaking at about 9.2 weeks after the LMP, it decelerates to about 150 bpm (+/-25 bpm) during the 15th week after the LMP. After the 15th week the deceleration slows reaching an average rate of about 145 (+/-25 bpm) bpm at term. The regression formula which describes this acceleration before the embryo reaches 25 mm in crown-rump length or 9.2 LMP weeks is:

==Clinical significance==

=== Manual measurement ===
Heart rate is measured by finding the pulse of the heart. This pulse rate can be found at any point on the body where the artery&#x27;s pulsation is transmitted to the surface by pressuring it with the index and middle fingers; often it is compressed against an underlying structure like bone. The thumb should not be used for measuring another person&#x27;s heart rate, as its strong pulse may interfere with the correct perception of the target pulse.

The radial artery is the easiest to use to check the heart rate. However, in emergency situations the most reliable arteries to measure heart rate are carotid arteries. This is important mainly in patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom heart beats are irregular and stroke volume is largely different from one beat to another. In those beats following a shorter diastolic interval left ventricle does not fill properly, stroke volume is lower and pulse wave is not strong enough to be detected by palpation on a distal artery like the radial artery. It can be detected, however, by doppler.

Possible points for measuring the heart rate are:
# The ventral aspect of the wrist on the side of the thumb (radial artery).
# The ulnar artery.
# The inside of the elbow, or under the biceps muscle (brachial artery).
# The groin (femoral artery).
# Behind the medial malleolus on the feet (posterior tibial artery).
# Middle of dorsum of the foot (dorsalis pedis).
# Behind the knee (popliteal artery).
# Over the abdomen (abdominal aorta).
# The chest (apex of the heart), which can be felt with one&#x27;s hand or fingers. It is also possible to auscultate the heart using a stethoscope.
# In the neck, lateral of the larynx (carotid artery)

=== Electronic measurement ===

A more precise method of determining heart rate involves the use of an electrocardiograph, or ECG (also abbreviated EKG). An ECG generates a pattern based on electrical activity of the heart, which closely follows heart function. Continuous ECG monitoring is routinely done in many clinical settings, especially in critical care medicine. On the ECG, instantaneous heart rate is calculated using the R wave-to-R wave (RR) interval and multiplying/dividing in order to derive heart rate in heartbeats/min. Multiple methods exist:
* HR = 1000 · 60/(RR interval in milliseconds)
* HR = 60/(RR interval in seconds)
* HR = 300/number of &quot;large&quot; squares between successive R waves.
* HR= 1,500 number of large blocks
Heart rate monitors allow measurements to be taken continuously and can be used during exercise when manual measurement would be difficult or impossible (such as when the hands are being used). Various commercial heart rate monitors are also available. Some monitors, used during sport, consist of a chest strap with electrodes. The signal is transmitted to a wrist receiver for display.

Alternative methods of measurement include .

=== Optical measurements ===

Pulse oximetry of the finger and laser Doppler imaging of the eye fundus are often used in the clinics. Those techniques can assess the heart rate by measuring the delay between pulses.

===Tachycardia===

Tachycardia is a resting heart rate more than 100 beats per minute. This number can vary as smaller people and children have faster heart rates than average adults.

Physiological conditions where tachycardia occurs:
# Pregnancy
# Emotional conditions such as anxiety or stress.
# Exercise

Pathological conditions where tachycardia occurs:
# Sepsis
# Fever
# Anemia
# Hypoxia
# Hyperthyroidism
# Hypersecretion of catecholamines
# Cardiomyopathy
# Valvular heart diseases
# Acute Radiation Syndrome
# Dehydration
# Metabolic myopathies (At rest, tachycardia is commonly seen in fatty acid oxidation disorders. An inappropriate rapid heart rate response to exercise is seen in muscle glycogenoses and mitochondrial myopathies, where the tachycardia is faster than would be expected during exercise).

===Bradycardia===

Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute when textbooks asserted that the normal range for heart rates was 60–100 bpm. The normal range has since been revised in textbooks to 50–90 bpm for a human at total rest. Setting a lower threshold for bradycardia prevents misclassification of fit individuals as having a pathologic heart rate. The normal heart rate number can vary as children and adolescents tend to have faster heart rates than average adults. Bradycardia may be associated with medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, heart disease, or inflammatory disease. At rest, although tachycardia is more commonly seen in fatty acid oxidation disorders, more rarely acute bradycardia can occur.

Trained athletes tend to have slow resting heart rates, and resting bradycardia in athletes should not be considered abnormal if the individual has no symptoms associated with it. For example, Miguel Indurain, a Spanish cyclist and five time Tour de France winner, had a resting heart rate of 28 beats per minute, one of the lowest ever recorded in a healthy human. Daniel Green achieved the world record for the slowest heartbeat in a healthy human with a heart rate of just 26 bpm in 2014.

===Arrhythmia===

Arrhythmias are abnormalities of the heart rate and rhythm (sometimes felt as palpitations). They can be divided into two broad categories: fast and slow heart rates. Some cause few or minimal symptoms. Others produce more serious symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness and fainting.

=== Hypertension ===
Elevated heart rate is a powerful predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension. Atherosclerosis and dysautonomia are major contributors to the pathogenesis.

===Correlation with cardiovascular mortality risk===

A number of investigations indicate that faster resting heart rate has emerged as a new risk factor for mortality in homeothermic mammals, particularly cardiovascular mortality in human beings. High heart rate is associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased atheromatous plaque formation leading to atherosclerosis. Faster heart rate may accompany increased production of inflammation molecules and increased production of reactive oxygen species in cardiovascular system, in addition to increased mechanical stress to the heart. There is a correlation between increased resting rate and cardiovascular risk. This is not seen to be &quot;using an allotment of heart beats&quot; but rather an increased risk to the system from the increased rate.

An Australian-led international study of patients with cardiovascular disease has shown that heart beat rate is a key indicator for the risk of heart attack. The study, published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; (September 2008) studied 11,000 people, across 33 countries, who were being treated for heart problems. Those patients whose heart rate was above 70 beats per minute had significantly higher incidence of heart attacks, hospital admissions and the need for surgery. Higher heart rate is thought to be correlated with an increase in heart attack and about a 46 percent increase in hospitalizations for non-fatal or fatal heart attack.

Other studies have shown that a high resting heart rate is associated with an increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic diseases. A faster resting heart rate is associated with shorter life expectancy and is considered a strong risk factor for heart disease and heart failure, independent of level of physical fitness. Specifically, a resting heart rate above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting heart rate has been shown to be associated with a 10–20% increase in risk of death. In one study, men with no evidence of heart disease and a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Similarly, another study found that men with resting heart rates of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality; in women it was associated with a three-fold increase. In patients having heart rates of 70 beats/minute or above, each additional beat/minute was associated with increased rate of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization.

Given these data, heart rate should be considered in the assessment of cardiovascular risk, even in apparently healthy individuals. Heart rate has many advantages as a clinical parameter: It is inexpensive and quick to measure and is easily understandable. Although the accepted limits of heart rate are between 60 and 100 beats per minute, this was based for convenience on the scale of the squares on electrocardiogram paper; a better definition of normal sinus heart rate may be between 50 and 90 beats per minute.

Standard textbooks of physiology and medicine mention that heart rate (HR) is readily calculated from the ECG as follows: HR = 1000*60/RR interval in milliseconds, HR = 60/RR interval in seconds, or HR = 300/number of large squares between successive R waves. In each case, the authors are actually referring to instantaneous HR, which is the number of times the heart would beat if successive RR intervals were constant.

Lifestyle and pharmacological regimens may be beneficial to those with high resting heart rates. Exercise is one possible measure to take when an individual&#x27;s heart rate is higher than 80 beats per minute. Diet has also been found to be beneficial in lowering resting heart rate: In studies of resting heart rate and risk of death and cardiac complications on patients with type 2 diabetes, legumes were found to lower resting heart rate. This is thought to occur because in addition to the direct beneficial effects of legumes, they also displace animal proteins in the diet, which are higher in saturated fat and cholesterol. Another nutrient is omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 fatty acid or LC-PUFA). In a meta-analysis with a total of 51 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3,000 participants, the supplement mildly but significantly reduced heart rate (-2.23 bpm; 95% CI: -3.07, -1.40 bpm). When docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were compared, modest heart rate reduction was observed in trials that supplemented with DHA (-2.47 bpm; 95% CI: -3.47, -1.46 bpm), but not in those received EPA.

A very slow heart rate (bradycardia) may be associated with heart block. It may also arise from autonomous nervous system impairment.

<text>A hammam (), also often called a Turkish bath by Westerners, is a type of steam bath or a place of public bathing associated with the Islamic world. It is a prominent feature in the culture of the Muslim world and was inherited from the model of the Roman &quot;thermae.&quot; Muslim bathhouses or hammams were historically found across the Middle East, North Africa, al-Andalus (Islamic Iberia, i.e. Spain and Portugal), Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and in Southeastern Europe under Ottoman rule.

In Islamic cultures the significance of the hammam was both religious and civic: it provided for the needs of ritual ablutions but also provided for general hygiene in an era before private plumbing and served other social functions such as offering a gendered meeting place for men and for women. Archeological remains attest to the existence of bathhouses in the Islamic world as early as the Umayyad period (7th–8th centuries) and their importance has persisted up to modern times. Their architecture evolved from the layout of Roman and Greek bathhouses and featured a regular sequence of rooms: an undressing room, a cold room, a warm room, and a hot room. Heat was produced by furnaces which provided hot water and steam, while smoke and hot air was channeled through conduits under the floor.

In a modern hammam visitors undress themselves, while retaining some sort of modesty garment or loincloth, and proceed into progressively hotter rooms, inducing perspiration. They are then usually washed by male or female staff (matching the gender of the visitor) with the use of soap and vigorous rubbing, before ending by washing themselves in warm water. Unlike in Roman or Greek baths, bathers usually wash themselves with running water instead of immersing themselves in standing water since this is a requirement of Islam, though immersion in a pool used to be customary in the hammams of some regions such as Iran. While hammams everywhere generally operate in fairly similar ways, there are some regional differences both in usage and architecture.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;hammam&quot; () is a noun meaning &quot;bath&quot;, &quot;bathroom&quot;, &quot;bathhouse&quot;, &quot;swimming pool&quot;, etc. derived from the Arabic triconsonantal root H-M-M (ح م م) which yields meanings related to heat or heating. From Arabic , it passed on to Persian () and Turkish (). 

In English, the inaccurate term &quot;Turkish bath&quot; is also used to refer to hammams. This stems from the tendency of historical Western writers to conflate ethnic and religious terms by referring to Muslims as &quot;Turk&quot; and because they presented hammams largely as an Ottoman cultural feature. The first recorded use of the term &#x27;Turkish bath&#x27; in English was in 1644.

== History ==
=== Origins and early development ===

Public bathhouses were a prominent civic and urban institution in Roman and Hellenistic culture and were found throughout the Mediterranean world. They remained important in the cities of the early Byzantine Empire up to around the mid-6th century, after which the construction of new bathhouses declined and existing ones were gradually abandoned.
Following the expansion of Arab Muslim rule over much of the Middle East and North Africa in the 7th and 8th centuries, the emerging Islamic societies were quick to adapt the bathhouse to their own needs. Its importance to Muslim society lay in the religious requirement to perform ablutions (&quot;wudu&quot; and &quot;ghusl&quot;) before praying and because of the general Islamic emphasis on physical and spiritual purity, although the scholar Mohammed Hocine Benkheira has argued that hammams were not in fact necessary for religious purposes in early Islam and that this relationship was partly assumed by later historians. He suggests that the hammam&#x27;s initial appeal derived at least in part from its convenience for other services (such as shaving), from its endorsement by some Muslim doctors as a form of therapy, and from the continued popular appreciation of its pleasures in a region where they had already existed for centuries. He also notes that there was initially strong opposition from many Islamic scholars (&quot;ulama&quot;), especially Maliki scholars, to the use of hammams. These scholars viewed hammams as unnecessary for full-body ablutions (&quot;ghusl&quot;) and questioned whether public bathing spaces could be sufficiently clean to achieve proper purification. They also worried that spaces for collective bathing could become spaces for illicit sexual activity. Nevertheless, this opposition progressively faded and by the 9th century most scholars were no longer interested in debating the validity of hammams, although it continued to be seen with suspicion in some conservative circles.

The earliest known Islamic hammams were built in Syria and Jordan during the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750) as part of palaces and desert castles at Qusayr &#x27;Amra, Hammam al-Sarah, Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi, and Khirbat al-Majfar. Shortly after this period, archaeology reveals the existence of Islamic bathhouses across much of the Muslim world, with hammams appearing as far west as Volubilis (itself a former Roman colony) in Morocco during the Idrisid period (late 8th to early 9th centuries). Historical texts and archeological evidence also indicate the existence of hammams in Cordoba and other cities of al-Andalus in the 8th century. In Iran, which did not previously have a strong culture of public bathing, historical texts mention the existence of bathhouses in the 10th century as well as the use of hot springs for therapeutic purposes; however, there has been relatively little archeological investigation to document the early presence and development of hammams in this region.

Muslims retained many of the main elements of the classical bathhouses while leaving out functions which were less relevant to their practices. For example, the progression from cold room to hot room was maintained, but it was no longer common practice to take a plunge in cold water after leaving the hot room, nor was exercise incorporated into bathing culture as it was in classical gymnasiums. Likewise, Muslim bathers usually washed themselves in running water rather than immersing themselves in standing water. Although in early Islamic history women did not normally patronise hammams, by around the 10th century many places started to provide separate hours (or separate facilities) for men and women. The hammam then took on an important role in women&#x27;s social life as one of the few public spaces where they could gather and socialise apart from men. Some hammams were privately owned or formed parts of palaces and mansions, but in many cases they were civic or charitable institutions which formed part of larger religious/civic complexes. Such complexes were governed by &quot;waqf&quot; agreements, and hammams often acted as a source of revenue for the upkeep of other institutions such as mosques.

=== Later Islamic baths ===
In the 11th century the Seljuk Empire conquered much of Anatolia from the Byzantine Empire, eventually leading to the complete conquest of the remnants of the old empire in the 15th century. During those centuries of war, peace, alliance, trade and competition, these intermixing cultures (Eastern Roman, Islamic Persian and Turkic) had tremendous influence on each other.

Later the Ottomans became prolific patrons of hammams. Since they were social centres as well as baths, they were built in almost every city across their European, Asian, and African territories. The Ottomans were thus responsible for introducing hammams to much of eastern and central Europe, where many still exist today in various states of restoration or disrepair. Such Turkish baths are found as far as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, and Hungary. Many early Ottoman hammams survive in Bursa and Edirne, as well as in Eastern Europe and Anatolia, but hammams became even more numerous and architecturally ambitious in Constantinople (Istanbul), thanks to its royal patronage, its large population and its access to plentiful water. The city&#x27;s Greek inhabitants had retained a strong Eastern Roman bath culture, with the Baths of Zeuxippus constituting one early example. Ottoman architects expanded on the experience of Byzantine architects to create particularly well-balanced designs with greater symmetry and regularity in the arrangement of space than could be seen in hammams in other parts of the Muslim world. Some of the city&#x27;s oldest monumental hammams are the Tahtakale Hamam (probably built right after 1454), the Mahmut Pasha Hamam (built in 1466), and the Bayezid II Hamam (built some time between 1500 and 1507). The monumental hammams designed by the 16th-century Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan (1489–1588), such as the Çemberlitaş Hamamı, the Süleymaniye Hamam (in the complex of the Süleymaniye Mosque), and the Haseki Hürrem Sultan Hamam, are major examples of hammams that were built later in the era of classical Ottoman architecture. When Sultan Mustafa III issued a decree halting the construction of new public baths in the city in 1768, it seems to have resulted in an increase in the number of private hammams among the wealthy and the elites, especially in the Bosphorus suburbs where they built luxurious summer homes.

In Iran, many examples of hammams survive from the Safavid period (16th–18th centuries) onward, with the historic city of Isfahan in particular containing many examples. The spread of Muslim rule in the Indian subcontinent also introduced hammams to this region, with many examples surviving in Mughal architecture (16th–19th centuries).

=== Contemporary era ===
Hammams continued to be a vital part of urban life in the Muslim world until the early 20th century when the spread of indoor plumbing in private homes rendered public baths unnecessary for personal hygiene. This has resulted in a decline in their use – although to varying degrees depending on regional cultural practices. In many regions hammams have been abandoned, demolished or converted to serve as commercial buildings or cultural venues. Some have been converted into museums or art galleries, as with the examples of the Bayezid II Hamam in Istanbul, which now houses a hammam museum, and the Davud Pasha (or Daut Pasha) Hamam in Skopje, North Macedonia.

In Turkey many historic hammams continue to operate either for locals or for tourists; in some cases this has led to neglected historic hammams such as the Kılıç Ali Pasa Hamamı and the Hürrem Sultan Hamamı being renovated and returned to their original function, while others were abandoned or repurposed. In Morocco, many hammams continue to serve locals in historic cities such as Fes and Marrakesh, where they are especially useful to the urban poor residing in the old cities (&quot;medina&quot;s). In many other regions, however, hammams have become obsolete and have either been abandoned or converted to other uses. In Iran, some baths continue to operate in the historic districts of cities like Isfahan where they continue to serve religious functions, but there is an overall decline in their numbers. Many surviving Iranian examples have been converted to other uses, most notably as restaurants and teahouses. In Damascus, Syria, only thirteen hammams were still operating in 2004, mostly in the old city; many others had been either demolished or repurposed. Cairo in Egypt contained an estimated 77 operational hammams at the beginning of the 19th century but only eight were still in business by the start of the 21st century, with many others abandoned or neglected. In the former European territories of the Ottoman Empire such as Greece and the Balkans, many hammams became defunct or were neglected in modern times, although some have now been restored and turned into historic monuments or cultural centres.

==Public bathing in the Islamic context==

Prayer is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and it is customary to perform ablutions before praying. The two Islamic forms of ablution are &quot;ghusl&quot;, a full-body cleansing, and &quot;wudu&quot;, a cleansing of the face, hands, and feet. Mosques always provide a place to wash, but hammams are often located nearby for deeper cleansing. Many are actually part of mosque complexes.

Hammams, particularly in Morocco, evolved from their Roman origins to meet the needs of ritual purification according to Islam. For example, in most Roman-style hammams, there was a cold pool for submersion of the body, a style of bathing that finds less favour with Islam which regards bathing under running water without being fully submerged more appropriate.

Al-Ghazali, a prominent Muslim theologian of the 11th century, wrote &quot;Revival of the Religious Sciences&quot;, a multi-volume work discussing the appropriate forms of conduct for many aspects of Muslim life and death. One of the volumes, entitled &quot;The Mysteries of Purity&quot;, details the proper technique for performing ablutions before prayer and the major ablution (&quot;ghusil&quot;) after anything which renders it necessary, such as the emission of semen. For al-Ghazali, the hammam is a primarily male institution, and he cautions that women should only enter a hammam after childbirth or illness. However, even al-Ghazali thought it admissible for men to prohibit their wives or sisters from using the hammam. For al-Ghazali the main point of contention surrounding hammams was nakedness, and he warned that overt nakedness was to be avoided (&quot;… he should shield it from the sight of others and second, guard against the touch of others.&quot;) His writing focused especially on the need to avoid touching the penis during bathing and after urination, and wrote that nakedness was decent only when the area between a man&#x27;s knees and lower stomach was hidden. For women he suggested that only exposure of the face and palms was appropriate. According to al-Ghazali, nakedness in the hammam could incite indecent thoughts and behaviours, hence its controversial nature.

In Islam ritual ablution is also required before or after sexual intercourse. Knowing that, May Telmissany, a professor at the University of Ottawa, argues that the image of a hyper-sexualised woman leaving the hammam is an Orientalist way of looking at things that sees leaving or attending the hammam as an indicator of sexual behaviour.

== Bathing practices and services ==
Most hammams expect their clients to undress down to a modesty garment or loincloth, before proceeding from a cold room to progressively hotter rooms. Men are usually washed by male bath attendants and women by female attendants before they are given a massage. Some details of the process vary from region to region, such as the presence or absence of pools where visitors can immerse themselves in water. In more conservative areas women are less likely to bathe in just their underwear while in areas where hammams have become the preserve mainly of tourists there is more likelihood that women will bathe naked. Some hammam complexes contain separate sections for men and women; elsewhere men and women are admitted at different times in which case the hours for women are usually far more limited than those for men.

Traditionally hammams, especially those for women, doubled as places of entertainment with dancing and food being shared. It was common to visit hammams before weddings or religious holidays, to celebrate births, to swap beauty tips, etc. Women also used visits to the hammam to size up potential wives for their sons.

Some accessories from Roman times survive in modern hammams, such as the &quot;peştemal&quot; (a special cloth of silk and/or cotton to cover the body, like a pareo) and the &quot;kese&quot; (a rough mitten used for scrubbing). However, other accoutrements of the hammam experience such as jewel boxes, gilded soap boxes, mirrors, metal henna bowls, perfume bottles and &quot;nalın&quot; (wooden or mother-of-pearl clogs that prevented slipping on the wet floor) can now only be seen in museums.

Traditionally, the bathhouse masseurs (Turkish: &quot;tellak&quot;) were young men who soaped and scrubbed their clients. However, the &quot;tellaks&quot; were replaced by adult attendants during the 20th century.

=== Massage ===
A massage in a hammam is likely to involve not just vigorous muscle kneading, but also joint cracking - &quot;not so much a tender working of the flesh as a pummelling, a cracking of joints, a twisting of limbs&quot;. Hammams aiming for a tourist clientele are likely to also offer an array of different types of massage similar to what might be offered in a spa.

== Social function: gendered social space ==
Arab hammams are gendered spaces where being a woman or a man can make someone included or excluded. Therefore, they represent a departure from the public sphere in which one is physically exposed amongst other women or men. This declaration of sexuality merely by being nude makes hammams a site of gendered expression. One exception to this gender segregation is the presence of young boys who often accompany their mothers until they reach the age of five or six when they switch to attending the male hammam with their fathers.

Women&#x27;s hammams play a special role in society. Valerie Staats finds that the women&#x27;s hammams of Morocco serve as a social space where traditional and modern women from urban and rural areas of the country come together, regardless of their religiosity, to bathe and socialise. The bathing regulations laid down by al-Ghazali and other Islamic intellectuals are not usually upheld in the everyday interactions of Moroccans in the hammam. Staats argues that hammams are places where women can feel more at ease than in many other public interactions. In addition, in his work &quot;Sexuality in Islam,&quot; Abdelwahab Bouhdiba cites the hammam as a place where homosexual encounters in general can take place. He notes that some historians found evidence of hammams as spaces for sexual expression among women, which they believed was a result of the universality of nudity in these spaces. Hammams have also been associated with male homosexuality over the centuries and up to the present day.

==Architecture==

=== General design ===
The hammam combines the functionality and structural elements of the Roman thermae with the Islamic tradition of steam bathing, ritual cleansing and respect for water. Islamic bathhouses were often constructed as a part of mosque complexes which acted as both community centres and places of worship.

Although there were variations across different regions and periods, the general plan and architectural principles of hammams were very similar. They consisted of a sequence of rooms which bathers visited in the same order: the changing room or undressing room (corresponding to the Roman apodyterium), the cold room (like the Roman frigidarium), the warm room (like the tepidarium), and the hot room (like the caldarium). The nomenclature for these different rooms varied from region to region. The changing room was known generally as &quot;al-mashlaḥ&quot; or &quot;al-maslakh&quot; in Arabic, or by local vernacular terms like &quot;goulsa&quot; in Fez (Morocco) and &quot;maḥras&quot; in Tunisia, whereas it was known as the &quot;camekân&quot; in Turkish and the &quot;sarbineh&quot; in Persian. The cold room was known as the &quot;bayt al-barid&quot; in al-Andalus, &quot;el-barrani&quot; in Fez, &quot;bayt awwal&quot; in Cairo, and &quot;soğukluk&quot; in Turkish. The warm room or intermediate room was known as &quot;bayt al-wastani&quot; in al-Andalus and many other regions, as &quot;el-wasti&quot; in Fez, as &quot;bīt əs-skhūn&quot; in Tunis, and as &quot;ılıklık&quot; in Turkish. The hot room was called the &quot;bayt al-sakhun&quot; in al-Andalus, &quot;ad-dakhli&quot; in Fez, &quot;harara&quot; in Cairo, &quot;garmkhaneh&quot; in Persian, and &quot;hararet&quot; or &quot;sıcaklık&quot; in Turkish.

The main chambers of the hammam were usually covered with vaulted or domed ceilings, giving them a distinctive profile. The domes and vaults of the steam rooms (especially the hot room) were usually pierced with small holes or skylights which provided natural light during the day while allowing excess steam to escape. The ceiling and walls were clad with steam-proof materials such as varnished plaster or (for the lower walls and floors) marble. The vestibule, or changing room, was often one of the most highly decorated chambers, featuring a central fountain surrounded by benches. In Ottoman baths, the main changing room often offered multi-level wooden galleries giving access to smaller changing rooms. Toilets or latrines were often included in the complex.

Most historic hammams made use of some version or derivation of the Roman hypocaust underfloor system for heating. A furnace or set of furnaces were located in a service room behind the walls of the hot room and set at a lower level than the steam rooms. The furnaces were used to heat water (usually in a large cauldron above them) which was then delivered to the steam rooms. At the same time, hot air and smoke from the furnaces was channeled through pipes or conduits under the floor of the steam rooms, thus heating the rooms, before rising through the walls and out the chimneys. As hot water was constantly needed, they were kept burning throughout the hours of operation. Although wood was continuously needed for fuel, some hammams, such as those in Morocco, Turkey and Damascus, also made use of recycled organic materials from other industries such as wood shavings from carpenters&#x27; workshops and olive pits from the olive presses.

Some hammams were &quot;double&quot; hammams, having separate facilities for women and men. Several of Istanbul&#x27;s larger hammams were like this, including the Bayezid II Hamam and the Haseki Hürrem Sultan Hamam. Unusually for Morocco, the Hammam as-Saffarin in Fes is another example.

=== Variations ===

==== Maghreb and al-Andalus ====
Regional variations in hammam architecture usually relate to the relative proportions of each room or the absence of one type of room. In the Maghreb, and especially in al-Andalus, the largest and most important steam room was typically the warm room (&quot;al-wastani&quot;). The Arab Baths of Jaén is one of the more extreme examples of this since the warm room is as large as both the cold and hot rooms combined, possibly because it was also used for body massages and other services. The changing room was also fairly large and was typically the only space to feature any significant architectural decoration.
==== Ottoman baths ====
In Ottoman baths the cold room is often either omitted completely or combined with the changing room (known as the &quot;camekân&quot; or &quot;soyunmalık&quot;). This room is often the largest domed chamber in the complex, with the dome supported on squinches, &quot;Turkish triangles&quot;, or decorative &quot;muqarnas&quot;. It usually features a central fountain (&quot;şadırvan&quot;) and is ringed with wooden galleries and is used as a place to relax, drink tea, coffee, or sherbet, and socialise before and after bathing. In contrast with hammams in al-Andalus or the Maghreb, the warm room (&quot;ılıklık&quot;) was de-emphasised architecturally and was sometimes little more than a transition space between the cold and hot rooms.

The hot room (&quot;hararet&quot; or &quot;sıcaklık&quot;) was usually the focus of the richest architectural embellishments. Its layout typically consisted of a central domed space flanked by up to four iwans to form a cruciform layout. The corners between these iwans are often occupied by smaller domed chambers, or &quot;halvet&quot;s, which were used for private bathing. The center was usually occupied by a large heated marble table (&quot;göbektaşı&quot; or navel stone) for customers to lie on.
==== Iran ====
In Iran a shared pool or basin of hot water is commonly present in the middle of the hot room where bathers could immerse themselves, a feature which was rare or absent in the hamams of other regions (except Egypt). Iranian hammam architecture was also characterised by the polyhedral shape of its rooms (sometimes rectangular but often octagonal or hexagonal), which were covered by a dome with a central skylight. The Iranian hot room (&quot;garmkhaneh&quot;) was in some cases divided into several rooms: a large main one with a central pool (&quot;chal howz&quot;) and smaller ones for individual ablutions or which could be used as private rooms for special guests.
==Regional examples==

=== Jordan ===

Jordan contains several hammams from the Umayyad era (7th to 8th centuries), making them the oldest known examples of Islamic bathhouses. Many of these are attached to the so-called &quot;desert castles&quot;, including Qusayr &#x27;Amra, Hammam al-Sarah, and Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi. Qusayr &#x27;Amra is particularly notable for the frescoes in late Roman style that decorate the chambers, presenting a highly important example of Islamic art in its early historical stages.

=== Al-Andalus (Spain and Portugal) ===

Although the traditions of the hammams eventually disappeared in the centuries after the end of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula in 1492, many historic hammam structures have nonetheless been preserved to varying degrees across many cities, especially in Spain. Many of them are now archeological sites or open to tourists as historical attractions. These hammams are partly distinguished from others by their larger and more monumental warm rooms (&quot;bayt al-wastani&quot;) and changing rooms (&quot;bayt al-maslaj&quot;), a feature also shared with some Moroccan hammams.

An early example (partially destroyed now) were the 10th-century Caliphal Baths which were attached to the Umayyad royal palace of Cordoba (later turned into the Christian Alcazar) and later expanded by the Almohads (12th to early 13th centuries). Other notable examples of preserved Andalusian baths include the Bañuelo of Granada, the Arab Baths of Ronda, the Arab Baths of Jaén, and the baths in the Alcazar of Jerez de la Frontera. The Alhambra of Granada also contains two preserved bathhouses: a small one near its main mosque, and a much more lavish one attached to the Comares Palace. In 2020 a well-preserved 12th-century Almohad-period bathhouse, complete with painted geometric decoration, was discovered during renovations of a local tapas bar in Seville, near the Giralda tower.

===Morocco===

The ruins of the oldest known Islamic hammam in Morocco, dating back to the late 8th century, can be found in Volubilis. Many historic hammams have been preserved in cities such as Marrakesh and especially Fes, partly because they continue to be used by locals. Among the best known examples is the 14th-century Saffarin Hammam in Fes, which has been restored and rehabilitated. Moroccan hammams were typically smaller than Roman or Byzantine baths. They are often close to mosques to facilitate the performance of ablutions. Because of their private nature, their entrances are often discreet and their façades are typically windowless. Vestiges of the Roman bathing style can be seen in the three-room layout, which was widespread during the Roman/Byzantine period.

It&#x27;s sometimes difficult to identify hammams from the outside but the roof has a series of characteristic domes that indicate the different chambers. They often occupy irregularly shaped plots to fit into the dense urban fabric. They are significant sites of culture and socialisation as they are integrated into city life in proximity to mosques, madrasas (schools) and souqs (markets). Magda Sibley, an expert on Islamic public baths, wrote that many specialists in Islamic architecture and urbanism found the hammams to be second in importance only to the mosques as the most significant buildings in Islamic medinas (historic cities).

===Algeria===

The architecture of historic hammams in Algeria can be divided roughly two types: those with linear floor plans, influenced by Andalusi architecture (mostly up to the 15th century), and those with a centralized floor plan, influenced by Ottoman architecture (mostly from the 16th century onward). The oldest known Islamic baths in Algeria are those uncovered by archeologists, including one in Tahert from the Rustamid period (8th–9th centuries), one near the mosque of Agadir (part of present-day Tlemcen), and one at the 10th-century Zirid palace of &#x27;Ashir. A more significant example has also been found in the Qasr al-Bahr palace at Qal&#x27;at Bani Hammad, the Hammadid capital, likely dating from the 11th to mid-12th century. 

Several medieval hammams also survive in and around Tlemcen today, including the Hammam al-Sabbaghin (late 11th or 12th century), the Hammam al-Bali in nearby Nedroma (12th century), and the Hammam Sidi Bu Madyan which, along with the baths of the ruined Dar al-Sultan nearby, belonged to the 14th century complex of Sidi Bu Madyan. The first two examples have a floor plan arranged around two orthogonal axes and a large central warm room occupying the center, while those of the Sidi Bu Madyan complex are of the linear type planned around one main axis. 

In Algiers, a large number of hammams were built during the Ottoman regency period (16th to early 19th centuries). A study by Nabila Chérif, published in 2009, identified nine hammam buildings that are still preserved or partly preserved in the city. The best-preserved ones are Hammam Sidi Ramdan (pre-Ottoman, possibly from the 10th or 11th centuries), Hammam Basha Sidna (circa 1550), Hammam Sirkadji (mid-17th century), Hammam al-Fitwa (mid-17th century), and Hammam Sidi &#x27;Abd Allah (late 18th century). Apart from the older Hammam Sidi Ramdan, most of these are organized into two main sections: the cold section, which included the changing room and provided a place to rest after bathing, and the warm section, which included the heated warm and hot rooms. The hot room is generally much larger than the warm room and is centrally-planned, consisting of a square room covered by a dome, with a platform for massages in the center and various private alcoves around the edges. 

===Syria===
A legend claims that Damascus once had 365 hammams, one for each day of the year. For centuries, these hammams formed an integral part of community life and some 50 of those in Damascus survived until the 1950s. However, by 2012, as a result of modernisation and the installation of home bathrooms, fewer than twenty Damascene hammams were still working.

According to many historians, Aleppo was home to 177 medieval hammams before the Mongol invasion when many of the city&#x27;s vital structures were destroyed. Until 1970, around forty hammams were still operating. In 2010, before the start of the Syrian War, roughly eighteen hammams still operated in the ancient part of the city. Notable examples included:
*Hammam al-Sultan, built in 1211 by Az-Zahir Ghazi
*Hammam al-Nahhasin, built during the 12th century near Khan al-Nahhaseen
*Hammam al-Bayadah, built in 1450 during the Mamluk era
*Hammam Yalbugha built in 1491 by the Emir of Aleppo Saif ad-Din Yalbugha al-Naseri
*Hammam al-Jawhary, Gammam Azdemir, Hammam Bahram Pasha, Hammam Bab al-Ahmar and others
===Egypt===

As in neighbouring regions, bathhouses had existed in Egypt for centuries before the arrival of the Arab Muslims in Egypt in the 7th century. Greek bathhouses were present in Alexandria, a capital of Hellenistic culture, as well as in other cities like Karanis in the Faiyum. During the subsequent Islamic period, bathhouses continued to be built by Muslim rulers and patrons, sometimes as part of larger religious and civic complexes. Although not many have survived intact to the present day, numerous public baths were built by the Fatimids (10th–12th centuries), the Ayyubids (12th–13th centuries), the Mamluks (13th–16th centuries), and the Ottomans (16th–19th centuries). One well-preserved medieval example is the restored Hammam of Sultan Inal, dating from 1456 and located at Bayn al-Qasrayn in Cairo. Private hammams were also built as part of palaces, with surviving examples at the Palace of Amir Taz (14th century) and the Harim Palace (19th century), and of local aristocratic mansions such as Bayt al-Razzaz (15th–18th centuries) and Bayt al-Suhaymi (17th–18th centuries). In many Egyptian hammams a pool of hot water is present in the hot room and used for immersion and bathing, a feature shared with the hammams of Iran.

Today, the cultural practice of visiting hammams has significantly receded in Egypt. Cairo contained an estimated 77 operational hammams at the beginning of the 19th century, but only 33 were operating in 1969 and only eight were still operating at the start of the 21st century, with many others abandoned or neglected. Of the few still functioning hammams, many are also in precarious condition and scholars have indicated that they are likely to disappear or stop functioning in the near future. A few hammams, mainly in the neighbourhoods of Historic Cairo, have been restored or earmarked for restoration as historic monuments, including the Sultan Inal Hammam, the monumental but ruined hammam of Sultan al-Mu&#x27;ayyad (behind the al-Mu&#x27;ayyad Mosque), the Hammam al-Gamaliyya (in the Gamaliya neighbourhood), the Hammam al-Sinaniya (in Bulaq), and the Hammam al-Sukariya (in Darb al-Ahmar).

===Turkey===

Public baths were a feature of life in Turkey in Ancient Greek and Roman times, and the Seljuk Turks continued to build hammams here. The majority of historic hammams, however, survive from the Ottoman period (14th–20th centuries). Many examples of early Ottoman hammams remain, particularly in the early Ottoman capitals of Edirne and Bursa, where many of their early structural and decorative features were established. Many were built in association with particular mosques or religious complexes (&quot;külliye&quot;s). Notable examples from the pre-1453 period include the Orhan Bey Hamam in Bursa (built around 1339), the Demirtaş Hamam in Bursa (14th century), the Hacı Hamza Hamam in Iznik (late 14th or early 15th century), the Çelebi Sultan Mehmet Hamam in Merzifon (1413), the Mahkeme Hamam in Bursa (1421), the Gazi Mihal Hamam in Edirne (1422, now partly ruined), the Emir Sultan Hamam in Bursa (1426), the Beylerbeyi Hamam in Edirne (1429, now partly ruined), and the Karacabey Hamam in Ankara (1444).

After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Istanbul became a centre of Ottoman architectural patronage. The city&#x27;s oldest hammams include the Tahtakale Hamam (built soon after 1453), the Mahmut Pasha Hamam (built in 1466 and part of the Mahmut Pasha Mosque complex), the Gedik Ahmet Pasha Hamam (built in 1475), the Bayezid II Hamam (built some time between 1500 and 1507), and the Küçük Mustafa Pasha Hamam (built before 1512 near the Gül Mosque).

Several major hammams in the city were designed by the famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan in the 16th century. These include the Çinili Hamam (built in 1545 in the Zeyrek neighbourhood), the Süleymaniye Hammam (part of the Süleymaniye Mosque complex built in 1550–1557), the Mihrimah Sultan Hamam (part of the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque complex built in 1562–1565), the Kılıç Ali Pasha Hamam (part of the Kılıç Ali Pasha Complex completed in 1580), as well as a lesser-known but architecturally interesting hammam in Ortaköy. The Çemberlitaş Hamam (on Divanyolu Street in the Çemberlitaş neighbourhood), completed in 1584 or earlier, is also attributed to Mimar Sinan. The largest hammam designed by Sinan is the Haseki Hürrem Sultan Hamam which was commissioned by Süleyman I&#x27;s consort, Hürrem Sultan, and completed in 1556 on the site of the historical Baths of Zeuxippus for the religious community of the nearby Hagia Sophia. Outside Istanbul, Sinan also designed the Sokullu Mehmet Pasha Hamam in Edirne around 1568–1569. Among the hammams built after the 16th century one of the most famous is the Cağaloğlu Hamam, finished in 1741 and one of the last major hammams to be built in Istanbul.

Turkey also has a number of hot springs which have been developed as public baths for centuries. The Eski Kaplıca (&quot;Old Thermal Baths&quot;) of Bursa, built by Sultan Murad I (ruled 1360–1389), and the nearby Yeni (&quot;New&quot;) Kaplıca built by Rüstem Pasha in 1552, are two of the most notable examples and are still used today. Several older hot-spring baths were also built by the Seljuks in the 13th century and the Akkoyunlu in the late 14th century, some of which are still operating today.

Although far fewer in number than in the past, many Turkish hammams still operate today. With the growth in tourism, some have been restored or modernised recently with differing degrees of historical authenticity. Other hammam buildings have ceased functioning as public baths but have been repurposed as markets or cultural venues, as for example the Tahtakale Hamam in Istanbul which contains shops and cafes, the Hoca Paşa Hamam in Istanbul which is used for performances by whirling dervishes, the Küçük Mustafa Paşa Hamamı in Istanbul which is used for art exhibitions, and the Orhan Bey Hamam in Bursa which is part of the Covered Bazaar. In some cases hamam buildings have been turned into storage depots or factories, though this has usually led to neglect and damage to their historic fabric.

=== Azerbaijan ===
Hammams have traditionally been important in the lives of Azerbaijanis, and more than seven have been named in Azerbaijan&#x27;s List of historical reserves. For centuries, local benefactors would build hammams to serve the needs of the people in their vicinity, often naming them after themselves, a practice still evident as late as the nineteenth century. At the other extreme lies the 15th century hammam within the Palace of the Shirvanshahs built solely for the use of the shah and his family. Discovered during archaeological excavations in 1939, the hammam had twenty-six rooms. The ruins lie within Icherisheher, the Old City of Baku, historical core of the capital, and a UNESCO World Heritage Centre. 

Within the Old City, the building of baths continued over the years. The Yeraltı Hammam is said to have been built in the 17th century and, like others, is located underground, helping to maintain steady temperatures inside. The 18th century Agha Mikayil Bath near the fortress gates, is the oldest hammam still open in Baku and is one of the few with women&#x27;s days. Its four central pillars allow large square bathrooms with pointed arches, covered with a variety of cupolas and domes. Another 19th century bath, the Agha Zeynal Hammam, is atypical in that it is housed in a residential building, although the interior maintains the more traditional layout. In the centre of Baku, the Tazabay Hammam was built in 1886 in Islamic style, though with separate rooms. It was fully &#x27;restored&#x27; in 2003 and currently has many additional modern facilities, such as manicure and three saunas, which help to make it popular with tourists while still attracting local residents. 

Two other important 19th century hammams are to be found in northwestern Azerbaijan in Sheki, where the centre of the city was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2019. The first is Dara Bathhouse which has been unusable since the 1980s, but is protected and included in the list of architectural monuments. The bath is 6 metres underground, has pools with hot and cold water, and is lit from above by small holes in the domes which cover it. The second is the Yeraltı Hammam, also known as the Underground Bath or Abdulsalam Bath. In fact, it is located within the Juma Mosque, and only part of it is 4 metres below ground. The building is no longer used as a hammam.

===South Asia===
Public baths have ancient precedents in Indian civilisation. The Great Bath located in present-day Pakistan is a notable example dating from the 3rd millennium BC at the archeological site of Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley. Islamic hammams were introduced after the spread of Muslim rule in the subcontinent starting mainly with the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century and continuing through the later Mughal period (16th–19th centuries). Historically, however, public bathhouses in the Indian subcontinent were less common and less important than in other Muslim territories such as the Middle East and North Africa. This was due to the fact that, unlike most cities in those regions, water was readily available across much of India, making hammams less essential for bathing and performing full ablutions. While there were many elaborate hammams in private palaces and mansions, few Indian hammams were as important as those of Muslim cities further west.

Delhi, Hyderabad and Bhopal in India still have multiple working Turkish baths, which date back to the Mughal period in the early 16th century. Two prominent examples are the Hammam-e-Qadimi and Hammam-e-Lal Qila.

In Pakistan, Shahi Hammam or the Royal Bathhouse of Lahore, located in the historic Walled City, is one of the best preserved examples of a Mughal-era hammam. It was built in 1634 by the Mughal governor of Lahore, Hakim Ilmuddin Ansari, during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan.

===Greece===

Greece once had many historic hammams dating from the Ottoman period, from the late 14th century to the 18th century. Two of the oldest remaining examples are the Gazi Evrenos Hamam in Giannitsa, dating from 1392, and the Oruç Pasha Hammam in Didymoteicho, dating from 1398. Most have been abandoned, demolished or survive in a state of decay, but recently a growing number have been restored and converted to serve new cultural functions as historic sites or exhibitions spaces. A 2004 study by Elena Kanetaki counted 60 remaining hammam buildings on Greek territory.In Thessaloniki, formerly a major Ottoman city, the Bey Hamam was built in 1444 by Sultan Murad II. It is a double bath, for men and women, with notable architectural decoration. The baths remained in use, called the Baths of Paradise, until 1968. They were restored by the Greek Archaeological Service and are now used as a cultural venue. The late 16th-century Yeni Hamam has also been partially restored and now serves as a music venue. The Pasha Hamam, also known as the Phoenix Baths, was built circa 1520 or 1529 during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent and operated until 1981. It now houses archeological finds from construction work for the Thessaloniki metro.

Elsewhere in Greece, the Abid Efendi Hamam, built between 1430 and 1669 near the Roman Forum in Athens, restored in the 1990s and converted to the Center of Documentation in Body Embellishment. In Rhodes, a double bath called the Yeni Hamam dates from the 16th century and was restored in 1992–1995. It is now one of only two Turkish baths still operating as a bathhouse in Greece.

=== Cyprus ===
The Omeriye Baths in Nicosia/Lefkosia, Cyprus, date to the 15th century and form part of the larger complex of the Ömeriye Mosque (dedicated to the Caliph Omar). The complex was founded by Lala Mustafa Pasha in the 1570s, soon after the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus, repurposing the 14th-century Augustinian church of St. Mary which was damaged in the Ottoman siege. The hamam was restored in 2002–2004 as part of the Lefkosia Master Plan and is still in use today. In 2005 it won a Europa Nostra award for conservations.

On the Turkish side of the Cypriot border in Lefkoşa, the Büyük Hamamı dates from the same period and is still in operation for men and women.

=== North Macedonia ===
Some significant historic Ottoman hammams have also been preserved in North Macedonia. Two of the major examples in Skopje are now part of the National Gallery of Macedonia: the Daut Pasha Hamam (built in the late 15th century) and the Čifte Hammam (mid-15th century).

=== Bulgaria ===
The city of Plovdiv, which was the most important city in the area during Ottoman rule, had eight baths in the mid-17th century when Evliya Çelebi visited. Of these, only two have survived . The best-preserved is the large Chifte Banya or Çifte Hamam (also known as the Ancient Bath), which now serves as an art gallery. It was built in the 1460s, probably by Isfandiyaroğlu Ismail Bey, the deposed ruler of the Isfendiyarid Beylik in Anatolia. It is one of the largest preserved Ottoman hammams in the Balkans and its decoration includes some muqarnas.

===Hungary===
Budapest, the &#x27;City of Spas&#x27;, has four Turkish baths, all from the 16th century: Rudas Baths, Király Baths, Rácz Thermal Bath, and Veli bej (Császár) Bath (reopened to the public in December 2012). Currently only Rudas and Veli bej are open to the public, Rácz was closed in 2003 while Király was closed in 2020 for renovations. Eger also has a working hammam, simply called Török Fürdő (Turkish Bath), from the early 17th century.

===Crimea (Ukraine)===
In Bakhchisarai, by order of the Crimean Khan Sahib I Geray, the Sarı-Güzel hamam was built in 1532.

== Hammams in Western Europe ==

Aside from Al-Andalus (the mainly Spanish and Portuguese parts of Europe which were Muslim ruled until 1492) modern Western Europe has no legacy of historic hammams. Nevertheless, derivatively named Hummums existed in London&#x27;s Covent Garden in the first half of the 18th century. Sweating and bathing facilities were located there for some part of that period and, at other times, coffee houses, hotels, and houses of ill repute (bagnios) merged with, or replaced them, until a major fire destroyed them in 1768. But there have been no historic hammam structures in London which could have been considered part of the Islamic hammam tradition.

=== The British Isles in the 19th century ===
In the 19th century, readers of books in English were not ignorant of the existence of hammams, and there was no shortage of contemporary accounts describing what they were, and how travellers were fascinated by them. Authors such as Richard Robert Madden (in 1829), Edward William Lane (in 1836), and, in lighter vein, William Makepeace Thackeray (in 1846), had described them in their books, though most were typically orientalist in approach. In 1828, an anonymous (and still unknown) author self-published &quot;Strictures on the personal cleanliness of the English, with a description of the hammams of the Turks, &amp;c.&quot; in a limited edition of 250 copies. It was distributed by the radical publisher of &quot;The Republican&quot;, Richard Carlile, who had realised that in &quot;Strictures&quot; the author was not denigrating the Turks in the manner of orientalist authors; on the contrary, he was positioning them as a people to be emulated, by describing customs which his readers should adopt themselves. The unknown author wrote that he had wanted &quot;to erect baths at the expense of government in different parts of London, after the manner of the Roman &quot;thermæ&quot;, publicly endowed like hospitals for the use of the people,&quot; and that in 1818 he had unsuccessfully tried to interest George III in his project.

In 1850, David Urquhart’s travel book, &quot;The Pillars of Hercules,&quot; was published. This recounted his travels in Morocco and Spain in 1848. Two chapters described the hammams of Morocco and Turkey in considerable detail, and Urquhart became an advocate of what were then known in the English-speaking world as &quot;Turkish baths&quot; because those most often described in travel books were located in Turkey and the Ottoman Empire.

The book had no direct impact on the construction of a hammam until it was read in 1856 by Dr Richard Barter, an Irish physician and hydropathist. Barter, to the consternation of orthodox hydropathists, was already using the vapour bath cabinet therapeutically at St Ann&#x27;s, his hydropathic establishment near Cork. He immediately realised that the bath described by Urquhart was a major improvement on his vapour cabinets. He contacted Urquhart and offered him men, money, and materials, &quot;besides a number of patients upon whom experiments might be made&quot;, if he would visit St Ann&#x27;s, and build one for their use.

This first experimental beehive-shaped bath was unsuccessful, mainly because it had not been possible to heat the air to the required high temperature. This is the only documented 19th century attempt to build a hammam in Western Europe, after which the attempt was abandoned.

Instead, Dr Barter sent his architect, also named Richard Barter but unrelated to him, to Rome to study how the ancient &quot;thermae&quot; were constructed there. On his return he designed and supervised the building of what has become known as the first Victorian Turkish bath—a hot-air bath using hot &quot;dry&quot; air instead of the moist air of the hammam.

Back in England the following year (1857), Urquhart helped build the first such bath in Manchester. As a Turcophile, he argued strongly for calling the new bath a Turkish bath, though others unsuccessfully maintained that it should be called an Anglo-Roman bath, or as in Germany and elsewhere, the Irish, or Irish-Roman bath.

But all future 19th century hot-air baths in the British Isles were either based on the Irish-Roman model or later, and then only occasionally towards the end of the century, on the Russian steam bath. After Barter&#x27;s initial attempt, the hammam is not recorded as appearing again in Western Europe until after World War I.

=== France, post World War I ===
The first permanent mosque in modern France, La Grande Mosquée de Paris et Institut musulman, was not opened till 1926. Covering an area of 7,500 square metres, it also includes a &quot;madrasa&quot; (school), library, conference hall and, beyond the Moorish gardens, an annexe housing a hammam and a tearoom with a direct entrance to the street.

The building commemorates the many thousand Muslims who died fighting for France during World War I. It was built by architects Robert Fournez, Maurice Mantout, and Charles Heubès, following the plans of Maurice Tranchant de Lunel, General Inspector of Fine Arts in Morocco. Constructed in reinforced concrete, the decorative green tiles, earthenware, mosaics, and wrought iron work come from Maghreb countries, and were fitted by craft workers from there. In 1983, the building was inscribed in the Base Mérimée, the database of French monumental and architectural heritage, created and maintained by the French Ministry of Culture.

The hammam was originally open at separate times for men and women. It can be seen as it was in the mid 1960s, because it appears in a scene in Gérard Oury&#x27;s French-British comedy film &quot;La Grande Vadrouille&quot;. Bathers are shown being served drinks while reclining on long continuous cushioned platforms which are divided into cubicles by bead curtains. The cool wading pool in one of the hot rooms also appears.

Some time after a major refurbishment in the 2010s, the hammam&#x27;s admission policy changed. It appears that the mosque authorities now lease it to a private company which runs it, for women only, as a wellness centre with beauty treatments.

=== Europe, post World War II ===
The second half of the 20th century saw a new generation of war-weary, air-travelling holidaymakers returning from Turkey and other countries where they had discovered the hammam. But their discovery was not specifically seen as an extremely important part of Islamic culture, but as what had become, as a result of diminishing local use, a significant tourist leisure attraction. 

It was not long before baths based on the internal appearance of the hammam, with its central area and &quot;göbek tasi&quot; (belly-stone), started appearing in European hotels, health spas, and even as standalone hammam establishments. In Spain, for example, after nearly five centuries&#x27; absence, hammams are reappearing in cities such as Cordoba, Granada, Seville, and Madrid. Drawing on centuries of mixed traditions, their signs in Spanish and English, they are promoting a new view of the hammam to a younger generation of bathers, thereby attracting both tourists and locals, a trend currently developing around the continent.

==Cultural representations of the hammam==

=== Art ===
Within the Muslim world, hammams appeared in some artistic depictions such as Persian miniatures, including the work of Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād (or Bihzad).
In Western art, especially in the context of 19th-century Orientalism, the hammam is often portrayed as a place of sexual looseness, disinhibition and mystery. These Orientalist ideas paint the Arab or Turkish &quot;other&quot; as mystical and sensuous, lacking morality in comparison to their Western counterparts. A famous painting by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, &quot;Le Bain Turc&quot; (&quot;The Turkish Bath&quot;), depicts these spaces as magical and sexual. There are several women touching themselves or one another sensually, while some dance to music played by the woman in the centre of the painting. More recently, Sylvia Sleigh, has painted a gender-reversal take on Ingres&#x27;s painting. Her version also counters Ingres&#x27;s orientalist fantasy brothel figures by using her husband and some of her friends as real life models in more realistic surroundings.

=== Movies ===
Turkish director Ferzan Özpetek&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Hamam&quot; told the story of a man who inherited a hammam in Istanbul from his aunt, restored it and found a new life for himself in the process.

In Zélie Elkihel&#x27;s 5 minute animation, &quot;Hammam&quot;, a French-Moroccan woman shares a memory of her first enlightening visit to a hammam when she was 12.

=== Literature ===
Visiting a hammam was very much a part of the Western tourist experience from the 18th century onwards and many travellers left accounts of what they had seen in the bathhouses. One such was the British diplomat&#x27;s wife, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who visited a hammam in Sofia in Bulgaria in 1717 and wrote about it in her &quot;Turkish Embassy Letters&quot;, first published in 1763. In 1836 another British woman, the traveller and novelist, Julia Pardoe, left a description of taking part in the hammam ritual in Constantinople/Istanbul in her book &quot;The City of the Sultan and Domestic Manners of the&quot; &quot;Turks&quot;, published in 1838. In 1814 another wife of a British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henrietta Liston, visited a hammam in Bursa and wrote about it in her belatedly published diary. In her &quot;Romance of the Bosphorus&quot;, Dorina Clifton, a British woman who grew up in Constantinople/Istanbul, left a rare account of a visit to a local hammam in Kandilli, one of the Bosphorus villages, before the First World War. Several more contemporary accounts of using hammams in Turkey appeared in &quot;Tales from the Expat Harem&quot;, published in 2005.

<text>Josiah Clifton Firth (27 October 1826 – 11 December 1897) was a New Zealand farmer, businessman and politician who had a brief brush with fame as the messenger between Te Kooti and the New Zealand Government during Te Kooti&#x27;s War.

==Early life==
Born in Clifton, Yorkshire, England, on 27 October 1826, Firth was the son of a reverend and headmaster whose family had interests in farming, with investments in the wool trade. The family of his mother, Mary Firth, were involved in industry, controlling an iron works. When Firth was seven years old, his mother died. He was raised by his father and a servant and received a well-rounded education. The fortunes of his father declined after the 1847 economic crash and Firth took up farming in Yorkshire for a few years, before going to work for his mother&#x27;s family, managing an iron works.

==New Zealand==
In 1854, Firth left England to travel to Australia. After a brief period in Victoria and New South Wales, he moved onto New Zealand and settled in Auckland, establishing a business making bricks. He also took a one third interest in a steam powered flour mill in 1856. In 1859 he made his first visit to Matamata where he met and became friends with Wiremu Tamihana, the King Maker and met King Pōtatau during a tour of the Waikato he published in 1860. His account ended with a prophecy of the Invasion of the Waikato, saying, &quot;It is unfortunate that the remedy we propose should have an aspect of selfishness. For we say to them, and justly, &#x27;Sell three-fourths of your lands, and cease to be nomads, if you wish to save your race from extinction.&#x27; They not unnaturally decline the prescription when the fee is apparently so large. So the matter rests for the present. Time and the natural progress of events will, nevertheless, shortly either enforce the prescription and exact the fee, or consign the refractory patients to a swift and sure destruction.&quot;

In Auckland he was one of a small group of highly influential business men such as John Logan Campbell, Frederick Whitaker and Thomas Morrin. They had significant influence on The Bank of New Zealand and the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company. Firth was always able to borrow finance to capitalise his many innovative schemes.

Firth briefly entered Parliament for the Auckland West electorate. He was elected in 1861, and resigned on 30 April 1862. He promoted the purchase of land directly from Māori as had happened in the Wairarapa. This contravened the Treaty of Waitangi but had been a mechanism used from time to time in localised issues when Māori agreed.

In 1865 with the establishment of peace in the Waikato, Firth was able to lease land from Tamihana of Ngati Haua, a kingitanga tribe. Tamihana, who was a Christian, had been at the core of the Kingite movement but was at heart a man of peace. A large area of land around Matamata was leased for a rental of up to five hundred pounds a year. Two years later he bought outright some of the land covered by the lease and this became the basis of his estate at Matamata. By 1865, Firth had leased . &quot;The fern and bracken covered plains was burnt and soon sown in grassland and feed crops such as turnips.&quot;

He built his first homestead near Peria where Tamihana had earlier established a missionary station. When Tamihana died in 1866 Firth had a monument built at the place he died with an inscription that said it was Tamihana&#x27;s will that Firth stay on the Matamata land as long as he (Firth) chose. Meanwhile, his businesses in Auckland were prospering and he was able to lease a very fine house on the eastern side of Mount Eden from John Ogilvie (1839?–1871) Secretary to the Auckland Board of Commissioners (in 1871 he would purchase the house).

Early in 1870 Josiah, or Hohaia as he was known to Māori, was contacted by Te Kooti during his flight from Te Porere through the King Country and back to Te Urewera. From his base at Tapapa, near Tirau, Te Kooti sent a message to Firth to meet him at Tamihana&#x27;s monument. Firth claimed to have inherited Tamihana&#x27;s &quot;mantle of patience&quot;. Before the meeting Firth contacted Daniel Pollen, the general agent for the government in Auckland. On 17 January, Firth met Te Kooti. Firth told Te Kooti he had come to listen, as he had no power to offer any terms. They talked for some time with Te Kooti emphasising he would not surrender but wanted to be left in peace to live at Tapapa. Firth noted that although Te Kooti was unarmed he was backed by a semi circle of heavily armed men with modern weapons in good condition. He told Firth: &quot;If they let me alone I will live quietly; if not I will fight.&quot;

The government sent word to Firth that they had nothing to say to Te Kooti apart from if he surrendered he would be given safe conduct to Auckland. This telegram crossed with one from Firth outlining Te Kooti&#x27;s wishes. But Te Kooti had aroused too much fear and hatred for his offer to be accepted, and it was rejected out of hand. There was also considerable official annoyance with Firth. The Premier, Willian Fox, and the government agent for Hawkes Bay, John Davies Ormond, were irate &quot;with that meddlesome sweep Firth.&quot; The military were instructed to attack Te Kooti whether Firth was with him or not. For Te Kooti the whole meeting may have been another ruse, as shortly afterwards Chief Te Hiri from Coromandel arrived and gave Te Kooti a huge quantity of gunpowder (7 kegs) and a bag of bullets high. In fact, Te Kooti had &quot;predicted&quot; he would be given the ammunition down to the exact day and time. indicating the resupply mission had been prearranged.

In 1873, Firth began a seven-year project to clear the Waihou River of snags and obstacles to navigation thus opening the upper reaches of the Thames Estuary to shipping. He was the author of &quot;Our Kin across the Sea&quot;.
In 1871 Firth purchased his Auckland residence—Clifton—that he had previously leased, and extended the building. To the rear of the wooden Gothic house he erected a large wing in the castellated style which included a tall tower, completed in 1873. This structure was built in unreinforced concrete, an experimental material for the period. As well as providing a vantage point with splendid views of the Waitematā Harbour, the tower contained a water tank so the up-to-date indoor plumbing had good water pressure. The tower also contained a study for Firth in which he arranged a small museum of geological items and other curiosities. The house is a Category 1 Heritage New Zealand listed building. In 1882 at Matamata he constructed a second castellated tower, a slightly smaller version of the Mount Eden tower and likewise an extension to an earlier wooden residence. Known as Firth Tower, it is part of the Matamata museum.

Firth championed the use of concrete as a building material and significantly, Firth&#x27;s younger grandsons Ted and Tony would go on to found the Firth Concrete Company. Firth&#x27;s two concrete structures are now some of the earliest examples of concrete construction in the country, as John Logan Campbell&#x27;s 1871 house &#x27;Loganbank&#x27; in Official Bay has been demolished. As a member of the Beresford Street Congregationalist Church in Karangahape Road, Firth influenced the choice of concrete for that building as well (1875).

In 1882, Firth arranged a grand reception in the grounds of Clifton House for the Māori King, Tāwhiao. Firth had played a part in the establishment of Tāwhiao&#x27;s father, the Waikato chief Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, as the first Māori King in 1858.

New Zealand agriculture went through a serious depression during the 1880s, one which hit Firth hard, and in 1889 he was declared bankrupt. Later he began to develop a trade in pumice based on its properties of insulation and fire resistance, travelling to the United States and England. He died suddenly on 11 December 1897 just as the venture was becoming successful, and was buried at St Stephen&#x27;s Cemetery in the Auckland suburb of Parnell.

<doc id="304959" wikidata="Q920370" url="?curid=304959" title="Overman King Gainer">
<text>is a mecha anime television series, created and directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, written by Ichirō Ōkouchi, and featuring character designs by Yoshihiro Nakamura, Kinu Nishimura and Ken&#x27;ichi Yoshida. The series ran from September 7, 2002 to March 22, 2003 on Japan&#x27;s WOWOW network, spanning a total of 26 episodes. Following the 2012 closure of Bandai Entertainment, Sunrise announced at Otakon 2013, that Sentai Filmworks has acquired &quot;Overman King Gainer&quot;, along with a handful of other former BEI titles.

==Plot==
The setting and plot of &quot;Overman King Gainer&quot; are a loose adaptation of the novel series &quot;La Compagnie des glaces&quot; by the French writer Georges-Jean Arnaud. After an environmental cataclysm, much of the world&#x27;s population retreated into domed cities called &quot;Domepolis&quot;, which are run by an organization known as &quot;London IMA&quot; (International Management Authority) and its police arm, &quot;Saint Regan&quot;. However, the Domepoli are maintained and supplied by privatized firms such as the &quot;Siberian Railroad Company&quot;. Many years have passed since the cataclysm, and many have begun to believe that the world environment has recovered sufficiently enough for humans to begin living outside Domepoli. As such, some inhabitants begin planning Exoduses to leave these cities and to resettle their ancestral homelands. However, this does not sit well with the London IMA or the private firms that monopolize trade between the Domepoli, as the loss of people would not only lead to a loss in tax and trade revenue, but if the Exodus were to be successful, it would show the people that it was no longer necessary to rely on the London IMA or the private firms for survival. They fiercely oppose any Exoduses, spreading propaganda on the evils effects of Exoduses on the Earth&#x27;s environment, and using military force to prevent any attempted Exodus.

The story begins in a Domepolis in Siberia, where championship video game player Gainer Sanga is arrested by Siberian Railroad policewoman Adette Kistler on suspicion of being an Exodus member. Ironically he isn&#x27;t, but his friends Sara Kodama and Bello Korissha along with his schoolteacher Mamado Azaf are members of the Gauli team, a militia unit of the local Exodus group. At the same time, Exodus expert and coordinator Gain Bijou lets himself be arrested by the Siberian Railroad police as part of his plan to infiltrate the city and steal an &quot;Overman&quot;, which is a biomechanical giant robot, for use in defending the Exodus.

Gain is placed in the same prison cell as Gainer, and when Gain initiates his escape, only Gainer is willing to escape as well. They infiltrate the castle of Duke Medaiyu and steal an Overman in the Duke&#x27;s secret museum collection, which Gainer logs into as his video game handle: &quot;King Gainer&quot;. As Gainer gets the hang of piloting a real Overman, he and Gain encounter shut-in Princess Anna, the Duke&#x27;s daughter, who supports the Exodus and wants to see the world and people other than her tutor, Lioubov Smettana. Using an annual festival presented by idol singer and co–Exodus leader, Meeya Laujin, as cover, the Exodus executes their plan: take much of the Domepolis, block by block, using heavy hauler machines called Silhouette Mammoths and move them over 3000 km across the Siberian tundra to their ancestral homeland, &quot;Yapan&quot;. As the Exodus moves out, the Siberian Railroad police chief, Yassaba Jin, mobilizes his forces to stop them. Other obstacles to the Exodus are Kistler&#x27;s and Jin&#x27;s subordinates Jaboli Mariela, Kejinan Datto, and Enge Gam, Siberian Railroad president Kizz Munt, Saint Regan policemen Asuham Boone and Zakki Bronco, and Overman aces Cynthia Lane and Kashmir Valle.

==Characters==

===Yapan Exodus===
;Gainer Sanga
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Hirofumi Nojima (Japanese), Darrel Guilbeau (English)

Gainer is the headstrong main protagonist of the series. He lived his days as a high school truant and online gaming champion before meeting Gain Bijou, an Exodus specialist under the captivity of the Siberian Railway forces. Gainer initially opposes the Yapan Exodus, but through a series of coincidences and his connections with Gain and Sara, he suddenly finds himself soldiering for their cause. He pilots the long-haired Overman dubbed &quot;King Gainer&quot; after his online gaming handle. Despite being considered a &quot;general purpose&quot; Overman, King Gainer is frequently noted to be far faster and more powerful than an Overman of its class should be. This is eventually revealed to be because King Gainer is actually part of the same class of Overman as the legendary Overdevil, which makes it capable of using the Overfreeze and Overheat Overskills.

;Sara Kodama
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Ai Kobayashi (Japanese), Olivia O&#x27;Connor (English)

Sara Kodama is a diligent high school student and member of the Gauli Squad, a rebel soldier faction which supports the Yapan Exodus. Her work ethic is matched only by her heart, which she devotes mainly to Gainer. Her plan upon completion of the Yapan Exodus is to cultivate a farm. She primarily pilots a Panther-type Silhouette Machine as a scout.

;Gain Bijou
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Otoya Kawano (Japanese), Ron Allen (English)

A self-proclaimed &#x27;Exodus specialist&#x27;, Gain is an expert sniper and important member of the Yapan Exodus. His nickname, &#x27;Black Southern Cross&#x27;, was earned by his reputation for leaving bullet wounds in the shape of a cross within his fallen enemies. His affable demeanor outside the battlefield is pierced upon discussion of his mysterious past. He pilots the Silhouette Machine named Gottiko, which is mounted with a large railgun and has an Overman&#x27;s left arm, later revealed to be one of the left arms of the legendary Early Overman Brunhilde. He later pilots the pseudo-Overman known as Emperanza, which is built from both Overman and Silhouette Machine parts, including the salvaged left arm of Brunhilde. Brunhilde&#x27;s arm gives either machine limited control over gravity, typically used as a barrier against attacks.

;Princess Ana Medaiyu
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Noriko Kito (Japanese), Michelle Ruff (English)

Princess Ana is the daughter of Duke Medaiyu. Her lively nature and insatiable curiosity lead her to join the Yapan Exodus under the guise of a hostage. She owns three intelligent pet squirrels that heed her every command.

;Lioubov Smettana
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Ai Futamura (Japanese), Julie Ann Taylor (English)

Ana&#x27;s kind, brave, and loyal retainer. She has trouble keeping up with the princess at times and wishes to protect her at all costs.

;Adette Kistler
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Marika Hayashi (Japanese), Wendee Lee (English)

A commander of the Siberian Railway forces who mistakenly arrests Gainer just before the Yapan Exodus commences because of a case of mistaken identity. When the Yapan Exodus sets off, Adette infiltrates the traveling city units in order to capture Princess Ana. Gain quickly thwarts her attempt, and with nowhere else to go, she begrudgingly starts a new life on the Exodus as a high school teacher for Gainer and Sara&#x27;s class. She also moves in with Gainer to his chagrin. She&#x27;s a tough and shrewd woman, but childlike in her temper and affection toward men. She eventually begins commanding a troop of Exodus soldiers fanatically devoted to her, piloting a Dorbeck-type Silhouette Machine painted in her signature red.

;Bello Korissha
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Shusaku Otake (Japanese), Derek Stephen Prince (English first), Dave Mallow (English second)

A fellow Gauli Squad member and classmate of Gainer and Sara. He has feelings for Sara, but never seems to show them outside random acts of jealously toward Gainer. Despite this, he remains good friends with Gainer and Sara and a helpful ally on the battlefield. He typically commands the &quot;Bachclone&quot;,the lead Silhouette Mammoth vehicle towing the city blocks, which is also typically where King Gainer is stored.

;Meeya Laujin
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Yumiko Nakanishi (Japanese), Kate Davis (English)

A quasi-religious figure idolized by Exodus supporters, who is a key feature at festivals as she sings and dances. Despite her apparent status as an important figurehead, she is often treated more like a pop idol and has a ditzy and easily distracted nature.

;Louvre Won Dara
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Masako Chiba (Japanese), Kate Davis (English)

Meeya&#x27;s handler and manager.

;Mamado Azaf
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Rintaro Nishi (Japanese), David Orozco (English)

===Siberian Railroad Authority===
;Cynthia Lane
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Rena Mizuki (Japanese), Tara Malone (English)

Initially Gainer&#x27;s online gaming buddy with the handle &quot;Queen,&quot; Cynthia is actually an elite Siberian Railway soldier, raised and favored by Kizz Munt. She is almost always eating candy and treats everything, including piloting and dating, as a game to conquer because of her sheltered upbringing. Her trademark whimsy and inability to take things seriously comes with major consequences, as she ends up hurting a Gainer later in the series during a friendly piloting competition between Overmen. Cynthia&#x27;s natural piloting ability is said to have come from her mother, whose name is never mentioned; her only living relative appears to be Martina Lane. The shape-shifting Dominator is her Overman of choice.

;Yassaba Jin
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Hisao Egawa (Japanese), Michael McConnohie (English)

A Siberian Railway squad commander who originally pilots the time-stopping Overman Rushrod and later the stealthy Overman Blackmail. He is the first major opposition the Yapan Exodus faces. After being captured by the Yapan Exodus and escaping, he meets a young fortune-telling girl in the city blocks and they decide to Exodus together to her homeland in the south. He is only 32 years old despite looking much older.

;Kashmir Valle
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Keiji Fujiwara (Japanese), Chris Kent (English)

The Operations Director of the Siberian Railway, a flamboyant man obsessed with maintaining the perfect &quot;diagram,&quot; meeting any deviations to his meticulous scheduling with unchecked rage.

He also once pilots the Antlion, a quadrupedal drilling Overman.

;Jaboli Mariela
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Maki Tamura (Japanese), Mia Bradly (English)

A Siberian Railway officer who is initially Adette&#x27;s direct subordinate. She is noted to become fanatically devoted to anyone in power, clinging to whoever is the highest authority at the time.

;Kejinan Datto
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Hiroshi Kitazawa (Japanese), David Lelyveld (English)

A Siberian Railway officer obsessed with gaining ranks and status. He is partnered with Enge and is denoted by his ugly face and bad posture. He is usually controlling a Silhouette Machine, but is given an Under-Golame Overman when briefly under Asuham Boone&#x27;s command and once pilots the Overman Mexbrute, which can create illusions.

;Kizz Munt
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Seiji Sasaki (Japanese), James Lyon (English)

President of the Siberian Railway. Despite his eccentric personality, he is actually a fairly ruthless man who mercilessly stops any Exodus that could threaten his organization.

;Enge Gam
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Tsuyoshi Koyama (Japanese), Richard George (English)

A Siberian Railway officer partnered with Kejinan, denoted by his eyepatch and slightly more professional demeanor compared to his partner. Though he is usually behind the controls of a Silhouette Machine, he is given an Under-Golame Overman when he is briefly under Asuham Boone&#x27;s command.

;Ariel Nielson

His only real objective is to capture Gain and force him to confront his sister, Karin, who has conceived and raised a child from a one-night stand with Gain. His obsession with Gain ultimately degrades into homicidal madness, culminating in him intentionally awakening the Overdevil to destroy the world. His plans are derailed after the Overdevil is defeated and Karin suddenly arrives to drag him home. He usually pilots a Golame-type Overman, which is a mass-produced London IMA model for high-ranking pilots. He also once pilots the Overman Jinba, with the ability to &quot;steal&quot; anything within a certain range, and steals the Dominator from Cynthia later on.

;Zakki Bronco
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Takashi Nakamura (Japanese), Richard Hayworth (English)

Asuham&#x27;s direct subordinate, who typically pilots a Golame-type Overman.

===Others===
;Karin Boone
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Fumiko Orikasa (Japanese), Lynn Fischer (English)

Karin is Asuham&#x27;s sister and Gain&#x27;s former lover. After a one-night stand, she ends up conceiving a daughter. However, she has no lingering feelings for Gain and tracks Asuham down to drag him home.

;Martina Lane
* &quot;Voiced by:&quot; Toshiko Sawada (Japanese), Barbara Goodson (English)

Cynthia Lane&#x27;s grandmother, who was frozen by the Overdevil&#x27;s Overfreeze several years ago. She is discovered in the Crystal of Agate fortress, which held the Overdevil in stasis, and freed, joining the Yapan Exodus to help them take down the Overdevil.

<doc id="304970" wikidata="Q162098" url="?curid=304970" title="Netrek">
<text>Netrek is an Internet game for up to 16 players, written almost entirely in cross-platform open-source code. It combines features of multi-directional shooters and team-based real-time strategy games. Players attempt to disable or destroy their opponents&#x27; ships in real-time combat, while taking over enemy planets by bombing them and dropping off armies they pick up on friendly planets. The goal of the game is to capture all the opposing team&#x27;s planets.

Developed as a successor to 1986&#x27;s &quot;Xtrek&quot;, &quot;Netrek&quot; was first played in 1988. It was the third Internet game, the first Internet team game, and as of 2022 is the oldest Internet game still actively played. It pioneered many technologies used in later games and has been cited as prior art in patent disputes. &quot;Xtrek&quot; and &quot;Netrek&quot; are the oldest games of what is now called the MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) genre.

== Description ==
The following describes &quot;Bronco Netrek&quot;, also known as &quot;Vanilla Netrek&quot;. Other variations of the game exist, such as &quot;Hockey Netrek&quot; in which players use tractor beams to manipulate a hockey puck. &quot;Paradise Netrek&quot;, which originated as a re-implementation of Netrek at Utah State University, has radically different gameplay, including a far larger number of planets, &quot;transwarp&quot; speed, new ship types, and an additional rank structure. However, &quot;Bronco&quot; is the most prevalent form.

&quot;Netrek&quot; is essentially a greatly expanded version of &quot;Empire&quot;, a multi-user space combat game that ran on the PLATO. &quot;Empire&quot;, in turn, is essentially a multi-user version of the seminal &quot;Spacewar!&quot;, the earliest computer video game. Like those games, in &quot;Netrek&quot; each player takes command of a starship, which they pilot about a 2D map of the game galaxy, as seen from above. The game combines both tactical combat and strategic goals.

===Planets and facilities===
The game galaxy consists of 40 planets distributed about the map. The map is further divided into 4 sectors of 10 planets each. &quot;Netrek&quot; divided the players into one of four teams, loosely based on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe; the Federation, Romulans, Klingons, and Orions (or &quot;feds&quot;, &quot;roms&quot;, &quot;klis&quot;, and &quot;oris&quot;, respectively). Each team is assigned to a single sector when the map is reset.

The planets differ from each other in terms of military or agricultural development; at the start of a game each team has several planets under their control one of which is their homeworld, usually named after an actual planet in the Star Trek Universe (such as Earth for feds, Romulus for roms, Orion for oris, Klingus for klis). Some worlds, however, have special facilities that help any friendly units in orbit of them. Repair facilities, represented by a wrench, speed up repairs to the player&#x27;s hull and shields, which take damage while battling enemies. Fuel depots, represented by a fuel can, speed up the fuel recharge rate of any ships in orbit of the planet. Some worlds may have both these while others have one or none. As well as fuel and repair facilities, some planets generate armies at a faster rate than other planets; these planets are known as agricultural planets, or &quot;agris&quot;. A team&#x27;s home planet always offers fuel and repair facilities, but is never an agricultural planet. Of the nine other starting planets, two are agricultural and others are assigned fuel depots or repair facilities. Planets slowly generate armies (and at a faster rate if agricultural), which may be beamed up by players, and then beamed back down onto enemy planets to capture them. Planets can be bombed to kill off armies, but only to a point; dropping armies is always required.

Planets will fire upon enemy ships in orbit, even to the point of captured homeworlds firing upon ships from the homeworld&#x27;s starting faction as they appear over the planet.

===Combat===
Unlike &quot;Spacewar!&quot; or &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Netrek&quot; includes many different ship types with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some, like the scout, are faster and are useful for long range hit-and-run attacks. Others, like the battleship, are extremely powerful but slow, useful primarily for point defense.

A player obtains &quot;kills&quot; either by killing an enemy ship or by bombing enemy armies. The number of kills decides how many armies a player&#x27;s ship can carry. The player&#x27;s kill count resets back to zero each time their ship is destroyed, requiring them to obtain more kills before they can carry armies and capture planets. Consequently, people with two or more kills are often targeted for &quot;ogging&quot; (a kind of kamikaze attack) just to remove the threat of them carrying armies.

Enemy ships can be destroyed using two main weapons systems: phasers and photon torpedoes. Phasers are instantaneous beam weapons which cannot be dodged, while torpedoes take time to travel to the target and thus can be dodged. Other shipboard combat systems include shields, and tractor and pressor beams. When a ship is destroyed, the player chooses a new ship and reappears next to their team&#x27;s homeworld.

In addition, ships also sustain damage if they are too close to an explosion, such as those created by another ship being destroyed, and ships take damage from hostile planets they are close to.

== Game play ==
The ultimate goal of the game is to capture all of the enemy&#x27;s planets. Game play is normally between only two teams, the other two quarters of the galaxy being known as &quot;third space&quot;, referring to the third-party nature of the non-playing teams. When two teams each have at least four players, the server enters &quot;Tournament Mode&quot;, or &quot;T-Mode&quot;, in which planets can be bombed and captured. Once one team has only two planets remaining, a twenty-minute count down timer for their automatic surrender begins. Capturing a third planet will freeze the counter, while a fourth will remove the threat of automatic surrender.

If one or both teams have less than four players, the game enters &quot;Pre-T Mode&quot;, in which a team wins by simply having 4 more planets than their opponents. In this mode, stats are not saved, and the Pre-T galaxy is erased when &quot;T-Mode&quot; exists. On some servers, &quot;Pre-T Robots&quot; fill in empty player spots to create a 4 vs. 4 game, but get replaced by players as the players log on.

Players join and leave the game as they wish. Pickup games can be as short as ten or fifteen minutes, but are normally much longer. &quot;Clue Games&quot; are games between experienced players, which are usually timed for an hour with a half-hour of overtime, and a scoring system is used to determine victory.

==History==
&quot;Netrek&quot; is largely derived from &quot;Empire&quot;, written for the PLATO mainframe system beginning in 1973. It shares many characteristics of that game; key differences include a different planet layout and a much different pace of play, as well as evolutionary factors such as the use of mice instead of keyboard commands, TCP/IP networking, and the inclusion of color and sound.

In 1982, UC Berkeley student David Davis began writing a UNIX game called trek82, based on what he remembered of &quot;Empire&quot; when he used the PLATO system while at the University of Hawaii. This version emerged as &quot;trek82&quot;, using character graphics for display and a shared file to exchange data. Chris Guthrie joined Davis, and introduced him to Jef Poskanzer and Craig Leres, who were working on a more strategic offshoot of &quot;Empire&quot; called &quot;Conquest&quot;. They produced an updated version known as &quot;trek83&quot;.

In 1986, Guthrie began porting &quot;trek83&quot; to the newly released X Window System, producing &quot;Xtrek&quot;. Further development took place at the XCF, with the help of Ed James. In the spring of 1988, &quot;Xtrek II&quot; was written by Scott Silvey and K. Smith, moving from a model which used X as a transport to the game having its own client–server protocol. This was key in allowing the game to be ported to other platforms, which may or may not support X. This version was later developed into &quot;Netrek&quot; by Scott Silvey, Kevin Smith and Terence Chang.

In 1989, the source code was posted to Usenet. In the fall of 1990, UCB alumnus Terence Chang set up a public &quot;Netrek&quot; server at Carnegie Mellon University where he was attending graduate school. In spring 1991, the first inter-scholastic game was played between UCB and CMU, and in January 1992, the &quot;International Netrek League&quot; (INL) was formed, so that teams could form and compete with one another (as opposed to pick-up play, in which games are played by whoever connects to a server, and players enter and leave as they wish during the course of the game). &quot;Netrek&quot; was very popular in the Carnegie Mellon computer clusters for a number of years in the early 1990s.

In 1993, Heiko Wengler at the Technical University of Dortmund added Short Packets, an improved network protocol that reduced traffic by 40–75% and enabled competitive play via low-bandwidth connections.

&quot;Netrek&quot; play peaked in the middle to late 1990s, with several leagues existing for different forms of the game as well as for different regions, and several pickup games always active, 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Between 2002 and 2006 there was a steady decline in play. As of early 2007, Netrek has seen a moderate increase in playerbase coupled with a mild renaissance in development. In late 2006 &quot;Mactrek&quot;, a new client for the Macintosh, was released, and substantial changes are being made to the Windows clients as well as various server enhancements. In 2019, an open source Netrek client was implemented in the Swift programming language and made available in the MacOS App Store. Currently there is a move from 10 frame/s to 50 frame/s, and the addition of voice chat is being considered.

==Technological innovations==
&quot;Netrek&quot; pioneered the use of many technologies and design features that later found their way into commercial network games, including:
* The efficient use of fast but unreliable UDP packets as well as reliable but slower TCP streams. It was probably the first game to use both types of Internet Protocol packets.
* A robust client–server model that reduces the data exchange to &quot;need to know&quot; information, limiting both the required bandwidth and the opportunities for players to cheat by obtaining more knowledge of the game world than their opponents.
* Persistent account information where players can create a &quot;character&quot;, and log in and gain ranks over multiple games.
* Game mechanics designed to reduce the ability of assisted or robot player aimbots (referred to as borgs) to gain a significant advantage over a human player.
* An anti-cheating mechanism using an RSA-based public key cryptography authentication system that also attempts (with limited success) to detect and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
* Multiple game variants played by the same client, with the server telling the client what game features are supported.
* The use of metaservers, servers designed to help clients locate available game servers.
* Netrek Nexus, a web site about playing and programming Netrek launched in January 1994, originally hosted by the University of Arizona and maintained by Jeff Nelson, was the 779th web site submitted to the World Wide Web Worm, an early search engine.

<text>Alomancy, also called adromancy, ydromancie, idromancie, and halomancy, is an ancient form of divination. Similar to many other forms of divination, the diviner casts salt crystals into the air and interprets the patterns as it falls to the ground or travels through the air. The diviner can also interpret patterns that are formed from the residue of a salt solution as it evaporates in the bowl. The exact interpretations are unknown, but it probably follows a similar method to aleuromancy.

Salt itself is often intertwined with luck, and some of this ancient tradition can be seen in the superstitions, such as the perceived misfortune when the salt cellar is overturned, and the custom of throwing salt over the left shoulder for good luck.

One form of alomancy consists of the casting of salt into a fire, which is considered a type of pyromancy.

<text>Vasubandhu (; Tibetan: དབྱིག་གཉེན་ ; fl. 4th to 5th century CE) was an influential Indian Buddhist monk and scholar. He was a philosopher who wrote commentary on the Abhidharma, from the perspectives of the Sarvastivada and Sautrāntika schools. After his conversion to Mahayana Buddhism, along with his brother, Asanga, he was also one of the main founders of the Yogacara school.

Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharmakośakārikā&quot; (&quot;Commentary on the Treasury of the Abhidharma&quot;) is widely used in Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism, as the major source for non-Mahayana Abhidharma philosophy. His philosophical verse works set forth the standard for the Indian Yogacara metaphysics of &quot;appearance only&quot; (&quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot;), which has been described as a form of &quot;epistemological idealism&quot;, phenomenology and close to Immanuel Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism. Apart from this, he wrote several commentaries, works on logic, argumentation and devotional poetry.

Vasubandhu is one of the most influential thinkers in the Indian Buddhist philosophical tradition. Because of their association with Nalanda university, Vasubandhu and Asanga are amongst the so-called Seventeen Nalanda Masters. In Jōdo Shinshū, he is considered the Second Patriarch; in Chan Buddhism, he is the 21st Patriarch.

==Life and works==
Different sources provide different places for Vasubandhu&#x27;s birthplace. Xuanzang states that Vasubandhu was born in Gandhara however Buton Rinchen Drup places Vasubandhu in Central India. Vasubandhu&#x27;s name means &quot;the Kinsman of Abundance.&quot; Tibetan Buddhism sees the two brothers as part of the six great Indian commentators called the &quot;Six Ornaments&quot;. He was contemporaneous with Chandragupta I, father of Samudragupta. This information temporally places this Vasubandhu in the 4th century CE. The earliest biography of Vasubandhu was translated into Chinese by Paramärtha (499-569).

Vasubandhu initially studied with the Buddhist Sarvāstivāda (also called Vaibhāṣika, who upheld the &quot;Mahavibhasa&quot; commentary) school which was dominant in Gandhara, and later moved to Kashmir to study with the heads of the orthodox Sarvastivada branch there. After returning home, he lectured on Abhidharma and composed the &quot;Abhidharmakośakārikā&quot; (&quot;Verses on the Treasury of the Abhidharma&quot;), a verse distillation of Sarvastivada Abhidharma teachings, which was an analysis of all factors of experience into its constituent dharmas (phenomenal events). However Vasubandhu had also begun to question Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika view for some time, and had studied with the Sautrāntika teacher, Manoratha. Thus, his auto-commentary to his Abhidharma verses sometimes criticize the Vaibhāṣika system from a Sautrāntika viewpoint. However, the work is not always critical of Vaibhāṣika, and in some cases, it also defends the orthodox Vaibhasika position. The &quot;Abhidharmakośa&quot; remains the main source for Abhidharma studies in both Tibetan Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism.

Vasubandhu is later said to have converted to Mahayana beliefs under the influence of his brother Asanga, whereupon he composed a number of Yogacara treatises and Mahayana sutra commentaries. Some of his most influential Mahayana works have been the &quot;Twenty Verses on Consciousness Only&quot; (&quot;Vimśatikāvijñaptimātratāsiddhi&quot;), with its commentary (&quot;Viṃśatikāvṛtti&quot;), the &quot;Thirty Verses on Consciousness-only&quot; (&quot;Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā&quot;) and his &quot;Discourse on the Pure Land&quot; (&quot;Jìngtǔ lùn&quot; 浄土論). The &quot;Thirty Verses&quot; is the basis for Xuanzang&#x27;s &quot;Cheng Wei Shi Lun&quot;, one of the most important sources in East Asian Yogacara Buddhism. His Pure Land treatise was also very influential on East Asian Pure Land Buddhism. 

In India, Vasubandhu became known as a major Mahayana master, scholar and debater. He is reported to have defeated Samkhya philosophers in debate in front of the Gupta king &quot;Vikramaditya&quot; (variously identified as Chandragupta II or Skandagupta) at Ayodhya, who is said to have rewarded him with 300,000 pieces of gold. Vasubandhu used the money he made from royal patronage and debating victories to build Buddhist monasteries and hospitals.

As per traditional accounts, Vasubandhu died while visiting Nepal at the age of 100.

=== Attributed works ===

===Two Vasubandhus theory===
Erich Frauwallner, a mid-20th-century Buddhologist, sought to distinguish two Vasubandhus, one the Yogācārin and the other a Sautrāntika, but this view has largely fallen from favour in part on the basis of the anonymous &quot;Abhidharma-dīpa&quot;, a critique of the &quot;Abhidharmakośakārikā&quot; which clearly identifies Vasubandhu as the sole author of both groups of writings. According to Dan Lusthaus, &quot;Since the progression and development of his thought ... is so strikingly evident in these works, and the similarity of vocabulary and style of argument so apparent across the texts, the theory of Two Vasubandhus has little merit.&quot; Scholarly consensus on this question has generally moved away from Frauwallner&#x27;s &quot;two-authors&quot; position.

==Philosophy==

===Abhidharma===
Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Verses on the Treasury of the Abhidharma&quot; contains a description of all 75 dharmas (phenomenal events), and then outlines the entire Sarvastivada doctrine including &quot;meditation practices, cosmology, theories of perception, causal theories, the causes and elimination of moral problems, the theory of rebirth, and the qualities of a Buddha.&quot; The Treasury and its commentary also expound all kinds of arguments relating to the Sarvastivada Abhidharma and critique those arguments from a Sautantrika perspective in the commentary. Major arguments include an extensive critique of the Self (Atman and Pudgala) and a critique of the Sarvastivada theory of &quot;the existence of the dharmas of the three time periods [past, present and future]&quot;. In the Treasury, Vasubadhu also argued against a Creator God (Ishvara) and against the Sarvastivada theory of &quot;avijñaptirūpa&quot; (&quot;unperceived physicality&quot; or &quot;invisible physicality&quot;).

===Critique of the self===
Vasubandhu&#x27;s critique of the self is a defence of Buddhist Anatman doctrine, and also a critique of the Buddhist Personalist School and Hindu view of the soul. It is intended to show the unreality of the self or person as over and above the five skandhas (heaps, aggregates which make up an individual). Vasubandhu begins by outlining the soteriological motive for his argument, writing that any view which sees the self as having independent reality (e.g. the Hindu view) is not conducive to Nirvana.

Vasubandhu then evaluates the idea of the Self from epistemic grounds (Pramana). Vasubandhu states that what is real can only be known from perception (Pratyakṣa) or inference (Anumāṇa). Perception allows one to observe directly the objects of the six sense spheres. Inference allows one to infer the existence of sense organs. However, there is no such inference for a solid real Self apart from the stream of constantly changing sense perceptions and mental activity of the sense spheres.

Vasubandhu also argues that because the Self is not causally efficient, it is mere convention (prajñapti) and a “conceptual construction” (parikalpita). This argument is mainly against the Buddhist Pudgalavada school who held a view of a &#x27;person&#x27; that was dependent on the five aggregates, yet was also distinct, in order to account for the continuity of personality. Vasubandhu sees this as illogical: for him, the Self is made up of constantly changing sensory organs, sense impressions, ideas and mental processes. Any imagined unity of self-hood is a false projection.

Vasubandhu also uses this analysis of the stream of consciousness to attack non-Buddhist Hindu views of the Atman. Vasubandhu shows that the Hindu view of the Self as &#x27;controller&#x27; is refuted by an analysis of the flux and disorder of mental events and the inability of the supposed Self to control our minds and thoughts in any way we would like. If the Self is truly an eternal un-caused agent, it should be unaffected by mere physical and mental causes, and it also seems difficult to explain how such a force existing independently outside of the mind could causally interact with it. Vasubandhu also answers several common objections to the Buddhist not-self view such as how karma works without a Self and what exactly undergoes rebirth. Vasubandhu points to the causal continuum of aggregates/processes which undergoes various changes leading to future karmic events and rebirth.

===Momentariness===
During Vasubandhu&#x27;s era, the philosophy of space and time was an important issue in Buddhist philosophy. The Sarvāstivādin tradition which Vasubandhu studied held the view of the existence of dharmas (phenomenal events) in all three times (past, present, future). This was said to be their defining theoretical position, hence their name Sarvāstivāda is Sanskrit for &quot;theory of all exists&quot;. In contrast to this eternalist view, the Sautrāntika, a rival offshoot, held the doctrine of &quot;extreme momentariness&quot;, a form of presentism (only the present moment exists).

In the &quot;Abhidharmakośakārikā&quot;, Vasubandhu puts forth the Sarvāstivādin theory, and then in his commentary (bhasya) he critiques this theory and argues for the &#x27;momentariness&#x27; of the Sautrāntika. He also later wrote the &quot;Karma-siddhi-prakaraṇa&quot; (&quot;Exposition Establishing Karma&quot;) which also expounded the momentariness view (&quot;kṣanikavāda&quot;). Vasubandhu&#x27;s view here is that each dharma comes into existence only for a moment in which it discharges its causal efficacy and then self-destructs, the stream of experience is then a causal series of momentary dharmas. The issue of continuity and transference of karma is explained in the latter text by an exposition of the &quot;storehouse consciousness&quot; (&quot;ālayavijñāna&quot;), which stores karmic seeds (bīja) and survives rebirth.

===Yogacara theories===
According to Dan Lusthaus, Vasubandhu&#x27;s major ideas are:

*&quot;Whatever we are aware of, think about, experience, or conceptualize, occurs to us nowhere else than within consciousness.&quot;
*&quot;External objects do not exist.&quot;
*&quot;Karma is collective and consciousness is intersubjective.&quot;
*&quot;All factors of experience (dharmas) can be catalogued and analyzed.&quot;
*&quot;Buddhism is a method for purifying the stream of consciousness from &#x27;contaminations&#x27; and &#x27;defilements.&#x27;&quot;
*&quot;Each individual has eight types of consciousness, but Enlightenment (or Awakening) requires overturning their basis, such that consciousness (vijñaana) is &#x27;turned&#x27; into unmediated cognition (jñaana).&quot;

===Appearance only===
Vasubandhu&#x27;s main Yogacara works (Viṃśatikā and Triṃśikā) put forth the theory of &quot;vijñaptimātra&quot; which has been rendered variously as &#x27;representation-only&#x27;, &#x27;consciousness-only&#x27; and &#x27;appearance-only&#x27;. While some scholars such as Lusthaus see Vasubandhu as expounding a phenomenology of experience, others (Sean Butler) see him as expounding some form of Idealism similar to Kant or George Berkeley.

The Twenty verses begins by stating:

In Mahayana philosophy...[reality is] viewed as being consciousness-only...Mind (citta), thought (manas), consciousness (chit), and perception (pratyaksa) are synonyms. The word &quot;mind&quot; (citta) includes mental states and mental activities in its meaning. The word &quot;only&quot; is intended to deny the existence of any external objects of consciousness. We recognize, of course, that &quot;mental representations seem to be correlated with external (non-mental) objects; but this may be no different from situations in which people with vision disorders &#x27;see&#x27; hairs, moons, and other things that are &#x27;not there.&#x27;&quot;

One of Vasubandhu&#x27;s main arguments in the Twenty verses is the Dream argument, which he uses to show that it is possible for mental representations to &quot;appear&quot; to be restricted by space and time. He uses the example of mass hallucinations (in Buddhist hell) to defend against those who would doubt that mental appearances can be shared. To counter the argument that mere mental events have no causal efficacy, he uses the example of a wet dream. Vasubandhu then turns to a mereological critique of physical theories, such as Buddhist atomism and Hindu Monism, showing that his appearance only view is much more parsimonious and rational.

The Thirty verses also outlines the Yogacara theory of the Eight Consciousnesses and how each one can be overcome by the stages of enlightenment, turning consciousness (vijnana) into unmediated cognition (jnana) by cleansing the stream of consciousness from ‘contaminations&#x27; and ‘defilements.’ The &quot;Treatise on Buddha Nature&quot; was extremely influential in East Asian Buddhism by propounding the concept of tathagatagarbha (Buddha Nature).

===Three natures and non-duality===
The Thirty verses and the &quot;Three Natures Exposition&quot; (Trisvabhavanirdesha) does not, like the Twenty verses, argue for appearance only, but assumes it and uses it to explain the nature of experience which is of &quot;three natures&quot; or &quot;three modes&quot;. These are the fabricated nature (parikalpitasvabhāva), the dependent (paratantrasvabhāva) and the absolute (pariniṣpannasvabhāva). The fabricated nature is the world of everyday experience and mental appearances. Dependent nature is the causal process of the arising of the fabricated nature while the absolute nature is things as they are in themselves, with no subject object distinction.

According to Vasubandhu, the absolute, reality itself (dharmatā) is non-dual, and the dichotomy of perception into perceiver and perceived is actually a conceptual fabrication. For Vasubandhu, to say that something is non-dual is that it is both conceptually non-dual and perceptually non-dual. To say that &quot;I&quot; exist is to conceptually divide the causal flux of the world into self and other, a false construct. Just the same, to say that an observed object is separate from the observer is also to impute a false conception into the world as it really is - perception only. Vasubandhu uses the analogy of a magician who uses a magic spell (dependent nature, conceptual construction) to make a piece of wood (the absolute, non-duality) look like an elephant (fabricated nature, duality). The basic problem for living beings who suffer is that they are fooled by the illusion into thinking that it is real, that self and duality exists, true wisdom is seeing through this illusion.

===Logic===
Vasubandhu contributed to Buddhist logic and is held to have been the origin of formal logic in the Indian logico-epistemological tradition. He was particularly interested in formal logic to fortify his contributions to the traditions of dialectical contestability and debate. Anacker (2005: p. 31) holds that:

&quot;A Method for Argumentation (Vāda-vidhi)&quot; is the only work on logic by Vasabandhu which has to any extent survived. It is the earliest of the treatises known to have been written by him on the subject. This is all the more interesting because &quot;Vāda-vidhi&quot; marks the dawn of Indian formal logic. The title, &quot;Method for Argumentation&quot;, indicates that Vasabandhu&#x27;s concern with logic was primarily motivated by the wish to mould formally flawless arguments, and is thus a result of his interest in philosophical debate.

This text also paved the way for the later developments of Dignaga and Dharmakirti in the field of logic.

<text>East Asian Buddhism or East Asian Mahayana is a collective term for the schools of Mahāyāna Buddhism which developed across East Asia and which rely on the Chinese Buddhist canon. These include the various forms of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese Buddhism. East Asian Buddhists constitute the numerically largest body of Buddhist traditions in the world, numbering over half of the world&#x27;s Buddhists. 

East Asian forms of Buddhism all derive from the sinicized Buddhist schools which developed during the Han dynasty and the Song dynasty, and therefore are influenced by Chinese culture and philosophy. The spread of Buddhism to East Asia was aided by the trade networks of the Silk Road and the missionary work of generations of Indian and Asian Buddhists. Some of the most influential East Asian traditions include Chan (Zen), Nichiren Buddhism, Pure Land, Huayan, Tiantai, and Chinese Esoteric Buddhism. These schools developed new, uniquely East Asian interpretations of Buddhist texts and focused on the study of Mahayana sutras. According to Paul Williams, this emphasis on the study of the sutras contrasts with the Tibetan Buddhist attitude which sees the sutras as too difficult unless approached through the study of philosophical treatises (shastras).

The texts of the Chinese Buddhist Canon began to be translated in the second century and the collection continued to evolve over a period of a thousand years with the first woodblock printed edition being published in 983. A major modern edition of this canon is the Taishō Tripiṭaka, produced in Japan between 1924 and 1932. Besides sharing a canon of scripture, the various forms of East Asian Buddhism have also adapted East Asian values and practices which were not prominent in Indian Buddhism, such as Chinese ancestor veneration and the Confucian view of filial piety. 

East Asian Buddhist monastics generally follow the monastic rule known as the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. One major exception is some schools of Japanese Buddhism where Buddhist clergy sometimes marry, without following the traditional monastic code or Vinaya. This developed during the Meiji Restoration, when a nationwide campaign against Buddhism forced certain Japanese Buddhist sects to change their practices.

==Buddhism in East Asia==
===Buddhism in China===

Buddhism in China has been characterized by complex interactions with China&#x27;s indigenous religious traditions, Taoism and Confucianism, and varied between periods of institutional support and repression from governments and dynasties. Buddhism was first introduced to China during the Han dynasty, at a time when the Han empire expanded its nascent corresponding geopolitical influence into the reaches of Central Asia. Opportunities for vibrant cultural exchanges and trade contacts along the Silk Road and sea trade routes with the Indian subcontinent and maritime Southeast Asia made it inevitable that the percolation of Buddhism would penetrate into China and gradually into the rest of East Asia at large. Such religious transmissions were able to be afforded to enable the inexorable percolation of Buddhism into East Asia over a millennia due to the vibrant cultural exchanges that were able to be made at that time as a result of the Silk Road. 

Chinese Buddhism has strongly influenced the development of Buddhism in other East Asian countries, with the Chinese Buddhist Canon serving as the primary religious texts for other countries in the region. 

Early Chinese Buddhism was influenced by translators from Central Asia who began the translation of large numbers of Tripitaka and commentarial texts from India and Central Asia into Chinese. Early efforts to organize and interpret the wide range of texts received gave rise to early Chinese Buddhist schools like the Huayan and Tiantai schools. In the 8th century, the Chan school began to emerge, eventually becoming the most influential Buddhist school in East Asia and spreading throughout the region.

===Buddhism in Japan===
Buddhism was officially introduced to Japan from China and Korea during the 5th and 6th centuries AD. In addition to developing their own versions of Chinese and Korean traditions (such as Zen, a Japanese form of Chan and Shingon, a form of Chinese Esoteric Buddhism), Japan developed their own indigenous traditions like Tendai, based on the Chinese Tiantai, Nichiren, and Jōdo Shinshū (a Pure Land school).

===Buddhism in Korea===
Buddhism was introduced to Korea from China during the 4th century, where it began to be practiced alongside indigenous shamanism. Following strong state support in the Goryeo era, Buddhism was suppressed during the Joseon period in favor of Neo-Confucianism. Suppression was finally ended due to Buddhist participation in repelling the Japanese invasion of Korea in the 16th century, leading to a slow period of recovery that lasted into the 20th century. The Seon school, derived from Chinese Chan Buddhism, was introduced in the 7th century and grew to become the most widespread form of modern Korean Buddhism, with the Jogye Order and Taego Order as its two main branches.

=== Buddhism in Vietnam ===

Bordering southern China, Buddhism may have first come to Vietnam as early as the 3rd or 2nd century BCE from the Indian subcontinent or from China in the 1st or 2nd century CE. Vietnamese Buddhism was influenced by certain elements of Taoism, Chinese spirituality, and Vietnamese folk religion.

<doc id="304987" wikidata="Q259381" url="?curid=304987" title="The Dream Syndicate">
<text>The Dream Syndicate is an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles, California, originally active from 1981 to 1989, and reunited since 2012. The band is associated with neo-psychedelia and the Paisley Underground music movement; of the bands in that movement, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the Dream Syndicate &quot;rocked with the highest degree of unbridled passion and conviction.&quot; Though never commercially successful, the band met with considerable acclaim, especially for its songwriting and guitar playing. Bandleader Steve Wynn reformed the band in 2012, and four studio albums have been released since 2017.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1981–1983)===
While attending the University of California, Davis, Steve Wynn and Kendra Smith played together (with future True West members Russ Tolman and Gavin Blair) in a band called the Suspects, regarded as the first new wave-influenced band in the Davis, California, music scene. Wynn also recorded a 1981 single with a trio that he called 15 Minutes, which included members of Alternate Learning.

After Wynn moved back to Los Angeles, while rehearsing in a band called Goat Deity (with future Wednesday Week sisters Kelly and Kristi Callan), Wynn met Karl Precoda, who had answered an ad for a bass player, and the two formed a new group, with Precoda switching to guitar. Smith joined on bass and brought in drummer Dennis Duck (Mehaffey), who had played in the locally successful Pasadena-based band Human Hands.

Duck suggested the name &quot;the Dream Syndicate&quot; in reference to La Monte Young&#x27;s early 1960s New York experimental ensemble (better known as the Theatre of Eternal Music), whose members included John Cale and Tony Conrad.

On February 23, 1982, the Dream Syndicate performed its first show at Club Lingerie in Hollywood. A four-song EP was recorded at the home of Tom Mehren in Pasadena, with Paul B. Cutler engineering and producing, and released on Wynn&#x27;s Down There label. The band quickly achieved local attention for its often aggressively long, feedback-soaked improvisations. Influences on the band, which was soon deemed &quot;a seminal force in the city&#x27;s &#x27;80s underground rock evolution&quot;, were the Velvet Underground, Neil Young and Television.

The band signed to Slash Records, whose subsidiary Ruby Records released its debut and by far best-known album, &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot;, in 1982. &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; &quot;sent shockwaves through the American underground in the early 1980s,&quot; but MTV favored a different kind of music. Rough Trade Records released the album&#x27;s lead track, &quot;Tell Me When It&#x27;s Over&quot;, in early 1983 as the A-side of a UK EP which also included a live cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Soul&quot;.

Subsequently, Smith left the band and joined David Roback (formerly of Rain Parade) to form Opal. She was replaced in the Dream Syndicate by David Provost.

===Post-Kendra Smith years (1984–1989)===
&quot;Medicine Show&quot; was recorded in 1984 in San Francisco with producer Sandy Pearlman and released that year by A&amp;M Records. The band opened tours for R.E.M. and U2 and released the five-song live EP, &quot;This Is Not The New Dream Syndicate Album... Live!&quot;, the last record to feature Precoda on guitar (he left soon afterward to pursue a career in screenwriting) and the first appearance of bassist Mark Walton. The EP&#x27;s commercial failure contributed to the group&#x27;s temporary breakup. The band was dropped by A&amp;M after the label rejected its demo for &quot;Slide Away&quot;, later released on the semi-official &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late to Stop Now&quot;.

In 1985, during the band&#x27;s temporary retirement, Wynn and Dan Stuart of Green on Red wrote 10 songs together that were recorded with Duck, among others, and released by A&amp;M as the album &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; under the name Danny &amp; Dusty.

After a brief hiatus (and, as one reviewer said, having taken &quot;a trip through the major-label meat grinder&quot;), Wynn, Duck and Walton joined with Paul B. Cutler (who had produced the group&#x27;s first EP and played guitar in the proto-goth 45 Grave) to form the next version of the Dream Syndicate. They recorded two more studio albums, &quot;Out of the Grey&quot; (1986, Chrysalis Records), produced by Cutler, and &quot;Ghost Stories&quot; (1988, Enigma Records), produced by Elliot Mazer. A live album, &quot;Live at Raji&#x27;s&quot;, was recorded in 1988 (also by Mazer) before &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;, but released afterward. 1992 also featured a free release in cooperation with the band by the label Opdtapes. A free tape called &quot;Live i Bergen&quot; contained recordings from the band&#x27;s concert in Bergen, Norway on 15th of October 1988 (Opdtapes 002).

After breaking up in 1989, the band&#x27;s posthumous releases included &quot;3½ (The Lost Tapes: 1985–1988)&quot;, a collection of unreleased studio sessions, and &quot;The Day Before Wine and Roses&quot;, a live KPFK radio performance recorded just before the release of the band&#x27;s first album. Wynn continued as a solo artist, and Walton went on to play with the Continental Drifters.

===Reunion (2012–present)===
Wynn reformed the Dream Syndicate for a festival performance on September 21, 2012, at Festival BAM in Barcelona, Spain. The reformed band included Wynn, Walton, Duck and Jason Victor, Wynn&#x27;s longtime lead guitarist in the Miracle 3.

On December 5–6, 2013, the Dream Syndicate played two shows with three other reunited Paisley Underground bands — the Bangles, the Three O&#x27;Clock and Rain Parade — at the Fillmore in San Francisco on the first night, then at a benefit concert at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles the next night. On September 26–27, 2014, the Dream Syndicate played at The EARL in East Atlanta; they were the band&#x27;s first shows in the South since 1988, and included Savage Republic as the opening act. The September 26 show featured a complete performance of &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot;, while the following show featured their second album, &quot;The Medicine Show&quot;. , the group had played more than 50 shows since reuniting.

In February 2017, Wynn announced that a forthcoming fifth studio album had been recorded at Montrose Studios in Richmond, Virginia, and mixed at Water Music in Hoboken, New Jersey. The personnel included himself, Walton, Duck and Victor, joined on keyboards by Chris Cacavas. Wynn noted that the album&#x27;s final track, titled &quot;Kendra&#x27;s Dream&quot;, included vocals from Smith, the band&#x27;s original bass player, who also wrote the song&#x27;s lyrics. The album, &quot;How Did I Find Myself Here?&quot;, was released on September 8, 2017, on the Anti- label.

In November 2018, three new recordings by The Dream Syndicate were released as part of a compilation album called &quot;3 × 4&quot;, which also included The Bangles, The Three O&#x27;Clock, and Rain Parade, with each of the four bands covering songs by the other bands. Following the initial Record Store Day First release as a double album on &quot;psychedelic swirl&quot; purple vinyl, Yep Roc Records released the album on LP, CD, and digital in February 2019.

On May 10, 2019, &quot;These Times&quot;, the second album from the re-formed band, was released on Anti-. Produced by John Agnello and The Dream Syndicate, the album was again recorded at Montrose Studios in Richmond, Virginia.

On February 26, 2019, the Dream Syndicate announced that a new studio album, &quot;The Universe Inside&quot;, was to be released on April 10, 2020, on Anti-. The band shared the first “single” “The Regulator” and its video, a 20-minute “psychedelic journey through New York City, equal parts panoramic, psychedelic, somnambulistic and political”.

On February 9, 2024, The Dream Syndicate released &quot;How Did We Find Ourselves Here?&quot;. A double LP package entitled &quot;Live Through the Past Darkly&quot; included a DVD of the recent documentary &quot;How Did We Find Ourselves Here&quot; with commentary from Chris Robinson of Black Crowes, Stephen McCarthy of Long Ryders, David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and more. It chronicles the band&#x27;s journey from their beginnings, through conflicts with former friends, battles with major record labels, and disbandment, to their reunion in 2012. Exclusive to this DVD is a previously unavailable one-hour 1983 Dream Syndicate live concert, filmed at the Roxy in Los Angeles.

<text>The Rub&#x27; al Khali (; , ) or ]]Empty Quarter is a desert encompassing most of the southern third of the Arabian Peninsula. The desert covers some (the area of long. 44°30′−56°30′E, and lat. 16°30′−23°00′N) including parts of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. It is part of the larger Arabian Desert.

==Description==
===Terrain===
The desert is long, and wide. Its surface elevation varies from in the southwest to around sea level in the northeast. Most of the terrain is ergs, with sand dunes up to high, interspersed with gravel and gypsum plains. The sand is reddish-orange due to the presence of feldspar.

There are also brackish salt flats in some areas, such as the Umm al Samim area on the desert&#x27;s eastern edge. Ali Al-Naimi reports that the sand dunes do not drift. He goes on to say,

Sand blows off the surface, of course, but the essential shape of the dunes remains intact, probably due to the moisture leaching up into the base of the dunes from the surrounding sabkhas.
====Lake beds====
Along the middle length of the desert, there are several raised, hardened areas of calcium carbonate, gypsum, marl, or clay that were once the site of shallow lakes. These lakes existed during periods from 6,000 to 5,000 years ago and 3,000 to 2,000 years ago. The lakes are thought to have formed as a result of &quot;cataclysmic rainfall&quot; similar to present-day monsoon rains and most probably lasted for only a few years. However, lakes in the Mundafen area in the southwest of the Rub&#x27; al Khali show evidence of such lakes lasting longer, up to 800 years, from increased runoff from the Tuwaiq Escarpment.

Evidence suggests that the lakes were home to a variety of flora and fauna. Fossil remains indicate the presence of several animal species, such as hippopotamus, water buffalo, and long-horned cattle. The lakes also contained small snails, ostracods, and when conditions were suitable, freshwater clams. Deposits of calcium carbonate and opal phytoliths indicate the presence of plants and algae. There is also evidence of human activity dating from 3,000 to 2,000 years ago, including chipped flint tools, but no actual human remains have been found.

===Climate===
The region is classified as &quot;hyper-arid&quot;, with annual precipitation generally less than , and daily mean relative humidity of about 52% in January and 15% in June–July.

===Biodiversity===
Fauna includes arachnids (e.g. scorpions) and rodents, while plants live throughout the Empty Quarter. As an ecoregion, the Rub&#x27; al Khali falls within the Arabian Desert and East Saharo-Arabian xeric shrublands. The Asiatic cheetah, once widespread in Saudi Arabia, is extirpated.

===Oil===
The Shaybah oil field was discovered in 1968. South Ghawar, discovered in 1948, is the largest oil field in the world and extends southward into the northernmost parts of the Empty Quarter.

===Transport===
A road between Oman and Saudi Arabia, through the Empty Quarter, was completed in September 2021. Measuring between , it extends from Ibri in Oman to Al-Ahsa in eastern Saudi Arabia. A stretch of the road is on the Omani side and on the Saudi side. The road also goes through the archaeological sites of Bat, Al-Khutm and Al-Ayn in Oman.

== People ==
The inhabitants of the Empty Quarter are members of various local tribes: for example, the Al Murrah tribe has the largest area mainly based between Al-Ahsa and Najran. The Banu Yam and Banu Hamdan (in Yemen and the Najran region of southern Saudi Arabia), and the Bani Yas (in the United Arab Emirates). A few road links connect these tribal settlements to the area&#x27;s water resources and oil production centers.

==History==
Desertification has increased through recent millennia. Before desertification made the caravan trails leading across the Rub&#x27; al Khali difficult, the caravans of the frankincense trade crossed now virtually impassable stretches of land, until about 300 AD. It has been suggested that Ubar or Iram, a lost city, region or people, depended on such trade. The archaeological remains of Iram include a fortification/administration building, walls and bases of circular pillars. The traces of camel tracks, unidentifiable on the ground, appear in satellite images.

===Expeditions===
The first documented journeys by non-resident explorers were made by British explorers Bertram Thomas and St John Philby in the early 1930s. Between 1946 and 1950, Wilfred Thesiger crossed the area several times and mapped large parts of the Empty Quarter including the mountains of Oman, as described in his 1959 book &quot;Arabian Sands&quot;.

In June 1950, a US Air Force expedition crossed the Rub&#x27; al Khali from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, to central Yemen and back in trucks to collect specimens for the Smithsonian Institution and to test desert survival procedures.

In 1999, Jamie Clarke became the first Westerner to cross the Empty Quarter of Arabia in fifty years. His team of six, guided by three Bedouins, spent 40 days crossing the desert with a caravan of 13 camels.

On 25 February 2006, a scientific excursion organized by the Saudi Geological Survey began to explore the Empty Quarter. The expedition consisted of 89 environmentalists, geologists, and scientists from Saudi Arabia and abroad. Various types of fossilized creatures as well as meteorites were discovered in the desert. The expedition discovered 31 new plant species and plant varieties, as well as 24 species of birds that inhabit the region, which fascinated scientists as to how they have survived under the harsh conditions of the Empty Quarter.

In February 2013, a South African team including Alex Harris, Marco Broccardo, and David Joyce became the first people to cross the border close to Oman of the Empty Quarter unsupported and on foot, in a journey which started in Salalah and lasted 40 days, ending in Dubai. The team only made use of three water stops along the journey and pulled a specially designed cart that housed all the supplies necessary for the entire expedition.

In 2013, British adventurer Alistair Humphreys released his first documentary film, Into the Empty Quarter, documenting his walk through the Empty Quarter desert with Leon McCarron. 

In 2013, from 18 February to 28 March, South Korean explorer Young-Ho Nam led a team (Agustin Arroyo Bezanilla, Si-Woo Lee) on a crossing through the Empty Quarter on foot from Salalah, Oman, to Liwa Oasis in the UAE Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The crossing was performed with permission from the governments of Oman and UAE. Dewan Ruler&#x27;s Representative for Western Region, Emirate of Abu Dhabi recognized it as the world&#x27;s first on-foot crossing of the Empty Quarter following the border of Oman and ending in UAE.

In 2018, the first all-female walking expedition named &quot;her faces of change&quot; led by Briton Janey McGill who was accompanied by the first Omani women in modern times to walk the Oman Empty Quarter, Baida Al Zadjali and Atheer Al Sabri, set off on 22 December 2018 after receiving formal approval from the government of Oman. The team was supported by two cars for supplies driven by Tariq Al Zadjali (Omani) and Mark Vause-Jones (British) and filmmaker Matthew Milan from the United States. The expedition started from Al Hashman in the Dohafar Governate of Oman crossing through Burkana, Maqshin, and Al Sahma in Al Wusta Region continuing through Abu Al Tabool, Um Al Sameem ending at Ibri fort in the Al Dhahira region of Oman. The total distance walked by the team was in 28 days, ending the expedition on 18 January 2019.

In 2018, Deidre O&#x27;Leary and Kyle Knight crossed the Rub&#x27; al Khali from the South (the Saudi-Omani border) to the North (the Saudi-UAE border) on foot. This was the first known crossing within Saudi Arabia from south-north on foot through the highest sand dunes of the Rub Al&#x27; Khali. The pair crossed in nine days 12 hours and 59 minutes.

In 2020, Italian extreme desert explorer Max Calderan completed a Rub&#x27; al Khali exploration on foot for the first time ever from west to east. He crossed in 18 days, crossing the widest area of Rub&#x27; al Khali.
In 2023, an Austrian-German expedition completed a southwest-to-northeast crossing of the Rub-al-Khali region on the Saudi Arabian side. The route was planned by Austrian Thomas Brandl-Ruttner, leading a team of eight experts in navigation, expedition logistics, and engineering. The team included geo-archaeologist Rudolf Dellmour, who was responsible for scientific documentation. Covering a 1,500-kilometer route through largely unexplored terrain, the team gathered and documented new geological and archaeological findings. Locations that had previously only been studied via satellite imagery were explored on site for the first time.

In 2024, Richard Midwinter walked alone from Salalah, aiming to cross via Muqshin to Al Ain and on to Dubai, to raise awareness for women missed by the NHS breast cancer screening programme. He was carrying a rucksack and had no supply caches or support team. He was detained by Royal Oman Police at Abutubul, south of the Umm al Samim and interrogated under suspicion of espionage by the Internal Security Service, removed from the Rub al Khali and left to continue his journey from Qarn al Alam. He walked under observation for two more days before deciding to hitchhike out, having walked circa 800km in 29 days.

In 2025 Gavin Booth MBE and Adam Wilton MBE completed the first self-sufficient foot crossing of the Saudi Arabian Rub&#x27; al Khali, travelling circa 780km from As Sulayyil to Haradh, via Ash Shalfa in 22 days. They hauled all their food, supplies and water necessary for the journey in self built carts, without any support or resupply caches.

<text>Patriarch Alexy II (or Alexius II, ; secular name Aleksei Mikhailovich Ridiger ; 23 February 1929 – 5 December 2008) was the 15th Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus&#x27;, the primate of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Elected Patriarch of Moscow in 1990, eighteen months before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he became the first Russian Patriarch of the post-Soviet period.

==Family history==
Alexey Mikhailovich Ridiger was a patrilineal descendant of a Baltic German noble family. His father, Mikhail Aleksandrovich Ridiger (1900–1960), was a descendant of Captain Heinrich Nikolaus (Nils) Rüdinger, commander of a Swedish fortification in Daugavgrīva, Swedish Livonia and knighted by Charles XI of Sweden in 1695. 
Swedish Estonia and Swedish Livonia became part of the Russian Empire in the aftermath of the Great Northern War, in the beginning of the 18th century. 
Friedrich Wilhelm von Rüdiger (1780–1840), adopted Orthodox Christianity during the reign of Catherine the Great.
From the marriage with a Polish woman, Sophie Dorothea Jerzębska, was born the future Patriarch&#x27;s great-grandfather, Yegor (Georgi) von Rüdiger (1811–1848).

After the October Revolution of 1917, Alexey Ridiger&#x27;s father Mikhail became a refugee and the family settled in Estonia, first in Haapsalu where a shelter was provided by priest Ralph von zur Mühlen. Later Mikhail moved to Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, where he met and married in 1928 to Yelena Iosifovna Pisareva (1902–1955), who was born and later died there.
Alexey Ridiger&#x27;s father graduated from the theological seminary in Tallinn in 1940 and was ordained a deacon and later a priest and served as the rector of the Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God in Tallinn. Later, he was a member and the chairman of the Diocesan Council in Estonia.

Patrilineal family tree

==Biography==
===Early life===
Alexey Ridiger (born Aleksei Rüdiger) was born and spent his childhood in the Republic of Estonia that had become a Russian Orthodox spiritual center and a home to many Russian émigrés after the Russian October Revolution in 1917. He was baptised into the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church.
From his early childhood Alexey Ridiger served in the Orthodox Church under the guidance of his spiritual father, Archpriest Ioann Bogoyavlensky. He attended Tallinn&#x27;s Russian Gymnasium.

After the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940, Alexey&#x27;s family was listed for arrest in order to be deported from Estonia according to the Serov Instructions, but were not found by the NKVD because instead of staying in their home they were hiding in a nearby hovel.

During the occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany (1941–1944) Alexey with his father Mikhail, who had become an Orthodox priest on 20 December 1942, visited the Soviet prisoners of war in German prison camps in Estonia. Such activity was tolerated by the German occupational authorities because it was seen as effective anti-Soviet propaganda. After Soviet forces returned to Estonia in the autumn of 1944, unlike most of the people with Baltic German roots, the Ridiger (Rüdiger) family chose to stay in Estonia instead of evacuating to the West.

During the war Joseph Stalin had revived the Russian Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union. Having been closed during the war time, after the Soviet annexation of Estonia the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Tallinn was reopened in 1945. Alexey Ridiger, who had become a Soviet citizen served as an altar boy in the cathedral from May to October 1946. He was made a psalm-reader in St. Simeon&#x27;s Church later that year; in 1947, he officiated in the same office in the Church of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God in Tallinn.

===Ordination and priesthood===
He entered the Leningrad Theological Seminary in 1947, and graduated in 1949. He then entered the Leningrad Theological Academy, and graduated in 1953.

On 15 April 1950, he was ordained a deacon by Metropolitan Gregory (Chukov) of Leningrad, and on 17 April 1950, he was ordained a priest and appointed rector of the Theophany church in city of Jõhvi, Estonia, in the Tallinn Diocese. On 15 July 1957, Fr. Alexy was appointed Rector of the Cathedral of the Dormition in Tallinn and Dean of the Tartu district. He was elevated to the rank of Archpriest on 17 August 1958, and on 30 March 1959 he was appointed Dean of the united Tartu-Viljandi deanery of the Tallinn diocese. On 3 March 1961 he was tonsured a monk in the Trinity Cathedral of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius.

His name (secular Алексей, clerical Алексий) was not changed when he became a monk, but his patron saint changed from Alexius of Rome to Alexius, Metropolitan of Kiev whose relics repose in the Theophany Cathedral in Moscow.

===Tenure as bishop===
On 14 August 1961, he was chosen to be the Orthodox Church Bishop of Tallinn and Estonia, succeeding his father-in-law, John (Alekseev), who was promoted to Archbishop of Gorky and Arzamas. 
On 23 June 1964, he was elevated to the rank of archbishop. On December 22, 1964, he was appointed Chancellor of the Moscow Patriarchate and, ex officio, a permanent member of the Holy Synod. On 25 February 1968, when he just turned 40 years old, he was elevated to metropolitan.

In 1986 he was released from the post of the Chancellor, which he had held since 1961 and which allowed him to be based in the Moscow Patriarchy&#x27;s headquarters, and transferred to Leningrad; the decision was effectively made by the Council for Religious Affairs and was later presented by Alexy as punishment for his letter in December 1985 to Mikhail Gorbachev with proposals of reforms to church-state relations. Shortly after Alexy&#x27;s death, the then Chairman of the Council Kharchev strongly denied that and said the decision was aimed at &quot;defusing the tense emotional atmosphere within Patriarch Pimen&#x27;s inner circle&quot;. In an earlier interview Kharchev suggested the removal had been requested by Patriarch Pimen &quot;for a year&quot;.

Alexy was one of the presidents of the Conference of European Churches from 1964. In March 1987 he was elected President of the CEC Presidium and Advisory Committee, in which post he remained until November 1990. 
Criticized for Ecumenism by some within the Russian Orthodox Church, Alexy responded by saying that such were opinions expressed not by representatives of the church but expressed as private views of free citizens.

====KGB====

There have been reports, beginning in the 1990s, that Patriarch Alexy II had been a KGB agent. 
These reports originate with Gleb Yakunin, a member of the committee created for the investigation of the Soviet coup attempt of 1991 and chaired by Lev Ponomaryov, who thereby gained the access to secret KGB archives. In March 1992 he published materials alleging cooperation between the Moscow Patriarchate and the KGB. He published code names of several KGB agents who held high-rank positions in the Russian Orthodox Church including Patriarch Alexius II. The Russian church defrocked Yakunin in 1993. The allegation was repeated by Yevgenia Albats in 1994.
Western media reported on these allegations in 1999 and again in 2007/8.
The Patriarch was also named as a &quot;KGB collaborator&quot; in a 2015 interview with defected former KGB general and suspected double agent Oleg Kalugin.

It is alleged that the Estonian branch of the KGB recruited Alexy as an agent on 28 February 1958, just days after his 29th birthday, assigning him the codename &quot;Drozdov&quot; (he had completed his dissertation on Metropolitan Filaret Drozdov). The report detailing his recruitment makes clear that the KGB contacted Alexy, then still a simple priest, because they expected him to succeed John (Alekseev) as Bishop of the Russian Orthodox diocese of Tallinn and Estonia (and he was in fact appointed to this post less than three years later). Among his KGB assignments was one in 1983, when he was sent to the Pskov-Caves Monastery to &quot;pacify&quot; rebellious monks.

The reports further allege that Alexander Grigoryev, a KGB officer in Leningrad under cover as Orthodox priest Fr Alexander was his case officer for a while. According to Oleg Gordievsky, Alexy II worked for the KGB for forty years, and his case officer was Nikolai Patrushev.
In February 1988, exactly 30 years after his recruitment, the KGB chairman awarded him the Certificate of Honour.

Patriarch Alexy II acknowledged that compromises were made with the Soviet government by bishops of the Moscow Patriarchate, himself included, and publicly repented of these compromises:
:&quot;Defending one thing, it was necessary to give somewhere else. Were there any other organizations, or any other people among those who had to carry responsibility not only for themselves but for thousands of other fates, who in those years in the Soviet Union were not compelled to act likewise? Before those people, however, to whom the compromises, silence, forced passivity or expressions of loyalty permitted by the leaders of the church in those years caused pain, before these people, and not only before God, I ask forgiveness, understanding and prayers.&quot;
At the same time, the Patriarch has called the reports making him out to be &quot;KGB agent&quot; mere exaggerations of such necessary compromises he had to make with the Soviet authorities. 
Similarly, the official spokesman for the Moscow Patriarchy, Father Vsevolod Chaplin, in 2000 claimed that reports of Patriarch Alexy II being an &quot;associate of the special services&quot; are &quot;absolutely unsubstantiated&quot;.

Albats (1994) cites Konstantin Kharchev, former chairman of the Soviet Council for Religious Affairs, as saying: &quot;Not a single candidate for the office of bishop or any other high-ranking office, much less a member of Holy Synod, went through without confirmation by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the KGB&quot;.

In summary, a degree of &quot;collaboration&quot; with the Soviet authorities was necessary for all bishops. Whether such collaboration represents a necessary &quot;compromise&quot; or suffices to qualify the bishops as &quot;KGB agents&quot; appears to be a matter of interpretation. According to Davis (1995), &quot;If the bishops wished to defend their people and survive in office, they had to collaborate to some degree with the KGB, with the commissioners of the Council for Religious Affairs, and with other party and governmental authorities.&quot;
When asked by the Russian press about claims that he was a &quot;compliant&quot; bishop, &quot;Aleksi defended his record, noting that while he was bishop of Tallinn in 1961, he resisted the communist authorities&#x27; efforts to make the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in the city a planetarium (which, in truth, they did do elsewhere in the Baltic states) and to convert the Pühtitsa Dormition nunnery to a rest home for miners.&quot; 
Official records do show that during Patriarch Alexy&#x27;s tenure as bishop, the Tallinn diocese had a lower number of forced Church closings than was typical in the rest of the USSR. 
In the judgement of Ware (1997), &quot;Opinions differ over the past collaboration or otherwise between the Communist authorities, but on the whole he is thought to have shown firmness and independence in his dealings as a diocesan bishop with the Soviet State.&quot;

===Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus&#x27;===
After the death of Patriarch Pimen in 1990, Alexy was chosen to become the new Patriarch of The Russian Orthodox Church. He was chosen on Local Council on the basis of his administrative experience, and was considered &quot;intelligent, energetic, hardworking, systematic, perceptive, and businesslike.&quot; He also &quot;had a reputation as a conciliator, a person who could find common ground with various groups in the episcopate.&quot; Archbishop Chrysostom (Martishkin) remarked &quot;With his peaceful and tolerant disposition Patriarch Aleksi will be able to unite us all.&quot;

Patriarch Alexy II was &quot;the first patriarch in Soviet history to be chosen without government pressure; candidates were nominated from the floor, and the election was conducted by secret ballot.&quot;

Upon taking on the role of Patriarch, Patriarch Alexy II became a vocal advocate of the rights of the church, calling for the Soviet government to allow religious education in the state schools and for a &quot;freedom of conscience&quot; law.

During the attempted coup in August 1991, he denounced the arrest of Mikhail Gorbachev, and anathematized the plotters. He publicly questioned the junta&#x27;s legitimacy, called for restraint by the military, and demanded that Gorbachev be allowed to address the people. He issued a second appeal against violence and fratricide, which was amplified over loudspeakers to the troops outside the Russian &quot;White House&quot; half an hour before they attacked. Ultimately, the coup failed, which eventually resulted in the breakup of the Soviet Union.

During Alexy II&#x27;s first official visit to Germany in 1995, the Patriarch publicly apologized for the &quot;Communist tyranny that had been imposed upon the German nation by the USSR&quot;. The apology resulted in accusations by Russian Communists and the Russian National Bolshevik Party of insulting the Russian nation and treason.

In July 1998 Alexy II decided not to officiate in the Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg at the burial of the royal family executed by the Bolsheviks in 1918, a ceremony attended by president Boris Yeltsin, citing doubts about the authenticity of the remains.

Under his leadership, the New Martyrs and Confessors of Russia who suffered under Communism were glorified, beginning with the Grand Duchess Elizabeth, Metropolitan Vladimir, and Metropolitan Benjamin (Kazansky) of Petrograd in 1992.

In 2000, after much debate, the All-Russian Council glorified Tsar Nicholas II and his family (see Romanov sainthood), as well as many other New Martyrs. 
More names continue to be added to list of New Martyrs, after the Synodal Canonization Commission completes its investigation of each case.

Alexy II had complicated relations with Pope John Paul II and the Roman Catholic Church. He had a dispute with Rome over the property rights of the Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches in Ukraine, which had emerged from Soviet control after the Gorbachev&#x27;s liberalisation of Russia. He nevertheless had good relations with Latin Catholics in France and was friends with Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, who invited him to the country shortly before his death.
Patriarch Alexy II repeatedly affirmed the traditional stand of the Orthodox Church and opposed the display of homosexuality in Russia, and in particular, opposed gay parades in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Church, according to the Patriarch, &quot;has invariably supported the institution of the family and condemns untraditional relations, seeing them as a vicious deviation from God-given human nature&quot;. 
He also said, &quot;I am convinced that gays&#x27; desire to organize a parade in Moscow will not help strengthen the family as the foundation of a strong state&quot;. He also said that homosexuality is an illness, and a distortion of the human personality like kleptomania.
Patriarch Alexy II has also issued statements condemning anti-Semitism.
In February 2007 a controversy erupted when Diomid, Bishop of Chukotka, condemned the ROC&#x27;s hierarchy and personally Patriarch Alexy II for ecumenism, supporting democracy and misguided loyalty to the Russian secular authorities. Bishop Diomid also took the position that taxpayer IDs, cell phones, passports, vaccination and globalisation were tools of the antichrist, and that the leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church have &quot;departed from the purity of the Orthodoxal dogma&quot; in its support of the Russian government and of democracy, as well as its ecumenism with other confessions. After a decision of the All-Russian Council, and Bishop Diomid&#x27;s refusal to appear, he was defrocked in July 2008,

In 2007, Patriarch Alexy II oversaw the reunification of the Moscow Patriarchate with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR). The Act of Canonical Communion was signed on 17 May 2007. The ROCOR had been established in the early 1920s by Russian bishops forced into exile after the Russian Civil War, and was highly critical of the Moscow Patriarchate&#x27;s loyalty to the Bolshevik regime after Stalin&#x27;s revival of the church in 1943 in an attempt to intensify the patriotic war effort.
Shortly before the signing of the Act of Canonical Communion, there were some reports in Russian media claiming that Patriarch Alexy II was in critical condition or even dead.
This was soon revealed as a hoax, apparently designed to disrupt the reunification of the two branches.

===Personal life===

On 11 April 1950, he married Vera Alekseeva, daughter of Georgi Alekseev, who would serve as bishop John of Tallinn from 1955 to 1961. 
The wedding took place on the Tuesday of Bright Week when marriages are normally prohibited according to Church tradition; however, permission was granted by Metropolitan Gregory of Leningrad, at the request of Bishop Roman of Tallinn and the fathers of both the bride and groom (both of whom were priests, and who concelebrated the marriage together). Moskovskiye Novosti has alleged that according to a denunciation written by a priest-inspector Pariysky to the Leningrad Council of Religious Affairs, the marriage had been expedited in order for Ridiger to become a deacon and avoid being drafted into the Soviet Military (marriage is impossible after ordination in Orthodoxy). Up until 1950, seminarians were given a deferment from the draft, but in 1950 this was changed, and only clergy were exempt. For reasons which have remained private, they divorced less than a year later.

The Patriarch&#x27;s private residence was located in the village of Lukino (near Peredelkino), now a western suburb of Moscow; it includes a 17th-century church, a museum, and a spacious three-storey house built in the late 1990s. According to the Patriarch&#x27;s May 2005 interview on the residence&#x27;s compound, nuns drawn from the Pühtitsa Convent take care of all the household chores.

There was also a working residence in central Moscow—a 19th-century town mansion, which had been turned over to the Patriarchate by Stalin&#x27;s order in September 1943. Both residences acted as living quarters and Patriarch&#x27;s office at the same time. He commuted in an armored car and was under the protection of federal agents (FSO) since January 2000.

The formal residence (infrequently used for some official functions) is located in the Moscow Danilov Monastery – a two-storey Soviet building erected in the 1980s.

===Death and burial===

Alexy II died at his home at his Peredelkino residence on 5 December 2008, reportedly of heart failure.
He died 80 days short of his 80th birthday (23 February 1929 – 5 December 2008), being just one single day older at death than his predecessor, Pimen (Izvekov), who had died 81 days short of his 80th birthday (23 July 1910 – 3 May 1990).

On 7 December 2008, Russian President Medvedev issued a decree which &quot;enjoined&quot; that on the day of the Patriarch&#x27;s burial Russia&#x27;s cultural establishments and broadcasters should cancel entertaining programs and assistance be furnished to the Patriarchate on the part of the federal and city governments for organization of the burial. However, the order did not amount to a formal national mourning.

On 9 December 2008, the Order for the Burial (funeral service) of the deceased Patriarch was presided over by the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, whereafter he was interred in the southern chapel of the Epiphany Cathedral at Elokhovo in Moscow.

During the service in the Christ the Saviour Cathedral, which was broadcast live by Russia&#x27;s state TV channels, after Kathisma XVII had been chanted and Metropolitan Kirill set about doing the incensing round the coffin, he appeared to teeter and, being propped up by two bishops, was ushered into the sanctuary and was absent for about an hour. Reuters reported: &quot;Kirill was helped away by aides at one point and a Kremlin official said he had apparently fainted. The metropolitan later rejoined the funeral.&quot; The ROC official spokesman Vsevolod Chaplin lashed out at the news media that had reported the incident &quot;incorrectly&quot; insisting that Kirill had not fainted, but merely had &quot;felt unwell&quot;.
The following is a selection of quotes from notable obituaries:
* Russian Prime-minister Vladimir Putin: &quot;Patriarch Alexy II had been a prominent figure in the history of the Russian Orthodox Church, as well as a great &lt;...&gt; he made a very considerable contribution to relations between various faiths. It would not be an exaggeration to say that he had friendly relations with representatives of all traditional faiths in Russia&quot;. Putin also acknowledged that Alexy II &quot;did a great deal to help establish a new governance system in Russia&quot;.
* Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of Estonia: &quot;I will always remember Alexius II as an especially wise man who was respected by people from the religious and secular worlds alike.&quot;
* The BBC published an anonymous obituary entitled &quot;Double life of Russia&#x27;s patriarch&quot;: &quot;Patriarch Alexy II had an extraordinary career, in which he switched from suppressing the Russian Orthodox Church to being its champion. A favourite of the KGB, he was promoted rapidly through the Church hierarchy, doing the Kremlin&#x27;s bidding at a time when dissident priests were thrown into jail. As the Church&#x27;s effective foreign minister, he helped cover up the repression of Russian Christians, defending the Soviet system to the outside world. He rose quickly through the ranks, being elected head of the Russian Orthodox Church at a crucial time, in 1990, with the Soviet Union on the path to collapse. Surprisingly, perhaps, he seized the moment, and went on to oversee the revival and flowering of the Church.&quot;
* Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a leader in the American Jewish community, was asked by church officials to attend the Patriarch&#x27;s funeral. In a statement, he stated that Alexy II &quot;served as the ethical pulse of the religious community in the former Soviet Union under a regime that neither welcomed nor tolerated people of faith and the leaders of organized religion.&quot;

<text>Repulse Bay or Tsin Shui Wan is a bay in the southern part of Hong Kong Island, located in the Southern District, Hong Kong. It is one of the most expensive residential areas in the world.

==Geography==
Repulse Bay is located in the southern part of Hong Kong Island, to the east of Deep Water Bay and to the west of Middle Bay and South Bay. Middle Island is located off Hong Kong Island, between Repulse Bay and Deep Water Bay.

==History==

The origins of the bay&#x27;s English name have become extremely obscure. There are, however, many stories — none resting on any solid evidence that has so far been established. A typical example is that in 1841, the bay was used as a base by pirates and caused serious concern to foreign merchant ships trading with China. The pirates were subsequently repulsed by the Royal Navy, hence the name. There is no evidence of any such origin in the extensive British naval log books of the period. Another story holds that the bay was named after HMS &quot;Repulse&quot;, which was stationed at the bay at one point. No HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; ever visited Hong Kong, let alone Repulse Bay and the 1868 &quot;Repulse&quot; served only on the west coast of the Americas (1872–77) and thereafter in British waters. It is known that the name appeared on the earliest British official map of Hong Kong by Lt TB Collinson RE in 1845. However, British Admiralty charts never used the name until the 20th century, instead sticking to the quite erroneous name given by Commander Edward Belcher RN in his 1841 survey, Chonghom Bay. The source of the name remains unknown.

In 1898, the Hong Kong Golf Club opened in the valley behind the Deep Water Bay and became a social hub. Roads were developed between the South and the North parts of Hong Kong Island and in the 1910s, Repulse Bay was developed into a beach. The Repulse Bay Hotel was built by the Kadoorie family in 1920. To attract swimmers, a bus route from Central to Repulse Bay was created, and now stands as one of Hong Kong&#x27;s oldest bus routes. The writer Ernest Hemingway and the American actor Marlon Brando stayed at the Repulse Bay Hotel.

During the Battle of Hong Kong in World War II, Repulse Bay was an important strategic location. The Repulse Bay Hotel was used by the Japanese as a military hospital during the war.

The beach was extended artificially, and thus the sand closer to the shore is coarser in texture than the sand further away. It is one of the longest beaches in Hong Kong with a length of 292 metres (960 feet).

American actors William Holden and Jennifer Jones stayed at the Repulse Bay Hotel in 1955 when they acted there in the film &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing.&quot;

Until the early 1960s, residential buildings were quite restricted. Three blocks of six storey apartments were developed by Dr. P. P. (Put-Paw) Chiu and his brother P. W. (Put-Wai) Chiu, part way up the mountain overlooking Repulse Bay. These were luxury apartments with servants&#x27; quarters, with only two apartments per floor in Blocks A and B. Apartments in Block C are smaller. For a long time, these were the only apartments allowed on the mountain.

These included properties on Repulse Bay Road and South Bay Road, according to a record of projects by architect Luke Him Sau — the earliest of which (among the Chiu properties) dates back to 1952. 

Occupying the whole of the west side cliff above the beach was a large castle with a swimming pool, greenhouse and tennis court called Eucliffe, one of three castles owned by the millionaire Eu Tong Sen. The Eucliffe structure and historical site was demolished to make way for a row of low apartments.

==Present==
The Repulse Bay area is one of the most expensive housing areas in Hong Kong. Tencent&#x27;s CEO Pony Ma bought a house there for US$57 million in 2014. In 2018, twin townhouses were sold for HK$1 billion (US$127 million) or about . In 2018, Li Ka-shing, the richest man in Hong Kong, was living near Repulse Bay.

The former Repulse Bay Hotel was demolished in two stages during the 1970s and 1980s. Later a boutique shopping mall was constructed on part of the old hotel site to mimic some of the lost colonial architecture.

Emperor International Holdings Limited bought Lido Mall at Repulse Bay and renamed it The Pulse, but due to its expansion to five storeys and , it was in negotiations with the government over the land premium. On 15 May 2012, Emperor announced an agreement with the government with the land premium at HK$798 million. Emperor would put The Pulse up for lease after receiving the occupation permit. The , five-storey shopping mall would be rented out at HK$50 to HK$60 per square foot. The Pulse was opened in 2016.

==Features==
* Repulse Bay Beach
* Kwun Yam Shrine
* The Repulse Bay

==Transport==
===Road===
Repulse Bay is served by Repulse Bay Road, which connects Wong Nai Chung Gap Road and Tai Tam Road. It is very convenient for people to travel to Repulse Bay as there are many bus routes reaching the bay. Visitors can take bus no. 6, 6A, 6X, 66 or 260 from Central, 63, 65 from Causeway Bay and North Point, or 73 from Cyberport and Aberdeen. Minibus 40, 52 are also available for visitors travelling from Causeway Bay and Aberdeen respectively. Transportation either passes through the Aberdeen Tunnel, or travels along the slightly longer scenic route.

Beach-goers may also opt to drive there. The beach provides some parking space, and the nearby Repulse Bay Hotel also has parking facilities.

===Railway===
There are no MTR stations in Repulse Bay, nor has any MTR project been proposed or commenced there.

==Education==
Repulse Bay is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 18. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and Hong Kong Southern District Government
Primary School.

==Cultural references==
Author Eileen Chang&#x27;s novel, &quot;Love in a Fallen City&quot; (傾城之戀) is set at the Repulse Bay Hotel.

<doc id="304999" wikidata="Q851503" url="?curid=304999" title="Riccati equation">
<text>In mathematics, a Riccati equation in the narrowest sense is any first-order ordinary differential equation that is quadratic in the unknown function. In other words, it is an equation of the form
formula_1
where formula_2 and formula_3. If formula_4 the equation reduces to a Bernoulli equation, while if formula_5 the equation becomes a first order linear ordinary differential equation.

The equation is named after Jacopo Riccati (1676–1754).

More generally, the term Riccati equation is used to refer to matrix equations with an analogous quadratic term, which occur in both continuous-time and discrete-time linear-quadratic-Gaussian control. The steady-state (non-dynamic) version of these is referred to as the algebraic Riccati equation.

== Conversion to a second order linear equation ==

The non-linear Riccati equation can always be converted to a second order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):
If
formula_6
then, wherever is non-zero and differentiable, formula_7 satisfies a Riccati equation of the form
formula_8
where formula_9 and formula_10 because
formula_11
Substituting formula_12 it follows that satisfies the linear second-order ODE
formula_13
since
formula_14
so that
formula_15
and hence
formula_16

Then substituting the two solutions of this linear second order equation into the transformation 
formula_17 
suffices to have global knowledge of the general solution of the Riccati equation by the formula:
formula_18 

== Complex analysis ==
In complex analysis, the Riccati equation occurs as the first-order nonlinear ODE in the complex plane of the form
formula_19
where formula_20 and formula_21 are polynomials in formula_22 and locally analytic functions of formula_23, i.e., formula_24 is a complex rational function. The only equation of this form that is of Painlevé type, is the Riccati equation
formula_25
where formula_26 are (possibly matrix) functions of formula_27. 

=== Application to the Schwarzian equation ===
An important application of the Riccati equation is to the 3rd order Schwarzian differential equation
formula_28
which occurs in the theory of conformal mapping and univalent functions. In this case the ODEs are in the complex domain and differentiation is with respect to a complex variable. (The Schwarzian derivative has the remarkable property that it is invariant under Möbius transformations, i.e. formula_29 whenever formula_30 is non-zero.) The function formula_31
satisfies the Riccati equation
formula_32
By the above formula_33 where is a solution of the linear ODE
formula_34
Since formula_35 integration gives formula_36
for some constant . On the other hand any other independent solution of the linear ODE
has constant non-zero Wronskian formula_37 which can be taken to be after scaling.
Thus
formula_38
so that the Schwarzian equation has solution formula_39

== Obtaining solutions by quadrature ==

The correspondence between Riccati equations and second-order linear ODEs has other consequences. For example, if one solution of a 2nd order ODE is known, then it is known that another solution can be obtained by quadrature, i.e., a simple integration. The same holds true for the Riccati equation. In fact, if one particular solution can be found, the general solution is obtained as
formula_40
Substituting
formula_41
in the Riccati equation yields
formula_42
and since
formula_43
it follows that
formula_44
or
formula_45
which is a Bernoulli equation. The substitution that is needed to solve this Bernoulli equation is
formula_46
Substituting
formula_47
directly into the Riccati equation yields the linear equation
formula_48
A set of solutions to the Riccati equation is then given by
formula_47
where is the general solution to the aforementioned linear equation.

<text>The following lists events that happened during [[1926]] in [[Afghanistan]].

==Incumbents==
* Monarch – Amanullah Khan

==Events==

* Afghanistan suffers during the year from the effects of the great Khost rebellion of the previous year, and little, if any, progress is made in developing the country.
* June 9 - As the Kingdom of Afghanistan succeeded the Emirate of Afghanistan, Amanullah Khan changes his title from &quot;amir&quot; to &quot;padshah&quot; (&quot;king&quot;)
* August 31 - A treaty of neutrality and mutual nonaggression between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union is concluded. The first clause in the treaty provides for &quot;neutrality in the event of an armed conflict between either of the parties with a third power&quot;, while in another clause each party agrees &quot;not to permit in its territory the activities of elements having for their object hostile action against the other party to the treaty&quot;. This treaty is the beginning for Afghanistan of closer relations with Russia, and is followed by a &quot;treaty of friendship&quot; concluded on September 14, and by negotiations for an Afghan-Soviet trade agreement. These steps do not improve Afghanistan&#x27;s relations with the Indian government, which is already looking with suspicion on some of its military activities; so much so that in August, Mr. Yunus, the secretary of the Afghan legation in London, thought it necessary to send a communication to &quot;The Times&quot; stating that the number of Afghanistan&#x27;s aeroplanes was too small to cause any apprehension, and that the Russians engaged in the air service were employed as pilots or mechanics in the same way as any other Europeans.
* The Swedish citizen Aurora Nilsson arrives with her Afghan spouse Asim Khan, becomes a royal adviser to the queen and arouses a lot of attention in contemporary Kabul.

<doc id="305002" wikidata="Q1541779" url="?curid=305002" title="County of Osona">
<text>The County of Osona, also Ausona (, ; ), was one of the Catalan counties of the &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot; in the Early and High Middle Ages. It was based around the capital city of Vic (&quot;Vicus&quot;) and the corresponding diocese, whose territory was roughly the current &quot;comarca&quot; of Osona. 

The ancient diocese of Osona was sacked by the Arabs in the mid eighth century (c. 750–755). Its reconquest by Christian powers began in 798; in that year Louis of Aquitaine ordered a Goth Borrell to enter the abandoned region and repair the castles of Vic, Cardona, and Casserès. Vic was in Frankish hands by 799. After the successful siege of Barcelona in 801, Borrell, already Count of Cerdanya and Urgell, received Osona as a countship from his liege lord, King Louis. On Borrell&#x27;s death, Osona was granted to the Frankish Count of Barcelona, Rampon. After the rebellion of 826, during which Guillemó and Aissó succeeded in taking it with help from the Emirate of Córdoba, Osona remained depopulated and outside of Frankish control until 879. It was considered to be part of the County of Barcelona throughout that period. 

In 879, Wilfred the Hairy began the repopulation of the county with free &quot;minores&quot;, who cultivated the lands given them as &quot;aprisiones&quot;; they turned Osona into a central and important part of Catalonia. There was a viscounty of Osona from 900. The viscounts controlled the region on behalf of the counts, who were usually resident in Barcelona. The viscountship later changed its name to viscounty of Cabrera. Wilfred, who established the viscounty, also built new castles along the frontier of Osona, at Torelló (881), Montgrony (887), and Tarabaldi (892). All these fortresses were controlled either directly by the count or by a castellan who also controlled the &quot;appendici&quot; or surrounding territory on certain specific terms. The castle, in fact, and its &quot;mandamenta&quot; (commandment) were the central organising feature of Osona after its repopulation. Wilfred also reorganised the church in Osona — after the bishopric, Wilfred&#x27;s foundation of the convent of Sant Joan de les Abadesses, originally under his daughter Emma, was the most important ecclesiastical institution in the county — and introduced serfdom on a limited scale. 

Throughout the tenth century, Osona remained tied to Barcelona, except for the brief rule of Ermengol from 939 to 943. In 990, the small &quot;pagus&quot; of Berga was detached from it and granted to Cerdanya. In 1035, Osona was detached from Barcelona for another brief period when Berenguer Ramon I left it to his widow, Guisla de Lluça, on his death. She ruled it with her son William until she remarried and he renounced it. After that, it was reattached to Barcelona, but was augmented by the addition of the County of Manresa, which was subsumed within Osona and ceased to be a distinct polity in the region.. 

Ramon Berenguer III ceded the county to his son-in-law Bernard III of Besalú, as dowry of his daughter Jimena in 1107. When both Jimena and Bernard died without heirs, Osona returned to Barcelona. This was to be the end for Osona as a nominally distinct county; the use of the terms &quot;county&quot; and &quot;count&quot; of Osona disappeared subsequently. From that point, its history was linked to the Principality of Catalonia. The title was revived for the Cabrera family in 1356 and it passed to the House of Montcada in 1574 and the Medinaceli in 1722, but none of these families ever controlled the feudal region.

<doc id="305003" wikidata="Q311298" url="?curid=305003" title="Kim Collins">
<text>Kim Collins (born 5 April 1976) is a former Kittitian track and field sprinter. In 2003, he became the World Champion in the 100 metres. He represented his country at the Summer Olympics on five occasions, from 1996 to 2016, and was the country&#x27;s first athlete to reach an Olympic final. He competed at ten editions of the World Championships in Athletics, from 1995 to 2015, winning five medals. He was a twice runner-up in the 60 metres at the IAAF World Indoor Championships (2003, 2008). At regional level, he was a gold medallist at the Commonwealth Games and a silver medallist at the Pan American Games. As of 2023, he is the only individual world champion from Saint Kitts and Nevis.

Collins holds a personal best of 9.93 seconds for the 100 m, which is a Saint Kitts and Nevis national record and a M40 world record for men over 40. This makes him the only man over forty years of age to break the 10-second barrier. His indoor personal best of 6.47 seconds for the 60 m is a national record and a M35 world record.

Collins was the bronze medallist over 200 m at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics and became the 100 m champion at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. He won a silver medal over 60 metres at the 2003 IAAF World Indoor Championships, before going on to take his outdoor crown. He also won sprint medals at the 2005 World Championships, 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships and 2011 World Championships. A dispute with the Saint Kitts and Nevis administrators saw Collins dropped from the 2012 Olympic Games and he did not return to international duty until 2015.

==Biography==
Collins competed in college for Texas Christian University. He competed on behalf of his country in the 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2016 Summer Olympics.

Collins made his debut at major championship at the 1996 Olympics, where he qualified for the second round in the 100 m. He improved quickly, and at the 2000 Summer Olympics, he became the first athlete from his nation to qualify for an Olympic final, finishing 7th in the 100 m. The next year, Collins would win St. Kitts&#x27; first World Championship medal, when he tied for the bronze medal in the 200 m.

At the 2002 Commonwealth Games, he won his first major title. After the 100 m race, which Collins won after two other favourites pulled out of the final with injuries, he failed a doping test, testing positive for the beta agonist Salbutamol. However, it was found that the banned substance was part of the asthma medication Collins had been taking for several years, but had neglected to mention to the medical commission. Collins eventually was allowed to keep his title, and got away with a warning.

Collins was featured on a set of two stamps from St Kitts issued in 2002.

The 100 m at the 2003 World Championships became the biggest triumph of his career. With Olympic and World Champion Maurice Greene eliminated in the semi-finals, the field was wide open. In a very close race, where the top four athletes finished within 0.02 seconds, Collins won and became the first world champion from Saint Kitts and Nevis.
At the 2004 Olympics, Collins again made the final of the 100, finishing 6th. At the 2005 World Championships, Collins claimed a bronze medal in the 100 m behind Justin Gatlin and Michael Frater though he was given the same time as the latter.

Finishing fourth in his heat, Collins qualified for the finals in the men&#x27;s 200 m race in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and finished in sixth place on 20 August 2008. He competed at the 2009 World Championships and reached the quarter-finals of the competition, but he was eliminated after finishing in fourth place behind eventual finalists Asafa Powell, Darvis Patton and Marc Burns. He announced his retirement from international athletics in September that year, bringing an end to a career that spanned almost 17 years.

Collins returned to athletics on 29 January 2011 at the Aviva International Match in Glasgow, reversing his retirement at the age of 34, and he finished fourth in the 200 metres. He then won at the Russian Winter Meeting in Moscow. He set a 60 m personal best and national record of 6.52 seconds to win at the PSD Bank Meeting in Düsseldorf, overhauling his best mark which he had set nearly eleven years earlier. That time did not stand for as long, however, as he ran 6.50 seconds in the heats of the BW-Bank Meeting a few days later. Collins won both his heat and semi-final races in the 100m at the 2011 World Championships before finishing third and winning a bronze medal in the final after the disqualification of Usain Bolt. At the men&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay qualifying heats, Collins ran the second leg for the St Kitts and Nevis relay squad and helped clock a national record of 38.47, leading to St. Kitts and Nevis&#x27; first-ever final. The last event saw Collins team up with Jason Rogers, Antoine Adams and Brijesh Lawrence to clock 38.49 to win the bronze medal.

At the XVI PanAmerican Games in Guadalajara 2011, Collins broke the 28-year-old PanAmerican Games record with a time of 10.00 in the early heat. He finished second in the finals to Jamaica&#x27;s Lerone Clarke. His silver medal was the first-ever medal for St. Kitts and Nevis at the Pan-Am Games.

Collins was expelled by his team from the 2012 Summer Olympics in London on 4 August 2012 for missing training sessions. He said he was being punished for spending time with his wife.

Collins was the oldest sprinter at 2016 Summer Olympics, his fifth consecutive appearance at the Olympics. While most sprinters peak in their 20s, Collins set his personal record after reaching the age of 40, and became the first individual to run a sub-10 second 100 m dash in the process. He ran a 9.93 100 m dash, which was fast enough to qualify for Rio. He competed in both the 100 m sprint and 4 × 100 m relay. Collins was the only St. Kitts and Nevis athlete to make it out of the first round. He finished his heat with a time of 10.18 and fourth place. He improved his time in the semifinals, finishing with a time of 10.12. This put him in sixth place and he did not advance to the finals.

In 2018 Collins announced his retirement, he competed at the 60m at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships. His last performance at a World Championship.

25 August was declared Kim Collins Day by the government of St. Kitts and Nevis in honour of Collins’ gold at the World Championships in Paris, France in 2003.

<text>Rahul Rajiv Gandhi (; born 19 June 1970) is an Indian politician. A member of the Indian National Congress (INC), he is currently serving as the 12th leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha and as the member of the Lok Sabha for Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, since June 2024. He previously represented the constituency of Wayanad, Kerala, from 2019 to 2024, and Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, from 2004 to 2019. Gandhi served as the party president of the Indian National Congress from December 2017 to July 2019. 

A member of the Nehru–Gandhi political family, he spent his early years between Delhi and Dehradun, remaining largely outside the public sphere during his childhood and early youth. He received primary education in New Delhi and then attended The Doon School. However, due to security concerns, he was later home-schooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree at St. Stephen&#x27;s College before moving to Harvard University. Following his father’s assassination and subsequent security concerns, he moved to Rollins College in Florida, completing his degree in 1994. After earning a M.Phil. from Cambridge, Gandhi initiated his professional career with the Monitor Group, a management consulting firm in London. Soon thereafter, he returned to India and founded Backops Services Private Ltd, a technology outsourcing firm based in Mumbai. He ventured into politics in the 2000s, leading the Indian Youth Congress and National Students Union of India, while also being a trustee of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust.

Gandhi led the Congress party during the 2014 and 2019 general elections, where the party experienced significant defeats, securing 44 and 52 seats, respectively. Ahead of the 2024 Indian general elections, Gandhi spearheaded the Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, contributing to the INC winning 99 seats and regaining the status of Official Opposition for the first time in a decade. Gandhi won the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in the 2024 elections and was nominated to serve as Leader of the Opposition.

==Early life and background==
Gandhi was born on 19 June 1970 at Holy Family Hospital in Delhi. He was the first of two children born to Rajiv Gandhi, who later served as the 6th prime minister of India, and Sonia Gandhi, who went on to become the president of the Indian National Congress. As the grandson of former prime minister Indira Gandhi, his lineage is deeply rooted in Indian political history. His paternal grandfather, Feroze Gandhi, hailed from Gujarat and was of Parsi descent. Furthermore, he is the great-grandson of India&#x27;s inaugural prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

Gandhi completed his elementary education at St. Columba&#x27;s School in New Delhi. He then attended The Doon School in Dehradun (an elite all-boys&#x27; boarding school, also the alma mater of his father, Rajiv Gandhi) from 1981 to 1983. At Doon, Gandhi studied alongside notable contemporaries, including former Congress members Jyotiraditya Scindia and Jitin Prasada. Following the assassination of Indira Gandhi by Sikhs in her personal guard on 31 October 1984, his father entered politics and became the 6th prime minister of India. Due to security threats from Sikh extremists, Gandhi and his sister Priyanka were home-schooled, taking examinations under the supervision of teachers. Spending their childhood away from media attention, Gandhi and his sister kept low profiles, appearing with their parents at a handful of public occasions.

Gandhi joined St. Stephen&#x27;s College, Delhi, an affiliated college of the University of Delhi, in 1989 for his undergraduate education. Gandhi&#x27;s academic performance in Class XII, with a score of 61 per cent in the CBSE school certificate, was perceived as not particularly strong. He gained admission to St. Stephen’s College for BA (Honors) History through the sports quota, which granted a 10 per cent advantage in exam scores to promising athletes; per National Rifle Association of India testimonials, Gandhi stood 4th in the 32nd National Shooting Competition held in New Delhi from 26 December 1988 to 5 January 1989. Gandhi had finished fourth in the Centre Fire Pistol 25 M (Indian Rule) Men’s civilian event with a score of 371 out of 400 points. By July 1989, Gandhi had won eight national awards. In 1991, following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi by the LTTE during an election rally, Gandhi left St. Stephen’s and moved to Harvard University. Due to security concerns, he subsequently relocated to Rollins College in Florida. He further went on to obtain an Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Development Studies, from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1995. Following his father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s assassination in 1991, there was a heightened threat perception to the family, those closest to Gandhi were paranoid about his safety and might have forced him to take cover under the misleading surname &quot;Vinci&quot;.

After completing higher education, Gandhi worked at the Monitor Group, a management consulting firm set up by Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, in London for three years. In 2002, he returned to India and established his technology consultancy, Backops Services Private Ltd, in Mumbai, where he served as one of the directors of the firm. Subsequently, he founded BackOps UK, a company that secured defence contracts from foreign suppliers.

==Political career==
===Formative years===

In March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by declaring that he would contest the 14th general elections from his father&#x27;s former constituency of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh for the Lok Sabha, India&#x27;s lower house of parliament. His mother had held the seat until she transferred to the neighbouring constituency of Raebareli. When Gandhi made this announcement, it came as a surprise to political commentators, who had perceived his sister Priyanka Gandhi as the more charismatic and probable successor. It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India&#x27;s most famous political family would reinvigorate the Congress party&#x27;s political fortunes among India&#x27;s youthful population. In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned &quot;divisive&quot; politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce caste and religious tensions.

After being out of power for a record eight years, the Congress party returned to power, winning a total of 145 seats in the 2004 Indian general election. A coalition government was formed at the center by Congress with the backing of regional parties. Gandhi secured a victory by a substantial margin of over 100,000 votes, thereby maintaining the stronghold of his family in Uttar Pradesh. The party performed poorly in Uttar Pradesh, as it held 10 out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with a vote share of 12.53 per cent. Gandhi did not hold any official role or position within the government. From 2004 to 2006, Gandhi served as a member for the Standing Committee on Home Affairs. Between 2006 and 2009, he served as the member of the Standing Committee on Human Resource Development.

Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka, managed their mother&#x27;s campaign for re-election to Raebareilly in 2006, which was won with a margin of over 400,000 votes. He was a prominent figure in the Congress campaign for the 2007 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election; Congress did not perform well in those elections, winning 22 seats of the 403 seats with 8.53 per cent of the vote. On 24 September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as the general secretary of the All India Congress Committee, the governing body of the Congress party, as part of a reshuffle of the party secretariat. In the same reshuffle, he was also given charge of the Indian Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India.

For the 2009 Indian general election, Gandhi campaigned across India covering 22 states and 107 constituencies. His campaigning included addressing public rallies and meetings, interacting with voters, and highlighting the party&#x27;s vision and agenda for the country. He specifically focused on issues such as rural development, education, employment, and women&#x27;s empowerment. Gandhi, also emphasised the importance of youth participation in politics and urged them to be more involved in shaping the country&#x27;s future. The nationwide elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and gave a clear mandate to the incumbent, Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The 2009 general elections were a success for the INC, which won 206 seats. While the Congress did not win a majority in the election, they emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government with the support of other parties. Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes. Gandhi was credited with the Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh where they won 21 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats. 

====Youth politics====
In September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC), segment of the Congress party that represents the younger generation, and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), the faction that caters to the student community. As the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi played a notable role in shaping the policies and strategies of these organisations. After his appointment, both groups saw a significant increase in membership, from 200,000 to 2.5 million. The IYC underwent a restructuring process to make it more democratic and inclusive. In November 2008, Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in New Delhi to handpick at least 40 people to make up the IYC&#x27;s think tank. In 2009, during Gandhi&#x27;s visit to West Bengal, the state unit of the Youth Congress registered 1 million members. Similarly, the IYC acquired around 10 to 15 new members per day in each assembly segment of Uttar Pradesh. After his visit, the number surged to 150 to 200 new members per day in the same regions.

While serving as the general secretary of the NSUI, Gandhi played an active role in strengthening the organisation and increasing student participation in politics. Under his leadership, the NSUI initiated programs and campaigns to address issues affecting the student community, such as the quality of education, employment opportunities, and social justice. Gandhi also advocated for greater student representation in decision-making processes and supported student leaders in their endeavours.

===Congress presidency===

Ahead of the 2014 Indian general election, Gandhi was named the vice president of the Indian National Congress, effectively making him the party’s second-in-command. Gandhi contested the 2014 Indian general election from his constituency, Amethi, and led the election campaign of the Indian National Congress. Gandhi retained the Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival, BJP&#x27;s Smriti Irani, by a margin of 107,000 votes. The Congress party suffered a massive defeat, winning 44 seats—its worst performance ever in the Lok Sabha elections. The UPA also had its worst-ever performance in elections and won 59 seats, compared to the 262 seats won in 2009. Following the defeat, Gandhi offered to resign from his positions which was rejected by the Congress Working Committee.

Gandhi led the 2019 election campaign of the Congress party. During campaign, Gandhi announced &quot;Nyay&quot; (Nyuntam Aay Yojana— Minimum Income Gurantee) Scheme promising Rs 6,000 each to 20 per cent poorest households to his election speeches. Gandhi also promised to fill 22 lakhs government jobs within one year coming to power at the Centre. Gandhi used the slogan &quot;Chowkidar Chor Hai&quot; as a jibe against Narendra Modi, BJP&#x27;s prime ministerial candidate during his election rallies. The slogan was aimed at Modi about the alleged irregularities and favouritism in awarding the contracts for the Rafale fighter jet deal. Post election results the INC won 52 seats, eight more than the previous election. Its vote percentage once again fell below 20 per cent. Gandhi won the Wayanad seat with over 60 per cent vote share. He lost his existing seat of Amethi to Smriti Irani of the BJP by a margin of 55,120 votes.

Ahead of the 2024 Indian general elections, Gandhi spearheaded political initiatives, including the Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, which were designed to address pressing social and economic issues facing the country. These campaigns aimed to foster unity and counter divisive politics, while also enhancing the visibility of the Indian National Congress (INC) among voters. The INC secured 99 seats in the elections, representing an improvement from previous electoral performances and allowing the party to reclaim the status of Official Opposition for the first time in ten years. In the elections, Gandhi successfully won the Rae Bareli constituency, succeeding his mother, Sonia Gandhi. Following this victory, he was nominated as the leader of the opposition in Parliament, reinforcing his role as a prominent figure within the party and the opposition landscape.

As a member of Parliament of India since 2004, Gandhi has served as a member of several parliamentary committees including Home Affairs, Human Resource Development, External Affairs, Ministry of Finance and Corporate Affairs and Defence.

====National Herald case====
The National Herald case revolves around allegations of financial irregularities and misuse of funds related to the National Herald newspaper. The case garnered attention when former BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint accusing Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and five other Congress party leaders—Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey, and Satyan Pitroda—of cheating and misappropriating funds associated with the National Herald. The allegations by then-BJP leader Subramanian Swamy centered on a loan given by the Congress party to &quot;Associated Journals Limited&quot; (AJL), the company that owned the National Herald newspaper. Subramanian Swamy alleged that the loan, amounting to around , was not repaid. Instead, it was converted into equity, effectively transferring the ownership of AJL to a new company called &quot;Young India Ltd&quot; (YIL), in which Sonia Gandhi hold 76 per cent of the company&#x27;s shares, and the remaining 24 per cent are held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes. As per Swamy, YIL paid to get back ₹90 crore that Associated AJL owed to the Congress party. He also alleged that the loan given to AJL was illegal, as it had been taken from party funds.

The case went through various legal proceedings, including hearings in lower courts and the Delhi High Court. In December 2015, the Delhi High Court dismissed the appeals of Sonia Gandhi and five others, ordering them to appear in person before the trial court. In 2015, the Supreme Court of India instructed Swamy to present arguments for expediting the trial in the high court. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were granted bail by the trial court on 19 December 2015. Subsequently, in 2016, the Supreme Court exempted all five accused individuals (including the Gandhis, Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, and Suman Dubey) from personally attending court hearings, declining to dismiss the ongoing legal proceedings against them. In December 2020, the Delhi court dismissed a petition filed by then-BJP leader Subramanian Swamy seeking to summon Rahul and Sonia Gandhi and others as accused in the case. The court held that there was no &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence to suggest their involvement in any corruption conspiracy. In 2014, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) initiated an investigation into Swamy&#x27;s complaint to determine if there were any indications of money laundering. The investigation was closed due to technical reasons. Nonetheless, Swamy wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi expressing his suspicions about ED Director Ranjan Katoch. Subsequently, in 2015, Katoch was replaced, and the case was reopened. In December 2015, the Patiala court granted bail to the five individuals accused in the case. The Congress party objected to Swamy&#x27;s complaint, calling it “vindictive politics”.

===Bharat Jodo Yatra===
The Bharat Jodo Yatra, which translates to &quot;Unify India March,&quot; was a campaign organised by the Congress party spanning from 2022 to 2023 with the stated primary objective of promoting national unity and solidarity across the various regions of India. It aimed to mobilise support for the INC and its ideology, emphasising themes of patriotism, cultural heritage, and development. Gandhi started the initiative on 7 September 2022 at Kanyakumari after paying tributes to his late father Rajiv Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, and the Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar. The yatra saw Gandhi along with INC leaders, including members of Parliament and notable personalities, travelling across the country, addressing rallies, conducting public meetings, and interacting with citizens. Throughout the yatra, Gandhi focused on issues such as economic development, social justice, and inclusive governance, aiming to strengthen the party&#x27;s grassroots presence and reinvigorate its political relevance on the national stage.

The yatra concluded on 29 January 2023 with the unfurling of the tricolour flag at Lal Chowk, Srinagar; it lasted 137 days, covering 4,080 kilometres (2,540 miles) over nearly five months across 12 states and two union territories. During the yatra, the INC elected a new party president and also won a majority in the 2022 Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, the first majority the party had won won by itself since 2018. In the subsequent elections in Karnataka and Telangana in 2023, the Congress party achieved a landslide victory, marked by an increase in both the party&#x27;s vote share and the number of seats compared to the previous elections in the constituencies through which the march had passed.

====Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra====
From 14 January to 20 March 2024, Gandhi led a second yatra across India from east to west, the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra; unlike the previous version, the Yatra was conducted in a hybrid mode.

=== Disqualification ===

On 13 April 2019, during a political rally in Kolar, Karnataka, India before the 17th general election, Gandhi made a remark in Hindi, questioning, &quot;Why is it that all thieves, whether it be Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi, or Narendra Modi, have Modi in their names?&quot;. A speech comparing Narendra Modi with Fugitive Economic Offenders such as Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi. A criminal defamation case was filed by Purnesh Modi, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Surat West. He alleged that Gandhi had defamed all individuals with the surname Modi. On 16 July 2019, the Surat court excused Gandhi from appearing personally in court due to short notice. On 10 October, he pleaded not guilty in the Surat Court, recording his statements and responding to questions here on 24 June 2021, and again on 29 October. During these appearances, he clarified to the court that he did not intend to defame any community.

On 23 March 2023, Gandhi was convicted and sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment under charges of defamation. The day following the conviction, Utpal Kumar Singh, the Lok Sabha secretary general, announced that Rahul Gandhi would be disqualified as a member of parliament representing the Wayanad constituency, effective from 23 March, the date of his conviction. The secretary general further said that this action was taken under Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RPA), which deals with the disqualification of convicted representatives in India. Gandhi&#x27;s lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi appealed at the higher court and secured a one-month stay on the sentence. On 5 August, the Supreme Court of India issued a stay on Gandhi&#x27;s conviction and sentence, handed down by Chief Judicial Magistrate in Surat on 23 March 2023.

The disqualification of Gandhi prompted widespread reactions and responses, from the Congress party as well as other opposition leaders and lawmakers abroad. Legal experts questioned the basis of the charge, as defamation is only actionable against individuals and not a generic class of people. The US House of Representatives, Ro Khanna, Democrat co-chair of the India Caucus, described the removal of Gandhi from parliament as a &quot;deep betrayal&quot; of India’s &quot;deepest values&quot;. A spokesperson for Germany&#x27;s foreign ministry stated that Berlin had &quot;acknowledged&quot; the verdict and was monitoring the subsequent steps, including the possibility of an appeal and whether the &quot;suspension of his mandate&quot; was deemed justified. US Senator Chris Van Hollen made a separate comment, stating that the news of the disqualification was &quot;alarming&quot;.

==Political positions==
===National security===

In December 2010, during the United States diplomatic cables leak, WikiLeaks leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009 after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Gandhi, then the general secretary of the AICC. One of the guests who was invited for the lunch was the United States ambassador to India, Timothy J. Roemer. In a &quot;candid conversation&quot; with Roemer, he said that he believes Hindu extremists pose a greater threat to his country than Muslim militants. Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Also responding to the ambassador&#x27;s query about the activities in the region by the Islamist militant organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India&#x27;s indigenous Muslim population. In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticised Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad slammed Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, &quot;In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in Pakistan and also some segments of the Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India&#x27;s fight against terror as also our strategic security.&quot; Adding that terrorism has no religion, he claimed that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India. Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the RSS and has compared them to terrorist organisations like SIMI.After the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots at a Madhya Pradesh election rally in Indore, Gandhi claimed that a police officer told him that Pakistan&#x27;s military intelligence service, ISI, was trying to recruit disgruntled riot-affected youngsters. The district administration, Uttar Pradesh state government, Union Home Ministry, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) denied any such development. This remark drew heavy criticism from various political outfits such as BJP, SP, CPI and JD(U). Congress&#x27;s Jairam Ramesh said Gandhi needed to apologise to the Muslim community for this remark. In reply to the ECI&#x27;s show-cause notice to explain why action should not be initiated against him for violating the Model Code of Conduct, Gandhi said that he didn&#x27;t intend to exploit communal sentiments but was referring to divisive politics.

===Lokpal===
Gandhi opines that the Lokpal should be made a constitutional body and it should be made accountable to the Parliament, just like the Election Commission of India. He opined that Lokpal alone cannot root out corruption, rather a strong political will is needed to remove corruption. This statement came out on 25 August 2011, on the 10th day of Anna Hazare&#x27;s fast. Gandhi&#x27;s statement was considered a delaying tactic by the opposition and Team Anna&#x27;s members. It was consequently slammed by opposition leaders Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley. The Parliamentary Standing Committee led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi tabled the Jan Lokpal Bill report in the Rajya Sabha on 9 December 2011. The report recommended the Lokpal be made into a constitutional body.

===Farmers and land agitation===

On 19 April 2015 Gandhi addressed the farmer and worker&#x27;s rally, named as &quot;Kisan Khet Mazdoor&quot; Rally in Ramlila Maidan. Here he made &quot;references to his agitations in Niyamgiri in Orissa and Bhatta-Parsaul in Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh&quot;. The rally was attended by 100,000 people. In the speech he gave, he criticised the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi about his comment in Toronto where he said that he was &quot;cleaning the mess created by previous governments&quot;. He also said, &quot;Do you know how Modi won the election?... He borrowed thousands of crores from industrialists for his several campaigns and advertisements. How will he pay them back? He will pay them back with your land. He will give your land to his industrialist friends.&quot;

He razzed the government as a &quot;suit-boot government&quot;, a reference to Modi&#x27;s monogrammed suit which he wore in the Republic Day meeting with Barack Obama. Moreover, he used the &quot;acche din government&quot; jibe (which was Modi&#x27;s election campaign slogan meaning &quot;good days government&quot;) and mentioned that it had &quot;failed the country&quot;.

A land bill was introduced by the BJP government in the parliament in May which was criticised by the opposition parties. Accusing the government of &quot;murdering&quot; UPA&#x27;s land bill, Gandhi promised to prevent the bill from being passed, if not in the parliament then would &quot;stop you [ BJP government] on streets&quot;. He further accused the government of diluting the bill and called it &quot;anti-farmer&quot;. Gandhi also drew a parallel between &quot;daylight robbery&quot; and the bill. On 26 May, the day of the Modi government&#x27;s first anniversary, Gandhi commented at a rally in Kozhikode &quot;Unfortunately, birthday celebrations is only for a few powerful friends of the government. Kisan, farmers and mazdoor have nothing to celebrate.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s empowerment and LGBTQ rights===
Gandhi has spoken publicly about the importance of women&#x27;s empowerment and gender equality in India. While inaugurating &#x27;Utsaah&#x27;, a Kerala Mahila Congress convention in Kochi, Gandhi stated that the Congress party would actively promote women within its organizational structure and set a target to have 50 per cent of women as chief ministers within the next 10 years. Gandhi initiated the Self-Help Groups amongthe women in the villages of Amethi. The primary focus of this scheme was to bring women together and empower them with information and decision making capabilities. He has called for increased representation of women in politics and for the eradication of gender-based violence. Under the second Manmohan Singh ministry, a Women&#x27;s Reservation Bill to require that a third of Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly seats be reserved for women was introduced in the Rajya Sabha. 
Gandhi backed the bill, stating, &quot;Women do not need any protection. If you give them their rights, they can protect themselves&quot;. This bill passed the Rajya Sabha on 9 March 2010, it never received a vote in the Lok Sabha and eventually lapsed due to its pending status. In 2019, while addressing students in Chennai, Gandhi again called for 33 per cent reservation of all parliamentary Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly seats for women, as well as government jobs. 

On 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India revoked Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, an act which criminalised homosexual sex between adults. Gandhi supported this move, stating that he believed that issues related to personal freedom should be left to the individual. He opined that it&#x27;s essential to uphold the constitutional guarantee of life and liberty to all citizens of India.

=== Climate and energy ===
Gandhi advocates the transition to renewable energy sources and has called for increased investment in solar, wind, and other sustainable energy technologies. He has been very concerned about the environmental degradation of the world and has said that unless environmental problems are made a political issue, they will not get the attention they deserve.

Gandhi criticised the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 draft by calling it &quot;dangerous&quot; and said that its long term consequences will be harmful. Calling it a disaster, he said that it will silence the communities who will be directly impacted by environmental degradation.

=== Economy ===

Gandhi while addressing All India Congress Committee (AICC) in Jaipur, called for an end to red tape and outdated laws that slow job creation.
Gandhi views the economic policies of Modi Government as fundamentally to benefit the 2-3 billionaires and has described them as crony capitalists. Calling the &quot;crony capitalists&quot; as best friends of Modi, he has been critical of the privatisation of government assets. He is of the view that RSS and crony capitalists are colluding to control India. He has been specifically harsh on Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, to whom he said the Modi Government has been very favourable. He sees the rise of Adani as a direct consequence of crony capitalism. He said that he is not anti-business and supports fairness. Disagreeing with privatisation of PSUs, he said that Congress will not allow the privatisation if it comes to power. Citing the report on inequality by Oxfam, he said that rising economic inequality is the result of Modi Government&#x27;s economic policies.

==== Demonetization ====
Gandhi has been very critical of the Modi government&#x27;s demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series. He has called it a &quot;tragedy&quot; and a &quot;disaster&quot; that has negatively impacted the Indian economy and the lives of ordinary citizens. Gandhi has also accused the government of carrying out the policy without adequate planning and causing immense hardship to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. He said that demonetisation is a fundamental failure of policy design and has alleged that it was a deliberate move by &quot;PayPM&quot; to help 2-3 billionaires to monopolise the economy. Terming demonetisation as the country&#x27;s “biggest scam”,

During his public speeches and political rallies, Gandhi has consistently criticised the demonetisation move, claiming that it failed to achieve its intended objectives of combating black money and curbing corruption. He has also argued that the policy was implemented without proper consultation with experts or the opposition parties. Gandhi further asserted that, demonetisation caused significant disruption to farmers, and rendered millions jobless in small and medium-sized businesses, and workers in the informal sector.

<text>Talk to Your Daughter is a blues rock album by the American musician Robben Ford, released in 1988. The cover version of Albert King&#x27;s &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot; was used on the soundtrack to the Clint Eastwood movie &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Windsor Star&quot; wrote that the album &quot;is one of the most challenging, enjoyable new releases of 1988... &quot;Talk To Your Daughter&quot; combines some traditional blues elements, as in &#x27;Born Under a Bad Sign&#x27; and the marvellous title tune, with more adventurous things, like &#x27;Help the Poor&#x27;, to create an aural tapestry of bluesy music that is played with intensity and a strong sense of balance.&quot;

<text>The Island line () is one of ten lines of the MTR, the mass transit system in Hong Kong. It runs from Kennedy Town in the Western district to Chai Wan in the Eastern District on Hong Kong Island, passing through the territory&#x27;s major business districts of Central, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, and connecting them with built-up areas on the north shore of the island. 

The line first opened on 31 May 1985. As of 2022 it travels in 25 minutes along its route, serving 17 stations. The line is indicated in dark blue colour on the MTR route map.

==History==
The origins of the proposal for the line originated in the 1967 and 1970 studies, which originally planned to run from Kennedy Town to Chai Wan, but the route between Sheung Wan and Kennedy was omitted when the proposal was finalized during the construction.

The Hong Kong Government authorised the construction of the Island line in December 1980, after rejecting plans to extend the tram eastwards to Chai Wan. 

 On 31 May 1985 the Island line opened with services operating between Admiralty and Chai Wan stations with trains in six-car configuration. The opening ceremony was held at Tai Koo station and was officiated by then-MTR chairman Sir Wilfrid Newton and Governor of Hong Kong Sir Edward Youde, who unveiled the commemorative plaques at the station concourse.

On 23 May 1986, the Island line was extended to Central and Sheung Wan stations. Both Admiralty and Central stations became interchange stations with the Tsuen Wan line (which was the until 26 April 1982). As part of this extension, each train was lengthened to eight cars.

=== Quarry Bay Congestion Relief ===
After the Kwun Tong line was extended to Quarry Bay station through the Eastern Harbour Crossing on 1 October 1989, that station became an interchange station with the Island line, but unlike that at Admiralty, there is no cross-platform arrangement requiring passengers to use two escalators and a long passageway in between to change between the platforms of the lines. In a response to the resulting congestion, the government recommended the Quarry Bay Congestion Relief Works project, and decided to expand North Point station to include a second interchange with the Kwun Tong line, with construction starting in July 1998.

The North Point interchange opened on 27 September 2001, and proved to be a much more efficient method of interchanging, as the new station featured cross-platform interchange, reducing the time required to interchange from five minutes at Quarry Bay station to less than one minute. On 4 August 2002, both these stations became interchange stations with the new Tseung Kwan O line which had taken over the harbour crossing section from the Kwun Tong line.

=== Western extension ===

In 2002, the MTRC announced that it would use HK$300 million to construct the West and South Island lines, provided that the Government would award subsidies towards the project. No sooner, in May 2002, the first proposal from the MTRC detailed a western extension of the existing Island line towards Kennedy Town. However the plan was abruptly brought to a halt due to land reclamation obstacles on the western coast of Hong Kong Island, and the enormous cost and uncertainties concerning the Hong Kong Government&#x27;s subsidies for the project. However, the current plan for the new lines to the Southern District would require parts of the Western extension in order for it to be completed. As a result, the MTR Corporation was conducting extensive surveys as well as public forums to gather opinion and suggestions concerning the alignment of the extension and location of the Sai Ying Pun, Shek Tong Tsui and Kennedy Town stations for the West Island line.

Construction commenced on the Island line&#x27;s western extension to Kennedy Town in 2009 and on 28 December 2014, the extension opened to passenger services, providing direct heavy rail connection to the western district of Hong Kong Island for the first time. New intermediate stations at Sai Ying Pun and the University of Hong Kong also opened as part of the extension; however, construction delayed the opening of Sai Ying Pun station to 29 March 2015.

==Rolling stock==
==Route description==
The Island line resembles the deep-level lines of the London Underground, as most of the route and stations along the line are deep underground and consist of cylindrical tunnels. This is the result of a lack of available land, as the construction plans for the line required it to be built under major roads.

Only the segment of the line east of Shau Kei Wan has space for track expansion and thus the line emerges to the surface at Heng Fa Chuen, and then on a viaduct, which runs alongside Shing Tai Road, and which passes over Chai Wan Park and Island Eastern Corridor above ground, all the way to Chai Wan.

The route of the original underground section of the line is also served by Hong Kong Tramways at surface level (the West Island line extension follows its own routing further inland from the tramway). This brought concerns that the tram system might be abolished when the MTR line was to be built, but a decision to save the tramline was made in 1980; and it serves as a backup in the event of service breakdown and a cheaper alternative for shorter journeys.

Because of the depth of the line, most underground stations on this line have curved walls on the platforms, which are due to the route&#x27;s cylindrical tunnels, only with a greater diameter. Of the underground stations not bearing this feature, Tai Koo station is itself a large tube containing both the concourse and the platform, Sai Ying Pun station and HKU station consists of station boxes that are themselves, also tube-like though flatter, while Shau Kei Wan, Admiralty, Central and Kennedy Town stations are built using the cut-and-cover method.

Because most stations were built under roads, most of the platforms are curved, resulting in large platform gaps. The few stations where the platforms are otherwise relatively straight are those on the West Island line as well as North Point, Quarry Bay, Tai Koo, Heng Fa Chuen and Chai Wan. Also, due to geographical constraints, the platforms of Wan Chai, Causeway Bay, Tin Hau and Sai Wan Ho are located on two different levels. This also separates the platform and concourse into two parts, so there are some passageways and long escalators on those stations to link between the platform and concourse.

All Island line stations except Heng Fa Chuen and Chai Wan have their Chinese station names written in Chinese calligraphy as part of the stations&#x27; livery. A retired architect involved in the design of the Island line, Abe Au Kit-tong, explained that the calligraphy is written in large fonts to alleviate the psychological effect caused by the narrow platforms and the curvature of the walls, in addition to reminding passengers what the stop is. This explains why Heng Fa Chuen and Chai Wan stations do not have calligraphy forming part of their livery, as they are built above ground rather than underground. This feature is also shared amongst some newer MTR stations such as those on the Tseung Kwan O line and Lam Tin station on the Kwun Tong line.

<doc id="305014" wikidata="Q312735" url="?curid=305014" title="James II of Aragon">
<text>James II (Catalan: &quot;Jaume II&quot;; Aragonese: &quot;Chaime II;&quot; 10 April 1267 – 2 or 5 November 1327), called the Just, was the King of Aragon and Valencia and Count of Barcelona from 1291 to 1327. He was also the King of Sicily (as James I) from 1285 to 1295 and the King of Majorca from 1291 to 1298. From 1297 he was nominally the King of Sardinia and Corsica, but he only acquired the island of Sardinia by conquest in 1324. His full title for the last three decades of his reign was &quot;James, by the grace of God, king of Aragon, Valencia, Sardinia and Corsica, and count of Barcelona&quot; (Latin: &quot;Iacobus Dei gratia rex Aragonum, Valencie, Sardinie, et Corsice ac comes Barchinone&quot;).

Born at Valencia, James was the second son of Peter III of Aragon and Constance of Sicily. He succeeded his father in Sicily in 1285 and his elder brother Alfonso III in Aragon and the rest of the Spanish territories, including Majorca, in 1291. In 1295 he was forced to cede Sicily to the papacy, after which it was seized by his younger brother, Frederick III, in 1296. Two years later rom Pope Boniface VIII returned the island to the king of Majorca along with rights to Sardinia and Corsica. On 20 January 1296, Boniface issued the bull &quot;Redemptor mundi&quot; granting James the titles of Standard-bearer, Captain General and Admiral of the Roman church.

==Reign==
===1285–1298===
James succeeded his father as King of Sicily in 1286, being crowned in Palermo. In response, Pope Honorius IV excommunicated James. Upon the death of his brother Alfonso III in 1291, he succeeded also to the throne of the Crown of Aragon. He spent May of that year in Catania, inspiring the local monk Atanasiu di Iaci to write the &quot;Vinuta di re Iapicu&quot; about his time there. By a peace treaty with Charles II of Anjou in 1296, he agreed to give up Sicily, but the Sicilians instead installed his brother Frederick on the throne.

Due to the fact that Frederick would not withdraw from the island, Pope Boniface VIII asked James II, along with Charles II of Naples, to remove him. As an enticement to do this the Pope invested James II with the title to Sardinia and Corsica, as well as appointing him papal gonfalonier. Because of his inability to disguise his apathy on the matter, he returned to Aragon. Frederick reigned there until his death in 1337.

By the Treaty of Anagni in 1295, he returned the Balearic Islands to his uncle James II of Majorca. In 1298, by the Treaty of Argilers, James of Majorca recognised the suzerainty of James of Aragon.

===1298–1327===

During the period that followed his return to Aragon, James II wanted to gain access to the Muslim world in the south, from which Castile restricted Aragon. In order to achieve this goal, and assisted by his Admiral Don Bernat de Sarrià, Baron of Polop, he formed an alliance with the enemies of the adolescent king of Castile, Ferdinand IV. James II wanted Murcia in order to give his kingdom access to Granada. The allied forces entered from all directions in 1296, where James II was victorious in capturing Murcia and holding it until 1304.

In 1313, James II granted administrative and political autonomy to the Aran Valley, the legal details of which are described in a Latin manuscript called the Querimonia. The devolution of power was a reward for the Aranese pledging allegiance to James II in a dispute with the kingdoms of France and Majorca over control of the valley.

James was involved in the 1321 leper scare. He ordered the arrest and torture of French lepers seeking shelter in his realm, and adopted harsher policy towards native lepers.

==Writing==
It was probably during his reign at Sicily (1285–1291) that James composed his only surviving piece of Occitan poetry, a religious &quot;dansa&quot; dedicated to the Virgin Mary, &quot;Mayre de Deu&quot;. A contemporary, Arnau de Vilanova, wrote a verse-by-verse Latin commentary of the &quot;dansa&quot; in 1305. The metaphor James uses has been analysed by Alfred Jeanroy, who sees similarities in the &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot;.

James begins by comparing the Church to a ship in a storm, poorly guided by its pilot (&quot;nauchier&quot;, i.e. the Pope):

The literary quality of the verses is neither astounding nor disappointing, but the song was clearly written at a moment when James was in conflict with the Papacy, perhaps with a propagandistic end, to prove his piety and fidelity to the Church if not the Papacy. The final verses ask Mary to protect him, the king, from sin:
==Family==
===Marriages, concubines and children===
James married four times:

— Isabella of Castile, Viscountess of Limoges, daughter of Sancho IV of Castile and his wife María de Molina. The wedding took place in the city of Soria, on 1 December 1291 when the bride was only 8 years old. The marriage, which was never consummated, was dissolved and annulled after Pope Boniface VIII refused to granted a dispensation for the marriage.

— Blanche of Anjou, daughter of his family&#x27;s rival Charles II of Naples and Maria of Hungary. They married in the city of Villabertran, on 29 October or 1 November 1295. They had several children:

*James (b. 29 September 1296 – d. Tarragona, July 1334). James renounced his right to the throne in 1319 to become a monk. He refused to consummate his marriage to Eleanor of Castille, who later become the second wife of his brother Alfonso.
*Alfonso IV of Aragon (1299 – 24 January 1336). He became the King of Aragon in 1327 and ruled until his death. He married twice: first Teresa d&#x27;Entença and then Eleanor of Castile after his first wife died.
*Maria (b. 1299 – d. as a nun in Sijena, 1347), wife of Peter, son of Sancho IV of Castile.
*Constance (b. Valencia, 1 April 1300 – d. Castillo de Garcia Munoz, 19 September 1327), wife of Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, nephew of Alfonso X of Castile.
*John (b. 1304 – d. Pobo, Zaragoza, 19 August 1334). John became the first Archbishop of Toledo and Tarragona in 1318, and Patriarch of Alexandria in 1328.
*Isabella of Aragon (b. 1305 – d. Styria, 12 July 1330), wife of Frederick I of Austria.
*Peter (b. 1305 – d. Pisa, 4 November 1381), Count of Ribagorza, Empúries and Prades. Peter married Joan, daughter of Gaston I of Foix, they were parents to:

** John (b. 1335, d. 1414), 2nd Count of Prades, Seneschal of Catalonia, married his sister-in-law Sancha Ximénez de Arenós, had issue
** Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Cyprus.
*Blanche (b. 1307 – d. Barcelona, 1348), Prioress of Sixena.
*Ramon Berenguer (b. August 1308 – d. a priest at Barcelona, 1366), Count of Empúries and Baron of Ejerica. Ramon married Blanche, daughter of Philip I of Taranto, and then Maria, daughter of James of Aragon. His daughter Joan married Fernando Manuel, son of Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena
*Violante (b. Barcelona, October 1310 – d. Pedrola, 19 July 1353). She first married Philip, Despot of Romania, son of Philip I of Taranto. Her second marriage was to Lope de Luna, Lord of Segorbe.

— Marie of Lusignan (1273 – April 1319 at Tortosa, buried at Barcelona), daughter of the King Hugh III of Cyprus. They married by proxy in Santa Sophia, Nicosia, on 15 June 1315, and in person in the city of Girona, on 27 November 1315. This marriage was childless.

— Elisenda de Montcada, daughter of Pedro I de Montcada, Lord of Altona and Soses, and wife Gisela d&#x27;Abarca. They married in the city of Tarragona, on 25 December 1322. This marriage was childless, too, and, after the king&#x27;s death, she entered the Poor Clares Monastery of Pedralbes as a nun, where she died on 19 June 1364.

In addition to his legitimate offspring, James had three natural children born with Sicilian women:

— With Gerolda:

*Sancho (b. Sicily, 1287 – d. young?).
*Napoleón (b. Sicily, 1288 – m. 1338), Lord of Joyosa Guarda (Gioiosaguardia) and Acquafredda (in Sardinia); married a daughter of a Majorcan named Guillermo Robert.

— With Lucrecia:

*James (b. Mazzara, 1291 – d. 1350), Vicario di Cagliari (1317–1341); married firstly with Jaumetta Guerau, from Majorca, and secondly with Puccia, a Sardinian woman.

<text>Pratītyasamutpāda (Sanskrit: प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद, Pāli: &quot;paṭiccasamuppāda&quot;), commonly translated as dependent origination, or dependent arising, is a key doctrine in Buddhism shared by all schools of Buddhism. It states that all dharmas (phenomena) arise in dependence upon other dharmas: &quot;if this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist&quot;. The basic principle is that all things (dharmas, phenomena, principles) arise in dependence upon other things.

The doctrine includes depictions of the arising of suffering (&quot;anuloma-paṭiccasamuppāda&quot;, &quot;with the grain&quot;, forward conditionality) and depictions of how the chain can be reversed (&quot;paṭiloma-paṭiccasamuppāda&quot;, &quot;against the grain&quot;, reverse conditionality). These processes are expressed in various lists of dependently originated phenomena, the most well-known of which is the twelve links or &quot;nidānas&quot; (Pāli: &quot;dvādasanidānāni,&quot; Sanskrit: &quot;dvādaśanidānāni&quot;). The traditional interpretation of these lists is that they describe the process of a sentient being&#x27;s rebirth in &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, and the resultant &quot;duḥkha&quot; (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness), and they provide an analysis of rebirth and suffering that avoids positing an atman (unchanging self or eternal soul). The reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the cessation of rebirth (and thus, the cessation of suffering).

Another interpretation regards the lists as describing the arising of mental processes and the resultant notion of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; that leads to grasping and suffering. Several modern western scholars argue that there are inconsistencies in the list of twelve links, and regard it to be a later synthesis of several older lists and elements, some of which can be traced to the Vedas.

The doctrine of dependent origination appears throughout the early Buddhist texts. It is the main topic of the &quot;Nidana Samyutta&quot; of the Theravada school&#x27;s &quot;Saṃyuttanikāya&quot; (henceforth SN). A parallel collection of discourses also exists in the Chinese &quot;Saṁyuktāgama&quot; (henceforth SA).

==Overview==
Dependent origination is a philosophically complex concept, subject to a large variety of explanations and interpretations. As the interpretations often involve specific aspects of dependent origination, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive to each other.

Dependent origination can be contrasted with the classic Western concept of causation in which an action by one thing is said to cause a change in another thing. Dependent origination instead views the change as being caused by many factors, not just one or even a few.

The principle of dependent origination has a variety of philosophical implications.

* As an ontological principle (i.e., as a metaphysical concept about the nature of existence), it holds that all phenomena arise from other, pre-existing phenomena, and in turn current phenomena condition future phenomena. As such, everything in the world has been produced by causes. Traditionally, this is also closely connected to the Buddhist doctrine of rebirth, and how rebirth occurs without a fixed self or soul, but as a process conditioned by various phenomena and their relations.
* As an epistemological principle (i.e., as a theory about knowledge), it holds that there are no permanent and stable things, though there are classes of permanent phenomena vis. space (vacuum), cessations (including nirvana), and suchness (the absence of self, namely, anatta). Because everything is dependently originated, nothing is permanent (hence the Buddhist concept of impermanence, &quot;anicca&quot;) and nothing has any self-nature or essence (&quot;anatta&quot;). Consequently, all phenomena lack essence. In various traditions, this is closely associated with the doctrine of emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;).
* As a phenomenological or psychological principle, it refers to the workings of the mind and how suffering, craving, and self-view arise. This can refer to how different mental states condition each other over time, or to how different mental phenomena condition each other in a single moment.

==Etymology==
&quot;Pratītyasamutpāda&quot; consists of two terms:

* &quot;Pratītya&quot;: &quot;having depended&quot;. The term appears in the Vedas and Upanishads in the sense of &quot;confirmation, dependence, acknowledge origin&quot;. The Sanskrit root of the word is &quot;prati*&quot; whose forms appear more extensively in the Vedic literature, and it means &quot;to go towards, go back, come back, to approach&quot; with the connotation of &quot;observe, learn, convince oneself of the truth of anything, be certain of, believe, give credence, recognize&quot;. In other contexts, a related term &quot;pratiti*&quot; means &quot;going towards, approaching, insight into anything&quot;.
* &quot;Samutpāda&quot;: &quot;arising&quot;, &quot;rise, production, origin&quot; In Vedic literature, it means &quot;spring up together, arise, come to pass, occur, effect, form, produce, originate&quot;.

&quot;Pratītyasamutpāda&quot; has been translated into English as &quot;dependent origination&quot;, &quot;dependent arising&quot;, &quot;interdependent co-arising&quot;, &quot;conditioned arising&quot;, and &quot;conditioned genesis&quot;.

Jeffrey Hopkins notes that terms synonymous to &quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot; are &quot;apekṣasamutpāda&quot; and &quot;prāpyasamutpāda&quot;.

The term may also refer to the twelve nidānas, Pali: &quot;dvādasanidānāni,&quot; Sanskrit: &quot;dvādaśanidānāni,&quot; from &quot;dvādaśa&quot; (&quot;twelve&quot;) + &quot;nidānāni&quot; (plural of &quot;nidāna&quot;, &quot;cause, motivation, link&quot;). Generally speaking, in the Mahayana tradition, &quot;pratityasamutpada&quot; (Sanskrit) is used to refer to the general principle of interdependent causation, whereas in the Theravada tradition, &quot;paticcasamuppāda&quot; (Pali) is used to refer to the twelve nidānas.

== Dependent origination in early Buddhism ==

=== The principle of conditionality===
In the early Buddhist texts, the basic principle of conditionality is called by different names such as &quot;the certainty (or law) of dhamma&quot; (&quot;dhammaniyāmatā&quot;), &quot;suchness of dharma&quot; (法如; *&quot;dharmatathatā&quot;), the &quot;enduring principle&quot; (&quot;ṭhitā dhātu&quot;), &quot;specific conditionality&quot; (&quot;idappaccayatā&quot;) and &quot;dhammic nature&quot; (法爾; &quot;dhammatā&quot;). This principle is expressed in its most general form as follows:

According to Paul Williams &quot;this is what causation is for early Buddhist thought. It is a relationship between events, and is what we call it when if X occurs Y follows, and when X does not occur Y does not follow.&quot; Richard Gombrich writes that this basic principle that &quot;things happen under certain conditions&quot; means that the Buddha understood experiences as &quot;processes subject to causation&quot;. Bhikkhu Bodhi writes that specific conditionality &quot;is a relationship of indispensability and dependency: the indispensability of the condition (e.g. birth) to the arisen state (e.g. aging and death), the dependency of the arisen state upon its condition.&quot;

Peter Harvey states this means that &quot;nothing (except nirvāna) is independent. The doctrine thus complements the teaching that no permanent, independent self can be found.&quot; Ajahn Brahm argues that the grammar of the above passage indicates that one feature of the Buddhist principle of causality is that &quot;there can be a substantial time interval between a cause and its effect. It is a mistake to assume that the effect follows one moment after its cause, or that it appears simultaneously with its cause.&quot;

===Variable phenomena, invariant principle===
According to the &quot;Paccaya sutta&quot; (SN 12.20 and its parallel in SA 296)&quot;,&quot; dependent origination is the basic principle of conditionality which is at play in all conditioned phenomena. This principle is invariable and stable, while the &quot;dependently arisen processes&quot; (&quot;paṭiccasamuppannā dhammā&quot;) are variable and impermanent.

Peter Harvey argues that there is an &quot;overall Basic Pattern that is Dhamma&quot; within which &quot;specific basic patterns (dhammas) flow into and nurture each other in complex, but set, regular patterns.&quot;.

====Invariant principle====
According to the &quot;Paccaya sutta&quot; (SN 12.20) and its parallel, this natural law of &quot;this/that conditionality&quot; is independent of being discovered by a Buddha (a &quot;Tathāgata&quot;), just like the laws of physics. The &quot;Paccaya sutta&quot; states that whether or not there are Buddhas who see it &quot;this elemental fact (&quot;dhātu&quot;, or &quot;principle&quot;) just stands (&quot;thitā&quot;), this basic-pattern-stability (&quot;dhamma-tthitatā&quot;), this basic-pattern-regularity (&quot;dhamma-niyāmatā&quot;): specific conditionality (&quot;idappaccayatā&quot;).&quot;

Bhikkhu Sujato translates the basic description of the stability of dependent origination as &quot;the fact that this is real, not unreal, not otherwise&quot;. The Chinese parallel at SA 296 similarly states that dependent origination is &quot;the constancy of dharmas, the certainty of dharmas, suchness of dharmas, no departure from the true, no difference from the true, actuality, truth, reality, non-confusion&quot;. According to Harvey, these passages indicate that conditionality is &quot;a principle of causal regularity, a Basic Pattern (Dhamma) of things&quot; which can be discovered, understood and then transcended.

==== Variable phenomena – dependently arisen processes ====
The principle of conditionality, which is real and stable, is contrasted with the &quot;dependently arisen processes&quot;, which are described as &quot;impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, of a nature to be destroyed, of a nature to vanish, of a nature to fade away, of a nature to cease.&quot; SA 296 describes them simply as &quot;arising thus according to causal condition, these are called dharmas arisen by causal condition.&quot;

=== Conditionality and liberation ===

====The Buddha&#x27;s discovery of conditionality====
Regarding the arising of suffering, SN 12.10 discusses how before the Buddha&#x27;s awakening, he searched for the escape from suffering as follows: &quot;when what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?&quot;, discovering the chain of conditions as expressed in the twelve nidanas and other lists. MN 26 also reports that after the Buddha&#x27;s awakening, he considered that dependent origination was one of the two principles which were &quot;profound (&quot;gambhira&quot;), difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of mere reasoning (&quot;atakkāvacara&quot;), subtle.&quot; The other principle which is profound and difficult to see is said to be Nirvana, &quot;the stopping, or transcending, of conditioned co-arising&quot; (Harvey).

In the &quot;Mahānidānasutta&quot; (DN 15) the Buddha states that dependent origination is &quot;deep and appears deep&quot;, and that it is &quot;because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching&quot; that people become &quot;tangled like a ball of string&quot; in views (&quot;diṭṭhis&quot;), samsara, rebirth and suffering. SN 12.70 and its counterpart SA 347 state that &quot;knowledge of Dhamma-stability&quot; (&quot;dhamma-tthiti-ñānam&quot;) comes first, then comes knowledge of nirvana (&quot;nibbane-ñānam&quot;). However, while the process which leads to nirvāna is conditioned, nirvāna itself is called &quot;unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconstructed&quot; (Ud. 80–1). The &quot;Milinda Panha&quot; compares to how a mountain is not dependent on the path that leads to it (Miln. 269)&quot;. According to Harvey, since it is &quot;not co-arisen (&quot;asamuppana&quot;) (It. 37–8), nirvāna is not something that is conditionally arisen, but is the stopping of all such processes.&quot;

====Seeing the dharma====
MN 28 associates knowing dependent origination with knowing the dharma:

A well-known early exposition of the basic principle of causality is said to have led to the stream entry of Sariputta and Moggallāna. This &quot;ye dharmā hetu&quot; phrase, which appears in the Vinaya (Vin.I.40) and other sources, states:Of those dharmas which arise from a cause, the Tathagata has stated the cause, and also their cessation.A similar phrase is uttered by Kondañña, the first convert to realize awakening at the end of the first sermon given by the Buddha: &quot;whatever has the nature to arise (&quot;samudaya dhamma&quot;) also has the nature to pass away (&quot;nirodha dhamma&quot;).&quot;

===Application===

==== Conditionality as the middle way – not-self and emptiness ====
The early Buddhist texts also associate dependent arising with emptiness and not-self. The early Buddhist texts outline different ways in which dependent origination is a middle way between different sets of &quot;extreme&quot; views (such as &quot;monist&quot; and &quot;pluralist&quot; ontologies or materialist and dualist views of mind-body relation). In the &quot;Kaccānagottasutta&quot; (SN 12.15, parallel at SA 301), the Buddha states that &quot;this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence&quot; and then explains the right view as follows:
The &quot;Kaccānagottasutta&quot; then places the teaching of dependent origination (listing the twelve nidanas in forward and reverse order) as a middle way which rejects these two &quot;extreme&quot; metaphysical views which can be seen as two mistaken conceptions of the self.

According to Hùifēng, a recurring theme throughout the &quot;Nidānasamyutta&quot; (SN 12) is the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;rejection of arising from any one or other of the four categories of self, other, both or neither (non-causality).&quot; A related statement can be found in the &quot;Paramārtha­śūnyatāsūtra&quot; (Dharma Discourse on Ultimate Emptiness, SĀ 335, parallel at EĀ 37:7), which states that when a sense organ arises &quot;it does not come from any location...it does not go to any location&quot;, as such it is said to be &quot;unreal, yet arises; and on having arisen, it ends and ceases.&quot; Furthermore this sutra states that even though &quot;there is action (&quot;karma&quot;) and result (&quot;vipāka&quot;)&quot; there is &quot;no actor agent&quot; (&quot;kāraka&quot;). It also states that dharmas of dependent origination are classified as conventional.

The &quot;Kaccānagottasutta&quot; and its parallel also associates understanding dependent origination with avoiding views of a self (atman). This text states that if &quot;you don&#x27;t get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion &#x27;my self&#x27;, you&#x27;ll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing.&quot; Similarly, the &quot;Mahānidānasutta&quot; (DN 15) associates understanding dependent origination with abandoning various wrongs views about a self, while failing to understand it is associated becoming entangled in these views. Another sutra, SĀ 297, states that dependent origination is &quot;the Dharma Discourse on Great Emptiness&quot;, and then proceeds to refute numerous forms of &quot;self-view&quot; (&quot;ātmadṛṣṭi&quot;).

SN 12:12 (parallel at SĀ 372) the Buddha is asked a series of questions about the self (who feels? who craves? etc.), the Buddha states that these questions are invalid, and instead teaches dependent origination. SĀ 80 also discuss an important meditative attainment called the emptiness concentration (&quot;śūnyatā­samādhi&quot;) which in this text is associated contemplating how phenomena arise due to conditions and are subject to cessation.

====The four noble truths====
According to early suttas like AN 3.61, the second and third noble truths of the four noble truths are directly correlated to the principle of dependent origination. The second truth applies dependent origination in a direct order, while the third truth applies it in inverse order. Furthermore, according to SN 12.28, the noble eight-fold path (the fourth noble truth) is the path which leads to the cessation of the twelve links of dependent origination and as such is the &quot;best of all conditioned states&quot; (AN.II.34). Therefore, according to Harvey, the four noble truths &quot;can be seen as an application of the principle of conditioned co-arising focused particularly on dukkha.&quot;

==== Lists of nidanas ====
In the early Buddhist texts, dependent origination is analyzed and expressed in various lists of dependently originated phenomena &quot;(dhammas)&quot; or causes &quot;(nidānas)&quot;. &quot;Nidānas&quot; are co-dependent principles, processes or events, which act as links on a chain, conditioning and depending on each other. When certain conditions are present, they give rise to subsequent conditions, which in turn give rise to other conditions. Phenomena are sustained only so long as their sustaining factors remain.

The most common one is a list of twelve causes (Pali: &quot;dvādasanidānāni,&quot; Sanskrit: &quot;dvādaśanidānāni&quot;). Bucknell refers to it as the &quot;standard list&quot;. It is found in section 12 of the &quot;Samyutta Nikaya&quot; and its parallels, as well as in other suttas belonging to other Nikayas and Agamas. This list also appears in Mahasamghika texts like the &quot;Salistamba Sutra&quot; and in (later) works like Abhidharma texts and Mahayana sutras. According to Eviatar Shulman, &quot;the 12 links &quot;are paticcasamuppada,&quot;&quot; which is a process of mental conditioning. Cox notes that even though the early scriptures contain numerous variations of lists, the 12 factor list became the standard list in the later Abhidharma and Mahayana treatises.

The most common interpretation of the twelve cause list in the traditional exegetical literature is that the list is describing the conditional arising of rebirth in &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, and the resultant &quot;duḥkha&quot; (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness). An alternative Theravada interpretation regards the list as describing the arising of mental formations and the resultant notion of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine,&quot; which are the source of suffering.

Understanding the relationships between these phenomena is said to lead to nibbana, complete freedom from the cyclical rebirth cycles of samsara. Traditionally, the reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the cessation of mental formations and rebirth. Alex Wayman notes that &quot;according to Buddhist tradition, Gautama discovered this formula during the night of Enlightenment and by working backward from &quot;old age and death&quot; in the reverse of the arising order.&quot; Wayman also writes that &quot;in time, the twelve members were depicted on the rim of a wheel representing samsara.&quot;

== Lists of nidanas ==

=== The twelve nidanas ===
The popular listing of twelve &quot;nidānas&quot; is found in numerous sources. In some of the early texts, the &quot;nidānas&quot; themselves are defined and subjected to analysis (&quot;vibhaṅga&quot;). The explanations of the &quot;nidānas&quot; can be found in the Pali SN 12.2 (&quot;Vibhaṅga&quot; &quot;Analysis&quot; &quot;sutta&quot;) and in its parallel at SA 298. Further parallels to SN 12.2 can be found at EA 49.5, some Sanskrit parallels such as the &quot;Pratītyasamutpādādivibhaṅganirdeśanāmasūtra&quot; (The Discourse giving the Explanation and Analysis of Conditional Origination from the Beginning) and a Tibetan translation of this Sanskrit text at Toh 211.
=== Alternative lists in SN/SA ===
The twelve branched list, though popular, is just one of the many lists of dependently originated dharmas which appear in the early sources. According to Analayo, the alternative lists of dependently arisen phenomena are equally valid &quot;alternative expressions of the same principle&quot;.

Choong notes that some discourses (SN 12.38-40 and SA 359-361) contain only 11 elements, omitting ignorance and starting out from willing (&quot;ceteti&quot;). SN 12.39 begins with three synonyms for &quot;saṅkhāra,&quot; willing, intending (&quot;pakappeti&quot;) and carrying out (&quot;anuseti&quot;). It then states that &quot;this becomes an object (&quot;arammanam&quot;) for the persistence of consciousness (&quot;viññanassa-thitiya&quot;)&quot; which leads to the appearance of name and form. The standard listing then follows.

SN 12.38 (and the parallel at SA 359) contain a much shorter sequence, it begins with willing as above which leads to consciousness, then following after consciousness it states: &quot;there is in the future the becoming of rebirth (&quot;punabbhavabhinibbatti&quot;)&quot;, which leads to &quot;coming-and-going (&quot;agatigati&quot;)&quot;, followed by &quot;decease-and-rebirth (&quot;cutupapato&quot;)&quot; and following that &quot;there arise in the future birth, ageing-and-death, grief, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.&quot; Another short sequence is found at SN 12. 66 and SA 291 which contain an analysis of dependent origination with just three factors: craving (&quot;tanha&quot;), basis (&quot;upadhi&quot;, possibly related to upadana), and suffering (&quot;dukkha&quot;).

In SN 12.59 and its counterpart SA 284, there is a chain that starts by saying that for someone who &quot;abides in seeing [the Chinese has &quot;grasping at&quot;] the flavour in enfettering dharmas (&quot;saññojaniyesu dhammesu&quot;), there comes the appearance (&quot;avakkanti&quot;) of consciousness.&quot; There then follows the standard list. Then it states that if someone abides by &quot;seeing the danger&quot; (&quot;adinavanupassino&quot;) in the dharmas (the Chinese has &quot;seeing impermanence&quot;), there is no appearance of consciousness (Chinese has &quot;mind&quot;).

SN 12.65 and 67 (and SA 287 and 288) begin the chain with both consciousness and name and form conditioning each other in a cyclical relationship. It also states that &quot;consciousness turns back, it goes no further than name and form.&quot; SN 12.67 also contains a chain with consciousness and name and form being in a reciprocal relationship. In this sutta, Sariputta states that this relationship is like two sheaves of reeds leaning on each other for support (the parallel at SA 288 has three sheaves instead).

There are also several passages with chains that begin with the six sense spheres (&quot;ayatana&quot;). They can be found in SN 12. 24, SA 343, SA 352-354, SN 12. 13-14 and SN 12. 71-81. Another one of these is found in SN 35.106, which is termed the &quot;branched version&quot; by Bucknell because it branches off into six classes of consciousness:Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. This is the origin of suffering … [the same formula is repeated with the other six sense bases and six consciousnesses, that is, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind]Other depictions of the chain at SN 12.52 and its parallel at SA 286, begin with seeing the &quot;assada&quot; (taste; enjoyment; satisfaction) which leads to craving and the rest of the list of nidanas. Meanwhile, in SN 12.62 and SA 290, dependent origination is depicted with just two nidanas, contact (&quot;phassa&quot;) and feeling (&quot;vedana&quot;). SN 12.62 says that when one becomes disenchanted with contact and feeling, desire fades away.

=== Alternative lists in other Nikayas ===
The &quot;Kalahavivāda Sutta&quot; of the &quot;Sutta Nipāta&quot; (Sn. 862-872) has the following chain of causes (as summarized by Doug Smith):name-and-form conditions contact, contact conditions feeling, feeling conditions desire, desire conditions clinging, and clinging conditions quarrels, disputes, lamentations, and grief.

&quot;Dīgha Nikāya Sutta&quot; 1, the &quot;Brahmajala Sutta&quot;, verse 3.71 describes six nidānas:

Similarly, the &quot;Madhupiṇḍikasutta&quot; (MN 18) also contains the following passage:Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. What you feel, you perceive. What you perceive, you think about. What you think about, you proliferate (&quot;papañca&quot;). What you proliferate about is the source from which a person is beset by concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions. This occurs with respect to sights known by the eye in the past, future, and present. [The same process is then repeated with the other six sense bases.]The &quot;Mahānidānasutta&quot; (DN 15) and its Chinese parallels such as DA 13 describe a unique version which is dubbed the &quot;looped version&quot; by Bucknell (DN 14 also has a similar looped chain but it adds the six sense fields after name and form):Name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.The &quot;Mahahatthipadopama-sutta&quot; (M 28) contains another short explanation of dependent origination:these five grasping aggregates are indeed dependently originated. The desire, adherence, attraction, and attachment for these five grasping aggregates is the origin of suffering. Giving up and getting rid of desire and greed for these five grasping aggregates is the cessation of suffering.

===Correlation with the five aggregates===
Mathieu Boisvert correlates the middle nidanas (3-10) with the five aggregates. According to Boisvert, the consciousness and feeling aggregates correlate directly with the corresponding nidana, while the rupa aggregate correlates with the six sense objects and contact. The samskara aggregate meanwhile, correlates with nidana #2, as well as craving, clinging and bhava (existence, becoming).

Boisvert notes that while &quot;sañña&quot; (&quot;perception&quot; or &quot;recognition&quot;) is not explicitly found in the twelvefold chain, it would fit in between feeling and craving. This is because unwholesome perceptions (such as delighting in pleasurable feelings) are responsible for the arising of unwholesome &quot;samskaras&quot; (like craving). Likewise, skillful perceptions (such as focusing on the three marks of existence) lead to wholesome samskaras.

According to Analayo, each of the twelve nidanas &quot;re-quires all five aggregates to be in existence concurrently.&quot; Furthermore:The teaching on dependent arising does not posit the existence of any of the links in the abstract, but instead show how a particular link, as an aspect of the continuity of the five aggregates, has a conditioning influence on another link. It does not imply that any of these links exist apart from the five aggregates. 

==Development of the twelve nidanas==

===Commentary on Vedic cosmogeny===
Alex Wayman has argued that the ideas found in the dependent origination doctrine may precede the birth of the Buddha, noting that the first four causal links starting with avidya in the Twelve Nidānas are found in the cosmic development theory of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; and other older Vedic texts.

According to Kalupahana, the concept of causality and causal efficacy where a cause &quot;produces an effect because a property or &quot;svadha&quot; (energy) is inherent in something&quot; along with alternative ideas of causality, appear extensively in the Vedic literature of the 2nd millennium BCE, such as the 10th mandala of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; and the Brahmanas layer of the Vedas.


A similar resemblance has been noted by Joanna Jurewicz, who argues that the first four &quot;nidanas&quot; resemble the &quot;Hymn of Creation&quot; (RigVeda X, 12) and other Vedic sources which describe the creation of the cosmos. Jurewicz argues that dependent origination is &quot;a polemic&quot; against the Vedic creation myth and that, paradoxically, &quot;the Buddha extracted the essence of Vedic cosmogony and expressed in explicit language.&quot; Richard Gombrich agrees with this view, and argues that the first four elements of dependent origination are the Buddha&#x27;s attempt to &quot;ironize and criticize Vedic cosmogony.&quot; According to Gombrich, while in the Vedic creation theory &quot;the universe is considered to be grounded on a primordial essence which is endowed with consciousness,&quot; the Buddha&#x27;s theory avoids this essence (&quot;atman-Bahman&quot;).

Jurewicz and Gombrich compare the first nidana, ignorance (&quot;avijja&quot;), with the stage before creation that is described in the Rigveda&#x27;s &quot;Hymn of Creation&quot;. While the term &quot;avidya&quot; does not actually appear in this Hymn, the pre-creation stage is seen as unknowable and characterized by darkness. According to Gombrich, at this stage &quot;consciousness is non-dual, which is to say that it is the ability to cognize but not yet consciousness of anything, for there is no split yet into subject and object.&quot; This is different from the Buddha&#x27;s point of view, in which consciousness is always consciousness of something. Jurewicz then compares the Vedic creator&#x27;s desire and hunger to create the atman (or &quot;his second self&quot;) with volitional impulses (&quot;samskara&quot;). According to Jurewicz, the third nidana, &quot;vijñana&quot;, can be compared to the atman&#x27;s &quot;vijñanamaya kosha&quot; in Vedic literature, which is the consciousness of the creator and his subjective manifestations.

According to Jurewicz, &quot;in Vedic cosmogony, the act of giving a name and a form marks the final formation of the creator&#x27;s atman.&quot; This may go back to the Vedic birth ceremony in which a father gives a name to his son. In Vedic creation pure consciousness creates the world as name and form (&quot;nama-rupa&quot;) and then enters it. However, in this process, consciousness also hides from itself, losing sight of its real identity. The Buddhist view of consciousness entering name and form depicts a similar chain of events leading to deeper ignorance and entanglement with the world.

Jurewizc further argues that the rest of the twelve nidanas show similarities with the terms and ideas found in Vedic cosmogeny, especially as it relates to the sacrificial fire (as a metaphor for desire and existence). These Vedic terms may have been adopted by the Buddha to communicate his message of not-self because his audience (often educated in Vedic thought) would understand their basic meaning. According to Jurewizc, dependent origination replicates the general Vedic creation model, but negates its metaphysics and its morals. Furthermore, Jurewizc argues that:This deprives the Vedic cosmogony of its positive meaning as the successful activity of the Absolute and presents it as a chain of absurd, meaningless changes which could only result in the repeated death of anyone who would reproduce this cosmogonic process in ritual activity and everyday life.According to Gombrich, the Buddhist tradition soon lost sight of their connection with the Vedic worldview that the Buddha was critiquing in the first four links of dependent origination. Though it was aware that at the fourth link there should be an appearance of an individual person, the Buddhist tradition equated &quot;rupa&quot; with the first skandha, and &quot;nama&quot; with the other four skandhas. Yet, as Gombrich notes, &quot;samkhara&quot;, &quot;vijnana&quot;, and &quot;vedana&quot; also appear as separate links in the twelvefold list, so this equation can&#x27;t be correct for this &quot;nidana&quot;.

===Synthesis of older lists===

====Early synthesis by the Buddha====
According to Erich Frauwallner, the twelvefold chain resulted from the Buddha&#x27;s combination of two lists. Originally, the Buddha explained the appearance of &quot;dukkha&quot; from &quot;tanha&quot;, &quot;thirst&quot;, craving. Later on, the Buddha incorporated &quot;avijja&quot;, &quot;ignorance&quot;, as a cause of suffering into his system. This is described in the first part of dependent origination. Frauwallner saw this &quot;purely mechanical mixing&quot; as &quot;enigmatical&quot;, &quot;contradictory&quot; and a &quot;deficiency in systematization&quot;.

Paul Williams discusses Frauwallner&#x27;s idea that the 12 links may be a composite. However, he ultimately concludes that &quot;it may be impossible at our present stage of scholarship to work out very satisfactorily what the original logic of the full twelvefold formula was intended to be, if there ever was one intention at all.&quot;

==== As a later synthesis by monks ====
Hajime Nakamura has argued that we should search the &quot;Sutta Nipata&quot; for the earliest form of dependent origination since it is the most ancient source. According to Nakamura, &quot;the main framework of later theories of Dependent Origination&quot; can be reconstructed from the &quot;Sutta Nipata&quot; as follows: avidya, tanha, upadana, bhava, jaramarana. Lambert Schmitthausen has also argued that the twelve-fold list is a synthesis from three previous lists, arguing that the three lifetimes-interpretation is an unintended consequence of this synthesis.


According to Mathieu Boisvert, nidana 3-10 correlate with the five skandhas. Boisvert notes that while &quot;sañña&quot;, &quot;perception&quot;, is not found in the twelvefold chain, it does play a role in the processes described by the chain, particularly between feeling and the arising of samskaras. Likewise, Waldron notes that the &quot;anusaya&quot;, &quot;underlying tendencies, are the link between the cognitive processes of &quot;phassa&quot; (&quot;contact&quot;) and &quot;vedana&quot; (feeling), and the afflictive responses of &quot;tanha&quot; (&quot;craving&quot;) and &quot;upadana&quot; (&quot;grasping&quot;).

Hans Wolfgang Schumann argues that a comparison of the twelve nidanas with the five skhandhas shows that the 12 link chain contains logical inconsistencies, which can be explained when the chain is considered to be a later elaboration. Schumann thus concluded that the twelvefold chain was a later synthesis composed by Buddhist monks, consisting of three shorter lists. These lists may have encompassed &quot;nidana&quot; 1–4, 5–8, and 8-12. Schumann also proposes that the 12 nidanas are extended over three existences, and illustrates the succession of rebirths. While Buddhaghosa and Vasubandhu maintain a 2-8-2 schema, Schumann maintains a 3-6-3 scheme.

According to Richard Gombrich, the twelve-fold list is a combination of two previous lists, the second list beginning with &quot;tanha&quot;, &quot;thirst&quot;, the cause of suffering as described in the second noble truth&quot;. The first list consists of the first four &quot;nidanas&quot;, which reference Vedic cosmogony, as described by Jurewicz. According to Gombrich, the two lists were combined, resulting in contradictions in its reverse version.

====Bucknell&#x27;s thesis====
Roderick S. Bucknell analysed four versions of the twelve nidanas, to explain the existence of various versions of the &quot;pratitya-samutpada&quot; sequence. The twelvefold version is the &quot;standard version&quot;, in which &quot;vijnana&quot; refers to sensual consciousness. According to Bucknell, the &quot;standard version&quot; of the twelve nidanas developed out of an ancestor version, which in turn was derived two different versions that understand consciousness (&quot;vijñana&quot;) and name and form (&quot;namarupa&quot;) differently.

According to Bucknell, SN 35.106 describes a non-linear &quot;branched version&quot; of dependent origination in which consciousness is derived from the coming together of the sense organs and the sense objects (and thus represents sense perception). The &quot;Mahānidānasutta (DN 15)&quot; describes a &quot;looped version&quot;, in which consciousness and &quot;nama-rupa&quot; condition each other. It also describes consciousness descending into the womb. According to Bucknell, &quot;some accounts of the looped version state explicitly that the chain of causation goes no further back than the loop.

Waldron also mentions idea that in early Buddhism, consciousness may have been understood as having these two different aspects (basic consciousness or sentience and cognitive sense consciousness). While these two aspects were largely undifferentiated in early Buddhist thought, these two aspects and their relation was explicated in later Buddhist thought, giving rise to the concept of &quot;alaya-vijñana&quot;.

In yet another linear version, dubbed the &quot;Sutta-nipata version&quot;, consciousness is derived from &quot;avijja&quot; (&quot;ignorance&quot;) and &quot;saṅkhāra&quot; (&quot;activities&quot; also translated as &quot;volitional formations&quot;).

According to Bucknell, while the &quot;branched version&quot; refers directly to the six sense objects, the &quot;looped version&quot; and the standard version instead use the term &quot;nama-rupa&quot; as &quot;a collective term for the six types of sense object.&quot; He cites various passages from the early sources and the scholarship of Yinshun, Reat and Watsuji in support. Bucknell thinks that name and form was eventually misinterpreted as referring to &quot;mind and body&quot;, causing discrepancies in the 12 fold series and making it possible to interpret the beginning of the chain as referring to rebirth. According to Bucknell, the linear list, with its distortions and changed meaning for consciousness and name and form, may have developed when the list came to be recited in reverse order. Bucknell further notes that the &quot;branched version&quot;, corresponds with the interpretation of the twelve nidanas as mental processes while the &quot;looped version&quot;, (which sees consciousness as the &quot;rebirth consciousness&quot;) corresponds with the &quot;three lives&quot; interpretation.

=== The 12 nidānas as an early list ===
Against the view that the 12 link chain is later, Alex Wayman writes &quot;I am convinced that the full twelve members have been in Buddhism since earliest times, just as it is certain that a natural division into the first seven and last five was also known.&quot;

Bhikkhu Bodhi writes that the suggestions of some scholars the twelvefold formula is a later expansion of a shorter list &quot;remain purely conjectural, misleading, and objectionable on doctrinal and textual grounds.&quot;

Choong, in his comparative study of SN and SA also writes that the different accounts of dependent origination existed at an early stage and that they are simply different ways of presenting the same teaching which would have been used for different times and with audiences. Choong writes that the various versions of dependent arising &quot;are unlikely to represent a progressive development, with some being earlier and others later&quot; and that &quot;the comparative data revealed here do not provide evidence to support the speculative suggestion that there was just one original (or relatively early) account of the series, from which the other attested accounts developed later.&quot;

===Comparison of lists===
The following chart compares different lists of nidanas from the early sources with other similar lists:
== Transcendental/reverse dependent origination ==
Understanding dependent origination is indispensable for realizing nirvana since it leads to insight into how the process of dependent arising can be brought to an end (i.e. nirvana). Since the process of dependent origination always produces suffering, the reversal or deactivation of the sequence is seen by Buddhists as the way to stop the entire process. Traditionally, the reversal of the sequence of the twelve nidanas is explained as leading to the cessation of rebirth and suffering. The early Buddhist texts state that on the arising of wisdom or insight into the true nature of things, dependent origination ceases. Some suttas state that &quot;from the fading and cessation of &quot;ignorance&quot; without remainder comes the cessation of &quot;saṅkhāras...&quot;&quot; et cetera (this is said to lead to the cessation of the entire twelve-fold chain in reverse order).

According to Jayarava Attwood, while some dependent origination passages (termed &quot;lokiya&quot;, worldly) &quot;[model] beings trapped in cycles of craving and grasping, birth and death&quot;, other passages (termed &quot;lokuttara&quot;, &#x27;beyond the world&#x27;) &quot;[model] the process and dynamics of liberation from those same cycles.&quot; According to Bodhi, these are also classified as &quot;exposition of the round&quot; (&quot;vaṭṭakathā&quot;) and &quot;the ending of the round&quot; (&quot;vivaṭṭakathā&quot;). Beni Barua called these two different kinds of dependent origination &quot;cyclic&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot;. Various early Buddhist texts present different sequences of transcendental dependent origination (&quot;lokuttara paṭicca-samuppāda&quot;) or reverse dependent origination (&quot;paṭiloma-paṭiccasamuppāda&quot;). The &quot;Upanisā Sutta&quot; (and its Chinese parallel at MĀ 55) is the only text in which both types of dependent origination appear side by side and therefore it has become the main source used to teach reverse dependent origination in English language sources. Attwood cites numerous other Pali suttas which contain various lists of dependently originated phenomena that lead to liberation, each one being a &quot;precondition&quot; (&quot;upanisā&quot;) for the next one in the sequence.

According to Attwood, AN 11.2 (which has a parallel at MA 43) is a better representative of transcendental dependent origination passages and better conforms &quot;to the general outline of the Buddhist path as consisting of ethics, meditation and wisdom.&quot; AN 11.2 states that once someone has fulfilled one element of the path, it naturally leads to the next one. Therefore, there is no need to will or wish (Pali: &quot;cetanā&quot;, intention, volition) for one thing to lead to the other one, since this happens effortlessly. Therefore, the sutta states that &quot;good qualities flow on and fill up from one to the other, for going from the near shore to the far shore.&quot; The process begins with the cultivation of ethics, using the following formula which is then applied to each further factor sequentially: &quot;Mendicants, an ethical person, who has fulfilled ethical conduct, need not make a wish: &#x27;May I have no regrets!&#x27; It&#x27;s only natural that an ethical person has no regrets...etc.&quot;

=== Comparison of Lists ===
The following chart compares various transcendental dependent arising sequences found in Pali and Chinese sources:
==Interpretations==
There are numerous interpretations of the doctrine of dependent origination across the different Buddhist traditions and within them as well. Various systematizations of the doctrine were developed by the Abhidharma traditions which arose after the death of the Buddha. Modern scholars have also interpreted the teaching in different ways. According to Ajahn Brahm, a fully correct understanding of dependent origination can only be known by awakened being or ariyas. Brahm notes that &quot;this goes a long way to answering the question why there is so much difference of opinion on the meaning of dependent origination.&quot;

Collett Cox writes that the majority of scholarly investigations of dependent origination adopt two main interpretations of dependent origination, they either see it as &quot;a generalized and logical principle of abstract conditioning applicable to all phenomena&quot; or they see it as a &quot;descriptive model for the operation of action (karman) and the process of rebirth.&quot; According to Bhikkhu Analayo, there are two main interpretative models of the 12 nidanas in the later Buddhist exegetical literature, a model which sees the 12 links as working across three lives (the past life, the present life, the future life) and a model which analyzes how the 12 links are mental processes working in the present moment. Analayo argues that these are not mutually exclusive, but instead are complementary interpretations.

Alex Wayman has argued that understanding the dependent origination formula requires understanding its two main interpretations. According to Wayman, these two are: (1) the general principle of dependent origination itself, its nidanas and their relationships and (2) how it deals with the particular process of the rebirth of sentient beings.

=== Conditionality ===
The general principle of conditionality is expressed in numerous early sources as &quot;When this is, that is; This arising, that arises; When this is not, that is not; This ceasing, that ceases.&quot; According to Rupert Gethin, this basic principle is neither a direct Newtonian-like causality nor a singular form of causality. Rather, it asserts an indirect and plural conditionality which is somewhat different from classic European views on causation. The Buddhist concept of dependence is referring to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co-originate phenomena within and across lifetimes, such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in a certain realm of existence for another lifetime.

Bhikkhu Bodhi writes that the Buddhist principle of conditionality &quot;shows that the &quot;texture&quot; of being is through and through relational.&quot; Furthermore, he notes that dependent arising goes further than just presenting a general theory about conditionality, it also teaches a &quot;specific conditionality&quot; (&quot;idappaccayatā&quot;), which explains change in terms of specific conditions. Dependent arising therefore also explains the structure of relationships between specific &quot;types&quot; of phenomena (in various interlocking sequences) which lead to suffering as well as the ending of suffering.

==== Necessary and sufficient conditions ====
Ajahn Brahm has argued that the Buddhist doctrine of conditionality includes two main elements of the logical concepts of conditionality: necessity and sufficiency. According to Brahm, &quot;when this is, that is; from the arising of this, that arises.&quot; refers to a &quot;sufficient condition&quot; while &quot;when this is not, that is not; from the ceasing of this, that ceases&quot; refers to a &quot;necessary condition&quot;. Like Brahm, Bodhi also argues that there are two main characterizations of conditionality in the early sources. One is positive, indicating &quot;a contributory influence passing from the condition to the dependent state,&quot; while the other is negative, indicating &quot;the impossibility of the dependent state appearing in the absence of its condition.&quot; He compares these two with the first and second phrases of the general principle definition respectively. Regarding the second, positive characterization, other early sources also state that a condition &quot;originates (&quot;samudaya&quot;) the dependent state, provides it with a source (&quot;nidāna&quot;), generates it (&quot;jātika&quot;), gives it being (&quot;pabhava&quot;), nourishes it (&quot;āhāra&quot;), acts as its foundation (&quot;upanisā&quot;), causes it to surge (&quot;upayāpeti&quot;)&quot; (see: SN 12.11, 23, 27, 66, 69).

However, according to Harvey and Brahm, while the 12 nidanas are necessary conditions for each other, not all of them are necessary &quot;and&quot; sufficient conditions (some are, some are not). As Harvey notes, if this was the case, &quot;when a buddha or arahat experienced feeling they would inevitably experience craving&quot; (but they do not). As such, feeling is only one of the conditions for craving (another one is ignorance). Therefore, in this Buddhist view of causality, nothing has a single cause. Bodhi agrees with this, stating that not all conditional relations in dependent arising are based on direct causal necessitation. While in some cases there is a direct necessary relationship between the phenomena outlined in the lists (birth will &quot;always&quot; lead to death), in other cases there is not. This is an important point because as Bodhi notes, &quot;if dependent arising described a series in which each factor necessitated the next, the series could never be broken,&quot; and liberation would be impossible.

==== Abhidharma views of conditionality ====
The Buddhist abhidharma traditions developed a more complex schematization of conditionality than that found in the early sources. These systems outlined different kinds of conditional relationships. According to K.L. Dhammajoti, vaibhāṣika abhidharma developed two major schemes to explain conditional relations: the four conditions (&quot;pratyaya&quot;) and the six causes (&quot;hetu&quot;). The vaibhāṣika system also defended a theory of simultaneous causation. While simultaneous causation was rejected by the sautrāntika school, it was later adopted by yogācāra. The Theravāda abhidhamma also developed a complex analysis of conditional relations, which can be found in the &quot;Paṭṭhāna&quot;. A key element of this system is that nothing arises from a single cause or as a solitary phenomenon, instead there are always a plurality of conditions giving rise to clusters of dhammas (phenomena). The Theravāda abhidhamma outlines twenty four kinds of conditional relations.

==== Conditioned or unconditioned? ====
As a result of their doctrinal development, the various sectarian Buddhist schools eventually became divided over the question of whether or not the very principle of dependent origination was itself conditioned (saṃskṛta) or unconditioned (asaṃskṛta). This debate also included other terms such as &quot;stability of dharma&quot; (dharmasthititā) and &quot;suchness&quot; (tathatā), which were not always seen as synonymous with &quot;dependent origination&quot; by all schools. The Theravāda, vātsīputriya and sarvāstivāda school generally affirmed that dependent origination itself was conditioned. The mahāsāṃghikas and mahīśāsakas accepted the conditioned nature of the &quot;stability of dharma&quot;, but both held that dependent origination itself was unconditioned. The Dharmaguptaka&#x27;s &quot;Śāriputrābhidharma&quot; also held that dependent origination was unconditioned.

===Ontological principle===

====Relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality====
According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, Peter Harvey and Paul Williams, dependent arising can be understood as an ontological principle; that is, a theory to explain the nature and relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality. (Theravada) Buddhism asserts that there is nothing independent, except nirvana. This ontology holds that all physical and mental states depend on and arise from other pre-existing states, and in turn from them arise other dependent states while they cease. These &#x27;dependent arisings&#x27; are causally conditioned, and thus &quot;pratityasamutpada&quot; is the Buddhist belief that causality is the basis of ontology. As Williams explains, &quot;all elements of samsara exist in some sense or another relative to their causes and conditions. That is why they are impermanent, for if the cause is impermanent then so too will be the effect.&quot;

Gombrich describes dependent origination as the idea that &quot;nothing accessible to our reason or our normal experience exists without a cause&quot;. Furthermore, this can be seen as a metaphysical middle way which does not see phenomena as existing essentially nor as not-existing at all. Instead it sees the world as &quot;a world of flux and process&quot;, a world of &quot;verbs, not nouns.&quot;

According to Rupert Gethin, the ontological principle of dependent origination is applied not only to explain the nature and existence of matter and empirically observed phenomenon, but also to the causally conditioned nature and existence of life. Indeed, according to Williams, the goal of this analysis is to understand how suffering arises for sentient beings through an impersonal law and thus how it can also be brought to an end by reversing its causes. Understood in this way, dependent origination has no place for a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self (Brahman) nor any other &#x27;transcendent creative principle&#x27;. In this worldview, there is no &#x27;first cause&#x27; from which all beings arose, instead, every thing arises in dependence on something else.

Though Eviatar Shulman sees dependent origination as mainly being concerned with mental processes, he also states that it &quot;possessed important ontological implications&quot; which &quot;suggest that rather than things being conditioned by other things, they are actually conditioned by consciousness.&quot; This is implied by the fact that form (&quot;rūpa&quot;) is said to be conditioned by consciousness and willed activities (&quot;saṇkhara&quot;) as well as by how grasping is said to condition existence (&quot;bhava&quot;). For Shulman, &quot;these forms of conditioning undermine the realistic ontology normally attributed to early Buddhism&quot; and furthermore &quot;suggest that the mind has power over objects beyond what we normally believe&quot; as well as implying that &quot;ontology is secondary to experience.&quot;

While some scholars have argued that the Buddha put aside &quot;all&quot; metaphysical questions, Noa Ronkin argues that, while he rejected &quot;certain&quot; metaphysical questions, he was not an anti-metaphysician: nothing in the texts suggests that metaphysical questions are completely meaningless. Instead, the Buddha taught that sentient experience is dependently originated and that whatever is dependently originated is conditioned, impermanent, subject to change, and lacking independent selfhood.

====Rebirth ====

===== Analysis of rebirth without a self =====
The view that the application of dependent origination in the twelve nidanas is closely connected with rebirth is supported by passages from the early sources. Both the &quot;Sammādiṭṭhisutta&quot; and the &quot;Mahānidānasutta&quot; specifically mention the factors of dependent origination as being related to the process of conception in the womb. Bhikkhu Bodhi affirms the centrality of rebirth for dependent origination. Bodhi writes that &quot;the primary purpose, as seen in the most archaic Buddhist texts, is to show the causal origination of suffering, which is sustained precisely by our bondage to rebirth.&quot;

Ajahn Brahm agrees, writing that the main purpose of dependent origination is to explain &quot;how there can be rebirth without a soul&quot; and &quot;why there is suffering, and where suffering comes to an end.&quot; Brahm cites the definitions of the nidanas in the &quot;Vibhaṅgasutta&quot; (SN 12.2) which clearly indicate that birth and death is meant literally. According to Brahm,Paṭicca-samuppāda shows the empty process, empty of a soul that is, which flows within a life and overflows into another life. It also shows the forces at work in the process, which drive it this way and that, even exercising sway in a subsequent life. Dependent origination also reveals the answer to how kamma done in a previous life can affect a person in this life. Brahm argues that there are two parallel processes at work in dependent origination (which are really one process looked at from different angles), one is delusion and kamma leading to rebirth consciousness (nidanas # 1 – 3) and the other is craving and clinging leading to existence and rebirth (# 8 – 11). Brahm describes this as follows: &quot;deluded kamma and craving produce the fuel which generates existence and rebirth (into that existence), thereby giving rise to the start of the stream of consciousness that is at the heart of the new life.&quot;

Furthermore, dependent origination explains rebirth without appeal to an unchanging self or soul (&quot;atman&quot;). Paul Williams sees dependent origination as closely connected with the doctrine of not-self (&quot;anatman&quot;) which rejects the idea there is a unchanging essence that moves across lives. Williams cites the &quot;Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta&quot; as showing how dependent origination is to be seen as an alternative theory to such views. According to Williams, dependent origination allows the Buddha to replace a view of the world based on unchanging selves &quot;with an appeal to what he sees as being its essentially dynamic nature, a dynamism of experiences based on the centrality of causal conditioning.&quot;

Bhikkhu Analayo writes that &quot;dependent arising is the other side of the coin of emptiness, in the sense of the absence of a substantial and unchanging entity anywhere in subjective experience. Experience or existence is nothing but conditions. This leaves no room for positing a self of any type.&quot;

According to Eisel Mazard, the twelve Nidanas are a description of &quot;a sequence of stages prior to birth&quot;, as an &quot;orthodox defense against any doctrine of a &#x27;supernal self&#x27; or soul of any kind [...] excluding an un-mentioned life-force (&quot;jīva&quot;) that followers could presume to be additional to the birth of the body, the arising of consciousness, and the other aspects mentioned in the 12-links formula.&quot; According to Mazard, &quot;many later sources have digressed from the basic theme and subject-matter of the original text, knowingly or unknowingly.&quot;

===== Abhidharma three life model =====

In the Buddhist Abhidharma traditions like the Theravāda, more systematized explanations of the twelve nidanas developed. As an expository device, the commentarial traditions of the Theravāda, sarvāstivāda-vaibhasika and sautrantika schools defended an interpretation which saw the 12 factors as a sequence that spanned three lives. This is sometimes referred to as the &quot;prolonged&quot; explanation of dependent origination.

The three life interpretation can first be seen in the &quot;Paṭisambhidāmagga&quot; (I.275, circa 2nd or 3rd c. BCE). It is also defended by the Theravāda scholar Buddhaghosa (c. fifth century CE) in his influential &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; (Vism.578–8I) and it became standard in Theravada. The three-lives model, with its &quot;embryological&quot; interpretation which links dependent origination with rebirth was also promoted by the Sarvāstivāda school as evidenced by the &quot;Abhidharmakosa&quot; (AKB.III.21–4) of Vasubandhu (fl. 4th to 5th century CE) and the &quot;Jñanaprasthana&quot;. Wayman notes that this model is also present in Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharmasamuccaya&quot; and is commented on by Nagarjuna.

The three lives interpretation can be broken down as follows:

* The previous life: the first two nidanas, namely ignorance and mental fabrications. They are basis for the events in the present. Nyanatiloka, writing from a traditional Theravada perspective, calls these &quot;karma process&quot; (kamma-bhava).
* The present life: The third to the tenth nidanas (consciousness, nama-rupa, the sense bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, becoming) relate to the present life. This begins with the descent of &quot;vijnana&quot; (consciousness, perception) into the womb. Nyanatiloka notes that nidanas 3-7 are part of the &quot;rebirth process&quot; (uppatti-bhava) and nidanas are 8-10 are &quot;karma process&quot;.
* The future life: The last two nidanas (birth, old age and death) represent the future lives conditioned by the present causes. Nyanatiloka states these last two nidanas are a &quot;rebirth process&quot;.

Bhikkhu Bodhi notes that this distribution of the 12 nidanas into three lives &quot;is an expository device employed for the purpose of exhibiting the inner dynamics of the round. It should not be read as implying hard and fast divisions, for in lived experience the factors are always intertwined.&quot; Furthermore, Bodhi argues that these twelve causes are not something hidden, but are &quot;the fundamental pattern of experience&quot; which &quot;always present, always potentially accessible to our awareness.&quot;

Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Pratityasamutpada-hrdaya-karika&quot; also outlines the 12 nidanas as a rebirth process. According to Wayman, Nagarjuna&#x27;s explanation is as follows: &quot;the three defilements – nescience, craving, and indulgence – give rise to the two karmas – motivations and gestation – and that these two give rise to the seven sufferings – perception, name-and-form, six sense bases, contact, feelings, re-birth, and old age and death.&quot;&quot;&quot; Vasubandhu&#x27;s presentation is fully consistent with Nagarjuna&#x27;s: &quot;nescience, craving, and indulgence are defilement; motivations and gestations are karma; the remaining seven are the basis (asraya) as well as the fruit (phala).

As outlined by Wayman, Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharma-samuccaya&quot; divides the nidanas into the following groups:
* Nidanas 1, 2 and 3 which cast beings downward into the whirl of transmigration
* Nidanas 4 to 7 represent what undergoes transmigration, &quot;the aspects of the person undergoing phenomenal life&quot; (Wayman).
* Nidanas 8, 9, 10 produce new karma
* Nidanas 11 and 12 are the fruits or results of karma produced previously

According to Gombrich, the &quot;contorted&quot; three lives interpretation is rendered unnecessary by the analysis provided by Jurewicz and other scholars which show that the 12 link chain is a composite list.

=== Mental processes ===
The twelve nidanas have also been interpreted within various Buddhist traditions as explaining the arising of psychological or phenomenological processes in the present moment or across a series of moments.

==== Abhidharma interpretations ====
Prayudh Payutto notes that in Buddhaghosa&#x27;s &quot;Sammohavinodani&quot;, a commentary to the &quot;Vibhaṅga&quot;, the principle of dependent origination is explained as occurring entirely within the space of one mind moment. Furthermore, according to Payutto, there is material in the &quot;Vibhaṅga&quot; which discusses both models, the three lifetimes model (at Vibh.147) and the one mind moment model. Similarly, Cox notes that the Sarvastivadin &quot;Vijñānakāya&quot; contains two interpretations of dependent origination, one which explains the 12 nidanas as functioning in a single moment as a way to account for ordinary experience and another interpretation that understands the 12 nidanas as arising sequentially, emphasizing their role in the functioning of rebirth and karma.

Wayman notes that an interpretation referring to mental processes (referred to as dependent origination with a transient character) can also be found in northern sources, such as the &quot;Jñānaprasthāna&quot;, the &quot;Arthaviniscaya-tika&quot; and the &quot;Abhidharmakosa&quot; (AKB.III.24d). The &quot;Jñānaprasthāna&quot;, explains the nidanas with the example of the act of killing. Ignorance leads to the motivation to kill, which is acted on through consciousness, name and form and so on. This leads to mental karma being generated (bhava) which leads to the movement of the hand to kill (birth).

The different interpretations of dependent origination as understood in the northern tradition can be found in the &quot;Abhidharmakosa&quot;, which outlines three models of the twelve nidanas:
# Instantaneous – All 12 links &quot;are realized in one and the same moment&quot;.
# Prolonged – The interdependence and causal relationship of dharmas is seen as arising at different times (across three lifetimes).
# Serial – The causal relationship of the twelve links arising and ceasing in a continuous &quot;series&quot; of mind moments.

==== Modern interpretations ====
The interpretation of dependent origination as mainly referring to mental processes has been defended by various modern scholars such as Eviatar Shulman and Collett Cox.

Eviatar Shulman argues that dependent origination only addresses &quot;the way the mind functions in samsara, the processes of mental conditioning that transmigration consists of.&quot; He further argues that it &quot;should be understood to be no more than an inquiry into the nature of the self (or better, the lack of a self).&quot; Shulman grants that there are some ontological implications that may be gleaned from dependent origination. However, he argues that at its core dependent origination is concerned with &quot;identifying the different processes of mental conditioning and describing their relations&quot;. For Shulman, dependent origination does not &quot;deal with how things exist, but with the processes by which the mind operates.&quot;

Shulman argues that the general principle of dependent origination deals exclusively with the processes outlined in the lists of nidanas (not with existence per se, and certainly not with all objects). Shulman writes that seeing dependent origination as referring to the nature of reality in general &quot;means investing the words of the earlier teachings with meanings derived from later Buddhist discourse&quot; which leads to a misrepresentation of early Buddhism.

Sue Hamilton presents a similar interpretation which sees dependent origination as showing how all things and indeed our entire &quot;world&quot; (of experience) are dependently originated through our cognitive apparatus. As such, Hamilton argues that the focus of this teaching is on our subjective experience, not on anything external to it. Collett Cox also sees the theory of dependent origination found in the early Buddhist sources as an analysis of how suffering is produced in our experience. Cox states that it is only in later Abhidharma literature that dependent origination became an abstract theory of causation.

A similar interpretation has been put forth by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa who argues that, in the list of the twelve nidanas, &quot;jati&quot; and &quot;jaramarana&quot; refer not to rebirth and physical death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the &quot;emergence of the ego&quot;. According to Buddhadhasa,

Ñāṇavīra Thera is another modern Theravada Bhikkhu known for rejecting the traditional interpretation and instead explaining the 12 links as a structural schema which does not happen in successive moments in time, but is instead a timeless structure of experience.

=== Mahāyāna interpretations ===
Mahāyāna Buddhism, which sees dependent arising as closely connected with the doctrine of emptiness, strongly expresses that all phenomena and experiences are empty of independent identity. This is especially important for the madhyamaka school, one of the most influential traditions of Mahayana thought. The yogacara school meanwhile, understands dependent origination through its idealistic philosophy and sees dependent origination as the process that produces the illusory subject-object duality.

One of the most important and widely cited sutras on dependent origination in the Indian Mahayana tradition was the &quot;Śālistamba Sūtra&quot; (Rice Seedling Sutra). This sutra introduced the well-known Mahayana simile of a rice seed and its sprout as a way to explain conditionality. It also contains the influential passage: &quot;He who sees dependent arising sees the dharma. He who sees the dharma sees the Buddha.&quot; This sutra contains numerous passages which parallel the early Buddhist sources (such as MN 38) and outlines the classic 12 nidanas. It also contains some unique elements such as the figure of Maitreya, the idea of illusion (māyā) and the idea of the &quot;dharmaśarīra&quot; (dharma-body). Numerous commentaries were written on this sutra, some of which are attributed to Nāgārjuna (but this is questionable).

==== Non-arising ====
Some Mahāyāna sūtras contain statements which speak of the &quot;unarisen&quot; or &quot;unproduced&quot; (&quot;anutpāda&quot;) nature of dharmas. According to Edward Conze, in the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā sutras,&quot; the ontological status of dharmas can be described as having never been produced (&quot;anutpāda&quot;), as never been brought forth (&quot;anabhinirvritti&quot;), as well as unborn (&quot;ajata&quot;). This is illustrated through various similies such as a dream, an illusion and a mirage. Conze also states that the &quot;patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas&quot; (&quot;anutpattika-dharmakshanti&quot;) is &quot;one of the most distinctive virtues of the Mahāyānistic saint.&quot;

Perhaps the earliest of these sutras, the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā&quot;, contains a passage which describes the suchness (&quot;tathatā&quot;) of dharmas using various terms including shūnyatā, cessation (&quot;nirodha&quot;) and unarisen (&quot;anutpāda&quot;). Most famously, the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; states:Sariputra, in that way, all phenomena are empty, that is, without characteristic, unproduced, unceased, stainless, not stainless, undiminished, unfilled.The &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; also negates the 12 links of dependent origination: &quot;There is no ignorance, no extinction of ignorance, up to and including no aging and death and no extinction of aging and death.&quot;

Some Mahāyāna sūtras present the insight into the non-arisen nature of dharmas as a great achievement of bodhisattvas. The &quot;Amitāyurdhyāna Sūtra&quot; mentions that Vaidehi had, on listening to the teaching in this sutra, attained &quot;great awakening with clarity of mind and reached the insight into the non-arising of all dharmas.&quot; Similarly, the &quot;Vimalakirti sutra&quot; mentions various bodhisattvas (including Vimalakirti) that have attained &quot;the forbearance of the nonarising of dharmas.&quot; The &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; states that when the &quot;thought of the highest path&quot; arises in sentient beings &quot;they will become convinced of the nonarising of all dharmas and reside in the stage of non-retrogression.&quot;

The &quot;Samdhinirmochana Sutra&quot;&quot;&#x27;s&quot; chapter 7 mentions a teaching which states: &quot;All phenomena are without an essence, unborn, unceasing, primordially in the state of peace, and naturally in the state of nirvāṇa.&quot; However, it states that this teaching is that of the &quot;discourses of provisional meaning&quot;, and that it should be taught along with the teachings of the third turning of the wheel of Dharma. Similarly, the &quot;Lankavatara sutra&quot; explains the doctrine of the unborn and unoriginated nature of dharmas through the idealistic philosophy of mind-only. Since all things are illusory manifestations of the mind, they do not really originate or arise.

==== Madhyamaka ====

In madhyamaka philosophy, to say that an object dependently originated is synonymous with saying that it is &quot;empty&quot; (&quot;shunya&quot;). This is directly stated by Nāgārjuna in his &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; (MMK): Whatever arises dependently, is explained as empty. Thus dependent attribution, is the middle way. Since there is nothing whatever, that is not dependently existent. For that reason, there is nothing whatsoever that is not empty. – MMK, Ch. 24.18–19According to Nāgārjuna, all phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;) are empty of &quot;svabhāva&quot; (variously translated as essence, intrinsic nature, inherent existence, and own being) which refers to a self-sustaining, causally independent and permanent identity. Nāgārjuna&#x27;s philosophical works analyze all phenomena in order to show that nothing at all can exist independently, and yet, they are also not non-existent since they exist conventionally, i.e. as empty dependent arisings. In the very first (dedicatory) verse of the MMK, dependent origination is also described apophatically through &quot;the eight negations&quot; as follows &quot;there is neither cessation nor origination, neither annihilation nor the eternal, neither singularity nor plurality, neither the coming nor the going of any dharma, for the purpose of nirvāṇa characterized by the auspicious cessation of hypostatization [&quot;prapañca&quot;].&quot;

The first chapter of the MMK focuses on the general idea of causation and attempts to show how it is a process that is empty of any essence. According to Jay Garfield, in the first chapter, Nāgārjuna argues against a reified view of causality which sees dependent origination in terms of substantial powers (&quot;kriyā&quot;) of causation (&quot;hetu&quot;) that phenomena have as part of their intrinsic nature (&quot;svabhāva&quot;). Instead, Nāgārjuna sees dependent origination as a series of conditional relationships (&quot;pratyaya&quot;) that are merely nominal designations and &quot;explanatorily useful regularities&quot;. According to Nāgārjuna, if something could exist inherently or essentially from its own side (and thus have its own inherent causal powers), change and dependent arising would be impossible. Nāgārjuna states that &quot;if things did not exist without essence, the phrase, &quot;when this exists so this will be,&quot; would not be acceptable.&quot;

Jan Westerhoff notes that Nāgārjuna argues that cause and effect are &quot;neither identical nor different nor related as part and whole, they are neither successive, nor simultaneous, nor overlapping.&quot; Westerhoff states that Nāgārjuna thinks all conceptual frameworks of causality that make use of such ideas are based on a mistaken presupposition which is that &quot;cause and effect exist with their own svabhāva&quot;. Westerhoff further argues that for Nāgārjuna, causes and effects are both dependent on one another (conceptually and existentially) and neither one can exist independently. As such, he rejects four ways that something could be causally produced: by itself, by something else, by both, by nothing at all. Westerhoff also notes that for Nāgārjuna, cause and effect do not exist objectively, that is to say, they are not independent of a cognizing subject. As such, cause and effect are &quot;not just mutually interdependent, but also mind-dependent.&quot; This means that for Nāgārjuna, causality and causally constructed objects are ultimately just conceptual constructs.

Nāgārjuna applies a similar analysis to numerous other kinds of phenomena in the MMK such as motion, the self, and time. Chapter 7 of the MMK attempts to argue against the idea that dependent arising exists either as a conditioned entity or as an unconditioned one. Rejecting both options, Nāgārjuna ends this chapter by stating that dependent arising is like an illusion, a dream or a city of gandharvas (a stock example for a mirage). Chapter 20 tackles the question of whether an assemblage of causes and conditions can produce an effect (it is argued that it cannot). This analysis of dependent arising therefore means that &quot;emptiness itself&quot; is empty. As Jay Garfield explains, this means that emptiness (and thus dependent origination) &quot;is not a self-existent void standing behind the veil of illusion represented by conventional reality, but merely an aspect of conventional reality.&quot;

==== Yogācāra ====
The yogācāra school interpreted the doctrine of dependent origination through its central schema of the &quot;three natures&quot; (which are really three ways of looking at one dependently originated reality). In this schema, the constructed or fabricated nature is an illusory appearance (of a dualistic self), while the &quot;dependent nature&quot; refers specifically to the process of dependent origination or as Jonathan Gold puts it &quot;the causal story that brings about this seeming self.&quot; Furthermore, as Gold notes, in Yogacara, &quot;this causal story is entirely mental,&quot; and so our body, sense bases and so on are illusory appearances. Indeed, D.W. Mitchell writes that yogācāra sees consciousness as &quot;the causal force&quot; behind dependent arising.

Dependent origination is therefore &quot;the causal series according to which the mental seeds planted by previous deeds ripen into the appearance of the sense bases&quot;. This &quot;stream of dependent mental processes&quot; as Harvey describes it, is what generates the subject-object split (and thus the idea of a &#x27;&quot;self&quot; and &quot;other&quot; things which are not the self). The third nature then, is the fact that dependent origination is empty of a self, the fact that even though self (as well as an &quot;other&quot;, that which is apart from the self) appears, it does not exist.

==== The 12 nidanas in Mahāyāna sutras and tantras ====
Alex Wayman writes that Mahāyāna texts such as &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot; present an alternative interpretation of the twelve nidanas. According to Wayman, this interpretation holds that arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas have eliminated the four kinds of clinging (nidana # 9), which are the usual condition for existence (or &quot;gestation&quot;, nidana #10) and rebirth (#11) in one of the three realms. Instead of being reborn, they have a &quot;body made of mind&quot; (&quot;manōmaya kāya&quot;), which is a special consciousness (&quot;vijñana&quot;). This consciousness is projected by ignorance (nidana #1) and purified by a special kind of samskara (# 2) called &quot;nonfluxional karma&quot; (&quot;anāsrava-karma&quot;)&quot;.&quot; These mind-made bodies produce a reflected image in the three worlds, and thus they appear to be born.

According to Wayman, this view of dependent origination posits &quot;a dualistic structure of the world, in the manner of heaven and earth, where the &quot;body made of mind&quot; is in heaven and its reflected image, or coarser equivalent, is on earth. Otherwise stated, the early members of Dependent Origination apply to the superior realm, the later members to the inferior realm. But the &quot;Śrī-mālā&quot;-&quot;Sūtra&quot; does not clarify how those members are allotted to their respective realms.&quot;

According to Wayman, similar interpretations appear in tantric texts, such as the &quot;Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇatantra.&quot; This tantra contains a passage which appears to suggest that &quot;the first ten terms of dependent origination are prenatal.&quot; He also notes that there is a tantric interpretation of dependent origination in the &quot;Guhyasamājatantra,&quot; &quot;in which the first three members are equivalent to three mystical light stages.

==== Tibetan interpretations ====
Tibetan Buddhist scholars rely on the north Indian works of scholars such as Asanga, Vasubandhu and Nagarjuna in their interpretation of the 12 nidanas. For example, according to Wayman, Tsongkhapa, attempted to harmonize the presentations of the 12 links found in Nagarjuna and in Asanga. Tsongkhapa also explains how the twelve nidanas can be applied to one life of a single person, two lives of a single person, and three lives of a single person.

Discussing the three lifetimes model, Alex Wayman states that the Theravada interpretation is different from the Vajrayana view, because the Vajrayana view places a &quot;bardo&quot; or an intermediate state (which is denied in Theravada) between death and rebirth. The Tibetan Buddhism tradition allocates the twelve nidanas differently between various lives.

Madhyamaka is interpreted in different ways by different traditions. Some scholars accept a version of the shentong view introduced by Dolpopa (1292–1361), which argues that buddha-nature and buddhahood was &quot;not&quot; dependently originated and thus not empty of itself (but empty of what is not itself). The Gelug school which follows Tsongkhapa&#x27;s thought rejects this view, and instead holds that all phenomena are said to lack ″&quot;inherent&quot;″ existence (&quot;svabhava&quot;) and thus, everything is empty and dependently originated. Other Tibetan madhyamakas like Gorampa argue for a more anti-realist view, negating the very existence of all phenomena and seeing them all as illusions. Meanwhile, scholars of the Nyingma school such as Ju Mipham have also attempted to interpret orthodox madhyamaka in a way that is compatible with the view of dzogchen.

====Interdependence====
The Huayan school taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena (&quot;yuánróng&quot;, 圓融), as expressed in the metaphor of Indra&#x27;s net. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing. This philosophy is based on the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; and the writings of the patriarchs of Huayan.

Thích Nhất Hạnh explains this concept as follows: &quot;You cannot just be by yourself alone. You have to inter-be with every other thing.&quot; He uses the example of a sheet of paper that can only exist due to every other cause and condition (sunshine, rain, trees, people, the mind etc). According to Hanh &quot;this sheet of paper is, because everything else is.&quot;

Sogyal Rinpoche states all things, when seen and understood in their true relation, are not independent but interdependent with all other things. A tree, for example, cannot be isolated from anything else. It has no independent existence.

According to Richard Gombrich, the East Asian interpretation of dependent origination as the idea that &quot;all phenomena exert causal influence on each other&quot; does not follow from the early Buddhist understanding of dependent origination. He further argues that this interpretation &quot;would subvert the Buddha&#x27;s teaching of karma.&quot; This is because &quot;if we were heirs of other people&#x27;s deeds, the whole moral edifice would collapse.&quot;

==Comparison with western philosophy==
The concept of &quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot; has also been compared to Western metaphysics, the study of reality. Schilbrack states that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of a metaphysical teaching, by questioning whether there is anything at all. Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered a metaphysical doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.

The Hellenistic philosophy of Pyrrhonism parallels the Buddhist view of dependent origination, as it does in many other matters (see: similarities between Phyrrhonism and Buddhism). Aulus Gellius in &quot;Attic Nights&quot; describes how appearances are produced by relative interactions between mind and body and how there are no self-dependent things. The ancient &quot;Commentary on Plato&#x27;s Theaetetus&quot; also defends a kind of relativism which states that nothing has its own intrinsic character.

Jay L. Garfield states that Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mulamadhyamikakarika&quot; uses the causal relation to understand the nature of reality, and of our relation to it. This attempt is similar to the use of causation by Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer as they present their arguments. Nagarjuna uses causation to present his arguments on how one individualizes objects, orders one&#x27;s experience of the world, and understands agency in the world.

<text>Duane Charles &quot;Bill&quot; Parcells ( ; born August 22, 1941) is an American former football coach who served as a head coach in the National Football League (NFL) for 19 seasons. He came to prominence as the head coach of the New York Giants from 1983 to 1990, where he won two Super Bowl titles. Parcells was later the head coach of the New England Patriots from 1993 to 1996, the New York Jets from 1997 to 2000, and the Dallas Cowboys from 2003 to 2006. Nicknamed &quot;the Big Tuna&quot;, he is the only NFL coach to lead four different franchises to the playoffs and three to a conference championship game.

As the head coach of the Giants, Parcells took over a franchise that had qualified for the playoffs only once in the past decade and had only one winning record in their last 10 seasons. Within four years, he guided them to their first Super Bowl title and won a second championship in Super Bowl XXV four years later. Parcells retired following the second Super Bowl, but came out of retirement in 1993 to become the head coach of the Patriots, another struggling franchise at the time. By his fourth season, New England reached Super Bowl XXXI, although the game ended in defeat. He left the Patriots after their Super Bowl loss and became the head coach and general manager of the Jets, who went from a one-win season to appearing in the AFC Championship Game by his second year.

Parcells retired for a second time in 1999, but returned again in 2003 as the head coach of the Cowboys. The Cowboys made two playoff appearances under Parcells, although both ended in first-round defeats, leading to his third and final retirement in 2007. Following his final retirement from coaching, Parcells served as the vice president of football operations for the Miami Dolphins from 2008 to 2010. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Early life==
Parcells was born in Englewood, New Jersey on August 22, 1941. He grew up in the nearby town of Hasbrouck Heights. His mother, Ida Parcells (born Naclerio), was a housewife while his father, Charles (Chubby) Parcells, played quarterback at Georgetown University and worked for the FBI before becoming a lawyer for Uniroyal Tires.

Prior to his sophomore year in high school, the Parcells family moved a few miles north to the town of Oradell, where he attended River Dell Regional High School. While he was at River Dell, he was routinely mistaken for another boy named Bill. As he had always disliked his given name of Duane, he decided to adopt Bill as his nickname. While coaching the New York Giants, Parcells and his family lived in upscale Upper Saddle River, a New Jersey town which was the home of Giants General Manager George Young as well.

Parcells was an athlete as a youth. At upon entering River Dell, he was large for his age, which enabled him to become a standout player on his high school&#x27;s football, baseball, and basketball teams. His football coach at River Dell was Tom Cahill, who would later become the head coach at Army. His basketball coach at River Dell was Mickey Corcoran, whom Parcells considers to be &quot;next to my father ... the most important influence in my life.&quot; Corcoran would serve Parcells as an advisor and confidant throughout his coaching career.

==Playing career==
Upon graduating from high school, Parcells arrived at Colgate University. As a freshman, he was offered a contract by the Philadelphia Phillies. His father disapproved of a career in sports and wanted him to study law, so the younger Parcells declined the offer. He soon transferred to the University of Wichita (now known as Wichita State University), where he played linebacker and earned a physical education degree. It was here that Parcells&#x27; famous nickname &quot;Big Tuna&quot; took hold. The name itself is a mis-statement of his actual nickname &quot;Tuner&quot;. There were few radio stations in Wichita at the time, so players often trained without music. Parcells, showing the kind of preparation that would make him a successful coach later, frequently arrived early to training sessions, in order to set up a radio. Parcells would try several locations in the gym to get a signal. His diligence and attention to detail earned him the nickname &quot;Tuner&quot;. This subsequently became &quot;Tuna&quot;, likely due to the accents of the New York media who covered the Giants.

He was drafted in the seventh round (89th overall) by the Detroit Lions as an offensive lineman, but was released by the team before playing a single NFL game after he reportedly quit the team after a hot morning workout.

==College coaching career==
At the conclusion of his playing days, Parcells took a close look at his future. He was considering attending law school or becoming a franchise owner for Pizza Hut, where he had worked in college. Instead, he chose to pursue a career in football. He began as an assistant coach at Hastings (1964) before moving on to Wichita State (1965), Army (1966–69), Florida State (1970–72), Vanderbilt (1973–74), and Texas Tech (1975–77). In 1978, he became the head coach at the Air Force Academy for one season.

While serving as linebackers coach at Army, Parcells was also a part-time assistant basketball coach for Bob Knight during the 1966–67 season, which led to their longtime friendship.

==Professional coaching career==

===New York Giants (1979)===
In 1979, Parcells accepted an offer to become the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants under head coach Ray Perkins. However, when his family wanted to stay in Colorado, he resigned and took a job with a land development company in Colorado. While living in Colorado, Parcells became a season ticket holder with the Denver Broncos. Parcells called it the most miserable year of his life.

===New England Patriots (1980)===
Feeling dissatisfied with his life away from football, Parcells returned to the sport in 1980 as the linebackers coach of the New England Patriots under Ron Erhardt.

===New York Giants (1981–1990)===
The following season, Parcells was approached once again by Perkins to join the Giants&#x27; staff as an assistant coach, and Parcells accepted the offer. As defensive coordinator and linebackers coach, he was allowed to change the team&#x27;s 4–3 defense to a 3–4 system. When Perkins announced on December 15, 1982, that he was leaving the Giants at the end of the season to become head coach and athletic director at the University of Alabama, the Giants announced that Parcells would succeed him as head coach.

When Parcells took over in 1983, the team had posted just one winning season in the previous ten years. In his first year, he made a controversial decision to bench Phil Simms in favor of Scott Brunner due to Brunner&#x27;s success in leading the Giants to the 1981 post-season. Also, Simms had missed the entire 1982 season in addition to the latter part of 1981. Brunner struggled and Parcells went back to Simms in Week 6, but Simms broke his thumb and missed the rest of 1983. The result was a disastrous 3–12–1 season during which the Giants surreptitiously offered Parcells&#x27; job to University of Miami head coach Howard Schnellenberger after a week 14 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals; however, Schnellenberger declined, and Parcells remained as head coach.

After this dismal first season, Parcells made a finally healthy Simms the starter again for 1984 and replaced half the roster. The team&#x27;s record improved to 9–7 and 10–6 over the next two years, and earned them their first back-to-back playoff appearances since 1961–1963. In 1986, he led the Giants to the first of two Super Bowls. In the 1986 season, the Giants compiled a franchise-best 14–2 record and the first of three division titles. Parcells, whose stifling 3–4 defense (known as the Big Blue Wrecking Crew) led by Lawrence Taylor, Carl Banks, Harry Carson, and Leonard Marshall, and an offense under the direction of Phil Simms, knocked off the San Francisco 49ers 49–3, and the Washington Redskins 17–0, in the playoffs before routing the Denver Broncos 39–20 in Super Bowl XXI. Parcells is credited as the first coach to be doused with Gatorade at the end of a Super Bowl, which led to a Super Bowl tradition. While there are some claims that Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka had been doused a year earlier, NFL Films president Steve Sabol has stated that he can find no evidence to support it in any footage he has reviewed and that he believes the tradition started with Parcells and Jim Burt.

Following the Super Bowl win, Parcells was courted by the Atlanta Falcons to become the head coach and general manager of the franchise. However, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle would not allow Parcells to break his contract with the Giants and he stayed in New York.

Parcells led the Giants to a second Super Bowl in 1990. The Giants began the 1990 season 10–0, but lost Phil Simms to injury late in the season and finished 13–3. Playing with a back-up quarterback in Jeff Hostetler and a 33-year-old veteran running back in Ottis Anderson, the Giants convincingly defeated the Chicago Bears in the divisional playoff, 31–3. They followed that up with a dramatic, come-from-behind fashion over San Francisco, 15–13, in the NFC Championship game on a last-second 42-yard field goal by Matt Bahr, set up by a Roger Craig fumble caused by nose tackle Erik Howard. Super Bowl XXV proved equally exciting as the Giants used tough defense and a ball-control and power-running Erhardt – Perkins style offense to stop the Buffalo Bills, 20–19, whose own last-second 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood missed wide right. Parcells retired from football after Super Bowl XXV due to health problems.

During his coaching tenure, the Giants secured three division titles (1986, 1989, 1990), had only two losing seasons (the Giants went 6–9 during the strike year of 1987), and tallied an 8–3 playoff record. Parcells, along with former Giants head coach Tom Coughlin, both made the NFL playoffs five times as Giants head coach, and the two Super Bowl titles they each won with the Giants occurred in their fourth and eighth seasons with the franchise, respectively.

===First retirement===
Following retirement, Parcells spent time as a football analyst for NBC Sports from 1991 to 1992, working as a commentator. He also co-hosted a local sports show in New York with Mike Francesa called &quot;Around the NFL&quot;.

In 1992, Parcells made a handshake agreement to become head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. At the last minute, Parcells opted not to take the job. Parcells did not feel the situation was right for him at that time. Buccaneers owner Hugh Culverhouse said, &quot;I feel like I&#x27;ve been jilted at the altar.&quot;

Parcells was also offered by his friend Ron Wolf the opportunity to become the new head coach of the Green Bay Packers in 1992, but Parcells declined, saying that he needed open heart surgery. The job instead went to Mike Holmgren, who would later coach against Parcells in Super Bowl XXXI.

===New England Patriots (1993–1996)===
After a two-year hiatus, Parcells returned to the NFL in 1993 as the head coach for the struggling New England Patriots, who were fresh off of a 2–14 record in 1992. Within two years, he coached the team to a 10–6 record in 1994 and its first playoff game in eight years. In 1996, he guided the Patriots to their first division title in 11 years, and only the second and third home playoff games in franchise history. The Patriots went all the way to Super Bowl XXXI, but lost to the Green Bay Packers, 35–21, in New Orleans.

Parcells left the Patriots after disagreements with owner Robert Kraft, who had bought the team in early 1994, after Parcells&#x27; first year as head coach. Parcells had effectively been the team&#x27;s general manager since arriving in New England, but felt Kraft would not allow him enough input in player personnel decisions. Upon his departure, Parcells famously stated: &quot;They want you to cook the dinner; at least they ought to let you shop for some of the groceries. Okay?&quot; This was mainly in reference to an incident in the Patriots&#x27; war room during the 1996 draft. Parcells wanted to draft defensive end Tony Brackens with their first-round choice, but was vetoed by Kraft. They ultimately selected Ohio State wide receiver Terry Glenn.

===New York Jets (1997–1999)===
Although Parcells had decided to leave New England, his contract did not allow him to coach anywhere else.

The Giants seriously considered offering him his old job as head coach of their organization, but in a dramatic behind-the-scenes event ended up offering the job to Jim Fassel instead.

The New York Jets sought Parcells as head coach and general manager after a 4–28 record under Rich Kotite. To circumvent Parcells&#x27; contractual obligations, the Jets hired Bill Belichick (then the No. 1 assistant to Parcells) as the Jets coach, and then hired Parcells in an &quot;advisory&quot; role. New England threatened legal action against Parcells and the Jets, but NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue brokered a deal between the two sides, with New England releasing Parcells from his contract and the Jets giving New England a third- and fourth-round pick that year, a second-round pick the next year and a first-round draft choice the year after that. Jets owner Leon Hess gave Parcells complete control over football operations, the main sticking point in his dispute with Kraft.

====1997–98====
Parcells again orchestrated a remarkable turnaround in his first year with the Jets. In his first season with the Jets, the team barely missed the playoffs with a record of 9–7 (the Jets were 1–15 the year before Parcells arrived, and had won a total of 10 games in the previous three seasons combined). In 1998, the Jets went to the playoffs with a current franchise-best 12–4 record, which was good enough for second place in the conference and earned the Jets their third home playoff game since moving to New Jersey in 1984 (their first home playoff game was against the New England Patriots following the 1985 season), but they lost to the eventual Super Bowl XXXIII champion Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship game, in which New York had led 10–0 in the third quarter before Denver scored 23 unanswered points. It was the only time Parcells lost a conference championship game.

====1999====
In 1999, expectations were high for the Jets to go to the Super Bowl. However, quarterback Vinny Testaverde ruptured his Achilles tendon in the Jets&#x27; home opener against the New England Patriots and the season went downhill from there. After starting the season 1–6, the Jets won three straight and faced the Indianapolis Colts. Parcells emphasized the importance of not obtaining a &quot;7th loss&quot; but they did lose to the Colts and then to the New York Giants the following week. At 4–8, the Jets were in danger of finishing below .500. The Jets would finish 8–8, but out of the playoffs. In 1999, Parcells retired from football for the second time, vowing that he would not coach again. He picked his assistant Bill Belichick to be head coach, which ended up seeing him resign in favor of Al Groh. Parcells remained with the Jets one more year as general manager until he announced his resignation on January 9, 2001. To date, he is the only Jets coach to leave the team with a winning record after coaching at least two seasons.

===Dallas Cowboys (2003–2006)===
Following three straight 5–11 seasons, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones lured Parcells out of retirement and made him the head coach in 2003.

====Earn the Star====
Always known for deploying psychological tactics and strategies to get the most from his players, Parcells mandated upon his arrival in 2003 that to have the Cowboys star placed on the helmet was a privilege reserved for players that had made the team, not a right, and informed all rookies that regardless of their draft position, it was incumbent upon them to &quot;earn the star.&quot; Jones enthusiastically embraced the idea, and supported Parcells&#x27; decision to have Cowboys equipment managers remove all of the star logos from rookie helmets. Since then, all drafted and UFA (undrafted free agent) rookies that report to the Cowboys must officially make the roster before having the star logo permanently placed on their helmet.

The practice of &quot;earning the star&quot; has become a permanent fixture of Cowboys tradition, with all of Parcells&#x27; successors adopting the practice. As social media emerged, #EarnTheStar and #EarningTheStar became popular Twitter hashtags for Cowboys fans and players.

====2003====
In his first season with the Cowboys in 2003, he led them to the playoffs with a 10–6 record (losing to the eventual NFC champion Carolina Panthers in the Wild Card round), making him the first head coach in NFL history to guide four teams to the playoffs.

====2004====
The 2004 season was one of turmoil. Starting quarterback Quincy Carter was terminated for alleged drug use in favor of 40-year-old veteran Vinny Testaverde, who had been brought to the Cowboys from the New York Jets by his former coach in the off-season. While a favorite of Coach Parcells, Testaverde proved ineffective as a starter. The Cowboys started strong, with victories against the Cleveland Browns and Washington Redskins, but injuries, older personnel, spotty play-calling, and persistent penalties hobbled the Cowboys, and they quickly fell off to a 3–5 record by midseason, finishing the season 6–10.

====2005====
The Cowboys improved their defense before the 2005 season with the additions of first-round draft picks DeMarcus Ware and Marcus Spears. Parcells drafted these players in hopes of jumpstarting the team&#x27;s transition from the traditional 4–3 defense to a 3–4 defense, which Parcells ran in all of his previous stops. Jerry Jones also added a number of high-priced older veteran players, acquiring nose tackle Jason Ferguson and cornerback Anthony Henry via free agency, and linebacker Scott Fujita via the Kansas City Chiefs. On offense, the Cowboys felt the need to upgrade their passing game to complement their top 2004 draft pick, running back Julius Jones, and acquired quarterback Drew Bledsoe via free agency. During his tenure, Parcells made a point of signing players who had played for him in the past, including Bledsoe, Terry Glenn (with the Patriots), Testaverde, cornerback Aaron Glenn, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, and fullback Richie Anderson with the Jets. In 2005, the Cowboys went 9–7, missing the playoffs by one game.

====2006====
In 2006, the Cowboys signed controversial former Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens. Keyshawn Johnson was released and signed with the Carolina Panthers. Owens, whom Parcells never referred to by name, but rather as &quot;The Player&quot;, was fairly successful with the team. In week 7 of the 2006 season, Parcells decided to replace veteran quarterback Drew Bledsoe with fourth-year quarterback Tony Romo. The Cowboys were 6–4 with Romo as the starter. They finished the season with a 9–7 overall record but failed to win the NFC East Division after a 23–7 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Christmas Day in week 16 followed by a loss to the last-place team in the NFC North, the Detroit Lions in week 17. They were able to clinch a playoff berth as the 5th seed in the NFC, eventually losing 21–20 against the Seahawks in Seattle on January 6, on a botched hold by Tony Romo during a field goal attempt.

Parcells would finish his Dallas stint with a 34–30 record and no playoff wins. Parcells&#x27; greatest accomplishment as Cowboys head coach was the development of quarterback Tony Romo. He signed the quarterback in 2003 and helped him develop into a Pro Bowl quarterback by 2006.

===Third retirement===
Parcells would have entered the final year of his contract with the Cowboys in 2007, and had been facing questions all year as to whether he would return to the Cowboys to coach his final season. With his 0–2 playoff record over four years as coach of Dallas, many had begun to wonder if the game had simply &quot;passed him by.&quot; Immediately following the Cowboys&#x27; loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Parcells said that he was unsure if he would return in 2007, and the rumors about Parcells&#x27; future escalated.

On January 9, the &quot;Newark Star Ledger&quot; reported through anonymous sources that Parcells had contacted the New York Giants about their available general manager position, but the Giants were not interested in Parcells&#x27; services. Parcells, the next day, quickly refuted any interest in the position, stating, &quot;There is absolutely nothing to it. Whoever said it is a liar.&quot;

On January 22, 2007, he announced his retirement as head coach of the Cowboys after 4 years, apparently ending his coaching career.

Evidently, there are still questions as to his specific reasons for leaving the game. There were even reports that Parcells had been holding out for more money, and that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones simply did not think Parcells&#x27; performance was worth the money he was demanding for the upcoming season.

After retiring from coaching, Parcells became a studio analyst for ESPN. This was his fourth stint with ESPN, having worked there before accepting the job in Dallas, where he coached both the Dallas Cowboys and a little league team for charity. It was rumored that ESPN offered him a position on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, but Parcells declined the opportunity. (It is also worth noting that ESPN still held a contract with Parcells as a broadcaster even when he coached the Cowboys.)

===Miami Dolphins===
On December 19, 2007, the Miami Herald reported that Parcells had agreed to become the new executive vice president of football operations of the Miami Dolphins. ESPN reported the following day that he signed a four-year contract. Just a day prior, reports linking Parcells to the Atlanta Falcons&#x27; position of vice president of football operations were leaked. However, the following day the Falcons formally announced that Parcells had turned down the offer because of discussions with Miami.

In the first season as executive vice president of football operations, Parcells fired head coach Cam Cameron, general manager Randy Mueller, along with a few assistant coaches, after a 1–15 finish in the 2007 season. With vacancies at the general manager and head coaching spots, he brought in Jeff Ireland to be the general manager and signed Tony Sparano as head coach.

The new front office under Parcells then signed over 20 little-known players in the free-agent market.

In the 2008 draft, they drafted offensive tackle Jake Long with the No. 1 overall pick, along with Phillip Merling, Kendall Langford, Chad Henne, Lex Hilliard, and Donald Thomas. They also signed undrafted free agents Dan Carpenter and Davone Bess.

They also released fan favorite Zach Thomas, who would end up signing with the Dallas Cowboys, and traded star defensive end Jason Taylor to the Washington Redskins for a second-round pick in the 2009 draft.

The Dolphins then went on to sign quarterback Chad Pennington (drafted by Parcells in his Jets days), who was cut by the Jets to make room for Brett Favre.

The Dolphins finished the 2008 season 11–5 and became AFC East champions when Pennington and the Dolphins defeated Favre and the Jets in the final game of the season. They finished with a 10-game improvement from the previous season, making the Dolphins one of two teams in NFL history to accomplish a 10-game turnaround, the other being the 1999 Indianapolis Colts. It was also the first time since 2001 that the Dolphins made the playoffs. However, they were routed in the first round by the Baltimore Ravens, 27–9.

Parcells left the Dolphins in 2010.

===Advisory role with the Cleveland Browns===
On February 12, 2014, Parcells was reportedly interviewed by the Cleveland Browns in an executive capacity, but the two sides could not come to a deal. However, on March 6, 2014, Pro Football Hall of Fame executive Gil Brandt reported Parcells had met with Browns owner Jimmy Haslam as a courtesy consultant. Brandt made another tweet stating that Parcells met with Teddy Bridgewater for hours, leading many to speculate his role with the Browns was as a draft consultant for the front office on the incoming quarterback class leading into the 2014 NFL draft. But when the media contacted the Browns directly, the team denied these rumors.

In an interview with &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, Jimmy Haslam squashed any rumor that Parcells would be joining the front office, saying, &quot;...Bill&#x27;s not going to come work for us, okay? I know that&#x27;s what everyone&#x27;s angling at, but there&#x27;s other people that we talk to too who are knowledgeable in football that will share that too. Somehow the Parcells information just happened to hit the radar screen.&quot; Haslam also mentioned that his and Parcells&#x27;s advisory relationship began in 2013 when Parcells gave some suggestions for their head coaching search.

Since 2014, Parcells has on occasion given advice to the Browns, such as in 2017 when Parcells gave his endorsement to hiring John Dorsey as their new general manager, and in 2018 when he was given the same role as in 2014 by consulting the Browns front office in searching for their next franchise quarterback in the 2018 NFL draft.

== Personal life ==
Parcells was married to Judith Goss from 1962 until their divorce in 2002. The couple, who married when both were still undergraduates at Wichita State, had three daughters, Suzy, Dallas, and Jill. Parcells&#x27;s son-in-law through his daughter Dallas is football executive Scott Pioli, who won three Super Bowls as an executive with the New England Patriots.

<text>Benjamin William Mkapa (12 November 193824 July 2020) was the third president of Tanzania, in office from 1995 to 2005. He was Chairman of the Revolutionary State Political Party (Chama Cha Mapinduzi, CCM).

==Early life==
Mkapa was born in Lupaso, near Masasi, Tanganyika, on 12 November 1938. He graduated from Makerere University in Uganda in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. He went on to study at Columbia University the following year, and earned a master&#x27;s degree in International Affairs.

Previous posts include being an administrative officer in Dodoma and the Minister for Science, Technology and Higher Education. Mkapa was the head of the Tanzanian mission to Canada in 1982 and to the United States in 1983–84. He was the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1977 to 1980 and again from 1984 to 1990, before meeting his best friend Edward Mwassaga. 

==Presidency==

In 1995, Mkapa was elected as president based on a popular anti-corruption campaign and the strong support of former president Julius Nyerere. Mkapa&#x27;s anti-corruption efforts included creation of an open forum called the Presidential Commission on Corruption (Warioba Commission) and increased support for the Prevention of Corruption Bureau. His second five-year term of office as president ended in December 2005. During this term in office, Mkapa privatized state-owned corporations and instituted free market policies. His supporters argued that attracting foreign investment would promote economic growth. His policies won the support of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and resulted in the cancellation of some of Tanzania&#x27;s foreign debts.

He was criticized for some ineffectiveness of his anti-corruption efforts as well as for his lavish spending. He spent £15 million on a private presidential jet, as well as almost £30 million on military aviation equipment from BAE Systems, which experts deemed beyond the limited needs of the country&#x27;s armed forces. It was over the latter purchase that British International Development Secretary Clare Short expressed public outrage, resulting in her becoming known as &#x27;Mama Radar&#x27; in the Tanzanian press.

==Post-presidency==

Having left office due to a two-term limit, Mkapa was dogged by many accusations of corruption, among them improperly appropriating to himself and his former finance Minister Daniel Yona the lucrative Kiwira coal mine in the southern highlands of Tanzania without following lawful procedures. For privatizing the mine to himself, he was accused of a breach of the Tanzanian constitution, which does not allow a president to do business at the state house.

In 2007, Mkapa was part of the African Union&#x27;s Panel of Eminent African Personalities, who were deployed to Kenya to resolve political violence that had broken out due to disputed election results. Mkapa - along with humanitarian and former First Lady of Mozambique and South Africa, Graça Machel and former UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan (Chair) - led the group in mediation efforts that resulted in the signing of the National Accord and Reconciliation Act of 2008.

Mkapa served as a trustee of the Aga Khan University from 2007 to 2012.

==Death==
Mkapa suffered from malaria and treated on 22 July 2020. He died of heart attack in Dar Es Salaam in the early hours of 24 July at the age of 81. Tanzanian President, John Pombe Magufuli, announced his death. The last farewell was conducted by Tanzania People&#x27;s Defense Forces. He was laid to rest in his hometown of Lupaso, Masasi.

In recognition of the role Mkapa played in resolving Kenya&#x27;s 2007/2008 post-election violence, Kenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, declared a three-day period of national mourning following his death, ordering all flags at public buildings and grounds to fly at half-mast.

<text>Los Realejos is a town and a municipality in the northern part of the island of Tenerife, which is the biggest town in the Canary Islands. It is part of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain. The town is located from the north coast, southwest of Puerto de la Cruz, west of La Orotava, and southwest of the island&#x27;s capital Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The inhabitants are known in Spanish as &quot;realejeros&quot;.

The latest population count consists of 37,970 (2013), its density being and the area is . The highest peak is . Los Realejos is the western terminus of the TF-5 motorway. 
==Background==
The town is split into two distinct areas or districts:
*Realejo Alto (Upper Realejo)
*Realejo Bajo (Lower Realejo)

These areas are distinct from each other in terms of their geography (a large deep ravine splits both) and their history (during the Spanish conquest of the island, the indigenous people Guanches had a settlement in the lower area of the town. In contrast, the Spaniards occupied the upper area). Furthermore, each area has its own Baroque church, both of which were built shortly after completing the Spanish conquest. The municipality was originally founded and known as Realejo de Arriba.

The town governed by its local council also includes other smaller villages such as Palo Blanco, Cruz Santa, Mocan, Icod de Alto, and . Over the years, an increase in population and housing have merged into what appears to be one big town nowadays. 

Los Realejos also has a few beaches of note, Playa de El Socorro being the most popular one, not only with the locals but also with tourists. Other beaches like Playa de Castro and Playa de Fajana are worthy of mention, albeit they are slightly less accessible than El Socorro. Los Realejos is the home of the English language newspaper the Tenerife News. Los Realejos boasts the Shrine of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which is the main Marian shrine in northern Tenerife.

<text>Johann Philipp Reis (; 7 January 1834 – 14 January 1874) was a self-taught German scientist and inventor. In 1861, he constructed the first &quot;make-and-break&quot; telephone, today called the Reis telephone. It was the first device to transmit a voice via electronic signals and for that the first modern telephone. Reis also coined the term telephone.

== Early life and education ==
Reis was born in Gelnhausen, Germany, the son of Marie Katharine (Glöckner) and Karl Sigismund Reis, a great baker 
. His father belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran church. Reis&#x27;s mother died while he was an infant, and he was raised by his paternal grandmother, a well-read, intelligent woman. At the age of six Reis was sent to the common school of his hometown of Gelnhausen. Here his talents attracted the notice of his instructors, who advised his father to extend his education at a higher college. His father died before Reis was ten years old. His grandmother and guardians placed him at Garnier&#x27;s Institute, in Friedrichsdorf, where he showed a taste for languages, and acquired both French and English, as well as a stock of miscellaneous information from the library.
At the end of his fourteenth year, Reis was accepted to a Hassel Institute, at Frankfurt am Main, where he learned Latin and Italian. A love of science became apparent, and his guardians were recommended to send him to the Polytechnic School of Karlsruhe. His uncle wished him to become a merchant, and on 1 March 1850, Reis was apprenticed as a paints dealer in the establishment of J. F. Beyerbach, of Frankfurt, against his will. He told his uncle that he would learn the business chosen for him, but would continue his preferred studies as he could.

By diligent service he won the esteem of Beyerbach, and devoted his leisure to self-improvement, taking private lessons in mathematics and physics and attending the lectures of Professor R. Bottger on mechanics at the Trade School. When his apprenticeship ended, Reis attended the Institute of Dr. Poppe, in Frankfurt. As neither history nor geography was taught there, several of the students agreed to instruct each other in these subjects. Reis undertook geography, and believed he had found his true vocation in the art of teaching. He also became a member of the Physical Society of Frankfurt.

In 1855, he completed his year of military service at Kassel, then returned to Frankfurt to qualify as a teacher of mathematics and science by means of private study and public lectures. His intention was to finish his training at the University of Heidelberg, but in the spring of 1858 he visited his old friend and master, Hofrath Garnier, who offered him a post in Garnier&#x27;s Institute.

On 14 September 1859, Reis married, and shortly after he moved to Friedrichsdorf, to begin his new career as a teacher.

== The telephone ==

Reis imagined electricity could be propagated through space, as light can, without the aid of a material conductor, and he performed some experiments on the subject. The results were described in a paper, &quot;On the Radiation of Electricity&quot;, which, in 1859, he mailed to Professor Poggendorff for insertion in the then well-known periodical, &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot;. The manuscript was rejected, to the great disappointment of the sensitive young teacher.

Reis, as Bell would later do, had studied the organs of the ear and the idea of an apparatus for transmitting sound by means of electricity had floated on his mind for years. Inspired by his physics lessons he attacked the problem, and was rewarded with success. In 1860, he constructed the first prototype of a telephone, which could cover a distance of 100 meters. In 1862, he again tried to interest Poggendorff with an account of his &quot;telephone&quot;, as he called it. His second offering was also rejected, like the first. The learned professor, it seems, regarded the transmission of speech by electricity as a chimera; Reis bitterly attributed the failure to his being &quot;only a poor schoolmaster.&quot;

Reis had difficulty interesting people in Germany in his invention despite demonstrating it to (among others) Wilhelm von Legat, Inspector of the Royal Prussian Telegraph Corps in 1862. It aroused more interest in the United States In 1872 when Professor Vanderwyde demonstrated it in New York.

Prior to 1947, the Reis device was tested by the British company Standard Telephones and Cables (STC). The results also confirmed it could faintly transmit and receive speech. At the time STC was bidding for a contract with Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and the results were covered up by STC&#x27;s chairman Sir Frank Gill to maintain Bell&#x27;s reputation.

=== Previous experimenters ===
Since the invention of the telephone, attention has been called to the fact that, in 1854, M. Charles Bourseul, a French telegraphist, had conceived a plan for conveying sounds and even speech through electricity:

Bourseul deserves the credit of being perhaps the first to devise an electric telephone and try to make it; but Reis deserves the honor of first realising the idea as a device to transmit and receive sounds electrically.

Bourseul&#x27;s idea seems to have attracted little notice at the time, and was soon forgotten. Even the Count du Moncel, who was ever ready to welcome a promising invention, evidently regarded it as a fantastic notion. It is very doubtful Reis had ever heard of it. Reis was led to conceive a similar apparatus by a study of the mechanism of the human ear, which he knew contained a membrane which vibrated due to sound waves, and communicated its vibrations through the hammer-bone behind it to the auditory nerve. It therefore occurred to him, if he made a diaphragm to imitate this membrane and caused it, by vibrating, to make and break the circuit of an electric current, he would be able through the magnetic power of the interrupted current to reproduce the original sounds at a distance.

During 1837-38 Professor Page of Massachusetts had discovered that a needle or thin bar of iron, placed in the hollow of a coil or bobbin of insulated wire, would emit an audible &#x27;tick&#x27; at each interruption of a current, flowing in the coil, and if these separate ticks followed each other fast enough, by a rapid interruption of the current, they would run together into a continuous hum, to which he gave the name &quot;galvanic music&quot;. He also found that the pitch of this note corresponded to the rate of the current&#x27;s interruption. These faint sounds were due to magnetostriction. From these and other discoveries by Noad, Wertheim, Marrian, and others, Reis knew that if the current which had been interrupted by his vibrating diaphragm were conveyed to a distance by wires and then passed through a coil like that of Page&#x27;s, the iron needle would emit notes like those which had caused the oscillation of the transmitting diaphragm. Acting on this knowledge, he constructed his rudimentary telephone. Reis&#x27; prototype is now in the museum of the Reichs Post-Amt, Berlin.

=== Shortcomings ===

Another of his early transmitters was a rough model of the human ear, carved in oak, and provided with a drum which actuated a bent and pivoted lever of platinum, making it open and close a springy contact of platinum foil in the metallic circuit of the current. He devised some ten or twelve different forms, each an improvement on its predecessors, which transmitted music fairly well, and even a word or two of speech with more or less fidelity.

The discovery of the microphone by Professor Hughes has demonstrated the reason for this failure. Reis&#x27; transmitter was based on interrupting the current, and the spring was intended to close the contact after it had been opened by the shock of a vibration. So long as the sound was a musical tone it proved efficient, for a musical tone is a regular succession of vibrations. The vibrations of speech are irregular and complicated, and in order to transmit them the current has to be varied in strength without being altogether broken. The waves excited in the air by the voice should merely produce corresponding waves in the current. In short, the current ought to &quot;undulate&quot; in sympathy with the oscillations of the air. The Reis phone was poor at transmitting articulated speech, but was able to convey the pitch of the sound.

It appears from the report of Herr von Legat, an inspector with the Royal Prussian Telegraphs, which was published in 1862, that Reis was quite aware of this principle, but his instrument was not well adapted to apply it. No doubt the platinum contacts he employed in the transmitter behaved to some extent as a crude metal microphone, and hence a few words, especially familiar or expected ones, could be transmitted and distinguished at the other end of the line. If Reis&#x27; phone was adjusted so the contact points made a &quot;loose metallic contact&quot;, they would function much like the later telephone invented by Berliner or the Hughes microphone, one form of which had iron nails in loose contact. Thus the Reis phone worked best for speech when it was slightly out of adjustment.

A history of the telephone from 1910 records that, &quot;In the course of the Dolbear lawsuit, a Reis machine was brought into court, and created much amusement. It was able to squeak, but not to speak. Experts and professors wrestled with it in vain. It refused to transmit one intelligible sentence. ‘It can speak, but it won&#x27;t,’ explained one of Dolbear&#x27;s lawyers.&quot; It is now generally known that while a Reis machine, when clogged and out of order, would transmit a word or two in an imperfect way, it was built on the wrong lines. It was no more a telephone than a wagon is a sleigh, even though it is possible to chain the wheels and make them slide for a foot or two. Said Judge Lowell, in rendering his famous decision:

Reis does not seem to have realised the importance of not entirely breaking the circuit of the current; at all events, his metal spring was not practical for this, for it allowed the metal contacts to jolt too far apart, and thus interrupt the electric current.

His experiments were made in a little workshop behind his home at Friedrichsdorf; and wires were run from it to an upper chamber. Another line was erected between the physical cabinet at Garnier&#x27;s Institute across the playground to one of the classrooms, and there was a tradition in the school that the boys were afraid of creating an uproar in the room for fear that Philipp Reis would hear them with his &quot;telephon&quot;.

=== Publication ===

Reis&#x27; new invention was articulated in a lecture before the Physical Society of Frankfurt on 26 October 1861, and a description, written by himself for &quot;Jahresbericht&quot; a month or two later. It created a good deal of scientific excitement in Germany; models of it were sent abroad, to London, Dublin, Tiflis, and other places. It became a subject for popular lectures, and an article for scientific cabinets.

Reis obtained brief renown, but rejection soon set in. The Physical Society of Frankfurt turned its back on the apparatus which had given it lustre. Reis resigned in 1867, but the Free German Institute of Frankfurt, which elected him as an honorary member, also slighted the instrument as a mere &quot;philosophical toy&quot;.

Reis believed in his invention, even if no one else did; and had he been encouraged by his peers from the beginning he might have perfected it. He was already stricken with tuberculosis, however. After Reis gave a lecture on the telephone at Gießen in 1854, Poggendorff, who was present, invited him to send a description of his instrument to the &quot;Annalen&quot;. Reis, it is said, replied: &quot;Ich danke Ihnen sehr, Herr Professor, aber es ist zu spät. Jetzt will ich ihn nicht schicken. Mein Apparat wird ohne Beschreibung in den &quot;Annalen&quot; bekannt werden&quot; (&quot;Thank you very much, Professor, but it is too late. Now &quot;I&quot; do not want to send it. My apparatus will become known without any description in the &quot;Annalen&quot;.&quot;)

== Final days ==
Later, Reis continued his teaching and scientific studies, but his failing health had become a serious impediment. For several years it was only by the exercise of his strong will that he was able to carry on with his duties. His voice began to fail as his lung disease became more pronounced, and in the summer of 1873, he was obliged to forsake his tutoring duties for several weeks. An autumn vacation strengthened his hopes of recovery and he resumed his teaching, but it was to be the last flicker of his expiring flame. It was announced that he would show his new gravity-machine at a meeting of the &quot;Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und Ärzte&quot; (Society of German Scientists and Physicians) of Wiesbaden in September, but he was too ill to appear. In December he lay down and, after a long and painful illness, died at five o&#x27;clock in the afternoon of 14 January 1874.

In his Curriculum Vitae he wrote:
Philipp Reis was buried in the cemetery of Friedrichsdorf, and in 1878, after the introduction of the electric telephone, the members of the Physical Society of Frankfurt erected an obelisk of red sandstone bearing a medallion portrait over his grave.

== Recognition and technological assessment ==

In 1878, four years after his death and two years after Bell received his first telephone patent, European scientists dedicated a monument to Philip Reis as the inventor of the telephone.

Documents of 1947 in London&#x27;s Science Museum later showed that after their technical adjustments, engineers from the British firm Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) found Reis&#x27; telephone dating from 1863 could transmit and &quot;reproduce speech of good quality, but of low efficiency&quot;.

Sir Frank Gill, then chairman of STC, ordered the tests to be kept secret, as STC was then negotiating with AT&amp;T, which had evolved from the Bell Telephone Company, created by Alexander Graham Bell. Professor Bell was generally accepted as having invented the telephone and Gill thought that evidence to the contrary might disrupt the ongoing negotiations.

=== Johann-Philipp-Reis Preis (Award) ===

The VDE (the German electrical engineering association), Deutsche Telekom and the cities of Friedrichsdorf and Gelnhausen biannually present the &quot;Johann-Philipp-Reis Preis&quot; (prize) to scientists for &quot;...distinguished scientific achievements in the area of communication technology&quot;.

== Telephone invention controversies ==
Besides Reis and Bell, many others claimed to have invented the telephone. The result was the Gray-Bell telephone controversy, one of the United States&#x27; longest-running patent interference cases, involving Bell, Thomas Alva Edison, Elisha Gray, Emil Berliner, Amos Dolbear, J. W. McDonagh, G. B. Richmond, W. L. Voeker, J. H. Irwin, and Francis Blake Jr. The case started in 1878 and was not finalised until 27 February 1901. Bell and the Bell Telephone Company triumphed in this crucial decision, as well as every one of the over 600 other court decisions related to the invention of the telephone. The Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage.

Another controversy arose over a century later when the U.S. Congress passed a resolution in 2002 recognizing Italian-American Antonio Meucci&#x27;s contributions &quot;in&quot; the invention of the telephone (not for the invention of the telephone), a declaration that bore no legal or other standing at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Canada&#x27;s Parliament quickly followed with a tit-for-tat declaration, which clarified: &quot;...that Alexander Graham Bell of Brantford, Ont., and Baddeck, N.S., [was] the inventor of the telephone.&quot; Prior to his death, Meucci had lost his only concluded Federal lawsuit trial related to the telephone&#x27;s invention.

<doc id="305050" wikidata="Q407936" url="?curid=305050" title="Trichloroethylene">
<text>Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a halocarbon with the formula C2HCl3, commonly used as an industrial metal degreasing solvent. It is a clear, colourless, non-flammable, volatile liquid with a chloroform-like pleasant mild smell and sweet taste. Its IUPAC name is trichloroethene. Trichloroethylene has been sold under a variety of trade names. Industrial abbreviations include TCE, trichlor, Trike, Tricky and tri. Under the trade names Trimar and Trilene, it was used as a volatile anesthetic and as an inhaled obstetrical analgesic. It should not be confused with the similar 1,1,1-trichloroethane, which was commonly known as &quot;chlorothene&quot;.

==History==
The earliest record of trichloroethylene synthesis dates back to 1836. It was obtained from the action of potassium hydroxide on 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane by Auguste Laurent and notated as (then the atomic weight of carbon was thought to be the half of it really was). Laurent named it &quot;chlorétherise&quot; but did not investigate the compound further.

Trichloroethylene&#x27;s discovery is widely attributed to E. Fischer who made it in 1864 via the reduction of hexachloroethane with hydrogen. Fischer investigated TCE and noted its boiling point as between 87 and 90 degrees Celsius. Commercial production began in Germany, in 1920 and in the US in 1925.

The use of trichloroethylene in the food and pharmaceutical industries has been banned in much of the world since the 1970s due to concerns about its toxicity. Legislation has forced the replacement of trichloroethylene in many processes in Europe as the chemical was classified as a carcinogen carrying an R45 risk phrase, &quot;May cause cancer&quot;. Many degreasing chemical alternatives are being promoted such as Ensolv and Leksol; however, each of these is based on &quot;n&quot;-propyl bromide which carries an R60 risk phrase of &quot;May impair fertility&quot;, and would not be a legally acceptable substitute.
===Anaesthesia===
Trichloroethylene is a good analgesic at 0.35 to 0.5% concentrations. Trichloroethylene was used in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia beginning in 1916.

Pioneered by Imperial Chemical Industries in Britain, under the trade name &quot;Trilene&quot; (from &quot;tri&quot;chloroethy&quot;lene&quot;) , its development was hailed as an anesthetic revolution. It was mostly known as &quot;Trimar&quot; in the United States. The &quot;–mar&quot; suffix indicates study and development at the University of Maryland, e.g., &quot;Fluoromar&quot; for fluroxene and &quot;Vinamar&quot; for ethyl vinyl ether&quot;. From the 1940s through the 1980s, both in Europe and North America, trichloroethylene was used as a volatile anesthetic almost invariably administered with nitrous oxide. Marketed in the UK by Imperial Chemical Industries under the trade name &quot;Trilene&quot; it was coloured blue (with a dye called waxoline blue in 1:200,000 concentration) to avoid confusion with the similar-smelling chloroform. &quot;Trilene&quot; was stabilised with 0.01% thymol. 

Originally thought to possess less hepatotoxicity than chloroform, and without the unpleasant pungency and flammability of ether, TCE replaced earlier anesthetics chloroform and ether in the 1940s. TCE use was nonetheless soon found to have several pitfalls. These included promotion of cardiac arrhythmias, low volatility and high solubility preventing quick anesthetic induction, reactions with soda lime used in carbon dioxide absorbing systems, prolonged neurologic dysfunction when used with soda lime, and evidence of hepatotoxicity as had been found with chloroform. Alkali components of carbon dioxide absorbers reacted with trichloroethylene and released dichloroacetylene, a neurotoxin.

The introduction of halothane in 1956 greatly diminished the use of TCE as a general anesthetic in the 1960s, as halothane allowed much faster induction and recovery times and was considerably easier to administer. Trichloroethylene has been used in the production of halothane.
 

Trilene was also used as an inhaled analgesic, mainly during childbirth, often self-applied by the patient. Trichloroethylene was introduced for obstetrical anaesthesia in 1943, and used until the 1980s. Its anaesthetic use was banned in the United States in 1977 but the anaesthetic use in the United Kingdom remained until the late 1980s (especially for childbirth). Fetal toxicity and concerns about the carcinogenic potential of TCE led to its abandonment in developed countries by the 1980s. TCE was used with halothane in the tri-service field anaesthetic apparatus used by the UK armed forces under field conditions. , TCE was still in use as an anesthetic in Africa.

== Production ==
Today, most trichloroethylene is produced from ethylene. First, ethylene is chlorinated over a ferric chloride catalyst to produce 1,2-dichloroethane:

:CH2=CH2 + Cl2 → ClCH2CH2Cl

When heated to around 400 °C with additional chlorine, 1,2-dichloroethane is converted to trichloroethylene:

:ClCH2CH2Cl + 2 Cl2 → ClCH=CCl2 + 3 HCl

This reaction can be catalyzed by a variety of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminum chloride. However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used. This reaction produces tetrachloroethylene as a byproduct and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are collected together and then separated by distillation.

Prior to the early 1970s, however, most trichloroethylene was produced in a two-step process from acetylene. First, acetylene was treated with chlorine using a ferric chloride catalyst at 90 °C to produce 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane according to the chemical equation:

:HC≡CH + 2 Cl2 → Cl2CHCHCl2

The 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane is then dehydrochlorinated to give trichloroethylene. This can be accomplished either with an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide:

:2 Cl2CHCHCl2 + Ca(OH)2 → 2 ClCH=CCl2 + CaCl2 + 2 H2O

or in the vapor phase by heating it to 300–500 °C on a barium chloride or calcium chloride catalyst:

:Cl2CHCHCl2 → ClCH=CCl2 + HCl

Common impurities in reagent and technical grade TCE are methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, ethylene dichloride, tetrachloroethanes, benzene and phenol. However, these compounds are present in very small amounts and do not possess any risk.

== Uses ==
Trichloroethylene is an effective solvent for a variety of organic materials. It is mainly used for cleaning. Trichloroethylene is an active ingredient (solvent) in various printing ink, varnish and industrial paint formulations. Other uses include dyeing and finishing operations, adhesive formulations, rubber processing, adhesives, lacquers, and paint strippers. It is applied before plating, anodizing, and painting.

When trichloroethylene was first widely produced in the 1920s, its major use was to extract vegetable oils from plant materials such as soy, coconut, and palm. Other uses in the food industry included coffee decaffeination (removal of caffeine) and the preparation of flavoring extracts from hops and spices. TCE was used a freezing point depressant in carbon tetrachloride fire extinguishers.

Trichloroethylene is also a chain terminator for polyvinyl chloride. Chlorination gives pentachloroethane.

===Cleaning solvent===
TCE has also been used as a dry cleaning solvent, although mostly replaced by tetrachloroethylene, except for spot cleaning where it is still used under the trade name Picrin.

Perhaps the greatest use of TCE is as a degreaser for metal parts. It has been widely used in degreasing and cleaning since the 1920s because of its low cost, low flammability, low toxicity and high effectivity as a solvent. The demand for TCE as a degreaser began to decline in the 1950s in favor of the less toxic 1,1,1-trichloroethane. However, 1,1,1-trichloroethane production has been phased out in most of the world under the terms of the Montreal Protocol due to its contribution to the ozone depletion. As a result, trichloroethylene has experienced some resurgence in use as a degreaser.

Trichloroethylene is used to remove grease and lanolin from wool before weaving.

TCE has also been used in the United States to clean kerosene-fueled rocket engines (TCE was not used to clean hydrogen-fueled engines such as the Space Shuttle Main Engine). During static firing, the RP-1 fuel would leave hydrocarbon deposits and vapors in the engine. These deposits had to be flushed from the engine to avoid the possibility of explosion during engine handling and future firing. TCE was used to flush the engine&#x27;s fuel system immediately before and after each test firing. The flushing procedure involved pumping TCE through the engine&#x27;s fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30–35 minutes, depending upon the engine. For some engines, the engine&#x27;s gas generator and liquid oxygen (LOX) dome were also flushed with TCE before test firing. The F-1 rocket engine had its LOX dome, gas generator, and thrust chamber fuel jacket flushed with TCE during launch preparations.

===Refrigerants===
TCE is also used in the manufacture of a range of fluorocarbon refrigerants such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane more commonly known as HFC 134a. TCE was also used in industrial refrigeration applications due to its high heat transfer capabilities and its low-temperature specification.

==Safety==
===Chemical instability===
Despite its widespread use as a metal degreaser, trichloroethylene itself is unstable in the presence of metal over prolonged exposure. As early as 1961 this phenomenon was recognized by the manufacturing industry when stabilizing additives were added to the commercial formulation. Since the reactive instability is accentuated by higher temperatures, the search for stabilizing additives was conducted by heating trichloroethylene to its boiling point under a reflux condenser and observing decomposition. Definitive documentation of 1,4-dioxane as a stabilizing agent for TCE is scant due to the lack of specificity in early patent literature describing TCE formulations. Epichlorohydrin, butylene oxide, &quot;N&quot;-methylpyrrole and ethyl acetate are common stabilisers for TCE, with epichlorohydrin being the most persistent and effective. Other chemical stabilizers include ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone.
===Physiological effects===
When inhaled, trichloroethylene produces central nervous system depression resulting in general anesthesia. These effects may be mediated by trichloroethylene acting as a positive allosteric modulator of inhibitory GABAA and glycine receptors. Its high blood solubility results in a less desirable slower induction of anesthesia. At low concentrations, it is relatively non-irritating to the respiratory tract. Higher concentrations result in tachypnea. Many types of cardiac arrhythmias can occur and are exacerbated by epinephrine (adrenaline). It was noted in the 1940s that TCE reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbing systems (soda lime) to produce dichloroacetylene by dehydrochlorination and phosgene. Cranial nerve dysfunction (especially the fifth cranial nerve) was common when TCE anesthesia was given using CO2 absorbing systems. Muscle relaxation with TCE anesthesia sufficient for surgery was poor. For these reasons as well as problems with hepatotoxicity, TCE lost popularity in North America and Europe to more potent anesthetics such as halothane by the 1960s.

The symptoms of acute non-medical exposure are similar to those of alcohol intoxication, beginning with headache, dizziness, and confusion and progressing with increasing exposure to unconsciousness. Much of what is known about the chronic human health effects of trichloroethylene is based on occupational exposures. Besides the effects to the central nervous system, workplace exposure to trichloroethylene has been associated with toxic effects in the liver and kidney. A history of long-term exposure to high concentrations of trichloroethylene is a suspected environmental risk of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

====Metabolism====
Trichloroethylene is metabolised to trichloroepoxyethane (TCE oxide) which rapidly isomerises to trichloroacetaldehyde (chloral). Chloral hydrates to chloral hydrate in the body. Chloral hydrate is either reduced to 2,2,2-trichloroethanol or oxidised to trichloroacetic acid. Monochloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid and trichloromethane were also detected as minor metabolites of TCE.

=== Exposure and regulations ===

With a specific gravity greater than 1 (denser than water), trichloroethylene can be present as a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) if sufficient quantities are spilt in the environment.

The first known report of TCE in groundwater was given in 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE. Based on available federal and state surveys, between 9% and 34% of the drinking water supply sources tested in the US may have some TCE contamination, though EPA has reported that most water supplies comply with the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 5 ppb.

Generally, atmospheric levels of TCE are highest in areas of concentrated industry and population. Atmospheric levels tend to be lowest in rural and remote regions. Average TCE concentrations measured in air across the United States are generally between 0.01 ppb and 0.3 ppb, although mean levels as high as 3.4 ppb have been reported. TCE levels in the low parts per billion range have been measured in food; however, levels as high as 140 ppb were measured in a few samples of food. TCE levels above background have been found in homes undergoing renovation.

==== Existing regulations ====

State, federal, and international agencies classify trichloroethylene as a known or probable carcinogen for humans. In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer updated its classification of trichloroethylene to Group 1, indicating that sufficient evidence exists that it can cause cancer of the kidney in humans as well as some evidence of cancer of the liver and non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma.

In the European Union, the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values (SCOEL) recommends an exposure limit for workers exposed to trichloroethylene of 10 ppm (54.7 mg/m3) for 8-hour TWA and of 30 ppm (164.1 mg/m3) for STEL (15 minutes).

Existing EU legislation aimed at protection of workers against risks to their health (including Chemical Agents Directive 98/24/EC and Carcinogens Directive 2004/37/EC) currently do not impose binding minimum requirements for controlling risks to workers&#x27; health during the use phase or throughout the life cycle of trichloroethylene.

In 2023, the United States United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that trichloroethylene presents a risk of injury to human health in various uses, including during manufacturing, processing, mixing, recycling, vapor degreasing, as a lubricant, adhesive, sealant, cleaning product, and spray. It is dangerous from both inhalation and dermal exposure and was most strongly associated with immunosuppressive effects for acute exposure, as well as autoimmune effects for chronic exposures. Chronic exposure to trichloroethylene has also been linked to an increased risk of Parkinson&#x27;s Disease. As of June 1, 2023, two U.S. states (Minnesota and New York) have acted on the EPA&#x27;s findings and banned trichloroethylene in all cases but research and development. According to the US EPA, in October 2023 it &quot;proposed to ban the manufacture (including import), processing, and distribution in commerce of TCE for all uses, with longer compliance time frames and workplace controls (including an exposure limit) for some processing and industrial and commercial uses until the prohibitions come into effect&quot; to &quot;protect everyone including bystanders from the harmful health effects of TCE&quot;. Following the EPA&#x27;s recommendation the Biden Administration announced a proposal to ban trichloroethylene later that month. In December 2024 the EPA issued a final ruling on the regulation of trichloroethylene, with the rule taking effect on January 16, 2025. The rule bans the manufacture (including import), processing, and distribution in commerce of trichloroethylene for all uses, with longer compliance timeframes and stringent worker protections for some processing and industrial and commercial uses until the prohibitions come into effect. The EPA is prohibiting most uses of trichloroethylene within one year of the rule taking effect including manufacture and processing for most commercial and all consumer products, with only a limited number of commercial uses being allowed after January 16, 2026. These uses will eventually be phased out as well, though an exact timeframe hasn&#x27;t been determined yet, but until they have been phased out more stringent worker protections will be required with a lower inhalation exposure limit for airborne trichloroethylene being put in place. Many of the trichloroethylene uses that are continuing for longer than one year occur in highly industrialized settings with critical uses such as the cleaning of parts used in medical devices, aircraft &amp; other transportation, security and defense systems and the manufacture of battery separators &amp; refrigerants. These uses will ultimately be prohibited as well but are temporarily being allowed to continue in order to avoid negative impacts to national security or critical infrastructure, and to allow time to transition to alternative chemicals and methods.

==Remediation==
Recent research has focused on the in-place remediation of trichloroethylene in soil and groundwater using potassium permanganate instead of removal for off-site treatment and disposal. Naturally occurring bacteria have been identified with the ability to degrade TCE. &quot;Dehalococcoides&quot; sp. degrade trichloroethylene by reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; can co-metabolize TCE. Soil and groundwater contamination by TCE has also been successfully remediated by chemical treatment and extraction. The bacteria &quot;Nitrosomonas europaea&quot; can degrade a variety of halogenated compounds including trichloroethylene. Toluene dioxygenase has been reported to be involved in TCE degradation by &quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot;. In some cases, &quot;Xanthobacter autotrophicus&quot; can convert up to 51% of TCE to CO and .

==Society and culture==
Groundwater and drinking water contamination from industrial discharge including trichloroethylene is a major concern for human health and has precipitated numerous incidents and lawsuits in the United States.

The 1995 non-fiction book &quot;A Civil Action&quot; was written about a lawsuit (&quot;Anderson v. Cryovac&quot;) against following the increase in cancer cases after trichloroethylene pollution incidents and it was adapted to cinema in 1998.

TCE has been used as a recreational drug. Common methods of taking trichloroethylene recreationally include inhalation from a rag and drinking. Most TCE abusers were young people and workers who use the chemical in their workplace. The main reason for abuse is trichloroethylene&#x27;s euphoriant and slight hallucinogenic effect. Some workers had become addicted to TCE.

<text>Jan Łukasiewicz (; 21 December 1878 – 13 February 1956) was a Polish logician and philosopher who is best known for Polish notation and Łukasiewicz logic. His work centred on philosophical logic, mathematical logic and history of logic. He thought innovatively about traditional propositional logic, the principle of non-contradiction and the law of excluded middle, offering one of the earliest systems of many-valued logic. Contemporary research on Aristotelian logic also builds on innovative works by Łukasiewicz, which applied methods from modern logic to the formalization of Aristotle&#x27;s syllogistic.

The Łukasiewicz approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s in a series of papers by John Corcoran and Timothy Smiley that inform modern translations of &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009. Łukasiewicz is regarded as one of the most important historians of logic.

== Life ==
He was born in Lemberg in Austria-Hungary (now Lviv, Ukraine; ) and was the only child of Paweł Łukasiewicz, a captain in the Austrian army, and Leopoldina, &quot;née&quot; Holtzer, the daughter of a civil servant. His family was Roman Catholic.

He finished his &quot;gymnasium&quot; studies in philology and in 1897 went on to Lemberg University, where he studied philosophy and mathematics. He was a pupil of the philosopher Kazimierz Twardowski.

In 1902, he received a Doctor of Philosophy degree under the patronage of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, who gave him a special doctoral ring with diamonds.

He spent three years as a private teacher, and in 1905, he received a scholarship to complete his philosophy studies at the University of Berlin and the University of Louvain in Belgium.

Łukasiewicz continued studying for his habilitation qualification and in 1906 submitted his thesis to the University of Lemberg. That year, he was appointed a lecturer at the University of Lemberg, where he was eventually appointed Extraordinary Professor by Emperor Franz Joseph I. He taught there until the First World War.

In 1915, he was invited to lecture as a full professor at the University of Warsaw, which the German occupation authorities had reopened after it had been closed down by the Tsarist government in the 19th century.

In 1919, Łukasiewicz left the university to serve as Polish Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Education in Paderewski&#x27;s government until 1920. Łukasiewicz led the development of a Polish curriculum replacing the Russian, German and Austrian curricula that had been used in partitioned Poland. The Łukasiewicz curriculum emphasized the early acquisition of logical and mathematical concepts.

In 1928, he married Regina Barwińska.

He remained a professor at the University of Warsaw from 1920 until 1939, when the family house was destroyed by German bombs, and the university was closed by the German occupation. He had been a rector of the university twice during which Łukasiewicz and Stanisław Leśniewski had founded the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic, which was later made famous internationally by Alfred Tarski, who had been a student of Leśniewski.

During the start of the Second World War, he worked at the Warsaw Underground University. After the German occupation authorities had closed the university, he earned a meager living in the Warsaw city archive. His friendship with Heinrich Scholz (German professor of mathematical logic) helped him, too, and it was Scholz who arranged for the Łukasiewicz family&#x27;s passage to Germany in 1944 (Łukasiewicz was fearful of the Red Army advance). As it became increasingly clear that Germany would lose the war, Łukasiewicz and his wife tried to move to Switzerland, but were unable to get permission from the German authorities. They thus spent the last months of the war in Münster, Germany. After the end of the war, unwilling to return to a Soviet-controlled Poland, they moved first to Belgium, where Łukasiewicz taught logic at a provisional Polish Scientific Institute.

In February 1946, at the invitation of Irish political leader Éamon de Valera (himself a mathematician by profession), Łukasiewicz and his wife relocated to Dublin, where they remained until his death there a decade later. In Ireland, he briefly served as Professor of Mathematical Logic at the Royal Irish Academy (a position created for him). His duties involved giving frequent public lectures.

During this period, his book &quot;Elements of Mathematical Logic&quot; was published in English by Macmillan (1963, translated from Polish by Olgierd Wojtasiewicz).

Jan Łukasiewicz died on 13 February 1956. He was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, in Dublin. At the urging of the Armenian community in Poland, his remains were repatriated to Poland 66 years later. He was reburied on 22 November 2022 in Warsaw&#x27;s Old Powązki Cemetery.

From October to December 2022, the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin hosted an exhibition on his life and work.

Łukasiewicz&#x27;s papers (post-1945) are held by the University of Manchester Library.

== Work ==
A number of axiomatizations of classical propositional logic are due to Łukasiewicz. A particularly elegant axiomatization features a mere three axioms and is still invoked to the present day. He was a pioneer investigator of multi-valued logics; his three-valued propositional calculus, introduced in 1917, was the first explicitly axiomatized non-classical logical calculus. He wrote on the philosophy of science, and his approach to the making of scientific theories was similar to the thinking of Karl Popper.

Łukasiewicz invented the Polish notation (named after his nationality) for the logical connectives around 1920. A quotation from a paper by Jan Łukasiewicz in 1931 states how the notation was invented:

I came upon the idea of a parenthesis-free notation in 1924. I used that notation for the first time in my article Łukasiewicz (1), p. 610, footnote.

The reference cited by Łukasiewicz, i.e., Łukasiewicz (1), is apparently a lithographed report in Polish. The referring paper by Łukasiewicz was reviewed by Henry A. Pogorzelski in the &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot; in 1965.

In Łukasiewicz&#x27;s 1951 book, &quot;Aristotle&#x27;s Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic&quot;, he mentions that the principle of his notation was to write the functors before the arguments to avoid brackets (i.e., parentheses) and that he had employed his notation in his logical papers since 1929. He then goes on to cite, as an example, a 1930 paper he wrote with Alfred Tarski on the sentential calculus.

This notation is the root of the idea of the &quot;recursive stack&quot;, a last-in, first-out computer memory store proposed by several researchers including Turing, Bauer and Hamblin, and first implemented in 1957. In 1960, Łukasiewicz&#x27;s notation concepts and stacks were used as the basis of the Burroughs B5000 computer designed by Robert S. Barton and his team at Burroughs Corporation in Pasadena, California. The concepts also led to the design of the English Electric multi-programmed KDF9 computer system of 1963, which had two such hardware register stacks. A similar concept underlies the reverse Polish notation (&quot;RPN&quot;, a postfix notation) of the Friden EC-130 calculator and its successors, many Hewlett-Packard calculators, the Lisp and Forth programming languages, and the PostScript page description language.

==Recognition==

In 2008 the Polish Information Processing Society established the Jan Łukasiewicz Award, to be presented to the most innovative Polish IT companies.

From 1999 to 2004, the Department of Computer Science building at UCD was called the Łukasiewicz Building, until all campus buildings were renamed after the disciplines they housed.

His model of 3-valued logic allowed for formulating Kleene&#x27;s ternary logic and a meta-model of empiricism, mathematics and logic, i.e. senary logic.

<doc id="305065" wikidata="Q542039" url="?curid=305065" title="Giovanni Battista Guarini">
<text>Giovanni Battista Guarini (10 December 1538 – 7 October 1612) was an Italian poet, dramatist, and diplomat. Courtier at Ferrara, diplomat and secretary to several ruling families, he served also at Florence and Urbino. He is best known as the author of the pastoral tragicomedy &quot;Il pastor fido&quot;. Written in emulation of Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Aminta&quot;, it was extremely successful and remained the most popular work of secular literature in Western Europe for almost two hundred years.

==Life==
Guarini was born at Ferrara in 1538 of a family of Veronese origin. His father Francesco was the grandson of the famous Renaissance humanist Guarino da Verona. On the termination of his studies at the university of Padua, he was appointed professor of rhetoric and poetics at Ferrara. Soon after his appointment, he published a collection of sonnets which obtained for him great popularity as a poet. In 1567, he entered the service of Alfonso II d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, who sent him on important missions of diplomacy. Unlike his younger rival Torquato Tasso, he seems to have had few difficulties in withstanding the pressures of courtly life. Although his masterpiece, &quot;Il pastor fido&quot; (published in 1590), was completed during a prolonged absence from the Este court, it is generally supportive of existing social structures.

After about 20 years of service, differences with the Duke led him to resign. After residing successively in Savoy, Mantua, Florence and Urbino, he returned to his native Ferrara. There he discharged one final public mission, that of congratulating Pope Paul V on his election (1605). In the late 1580s he was involved in a bitter polemic with Giason Denores, who objected in particular to Guarini&#x27;s mixing of tragic and comic genres in his &quot;Pastor fido&quot;. He died in Venice, where he had been summoned to attend a lawsuit, on 7 October 1612, aged 73.

Guarini was a prominent member of several academies, including the &quot;Eterei&quot; of Padua, the &quot;Crusca&quot; of Florence, the &quot;Innominati&quot; of Parma, the &quot;Gelati&quot; of Bologna, and the &quot;Umoristi&quot; of Rome. He was the father of the scholar Alessandro Guarini and of Anna Guarini, one of the famous &quot;virtuose&quot; singers of the Ferrara court, the three women of the &quot;concerto di donne&quot;. She was murdered by her husband in 1598, with the assistance of her brother Girolamo.

== Work and influence ==

=== &quot;Il pastor fido&quot; ===

His most notable work, &quot;Il pastor fido&quot;, had its first dramatic representation in honor of the nuptials of the Duke of Savoy and Catalina Michaela of Austria in 1585 (published in 1590 in Venice; 20th rev. ed., 1602, Venice; Eng. trans. &quot;The Faithful Shepherd&quot;, 1647). This play, a pastoral tragicomedy about the loves and fates of shepherds and hunters, polished in style, was translated into many languages and became popular during the 17th century. &quot;Il pastor fido&quot; marks the culmination of the pastoral poetry of the Italian Renaissance. It set the pattern for a code of refinement and gallantry that lasted until the late 18th century.

Guarini&#x27;s treatises, &quot;Il Verato&quot; (1588) and &quot;Il Verato secondo&quot; (1593), written in defence of his pastoral drama and subsequently reworked in the &quot;Compendio della poesia tragicomica&quot; (1601), are interesting efforts to justify the legitimacy of the hybrid genre, tragicomedy, which he argued was more in keeping with the aspirations and tastes of the contemporary world than either comedy or tragedy alone.

=== Liric poetry ===
Guarini&#x27;s lyric poems were first published in Venice by Giovanni Battista Ciotti in 1598. Guarini&#x27;s lyric follows the manner of Anacreon, Stesichorus, Catullus and Petrarch as opposed to the more majestic one of Pindar, Horace and Della Casa. His madrigals are particularly remarkable for their musicality and daring metrical structure.

No poet played a larger role in the flowering of the madrigal in the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras than Guarini. His poems were set more often by madrigal composers than the work of any other poet, even Tasso, who came in a close second; the prolific madrigal composer Philippe de Monte even named one of his collections &quot;Il pastor fido&quot; after Guarini&#x27;s most famous work. His popularity was due to his providing texts to composers which were rich with possibilities for word-painting and other easy translations of emotion into music. One of his poems, the erotic &quot;Tirsi morir volea&quot;, recounting the amorous encounter of a shepherd and a nymph, was set to music as a madrigal by more composers than any other pastoral poem of the era, including, among others, Andrea Gabrieli, Gioseppe Caimo, Carlo Gesualdo, Luca Marenzio, Benedetto Pallavicino, and Giaches de Wert. Another of Guarini&#x27;s poems which was set by numerous madrigalists was &quot;Cor mio, deh non languire&quot; (&quot;Dear heart, I prithee do not waste away&quot;).

In addition to his decisive influence on madrigal composers, he was the single largest influence on opera librettists up until the time of Metastasio in the 18th century. He therefore plays an important role in the history of music.

While Guarini&#x27;s work may be seen as lacking the deep feeling and sentiment of another poet at the Este court, Torquato Tasso, it was precisely this quality which commended it to musical setting at a time when excessive emotionalism had become unfashionable. An example of a setting of his work would be &quot;O come è gran martire&quot; from &quot;Libro Terzo dei Madrigali&quot; (1592) by Monteverdi.

=== Other works ===
Guarini&#x27;s other works include a collection of &quot;Letters&quot; (1593), a dialogue on political liberty and the comedy &quot;L&#x27;Idropica&quot; (The Hydropic). Written about 1584 and published posthumously in 1613, &quot;L&#x27;Idropica&quot; had its first dramatic representation in Mantua for the 1608 wedding of Prince Francesco Gonzaga and Margherita of Savoy. The work, modeled after ancient Greek and Roman comedies, aimed to bring a sense of dignity both of a moral and artistic nature back to the genre. Guarini&#x27;s play is a learned comedy in the tradition of Ariosto and Machiavelli. It is considered one of the most noteworthy examples of Late Renaissance Italian comic theatre.

<text>Business cards are cards bearing business information about a company or individual. They are shared during formal introductions as a convenience and a memory aid. A business card typically includes the giver&#x27;s name, company or business affiliation (usually with a logo) and contact information such as street addresses, telephone number(s), fax number, e-mail addresses and website. Before wide use of the internet, business cards also included telex details. Now they may include social media addresses such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Traditionally, many cards were simple black text on white stock, and the distinctive look and feel of cards printed from an engraved plate was a desirable sign of professionalism. In the late 20th century, technological advances drove changes in style, and today a professional business card will often include one or more aspects of striking visual design.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 7 billion business cards were printed around the world every year. The American company Vistaprint indicates sales of the cards dropped 70 percent during the pandemic, but sales have rebounded in mid-2021.

==Construction==
Business cards are printed on some form of card stock, the visual effect, method of printing, cost and other details varying according to cultural or organizational norms and personal preferences. The common weight of a business card varies some by location. Generally, business cards are printed on stock that is 350 g/m2 (density), 45 kg (100 lb) (weight), or 12 pt (thickness).

The advent of personal laser and inkjet printers made it possible for people to print business cards at home, using specially designed pre-cut stock. At first, these cards were noticeably lighter in weight, and the perforations could be felt along the edges, but improvements in the design of both printers and paper have made it possible to print cards with a professional look and feel.

High quality business cards without full-color photographs are normally printed using spot colors on sheet-fed offset printing presses. Some companies have gone so far as to trademark their spot colors (examples are UPS brown, Owens-Corning pink, and Cadbury&#x27;s purple). If a business card logo is a single color and the type is another color, the process is considered two-color. More spot colors can be added depending on the needs of the card. With the onset of digital printing, and batch printing, it is now cost effective to print business cards in full color.

To simulate the effect of printing with engraved plates, a less-expensive process called thermography was developed that uses the application of a plastic powder, which adheres to the wet ink. The cards are then passed through a heating unit, which melts the plastic onto the card. Spot UV varnish onto matte laminate can also have a similar effect.

Full color cards, or cards that use many colors, are printed on sheetfed presses as well; however, they use the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) four-color printing process. Screens of each color overprinted on one another create a wide gamut of color. The downside to this printing method is that screened colors if examined closely will reveal tiny dots, whereas spot color cards are printed solid in most cases. Spot colors should be used for simple cards with line art or non-black type that is smaller than 5 points.

Some terminology in reference to full-color printing:
* 4/0 - Full color front / No print on back
* 4/1 - full color front / One color on reverse
* 4/4 - full color front / Full color back

These names are pronounced as &quot;four over zero&quot;, &quot;four over one&quot;, and &quot;four over four&quot;.

A business card can also be coated with a UV glossy coat (offset-uv printing). The coat is applied just like another ink using an additional unit on a sheetfed press. That being said, UV coats can also be applied as a spot coating - meaning areas can be coated, and other areas can be left uncoated. This creates additional design potential. UV Coating is not to be confused with coated stock, which has a gloss or semi gloss finish that is applied before printing.

Business cards can also be printed with a digital copier, which uses toner fused onto the surface of the card; however, many modern printing firms instead utilise high end &quot;Digital Presses,&quot; now distinct from office copiers, which range from light production units such as the Bizhub 5500 from Konica Minolta, to state of the art units such as the latest HP Indigo Digital Presses.

While some of the older office copiers may have had problems running heavy business card stock, the newest digital presses can print on stock as heavy as 407 g/m2 (150# cover stock), and special substrates such as polypropylene. Available in both sheet-fed and web-fed models, many modern digital presses can emulate Pantone spot colors, print in up to seven colours in one pass, and some even contain embedded spectrophotometers and air-assisted feeding systems.

UV coats, and other coatings such as aqueous coatings are used to speed manufacturing of the cards. Cards that are not dry will &quot;offset&quot;, i.e., the ink from the front of one card will mark up back of the next one. UV coatings are generally highly glossy but are more likely to fingerprint, while aqueous coatings are not noticeable but increase the life of the card. It is possible to use a dull aqueous coating on uncoated stock and get some very durable uncoated cards, and using UV coating or plastic lamination can also be applied to thicken thin stocked cards and make them more durable as well.

When cards are designed, they are given bleeds if color extends to the edge of the finished cut size. (A bleed is the extension of printed lines or colors beyond the line where the paper it is printed on will be cut.) This is to help ensure that the paper will cut without white edges due to very small differences in where the blade cuts the cards, and it is almost impossible to cut the cards properly without. Just being a hair off can result in white lines, and the blade itself will pull the paper while cutting. The image on the paper can also shift from page to page which is called a bounce, which is generally off by a hairline on an offset press, but can be quite large on lower end equipment such as a copier or a duplicator press. Bleeds are typically an extra 3.175 () to 6.35 mm ( in) to all sides of the card.

(US)
* Bleed size: 95.25 × 57.15 mm (3.75 × 2.25 in) ( in bleeds)
* Standard cut size: 89 × 51 mm (3.5 × 2 in)

(UK)
* Bleed size: 91 × 61 mm (3.58 × 2.40 in)
* Standard cut size: 85 × 55 mm (3.35 × 2.17 in)

Fold-over or &quot;tent&quot; cards, and side fold cards are popular as well. Generally these cards will fold to the standard size.

Cards can also be printed with a different language on each side.

==Dimensions==
Aspect ratios range from 1.42 to 1.8. There is no standard for the business card dimensions. Sharing dimensions with other cards makes storage easier, for example banking cards (85.60 × 53.98 mm) and business cards in Western Europe (85 × 55 mm) have almost the same size.

==Global variations==
===Japan===

A Japanese business card is called a . It typically features the company name at the top in the largest print, followed by the job title and then the name of the individual. This information is written in Japanese characters on one side and often Latin characters on the reverse. Other important contact information is usually provided, such as business address, phone number and fax number. Meishi may also contain a QR code to provide contact details in a machine-readable form, but this has not yet become a widespread practice. According to a 2007 survey, fewer than 3% of Japanese people own a meishi with a QR code printed on it.

The presentation of one&#x27;s meishi to another person is more formal and ritualistic than in the Western world. The card should be held at the top two corners, face up and turned so that it can be read by the person receiving the meishi, who takes it by the bottom two corners using both hands. Placing one&#x27;s fingers over the name or other information is considered rude. Upon receiving the meishi, one is expected to read the card over, noting the person&#x27;s name and rank. One should then thank the other person, saying &quot;choudai itashimasu&quot; (&quot;I accept your name card&quot;) or &quot;choudai shimasu&quot;, and then bow. When meishi are being exchanged between parties with different status, such as between the president of a company and someone in middle management, it is proper that the person of lower status extend his or her business card in such a way that it is underneath or below the meishi being extended by the person in a higher position.

Meishi should be kept in a smart leather case where they will not become warm or worn, which are both considered a sign of disrespect or thoughtlessness. A received meishi should not be written on or placed in a pocket; it is considered proper to file the meishi at the rear of the leather case. If the meishi is being presented at a table, the recipient keeps the meishi on top of the leather case until they leave the table. If several people are involved in the meeting and one receives several meishi, the one with the highest rank is kept on the leather case, and the others beside it, on the table.

The manner in which the recipient treats the presenter&#x27;s meishi is indicative of how the recipient will treat the presenter. Actions such as folding the card in half, or placing the presenter&#x27;s meishi in one&#x27;s back pocket, are regarded as insults.

Japanese executives or officials usually has two &quot;meishi&quot;: one in Japanese and intended for fellow Japanese, using the Japanese ordering of names (family name first), and another intended for foreigners, with the name in Western order (family name last).

==Other formats==

Various technological advances made Compact Disc &quot;business cards&quot; possible, which could hold about 35 to 100 MB of data. These business card CDs may be square, round or oblong but are approximately the same size as a conventional business card. CD business cards are designed to fit within the 80 mm tray of a computer&#x27;s CD-ROM drive. They are playable in most tray computer CD drives, but do not work in slot-loading drives. Despite the ability to include dynamic presentations and a great deal of data, these discs were never in common use as business cards, though they are still available.

With handheld computers and smartphones becoming more ubiquitous, business card data is increasingly exchanged electronically via direct wireless connections (e.g. infra-red, Bluetooth, RFID), SMS, specialized apps (e.g. Bump) or via a cloud service (e.g. licobo). Once again, however, these new methods of transmitting business information have yet to completely replace the traditional physical business card.

==Special materials==
Apart from common business cards made of paper/card there are also special business cards made from plastic (PVC), especially frosted translucent plastic, crystal clear plastic, white or metallic plastic. Other extraordinary materials are metal, rubberized cards, rubber, magnets, poker chips, wooden nickels, and even real wood. For the most part those special material business cards are of standard format, sometimes with rounded corners.

==Business card software==
Business cards can be mass-produced by a printshop or printed at home using business card software. Such software typically contains design, layout tools, and text editing tools for designing one&#x27;s business cards. Most business card software integrates with other software (like mail clients or address books) to eliminate the need of entering contact data manually. Cards are usually printed on business card stock or saved in an electronic form and sent to a printshop. Multiple programs are available for users of Linux, macOS and Windows platforms.

==Web-to-print==
In addition to business card software, many printing firms now offer a web-to-print service, which allows the customer to choose from a selection of stock design templates, customize online using their own logos and imagery, select quantities, view pricing options and request them for delivery to home or business addresses. Often this process is applied not only to business cards, but also to letterheads, notepads, labels and compliments slips.

==Collecting==
There are several hundred known collectors of business cards, especially antique cards, celebrity cards, or cards made of unusual materials. One of the major business card collectors&#x27; clubs is the International Business Card Collectors, IBCC. IBCC members exchange cards with other members, simply for the price of postage.

<text>Telepresence is the appearance or sensation of a person being present at a place other than their true location, via telerobotics or video.

Telepresence requires that the users&#x27; senses interact with specific stimuli in order to provide the feeling of being in that other location. Additionally, users may be given the ability to affect the remote location. In this case, the user&#x27;s position, movements, actions, voice, etc. may be sensed to transmit and duplicate in the remote location to bring about this effect. Therefore information may be traveling in both directions between the user and the remote location.

A popular application is found in telepresence videoconferencing, the highest possible level of videotelephony. Telepresence via video deploys greater technical sophistication and improved fidelity of both sight and sound than in traditional videoconferencing. Technical advancements in mobile collaboration have also extended the capabilities of videoconferencing beyond the boardroom for use with hand-held mobile devices, enabling collaboration independent of location.

A similar or identical concept is &quot;telexistence&quot;, which was first proposed by Susumu Tachi in Japan in 1980 and 1981 as patents and the first report was published in Japanese in 1982 and in English in 1984.

== History ==
In a pioneering paper, the U.S. cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky attributed the development of the idea of telepresence to science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein: &quot;My first vision of a remote-controlled economy came from Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s prophetic 1948 novel, Waldo,&quot; wrote Minsky. In his science fiction short story &quot;Waldo&quot; (1942), Heinlein first proposed a primitive telepresence master-slave manipulator system.

The &quot;Brother Assassin&quot;, written by Fred Saberhagen in 1969, introduced the complete concept for a telepresence master-slave humanoid system. In the novel, the concept is described as follows: &quot;And a moment later it seemed to all his senses that he had been transported from the master down into the body of the slave-unit standing beneath it on the floor. As the control of its movements passed over to him, the slave started gradually to lean to one side, and he moved its foot to maintain balance as naturally as he moved his own. Tilting back his head, he could look up through the slave&#x27;s eyes to see the master-unit, with himself inside, maintaining the same attitude on its complex suspension.&quot;

The term &quot;telepresence&quot;, a neologism due to the futurist Patrick Gunkel, was introduced to the public in a 1980 article by Minsky, who outlined his vision for an adapted version of the older concept of teleoperation that focused on giving a remote participant a feeling of actually being present at a different location. One of the first systems to create a fully immersive illusion of presence in a remote location was the Virtual Fixtures platform developed in 1992 at the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Armstrong Labs by inventor Louis Rosenberg. The system included stereoscopic image display from the remote environment as well as immersive touch feedback using a full upper-body exoskeleton.

The first commercially successful telepresence company, &quot;Teleport&quot; (which was later renamed &quot;TeleSuite&quot;), was founded in 1993 by David Allen and Herold Williams. Before TeleSuite, they ran a resort business from which the original concept emerged because they often found businesspeople would have to cut their stays short to participate in important meetings. Their idea was to develop a technology that would allow businesspeople to attend their meetings without leaving the resorts so that they could lengthen their hotel stays.

Hilton Hotels had originally licensed to install them in their hotels throughout the United States and other countries, but use was low. The idea lost momentum, with Hilton eventually backing out. TeleSuite later began to focus less on the hospitality industry and more on business-oriented telepresence systems. Shareholders eventually held enough stock to replace the company&#x27;s original leadership, which ultimately led to its collapse. David Allen purchased all of the assets of TeleSuite and appointed Scott Allen as president of the new company called &quot;Destiny Conferencing&quot;.

Destiny Conferencing licensed its patent portfolio to HP which became the first large company to join the telepresence industry, soon followed by others such as Cisco and Polycom (now called Poly). After forming a distribution agreement with Pleasanton-based Polycom (now Poly), Destiny Conferencing sold on January 5, 2007, to Polycom (now Poly) for $60 million.
A telepresence research project has started in 1990. Located at the University of Toronto, the Ontario Telepresence Project (OTP) was an interdisciplinary effort involving social sciences and engineering. Its final report stated that it &quot;...was a three year, $4.8 million pre-competitive research project whose mandate was to design and field trial advanced media space systems in a variety of workplaces in order to gain insights into key sociological and engineering issues. The OTP, which has ended in December 1994, was part of the International Telepresence Project which linked Ontario researchers to their counterparts in four European nations. The Project&#x27;s major sponsor was the Government of Ontario, through two of its Centres of Excellence—the Information Technology Research Centre (ITRC) and the Telecommunications Research Institute of Ontario (TRIO).&quot;

== Benefits ==
An industry expert described some benefits of telepresence: &quot;There were four drivers for our decision to do more business over video and telepresence. We wanted to reduce our travel spend, reduce our carbon footprint and environmental impact, improve our employees&#x27; work/life balance, and improve employee productivity.&quot;.

Rather than traveling great distances in order to have a face-face meeting, it is now commonplace to use a telepresence system instead, which uses a multiple codec video system (which is what the word &quot;telepresence&quot; most currently represents). Each member/party of the meeting uses a telepresence room to &quot;dial in&quot; and can see/talk to every other member on a screen/screens as if they were in the same room. This brings enormous time and cost benefits. It is also superior to phone conferencing (except in cost), as the visual aspect greatly enhances communications, allowing for perceptions of facial expressions and other body languages.

Mobile collaboration systems combine the use of video, audio and on-screen drawing capabilities using newest generation hand-held mobile devices to enable multi-party conferencing in real-time, independent of location. Benefits include cost-efficiencies resulting from accelerated problem resolution, reductions in downtimes and travel, improvements in customer service and increased productivity.

== Implementation ==

Telepresence has been described as the human experience of being fully present at a live real-world location remote from one&#x27;s own physical location. Someone experiencing video telepresence would therefore be able to behave and receive stimuli as if part of a meeting at the remote site. The aforementioned would result in interactive participation of group activities that would bring benefits to a wide range of users.

=== Implementation of human sensory elements ===

To provide a telepresence experience, technologies are required that implement the human sensory elements of vision, sound, and manipulation.

==== Vision and sound ====

A minimum system usually includes visual feedback. Ideally, the entire field of view of the user is filled with a view of the remote location, and the viewpoint corresponds to the movement and orientation of the user&#x27;s head. In this way, it differs from television or cinema, where the viewpoint is out of the control of the viewer.

In order to achieve this, the user may be provided with either a very large (or wraparound) screen, or small displays mounted directly in front of the eyes. The latter provides a particularly convincing 3D sensation. The movements of the user&#x27;s head must be sensed, and the camera must mimic those movements accurately and in real time. This is important to prevent unintended motion sickness.

Another source of future improvement to telepresence displays, compared by some to holograms, is a projected display technology featuring life-sized imagery.

Sound is generally the easiest sensation to implement with high fidelity, based on the foundational telephone technology dating back more than 130 years. Very high-fidelity sound equipment has also been available for a considerable period of time, with stereophonic sound being more convincing than monaural sound.

==== Manipulation ====
The ability to manipulate a remote object or environment is an important aspect for some telepresence users and can be implemented in a large number of ways depending on the needs of the user. Typically, the movements of the user&#x27;s hands (position in space and posture of the fingers) are sensed by wired gloves, inertial sensors, or absolute spatial position sensors. A robot in the remote location then copies those movements as closely as possible. This ability is also known as teleoperation.

The more closely the robot re-creates the form factor of the human hand, the greater the sense of telepresence. The complexity of robotic effectors varies greatly, from simple one axis grippers, to fully anthropomorphic robot hands.

Haptic teleoperation refers to a system that provides some sort of tactile force feedback to the user, so the user feels some approximation of the weight, firmness, size, and/or texture of the remote objects manipulated by the robot. A new form of technology, called collaborative telepresence, is currently being developed which will eventually be used to collaborate with others while seeming like you are in the same room as the other person, keeping a normal social distance. Collaborative telepresence uses haptic sensors like these to allow a sense of touch.

==== Freedom of movement ====
The prevalence of high quality video conferencing using mobile devices, tablets and portable computers has enabled considerable growth in telepresence robots to help give a better sense of remote physical presence for communication and collaboration in the office, home or school when one cannot be there in person. The robot avatar can move or look around at the command of the remote person. Drivable telepresence robots – typically contain a display (integrated or separate phone or tablet) mounted on a roaming base. Some examples of roaming telepresence robots include Beam by Suitable Technologies, Double by Double Robotics, Ava Telepresence by Ava Robotics, Anybots, Vgo, TeleMe by Mantarobot, and Romo by Romotive.

More modern roaming telepresence robots may include an ability to operate autonomously. The robots can map out the space and be able to avoid obstacles while driving themselves between rooms and their docking stations.

=== Effectiveness ===

Telepresence&#x27;s effectiveness varies by degree of fidelity. Research has noted that telepresence solutions differ in degree of implementation, from &quot;immersive&quot; through &quot;adaptive&quot; to &quot;lite&quot; solutions. At the top are immersive solutions where the environments at both ends are highly controlled (and often the same) with respect to lighting, acoustics, decor and furniture, thereby giving all the participants the impression they are together at the same table in the same room, thus engendering the &quot;immersive&quot; label.

Adaptive telepresence solutions may use the same technology, but the environments at both ends are not highly controlled and hence often differ. Adaptive solutions differ from telepresence lite solutions not in terms of control of environments, but in terms of integration of technology. Adaptive solutions use a managed service, whereas telepresence lite solutions use components that someone must integrate.

=== Transparency of implementation ===
A good telepresence strategy puts the human factors first, focusing on visual collaboration configurations that closely replicate the brain&#x27;s innate preferences for interpersonal communications, separating from the unnatural &quot;talking heads&quot; experience of traditional videoconferencing. These cues include life–size participants, fluid motion, accurate flesh tones and the appearance of true eye contact. This is already a well-established technology, used by many businesses today. The chief executive officer of Cisco Systems, John Chambers in June 2006 at the Networkers Conference compared telepresence to teleporting from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and said that he saw the technology as a potential billion dollar market for Cisco.

Rarely will a telepresence system provide such a transparent implementation with such comprehensive and convincing stimuli that the user perceives no differences from actual presence. But the user may set aside such differences, depending on the application.

The fairly simple telephone achieves a limited form of telepresence using just the human sensory element of hearing, in that users consider themselves to be &quot;talking to each other&quot; rather than talking to the telephone itself.

Watching television, for example, although it stimulates our primary senses of vision and hearing, rarely gives the impression that the watcher is no longer at home. However, television sometimes engages the senses sufficiently to trigger emotional responses from viewers somewhat like those experienced by people who directly witness or experience events. Televised depictions of sports events as an example can elicit strong emotions from viewers.

As the screen size increases, so does the sense of immersion, as well as the range of subjective mental experiences available to viewers. Some viewers have reported a sensation of genuine vertigo or motion sickness while watching IMAX movies of flying or outdoor sequences.

Because most currently feasible telepresence gear leaves something to be desired; the user must suspend disbelief to some degree, and choose to act in a natural way, appropriate to the remote location, perhaps using some skill to operate the equipment. In contrast, a telephone user does not see herself as &quot;operating&quot; the telephone but merely talking to another person with it.

== Related technologies ==

=== Virtual presence (virtual reality) ===

&quot;Telepresence&quot; refers to a user interacting with another live, real place, and is distinct from &quot;virtual presence&quot;, where the user is given the impression of being in a simulated environment. Telepresence and virtual presence rely on similar user-interface equipment, and they share the common feature that the relevant portions of the user&#x27;s experience at some point in the process will be transmitted in an abstract (usually digital) representation. The main functional difference is the entity on the other end: a real environment in the case of telepresence, vs. a computer in the case of immersive virtual reality.

Presence is very similar to distal attribution or externalization which is like projecting one&#x27;s presence and mind beyond the limits of our sensory organs and perceiving the environment in such a way. A distinction is made between two separate perceptions. The first being the unmediated perceptions in which we are unable to feel anything beyond our physical surroundings. The second being the mediated presence through technology which forces us to suddenly perceive two different environments at the same time: The one immediately around us and the one projected for us through technology. Mediated experiences are not limited to virtual technology and can also be experienced with spatially distant places such as space with a telescope or a camera.

== Applications ==

Application examples could be cited within emergency management and security services, B&amp;I, and the entertainment and education industries.

=== Connecting communities ===

Telepresence can be used to establish a sense of shared presence or shared space among geographically separated members of a group.

=== Hazardous environments ===
Many other applications in situations where humans are exposed to hazardous situations are readily recognised as suitable candidates for telepresence. Mining, bomb disposal, military operations, rescue of victims from fire, toxic atmospheres, deep sea exploration, or even hostage situations, are some examples. Telepresence also plays a critical role in the exploration of other worlds, such as with the Mars Exploration Rovers, which are teleoperated from Earth.

=== Pipeline inspection ===

Small diameter pipes otherwise inaccessible for the examination can now be viewed using pipeline video inspection.

=== Remote surgery ===

The possibility of being able to project the knowledge and the physical skill of a surgeon over long distances has many attractions. Thus, again there is considerable research underway in the subject. (Locally controlled robots are currently being used for joint replacement surgery as they are more precise in milling bone to receive the joints.) The armed forces have an obvious interest since the combination of telepresence, teleoperation, and telerobotics can potentially save the lives of battle casualties by allowing them prompt attention in mobile operating theatres by remote surgeons.

Recently, teleconferencing has been used in medicine (telemedicine or telematics), mainly employing audio-visual exchange, for the performance of real time remote surgical operations – as demonstrated in Regensburg, Germany in 2002. In addition to audio-visual data, the transfer of haptic (tactile) information has also been demonstrated in telemedicine.

=== Education ===
Research has been conducted on the use of telepresence to provide professional development to teachers. Research has shown that one of the most effective forms of teacher professional development is coaching, or cognitive apprenticeship. The application of telepresence shows promise for making this approach to teacher professional development practical.

The benefits of enabling schoolchildren to take an active part in exploration have also been shown by the JASON and the NASA Ames Research Center programs. The ability of a pupil, student, or researcher to explore an otherwise inaccessible location is a very attractive proposition; For example, locations where the passage of too many people is harming the immediate environment or the artifacts themselves, e.g. undersea exploration of coral reefs, ancient Egyptian tombs, and more recent works of art.

Another application is for the remote classroom which allows a professor to teach students in different campuses at the same time. An example of this application is in classrooms of the law schools of Rutgers University. Two identical rooms are located in two metropolitan areas. Each classroom is equipped with studio lighting, audio, and video conference equipment connected to a 200-inch monitor on the wall that students face to give an impression that they are all in the same classroom. This allows professors to be on either campus and facilitates the interaction among students in both campuses during the classes.

=== Telepresence art ===

True telepresence is a multidisciplinary art and science that foundationally integrates engineering, psychology, and the art of television broadcast.

In 1998, Diller and Scofidio created the &quot;Refresh&quot;, an Internet-based art installation that juxtaposed a live web camera with recorded videos staged by professional actors. Each image was accompanied with a fictional narrative which made it difficult to distinguish which was the live web camera.

In 1993, Eduardo Kac and Ed Bennett created a telepresence installation &quot;Ornitorrinco on the Moon&quot;, for the international telecommunication arts festival &quot;Blurred Boundaries&quot; (Entgrenzte Grenzen II). It was coordinated by Kulturdata, in Graz, Austria, and was connected around the world.

From 1997 to the present Ghislaine Boddington of shinkansen and body&gt;data&gt;space has explored, in a collaboration process she has called The Weave using performing arts techniques, the extended use of telepresence into festivals, arts centres and clubs and has directed numerous workshops leading to exploration of telepresence by many artists worldwide. This methodology has been used extensively to develop skills in tele-intuition for young people in preparation for the future world of work through the body&gt;data&gt;space / NESTA project &quot;Robots and Avatars&quot; an innovative project explores how young people will work and play with new representational forms of themselves and others in virtual and physical life in the next 10–15 years.

An overview of telepresence in dance and theatre through the last 20 years is given in «Excited Atoms» research document by Judith Staines (2009) which one can download from the On The Move website.

<doc id="305084" wikidata="Q5500523" url="?curid=305084" title="Freedom Evolves">
<text>Freedom Evolves is a 2003 popular science and philosophy book by Daniel C. Dennett. Dennett describes the book as an installment of a lifelong philosophical project, earlier parts of which were &quot;The Intentional Stance&quot;, &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot;, and &quot;Elbow Room&quot;. It attempts to give an account of free will and moral responsibility that is complementary to Dennett&#x27;s other views on consciousness and personhood.

== Synopsis ==
As in &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot;, Dennett advertises the controversial nature of his views extensively in advance. He expects hostility from those who fear that a skeptical analysis of freedom will undermine people&#x27;s belief in the reality of moral considerations; he likens himself to an interfering crow who insists on telling Dumbo he doesn&#x27;t really need the feather he believes is allowing him to fly.

=== Free will and altruism===

Dennett&#x27;s stance on free will is compatibilism with an evolutionary twist – the view that, although in the strict physical sense our actions might be determined, we can still be free in all the ways that matter, because of the abilities we evolved. Free will, seen this way, is about freedom to make decisions without duress (and so is a version of Kantian positive practical free will, i.e., Kantian autonomy), as opposed to an impossible and unnecessary freedom from causality itself. To clarify this distinction, he uses the term &#x27;evitability&#x27; (the opposite of &#x27;inevitability&#x27;), defining it as the ability of an agent to anticipate likely consequences and act to avoid undesirable ones. &quot;Evitability&quot; is entirely compatible with, and actually requires, human action being deterministic.
Dennett moves on to altruism, denying that it requires acting to the benefit of others without gaining any benefit yourself. He argues that it should be understood in terms of helping yourself by helping others, expanding the self to be more inclusive as opposed to being selfless. To show this blend, he calls such actions &#x27;benselfish&#x27;, and finds the roots of our capacity for this in the evolutionary pressures that produced kin selection. 
In his treatment of both free will and altruism, he starts by showing why we should not accept the traditional definitions of either term.

===Beneficial mutual arrangements===

Dennett also suggests that adherence to high ethical standards might pay off for the individual, because if others know your behaviour is restricted in these ways, the scope for certain beneficial mutual arrangements is enhanced. This is related to game theoretical considerations: in the famous Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma, &#x27;moral&#x27; agents who cooperate will be more successful than &#x27;non-moral&#x27; agents who do not cooperate. Cooperation wouldn&#x27;t seem to naturally arise since agents are tempted to &#x27;defect&#x27; and restore a Nash equilibrium, which is often not the best possible solution for all involved. Dennett concludes by contemplating the possibility that people might be able to opt in or out of moral responsibility: surely, he suggests, given the benefits, they would choose to opt in, especially given that opting out includes such things as being imprisoned or institutionalized.

===Libet&#x27;s experiments===
Daniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from Benjamin Libet&#x27;s experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events are involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it &quot;seems&quot; to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur.
Suppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds—a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to &quot;you&quot;. (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet&#x27;s method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the &quot;intersection&quot; of two trajectories:
* the rising to consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick
* the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive clock-face orientations
so that these events occur side-by-side as it were in place where their simultaneity can be noted.

===Robert Kane===
Dennett spends a chapter criticising Robert Kane&#x27;s theory of libertarian free will. Kane believes freedom is based on certain rare and exceptional events, which he calls self-forming actions or SFA&#x27;s. Dennett notes that there is no guarantee such an event will occur in an individual&#x27;s life. If it does not, the individual does not in fact have free will at all, according to Kane. Yet they will seem the same as anyone else. Dennett finds an essentially &quot;indetectable&quot; notion of free will to be incredible.

<text>Dikson Island (), initially Dickson, is an island in Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District (), Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia, situated in the Kara Sea near the mouth of the Yenisei River. A nearby urban-type settlement of Dikson, which functions as a port and hydrometeorological centre, is located on the mainland across from the island. It is served by the Dikson Airport.

==History==
Dikson Island and its adjoining urban settlement have been named after Swedish Arctic pioneer Baron Oscar Dickson. In the 17th century the island was known as &#x27; (&quot;long&quot;) island, or &#x27;, after its Pomor discoverer. In 1875, the Finnish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld renamed it after the wealthy Swedish merchant and philanthropist of Scottish origin Oskar Dickson. The name was soon Russified, by dropping the &quot;c&quot;. Dikson has been the official name of the island since 1884. Oscar Dickson, along with Aleksandr Mikhaylovich Sibiryakov, had been the patron of a number of early Arctic expeditions, including Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld&#x27;s Russian Arctic explorations.

In 1915 the island became the site of the first Russian radio station in the Arctic. The seaport on the mainland was built in 1935, and in 1957 the two settlements were merged into one.

During World War II the town was bombarded by the in August 1942 during Operation Wunderland.

Dikson Island was one of the transfer destinations for 1949 March deportation from Latvia.

==Climate==
Dikson has an arctic tundra climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;ET&quot;) — yet interestingly, it has four almost equally-divided &quot;seasons&quot;: The sun does not rise from about mid-November through early February, and does not set from the beginning of May until mid-August. In between, there is a &quot;spring&quot; during which the amount of daylight steadily increases, and an &quot;autumn&quot; during which the amount of daylight steadily decreases — but due to the &quot;seasonal lag&quot; factor, February is actually the coldest month, while August is the warmest month.
