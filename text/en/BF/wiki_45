<text>Schlager (, &quot;&quot;) is a style of European popular music and radio format generally defined by catchy instrumental accompaniments to vocal pieces of pop music with simple, easygoing, and often sentimental lyrics.

Schlager tracks are typically light pop tunes or sweet, sentimental ballads with simple, catchy melodies. Their lyrics typically center on love, relationships, and feelings. The northern variant of schlager (notably in Finland) has taken elements from Finnic, Nordic, Slavic, and Eastern European folk songs, with lyrics tending toward melancholic and elegiac themes. Musically, schlager bears similarities to styles such as easy listening.

The style has been frequently represented at the Eurovision Song Contest and has been popular since the contest began in 1956, though it is gradually being replaced by other pop music styles.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Schlager&quot; is a loanword from German (from &quot;schlagen&quot;, &quot;to hit&quot;). It also came into some other languages (such as Bulgarian, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Dutch, Czech, Croatian, Finnish, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Serbian, Turkish, Russian, Hebrew, and Romanian, for example), where it retained its meaning of a &quot;(musical) hit&quot;.

== Central Europe ==

The roots of German schlager are old. Originally, the word meant a hit or a strike. The first use of the word applied to music, in its original meaning, was in an opening night critique in the newspaper &quot;Wiener Fremden-Blatt&quot; on 17 February 1867 about The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss II. 

One ancestor of schlager music in its current meaning may be the operetta, which was highly popular in the early 20th century. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Comedian Harmonists and Rudi Schuricke laid the foundations for this new music. Well-known schlager singers of the 1950s and early 1960s include Lale Andersen, Freddy Quinn, Ivo Robić, Gerhard Wendland, Caterina Valente, Margot Eskens and Conny Froboess. Schlager reached a peak of popularity in Germany and Austria in the 1960s (featuring Peter Alexander and Roy Black) and the early 1970s. From the mid-1990s through the early 2000s, schlager also saw an extensive revival in Germany by, for example, Guildo Horn, Dieter Thomas Kuhn, Michelle, and Petra Perle. Dance clubs would play a stretch of schlager titles during the course of an evening, and numerous new bands were formed specialising in 1970s schlager cover versions and newer material.
Some Germans view schlager as their country music, and American country and Tex-Mex music are both major elements in schlager culture. (&quot;Is This the Way to Amarillo&quot; is regularly played in schlager contexts, usually in the English-language original.)

Popular schlager singers include Michael Holm, Roland Kaiser, Hansi Hinterseer, Jürgen Drews, Andrea Berg, Heintje Simons, Helene Fischer, Nicole, Claudia Jung, Andrea Jürgens, Michelle, Kristina Bach, Marianne Rosenberg, Simone Stelzer, Daniela Alfinito, Semino Rossi, Vicky Leandros, Leonard, DJ Ötzi, Andreas Gabalier and more recently, Beatrice Egli. 

In Hamburg in the 2010s, Schlager fans still gathered annually by the hundreds of thousands, dressing in 1970s clothing for street parades called &quot;Schlager Move&quot;. The Schlager Move designation is also used for a number of smaller schlager music parties in several major German cities throughout the year. (This revival is sometimes associated with kitsch and camp.) In the meantime, private radio has brought Schlager back to the radio. Schlager Radio is a station that broadcasts its program terrestrially in Germany via transmission towers on both FM and DAB+.

Stylistically, schlager continues to influence German &quot;party pop&quot; or &quot;party-schlager&quot; (e.g. &quot;Layla&quot;, 2022): that is, music most often heard in après-ski bars and Majorcan mass discos. In the English-speaking world, the most popular group to have included elements of schlager in their style is probably ABBA, a band that mixed traditional Swedish music, schlager, and pop-rock to create their own sound.

<doc id="299412" wikidata="Q389779" url="?curid=299412" title="Felix Pappalardi">
<text>Felix Albert Pappalardi Jr. (December 30, 1939 – April 17, 1983) was an American music producer, songwriter, vocalist, and bassist. He is best known as the bassist and co-lead vocalist of the band Mountain, whose song &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot; peaked at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became a classic rock radio staple. 

Originating in the eclectic music scene in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village, he became closely attached to the British power trio Cream, writing, arranging, and producing for their second album &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;. As a producer for Atlantic Records, he worked on several projects with guitarist Leslie West; in 1969 their partnership evolved into the band Mountain. The band lasted less than five years, but their work influenced the first generation of heavy metal and hard rock music. Pappalardi continued to work as a producer, session musician, and songwriter until he was shot and killed by his wife Gail Collins in 1983.

== Early life ==
Pappalardi was born in the Bronx, New York City, to an Italian family who immigrated from Gravina in Puglia. A classically trained musician, he graduated from New York City&#x27;s High School of Music &amp; Art and attended the University of Michigan.

== Career ==
In 1964, Pappalardi was a member of Max Morath&#x27;s Original Rag Quartet (ORQ) in their premier engagement at New York City&#x27;s Village Vanguard. Along with Pappalardi on guitarrón (Mexican acoustic bass) were pianist-singer Morath, who revived classic ragtime played in the Scott Joplin manner, Barry Kornfeld, a New York studio folk and jazz guitarist, and Jim Tyler, a Baroque and Renaissance lutenist, playing four-string banjo and mandolin. The ORQ toured the college and concert circuit, opening four engagements with the Dinah Shore show in Las Vegas and elsewhere. Pappalardi studied classical music at the University of Michigan. Upon completing his studies and returning to New York, he was unable to find work and so became part of the Greenwich Village folk-music scene, where he made a name for himself as an arranger; he appeared on albums by Tom Paxton, Vince Martin and Fred Neil for Elektra Records. Thereafter he moved into record production, initially concentrating on folk and folk-rock acts for artists such as The Youngbloods and Joan Baez.

As a producer, Pappalardi is perhaps best known for his work with Cream, beginning with their second album, &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;. He contributed instrumentation for his studio arrangements and he and his wife, Gail Collins, wrote the Cream hit &quot;Strange Brew&quot; with Eric Clapton. He also produced The Youngbloods&#x27; first album 

As a musician, Pappalardi is widely recognized as a bassist, vocalist, and founding member of the American hard rock band (and heavy metal forerunner) Mountain, a band born out of his working with future bandmate Leslie West&#x27;s soul-inspired rock and roll band The Vagrants, and producing West&#x27;s 1969 &quot;Mountain&quot; solo album. The band&#x27;s original incarnation actively recorded and toured between 1969 and 1971. Pappalardi produced the band&#x27;s albums, and co-wrote and arranged a number of the band&#x27;s songs with Collins and West.

== Later life and death ==

Pappalardi was forced to retire because of partial deafness, ostensibly from his high-volume shows with Mountain. He continued producing throughout the 1970s, released a solo album (&quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, Ma&quot;) and recorded with Kazuo Takeda&#x27;s band Creation (who had opened for a reunited Mountain during their 1973 tour of Japan).

In May 1973, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that Pappalardi would be producing and playing bass on &quot;Queen of the Night&quot;, the debut album for Maggie Bell, former singer of Stone the Crows, but this proved to be false.

He produced The Dead Boys album &quot;We Have Come for Your Children&quot; in 1978.

He also worked on the NBC show &quot;Hot Hero Sandwich&quot; in 1979.

Pappalardi was shot and killed by his wife, Gail Collins Pappalardi, on April 17, 1983, in their apartment on the East Side of Manhattan, with a derringer he had given her as a gift a few months previously. She was subsequently charged with second-degree murder and was found guilty of the lesser criminally negligent homicide.

He is interred next to his mother at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

<text>The Ilocos Region (; ; ), designated as Region I, is an administrative region of the Philippines. Located in the northwestern section of Luzon, it is bordered by the Cordillera Administrative Region to the east, the Cagayan Valley to the northeast and southeast, Central Luzon to the south, and the West Philippine Sea to the west.

The region comprises four provinces: Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, and Pangasinan, along with one independent city, Dagupan City. The regional center is the City of San Fernando in La Union, which serves as the administrative hub of the region. The largest settlement in terms of population is San Carlos City in Pangasinan. 

The 2020 Philippine Statistic Authority census reported that the major ethnolinguistic group composition of the region is predominantly made up of Ilocanos (58.3%), followed by Pangasinans (29.7%), Tagalogs (4.1%), and various Cordilleran (Igorot) indigenous groups.

The region is renowned for its rich natural and cultural attractions, featuring historic and UNESCO World Heritage sites, surfing spots, pristine beaches, island-hopping adventures, and the well-preserved Spanish baroque churches and colonial city of Vigan.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
The region was originally inhabited by Negritos as early as 30,000 BC but over time, these early settlers were displaced by successive waves of Austronesian migrants who arrived via the region&#x27;s narrow coastal areas using traditional boats known as balangay boat (referred to as &quot;biray&quot; or &quot;bilog&quot; in Ilocano). The migrations are explained by the widely accepted &quot;Out of Taiwan&quot; hypothesis, which posits that Neolithic Austronesian peoples migrated from Taiwan, forming the ancestral populations of contemporary Austronesians.

Austronesians are believed to have originated from Southern China or Taiwan and arrived in the Philippines through at least two major migration waves. The first wave, approximately 10,000 to 7,000 years ago, brought the ancestors of indigenous groups in the Cordillera Central mountain range. Subsequent migrations introduced additional Austronesian populations, along with agricultural practices, which eventually supplanted the languages of earlier inhabitants.

These Austronesian settlers included the Cordilleran (Igorot) groups, such as the Itneg (Tingguian) and the Isnag in the northern highlands, as well as the Kankanaey and Ibaloi in the southern highlands, who arrived during the first wave of migration. The second wave brought the Ilocanos, who settled in the northern coastal areas, alongside the Pangasinans, Bolinao and Zambals, who established communities in the southern and southwestern coastal zones.

=== Early History ===
With the establishment of commercial trading routes in Southeast Asia, settlements in the region flourished both culturally and economically through maritime trade. 

The Ilocanos, known as &quot;Samtoy&quot; in pre-colonial times, actively traded goods and products with local and foreign merchants, including the Chinese and Japanese. One notable coastal trading post was &quot;Bee Gan&quot; (Chinese: 美岸; &quot;měi&#x27;àn&quot;; &quot;bí-gān&quot;), meaning &quot;&quot;beautiful shore&quot;,&quot; which is now the city of Vigan. This site served as a significant hub for early Ilocano trade.

In the southern part of the region, the pre-colonial polity (&quot;panarian&quot;) of Caboloan was situated at the Agno River basin with Binalatongan as the capital, while Pangasinan was located at the delta and near the Lingayen Gulf, became a center for maritime trade. Gold mined from the Cordillera Mountain Range was transported along the Aringay-Tonglo-Balatok gold trail and traded in settlements like Agoo. At the time, Agoo&#x27;s coastal shape made it an ideal harbor for foreign vessels. 

This trade network connected the region to maritime routes spanning the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. Goods exchanged included porcelain, silk (&quot;inabel&quot;), cotton, beeswax, honey, gemstones, beads, precious minerals, locally crafted &quot;burnáy&quot; (stoneware jars), and particularly gold. 

Evidence of this trade has been uncovered in the Pangasinense port of Agoo, where porcelain and ceramic or pottery fragments were found during renovations of the Catholic church. These artifacts are now preserved in the Museo de Iloko. Japanese fishermen later established one of their first settlements in the Philippines in Agoo, introducing advanced fishing techniques and technologies to the local population.

Another notable aspect of the region&#x27;s early history is the discovery of the Bolinao Skull, which dates to the 14th or 15th century and is associated with the early inhabitants of Pangasinan. The skull is particularly notable for its &quot;dental ornamentation&quot;, with teeth inlaid with &quot;gold&quot;. It was found alongside 67 other similarly adorned skulls and trade ware ceramics from the early Ming Dynasty. This discovery highlights the advanced aesthetic traditions, burial, trade practices, and social structures of ancient Filipino communities, offering valuable insights into the region&#x27;s precolonial culture and history.

===Spanish Colonial Era===
A year after Miguel López de Legazpi declared Manila the capital of the Philippines on June 24, 1571, Spanish colonization efforts expanded to Northern Luzon to &quot;pacify the people.&quot; 

Spanish conquistador Martín de Goiti began the conquest of Pangasinan and established several Spanish settlements between 1571 and 1573. By April 5, 1580, Pangasinan became an administrative and judicial district of the province, with Lingayen as its capital. However, its territorial boundaries were first delineated in 1611, with the area originating from the Spanish settlement in Manila through Pampanga. 

On May 20, 1572, a year after Goiti&#x27;s conquest, conquistadores led by Juan de Salcedo, the grandson of Legazpi, ventured northward with eight armed boats and 80 men. They sailed to Lingayen Gulf and landed at the mouth of the Agno River. In 1574, Limahong, a Chinese pirate, fled to Pangasinan after his fleet was driven away from Manila. Limahong attempted to establish a colony in Pangasinan but failed as an army led by Salcedo chased him out of the region after a seven-month siege. 

Salcedo then continued his journey to Agoo, where he discovered a Japanese settlement and named it &quot;El Puerto de Japón&quot; after its conquest. He then reached Vigan on June 13, 1572, which had been a Chinese trading post from the Fujian province of China. In Vigan, he founded &quot;&#x27;Villa Fernandina de Vigan&quot;&#x27; and made it the diocesan seat of Nueva Segovia in honor of King Philip II&#x27;s son, Prince Ferdinand. Salcedo then proceeded to Laoag, Currimao, and Badoc, rounded the tip of Luzón, and continued to pacify the Bicol Region.

In 1574, Salcedo returned to Vigan with soldiers and Augustinian missionaries to initiate the evangelization of the Ilocos region. He established a Spanish city to control the neighboring territories and convert the native population to Catholicism. 

As a reward for his services, Salcedo was granted the province of Ylocos, covering what is now Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra, La Union, and parts of Mountain Province, as his estate. He was also given the title &quot;Justicia Mayor de esta Provincia de Ylocos&quot; (Province Mayor of Ilocos). By the end of the 1700s, Ilocos had a population of 44,852 native families, 631 Spanish Filipino families, and 10,041 Chinese Filipino families. 

Despite Spanish efforts, the Ilocanos in the northern parts of the region were less easily swayed and remained resistant to Spanish rule. These resentments led to several uprisings throughout the region&#x27;s history, including the insurrections of Andrés Malong in 1660, Palaris of Pangasinan in 1762, Pedro Almazán in Ilocos Norte in 1661, Diego Silang and Gabriela Silang in 1764 and Basi Revolt in 1807. After the Basi Revolt, tensions culminated in the division of Ilocos into two provinces (Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur) on February 2, 1818. The Pangasinans in the south were the last to resist Spanish rule. 

During the Philippine Revolution of 1896-1898, General Manuel Tinio allied with Emilio Aguinaldo to lead the revolution in Northern Luzon (Ilocos Siege), alongside General Francisco Makabulos. Makabulos led his forces to liberate Pangasinan and led revolutionaries in the Battle of Dagupan against the Spanish army. By August 1898, the revolutionaries had driven Spanish forces out of several towns, including Laoag, Ilocos Norte, marking a turning point in the revolution. 

On June 12, 1898, General Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine independence and became the first president of the Republic of the Philippines. 

===American Invasion Era===

The American colonization of the Ilocos Region began following the conclusion of the Spanish-American War in 1898, when the Philippines was ceded to the United States under the Treaty of Paris. This marked a period of profound transformation for the region, which came under American colonial administration after the Philippine-American War (1899-1902).

On November 18, 1899, American forces landed in the Ilocos Region in pursuit of Emilio Aguinaldo, the leader of the Philippine resistance. While American troops swiftly occupied towns, they faced persistent resistance in the rural areas (barrios), where guerrilla forces led by Gen. Manuel Tinio continued the struggle. Tinio, a veteran of the 1896 Philippine Revolution against Spain, orchestrated a widespread guerrilla campaign, harassing American forces in the countryside. 

One of the most iconic events during this period was the Battle of Tirad Pass on December 2, 1899. Gen. Gregorio del Pilar and his 60 soldiers faced over 300 troops of the U.S. 45th Infantry Division, led by Gen. Peyton C. March. Despite a valiant defense, the Filipinos ultimately lost their position, marking a significant, albeit symbolic, moment in the resistance against American forces. 

The Philippine-American War officially ended in 1902, following years of intense conflict, with the establishment of a Filipino civilian government under American oversight. Civil governance was introduced in the Ilocos Region, as well as the rest of the Philippines, on July 1, 1901, with William H. Taft serving as the first Civil Governor. The position was later renamed Governor-General by the U.S. Congress on February 3, 1903. One of the most notable reforms was the establishment of a centralized public school system in 1901, using English as the medium of instruction. To address a shortage of educators, the colonial government deployed 600 American teachers known as the Thomasites. 

By September 1902, public secondary schools had been established across the region, including institutions in Lingayen (Pangasinan), Vigan and Santa Maria (Ilocos Sur), Bauang, Bacnotan, and San Fernando (La Union), and Laoag and Dingras (Ilocos Norte) with several US Thomasites serving as educators. The Taft Commission per instructions of US President McKinley introduced free primary education, designed to prepare citizens for civic duties. Additionally, church lands were purchased and redistributed following the disestablishment of the Catholic Church, further signaling the shift in socio-political structures under American rule.In 1901, several towns from Nueva Ecija including Balungao, Rosales, San Quintin, and Umingan were annexed to the province of Pangasinan. On November 30, 1903, additional municipalities from northern Zambales such as Agno, Alaminos, Anda, Bani, Bolinao, Burgos, Dasol, Infanta, and Mabini were transferred to Pangasinan. These towns, originally part of the homeland of the Sambal people, were reassigned due to their geographic distance from their original provincial capitals. Despite resistance from local communities, this decision has remained unchanged. 

Under the Philippine Organic Act of 1902, the Ilocos Region experienced significant political, economic, and social changes. Infrastructure development flourished, with the construction of public schools, bridges, railways, airports, and ports, enhancing the region&#x27;s connectivity with other parts of the country. 

However, these developments were accompanied by local unrest. Reports of war crimes, forced relocations, extrajudicial killings, and destruction of property by American forces fueled discontent among the population. While the introduction of modern governance and infrastructure brought progress, these human rights abuses left a lasting impact on the region&#x27;s history. 

American colonization ended on July 4, 1946 in WWII&#x27;s aftermath gaining Philippines Independence from the United States.

===Japanese Occupation Era===

The Japanese invasion of the Philippine Commonwealth began on December 8, 1941 during World War II, when Japan launched an attack on U.S. military installations and residential areas, following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Just two days later, the Japanese &quot;Kanno Detachment&quot; landed in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, aiming to secure airstrips for further military operations. Although initially unopposed, the landing was delayed by bad weather and American air attacks, which damaged Japanese ships and caused casualties. By December 11, the Japanese forces had successfully captured Vigan and dispatched additional troops to seize Laoag and its airfield. As American forces retreated, Lieutenan Gen. Masaharu Homma left a small garrison in Vigan and redirected the main forces to support operations at Lingayen Gulf. 

By December 20, the combined forces of the Col. Kanno and Gen. Shizuichi Tanaka Detachments advanced south along Route 3. After overcoming Philippine defenses in Bacnotan, they reached San Fernando, La Union, by December 22. The Japanese 14th Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma, had also landed at Lingayen Gulf, gaining control of key areas in Pangasinan and La Union. This marked the beginning of Japanese occupation of Northern Luzon, including the Lingayen Gulf region, which remained under Japanese control for three years, until it was recaptured by Allied forces in 1945. 

During the occupation, the region was part of the Japanese-controlled &quot;puppet republic&quot; led by President José P. Laurel. The local population endured widespread atrocities committed by the Japanese Imperial Army, including gang rape, sexual slavery (comfort women), torture, and other human rights violations. These brutal acts sparked significant resistance movements across the region, with several guerrilla groups forming to oppose the Japanese occupation. One prominent leader of the local resistance was &quot;Captain Candonino Villalon Gaerlan&quot;, who led a successful ambush against Japanese forces in Candon, Ilocos Sur, symbolizing local defiance against the invaders.

By 1944, with the United States beginning its campaign to liberate the Philippines, the region became a crucial focal point for military operations. On October 20, 1944, the Allied forces initiated the liberation of the Philippines, setting the stage for the Battle of Lingayen Gulf in early 1945. On January 6, 1945, the U.S. Navy, supported by the Royal Australian Navy, began heavy bombardments of Japanese coastal defenses and infrastructure, lasting until January 8. Japanese kamikaze attacks targeted Allied vessels from January 7 to 9, but despite the damage, the U.S. Navy maintained control of the Gulf, securing it for the imminent invasion.

On January 9, known as S-Day, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and U.S. Army forces from the Sixth Army landed on a 25-mile beachhead between Lingayen and San Fabian. The landings, supported by over 800 ships and extensive air support, faced light resistance, as the Japanese had concentrated their defenses inland. By January 15, 1945, Allied forces had firmly secured the Lingayen Gulf region and began advancing into the heart of Luzon, paving the way for the liberation of Manila and the eventual defeat of Japanese forces in the Philippines.

===The Postwar Era ===

The Ilocos region produced two presidents of the Republic of the Philippines within the first two decades after the recognition of Philippine independence: Elpidio Quirino and Ferdinand Marcos.

This period also marked a return of the tobacco industry to the Ilocos Region. Ever since the end of the tobacco monopoly, tobacco production had declined in the Ilocos as Filipinos started shifting from locally made cigars to foreign made cigarettes. But after reading a feature article series by Maximo Soliven which explained why Virginia tobacco would grow well on Ilocos soil, businessman Harry Stonehill was convinced to invest extensively in rebuilding the industry, establishing the Philippine Tobacco Flue-Curing and Redrying Corporation (PTFCRC) in 1951 and recruiting farmers from throughout Region 1 to produce tobacco. The following year, La Union Congressman Manuel T. Cases filed a bill to &quot;limit the importation of foreign leaf tobacco,&quot; which was eventually signed by President Elpidio Quirino as Republic Act 698. This allowed Stonehill&#x27;s investments to make a handsome profit, and the newly rebuilt local industry to bloom. Stonehill was later deported a decade later, in the 1960s, for tax evasion and bribery of government officials, in what would later be called the Stonehill scandal, but the tobacco industry continued to grow.

===The Martial Law Era===

Various human rights violations were documented in the Ilocos region during the Marcos martial law era, despite public perception that the region was supportive of Marcos&#x27; administration. In Ilocos Norte, various farmers from the towns of Vintar, Dumalneg, Solsona, Marcos, and Piddig were documented to have been tortured, and eight farmers in Bangui and three indigenous community members in Vintar were &quot;salvaged&quot; in 1984.

Ilocanos who were critical of Marcos&#x27; authoritarian rule included Roman Catholic Archbishop and Agoo, La Union native Antonio L. Mabutas, who spoke actively against the torture and killings of church workers. Other La Union natives who fought the dictatorship were student activists Romulo and Armando Palabay of San Fernando, La Union, whose torture and death in a military camp in Pampanga would lead them to being honored as martyrs in the fight against the dictatorship in the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani memorial.

In Ilocos Norte, one of the prominent victims of the Martial Law era who came from Laoag was Catholic layperson and social worker Purificacion Pedro, who volunteered in organizations protesting the Chico River Dam Project in the nearby Cordillera Central mountains. Wounded while visiting activist friends in Bataan, she was later killed by Marcos administration soldiers while recuperating in the hospital. Another prominent opponent of the martial law regime was human rights advocate and Bombo Radyo Laoag program host David Bueno, who worked with the Free Legal Assistance Group in Ilocos Norte during the later part of the Marcos administration and the early part of the succeeding Aquino administration. He would later be assassinated by motorcycle-riding men in fatigue uniforms on October 22, 1987 – part of a wave of assassinations which coincided with the 1986-87 coup d&#x27;état which tried to unseat the democratic government set up after the 1986 People Power Revolution. Both Bueno and Pedro were later honored among the first 65 people to have their names inscribed on the wall of remembrance of the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the martyrs and heroes who fought the dictatorship, and Pedro was listed among Filipino Catholics nominated to be named Servant of God.

=== Integration and Realignment of the Region ===
The integration of provinces into the Ilocos Region has evolved over time, shaped by political decisions aimed at administrative restructuring and cultural integration.

In 1973, &quot;Presidential Decree No. 1&quot;, issued by President Ferdinand Marcos, transferred the province of Pangasinan from Region III (Central Luzon) to Region I (Ilocos Region). This realignment was intended to strengthen Ilocano influence in Pangasinan, a province that had already experienced an influx of Ilocano settlers during the Spanish colonial era in the 19th century. Before this decree, Pangasinan had not been part of the Ilocos Region.

During the same period, the provinces of Abra, Mountain Province, and Benguet were also included in the Ilocos Region. These provinces, traditionally inhabited by indigenous groups, saw increased Ilocano migration. In particular, Abra had long been a destination for Ilocano settlers, dating back to the Spanish colonial period when it was part of the larger Ilocos Province, and later, Ilocos Sur. The inclusion of these provinces in the region was part of a broader strategy to expand Ilocano influence among the ethnic communities of the Cordilleras.

On July 15, 1987, President Corazon Aquino issued &quot;Executive Order No. 220&quot;, creating the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). This order transferred Abra, Mountain Province, and Benguet from the Ilocos Region to the newly established CAR, recognizing the Cordillera&#x27;s indigenous peoples&#x27; unique cultural and historical identities.

As of today, the Ilocos Region consists of four provinces: Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, and Pangasinan. Meanwhile, Abra, Mountain Province, and Benguet are part of the Cordillera Administrative Region.

=== Contemporary History ===
The Ilocos region has produced 3 more Philippine Presidents in the years since the 1986 People Power revolution: Pangasinense Fidel V. Ramos, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (Ilocano on mother&#x27;s side), and Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; son Bongbong Marcos.

The southern parts of the region were severely hit by the 1990 Luzon earthquake. Five municipalities in La Union were affected: Agoo, Aringay, Caba, Santo Tomas, and Tubao with a combined population of 132,208. Many buildings, including the Agoo Municipal hall, the Museo de Iloko, the parish church of Aringay, and the Basilica Minore of our Lady of Charity, collapsed or were severely damaged. Sitio Nagpanauan in Aringay completely submerged when the sea level rose and the land collapsed during the earthquake. 100,000 families were displaced when two coastal villages sank due to liquefaction. The province suffered many casualties leaving 32 people dead. In Pangasinan, about 90 buildings in Dagupan were damaged, and about 20 collapsed. Some structures sustained damage because liquefaction caused buildings to sink as much as . The earthquake caused a decrease in the elevation of the city and several areas were flooded. The city suffered 64 casualties of which 47 survived and 17 died. Most injuries were sustained during stampedes at a university building and a theater.

== Geography ==
The Ilocos Region, situated in the northwestern part of Luzon, Philippines, encompasses a total land area of 12,840.2 square kilometers. Of this area, 810,062 hectares are classified as alienable and disposable land, while 473,957 hectares are designated as forest land. The region is strategically positioned with direct access to international sea lanes and features diverse geographical landscapes. It is bordered by the South China Sea to the west and the Central Cordillera Mountain Range to the east. In contrast, Pangasinan occupies the northwestern section of the vast Central Luzon Plain, with the Zambales Mountains forming its natural western boundary.

The region&#x27;s highest peak is Mount Sicapoo, located within the Central Cordillera range in Ilocos Norte and Abra. This mountain, characterized by dense pine forests, reaches an elevation of 7,746 feet (2,361 meters) above sea level, making it the tallest point in region.

The Ilocos Region is traversed by 29 river systems, including two significant river basins: the Agno River Basin and the Abra River Basin. The Agno River, originating in Benguet, flows through Pangasinan and forms a broad delta in Lingayen before emptying into Lingayen Gulf. It is one of the largest river systems in the Philippines, with a drainage area of 5,952 square kilometers (2,298 square miles). The Abra River, originating near Mount Data in Benguet, flows through Abra and Ilocos Sur and is the country&#x27;s seventh-largest river system, with a drainage area of approximately 5,125 square kilometers (1,979 square miles) and a length of 179 kilometers (111 miles). The river&#x27;s delta and mouth are located between the municipalities of Santa and Caoayan in Ilocos Sur, before emptying into the West Philippine Sea.

The Lingayen Gulf, a notable body of water in the region, is particularly significant in Pangasinan and La Union. It hosts numerous islands, including the famed Hundred Islands National Park. To the north of the region lies the Luzon Strait, underscoring its strategic geographic importance. 

Cabarruyan Island is the largest island in the region. It is situated in the municipality of Anda, Pangasinan, along the Lingayen Gulf. The island has an approximate area of 77.78 square kilometers (30.03 square miles) and a coastline length of roughly 59.16 kilometers (36.76 miles).

Paoay Lake is one of the largest natural lakes in the region, located at Paoay, Ilocos Norte, It has a surface area of approximately 3.86 square kilometers (1.49 square miles), with an average depth of 6 meters (20 feet) a maximum depth of 10 meters (33 feet) with surface elevation is below sea level.

Aw-asen Falls, at Sigay, Ilocos Sur, is the tallest waterfall in the region. It stands at a height of 120 meters (394 feet) and has a plunge pool depth of approximately 8 meters (26 feet).

Given its location, the Ilocos Region plays a pivotal role in East Asia, being in close proximity to dynamic economies such as Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Southern China.

=== Administrative Divisions ===

The Ilocos Region (Region I) is composed of four provinces, namely Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, and Pangasinan. It also includes one independent component city (Dagupan City) and eight component cities: Laoag, Candon, Vigan, San Fernando, Alaminos, Urdaneta, San Carlos, and Batac. The region is further subdivided into 116 municipalities and 3,265 barangays. There are 12 congressional districts: 2 each in Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, and La Union, and 6 in Pangasinan. These political divisions reflect the administrative organization of the region, facilitating governance and development initiatives.

== Culture and the Arts ==
The Ilocos Region boasts a diverse cultural heritage that reflects the rich traditions of the Ilocano, Pangasinense, and Cordilleran peoples. Shaped by centuries of influences from colonial powers, neighboring regions, and native Austronesian roots, the region has managed to preserve its distinct cultural identity while skillfully integrating foreign elements with indigenous practices.

In the northern part of the region, the Ilocanos are renowned for their resourcefulness and hardworking nature, shaped by the challenges of living in an area with limited farmland. Their culture emphasizes family values, frugality, and dedication to hard work. The epic story of &quot;Biag ni Lam-ang&quot; exemplifies the thriving literary tradition of the Ilocanos. Ilocano cuisine, featuring dishes like &quot;pinakbet&quot; and &quot;dinengdeng&quot;, reflects their practical use of local ingredients and preference for bold, earthy flavors. Traditional arts such as &quot;damili&quot; (red clay pottery) and &quot;inabel&quot; weaving highlight their creativity and resilience. Intricately patterned handwoven textiles, crafted on wooden looms, preserve a centuries-old art form. Music and dances like &quot;pamulinawen&quot; and &quot;balse&quot; are central to festivals and celebrations, adding to the richness of Ilocano traditions.

To the south, Pangasinan is known for its coastal culture and agricultural heritage. The Pangasinense people maintain traditions tied to fishing and salt-making, the latter giving the province its name, which means &quot;place of salt.&quot; Their cuisine, featuring delights such as &quot;tupig&quot; (grilled rice cakes) and &quot;bangus&quot; (milkfish) dishes, reflects a harmonious connection between land and sea. Pangasinan also has a thriving literary tradition with forms like &quot;tongtong&quot;, &quot;uliran&quot;, &quot;diparan&quot;, and &quot;pabitla.&quot; Pangasinan folk dances like &quot;Binasuan&quot; and &quot;Sayaw ed Tapew na Bangko&quot; (Sayaw sa Bangko) reflect the Pangasinense rich cultural heritage, showcasing grace, artistry, and the community&#x27;s festive traditions. The province&#x27;s &quot;komedya&quot; performances, a theatrical art form introduced during Spanish colonization, merge Catholic themes with local folklore and remain a cultural highlight.

In the east, the Cordillera highlands bring a distinct mountain culture to the region. Home to the Igorots, this area is known for its iconic terraced rice fields and agricultural rituals that reflect a deep spiritual connection to nature. Cordilleran artistry shines through wood carving, bamboo crafts, metalwork, and traditional rice wine &quot;tapuy&quot; or &quot;tapuey&quot;, which reflects mastery of fermentation techniques often created for ceremonial purposes. Traditional music features instruments such as the &quot;gangsa&quot; (gongs) and &quot;kalaleng&quot; (nose flute), while dances like the &quot;kanyaw&quot; or &quot;tayaw&quot; and &quot;tadek&quot; express gratitude and reverence for ancestral spirits.
Festivals in the region, such as Pangasinan&#x27;s &quot;Bangus Festival&quot; and &quot;Pista’y Dayat&quot; (Sea Festival) and Ilocos Sur&#x27;s &quot;Kannawidan Festival&quot;, showcase a vibrant blend of customs, cuisine, and traditional dances. Colonial architecture, exemplified by UNESCO-recognized Vigan City, highlights the Spanish influence on the region. The &quot;binatbatan&quot; dance, performed during Vigan&#x27;s festivals, celebrates the Ilocanos’ indigenous weaving traditions. Similarly, Pangasinan&#x27;s faith-based festivals blend Catholicism with native beliefs, reflecting the province&#x27;s unique cultural identity.The region has given birth to numerous artists who have won national acclaim. Among the most notable are writer and activist Isabelo de los Reyes of Vigan, who helped publish the earliest currently extant text of &quot;Biag ni Lam-Ang&quot;; Badoc-born Philippine Revolution-era activist and leader Juan Luna; and Binalonan-born Carlos Bulosan, whose novel &quot;America is in the Heart&quot; is regarded as &quot;the premier text of the Filipino-American experience.&quot;

The region is also home to several National Artists of the Philippines, including Victorio Cándido Edades, National Artist for Visual Arts (Painting, conferred in 1976); Lucrecia Kasilag, National Artist for Music (conferred in 1989); Severino Montano, National Artist for Theater (conferred in 2001); Francisco Sionil José, National Artist for Literature (conferred in 2001); and Salvador Bernal, National Artist for Theater and Design (conferred in 2003).

The region is home to several National Living Treasures (&quot;Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan&quot;), including Magdalena Gamayo, a master weaver renowned for her expertise in the Ilocano weaving tradition of &quot;pinagabel&quot;, and Adelita Bagcal, who specializes in &quot;dallot&quot; and other Ilocano oral traditions, both from Ilocos Norte.

In contemporary arts, the Galila Arts Festival, inaugurated in 2023, features Pangasinense artists and highlights tourist spots in the fourth district of Pangasinan. Aside from fostering arts in the province, the festival also aims to attract tourists.

<doc id="299416" wikidata="Q847664" url="?curid=299416" title="Constitution of Spain">
<text>The Spanish Constitution () is the supreme law of the Kingdom of Spain. It was enacted after its approval in a constitutional referendum; it represents the culmination of the Spanish transition to democracy.

The current version was approved in 1978, three years after the death of dictator Francisco Franco. There have been dozens of constitutions and constitution-like documents in Spain; however, it is &quot;the first which was not imposed by a party but represented a negotiated compromise among all the major parties&quot;. It was sanctioned by King Juan Carlos I on 27 December, before it was published in the (the government gazette of Spain) on 29 December, the date on which it became effective.

The promulgation of the constitution marked the climax of the Spanish transition to democracy after the death of general Franco, on 20 November 1975, who ruled over Spain as a military dictator for nearly 40 years. This led to the country undergoing a complex process that included a series of political, social and historical changes, gradually transforming the Francoist regime into a democratic state.

The Constitution was redacted, debated and approved by the constituent assembly () that emerged from the 1977 general election. It then repealed all the Fundamental Laws of the Realm (i.e., the constitution of the Francoist regime), as well as other major historical laws and every pre-existing law that contradicted the new constitution.

== Content summary ==
The Spanish Constitution is a written document that takes cues from both older Spanish constitutions and other then-current European constitutions. For example, it contains the provision for a constructive vote of no confidence, which was inspired by German Basic Law.

The Constitution is organized in ten parts () and contains an additional introduction (), a preamble, several additional and interim provisions, a series of repeals, and it ends with a final provision.

* Part I refers to fundamental rights and duties, which receive special treatment and protection under Spanish law. Article 1 defines the Spanish state: 
** Article 1.1 states that &quot;Spain is established as a social and democratic state, subject to the rule of law, which advocates as the highest values of its legal order the following: liberty, justice, equality and political pluralism. 
** Article 1.2 refers to national sovereignty, which is vested in the Spanish people, &quot;from whom the powers of the State emanate&quot;. 
** Article 1.3 establishes parliamentary monarchy as the &quot;political form of the Spanish state&quot;.
* Part II refers to the regulation of the Crown and lays out the King&#x27;s role in the Spanish state. 
* Part III elaborates on Spain&#x27;s legislature, the . 
* Part IV refers to the Government of Spain, the executive power, and the Public Administration, which is managed by the executive. 
* Part V refers to the relations between the Government and the ; as a parliamentary monarchy, the Prime Minister () is invested by the legislature and the Government is responsible before the legislature. 
* Part VI refers to the organization of the judicial power, establishing that justice emanates from the people and is administered on behalf of the king by judges and magistrates who are independent, irrevocable, liable and subject to the rule of law only. 
* Part VII refers to the principles that shall guide the economy and the finances of the Spanish state, subjecting all the wealth in the country to the general interest and recognizing public initiative in the economy, while also protecting private property in the framework of a market economy. It also establishes the Court of Accounts and the principles that shall guide the approval of the state budget. 
* Part VIII refers to the &quot;territorial organization of the State&quot; and establishes a unitary state that is nevertheless heavily decentralized through delegation and transfer of powers. The result is a &quot;de facto&quot; federal model, with some differences from federal states. This is referred to as an autonomous state () or state of the autonomies (). 
* Part IX refers to the Constitutional Court, which oversees the constitutionality of all laws and protects the fundamental rights enshrined in Part I. 
* Part X refers to constitutional amendments, of which there have been only three since 1978 (in 1992, when Article #13 was reformed, in 2011, when Article #135 was reformed, and in 2024, when Article #49 was reformed).

== History ==

The constitutional history of Spain dates back to the Constitution of 1812. After the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, a general election in 1977 convened the Constituent Cortes (the Spanish Parliament, in its capacity as a constitutional assembly) for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution.

A seven-member panel was selected among the elected members of the &#x27; to work on a draft of the Constitution to be submitted to the body. These came to be known, as the media put it, as the &#x27; or &quot;fathers of the Constitution&quot;. The seven people were chosen to represent the wide (and often, deeply divided) political spectrum within the Spanish Parliament, while the leading role was given to then ruling party and now defunct Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD).
The members included:

The writer (and Senator by Royal appointment) Camilo José Cela later polished the draft Constitution&#x27;s wording. However, since much of the consensus depended on keeping the wording ambiguous, few of Cela&#x27;s proposed re-wordings were approved. One of those accepted was the substitution of the archaic &#x27; (&quot;weld-colored&quot;) for the plain &#x27; (yellow) in the description of the flag of Spain.

The constitution was approved by the on 31 October 1978, and by the Spanish people in a referendum on 6 December 1978. 91.81% of voters supported the new constitution. Finally, it was sanctioned by King Juan Carlos on 27 December in a ceremony in the presence of parliamentarians. It came into effect on 29 December, the day it was published in the Official Gazette.

Constitution Day () on 6 December has since been a national holiday in Spain.

==Content in-depth==
The Constitution contains 169 articles as well as a number of additional and transitory provisions.

Notably, the Constitution also formally repealed several important Spanish laws related the political history of the country: the Laws of 25 October 1839 and 21 July 1876, related to the Basque &quot;fuero&quot;s and the aftermath of the Carlist Wars, as well as all of the Fundamental Laws of the Realm were repealed. It also supersedes the Law of 4 January 1977, on Political Reform, which was conceived as a temporary mechanism to loosen restrictions on fundamental rights inherited from the Francoist period.

===Preamble===
Traditionally, writing the preamble to the constitution was considered an honour, and a task requiring great literary ability. The person chosen for this purpose was . The full text of the preamble may be translated as follows:

===Preliminary Title===
:Section 1. Spain is hereby established as a social and democratic State, subject to the rule of law, which advocates freedom, justice, equality and political pluralism as highest values of its legal system. National sovereignty belongs to the Spanish people, from whom all state powers emanate. The political form of the Spanish State is the Parliamentary Monarchy.

:Section 2. The Constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards; it recognizes and guarantees the right to self-government of the nationalities and regions of which it is composed and the solidarity among them all.

As a result, Spain is now composed entirely of 17 Autonomous Communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy, to the extent that, even though the Constitution does not formally state that Spain is a federation (nor a unitary state), actual power shows, depending on the issue considered, widely varying grades of decentralization, ranging from the quasi-confederal status of tax management in Navarre and the Basque Country to the total centralization in airport management.

===Part I: fundamental rights and duties===

Part I of the Spanish Constitution encompasses Sections 10 to 55, establishing fundamental rights and duties. The scope of the rights recognised by the text is the largest in Spanish constitutional history. Scholars deem the enumeration open insofar as new rights can be included under the principle of human dignity as a foundation of the political order and social peace (Section 10). This can be achieved by means of constitutional reform, jurisprudential developments or the ratification of new international treaties.

The effect of fundamental rights is twofold. They are subjective rights to be exercised both individually and collectively. In addition to this, they are a binding principle for all public authorities, which allows for peaceful coexistence and legitimates the political and social order.

==== Chapter One: Spaniards and Aliens ====
Chapter One deals with the entitlement of constitutional rights. Section 11 provides for the regulation by statute of Spanish nationality whilst providing for its inalienability for Spaniards. Section 12 establishes the age of majority in Spain at 18. Section 13 limits the entitlement of public freedoms to aliens to the provisions of statutes and international treaties.

Legal persons are entitled to a reduced array of rights, among which the right of association, the right to honour, the right to due process of law, freedom of speech and the inviolability of the home are included.

==== Chapter Two: Rights and Freedoms ====
Chapter Two begins with Section 14, an equal rights clause.

;Section One, fundamental rights and freedoms
Section One (Sections 15 to 29) includes an enumeration of fundamental rights and public freedoms. This section is entrenched, meaning it is extremely difficult to modify or repeal, in order to prevent the establishment of a &quot;legal dictatorship&quot; via constitutional amendment. Furthermore, an individual can request the protection of a justice court if any of these rights are infringed.

Individual rights include the right to life (Section 15), freedom of conscience (Section 16), right to freedom and security (Section 17), honour, privacy and inviolability of the home (Section 18), freedom of movement and residence (Section 19), and freedom of speech (Section 20). The list of collective rights include the right of assembly (Section 21), right of association (Section 22), right of suffrage (Section 23), right to education (Section 27) and the right to strike (Section 28). The due process of law is covered by Sections 24 to 26.

;Section two, other rights and obligations
Section Two of Chapter Two (Sections 30 to 38) includes a list of civic rights and duties. Section 30 includes military duties with guarantees and alternatives for conscientious objectors (this section has been inactive since 2002). Section 31 establishes a progressive and non-confiscatory tax system. The principles of family law are laid out in Section 32. Chapter Two also deals with the right to property (Section 33), to create foundations (Section 34), to work (Section 35), to create professional associations (Section 36) and to collective bargaining (Section 37). This Section also guarantees economic freedom and calls for a market economy which can be subject to government planning (Section 38).

==== Chapter Three: Governing Principles of Economic and Social Policy ====
Chapter Three includes Sections 39 to 52. They lay out the foundations of the Spanish welfare state in accordance with the constitutional mandate for a social state (Section 1) and for effective freedom and equality and societal integration for all citizens and collectives (Section 9, Part 2). It includes provisions for a public pension system, a social security system, public healthcare and cultural rights.

==== Chapter Four: Guarantees for Fundamental Rights and Freedoms ====
Chapter Four includes a series of guarantees for fundamental rights. Section 53 limits the regulation of all rights in Chapter Two and Chapter Three to statutory law, which excludes administrative regulation (&quot;reglamentos&quot;). These statutes must respect the essential content of said rights. The fundamental rights and public freedoms included in Section One of Chapter Two can be invoked directly, and they ought to be regulated by means of Organic Law (which ensures greater political consensus). The creation of this statute cannot be delegated to the executive power.

Section 54 calls for the creation of an Ombudsman (&quot;Defensor del Pueblo&quot;), accountable to the legislative power, the . It acts as a supervisor of administrative activity. In addition to this, it has standing before the Constitutional Court to lodge unconstitutionality appeals and individual appeals for protection &quot;(recurso de amparo)&quot;.

Sections 14 to 29 and Section 30, Part 2, enjoy the right to a preferential and summary procedure in the ordinary courts. Once this procedure is exhausted, citizens may lodge an individual appeal for protection &quot;(recurso de amparo)&quot;, a last instance unique to Spanish constitutional law and created in 1978 that, once exhausted, allows for an appeal before the European Court of Human Rights. This scope of additional protection reinforces the guarantees of the due process of law, including the process of habeas corpus.

In addition to this, the Prime Minister, the Ombudsman, 50 members of the Congress of Deputies, 50 Senators, and regional governments and legislative assemblies may lodge unconstitutionality appeals before the Constitutional Court.

===Part II: Crown===

The Constitution dedicates its Part II to the regulation of the monarchy, which is referred to as &quot;The Crown&quot; (). Article 56 of the Constitution establishes that the monarch is the head of state and symbolizes the unity of the Spanish state. It refers to the monarch&#x27;s role as a &quot;moderator&quot; whose main role is to oversee and ensure the regular functioning of the institutions. The monarch is also the highest-ranked representative of the Spanish state in international relations and only exercises the functions that are explicitly attributed to him by the Constitution and the laws. The King&#x27;s official title is &quot;King of Spain&quot; (), but he is allowed to use any other titles that are associated to the Spanish Crown.

The King of Spain enjoys immunity and is not subject to legal accountability. In a broad sense, this means that the King cannot be legally prosecuted. Some jurists say that this only refers to criminal procedures, while others claim this immunity is also present in civil procedures; in practice, the King has never been prosecuted and it is unlikely that he would be prosecuted even if it was proven that the monarch had committed a crime. The legal justification for royal immunity is that the King is mandated by the Constitution to fulfill several roles as the head of state; thus, the King is obligated to perform his actions and fulfill his duties, so the King cannot be judged for actions that he is constitutionally obligated to perform.

====Refrendo====

The King is vested with executive power, but is not personally responsible for exercising it. This does not mean that his actions are free of responsibility. The responsibility for the King&#x27;s actions falls into the persons who hold actual political power and who actually take political decisions, which the King only formally and symbolically ratifies. This is done through a procedure or institution called the &quot;refrendo&quot; (&quot;countersigning&quot; in the official English translation of the constitution).

All the King&#x27;s acts have to undergo the refrendo procedure. Through the refrendo, other persons assume legal and political responsibility for the King&#x27;s acts, if such responsibility is demanded from them. Article 64 explains the refrendo and transfers responsibility for royal acts to the Prime Minister in most cases, though it also allows other ministers to assume responsibility for royal acts as well. In general, when there is not a formed government, the responsibility is assumed by the President of the Congress of Deputies. Without the refrendo, the King&#x27;s actions are null and void.

There are only two royal acts that do not require the refrendo. The first encompasses all acts related to the management of the Royal House of Spain; the King can freely hire and fire any employees of the Royal House and he receives an annual amount from the state budget to operate the Royal House, which he freely distributes across the institution. The second one refers to the King&#x27;s will, which enables him to distribute his material legacy and name tutors for his children, if they are not legal adults.

====King&#x27;s functions in the Spanish state====

Article 62 of the Spanish Constitution establishes an exhaustive list of the King&#x27;s functions, all of which are symbolic and do not reflect the exercise of any political power. The King sanctions and promulgates the laws, which are approved by the , which the King also symbolically and formally calls and dissolves. The King also calls for periodic elections and for referendums in the cases that are included by the laws or the Constitution.

The King also proposes a candidate for Prime Minister, which is probably the King&#x27;s most &#x27;political&#x27; function, as he traditionally holds meetings with the leaders of all the major political parties in order to facilitate the formation of a government. If a candidate is successfully invested by the Parliament, he formally names him Prime Minister of Spain. When a Prime Minister has been named, he also formally names all the members of his government, all of which are proposed by the Prime Minister himself. The King has both a right and a duty to be informed of all the state affairs; he is also allowed to preside over the government meetings when the Prime Minister invites him to do so, although he has the ability to reject this invitation.

Regarding the Government, the King also formally issues the governmental decrees, as well as bestowing all the civil and military ranks and employments, and he also grants honors and distinctions according to the laws. The King is also the supreme head of the Armed Forces of Spain, although the effective lead is held by the Government of Spain. Finally, the King holds the High Patronage of all the Royal Academies and other organizations that have a royal patronage.

====Succession to the Crown====

The succession to the Crown is regulated in article 57 which establishes a male preference primogeniture to the successors of King Juan Carlos I and his dynasty, the Bourbon dynasty. The heir to the throne receives the title of Prince or Princess of Asturias as well as the other historic titles of the heir and the other children received the title of Infantes or Infantas.

If some person with rights of succession marries against the will of the King or Queen regnant or the , they shall be excluded from succession to the Crown, as shall their descendants. This article also establishes that if the lines are extinguished, the shall decide who will be the new King or Queen attending to the general interests of the country.

Finally, article 57.5 establishes that abdications or any legal doubt about the succession must be clarified by an Organic Act.

This legal forecast was exercised for the first time of the current democratic period in 2014 when King Juan Carlos abdicated in favor of his son. The Organic Act 3/2014 made effective the abdication of the King. A Royal decree of the same year also modified the Royal Decree of 1987 which establishes the titles of the Royal family and the Regents and arranged that the outgoing King and Queen shall conserve their titles. And the Organic Act 4/2014 modified the Organic Act of the Judiciary to allow the former Kings to conserve their judicial prerogatives (immunity).

====Regency====
The Regency is regulated in article 59. The Regency is a period in which a person exercises the duties of the King or Queen regnant on behalf of the real monarch who is a minor. This article establishes that the King or Queen&#x27;s mother or father shall immediately assume the office of regent and, in the absence of these, the oldest relative of legal age who is nearest in succession to the Crown.

Article 59 § 2 establishes that the monarch may be declared incapacitated by Parliament if the monarch becomes unfit for the exercise of authority, in which case the Prince or Princess of Asturias shall assume the regency if they are of age; if not, the previous procedure must be followed.

If there is no person entitled to exercise the regency, the shall appoint one regent or a council of three or five persons known as the Council of Regency. The regent must be a Spaniard and legally of age.

The Constitution also establishes in article 60 that the guardian of the King or Queen during their minority cannot be the same as the person who acts as regent, unless the regent is the father, the mother, or a direct ancestor of the King. Parents can be guardian while widowed. If the parent marries again, the parent loses the guardianship, and the shall appoint a guardian who must comply with the same requirements as to be regent.

Article 60 § 2 also establishes that the exercise of the guardianship is also incompatible with the holding of any office or political representation so that no person can be the guardian of the monarch while holding a political office.

===Part III: Cortes Generales===
Part III (Sections 66 to 96) deals with the , the Spanish legislature. It consists of two chambers: the Congress of Deputies and the Senate of Spain, with the former being privileged above the latter, in contrast with other upper chambers, such as the Italian Senate of the Republic.

Each chamber is provided with internal regulatory powers for governance, a Speaker (&quot;Presidente&quot;) and a Governing Board (&quot;Mesa&quot;). The Permanent Deputation exerts a limited series of powers during recesses and after the dissolution of the chambers. Joint sessions of the Cortes are presided by the Speaker of the Congress of Deputies under a common procedure code passed by a majority of each chamber.

The Cortes exert legislative, budgetary and control powers over the executive. They have the power to appoint members to the Constitutional Court, the General Council of the Judiciary, the Court of Auditors and the Ombudsman. They have control over the line of succession of the Spanish Crown, with the power to appoint Regents, Tutors and to elect a new head of state according to the interest of Spain if all sucessory lines are exhausted.

Each chambers works in a Plenary or by Commissions, work groups with a composition proportional to each party&#x27;s representation. Commissions may be assigned the study of bills and matters by the Governing Board, and the Plenary may delegate unto them the passing of certain bills, excluding those related to constitutional reform, international matters, organic laws and the budget. Commissions can be legislative and non-legislative, and permanent or temporary.

==== Congress of Deputies ====
Section 68 provides for a lower chamber with a minimum of three hundred and a maximum of four hundred Deputies, elected by universal, free, equal, direct and secret suffrage. The electoral districts are the provinces and the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, with a minimum of two seats for each province and one seat for each city, the rest being apportioned by population. All deputies are elected in each district by proportional representation.

==== Senate ====
Section 69 establishes the Senate as an upper and territorial chamber. It is elected under a mixed system where 208 Senators are elected directly by universal, free, equal, direct and secret suffrage and the rest are indirectly appointed by the legislative assemblies of the autonomous communities.

Senators are elected by limited voting, with citizens being able to elect all but one members of a district. This affords the second most voted party in each district a degree of representation.

The attributions of the Spanish Senate are subordinate to those of the Spanish Congress, which makes it comparable to the Senate of Canada or the House of Councillors of the National Diet of Japan insofar as it may exert limited control and review powers over the lower chamber.

===Part IV: government===
Section 97 vests the executive power in the Government of Spain, which runs the country&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy, the civil and military administration and the national defense.

Section 98 states that the Government shall be composed of the President (referred to in English as the Prime Minister), the Vice Presidents if any (referred to in English as the Deputy Prime Ministers), and any other members listed in statute. The Prime Minister runs the Government&#x27;s policy and coordinates the faculties of the others members of the Government.

Section 99 describes the procedure of appointment of the Prime Minister. After an election, or any other event that triggers an appointment, the King shall meet with all the leaders of the political groups in the , then choose one of them to face an investiture vote. The President of the Congress of Deputies holds veto power over the King&#x27;s choice. The investiture vote is successful, and the nominee becomes Prime Minister, if he gets the absolute majority vote of the Congress of Deputies in the first roll call, or a simple majority (more yeas than noes) in a second roll call that takes place two days after the first. The process can be repeated with the same or other political leader chosen by the King within two months after the first roll call; after that time, a general election to both chambers is automatically called.

Section 100 states that the ministers are appointed and dismissed by the King by the Prime Minister&#x27;s proposal.

Section 101 states that the Government is dismissed after a general election, the loss of supply or confidence of the Congress of Deputies, or the resignation or death of the Prime Minister. The dismissed Government holds caretaker powers until a new Government is inaugurated.

Section 102 stablishes the conditions for prosecution of criminal accountability for the Prime Minister or any other member of the Government, explicitly stating they cannot pardon themselves.

Sections 103 to 107 stablish the role of the General State Administration, the law enforcement organizations, the Council of State, and the obligation of the Government to grant due process, to abide by judiciary decisions and to fulfill any public liability to the individuals.

===Part V: relations between the Cortes Generales and the government===
Article 115 deals with the mechanisms of how and when Congress, the Senate, or the can be dissolved. This measure requires approval from the King of Spain, who must establish a date for the elections. The proposal for dissolution cannot be submitted during a censure.

====Article 116====
:&quot;Section 1. A state of alarm shall be declared by the Government, by means of a decree decided upon by the Council of Ministers, for a maximum period of fifteen days. The Congress of Deputies shall be informed and must meet immediately for this purpose. Without their authorisation, the said period may not be extended. The decree shall specify the territorial area to which the effects of the proclamation shall apply.&quot;
:&quot;Section 2. A state of emergency shall be declared by the Government by means of a decree decided upon by the Council of Ministers, after prior authorisation by the Congress of Deputies. The authorisation for and declaration of a state of emergency must specifically state the effects thereof, the territorial area to which it is to apply and its duration, which may not exceed thirty days, subject to extension for a further thirty-day period, with the same requirements.&quot;
:&quot;Section 3. A state of siege (martial law) shall be declared by absolute majority of the Congress of Deputies, exclusively at the proposal of the Government. Congress shall determine its territorial extension, duration and terms.&quot;

For the duration where any of those acts of Article 116 are declared, Congress cannot be dissolved. In the event that Congress had been dissolved or its term expires, the powers of Congress are assumed by the Standing Committee. Since the constitution of Spain was adopted, the state of alarm was only declared twice: once in 2010 for the Spanish air traffic controllers strike, and in March 2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic. The first state of emergency was declared in October 2020 as a result of continued difficulties for the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Part VI: judiciary===

Article 117 establishes the independence of the judiciary and the law. In cases of martial law, military activity is limited by the Constitution.
Articles 119 to 120 establish the right to a public, fair trial, with the right to an attorney for indigent defendants.
Article 121 mandates compensation in case of damages caused by legal irregularities.
Article 127 forbids serving magistrates and prosecutors from political party membership or public office.

===Part VII: economy and taxation===

Article 128 allows the State to intervene in corporate affairs to restrict monopolies or serve the public interest.

Deficits and debt shall not exceed standards set by the European Union.

===Part VIII: territorial model===
====Article 143====
:&quot;Section 1. In the exercise of the right to self-government recognized in Article 2 of the Constitution, bordering provinces with common historic, cultural and economic characteristics, island territories and provinces with historic regional status may accede to self-government and form Autonomous Communities in conformity with the provisions contained in this Title and in the respective Statutes.&quot;
The Spanish Constitution is one of the few Bill of Rights that has legal provisions for social rights, including the definition of Spain itself as a &quot;Social and Democratic State, subject to the rule of law&quot; () in its preliminary title. However, those rights are not at the same level of protection as the individual rights contained in articles 14 to 28, since those social rights are considered in fact principles and directives of economic policy, but never full rights of the citizens to be claimed before a court or tribunal.

Other constitutional provisions recognize the right to adequate housing, employment, social welfare provision, health protection and pensions.

Thanks to the political influence of Santiago Carrillo of the Communist Party of Spain, and with the consensus of the other &quot;fathers of the constitution&quot;, the right to State intervention in private companies in the public interest and the facilitation of access by workers to ownership of the means of production were also enshrined in the Constitution.

====Article 155====
:&quot;Section 1. If a self-governing community does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws, or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of Spain, the government may take all measures necessary to compel the community to meet said obligations, or to protect the above-mentioned general interest.&quot;
:&quot;Section 2. With a view to implementing the measures provided for in the foregoing paragraph, the Government may issue instructions to all the authorities of the Self-governing Communities.&quot;

This wording is almost identical to Article 37 of the German Basic Law.

On October 27, 2017, the Senate of Spain (Senado) voted 214 to 47 to invoke Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution over Catalonia after the Catalan Parliament unilaterally declared independence. Article 155 gave Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy the power to remove secessionist politicians, including Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan leader, and directly rule from Madrid.

===Part IX: Constitutional Court===

The King appoints all twelve members of the Constitutional Court. Four are nominated by a 3/5 majority in Congress; four are nominated by a 3/5 majority in the Senate. Two are nominated by the government, and the last two by the General Council of the Judiciary. They can serve a maximum of 9 years divided into three 3-year renewable terms. Serving magistrates and prosecutors, politicians, political party members, or active businessmen can not serve on the Constitutional Court.

===Part X: constitutional amendment===
There are two methods of amending the Spanish Constitution, detailed below. The Government, the Congress of Deputies or the Senate can propose constitutional amendments. The Parliaments of the Autonomous Communities can also propose a constitutional amendment to the Congress or the Government, but cannot propose an amendment directly.

There have been 3 amendments to the Spanish constitution, one in 1992, one in 2011 and one in 2024, all were passed with the necessary majority and without a referendum being requested.

====Ordinary provisions====
A constitutional amendment must be approved by a three-fifths majority by both the Congress of Deputies and the Senate. If there is disagreement between the Chambers, a mixed committee will present an agreed text to both chambers for a vote. Even if this procedure fails, and as long as the amendment passed with a simple majority in the Senate, Congress may pass the amendment with two-thirds majority. One-tenth of either deputies or senators may also request, with a 15-day deadline since passage, that the amendment be put to a referendum.

====Entrenched provisions====
Three parts of the Constitution are entrenched: the Preliminary Title, Section I of Chapter II of Title I (on Fundamental Rights and Public Liberties), and Title II (on the Crown). Under Title X, these cannot be altered except by the same process that would be required for adoption of a new constitution:
* two-thirds of each House approve the amendment,
* elections are called immediately thereafter,
* two-thirds of each new House approves the amendment, and
* the amendment is approved by the people in a referendum.

==Amendments==
The Constitution has been amended three times. The first time, Article 13.2, Title I was altered to extend to citizens of the European Union the right to active and passive suffrage (both voting rights and eligibility as candidates) in local elections under the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty. The second time, in August/September 2011, a balanced budget amendment and debt brake was added to Article 135. The third amendment, passed in January 2024, amends the language of Article 49 to read &quot;persons with disabilities&quot;, rather than those who are &quot;handicapped&quot;.

While the current version of the Constitution restricts the death penalty to military courts during wartime, the death penalty has since been removed from the Code of Military Justice and thus lost all relevance. Amnesty International has still requested an amendment to be made to the Constitution to abolish it firmly and explicitly in all cases.

Amnesty International Spain, Oxfam Intermón and Greenpeace launched a campaign in 2015 to amend the article 53 so that it extends the same protection to economic, social and cultural rights as to other rights like life or freedom.
After that, the campaign seeks another 24 amendments protecting human rights, the environment and social justice.

===Reform of the autonomy statutes===
The &quot;Statutes of Autonomy&quot; of the different regions are the second most important Spanish legal normatives when it comes to the political structure of the country. Because of that, the reform attempts of some of them have been either rejected or produced considerable controversy.

The plan conducted by the Basque president Juan José Ibarretxe (known as Ibarretxe Plan) to reform the status of the Basque Country in the Spanish state was rejected by the Spanish Cortes, on the grounds (among others) that it amounted to an implicit reform of the Constitution.

The People&#x27;s Party attempted to reject the admission into the Cortes of the 2005 reform of the Autonomy Statute of Catalonia on the grounds that it should be dealt with as a constitutional reform rather than a mere statute reform because it allegedly contradicts the spirit of the Constitution in many points, especially the Statute&#x27;s alleged breaches of the &quot;solidarity between regions&quot; principle enshrined by the Constitution. After failing to assemble the required majority to dismiss the text, the People&#x27;s Party filed a claim of unconstitutionality against several dozen articles of the text before the Spanish Constitutional Court for them to be struck down.

The amended Autonomy Statute of Catalonia has also been legally contested by the surrounding Autonomous Communities of Aragon, Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community on similar grounds as those of the PP, and others such as disputed cultural heritage. As of January 2008, the Constitutional Court of Spain has those alleged breaches and its actual compliance with the Constitution under judicial review.

Prominent Spanish politicians, mostly from the People&#x27;s Party but also from the Socialist Party (PSOE) and other non-nationalist parties, have advocated for the statutory reform process to be more closely compliant with the Constitution, on the grounds that the current wave of reforms threatens the functional destruction of the constitutional system itself. The most cited arguments are the self-appointed unprecedented expansions of the powers of autonomous communities present in recently reformed statutes:

* The amended version of the Catalan Statute prompts the State to allot investments in Catalonia according to Catalonia&#x27;s own percentage contribution to the total Spanish GDP. The Autonomy Statute of Andalusia, a region that contributes less to Spain&#x27;s GDP than the region of Catalonia contributes, requires it in turn to allocate state investments in proportion to its population (it is the largest Spanish Autonomous Community in terms of population). These requirements are legally binding, as they are enacted as part of Autonomy Statutes, which rank only below the Constitution itself. It is self-evident that, should all autonomous communities be allowed to establish their particular financing models upon the State, the total may add up to more than 100% and that would be unviable. Despite these changes having been proposed and approved by fellow members of the PSOE, former Finance Minister Pedro Solbes disagreed with this new trend of assigning state investment quotas to territories based on any given autonomous community custom requirement and has subsequently compared the task of planning the Spanish national budget to a sudoku.
* The Valencian statute, whose reform was one of the first to be enacted, includes the so-called Camps clause (named after the Valencian President Francisco Camps), which makes any powers assumed by other communities in its statutes automatically available to the Valencian Community.
* Autonomous communities such as Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia or Extremadura, have included statutory clauses claiming exclusive powers over any river flowing through their territories. Nearby communities have filed complaints before the Spanish Constitutional Court on the grounds that no Community can exercise exclusive power over rivers that cross more than one Community, not even over the part flowing through its territory because its decisions affect other Communities, both downstream or upstream.

==Proposed amendments==
===Reform of the Senate===

In the late 1990s, the Catalonian nationalist party, Convergence and Union, attempted to reform the Senate based on three tiers of autonomous communities. However, the People&#x27;s Party government suspended these attempts.

<text>The consort kin or [[Outer kins (Chinese)|outer kins]] () were the kin or a group of people related to an empress dowager or a consort of a monarch or a warlord in the Sinosphere. The leading figure of the clan was either a (usually male) sibling, cousin, or parent of the empress dowager or consort.

Consort kins can be seen as a manifestation of nepotism in Sinospheric imperial politics. While some were competent, only relying on their female relatives for their initial audiences with the emperor and then proving their worth at their positions (e.g. Wei Qing and Huo Qubing), many turned out to be corrupt and incompetent (e.g. Yang Guozhong). Corrupt and incompetent consort kins have been linked to the downward turn of fortunes for many dynasties.

<doc id="299424" wikidata="Q3457490" url="?curid=299424" title="Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport">
<text>Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport is a county-owned public airport in Kalamazoo, Kalamazoo County, Michigan, US, southeast of Downtown Kalamazoo. The airport is located approximately west of the city of Battle Creek. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2023-27, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.

The airport has an Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and a Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON). It has one passenger terminal and five gates. Two airlines operate flights in and out of AZO.

==History==
Plans for an airport in Kalamazoo began in 1925. In May 1926, the City of Kalamazoo purchased near Portage and Kilgore roads and an airport opened. The first regular air mail service started in July 1928. In February 1929, the field was licensed as the first municipal airport in Michigan. It was named Lindbergh Field in honor of famous aviator Charles Lindbergh.
Airline service came to Kalamazoo in May 1944. Two commuter airlines, Francis Airways and Northern Skyways, provided service to other Michigan cities, then ceased the flights after two years. From 1946 and 1955, several small airlines offered commuter flights to nearby cities.

In May 1955, North Central Airlines began daily service to Detroit and Chicago. North Central became Republic Airlines, which merged into Northwest Airlines, which in turn merged into Delta Air Lines – which serves the airport today.

In 1961, an airport traffic control tower was built and the main runway was extended from 3,900 feet to 5,300. In 1963, an instrument landing system was installed to help during poor weather. In 1977, the runway was further lengthened to 6,500 feet.

In 1975, the regional air traffic control facility was moved from Battle Creek to Kalamazoo, and, in 1978, a radar facility was installed. The airport eventually won an award for the safest and most efficient air traffic control system in the Great Lakes region.

In 1982, the Core Council decided that the City of Kalamazoo should no longer bear the full cost of operating the airport, and, in 1984, the City transferred ownership to the County of Kalamazoo. In 1989, the name was changed from Kalamazoo County Airport to Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International to stimulate economic growth in the Battle Creek area. That year, the county also renovated the terminal, doubling its size and expanding the ramp. Over the next four years, passengers increased from 200,000 to more than 500,000 per annum.
In 2011, the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport was served by two major airlines who fly passengers to major hubs with worldwide connections. There was also a public charter airline operating twice weekly from Kalamazoo to locations in Florida.

As of May 2012, the airport was served by two major commercial airlines who fly passengers to three major hubs. The public charter Direct Air was subject to Chapter 7 liquidation on April 12, 2012 and has since ceased all operations.

In November 2021, United Airlines announced that it would end service to AZO, effective January 3, 2022. The departure by United left only Delta and American as major airlines with service to Kalamazoo/Battle Creek.

In 2022, low-cost airline startup Avelo Airlines started twice-weekly flights between Kalamazoo and Orlando. However, in July 2024, the carrier terminated this service, citing unprofitability. 

===Major jetport===
In the 1970s, there were discussions between North Central Airlines and local city officials about building a new airport to serve Battle Creek and Kalamazoo. Since the two airports are close, it was not economical for the airlines to fully serve both of the airports. They proposed a &quot;Major Jetport&quot; in the Kalamazoo area, which might have become the third-busiest commuter airport in the nation. No location could be agreed upon, and no planning was ever completed beyond the preliminary proposals and meetings. Soon after the concept failed, most airline service was shifted to Kalamazoo, as the Kalamazoo airport had more passengers and more demand for flights.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport covers at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has three asphalt runways: 17/35, , 05/23, and 09/27, .

Present-day taxiways Delta and Alpha were originally runways.

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2022, the airport had 52,162 flight operations. This included 82% general aviation, 18% air taxi and commercial, and &lt;1% military. This is down from the historical average annual operations in the 1990s of 101,754. Current based aircraft at the airport include 127 aircraft: 92 single-engine and 15 multi-engine airplanes as well as 20 jets.

===2007 re-phasing plan===
In 2007, the threshold of runway 17/35 was moved to the south, and taxiway B was closed north of taxiway C. South of runway 09/27, taxiway B was removed and rebuilt to the west.

==Operations==

===General aviation===

Kalamazoo Airport is used by transient and local private pilots flying for personal reasons, business, or recreation. Many local pilots keep their aircraft in the south T-hangar complex.

In 1955, the Kalamazoo-based Upjohn Pharmaceutical Company began operating aircraft for its executives from the airport. This continued after the firm was acquired by Pfizer. In 1997, after Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn moved its North American sales office from Michigan to New Jersey, the company made daily service to New Jersey available to all employees on a 10-seat jet. Pfizer expanded the service after acquiring Pharmacia Corp. in 2003 and based two 36-passenger jets at the airport. But, in June 2008, the aviation unit was closed after 53 years to save money. The move axed 27 jobs; the aircraft were moved to Trenton, New Jersey. As of April 2009, the hangar and property at the Kalamazoo Airport were up for sale.

General aviation aircraft are served by FBOs Duncan Aviation, RAI Jets, the Kalamazoo Pilot Association, and Kalamazoo Aircraft Inc. Besides fuel, these businesses combined offer services such as customer shuttles, aircraft maintenance, private jet charters, and both routine and major maintenance.

===Flight training===
Flight training is offered through Kal-Aero Flight Instruction.

The Western Michigan University College of Aviation, founded in 1939, used the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport as a base for its flight school until 1997. In the early 1990s, the flight school began to outgrow the facilities, and, in 1997, the college moved to Battle Creek&#x27;s W. K. Kellogg Airport, where all operations are presently housed. The WMU aviation unit at Kalamazoo has been used from time to time by the college, but not since May 2006.

In the 1970s, private flight training operations were restricted to two local FBOs: Kal Aero and Lakala Aviation. The county government received many complaints about unauthorized lessons from private parties. Upon these reports, the county government added to the flight training ordinance that violators could be fined $500, or jailed for 90 days, if found guilty of offering flight lessons illegally. This restriction has since been lifted, but those providing flight instruction must have an agreement with the airport and follow airport rules and regulations.

==Airlines and destinations==
==Top domestic destinations==
===Competition===
The facility competes with airports in nearby communities such as South Bend, Grand Rapids, Chicago, and Detroit. Furthermore, the airport has used several grants and incentives to attract and retain additional flights and carriers in recent years.

==Terminal==

The original Kalamazoo terminal was a small building made with scrap materials left over from other local projects. In 1958, a new terminal was constructed to replace the 1920s terminal. The growth led to a terminal expansion in 1979, and the building increased from 12,000 to . The terminal was completely renovated in 1989, with the addition of a new concourse, an enlarged boarding area, and a new baggage claim area.

The Kalamazoo Airport&#x27;s 1958 terminal had two jetways and housed the air traffic control tower. A Non-Radar Approach Control, located in Battle Creek and servicing Kalamazoo, was Commissioned in 1969. The air traffic control tower provides ATC services between the hours of 6:00–23:00 local time. When the control tower is operational, the airport lies within FAA Class &quot;D&quot; airspace. When the approach control is operational, pilots may elect to receive radar services associated within a Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA). The Terminal Control Center (TRACON) facility was not established until 1975, and radar was not installed until 1978.

In 2009, construction on a new terminal began next to the existing facility. The new terminal, designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills, opened in April 2011 and accommodates additional passenger gates, security lanes, and baggage carousels.
==Kalamazoo Aviation History Museum==

Commonly referred to as the &quot;Air Zoo&quot;, the museum offers many historic aircraft, simulators, a restaurant, and one of the region&#x27;s only 4-D theaters. The museum is housed in two buildings, and is located on the south section of the field. The museum also has a fly in ramp, making it an attraction for many visiting pilots. In June and October 2011 the Air Zoo opened a new building connecting it to the main building allowing all the attractions and exhibits to be in one easy to see location. The original building (East Campus) was renovated to house the restoration center.

==Incidents and accidents==
Several accidents and incidents have occurred at Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport. These incidents are responded to by the onsite CFR team.
*On July 25, 1978, a North Central Airlines Convair 580 hit a female sparrow hawk shortly after takeoff. Pilots failed to follow proper engine-out procedures and crash-landed the aircraft in a nearby cornfield. There were several serious injuries but no fatalities.
*On November 21, 1983, a Republic Airlines DC-9 headed for Kalamazoo from Detroit was hijacked. The hijacker was overthrown.
*On September 19, 1996, a privately-owned Grumman F9F-2 Panther crashed while takeoff on runway 35. Pilot attempted a takeoff abort but over ran the end of the runway crashed through a boundary fence, crossed over Kilgore Road, and came to rest on an embankment. Pilot suffered numerous injuries and aircraft was a total loss.
*On April 19, 1998, a Piper PA-28 Series Aircraft crashed. Witnesses reported seeing the airplane liftoff runway 5 past the runway 17/35 intersection located approximately from the approach end of runway 5. Runway 5 was long at the time of the accident. Witnesses reported the airplane climbed to when the airplane rolled left and went straight down. The airplane burst into flames and the cockpit and fuselage were consumed by fire. All passengers died.
*On May 28, 1999, a Cessna 210 overran the departure end of runway 27 and struck an airport boundary fence and an automobile on Portage Road, which runs perpendicular to the runway.
*On June 26, 1999, a Boeing PT-17 ground looped while landing.
*On April 4, 2004, a Cessna 172 operated by a university aviation training program, was blown off of the runway by high winds. No injuries were reported.
*On October 27, 2009, a single-engine Beechcraft crashed. The aircraft landed north of the airport, but not on the runway. It skidded through the fence and came to rest in the parking lot of Great Lakes Aviation, just outside the airfield. The aircraft was reported to be en route to Muskoka, Ontario when it experienced some mechanical problem and then crash landed at the north end of the runway. The pilot, who was also the only occupant, died in the accident.
*On November 1, 2019, a small plane crashed after takeoff at the airport due to a mechanical issue. The pilot attempted to return to a runway but instead landed on a grass field nearby.

The region comprises seven provinces: Aurora, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga (with its capital, San Fernando City serving as the regional center), Tarlac, and Zambales; and two highly urbanized cities, Angeles and Olongapo. San Jose del Monte is the most populous city in the region. The region contains the largest plain in the country and produces most of the country&#x27;s rice supply, earning itself the nickname &quot;Rice Granary of the Philippines&quot;. It is also the region to have the most number of provinces.

==Etymology==
The current name of the region refers to its position on the island of Luzon. The term was coined by American colonialists after the defeat of the First Philippine Republic. There have been proposals to rename the current Central Luzon region into the Luzones region. The proposed name is in reference to the old name of Luzon island, Luções, which was later used to refer to the central area of the island, stretching from Pangasinan in the north, all the way to Pampanga in the south. The term Luções literally translates into Luzones.

==History==
=== Prehistoric and early historic eras ===

While there are a number of competing models of migration to the Philippines, it is generally believed that The earliest modern human migrations into the Philippine islands were during the Paleolithic, around 40,000 years ago, representing the people from whom the Aeta peoples have been believed by researchers to be descended. This was followed by two other migration waves between 25,000 and 12,000 years ago. The latest migration wave is associated with the Austronesian peoples, circa 7,000 years ago. Kapampangans, Sambal people and the Sinauna (lit. &quot;those from the beginning&quot;), originated in southern Luzon, where they made contact with the migrating Tagalog settlers, of which contact between the Kapampangans and Tagalogs was most intensive. After this, the original settlers moved northward: Kapampangans moved to modern Tondo, Navotas, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Aurora, Pampanga, south Tarlac, and east Bataan, and Sambals to the modern province of Zambales, in turn, displacing the Aetas. The flatlands of the southern portion of Upper Pampanga (now Nueva Ecija), was a hospitable place for these new Tagalog settlers between 300 and 200 B.C. Tagalogs from southern Luzon, most specifically Cavite, migrated to parts of Bataan. Aetas were displaced to the mountain areas by the end of the 16th century. Kapampangans settled Aurora alongside Aetas and Bugkalots. Pangasinan people are the native settlers in northwest area of Central Luzon; Igorot people, particularly Kalanguya, Isinay, and Bugkalot, are native residents in northern area of Central Luzon, precisely present-day Nueva Ecija, with the Bugkalots also live in northwest Aurora.

=== Colonial era ===
When the Spaniards arrived and settled the Philippines, Provincia de La Pampanga was established in the largest area of Central Luzon in 1571; portion of Central Luzon was made up of Pangasinán created in 1580. The next provinces that were created out of Pampanga were Bulacan and Zambales which were both established in 1578. Baler &amp; Casiguran became part of Kalilayan, which included modern Nueva Ecija, until Kalilayan changed its name to Tayabas in 1749, taken from the town of the same name. Nueva Ecija was created as a military district or &quot;comandancia&quot; governed by Governor-General Fausto Cruzat y Góngora in 1701, but still part of Pampanga at that time. It included huge swathes of Central Luzon, the Contracosta towns, as well as the Kalilayan area and Polillo Islands. Contracosta was the Spanish colonial name for the towns on the east coast and included towns from Mauban, Binangonan de Lampon, to El Principe. Since Contracosta &amp; Kalilayan were part of La Laguna province at that time before including them in Nueva Ecija, they became jointly ruled by La Pampanga &amp; La Laguna provinces. Historian Cornelio Bascara documents that the province of Bataan was established on January 11, 1757, by Governor-General Pedro Manuel Arandia out of territories belonging to Pampanga and the &quot;corregimiento&quot; of Mariveles which, at that time, included Maragondon across Manila Bay. Tagalogs migrated to east Bataan, where Kapampangans assimilated to the Tagalogs. Kapampangans were displaced to the towns near Pampanga by that time, along with the Aetas.

When the polities of Tondo and Maynila fell due to the Spanish, the Tagalog-majority areas grew through Tagalog migrations in portions of Central Luzon and north Mimaropa as a Tagalog migration policy was implemented by Spain. This happened again when British occupation of Manila happened in 1762, when many Tagalog refugees from Manila and north areas of Cavite escaped to Bulacan and to neighboring Nueva Ecija, where the original Kapampangan settlers welcomed them; Bulacan and Nueva Ecija were natively Kapampangan when Spaniards arrived; majority of Kapampangans sold their lands to the newly arrived Tagalog settlers and others intermarried with and assimilated to the Tagalog, which made Bulacan and Nueva Ecija dominantly Tagalog, many of the Tagalog settlers arrived in Nueva Ecija directly from Bulacan; also, the sparsely populated valley of the Zambales region was later settled by migrants, largely from the Tagalog and Ilocos regions, leading to the assimilation of Sambals to the Tagalog and Ilocano settlers and to the modern decline in the Sambal identity and language. The same situation happened in modern Aurora, where it was repopulated by settlers from Tagalog and Ilocos regions, with other settlers from Cordillera and Isabela, and married with some Aeta and Bugkalots, this led to the assimilation of Kapampangans to the Tagalog settlers. Kapampangans were the native residents of the northwest areas of Nueva Ecija; Pangasinan settlers moved there during early years of Spanish territorial period until the Kapampangans assimilated to the Pangasinan settlers. In the 19th century, repopulation and rice and tobacco industries caused large numbers of Ilocano settlers to move and stay in north areas of Central Luzon (Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, and Aurora) and south central Zambales; they now made up the largest ethnic group in those areas. The Tagalog and Ilocano migrations and settlements made Tagalog the lingua franca of Central Luzon and Ilocano the lingua franca in north areas of the region and south central Zambales. Many Ilocano settlers became assimilated in the areas with the Kapampangan and Tagalog majority populations, adopting Kapampangan and Tagalog as their native language while speaking Ilocano as 2nd language. Ilocano migrations and settlements continued in modern Aurora and Nueva Ecija in U.S. territorial rule in 20th century; in Aurora, Ilocano settlers lived in Dingalan and Dipaculao.

When Rafael María de Aguilar y Ponce de León took over as governor-general of the Philippines, he decreed the separation of the military- district of Nueva Ecija from the province of Pampanga and became a regular province on April 25, 1801, including the town of Baler, acquired from Tayabas.

In 1818, Nueva Ecija annexed the towns of Palanan from Isabela, as well as Baler, Casiguran, Infanta (formerly called Binangonan de Lampon) and Polillo Islands from Tayabas, and Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, and part of Rizal. In 1853, the new military district of Tayabas was separated from Nueva Ecija and included present-day Southern Quezon as well as present-day Aurora. In 1858, Binangonan de Lampon and the Polillo Islands were separated from Nueva Ecija to form part of Infanta. Between 1855 and 1885, El Principe was established as its own Military Comandancia under the rule of Nueva Ecija with its capital in Baler. In 1873, Tarlac was established and was created from south Pangasinan and north Pampanga; this is the last province to be created in Central Luzon.

In 1901, towns of Nueva Ecija, namely Balungao, Rosales, San Quintin and Umingan were annexed to the province of Pangasinan. On November 30, 1903, several municipalities from northern Zambales including Agno, Alaminos, Anda, Bani, Bolinao, Burgos, Dasol, Infanta and Mabini were ceded to Pangasinan by the American colonial government. These municipalities were a part of the homeland of the Sambal people who wanted to remain within the Zambales province. This 1903 colonial decision has yet to be reverted. The reason for transferring those towns from Nueva Ecija &amp; Zambales to Pangasinan is because they were geographically further away from the capitals.

In 1902, the district of El Príncipe was separated from Nueva Ecija and transferred to the province of Tayabas (now Quezon). The northern area which is part of the modern Dilasag and area of modern Casiguran was part of Nueva Vizcaya and also transferred to Tayabas in 1905. In 1918, the area of modern Aurora north of Baler was transferred to the authority of Nueva Vizcaya, but returned to Tayabas in 1921 and in 1942, the entire present-day territory of Aurora was annexed from Tayabas to Nueva Ecija, and returned to Tayabas in 1945 until the time when Tayabas was renamed to &quot;Quezon&quot; in 1946.

=== World War II ===
Central Luzon featured prominently during World War II, becoming one of the earliest targets of Japanese attacks because of the presence of U.S. Military bases in the area, and also because General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s plans for responding to the invasion involved falling back to positions in Bataan in Central Luzon, as well as the island of Corregidor which is administered by Cavite province in Southern Luzon.

The hostilities of the war began with simultaneous attacks on Pearl Harbor and on Clark Field and also on a smaller fighter base at Iba, both in Central Luzon. The dates of those attacks are different, however, because they took place across different sides of the International Date Line.

Prior to the 1941 Japanese invasion, Bataan was a military reservation for the purpose of defending the fortress island of Corregidor. The US Army stored nearly of gasoline there, along with various munitions. At the southern tip of the peninsula the U.S. Navy had established a small base at the port of Mariveles.

Shortly after the Japanese Army invaded the country in December 1941, the combined US and Filipino forces were being gradually overrun and General Douglas MacArthur moved his troops to the Bataan Peninsula in an attempt to hold out until a relief force could be sent from the US. Japanese forces started a siege of the peninsula on January 7, 1942, and launched an all-out assault on April 3. The majority of the American and Filipino forces were compelled to surrender on April 9 and were forced to march more than from Bataan to Capas, Tarlac, which became known as the Bataan Death March.

After the surrenders of Bataan and Corregidor, many who escaped the Japanese reorganized in the mountains as guerrillas still loyal to the U.S. Army Forces Far East (USAFFE). This included the group of Ramon Magsaysay in Zambales, which grew to a 10,000-man force by the end of the war; the 22,000-man group of Russell W. Volckmann which called itself the United States Army Forces in the Philippines - Northern Luzon; and Robert Lapham who commanded the 14,191 man group called the Luzon Guerrilla Army Forces; among others.

In March 1942, the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP-1930, a predecessor of the current Communist Party of the Philippines) likewise led in the organization of a broad united front resistance to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines called &quot;Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan&quot;, (lit. &#x27;People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;). The organization operated successfully in underminng the Japanese until the end of the war, after which they found themselves alienated by the victorious U.S. led allied forces, most of whom had already developed the anticommunist sentiment which would mark the beginning of the Cold War. The PKP-1930 would thus resolve to reconstitute the organization as the armed wing of their revolutionary party.

The battle plan of the allied efforts to liberate the Philippines from the Japanese called for invasion forces landing to the north and south of Manila, which would converge on the capital, which was the primary objective. This would mean that the Northern force, which landed in the Lingayen Gulf, would cross the Central Luzon plains to get to Manila.

Clark Air Base had a notable role in the Battle of Luzon on 23 January 1944, in that it was the first major point of resistance where the Japanese fought back against allied forces who had landed in Agoo, Lingayen, and other towns in along the gulf, a province north. Learning that there were Prisoners of War at risk of being murdered at a POW Camp in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, 133 U.S. soldiers from the 6th Ranger Battalion and Alamo Scouts, and about 250–280 Filipino guerrillas were detached from the main spearhead to attempt to rescue the prisoners. The resulting attack on 30 January 1944 was highly successful, and is now popularly known as the &quot;Raid at Cabanatuan.&quot; Meanwhile, the Battle at Clark Air Base lasted until the end of January, after which the allies pushed on towards Manila.

=== Postwar era ===
After the social and economic upheavals of the war and with government institutions still in their nascent form after the recognition of Philippine Independence by the international community, the first few decades after the end of the war were marked by dissatisfaction and social tension. In the largely agricultural context of Central Luzon those tensions tended to coalesce around the interrelated issues of land ownership, and the working conditions of agricultural workers.

The Filipino communist Hukbalahap guerrilla movement formed by the farmers of Central Luzon to fight the Japanese occupation, had found themselves sidelined by the new post-independence Philippine government which had taken up the fear of communist influence which marked the beginning of the cold war in the west. So they decided to extended their fight into a rebellion against the new government, only to be put down through a series of reforms and military victories by Defense Secretary, and later President, Ramon Magsaysay.

Ultimately more effective than those who took up arms were the numerous political and labor movements who kept working towards agricultural land reform and stronger labor rights, with laborers&#x27; and farmers&#x27; protests gathering enough steam that several Philippine presidents were forced to meet with them and then concede to their demands. Among the most successful of these were the Land Justice March of the political group known as the Filipino Agrarian Reform Movement (FARM), which intended to march from Tarlac to Malacañang in 1969, although President Marcos was forced to give in to their demands early, meeting them while they were still at Camp Servillano Aquino in Tarlac City itself.

=== Marcos dictatorship era ===
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, particularly in Central Luzon. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of foreign debt-funded public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and a significant rise of social unrest. In central luzon, social tensions tended to coalesce around the presence of the two largest United States bases in the Philippines, the appropriation of lands for the creation of new industrial zones, and the interrelated issues of land ownership and the working conditions of agricultural workers.

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship.

Anyone who expressed opposition to Marcos was arrested, often without warrant, in an effort defense minister Juan Ponce Enrile would later admit was meant to &quot;emasculate all the leaders in order to control the situation,&quot; among them Senator and Concepcion native Ninoy Aquino, whose assassination years later would galvanize the effort to oust Marcos. Since they were not charged with crimes, they were called &quot;political detainees&quot; instead of &quot;prisoners.&quot; Camp Olivas in the City of San Fernando, Pampanga was designated as one of the four provincial camps to become a Regional Command for Detainees (RECAD) - designated &quot;RECAD II&quot; and housing detainees from Northern and Central Luzon. Other sites used as detention camps in central luzon included Camps Servillano Aquino and Camp Macabulos in Tarlac City. Detainees were subject to an extensive set of torture methods, while many others were never brought to the detention centers and were simply killed in unofficial &quot;safehouses.&quot; Others were killed in various massacres, with prominent instances in Central Luzon including incidents in Talugtug, Nueva Ecija on January 3, 1982; Pulilan, Bulacan on June 21, 1982; and Gapan, Nueva Ecija on February 12, 1982.

It was also during Martial Law that construction on the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant began in Morong, in 1976, in a deal between the government and Westinghouse Electric brokered by Marcos crony Herminio Disini. The project was plagued with problems throughout construction, including location, welding, cabling, pipes and valves, permits, and kickbacks, as well as setbacks such as the decline of Marcos&#x27;s influence due to bad health and PR fallout from the incident at the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor. A subsequent safety inquiry into the plant revealed over 4,000 defects. Another issues raisead regarding it was the proximity of a major geological fault line and of the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo. By March 1975, Westinghouse&#x27;s cost estimate ballooned so that the final cost was $2.2 Billion for a single reactor producing half the power of the original proposal. The power plant would eventually would be responsible to 10% of the country&#x27;s external debt, despite never actually operating.

=== Contemporary history ===

In 2002, Central Luzon had the highest unemployment rate among all regions in the country at 11.3%.

== Geography ==
The region is located north of Manila, the nation&#x27;s capital. Central Luzon, in addition to the neighboring province of Pangasinan, contains the largest plain in the Philippines with its agricultural plains accounting for about 40% of the geographical region&#x27;s area. Bordering it are the regions of Ilocos and Cagayan Valley to the north; National Capital Region, Calabarzon and the waters of Manila Bay to the south; South China Sea to the west; and the Philippine Sea to the east. Pangasinan is historico-culturally and geographically an integral part of this region, but was politically made part of the Ilocos Region by President Ferdinand Marcos on June 22, 1973.

There are fifteen cities in the region: Balanga in Bataan; Baliwag, Malolos, Meycauayan, and San Jose del Monte in Bulacan; Cabanatuan, Gapan, Muñoz, Palayan, and San Jose in Nueva Ecija; Angeles City, Mabalacat, and San Fernando in Pampanga; Tarlac City in Tarlac; and Olongapo in Zambales. Central Luzon produces the most rice in the whole country. Excess rice is delivered and imported to other regions of the Philippines.

The city of San Fernando, the provincial capital of Pampanga, is designated as the regional center. Aurora was transferred from Region IV through &quot;Executive Order No. 103&quot; in May 2002. Aurora was the sub-province created from the northern part of Quezon in 1951, named after Aurora Quezon. One obvious reason for creating the sub-province was the area&#x27;s isolation from the rest of Quezon Province: there were no direct links to the rest of the province and much of the terrain was mountainous and heavily forested, which made the area relatively isolated, and its distance from Quezon&#x27;s capital Lucena. On September 7, 1946, the Third Philippine Republic enacted &quot;Republic Act No. 14&quot;, which renamed the province of Tayabas to &quot;Quezon&quot;, in honor of Aurora&#x27;s husband &amp; cousin Manuel Quezon. Quezon was the second President of the Philippines and elected governor of Tayabas in 1906 and congressman of 1st district of Tayabas in 1907 and, along with Aurora, were natives of Baler (now capital of Aurora), formerly one of the towns of Quezon Province. The total separation of Aurora from Quezon &amp; transfer of Aurora to Central Luzon were the fulfillment of the wishes and prayers of the residents of the original Municipalities of Baler and Casiguran to be truly independent from Quezon Province for the first time and to reform the original La Pampanga since the Spanish occupation. The transfer of Aurora to Central Luzon opened the access of Central Luzon to Pacific Ocean. Many residents and government leaders of Aurora objected to the change, as Aurora maintains strong historical and cultural connections to the rest of Southern Tagalog, particularly Quezon Province, thus also of the memory of Manuel Quezon, and with that, Aurora residents self-identified with Quezon; but Aurora&#x27;s transfer to Central Luzon means that geographically, the province is more accessible by land from Nueva Ecija and of course, San Fernando, Pampanga.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provinces===
Central Luzon comprises 7 provinces, 2 &quot;highly urbanized&quot; cities, 12 &quot;component&quot; cities, 116 municipalities, 3,102 barangays

==Demographics==
===Languages===
The native languages of Central Luzon are:
*Bugkalot, spoken in parts of Nueva Ecija and Aurora.
* Kapampangan, spoken in the entirety of Pampanga and southern Tarlac, as well as southeastern Zambales, northeastern Bataan, western Bulacan, southwestern Nueva Ecija, and selected areas of Aurora.
*Casiguranin (Kasiguranin), spoken in parts of Aurora.
* Pangasinan, spoken in northern Tarlac, northeastern Zambales, northwestern Nueva Ecija, and selected areas of Aurora.
* Tagalog, spoken in Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Aurora, Bataan, and Zambales. The most popular Tagalog dialect is in Bulacan which is also heard in Nueva Ecija; the Tagalog dialect spoken in Aurora is basically similar to Tayabas Tagalog of Quezon, President Manuel L. Quezon who is considered the Father of National Language because he chose Tagalog as the basis of national language was born and raised in Baler, Aurora. It is the regional lingua franca, mostly as Filipino.
* Ilocano, spoken in northern Nueva Ecija, north Tarlac, north Aurora, southeast Bataan, and some parts of Zambales. It is the main lingua franca in the northern areas.
* Sambal, spoken in a majority of Zambales and a few scattered areas in Bataan and Pampanga.

The transfer of Aurora to Central Luzon added the population of Tagalog and Ilocano speakers along with Pangasinan and Kapampangan speakers in the region. Other native languages spoken in Central Luzon are Umiray Dumagat, Casiguran Dumagat, Palanan Dumagat, Northern Alta or Edimala in Aurora and Southern Alta or Alta Kabulowan in Bulacan and Dingalan, Aurora, and Tagabulós in Dingalan and San Luis, Aurora; other languages not native to Central Luzon but spoken by descendants of migrants there are Ga&#x27;dang, Kankanaey, and Isinay in Aurora, with the latter also spoken in Nueva Ecija.

Spain has proclaimed a number of Constitutions. The current Constitution of Spain of 1978 is the culmination of the Spanish transition to democracy.

The idea of a national constitution for Spain arose from the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen initiated as a result of the French Revolution. The earliest constitution was written and promulgated in 1808 when Napoleon invaded Spain, Bourbon monarchs Ferdinand VII and Charles IV abdicated, and Napoleon placed his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the throne. A constitution was drafted and the &quot;Junta Española&quot; Joseph I signed it. A major feature of the Constitution of 1808 was the provision for representation by Spanish America on an equal basis with the peninsula. Although signed by Spanish aristocrats and the new monarch, few in Spain recognized this document. 

With the eruption of the Peninsular War to oust the French invaders. A new Cortes was summoned and met at Cádiz, which included Spanish American and Philippine delegates, and promulgated the Spanish Constitution of 1812. This constitution is generally recognized as Spain&#x27;s first written constitution since it was drafted freely by delegates of the Spanish Empire.

During Francoist Spain, there were many attempts to create stable institutions that did not (at least directly) emanate from Francisco Franco as they did in the post-war period. The Fundamental Laws of the Realm (Spanish: &quot;Leyes Fundamentales del Reino&quot;) were a constitution in parts enacted through nearly 20 years starting in the 1950s. Most of those Laws theoretically provided for a quite free state, but ultimately the power of the Caudillo was supreme. They established the very institutions that would later, under Juan Carlos I and Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez, commit &quot;constitutional suicide&quot; and pass the Political Reform Act, starting the Spanish transition to democracy. 

Finally, the constitution in force is similar to the (unwritten) British democratic monarchy model, but the 2014 Catalan self-determination referendum has provoked calls for an entirely democratic federal republican model.

Below there is a comprehensive table, but this is an overview: 
* 1808–1814 Bayonne Constitution - Napoleonic restructuring from royal edict to the bicameral parliament
* 1812 Constitution of 1812 - The first attempt at decentralization

<doc id="299434" wikidata="Q201785" url="?curid=299434" title="El Dorado International Airport">
<text>El Dorado International Airport is an international airport serving Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, and its surrounding areas. The airport is located mostly in the Fontibón district of Bogotá, although it partially extends into the Engativá district and through the municipality of Funza in the Western Savanna Province of the Cundinamarca Department. It served 45,816,050 passengers in 2024 making it the busiest airport in Latin America in terms of passenger traffic, as well as being the 32nd busiest airport in the world in 2022. With 760,000 metric tons of cargo passing through the same year, it is also Iberoamerica&#x27;s most important cargo hub. El Dorado is also by far the busiest and most important airport in Colombia, accounting for just under half (49%) of the country&#x27;s air traffic. The facility covers and contains two long runways. El Dorado has non-stop international flights to North America, South America, Central America, the Caribbean, Europe, and the Middle East.

Strategically located between the Americas, it is the most well connected Airport in Latin America, and is the 20th most connected in the world as of 2024. Its location helps to facilitate both cargo and passengers connections between both continents and beyond. It is the most important hub for the Colombian flag-carrier Avianca and its subsidiaries Avianca Express and Avianca Cargo. It is also a base for LATAM Colombia, Satena, and a number of other airlines. It is owned by the Government of Colombia and operated by Operadora Aeroportuaria Internacional (OPAIN), a consortium composed of Colombian construction and engineering firms, and the Swiss company Flughafen Zürich AG, the company that operates Zurich Airport. 

El Dorado has consistently been ranked since 2016 by World Airport Awards and Skytrax as among the best airports in the world. It was ranked as the best airport in South America by World Airport Awards and the best airport in Latin America overall by Skytrax with a four-star certification by Skytrax in 2022. It was also ranked as having the best staff in South America, placed 35th in Skytrax&#x27;s World&#x27;s Top 100 Airports, and ranked the 2nd cleanest airport in Latin America by Skytrax in 2023.

==History==



The airport was designed and built during the government of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla as part of his campaign in modernize the country. Construction began in 1955 and entered in service by December 1959, replacing the aging Techo International Airport, which had been the city&#x27;s main airport since 1930. 

Before its inauguration, Soledad International Airport in Barranquilla was the nation&#x27;s air hub. It was relegated to secondary importance in the country when El Dorado Airport opened. 

The Sociedad de Mejoras y Ornato de Bogotá was in charge of the external decoration of the airport. On 29 September, after a meeting of the Board of Directors of project, the inauguration date was set for 10 December 1959. 

Before its completion on 28 October 1959, the airports&#x27;s manager, René Van Meerbeke, recommended that the airport&#x27;s name be placed in the central part of the building&#x27;s façade; however, the name was the subject of much reflection: a short, easy-to-pronounce, terrigenous name was sought that would recall the aboriginal culture that occupied the Bogotá Savannah. Thus, El Dorado was chosen as the most appropriate name for the new terminal. After much discussion among academics led by Professor Luis López de Mesa, Father Félix Restrepo and Alberto Miramón, the name of the airport was determined by decree, written without spaces, forming a single word. 

On 10 December 1959, the Eldorado International Air was inaugurated with a spectacular aeronautical exhibition beginning on 6 December which included 16 airplanes, 12 jet-propelled and four additional B-26s that caused the greatest impression on the public.

In the archives of the firm of architects and engineers Cuéllar, Serrano, Gómez y Cía., which participated in the construction of the airport, and of the Sociedad de Mejoras y Ornato, there is no record of the company that manufactured the Eldorado sign; neither is the weight of the eight letters known, since they did not need maintenance since they were installed.

The airport reached a milestone in 1973 with over three million passengers and nearly 5 million units of luggage processed. Plans began for a second runway at El Dorado with concerns that the explosive growth would lead to over congestion in the future. 

In 1990, the Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics (Aerocivil) moved to the airport. 

In 1998, the airport&#x27;s second runway was inaugurated, which has received much disagreement from the residents of the nearby area of Fontibón, due to the incessant air operations during the day and night.

In 2012, in accordance with Law 75 of 1989, which honors the memory of Luis Carlos Galán, Law 1529 of 2012 made official the name change from &quot;El Dorado International Airport&quot; to &quot;Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento El Dorado International Airport&quot;, including the space between &quot;El&quot; and &quot;Dorado&quot;, and the name of the politician from Bumán. This name change generated a strong controversy, especially because of the costs associated with it, and because of the non-existent relationship between Galán and the airport.

At the end of 2017, all the works corresponding to El Dorado International Airport and the new Terminal 1 were fully handed over. The Terminal 1 grew from 173,000 to 235,000 m² (square meters), with the potential to serve up to 43 million people per year.

=== Avianca hub ===
Avianca officially opened a hub in Bogotá in December 1998. The carrier flies to 52 destinations from Bogota as of August 2023.

It is now one of two hubs operated by the carrier, the other being Avianca El Salvador&#x27;s hub at El Salvador International Airport.

=== Puente Aéreo ===
In 1981, Avianca undertook the construction of the Puente Aéreo Terminal inaugurated by President Julio César Turbay Ayala.

The name Puente Aéreo means Air Bridge in English. Avianca&#x27;s original purpose for the terminal was for flights serving Cali, Medellín, Miami and New York. During the first years of operation and until 2005 Avianca gradually moved all of its domestic operations to the Puente Aéreo and moved the Miami and New York operations to the main terminal.

This allowed them to streamline their operations by using space previously assigned to customs and immigration for passenger gates and lounges. The culmination of this process came in 2006 when the airline undertook extensive renovations on the building. However, the airline was mindful of the impending and current renovations of El Dorado. One possible plan will be demolishing the Puente Aéreo Terminal, Main terminal and old cargo buildings which will be replaced with a new mega terminal. Many of the renovations made to the terminal in 2006 were obviously temporary and designed to be cheap but effective. For example, the walkways for the new gates are simply floor tiles placed over the old tarmac and the structure is made of aluminum with plastic sheets instead of glass windows. Passengers must cross the lanes used by buses, baggage carts and other vehicles in order to reach the aircraft. Once at the gate travellers must climb stairs to access the plane, the norm in the 1950s and 1960s but has for many years been surpassed by jetways.

In February 2008, Avianca opened a pioneer store called Avianca store which sells different products including: toy airplanes, hats, umbrellas, clothing, stuffed toys, pens, mugs and other such products, all embossed with the company logo. The store was an instant success and the airline expanded the concept to various other cities in Colombia.

On 28 April 2018, Avianca moved its entire domestic operation to Terminal 1 and local carriers Satena and EasyFly started operating from Puente Aéreo or Terminal 2

=== CATAM military airport ===
On 3 September 1932 it was launched the first Military Transport Service in Colombia, when a Junkers F-13 carried Colonel Luis Acevedo and his party to Leticia. Colonel Acevedo also served as Colombia&#x27;s General Director of aviation. Although the military air transport infrastructure was not formed yet, that mission was accomplished during the conflict with Peru in a rudimentary but effective way, with aircraft like the Junkers W 34, Ju 52 and BT-32 Condor.

In 1954 he created a &quot;Liaison Squadron&quot; operating under direct orders of the President of the Republic, at the time, Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. The Squadron was located in the Airport of Techo, the first airport of Bogotá. Its success led to the creation of a Military Airlift Group, which reached the category of Transportation Base in 1959. By then El Dorado International Airport was finished, so the Colombian Air Force ordered the transfer of the Unit to an area adjacent to the new Airport of El Dorado, using the civil airport facilities, while finishing the construction of a new base. The base was baptized as Comando Aéreo de Transporte Militar (Military Transportation Air Command) or CATAM. The base was inaugurated on 28 May 1963.

The base acquired the status of Operations and Logistics Support Center by FAC Directive No. 4429 of 8 July 1963, starting operations on 25 October. In 1968 the first two Hercules C-130B, with Colombian airplane military numbers FAC-1001 and FAC-1002, were delivered to this base. These aircraft, clearly designed for war missions and troop and materials transport, were able to use short and unpaved runways used in military operations through the country, fulfilling the needs of Colombian Air Force.

In 1977, the Military Transport Aviation Command was named after the Colombian aviation pioneer, Honorary Brigadier General Camilo Daza Alvarez. In order to expand its capacity for troop and cargo transportation in support of surface forces, in their fight against subversion and drug trafficking, the Air Force acquired new C-130 Hercules aircraft that been used for security purposes but also for humanitarian assistance. Between 1990 and 1991 the base received from the U.S. government six C-130B aircraft to support operations to combat drug trafficking and guerrillas.

In 1996 the base opened new ground accesses through an area devoted to the Military Transport Aviation Command. The narrow street that impeded the entrance and exit of vehicles was replaced by a dual carriageway and a tunnel that allows access to vehicular traffic passing below the airplane access ramp to runway number 2 of El Dorado International Airport. The parking lot was also enlarged to serve up to 260 vehicles. The base hosts the Colombian Air Force Museum, which has planes in display that represent the various types used in service during the 85 years history of the force.

In 2003 NVG equipment for night vision air operations was installed in Hercules C-130 and CN-235 Nurtanio airplanes. This increased the operational and support capacity of the base given to ground Army force, by allowing transportation, parachuting and aeromedical evacuation on combat runways lacking illumination. In this way Colombian Air Force almost doubled its operating capacity at this base, since it works 24 hours a day.

== Terminals and facilities==
The main passenger terminal is known as Terminal 1 (T1). The T1 building is shaped like a lowercase &quot;h&quot; and is divided into two piers or concourses: the international one to the north side and the domestic pier/concourse on the south side. Terminal 1 has four airline lounges (operated by LATAM, Avianca, and Copa), in addition to the El Dorado Lounge by Mastercard in the international concourse and one airline lounge (operated by Avianca) in the domestic concourse. It also offers a variety of food options, both on the air and land side, and several retail stores and cafés in the duty-free area. There are also car rental facilities, ticket counters, ATMs, telephones, restrooms, luggage storage space and even a small casino. The terminal has complimentary Wi-Fi service.

T1 has several check-in counter areas, check-in kiosks and expanded immigration lanes compared to the previous terminal. &quot;Express lanes&quot; were added for holders of biometric passports and Global Entry Membership. The new terminal has moving walkways, escalators and elevators to guarantee universal access and faster connections. The new terminal contains 32 gates: 10 for international flights and 22 for domestic flights, five of which are remote stands.

The &quot;Puente Aéreo&quot; is currently Terminal 2 (T2). It had previously been Avianca&#x27;s exclusive terminal for domestic flights. On 29 April 2018, the airline moved the remainder of its domestic operation from T2 to T1, which in turn meant the switch from T1 to T2 of EasyFly and Satena, who are currently the sole operators at the terminal. Terminal 2 contains a revamped food plaza, some retail stores, and ATMs.

The Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics (Aerocivil) is located in the new &quot;Aerocivil&quot; Building, located on the airport property. Previously it was located on the fourth floor of the main terminal building.

Due to the high demand for passengers, the need has become apparent to build a new, more modern airport with a larger capacity for both commercial and cargo flights. The process began with the creation of the new terminal. On 7 February 2007, the airport gave a concession to the consortium Opain. The national government accepted the proposal with Opain (airport operating company), to demolish the airport on 14 March 2008, after having given its concession. Initially the grant provided for the modernization of existing buildings and the construction of some additional buildings connected to the main terminal, but during the upgrading works (see below, Milestone 1), structural defects were discovered, which do not compromise the integrity of the building today. Opain from the beginning had proposed to demolish the aging terminal and had even submitted a new design to replace it, but the government had strongly opposed it due to pressing budget and legal issues (because it would be a big change to the terms of the concession, which could make Opain as well as other competitors who participated in the tender submitted claims), although many sectors of public opinion agreed with Opain. After the structural problems were discovered, the government agreed to the demolition of the airport and compensation for the renovations that Opain had already been hired to perform (Milestone 1). For the airport to handle 16 million passengers annually and 1.5 million tons of cargo, Opain plans to move the cargo terminal to allow the expansion of the passenger terminal and ensure access for at least an additional avenue to 26th Street.

On 19 September 2007, the implementation of Milestone 1 of the plan for modernization and expansion of the airport began. This consists of expanding the current Central Arrivals Hall of the terminal and installation of the CUTE system at the terminal. This was completed in March 2008. Additionally, the construction of the new cargo terminal, a new building for the office of civil aviation, a new fire station, an administrative center and quarantine were completed in September 2009.

The third milestone of the project began in late November 2009. Terminal 2 (Today&#x27;s T1), located on the north side of the old terminal, will handle all international passengers and its construction was set for 2012. The old building of Terminal 1 will handle only national passengers, except for Avianca&#x27;s which will continue being served on Terminal Puente Aereo. Soon after Terminal 2 began its operation, the old Terminal 1 building was to be demolished in order to build a new terminal for domestic passengers. 
On 17 October, the new Terminal 2 was inaugurated and on the 19th, every international operation was moved from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2. 
The new El Dorado International Airport, designed by Zyscovich Architects, was the largest infrastructure project in the city, when it was completed in July 2014. The new Terminal 2 was renamed to Terminal 1. Final work on the new Terminal 1 was completed in 2017.

== Future development proposals ==

In January 2015, a two-stage plan was proposed to improve Bogota&#x27;s aerial access, as part of a greater endeavor to modernize Colombia&#x27;s airports. The plan included a major expansion to the current main terminal with the effect of increasing the number of gates from 37 to 56 and thus raising the capacity of the airport from 27 million passengers to 40 million. Phase 1 also includes improvements to the runway to increase efficiency. The time scale for phase one was announced as approximately 24 months. Phase 2 involves the construction of a brand new secondary airport, currently called El Dorado II, in the suburb of Facatativa west of Bogota. The new airport was due to open in 2023. It was expected that El Dorado and El Dorado II will be connected via a commuter/light rail project.

In 2023, plans were announced to double the capacity of El Dorado Airport with capacity to reach 60 million passengers with a contract awarded by 2025.

<text>Daniel Dale Johnston (January 22, 1961 – September 11, 2019) was an American singer, musician and artist regarded as a significant figure in outsider, lo-fi, and alternative music scenes. Most of his work consisted of cassettes recorded alone in his home, and his music was frequently cited for its &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;childlike&quot; qualities.

Johnston spent extended periods in psychiatric institutions and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He garnered a local following in the 1980s by passing out tapes of his music while working at a McDonald&#x27;s in Dobie Center in Austin, Texas. His cult status was propelled when Nirvana&#x27;s Kurt Cobain was seen wearing a T-shirt that featured the artpiece &quot;Jeremiah the Innocent&quot; from Johnston&#x27;s 1983 cassette album &quot;Hi, How Are You&quot;.

Johnston also created visual art, and his illustrations were exhibited at galleries around the world. His struggles with mental illness were the subject of the 2005 documentary &quot;The Devil and Daniel Johnston&quot;. He died in 2019 of a suspected heart attack.

==Early life==
Johnston was born in Sacramento, California, and grew up in New Cumberland, West Virginia. He was the youngest of five children of William Dale &quot;Bill&quot; Johnston (1922–2017) and Mabel Ruth Voyles Johnston (1923–2010). He began recording music in the late 1970s on a $59 Sanyo monaural boombox, singing and playing piano as well as the chord organ.

Following graduation from Oak Glen High School, Johnston spent a few weeks at Abilene Christian University in West Texas before dropping out. He later attended the art program at Kent State University, East Liverpool, during which he recorded &quot;Songs of Pain&quot; and &quot;More Songs of Pain&quot;.

==Career==
===1980s–1990s===
In 1984, Johnston took a job at McDonald&#x27;s and passed out tapes in the store. When Johnston moved to Austin, Texas, he began to attract the attention of the local press and gained a following augmented in numbers by his habit of handing out tapes to people he met. Live performances were well-attended and hotly anticipated.

His local standing led to him being featured in a 1985 episode of the MTV program &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; featuring performers from Austin&#x27;s &quot;New Sincerity&quot; music scene.

In 1988, Johnston visited New York City and recorded &quot;1990&quot; with producer Mark Kramer at his Noise New York studio. It was Johnston&#x27;s first experience in a professional recording environment after a decade of releasing home-made cassette recordings. His mental health further deteriorated during the making of &quot;1990&quot;. In 1989, he released the album &quot;It&#x27;s Spooky&quot; in collaboration with singer Jad Fair of the band Half Japanese.

In 1990, Johnston played at a music festival in Austin, Texas. On the way back to West Virginia on a private two-seater plane piloted by his father Bill, Johnston had a manic psychotic episode; believing he was Casper the Friendly Ghost, Johnston removed the key from the plane&#x27;s ignition and threw it outside. His father, a former U.S. Air Force pilot, managed to successfully crash-land the plane, even though &quot;there was nothing down there but trees&quot;. Although the plane was destroyed, Johnston and his father emerged with only minor injuries. As a result of this episode, Johnston was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital.

Interest in Johnston increased when Kurt Cobain was frequently photographed wearing a T-shirt featuring the cover image of Johnston&#x27;s album &quot;Hi, How Are You&quot; that music journalist Everett True had given to him. Cobain listed &quot;Yip/Jump Music&quot; as one of his favorite albums in his journal, in 1993.

Johnston&#x27;s profile was further raised by Kathy McCarty&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Dead Dog&#x27;s Eyeball: Songs of Daniel Johnston&quot;. It contained 19 renditions of songs written by Johnston. McCarty became aware of Johnston when he opened for her former band, Glass Eye, in 1985. McCarty supported the album with a North American tour, and also issued an EP of additional Johnston material, &quot;Sorry Entertainer&quot; in 1995. 

Despite Johnston&#x27;s having been a resident in a mental hospital at the time, there was a bidding war to sign him. He refused to sign a multi-album deal with Elektra Records because Metallica was on the label&#x27;s roster and he was convinced that they were Satanic and would hurt him, also dropping his longtime manager, Jeff Tartakov, in the process. Ultimately he signed with new manager Tom Gimbel who subsequently negotiated a deal with Atlantic Records in February 1994 and that September released &quot;Fun&quot;, produced by Paul Leary of Butthole Surfers. President Danny Goldberg, who championed the signing of Johnston, left Atlantic. In June 1996, with Goldberg no longer making A&amp;R decisions, Atlantic dropped Johnston from the label.
In 1993, the Sound Exchange record store in Austin, Texas, commissioned Johnston to paint a mural of the &quot;Hi, How Are You?&quot; frog (also known as &quot;Jeremiah the Innocent&quot;) from the album&#x27;s cover. After the record store closed in 2003, the building remained unoccupied until 2004 when the Mexican grill franchise Baja Fresh took ownership and decided that they would remove the wall that held the mural. A group of people who lived in the neighborhood convinced the managers and contractors to keep the mural intact. In 2018, the building housed a Thai restaurant called &quot;Thai, How Are You&quot;. Thai, How Are You closed business permanently in January 2020. In April 2023 the building was razed, but the wall with the mural was left standing. The owner said that there were no current plans for development, but that the wall would be integrated into any future designs.

===2000s===
In 2004, Johnston released &quot;The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered&quot;, a two-disc compilation. The first disc featured covers of his songs by artists including Tom Waits, Beck, TV on the Radio, Jad Fair, Eels, Bright Eyes, Calvin Johnson, Death Cab for Cutie, Sparklehorse, Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips and Starlight Mints, with the second disc featuring Johnston&#x27;s original recordings of the songs. In 2005, Texas-based theater company Infernal Bridegroom Productions received a Multi-Arts Production/MAP Fund grant to work with Johnston to create a rock opera based on his music, titled &quot;Speeding Motorcycle&quot;.

In 2006, Jeff Feuerzeig released a documentary about Johnston, &quot;The Devil and Daniel Johnston&quot;; the film, four years in the making, collated some of the vast amount of recorded material Johnston (and in some case, others) had produced over the years to portray his life and music. The film won high praise, receiving the Director&#x27;s Award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. The film also inspired more interest in Johnston&#x27;s work, and increased his prestige as a touring artist. In 2006, Johnston&#x27;s label, Eternal Yip Eye Music, released his first greatest-hits compilation, &quot;Welcome to My World&quot;.

Through the next few years Johnston toured extensively across the world, and continued to attract press attention. His artwork was shown in galleries such as in London&#x27;s Aquarium Gallery, New York&#x27;s Clementine Gallery and at the Liverpool Biennial in 2006 and 2008, and in 2009, his work was exhibited at &quot;The Museum of Love&quot; at Verge Gallery in Sacramento, California. In 2008, Dick Johnston, Johnston&#x27;s brother and manager, revealed that &quot;a movie deal based on the artist&#x27;s life and music had been finalized with a tentative 2011 release.&quot; He also said that a deal had been struck with the Converse company for a &quot;signature series&quot; Daniel Johnston shoe. Later, it was revealed by Dick Johnston that Converse had dropped the plan. In early 2008, a Jeremiah the Innocent collectible figurine was released in limited runs of four different colors. Later in the year, Adjustable Productions released Johnston&#x27;s first concert DVD, &quot;The Angel and Daniel Johnston – Live at the Union Chapel&quot;, featuring a 2007 appearance in Islington, London.

&quot;Is and Always Was&quot; was released on October 6, 2009, on Eternal Yip Eye Music. In 2009, it was announced that Matt Groening had chosen Johnston to perform at the edition of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that he curated in May 2010, in Minehead, England. Also that year, Dr. Fun Fun and Smashing Studios developed an iPhone platform game called &quot;Hi, How Are You&quot;. The game is similar to &quot;Frogger&quot;, but features Johnston&#x27;s art and music. Johnston played it during its development and liked it, although he was not familiar with the iPhone.

===2010s===
On March 13, 2012, Johnston released his first comic book &quot;Space Ducks – An Infinite Comic Book of Musical Greatness&quot; at SXSW, published by BOOM! Studios. The comic book ties-in with the &quot;Space Ducks&quot; album and an iOS app. Johnston collaborated with skateboarding and clothing company Supreme on numerous collections (consisting of clothing and various accessories) showcasing his artwork.

On March 1, 2012, Brooklyn-based photographer Jung Kim announced her photo book and traveling exhibition project with Johnston titled &quot;DANIEL JOHNSTON: here&quot;, a collaboration that began in 2008 when Kim first met Johnston and began photographing him on the road and at his home in Waller, Texas. On March 13, 2013, this photography book was published, featuring five years of documentation on Johnston. The opening exhibition at SXSW festival featured a special performance by Johnston along with tribute performances led by Jason Sebastian Russo formerly of Mercury Rev. The second exhibition ran in May and June 2013 in London, England, and featured a special performance by Johnston along with tribute performances by the UK band Charlie Boyer and the Voyeurs with Steffan Halperin of the Klaxons. On October 10, 2013, Jason Pierce of Spiritualized hosted the New York City opening of the exhibition, which included special tribute performances led by Pierce and Glen Hansard of The Swell Season and The Frames.

In November 2015, &quot;Hi, How Are You Daniel Johnston?&quot;, a short documentary about Johnston&#x27;s life, was released featuring Johnston as his 2015 self and Gabriel Sunday of &quot;Archie&#x27;s Final Project&quot; as Johnston&#x27;s 1983 self. The executive producers for the film included Lana Del Rey and Mac Miller.

In July 2017, Johnston announced that he would be retiring from live performance and would embark on a final five-date tour that fall. Each stop on the tour featured Johnston backed by a group that had been influenced by his music: The Preservation All-Stars in New Orleans, The Districts and Modern Baseball in Philadelphia, Jeff Tweedy in Chicago, with Built to Spill for the final two dates in Vancouver, B.C. and Seattle, WA.

== Death ==
On September 11, 2019, Johnston was found dead from a suspected heart attack at his home in Waller, Texas. It is believed that he died overnight, a day after he had been released from the hospital for unspecified kidney problems.

Daniel Johnston is buried at Magnolia Cemetery in Katy, Texas.

<text>Brett Whiteley AO (7 April 1939 – 15 June 1992) was an Australian artist. He is represented in the collections of all the large Australian galleries, and was twice winner of the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman prizes. He held many exhibitions, and lived and painted in Australia as well as Italy, the United Kingdom, Fiji and the United States.

==Early years==
Growing up in , a suburb of Sydney, Whiteley was educated at The Scots School, Bathurst and The Scots College, Bellevue Hill. He started drawing at a very early age. While he was a teenager, he painted on weekends in the Central West of New South Wales and Canberra with such works as &quot;The soup kitchen&quot; (1958). Throughout 1956 to 1959 at the National Art School in East Sydney, Whiteley attended drawing classes. 

While still at school, Whiteley visited the Macquarie galleries and saw a one-man exhibition of the work of the landscape artist Lloyd Rees. Much later, in 1988, Whiteley wrote to Rees, who had been his friend and mentor for many years. He recalled landscapes that
As a result of this encounter with Rees&#x27;s work, Whiteley was able to meet Rees and join an evening sketch group organised by John Santry.

In 1959 he won an art scholarship sponsored by the Italian government and judged by Russell Drysdale. He left Australia for Europe on 23 January 1960.

==London==
After meeting Bryan Robertson, the director of the Whitechapel Gallery, Whiteley was included in the 1961 group show &#x27;Recent Australian Painting,&#x27; where his &quot;Untitled red painting&quot; was bought by the Tate Gallery. He was the youngest living artist to have work purchased by the Tate, a record that still stands. In 1962, Whiteley married Wendy Julius. Their only child, daughter Arkie Whiteley, was born in London in 1964. While in London, Whiteley painted works in several different series: bathing, the zoo and the Christies. His paintings during these years were influenced by the modernist British art of the sixties – particularly the works of William Scott and Roger Hilton – and were of brownish abstract forms. It was these abstract works which led to him being recognised as an artist, at a time when many other Australian artists were exhibiting in London, but from 1963 he moved away from abstraction towards figuration. His farewell to abstraction, &quot;Summer at Sigean&quot;, was a record of his honeymoon in France. He painted &quot;Woman in bath&quot; (1963) as part of a series of works he was doing of bathroom pictures. It has primarily black on one side and has an image of his wife Wendy in a bathtub, seen from behind. Another in the series was a more abstracted &quot;Woman in the bath II&quot;, which owed a debt to his yellow and red abstract paintings of the early sixties.

In 1964, while in London, Whiteley became fascinated by the murderer John Christie, who had committed murders in the area near where Whiteley was staying in Ladbroke Grove. He painted a series of paintings based on these events, including &quot;Head of Christie&quot;. Whiteley&#x27;s intention was to portray the violence of the events, but not to go too far in showing something which people would not want to see. During this time, Whiteley also painted works based on the animals at the London Zoo, such as &quot;Two Indonesian giraffes&quot;, which he found sometimes difficult. As he said: &quot;To draw animals, one has to work at white heat because they move so much, and partly because it is sometimes painful to feel what one guesses the animal &#x27;feels&#x27; from inside.&quot; (Whiteley 1979: 1) Whiteley also made images of the beach, such as his yellowish painting and collage work &quot;The beach II&quot;, which he painted on a brief visit to Australia before his return to London and his winning of a fellowship to America.
Whiteley appears as a character in the book &quot;Falling Towards England&quot; by Clive James under the name Dibbs Buckley. His wife Wendy appears as &quot;Delish&quot;.

==New York==
In 1967 Whiteley won a Harkness Fellowship Scholarship to study and work in New York. He met other artists and musicians while he lived at the Hotel Chelsea, where he befriended musicians Janis Joplin and Bob Dylan. His first impression of New York was shown in the painting &quot;First sensation of New York City&quot;, which showed streets with fast moving vehicles, street signs, hot dog vendors, and tall buildings. The Hotel Chelsea displayed several of Whiteley&#x27;s paintings from the time he lived there, including &quot;Portrait of New York&quot; which was hung behind the reception desk.

One way that America influenced him is in the scale of his works. He was very much influenced by the peace movement at the time and came to believe that if he painted one huge painting which would advocate peace, then the Americans would withdraw their troops from Vietnam. Whiteley became active in the great peace movements of the 1960s, with the protests against America&#x27;s involvement in the war in Vietnam. The resulting work was called &quot;The American dream&quot;, an enormous work that used painting and collage and anything else he could find on the 18 wooden panels. It took a great deal of his time and effort, taking about a year of full-time work. It started with a peaceful, dreamlike, serene ocean scene on one side, that worked its way to destruction and chaos in a mass of lighting, red colours and explosions on the other side. It was his comment on the direction the world might be headed and his response to a seemingly pointless war which could end in a nuclear holocaust. Many of the ideas from the work may have come from his experiences with alcohol, marijuana and other drugs. He believed that many of his ideas came from these experiences, and he often used drugs as a way of bringing the ideas from his subconscious. He sometimes took more than his body could handle, and had to be admitted to hospital for alcohol poisoning twice. Around him at the Hotel Chelsea, other artists and musicians took heroin, which Whiteley did not take at that time. The painting which was finally produced was made of a fantastic array of elements, including collage, photography and even flashing lights, with a total length of nearly 22 metres. However Marlborough-Gerson, his gallery, refused to show the work, and he was so distraught that he decided to leave New York, and he &#x27;fled&#x27; to Fiji.

==Appropriations==
One image which uses van Gogh&#x27;s style in a unique way is &quot;The night café&quot; (1971–72). He took the van Gogh painting and stretched the lines of the room to a single vanishing point, creating an image which appears fast moving and extremely vibrant and dynamic.

==&quot;Alchemy&quot;==
Part of his work &quot;Alchemy&quot; (1972–73) was featured on the cover of the Dire Straits live album &quot;&quot; although it had the addition of a guitar with lips held by a hand. Alchemy is the mythical ancient process of turning ordinary compounds into gold. The original painting, done between 1972 and 1973 was composed of many different elements and on 18 wood panels 203 cm × 1615 cm × 9 cm. Reading from left to right, it begins with an exploding sun from a portrait of Yukio Mishima that Whiteley had started but never completed. The famed author Mishima had committed seppuku in 1970 and the literary mythology that arose of his apparent final vision of enlightenment in the form of the exploding sun, as he pressed the knife into his body, inspired and became the basis for this work. In terms of media, it used everything from feathers and part of a bird&#x27;s nest to a glass eye, as well as shell pieces, plugs and brain in a work that becomes a transmutation of sexual organic landscapes and mindscapes. It has been regarded as a self-portrait, a giant outpouring of energy and ideas brought forth over a long period of time. According to art writer Bruce James, the self-conscious inclusion of the austere pronoun &#x27;IT&#x27; that also makes up part of the work compacts life, passion, death and faith in a single empowering word and unites the notional wings of an altarpiece to nascent addiction.

==Sydney Harbour and landscapes==

Whiteley loved painting Sydney Harbour views in the 1970s such as in his paintings, &quot;Henri&#x27;s Armchair&quot; (1974) &quot;The balcony 2&quot; (1975) and &quot;Interior with time past&quot; (1976), which show an interior and exterior view starting with a room that leads through open windows to the harbour full of boats outside. In the latter painting, the table in the front of the room close to the viewer has minutely decorated vases and small objects, while a drawing on the left and a sculpture to the extreme right show how Whiteley often used erotic images in his works. He painted a view of his friend Patrick White as a rock or a headland in &quot;Headland&quot;; White had told Whiteley that in the next life he would like to come back as a rock. Whiteley painted other images of the Australian landscape, including a view of the south coast of New South Wales after it had been raining called &quot;The South Coast after rain&quot;.

He did paintings of the areas around Bathurst, Oberon and Marulan, all in New South Wales. He soon settled in Lavender Bay. He painted abstracted images of bush scenes such as &quot;The bush&quot; (1966) and also images which resulted from experimentation with various drugs, such as alcohol in the humorous &quot;Self portrait after three bottles of wine&quot; (1971).

==Archibald and other prizes==
In the late 1970s, Brett Whiteley won the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman prizes several times. These are amongst the most prestigious art prizes in Australia. The competitions are run annually, with the award ceremonies being held at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

Whiteley&#x27;s awards were:
*1976
**Archibald Prize: &quot;Self portrait in the studio&quot;
**Sulman Prize: &quot;Interior with time past&quot;
*1977
**Wynne Prize: &quot;The Jacaranda tree (On Sydney Harbour)&quot;
*1978
**Archibald Prize: &quot;Art, Life and the other thing&quot;
**Sulman Prize: &quot;Yellow nude&quot;
**Wynne Prize: &quot;Summer at Carcoar&quot;

1978 was the only year in which all three prizes have been won simultaneously by the same person.

His first Archibald award, &quot;Self portrait in the studio&quot;, in deep bluish tones, shows an image of his studio at Lavender Bay overlooking Sydney Harbour, with his own reflection in a mirror shown at the bottom of the picture; a view of Sydney Harbour on the left establishes the location of the picture. Typically, the viewer is led deeper into the picture by means of minute detail. As with other works, there is evidence of Whiteley&#x27;s love for Matisse, ultramarine blue, the Sydney Harbour location and for collected objects.

His second Archibald prize, &quot;Art, Life and the other thing&quot;, shows his willingness to experiment with different media such as photography and collage. His reference to art history, including an image of the famous 1943 William Dobell portrait of Joshua Smith, won a court case against accusations that it was a caricature, not a portrait. The work experimented with warping and manipulating a straight self-portrait, incorporating his pictorial sense of addiction.

He won the Wynne Prize again, in 1984, with &quot;The South Coast after rain&quot;.

==TV documentary ==
He was the subject of an ABC television documentary called &quot;Difficult Pleasure&quot; directed by Don Featherstone in 1989, which showed him talking about many of his main works, and his recent works such as ones done during a month-long trip to Paris; one of his last overseas trips. He also showed his large T-shirt collection, and talks about his sculpture, which he said is an aspect of his work that many people do not take seriously. &quot;Difficult pleasure&quot; is how he described painting, or creating art stating, &quot;Painting is an argument between what it looks like and what it means.&quot;

==Final years==

Whiteley became increasingly dependent on alcohol and also became addicted to heroin. His work was not always being praised by critics, although its market value continued to climb. He made several attempts to dry out and get off drugs completely, all ultimately unsuccessful. In 1989, he and Wendy, whom he had always credited as his &#x27;muse&#x27;, divorced. He began a relationship with Janice Spencer, with whom he travelled to Japan, among other countries. He also spent time with friends including Mark Knopfler and John Illsley from the band Dire Straits.

In June 1991, Whiteley was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia.

On 15 June 1992, aged 53, he was found dead from opiate overdose in a motel room in Thirroul, north of Wollongong. The coroner&#x27;s verdict was &#x27;death due to self-administered substances&#x27;.

In 1999, Whiteley&#x27;s painting &quot;The Jacaranda tree&quot; (1977), which had won the Wynne Prize, sold for , a record for a modern Australian painter at that time. Before this, his previous highest-selling work was &quot;The pond at Bundanon&quot; for A$. In 2007 his painting &quot;The Olgas for Ernest Giles&quot; was sold by Menzies for an Australian record of A$3.5 million. On 7 May 2007, &quot;Opera House&quot;, (which took Whiteley a decade to paint, and which he exchanged with Qantas for a period of free air travel) sold for A$2.8 million, in Sydney.

==Legacy==
Whiteley&#x27;s home and workplace during the last four years of his life at 2 Raper Street in Surry Hills was converted into the Brett Whiteley Studio museum by the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

In 1999, Brett&#x27;s mother Beryl Whiteley (1917–2010) founded the Brett Whiteley Travelling Art Scholarship in memory of her son.

== Biography ==
Sandra McGrath&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;Brett Whiteley,&quot; dubbed The Blue Book&#x27; for its dust jacket featuring the painter&#x27;s &quot;The Jacaranda Tree&quot;, was the first major text on the artist.

A 1992 updated edition of the Whiteley book, with an interview with the artist that McGrath recorded in 1990 and Whiteley&#x27;s own thoughts on his art, then being released as a paperback two months after his death, was the subject of a 24 September hearing in the Federal court to examine whether allegedly offensive material infringed copyright as claimed by solicitors for stakeholders in the artist&#x27;s estate. They also asserted that Whiteley&#x27;s assent for colour reproduction of his works in the first, hardback edition would not cover the monochrome reprints in the new paperback. The publicity attracted attention, though the publisher&#x27;s agent Tom Thompson challenged journalist Andrew Main to &#x27;let us know&#x27; if he found any &#x27;offensive&#x27; passages. Ensnared in the controversy and after the court in October 1992 ordered the withdrawal of the paperbacks, Thompson resigned under pressure from Angus &amp; Robertson. Crime writer Susan Geason in 1996 considered that:Sandra McGrath&#x27;s book – &quot;Brett Whiteley&quot; – is as good as you&#x27;ll get on the paintings, I suspect, and it&#x27;s a complete mystery why the Whiteley women had the revised edition pulped. Apart from a paragraph or so about the existence of The Mistress, it&#x27;s totally harmless. Hell hath no fury...McGrath started to write another, more extensive Whiteley book with interviews of his friends and associates including Bob Dylan before HarperCollins, an imprint of Angus &amp; Robertson, withdrew their interest, while others including Graeme Blundell, Blanche d&#x27;Alpuget, Frannie Hopkirk, Barry Pierce, and Janice Spencer drafted or published further biographies.

In July 2016, Text Publishing published Whiteley&#x27;s biography, titled &quot;Brett Whiteley: Art, Life and the Other Thing&quot;. The author, Ashleigh Wilson, was the arts editor of &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper. It was written with unprecedented behind-the-scenes access, and illustrated with classic Brett Whiteley artworks, rare notebook sketches and candid family photographs. The book was longlisted for a Walkley Book Award and Australian Book Industry Award, and shortlisted for the Australian Book Design Awards and the Mark and Evette Moran Nib Literary Award. An audio version released by Audible in 2016 was narrated by Mark Seymour. The paperback, featuring a new cover, was released in 2017. On 23 November 2017 the book was named the people&#x27;s choice winner at the Mark and Evette Moran NIB Literary Award.
== Opera==
In August 2018, Opera Australia announced that it had commissioned an opera to be based on the life of Brett Whiteley. The music will be written by Elena Kats-Chernin, with a libretto by Justin Fleming. David Freeman will direct and Tahu Matheson will conduct. Ashleigh Wilson, author of Whiteley&#x27;s biography, is a consultant on the work. It premiered at the Sydney Opera House on 15 July 2019.

== Film==
In 2017, a feature-length biographical documentary about Whiteley was released in Australian cinemas. Directed by James Bogle and produced by Sue Clothier, &quot;Whiteley&quot; includes extensive archival footage and photos, personal notes and letters, as well as animations and dramatic reconstructions, although no new interviews were shot for the film. This approach was intended to allow Whiteley to speak &quot;in his own words&quot; about his life and art. The documentary was made with the approval of Wendy Whiteley, and was received with critical acclaim.

<text>USS &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; (SSN-23) is the third and final nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine in the United States Navy. Commissioned in 2005, she is named for the 39th president of the United States, Jimmy Carter, the only president to have qualified on submarines. The only submarine to have been named for a living president, &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; is also one of the few vessels, and only the third submarine of the US Navy, to have been named for a living person. Extensively modified from the original design of her class, she is sometimes described as a subclass unto herself.

==History==
===Construction===
The contract to build &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; was to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 29 June 1996, and her keel was laid on 5 December 1998. Original schedules called for &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; to be commissioned in late 2001 or early 2002. Electric Boat was awarded an $887 million extension to the &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; contract on 10 December 1999 to modify the boat for testing new submarine systems and classified missions previously carried out by . During modification, her hull was extended to create a 2,500-ton supplementary middle section which forms a Multi-Mission Platform (MMP). This section is fitted with an ocean interface for divers, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and special operation equipment; ROV handling system, storage, and deployment space for mission systems, and a pressure-resistant passage between the fore and aft parts of the submarine to accommodate the boat&#x27;s crew.

&quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; was christened on 5 June 2004, and the ship sponsor was former First Lady Rosalynn Carter. One result of the changes was that &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; was commissioned more than six years after and almost four months after the commissioning of , the first of the subs.

&quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; has additional maneuvering devices fitted fore and aft that allow her to keep station over selected targets in odd currents. Intelligence experts speculate that the MMP may find use in missions as an underwater splicing chamber for optical fiber cables.

===Deployments===
On 19 November 2004 &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; completed alpha sea trials, her first voyage in the open seas. On 22 December, Electric Boat delivered &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; to the US Navy, and she was commissioned 19 February 2005 at NSB New London.

&quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; began a transit from NSB New London to her new homeport at the Bangor Annex of Naval Base Kitsap, Washington on 14 October 2005 but was forced to return when an unusually high wave caused damage while the submarine was running on the surface. The damage was repaired and &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; left New London the following day, arriving at Bangor the afternoon of 9 November 2005.

In April and September 2017 &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; returned twice to her homeport at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, flying a Jolly Roger flag, traditionally indicative of a successful mission.

==Awards==
*2007 Battle Efficiency Award, commonly known as a &quot;Battle E&quot;.
*2012 Battle Efficiency Award.
*2013 Presidential Unit Citation, the equivalent to the Navy Cross for the entire ship, for what has been reported as &quot;Mission 7.&quot;

<doc id="299443" wikidata="Q62874" url="?curid=299443" title="John Hopcroft">
<text>John Edward Hopcroft (born October 7, 1939) is an American theoretical computer scientist. His textbooks on theory of computation (also known as the Cinderella book) and data structures are regarded as standards in their fields. He is a professor emeritus at Cornell University, co-director of the Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies at Peking University, and the director of the John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

==Early life and education==
Hopcroft received a Bachelor of Science with a major in electrical engineering from Seattle University in 1961. He received a Master of Science in electrical engineering in 1962 and a Doctor of Philosophy in electrical engineering in 1964, both from Stanford University.

Hopcroft is the grandson of Jacob Nist, who established the Seattle-Tacoma Box Company in 1889.

==Career and honor==
He worked for three years at Princeton University and since then has been at Cornell University. 

In addition to his research work, he is well known for his books on algorithms and formal languages coauthored with Jeffrey Ullman and Alfred Aho, regarded as classic texts in the field.

In 1986 he received the Turing Award (jointly with Robert Tarjan) &quot;for fundamental achievements in the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures.&quot; Along with his work with Tarjan on planar graphs he is also known for the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding matchings in bipartite graphs. In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2005 he received the Harry H. Goode Memorial Award &quot;for fundamental contributions to the study of algorithms and their applications in information processing.&quot;

In 2008 he received the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award &quot;for his vision of and impact on computer science, including co-authoring field-defining texts on theory and algorithms, which continue to influence students 40 years later, advising PhD students who themselves are now contributing greatly to computer science, and providing influential leadership in computer science research and education at the national and international level.&quot;

Hopcroft was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1989 for fundamental contributions to computer algorithms and for authorship of outstanding computer science textbooks.

In 1992, Hopcroft was nominated to the National Science Board by George H. W. Bush.

In 2005, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia. In 2009, he received an honorary doctorate from Saint Petersburg State University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics. In 2017, Shanghai Jiao Tong University launched a John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science. In 2020, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen opened a Hopcroft Institute for Advanced Information Sciences and designated him as an Einstein professor.

Hopcroft is also the co-recipient (with Jeffrey Ullman) of the 2010 IEEE John von Neumann Medal for &quot;laying the foundations for the fields of automata and language theory and many seminal contributions to theoretical computer science.&quot;

<doc id="299461" wikidata="Q849875" url="?curid=299461" title="Neutral Milk Hotel">
<text>Neutral Milk Hotel was an American band formed by Jeff Mangum in Ruston, Louisiana, in 1989. They were active until 1998, and then from 2013 to 2015. The band&#x27;s music featured a deliberately low-quality sound, influenced by indie rock and psychedelic folk. Mangum wrote surreal and opaque lyrics that covered a wide range of topics, including love, spirituality, nostalgia, sex, and loneliness. He and the other band members played a variety of instruments, including non-traditional instruments like the singing saw and uilleann pipes.

Neutral Milk Hotel began as one of Mangum&#x27;s home recording projects. After graduating high school, Mangum lived as a vagabond and sporadically released music. In 1996, he worked with childhood friend Robert Schneider to record the album &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, which received modest reviews and sold around 5,000 copies. Mangum recruited musicians Julian Koster, Jeremy Barnes, and Scott Spillane for the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;. Its 1998 release received mostly positive, but not laudatory reviews.

While on tour, the band&#x27;s popularity grew through Internet exposure. This negatively affected Mangum, whose mental health began to deteriorate; he did not want to continue touring and Neutral Milk Hotel went on hiatus shortly after. During their hiatus, Neutral Milk Hotel gained a cult following and the critical standing of &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; rose tremendously. Several music outlets such as &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and &quot;Blender&quot; called &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; a landmark album for indie rock and one of the greatest albums of the 1990s. Many indie rock groups such as Arcade Fire and the Decemberists were influenced by Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s eclectic music and earnest lyrics. Neutral Milk Hotel reunited in 2013 and undertook a reunion tour before another hiatus in 2015.

==History==
===Early years===
Neutral Milk Hotel originated in Ruston, Louisiana, in the late 1980s as a home recording project of musician Jeff Mangum. Initially called Milk, Mangum made the recordings while in high school. Early Milk recordings, such as &quot;Invent Yourself a Shortcake&quot; and &quot;Beauty&quot;, were shared between Mangum and his friends Robert Schneider, Bill Doss, and Will Cullen Hart. The four friends branded these homemade cassette tapes with an imaginary record label, Elephant 6, which eventually grew into a loose musical collective. When Mangum learned of another band called Milk, he changed the name of the project to Neutral Milk Hotel, based on a name Hart suggested.

After graduating from high school, Mangum attended Louisiana Tech University, but dropped out. He moved to Athens, Georgia, and played in a band called Synthetic Flying Machine with Doss and Hart, but left shortly after the band was formed. He then became a vagabond, and lived in cities such as Denver, Los Angeles, and Seattle. Mangum occasionally recorded music during this period, including a 1993 demo album titled &quot;Hype City Soundtrack&quot;. Schneider says &quot;Hype City Soundtrack&quot; was a reaction to what Mangum believed was the rampant commercialization of music within large cities. While living in Seattle, Mangum overcame his apprehensiveness about the music industry and released the song &quot;Everything Is&quot; on Cher Doll Records. The song&#x27;s exposure convinced Mangum to record more music under the name Neutral Milk Hotel. According to Mangum: &quot;The single was a godsend because I was pretty much at the end of my rope with just about everything in my life at that point... I ended up sending a tape to [Nancy Ostrander] at Cher Doll Records and she saved me merely by saying she wanted to do a single.&quot;

At the time, Mangum was also a bass guitarist for the Apples in Stereo, a band that Schneider formed while living in Denver. The members of the Apples in Stereo wanted to sign with SpinART Records, and met with their legal representative, Brian McPherson, in Los Angeles. McPherson was drawn to Mangum, who was wearing a Shrimper Records T-shirt. After learning that Mangum wrote &quot;Everything Is&quot;, a song that McPherson had previously listened to and enjoyed, the two worked out an agreement for McPherson to become Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s representative. McPherson sent copies of &quot;Everything Is&quot; and another song &quot;Ruby Bulbs&quot; to Merge Records founders Laura Ballance and Mac McCaughan. The two liked the music, and added Neutral Milk Hotel to their roster.

===&quot;On Avery Island&quot; and expansion to a quartet===

Mangum moved to Denver to record the first Neutral Milk Hotel album, &quot;On Avery Island&quot;. Schneider served as the producer, and the recording sessions lasted from February to May 1995. Although Schneider was interested in an expansive Beatlesque production, he aligned with Mangum&#x27;s preference for a lo-fi sound, admitting that &quot;at first it was frustrating, but I came to enjoy it. That&#x27;s how I learned to produce, doing that record, because I totally had to let go of what I thought it should be like.&quot; &quot;On Avery Island&quot; was released in the United States on March 26, 1996, by Merge Records, and in the United Kingdom on September 30, 1996, by Fire Records. It sold around 5,000 copies, which Merge considered a success. &quot;On Avery Island&quot; received positive reviews from critics, who characterized the music as lo-fi pop. Kurt Wolff of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; described listening to the music as &quot;a trippy experience,&quot; and ultimately called the album &quot;a fresh, exciting standout&quot;. The British publication &quot;NME&quot; wrote: &quot;Neutral Milk Hotel can convert miserable-as-sin introspection into folky mantras that bore into your skull like a well-aimed power drill.&quot; &quot;On Avery Island&quot; was ranked at number thirty-five on &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop poll for 1996.

After the release of &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, Mangum sought other musicians to tour with. While living in Ruston, Mangum befriended New York musician Julian Koster. They exchanged demo tapes, and Koster joined Neutral Milk Hotel as the bassist. Around this period, Koster received a letter from Chicago drummer Jeremy Barnes, who wrote how he was not meeting the expectations he had set for himself. According to Koster: &quot;Jeremy had written me this really wonderful letter, basically saying he was being led into a far different life than I think Jeremy Barnes was supposed to live ... I think he was sensing that his destiny lay elsewhere.&quot; The letter resonated with Koster and Mangum, and they traveled to Chicago to meet him. After a short audition, the two persuaded Barnes to drop out of DePaul University and join the band. The final band member came when Mangum was traveling to New York City to live with Koster. On a stop in Austin, Texas, Mangum met former Rustonian musician Scott Spillane, who was working at a pizza shop. Mangum helped make pizzas during the late-night &quot;drunk rush&quot;, after which he convinced Spillane to join the band.

The band members moved to New York City, and lived and rehearsed in a house owned by Koster&#x27;s grandmother. Koster encouraged the band members to play instruments outside their comfort zones. For example, drummer Barnes learned to play the accordion, and Spillane learned how to play the horn parts from &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, practicing on a two-valve horn for hours every day. On April 28, 1997, Neutral Milk Hotel began a national tour, during which the band members learned to play as a unit. The &quot;On Avery Island&quot; tour generated enough money for the band members to afford to move to Athens, where a large group of Elephant 6 musicians were living. By the spring of 1997, Mangum had written and demoed nearly every song for a second album. He shared the demos with his bandmates before they moved to Denver to record the album.

===&quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;===
Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s second album, &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;, was produced by Schneider, and was recorded from July to September 1997. Schneider used new recording techniques to capture Mangum&#x27;s lo-fi preferences. Mangum liked having a layer of distortion over the music, but Schneider did not use standard effects equipment such as Big Muffs or distortion pedals. Instead, Schneider used heavy compression and placed a Bellari RP-220 tube mic pre-amp close to Mangum&#x27;s guitar. Schneider then ran the sound through a mixing console, and maxed out the sound on a cassette tape. This process was done for nearly every instrument used on &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;. Schneider claimed that the nonlinearities of microphone distortion gave the album its unique &quot;warm&quot; quality.

&quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; was released on February 10, 1998. Merge pressed 5,500 CD and 1,600 vinyl copies, and expected sales to be similar to &quot;On Avery Island&quot;. These initial projections were correct, as the album sold moderately well for the first few months. Critical responses to &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; were mostly positive, but not laudatory. Rob Brunner of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the unique instrumentation and &quot;bouncy pop melodies&quot;, but described some of the songs as &quot;lifeless acoustic warblers.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; M. Christian McDermott also commended the music, which he called a blend of &quot;&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; with early 90s lo-fi&quot; that he found &quot;as catchy as it is frightening.&quot; A more negative review came from Ben Ratliff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who felt the heavy layer of distortion masked the absence of decent melodies. &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; ranked &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; as the number one album of 1998, and it placed fifteenth in the Pazz &amp; Jop poll for 1998.

To promote the album, Neutral Milk Hotel embarked on a tour of North America and Europe. Musicians John Fernandes and Will Westbrook were brought on as touring members, and were taught how to play the horn parts with Spillane. While on tour, Neutral Milk Hotel gained a reputation for chaotic and physically demanding concerts. Great Lakes member Ben Crum recalled: &quot;It was definitely dangerous. There often seemed to be a very real chance that someone, probably Julian, would get hurt. Jeff was always doing things like picking him up and throwing him into the drums.&quot; The band members often could not afford lodgings, and sometimes asked people in the audience if they could spend the night at their house, not realizing the homeowner was in fact terrified of them.

===Hiatus and cult following===
Some journalists have noted the release of &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; coincided with the rise of the Internet. The album, and by extension Neutral Milk Hotel, became common fixtures on online message boards, and early music websites like &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the band an increased level of promotion. Their newfound high-profile had a negative effect on Mangum, and his mental health began to deteriorate. He constantly told his bandmates he wanted to quit, but never explained why. Some journalists have speculated he became tired of touring and constantly explaining his lyrics to fans; Elephant 6 biographer Adam Clair believes he may have been overwhelmed by the way fans viewed his music, and the high expectations placed upon any subsequent recordings. Regardless of the reason, Mangum came to the conclusion that he could not continue performing, and instead wanted to disappear from the public eye. Instead of telling the other band members of his decision, he simply avoided the topic of new music altogether. This led to the unofficial breakup of Neutral Milk Hotel shortly after the tour. The final Neutral Milk Hotel live performance occurred on October 13, 1998, in London.

During the hiatus, Mangum occasionally worked on some projects, but nothing was widely publicized. When asked about a third Neutral Milk Hotel album in a 2002 interview, Mangum said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know. It would be nice, but sometimes I kind of doubt it.&quot; Although Neutral Milk Hotel did not officially break up, the other band members worked on music with other Elephant 6 bands such as Bablicon, the Gerbils, A Hawk and a Hacksaw, and the Music Tapes. Koster notes how he and the other band members initially thought the hiatus would be a short break to focus on their other musical projects. Koster recounted: &quot;The fact that Neutral Milk wasn&#x27;t doing something just felt natural, because so much else was happening, and we had just done so much. It didn’t feel unusual at all. I suspected nothing.&quot;

Fans of Neutral Milk Hotel were not told why the band went on hiatus. Some were angry, and accused Mangum of being selfish, and others wrote hoax blog posts giving fake details of upcoming tours and other false information. The speculation and online discussions raised the profile of the band, to the point that Neutral Milk Hotel and, in particular, &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; gained a cult following and converted Mangum into a larger-than-life figure. In 2003, &quot;Creative Loafing&quot; writer Kevin Griffis dedicated an entire cover story to trying to track down Mangum for personal closure. The search ended when Mangum sent him an email that read: &quot;I&#x27;m not an idea. I am a person, who obviously wants to be left alone.&quot; Journalist Mark Richardson attempted to explain &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; rise in popularity: &quot;Because [Mangum] was inaccessible, there was no outlet for connection other than the record itself and other fans who shared a passion. By doing nothing, Neutral Milk Hotel developed a cult.&quot;

&quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; critical standing rose tremendously in the years after its release, which journalist Luke Winkie attributes to the cult following. Domino Recording Company released a reissue in 2005, which was awarded a perfect 10/10 score by Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. Richardson wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a record of images, associations, and threads; no single word describes it so well as the beautiful and overused kaleidoscope.&quot; Other music outlets such as AllMusic and the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; also gave the album perfect scores. &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; sales figures increased during the 2000s, with an estimated 140,000 copies sold by 2005. &quot;Polygon&quot; writer Garrett Martin noted how fans of the album were &quot;incredibly passionate&quot;, recording covers for YouTube, writing poetry, and forming tribute bands. Martin said: &quot;The fanbase might be relatively small, but it&#x27;s fervent.&quot;

===Reunion and second hiatus===

Mangum resurfaced in 2008 with a few solo shows before embarking on full solo tours in 2011 and 2012. During this time, Mangum curated a box set of Neutral Milk Hotel material, which included an extended play of unreleased songs titled &quot;Ferris Wheel on Fire&quot;. As Mangum was active again within the music industry, rumors began spreading among fans and music outlets of a potential Neutral Milk Hotel reunion.

On April 29, 2013, Neutral Milk Hotel officially announced a reunion tour with all four members of the band. In an interview with &quot;Orlando Weekly&quot;, Schneider said: &quot;[The hiatus] certainly wasn&#x27;t purposeful, and I&#x27;m not sure [Mangum] even realized he was being a recluse until it was overwhelmingly the case that everyone was talking about it. I&#x27;ve known for seven years that he was going to start touring. I didn&#x27;t know if he was going to actually start doing it, but I knew in my heart that he was working toward it.&quot; Neutral Milk Hotel toured from 2013 to 2015. In a 2014 post on the Neutral Milk Hotel website, the band members wrote how their 2015 tour would be their last tour for the &quot;foreseeable future&quot;, and that they were going to take an extended hiatus. The post stated: &quot;Dear friends we love you but it&#x27;s time to say goodbye for the never ending now.&quot;

In 2023, Neutral Milk Hotel released another box set, titled &quot;The Collected Works of Neutral Milk Hotel&quot;. The box set includes every recording by the band, including &quot;Live at Jittery Joe&#x27;s&quot;, a live album Mangum released independently in 2001. &quot;The Collected Works of Neutral Milk Hotel&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Artistry==

===Music===
Neutral Milk Hotel is known for its experimental sound, which has been described as a mixture of indie rock and psychedelic folk, with lo-fi production. Critics have noted many other musical influences, including Eastern European choral music, Canterbury Sound, circus music, marching band music, musique concrète, drone music, free jazz, and Tropicália. Neutral Milk Hotel songs typically involved simple chord progressions that Mangum would strum on an acoustic guitar. Often as the song progressed, more instruments would be introduced. The band members played a wide range of instruments; on &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; for example, conventional instruments like drums and distorted guitars were paired with unique instruments like the singing saw and uilleann pipes.

Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s early recordings, before &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, featured much distortion and are considered rough. Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; believes Mangum&#x27;s songwriting was undeveloped, and described the 1994 song &quot;Ruby Bulbs&quot; as &quot;raw and noisy and shouty and reflects Mangum&#x27;s interest in aggro punk, an influence that didn&#x27;t otherwise surface on his records.&quot; &quot;On Avery Island&quot; represented a move toward greater musical cohesion, and more experimentation. Critic Sasha Geffen said: &quot;The album veers wildly between the accessible and the inscrutable... the abrupt transitions between perfect pop melodies and gaseous balls of noise lend the album a certain wildfire charm.&quot; The most experimental song on the album is the final track &quot;Pree-Sisters Swallowing a Donkey&#x27;s Eye,&quot; a thirteen-minute drone track influenced by gamelan and noise music.

Many critics believe &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; is Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s best and most fully developed release. By this point, Neutral Milk Hotel had four members as opposed to just Mangum, which allowed for a more complex and organic sound. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic notes &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; emphasizes structure and texture, and that tracks seamlessly segue into one another. The overall sound of the album sometimes abruptly shifts from track to track. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; notes the range of musical styles present on the album, such as funeral marches and punk rock. Critic Chris DeVille offers similar commentary, writing: &quot;On the musical axis, Neutral Milk Hotel veered from piercingly intimate psychedelic campfire sing-alongs to full-band segments that barreled ahead with haphazard grace.&quot;

===Lyrics===
Mangum served as the lyricist for Neutral Milk Hotel. Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Mangum&#x27;s lyrics as surreal and opaque, and notes that they feature a stream of consciousness style of songwriting. The lyrics would often include references to seemingly unrelated subject matter. Biographer Kim Cooper cites the song &quot;King of Carrot Flowers, Pt.1&quot; as an example of this style of songwriting; although the lyrics are about childhood fantasies, there are references to sexual awakenings, domestic violence, religious fanaticism, and tarot card readings. DeRogatis likened Mangum&#x27;s lyricism to &quot;Dr. Seuss illustrating William S. Burroughs, or perhaps Sigmund Freud collaborating on lyrics with Syd Barrett.&quot;

According to Mangum, many of his lyrics stem from his subconscious, saying: &quot;Some of it I don&#x27;t understand, I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it sounds real nice.&quot; Another source of inspiration were the visions, lucid dreams, and night terrors Mangum would have. Mangum would sometimes have full conversations between himself and Schneider while sleepwalking. After coming up with an idea for a song, Mangum would start writing &quot;word bridges,&quot; which are small connecting ideas that would bridge the seemingly unrelated lyrics. Mangum cites the song &quot;Two-Headed Boy&quot; as an example, as each verse was written separately from each other over a long period of time, and he used the &quot;word bridges&quot; to connect the verses.

Neutral Milk Hotel songs explore many lyrical themes, including love, spirituality, nostalgia, sex, and loneliness. DeRogatis describes Mangum&#x27;s lyrics as a depiction of id, a personality component related to intrinsic desires. Mangum&#x27;s lyrics can also be seen as a reaction to events that have happened in his life. For example, &quot;Song Against Sex&quot; was written as a reaction to the use of sex as a source of power in a relationship. A central lyrical topic in &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; is the life of Anne Frank, a teenage girl who died in a Nazi concentration camp. Tracks such as &quot;Holland, 1945&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot; incorporate elements of Frank&#x27;s life into the lyrics. As a result, some listeners have described &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; as a concept album. Anwen Crawford of &quot;The Monthly&quot; disagrees with this assertion, writing: &quot;It would be overly literal, though, to describe &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; as an album about the Holocaust, for Frank is only one of many phantasms to populate a set of looping, interlinked narratives that proceed with the closed logic of a dream or a religious vision.&quot;

===Live performances===

Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s live performances often featured the four main band members and several other musicians. For example, the reunion tour featured backing musicians Laura Carter, Jeremy Thal, and Mangum&#x27;s wife Astra Taylor. Almost every musician on stage would play multiple instruments, and switch instruments between songs. Neutral Milk Hotel shows typically lasted between forty-five and ninety minutes. The equipment used onstage was cheap and of poor quality, although for the reunion tour more expensive equipment was used.

Early Neutral Milk Hotel shows were chaotic and disorganized. Butterglory toured with Neutral Milk Hotel in 1996, and member Matt Suggs recalled: &quot;Mangum &amp; Co were confused and disorganized and lovable.&quot; In these early performances, band members would wrestle and tickle each other on stage. During the &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; tour, the audio technicians for most venues were confused and did not know what to expect. As a result, Carter took on the unusual role of &quot;mix-board translator&quot;. According to Carter: &quot;It was more like talking them through what was about to happen, because so much was happening onstage that without someone helping, it was a wail or squeal and the soundman would look at twenty instruments onstage and not know what to dive for.&quot;

==Legacy==
When Neutral Milk Hotel disbanded in 1998, the subsequent cult following propelled the band into a new level of stardom, which led many fans and journalists to call Neutral Milk Hotel an important indie rock band. Much of Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s legacy is derived from &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;, which reached sales of roughly 400,000 by 2013. Music outlets such as &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and &quot;Blender&quot; have ranked it as one of the greatest indie rock albums of all time, as well as one of the best albums of the 1990s. Richardson noted that &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; has become ingrained in the indie rock canon, and consistently attracts new listeners. Chris Morgan of &quot;Uproxx&quot; wrote: &quot;In short, people share a very deep passion for Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s highly lauded sophomore album... Lots of albums are loved, but few seem to impact people so much, and so singularly.&quot; Some critics have discussed how other recordings of the band, such as &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, are often overlooked by fans due to the popularity of &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;.

Part of Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s legacy is also drawn from the general mystique surrounding Mangum. Elephant 6 biographer Adam Clair notes that Mangum&#x27;s unexplained absence made him more notable than when he was an active member of the music industry. He actively avoided giving interviews, and as a result, music publications began to write clickbait-esque articles in which they would attempt to explain his disappearance with little to no substantive evidence. Even after Mangum resurfaced in 2008, music publications continued publishing detailed reports on his life. Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s legal representative Brian McPherson said: &quot;When the guy sneezes it&#x27;s on the front page of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;.&quot;

Neutral Milk Hotel has influenced many indie rock bands. According to Miles Raymer of &quot;Esquire&quot;, the band&#x27;s cacophonous sound and earnest lyrics were in direct contrast to the underground music scene in the 1990s. While many groups focused on the theme of detached irony, Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s abrasive and overtly emotional lyrics struck a chord with social outcasts. Groups influenced by Neutral Milk Hotel include Arcade Fire and the Decemberists, both of whom create psychedelic-folk inspired music with non-traditional instruments. Arcade Fire frontman Win Butler said that Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s association with Merge Records was a contributing factor to their signing with Merge Records. Neutral Milk Hotel also influenced bands like AJJ, Beirut, Bright Eyes, The Lumineers, Okkervil River, and Pwr Bttm, as well as artists like Melanie Martinez, Kesha, and Amanda Palmer.

<text>A remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROUV) or remotely operated vehicle (ROV) is a free-swimming submersible craft used to perform underwater observation, inspection and physical tasks such as valve operations, hydraulic functions and other general tasks within the subsea oil and gas industry, military, scientific and other applications. ROVs can also carry tooling packages for undertaking specific tasks such as pull-in and connection of flexible flowlines and umbilicals, and component replacement. They are often used to visit wrecks at great depths beyond the capacities of submersibles for research purposes, such as the &quot;Titanic&quot;, amongst others.
==Description==
This meaning is different from remote control vehicles operating on land or in the air because ROVs are designed specifically to function in underwater environments, where conditions such as high pressure, limited visibility, and the effects of buoyancy and water currents pose unique challenges. While land and aerial vehicles use wireless communication for control, ROVs typically rely on a physical connection, such as a tether or umbilical cable, to transmit power, video, and data signals, ensuring reliable operation even at great depths. The tether also provides a stable means of communication, which is crucial in underwater conditions where radio waves are absorbed quickly by water, making wireless signals ineffective for long-range underwater us.

ROVs are unoccupied, usually highly maneuverable, and operated by a crew either aboard a vessel/floating platform or on proximate land. They are common in deepwater industries such as offshore hydrocarbon extraction. They are generally, but not necessarily, linked to a host ship by a neutrally buoyant tether or, often when working in rough conditions or in deeper water, a load-carrying umbilical cable is used along with a tether management system (TMS). The TMS is either a garage-like device which contains the ROV during lowering through the splash zone or, on larger work-class ROVs, a separate assembly mounted on top of the ROV. The purpose of the TMS is to lengthen and shorten the tether so the effect of cable drag where there are underwater currents is minimized. The umbilical cable is an armored cable that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used, the TMS then relays the signals and power for the ROV down the tether cable. Once at the ROV, the electric power is distributed between the components of the ROV. However, in high-power applications, most of the electric power drives a high-power electric motor which drives a hydraulic pump. The pump is then used for propulsion and to power equipment such as torque tools and manipulator arms where electric motors would be too difficult to implement subsea. Most ROVs are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is commonly added to expand the vehicle&#x27;s capabilities. These may include sonars, magnetometers, a still camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water samplers, and instruments that measure water clarity, water temperature, water density, sound velocity, light penetration, and temperature.

===Terminology===
In the professional diving and marine contracting industry, the term remotely operated vehicle (ROV) is used.

==Classification==
Submersible ROVs are normally classified into categories based on their size, weight, ability or power. Some common ratings are:
*Micro - typically Micro-class ROVs are very small in size and weight. Today&#x27;s Micro-Class ROVs can weigh less than 3 kg. These ROVs are used as an alternative to a diver, specifically in places where a diver might not be able to physically enter such as a sewer, pipeline or small cavity.
*Mini - typically Mini-Class ROVs weigh in around 15 kg. Mini-Class ROVs are also used as a diver alternative. One person may be able to transport the complete ROV system out with them on a small boat, deploy it and complete the job without outside help. Some Micro and Mini classes are referred to as &quot;eyeball&quot;-class to differentiate them from ROVs that may be able to perform intervention tasks.
*General - typically less than 5 HP (propulsion); occasionally small three finger manipulators grippers have been installed, such as on the very early RCV 225. These ROVs may be able to carry a sonar unit and are usually used on light survey applications. Typically the maximum working depth is less than 1,000 metres though one has been developed to go as deep as 7,000 m.
*Inspection Class - these are typically rugged commercial or industrial use observation and data gathering ROVs - typically equipped with live-feed video, still photography, sonar, and other data collection sensors. Inspection Class ROVs can also have manipulator arms for light work and object manipulation.
*Light Workclass - typically less than 50 hp (propulsion). These ROVs may be able to carry some manipulators. Their chassis may be made from polymers such as polyethylene rather than the conventional stainless steel or aluminium alloys. They typically have a maximum working depth less than 2000 m.
*Heavy Workclass - typically less than 220 hp (propulsion) with an ability to carry at least two manipulators. They have a working depth up to 3500 m.
*Trenching &amp; Burial - typically more than 200 hp (propulsion) and not usually greater than 500 hp (while some do exceed that) with an ability to carry a cable laying sled and work at depths up to 6000 m in some cases.

Submersible ROVs may be &quot;free swimming&quot; where they operate neutrally buoyant on a tether directly from the launch ship or platform, or they may be &quot;garaged&quot; where they operate from a heavy submersible &quot;garage&quot; or &quot;tophat&quot; on a tether deployed from the garage which is lowered from the ship or platform. Both techniques have their pros and cons; however very deep work is normally done with a garage.

==History==
In the 1970s and &#x27;80s the Royal Navy used &quot;Cutlet&quot;, a remotely operated submersible, to recover practice torpedoes and mines. RCA (Noise) maintained the &quot;Cutlet 02&quot; System based at BUTEC ranges, whilst the &quot;03&quot; system was based at the submarine base on the Clyde and was operated and maintained by RN personnel.

The U.S. Navy funded most of the early ROV technology development in the 1960s into what was then named a &quot;Cable-Controlled Underwater Recovery Vehicle&quot; (CURV). This created the capability to perform deep-sea rescue operation and recover objects from the ocean floor, such as a nuclear bomb lost in the Mediterranean Sea after the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash. Building on this technology base; the offshore oil and gas industry created the work-class ROVs to assist in the development of offshore oil fields. More than a decade after they were first introduced, ROVs became essential in the 1980s when much of the new offshore development exceeded the reach of human divers. During the mid-1980s the marine ROV industry suffered from serious stagnation in technological development caused in part by a drop in the price of oil and a global economic recession. Since then, technological development in the ROV industry has accelerated and today ROVs perform numerous tasks in many fields. Their tasks range from simple inspection of subsea structures, pipelines, and platforms, to connecting pipelines and placing underwater manifolds. They are used extensively both in the initial construction of a sub-sea development and the subsequent repair and maintenance. The oil and gas industry has expanded beyond the use of work class ROVs to mini ROVs, which can be more useful in shallower environments. They are smaller in size, oftentimes allowing for lower costs and faster deployment times.

Submersible ROVs have been used to identify many historic shipwrecks, including the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, the &quot;Bismarck&quot;, , the SM &quot;U-111&quot;, and SS &quot;Central America&quot;. In some cases, such as the &quot;Titanic&quot; and the &quot;SS Central America&quot;, ROVs have been used to recover material from the sea floor and bring it to the surface, the most recent being in July 2024 during a &quot;Titanic&quot; expedition in recovering artefacts for the first time through a magnetometer. 

While the oil and gas industry uses the majority of ROVs, other applications include science, military, and salvage. The military uses ROV for tasks such as mine clearing and inspection. Science usage is discussed below.

==Construction==
Work-class ROVs are built with a large flotation pack on top of an aluminium chassis to provide the necessary buoyancy to perform a variety of tasks. The sophistication of construction of the aluminum frame varies depending on the manufacturer&#x27;s design. Syntactic foam is often used for the flotation material. A tooling skid may be fitted at the bottom of the system to accommodate a variety of sensors or tooling packages. By placing the light components on the top and the heavy components on the bottom, the overall system has a large separation between the center of buoyancy and the center of gravity: this provides stability and the stiffness to do work underwater. Thrusters are placed between center of buoyancy and center of gravity to maintain the attitude stability of the robot in maneuvers. Various thruster configurations and control algorithms can be used to give appropriate positional and attitude control during the operations, particularly in high current waters. Thrusters are usually in a balanced vector configuration to provide the most precise control possible.

Electrical components can be in oil-filled water tight compartments or one-atmosphere compartments to protect them from corrosion in seawater and being crushed by the extreme pressure exerted on the ROV while working deep. The ROV will be fitted with thrusters, cameras, lights, tether, a frame, and pilot controls to perform basic work. Additional sensors, such as manipulators and sonar, can be fitted as needed for specific tasks. It is common to find ROVs with two robotic arms; each manipulator may have a different gripping jaw. The cameras may also be guarded for protection against collisions.

The majority of the work-class ROVs are built as described above; however, this is not the only style in ROV building method. Smaller ROVs can have very different designs, each appropriate to its intended task. Larger ROVs are commonly deployed and operated from vessels, so the ROV may have landing skids for retrieval to the deck.

==Configurations==
Remotely operated vehicles have three basic configurations. Each of these brings specific limitations.
* Open or box frame ROVs - this is the most familiar of the ROV configurations - consisting of an open frame where all the operational sensors, thrusters, and mechanical components are enclosed. These are useful for free-swimming in light currents (less than 4 knots based upon manufacturer specifications). These are not suitable for towed applications due to their very poor hydrodynamic design. Most Work-Class and Heavy Work-Class ROVs are based upon this configuration.
* Torpedo shaped ROVs - this is a common configuration for data gathering or inspection class ROVs. The torpedo shape offers low hydrodynamic resistance, but comes with significant control limitations. The torpedo shape requires high speed (which is why this shape is used for military munitions) to remain positionally and attitudinally stable, but this type is highly vulnerable at high speed. At slow speeds (0–4 knots) suffers from numerous instabilities, such as tether induced roll and pitch, current induced roll, pitch, and yaw. It has limited control surfaces at the tail or stern, which easily cause over compensation instabilities. These are frequently referred to as &quot;Tow Fish&quot;, since they are more often used as a towed ROV.

==Tether management==
ROVs require a tether, or an umbilical, (unlike an AUV) in order to transmit power and data between the vehicle and the surface. The size and weight of the tether should be considered: too large of a tether will adversely affect the drag of the vehicle, and too small may not be robust enough for lifting requirements during launch and recovery.

The tether is typically spooled onto a tether management system (TMS) which helps manage the tether so that it does not become tangled or knotted. In some situations it can be used as a winch to lower or recover the vehicle.

==Applications==
===Survey===

Survey or inspection ROVs are generally smaller than work class ROVs and are often sub-classified as either Class I: Observation Only or Class II Observation with payload. They are used to assist with hydrographic survey, i.e. the location and positioning of subsea structures, and also for inspection work for example pipeline surveys, jacket inspections and marine hull inspection of vessels. Survey ROVs (also known as &quot;eyeballs&quot;), although smaller than workclass, often have comparable performance with regard to the ability to hold position in currents, and often carry similar tools and equipment - lighting, cameras, sonar, ultra-short baseline (USBL) beacon, Raman spectrometer, and strobe flasher depending on the payload capability of the vehicle and the needs of the user.

===Support of diving operations===
ROV operations in conjunction with simultaneous diving operations are under the overall supervision of the diving supervisor for safety reasons.

The International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) published guidelines for the offshore operation of ROVs in combined operations with divers in the document &quot;Remotely Operated Vehicle Intervention During Diving Operations&quot; (IMCA D 054, IMCA R 020), intended for use by both contractors and clients.

Remotely operated vehicles might be used during Submarine rescue operations.

===Military===

ROVs have been used by several navies for decades, primarily for minehunting and minebreaking.
In October 2008 the U.S. Navy began to improve its locally piloted rescue systems, based on the Mystic DSRV and support craft, with a modular system, the SRDRS, based on a tethered, occupied ROV called a pressurized rescue module (PRM). This followed years of tests and exercises with submarines from the fleets of several nations. It also uses the uncrewed Sibitzky ROV for disabled submarine surveying and preparation of the submarine for the PRM.

The US Navy also uses an ROV called AN/SLQ-48 Mine Neutralization Vehicle (MNV) for mine warfare. It can go away from the ship due to a connecting cable, and can reach deep. The mission packages available for the MNV are known as MP1, MP2, and MP3.
*The MP1 is a cable cutter to surface the moored mine for recovery exploitation or explosive ordnance disposal (EOD).
*The MP2 is a bomblet of polymer-bonded explosive PBXN-103 high explosive for neutralizing bottom/ground mines.
*The MP3 is a moored mine cable gripper and a float with the MP2 bomblet combination to neutralize moored mines underwater.
The charges are detonated by acoustic signal from the ship.

The AN/BLQ-11 autonomous unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) is designed for covert mine countermeasure capability and can be launched from certain submarines.

The U.S.Navy&#x27;s ROVs are only on Avenger-class mine countermeasures ships. After the grounding of USS &quot;Guardian&quot; (MCM-5) and decommissioning of USS &quot;Avenger&quot; (MCM-1), and USS &quot;Defender&quot; (MCM-2), only 11 US Minesweepers remain operating in the coastal waters of Bahrain (USS &quot;Sentry&quot; (MCM-3), USS &quot;Devastator&quot; (MCM-6), USS &quot;Gladiator&quot; (MCM-11) and USS &quot;Dextrous&quot; (MCM-13)), Japan (USS &quot;Patriot&quot; (MCM-7), USS &quot;Pioneer&quot; (MCM-9), USS &quot;Warrior&quot; (MCM-10) and USS &quot;Chief&quot; (MCM-14)), and California (USS &quot;Champion&quot; (MCM-4), USS &quot;Scout&quot; (MCM-8), and USS &quot;Ardent&quot; (MCM-12) ).

During August 19, 2011, a Boeing-made robotic submarine dubbed Echo Ranger was being tested for possible use by the U.S. military to stalk enemy waters, patrol local harbors for national security threats and scour ocean floors to detect environmental hazards. The Norwegian Navy inspected the ship Helge Ingstad by the Norwegian Blueye Pioneer underwater drone.

As their abilities grow, smaller ROVs are also increasingly being adopted by navies, coast guards, and port authorities around the globe, including the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy, Royal Netherlands Navy, the Norwegian Navy, the Royal Navy and the Saudi Border Guard. They have also been widely adopted by police departments and search and recovery teams. Useful for a variety of underwater inspection tasks such as explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), meteorology, port security, mine countermeasures (MCM), and maritime intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR).

===Science===


ROVs are also used extensively by the scientific community to study the ocean. A number of deep sea animals and plants have been discovered or studied in their natural environment through the use of ROVs; examples include the jellyfish &quot;Stellamedusa ventana&quot; and the eel-like halosaurs. In the US, cutting-edge work is done at several public and private oceanographic institutions, including the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) (with &quot;Nereus&quot;), and the University of Rhode Island / Institute for Exploration (URI/IFE). In Europe, Alfred Wegener Institute use ROVs for Arctic and Antarctic surveys of sea ice, including measuring ice draft, light transmittance, sediments, oxygen, nitrate, seawater temperature, and salinity. For these purposes, it is equipped with a single- and multibeam sonar, spectroradiometer, manipulator, fluorometer, conductivity/ temperature/depth (salinity measurement) (CTD), optode, and UV-spectrometer.

Science ROVs take many shapes and sizes. Since good video footage is a core component of most deep-sea scientific research, research ROVs tend to be outfitted with high-output lighting systems and broadcast quality cameras. Depending on the research being conducted, a science ROV will be equipped with various sampling devices and sensors. Many of these devices are one-of-a-kind, state-of-the-art experimental components that have been configured to work in the extreme environment of the deep ocean. Science ROVs also incorporate a good deal of technology that has been developed for the commercial ROV sector, such as hydraulic manipulators and highly accurate subsea navigation systems. They are also used for underwater archaeology projects such as the &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; Shipwreck Project in the Gulf of Mexico and the CoMAS project in the Mediterranean Sea.

There are several larger high-end systems that are notable for their capabilities and applications. MBARI&#x27;s &quot;Tiburon&quot; vehicle cost over $6 million US dollars to develop and is used primarily for midwater and hydrothermal research on the West Coast of the US. WHOI&#x27;s &quot;Jason&quot; system has made many significant contributions to deep-sea oceanographic research and continues to work all over the globe. URI/IFE&#x27;s &quot;Hercules&quot; ROV is one of the first science ROVs to fully incorporate a hydraulic propulsion system and is uniquely outfitted to survey and excavate ancient and modern shipwrecks. The Canadian Scientific Submersible Facility &quot;ROPOS&quot; system is continually used by several leading ocean sciences institutions and universities for challenging tasks such as deep-sea vents recovery and exploration to the maintenance and deployment of ocean observatories.

====Educational outreach====
The &quot;SeaPerch&quot; Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle (ROV) educational program is an educational tool and kit that allows elementary, middle, and high-school students to construct a simple, remotely operated underwater vehicle, from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe and other readily made materials. The SeaPerch program teaches students basic skills in ship and submarine design and encourages students to explore naval architecture and marine and ocean engineering concepts. &quot;SeaPerch&quot; is sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, as part of the National Naval Responsibility for Naval Engineering (NNRNE), and the program is managed by the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers.

Another innovative use of ROV technology was during the &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; Shipwreck Project. The &quot;Mardi Gras Shipwreck&quot; sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico in of water. The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC). In May 2007, an expedition, led by Texas A&amp;M University and funded by OGGC under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now BOEM), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study the site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the Louisiana State Museum. As part of the educational outreach Nautilus Productions in partnership with BOEM, Texas A&amp;M University, the Florida Public Archaeology Network and Veolia Environmental produced a one-hour HD documentary about the project, short videos for public viewing and provided video updates during the expedition. Video footage from the ROV was an integral part of this outreach and used extensively in the &quot;Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck&quot; documentary.

The Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center uses ROVs to teach middle school, high school, community college, and university students about ocean-related careers and help them improve their science, technology, engineering, and math skills. MATE&#x27;s annual student ROV competition challenges student teams from all over the world to compete with ROVs that they design and build. The competition uses realistic ROV-based missions that simulate a high-performance workplace environment, focusing on a different theme that exposes students to many different aspects of marine-related technical skills and occupations. The ROV competition is organized by MATE and the Marine Technology Society&#x27;s ROV Committee and funded by organizations such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Oceaneering, and many other organizations that recognize the value of highly trained students with technology skills such as ROV designing, engineering, and piloting. MATE was established with funding from the National Science Foundation and is headquartered at Monterey Peninsula College in Monterey, California.

====List of scientific ROVs====


===Media===

As cameras and sensors have evolved and vehicles have become more agile and simple to pilot, ROVs have become popular particularly with documentary filmmakers due to their ability to access deep, dangerous, and confined areas unattainable by divers. There is no limit to how long an ROV can be submerged and capturing footage, which allows for previously unseen perspectives to be gained. ROVs have been used in the filming of several documentaries, including Nat Geo&#x27;s Shark Men and The Dark Secrets of the Lusitania and the BBC Wildlife Special Spy in the Huddle.

Due to their extensive use by military, law enforcement, and coastguard services, ROVs have also featured in crime dramas such as the popular CBS series CSI.

===Hobby===
With an increased interest in the ocean by many people, both young and old, and the increased availability of once expensive and non-commercially available equipment, ROVs have become a popular hobby amongst many. This hobby involves the construction of small ROVs that generally are made out of PVC piping and often can dive to depths between 50 and 100 feet but some have managed to get to 300 feet.

=== STEM education ===
This new interest in ROVs has led to the formation of many competitions, including MATE (Marine Advanced Technology Education), NURC (National Underwater Robotics Challenge), and RoboSub. These are competitions in which competitors, most commonly schools and other organizations, compete against each other in a series of tasks using ROVs that they have built. Most hobby ROVs are tested in swimming pools and lakes where the water is calm, however some have tested their own personal ROVs in the sea. Doing so, however, creates many difficulties due to waves and currents that can cause the ROV to stray off course or struggle to push through the surf due to the small size of engines that are fitted to most hobby ROVs.

<doc id="299464" wikidata="Q1018755" url="?curid=299464" title="Byzantine coinage">
<text>Byzantine currency, money used in the Eastern Roman Empire after the fall of the West, consisted of mainly two types of coins: gold solidi and hyperpyra and a variety of clearly valued bronze coins. By the 15th century, the currency was issued only in debased silver stavrata and minor copper coins with no gold issue. The Byzantine Empire established and operated several mints throughout its history. Aside from the main metropolitan mint in the capital, Constantinople, a varying number of provincial mints were also established in other urban centres, especially during the 6th century.

Most provincial mints except for Syracuse were closed or lost to Arab Muslim invasions in the Mediterranean Region by the mid-7th century onwards. After the loss of Syracuse in 878, Constantinople became the sole mint for gold and silver coinage until the late 11th century, when major provincial mints began to re-appear. Many mints, both imperial and, as the Byzantine Empire fragmented, belonging to autonomous local rulers, were operated in the 12th to 14th centuries. Constantinople and Trebizond, capital of the independent Empire of Trebizond (1204–1461), survived until the invasion of Anatolia by the Ottoman Turks in the mid-15th century.

==Iconography==

Early Byzantine coins continue the late Greco-Roman conventions: on the obverse the head of the Roman Emperor, now full face rather than in profile; on the reverse, usually a Christian symbol such as the cross or an angel (the two tending to merge into one another). The gold coins of Justinian II departed from these stable conventions by putting a bust of Christ on the obverse, and a half or full-length portrait of the Emperor on the reverse. These innovations incidentally had the effect of leading the Umayyad caliph ʿAbd al-Malik, who had previously copied Byzantine styles but replacing Christian symbols with Islamic equivalents, finally to develop a distinctive Islamic style, with only lettering on both sides. This was then used on nearly all Islamic coinage until the modern period.
The type of Justinian II was revived after the end of iconoclasm, and with variations remained the norm until the end of the Empire. In the 10th century, so-called &quot;anonymous folles&quot; were struck instead of the earlier coins depicting the emperor. The anonymous folles featured the bust of Christ on the obverse and the inscription &quot;XRISTUS/bASILEU/bASILE&quot;, which translates to &quot;Christ, Emperor of Emperors&quot;.

Byzantine coins followed, and took to the furthest extreme, the tendency of precious metal coinage to get thinner and wider as time goes on. Late Byzantine gold coins became thin wafers that could be bent by hand. The Byzantine coinage had a prestige that lasted until near the end of the Empire. European rulers, once they again started issuing their own coins, tended to follow a simplified version of Byzantine patterns, with full face ruler portraits on the obverse.

==Denominations==
The start of what is viewed as Byzantine currency by numismatics began with the monetary reform of Anastasius in 498, who reformed the late Roman Empire coinage system which consisted of the gold &quot;solidus&quot; and the bronze &quot;nummi&quot;. The &quot;nummus&quot; was an extremely small bronze coin, at about 8–10 mm, weight of 0.56 g making it at 576 to the Roman pound which was inconvenient because a large number of them were required even for small transactions.

New bronze coins, multiples of the &quot;nummus&quot; were introduced, such as the 40 &quot;nummi&quot; (also known as the &quot;follis&quot;), 20 &quot;nummi&quot; (also known as the &quot;semifollis&quot;), 10 &quot;nummi&quot; (also known as the &quot;decanummium&quot;, and 5 &quot;nummi&quot; coins (also known as the &quot;pentanummium&quot;); other denominations were occasionally produced. The obverse (front) of these coins featured a highly stylized portrait of the emperor while the reverse (back) featured the value of the denomination represented according to the Greek numbering system (M=40, Λ=30, K=20, I=10, E=5). Silver coins were rarely produced.

The only regularly issued silver coin was the Hexagram first issued by Heraclius in 615 which lasted until the end of the 7th century, minted in varying fineness with a weight generally between 7.5 and 8.5 grams. It was succeeded by the initially ceremonial &quot;miliaresion&quot; established by Leo III the Isaurian in ca. 720, which became standard issue from ca. 830 on and until the late 11th century, when it was discontinued after being severely debased. Small transactions were conducted with bronze coinage throughout this period.

The gold &quot;solidus&quot; or &quot;nomisma&quot; remained a standard of international commerce until the 11th century, when it began to be debased under successive emperors beginning in the 1030s under the emperor Romanos Argyros (1028–1034). Until that time, the fineness of the gold remained consistent at about 0.955–0.980.

The Byzantine monetary system changed during the 7th century when the 40 &quot;nummi&quot; (also known as the &quot;follis&quot;), now significantly smaller, became the only bronze coin to be regularly issued. Although Justinian II (685–695 and 705–711) attempted a restoration of the &quot;follis&quot; size of Justinian I, the &quot;follis&quot; continued to slowly decrease in size.

In the early 9th century, a three-fourths-weight solidus was issued in parallel with a full-weight solidus, both preserving the standard of fineness, under a failed plan to force the market to accept the underweight coins at the value of the full weight coins. The 11⁄12 weight coin was called a &quot;tetarteron&quot; (a Greek comparative adjective, literally &quot;fourth-er&quot;), and the full weight solidus was called the &quot;histamenon&quot;. The &quot;tetarteron&quot; was unpopular and was only sporadically reissued during the 10th century. The full weight solidus was struck at 72 to the Roman pound, roughly 4.48 grams in weight. There were also solidi of weight reduced by one &quot;siliqua&quot; issued for trade with the Near East. These reduced solidi, with a star both on obverse and reverse, weighed about 4.25 g.

The Byzantine solidus was valued in Western Europe, where it became known as the &quot;bezant&quot;, a corruption of &quot;Byzantium&quot;. The term &quot;bezant&quot; then became the name for the heraldic symbol of a roundel, tincture or – i.e. a gold disc.

==Alexius I reforms==

Former money changer Michael IV the Paphlagonian (1034–41) assumed the throne of Byzantium in 1034 and began the slow process of debasing both the &quot;tetarteron nomisma&quot; and the &quot;histamenon nomisma&quot;. The debasement was gradual at first, but then accelerated rapidly. about 21 carats (87.5% pure) during the reign of Constantine IX (1042–1055), 18 carats (75%) under Constantine X (1059–1067), 16 carats (66.7%) under Romanus IV (1068–1071), 14 carats (58%) under Michael VII (1071–1078), 8 carats (33%) under Nicephorus III (1078–1081) and 0 to 8 carats during the first eleven years of the reign of Alexius I (1081–1118). Under Alexius I Comnenus (1081–1118) the debased solidus (&quot;tetarteron&quot; and &quot;histamenon&quot;) was discontinued and a gold coinage of higher fineness (generally .900-.950) was established, commonly called the &quot;hyperpyron&quot; at 4.45 grs. The &quot;hyperpyron&quot; was slightly smaller than the solidus.

It was introduced along with the electrum &quot;aspron trachy&quot; worth a third of a &quot;hyperpyron&quot; and about 25% gold and 75% silver, the billon &quot;aspron trachy&quot; or &quot;stamenon&quot; valued at 48 to the hyperpyron and with 7% silver wash and the copper &quot;tetarteron&quot; and &quot;noummion&quot; worth 18 and 36 to the billon &quot;aspron trachy&quot;.

==Andronicus II reforms==

During Andronicus II&#x27;s reign he instituted new denominations based on the hyperpyron. They were the silver miliaresion or basilika at 12 to the hyperpyron and the billon politika at 96 per hyperpyron,
along with the copper assaria, tournesia and follara.
The &quot;basilikon&quot; was a copy of the Venetian ducat and circulated from 1304 for fifty years.

The &quot;hyperpyron&quot; remained in regular issue and circulation until the 1350s, remaining in use thereafter only as a money of account. After 1400, Byzantine coinage became insignificant, as Italian money became the predominant circulating coinage.

These &quot;scyphate&quot; (cup-shaped) coins known as &quot;trachy&quot; were issued in both electrum (debased gold) and billon (debased silver). The exact reason for such coins is not known, although it is usually theorized that they were shaped for easier stacking.

==1367 reform==

During this last phase of Byzantine coinage gold issues were discontinued and a regular silver issue was commenced. The denomination was the Stavraton issued in 1, , and stavraton. Also issued were the copper follaro and tornesse.

==Buying power==
It is possible to get some small snapshots in time, specific to region, culture and local inflation. The literary world is littered with references to prices from different time frames. A good portion of them may be inaccurate or tainted by translation.

At Jerusalem in the sixth century a building worker received solidus per day, that is 21 folles. A casual labourer at Alexandria in the early seventh century earned solidus. A family&#x27;s vegetable allowance for one day cost 5 folles. A pound of fish 6 folles, a loaf of bread was 3 folles worth at a time of shortage. The cheapest blanket was worth solidus, a second-hand cloak 1 solidus, and a donkey 3 or 4 solidi.

<text>Silver Jews were an American indie rock band from New York City, formed in 1989 by David Berman alongside Pavement members Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich. Berman was the only constant band member. During the last few albums, Cassie Berman became a regular member of the band. They disbanded in 2009.

==History==
===Early years===
Berman was living in Hoboken, New Jersey with two University of Virginia friends, Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich, and recording discordant tapes in their living room. Around this time, he worked as a security guard at New York&#x27;s Whitney Museum of American Art, which influenced their music. Berman said, &quot;We were working at the Whitney with all this conceptual art, and we were learning about it [...] And so I thought, &quot;Well let&#x27;s just make this record that looks like a record, and has song titles and everything, but the songs would be the ones we make at home that sound terrible.&quot; Although the band is often called a Pavement side project, it was formed at about the same time as Pavement.

&quot;Walnut Falcons&quot; was tossed around as a potential band name before &quot;Silver Jews&quot; was chosen. Berman, who was Jewish, joked that the name came from a billboard he saw reading &quot;Silver Jewelry&quot; and later revealed that the name was actually intended to be a pseudonym for a conceptual art piece but instead evolved into the actual band. Others claim that the name pays homage to Silver Apples, the Beatles&#x27; early name &quot;the Silver Beatles&quot;, and a slang term for Jews with blonde hair. In an interview with Vish Khanna in June 2019, Berman said, &quot;Silver Jews was a very burdensome band name. It confused people: I never made it clear what I meant by it. It wasn&#x27;t until the end until I realized what a proper definition of Silver Jew would be outside of the context of my music, which would be a Jew that was Jewish down through patrilineal descent, which would be a Jew that&#x27;s not a Jew, really. It&#x27;s the outsiders to the outsiders.&quot;

===Touring===

Berman had pointedly avoided playing live throughout much of the band&#x27;s existence but Silver Jews surprised fans by announcing their first-ever tour following the release of &quot;Tanglewood Numbers&quot; in 2005. They toured North America, Europe, and Israel in 2006. A documentary, titled &quot;Silver Jew&quot;, was filmed during the band&#x27;s time in Israel.

===Break up===
On January 22, 2009, Berman announced via the official Drag City messageboard that he planned to retire from music and that the Silver Jews would play their final show on &quot;Bluegrass Underground&quot; at Cumberland Caverns in McMinnville, Tennessee at 3 pm on January 31, 2009. The caverns are located 333 feet underground, and only 300 general admission tickets were made available. Berman stated that he would play his 15 favorite Silver Jews songs. He also wrote that his intentions are to move to &quot;screenwriting or muckraking&quot;. He closed the entry by saying, &quot;I always said we would stop before we got bad. If I continue to record I might accidentally write the answer song to &#x27;Shiny Happy People&#x27;.&quot;

Berman originally planned for the concert to be recorded and aired sometime in February 2009 on Nashville&#x27;s famed WSM AM radio station; however, the day before the show, Berman posted on the Drag City message board to say that he had &quot;negotiated out of the WSM part out of the deal.&quot; The concert was documented by several 16 mm film cameras, and Berman hinted at a possible DVD release of the show at some point in the future.

The last song that the Silver Jews performed live was &quot;Smith and Jones Forever&quot;.

===Post-breakup events===
On June 19, 2012, &quot;Early Times&quot; was released by Drag City. &quot;Early Times&quot; is a compilation of EPs and singles that were released before the debut LP &quot;Starlite Walker&quot;.

In 2015, Bob Nastanovich posted a photo to his Facebook page featuring the band rehearsing. He said that the band is working on two new songs, &quot;The Veranda Over The Toy Shoppe&quot;, and &quot;Wacky Package Eyes&quot;. David Berman later said the photo was a prank. Berman instead returned with new project Purple Mountains in July 2019, but died the following month.

==Musical style and artistry==
The Silver Jews&#x27; musical style has been described by AllMusic as &quot;a beautiful mess of indie rock, country-rock and lo-fi with lyrics both witty and profound&quot;, while &quot;Billboard&quot; described them as a &quot;lo-fi mixture of noise rock and country music&quot;.

The Silver Jews&#x27; album artwork often featured horizons; in the case of Bright Flight it has been surmised to be symbolic of the theme.

<doc id="299472" wikidata="Q36458" url="?curid=299472" title="Multicellular organism">
<text>A multicellular organism is an organism that consists of more than one cell, unlike unicellular organisms. All species of animals, land plants and most fungi are multicellular, as are many algae, whereas a few organisms are partially uni- and partially multicellular, like slime molds and social amoebae such as the genus &quot;Dictyostelium&quot;.

Multicellular organisms arise in various ways, for example by cell division or by aggregation of many single cells. Colonial organisms are the result of many identical individuals joining together to form a colony. However, it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms, because the two concepts are not distinct; colonial protists have been dubbed &quot;pluricellular&quot; rather than &quot;multicellular&quot;. There are also macroscopic organisms that are multinucleate though technically unicellular, such as the Xenophyophorea that can reach 20 cm.

==Evolutionary history==

=== Occurrence ===

Multicellularity has evolved independently at least 25 times in eukaryotes, and also in some prokaryotes, like cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, actinomycetes, &quot;Magnetoglobus multicellularis&quot; or &quot;Methanosarcina&quot;. However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, symbiomycotan fungi, brown algae, red algae, green algae, and land plants. It evolved repeatedly for Chloroplastida (green algae and land plants), once for animals, once for brown algae, three times in the fungi (chytrids, ascomycetes, and basidiomycetes) and perhaps several times for slime molds and red algae. The first evidence of multicellular organization, which is when unicellular organisms coordinate behaviors and may be an evolutionary precursor to true multicellularity, is from cyanobacteria-like organisms that lived 3.0–3.5 billion years ago. To reproduce, true multicellular organisms must solve the problem of regenerating a whole organism from germ cells (i.e., sperm and egg cells), an issue that is studied in evolutionary developmental biology. Animals have evolved a considerable diversity of cell types in a multicellular body (100–150 different cell types), compared with 10–20 in plants and fungi.

===Loss of multicellularity===
Loss of multicellularity occurred in some groups. Fungi are predominantly multicellular, though early diverging lineages are largely unicellular (e.g., Microsporidia) and there have been numerous reversions to unicellularity across fungi (e.g., &quot;Saccharomycotina&quot;, &quot;Cryptococcus&quot;, and other yeasts). It may also have occurred in some red algae (e.g., &quot;Porphyridium&quot;), but they may be primitively unicellular. Loss of multicellularity is also considered probable in some green algae (e.g., &quot;Chlorella vulgaris&quot; and some Ulvophyceae). In other groups, generally parasites, a reduction of multicellularity occurred, in the number or types of cells (e.g., the myxozoans, multicellular organisms, earlier thought to be unicellular, are probably extremely reduced cnidarians).

===Cancer===
Multicellular organisms, especially long-living animals, face the challenge of cancer, which occurs when cells fail to regulate their growth within the normal program of development. Changes in tissue morphology can be observed during this process. Cancer in animals (metazoans) has often been described as a loss of multicellularity and an atavistic reversion towards a unicellular-like state. Many genes responsible for the establishment of multicellularity that originated around the appearance of metazoans are deregulated in cancer cells, including genes that control cell differentiation, adhesion and cell-to-cell communication. There is a discussion about the possibility of existence of cancer in other multicellular organisms or even in protozoa. For example, plant galls have been characterized as tumors, but some authors argue that plants do not develop cancer.

===Separation of somatic and germ cells===
In some multicellular groups, which are called Weismannists, a separation between a sterile somatic cell line and a germ cell line evolved. However, Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g., vertebrates, arthropods, &quot;Volvox&quot;), as a great part of species have the capacity for somatic embryogenesis (e.g., land plants, most algae, many invertebrates).

==Origin hypotheses==

One hypothesis for the origin of multicellularity is that a group of function-specific cells aggregated into a slug-like mass called a grex, which moved as a multicellular unit. This is essentially what slime molds do. Another hypothesis is that a primitive cell underwent nucleus division, thereby becoming a coenocyte. A membrane would then form around each nucleus (and the cellular space and organelles occupied in the space), thereby resulting in a group of connected cells in one organism (this mechanism is observable in Drosophila). A third hypothesis is that as a unicellular organism divided, the daughter cells failed to separate, resulting in a conglomeration of identical cells in one organism, which could later develop specialized tissues. This is what plant and animal embryos do as well as colonial choanoflagellates.

Because the first multicellular organisms were simple, soft organisms lacking bone, shell, or other hard body parts, they are not well preserved in the fossil record. One exception may be the demosponge, which may have left a chemical signature in ancient rocks. The earliest fossils of multicellular organisms include the contested &quot;Grypania spiralis&quot; and the fossils of the black shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian Group Fossil B Formation in Gabon (Gabonionta). The Doushantuo Formation has yielded 600 million year old microfossils with evidence of multicellular traits.

Until recently, phylogenetic reconstruction has been through anatomical (particularly embryological) similarities. This is inexact, as living multicellular organisms such as animals and plants are more than 500 million years removed from their single-cell ancestors. Such a passage of time allows both divergent and convergent evolution time to mimic similarities and accumulate differences between groups of modern and extinct ancestral species. Modern phylogenetics uses sophisticated techniques such as alloenzymes, satellite DNA and other molecular markers to describe traits that are shared between distantly related lineages.

The evolution of multicellularity could have occurred in several different ways, some of which are described below:

===The symbiotic theory===
This theory suggests that the first multicellular organisms occurred from symbiosis (cooperation) of different species of single-cell organisms, each with different roles. Over time these organisms would become so dependent on each other that they would not be able to survive independently, eventually leading to the incorporation of their genomes into one multicellular organism. Each respective organism would become a separate lineage of differentiated cells within the newly created species.

This kind of severely co-dependent symbiosis can be seen frequently, such as in the relationship between clown fish and Riterri sea anemones. In these cases, it is extremely doubtful whether either species would survive very long if the other became extinct. However, the problem with this theory is that it is still not known how each organism&#x27;s DNA could be incorporated into one single genome to constitute them as a single species. Although such symbiosis is theorized to have occurred (e.g., mitochondria and chloroplasts in animal and plant cells—endosymbiosis), it has happened only extremely rarely and, even then, the genomes of the endosymbionts have retained an element of distinction, separately replicating their DNA during mitosis of the host species. For instance, the two or three symbiotic organisms forming the composite lichen, although dependent on each other for survival, have to separately reproduce and then re-form to create one individual organism once more.

===The cellularization (syncytial) theory===
This theory states that a single unicellular organism, with multiple nuclei, could have developed internal membrane partitions around each of its nuclei. Many protists such as the ciliates or slime molds can have several nuclei, lending support to this hypothesis. However, the simple presence of multiple nuclei is not enough to support the theory. Multiple nuclei of ciliates are dissimilar and have clear differentiated functions. The &quot;macro&quot;nucleus serves the organism&#x27;s needs, whereas the &quot;micro&quot;nucleus is used for sexual reproduction with exchange of genetic material. Slime molds syncitia form from individual amoeboid cells, like syncitial tissues of some multicellular organisms, not the other way round. To be deemed valid, this theory needs a demonstrable example and mechanism of generation of a multicellular organism from a pre-existing syncytium.

===The colonial theory===
The colonial theory of Haeckel, 1874, proposes that the symbiosis of many organisms of the same species (unlike the symbiotic theory, which suggests the symbiosis of different species) led to a multicellular organism. At least some - it is presumed land-evolved - multicellularity occurs by cells separating and then rejoining (e.g., cellular slime molds) whereas for the majority of multicellular types (those that evolved within aquatic environments), multicellularity occurs as a consequence of cells failing to separate following division. The mechanism of this latter colony formation can be as simple as incomplete cytokinesis, though multicellularity is also typically considered to involve cellular differentiation.
The advantage of the Colonial Theory hypothesis is that it has been seen to occur independently in 16 different protoctistan phyla. For instance, during food shortages the amoeba Dictyostelium groups together in a colony that moves as one to a new location. Some of these amoeba then slightly differentiate from each other. Other examples of colonial organisation in protista are Volvocaceae, such as Eudorina and Volvox, the latter of which consists of up to 500–50,000 cells (depending on the species), only a fraction of which reproduce. For example, in one species 25–35 cells reproduce, 8 asexually and around 15–25 sexually. However, it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms, as the two concepts are not distinct; colonial protists have been dubbed &quot;pluricellular&quot; rather than &quot;multicellular&quot;.

===The synzoospore theory===
Some authors suggest that the origin of multicellularity, at least in Metazoa, occurred due to a transition from temporal to spatial cell differentiation, rather than through a gradual evolution of cell differentiation, as affirmed in Haeckel&#x27;s gastraea theory.

===GK-PID===
About 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called guanylate kinase protein-interaction domain (GK-PID) may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.

===The role of viruses===
Genes borrowed from viruses and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) have recently been identified as playing a crucial role in the differentiation of multicellular tissues and organs and even in sexual reproduction, in the fusion of egg cells and sperm.
Such fused cells are also involved in metazoan membranes such as those that prevent chemicals from crossing the placenta and the brain body separation. Two viral components have been identified. The first is syncytin, which came from a virus.
The second identified in 2002 is called EFF-1, which helps form the skin of &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, part of a whole family of FF proteins. Felix Rey, of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, has constructed the 3D structure of the EFF-1 protein and shown it does the work of linking one cell to another, in viral infections.
The fact that all known cell fusion molecules are viral in origin suggests that they have been vitally important to the inter-cellular communication systems that enabled multicellularity. Without the ability of cellular fusion, colonies could have formed, but anything even as complex as a sponge would not have been possible.

=== Oxygen availability hypothesis ===
This theory suggests that the oxygen available in the atmosphere of early Earth could have been the limiting factor for the emergence of multicellular life. This hypothesis is based on the correlation between the emergence of multicellular life and the increase of oxygen levels during this time. This would have taken place after the Great Oxidation Event but before the most recent rise in oxygen. Mills concludes that the amount of oxygen present during the Ediacaran is not necessary for complex life and therefore is unlikely to have been the driving factor for the origin of multicellularity.

=== Snowball Earth hypothesis ===
A &quot;snowball Earth&quot; is a geological event where the entire surface of the Earth is covered in snow and ice. The term can either refer to individual events (of which there were at least two) or to the larger geologic period during which all the known total glaciations occurred.

The most recent snowball Earth took place during the Cryogenian period and consisted of two global glaciation events known as the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations. Xiao &quot;et al&quot;. suggest that between the period of time known as the &quot;Boring Billion&quot; and the snowball Earth, simple life could have had time to innovate and evolve, which could later lead to the evolution of multicellularity.

The snowball Earth hypothesis in regards to multicellularity proposes that the Cryogenian period in Earth&#x27;s history could have been the catalyst for the evolution of complex multicellular life. Brocks suggests that the time between the Sturtian Glacian and the more recent Marinoan Glacian allowed for planktonic algae to dominate the seas making way for rapid diversity of life for both plant and animal lineages. Complex life quickly emerged and diversified in what is known as the Cambrian explosion shortly after the Marinoan.

=== Predation hypothesis ===
The predation hypothesis suggests that to avoid being eaten by predators, simple single-celled organisms evolved multicellularity to make it harder to be consumed as prey. Herron et al. performed laboratory evolution experiments on the single-celled green alga, &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot;, using paramecium as a predator. They found that in the presence of this predator, &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; does indeed evolve simple multicellular features.

== Experimental evolution ==
It is impossible to know what happened when single cells evolved into multicellular organisms hundreds of millions of years ago. However, we can identify mutations that can turn single-celled organisms into multicellular ones. This would demonstrate the possibility of such an event. Unicellular species can relatively easily acquire mutations that make them attach to each other—the first step towards multicellularity. Multiple normally unicellular species have been evolved to exhibit such early steps:
* yeast are long known to exhibit &quot;flocculation&quot;. One of the first yeast genes found to cause this phenotype is FLO1. A more strikingly clumped phenotype is called &quot;snowflake&quot;, caused by the loss of a single transcription factor &quot;Ace2&quot;. &quot;Snowflake&quot; yeast grow into multicellular clusters that sediment quickly; they were identified by directed evolution. More recently (2024), snowflake yeast were subject to over 3,000 generations of further directed evolution, forming macroscopic assemblies on the scale of millimeters. Changes in multiple genes were identified. In addition, the authors reported that only anaerobic cultures of snowflake yeast evolved this trait, while the aerobic ones did not.
* A range of green algae species have been experimentally evolved to form larger clumps. When &quot;Chlorella vulgaris&quot; is grown with a predator &quot;Ochromonas vallescia&quot;, it starts forming small colonies, which are harder to ingest due to the larger size. The same is true for &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot; under predation by &quot;Brachionus calyciflorus&quot; and &quot;Paramecium tetraurelia&quot;.

&quot;C. reinhartii&quot; normally starts as a motile single-celled propagule; this single cell asexually reproduces by undergoing 2–5 rounds of mitosis as a small clump of non-motile cells, then all cells become single-celled propagules and the clump dissolves. With a few generations under &quot;Paramecium&quot; predation, the &quot;clump&quot; becomes a persistent structure: only some cells become propagules. Some populations go further and evolved multi-celled propagules: instead of peeling off single cells from the clump, the clump now reproduces by peeling off smaller clumps.

==Advantages==

Multicellularity allows an organism to exceed the size limits normally imposed by diffusion: single cells with increased size have a decreased surface-to-volume ratio and have difficulty absorbing sufficient nutrients and transporting them throughout the cell. Multicellular organisms thus have the competitive advantages of an increase in size without its limitations. They can have longer lifespans as they can continue living when individual cells die. Multicellularity also permits increasing complexity by allowing differentiation of cell types within one organism.

Whether all of these can be seen as advantages however is debatable: The vast majority of living organisms are single celled, and even in terms of biomass, single celled organisms are far more successful than animals, although not plants.
Rather than seeing traits such as longer lifespans and greater size as an advantage, many biologists see these only as examples of diversity, with associated tradeoffs.

==Gene expression changes in the transition from uni- to multicellularity==

During the evolutionary transition from unicellular organisms to multicellular organisms, the expression of genes associated with reproduction and survival likely changed. In the unicellular state, genes associated with reproduction and survival are expressed in a way that enhances the fitness of individual cells, but after the transition to multicellularity, the pattern of expression of these genes must have substantially changed so that individual cells become more specialized in their function relative to reproduction and survival. As the multicellular organism emerged, gene expression patterns became compartmentalized between cells that specialized in reproduction (germline cells) and those that specialized in survival (somatic cells). As the transition progressed, cells that specialized tended to lose their own individuality and would no longer be able to both survive and reproduce outside the context of the group.

<text>Lance Bangs (born September 4, 1972) is an American filmmaker and music video director. He directed the David Cross film &quot;Let America Laugh&quot;. Bangs has also been heavily involved in the filming and production of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Jackass&quot; television series and its subsequent movies.

==Life and career==
Bangs was born in Sacramento, California. He founded &quot;Flicker Film Festival&quot;, a series of Super8mm and 16mm film screenings, while in Athens, Georgia, in 1990 along with Michael Lachowski and Angie Grass.

He has created videos for Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Neutral Milk Hotel, Green Day, Arcade Fire, The Shins, The Thermals, Belle &amp; Sebastian, Menomena, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, R.E.M., Mike Watt, Death Cab for Cutie, The Black Keys, Kanye West, Odd Future, Pavement, and George Harrison.

As a commercial director he has worked with United Parcel Service, Nike, Subway, Rock Band and Volvo for several campaigns, including the Titanium Lion-winning campaign for Volvo&#x27;s &quot;Life on Board Project&quot; campaign from the 2005 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.

He produced DVDs for the Directors Label Series, covering the work of Chris Cunningham, Michel Gondry, Spike Jonze, Mark Romanek, Stéphane Sednaoui, Jonathan Glazer and Anton Corbijn. He has also been involved with Spike Jonze on a number of occasions, being one of the cameramen for &quot;&quot;, &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;, &quot;Jackass 2.5&quot;, &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;, &quot;Jackass 3.5&quot;, &quot;Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa&quot;, &quot;Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa .5&quot;, &quot;Jackass Forever&quot;, and &quot;Jackass 4.5&quot;. He also was a part of the &quot;Jackassworld.com: 24 Hour Takeover&quot;, filming behind the scenes material. In 2009, they were shortlisted for an Academy Award for &quot;Tell Them Anything You Want: A Portrait of Maurice Sendak&quot;.

He has aired an ongoing series of short (often music-related) documentaries on VBS.TV since 2007 in the form of his show &quot;Bangs&quot;. He also hosts a show on Viceland called Flophouse.

Bangs is married to Corin Tucker of Sleater-Kinney and together they have two children. He has performed musically as well, both with his wife and with Canadian indie rock group The Dudes. There were plans for a west coast summer 2009 tour, billed as Lance Bangs w/ The Dudes.

<text>The laying on of hands is a religious practice. In Judaism &quot;semikhah&quot; (, &quot;leaning [of the hands]&quot;) accompanies the conferring of a blessing or authority.

In Christian churches, chirotony is used as both a symbolic and formal method of invoking the Holy Spirit primarily during baptisms and confirmations, healing services, blessings, and ordination of priests, ministers, elders, deacons, and other church officers, along with a variety of other church sacraments and holy ceremonies.

==Jewish tradition==

The laying on of hands was an action referred to on numerous occasions in the Hebrew Bible to accompany the conferring of a blessing or authority.
Moses ordained Joshua through &quot;semikhah&quot;—i.e. by the laying on of hands: , . The Bible adds that Joshua was thereby &quot;filled with the spirit of wisdom&quot;. Moses also ordained the 70 elders (). The elders later ordained their successors in this way. Their successors in turn ordained others. This chain of hands-on &quot;semikhah&quot; continued through the time of the Second Temple, to an undetermined time. The exact date that the original &quot;semikhah&quot; succession ended is not certain. Many medieval authorities believed that this occurred during the reign of Hillel II, circa 360 CE. However, it seems to have continued at least until 425 CE when Theodosius II executed Gamaliel VI and suppressed the Patriarchate and Sanhedrin.

Laying on of hands can also refer to the practice of laying hands over one&#x27;s sacrificial animal (sin-offering), before it was slaughtered, based on a teaching in Leviticus 4:24: &quot;And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat.&quot; In Pseudo Jonathan&#x27;s Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, the translator of the verse explains its sense: &quot;And he shall lay his right hand with force on the head of the goat.&quot; According to Philo of Alexandria, the custom of laying on of hands was done in conjunction with a declaration, where the owner of the animal would say: &quot;These hands have not taken a bribe to distort justice, neither have they divided the spoil, etc.&quot; According to Jewish tradition, the first dispute in Israel concerned whether or not it was permissible to lay hands upon one&#x27;s sacrificial animal by applying one&#x27;s full body weight on a Festival Day.

==Christian traditions==


In the New Testament the laying on of hands was associated with the receiving of the Holy Spirit (see Acts ). Initially the Apostles laid hands on new believers as well as believers (see ).

The New Testament also associates the laying on of hands with the conferral of authority or designation of a person to a position of responsibility. (See Acts , Acts ; and . Also possibly Acts , where &quot;ordained&quot;—Greek: —may be translated &quot;extended the hand&quot;.) The use of the laying on of hands for the ordination of church officers has continued in many branches of Christianity.

=== Anglicanism ===
Laying on of hands is part of Anglican confirmation, anointing of the sick, and other parts of liturgy and pastoral offices. The rubric in the confirmation service requires the bishop to lay only one hand, symbolising that he has less spiritual authority than an apostle (who laid both hands).

=== Roman Catholic Church ===
In the Roman Catholic Church, the laying on of hands has been and continues to be used in some of the rites for the Seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church. First, it is the essential gesture (or &quot;matter&quot;) for the Sacrament of Holy Orders (diaconate, priesthood, and episcopacy). Second, it accompanies the anointing with Sacred Chrism in the Sacrament of Confirmation. Third, it is part of the ritual for the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, taken after the command in the Epistle of James: &quot;Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord&quot; (James 5:14 ESV).

=== Eastern Christianity ===
In Eastern Christianity, laying on of hands is used for the ordination (called ) of the higher clergy (bishops, priests and deacons), and is also performed at the end of the sacrament of unction.

=== Evangelicalism ===
In Evangelical Christianity, the laying on of hands takes place for pastoral ordination.

==== Baptists ====
In few Baptist churches, the laying on of hands rarely takes place after a believer&#x27;s baptism although this is traditional to some sects and not practiced as a Biblical command nor example. This is one of the two points which was added in the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith in 1742. Southern Baptist Christians employ the laying on of hands during the ordination of clergymen (such as deacons, assistant, and senior pastors) as well as situations of calling for divine healing.

==== Pentecostalism ====
Pentecostal Christians practice the laying on of hands as part of prayer for divine healing (faith healing) and the anointing of the sick.

=== Latter-day Saints ===
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe the restoration of Christ&#x27;s priesthood came about by the laying on of hands by the resurrected John the Baptist to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in 1829, and laying on of hands is seen as a necessary part of Confirmation. Latter-day Saints lay on hands when ordaining members to to the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods and when setting members apart to serve in other positions in the church. When asked by a member who is ill, two elders of the Church anoint the sick member&#x27;s head with consecrated olive oil and then lay hands upon their head and as guided by the Holy Spirit, bless them.

== African traditional medicine ==
The San peoples of Southern Africa use the laying on of hands as a healing practice. As described by professor Richard Katz, the healers of the !Kung people lay their hands on a sick person to draw the sickness out of them and into the healer in a &quot;difficult, painful&quot; process.

== Navajo religious ceremonies ==

A similar practice of laying on of hands is also used in Navajo religious ceremonies.

==State use==

The laying on of hands, known as the royal touch, was performed by kings in England and France, and was believed to cure scrofula (also called &quot;King&#x27;s Evil&quot; at the time), a name given to a number of skin diseases. The rite of the king&#x27;s touch began in France with Robert II the Pious, but legend later attributed the practice to Clovis as Merovingian founder of the Holy Roman kingdom, and Edward the Confessor in England. The belief continued to be common throughout the Middle Ages but began to die out with the Enlightenment. Queen Anne was the last British monarch to claim to possess this divine ability, though the Jacobite pretenders also claimed to do so. The French monarchy maintained the practice up until the 19th century. The act was usually performed at large ceremonies, often at Easter or other holy days.

<text>Danielson is an American rock band from Clarksboro, New Jersey, that plays indie pop gospel music. The group consists of frontman Daniel Smith and a number of various artists with whom he collaborates. Smith has also released solo work as Brother Danielson.

When joined by his family the band is known as Danielson Famile or Danielson Family, whose members have included Smith; his &quot;siblings Andrew, David, Megan, and Rachel; wife Elin; friends Christiaan &amp; Melissa Palladino; [and] daughters Lilly and Ida&quot;. Sufjan Stevens has also recorded and performed with the group.

The band is known for Smith&#x27;s squeaky, falsetto vocals, innovative musical arrangements, and matching uniforms &quot;that act, according to Daniel, as &#x27;visual reminders of the spiritual and emotional healing taking place&#x27; within audience members.&quot; During some performances Smith has &quot;worn a nine-foot tall, hand-made nine-fruit tree to &#x27;bear the good fruit,&#x27;&quot; in reference to the fruit of the Holy Spirit.

==History==
In 1993, while attending Rutgers University as a senior, Daniel Smith experienced a spiritual reawakening: &quot;This was the year I stopped running away from home, picked up my acoustic guitar again and changed from being Dan back to Daniel. I woke up to the fact that I have an amazing family, an amazing childhood and I began to relate everything I was thinking and doing with this in mind... I began reading the Bible and praying again and songs and art started flowing. I would meet with my dad and talk philosophy and theology and I became a child again.&quot;Smith has cited the major influence his musician father had on him growing up and the importance of lyrical content. Smith began recording songs that would later compose the album &quot;A Prayer for Every Hour&quot;: &quot;some from my solo 4-track, some with my friends Jason Faunce and Missy Forsyth backing and some with my brothers and sisters backing. Danielson became the name of the songs that I write. I had become &quot;Daniel&quot; and realized that I am a son.&quot; He submitted the album as his final thesis (and received an &#x27;A&#x27; grade) and performed, joined by his siblings, at the senior art show. Smith then sent the album out to several indie labels but only received a response from Tooth &amp; Nail in California, who picked up the album and released it in 1994.

Daniel Smith, his siblings, and friend Chris Palladino began to perform in New York City, New Jersey, and Philadelphia as the &quot;Danielson Famile.&quot; The group released &quot;Tri-Danielson!!! (Alpha)&quot; and &quot;Tri-Danielson!!! (Omega)&quot; in 1998 and 1999 respectively, earning them further college radio play and broadening their indie audience. Both LP&#x27;s were recorded and produced by Kramer. The band became known for their onstage costumes (initially nurse uniforms with large red hearts sewn on) as well as their homemade T-shirts and other merchandise. While the lyrical content was unabashedly Christian, Danielson Famile nevertheless received strong press and support from secular audiences due to their musical inventiveness.

Danielson signed to Secretly Canadian Records in 2001 and released &quot;Fetch the Compass Kids&quot;, which was recorded by Steve Albini. Smith then released a solo record in 2004 (&quot;Brother Is to Son&quot;) as Brother Danielson. It was followed in May 2006 by the ambitious &quot;Ships&quot;, which featured contributions from a total of 20 musicians, including Deerhoof, Sufjan Stevens, Why?, Serena Maneesh, and Half-handed Cloud.

The band was chosen by Matt Groening to perform at the edition of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival he curated in May 2010 in Minehead, England.

In 2011, Smith released &quot;Best of Gloucester County&quot;, the first Danielson album released solely through his Sounds Familyre Records label.

In June 2014, Danielson and Jad Fair (of Half Japanese) released a collaborative album &quot;Solid Gold Heart&quot;. The album came about as part of Jad Fair&#x27;s Artist In Residence project with Indianapolis label Joyful Noise Recordings.

Daniel Smith has cited his musical influences as including &quot;T.Rex, Rapeman, B.A.L.L., Syd Barrett, Bob Dylan, Bongwater, My Bloody Valentine, Beat Happening, Cypress Hill, Ween, Donovan, Sonic Youth, Royal Trux, Beatles, Half Japanese, A Tribe Called Quest, [David] Bowie, Can, Pixies, Minutemen, James Brown, Tom Waits, Daniel Johnston, Brian Eno, Larry Norman, Captain Beefheart and more.&quot;

In addition to Danielson&#x27;s music, Smith has recorded and produced albums by Sufjan Stevens, The Welcome Wagon, The Chairman Dances, Half-handed Cloud and others.

<doc id="299485" wikidata="Q1893102" url="?curid=299485" title="Tax deduction">
<text>A tax deduction or benefit is an amount deducted from taxable income, usually based on expenses such as those incurred to produce additional income. Tax deductions are a form of tax incentives, along with exemptions and tax credits. The difference between deductions, exemptions, and credits is that deductions and exemptions both reduce taxable income, while credits reduce tax.

==Above and below the line==
Above and below the line refers to items above or below adjusted gross income, which is item 37 on the tax year 2017 1040 tax form. Tax deductions above the line lessen adjusted gross income, while deductions below the line can only lessen taxable income if the aggregate of those deductions exceeds the standard deduction, which in tax year 2018 in the U.S., for example, was $12,000 for a single taxpayer and $24,000 for married couple.

==Limitations==
Often, deductions are subject to conditions, such as being allowed only for expenses incurred that produce current benefits. Capitalization of items producing future benefit can be required, though with some exceptions. A deduction is allowed, for example, on interest paid on student loans. Some systems allow taxpayer deductions for items the influential parties want to encourage as purchases.

==Business expenses==
Nearly all jurisdictions that tax business income allow deductions for business and trade expenses. Allowances vary and may be general or restricted. To be deducted, the expenses must be incurred in furthering business, and usually only include activities undertaken for profit.

===Cost of goods sold===
Nearly all income tax systems allow a deduction for the cost of goods sold. This may be considered an expense, a reduction of gross income, or merely a component utilized in computing net profits. The manner in which cost of goods sold is determined has several inherent complexities, including various accounting methods. These include:
*Conventions for assigning costs to particular goods sold where specific identification is infeasible.
*Methods for attributing common costs, such as factory burden, to particular goods.
*Methods for determining when costs are recognized in computing cost of goods sold or to be sold.
*Methods for recognizing costs of goods that will not be sold or have declined in value.

===Trading or ordinary and necessary business expenses===
Many systems, including the United Kingdom, levy tax on all chargeable &quot;profits of a trade&quot; computed under local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under this approach, determination of whether an item is deductible depends upon accounting rules and judgments. By contrast, the U.S. allows as a deduction &quot;all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business...&quot; subject to qualifications, enhancements, and limitations. A similar approach is followed by Canada, but generally with fewer special rules. Such an approach poses significant definitional issues. Among the definitional issues often addressed are:
*What constitutes a trade or business? Generally, the business must be regular, continuous, substantial, and entered into with an expectation of profit.
*What expenses are ordinary and necessary? The phrase deals with what expenses are appropriate to the nature of the business, whether the expenses are of the sort expected to help produce income and promote the business, and whether the expenses are not lavish and extravagant.

Note that under this concept, the same sorts of expenses are generally deductible by business entities and individuals carrying on a trade or business. To the extent such expenses relate to the employment of an individual and are not reimbursed by the employer, the amount may be deductible by the individual.

Business deductions of flow-through entities may flow through as a component of the entity&#x27;s net income in some jurisdictions. Deductions of flow-through entities may pass through to members of such entities separately from the net income of the entity in some jurisdictions or some cases. For example, charitable contributions by trusts, and all deductions of partnerships (and S corporations in the U.S.) are deductible by member beneficiaries or partners (or S corporation shareholders) in a manner appropriate to the deduction and the member, such as itemized deductions for charitable contributions or a component of net business profits for business expenses.

===Accounting methods===

One important aspect of determining tax deductions for business expenses is the timing of such deduction. The method used for this is commonly referred to as an accounting method. Accounting methods for tax purposes may differ from applicable GAAP. Examples include timing of recognition of cost recovery deductions (e.g., depreciation), current expensing of otherwise capitalizable costs of intangibles, and rules related to costs that should be treated as part of cost of goods not yet sold. Further, taxpayers often have choices among multiple accounting methods permissible under GAAP and/or tax rules. Examples include conventions for determining which goods have been sold (such as first-in-first-out, average cost, etc.), whether or not to defer minor expenses producing benefit in the immediately succeeding period, etc.

Accounting methods may be defined with some precision by tax law, as in the U.S. system, or may be based on GAAP, as in the UK system.

===Limits on deductions===
Many systems limit particular deductions, even where the expenses directly relate to the business. Such limitations may, by way of example, include:
*Maximum deductions for use of automobiles
*Limits on deducting compensation of certain key employees
*Limits on lobbying or similar expenditures
*Nondeductibility of payments considered in violation of public policy, such as criminal fines
*Limits on deductions for business-related entertainment but no limit in 2021 taxes and beyond.

In addition, deductions in excess of income in one endeavor may not be allowed to offset income from other endeavors. For example, the United States limits deductions related to passive activities to income from passive activities.

In particular, expenses that are included in COGS cannot be deducted again as a business expense. COGS expenses include: 
* The cost of products or raw materials, including freight or shipping charges;
* The cost of storing products the business sells;
* Direct labor costs for workers who produce the products; and
* Factory overhead expenses.

In 2005, the Australian government amended its taxation legislation to remove deductions for expenses incurred in conducting criminal business activities. This came after the Federal Court ruled in &quot;Commissioner of Taxation v La Rosa&quot; that a heroin dealer was entitled to a tax deduction for money stolen from him in a drug deal.

==Capitalized items and cost recovery (depreciation)==
Many systems require that the cost of items likely to produce future benefits be capitalized. Examples include plant and equipment, fees related to acquisition, and developing intangible assets (e.g., patentable inventions). Such systems often allow a tax deduction for cost recovery in a future period.

A common approach to such cost recovery is to allow a deduction for a portion of the cost ratably over some period of years. The U.S. system refers to such a cost recovery deduction as depreciation for costs of tangible assets and as amortization for costs of intangible assets. Depreciation in these systems is allowed over an estimated useful life, which may be assigned by the government for numerous classes of assets, based on the nature and use of the asset and the nature of the business. The annual depreciation deduction may be computed on a straight line, declining balance, or other basis, as permitted in each country&#x27;s rules. Many systems allow amortization of the cost of intangible assets only on a straight-line basis, generally computed monthly over the actual expected life or a government specified life.

Alternative approaches are used by some systems. Some systems allow a fixed percentage or dollar amount of cost recovery in particular years, often called &quot;capital allowances.&quot; This may be determined by reference to the type of asset or business. Some systems allow specific charges for cost recovery for some assets upon certain identifiable events.

Capitalization may be required for some items without the potential for cost recovery until disposition or abandonment of the asset to which the capitalized costs relate. This is often the case for costs related to the formation or reorganization of a corporation, or certain expenses in corporate acquisitions. However, some systems provide for amortization of certain such costs, at the election of the taxpayer.

==Non-business expenses==
Some systems distinguish between an active trade or business and the holding of assets to produce income. In such systems, there may be additional limitations on the timing and nature of amounts that may be claimed as tax deductions. Many of the rules, including accounting methods and limits on deductions, that apply to business expenses also apply to income producing expenses.

===Losses===

Many systems allow a deduction for loss on sale, exchange, or abandonment of both business and non-business income producing assets. This deduction may be limited to gains from the same class of assets. In the U.S., a loss on non-business assets is considered a capital loss, and deduction of the loss is limited to capital gains. Also, in the U.S. a loss on the sale of the taxpayer&#x27;s principal residence or other personal assets is not allowed as a deduction except to the extent due to casualty or theft.

===Personal deductions===
Many jurisdictions allow certain classes of taxpayers to reduce taxable income for certain inherently personal items. A common such deduction is a fixed allowance for the taxpayer and certain family members or other persons supported by the taxpayer. The U.S. allows such a deduction for &quot;personal exemptions&quot; for the taxpayer and certain members of the taxpayer&#x27;s household. The UK grants a &quot;personal allowance.&quot; Both U.S. and UK allowances are phased out for individuals or married couples with income in excess of specified levels.

In addition, many jurisdictions allow reduction of taxable income for certain categories of expenses not incurred in connection with a business or investments. In the U.S. system, these (as well as certain business or investment expenses) are referred to as &quot;itemized deductions&quot; for individuals. The UK allows a few of these as personal reliefs. These include, for example, the following for U.S. residents (and UK residents as noted):
*Medical expenses (in excess of 7.5% of adjusted gross income)
*State and local income and property taxes (the SALT deduction in the United States)
*Interest expense on certain home loans
*Gifts of money or property to qualifying charitable organizations, subject to certain maximum limitations,
*Losses on non-income-producing property due to casualty or theft,
*Contribution to certain retirement or health savings plans (U.S. and UK),
*Certain educational expenses.

Many systems provide that an individual may claim a tax deduction for personal payments that, upon payment, become taxable to another person, such as alimony. Such systems generally require, at a minimum, reporting of such amounts, and may require that withholding tax be applied to the payment.

==Groups of taxpayers==
Some systems allow a deduction to a company or other entity for expenses or losses of another company or entity if the two companies or entities are commonly controlled. Such deduction may be referred to as &quot;group relief.&quot; Generally, such deductions function in lieu of consolidated or combined computation of tax (tax consolidation) for such groups. Group relief may be available for companies in EU member countries with respect to losses of group companies in other countries.

==International aspects==
Many systems impose limitations on tax deductions paid to foreign parties, especially related parties. See International tax and Transfer pricing.

<doc id="299487" wikidata="Q2236725" url="?curid=299487" title="Non compos mentis">
<text>Non compos mentis is a Latin legal phrase that translates to &quot;of unsound mind&quot;: &quot;nōn&quot; (&quot;not&quot;) prefaces &quot;compos mentis&quot;, meaning &quot;having control of one&#x27;s mind.&quot; This phrase was used in English law as early as the seventeenth century to describe people afflicted by madness, the loss of memory or ability to reason.

==Usage==
The status of &quot;non compos mentis&quot; applied to those who were not mad from birth, but became so later in life through no fault of their own. The property and interests of such a person could be committed to another party to conserve and administer them for the duration of their madness. Their criminal culpability was also limited except in cases of high treason. This contrasted with &quot;natural fools&quot; who were mad from birth and whose property interests passed to the crown, and habitual drunkards, who could claim no defense of madness.

== Prosecution of suicide ==
&quot;Non compos mentis&quot; and &quot;felo de se&quot; (the Latin word for &quot;self-murder&quot;) presented two different verdicts in the case of a suicide. In the finding of a jury, the deceased who was stigmatized &quot;felo de se&quot; would be excluded from burial in consecrated ground and would forfeit their estate to the Crown, while these penalties would not apply to the deceased affirmed &quot;non compos mentis&quot;.

Suicide was a severe crime in Tudor and early Stuart England and was considered a form of murder; a sin not only in the eyes of the Church but also defined by criminal law. The state of mind of self-killers at the time they committed their fatal deed was crucial. To be judged guilty of &quot;self-murder&quot;, one had to be sane. Men and women who killed themselves when they were mad or otherwise mentally incompetent were considered innocent. The verdict would be made by a jury. The penalty for suicide in England originated in the ancient world and evolved gradually into their early modern form; similar laws and customs existed in many parts of Europe. Born of domestic beliefs, the ritual of punishing suicide, which is usually concerned with the suicidal corpse, embodies the notion that suicide is polluting, and that the suicide should be ostracized by the community of the living and the dead. The theological and legal severity increased in the High Middle Ages. The medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas extended Augustine&#x27;s arguments against suicide and added the new interpretation of &quot;violation of natural law&quot; to it. Most western European governments began to promulgate laws to confiscate some of a suicide&#x27;s property.

However, attitudes to suicide changed profoundly after 1660, following the English Revolution. After the civil war, political and social changes, judicial and ecclesiastical severity gave way to official leniency for most people who died by suicide. &quot;Non compos mentis&quot; verdicts increased greatly, and &quot;felo de se&quot; verdicts became as rare as &quot;non compos mentis&quot; had been two centuries earlier. However, the laws against suicide and the verdicts &quot;felo de se&quot; and &quot;non compos mentis&quot; did not fade until the late nineteenth century.

<doc id="299489" wikidata="Q744183" url="?curid=299489" title="Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan">
<text>Charles de Batz de Castelmore (), also known as d&#x27;Artagnan and later Count d&#x27;Artagnan ( 1611 – 25 June 1673), was a French Musketeer who served Louis XIV as captain of the Musketeers of the Guard. He died at the siege of Maastricht in the Franco-Dutch War. A fictionalised account of his life by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras formed the basis for the d&#x27;Artagnan Romances of Alexandre Dumas &quot;père&quot;, most famously including &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1844). The heavily fictionalised version of d&#x27;Artagnan featured in Dumas&#x27; works and their subsequent screen adaptations is now far more widely known than the real historical figure.

==Early life==

D&#x27;Artagnan was born at the Château de Castelmore near Lupiac in south-western France. His father, Bertrand de Batz lord of Castelmore, was the son of a newly ennobled merchant, Arnaud de Batz, who purchased the Château de Castelmore. Charles de Batz went to Paris in the 1630s, using the name of his mother Françoise de Montesquiou d&#x27;Artagnan. D&#x27;Artagnan found a way to enter into the Musketeers in 1632 through the support of his uncle, Henri de Montesquiou d&#x27;Artagnan or perhaps thanks to the influence of Henri&#x27;s friend, Monsieur de Tréville. D’Artagnan joined the guards in the mid-1630s and served under Captain des Essarts. The regiment saw much action in the early 1640s, taking part in sieges at Arras, Aire-sur-la-Lys, la Bassée and Bapaume in 1640–41 and Collioure and Perpignan in 1642. Whether or not d’Artagnan was personally involved is unclear, but it is likely he took part in some, if not all, of these sieges. While in the Musketeers, d&#x27;Artagnan sought the protection of the influential Cardinal Mazarin, France&#x27;s principal minister from 1643. In 1646, the Musketeers company was dissolved, but d&#x27;Artagnan continued to serve his protector Mazarin.

==Career==

D&#x27;Artagnan had a career in espionage for Cardinal Mazarin, in the years after the first Fronde. Owing to d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s faithful service during this period, Louis XIV entrusted him with many secret and delicate situations that required complete discretion. He followed Mazarin during his exile in 1651 in the face of the hostility of the aristocracy. In 1652, d&#x27;Artagnan was promoted to lieutenant in the Gardes Françaises, and fought at the Battle of Stenay in 1654, as well as in sieges at Landrecies and Saint-Ghislaine, then to captain in 1655. In 1658, he became a second lieutenant in the newly reformed Musketeers. This was a promotion, as the Musketeers were far more prestigious than the Gardes-Françaises.

D&#x27;Artagnan was famous for his connection with the arrest of Nicolas Fouquet. Fouquet was Louis XIV&#x27;s finance commissioner and aspired to take the place of Mazarin as the king&#x27;s advisor. Fouquet was also a lover of grand architecture and employed the greatest architects and artisans in the building of his Chateau Vaux-le-Vicomte. On 17 August 1661, he celebrated the completion with a most extravagant feast, at which every guest was given a horse. The king, however, felt upstaged by the grandeur of the home and event and, suspecting that such magnificence could only be explained through Fouquet&#x27;s pilfering the royal treasury, three weeks later had d&#x27;Artagnan arrest Fouquet. To prevent his escape by bribery, d&#x27;Artagnan was assigned to guard him for four years until Fouquet was sentenced to life imprisonment.

In 1667, d&#x27;Artagnan was promoted to captain-lieutenant of the Musketeers, the effective commander as the nominal captain was the king. As befitted his rank and position, he could be identified by his striking burgundy, white, and black livery—the colours of the commanding officer of the Musketeers. Another of d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s assignments was the governorship of Lille, which was won in battle by France in 1667. D&#x27;Artagnan was an unpopular governor and longed to return to battle. He found his chance when Louis XIV went to war with the Dutch Republic in the Franco-Dutch War. After being recalled to service, d&#x27;Artagnan was killed in battle on 25 June 1673, when a musket ball tore into his throat at the siege of Maastricht.

The French historian Odile Bordaz believes that he was buried in Saint Peter and Paul Church in Wolder, a district of Maastricht, the Netherlands. Wolder was Louis XIV&#x27;s headquarters during the Maastricht siege and he attended mass in the local church every day. In contrast, the archaeologist Wim Dijkman, curator of the historical collections of the city of Maastricht at Centre Céramique, says that there is no historical or archaeological evidence for the claim.

==Marriage and descendants==
On 5 March 1659, D&#x27;Artagnan married Anne-Charlotte Boyer de Chanlecy (1624–1683), lady of Sainte-Croix, and widow of Jean-Elenor de Damas. She was the daughter of Charles Boyer, lord of Chanlecy and Sainte-Croix, and Claude de Rymon, lady of la Rochette.

==Portrayals in fiction==

The real d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s life was used as the basis for Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras&#x27; novel &quot;Les mémoires de M. d&#x27;Artagnan&quot;. Alexandre Dumas in turn used Sandras&#x27; novel as the main source for his d&#x27;Artagnan Romances (&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, &quot;Twenty Years After&quot; and &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot;), which cover d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s career from his humble beginnings in Gascony to his death at Maastricht. Although Dumas knew that Sandras&#x27;s version was heavily fictionalised, in the preface to &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; he affected to believe that the memoirs were real, in order to make his novel more believable.

D&#x27;Artagnan is initially portrayed by Dumas as a hotheaded youth, who tries to engage the Comte de Rochefort and the three musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis in single combat. He quickly becomes friends with the musketeers, and has a series of adventures which put him at odds with Cardinal Richelieu, then First Minister of France. In the end, Richelieu is impressed by d&#x27;Artagnan, and makes him a lieutenant of the musketeers. This begins his long career of military service, as detailed in the sequels.

D&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s role among the musketeers is one of leadership (his skills and brains impress the musketeers greatly), but he is also regarded as a sort of protégé given his youth and inexperience. Athos sees him not only as a best friend and fellow musketeer but nearly as a son. At the end of the series, his death at the siege of Maastricht is given an extra tragic twist—he is mortally wounded while reading the notice of his promotion to the highest military rank.

Some scholars believe aspects of D&#x27;Artagnan are drawn from the life and character of Dumas&#x27;s mixed-race father, General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas. The incident when D&#x27;Artagnan challenges Porthos, Athos, and Aramis to duels on the same afternoon might be based on an incident in General Dumas&#x27;s youth when he was insulted; and their subsequent friendship on General Dumas&#x27;s youthful companionship with fellow soldiers in the Queen&#x27;s Dragoons.

<text>Irréversible () is a 2002 French art thriller film written and directed by Gaspar Noé. Starring Monica Bellucci, Vincent Cassel, Albert Dupontel, the plot depicts the events of a tragic night in Paris as two men attempt to avenge the brutal rape and beating of the woman they love. The film is made up of a title sequence followed by 13 segments made to look like long takes. Each of these segments is either a continuous shot or a series of shots digitally composited to resemble a continuous shot. The story is told in reverse order, with each scene taking place chronologically before the one that precedes it.

Theatrically released in France, the United Kingdom and the United States, &quot;Irréversible&quot; competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and won the Bronze Horse at the Stockholm International Film Festival. Critical reception was mixed, with praise towards the performances and Noé&#x27;s direction, but criticism towards its graphic portrayal of violence and rape. American film critic Roger Ebert called &quot;Irréversible&quot; &quot;a movie so violent and cruel that most people will find it unwatchable&quot;. A version of the film told in chronological order, &quot;Irreversible: Straight Cut&quot; (), was released in 2020.

==Plot==


Alex and Marcus, a young couple, wake up together and discuss their relationship, as well as an upcoming party, while in the nude. Alex reveals she had a dream of herself standing in a red tunnel that breaks in two, before taking a pregnancy test that reveals a positive result. On a public train, Pierre, Alex&#x27;s ex who is also invited to the party, constantly bickers with Alex over his inability to satisfy her during their relationship, while Marcus shows no interest in their squabble. At the party, Marcus gets drunk and takes cocaine, much to Alex&#x27;s displeasure. She leaves the party, asking Pierre to look after Marcus. Alex descends into a red pedestrian underpass on her way back to the train when she notices a transgender prostitute getting attacked by a man. He immediately turns his attention to Alex, anally raping her before savagely beating her into unconsciousness.

After Marcus and Pierre discover Alex being taken away by paramedics, they encounter street criminals Mourad and Layde, who offer to help them find the culprit. They use an ID left at the scene by the prostitute to locate her. Marcus verbally assaults Concha, the prostitute, and threatens to cut her face open in order to gather that the rapist&#x27;s name is Le Ténia (&quot;the tapeworm&quot;) and that he frequents a gay BDSM club called Rectum. The men are chased off by other prostitutes; Marcus and Pierre jump into a taxi cab and speed off into the night. When the cab driver doesn&#x27;t know where Rectum is, Marcus attacks the driver, stealing his vehicle. The two end up finding Rectum, with Pierre reluctantly following behind Marcus. Leading the charge, Marcus proceeds to get into a fight with a man he suspects of being Le Ténia, who ends up breaking his arm before attempting to rape him. Pierre comes to his rescue and beats the man to death with a nearby fire extinguisher as the man&#x27;s companion, the actual rapist, watches in amusement. Marcus is carried out of Rectum on a stretcher while Pierre is arrested by police.

Meanwhile, in a nearby small apartment, a man named the Butcher, the lead character of &quot;I Stand Alone&quot;, tells a friend that he was arrested for raping his daughter before dismissing the commotion going on outside.

==Cast==
Director Gaspar Noé has a cameo as one of the patrons in the Rectum.

==Production==
&quot;Irréversible&quot; was originally titled as &quot;Danger&quot;. Gaspar Noé first found financing for the new title after he pitched the story to be told in reverse, in order to capitalize on the popularity of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film &quot;Memento&quot; (2000).

&quot;Irréversible&quot; was shot using a widescreen lightweight Minima Super16 mm camera. The film consists of about a dozen apparently unbroken shots melded together from hundreds of shots. This included the infamous nine-minute-long rape scene, portrayed in a single, unbroken shot. Noé said he had no idea how long the rape scene was going to last, as this was determined by Monica Bellucci, who essentially directed the scene, and Jo Prestia, who played her assailant. Noé stated in interviews that during the production of the film he used cocaine in order to help him carry the large cameras needed to capture the rotating shots in the film.

Computer-generated imagery was used in post-production for the penis in the rape scene. Another example is the scene where Pierre beats a man&#x27;s face and crushes his skull with a fire extinguisher. CGI was used to augment the results, as initial footage using a conventional latex dummy proved unconvincing. During the first thirty minutes of its running time, the film uses an extremely low-frequency sound of 27 Hz to create a state of nausea and anxiety in the audience, as it is not immediately perceptible to the spectator, but enough to evoke a physical response. Quoting Noé, &quot;You can&#x27;t hear them, but they make you shiver. In a good cinema with a good audio system, the sound can scare you much more than what&#x27;s happening on the screen.&quot; This technique, called Sensurround, involves the intentional use of a sub-audible sound to enhance the spectator&#x27;s experience of a movie, in this case, deliberately making them uncomfortable (although this would only be experienced in a cinema setting as most home speakers would not emit such low frequencies).

==Release==

The film premiered in France on 22 May 2002 through Mars Distribution. It competed at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. It was released in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2003 through Metro Tartan Distribution, and the United States on 7 March 2003 through Lions Gate Films. It grossed $792,200 from theatrical screenings.

&quot;Irreversible: Straight Cut&quot; () first screened at the 2019 Venice International Film Festival after Noe decided to give this version of the film a wider release instead of relegating it to a home release special feature. It was released in Los Angeles and New York City on 10 February 2023.

==Reception and legacy==
Critical response to the film was divided, with some critics panning the film and others considering it one of the year&#x27;s best. The film holds an approval rating of 59% based on 126 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.10/10. The website&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus states: &quot;Though well-filmed, &quot;Irréversible&quot; feels gratuitous in its extreme violence.&quot; The film received three votes in the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of the greatest films and in 2016 was listed by critic Andreas Borcholte as one of the ten best films since 2000.

Audience reactions to both the rape scene and the murder scene have ranged from appreciation of their artistic merits to leaving the theater in disgust. &quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s David Ansen stated that &quot;If outraged viewers (mostly women) at the Cannes Film Festival are any indication, this will be the most walked-out-of movie of 2003.&quot; In the same review, Ansen suggested that the film displayed &quot;an adolescent pride in its own ugliness&quot;.

American film critic Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film three stars out of a possible four. Ebert declared many viewers would find the film unwatchable due to the graphic violence, but he also proposed the film&#x27;s structure makes it inherently moral rather than an exploitation film: &quot;By placing the ugliness at the beginning, Gaspar Noe forces us to think seriously about the sexual violence involved.&quot;

Film critic David Edelstein argued &quot;&quot;Irréversible&quot; might be the most homophobic movie ever made.&quot; Noé&#x27;s depiction of gay criminal Le Tenia raping the female lead, Alex, remains the film&#x27;s most controversial image. In his defense, Noé stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not homophobic&quot;, noting &quot;I also appear in &quot;Irréversible&quot;, masturbating at the gay club&quot;, as a means of showing &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel superior to gay people&quot;.

&quot;Irréversible&quot; has been associated with a series of films defined as the &quot;cinéma du corps&quot; (&quot;cinema of the body&quot;), which according to Palmer includes: an attenuated use of narrative, assaulting and often illegible cinematography, confrontational subject material, and a pervasive sense of social nihilism or despair. &quot;Irréversible&quot; has also been associated with the New French Extremity movement.

In 2019, &quot;Irreversible: Straight Cut&quot; premiered at the Venice Film Festival, an alternate and remastered edit of the film presented in chronological order. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 90% approval rating with an average rating of 6.80/10 out of 10 critics.

==Accolades==
&quot;Irréversible&quot; won the top award, the Bronze Horse for best film, at the 2002 Stockholm International Film Festival. It was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Award by the Film Critics Circle of Australia. It was voted Best Foreign Language Film by the San Diego Film Critics Society, tied with &quot;The Barbarian Invasions (Les Invasions barbares)&quot;.

<text>A tax credit is a tax incentive which allows certain taxpayers to subtract the amount of the credit they have accrued from the total they owe the state. It may also be a credit granted in recognition of taxes already paid or a form of state &quot;discount&quot; applied in certain cases. Another way to think of a tax credit is as a rebate.

== Refundable vs. non-refundable ==
A refundable tax credit is one which, if the credit exceeds the taxes due, the government pays back to the taxpayer the difference. In other words, it makes possible a negative tax liability. For example, if a taxpayer has an initial tax liability of $100 and applies a $300 tax credit, then the taxpayer ends with a liability of –$200 and the government refunds to the taxpayer that $200.

With a non-refundable tax credit, if the credit exceeds the taxes due then the taxpayer pays nothing but does not receive the difference. In this case, the taxpayer from the example would end with a tax liability of $0 (i.e. they could make use of only $100 of the $300 credit) and the government would &quot;not&quot; refund the taxpayer the $200 difference.

== Credit for payments ==
Many systems refer to taxes paid indirectly, such as taxes withheld by payers of income, as credits rather than prepayments. In such cases, the tax credit is invariably refundable. The most common forms of such amounts are payroll withholding of income tax or PAYE, withholding of tax at source on payments to nonresidents, and input credits for value added tax.

== Individual income tax credits ==
Income tax systems often grant a variety of credits to individuals. These typically include credits available to all taxpayers as well as tax credits unique to individuals. Some credits may be offered for a single year only.

=== Low income subsidies ===
Several income tax systems provide income subsidies to lower income individuals by way of credit. These credits may be based on income, family status, work status, or other factors. Often such credits are refundable when total credits exceed tax liability.

In the United Kingdom, the Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit were paid directly into the claimant&#x27;s bank account or Post Office Card Account. In exceptional circumstances, these can be paid by cashcheque (sometimes called giro). However, payments may stop if account details are not provided. A minimum level of Child Tax Credits is payable to all individuals or couples with children, up to a certain income limit. The actual amount of Child Tax Credits that a person may receive depended on these factors: the level of their income, the number of children they have, whether the children are receiving Disability Living Allowance and the education status of any children over sixteen years of age. Since 2018, Child Tax Credit has been replaced by Universal Credit for most people.

Working Tax Credit is paid to single low earners with or without children who are aged 25 or over and are working over 30 hours per week and also to couples without children, at least one of whom is over 25, provided that at least one of them is working for 30 hours a week. If the claimant has children they could claim Working Tax Credit from age sixteen and up, provided that they are working at least sixteen hours per week. It is being replaced by Universal Credit.

Tax Credits were capped which many sources claimed affects the poorest families disproportionately. A survey by End Child Poverty estimated that roughly 1.5 million parents have reduced spending on basics like food and fuel. According to Gavin Kelly of the Resolution Foundation, tax credits help raise living standards of low paid workers. He wrote in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;Perhaps the biggest misconception is the voguish notion that if tax credits are cut, employers will somehow decide to offer pay rises to fill the gap. This is saloon-bar economics espoused by some on both left and right.&quot;

On 15 September 2015, the House of Commons voted&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC15/09/2015&quot;&gt;&quot;Commons back Osborne plan for tax credit cuts&quot;. &quot;BBC News&quot;, 15 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; to decrease Tax Credit thresholds, a law that came into effect on 6 April 2016. Opponents claimed that it would harm those on low incomes. Simon Hopkins, Chief Executive of charity Turn2us commented &quot;Today&#x27;s vote in the House of Commons will mean one thing for many of the poorest working families in the UK; they are going to get poorer. Tax credits are a vital source of income for those on a low wage and for many they make up a substantial portion of their monthly income.&quot;

The IFS supported the opposition view that the effects of the changes would disproportionately reduce the income of poor families, even taking into account reductions in income tax and an increase in the National Living Wage. The government responded that the tax credit system had, for too long, been used to subsidise low pay and the changes would bring total expenditure on tax credits back down to more sustainable levels seen in 2007–08.

On 26 October 2015 the House of Lords supported a motion from Baroness Meacher delaying the imposition of the cuts until a new consideration of the effects could be made by the House of Commons.

==== United States ====

The U.S. system grants the following low income tax credits:
*Earned income credit: this refundable credit is granted for a percentage of income earned by a low income individual. The credit is calculated and capped based on the number of qualifying children, if any. This credit is indexed for inflation and phased out for incomes above a certain amount. For 2016, the maximum credit was $6,269 for taxpayers with three or more qualifying children.
*Credit for the elderly and disabled: a nonrefundable credit of $3,750 to $7,500 as of 2025.
*Retirement savings contribution credit: a nonrefundable credit of up to 50% for up to $2000 of contributions to qualified retirement savings plans, such as IRAs (including the Roth, SEP and IRA), 401(k)/403(b)/457 plans and the Thrift Savings Plan; phased out starting (for the 2014 tax year) at incomes above $18,000 for single returns, $27,000 for heads of household, and $36,000 for joint returns.
*Mortgage interest credit: a nonrefundable credit that may be limited to $2,000, granted under specific mortgage programs.
*Premium tax credit: this refundable credit is provided to individuals and families who obtain healthcare insurance policies through a healthcare exchange, and whose income falls between 100% and 400% of the applicable federal poverty line. It was first introduced in the 2014 tax year.

==== Canada ====
There are several different types of income tax credits offered in Canada:

* Canada Child Benefit: A tax-free monthly payment for families raising children under 18.
* Canada Caregiver Credit: A non-refundable credit for supporting a spouse, common-law partner, or dependant with a physical or mental impairment.
* Canada Workers Benefit: A refundable credit for low-income workers.
* Disability Tax Credit: A non-refundable tax credit that helps people with disabilities, or their supporting family member, reduce the amount of income tax they may have to pay.
* Canada Training Credit: A refundable tax credit available to help Canadians with the cost of eligible training fees.
* Home Accessibility Tax Credit: A non-refundable tax credit to help with the cost of making a person&#x27;s home accessible.
* Medical Expense Tax Credit: A non-refundable tax credit that a person can claim for themselves, their spouse or common-law partner, or other dependants, including their children or their spouse&#x27;s or common law&#x27;s children.

=== Family relief ===
Some systems grant tax credits for families with children. These credits may be on a per child basis or as a credit for child care expenses.

The U.S. system offers the following nonrefundable family related income tax credits (in addition to a tax deduction for each dependent child):
*Child credit: Parents of children who are under age 17 at the end of the tax year may qualify for a credit up to $1,000 per qualifying child. The credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of tax liability, and may be listed on Line 51 of Form 1040. For every $1,000 of adjusted gross income above the threshold limit ($110,000 for married joint filers; $75,000 for single filers), the amount of the credit decreases by $50.
*Child and dependent care credit: Taxpayers may claim a credit up to $3,000 of eligible expenses for dependent care for a child under age 13 in order to pursue or maintain gainful employment. If one parent stays home full-time, however, no child care costs are eligible for the credit.
*Credit for adoption expenses: a credit up to $10,000, phased out at higher incomes. Taxpayers who have incurred qualified adoption expenses in 2011 may claim either a $13,360 credit against tax owed or a $13,360 income exclusion if the taxpayer has received payments or reimbursements from their employer for adoption expenses. For 2012, the amount of the credit will decrease to $12,650, and in 2013 to $5,000. The adoption tax credit encompasses eligible expenses associated with adopting a child, including:
** Reasonable adoption fees
** Costs pertaining to adoption attorneys or court fees
** Qualifying travel expenses, such as meals and lodging incurred during adoption-related travel
** Other eligible expenses directly tied to the legal adoption process.

=== Education, energy and other subsidies ===
Some systems indirectly subsidize education and similar expenses through tax credits.

The U.S. system has the following nonrefundable credits:
*Two mutually exclusive credits for qualified tuition and related expenses. The American Opportunity Tax Credit is 100% of the first $2,000 and 25% of the next $4000 of qualified tuition expenses per year for up to two years. The Lifetime Learning Credit is 20% of the first $10,000 of cumulative expenses. These credits are phased out at incomes above $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns) in 2009. Expenses for which a credit is claimed are not eligible for tax deduction.
*First time homebuyers credit up to $7,500 (closing date before Sept. 30, 2010).
*Credits for purchase of certain nonbusiness energy property and residential energy efficiency. Several credits apply with differing rules.

== Business tax credits ==
Many systems offer various incentives for businesses to make investments in property or operate in particular areas. Credits may be offered against income or property taxes, and are generally nonrefundable to the extent they exceed taxes otherwise due. The credits may be offered to individuals as well as entities. The nature of the credits available varies highly by jurisdiction.

=== United States ===
U.S. income tax has numerous nonrefundable business credits. In most cases, any amount of these credits in excess of current year tax may be carried forward to offset future taxes, with limitations. The credits include the following (for a full list see section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code):
*Alternative motor vehicle credit: several credits are available for purchase of varying types of non-gasoline powered vehicles.
*Alternative fuel credits: a credit based on the amount of production of certain non-petroleum fuels.
*Disaster relief credits
*Credits for employing individuals in certain areas or those formerly on welfare or in targeted groups
*Credit for Increasing Research Activities
*A variety of industry specific credits

Many sub-Federal jurisdictions (states, counties, cities, etc.) within the U.S. offer income or property tax credits for particular activities or expenditures. Examples include credits similar to the Federal research and employment credits, property tax credits, (often called abatements), granted by cities for building facilities within the city, etc. These items often are negotiated between a business and a governmental body, and specific to a particular business and property.

==== Federal nonrefundable investment tax credits ====

Tax credits, while they come in many forms, are authorized incentives under the Internal Revenue Code (and some state tax codes) to implement public policy. Congress, in an effort to encourage the private sector to provide a public benefit, allows a participating taxpayer a dollar for dollar reduction of their tax liability for investments in projects that probably would not occur but for the credits.

==== Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit ====

The legislative incentive program to encourage the preservation of &quot;historical buildings&quot;. Congress instituted a two-tier Tax Credit incentive under the Tax Reform Act of 1986. A 20% credit is available for the rehabilitation of historical buildings and a 10% credit is available for non-historic buildings, which were first placed in service before 1936. Benefits are derived from tax credits in the year the property is placed in service, cash flow over 6 years and repurchase options in year six.

==== Renewable Energy/Investment Tax Credit (ITC) ====
The investment tax credit is allowed section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code. This investment tax credit varies depending on the type of renewable energy project; solar, fuel cells ($1500/0.5 kW) and small wind (&lt; 100 kW) are eligible for credit of 30% of the cost of development, with no maximum credit limit; there is a 10% credit for geothermal, microturbines (&lt; 2 MW) and combined heat and power plants (&lt; 50 MW). The ITC is generated at the time the qualifying facility is placed in service. Benefits are derived from the ITC, accelerated depreciation, and cash flow over a 6-8 year period.

Though set to expire at the end of 2015, the ITC for residential solar installations was renewed in December 2015. The credit will continue at 30% through 2018, and will slowly decline to 10% in 2022. The ITC for other technologies (including geothermal) was extended by one year. Installations will be considered eligible for the ITC based on the date that construction starts.

=====Renewable Energy/Production Tax Credit (PTC)=====

Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code allows an income tax credit of 2.3 cents/kilowatt-hour (as adjusted for inflation for 2013) for the production of electricity from utility-scale wind turbines, geothermal, solar, hydropower, biomass and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy plants. This incentive, the renewable energy Production Tax Credit (PTC), was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (at the value of 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour, which has since been adjusted annually for inflation). In late 2015 a large majority in Congress voted to extend the PTC for wind and solar power for 5 years and $25 billion. Analysts expect $35 billion of investment for each type.

=====Low Income (Affordable) Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)=====
Under this program, created in the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the U.S. Treasury Department allocates tax credits to each state based on that states population. These credits are then awarded to developers who, together with an equity partner, develop and maintain apartments as affordable units. Benefits are derived primarily from the tax credits over a 10-year period.

=====Qualified School Construction Bond (QSCB)=====
QSCBs are U.S. debt instruments used to help schools borrow at nominal rates for the rehabilitation, repair and equipping of their facilities, as well as the purchase of land upon which a public school will be built. A QSCB holder receives a Federal tax credit in lieu of an interest payment. The tax credits may be stripped from QSCB bonds and sold separately. QSCBs were created by Section 1521 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Internal Revenue Code Section 54F also addresses QSCBs.

==== Research &amp; Development Tax Credit ====
The Credit For Increasing Research Activities (R&amp;D Tax Credit) is a general business tax credit under Internal Revenue Code Section 41 for companies that incur research and development (R&amp;D) costs in the United States. For most companies, this credit is worth 7–10% of qualified research expenses each year. It can be used to offset income or payroll taxes, depending on the situation.

==== Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) ====
The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a federal tax credit providing incentives to employers for hiring groups facing high rates of unemployment, such as veterans, youths and others. WOTC helps these targeted groups obtain employment so they are able to gain the skills and experience necessary to obtain better future job opportunities. The WOTC is based on the number of hours an employee works and benefits the employer directly.

The WOTC was established by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. The WOTC replaced the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC), which was created by the Revenue Act of 1978 and was in place from 1978 to 1994. In December 2014, the WOTC was extended retroactively to the beginning of 2014 by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (TIPA), P.L. 113–295. That act authorized the credit only through December 31, 2014. Later, through the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act), Congress modified and extended the WOTC through December 31, 2019.

==== American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) ====
The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was signed into law in February 2009. The AOTC replaced the Hope Scholarship credit for Tax Years 2009 and 2010, increased the benefits for nearly all Hope credit recipients and many other students by providing a maximum benefit up to $2,500 per student, 100 percent of their first $2,000 in tuition and 25 percent of the next $2,000, expanding the income range over which taxpayers can claim a credit, and making the credit partially refundable. Critics have complained that complexity and restrictions on eligibility make the actual benefits per post-secondary student much lower than the theoretical maximum, and that even with tax credits, higher education remains tax-disadvantaged compared to other investments.

==== State tax credits ====
Approximately 43 states provide a variety of special incentive programs that utilize state tax credits. These include Brownfield credits, Film Production credits, Renewable energy credits, Historic Preservation credits and others. The amount of credit, the term of credit and the cost of the credit differs from state to state. These credits can be either in the form of a certificate, which can be purchased as an asset, or in a more traditional pass through entity. The tax credits can generally be used against insurance company premium tax, bank tax and income tax.

=====Oregon Residential Energy Tax Credit (RETC)=====
The state of Oregon&#x27;s RETC is a tax credit for solar systems. In 2016, Oregon Governor Kate Brown released a new budget proposal that does not extend the RETC program. In 2015, RETC gave $12.2 million in tax credits; in 2014, that amount was approximately $4.2 million. Under the budget proposal, the credit will sunset at the end of 2017. Extension of the tax credit is a top priority for Oregon&#x27;s solar industry.

== Value added tax ==
Resellers or producers of goods or providers of services (collectively, providers) must collect value added tax (VAT) in some jurisdictions upon billing or being paid by customers. Where these providers use goods or services provided by others, they may have paid VAT to other providers. Most VAT systems allow the amount of such VAT paid or considered paid to be used to offset VAT payments due, generally referred to as an input credit. Some systems allow the excess of input credits over VAT obligations to be refunded after a period of time.

== Foreign tax credit ==

Income tax systems that impose tax on residents on their worldwide income tend to grant a foreign tax credit for foreign income taxes paid on the same income. The credit often is limited based on the amount of foreign income. The credit may be granted under domestic law and/or tax treaty. The credit is generally granted to individuals and entities, and is generally nonrefundable.

== Credits for alternative tax bases ==
Several tax systems impose a regular income tax and, where higher, an alternative tax. The U.S. imposes an alternative minimum tax based on an alternative measure of taxable income. Mexico imposes an IETU based on an alternative measure of taxable income. Italy imposes an alternative tax based on assets. In each case, where the alternative tax is higher than the regular tax, a credit is allowed against future regular tax for the excess. The credit is usually limited in a manner that prevents circularity in the calculation.

<doc id="299494" wikidata="Q564824" url="?curid=299494" title="Constitution of East Germany">
<text>The original Constitution of East Germany (the German Democratic Republic; ) was promulgated on 7 October 1949. It was heavily based on the Weimar Constitution () and nominally established the GDR as a liberal democratic republic. In 1968, the East German government adopted a new, fully Communist constitution that was based on Marxism–Leninism, political unitarism, and collective leadership. There were further amendments to the 1968 constitution in 1974. With the political events of 1989, there were attempts to draft a new constitution for East Germany, but these efforts never materialized due to the dissolution of East Germany and the accession of its states into the neighboring Federal Republic.

==Background==

In 1947 the German People&#x27;s Congress met in Berlin. The People&#x27;s Congress was meant to be an alternative to the Western London Conference of Foreign Ministers taking place at the same time. The People&#x27;s Congress&#x27; aim was to establish an assembly which would represent the entire German nation and determine the nation&#x27;s political future and prevent the division of post-war Germany. In all there were 2215 delegates sent to the congress (664 of whom represented Germans in zones occupied by the Western Powers). The second Congress, which had by this point been outlawed in Western occupied zones, met a year later and elected a Council (Volksrat). This council would seek to serve as an assembly representing the entire country, irrespective of occupying nation. This assembly designated a committee whose task it was to develop a constitution. Future Minister-President Otto Grotewohl was the chairman of this committee. An election was held in May 1949 to designate a People&#x27;s Council. The German People&#x27;s Congress met for a third time in 1949 and accepted the drafted constitution. The People&#x27;s Council then became the People&#x27;s Chamber of the East German Republic, and the Peoples&#x27; Congress was reformed into the National Front political bloc.

==1949 constitution==

===Fundamentals of State Authority===

The constitution begins by declaring the indivisibility of the German people as a nationality, and primacy of the states () in politics. The federal government is to be limited in its authority to issues which affect the whole of the nation, all other affairs falling to the states. Berlin is declared as the capital of the Republic.

The people are declared as the true source of political authority. Citizens therefore have the right to engage in political life at the local, county, and national level. This participation includes the right to vote in elections, referendums, and initiatives. Citizens also have the right to stand for election, and have the right to enter into public life whether it be political office or in the administration of justice. Citizens also have the right to petition the government.

Due to the authority emanating from the people, the constitution states the government must serve the common welfare of the people. This includes their personal liberty, providing for the general peace, and protecting democracy. Those people who are elected to office are ultimately responsible to their representative body and not to their individual party.

The constitution of the Republic is declared as the basis for all governmental action and the government must abide by its principles. The people have the right to resist any action which takes place outside of these principles. The people of the Republic and the government are also subject to international laws and statutes.

===The Rights of the Citizen===

The second section of the constitution deals with the rights of citizens. All citizens are declared equal before the law. However a citizen convicted of a felony is disqualified from certain rights and privileges, including the right to vote and hold public office. Gender equality is enshrined and any law which limits the equality of women is abolished.

Citizens have the right to personal liberty, privacy of the home and of the mail, and the right to live where they choose. Citizens have the right to freedom of expression within constitutionally applicable laws. This includes the freedom to assemble peacefully and unarmed. No person shall have these freedoms infringed based on their employment.

The constitution declares the freedom of the press from censorship. No citizen may be extradited, nor can non-citizens be extradited provided they are engaged in struggle similar in principle to the constitution. Citizens have the right to emigrate, and any changes to this law must be applicable to the whole nation and not on an individual basis. People have the right to free ethnic education and development.

===Organization of State Authority===
====Popular Representative Body====

Supreme governmental authority is vested in the Volkskammer. The members of the Volkskammer are the representatives of the German people and are to be elected in universal, equal, direct elections on a secret ballot. The term for these representatives is four years, and seats will be allocated according to proportional representation. The size of the Volkskammer is to be 400 members. Freedom of the ballot and secrecy of the ballot are guaranteed.

All citizens over 18 years of age are eligible to vote and citizens over 21 years of age are permitted to stand for election.

The President will convene the assembly no later than 30 days after an election. Elections must take place no later than 60 days after a legislative term. In order for the assembly to dissolve (of its own power) more than half of the assembly must consent.

The Volkskammer will elect a Presidium. The Presidium will stay in office until the next legislative section. When the assembly is not in session 3 committees are to be elected to maintain government functioning, the Committee of General Affairs, the Committee of Economic and Financial affairs, and the Committee of Foreign Affairs.

A quorum consists of at least half members being present. Unless the constitution says otherwise legislation will be adopted by majority vote.

The deliberations of the assembly are open to the public unless two thirds of the assembly request an exclusion.

The functions of the Volkskammer are:
*Determine the principles of policy, and the implementation of policy
*The confirmation, supervision, and ability to recall parliament
*Determine administrative policies and the ultimate supervision of government agencies
*Legislate, except in the event of referendums
*Control of the Republic&#x27;s finances, including the national budget, economic planning, loans and credit of the government, and ratifying treaties
*Granting amnesty
*Electing the President of the Republic (along with the Länderkammer), the election and recall of the members of the Supreme Court and the Prosecutor General

The Volkskammer will also convene a Constitutional Committee. This committee will represent all political parties (proportional membership of the committee corresponding to the composition of the Volkskammer), three members of the Supreme Court, three German professors of constitutional law who are not also members of the Volkskammer. The Constitutional Committee is the only authority which is allowed to review the constitutionality of legislation. If half of members of the assembly question the constitutionality of a law it can be reviewed. The Volkskammer confirms any decision of the Constitutional Committee.

====States====

The states will be represented in a legislative chamber known as the Chamber of States (). Each Laender will be represented by at least one member and there will be one representative for every five hundred thousand inhabitants. These representatives will be elected by the legislatures of the states (). This will be done proportionally to the strength of the political parties represented within these legislatures. These representatives will be drawn from the members of these Laender parliaments, their terms will correspond to the terms of the parliaments. The members shall represent the wishes of their respective Laendar but will follow freely their own conscience.

The chamber will elect a Presidium, consisting of the President, the deputies, and associate members. The President shall convene the chamber whenever it is necessary, or when one fifth of the members wish to.

The meetings of the chamber will be open to the public, certain agenda topics may necessitate exclusion of the public. All decisions will be decided by majority vote, unless the constitution declares otherwise.

The Länderkammer may introduce legislation to the Volkskammer and may reject legislation from the Volkskammer. The Volkskammer and Länderkammer may present their opinion to the other chamber.

==1968 constitution==
At the Seventh Party Congress of the SED in April 1967, Ulbricht called for a new constitution, declaring that the existing constitution no longer accorded &quot;with the relations of socialist society and the present level of historical development&quot;. A new constitution was needed to conform with the Marxist–Leninist belief in the progression of history and the role of the working class led by the SED. The new constitution would also reflect the role of the state as the party&#x27;s main instrument in achieving the goal of a socialist and eventually communist society. A commission in the Volkskammer was tasked in December 1967 to draft a new constitution. Two months later the commission produced a document, which, after &quot;public debate&quot;, was submitted to a plebiscite on April 6, 1968. Approved by a 94.5 percent margin, the new Constitution went into effect three days later on 9 April 1968.

While the 1949 constitution was at least superficially a liberal democratic document, the 1968 constitution was a fully Communist document. Modeled closely on the 1936 Soviet Constitution, it integrated all the constitutional changes that had taken place since 1949 into a new &quot;socialist&quot; framework, but it reduced certain rights provided in the earlier version. Article 1 of the 1968 constitution began with the words, &quot;The German Democratic Republic is a socialist state of the German nation. It is the political organization of the workers in the cities and in the countryside, who jointly under the leadership of the working class and their Marxist-Leninist party will realize Socialism.&quot;

While the old document made no mention of the SED, Article 1 of the new constitution unequivocally declared that &quot;the leadership of the state is to be exercised through the working class and its Marxist-Leninist party&quot;—the SED. The 1949 constitution had declared Germany a &quot;democratic republic&quot;, whereas the new one described East Germany as a &quot;socialist state of the German nation&quot;. Under the old constitution, power derived from &quot;the people&quot;, while Article 2 of the new Constitution stated that power emanated from &quot;the worker in city and country&quot;.

Significant changes introduced into the 1968 document included:

* Article 6, which committed the state to adhere to the &quot;principles of socialist internationalism&quot; and to devote special attention to its &quot;fraternal ties&quot; with the Soviet Union
* Article 9, which based the national economy on the &quot;socialist ownership of the means of production&quot;
* Article 20, which granted freedom of conscience and belief
* Article 21, which maintained that the &quot;basic rights&quot; of citizenship were inseparably linked with &quot;corresponding obligations&quot;
* Article 47, which declared that the principle of &quot;democratic centralism&quot; is the authoritative maxim for the construction of the socialist state

The 1968 document effectively codified the actual state of affairs that had prevailed in the GDR for two decades. It was one of Ulbricht&#x27;s last significant victories before his ouster in 1971.

==1974 amendments==

For the first two decades of its existence, the GDR maintained that it was the sole lawful government of all of Germany, denouncing the Federal Republic as an unlawfully constituted NATO puppet state. In the early 1970s, following the rise of Erich Honecker and increased international recognition of the GDR, the SED abandoned reunification in favor of detente. The regime pursued a policy of &quot;Abgrenzung,&quot; or delimitation. The desired effect was to create a separate GDR national identity. 

As a result, the 1968 constitution was amended by the Volkskammer on 27 September 1974 to delete the reference to the German nation; indeed, the use of the word &quot;German&quot; was cut back almost to a bare minimum. The amended document increased the emphasis on solidarity and friendship with the Soviet Union. In practice, however, ties between East Germans and their West German countrymen increased, in part due to the policies of Ostpolitik and détente followed by both East and West during the 1970s.

Article 1 of the amended constitution began with the words, &quot;The German Democratic Republic is a socialist state of workers and farmers. It is the political organization of the workers in the cities and in the countryside under the leadership of the working class and their Marxist-Leninist party.&quot;

==1989–90 proposals==
In the wake of the Peaceful Revolution and the fall of the Berlin Wall, the constitution was significantly revised in November 1989 to prune out its Communist character. Most notably, Article 1, which effectively gave the SED a monopoly of power, was deleted.

In April 1990, the democratic forum &quot;Runder Tisch&quot; (Round Table) developed a proposal for a new GDR constitution to reflect the democratic changes that swept across the GDR. However, by that time, the newly freely-elected &quot;Volkskammer&quot; (parliament) was moving in the direction of outright unification with the Federal Republic, and so the draft constitution went nowhere.

<doc id="299497" wikidata="Q491961" url="?curid=299497" title="SS Central America">
<text>SS &quot;Central America, known as theShip of Gold, was a sidewheel [[steamship|steamer]] that operated between [[Central America]] and the [[East Coast of the United States]] during the 1850s. She was originally named theSS &quot;George Law, after George Law of New York. The ship sank in a hurricane in September 1857, along with 425 of her 578 passengers and crew and 30,000 pounds (13,600 kg) of gold, contributing to the Panic of 1857.

==Sinking==
On September 3, 1857, 477 passengers and 101 crew left the City of Aspinwall, now the Panamanian port of Colón, sailing for New York City under the command of William Lewis Herndon. The ship was laden with of gold prospected during the California Gold Rush. The ship continued north after a stop in Havana.
On September 9, 1857, the ship was caught up in a Category 2 hurricane while off the coast of the Carolinas. By September 11, the winds, and heavy seas had shredded her sails, she was taking on water, and her boiler was threatening to fail. A leak in a seal between a paddle wheel shaft and the ship&#x27;s side sealed its fate. At noon that day, her boiler could no longer maintain fire. Steam pressure dropped, shutting down both the bilge pumps. Also, the paddle wheels that kept her pointed into the wind failed as the ship settled by the stern. The passengers and crew flew the ship&#x27;s flag inverted (a distress sign in the US) to signal a passing ship. No one came.
A bucket brigade was formed, and her passengers and crew spent the night fighting a losing battle against the rising water. During the calm of the hurricane, attempts were made to get the boiler running again, but these failed. The second half of the storm then struck. The ship was on the verge of foundering. The storm carried the powerless ship, and the strong winds would not abate. The next morning, September 12, two ships were spotted, including the brig &quot;Marine&quot;. Only 100 passengers, primarily women and children, were transferred in lifeboats. The ship remained in an area of intense winds and heavy seas that pulled her and most of her company away from rescue. &quot;Central America&quot; sank at 8:00 that evening, with a loss of 425 lives. A Norwegian bark, &quot;Ellen&quot;, rescued an additional 50 from the waters. Another three were picked up over a week later in a lifeboat.
==Aftermath==
In the immediate aftermath of the sinking, the greatest attention was paid to the loss of life, which was described as &quot;appalling&quot; and as having &quot;no parallel&quot; among American navigation disasters. At the time of her sinking, &quot;Central America&quot; carried gold then valued at approximately (2021 value of $765 million, based on a gold price of $1,738.70 per troy ounce = $56,087 per kg). The valuation of the ship itself was substantially more than those lost in other disasters of the period, being $140,000 ().

Commander William Lewis Herndon, a distinguished officer who had served during the Mexican–American War and explored the Amazon Valley, was captain of &quot;Central America&quot; and went down with his ship. Two US Navy ships were later named USS &quot;Herndon&quot; in his honor, as was the town of Herndon, Virginia. Two years after the sinking, his daughter Ellen married Chester Alan Arthur, later the 21st President of the United States.

==Wreck, gold, and artifacts==
===Thompson expedition===
====Discovery of wreck and recovery of gold and artifacts====

The ship was located by the Columbus-America Discovery Group of Ohio, led by Tommy Gregory Thompson, using Bayesian search theory. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was sent down on September 11, 1988. Significant amounts of gold and artifacts were recovered and brought to the surface by another ROV built specifically for the recovery. The total value of the recovered gold was estimated at $100–150 million. A recovered gold ingot weighing sold for a record $8 million and was recognized as the most valuable piece of currency in the world at that time.
The Columbus-America Discovery Group&#x27;s eventual discovery of the wreckage may have been spurred on by initial interest by Harry John, an heir to the Miller Brewing Company fortune who, near the end of his life launched unsuccessful, haphazard treasure hunts funded by a supposedly charitable foundation he had run for decades.

====Legal issues====
Thirty-nine insurance companies filed suit, claiming that they had the right to it because they paid damages in the 19th century for the lost gold. The team that found it argued that the gold had been abandoned. After a legal battle, 92% of the gold was awarded to the discovery team in 1996.

Thompson was sued in 2005 by several investors who had provided $12.5 million in financing and 2006 by several crew members over a lack of returns for their respective investments. In 2009, he had an off-shore account in the Cook Islands of $4.16 million (~$ in ). Thompson went into hiding in 2012. A receiver was appointed to take over Thompson&#x27;s companies and, if possible, salvage more gold from the wreck, in order to recover money for Thompson&#x27;s various creditors.

Thompson was located in January 2015, along with assistant Alison Antekeier, by United States Marshals Service agents and was extradited to Ohio to provide an accounting of the expedition profits. In November 2018, Thompson agreed to surrender 500 gold coins but then claimed he had no access to the missing coins. On November 28, 2018, a jury awarded investors $19.4 million in compensatory damages: $3.2 million to the Dispatch Printing Company — which had put up $1 million of $22 million invested — and $16.2 million to the court-appointed receiver for the other investors.

===Subsequent events===

In March 2014, a contract was awarded to Odyssey Marine Exploration to conduct archeological recovery and conservation of the remaining shipwreck. The original expedition excavated only 5 percent of the ship, according to a court-appointed receiver.

Universal Coin &amp; Bullion, a precious metals dealer based in Beaumont, Texas, exhibited gold and silver coins recovered from &quot;Central America&quot; in May 2018.

Heritage Auctions sold several gold pieces recovered from the &quot;Central America&quot; at auction in 2019, highlighted by the considerable size of the 174.04-ounce (4.93 kg) Harris, Marchand &amp; Co. gold ingot which sold for $528,000 (~$ in ).

&quot;Central America&quot;′s ship&#x27;s bell — larger than most ship′s bells of its time at tall and a little over wide at its lower flange edge and embossed with &quot;MORGAN IRON WORKS&quot; and &quot;NEW YORK 1853&quot; — was discovered in her wreck in 1988. It was displayed publicly at the Columbus Museum of Art in Columbus, Ohio, in 1992; at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Liberty Township in Delaware County, Ohio, in 1993; and at the American Numismatic Association′s World′s Fair of Money in Rosemont, Illinois, in 2021. It was offered as a gift to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in August 2021, and the United States Department of the Navy accepted the offer. It was positioned next to the Herndon Monument at the Academy and was dedicated in a ceremony on May 23, 2022.

<doc id="299503" wikidata="Q545536" url="?curid=299503" title="Electric Six">
<text>Electric Six is an American rock band formed in Detroit in 1996. They are known for combining elements of rock, disco, garage rock, metal, new wave, and punk rock. Since achieving widespread recognition in 2003 with the singles &quot;Danger! High Voltage&quot; and &quot;Gay Bar&quot;, they have released 20 studio albums, two rarities albums, one live album and one live DVD. Each band member is given a unique stage name; the line-up has undergone changes over the years; co-founder, lead vocalist, and primary songwriter Dick Valentine has been the only constant member. The current line-up consists of Valentine, lead guitarist Johnny Nahinal, keyboardist Tait Nucleus?, rhythm guitarist Herb S. Flavourings, drummer Dr. Jay and bassist Rick Schaple.

==History==
===1990s===
The band formed in Detroit in 1996 under the name the Wildbunch, but eventually dropped that name due to pressure from English musical collective the Wild Bunch. Throughout the late 1990s, they played regularly at the Old Miami and Gold Dollar clubs in Detroit, the center of a scene that also produced acts like the White Stripes. The band was originally composed of lead singer Dick Valentine (Tyler Spencer), drummer M. (Cory Martin), lead guitarist The Rock and Roll Indian (Anthony Selph), rhythm guitarist Surge Joebot (Joe Frezza), and bassist Disco (Steve Nawara, formerly of the Detroit Cobras).

Valentine has always been the primary songwriter, both music and lyrics, of the band. During the band&#x27;s temporary split at the end of the 1990s, he formed his own band called the Dirty Shame and released one CD titled &quot;Smog Cutter Love Story&quot; which featured a rough draft of &quot;Vengeance and Fashion&quot;, a song that later appeared on Electric Six&#x27;s breakthrough album &quot;Fire&quot;.

===2000s===
The band had reformed by 2001 to record and release &quot;Danger! High Voltage&quot; and record the track &quot;Dealin&#x27; in Death and Stealin&#x27; in the Name of the Lord&quot; with Troy Gregory for his &quot;Sybil&quot; album.

The 2003 release of &quot;Danger! High Voltage&quot; proved a massive hit for the band, particularly in Britain. The song also garnered attention after a rumor began to spread that the unidentified second vocalist featured on it, officially credited as someone named John S O&#x27;Leary, was The White Stripes&#x27; frontman Jack White before his band became popular. Although this was presented as fact in multiple sources, Electric Six guitarist Surge told an interviewer who asked about the singer&#x27;s identity, &quot;It&#x27;s a fan. We put a competition out, and he won. He&#x27;s a mechanic, it wasn&#x27;t Jack White.&quot; Bassist Disco then added, &quot;Yeah, he was probably the only person that entered.&quot; In another interview, drummer M. said that his lawyer had &quot;advised [the band] to neither confirm nor deny the presence of Jack White&quot;. In a video published on his YouTube channel in 2018, Valentine confirmed that White is the secondary vocalist on the song.

The band&#x27;s 2003 debut &quot;Fire&quot; (also produced and mixed by Damien Mendis and Stuart Bradbury) earned the group significant critical success, landing the &quot;Danger! High Voltage&quot; single at number 2 on the UK singles chart. Their second single, &quot;Gay Bar&quot;, released in 2003, reached No. 5 in the UK charts. The song was reportedly inspired by a raucous night out in Detroit&#x27;s gay club scene with former Crazy Town member Brandon Calabro. The album made it into several best-of-2003 lists, as well as reaching the top 10 in the UK album chart, and another single &quot;Dance Commander&quot;, which gave Electric Six its third Top 40 single in the UK.

The Rock and Roll Indian, Surge Joebot and Disco all left the band after finishing the recording of &quot;Fire&quot; in June 2003, leaving Dick Valentine, M, and Tait Nucleus? as the remaining members. Four new musicians joined Electric Six shortly afterwards - lead guitarist (John Nash of The Volebeats, The Witches and solo effort The Alphabet), rhythm guitarist The Colonel (Zach Shipps, ex member of Brendan Benson, The Atomic Numbers, and Mood Elevator), guitarist John R. Dequindre (Chris Peters) and bass player Frank Lloyd Bonaventure (Mark Dundon), the last two both being ex members of Ann Arbor&#x27;s whirlingRoad, Getaway Cruiser, and Six Clips. The Colonel had to opt out of early performances due to prior touring commitments. Bonaventure soon left to attain a Juris Doctor degree, and Dequindre consequently switched from guitar to bass.

In early 2004, Electric Six played at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Señor Smoke&quot;, was released in the United Kingdom on February 14, 2005. Since the band had been dropped from their previous American record label, a North American release of the album was delayed until February 7, 2006, when it came out on Metropolis Records. The first single from the album put the band at the center of controversy with Queen fans, following a cover of the hit Queen song &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;. The controversial music video showed lead singer Dick Valentine portraying the ghost of late Queen frontman Freddie Mercury and performing with a backing band of poodles. Queen drummer and &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; writer Roger Taylor said that he was &quot;unimpressed&quot; with the video, though Queen guitarist Brian May reportedly liked it.

Valentine addressed the controversy and said, &quot;Some have claimed this video portrays me dancing on Freddie Mercury&#x27;s grave, but that wasn&#x27;t the idea. Actually it&#x27;s more like we are resurrecting Mr. Mercury for the duration of the song and his grave is the logical starting point. [...] I guess a video like that can be taken the wrong way, but we hadn&#x27;t looked at it like that. [...] Everyone knows we disliked the fact that we had to put this song on our record, so this ridiculous video took a little bit of the sting out of it for us and made it somewhat bearable. [...] I definitely respect Freddie and his work.&quot;

In November 2004, drummer M. left the band, leaving Dick Valentine as the sole original member of the former Wildbunch. Their new drummer, Percussion World (Mike Alonso), had been affiliated with the band and its members for some time, and was named as a permanent member of the band. Electric Six finished recording their third album, titled &quot;Switzerland&quot;, in November 2005 and released it in North America on September 12, 2006. The band intended to record a video for every song on the album, &quot;a lot of them...low budget.&quot;

In May 2007, Swedish bassist Smörgåsbord! (Keith Thompson, member of Johnny Headband) joined the band, replacing John R. Dequindre on the bass, who reportedly wished to spend more time on his other musical projects. &quot;I Shall Exterminate Everything Around Me That Restricts Me from Being the Master&quot;, Electric Six&#x27;s fourth studio album, was released October 9, 2007. It has sixteen tracks. In the UK the album was released on October 22. 16 of the 18 tracks recorded were used on the album. There were no singles in support of this album; however, the band have had several music videos produced and spread over the internet for a number of tracks on the album.

A fifth album, &quot;Flashy&quot;, was released on October 21, 2008. This same year the band won the 2008 &quot;My Heart&quot; Competition for this album. The band promoted the album in the US, the UK and Spain on their &#x27;Hitting the Walls and Working the Middle&#x27; tour. A 30 track album of demos and previously unreleased material titled &quot;Sexy Trash&quot; was released and made available at those shows. In May 2009, Metropolis records released &quot;Covered in Gas&quot; by Evil Cowards, a project by Valentine and Fall On Your Sword&#x27;s William Bates.

&quot;KILL&quot; was released on October 20, 2009 in the US with the UK release following on November 2, 2009. Dick Valentine told the audience at Johnny Brenda&#x27;s in Philadelphia on April 30, 2009 that the new fall release would be titled &quot;Jared Styles&quot;; however the final name for the album simply became &quot;KILL&quot;. A music video for first track on the album, &quot;Body Shot&quot;, has been released on the internet, and is featured on the upcoming soundtrack of Michael Benveniste&#x27;s &quot;Tedd Can Chronicles&quot;.

===2010s===
On February 14, 2010, Dick Valentine announced via the Electric Six website that the band is in the process of recording their 7th studio album.
Valentine also mentioned that this album would contain a cover song that they have been contemplating for a long time. This cover has since been confirmed as &quot;The Rubberband Man&quot; by The Spinners.

On April 30, 2010, Dick Valentine confirmed at a concert at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana that the seventh album would be a twelve-track compilation titled &quot;Zodiac&quot;. It was released on September 28, 2010.

The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Heartbeats and Brainwaves&quot;, was announced through their official website on June 22, 2011. It was released on October 11. It was the first release of which served as producer. Previews of five tracks from the album were posted on the band&#x27;s official Facebook page.

On January 30, 2012, the band announced via their website and Facebook that they were going to release a live album, titled &quot;Absolute Pleasure&quot;, in late 2012. The album was recorded at shows in Minneapolis and Chicago in May. &quot;Absolute Pleasure&quot; was initially reported to be a double album, with the first disc containing the entirety of their first album, &quot;Fire&quot;, and the second containing their &quot;favorite tracks from all the other albums&quot;, however, these plans changed in development and the finished product was a single-disc amalgamation of both discs&#x27; content.&quot; A live DVD of &quot;Fire&quot; was also going to be filmed at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London on December 15; however, these plans were cancelled and later revisited as the band&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Absolute Treasure&quot; Kickstarter project.

Lead singer Dick Valentine released his first solo album &quot;Destroy the Children&quot; under the Dick Valentine moniker on May 14, 2012.

On February 16, 2013, the band launched a Kickstarter campaign for a live DVD called &quot;Absolute Treasure&quot;. The project was intended to give Electric Six the funds to film and release a live DVD of a performance to be filmed on September 7, 2013. The funding was successful.

On April 11, 2013, the band confirmed through their Facebook page that their next album, &quot;Mustang&quot;, would be released in October 2013, and was released on the 8th of the month.

Lead singer Dick Valentine released his second solo album &quot;Halloween Fingers&quot; under the Dick Valentine moniker on April 30, 2013.

&quot;Absolute Treasure&quot; was released for download in February 2014.

Towards the end of their 2013 tour, Dick Valentine confirmed on stage that they were working on a new album to be released in 2014. On January 22, 2014, the Electric Six Facebook page posted &quot;Hey Crazies...work has commenced on studio album # 2,143...or 10, depending upon how you&#x27;re keeping score. It&#x27;ll be out in the fall. No confirmed title yet, so don&#x27;t ask.&quot;

The title was later confirmed as &quot;Human Zoo&quot; on May 16, 2014, and was released for streaming on Spotify on October 13, 2014.

On June 6, 2014, Electric Six launched their second Kickstarter project; this time for a two-disc album titled &quot;Mimicry and Memories&quot;. Disc 1, &quot;Mimicry&quot;, being a cover album. Each member of the band personally selected a song to cover and the funding packages offered four fans the chance to choose a song to be included on the album. Songs included on &quot;Mimicry&quot; include covers of &quot;One&quot; by Harry Nilsson, &quot;The Warrior&quot; by Patty Smyth and Scandal, &quot;The Look&quot; by Roxette, &quot;Do You Love Me?&quot; by Kiss, &quot;Everywhere&quot; by Fleetwood Mac, &quot;Easy Lover&quot; by Phil Collins and Phillip Bailey, &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; by Loverboy and &quot;Cat People (Putting Out Fire)&quot; by David Bowie.

Disc 2, &quot;Memories&quot;, served as a sequel to &quot;Sexy Trash&quot;, offering another selection of rarities, demos and B-sides from the band&#x27;s back-catalogue. The project was successfully completed and was released to the public in March 2015.

Lead singer Dick Valentine announced the release of his third solo album, &quot;Here Come the Bags!&quot; under the Dick Valentine moniker. It was released on April 21, 2015.

On March 24, 2015, it was announced that bassist Smorgasbord was to leave the band. He was subsequently replaced by Matt Tompkins, AKA Rob Lower, from the band Mighty Tiny.

On October 2, 2015, the band released its eleventh studio album, titled &quot;Bitch, Don&#x27;t Let Me Die!&quot; It was originally released for streaming via Spotify on Metropolis Records.

On January 7, 2016, the band suggested via their Instagram page that longtime drummer Percussion World would be leaving the group. A few weeks later, he surfaced as the new drummer for Celtic punk band Flogging Molly under his real name, Mike Alonso. He was replaced by Noah Appel, AKA Two-Handed Bob, who also was in Mighty Tiny with Matt Tompkins earlier.

2016 saw the fruition of the band&#x27;s &quot;Roulette Stars of Metro Detroit&quot; project, a mockumentary feature film starring the band as themselves, funded by Kickstarter and complete with soundtrack album.

On July 29, 2016, the band announced its twelfth studio album, &quot;Fresh Blood for Tired Vampyres&quot;, which was released on October 7, 2016. Two Handed Bob left and was replaced by Hyperkube Bonanza (Ray Kubian). In September, the band launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome!&quot;, a double-album with one disc being a covers album – a sequel to &quot;Mimicry&quot; – and the second disc being a live album – a sequel to &quot;Absolute Pleasure&quot;. The live album contained the show recorded at the O2 Academy in Oxford on the 22nd of April 2017. &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome!&quot; was released in September 2017.

In October 2017, Electric Six released its thirteenth studio album, &quot;How Dare You?&quot; In November, the band launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of a double album titled &quot;A Very Electric SiXmas and Chill Out!&quot; with the first disc being a Christmas studio album and the second disc a live album containing a set of stripped-down versions of the band&#x27;s songs.

In July 2018, the band announced that its fourteenth studio album would be titled &quot;Bride of the Devil&quot;. It was released on October 5, 2018.

=== 2020s ===
In 2021, Cleopatra Records issued an album of covers by Electric Six called &quot;Streets of Gold&quot;.

The band spent most of 2022 and 2023 touring North America and Europe.

In 2023, the band released &quot;Torquoise&quot;, &quot;Tourquoise&quot; was their first album of new material since 2018&#x27;s &quot;Bride of the Devil&quot;. Work on the album initially began in January 2020, but was interrupted by the Covid pandemic. Though &quot;Turquoise&quot; was completed in 2022, its release was held for a year to coincide with a U.S. tour.

The band completed a &quot;Fire 20th Anniversary&quot; tour of the United Kingdom in late 2023, followed by a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; tour of Australia in mid 2024.

The band intend to release a greatest hits record in 2025. With some songs of new material.

==Sound, style, and influences==
Electric Six incorporates a variety of styles, resulting in being termed a &quot;genre-blurring&quot; band. The group&#x27;s sound has been described as a synthesis of &quot;disco, synth pop, glam, and arena rock&quot;, including the falsetto vocals of disco, laden with &quot;rampant solos, be they guitar riffs, synth wails, or strutting drums&quot; that enforce the band&#x27;s &quot;energetic sound&quot;. However, the band members themselves have rejected such genre classifications as &quot;disco-metal&quot; and &quot;disco-punk&quot;.

Critics have termed their lyrics &quot;disaffected, angry, ironic, and lustful&quot;, expressing &quot;macho flippancy&quot; and &quot;tongue-in-cheek pomposity&quot;. Dick Valentine has estimated that &quot;90% of [their] songs, maybe even higher&quot; are &quot;about absolutely nothing&quot;. Songs by Electric Six are often concerned with subjects such as sex, dancing, masculinity, hypersexuality, fast food, and fire; the band&#x27;s official biography states that their debut album &quot;Fire&quot; was so named because they &quot;noticed an abundance of the word fire on this record and decided to go with it&quot;.

Commenting on their usual lyrical material while promoting the band&#x27;s album &quot;Switzerland&quot;, frontman Dick Valentine said, &quot;For the first time, none of the songs have the word &#x27;dance&#x27; or variation of &#x27;dance&#x27; in the title. But fear not. We have songs with &#x27;drugs&#x27; and &#x27;girls&#x27; and &#x27;tonight&#x27; and &#x27;night&#x27; and &#x27;louder&#x27; and &#x27;party&#x27; in the title, so we haven&#x27;t given up on our philosophy just yet.&quot;

Valentine cited Freddie Mercury, Talking Heads, Falco, Devo, and Captain Beefheart as his musical influences, as well as Black Sabbath, Queen, and KISS for the rest of the group.

<text>Venom are an English heavy metal band formed in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1978. Coming to prominence towards the end of the new wave of British heavy metal, Venom&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Welcome to Hell&quot; (1981) and &quot;Black Metal&quot; (1982), are considered major influences on black metal, thrash metal and extreme metal in general. Their second album proved influential enough that its title was used as the name of the black metal genre; as a result, Venom were part of the early wave of the genre, along with Mercyful Fate and Bathory.

==History==

===Early years (1978–1981)===
The band was formed in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1978. The original personnel came from three different bands: Guillotine, Oberon and Dwarfstar. The original Guillotine featured Jeffrey Dunn and Dave Rutherford on guitars, Dean Hewitt on bass guitar, Dave Blackman on vocals, and Chris Mercater on drums who replaced Paul Burke, the original drummer when the band was founded. Blackman and Mercater were later also replaced by drummer Anthony Bray and vocalist Clive Archer. Later, Hewitt was replaced by Alan Winston on bass. The band name then changed in 1978 to Venom. In late 1979, Conrad Lant replaced Dave Rutherford. Lant later switched to bass after the departure of Winston. The band members took on new stage names. Archer became &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;, Lant &quot;Cronos&quot;, Bray &quot;Abaddon&quot;, and Dunn &quot;Mantas&quot;.

Since the beginning of their career, Venom have often used &quot;Satanic&quot; lyrics and imagery. However, such references were mostly for shock value.

In late 1979, Lant introduced the band to his original song ideas as he did not want to keep playing the same cover songs, and with Dunn he began writing new songs for the band. Lant had yet composed songs like &quot;Sons of Satan&quot;, &quot;Bloodlust&quot; and &quot;Welcome to Hell&quot;, while Dunn had yet composed songs like &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, &quot;Red Light Fever&quot;, &quot;Buried Alive&quot;, &quot;Raise the Dead&quot; and &quot;Live Like an Angel, Die Like a Devil&quot;. Dunn and Lant redefined together these songs with a mutual collaboration and then, after a few weeks, Lant recorded a rehearsal session on a basic cassette recorder which he played for the label he worked for, although as the band rehearsed in an old church hall the sound was not good. In April 1980, Lant was able to persuade the label to give him some free studio time and the band recorded a three-song demo. Soon after, six more tracks were recorded for just £50, with Lant taking vocal duties on the song &quot;Live Like an Angel&quot;. Archer then left the band, and Venom&#x27;s line-up became a trio.

===Classic line-up (1981–1986)===
Venom&#x27;s professional recording debut was the 1981 single &quot;In League with Satan / Live Like an Angel&quot;, which was released by Neat Records. Later that year they released their full-length debut, &quot;Welcome to Hell&quot;.

&quot;Welcome to Hell&quot; was a big influence on future thrash bands. Venom&#x27;s music was faster and harsher than most heavy metal contemporaries and while Satanism and other dark topics had been featured in metal before, the subject had rarely been more prominent. Lant was quoted as saying that this celebration of evil subjects was inspired by the perceived need to out-do musicians like Ozzy Osbourne of Black Sabbath, who would &quot;sing about evil things and dark figures, and then spoil it all by going: &#x27;Oh, no, no, please, God, help me!&#x27;&quot;

Their second album, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Black Metal&quot;, is cited as perhaps the most important influence in the development of black metal, thrash metal, death metal, and other related styles that are often grouped under the extreme metal umbrella. Many defining elements of these genres are first found in the lyrics and song titles created by Lant, his unique singing style and larger than life presence. Venom&#x27;s first two albums inspired cult followings to this day. While many of their new wave of British heavy metal peers (like Iron Maiden) had found measures of popular success or critical acclaim, or (like Def Leppard) were moving away from heavy metal towards hard rock, Venom were still regarded by critics as &quot;a trio of buffoons&quot;.

In 1984, Venom recorded the &quot;At War with Satan&quot; album, an epic 20-minute title track, with substantial influences of many different musical styles, which took up the first side of the LP. The title track written by Lant, was a deliberate way for him to rebuff the critics who said Venom could not play. The B-side was focused on the rapid-fire, three-minute &quot;scorchers&quot; Venom were known for, including &quot;Stand Up And Be Counted&quot;. A live video, &quot;The 7th Date of Hell Venom Live at Hammersmith Odeon&quot;, was also released that year. In 1985, Venom released their fourth studio album, &quot;Possessed&quot;, which was recorded in a stately home, and saw a band enjoying their success with different chefs being flown in every day during the album&#x27;s recording, lavish parties of sex, drugs and rock n&#x27; roll. By this time Venom had released several singles (&quot;Warhead&quot;, &quot;Die Hard&quot; and &quot;Manitou&quot; among others) and live EPs (&quot;The Assault Series&quot; including &quot;Canadian Assault&quot;, &quot;American Assault&quot; and &quot;French Assault&quot;). Cronos and Abaddon appeared on the &quot;Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge&quot; video with Slayer and Exodus. Cronos cites the &quot;Possessed&quot; album as underestimated. &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any songs that are kind of overlooked, I just think some songs maybe weren&#x27;t recorded as well as we could have recorded them. Like say for example on the &quot;Possessed&quot; album, I still think there are great songs&quot;. During March/April 1986, Venom the band seems ready to record the fifth album (then never released), called &quot;Deadline&quot;, but internal relationships begin to deteriorate. A live album, &quot;Eine Kleine Nachtmusik&quot;, and a second live video, &quot;Alive in &#x27;85&quot;, were released in 1986. Dunn then left the band to release a solo album.

===Temporary break-up and Tony Dolan era (1987–1995)===

Two guitarists, Mike Hickey and Jim Clare, were hired to replace Dunn. Their fifth album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Calm Before the Storm&quot;, moved away from Satanic themes in favour of &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; material. This was a new direction for Venom, although it did not last long, with only a short Japanese and Brazilian tour in 1986, so the band decided to split, and Lant, Clare and Hickey all left to form Lant&#x27;s solo band, Cronos.

Bray was left as the only group member, but he was able to convince Music for Nations for a deal to release a new Venom album on the Under One Flag label, using &quot;Deadline&quot; demo tracks which were recorded with previous line-ups but never released. In 1988, Bray offered a vocals/bass role to Tony Dolan (The Demolition Man) from Atomkraft. Bray and Dolan wrote new material prior to Dunn&#x27;s rejoining the band along with rhythm guitarist Al Barnes. Together they recorded &quot;Prime Evil&quot; (1989), &quot;Tear Your Soul Apart&quot; (1990) and &quot;Temples of Ice&quot; (1991). Barnes then left the band, and Steve White from Atomkraft was hired as his replacement. They released &quot;The Waste Lands&quot; in 1992, also without success. Music for Nations refused to release any more Venom albums, so Dolan and Dunn quit, effectively disbanding Venom. Bray continued to release compilation and live albums up to 1995. Nonetheless, Dolan, Dunn and Bray continued performing as a trio.

===Reunion and new releases (1995–present)===
In 1995, Lant, Dunn and Bray reunited the &quot;classic&quot; line-up, beginning by headlining the Waldrock Festival on 24 June 1995. They recorded and self-released the &quot;Venom &#x27;96&quot; EP with four re-recorded old tracks and one new song, resulting in a record deal with the SPV label. Following this was a live CD/video box set, &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, composed entirely of songs from their classic era such as &quot;Welcome to Hell&quot;, &quot;Countess Bathory&quot;, &quot;In Nomine Satanas&quot; and &quot;Black Metal&quot;. An album, &quot;Cast in Stone&quot;, was next released in 1997, split between two discs which was one of all new material and the other with re-recordings of popular early-&#x27;80s songs.

By 1999, internal conflicts in the band delayed production of the second album in their deal with SPV. Band manager Eric Cook and Abaddon decided not to work with Cronos again. Abaddon wrote a letter to Cronos, with the intent of firing him. In response, Cronos communicated the situation to SPV. The record company refused to work with Venom if Cronos was not part of the line-up. Cronos answered Abaddon telling him: &quot;You can&#x27;t kick the Devil out of hell, I&#x27;m firing you!&quot; Despite this, the band tried to invite Abaddon to play with them again but Bray did not want to perform on the album and he was replaced by Conrad Lant&#x27;s younger brother, Anton. This line-up released &quot;Resurrection&quot; in 2000 on SPV. However, in 2002 Dunn was next to leave the group and Lant replaced him with an American guitarist, Mike Hickey, who had already taken part in the 1987 release, &quot;Calm Before the Storm,&quot; and Cronos solo albums. In late 2005, Venom released a career-spanning four-disc box set, &quot;MMV&quot;, which includes an exclusive mini-poster of the band&#x27;s seven-date tour of Europe with Metallica and a 60-page picture book, with interviews and pictures. The set includes all their best-known songs, along with rarities like live tracks, demos and outtakes. This line-up of the band released the &quot;Metal Black&quot; album in 2006.

In 2007, Mike Hickey left the band and guitarist Stuart &quot;Rage&quot; Dixon joined the band and this line-up released the record &quot;Hell&quot; the following year. In 2009, drummer Danny &quot;Dante&quot; Needham joined the band and Lant wrote that this will be known as &quot;The Epic Line-Up of Venom&quot;, and they set off on a full South American tour. After headlining festivals around the world for the next couple of years gaining in popularity, they released the &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; album on 28 November 2011.
Venom released their fourteenth studio album, &quot;From the Very Depths&quot;, on 27 January 2015. The band also played one song, &quot;Rise&quot;, they were working on in the studio, live for the audience at Rockfest 2014.

Venom released a three-track EP, &quot;100 Miles to Hell&quot;, on 22 December 2017. Their fifteenth album, &quot;Storm the Gates&quot;, was released on 14 December 2018.

;Venom Inc.

In April 2015, in anticipation of a date of M-pire of Evil (band of Mantas and Demolition Man) at the Keep It True Festival in Germany, the organisers of the festival asked Mantas and Demolition Man if they could play the songs of Venom with Abaddon. Mantas had not talked to Abaddon since 1998. After thinking a bit, the two former Venom members played along with Abaddon without having done any rehearsals for the show. At this point, the three brought together the Venom line-up of 1988–1992 under the name of Venom Inc. for the sake of the fans (instead of the name &quot;Iron &amp; Steel&quot;, that was initially conceived by the members themselves). Abaddon was eventually replaced in 2018. The group has released two studio albums.

==Musical style and influences==
Venom were one of the first incarnations of extreme metal, influencing many thrash metal, black metal, death metal, and other extreme metal bands. They are considered one of the premier influences on black metal, and their 1982 album &quot;Black Metal&quot; gave the genre its name. Venom&#x27;s exact genre has been a topic of debate. They have been labelled various genres by the press, most prominently thrash and speed metal. Cronos insists on calling it black metal, without passing judgment on the genre that later would flourish in Norway:

Prime influences of Venom were Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Motörhead, the Sex Pistols and Kiss. Other musicians or bands that have influenced Venom are Deep Purple, the Who, the Tubes, Van Halen, the Rolling Stones, and Elvis Presley.

==Legacy and influence==
&quot;Welcome to Hell&quot; influenced several later bands. Venom&#x27;s music helped shape the development of thrash metal bands like Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth, who in turn were influential. Metallica opened for Venom on an early 1980s tour, Venom opened for Metallica and Slayer on the &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; tour, and Slayer played with them and Exodus on the &quot;Combat Tour&quot; in 1985. Both Kerry King and Tom Araya have cited Venom as an important early influence on Slayer&#x27;s image and music, while Dave Mustaine of Megadeth said he and James Hetfield of Metallica were fans of Venom. Lars Ulrich of Metallica said of Venom&#x27;s first album: &quot;&quot;Welcome To Hell&quot; was a classic! Black metal, speed metal, death metal, whatever you want to call it, Venom started it all with that one record!&quot; Mille Petrozza of Kreator stated that Venom was one of his favourite bands early in his career, alongside the &quot;Big Four&quot;. Canadian band Voivod covered seven different Venom songs on their early demos.

Venom would also be of importance to the black metal scene and the early death metal scene. Swiss band Hellhammer (later to become Celtic Frost) and Norwegian band Mayhem are among the acts influenced by Venom; Quorthon, the frontman of Swedish band Bathory, called &quot;Black Metal&quot; &quot;one of the best albums ever made&quot; in an interview, although he downplayed Venom&#x27;s influence on him. Possessed and Repulsion, two bands which went on to influence much of the death metal and grindcore to come, were both influenced by Venom, with Jeff Becerra of Possessed often asserting Venom and Exodus as the two main influences on his band. Music critic Bradley Torreano wrote that Venom &quot;caught the attention of both metalheads and punks, the band was emulated by the former and turned into camp icons by the latter.&quot; Henry Rollins once compared the band to Spinal Tap.

Although they did not make it to MTV&#x27;s top 10 heavy metal bands list, they were given an &quot;honorable mention&quot;.

Reflecting on Venom&#x27;s 40th anniversary, Cronos said that without Venom, bands such as Metallica or Slayer would not exist. He explained, &quot;We were the band that was influenced by Motörhead and the Sex Pistols, but we took their sound and made something completely new out of it. We were completely new; no one had heard anything like us. And of course, unbeknown to us, in America there were these kids who were listening to our records and then shaping what we were doing into their own thing. Slayer would be an example of that. And I agree, without us those bands either wouldn&#x27;t exist, or would sound very different from the way they do.&quot; He also cited the line-up consisting of himself, along with guitarist Stuart &quot;Rage&quot; Dixon and drummer Danny &quot;Danté&quot; Needham as &quot;the best one we&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;

==Criticism==
A Venom song was included in the so-called &quot;Filthy Fifteen&quot; list compiled by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) during 1980s hearings on musical content. The title-song from the &quot;Possessed&quot; album was criticised by the PMRC for having &quot;occult&quot; lyrical content. The efforts by the PMRC resulted in the inclusion of Parental Advisory labels that became ubiquitous on physical music media.

Venom&#x27;s biggest criticism is regarding Satanism, which is the main driving force behind the band&#x27;s music and album covers. Cronos explained in 2008 that the reasoning behind it is for entertainment purposes.

Critic Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic writes that even though &quot;Welcome to Hell&quot; influenced &quot;literally thousands&quot; of bands, Venom were &quot;critically reviled&quot;. Critic James Christopher Monger, however, declares that the members of Venom &quot;grew as musicians&quot; as their careers progressed. Ethnographer Keith Kahn-Harris argues that Venom&#x27;s limited technical skill, particularly early in their career, was a profound, though inadvertent factor in the band&#x27;s influence: being unable to mimic more technically proficient metal of their predecessors or peers, Venom instead opted to focus on sheer speed, creating music that was inspired by earlier metal, yet simultaneously innovative.

<text>Frank Durward White (born Durward Frank Kyle Jr.; June 4, 1933 – May 21, 2003) was an American banker and politician who served as the 41st governor of Arkansas. He served a single two-year term from 1981 to 1983.

==Early years, family, and education==
White was born on June 4, 1933, in Texarkana in Bowie County, Texas, as Durward Frank Kyle Jr. His father, Durward Frank Kyle, died when White was seven, and White&#x27;s mother, the former Ida Bottoms Clark, married Loftin E. White of Highland Park, Texas. He took his stepfather&#x27;s name and became &quot;Frank Durward White&quot;. After the death of the stepfather in 1950, the Whites returned to Texarkana. White enrolled in the New Mexico Military Institute and was subsequently appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He graduated from the academy in 1956 with a degree in engineering. White served as a pilot in the United States Air Force. In 1957, as &quot;one of his first missions&quot;, he flew members of the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock due to the Little Rock Integration Crisis. White was discharged from the Air Force in 1961 with the rank of Captain.

White&#x27;s first marriage was to Mary Blue Hollenberg, a member of a prominent Little Rock family; they had three children before divorcing in 1973. In 1975, White married Gay Daniels, &quot;a devout Christian&quot;. They had no children, but gained custody of the children from White&#x27;s first marriage.

As a youth, White was baptized at Beech Street First Baptist Church, which Mike Huckabee would later pastor, in Texarkana, Arkansas. He attended the First United Methodist Church in downtown Little Rock, but in 1977, he and some other couples, dissatisfied with the church&#x27;s liberal theology, left it and instead started the fundamentalist Fellowship Bible Church.

==Business career==
After being discharged from the Air Force in 1961, White worked at Merrill Lynch in Little Rock before joining Commercial National Bank in 1973. White served as the first director of the Little Rock Port Authority from 1972 to 1973.

In 1975, Arkansas Governor David Pryor appointed White as the director of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission (AIDC). In 1977, White left the AIDC, afterward serving as the president of Capital Savings and Loan Co.

==Governor of Arkansas==

===1980 campaign===

Early in 1980, White switched from Democratic to Republican affiliation to run for governor. First, he defeated former State Representative Marshall Chrisman, a businessman from Ozark in Franklin County, for the gubernatorial nomination. In a low-turnout open primary, White polled 5,867 votes (71.8%) to Chrisman&#x27;s 2,310 (28.2%). Clinton also faced a stronger-than-expected challenger in his primary from Monroe Schwarzlose, a turkey farmer from Kingsland in Cleveland County in south Arkansas. Schwarzlose&#x27;s 31 percent of the primary vote foreshadowed that Clinton could be in trouble for the upcoming general election. Despite this, it was widely expected that Clinton would win the election.

White hired Paula Unruh of Tulsa to manage the campaign. She decided to focus upon (1) Clinton&#x27;s unpopular increase in the cost of automobile registration tags and by (2) the Carter administration&#x27;s sending thousands of Cuban refugees, some unruly, to a detention camp at Fort Chaffee, outside Fort Smith in Sebastian County in western Arkansas. Her decision paid big dividends, as White won with 435,684 votes (51.9%) to Clinton&#x27;s 403,242 (48.1%). White won fifty-one of the state&#x27;s seventy-five counties. A. Lynn Lowe of Texarkana, Clinton&#x27;s Republican opponent in 1978, by contrast, had won only six counties.

White was the second Republican ever elected governor in Arkansas since Reconstruction.

===Tenure===
White signed a law that required the teaching of creationism in Arkansas public schools, along with the theory of evolution. The law was subsequently overturned in 1982 in the court case &quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot;.

White also created controversy within his own party in 1981, when he appointed Orval Faubus, a former Democratic governor, to head the Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs.

===1982 and 1986 campaigns===

White was unable to secure a hold on the governorship. Chrisman and a third candidate, nutritionist Connie Voll of Lonoke, challenged him in the 1982 primary. Voll was the first woman to seek the GOP nomination for governor and the second to seek the party nomination for a statewide office since Leona Troxell. Clinton then defeated him in a rematch of the 1980 contest during the general election: 431,855 (54.7%) to 357,496 (45.3%). White won only nineteen counties in the 1982 rematch, which occurred in a nationally Democratic year when the nation was in a recession.

In 1986, White again challenged Clinton for the governorship but lost.

==Later career and death==
After his 1986 defeat, White returned to First Commercial Bank in Little Rock as senior vice president until his retirement from the bank in 1998. White declined to seek the Republican nomination for governor again in 1990 and instead supported Sheffield Nelson in his primary race against U.S. Representative Tommy F. Robinson. That year, Clinton won election as governor for the fifth time; two years later he would be elected President of the United States. Without sufficient support and resources to run for elected office again, White left elective politics but remained active in Republican affairs.

From 1998 to 2003, White served as Arkansas Banking Commissioner, an appointment from Governor Mike Huckabee. He remained in the post until shortly before his death from a heart attack in 2003, at age 69. White&#x27;s time in the Banking Department was noted by his practice of visiting all of Arkansas&#x27; state-chartered banks at least once a year.

White is interred at the historic Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock.

The Arkansas Republican Party began awarding the &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Frank White&quot; award in 2006. This award is considered to be the highest honor given out by the Arkansas GOP.

<text>David MacRitchie (16 April 1851 – 14 January 1925) was a Scottish folklorist and antiquarian. He proposed that stories of fairies originated with an aboriginal race that occupied the British Isles before Celts and other groups arrived.

==Early life==

David MacRitchie was the younger son of William Dawson MacRitchie and Elizabeth Elder MacRitchie. He was born in Edinburgh and attended the Edinburgh Southern Academy, the Edinburgh Institute and the University of Edinburgh. He did not gain a degree but qualified as a chartered accountant. His father had been a surgeon in the East India Company.

==Career as folklorist==

In 1888 MacRitchie founded the Gypsy Lore Society to study the history and lore of Gypsies. He was also a member of several folklore societies. In 1914, he joined the Council of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, serving as vice-president from 1917 – 1920. He was noted for his interest in archaeology, being appointed as a trustee for Lord Abercromby&#x27;s endowment for an Archaeology department at the University of Edinburgh. He was also a member of the Scottish Arts Club and vice-president of the Philosophical Institution.

From 1922 until his death, he served as the treasurer of the Scottish Anthropological and Folklore Society.

==Fairy euhemerism==
David MacRitchie was a prominent proponent of the euhemeristic origin of fairies, a theory traceable to the early 19th century that considers fairies in British folklore to have been rooted in a historical pygmy, dwarf or short-sized aboriginal race, that lived during Neolithic Britain or even earlier.

===Origins===
MacRitchie is often credited as being the founder of the euhemerist school regarding British fairies. However, historian Edward J. Cowan has noted that the folklorist John Francis Campbell first founded this school of thought about 30 years before MacRitchie. Carole G. Silver, Professor of English at Yeshiva University has also traced the euhemerist theory of fairies further back to Walter Scott in his &quot;Letters on Demonology&quot; (1830). With the emergence of anthropological schools in the late 19th century, various renowned anthropologists such as Edward Burnett Tylor (1871) became proponents of the euhemeristic origin of fairies, in direct conflict with the religious or psychological theories of their origin.

===The theory===
Fairy euhemerism, as developed by MacRitchie, attempts to rationally explain the origin of fairies in British folklore, and regards fairies as being a folk-memory of a &quot;small-statured pre-Celtic race&quot;, or what Tylor theorised as possible folk memories of the original (Stone Age) aboriginal people of Britain. MacRitchie&#x27;s theory subsequently became known in the late 19th century by folklorists as the &quot;ethnological or pygmy theory&quot;. The euhemeristic theory of fairies became considerably popular through MacRitchie&#x27;s key works &quot;The Testimony of Tradition&quot; (1890) and &quot;Fians, Fairies and Picts&quot; (1893). However, it is largely based on racialist ideas prominent in MacRitchie&#x27;s era, an essentialist notion of treating any identifiable (or allegedly identifiable) ethnicity or culture as a separate race of humans with innate, distinctive traits.

Different ideas surfaced in the late 19th century and early 20th century concerning the &quot;racial&quot; origin of the supposed dwarf aborigines of Britain, and these hypotheses ranged from proposing that they were (using the ethno-racial labels of the era, which are now obsolete) real African &quot;Pygmies&quot; (a blanket term encompassing the Bambenga, Mbuti, and Twa), &quot;Eskimos&quot; (another vague, and today often offensive, exonym grouping the Inuit, Yupik and sometimes Aleut peoples), or a short-statured &quot;Mediterranean race&quot;.

MacRitchie himself argued in his &quot;Testimony of Tradition&quot;, under a chapter subheading entitled &quot;A Hairy Race&quot; (p. 167), that they were somewhat connected to the &quot;Lapps&quot; (another today-offensive term, for the Sámi peoples and sometimes more broadly inclusive of related Uralic Siberian peoples), whom MacRitchie also connected with the &quot;Eskimos&quot; and with the Ainu of East Asia. He wrote that the aboriginal British were a distinct derived &quot;race&quot;, however, because of their very long beards, concluding: &quot;one seems to see the type of a race that was even more like the Ainu than the Lapp, or the Eskimo, although closely connected in various ways with all of these&quot; (p. 173). In MacRitchie&#x27;s view, the indigenous population of Britain were thus a &quot;quasi-European&quot; Lapp–Ainu–Eskimo-related race, with minor Mongoloid traits, whom he considered ancestral to the Picts of early Scotland, a view earlier proposed by Walter Scott.

MacRitchie&#x27;s identification of fairies with Picts was based primarily on the earlier accounts by Adam of Bremen and the &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, which describe the Picts of Orkney as &quot;only a little exceeding pygmies in stature&quot;. MacRitchie also discovered through &quot;The Orcadian Sketch-Book&quot; by Walter Traill Dennison (1880) that legends across Scotland describe the homes (usually underground dwellings) of the fairies as &quot;Pict&#x27;s Houses&quot; and so he believed the Picts were literally the basis of fairies in British folklore. In &quot;Fians, Fairies and Picts&quot; (1893), &quot;The Northern Trolls&quot; (1898) and &quot;The Aborigines of Shetland and Orkney&quot; (1924) MacRitchie attempted to further identify the fairies of British folklore with the Finfolk of Orkney mythology, the Trows of Shetland myth, the Fianna of Old Irish Literature, and the Trolls as well as the Svartálfar and Svartálfaheimr (elves or dwarves) of Norse mythology. A 12th-century Irish manuscript is found referenced in &quot;Fians, Fairies and Picts&quot; which equates the Fianna to fairies, but this is one of the few literary sources MacRitchie used as evidence; instead he turned to philology and comparative mythology.

====Support====

MacRitchie&#x27;s rationalisation of fairies, as having their basis as a historical population of diminutive size, won over much support from anthropologists from the late 19th century who questioned the religious or psychological origin of fairies. A notable proponent of the theory who had read MacRitchie&#x27;s earlier works published in the &quot;Celtic Review&quot; was Grant Allen, who became convinced that fairies were modelled on an indigenous population of Britain, specifically the Neolithic long barrow makers. The archaeologist William Boyd Dawkins found MacRitchie&#x27;s views also appealing, since in his &quot;Early Man in Britain and His Place in the Tertiary Period&quot; (1880) he considered Upper Paleolithic culture across Europe (including Britain) to have been founded by a proto-Eskimo or Lapp race, a view at the time which was popularised after the discovery of &quot;Chancelade Man&quot;, in southwestern France by Leo Testut in 1889. Scientific consensus after the 1930s, however, agreed that the remains of &quot;Chancelade Man&quot; were Cro-Magnon. Within folklore, MacRitchie&#x27;s euhemeristic view of fairies developed a racialist school which considered that the fairies and other beings such as elves and goblins of British myth represented primitive pre-Aryans, a view proposed most notably by John S. Stuart Glennie, Laurence Waddell, and Alfred Cort Haddon. According to Haddon: &quot;fairy tales were stories told by men of the Iron Age of events which happened to men of the Bronze Age in their conflicts with men of the Neolithic Age&quot;. In both Haddon&#x27;s and Waddell&#x27;s view, the fairies or other beings of British folklore were based on the Neolithic inhabitants of Britain.

Among folklorists who considered, supported, or praised MacRitchie&#x27;s views were Laurence Gomme, who in 1892 published &quot;Ethnology in Folklore&quot;, which argued folklore preserved a strong racial history of conquered or replaced indigenous peoples. The folklorist Charles G. Leland, who positively reviewed MacRitchie&#x27;s book &quot;The Testimony of Tradition&quot; (1890), wrote &quot;The book should be of exceptional interest to every folk-lorist, both on account of its subject-matter and also on account of the manner in which it is treated&quot;.

====Criticism====

MacRitchie&#x27;s theories of fairies sparked criticism from proponents of the religious or psychological origin of fairies. Walter Evans-Wentz strongly criticised MacRitchie&#x27;s theory in his &quot;The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries&quot; (1911). This prompted MacRitchie to respond to such criticisms in several articles published in the &quot;Celtic Review&quot; (October 1909, January 1910). It was mostly however MacRitchie&#x27;s theory that the Picts were a dwarf or short statured race which was strongly rejected. Most historians of the day rejected Mackenzie&#x27;s &quot;Pygmy-Pict&quot; theory. T. Rice Holmes, for example, mocked MacRitchie&#x27;s claims, considering them eccentric and baseless since no archaeological evidence had ever proven of a &quot;race of pre-neolithic or even prehistoric pygmies existed in this country&quot;. Critics attempted to pick holes in MacRitchie&#x27;s claims on mythology; for example, Evans-Wentz noted that the Fianna of Irish myth are sometimes described as &quot;giants&quot;. MacRitchie acknowledged these criticisms in his own writings but attempted to work around them and provide solutions:

Therefore, in MacRitchie&#x27;s view, the Irish myths and folkloric accounts which describe the Fianna as &quot;giants&quot; only did so in a non-literal figurative sense to describe their savage nature, not size. This idea was later expanded upon in his &quot;The Savages of Gaelic Tradition&quot; (1920) yet was not well received by contemporary folklorists. However, ancient authors such as Macrobius shared MacRitchie&#x27;s beliefs that the &quot;giants&quot; of mythology were not giants in size, but huge in impiety (or their primitiveness). According to MacRitchie there were also &quot;two&quot; Pictish races, the former were the aboriginal dark Lappish or Ainu race, while a later white-skinned, red-headed group invaded them, who he considered the Caledonians.

==British origin of Gypsies==

In his &quot;Ancient and Modern Britons&quot;, MacRitchie claimed that the Gypsies were not of foreign origin, but were in fact the more conservative element of the native British population who had retained their nomadic way of life while the majority adopted a settled lifestyle.

<text>The Ontario Academic Credit (OAC), which may also be known as 12b ( or CPO) was a fifth year of secondary school education that previously existed in the province of Ontario, Canada, designed for students preparing for post-secondary education. The OAC curriculum was codified by the Ontario Ministry of Education in &quot;Ontario Schools: Intermediate and Senior&quot; (OS:IS) and its revisions. The Ontario education system had a final fifth year of secondary education, known as Grade 13 from 1921 to 1988; grade 13 was replaced by OAC for students starting high school (grade 9) in 1984. OAC continued to act as a fifth year of secondary education until it was phased out in 2003.

==History==
The fifth year in the Ontario secondary school system had existed in Ontario for 82 years, from 1921 to 2003, first as Grade 13 and then as the Ontario Academic Credit. The first attempt to reform the education system in Ontario was initiated in 1945, with the Royal Commission on Education, which proposed a three-tiered education system with six years of elementary education, followed by four years of secondary education, and culminating in three years of junior colleges. However, the commission&#x27;s report was shelved after five years, in part because of its potential to reopen the politically-sensitive issue of separate school funding and also because of the Minister of Education&#x27;s prior interference in curriculum redesign a year earlier.

The threat to the fifth year of secondary school education in Ontario grew significantly during the 1960s, with growing opposition to the grade 13 departmental examinations from parents. That led to the establishment of the Grade 13 Study Committee in 1964 by Education Minister Bill Davis, which recommended the elimination of both the departmental examinations and grade 13. A subsequent recommendation in 1968, in the Hall-Dennis Report, also called for the elimination of grade 13. In spite of the recommendations, however, grade 13 was maintained by the Ontario government.

Significant opposition from parents, businesses, and universities regarding the education reforms had surfaced by the 1970s, and they believed there was a decline in academic standards, a lack of focus in the curriculum, and lax discipline in schools. Combined with financially-pressured school boards beginning to call for the abolition of grade 13 as a means of financial restraint, that resulted in the government reevaluating its secondary education system. The resulting document was the &quot;Ontario Schools: Intermediate and Senior&quot; (OS:IS), which had called for the formal elimination of grade 13 without formally eliminating the fifth year of secondary education. Acting upon the recommendations of the document, Ontario formally eliminated grade 13 in 1984, and introduced the Ontario Academic Credit system. The new system allowed for students to graduate from secondary schools in four years but also maintaining the fifth year, known as OAC, which had courses catering for students planning to proceed with post-secondary education. Despite the fact that students could graduate from the secondary school system in four years, a fifth year of secondary education continued to persist in Ontario, with fewer than 15 percent of students exercising the option to graduate in four years; reports stated that between 20 percent and 25 percent of students chose to repeat one or more OAC years.

Another Royal Commission on Learning, set up in 1995 by the 35th Legislative Assembly of Ontario provincial government, had recommended the elimination of OAC. The incoming 36th Legislative Assembly of Ontario provincial government acted upon the recommendations of the commission in 1998, but students still in the five-year system would continue in the OAC system until they graduated. The motivation for phasing out OAC was largely thought of as a cost-saving measure by the Progressive Conservatives that would bring Ontario into line with the rest of the provinces. The reforms led to a new, standardized curriculum documented in &quot;Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements&quot; (OSS). The OAC year was replaced with an extra ten days of schooling in each lower grade, and the material was integrated into the earlier years of education. The last graduating class of OAC was in 2003.

==Course load==
There were two high school diplomas in Ontario, the Secondary School Graduation Diploma (SSGD) which was awarded after Grade 12 and the Secondary School Honours Graduation Diploma (SSHGD) awarded after Grade 13. This practice ended with the replacement of both diplomas in 1988 with the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) under OS:IS. OS:IS more formally allowed for the completion of schooling after only 12 grades. Under OS:IS, OAC year was the final year of high school in Ontario.

OAC courses were the highest level courses in Ontario high schools until the formal elimination of the Ontario Academic Credit. To enter university, students were required to complete 30 high school credits (courses can have different credit values, but most courses were worth 1 credit; some courses were compulsory and there were other restrictions), 6 of which had to be at the OAC level. Assuming that one had taken the necessary prerequisite courses, one could complete an OAC course before the OAC year, and so in many schools it was common for Grade 11 or Grade 12 students to have taken some OAC courses. Students who completed these requirements in 4 years of high school were permitted to graduate; this practice was known as fast-tracking, finishing Grade 12 in four years with 30 credits if the student was college bound. Under the old Grade 13 system, the SSGD represented 27 credits and the SSHGD usually represented 33 credits (however, as long as you could pass the 6 credits required for an SSHGD, the Ontario school system was required to award the OSSHGD, even if you had less than 33 credits overall). A minority of students completed the old program in four years by completing eight credits per year and one summer school credit (usually Grade 12 mathematics, as each maths course had the previous year as prerequisite).

Students with an average of 80 percent or higher in six OAC courses were named Ontario Scholar. The award continues to exist today, although it requires the student to have 80 percent or higher in six grade 12 courses.

==Consequences of elimination==
The elimination of the fifth year of high school education in Ontario led to a number of consequences, most notably the double cohorts in 2003, in which an unusually high proportion of students graduated in Ontario. Since the elimination of OAC, some have noted that a greater proportion of students have entered post-secondary education. However, in a paper published by Harry Krashinsky of the University of Toronto, the author found that the elimination of OAC had a large and negative impact on academic performance in university.

===Double cohorts===
The elimination of OAC led to a spike in more than 100,000 students graduating in 2003, with the last OAC (OS:IS) class and the first Grade 12 (OSS) class graduating in the same year. This strained many Ontario post-secondary institutions, as the spike in students forced the institutions to either construct or rent new buildings for student housing. With the increase in students entering post-secondary education, the provincial government set aside additional funding for colleges and universities to build more infrastructure such as residences and classrooms. They also had to provide more resources such as upgrading libraries, adding more study areas, creating new programs, and hiring additional professors and teaching assistants. For those who were unable to enter post-secondary institutions, the provincial government allocated more funding for the apprentice program. The spike in students graduating in 2003 had also led to more competitive admission standards in most Ontario universities along with arbitrarily short-lived higher standards to graduate from universities. Some students under OS:IS who feared that they might not be able to gain admission to the university of their choice as a result of the double cohort decided to fast-track to graduate before 2003; as well, some students under OSS decided to take an extra year of high school to graduate in 2004 or delayed application to post-secondary institutions. Double-cohort students who chose the latter options in their turn affected those in the year after them, creating a ripple effect. A higher-than-typical number of withdrawals from group education fund investments to pay for post-secondary expenses resulted in lower payout per individual in the double cohort year. In June 2007, a cascade double-cohort effect occurred at universities and the job market, as double cohort students who were finishing their undergraduate studies in April competed for graduate spaces in universities or employment in the job market.

===Drinking age===
The elimination of OAC resulted in the majority of incoming first-year students in Ontario universities to drop from 19 to 18 years of age. This created a legal liability to universities as the majority of first-year students were now below the legal drinking age (it is 19 in Ontario). This has forced the universities to eliminate or police many frosh-week events and traditions that allegedly encouraged drinking and has banned the consumption of alcohol at most frosh-week events. Queen&#x27;s University&#x27;s Student Orientation Activities Review Board (SOARB) noted in 2005 that

[F]irst-year students seemed to show more desire to drink than those of the past few years. Student drinking, prior to attendance, compromised events at which no alcohol was available... The Board wonders if there is merit to making the evening hours busier to avoid allowing time to &quot;pre-drink&quot; before events.

With a significant minority of students below the legal drinking age, 18-year-olds are legally excluded from many campus events and social activities. The temporal nature of this exclusion and the stress associated with establishing a social network in an unfamiliar environment creates intense pressure for underage students to either find ways to subvert the Ontario drinking laws (by purchasing fake IDs, using real IDs of other people, or drinking in private residences with ill-gotten alcohol) or sacrifice relationships with those of legal drinking age.

==Assessment of elimination==
Patrick Brady and Philip Allingham of Lakehead University have argued that the provincial government&#x27;s attempt to bring Ontario in line with the rest of the continent&#x27;s 12 grades system has only been partially successful. While the fifth year of secondary education was formally eliminated, both have noted that the fifth year in secondary schools is still a norm in Ontario, with students in Ontario still opting to take a fifth year in secondary school, colloquially known as the victory lap.

In the first few years after OAC had been eliminated, more than 32 percent of students returned for a fifth year. The percentage of students who opt for a fifth year has since decreased between 15 percent to 20 percent, with some predicting it to level out around that level. In the 2007–2008 year, students over the age of 19 made up 3.7 percent of all secondary day school enrolment in Ontario.

Both Brady and Allingham note that the motivations behind the victory lap can be traced to the province&#x27;s history of a fifth year of secondary school education, making it a basic assumption of secondary school life for students in Ontario. They also note that it may represent a form of transition anxiety, as students seek to prolong their secondary education, which can be seen as a safe environment, or to acquire further maturity before moving on to their post-secondary education. They also note how the centrality of secondary school life can make a student prolong it. While they found it was not a universal phenomenon, they noted a number of students who returned for a fifth year primarily to continue their participation in the school&#x27;s non-academic programming. In Brady&#x27;s and Allingham&#x27;s study, they had also found differences between genders. While close to half of male participants in their study opted to spend a fifth year in secondary schools, only one in five females choose to do so. They also noted that the motivations of both genders differed, with females opting to victory lap in order to gain additional academic credits, while males primarily opted for a fifth year in order to participate in sports and to gain maturity.

<doc id="299519" wikidata="Q529328" url="?curid=299519" title="Alex Higgins">
<text>Alexander Gordon Higgins (18 March 1949 – 24 July 2010) was a Northern Irish professional snooker player and a two-time world champion who is remembered as one of the most iconic figures in the sport&#x27;s history. Nicknamed &quot;Hurricane Higgins&quot; for his rapid play, and known as the &quot;People&#x27;s Champion&quot; for his popularity and charisma, he is often credited as a key factor in snooker&#x27;s success as a mainstream televised sport in the 1980s.

Higgins turned professional in 1971 and won the World Snooker Championship in 1972, defeating John Spencer 37–31 in the final to become the first qualifier to win the world title, a feat that only two other players—Terry Griffiths in 1979 and Shaun Murphy in 2005—have achieved since. Aged 22, he was then the sport&#x27;s youngest world champion, a record he held until 21-year-old Stephen Hendry won the title in 1990. He was world championship runner-up to Ray Reardon in 1976 and Cliff Thorburn in 1980. At the 1982 event, Higgins came from 13 to 15 behind to defeat Jimmy White 16–15 in the semi-finals, producing a 69 clearance in the penultimate frame that is regarded as one of the greatest breaks in the sport&#x27;s history. He defeated Reardon 18–15 in the final, winning his second world title ten years after his first. Images of a tearful Higgins holding his baby daughter after his 1982 victory are regarded as some of the most iconic in the history of British televised sport. Higgins won Masters titles in 1978 and 1981 and won the UK Championship in 1983, where he recovered from 0–7 behind to defeat Steve Davis 16–15 in the final. As of 2023, he is one of 11 players to have completed a career Triple Crown. He won the World Doubles Championship with White in 1984 and played with Dennis Taylor and Eugene Hughes on the all-Ireland team that won the World Cup three consecutive times from 1985 to 1987. He won his last professional title at the 1989 Irish Masters, defeating Hendry 9–8 in the final.

Remembered for his turbulent lifestyle, Higgins was a lifelong heavy smoker, struggled with drinking and gambling, and admitted to using cocaine and marijuana. He had tempestuous relationships with women—both his marriages ended in divorce, and he had widely publicised altercations with other girlfriends, one of whom stabbed him three times during a domestic argument. Known as an unpredictable, difficult, and volatile character, he was often disciplined by the sport&#x27;s governing body, most notably when he was fined £12,000 and banned for five tournaments in 1986 after head-butting an official, and banned again for the entire 1990–91 season after punching another official and threatening to have Taylor shot. Higgins retired from the professional tour in 1997. Diagnosed with throat cancer the following year, he died of multiple causes in his Belfast home on 24 July 2010, aged 61.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Higgins was born in Belfast on 18 March 1949. The only son of Alexander and Elizabeth Higgins, he grew up on Abingdon Street with his sisters Isobel, Ann and Jean. The family lived near the Jam Pot, a snooker and billiards hall in the Sandy Row estate, which Higgins frequented from age 10, running bets for his father and doing odd jobs. He took up snooker the following year, initially at the Jam Pot before he began practising with more challenging opponents at the Shaftesbury and YMCA clubs in the city centre.

After leaving school in 1964, Higgins worked as a messenger for the Irish Linen Company, but the job was short-lived as it offered few prospects and the business was in decline. At around 15 he spotted a newspaper advert for stable boys at Eddie Reavey&#x27;s stables in Wantage, Berkshire and was taken on, with hopes of following his idol Lester Piggott and becoming a jockey. He disliked the required menial work and despite being fired six times, he was taken back on board. He stayed for almost two years, during which time he gained weight and became too heavy to ride competitively. He left the stables for London, where he settled in a Leytonstone flat and started playing snooker again. He won several money matches and earned extra income at a paper mill near London Bridge, but he grew homesick and returned to Belfast after a year. By the time he was 16, Higgins had compiled his first maximum break.

In 1967, he joined the snooker league at the Mountpottinger YMCA where he faced tougher opponents. He practised as much as six hours a day, studied weaknesses in the other players, and devised new shots in his game. In January 1968, after six months, Higgins felt ready to compete in the Northern Ireland Amateur Championship where he defeated Maurice Gill 41 in the final. In doing so he became the first player to win the title at his first appearance and, aged 18, was the youngest winner. One week later, he won the All-Ireland Amateur Championship, and turned professional for a short spell before reverting to amateur status. He was appointed captain of the Mountpottinger YMCA team. The following year he lost his Northern Ireland Amateur crown, losing 04 to Dessie Anderson in the final. Around this time, Higgins defeated world champion John Spencer in several exhibition matches where he received a start of 14 per frame.

===Professional career===
====1970s====
Higgins relocated to England as it presented more favourable opportunities for snooker. It was here where salesman Dennis Broderick and bingo tycoons Jack Leeming and John McLaughlin recognised his talents and became his agents, buying him a flat and new clothes. John McLaughlin originated the nickname of &quot;Hurricane&quot; for Higgins, who would have preferred &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;. Higgins turned professional full-time at age 22, and worked out his strategy against the top professionals around this time; he noted they were percentage players and to beat them, chose to &quot;attack with brute force and scare them to death&quot;. Higgins&#x27; sister Isobel offered to pay the £100 fee so he could enter the 1971 World Snooker Championship, but he declined as he did not feel ready.

The 1972 World Snooker Championship began in March 1971 and concluded in February 1972, and Higgins won the title at his first attempt, defeating Spencer 37–31 in the final. In the qualifying competition, Higgins won ten consecutive frames in defeating Maurice Parkin 11–3. Dunning eliminated Miles 11–5 at the Selly Park British Legion. then eliminated Jackie Rea 19–11, making breaks of 103 and 133 during the match. Rea complimented Higgins on the performance, saying that &quot;He does everything wrong. And yet he knocks such a lot in.&quot; In the quarter-finals, he saw off former champion John Pulman 31–23. Higgins defeated Jackie Rea in the final of the Irish Professional Championship in January 1972, a title Rea had held since 1952. Rex Williams took nine consecutive frames to establish a 12–6 lead against Higgins in the World Championship semi-final. Higgins was not ahead in the match after this until he won the 51st frame for 26–25. The match went to a deciding frame, and Williams was 28 points to 14 ahead when he missed an attempt to pot a blue ball from its spot into a middle pocket. Higgins compiled a break of 32, and then, following some safety play, potted the green ball to clinch victory. Williams later commented &quot;That blue could have changed the direction of both our careers.&quot; Spectators at the final final, held at Selly Park British Legion, Birmingham, were seated on wooden boards placed atop beer barrels. There was a miners&#x27; strike in progress at the same time as the final, and on the first evening of play, without normal power, the session was conducted with reduced light provided by a mobile generator. As champion, Higgins earned £480 in prize money.

Higgins was the youngest-ever winner of the title, a record he held until Stephen Hendry&#x27;s victory at the age of 21 in 1990. In the summer Higgins was the subject of the half-hour Thames TV documentary &quot;Hurricane Higgins&quot;. During an exhibition match in Bombay, an inebriated Higgins was unable to play due to the high temperatures and proceeded to play shirtless. He was fined £200. In 1973 Higgins made his debut appearance on &quot;Pot Black&quot;, but he lost his first game and stormed off the set. Ted Lowe convinced him to return and finish his other games, but friction between the two remained and Lowe forbade Higgins to appear on the show for five years. Higgins lost his world title with a 9–23 defeat to Eddie Charlton in the semi-finals of the 1973 tournament. Higgins blamed his loss to Charlton on having to use a new after his usual one had been broken a few months before the tournament. At the time, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) had scheduled a meeting to hear a complaint that Higgins had refused to continue in a tournament after complaining about the lighting. Pulman, the WPBSA chairman, declared that he welcomed Higgins losing, as &quot;he [had] dragged the game down.&quot; 

By the end of 1974, Higgins had started to alter his attacking style of play and add more tactical and safety elements, but his results remained inconsistent throughout the rest of the decade. In April 1976, Higgins reached the final again after close wins against Cliff Thorburn, Spencer and Charlton. Higgins led 10–9 against but faded over the stretch. In a match marred by erratic refereeing and a sub-standard table, Ray Reardon pulled away to win the title for the fifth time, with the score finishing at 27–16. The 1977 World Championship was the first to he held at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, and Higgins lost the of his first-round match against Doug Mountjoy. Although not one of the eight invited professionals to enter the 1977 Pontins Open, for which Lowe was an organiser, Higgins was one of the 24 players from an entry of 864 to reach the stage where the invited professionals joined the draw, despite having to concede 21 points a frame to amateur players. He whitewashed Reardon and Fred Davis, then defeated Terry Griffiths 7–4 in the final, watched by an audience of around 2,000 people. In &quot;Masters of the Baize&quot; (2005), a book about world snooker champions, Luke Williams and Paul Gadsby wrote that the tournament &quot;cemented his status as &#x27;The People&#x27;s Champion&#x27;.&quot;

Higgins retained the Irish Professional title against Dennis Taylor in 1978. A week later, a A 7–5 victory over Thorburn, from 4–5 behind, secured the 1978 Masters title for him. At the 1978 World Championship, he led Patsy Fagan 12–11 in the first round but was eliminated after he lost three close frames: on a , then the final and, on the final . He saw of challenges from Fagan for the Irish Professional title in 1978 and 1979.

====1980s====
Higgins lost the Irish Professional title to Dennis Taylor the week before the 1980 World Championship. At the World Championship, he won the deciding frame against Tony Meo in the first round, then eliminated Mans, Steve Davis, and Kirk Stevens to reach the final against Thorburn. Sydney Friskin of &quot;The Times&quot; described the match as a contrast of styles: &quot;the shrewd cumulative processes of Thorburn against the explosive break-building of Higgins&quot;. He also noted that each player had accused the other of distracting them during the match. Higgins led 6–3 at the end of the first session, extending this to 9–5 before Thorburn levelled the match at 9–9. They were also level at 11–11, 13–13, 15–15 and 16–16, from which point Thorburn won the two frames he needed to secure victory at 18–16. Higgins was runner-up to Steve Davis at the 1980 UK Championship, losing 6–16. He was the first player to win a second Masters title, beating Terry Griffiths 9–7 in the 1981 final after being runner-up when the two contested the 1980 final. He lost to Davis in the second round of the 1981 World Championship. That year, Souvenir Press published &quot;&quot;Hurricane&quot; Higgins&#x27; Snooker Scrapbook&quot;, an autobiographical work which Higgins had written in collaboration with Angela Patmore, having worked on the manuscript for almost a decade.

Higgins won the world title for a second time in 1982. He eliminated Jim Meadowcroft 10–5 in the first round, then won the of this match against Doug Mountjoy and prevailed 13–10 against Willie Thorne. In the semi-final, he trailed Jimmy White 13–15 in the best-of-31 match, but took the 29th frame and then compiled a break of 69 against White in the penultimate frame. Higgins had been 0–59 points behind in that frame, but managed to compile an extremely challenging clearance during which he was rarely in position. The break is regarded as one of the best in snooker history. In the final he faced Reardon. From 15–15, Higgins went on to achieve victory at 18–15, clinching the match with a 135 total clearance in the final frame. A tearful Higgins summoned his wife and baby daughter from the audience to celebrate with him. Higgins would have been ranked No. 1 in the world rankings for the 1982/83 season had he not forfeited ranking points following disciplinary action. He released a country and western styled single, &quot;One-Four-Seven&quot;, that year. It failed to chart.

Davis defeated him 5–16 in the semi-finals of the 1983 World Championship. In the final of the 1983 UK Championship he trailed Davis 0–7 before producing a comeback to win 16–15.

In 1986, Higgins split with his manager Del Simmons and signed with Framework, a management group run by Howard Kruger who also managed Jimmy White, Kirk Stevens, and Tony Knowles. Later that year the four, with Status Quo released a cover of &quot;The Wanderer&quot; by Dion as a counter to &quot;Snooker Loopy&quot;, a pop single featuring snooker players managed by Barry Hearn&#x27;s Matchroom. At the 1986 UK Championship, Higgins head-butted tournament director Paul Hatherell after an argument. He was fined £12,000 and banned from five tournaments, while he was also convicted of assault and criminal damage arising from the incident, and was fined £250 by a court. Higgins was fined £500 for being abusive towards tournament director Kevin Norton at the 1987 Irish Masters. In 1987 he reached the Masters final for the fifth time; he lost in the deciding frame to Dennis Taylor. By 1988, Higgins had been fined a total of £17,200 in his professional career.

In 1988, Higgins was dropped by Kruger and acquired a new manager, Robin Driscoll. In January 1989, Higgins fell out the window from his partner&#x27;s first floor flat and broke multiple bones in his ankle. He arrived at several subsequent matches on crutches and played while hopping on one leg. Later that year, Kruger&#x27;s Framework Management company was wound up at Higgins&#x27;s instigation, with Higgins claiming that over £50,000 was owed to him. Clive Everton wrote after Higgins&#x27;s death that the money lost to Framework was &quot;a financial blow from which [Higgins] never recovered.&quot; His final professional triumph was in the 1989 Irish Masters when he defeated Stephen Hendry. This was the last professional tournament he won.

===1990s===
At the 1990 British Open, Higgins lost 8–10 in the final against Canadian player Bob Chaperon, which was his last appearance in a major final. Higgins received a runner-up prize of £45,000, the highest of his career. After losing his first-round match to Steve James at the 1990 World Championship, Higgins remained in his seat in the arena for some time, ordering several vodka and orange drinks, slouched in his chair and twitching. Afterwards, he punched tournament official Colin Randle in the abdomen before the start of a press conference at which he announced his retirement, and abused the media as he left. This followed another incident at the 1990 World Cup, where he repeatedly argued with fellow player and compatriot Dennis Taylor, insulting his late mother and threatening to have him shot if he returned to Northern Ireland. For his conduct, Higgins was banned for the rest of the season and all of the next.

During his 15-month ban Higgins released a biography video, &quot;I&#x27;m No Angel&quot; (1991). In 1992, Higgins and his collaborators Oliver Reed and the Troggs released &quot;Wild Thing&quot; as a single. He competed in pre-season qualifying matches against amateurs, including former women&#x27;s champion Stacey Hillyard. After a return to form, Higgins reached the televised rounds of the 1994 World Snooker Championship. Facing fellow Irishman Ken Doherty in the first round, he lost 10–6. The following year, during the qualifying rounds, he complained that the match referee John Williams was distracting him, not by standing in his line of vision but by being &quot;in his line of thought&quot;, when he was on a break that had reached 103. Williams refused to move, and Higgins, in tears, continued his break, eventually making 137, his highest-ever in a world championship match. He was a member of the Europe Team for the 1995 Mosconi Cup, a pool competition.

===Post-retirement===
After his retirement from the professional game, Higgins spent time playing for small sums of money in and around Northern Ireland. He made appearances in the 2005 and 2006 Irish Professional Championship, these comebacks ending in first-round defeats by Garry Hardiman and Joe Delaney, respectively.

On 12 June 2007, it was reported that Higgins had assaulted a referee at a charity match in the north-east of England. Higgins returned to competitive action in September 2007 at the Irish Professional Championship in Dublin but was whitewashed 0–5 by former British Open champion Fergal O&#x27;Brien in the first round at the Spawell Club, Templeogue. His autobiography, &quot;From the Eye of the Hurricane: My Story&quot;, was published in 2007.

Higgins continued to play fairly regularly, and enjoyed &quot;hustling&quot; all comers for small-time stakes in clubs in Northern Ireland and beyond; in May 2009 he entered the Northern Ireland Amateur Championship, &quot;to give it a crack&quot;, but failed to appear for his match.

On 8 April 2010, Higgins was part of the debut &quot;Snooker Legends Tour&quot; event in Sheffield, at the Crucible. Appearing alongside other retired or close-to-retiring professionals, including John Parrott, Jimmy White, John Virgo and Cliff Thorburn, he faced Thorburn in his match, but lost 2–0.

It is estimated that Higgins earned and spent £3–4 million in his career as a snooker player.

==Playing style==
In describing Higgins&#x27;s unconventional playing technique, his fellow professional Willie Thorne said that &quot;He does everything wrong: his stance is square, he lifts his head, his arm&#x27;s bent, he snatches at some of his shots.&quot; Thorne concluded that Higgins would be the worst example for an aspiring player to imitate. Higgins&#x27;s grip on his cue was less firm than typically employed by professional players. Author Brendan Cooper wrote that &quot;Beset with twitches, sniffs, and odd jerks of the limbs, Higgins would approach the table like a battered boxer trying to stay upright.&quot;

Originally an out-and-out attacking player, Higgins developed his tactical game throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Thorburn praised his innovative positional play, citing him as one of the first players to &quot;break out reds from potting the red, which is a very difficult thing to do.&quot; Williams and Gadsby wrote that as Higgins grew older, his &quot;technical shortcomings became burdensome&quot;, and that he began to fail on more shots as his hand-eye co-ordination declined, but note that he maintained a world championship career lasting over two decades. Writing for the &quot;Dictionary of Irish Biography&quot;, James Quinn said that &quot;His daredevil style thrilled audiences and inspired the kind of adulation and raucous cheering normally heard in football stadiums rather than snooker halls&quot; but a lack of consistency and discipline meant that Higgins failed to achieve as much as his potential should have allowed.

==Other media appearances==
Higgins partnered Kenny Lynch in &quot;Pro-Celebrity Snooker&quot; on ITV in 1978. He was a guest on &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; in 1980, and on &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot; the following year. The 1984 series &quot;International Pro Celebrity Golf&quot; on BBC 2 saw Higgins and Greg Norman play Lynch and Tom Watson.

Two video games with Higgins&#x27;s likeness were released for Amstrad computers in 1985, titled &quot;Alex Higgins&#x27; World Snooker&quot; and &quot;Alex Higgins&#x27; World Pool&quot;. In 1987 he appeared with Kruger on the chat show &quot;Wogan&quot; on the day he had been fined £12,000 and banned for five tournaments by the WPBSA, appearing relaxed and saying that he accepted the sanctions.

He made another appearance on &quot;Wogan&quot; in 1991. Higgins appeared in the Sporting Stars edition of the British television quiz &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; on 25 July 2009.

==Personal life==
At the time of his 1972 triumph at the World Championship, Higgins related that he did not have a permanent address, and had recently lived in a row of abandoned houses in Blackburn which were awaiting demolition. In one week he had moved into five different houses on the same street, moving down one every time his current dwelling was demolished.

Higgins married twice and had four children from three different relationships. In 1971, he met Joyce Fox and they had a son, Chris, in 1975. They separated six months later; in 2001, Fox told her son that Higgins was his father and they reconnected in 2003. In April 1975, Higgins married Australian Cara Hasler in Sydney. They had a daughter, Christel, and their divorce was finalised in 1979. In January 1980 Higgins married Lynn Avison in Wilmslow, Cheshire. They had a daughter, Lauren, in 1980 and son Jordan in 1983. They split in 1985 and divorced. In the same year, Higgins began a relationship with Siobhan Kidd, which ended in 1989 after he allegedly hit her with a hairdryer.

Higgins had a long and enduring friendship with Oliver Reed, who appeared on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; when Higgins was the subject in 1981.

In 1983 Higgins helped a young boy from Manchester, a fan of his who had been in a coma for two months, after his parents wrote to him. He recorded messages on tape and sent them to the boy with his best wishes. He later visited the boy in hospital and played a snooker match that he promised to have with him when he recovered.

In 1996, Higgins was convicted of assaulting a 14-year-old boy, while in 1997 then-girlfriend Holly Haise stabbed him three times during a domestic argument. In total, he was arrested 17 times.

===Illness and death===

For many years, Higgins smoked heavily; he reportedly smoked 80 cigarettes a day. He had an operation on cancerous growths on his palate in 1996. In June 1998, he was found to have throat cancer; on 13October of that year, he had major surgery. He could only talk in a whisper in his last years.

In early 2010 he suffered from pneumonia and breathing problems, and on 31March he was admitted to hospital. In April 2010 Higgins&#x27; friends announced that they had set up a campaign to help raise the £20,000 he needed for teeth implants, to enable him to eat properly again and put on weight. Higgins had lost his teeth after intensive radiotherapy used to treat his throat cancer. It was reported that since losing them he had been living on liquid food, and had become increasingly depressed, even contemplating suicide. He was too ill and frail to have the implants fitted. Despite his illness, Higgins continued to smoke cigarettes and drink heavily until the end of his life. He was admitted to hospital again in May.

By the summer of 2010, Higgins&#x27; weight had fallen to 6.5 stone (41 kilograms). Despite having once been worth £4 million, he was bankrupt and survived on a £200-a-week disability allowance. He was found dead in bed in his flat on 24July 2010. The cause of death was a combination of malnutrition, pneumonia, tooth decay and a bronchial condition, although his daughter Lauren stated that he was clear from throat cancer when he died.

Higgins&#x27; funeral service was held at St Anne&#x27;s Cathedral, Belfast, on 2August 2010. He was buried in Carnmoney Cemetery in Newtownabbey, County Antrim. Among the snooker professionals in attendance were Jimmy White, Willie Thorne, Stephen Hendry, Ken Doherty, Joe Swail, Shaun Murphy and John Virgo. Doherty and White were pall bearers.

==Legacy==

Alex Higgins was an inspiration to many subsequent professional snooker players, including Ken Doherty, Jimmy White and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. In Clive Everton&#x27;s TV documentary &quot;The Story of Snooker&quot; (2002), Steve Davis described Higgins as the &quot;one true genius that snooker has produced&quot;. Higgins arguably fulfilled his potential only intermittently during his career peak in the 1970s and 1980s; Everton puts this down to Davis and Ray Reardon generally being too consistent for him. O&#x27;Sullivan has called Higgins &quot;the greatest snooker player I have ever seen&quot; when he was playing at his best, while also acknowledging that his erratic lifestyle caused Higgins to have a lack of consistency on the table.

Higgins&#x27;s exciting style and explosive persona helped make snooker a growing sport in the 1970s and 1980s. He made a 16-red clearance in a challenge match in 1976; it was a break of 146, with the brown potted as the first &quot;red&quot;, and 16 colours: one green, five pinks and ten blacks.

In 2011, Event 8 of the Players Tour Championship was renamed as the Alex Higgins International Trophy. In 2016, WPBSA chairman Barry Hearn announced that the trophy for the new Northern Ireland Open tournament would be named after Higgins.

Richard Dormer wrote and directed a one-person play based on Higgins&#x27;s career, titled &quot;Hurricane&quot; (2004). Following performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, for which Dormer won &quot;The Stage&quot; Edinburgh Fringe Best Actor award, the production transferred to the West End and then toured the UK.

The professional rivalry between Alex Higgins and Steve Davis was portrayed in a 2016 BBC feature film titled &quot;The Rack Pack&quot;, in which Higgins was played by Luke Treadaway.

<text>The Senate of the Philippines () is the upper house of Congress, the bicameral legislature of the Philippines, with the House of Representatives as the lower house. The Senate is composed of 24 senators who are elected at-large (the country forms one district in senatorial elections) under a plurality-at-large voting system.

Senators serve six-year terms with a maximum of two consecutive terms, with half of the senators elected in staggered elections every three years. When the Senate was restored by the 1987 Constitution, the 24 senators who were elected in 1987 served until 1992. In 1992, the 12 candidates for the Senate obtaining the highest number of votes served until 1998, while the next 12 served until 1995. Thereafter, each senator elected serves the full six years. From 1945 to 1972, the Senate was a continuing body, with only eight seats up every two years.

Aside from having its concurrence on every bill in order to be passed for the president&#x27;s signature to become a law, the Senate is the only body that can concur with treaties and try impeachment cases. The president of the Senate is the presiding officer and highest-ranking official of the Senate. They are elected by the entire body to be their leader and are second in the Philippine presidential line of succession. The current officeholder is Francis Escudero.

== History ==

The Senate has its roots in the Philippine Commission of the Insular Government. Under the Philippine Organic Act, from 1907 to 1916, the Philippine Commission headed by the governor-general of the Philippines served as the upper chamber of the Philippine Legislature, with the Philippine Assembly as the elected lower house. At the same time the governor-general also exercised executive powers.

In August 1916 the United States Congress enacted the Philippine Autonomy Act or popularly known as the &quot;Jones Law&quot;, which created an elected bicameral Philippine Legislature with the Senate as the upper chamber and with the House of Representatives of the Philippines, previously called the Philippine Assembly, as the lower chamber. The governor-general continued to be the head of the executive branch of the Insular Government. Senators then were elected via senatorial districts via plurality-at-large voting; each district grouped several provinces and each elected two senators except for &quot;non-Christian&quot; provinces where the governor-general of the Philippines appointed the senators for the district.

Future president Manuel L. Quezon, who was then Philippine Resident Commissioner, encouraged future president Sergio Osmeña, then Speaker of the House, to run for the leadership of the Senate, but Osmeña preferred to continue leading the lower house. Quezon then ran for the Senate and became Senate President serving for 19 years (1916–1935).

This setup continued until 1935, when the Philippine Independence Act or the &quot;Tydings–McDuffie Act&quot; was passed by the U.S. Congress which granted the Filipinos the right to frame their own constitution in preparation for their independence, wherein they established a unicameral National Assembly of the Philippines, effectively abolishing the Senate. Not long after the adoption of the 1935 Constitution several amendments began to be proposed. By 1938, the National Assembly began consideration of these proposals, which included restoring the Senate as the upper chamber of Congress. The amendment of the 1935 Constitution to have a bicameral legislature was approved in 1940 and the first biennial elections for the restored upper house was held in November 1941. Instead of the old senatorial districts, senators were elected via the entire country serving as an at-large district, although still under plurality-at-large voting, with voters voting up to eight candidates, and the eight candidates with the highest number of votes being elected. While the Senate from 1916 to 1935 had exclusive confirmation rights over executive appointments, as part of the compromises that restored the Senate in 1941, the power of confirming executive appointments has been exercised by a joint Commission on Appointments composed of members of both houses. However, the Senate since its restoration and the independence of the Philippines in 1946 has the power to ratify treaties.

The Senate finally convened in 1945 and served as the upper chamber of Congress from thereon until the declaration of martial law by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, which shut down Congress. The Senate was resurrected in 1987 upon the ratification of the 1987 Constitution. However, instead of eight senators being replaced after every election, it was changed to twelve.

In the Senate, the officers are the Senate president, Senate president &quot;pro tempore&quot;, majority floor leader, minority floor leader and the Senate secretary and the Senate sergeant at arms who are elected by the senators from among the employees and staff of the Senate. Meanwhile, the Senate president, Senate president pro-tempore, the majority floor leader and the minority floor leader are elected by the senators from among themselves.

==Composition==

Article VI, Section 2 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the Senate shall be composed of 24 senators who shall be elected at-large by the qualified voters of the Philippines, as may be provided by law.

The composition of the Senate is smaller in number as compared to the House of Representatives. The members of this chamber are elected at large by the entire electorate. The rationale for this rule intends to make the Senate a training ground for national leaders and possibly a springboard for the presidency.

It follows also that the senator will have a broader outlook of the problems of the country, instead of being restricted by narrow viewpoints and interests by having a national rather than only a district constituency.

The Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET) composed of three Supreme Court justices and six senators determines election protests on already-seated senators. There had been three instances where the SET has replaced senators due to election protests, the last of which was in 2011 when the tribunal awarded the protest of Koko Pimentel against Migz Zubiri.

==Qualifications==
The qualifications for membership in the Senate are expressly stated in Section 3, Art. VI of the 1987 Philippine Constitution as follows:

*No person shall be a Senator unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, and on the day of the election, is at least 35 years of age, able to read and write, a registered voter, and a resident of the Philippines for not less than two years immediately preceding the day of the election.
*The age is fixed at 35 and must be possessed on the day of the elections, that is, when the polls are opened and the votes cast, and not on the day of the proclamation of the winners by the board of canvassers.
*With regard to the residence requirements, it was ruled in the case of &quot;Lim v. Pelaez&quot; that it must be the place where one habitually resides and to which he, after absence, has the intention of returning.
*The enumeration laid down by the 1987 Philippine Constitution is exclusive under the Latin principle of &quot;expressio unius est exclusio alterius&quot;. This means that Congress cannot anymore add additional qualifications other than those provided by the 1987 Philippine Constitution.

==Organization==
Under the Constitution, &quot;Congress shall convene once every year on the fourth Monday of July for its regular session...&quot;. During this time, the Senate is organized to elect its officers. Specifically, the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides a definite statement to it:

By virtue of these provisions of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, the Senate adopts its own rules, otherwise known as the &quot;Rules of the Senate.&quot; The Rules of the Senate provide the following officers: a president, a president &quot;pro tempore&quot;, a secretary and a sergeant-at-arms.

Following this set of officers, the Senate as an institution can then be grouped into the Senate Proper and the Secretariat. The former belongs exclusively to the members of the Senate as well as its committees, while the latter renders support services to the members of the Senate.

==Powers==

The Senate was modeled upon the United States Senate; the two chambers of Congress have roughly equal powers, and every bill or resolution that has to go through both houses needs the consent of both chambers before being passed for the president&#x27;s signature. Once a bill is defeated in the Senate, it is lost. Once a bill is approved by the Senate on third reading, the bill is passed to the House of Representatives, unless an identical bill has also been passed by the lower house. When a counterpart bill in the lower house is different from the one passed by the Senate, either a bicameral conference committee is created consisting of members from both chambers of Congress to reconcile the differences, or either chamber may instead approve the other chamber&#x27;s version.

While franchise and money bills originate in the House of Representatives, the Senate may still propose or concur with amendments. Only the Senate has the power to approve, via a two-thirds supermajority, or denounce treaties, and the power to try and convict, via a two-thirds supermajority, an impeached official.

==Seat==
The Senate currently meets at the GSIS Building along Jose W. Diokno Boulevard in Pasay. Built on land reclaimed from Manila Bay, the Senate shares the complex with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).

The Senate previously met at the Old Legislative Building in Manila until May 1997. The Senate occupied the upper floors (the Session Hall now restored to its semi-former glory) while the House of Representatives occupied the lower floors (now occupied by the permanent exhibit of Juan Luna&#x27;s Spoliarium as the museum&#x27;s centerpiece), with the National Library at the basement. When the Legislative Building was ruined in World War II, the House of Representatives temporarily met at the Old Japanese Schoolhouse at Lepanto Street (modern-day S. H. Loyola Street), while the Senate&#x27;s temporary headquarters was at the half-ruined Manila City Hall. Congress then returned to the Legislative Building in 1950 upon its reconstruction. When President Ferdinand Marcos dissolved Congress in 1972, he built a new legislative complex in Quezon City. The unicameral parliament known as the Batasang Pambansa eventually met there in 1978. With the restoration of the bicameral legislature in 1987, the House of Representatives inherited the complex at Quezon City, now called the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate returned to the Congress Building, until the GSIS Building was finished in 1997. Thus, the country&#x27;s two houses of Congress meet at different places in Metro Manila.

The Senate would eventually move to the New Senate Building at the Navy Village in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig by 2025 at the earliest. As the Senate has rented GSIS for the office space, it asked the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) to present suitable sites for it to move to, with the Senate eyeing the Navy Village property along Lawton Avenue as its favored site. In 2018, a building designed by AECOM was chosen as winner for the new home for the Senate and was expected to be built by 2022. Civil works to erect the building had been awarded to Hilmarcs Construction Corporation, the same company the Senate investigated for alleged overpriced construction of the Makati City Hall Parking Building II in 2015. The reception to the design was mixed, with some Filipino netizens comparing it to a garbage can. By early 2021, the New Senate Building&#x27;s construction was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines.

==Recent elections==
These are the two recent elections that determined the current membership of the 19th Congress of the Philippines.

<doc id="299522" wikidata="Q5231759" url="?curid=299522" title="David Brock">
<text>David Brock is an American liberal political consultant, author, and commentator who founded the media watchdog group Media Matters for America. He has been described by &quot;Time&quot; as &quot;one of the most influential operatives in the Democratic Party&quot;.

Brock began his career as a right-wing investigative reporter during the 1990s. He wrote the book &quot;The Real Anita Hill&quot; and the Troopergate story, which led to Paula Jones filing a lawsuit against Bill Clinton. In the late-1990s, he switched political sides, aligning himself with the Democratic Party and in particular with Bill and Hillary Clinton.

In 2004, he founded Media Matters for America, a non-profit organization which describes itself as a &quot;progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media&quot;. He has since also founded super PACs called American Bridge 21st Century and Correct the Record, has become a board member of the super PAC Priorities USA Action, advised The 65 Project, and has been elected chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Brock left Media Matters in November 2022. After leaving Media Matters, he founded Facts First USA, a 501(c)(4) group designed to counter Republican-led congressional investigations.

==Early life and education==

David Brock was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, and was adopted by Dorothea and Raymond Brock. He has a younger sister, Regina, who was also adopted. Brock was raised Catholic. His father, whom Brock has described as &quot;a Pat Buchanan conservative&quot;, was a marketing executive.

Brock grew up in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, where he went to Our Lady of the Assumption School, and later attended Paramus Catholic High School in Paramus, New Jersey. During his sophomore year of high school, Brock&#x27;s family moved to the Dallas, Texas, area where Brock attended Newman Smith High School. Brock became editor of his high school newspaper, which he says he &quot;fashioned into a crusading liberal weekly in the middle of the Reaganite Sunbelt&quot;.

Brock attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he graduated with a B.A. in history in 1985. He also worked as a reporter and editor for &quot;The Daily Californian&quot;, the campus newspaper. Brock arrived at college as a liberal Democrat, but at Berkeley he was &quot;repelled by the culture of doctrinaire leftism&quot; and turned to the political right. The turning point came with a column supporting the US invasion of Grenada that he wrote for &quot;The Daily Californian&quot; and that led to demands he resign from the newspaper staff. &quot;I thought it was McCarthyism of the left&quot;, Brock later said. &quot;I thought it was extremely intolerant.&quot; He then founded a neoconservative weekly, the &quot;Berkeley Journal&quot;.

==Journalism career==

===Conservative journalism===

While he was at Berkeley, Brock contributed an op-ed to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; entitled &quot;Combating Those Campus Marxists&quot;. It drew the attention of John Podhoretz, who at the time was the editor of &quot;Insight&quot;, a weekly newsmagazine published by &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. Podhoretz flew Brock to Washington, D.C., for an interview and hired him as a writer of the weekly conservative news magazine &quot;Insight on the News&quot;, a sister publication of &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, a job Brock took up in 1986. After working at &quot;Insight&quot;, Brock spent some time as a fellow at the Heritage Foundation.

===&quot;The Real Anita Hill&quot;===
In March 1992, in a 17,000-word article for &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, Brock challenged the claims of Anita Hill, who had accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Shortly thereafter Brock became a full-time staff member at that publication. In 1993, Brock expanded his article into a book, &quot;The Real Anita Hill&quot;. Brock&#x27;s description of Hill in the book as &quot;a bit nutty and a bit slutty&quot; was widely quoted.

The book became a best-seller. It was later attacked in a book review in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; by Jane Mayer, a reporter for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and Jill Abramson, who was at that time a reporter for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The two later expanded their article into the book &quot;Strange Justice&quot;, which cast Anita Hill in a much more sympathetic light. It, too, was a best-seller. Brock replied to their book with a book review of his own in &quot;The American Spectator&quot;. In that review, he asserted that Mayer and Abramson had no evidence to claim that Clarence Thomas was a habitual user of pornography. Later, in his book &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot;, he wrote, &quot;When I wrote those words, I knew they were false. I put a lie in print.&quot;

===Troopergate===
In a January 1994 &quot;The American Spectator&quot; story about Bill Clinton&#x27;s time as governor of Arkansas, Brock, by then on staff at the magazine, made accusations that bred Troopergate. Among other things, the story contained the first printed reference to Paula Jones, referring to a woman named &quot;Paula&quot; who state troopers said offered to be Clinton&#x27;s partner. Jones called Brock&#x27;s account of her encounter with Clinton &quot;totally wrong&quot;, and she later sued Clinton for sexual harassment, a case that became entangled in the independent counsel&#x27;s investigation of the Whitewater controversy, and set in motion a series of developments that led to the exposure of Clinton&#x27;s affair with Monica Lewinsky and, ultimately, to Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial. The story received an award later that year from Joseph Farah&#x27;s Western Journalism Center, and was partially responsible for a rise in the magazine&#x27;s circulation. Brock later recanted much of what he had written about Clinton and Jones.

===&quot;The Seduction of Hillary Rodham&quot;===
After the success of &quot;The Real Anita Hill&quot;, Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s then-conservative-focused Free Press subsidiary paid Brock a large advance to write a book about Hillary Clinton. The expectation was that it would be a takedown in the style of his writings on Anita Hill and Bill Clinton. The project took a different turn, and the resulting book, &quot;The Seduction of Hillary Rodham&quot;, proved to be largely sympathetic to Hillary Clinton. Given the large advance and tight one-year deadline by Free Press, Brock was under tremendous pressure to produce another bestseller. However, the book contained no major scoops. In &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot; (2002), Brock said that he had reached a turning point: he had thoroughly examined charges against the Clintons, could not find any evidence of wrongdoing, and did not want to make any more misleading claims. Brock further said that his former friends in right-wing politics shunned him because &quot;Seduction&quot; did not adequately attack the Clintons. &quot;National Review&quot; proposed another theory: since &quot;no liberal source in the world would talk to Brock&quot;, he could not collect the kind of information he was after. &quot;National Review&quot; also suggested that while writing the book, Brock had been &quot;seduced&quot; by Sidney Blumenthal, a champion and friend of the Clinton circle.

When the book came out, it was widely criticized for not breaking any new ground. John Balzar, reviewing the book in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, called it &quot;[e]xhaustive to the point of exhaustion&quot; and &quot;predictably critical but unexpectedly measured, at least in comparison to what Beltway gossips anticipated&quot;. James B. Stewart, reviewing the book in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that Brock had &quot;tried to do his subject justice in the broadest sense&quot; but added that &quot;[a]t times he goes too far&quot;, often &quot;echo[ing] her apologists&quot; and &quot;dismiss[ing] or rationaliz[ing] the sometimes powerful evidence that Hillary Rodham Clinton has lied ... by invoking a relativism rooted in Republican precedents.&quot;

==Changing sides==

&quot;The Nation&quot; has described Brock as a &quot;conservative journalistic assassin turned progressive empire-builder&quot;, while &quot;National Review&quot; has called him a &quot;right-wing assassin turned left-wing assassin&quot;, and &quot;Politico&quot; has profiled him as a &quot;former right-wing journalist-turned-pro-Clinton crusader&quot;. In July 1997, &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine published a confessional piece by Brock entitled &quot;Confessions of a Right-Wing Hit Man&quot; in which he recanted much of what he said in his two best-known &quot;American Spectator&quot; articles and criticized his own reporting methods. Discouraged at the reaction his Hillary Clinton biography received, he said, &quot;I ... want out. David Brock the Road Warrior of the Right is dead.&quot; Four months later, &quot;The American Spectator&quot; declined to renew his employment contract, under which he was being paid over $300,000 per year.

Writing again for &quot;Esquire&quot; in April 1998, Brock apologized to Clinton for his yellow journalism about Troopergate. In 2001, Brock accused one of his former sources, Terry Wooten, of leaking FBI files for use in his book about Anita Hill. Brock defended his betrayal of a confidential source by saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve concluded that what I was involved in wasn&#x27;t journalism, it was a political operation, and I was part of it. ... So I don&#x27;t think the normal rules of journalism would apply to what I was doing&quot;. Wooten denies the accusation.

=== &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot; ===
Brock&#x27;s book &quot;Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative&quot; was published in 2002. In this book, an &quot;outgrowth&quot; of &quot;Confessions of a Right-Wing Hit Man&quot;, Brock charted what the &quot;Daily Beast&quot; called his &quot;remarkable metamorphosis to ardent acolyte from sworn enemy of Bill and Hillary Clinton.&quot; Brock apologized for his attacks on the Clintons and Anita Hill and claimed that he had now risen above character assassination. He wrote that he had been &quot;a mad dog, an emotional monster&quot;, &quot;a whore for the cash&quot;, &quot;a Jew in Hitler&#x27;s army&quot;, and &quot;a witting cog in the Republican sleaze machine&quot;, and asserted that he hadn&#x27;t known &quot;what good reporting was&quot;.

Many critics responded with skepticism to Brock&#x27;s claim to have reformed himself. The reviewer for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Brock &quot;quotes the worst things critics said about him, and agrees with every word&quot;. Christopher Hitchens, in &quot;The Nation&quot;, called Brock&#x27;s book &quot;an exercise in self-love, disguised as an exercise in self-abnegation&quot;, and declared that Brock was failing to state the truth. These and other critics noted that Brock, while claiming to feel remorse for his attacks on the Clintons and professing to have put personal assaults behind him, now seemed as eager to go after targets on the right as he had once gone after targets on the left. Hitchens responded with disgust, for example, to Brock&#x27;s &quot;coarse attack&quot; in the book on Juanita Broaddrick, who had accused Bill Clinton of rape, but denied the rape under oath. Hitchens was particularly harsh, stating that Brock &quot;inserts a completely gratuitous slander against a decent woman, all of whose independent assertions have survived meticulous fact-checking&quot;.

Many readers on the left greeted the book with enthusiasm, and eagerly welcomed Brock. This was especially true of the Clintons. Shortly after the book&#x27;s publication, Bill Clinton phoned Brock at home and praised it lavishly. Later, according to &quot;Politico&quot;, &quot;Brock was invited to the former president&#x27;s Harlem office where he was shocked to discover Clinton had purchased dozens of copies — and stuffed them into a big cabinet&quot;. Clinton, it turned out, was mailing them to friends across the country. Clinton &quot;insisted&quot; that Brock contact his speaking agent and give talks around the country attacking conservatives. According to &quot;The Nation&quot;, Democratic donors &quot;loved Brock&#x27;s conversion story, particularly since he&#x27;d been inside the machine they hoped to replicate.&quot; Brock&#x27;s book is seen as having propelled him into a favorable position among the Democratic Party establishment.

===&quot;The Republican Noise Machine&quot;===
Brock directly addressed the right-wing &quot;machine&quot; in his 2004 book, &quot;The Republican Noise Machine&quot;, in which he detailed an alleged interconnected, concerted effort to raise the profile of conservative opinions in the press through false accusations of liberal media bias, dishonest and highly partisan columnists, partisan news organizations and academic studies, and other methods. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; (&quot;PW&quot;) described it as a &quot;blistering j&#x27;accuse&quot; that, compared to &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot;, was &quot;a less gossipy and more systematic assault on the right-wing media juggernaut.&quot; According to &quot;PW&quot;, Brock depicted the mainstream media as being &quot;cowed by spurious charges of &#x27;liberal bias&#x27;&quot; and as therefore having &quot;abandoned their role as objective arbiters of truth in favor of an uncritical airing of partisan ideology in the name of &#x27;balance.&#x27;&quot; &quot;PW&quot; stated that Brock could not &quot;be accused of nonpartisanship&quot;. Also in 2004, he featured briefly in the BBC series &quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot;, where he stated that the Arkansas Project engaged in political terrorism.

==Political operative career==

===Media Matters for America===
In 2004, Brock founded the progressive media watchdog group Media Matters for America (MMA) which describes itself as being &quot;dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.&quot; Brock said that he founded the organization to combat the conservative journalism sector that he had once been a part of. He founded the group with help from the Center for American Progress. Initial donors included Leo Hindery, Susie Tompkins Buell, and James Hormel. Media Matters is known for its aggressive criticism of conservative journalists and media outlets, including its &quot;War on Fox News&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in a 2008 profile, called MMA &quot;a highly partisan research organization&quot; and quoted Democratic operative James Carville as saying that MMA was &quot;more effective than any single entity&quot; on the left. Pollster Frank Luntz called MMA &quot;one of the most destructive organizations associated with American politics today.&quot; In a 2011 interview with &quot;Politico&quot;, Brock vowed to wage &quot;guerrilla warfare and sabotage&quot; against Fox News.

When Brock proposed the idea of Media Matters, Hillary Clinton invited him to the Clintons&#x27; Chappaqua home to pitch the idea to potential donors. MMA, according to a 2015 article in &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, &quot;operates from a posh Washington office space with a multi-million-dollar budget and nearly 100 employees.&quot; In 2014, &quot;The Nation&quot; stated that &quot;Brock, in partnership with fundraiser Mary Pat Bonner—often described as his secret weapon—has turned out to be unparalleled at maintaining rich liberals&#x27; loyalty and support.&quot; An insider told &quot;The Nation&quot; that Brock and Bonner &quot;are probably the most effective major-individual-donor fundraising team ever assembled in the independent-expenditure progressive world.&quot;

It was reported in June 2015 that when the House Select Committee on Benghazi questioned Sidney Blumenthal, committee members asked no fewer than 45 questions about Brock and Media Matters. The committee was reportedly interested in Sidney Blumenthal&#x27;s paid work for Brock&#x27;s nonprofits, and in the question of &quot;whether Blumenthal and Brock did anything improper as they helped Clinton manage the political fallout from the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, while she was secretary of State.&quot;

===Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2008 campaign===

Brock was active in Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign for the presidency in 2008.

===American Bridge 21st Century===
Brock announced in 2010 that he was forming a Super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century, to help elect liberal Democrats, starting with the 2012 election cycle. In 2011, Brock founded the PAC, which seeks &quot;to track every utterance of every major GOP candidate&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described him as having &quot;reinvented the art of opposition research&quot;. The group&#x27;s work reportedly &quot;did so much damage to Republicans in the 2012 elections&quot; that they sought to replicate Brock&#x27;s efforts. In describing Brock&#x27;s intentions for the super-PAC, &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to Brock as a &quot;prominent Democratic political operative&quot;, and &quot;New York&quot; magazine referred to Brock&#x27;s &quot;hyperpartisanship&quot;.

The group had more than 80 staffers as of 2014. It has researchers based in Washington, D.C., plus &quot;a national network of professional trackers&quot; who follow the moves and statements of every conceivable contender for the Republican nomination. &quot;The Nation&quot; has described American Bridge as &quot;the natural next step&quot; after MMA, explaining that &quot;Brock took the Media Matters method—which involves monitoring virtually every word uttered by the right-wing media—and transferred it to the realm of Republican politicians.&quot; Democratic operative Paul Begala told &quot;The Nation&quot; that in 2012 American Bridge &quot;produced for us a 950-page book of every business deal of Mitt Romney&#x27;s career. We spent something like $65 million [2012 election], and I believe every single ad was in some ways informed by Brock&#x27;s research.&quot;

===Correct the Record===
In late 2013 Brock founded Correct the Record, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as Hillary Clinton&#x27;s &quot;own personal media watchdog&quot;, keeping track of all negative news surrounding her. Brock had first come up with the idea for the group that summer. &quot;Having left the State Department,&quot; he said, &quot;Clinton didn&#x27;t have the kind of robust operation that one would have if one was holding public office. That&#x27;s where I saw the need.&quot; The organization, whose staff &quot;is crammed into a newsroom-style bullpen in the back corner of the offices of American Bridge 21st Century&quot;, &quot;keeps constant watch for any conceivable attacks against her, and then aggressively beats them back before they take hold.&quot; In September 2015, Brock and Correct the Record produced a piece on Bernie Sanders, linking him to Hugo Chávez and British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.

===Priorities USA Action===
In early 2014, Brock was named to the board of Priorities USA Action as the super PAC also announced its support for a possible Hillary Clinton presidential run in 2016. In February 2015, Brock abruptly resigned his position with the super PAC. In his resignation letter, he accused Priorities officials of conducting &quot;an orchestrated political hit job&quot; against MMA and American Bridge. &quot;The New York Times&quot; had run an article questioning his groups&#x27; fundraising practices, and he charged that &quot;current and former Priorities officials were behind this specious and malicious attack on the integrity of these critical organizations.&quot; His resignation &quot;set off panic among influential Democrats&quot;, because his other groups&#x27; research &quot;provides the foundation for the multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns created with Priorities cash&quot; and because &quot;key Priorities donors have long-standing personal ties with him.&quot; Brock was persuaded to return to Priorities later in 2015.

===The American Democracy Legal Fund===

Brock also founded and runs the American Democracy Legal Fund, a nonprofit that has been accused of existing solely to create &quot;a steady stream of lawsuits accusing Republicans of ethics and campaign finance violations.&quot;

===American Independent Institute===
In 2014, Brock relaunched the American Independent News Network, formerly a network of progressive state-based reporting outlets, into the American Independent Institute, a group which provides grants for liberal investigative journalism projects. Brock serves as the group&#x27;s president. The institute finances journalists &quot;investigating rightwing activities&quot;. In 2014, it gave $320,000 in grants &quot;to reporters investigating right-wing misdeeds&quot;.

===CREW===
In 2014, Brock became the chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington board of directors, in what was characterized as a more explicitly partisan stance for the organization. Brock was elected as CREW&#x27;s board president after laying out a broad plan to turn the organization into a more muscular and partisan organization. &quot;Politico&quot; described this as &quot;a major power play that aligns liberal muscle more fully behind the Democratic Party — and Hillary Clinton&quot; and said that Brock had set forth a plan &quot;to turn the group into a more muscular — and likely partisan — attack dog.&quot;

While CREW operates as a 501(c)3 nonprofit prohibited from engaging in partisan activity, Brock made clear he intends to create a more politically oriented arm registered under section 501(c)4, and also form a new overtly partisan watchdog group called The American Democracy Legal Fund registered under section 527, allowing it to engage in direct political activity. Along with Brock&#x27;s election, consultant David Mercer and investor Wayne Jordan joined CREW&#x27;s board of directors. When asked if CREW would still continue pursuing complaints against Democrats, Brock responded, &quot;No party has a monopoly on corruption and at this early juncture, we are not making categorical statements about anything that we will and won&#x27;t do. Having said that, our experience has been that the vast amount of violations of the public trust can be found on the conservative side of the aisle.&quot;

=== &quot;Killing the Messenger&quot; ===

In his 2015 book &quot;Killing the Messenger: The Right-Wing Plot to Derail Hillary Clinton and Hijack Your Government&quot;, Brock described &quot;how the Clintons quickly switched from prey to patrons, setting him on his current path as a fundraiser and progressive provocateur.&quot; In the book, Brock accused &quot;The New York Times&quot; of being a &quot;megaphone for conservative propaganda&quot; directed inordinately at Clinton. He was particularly critical of the &quot;Times&#x27;s&quot; senior politics editor and former Washington bureau chief Carolyn Ryan. At the same time, in the words of &quot;Politico&quot;, he depicted Bill and Hillary Clinton &quot;as personal and political angels&quot;.

Calling the book a &quot;trenchant j&#x27;accuse&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said that parts of it &quot;read like a fund-raising prospectus&quot; for MMA but concluded that while &quot;Brock&#x27;s rhetorical venom and naked partisanship will alienate some readers ... his sharp-eyed reporting makes for a spirited challenge to business-as-usual political discourse.&quot; &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; described the book as &quot;partly a sanitized summary of Brock&#x27;s already exhaustively-chronicled personal history, partly an attack on the journalism establishment, and partly a call to arms on behalf of his favorite presidential candidate.&quot;

Hanna Rosin wrote that it reads like &quot;pages that bullet-point Hillary&#x27;s accomplishments as secretary of state or the achievements of the Clinton Foundation.&quot; Rosin alleged that the book attempted to whitewash any criticisms surrounding the Clintons. Rosin stated: &quot;So dogged is Brock&#x27;s devotion to Hillary that it often gets in the way of his being credible, not to mention interesting.&quot; Responding to Brock&#x27;s criticism of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the newspaper, told CNN: &quot;David Brock is an opportunist and a partisan who specializes in personal attacks.&quot; Murphy complained that Brock&#x27;s &quot;partisanship has led him to lash out at some of our aggressive coverage of important political figures and it&#x27;s unsurprising that he has now turned personal.&quot;

In October 2015, Brock gave a presentation at Georgetown University entitled &quot;Is the Mainstream Media in Cahoots with Conservatives?&quot;.

===Purchase of &quot;Blue Nation Review&quot;===

In 2015, Brock formed an investment venture, True Blue Media, to purchase an 80 percent stake in &quot;Blue Nation Review&quot;, an online news website. &quot;Blue Nation Review&quot; was later re-branded as &quot;Shareblue&quot;.

===Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 campaign===

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; has described Brock as &quot;integral to Hillary&#x27;s run&quot; for the presidency in 2016. Clinton adviser Paul Bagela commented: &quot;What kind of a movement would we be if we rejected converts? He saw the permanent intellectual and ideological infrastructure they have on the right and brought it to the left.&quot; A March 6, 2015, article in &quot;National Review&quot; noted that while other &quot;Democratic kingmakers&quot; were &quot;in retreat&quot; in the wake of the news that Hillary Clinton had &quot;used a private e-mail account on a private server to avoid public scrutiny while secretary of state&quot;, Brock remained fiercely loyal. Appearing on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; in 2015, Brock insisted that Clinton had violated no rules by using a private email server. It was reported on September 1, 2015, that a batch of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s emails that had been made public included one from Brock entitled &quot;Memo on Impeaching Clarence Thomas&quot;. In the memo, Brock discussed possible ways of trying to bring down the Supreme Court justice whose cause he had championed in &quot;The Real Anita Hill&quot;.

&quot;Politico&quot; reported in January 2016 that Brock was preparing a new advertisement that would call on presidential candidate Bernie Sanders &quot;to release his medical records before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.&quot; Brock was subjected to a storm of criticism for this plan, and only hours after Politico&#x27;s report, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta scolded Brock on Twitter. Later in January, Brock responded to a Sanders campaign ad by telling the Associated Press: &quot;From this ad, it seems black lives don&#x27;t matter much to Bernie Sanders&quot;, Sanders aides responded by accusing Brock of &quot;mudslinging&quot;. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement: &quot;Bernie Sanders, as everyone knows, has one of the strongest civil rights records in Congress. He doesn&#x27;t need lectures on civil rights and racial issues from David Brock, the head of a Hillary Clinton Super Pac.&quot; Briggs added: &quot;Twenty-five years ago it was Brock – a mud-slinging, right-wing extremist – who tried to destroy Anita Hill, a distinguished African American law professor. He later was forced to apologize for his lies about her. Today, he is lying about Sen Sanders. It&#x27;s bad enough that Hillary Clinton is raising millions in special-interest money in her Super Pacs. It is worse that she would hire a mudslinger like David Brock.&quot;

At a campaign event in Iowa in late January 2016, Bernie Sanders denied any plans to &quot;bus in out-of-state college students to caucus for him&quot;, charging that this was a lie and attributing it to Brock. On February 8, 2016, after the near-tie in the Iowa caucuses between Clinton and Sanders, Brock told &quot;Politico&quot; that &quot;Senator Sanders is trying to live in the purity bubble, and it needs to be burst.&quot; He described Sanders&#x27;s efforts to link Clinton to Wall Street as an &quot;artful smear&quot;, and, in a reference to the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s passing of data to the Sanders campaign the previous December, said that Clinton &quot;would&#x27;ve been hounded out of the race if her staff had done what his did, in stealing data and misleading the press about it, then raising money off it.&quot; Clinton&#x27;s campaign, Brock insisted, &quot;has stayed remarkably positive in the face of a relentlessly negative campaign from Sanders.&quot; As for Sanders&#x27;s platform, Brock maintained that &quot;a unanimous chorus of serious progressive commentators ... find almost nothing of any substantive value in his so-called policies.&quot;

=== Activism to bring forth sexual assault allegations ===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in December 2017 that a group founded by Brock had spent $200,000 in an unsuccessful effort to bring forward accusations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential race. He was reportedly considering doing the same to congressional Republicans.

==Personal life==
Brock was formerly in a long-term relationship with James Alefantis. On March 22, 2017, Brock suffered a heart attack while at work at Media Matters headquarters.

==Reception==
Paul Ryan, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, considered complaining about Brock to the Federal Election Commission and Justice Department, charging that he was &quot;creating new ways to undermine campaign regulation.&quot; He was referencing Brock&#x27;s simultaneous involvement with Correct the Record, American Bridge, and Priorities USA Action since the first two groups worked closely with Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign, while Priorities USA Action, the largest Democratic Party super PAC, is legally prohibited from doing so. Brock claimed to have stopped working directly with American Bridge, although its staffers continued to operate out of his office.

In 2001, Jonah Goldberg wrote in &quot;National Review&quot; that while Brock has been &quot;hailed by liberals for &#x27;coming clean,&#x27; they would never really trust him.&quot; He quoted reporter Jill Abramson as having said that &quot;the problem with Brock&#x27;s credibility&quot; is that &quot;once you admit you&#x27;ve knowingly written false things, how do you know when to believe what he writes?&quot; Similarly, &quot;The Guardian&quot; referred in 2014 to &quot;residual unease among some liberal operatives that Brock&#x27;s conversion story fits into a pattern of opportunism and self-promotion rather than ideological transformation.&quot; Observing in 2015 that Brock had admitted to mudslinging before, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; noted a difficulty in dispatching fears he would do it again. Brock&#x27;s claim that the Clintons have never committed any wrongdoing has received criticisms from many, including fellow Democrats, who have cited instances of abuse.

Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks criticized Brock&#x27;s negative coverage of the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign, specifically the alleged invention of the &quot;Bernie Bro&quot; controversy. Uygur said that Brock&#x27;s January 10, 2017, open letter of apology to Sanders and his voters, was disingenuous because it was motivated by a desire to raise money from wealthy Democratic donors and to foster a perception of himself as being a member of the U.S. progressive movement.

<doc id="299526" wikidata="Q2143048" url="?curid=299526" title="Mamre">
<text>Mamre (; ), full name &quot;Oaks of Mamre&quot;, refers to an ancient religious site originally focused on a single holy tree growing &quot;since time immemorial&quot; at Hebron in Canaan. At its first location, Khirbet Nimra, a pagan tree cult predated the biblical narrative. It is best known from the biblical story of Abraham and the three visitors. The tree under which he had pitched his tent is known as the oak or terebinth of Mamre. Modern scholars have identified three sites near Hebron which, in different historical periods, have been successively known as Mamre: Khirbet Nimra (a little excavated Persian and Hellenistic period site), Ramat el-Khalil (the best known site, flourished from the Herodian through the Byzantine period), and Khirbet es-Sibte. The last one contained an old oak tree identified by a relatively new tradition as the Oak of Mamre, which has collapsed in 2019, and is on the grounds of a Russian Orthodox monastery.

Jewish-Roman historian Josephus, as well as Christian and Jewish sources from the Byzantine period, locate Mamre at the site later renamed in Arabic as Ramat el-Khalil, 4 km north of historical Hebron and approximately halfway between that city and Halhul. Herod the Great apparently initiated the Jewish identification of the site with Mamre, by erecting there a monumental enclosure. It was one of the three most important &quot;fairs&quot; or market places in Judea, where the fair was held next to the venerated tree, accompanied by an interdenominational festival joined in time by Jews, pagans, and Christians. This prompted Emperor Constantine the Great to unsuccessfully attempt at putting a stop to this practice by erecting a Christian basilica there.

==Hebrew Bible==
===Names and events===
Mamre is the site where Abraham pitched the tents for his camp, built an altar (), and was brought divine tidings, in the guise of three angels, of Sarah&#x27;s pregnancy ().

Genesis 13:18 has Abraham settling by &#x27;the great trees of Mamre&#x27;. The original Hebrew tradition appears, to judge from a textual variation conserved in the Septuagint, to have referred to a single great oak tree, which Josephus called Ogyges. Mamre may have been an Amorite, a tribal chieftain after whom a grove of trees was named. Genesis connected it with Hebron or a place nearby that city. Mamre has frequently been associated with the Cave of the Patriarchs. According to one scholar, there is considerable confusion in the Biblical narrative concerning not only Mamre, but also Machpelah, Hebron and Kiryat Arba, all four of which are aligned repeatedly. In Genesis, Mamre is also identified with Hebron itself (). The Christian tradition of identifying a ruined site surrounded by walls and called in Arabic &quot;Rāmet el-Ḥalīl&quot; (&#x27;Hill of the Friend&#x27;, meaning: &quot;the friend of God&quot;, i.e. Abraham), with the Old Testament Mamre, goes back to the earliest Christian pilgrims in the 4th century CE, and connects to a tradition from the time of Herod (1st century BCE).

Elsewhere () it is called &#x27;the Terebinths of Mamre the Amorite&#x27;, Mamre being the name of one of the three Amorite chiefs who joined forces with those of Abraham in pursuit of Chedorlaomer to save Lot (Gen. 14:13, 24).

The supposed discrepancy is often explained as reflecting the discordance between the different scribal traditions behind the composition of the Pentateuch, the former relating to the Yahwist, the latter to the Elohist recension, according to the classic formulation of the documentary hypothesis.

==Identification==
There appear to be three main sites which have been known, at different times in history, as Mamre. These are, chronologically:
#Khirbet Nimra, an archaeological site next to Hebron and 2,5 km north of Ramat el-Khalil, identified as the Persian- and Hellenistic-period Mamre.
#Ramat el-Khalil, also spelled Ramet el-Khulil, is the site identified as Mamre in the time of King Herod (1st century BCE), Constantine the Great (4th century CE), and – strongly contested by some – the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (12th–13th centuries CE). Talmudic sources refer to the site as Beth Ilanim or Botnah. The ruins of the Herodian and Constantinian structure became also known in Arabic as Beit el-Khalil, meaning &quot;Abraham&#x27;s House&quot;.
#Khirbet es-Sibte (also Ain Sebta), the present-day site of the so-called Oak of Mamre, 2 km southwest of Ramat el-Khalil, has been considered since the 19th century by Christians to be the place where Abraham saw the angels. A modern Russian Orthodox monastery is marking the site.

==History and archaeology==

===Khirbet Nimra: Persian and Hellenistic Mamre===
According to Jericke among others, Persian and Hellenistic Mamre was located at Khirbet Nimra, 1 km north of modern Hebron, where a pagan tree cult supposedly, predates the biblical account of the Abraham. 

===Ramat el-Khalil===
====Research and analysis====
The archaeological site of Ramat el-Khalil (Grid Ref. 160300/107200) was first excavated by in 1926–1928, followed by Sayf al-Din Haddad (1977), &#x27;Abd el-Aziz Arjub (1984–1985), and Yitzhak Magen (1986–1988), Magen publishing his findings in 1991 and 2003. Greenberg &amp; Keinan, summarising previous dig reports, list the outstanding components of the site as being a large Roman-era enclosure, a Byzantine church, and a Crusader church. However, Denys Pringle&#x27;s analysis of both historical and archaeological sources leads to the firm conclusion that the Crusader-era Church of the Trinity, mentioned by medieval pilgrims, stood at the foot of a hill, not at its top, and certainly not at Ramat el-Khalil, where the remains of the Constantinian church were found undisturbed by any later building in 1926. Greenberg &amp; Keinan are listing the main periods of settlement as: Early Roman, Late Roman, Byzantine, and Crusader, with less substantial findings from the Iron Age IIc and the Hellenistic period. However, Yitzhak Magen, the last to excavate the site, claims that findings previously attributed to the biblical time of the Kings during the Iron Age, and the Hellenistic Hasmoneans, are in fact of far newer date, Byzantine or later.

====Bronze Age====
Early Bronze Age pottery sherds found at the Ramat el-Khalil site may indicate that a cultic shrine of some kind was in use from 2600–2000 BCE, but there is no archaeological evidence for the site being occupied from the first half of the second millennium down to the end of the Iron Age – that is, very broadly speaking, between 2000 and 600 BCE.

====Herod: the enclosure====
Herod the Great transferred the Mamre tradition 2.5 km to the north, from the site at Khirbet Nimra (see above) to the site at Ramet el-Khalil. This was part of Herod&#x27;s upgrade of Hebron as a cult centre dedicated to the patriarch Abraham, by erecting two shrines: one at Abraham&#x27;s tomb, and one at a site he connected to his place of residence, where the patriarch dined under a tree together with the three men. It has been noted that Hebron and Mamre were located in Idumaean territory, that both Jews and Idumaeans regarded Abraham as their common ancestor, and that Herod came from an Idumaean family that had only recently converted to Judaism.

The 2 m thick stone wall enclosing an area 49 m wide and 65 m long was constructed by Herod, possibly as a cultic place of worship. It contained an ancient well, more than 5 m in diameter, referred to as Abraham&#x27;s Well.

====Josephus: the terebinth====
:Josephus&#x27;s terebinth tree is distinct from the modern Oak of Mamre and stood at a different location
Josephus (37 – c. 100) records a tradition according to which the terebinth at Mamre was as old as the world itself (&quot;War&quot; 4.534). The site was soaked in legend. Jews, Christians and Pagans made sacrifices on the site, burning animals, and the tree was considered immune to the flames of the sacrifices. Constantine the Great (r. 302–337) was still attempting, without success, to stop this tradition.

====Late Roman period: Hadrian&#x27;s temple====
The Herodian structure was destroyed by Simon bar Kokhba&#x27;s army, only to be rebuilt by the Roman emperor Hadrian. Hadrian revived the fair, which had long been an important one as it took place at an intersection forming the transport and communications nub of the southern Judean mountains. This &quot;&quot; (Heb. &quot;yerid&quot; or &quot;shuq&quot;: ) or &quot;fair, market&quot; was one of the sites, according to a Jewish tradition conserved in Jerome, chosen by Hadrian to sell remnants of Bar Kochba&#x27;s defeated army into slavery. Jerome, in his commentary on Jeremiah, writes:But some of the &quot;Iudaei&quot; attach to this place the meaning that, after Jerusalem had been captured under Vespasian, along this road, to Gaza and Alexandria, endless thousands of captives were sent on the way to Rome. But others, that, at the final captivity under Hadrian, when the city of Jerusalem was destroyed, an innumerable crowd of various ages and both sexes was sold in the market at the Terebinth; and therefore it is hateful for Jews that this much-frequented market should flourish.

====Rabbinical tradition====
Due to the idolatrous nature of the rituals at the fair, Jews were forbidden to participate by their rabbis. According to the Jerusalem Talmud:
They prohibited a fair only in the case of one of the character of that at Botnah. As it has been taught along these same lines in a Tannaitic tradition. &quot;There are three fairs, the fair at Gaza, the fair at Acre, and the fair at Botnah, and the most debased of the lot of them is the fair of Botnah.&quot;

====Late Roman festival and Byzantine basilica====
Eusebius and Sozomen describe how, notwithstanding the rabbinic ban, by the time of Constantine the Great&#x27;s reign (302–337), the market had become an informal interdenominational festival, in addition to its functions as a trade fair, frequented by Christians, Jews and pagans. The cultic shrine was made over for Christian use after Eutropia, Constantine&#x27;s mother-in-law, visited it and was scandalised by its pagan character. Constantine, informed of these pagan practices, attempted without success to put an end to the festive rituals celebrated around the tree. He angrily wrote to Macarius, bishop of Jerusalem and all the other bishops of Palestine and admonished them, letting them know that he had ordered the &quot;comes&quot; Acacius to destroy all pagan idols and punish those holding on to pagan practices. The enclosure was then consecrated, Constantine had a basilica built, dedicated to Saint George (its foundations are still visible), and the enclosure of the Terebinth of Mamre roofed over.

The 1957 plan and reconstruction of the site made after the excavation performed by German scholar A. E. Mader in 1926–1928, shows the Constantinian basilica along the eastern wall of the &quot;Haram Ramet el-Khalil&quot; enclosure, with a well, altar, and tree in the unroofed western part of the enclosure.

The venerated tree was destroyed by Christian visitors taking souvenirs, leaving only a stump which survived down to the seventh century.

The fifth-century account by Sozomen (&quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; Book II 4-54) is the most detailed account of the practices at Mamre during the early Christian period.
A vignette of the Constantinian basilica with its colonnaded atrium appears on the 6th-century Madaba Map, under the partially preserved Greek caption &quot;Arbo, also the Terebinth. The Oak of Mambre&quot;.

Antoninus of Piacenza in his &quot;Itinerarium&quot;, an account of his journey to the Holy Land (ca.570 CE) comments on the basilica, with its four porticoes, and an unroofed atrium. Both Christians and Jews worshipped there, separated by a small screen (&quot;cancellus&quot;). The Jewish worshippers would flock there to celebrate the deposition of Jacob and David on the day after the traditional date of Christ&#x27;s birthday.

The Constantinian basilica was destroyed during the Persian invasion of 614.

====Early Muslim period====
Arculf, a Frankish bishop who toured the Levant in around 670–680, witnessed the monastery still being active around 670, a few decades after Umar&#x27;s conquest. He reported, indicating a slightly erroneous location in relation to the Tombs of the Patriarchs:
A mile to the north of the Tombs that have been described above, is the very grassy and flowery hill of Mambre, looking towards Hebron, which lies to the south of it. This little mountain, which is called Mambre, has a level summit, at the north side of which a great stone church has been built, in the right side of which between the two walls of this great Basilica, the Oak of Mambre, wonderful to relate, stands rooted in the earth; it is also called the oak of Abraham, because under it he once hospitably received the Angels. St. Hieronymus elsewhere relates, that this tree had existed from the beginning of the world to the reign of the Emperor Constantine; but he did not say that it had utterly perished, perhaps because at that time, although the whole of that vast tree was not to be seen as it had been formerly, yet a spurious trunk still remained rooted in the ground, protected under the roof of the church, of the height of two men; from this wasted spurious trunk, which has been cut on all sides by axes, small chips are carried to the different provinces of the world, on account of the veneration and memory of that oak, under which, as has been mentioned above, that famous and notable visit of the Angels was granted to the patriarch Abraham.

====Crusader period====
Yitzhak Magen was in 1993 of the opinion that during the Crusades, the site may have been used by a Church of the Trinity. Denys Pringle firmly refutes this possibility, based on the analysis of pilgrims&#x27; reports.

Avraham Negev considers the last clear identification and description of the Byzantine church remains at Ramat el-Khalil to come from the Russian pilgrim known as Abbot Daniel, who visited the site in 1106/8, and he qualifies other medieval reports from the 12th century onwards as not clear with regard to the location of the site they describe.

===After 1150s: different Jewish and Christian locations===
After the middle of the 12th century the reports become vague and the location of &quot;Abraham&#x27;s Oak&quot; seems to have migrated to one or more locations situated on the road connecting Ramat el-Khalil with Hebron. What is nowadays considered the traditional location of the Oak of Abraham is a site originally known in Arabic as Ain Sebta, which used to be outside historical Hebron but is now within the urban sprawl of the Palestinian city.

As written in a footnote from an 1895 publication of Arculf&#x27;s pilgrimage report,
The Oak or Terebinth of Abraham has been shown in two different sites. Arculf and many others (Jerome, Itin[erarium] Hierosol[ymitanum], Sozomen, Eucherius [possibly Eucherius of Lyon], Benjamin of Tudela, the Abbot Daniel... etc.) seem to point to the ruin of er Râmeh, near which is Beit el Khulil, or Abraham&#x27;s House, with a fine spring well. This is still held by the Jews to be the Oak of Mamre. The Christians point to another site, Ballûtet Sebta, where [there] is a fine specimen of Sindian (Quercus Pseudococcifera).&quot; &quot;Ballut&quot; is the Arabic word for oak.

==Ramat el-Khalil today==
The Palestinian authorities have made the site accessible to visitors under the name Haram Ramat Al Khalil.

Since, in Islam, the Kaaba in Mecca is sacred as the &quot;house of Ibrahim/Abraham&quot; (see Qur&#x27;an 2:125), his tradition of hospitality has also moved to that city, and under Muslim rule Mamre has lost its historical significance as an inter-religious place of worship and festivity. The site was excavated by 20th-century Christian and Jewish archaeologists, and a 2015 initiative by the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism, joined by the UN and youth belonging to all three communities in the area—Muslim, Jewish, and Christian—restored the site for visitors and built a new &quot;meeting centre&quot;. However, as of 2019, the centre had not yet been opened and the site itself doesn&#x27;t see much traffic.
