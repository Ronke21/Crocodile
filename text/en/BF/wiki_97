<text>Dospat Reservoir () is situated in the western part of the Rhodope Mountains, Bulgaria. The reservoir (formed by a dam in the town of Dospat, west of Smolyan) stretches nearly northwest to the city of Sarnitsa. At above the sea level, it is one of the highest dams in Bulgaria in terms of altitude, and, with its of water area, the second largest in capacity. It is fed by the Dospat River.

The dam, which creates the lake, is built for hydroelectricity generation as part of the Dospat–Vacha Hydropower Cascade (500.2 MW). There is no hydroelectric power plant (HPP) installed at the dam but rather the water is taken to the Teshel HPP and then further down the Devin HPP and the Vacha River with its power plants, dams and reservoirs (Tsankov Kamak HPP, Vacha Reservoir, Krichim Reservoir, Vacha II HPP, Krichim HPP and Vacha I HPP). Besides that, a minimum of is constantly released for sanitation of the Dospat River riverbed where the average input to the reservoir is .

The flora and fauna around the reservoir are diverse and the geography offers breathtaking sights. Old coniferous forests surround the lake. On the northern bank, the town of Sarnitsa and Krushata neighborhood are located. The terrain is hilly, with meadows and arable land available, used for grazing, potato growing and other agricultural activities. Parallel to the south bank are steep slopes covered in spruce and this bank is where most holiday cabins and hotels are located.

The reservoir is rich in fish. It is stocked with perch, trout (rainbow, brown, brook), carp, European chub, common rudd, common roach, pumpkinseed, wels catfish, Danube Bleak and various members of &quot;Carassius&quot;. Trout are reared in cages within the reservoir. Most types of fishing are practiced: spinning with lures, fly fishing, and others.

In the surrounding areas there are a number of other large dams, including Vacha, Golyam Beglik, Batak and Shiroka Polyana. The area offers great opportunities for recreation and tourism.

Accessibility is, however, rather poor. Four main mountain roads link the reservoir to the rest of the world. One from Batak, a second from Velingrad to Sarnitsa, a third from Devin and a fourth from Gotse Delchev to the town of Dospat. The one from Batak allows accessibility to some of the other Rhodope dams along its length. It forks into two roads; one leading to the town of Dospat and the other to Sarnitsa. This road to Sarnitsa is in places very rutted and may prove a challenge to navigate. Along the south bank there runs a rough dirt track from Sarnitsa to Dospat but this is only used to access the holiday spots.

<doc id="307112" wikidata="Q7079498" url="?curid=307112" title="Official Code of Georgia Annotated">
<text>The Official Code of Georgia Annotated or OCGA is the compendium of all laws in the state of Georgia. Like other state codes in the United States, its legal interpretation is subject to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Code, the Code of Federal Regulations, and the state&#x27;s constitution. It is to the state what the U.S. Code is to the federal government.

An unusual feature of the &quot;OCGA&quot; is that, as stated in section 1-1-1, the privately prepared code annotations are officially merged into the official copy and are published under the authority of the state. The state held that it retained sole copyright in the code and that the authorized publisher held copyright to the annotations, though the laws of the state were the combination of the code and the annotations. Thus, the publisher would charge for reproductions of the &quot;OCGA&quot;, with a portion of the fee being returned to the state as a licensing fee. This longstanding feature goes back to the Code of 1872. In 2018, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals held that the OCGA is not copyrightable, and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that holding in April 2020.

==History==
The &quot;OCGA&quot; is the descendant of the first successfully enacted attempt in any English-speaking jurisdiction at a comprehensive codification of the substance of the common law, the Code of Georgia of 1861. The enactment of the Code predated the enactment of civil codes in 1866 in Dakota Territory and 1872 in California based on the work of New York-based law reformer David Dudley Field II. In 1889, Field expressly conceded that point in a written article; he credited his lack of awareness of the contemporaneous Georgia project &quot;to the breaking out of the Civil War.&quot;

Unlike the relatively race-neutral Field civil code, large portions of the original Code of Georgia were drafted by the pro-slavery Confederate lawyer Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb, so that the Code was shot through with Cobb&#x27;s strong bias in favor of slavery and white supremacy. For example, as originally enacted, it contained a presumption that blacks were &quot;prima facie&quot; slaves until proven otherwise. After the Civil War (in which Cobb died at the Battle of Fredericksburg), the Code had to be heavily revised in 1867 to eliminate portions that were obviously incompatible with the Thirteenth Amendment. The Code has been further revised and reenacted many times since.

==Copyrightability==

In 2013 the State of Georgia, specifically the Georgia Code Revision Commission, threatened to sue Carl Malamud for copyright infringement over the posting of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated on the website Public.Resource.Org. In 2015, the State of Georgia filed a copyright infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia. The State of Georgia claimed a copyright in the Code, and that Carl Malamud and Public.Resource.Org had violated that copyright. Public.Resource.Org claimed that since the state has chosen to make the Official Code of Georgia Annotated the official and authoritative code of the entire state, the Code should not be subject to copyright law, and should be freely available for all citizens to read and access. The Code also holds, in denoting the &quot;annotated&quot; code as the &quot;official code,&quot; that authorship and copyright remains with the State and not with the publisher.

In October 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, is not copyrightable. The Code Revision Commission, established by the Georgia General Assembly, appealed this decision to the United States Supreme Court. The Court heard the oral arguments on December 2, 2019. The case, &quot;Georgia v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc.&quot;, decided the question:Whether the government edicts doctrine extends to – and thus renders uncopyrightable – works that lack the force of law, such as the annotations in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.

In April 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the appeals court ruling by holding that the code annotations were ineligible for copyright protection.

<text>Golyam Beglik is a reservoir near the central parts of the Rhodope Mountains, Bulgaria. It was formerly officially called the Vasil Kolarov reservoir in honour of Vasil Kolarov, a communist political leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria.

== Geography ==
The reservoirs Batak, Beglika, Shiroka Polyana and Golyam Beglik are the main tourist places in the region of Batak. Except Batak, the other dam lakes are located to the north and to the south between 1,450 and 1,560 m altitude, and Golyam Beglik is the largest in area- 4,1 km2.

The area around Golyam Beglik and the other reservoirs is called Beglika Plain. It is surrounded by the Batak Mountain (Баташка планина) and Syutkya Range from the north and west, and is gradually merged with the Veliytsa-Videnitsa Range of the Rhodope Mountains and its branches on the south and east.

Golyam Beglik is supplied by small rivers and streams from Syutkya Range, of which the largest ones are Cherno Dere and Zhalto Dere. It discharges by a stream that joins another stream coming from the smaller Beglika reservoir. These two streams form Devinska River which flows into Vacha River, and then to Maritsa River. 

== Flora and fauna ==
The area around Golyam Beglik is included in the Beglika Natural Reserve that covers large parts of Beglika Plain. Most of this area is covered by coniferous forests, mainly Norwegian spruce and White pine. The Beglika Plain has a rich variety of mountain streams with a lot of meadows around them. 

There is a large diversity of wildlife near the reservoir territory. There are bear, deer, foxes, wolves, as well as smaller animals such as rabbits, hedgehogs, squirrels. There are also many wild ducks and geese near its water areas. The place is well suited for developing hunting tourism that is traditional in the region.

== Tourism ==
The main way to reach Golyam Beglik and the surrounding area is by the road connecting the towns of Batak and Dospat. Currently, tourism is not very developed, and there are only some private villa areas, and a small private hotel, called Siniya Zaliv (Blue Bay). An interesting place is Chatama (Чатъма), located at the western shores of the reservoir. This is not only a complex of bungalows that offer accommodation, but also a center of Bikearea organization that provides summer camps, trekking, biking and other kinds of adventurous tours.

<doc id="307116" wikidata="Q192875" url="?curid=307116" title="Kardzhali">
<text>Kardzhali ( , &quot;Kărdžali&quot;; ), sometimes spelt Kardžali or Kurdzhali, is a town in the Eastern Rhodopes in Bulgaria, centre of Kardzhali Municipality and Kardzhali Province. The noted Kardzhali Reservoir is located nearby. It is an important regional economic hub.

==Geography==
Kardzhali is located in the low eastern part of Rhodope Mountains, on both banks of the river Arda between the Kardzhali Reservoir to the west and the Studen Kladenets Reservoir to the east. The town is southeast of Sofia. It has a crossroad position from Thrace to the Aegean Sea—part of European transportation route 9, via the Makaza mountain pass.

===Climate===
Kardzhali has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa), that is bordering closely on a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa), according to the Köppen climate classification. The city has hot summers and cold winters.

==History==

The area where the town of Kardzhali is now located has been inhabited since the Neolithic. Many artifacts, comprising ceramics and primitive tools, have been found during the archaeological excavations. Most of them are now exhibited in the local historical museum.

Later Thracian tribes settled in the area and developed a highly advanced civilization. They built many sanctuaries dedicated to the gods of the sun and the earth. Near the village of Nenkovo (northwest of Kardzhali), an artificial cave was found in 2001. It has the form of a woman&#x27;s womb and is called the Utroba Cave. Exactly at noon, when the sun is highest in the sky, a ray of light comes in through a stone slit forming a falitic shade in the cave. According to the Thracian beliefs, this is the conception of the new sun god. This cave is considered a complex astronomic facility (compared to Stonehenge in Great Britain) as the ray of light enters the cave on a single day of the year.

There are many stone castles and palaces that the Thracians built in the region, including Perperek, Ustra, and Vishegrad. The most magnificent is Perperikon, where a Thracian king resided. The place has become increasingly popular since the recent archaeological works rendered wealth of artifacts.

During the Byzantine period, Kardzhali was the center of a Christian eparchy: Achridos. During the reign of the Bulgarian Empire, Kardzhali was known as &quot;Zherkovo&quot; a name that was used by the Bulgarians until the 17th century. The Monastery of John the Precursor (Bulgarian: Йоан Продром or Йоан Предтеча) was built in the 6th-8th centuries and is now a monument of medieval architecture. Apart from the fortress of Vishegrad on the right bank of the Arda, the eastern approaches of the town were protected by the medieval castle of Monyak on the left bank of the river.

A couple of other monasteries were built during this era, with some of them remaining until the early 19th century. The area was of strategic importance for the Bulgarian Empire during the Middle Ages and the remains of numerous Medieval fortress scattered on the surrounding hills can still be seen.

The town developed largely due to its position on the trade routes during the period of Ottoman rule. However, it remained a small town. During the 18th century, Turkish brigands used this remote town as a hideaway and supply point, and the town was later named after their leader Kırca Ali. The best known of these units was led by Pazvantoğlu Osman Pasha, who ruled most of the northeastern Ottoman lands and the Danube estuary until his death in 1807.

Kardzhali and its neighborhood became part of the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia under the stipulations of the Berlin Congress of 1878, but, after the reunification of the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia in 1885, it was ceded back to the Ottoman Empire as a township of Gümülcine sanjak in Edirne vilayet. Ottoman rule ended during the First Balkan War when the town and the surrounding area were liberated by the Bulgarian General Vasil Delov on 21 October 1912. The day has been celebrated with concerts and commemorative events as a municipal holiday since 1937. Kardzhali was declared the center of Kardzhali Province, when it was created from the most southern part of Stara Zagora Province in 1949.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census, Kardzhali has a population of 43,880, while the Kardzhali municipality (which in addition to the city also includes 117 villages) has a population of 67,846.During Ottoman rule before 1912 most of the population of the city were Muslims – Turks, Pomaks, and Muslim Roma. After the Second Balkan war and the First World War, Bulgarian Christian refugees from Eastern and Western Thrace settled in Kardzhali. Some Turks immediately moved to the remains of the Ottoman Empire in 1913 in response to the Bulgarians moving to their lands. Further emigration to Turkey continued between 1913 and 1989. This included two emigration waves in the 1930s and 1950s as a result of treaties between Bulgaria and Turkey and most notably in 1989 in response to the state sponsored Revival Process which saw the forced Bulgarisation of ethnic Turks.

After 1990 the deteriorating economic conditions in Bulgaria (and especially the region) during the post-communist transition led to significant emigration by both Bulgarians and Turks, with the Bulgarians moving to other parts of the country or abroad and with the Turks moving mainly to Turkey.

According to the last census in 2011 Kardzhali Province is the Bulgarian province with the highest relative proportion of ethnic Turks, though Kardzhali municipality and the city itself have a lower proportion of ethnic Turks than the rest of the province. According to the optional question on ethnic identification, the city itself has a Bulgarian majority (many Bulgarians in Kardzhali are Muslims, also known as Pomaks) of 61%, while Turks are 34.9% and others and undeclared are 4.1%. The Kardzhali municipality has a Turkish majority of 55.5%, while Bulgarians are 40.5% and others and undeclared are 4%. In 2001, the population of Kardzhali municipality consisted of 53% Turks, 42% Bulgarians and others and undeclared. The municipal government today is primarily in the hands of the Turkish-dominated Movement for Rights and Freedoms.

In December 1989 and January 1990 there were a series of demonstrations in Kardzhali against the liberalization of anti-Turkish laws. A particular issue of contention was whether Turkish should be taught in state schools as an elective. In response Turkish students boycotted schools until the ban on using their mother tongue was discontinued.

==Economy==

Formerly Kardzhali was a tobacco processing center, but for economic reasons all of the communist era industrial plants are no longer operative. The large deposits of lead and zinc ore in the area once made the town an attractive location for the metallurgy and machine building industry. However, in 2016 the no-longer-operative large Lead and Zinc Complex near the city met its final end with its two stacks being torn down.

Nowadays retail trade and services constitute the largest share of local production. The abundance of cultural and natural sights in the area also make it a promising area for tourism.

In 2007 in the city were opened hypermarkets of the chains Technomarket, LIDL, Billa and Technopolis and the construction of the city&#x27;s new marketplace was complete. In 2014 a hypermarket of the chain Kaufland opened too. However the local economy has stalled.

The percentage of the labour force working in agriculture increased from 41% to 47% in just 7 years (the period between 2010 and 2017). Kardzhali has the second highest percentage of people working in agriculture, after Silistra Province.

==Culture and tourism==

Mosque and tombe of the founder of the modern city of Kırcali is situated in the old city near the marketplace.
The Thracian town of Perperikon is located near the city on a rock high above the valley. It is interesting for the fact that it is cut in the rock.

The monastery from 11th century is located in the Vesselchane Quarter of the town. It was renovated in 2000 and a new bell tower was built.

The town clock is unique in Bulgaria because it sounds Bulgarian revolutionary songs every hour.

The Kardzhali Museum of History has one of the most extensive exhibitions in Southern Bulgaria. This includes pre-historic tools and ceramics from the Thracian cities of Perperikon and Tatul, Christian icons and ethnographic exhibits. It is located in the old konak (the Turkish town-hall built around 1870) with its period exterior architecture.

There are many open-air restaurants, offering a variety of drinks and cocktails in summer time on the dam. It is a popular place among fans of water sports and fishing.

The town has two drama theaters — &quot;Dimitar Dimov&quot; and &quot;Kadrie Lyatifova&quot;, a puppet theater and a museum of history medrese, as well as an art gallery.

 from Kardzhali, near the village of Zimzelen, is a small badlands, where a series of white pillars have eroded out of the volcanic tuff which are referred to as the &quot;Kardzhali Pyramids&quot;. Ensembles have been given names based on resemblances. One is known as &quot;The Mushrooms&quot; and another as the &quot;Stone Wedding&quot;.

Kardzhali Point on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Kardzhali.

Longdistance hiking path the Sultans Trail passes Kardzhali dam, city center and many villages.

==Sport==
FK Arda Kardzhali, founded on 13 October 1924, is an association football club currently competes in the First League, the top tier of the Bulgarian football league system. They play at the Arda Arena.

==Dams==

The town is situated on the north and south banks of river Arda and it is bordered to the west by Kardzhali Dam, and by Studen Kladenets Dam to the east. At maximum capacity, the waters of the Studen Kladenets Dam extend to the foot of the old Veselchane bridge. The concrete wall of the Kurdzhali Dam is located about two kilometers () upstream from that bridge. The banks of the river running through the town have been adjusted by the recently completed Water Mirror reservoir, creating an environment for water sports and recreational activities.

In the 1970s, the reservoir of the Kurdzhali Dam was artificially seeded with sheatfish. Today, specimens that reach can be found. In the last years 45,000 carp were introduced into the dam as well. Most recently it was artificially seeded with European perch. The fish were taken from the Ovčarica (Ovcharitsa) dam.

<doc id="307117" wikidata="Q149654" url="?curid=307117" title="East Finchley">
<text>East Finchley is an area in North London, immediately north of Hampstead Heath. Like neighbouring Muswell Hill, it straddles the London Boroughs of Barnet and Haringey, with most of East Finchley falling into the London Borough of Barnet. It has the greenest high road in London.

East Finchley is situated northwest of Charing Cross. Geographically, it is separated from the rest of Finchley by the North Circular, with North Finchley and West Finchley to the north, and Finchley Central (Church End) to the northwest.

East Finchley (East End) was first mentioned in 1365, when it formed a scattered hamlet, but by 1860 it was the most populous part of Finchley. Badly bombed during World War 2, and with the subsequent rebuilding, the street pattern of the Old Village was destroyed. However, the area retains a strong community feeling.

The area collectively named Finchley, which included East Finchley (East End), Finchley Central (Church End) and North Finchley, was a parish until its incorporation into the ancient county of Middlesex in 1878; Finchley was incorporated into Greater London in 1965. 
Although most of East Finchley falls into the parliamentary constituency of Finchley and Golders Green, East Finchley is a village in its own right, and not considered to be part of the town of Finchley.

== History ==

The land on which most of East Finchley now stands was once part of the Bishop of London&#x27;s hunting ground, to the south of Finchley Common, first recorded around 1400. The Bishop of London built a road through his land, named The Bishop&#x27;s Avenue, which still exists today. Another road extended further north, weaving through what is now Market Place, The Walks, King Street, and Oak Lane. As a result, pubs such as The Old White Lion, The Bald Faced Stag, and The Five Bells (on East End Road), all of which survive today, sprang up to provide rest for the people using the road.

The area of &quot;East Finchley Old Village&quot; around Church Lane was west of the common and Bulls Lane (now Church Lane) dates back to at least the 17th century. With the coming of the Great Northern Railway in 1868, the area began to emerge, and the property was built gradually between the 1870s and the 1930s. However, it was not until 1914 that a more recognisable East Finchley High Road and surrounding area was visible.

From around 1547 Finchley had a parish vestry, which became a local board in 1878, an urban district council in 1895, and finally a municipal borough council between 1933 and 1965. The area is now part of the London Borough of Barnet.

From 1959 to 1992 the Finchley constituency was represented in Parliament by Margaret Thatcher, UK Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990. Finchley is now included in the new constituency of Finchley and Golders Green, currently represented by a Conservative Member of Parliament. East Finchley ward is represented on Barnet Council by three elected Labour Councillors.

== Transport ==

East Finchley Underground station is marked by a well-known statue of an archer by Eric Aumonier in the Art Deco style. The archer is pointing his arrow towards the entrance to the tunnel which starts south of the station and runs for to the end of the Northern line at Morden. For many years this was the longest tunnel in the world. There was allegedly an arrow at Morden Station to match the archer at East Finchley, that was stolen a few months after the station was opened. However, East Finchley was not served by the Underground until 1939 and the statue was not erected until 1940.

The station is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line which serves the city (via Bank) and the west end (via Charing Cross) with trains every 2–3 minutes. Buses also serve the high street with the 263 route going from Barnet Hospital to Highbury Barn; the 143 bus linking East Finchley to Archway, London and Brent Cross; the 102 from Edmonton Green, the 234 serving Barnet, The Spires from Highgate Wood and the 603 running between Swiss Cottage and Muswell Hill.

== Housing ==

Housing in East Finchley is diverse in its nature, encompassing many housing styles, from 19th-century terraced housing, large 30s houses, and multimillion-pound mansions on The Bishop&#x27;s Avenue. The three eleven-storey tower blocks of Prospect Ring &amp; Norfolk Close are visible for miles around. A further even taller towerblock in Prospect Ring was completed in 2021.

== Schools ==
Only one state primary school, Martin Primary School (Ofsted outstanding) is situated in East Finchley itself, but the east and southern parts of N2 are covered by the catchment of Tetherdown, Coldfall and Highgate Primary Schools (all within the London Borough of Haringey). Pupils on the west side of the village attend Brookland Infant and Junior Schools which adjoin Christ&#x27;s College. There are two faith primary schools - Holy Trinity (CofE), and Eden Primary School (Jewish).

East Finchley is home to two mixed non-selective non-denominational secondary schools - Archer Academy (opened 2013) and Christ&#x27;s College (mixed, as of 2018) and a mixed Roman Catholic secondary school - Bishop Douglass Catholic School. Pupils on the east (Muswell Hill) side of the village also attend Fortismere School (mixed comprehensive, which falls under the London Borough of Haringey Local Education Authority).

==Demography==

&lt;noinclude&gt;
According to the 2011 UK Census, 72% of the ward&#x27;s population was White (52% White British, 4% Irish, 16% Other White), 10% Asian British (5% Indian, 1% Pakistani, 1% Chinese, 3% Other Asian), 7% Black British (5% African, 1% Caribbean, 1% Other Black); the remaining population consists of mixed ethnic groups (2.0% White and Black African/Caribbean, 1.9% White and Asian, 1.7% Other Mixed), Arab and others .

The largest religion was Christianity, claimed by 41% of the population, followed by Judaism and Islam claimed by 9% and 7% of the population respectively. Of the population, 36% either stated they had no religion (27%) or did not state their religion (9%).

The Ismaili Muslim community, headed by the Aga Khan, worship at a Jamatkhana opened in 1996, which had been built in harmony with the neighbourhood as per the aims of this community. It is located behind the site of the Congregational Church that had been demolished in 1965 to make way for the shops of Viceroy Parade.

== Amenities and features ==

The independent Phoenix Cinema (once called the &quot;Rex&quot; and before that the &quot;Coliseum&quot;) is located on the High Road, and regularly shows films with more individual appeal than is the case with the cinema chains. It is the oldest purpose-built cinema in the UK (the only older ones having started life as theatres). &quot;Time Out&quot;, the arts magazine, describes the &quot;Phoenix&quot; as the best single-screen cinema in London. Film critic Mark Kermode has written that the Phoenix Cinema &quot;remains the single most significant cinema in my development as a bona fide cinema obsessive.&quot;

There is a listed Neo-Georgian public library located on the High Road opposite Leslie Road. Behind the library are some award-winning allotments, owned by Barnet Council. Adjacent to these are the Fuelland allotments which are held in trust. The massive St. Pancras and Islington Cemetery is located on the High Road. Established in 1854, it is the oldest municipal cemetery in London and the largest. The Victorian painter Ford Madox Brown is buried there.

Opposite East Finchley tube station is Cherry Tree Wood, approx. 4.5 ha in size, and contains both woodland and grassland. Nearby parks include Coldfall Wood to the north, and Highgate Wood, Queens Wood, and Hampstead Heath to the south. Also close to the tube station is the head office of McDonald&#x27;s UK; this is seen by the flags and logos on the building.

== Media ==
&quot;The Archer&quot;, founded in 1993, is East Finchley&#x27;s free monthly community newspaper, run by volunteers. It takes its name from the eponymous statue at East Finchley tube station.

== Literary references ==
In Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;Scoop&quot;, Lord Copper, owner of the newspaper &quot;Daily Beast&quot;, lived in East Finchley. &quot;That evening, Mr Salter, foreign editor of The Beast, was summoned to dinner at his chief&#x27;s country seat at East Finchley.&quot;

<text>A music workstation is an electronic musical instrument providing the facilities of:
*a sound module,
*a music sequencer and
*(usually) a musical keyboard.
It enables a musician to compose electronic music using just one piece of equipment.

==Origin of concept==
The concept of a music sequencer combined with a synthesizer originated in the late 1970s with the combination of microprocessors, mini-computers, digital synthesis, disk-based storage, and control devices such as musical keyboards becoming feasible to combine into a single piece of equipment that was affordable to high-end studios and producers, as well as being portable for performers. Prior to this, the integration between sequencing and synthesis was generally a manual function based on wiring of components in large modular synthesizers, and the storage of notes was simply based on potentiometer settings in an analog sequencer.

===Multitimbrality===
Polyphonic synthesizers such as Sequential Circuit Prophet-5 and Yamaha DX7 were capable of playing only one patch at a time (the DX7II could play 2 patches on 2 separate MIDI channels) There was some sequencing ability in some keyboards, but it was not MIDI sequencing. 

In the mid to late 80s, workstation synths were manufactured more than single-patch keyboards. A workstation such as the Korg M1 was able to play out 8 different patches on 8 different MIDI channels, as well as playing a drum track, and had an onboard MIDI sequencer. The patches were often samples, but users could not record their own samples, as they could on a Fairlight. Having samples as the sound source is what made it possible to have various drum sounds in one patch. In contrast, a DX7 or a JX3P did not have the synthesis features to create all the sounds in a drum kit.

==First generation music workstations==
Examples of early music workstations included the New England Digital Synclavier and the Fairlight CMI.

===Key technologies for the first generation===

;Low-cost computer hardware:Leveraging the technology of personal computers, adding a microprocessor enabled complex control functions to be expressed in software rather than wiring. In 1977, the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 and other polyphonic synthesizers had used microprocessors to control patch storage and recall, and the music workstations applied it to control sequence storage and recall as well. The Fairlight used a dual Motorola 6800 configuration, while the Synclavier used a mini-computer called the ABLE.

;Digital synthesis:While it was possible to create a music workstation with digitally controlled analog synthesis modules, few companies did this, instead seeking to produce new sounds and capabilities based on digital synthesis (early units were based on FM synthesis or sample playback).

;Disk-based storage:Again leveraging the technology of personal computers, music workstations used floppy disks to record patches, sequences, and samples. Hard disk storage appeared in the second generation.

;Control devices:In a music workstation, the keyboard was not directly connected to the synthesis modules, as in a Minimoog or ARP Odyssey. Instead, the keyboard switches were digitally scanned, and control signals sent over a computer backplane where they were inputs to the computer processor, which would then route the signals to the synthesis modules, which were output devices on the backplane. This approach had been used for years in computer systems, and allowed the addition of new input and output peripherals without obsoleting the entire computer. In the case of the music workstations, the next output devices to be added were typically computer terminal displays (some with graphics), and in the case of the Fairlight, the next input device was a light pen for &quot;drawing&quot; on the display screen.

The result was that music workstations evolved rapidly during this period, as new software releases could add more functionality, new voice cards developed, and new input technologies added.

==Second generation music workstations==

By 1982, the Fairlight CMI Series II represented another advance as it now offered more RAM-based sample memory than any other system with an improved sample rate, and in the Series III (1985) changed from 8-bit to 16-bit samples. The Synclavier introduced hard-disk based sampling in 1982, storing megabytes of samples for the first time.

Other products also combined synthesis and sequencing. For instance the Sequential Circuits Six-Trak provided this possibility. The Six-Trak was a polyphonic analog synthesizer, which featured an on-board six-track sequencer.

Still other products focused on combining sampling and sequencing. For instance the E-mu Emulator models, first introduced in 1981, combined sample memory (read from floppy disks) with a simple sequencer in the initial model, and an 8-track sequencer in later models.

The biggest change in the industry was the development of the MIDI standard in 1983 for representing musical note sequences. For the first time, sequences could be moved from one digitally controlled music device to another.

The Ensoniq ESQ-1, released in 1985, combined for the first time a multi-track, polyphonic MIDI sequencer with a dynamically-assigned multi-timbral synthesizer. 
In the late 1980s, on-board MIDI sequencers began to appear more frequently on professional synthesizers. The Korg M1 (released 1988) a widely known and popular music workstation, and became the world&#x27;s best-selling digital keyboard synthesizer of all time. During its six-year production period, more than 250,000 units were sold.

===Key technologies for the second generation===

;MIDI:As mentioned above, MIDI data represents pitches, velocities, and controller events (e.g. pitch bend, modulation wheel). MIDI information could be used on the backplane that linked the elements of the workstation together, connecting the input devices to the synthesizers, or it could be sent to another device or received from another device.

;Display technologies:Music workstations adopted the most effective input/output devices available for their price range, since there were complex control settings to display, complex waveforms, and complex sequences. The lower-end devices began to use LED displays that showed multiple lines of characters and later simple graphics, while the higher-end devices began to adopt personal computers with graphics as their front-ends (the Synclavier PostPro used an Apple Macintosh).

;Large memory banks:Music workstations soon had megabytes of memory, located on large racks of cards.

;Modular software:Music workstations had software that was organized around a set of common control functions, and then a set of options. In many cases, these options were organized as &#x27;pages&#x27;. The Fairlight was known for its &quot;Page R&quot; functions which provided real-time composition in a graphical form which was similar to that later used on drum machines such as the Roland TR-808. The Synclavier offered music notation.

;Digital signal processing:This enabled the music workstation to generate effects such as reverb or chorus within its hardware, rather than relying on external devices.

;SMPTE:Since the primary users of the high-end workstations were film composers, the music workstations added hardware and software to generate SMPTE timecode, which is a standard in the motion picture industry. This allowed one to generate events that were matched to scenes and cuts in the film.

==Third generation music workstations==

Although many music workstations have a keyboard, this is not always the case. In the 1990s, Yamaha and Roland released a series of portable music workstations (starting with the Yamaha QY10 (1990)). These are sometimes called walkstations.

The concept of the workstation evolved in the mid-1990s with the emergence of the groove machine concept that began in the mid-1980s – a keyless version of a workstation, still with a self-contained sound source and sequencer, mostly intended for dance music. Nowadays, these devices feature a sampler. The groove machines that emerged in the mid-1980s include the Linn 9000 (1984), SCI Studio 440 (1986), Korg DDD-1 (1986), Yamaha RX5 (1986), Simmons SDX (1987)), Kawai R-50e (1987), E-mu SP-12/SP-1200 (1985/1987), and Akai MPC60 (1988). In the mid-1990s, Roland entered the market with the MC-303 (1996), and Korg and Yamaha re-entered the market, Korg with the Electribe series (1999–).

Akai developed and refined the idea of the keyboard-less workstation with the Music Production Center series (1988–) of sampler workstations. The MPC breed of sampler freed the composer from the rigidity of step sequencing, which was a limitation of earlier groove machines.

===Key technologies for the third generation===

;Low-cost, high-capacity memory:By 1995, a music workstation might have 16 to 64 megabytes of memory in a few chips, which had required a rack of cards in 1985.

;Sample libraries:While a second-generation workstation could be sold with just a few sounds or samples and the ability for the owner to create more, by 1995 most workstations had several additional sample sets available for purchase on ROM, and an industry had been created for third-party sample libraries. In addition, there were now standard formats for sound samples to achieve interoperability.

;Battery power:Since music workstations were now used by wide range of performers, down to individual dance music DJ&#x27;s and even street performers, portable designs avoided power-intensive components such as disk storage and began to rely on persistent memory and later flash-memory storage.

;Interoperability with personal computers:Initially through custom interfaces and later USB standards.

==Modern music workstations==
Yamaha, Roland and Korg now have sampling as a default option with the Yamaha Motif line (introduced 2001), the Roland Fantom series (introduced 2001) and the Korg Triton (introduced 1999), Korg OASYS, and Korg M3 Workstations have a fairly large screen to give a comprehensive overview of the sound, sequencer and sampling options. Since the display is one of the most expensive components of these workstations, Roland and Yamaha initially chose to keep costs down by not using a touch screen or high-resolution display, but have added such in later models.

Another path of music product development that started with the feature set of music workstations is to provide entirely software-based products, using virtual instruments. This is the concept of the digital audio workstation, and many of these products have emulated the multitrack recording metaphors of sequencers first developed in the music workstations.

Open Labs introduced the Production Station in 2003, which changed the relationship of the music workstation and the personal computer from a model where the music workstation interfaces to the PC into one where the music workstation is a PC with a music keyboard and a touch screen display.

A variation on Open Labs&#x27; approach, Korg released the Korg OASYS in 2005. OASYS housed inside a keyboard music workstation housing a computer running a custom operating system built on the Linux kernel. OASYS was an acronym for Open Architecture SYnthesis Studio, underscoring Korg&#x27;s ability to release new capabilities via ongoing software updates. OASYS not only included a synthesizer, sampling, and a sequencer, but the ability to digitally record multi-track audio. OASYS was discontinued in 2009, and Korg Kronos, an updated version built on the same concept, was introduced in January, 2011.

==Evaluation of a music workstation==
While advances in digital technology have greatly reduced the price of a professional-grade music workstation, the &#x27;time cost&#x27; of learning to operate a complex instrument like this cannot be underestimated. Hence, product selection is critical, and is typically based upon:

* Ease of use
* Number of tracks in the sequencer
* Expansion options and modularity
* Size of user and support community
* Support for standards such as MIDI, SMPTE, Internet, etc.
* Reliable functioning
* Adaptation to most requirements of music production.

<doc id="307123" wikidata="Q2458963" url="?curid=307123" title="AMBER">
<text>Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement (AMBER) is the name of a widely-used molecular dynamics software package originally developed by Peter Kollman&#x27;s group at the University of California, San Francisco. It has also, subsequently, come to designate a family of force fields for molecular dynamics of biomolecules that can be used both within the AMBER software suite and with many modern computational platforms. 

The original version of the AMBER software package was written by Paul Weiner as a post-doc in Peter Kollman&#x27;s laboratory, and was released in 1981. 

Subsequently, U Chandra Singh expanded AMBER as a post-doc in Kollman&#x27;s laboratory, adding molecular dynamics and free energy capabilities. 

The next iteration of AMBER was started around 1987 by a group of developers in (and associated with) the Kollman lab, including David Pearlman, David Case, James Caldwell, William Ross, Thomas Cheatham, Stephen DeBolt, David Ferguson, and George Seibel. This team headed development for more than a decade and introduced a variety of improvements, including significant expansion of the free energy capabilities, accommodation for modern parallel and array processing hardware platforms (Cray, Star, etc.), restructuring of the code and revision control for greater maintainability, PME Ewald summations, tools for NMR refinement, and many others. 

Currently, AMBER is maintained by an active collaboration between David Case at Rutgers University, Tom Cheatham at the University of Utah, Adrian Roitberg at University of Florida, Ken Merz at Michigan State University, Carlos Simmerling at Stony Brook University, Ray Luo at UC Irvine, and Junmei Wang at University of Pittsburgh.

== Force field ==
The term &quot;AMBER force field&quot; generally refers to the functional form used by the family of AMBER force fields. This form includes several parameters; each member of the family of AMBER force fields provides values for these parameters and has its own name.

=== Functional form ===
The functional form of the AMBER force field is
:formula_1

formula_2 
formula_3

Despite the term &quot;force field&quot;, this equation defines the potential energy of the system; the force is the derivative of this potential relative to position.

The meanings of right hand side terms are:
* First term (summing over bonds): represents the energy between covalently bonded atoms. This harmonic (ideal spring) force is a good approximation near the equilibrium bond length, but becomes increasingly poor as atoms separate.
* Second term (summing over angles): represents the energy due to the geometry of electron orbitals involved in covalent bonding.
* Third term (summing over torsions): represents the energy for twisting a bond due to bond order (e.g., double bonds) and neighboring bonds or lone pairs of electrons. One bond may have more than one of these terms, such that the total torsional energy is expressed as a Fourier series.
* Fourth term (double summation over formula_4 and formula_5): represents the non-bonded energy between all atom pairs, which can be decomposed into van der Waals (first term of summation) and electrostatic (second term of summation) energies.

The form of the van der Waals energy is calculated using the equilibrium distance (formula_6) and well depth (formula_7). The factor of formula_8 ensures that the equilibrium distance is formula_6. The energy is sometimes reformulated in terms of formula_10, where formula_11, as used e.g. in the implementation of the softcore potentials.

The form of the electrostatic energy used here assumes that the charges due to the protons and electrons in an atom can be represented by a single point charge (or in the case of parameter sets that employ lone pairs, a small number of point charges.)

=== Parameter sets ===
To use the AMBER force field, it is necessary to have values for the parameters of the force field (e.g. force constants, equilibrium bond lengths and angles, charges). A fairly large number of these parameter sets exist, and are described in detail in the AMBER software user manual. Each parameter set has a name, and provides parameters for certain types of molecules.
*Peptide, protein, and nucleic acid parameters are provided by parameter sets with names starting with &quot;ff&quot; and containing a two digit year number, for instance &quot;ff99&quot;. As of 2018 the primary protein model used by the AMBER suit is the ff14SB force field.
* &quot;General AMBER force field&quot; (GAFF) provides parameters for small organic molecules to facilitate simulations of drugs and small molecule ligands in conjunction with biomolecules.
*The GLYCAM force fields have been developed by Rob Woods for simulating carbohydrates.
*The primary force field used in the AMBER suit for lipids is lipid14.

== Software ==
The AMBER software suite provides a set of programs to apply the AMBER forcefields to simulations of biomolecules. It is written in the programming languages Fortran 90 and C, with support for most major Unix-like operating systems and compilers. Development is conducted by a loose association of mostly academic labs. New versions are released usually in the spring of even numbered years; AMBER 10 was released in April 2008. The software is available under a site license agreement, which includes full source, currently priced at US$500 for non-commercial and US$20,000 for commercial organizations.

=== Programs ===
* &quot;LEaP&quot; prepares input files for the simulation programs.
* &quot;Antechamber&quot; automates the process of parameterizing small organic molecules using GAFF.
* &quot;Simulated Annealing with NMR-Derived Energy Restraints&quot; (SANDER) is the central simulation program and provides facilities for energy minimizing and molecular dynamics with a wide variety of options.
* &quot;pmemd&quot; is a somewhat more feature-limited reimplementation of SANDER by Bob Duke. It was designed for parallel computing, and performs significantly better than SANDER when running on more than 8–16 processors.
** &quot;pmemd.cuda&quot; runs simulations on machines with graphics processing units (GPUs).
** &quot;pmemd.amoeba&quot; handles the extra parameters in the polarizable AMOEBA force field.
* &quot;nmode&quot; calculates normal modes.
* &quot;ptraj&quot; numerically analyzes simulation results. AMBER includes no visualizing abilities, which is commonly performed with Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD). Ptraj is now unsupported as of AmberTools 13. 
* &quot;cpptraj&quot; is a rewritten version of ptraj made in C++ to give faster analysis of simulation results. Several actions have been made parallelizable with OpenMP and MPI.
* &quot;MM-PBSA&quot; allows implicit solvent calculations on snap shots from molecular dynamics simulations.
* &quot;NAB&quot; is a built-in nucleic acid building environment made to aid in the process of manipulating proteins and nucleic acids where an atomic level of description will aid computing.

<text>The Pasarel dam and reservoir is located 20 km to the southeast of Sofia, Bulgaria at an altitude of 700 m.

The dam is situated roughly halfway between the Iskar Reservoir and Lake Pancharevo near the village of Dolni Pasarel. Though built in the Iskar valley, under most circumstances, the primary inflow come from the tailwater of a co-located hydroelectric plant (which is in turn is fed from a long, underground penstock from the Iskar Reservoir.) Likewise, in most cases, the majority of its outflow goes into another long penstock to the hydroelectric plant at the southern end of Lake Pancharevo. The reservoir itself is small (about 1.5 km long and 300 m wide), but still attracts visitors to the area.

Near to the Pasarel dam, in the village of Dolni Pasarel, is located the &quot;St. Peter and Pavel&quot; monastery.</text><links>

<text>Kamenz (, ) was a Kreis (district) in the north-east of Saxony, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from north clockwise) Oberspreewald-Lausitz, Spree-Neiße, Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis, Bautzen - Budyšin, Sächsische Schweiz, the district-free city Dresden - Drježdźany, and the districts Meißen and Riesa-Großenhain. The district-free city Hoyerswerda was surrounded by the district.

== History ==
The district was formed in 1994 from the previous Kamenz district, the northern parts of the Dresden-Land district, around Radeberg, and the Hoyerswerda district, except the town of Hoyerswerda, which became a district-free city. From 1994 to 1996 it was called &quot;Westlausitz - Dresdner Land&quot;, but then renamed to &quot;Kamenz&quot; again. In August 2008, the Kamenz district and Hoyerswerda were merged into the district of Bautzen.

== Geography ==
The two major rivers in the district were the Spree and the Schwarze Elster (&quot;Black Elster&quot;).

== Partnerships ==
Since December 14, 1990 the district had a partnership with the district Alzey-Worms in Rhineland-Palatinate.

<text>Shiroka Polyana () is a reservoir situated in the Western Rhodope Mountains of southern Bulgaria. Its waters are used for electricity generation and irrigation. Due to its scenic location and abundance of fish, it is a popular tourist destination.

== Geography ==
Shiroka Polyana is located at an altitude of 1,5 km at 30 km south of the town of Batak in Pazardzhik Province, on the second class II-37 road leading to Dospat, which lies 20 km further south. With no settlements in its vicinity, the reservoir is amidst old-growth coniferous forests and is surrounded by three protected areas — &quot;Shiroka Polyana&quot; to the north-northwest, &quot;Studenata Chuchurka&quot; to the south-southwest and &quot;Kaval Tepe&quot; to the east. With its irregular shores, viewed from the road it seems that Shiroka Polyana is composed of numerous small lakes. This illusion is due to the indented relief of the lake bed that consists of several mountain gullies.

Although the banks of the reservoirs are comparatively hard to access, it attracts many visitors and sports fishermen because of the abundance of fish, including native species such as European perch, common chub, river trout, Eurasian carp, crucian carp, Prussian carp, wels catfish and common rudd, as wells as alloctonous ones like grass carp and rainbow trout.

== Dam ==
Shiroka Polyana is the most important structure of the &quot;Shiroka Polyana junction&quot; of the Batak Hydropower Cascade (254 MW), which includes a system of dams and pumping stations, aimed at collecting water from the upper course of the catchment areas of the rivers Dospat and Vacha, and more specifically, the left tributaries of the latter, the Devinska reka and the Gashnya. The reservoir was constructed in 1959–1962. 

Shiroka Polyana, occupies a former grassland meadow and consists of five separate dams at its shores — a concrete gravity dam of the Kireeva River with a height of 21.2 m and a length of 80 m, an earthen dam with a height of 15.7 m and a length of 186 m, an earthen-brick dam with a height of 3.8 m and a length of 57 m, an earthen-brick dam with a height of 2.7 m and a length of 38 m and an earthen dam with a height of 3.55 m and a length of 137 m.

The reservoir covers a surface area of 4.3 km2, with a volume of 24 million m3 and an average depth of 6 m. It is linked to the neighbouring Golyam Beglik Reservoir through a tunnel, through which its waters are transferred to the Batak Hydropower Cascade, to be utilized for electricity generation along its three power plants and for irrigation in the Upper Thracian Plain.

<text>The Studen Kladenets Reservoir (, meaning &quot;cold well&quot;) is the third largest reservoir by volume in Bulgaria after Iskar Dam and Kardzhali Dam. It is situated on the river Arda, and is created behind the Studen Kladenets dam, 30 km south-east of the town of Kardzhali. There are another two dams of the Arda - Kardzhali Dam to the west (upstream) and Ivaylovgrad Dam to the east (downstream). The dam is operated by the Bulgarian National Electric Company, NEK EAD.

The reservoir has a total volume of 388 million m3 and a drainage basin of 3,706 km2 and is 29 km long. It is situated at an average 227 m above sea level, its dam being 338 m long and 67.5 m high. The top of the dam consists of nine spillways, each one being 10.5 by 5 m.
&quot;Studen Kladenets&quot; Hydroelectric Power Plant is situated appr. 1 km downstream of the dam. Initially the HPP had four Francis-type turbines, 15 MW each. А project for reconstruction and upgrading the HPP with another 16 MW turbine and a smaller eco-turbine underwent and after the completion, the total output reached 85 MW with annual production of 165 GWh of electricity.

Studen Kladenets reservoir is an attractive place for fishermen, where rudd is caught in great numbers. In its western part are located the ruins of the medieval Bulgarian fortresses of Monyak on the northern shore and Vishegrad on the southern shore. 

The development of the reservoir has caused the local ecology to become artificially wetter and more humid, reducing the variety of types of land cover.

==History==
The initial plans for the construction of a dam on the Arda date to as early as 1948. Construction began in 1955 and was completed in 1957. The HPP started electricity production in 1958.

<text>The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an American wide-body airliner developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

After dropping its unconventional Sonic Cruiser project, Boeing announced the conventional 7E7 on January 29, 2003, which focused largely on efficiency. The program was launched on April 26, 2004, with an order for 50 aircraft from All Nippon Airways (ANA), targeting a 2008 introduction.
On July 8, 2007, a prototype 787 without major operating systems was rolled out; subsequently the aircraft experienced multiple delays, until its maiden flight on December 15, 2009.
Type certification was received in August 2011, and the first 787-8 was delivered in September 2011 and entered commercial service on October 26, 2011, with ANA.
At launch, Boeing targeted the 787 with 20% less fuel burn compared to aircraft like the Boeing 767. It could carry 200 to 300 passengers on point-to-point routes up to , a shift from hub-and-spoke travel.
The twinjet is powered by General Electric GEnx or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 high-bypass turbofans. It is the first airliner with an airframe primarily made of composite materials and makes greater use of electrical systems.
Externally, it is recognizable by its four-window cockpit, raked wingtips, and noise-reducing chevrons on its engine nacelles.
Development and production rely on subcontractors around the world more than for previous Boeing aircraft. Since March 2021 final assembly has been at the Boeing South Carolina factory; it was formerly in the Boeing Everett Factory in Washington.
The initial 787-8 typically seats 248 passengers over a range of , with a MTOW compared to for later variants.

The stretched 787-9, long, can fly with 296 passengers; it entered service on August 7, 2014, with All Nippon Airways.
The further stretched 787-10, long, seating 336 over , entered service with Singapore Airlines on April 3, 2018.
Early 787 operations encountered several problems caused mainly by its lithium-ion batteries, including fires onboard some aircraft. In January 2013, the U.S. FAA grounded all 787s until it approved the revised battery design in April 2013.
Significant quality control issues from 2019 onward caused a production slowdown and, from January 2021 until August 2022, an almost total cessation of deliveries. 
Boeing has spent $32 billion on the program; estimates for the number of aircraft sales needed to break even vary between 1,300 and 2,000.

, the 787 program has received 1,957 orders and made 1,165 deliveries with no fatalities and no hull losses.

==Development==

===Background===
During the late 1990s, Boeing considered replacement aircraft programs due to slowing sales of the 767 and 747-400. Two new aircraft were proposed. The 747X would have lengthened the 747-400 and improved efficiency, and the Sonic Cruiser would have achieved 15% higher speeds (approximately Mach 0.98) while burning fuel at the same rate as the 767. Market interest for the 747X was tepid; several major American airlines, including Continental Airlines, showed initial enthusiasm for the Sonic Cruiser, although concerns about the operating cost were also expressed. The global airline-market was disrupted by the 9/11 attacks and increased petroleum prices, making airlines more interested in efficiency than speed. The worst-affected airlines, those in the United States, had been considered the most likely customers of the Sonic Cruiser; thus the Sonic Cruiser was officially canceled on December 20, 2002. On January 29, 2003, Boeing announced an alternative product, the 7E7, using Sonic Cruiser technology in a more conventional configuration. The emphasis on a smaller midsize twinjet rather than a large 747-size aircraft represented a shift from the hub-and-spoke theory toward the point-to-point theory, in response to analysis of focus groups.

Randy Baseler, Boeing Commercial Airplanes VP Marketing stated that airport congestion comes from large numbers of regional jets and small single-aisles, flying to destinations where a 550-seat Airbus A380 would be too large; to reduce the number of departures, smaller airplanes can increase by 20% in size and airline hubs can be avoided with point-to-point transit.

In 2003, a recent addition to the Boeing board of directors, James McNerney (who would become Boeing&#x27;s Chairman and CEO in 2005), supported the need for a new aircraft to regain market share from Airbus. The directors on Boeing&#x27;s board, Harry Stonecipher (Boeing&#x27;s President and CEO) and John McDonnell issued an ultimatum to &quot;develop the plane for less than 40 percent of what the 777 had cost to develop 13 years earlier, and build each plane out of the gate for less than 60 percent of the 777&#x27;s unit costs in 2003&quot;, and approved a development budget estimated at US$7 billion as Boeing management claimed that they would &quot;require subcontractors to foot the majority of costs.&quot; Boeing Commercial Airplanes president Alan Mulally, who had previously served as general manager of the 777 programs contrasted the difference in the approval process by the board between the 777 and 787 saying &quot;In the old days, you would go to the board and ask for X amount of money, and they&#x27;d counter with Y amount of money, and then you&#x27;d settle on a number, and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d use to develop the plane. These days, you go to the board, and they say, &#x27;Here&#x27;s the budget for this airplane, and we&#x27;ll be taking this piece of it off the top, and you get what&#x27;s left; don&#x27;t fuck up.&#x27;&quot;
The replacement for the Sonic Cruiser project was named &quot;7E7&quot; (with a development code name of &quot;Y2&quot;). Technology from the Sonic Cruiser and 7E7 was to be used as part of Boeing&#x27;s project to replace its entire airliner product line, an endeavor called the Yellowstone Project (of which the 7E7 became the first stage). Early concept images of the 7E7 included rakish cockpit windows, a dropped nose, and a distinctive &quot;shark-fin&quot; tail. The &quot;E&quot; was said to stand for various things, such as &quot;efficiency&quot; or &quot;environmentally friendly&quot;. In the end, Boeing said it stood for &quot;Eight&quot;. In July 2003, a public naming competition was held for the 7E7, for which out of 500,000 votes cast online the winning title was &quot;Dreamliner&quot;. Other names included &quot;eLiner&quot;, &quot;Global Cruiser&quot;, and &quot;Stratoclimber&quot;.
On April 26, 2004, Japanese airline All Nippon Airways (ANA) became the launch customer for the 787, announcing a firm order for 50 aircraft with deliveries to begin in late 2008. The ANA order was initially specified as 30 787-3, 290–330 seat, one-class domestic aircraft, and 20 787-8, long-haul, 210–250 seat, two-class aircraft for regional international routes such as Tokyo-Narita to Beijing-Capital, and could perform routes to cities not previously served, such as Denver, Moscow, and New Delhi. The 787-3 and 787-8 were to be the initial variants, with the 787-9 entering service in 2010.

On October 5, 2012, Indian state carrier Air India became the first carrier to take possession of a Dreamliner that was manufactured in the Charleston, South Carolina, Boeing plant. This was the first Boeing Dreamliner that was manufactured outside of Washington state. Boeing would go on to use both the Everett and South Carolina plants to deliver the Dreamliner.

The 787 was designed to be the first production airliner with the fuselage comprising one-piece composite barrel sections instead of the multiple aluminum sheets and some 50,000 fasteners used on existing aircraft. Boeing selected two new engines to power the 787, the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 and General Electric GEnx. Boeing stated the 787 would be approximately 20 percent more fuel-efficient than the 767, with approximately 40 percent of the efficiency gain from the engines, plus gains from aerodynamic improvements, increased use of lighter-weight composite materials, and advanced systems. The airframe underwent extensive structural testing during its design. The 787-8 and −9 were intended to have a certified 330 minute ETOPS capability.

During the design phase, the 787 underwent extensive wind tunnel testing at Boeing&#x27;s Transonic Wind Tunnel, QinetiQ&#x27;s five-meter wind tunnel at Farnborough, United Kingdom, and NASA Ames Research Center&#x27;s wind tunnel, as well as at the French aerodynamics research agency, ONERA. The final styling was more conservative than earlier proposals, with the fin, nose, and cockpit windows changed to a more conventional form. By 2005, customer-announced orders and commitments for the 787 reached 237 aircraft. Boeing initially priced the 787-8 variant at US$120 million, a low figure that surprised the industry. In 2007, the list price was US$146–151.5 million for the 787-3, US$157–167 million for the 787-8, and US$189–200 million for the 787-9.

===Manufacturing and suppliers===
On December 16, 2003, Boeing announced that the 787 would be assembled in its factory in Everett, Washington. Instead of conventionally building the aircraft from the ground up, the final assembly employed 800 to 1,200 people to join completed subassemblies and integrate systems. Boeing assigned global subcontractors to do more assembly work, delivering completed subassemblies to Boeing for final assembly. This approach was intended to result in a leaner, simpler assembly line and lower inventory, with pre-installed systems reducing final assembly time by three-quarters to three days. Subcontractors had early difficulties procuring needed parts and finishing subassemblies on schedule, leaving remaining assembly work for Boeing to complete as &quot;traveled work.&quot; In 2010, Boeing considered in-house construction of the 787-9 tail; the tail of the 787-8 is made by Alenia. The 787 was unprofitable for some subcontractors; Alenia&#x27;s parent company, Finmeccanica, had a total loss of €750 million on the project.
Subcontracted assemblies included wing and center wing box (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan; Subaru Corporation, Japan); horizontal stabilizers (Alenia Aeronautica, Italy; Korea Aerospace Industries, South Korea); fuselage sections (Global Aeronautica, Italy; Boeing, North Charleston, US; Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Japan; Spirit AeroSystems, Wichita, US; Korean Air, South Korea); passenger doors (Latécoère, France); cargo doors, access doors, and crew escape door (Saab AB, Sweden); software development (HCL Enterprise, India); floor beams (TAL Manufacturing Solutions Limited, India); wiring (Labinal, France); wing-tips, flap support fairings, wheel well bulkhead, and longerons (Korean Air, South Korea); landing gear (Messier-Bugatti-Dowty, UK/France); and power distribution and management systems, air conditioning packs (Hamilton Sundstrand, Connecticut, US).

To speed up deliveries, Boeing modified four used 747-400s into 747 Dreamlifters to transport 787 wings, fuselage sections, and other smaller parts. Japanese industrial participation was key to the project. Japanese companies co-designed and built 35% of the aircraft; the first time that outside firms played a key design role on Boeing airliner wings. The Japanese government supported development with an estimated US$2 billion in loans. On April 26, 2006, Japanese manufacturer Toray Industries and Boeing signed a production agreement involving US$6 billion worth of carbon fiber, extending a 2004 contract. In May 2007, the final assembly on the first 787 began at Everett.

Boeing worked to trim excess weight since assembly of the first airframe began; in late 2006, the first six 787s were stated to be overweight, with the first aircraft being heavier than specified. The seventh and subsequent aircraft would be the first optimized 787-8s expected to meet all goals. Accordingly, some parts were redesigned to include more use of titanium. In July 2015, Reuters reported that Boeing was considering reducing the use of titanium to reduce construction costs.

Early built 787s (line numbers under 20) were overweight, increasing their fuel burn and reducing their maximum range, and some carriers decided to take later aircraft. Boeing struggled to sell these aircraft, eventually offering significant discounts and scrapping one. Because of their line numbers, these aircraft were nicknamed the &quot;Terrible Teens.&quot;
Boeing planned the first flight by the end of August 2007 and premiered the first 787 (registered N787BA) at a rollout ceremony on July 8, 2007. The 787 had 677 orders at this time, which is more orders from launch to roll-out than any previous wide-body airliner. The major systems were not installed at the time; many parts were attached with temporary non-aerospace fasteners requiring replacement with flight fasteners later.

In September 2007, Boeing announced a three-month delay, blaming a shortage of fasteners as well as incomplete software. On October 10, 2007, a second three-month delay to the first flight and a six-month delay to first deliveries were announced due to supply chain problems, a lack of documentation from overseas suppliers, and flight guidance software delays. Less than a week later, Mike Bair, the 787 program manager was replaced. On January 16, 2008, Boeing announced a third three-month delay to the first flight of the 787, citing insufficient progress on &quot;traveled work.&quot; On March 28, 2008, to gain more control over the supply chain, Boeing announced plans to buy Vought Aircraft Industries&#x27; interest in Global Aeronautica; a later agreement was also made to buy Vought&#x27;s factory in North Charleston.

On April 9, 2008, a fourth delay was announced, shifting the maiden flight to the fourth quarter of 2008, and delaying initial deliveries by around 15 months to the third quarter of 2009. The 787-9 variant was postponed to 2012 and the 787-3 variant was to follow at a later date. On November 4, 2008, a fifth delay was announced due to incorrect fastener installation and the Boeing machinists strike, stating that the first test flight would not occur in the fourth quarter of 2008. After assessing the program schedule with suppliers, in December 2008, Boeing stated that the first flight was delayed until the second quarter of 2009. Airlines, such as United Airlines and Air India, stated their intentions to seek compensation from Boeing for the delays.

A secondary factor in the delays faced by the 787 program was the lack of detailed specifications provided to partners and suppliers. In previous programs Boeing had supplied high level design data, but for the 787, decided to provide broad level specifications only, on the assumption that relevant partners had the competencies to perform the design and integration work with the limited data. This decision created several delays as suppliers struggled to work with the limited design data. 

===Pre-flight ground testing===
As Boeing worked with its suppliers toward production, the design proceeded through a series of test goals. On August 23, 2007, a crash test involving a vertical drop of a partial composite fuselage section from about onto a -thick steel plate occurred in Mesa, Arizona; the results matched predictions, allowing modeling of various crash scenarios using computational analysis instead of further physical tests. While critics had expressed concerns that a composite fuselage could shatter and burn with toxic fumes during crash landings, test data indicated no greater toxicity than conventional metal airframes. The crash test was the third in a series of demonstrations conducted to match FAA requirements, including additional certification criteria due to the wide-scale use of composite materials. The 787 meets the FAA&#x27;s requirement that passengers have at least as good a chance of surviving a crash landing as they would with current metal airliners.
On August 7, 2007, on-time certification of the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine by European and US regulators was received. The alternative GE GEnx-1B engine achieved certification on March 31, 2008. On June 20, 2008, the first aircraft was powered up, for testing the electrical supply and distribution systems. A non-flightworthy static test airframe was built; on September 27, 2008, the fuselage was successfully tested at differential, which is 150 percent of the maximum pressure expected in commercial service. In December 2008, the 787&#x27;s maintenance program was passed by the FAA.

On May 3, 2009, the first test 787 was moved to the flight line following extensive factory testing, including landing gear swings, systems integration verification, and a total run-through of the first flight. On May 4, 2009, a press report indicated a 10–15% range reduction, about instead of the originally promised , for early aircraft that were about 8% overweight. Substantial redesign work was expected to correct this, which would complicate increases in production rates; Boeing stated the early 787-8s would have a range of almost . As a result, some airlines reportedly delayed deliveries of 787s to take later planes that may be closer to the original estimates. Boeing expected to have the weight issues addressed by the 21st production model.

On June 15, 2009, during the Paris Air Show, Boeing said that the 787 would make its first flight within two weeks. On June 23, the first flight was postponed due to structural reasons. Boeing provided an updated 787 schedule on August 27, 2009, with the first flight planned to occur by the end of 2009 and deliveries to begin at the end of 2010. The company expected to write off US$2.5 billion because it considered the first three Dreamliners built unsellable and suitable only for flight tests. On October 28, 2009, Boeing selected Charleston, SC as the site for a second 787 production line, after soliciting bids from multiple states. On December 12, 2009, the first 787 completed high-speed taxi tests, the last major step before flight.

===Flight testing===
On December 15, 2009, Boeing conducted the 787-8 maiden flight from Paine Field in Everett, Washington, at 10:27 am PST and landed three hours later at 1:33 p.m. at Seattle&#x27;s Boeing Field. During the flight the 787 reached a top speed of and maximum altitude of . Originally scheduled for hours, the test flight was shortened to three hours due to unfavorable weather conditions. The six-aircraft ground and flight test program was scheduled to be done in eight and a half months and 6800 hours, which was the fastest certification campaign for a new Boeing commercial design.

The flight test program comprised six aircraft, ZA001 through ZA006, four with Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines and two with GE GEnx-1B64 engines. The second 787, ZA002 in All Nippon Airways livery, flew to Boeing Field on December 22, 2009, to join the flight test program; the third 787, ZA004 made its first flight on February 24, 2010, followed by ZA003 on March 14, 2010. On March 24, 2010, flutter and ground effects testing was completed, clearing the aircraft to fly its entire flight envelope. On March 28, 2010, the 787 completed the ultimate wing load test, which requires that the wings of a fully assembled aircraft be loaded to 150% of the design limit load and held for 3 seconds. The wings were flexed approximately upward during the test. Unlike past aircraft, the wings were not tested to failure. On April 7, data showed the test had been a success.

On April 23, 2010, the newest 787, ZA003, arrived at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory hangar at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, for extreme weather testing in temperatures ranging from , including takeoff preparations at both temperature extremes. ZA005, the fifth 787 and the first with GEnx engines, began ground engine tests in May 2010, and made its first flight on June 16, 2010. In June 2010, gaps were discovered in the horizontal stabilizers of test aircraft due to improperly installed shims; all aircraft were inspected and repaired. That same month, a 787 experienced its first in-flight lightning strike; inspections found no damage. As composites can have as little as 1/1,000th the electrical conductivity of aluminum, conductive material is added to alleviate potential risks and to meet FAA requirements. The FAA also planned requirement changes to help the 787 show compliance. In December 2019, it was reported that Boeing had removed the copper foil that formed part of the protection against lightning strikes to the wings of the aircraft; it then worked with the FAA to override concerns raised.
The 787 made its first appearance at an international air show at the Farnborough Airshow, United Kingdom, on July 18, 2010.

On August 2, 2010, a Trent 1000 engine suffered a blowout at Rolls-Royce&#x27;s test facility during ground testing. This engine failure caused a reevaluation of the timeline for installing Trent 1000 engines; on August 27, 2010, Boeing stated that the first delivery to launch customer ANA would be delayed until early 2011. That same month, Boeing faced compensation claims from airlines owing to ongoing delivery delays. In September 2010, it was reported that two additional 787s might join the test fleet for a total of eight flight test aircraft. On September 10, 2010, a partial engine surge occurred in a Trent engine on ZA001 at Roswell. On October 4, 2010, the sixth 787, ZA006 joined the test program with its first flight.

On November 9, 2010, the second 787, ZA002 made an emergency landing at Laredo International Airport, Texas, after smoke and flames were detected in the main cabin during a test flight. The electrical fire caused some systems to fail before landing. Following this incident, Boeing suspended flight testing on November 10, 2010; ground testing continued. After investigation, the in-flight fire was primarily attributed to foreign object debris (FOD) that was present in the electrical bay. After electrical system and software changes, the 787 resumed flight testing on December 23, 2010.

=== Test evaluation and certification ===

On November 5, 2010, it was reported that some 787 deliveries would be delayed to address problems found during flight testing. In January 2011, the first 787 delivery was rescheduled to the third quarter of 2011 due to software and electrical updates following the in-flight fire. By February 24, 2011, the 787 had completed 80% of the test conditions for the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine and 60% of the conditions for the General Electric GEnx-1B engine. In July 2011, ANA performed a week of operations testing using a 787 in Japan. The test aircraft had flown 4,828 hours in 1,707 flights combined by August 15, 2011. During testing, the 787 visited 14 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America to test in extreme climates and conditions and for route testing.

On August 13, 2011, certification testing of the Rolls-Royce powered 787-8 finished. The FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency certified the 787 on August 26, 2011, at a ceremony in Everett, Washington.

===Entry into service===

Certification cleared the way for deliveries and in 2011, Boeing prepared to increase 787 production rates from two to ten aircraft per month at assembly lines in Everett and Charleston over two years. Legal difficulties clouded production at Charleston; on April 20, 2011, the National Labor Relations Board alleged that a second production line in South Carolina violated two sections of the National Labor Relations Act. In December 2011, the National Labor Relations Board dropped its lawsuit after the Machinists&#x27; union withdrew its complaint as part of a new contract with Boeing. The first 787 assembled in South Carolina was rolled out on April 27, 2012.
The first 787 was officially delivered to All Nippon Airways (ANA) on September 25, 2011, at the Boeing Everett factory. A ceremony to mark the occasion was also held the next day. On September 27, it flew to Tokyo Haneda Airport. The airline took delivery of the second 787 on October 13, 2011.

On October 26, 2011, an ANA 787 flew the first commercial flight from Tokyo&#x27;s Narita International Airport to Hong Kong International Airport. The Dreamliner entered service some three years later than originally planned. Tickets for the flight were sold in an online auction; the highest bidder had paid $34,000 for a seat. An ANA 787 flew its first long-haul flight to Europe on January 21, 2012, from Haneda to Frankfurt Airport.

===Proposed variants===

==== Freighter version ====
Even after production of the 787 began, Boeing continued to produce the 767 as a freighter. More stringent emissions and noise limits will go into effect in 2028 and prevent 767 sales in its current form. To address this concern, Boeing has widely reported to be working on a freighter version of the 787, showing proposals to customers including FedEx Express. , production of the 787 Freighter is expected to begin between 2028 and 2033.

====787-3====
The 787-3 would have carried 290–330 passengers in two-class over range, limited by a MTOW. In April 2008, to keep the −8 on track for delivery, the −9 stretch was postponed from 2010 to at least 2012 and prioritized before the 787-3 and its 43 orders to follow without a firm delivery date.

It kept the −8 length but its 51.7 m wingspan would have fit in ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code D. It was designed to operate on Boeing 757-300/Boeing 767-200 sized regional routes from airports with restricted gate spacing. The wingspan was decreased by using blended winglets instead of raked wingtips.

By January 2010, all orders, from Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, had been converted to the 787-8. As it was designed specifically for the Japanese market, Boeing would likely scrap it after they switched orders. The −8&#x27;s longer wingspan makes it more efficient on stages longer than . In December 2010, Boeing withdrew the short-haul model as it struggled to produce the 787-8 after program delays of three years.

===Market and costs===
The 787 Dreamliner program has reportedly cost Boeing $32 billion. In 2013, the 787 program was expected to be profitable after 1,100 aircraft have been sold.
At the end of 2013, the cost of producing a 787 exceeded the purchase price. Boeing&#x27;s accounting method books sales immediately and distributes estimated production costs over ten years for the 1,300 aircraft it expects to deliver during that time. JPMorgan Chase analyst Joseph Nadol estimated the program&#x27;s cash loss to be $45 million per airplane, decreasing as the program moves forward. The actual cash flow reflects Boeing collecting most of the purchase price upon delivery; Boeing expects deferred costs to total $25 billion before the company begins to break even on production; the comparable number for the Boeing 777, adjusted for inflation, is $3.7 billion.

Boeing lost $30 million per 787 delivered in the first quarter of 2015, although Boeing planned to break even by the end of the year.
The accumulated losses for the 787 totaled almost $27 billion (~$ in ) by May 2015. The cost of producing the fuselage may increase because of a tentative deal reached with Spirit Aerosystems of Wichita, Kansas, wherein severe price cuts demanded by Boeing would be eased, in return for a comprehensive agreement that lowers the cost of fuselages for other jetliners that Spirit helps Boeing manufacture.

In the second quarter of 2015, Boeing lost $25 million (~$ in ) on each 787 delivered but was planning to break even per plane before the year-end. After that Boeing hoped to build 900 Dreamliners over six years at an average profit of more than $35 million each. But with deferred costs peaking in 2016 at $33 billion, (~$ in ) Leeham analyst Bjorn Fehrm believes Boeing cannot make an overall profit on the program. Ted Piepenbrock, an academic affiliated with MIT and the University of Oxford, projects losses decreasing through the first 700 airliners and forecasts the cumulative deferred costs to peak beyond $34 billion. The model most favorable to Boeing projects a program loss of $5 billion after delivering 2,000 Dreamliners. Boeing&#x27;s original development investment, estimated at least at a further $20 billion, is not included in these costs.

To recoup the deferred costs and earn its goal of a &quot;low single-digit&quot; overall profit margin, Boeing has to make an average profit of more than $50 million on the final 205 airplanes of the accounting block to be delivered from 2020: a profit margin of more than 30% while the mature Boeing 737 and 777 programs have 20% to 25% margins. Boeing is reaching it through a larger proportion of the 20% to 40% higher price −9/10s, costing only 5% to 10% more than the −8 with lower production costs from reliability and producibility investments and the expected experience curve. Former Douglas Aircraft chief economist Adam Pilarski notes that two assembly sites slow the experience curve. Boeing assumed a faster improvement than on previous programs which had not happened. Competition with the Airbus A350 and the launch of the A330neo put strong pressure on the 787 pricing.

On July 21, 2016, Boeing reported charges of $847 million against two flight-test 787s built in 2009. Boeing had planned to refurbish and sell them but instead wrote them off as research and development expense.
In 2017, Boeing&#x27;s Jim Albaugh said that the requested return on net assets (RONA) led to outsourcing systems reducing investment, but improving RONA had to be balanced against the risk of loss of control.
From 2019, Boeing was to build 14 787s per month (168 per year), helping to offset the $28 billion in deferred production costs accumulated through 2015 and would add 100 aircraft to the current accounting block of 1,300 at the end of 2017 third quarter.
In 2019, the list price for a 787-8 was US$248.3M, $292.5M for a 787-9, and $338.4M for a 787-10.

The valuation for a new 787-9 is $145 million in 2018, up from $135 million in 2014, but it may have been sold for $110–115 million to prevent A330neo sales while an A330-900 is worth $115 million. In February 2018, Boeing priced six 787-9s for less than $100–115m each to Hawaiian Airlines, close to their production cost of $80–90m, to overcome its A330-800 order.
By late 2018, deferred production costs were reduced from a peak of $27.6 billion in early 2016 to $23.5 billion as assembly efficiency improved and the 800th production started.

===Production rate===
By 2014, Boeing planned to improve financial return by reorganizing the production line, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and labor unions, and increasing the 787 production rate, stepwise, to 12 airplanes per month by the end of 2016 and 14 airplanes per month by the end of the decade. By April 2015, the production rate was 10 per month.

From late 2020, the production rate is to be reduced from 14 to 12 airplanes per month due to the China-United States trade war. Production could be trimmed to 10 planes per month as demand for wide-body aircraft falters. On October 1, 2020, Boeing announced the 787 would be produced only in North Charleston from mid-2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, as the production rate fell to six per month. In December, the monthly rate was further reduced to five.

=== Quality-control issues (2019–2024) ===

==== 2019 ====
In 2019, reports began to emerge about quality-control issues at the North Charleston plant leading to questions about the jet&#x27;s safety; and later that same year KLM, which had discovered loose seats, missing and incorrectly installed pins, nuts and bolts not fully tightened and a fuel-line clamp left unsecured on its jet, complained that the standard of manufacture was &quot;way below acceptable standards.&quot;

==== 2020 ====
Early in 2020, Boeing engineers complained about depressions in the 787&#x27;s vertical tail fin, affecting hundreds of planes or the vast majority of the fleet. Workers in Charleston and Everett had improperly discarded shims before the final installation of fasteners, which could lead to structural failure under limited loads. In late August 2020, Boeing grounded eight 787s due to such improper fuselage shimming and inner skin surfacing issues—issues which proved to have been discovered in August 2019 at Boeing South Carolina.

The following month, Boeing admitted that &quot;nonconforming&quot; sections of the rear fuselage did not meet engineering standards, and the FAA was investigating quality-control lapses dating back to the introduction of the 787 in 2011 and considering requiring additional inspections for up to 900 of the roughly 1,000 Dreamliners in service. The FAA then began to inquire into the company&#x27;s Quality Management System (QMS), which Boeing had previously argued justified a reduction of 900 quality inspectors, but which had failed to detect either the shim or skin surface issues. A third quality-control issue then emerged, this time with the 787&#x27;s horizontal stabilizers, and affecting as many as 893 Dreamliners: workers in Salt Lake City had clamped portions of the tail section too tightly, which could lead to premature material fatigue. At this point Boeing expected a one-time inspection during regularly scheduled maintenance to address the issues and expected merely to slow 787 deliveries &quot;in the near term&quot;.

==== 2021 ====
By January 2021, Boeing had halted 787 deliveries to complete the inspection relating to poor quality control, then in March the FAA withdrew Boeing&#x27;s delegated authority to inspect and sign off on four new 787s, saying that it would extend this withdrawal to further aircraft if needed. Boeing briefly resumed deliveries on March 26, 2021, handing over one 787-9 to United Airlines, but deliveries ceased again in May 2021; meaning that almost all deliveries had been paused for nearly a year. The delay generated $1 billion in abnormal costs and caused the company to cut production to around two planes a month.

On July 13, Boeing discovered gaps at joints in the forward pressure bulkhead and again reduced production; the company also investigated whether the issue affected 787s already in service. Questions were asked about the inspection process used to check the work, and Boeing worked with the FAA to fix the problem, which was said to pose &quot;no immediate threat to flight safety&quot; and did not require 787s already in service to be grounded.

On September 4, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the FAA would not accept Boeing&#x27;s proposed new inspection method, aiming to speed deliveries with targeted checks rather than nose-to-tail teardowns, until at least late October; and in late November it was reported that the FAA had discovered further problems, including additional out of tolerance gaps and contamination and associated weakening of fuselage composites. The rectification process for existing aircraft was made more complex by a lack of detailed configuration data on each aircraft. The new problems and the extension of the 13 month long disruption to 787 deliveries led to anger from buyers; a slide in the company&#x27;s stock price; and demands by a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives for a review of the FAA&#x27;s oversight of the plane.

==== 2022 ====
In January 2022, it was reported that deliveries were not anticipated to restart until April 2022. In February, the FAA announced that it would withdraw Boeing&#x27;s delegated authority to issue airworthiness certificates for individual 787 aircraft until Boeing can demonstrate consistent quality, stable delivery processes, and a robust plan for the rework needed on the undelivered aircraft in storage. In late March Boeing began sounding out suppliers about their ability to support the production of up to seven aircraft a month by late 2023. Vistara, which had been expecting delivery of four Dreamliners in 2022, indicated a lack of confidence in Boeing meeting its delivery aims by arranging to lease aircraft instead. Later in April reports began to emerge of a further delay of at least two months, and it was only in late April that Boeing submitted the necessary certification package laying out the inspections and repairs to be undertaken on already constructed planes. The FAA rejected portions of the package as incomplete and returned it to Boeing, indicating a further delay before the resumption of deliveries. In late July, the FAA approved Boeing&#x27;s revised certification package, leading the company to anticipate resuming deliveries &quot;within days&quot;. Deliveries resumed on August 10, 2022, after the FAA granted clearance.

==== 2023 ====
In February 2023, a further problem, of an analysis error by a supplier related to the 787 forward pressure bulkhead, was identified, leading to a further temporary halt in deliveries (but not in production) and a 5% drop in the company&#x27;s share price. On March 10, the FAA approved the resumption of the deliveries.

==== 2024 ====
In April 2024, Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour reported that the 787&#x27;s (as well as the 777&#x27;s) fuselage had been improperly assembled and that it could cause individual aircraft to break apart in mid-air. Salehpour also claimed that he tried to raise these concerns to Boeing but was reprimanded by the company. The FAA is investigating Salehpour&#x27;s allegations. Boeing released a statement rejecting these claims.

==Design==

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a long-haul, widebody, twin-engine jetliner, designed with lightweight structures that are 80% composite by volume; Boeing lists its materials by weight as 50% composite, 20% aluminum, 15% titanium, 10% steel, and 5% other materials. Aluminum has been used throughout the leading edges of wings and tailplanes, titanium is predominantly present within the elements of the engines and fasteners, while various individual components are composed of steel.

External features include a smooth nose contour, raked wingtips, and engine nacelles with noise-reducing serrated edges (chevrons). The longest-range 787 variant can fly up to , or the even longer Qantas QF 9 flight between Perth and London Heathrow, over . Its cruising airspeed is . The aircraft has a design life of 44,000 flight cycles.

===Flight systems===
Among 787 flight systems, a key change from traditional airliners is the electrical architecture. The architecture is bleedless and replaces bleed air with electrically powered compressors and four of six hydraulic power sources with electrically-driven pumps while eliminating pneumatics and hydraulics from some subsystems, e.g. engine starters and brakes. Boeing says that this system extracts 35% less power from the engines, allowing increased thrust and improved fuel efficiency. Spoiler electromechanical actuators (SEMAs) control two of the seven spoiler pairs on each wing surface, providing roll control, air and ground speed brake, and droop capabilities similar to those provided by the hydraulic actuators used on the remaining spoiler surfaces. The SEMAs are controlled by electronic motor control units (EMCUs).

The total available onboard electrical power is 1.45 megawatts, which is five times the power available on conventional pneumatic airliners; the most notable electrically-powered systems include engine start, cabin pressurization, horizontal-stabilizer trim, and wheel brakes. Wing ice protection is another new system; it uses electro-thermal heater mats on the wing slats instead of traditional hot bleed air. An active gust alleviation system, similar to the system used on the B-2 bomber, improves ride quality during turbulence.
The 787 has a &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; control system similar in architecture to that of the Boeing 777. The flight deck features multi-function LCDs, which use an industry-standard graphical user interface widget toolkit (Cockpit Display System Interfaces to User Systems / ARINC 661). The 787 flight deck includes two head-up displays (HUDs) as a standard feature. Like other Boeing airliners, the 787 uses a yoke (as opposed to a side-stick). Under consideration is the future integration of forward-looking infrared into the HUD for thermal sensing, allowing pilots to &quot;see&quot; through clouds. Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Orion spacecraft will use a glass cockpit derived from Honeywell International&#x27;s 787 flight deck systems.

Honeywell and Rockwell Collins provide flight control, guidance, and other avionics systems, including standard dual head-up guidance systems, Thales supplies the integrated standby flight display and power management, while Meggitt/Securaplane provides the auxiliary power unit (APU) starting system, electrical power-conversion system, and battery-control system with lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) batteries by GS Yuasa. One of the two batteries weighs 28.5 kg and is rated 29.6 V, 76 Ah, giving 2.2 kWh. Battery charging is controlled by four independent systems to prevent overcharging, following early lab testing. The battery systems were the focus of a regulatory investigation due to multiple lithium battery fires, which led to the grounding of the 787 fleet starting in January 2013.

A version of Ethernet (Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) / ARINC 664) transmits data between the flight deck and aircraft systems. The control, navigation, and communication systems are networked with the passenger cabin&#x27;s in-flight internet systems. In January 2008, FAA concerns were reported regarding possible passenger access to the 787&#x27;s computer networks; Boeing has stated that various protective hardware and software solutions are employed, including air gaps to physically separate the networks, and firewalls for software separation. These measures prevent data transfer from the passenger internet system to the maintenance or navigation systems.

The −9/10 hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) system delays the critical transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far back as possible on the vertical tail by passive suction from leading-edge holes to mid-fin low-pressure doors but was dropped from the tailplane due to lower benefits than the extra complexity and cost.

===Airframe===
The 787 is the first commercial aircraft to have an airframe majority made of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), applied in: the empennage, fuselage, wings, doors, and in most other main components. Each 787 contains approximately of CFRP, made with of pure carbon fiber. CFRP materials have a higher strength-to-weight ratio than conventional aluminum structural materials, which contributes significantly to the 787&#x27;s weight savings, as well as superior fatigue behavior. Historically, the first CFRP primary structure in Boeing commercial aircraft was put into service in 1984 on the horizontal tail of the Boeing 737 Classic, and in the mid-1990s on both vertical and horizontal tail (empennage) of the Boeing 777. In the early 2000s, while studying the proposed Sonic Cruiser, Boeing built and tested the first CFRP fuselage section for commercial aircraft, a long anechoic chamber, which later applied to the Dreamliner. Instead of designing one-piece composite fuselage barrels like the 787, the competing Airbus A350 uses a slightly more conventional approach with CFRP panels on CFRP frames, which is considered less risky in terms of assembly tolerance between fuselage sections.

Safety can be a concern due to lower impact energy absorption and poorer fire, smoke and toxicity capability of CFRP fuselages in the event of a crash landing, leading to whistleblower complaints at Boeing by Vince Weldon, who was fired in 2006. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) later denied Weldon whistleblower status &quot;largely on the grounds that Boeing&#x27;s 787 design does not violate any FAA regulations or standards&quot;. Boeing further argued that CFRP structures have been used on empennages and other parts of airliners for many years without incident, and special damage detection procedures will be instituted for the 787 to detect any potential hidden damage.

In 2006, Boeing launched the 787 GoldCare program. This is an optional, comprehensive life-cycle management service, whereby aircraft in the program are routinely monitored and repaired, as needed. Although the first program of its kind from Boeing, post-sale protection programs are not new; such programs are usually offered by third party service centers. Boeing is also designing and testing composite hardware so inspections are mainly visual. This reduces the need for ultrasonic and other non-visual inspection methods, saving time and money.

===Interior===

The 787-8 is designed to typically seat 234 passengers in a three-class setup, 240 in two-class domestic configuration, and 296 passengers in a high-density economy arrangement. Seat rows can be arranged in four to seven abreast in first or business—e.g., 1–⁠2–⁠1, 2–⁠2–⁠2, or 2–⁠3–⁠2. Eight or nine abreast are options in economy—e.g., 2–⁠4–⁠2 or 3–⁠3–⁠3. Typical seat room ranges from pitch in first, in business, and in economy.

Cabin interior width is approximately at armrest level. The Dreamliner&#x27;s cabin width is more than that of the Airbus A330 and A340, less than the A350, and less than the 777. The 787&#x27;s economy seats can be up to wide for nine-abreast seating and up to wide for eight-abreast seating arrangements. Most airlines are selecting the nine-abreast (3–3–3) configuration. The 787&#x27;s nine-abreast seating for economy provides passengers less space, particularly across the hips and shoulders, than any other jet airliner. Some observers recommended passengers avoid flying 787s with nine-abreast seating, although others suggested that the 787 is more comfortable than other airliners.

The 787&#x27;s cabin windows have dimensions of , and a high eye level so passengers can maintain a view of the horizon. The composite fuselage permits larger windows without the need for structural reinforcement. Instead of plastic window shades, the windows use electrochromism-based smart glass (supplied by PPG Industries) allowing flight attendants and passengers to adjust five levels of sunlight and visibility to their liking, reducing cabin glare while maintaining a view to the outside world, but the most opaque setting still has some transparency. While the lavatory window also uses smart glass, it was given a traditional sunshade.

The 787&#x27;s cabin features light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as standard equipment, allowing the aircraft to be entirely &quot;bulbless&quot;. LED lights have previously been an option on the Boeing 777 and Airbus aircraft fitted with standard fluorescent lights. The system has three-color LEDs plus a white LED. The 787 interior was designed to better accommodate persons with mobility, sensory, and cognitive disabilities. For example, a convertible lavatory includes a movable center wall that allows two separate lavatories to become one large wheelchair-accessible facility.

The 787&#x27;s internal cabin pressure is the equivalent of altitude, resulting in a higher pressure than for the altitude of older conventional aircraft. According to Boeing, in a joint study with Oklahoma State University, this significantly improves passenger comfort. Cabin air pressurization is provided by electrically driven compressors, rather than traditional engine-bleed air, thereby eliminating the need to cool heated air before it enters the cabin. The cabin&#x27;s humidity is programmable based on the number of passengers carried and allows 15% humidity settings instead of the 4% found in previous aircraft. The composite fuselage avoids metal fatigue issues associated with higher cabin pressure and eliminates the risk of corrosion from higher humidity levels. The cabin air-conditioning system improves air quality by removing ozone from outside air and, besides standard HEPA filters, which remove airborne particles, uses a gaseous filtration system to remove odors, irritants, and gaseous contaminants, as well as particulates like viruses, bacteria and allergens.

=== Engines ===
The 787 is powered by two engines, which use all-electrical bleedless systems taken from the Sonic Cruiser, eliminating the superheated air conduits normally used for aircraft power, de-icing, and other functions. As part of its &quot;Quiet Technology Demonstrator 2&quot; project, Boeing adopted several engine noise-reducing technologies for the 787. These include an air inlet containing sound-absorbing materials and exhaust duct cover with a chevron-toothed pattern on the rim for a quieter mixing of exhaust and outside air. Boeing expects these developments to make the 787 significantly quieter both inside and out. The noise-reducing measures prevent sounds above 85 decibels from leaving airport boundaries.

The two different engine models compatible with the 787 use a standard electrical interface to allow an aircraft to be fitted with either Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 or General Electric GEnx-1B engines. This interchangeability aims to save time and cost when changing engine types; while previous aircraft could exchange engines for those of a different manufacturer, the high cost and time required made it rare. In 2006, Boeing addressed reports of an extended change period by stating that the 787 engine swap was intended to take 24 hours.

In 2016, Rolls-Royce began flight testing its new Trent 1000 TEN engine. It has a new compressor system based on the compressor in Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine and a new turbine design for extra thrust, up to . Rolls-Royce plans to offer the TEN on the 787-8, −9 and −10. In early 2020, of 1484 orders, 905 selected GE (61.0%), 476 selected RR (32.1%) and 103 were undecided (6.90%).

== Operational history ==

On December 6, 2011, test aircraft ZA006 (sixth 787), powered by General Electric GEnx engines, flew non-stop from Boeing Field eastward to Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, Bangladesh, setting a new world distance record for aircraft in the 787&#x27;s weight class, which is between . This flight surpassed the previous record of , set in 2002 by an Airbus A330. The Dreamliner then continued eastbound from Dhaka to return to Boeing Field, setting a world-circling speed record of 42 hours, 27 minutes. In December 2011, Boeing started a six-month promotion 787 world tour, visiting various cities in China, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, United States, and others. In April 2012, an ANA 787 made a delivery flight from Boeing Field to Haneda Airport partially using biofuel from cooking oil.
ANA surveyed 800 passengers who flew the 787 from Tokyo to Frankfurt: expectations were surpassed for 90% of passengers; features that met or exceeded expectations included air quality and cabin pressure (90% of passengers), cabin ambiance (92% of passengers), higher cabin humidity levels (80% of passengers), headroom (40% of passengers) and the larger windows (90% of passengers). 25% said they would go out of their way to again fly on the 787.

After its first six months of service, Rolls-Royce powered ANA aircraft were burning around 21% less fuel than the replaced 767-300ER on international flights, slightly better than the 20% originally expected, and 15–20% on domestic routes, while GE-powered Japan Airlines aircraft were potentially slightly better. Other 787 operators have reported similar fuel savings, ranging from 20 to 22% compared with the 767-300ER. An analysis by consultant AirInsight concluded that United Airlines&#x27; 787s achieved an operating cost per seat that was 6% lower than the Airbus A330. In November 2017, International Airlines Group chief Willie Walsh said that for its budget carrier Level the lower cost of ownership of its two A330-200 more than offsets the higher fuel burn ($3,500 on a Barcelona-Los Angeles flight). It would introduce three more A330s as there were not enough 787 pilots.
Early operators discovered that if the APS5000 Auxiliary power unit was shut down with the inlet door closed, heat continued to build up in the tail compartment and cause the rotor shaft to bow. It could take up to two hours for the shaft to straighten again. This was particularly acute on short haul flights as there was insufficient time to allow the unit to cool before a restart was needed. Procedures were modified and the APU was later redesigned to address the issue.
On September 15, 2012, the NTSB requested the grounding of certain 787s due to GE engine failures; GE believed the production problem had been fixed by that time. In December 2012, responding to unhappiness within the airline industry at the continuing issues affecting the aircraft, Boeing CEO James McNerney stated that he regretted the impact on passengers: he went on to say that the 787&#x27;s issues had been no greater than those experienced with the introduction of other Boeing models such as the 777.

In March 2014, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries informed Boeing of a new problem that was caused by a change in manufacturing processes. Employees did not fill gaps with shims to connect wing rib aluminum shear ties to the carbon composite wing panels; the tightened fasteners, without shims, cause excessive stress that creates hairline cracks in the wings, which could enlarge and cause further damage. Forty-two aircraft awaiting delivery were affected, and each required one to two weeks to inspect and repair. Boeing did not expect this problem to affect the overall delivery schedule, even if some airplanes were delivered late.
Dispatch reliability is an industry standard measure of the rate of departure from the gate with no more than 15 minutes delay due to technical issues. The 787-8 started out with a ~96% operational reliability, increasing to ~98.5% in April 2015. Daily utilization increased from five hours in 2013 to twelve hours in 2014. Dispatch reliability grew to 99.3% in 2017.
Airlines have often assigned the 787 to routes previously flown by larger aircraft that could not return a profit. For example, Air Canada offered a Toronto-Pearson to New Delhi route, first utilizing a Lockheed L1011, then a Boeing 747-400, then an Airbus A340-300, but none of these types were efficient enough to generate profit. The airline operated the route profitably with a 787-9, and credits the right number of seats and greater fuel efficiency for this success.

Up to June 30, 2017, after 565 units were delivered since 2011: 60% -8 (340) and 40% -9 (225), the airports with most 787 departures are Haneda Airport with 304 weekly, Narita Airport with 276 and Doha Airport with 265. By the end of 2017, there were 39 airlines operating the 787 on 983 routes with an average length of , including 163 new routes (17%). , the 787&#x27;s longest route is Qantas&#x27; Perth-London Heathrow, a distance of and the second-longest regular scheduled flight behind Qatar Airways&#x27; route from Doha to Auckland, flown with a Boeing 777-200LR. In March 2020, Air Tahiti Nui executed a record commercial flight of , from Papeete to Paris-Charles de Gaulle, on a route that would typically refuel at Los Angeles but was able to fly the Boeing 787-9 non-stop because it was &quot;nowhere near full&quot; due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2023, the first 787s to be withdrawn from commercial service, two 10-year-old -8s, were torn down by Irish company EirTrade Aviation, as they would otherwise have shortly required 12-year checks and landing-gear overhauls. The used parts were in high demand amid the post-pandemic global shortage. There is no obvious recycling path for the carbon composite airframe.

==Variants==
The shortest Dreamliner variant, the 787-8 was the first variant to fly in December 2009, then the longer 787-9 in September 2013, followed by the longest variant, the 787-10, in March 2017. These variants are called &quot;B788&quot;, &quot;B789&quot;, and &quot;B78X&quot;, respectively in the list of ICAO aircraft type designators. The short-range 787-3 was canceled in 2010.

===787-8===
With a typical capacity of 248 passengers and a range of , the −8 is the base model of the 787 family and was the first to enter service in 2011. The 787-8 is targeted to replace the Boeing 767-200ER and Airbus A330-200, as well as expand into new non-stop markets where larger planes would not be economically viable. , approximately 26% of 787 orders are for the 787-8 with 386 delivered. 

In 2018, Boeing said it would change the −8 manufacturing to raise its commonality with the −9 above the current 30% to be more like the 95% commonality between the −9 and −10, as it will benefit from learning from those. When it was launched, a new 787-8 was to cost only slightly more than the 767-300ER, valued new for $85 million at its 1990s peak, but it ended being 20% more costly. It competes with the Airbus A330-800.

===787-9===
Keeping the same wingspan as the 787-8, the 787-9 is a lengthened and strengthened variant with a longer fuselage and a higher maximum take-off weight (MTOW), seating 296 passengers in a typical two-class cabin configuration over a range. It features active boundary-layer control on the tail surfaces, reducing drag. The 787-9 is targeted to replace the Boeing 767-300ER and Airbus A330-300. It competes with the Airbus A330-900.

In 2005, the entry into service (EIS) was planned for 2010. The firm configuration was finalized on July 1, 2010. By October 2011, deliveries were scheduled to begin in 2014.

The prototype 787-9 made its maiden flight from Paine Field on September 17, 2013. By November 8, 2013, it had flown 141 hours. A 787-9 was on static display at the 2014 Farnborough Air Show prior to first delivery. On July 8, 2014, Launch customer Air New Zealand took its first 787-9, in a distinctive black livery in a ceremony at Paine Field. The first revenue service was operated by All Nippon Airways on August 7, 2014. Air New Zealand operating its first commercial flight from Auckland to Sydney on August 9, 2014.
The 787-9 was to begin commercial service with All Nippon Airways on August 7, 2014. United Airlines was to start the longest nonstop scheduled 787 service between Los Angeles and Melbourne in October 2014. Air China started a 787-9 route between Beijing and Chengdu in May 2016. , 63% of all 787 orders are for the 787-9, with 580 deliveries. A 2014 787-9 leased for $1.05 million per month, and fell to $925,000 per month in 2018.

The stretch was achieved by adding (five-frame) extensions forward and aft of the wing. The 787-8 and 787-9 have 50% commonality: the wing, fuselage and systems of the 787-8 had required radical revision to achieve the payload-range goals of the 787-9. Following a major revamp of the original 787-8 wing, the latest configuration for the 787-9 and −10 is the fourth design evolution.

On March 25, 2018, a Qantas 787-9 completed the first scheduled non-stop flight between Australia and the UK flying seventeen hours from Perth to London Heathrow. On October 20, 2019, a Qantas 787-9 was flight tested from New York to Sydney with a restricted payload. A team of researchers monitored passengers and crew to investigate wellness and performance on long flights. On March 16, 2020, an Air Tahiti Nui 787-9 achieved the longest commercial flight of .

===787-10===

In December 2005, pushed by the interest of Emirates and Qantas, Boeing was studying the possibility of stretching the 787-9 further to seat 290 to 310 passengers. This variant would be similar to the capacity of the Boeing 777-200 and the Airbus A350-900, although with a shorter range. Customer discussions were continuing in early 2006. Mike Bair, Boeing&#x27;s vice president and general manager for the 787 development program at the time, said it was easier to proceed with the 787-10 development after other customers followed Emirates&#x27; request. This variant is targeted to replace the Boeing 767-400ER and Airbus A330-300.
On May 30, 2013, Singapore Airlines became the launch customer by stating it would order 30 787-10s (provided Boeing launched the program), to be delivered in 2018–2019. On June 18, 2013, Boeing officially launched the 787-10 at the Paris Air Show, with orders or commitments for 102 aircraft from Air Lease Corporation (30), Singapore Airlines (30), United Airlines (20), British Airways (12), and GE Capital Aviation Services (10). As of January 2023, the aircraft has 189 orders out of which 115 have been delivered, 7 of which are stored.
This variant was envisioned as replacing Boeing 777-200 and Airbus A340-500 aircraft. It competes with the Airbus A350-900, and according to Boeing, it offers better economics than its Airbus competitor on shorter routes. Steven Udvar-Hazy said, &quot;If it&#x27;s identically configured, the −10 has a little bit of an edge on the −900&quot;, but smaller than Boeing&#x27;s estimate of 10 percent. The 787-10 is long, seats 336 passengers in a two-class cabin configuration, and has a range of .
Boeing completed detailed design for the −10 on December 2, 2015. Major assembly began in March 2016. Designers targeted 90% commonality between the 787-9 and −10 and achieved 95%; the stretch was reached by adding 10 ft forward of the wing and 8 ft aft, and by strengthening the fuselage for bending loads in the center wingbox. Because of the length and additional tail strike protection needed, a semilevered landing gear enables rotation over the aft wheels rather than at the bogie center, like the 777-300ER, and the cabin air conditioning system has 15% more capacity. The first and third −10 test-platforms incorporate Rolls-Royce&#x27;s new Trent 1000 TEN engines, while the second is powered by the competing General Electric GEnx-1B engine.
Major fuselage parts were received for final assembly on November 30, 2016. The 787-10&#x27;s mid-fuselage sections are too large for transport to Everett, Washington and it is built only in Charleston, South Carolina; it is the first Boeing airliner assembled exclusively there. The first −10 was rolled out on February 17, 2017. The variant&#x27;s first flight took place on March 31, 2017, and lasted 4 hours and 48 minutes.
The first test 787-10 aircraft is engaged in flight envelope expansion work and the second joined the program in early May 2017, while the third with a passenger cabin interior to test the uprated environmental control system and Trent fuel-burn performance was scheduled to join in June. The −10 was scheduled to appear at the 2017 Paris Air Show. The second −10 is being used to prove the GE Aviation engines and the third made its first flight on June 8, 2017, when the flight-test programme was 30% complete. Boeing finished final assembly and painting of the first production 787-10 in October 2017, before its certification. The last stages of flight tests focused on fuel burn validation and revised flight control software.

At the start of the November 2017 Dubai Air Show, the 787-10 had 171 orders; Emirates committed to 40 787-10s, in two- and three-class cabins for 240 to 330 passengers, to be delivered from 2022 and with conversion rights to the smaller 787-9. These aircraft are adapted for 7–8.5 hour missions, in a 280-seat three–class layout. Emirates&#x27; Tim Clark was doubtful it would meet its MTOW for the payload-range required with initial thrust engines, but with the current turbofans and the −9 early margins gave the −10 &quot;stellar economics&quot;. By early 2019, Emirates was considering canceling its 787-10 order, due to engine margins being insufficient for the hot Dubai weather, in favor of the Airbus A350 (which would also replace its last Airbus A380 order). At the 2019 Dubai Air Show, Emirates placed an order for 30 787-9 aircraft rather than the 787-10.
In January 2018, the −10 was certified by the FAA after testing for 900 flight hours. Boeing received its production certificate on February 15. It was first delivered to launch customer Singapore Airlines on March 25, 2018. Fitted with 337 seats, 36 in business and 301 in economy, the −10 began commercial service on April 3, 2018.
The 8.7% fuselage stretch from the −9 to the −10 likely increased empty weight at a lower rate than the 7.4% growth from the −8 to the −9 due to the 10.7% stretch. Software changes increased the tailplane effectiveness to avoid modifying it. With the same wing but a longer fuselage than the −9, the flutter margin was reduced for the −10 but to avoid stiffening the wing or adding wingtip counterweights for commonality, software oscillates the elevators in the flaps up vertical mode suppression system (F0VMS), similar to the vertical gust load alleviation system.

To replace Air New Zealand&#x27;s 777-200 fleet, Boeing wants to increase the 787-10 MTOW by over to with some reinforcements and updated fuel systems.
This would allow more range, such as the trip from Auckland to Los Angeles with no passenger restrictions and some cargo.
The increased performance could trickle down to the 787-9, allowing Auckland to New York flights.

===BBJ 787===
The 787-8 and −9 are offered as Boeing Business Jets, the first offering of floor space and a range of ), the other and , both with 25 passengers.
Through June 2018, fifteen have been ordered, twelve delivered and four were in service.

===Experimental===

Two 787 aircraft have been used in Boeing&#x27;s ecoDemonstrator program which aims to develop technology and techniques to reduce the environmental effects of aviation. The testing involves many partner organizations including engine and systems manufacturers, NASA, academic, research, and regulatory institutions. The program started in 2011 with a different airframe being used each year.

In 2014, the fourth prototype 787-8 was used for tests including use of sustainable aviation fuel, ceramic matrix composite engine exhaust nozzles, and systems for improved air traffic control (ATC) communications and closer landing approach spacing. In 2020, a new 787-10 took part in the program, including intensive noise reduction trials, and including text-based ATC communications and cabin hygiene and cleansing tests related to the COVID-19 pandemic. After removal of the test equipment, the aircraft was delivered to Etihad Airways.

In April 2023, Boeing announced the ecoDemonstrator Explorer program, which would run alongside the ecoDemonstrator program. The first Explorer program in 2023 tested international route planning (trajectory-based operations – a major aim of the FAA&#x27;s NextGen project) and maximization of sustainable aviation fuel use for a planned 10% fuel efficiency gain, using a 787-10.

==Operators==


There are 1,006 Boeing 787 aircraft in airline service , comprising 377 787-8s, 568 787-9s and 61 787-10s, with outstanding orders for further 481 aircraft. , the largest operators are All Nippon Airways (77), United Airlines (63), Japan Airlines (47), and American Airlines (46).

===Orders and deliveries===

In September 2011, the 787 was first officially delivered to launch customer All Nippon Airways. , the top five identified 787 customers are American Airlines with 89 orders (37 -8s and 52 -9s), All Nippon Airways with 83 orders (36 -8s, 44 -9s and three −10s), ILFC (an aircraft leasing company) with 74 orders (23 -8s and 51 -9s), and United Airlines (12 -8s, 38 -9s and 21 -10s) and Etihad Airways (41 -9s, 30 -10s), both with 71 orders.

On December 13, 2018, the 787th Boeing 787 was delivered to AerCap and leased to China Southern Airlines. By then the 787 had flown 300 million passengers on 1.5 million flights and opened 210 new nonstop routes. The 1000th Dreamliner, a 787-10 for Singapore Airlines, made its maiden flight on April 3, 2020.
== Accidents and incidents ==

The Boeing 787 has been involved in seven accidents and incidents , with zero fatalities and no hull losses.

===Operational problems===
A Japan Airlines (JAL) 787 experienced a fuel leak on January 8, 2013, and its flight from Boston was canceled. The next day, United Airlines reported a problem in one of its six 787s with the wiring near the main batteries. Soon, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board opened a safety probe. Fuel leaks also occurred on January 11, 2013 and on January 13, 2013, at Narita International Airport outside Tokyo. The aircraft reportedly was the same one that had a fuel leak on January 8. Japan&#x27;s transport ministry also launched an investigation.

On January 11, 2013, the FAA completed a comprehensive review of the 787&#x27;s critical systems including the design, manufacture, and assembly. The Department of Transportation secretary Ray LaHood stated the administration was &quot;looking for the root causes&quot; behind the recent issues. The head of the FAA, Michael Huerta, said that so far nothing found &quot;suggests [the 787] is not safe.&quot;

On July 12, 2013, a fire started on an empty Ethiopian Airlines 787 parked at Heathrow Airport before it was extinguished by the airport fire and rescue service. No injuries were reported. The fire caused extensive heat damage to the aircraft. The FAA and NTSB sent representatives to assist in the investigation. The initial investigation found no direct link with the aircraft&#x27;s main batteries. Further investigations indicated that the fire was due to lithium-manganese dioxide batteries powering an emergency locator transmitter (ELT). The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) issued a special bulletin on July 18, 2013, requesting the US FAA ensure that the locator is removed or disconnected in Boeing 787s and to review the safety of lithium battery-powered ELT systems in other aircraft types. On August 19, 2015, the Associated Press reported that the fire was started by a short circuit caused by crossed wires located under the battery. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch&#x27;s investigators recommended that &quot;the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, together with similar bodies in Europe and Canada, should conduct a review of equipment powered by lithium metal batteries to ensure they have &#x27;an acceptable level of circuit protection.&#x27;&quot;

On July 26, 2013, ANA said it had found wiring damage on two 787 locator beacons. United Airlines also reported that it had found a pinched wire in one 787 locator beacon. On August 14, 2013, the media reported a fire extinguisher fault affecting three ANA airplanes, which caused the fire extinguishers to discharge into the opposite engine from the one requested. The fault was caused by a supplier assembly error.

On November 22, 2013, Boeing issued an advisory to airlines using General Electric GEnx engines on 787 and 747-8 aircraft to avoid flying near high-level thunderstorms due to an increased risk of icing on the engines. The problem was caused by a buildup of ice crystals just behind the main fan causing a brief loss of thrust on six occasions.

On January 21, 2014, a Norwegian Air Shuttle 787 experienced a fuel leak which caused a 19-hour delay to a flight from Bangkok to Oslo. The leak became known to pilots only after it was pointed out by concerned passengers. It was found later that a faulty valve was responsible. This fuel leak is one of numerous problems experienced by Norwegian Air Shuttle&#x27;s 787 fleet. Mike Fleming, Boeing&#x27;s vice president for 787 support and services, subsequently met with executives of Norwegian Air Shuttle and expressed Boeing&#x27;s commitment to improving the 787&#x27;s dispatch reliability, &quot;we&#x27;re not satisfied with where the airplane is today, flying at a fleet average of 98 percent...The 777 today flies at 99.4 percent...and that&#x27;s the benchmark that the 787 needs to attain.&quot;

In March 2016 the FAA accelerated the release of an airworthiness directive in response to reports indicating that in certain weather conditions &quot;erroneous low airspeed may be displayed...&quot; There was concern &quot;abrupt pilot control inputs in this condition could exceed the structural capability of the airplane.&quot; Pilots were told not to apply &quot;large, abrupt control column inputs&quot; in the event of an &quot;unrealistic&quot; drop in displayed airspeed.

On April 22, 2016, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive following a January 29 incident in which a General Electric GEnx-1B PIP2 engine suffered damage and non-restartable power loss while flying at an altitude of 20,000 feet. The damage is thought to have been caused by a fan imbalance resulting from fan ice shedding.

On June 18, 2021, a British Airways 787-8, registration G-ZBJB, spontaneously suffered a nose gear collapse at London Heathrow Airport while stationary at Stand 583. Photographs circulated after the incident showed the aircraft resting on its nose, with some damage to its nose gear door. No passengers were on board, and the flight was in the process of being loaded with cargo for a cargo-only flight from Heathrow to Frankfurt Airport at the time of the incident. The UK&#x27;s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) determined that an incorrectly inserted pin, used during routine maintenance to prevent the gear retracting when the hydraulics are cycled, was the cause of the accident.

On March 11, 2024, LATAM Airlines Flight 800 experienced a sudden drop in altitude, resulting in 50 injuries to those aboard and 12 with serious injuries being hospitalized. As of March 13, 2024, the cause is still under investigation.

On January 16, 2013, All Nippon Airways Flight 692, en route from Yamaguchi Ube Airport to Tokyo Haneda, had a battery problem warning followed by a burning smell while climbing from Ube about west of Takamatsu, Japan. The aircraft diverted to Takamatsu and was evacuated via the slides; three passengers received minor injuries during the evacuation. Inspection revealed a battery fire. A similar incident in a parked Japan Airlines 787 at Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport within the same week led the Federal Aviation Administration to ground all 787s. On January 16, 2013, both major Japanese airlines ANA and JAL voluntarily grounded their fleets of 787s after multiple incidents involving different 787s, including emergency landings. At the time, these two carriers operated 24 of the 50 787s delivered. The grounding reportedly cost ANA some 9 billion yen (US$93 million) in lost sales.

On January 16, 2013, the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive ordering all American-based airlines to ground their Boeing 787s until yet-to-be-determined modifications were made to the electrical system to reduce the risk of the battery overheating or catching fire. This was the first time that the FAA had grounded an airliner type since 1979. Industry experts disagreed on consequences of the grounding: Airbus was confident that Boeing would resolve the issue and that no airlines will switch plane type, while other experts saw the problem as &quot;costly&quot; and &quot;could take upwards of a year&quot;.

The FAA also conducted an extensive review of the 787&#x27;s critical systems. The focus of the review was on the safety of the lithium-ion batteries made of lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2). The 787 battery contract was signed in 2005, when this was the only type of lithium aerospace battery available, but since then newer and safer types (such as LiFePO4), which provide less reaction energy with virtually no cobalt content to avoid cobalt&#x27;s thermal runaway characteristic, have become available. FAA approved a 787 battery in 2007 with nine &quot;special conditions&quot;. A battery approved by FAA (through Mobile Power Solutions) was made by Rose Electronics using Kokam cells; the batteries installed in the 787 are made by Yuasa.

On January 20, the NTSB declared that overvoltage was not the cause of the Boston incident, as voltage did not exceed the battery limit of 32 V, and the charging unit passed tests. The battery had signs of short circuiting and thermal runaway. Despite this, by January 24, the NTSB had not yet pinpointed the cause of the Boston fire; the FAA would not allow U.S.-based 787s to fly again until the problem was found and corrected. In a press briefing that day, NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said that the NTSB had found evidence of failure of multiple safety systems designed to prevent these battery problems, and stated that fire must never happen on an airplane.

The Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB) said on January 23 that the battery in ANA jets in Japan reached a maximum voltage of 31 V (below the 32 V limit like the Boston JAL 787), but had a sudden unexplained voltage drop to near zero. All cells had signs of thermal damage prior to runaway. ANA and JAL had replaced several 787 batteries before the mishaps. , JTSB approved the Yuasa factory quality control while the NTSB examined the Boston battery for defects. The failure rate, with two major battery thermal runaway events in 100,000 flight hours, was much higher than the rate of one in 10 million flight hours predicted by Boeing.

The only American airline that operated the Dreamliner at the time was United Airlines, which had six. Chile&#x27;s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) grounded LAN Airlines&#x27; three 787s. The Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) directed Air India to ground its six Dreamliners. The Japanese Transport Ministry made the ANA and JAL groundings official and indefinite following the FAA announcement. The European Aviation Safety Agency also followed the FAA&#x27;s advice and grounded the only two European 787s operated by LOT Polish Airlines. Qatar Airways grounded their five Dreamliners. Ethiopian Airlines was the final operator to temporarily ground its four Dreamliners. By January 17, 2013, all 50 of the aircraft delivered to date had been grounded. On January 18, Boeing halted 787 deliveries until the battery problem was resolved.

On February 7, 2013, the FAA gave approval for Boeing to conduct 787 test flights to gather additional data. In February 2013, FAA oversight of the 787&#x27;s 2007 safety approval and certification was under scrutiny. On March 7, 2013, the NTSB released an interim factual report about the Boston battery fire on January 7, 2013. The investigation stated that &quot;heavy smoke and fire coming from the front of the APU battery case.&quot; Firefighters &quot;tried fire extinguishing, but smoke and flame (flame size about ) did not stop&quot;.

Boeing completed its final tests on a revised battery design on April 5, 2013. The FAA approved Boeing&#x27;s revised battery design with three additional, overlapping protection methods on April 19, 2013. The FAA published a directive on April 25 to provide instructions for retrofitting battery hardware before the 787s could return to flight. The repairs were expected to be completed in weeks. Following the FAA approval in the U.S. effective April 26, Japan approved resumption of Boeing 787 flights in the country on April 26, 2013. On April 27, 2013, Ethiopian Airlines took a 787 on the model&#x27;s first commercial flight after battery system modifications.

On January 14, 2014, a battery in a JAL 787 emitted smoke from the battery&#x27;s protection exhaust while the aircraft was undergoing pre-flight maintenance at Tokyo Narita Airport. The battery partially melted in the incident; one of its eight lithium-ion cells had its relief port vent and fluid sprayed inside the battery&#x27;s container. It was later reported that the battery may have reached a temperature as high as , and that Boeing did not understand the root cause of the failure.

The NTSB criticized the FAA, Boeing, and battery manufacturers for the faults in a 2014 report. It also criticized the GE-made flight data and cockpit voice recorder in the same report. The enclosure Boeing added is heavier, negating the lighter battery potential.

<text>Empirical evidence is evidence obtained through sense experience or experimental procedure. It is of central importance to the sciences and plays a role in various other fields, like epistemology and law.

There is no general agreement on how the terms &quot;evidence&quot; and &quot;empirical&quot; are to be defined. Often different fields work with quite different conceptions. In epistemology, evidence is what justifies beliefs or what determines whether holding a certain belief is rational. This is only possible if the evidence is possessed by the person, which has prompted various epistemologists to conceive evidence as private mental states like experiences or other beliefs. In philosophy of science, on the other hand, evidence is understood as that which &quot;confirms&quot; or &quot;disconfirms&quot; scientific hypotheses and arbitrates between competing theories. For this role, evidence must be public and uncontroversial, like observable physical objects or events and unlike private mental states, so that evidence may foster scientific consensus. The term empirical comes from Greek ἐμπειρία &quot;empeiría&quot;, i.e. &#x27;experience&#x27;. In this context, it is usually understood as what is observable, in contrast to unobservable or theoretical objects. It is generally accepted that unaided perception constitutes observation, but it is disputed to what extent objects accessible only to aided perception, like bacteria seen through a microscope or positrons detected in a cloud chamber, should be regarded as observable.

Empirical evidence is essential to &quot;a posteriori&quot; knowledge or empirical knowledge, knowledge whose justification or falsification depends on experience or experiment. &quot;A priori&quot; knowledge, on the other hand, is seen either as innate or as justified by rational intuition and therefore as not dependent on empirical evidence. Rationalism fully accepts that there is knowledge &quot;a priori&quot;, which is either outright rejected by empiricism or accepted only in a restricted way as knowledge of relations between our concepts but not as pertaining to the external world.

Scientific evidence is closely related to empirical evidence but not all forms of empirical evidence meet the standards dictated by scientific methods. Sources of empirical evidence are sometimes divided into observation and experimentation, the difference being that only experimentation involves manipulation or intervention: phenomena are actively created instead of being passively observed.

== Background ==

The concept of evidence is of central importance in epistemology and in philosophy of science but plays different roles in these two fields. In epistemology, evidence is what justifies beliefs or what determines whether holding a certain doxastic attitude is rational. For example, the olfactory experience of smelling smoke justifies or makes it rational to hold the belief that something is burning. It is usually held that for justification to work, the evidence has to be possessed by the believer. The most straightforward way to account for this type of evidence possession is to hold that evidence consists of the private mental states possessed by the believer.

Some philosophers restrict evidence even further, for example, to only conscious, propositional or factive mental states. Restricting evidence to conscious mental states has the implausible consequence that many simple everyday beliefs would be unjustified. This is why it is more common to hold that all kinds of mental states, including stored but currently unconscious beliefs, can act as evidence. Various of the roles played by evidence in reasoning, for example, in explanatory, probabilistic and deductive reasoning, suggest that evidence has to be propositional in nature, i.e. that it is correctly expressed by propositional attitude verbs like &quot;believe&quot; together with a that-clause, like &quot;that something is burning&quot;. But it runs counter to the common practice of treating non-propositional sense-experiences, like bodily pains, as evidence. Its defenders sometimes combine it with the view that evidence has to be factive, i.e. that only attitudes towards true propositions constitute evidence. In this view, there is no misleading evidence. The olfactory experience of smoke would count as evidence if it was produced by a fire but not if it was produced by a smoke generator. This position has problems in explaining why it is still rational for the subject to believe that there is a fire even though the olfactory experience cannot be considered evidence.

In philosophy of science, evidence is understood as that which &quot;confirms&quot; or &quot;disconfirms&quot; scientific hypotheses and arbitrates between competing theories. Measurements of Mercury&#x27;s &quot;anomalous&quot; orbit, for example, constitute evidence that plays the role of &quot;neutral arbiter&quot; between Newton&#x27;s and Einstein&#x27;s theory of gravitation by confirming Einstein&#x27;s theory. For scientific consensus, it is central that evidence is public and uncontroversial, like observable physical objects or events and unlike private mental states. This way it can act as a shared ground for proponents of competing theories. Two issues threatening this role are the problem of underdetermination and theory-ladenness. The problem of underdetermination concerns the fact that the available evidence often provides equal support to either theory and therefore cannot arbitrate between them. Theory-ladenness refers to the idea that evidence already includes theoretical assumptions. These assumptions can hinder it from acting as neutral arbiter. It can also lead to a lack of shared evidence if different scientists do not share these assumptions. Thomas Kuhn is an important advocate of the position that theory-ladenness concerning scientific paradigms plays a central role in science.

== Definition ==
A thing is &quot;evidence&quot; for a proposition if it epistemically supports this proposition or indicates that the supported proposition is true. Evidence is &quot;empirical&quot; if it is constituted by or accessible to sensory experience. There are various competing theories about the exact definition of the terms &quot;evidence&quot; and &quot;empirical&quot;. Different fields, like epistemology, the sciences or legal systems, often associate different concepts with these terms. An important distinction among theories of evidence is whether they identify evidence with private mental states or with public physical objects. Concerning the term &quot;empirical&quot;, there is a dispute about where to draw the line between observable or empirical objects in contrast to unobservable or merely theoretical objects.

The traditional view proposes that evidence is empirical if it is constituted by or accessible to sensory experience. This involves experiences arising from the stimulation of the sense organs, like visual or auditory experiences, but the term is often used in a wider sense including memories and introspection. It is usually seen as excluding purely intellectual experiences, like rational insights or intuitions used to justify basic logical or mathematical principles. The terms &quot;empirical&quot; and &quot;observable&quot; are closely related and sometimes used as synonyms.

There is an active debate in contemporary philosophy of science as to what should be regarded as observable or empirical in contrast to unobservable or merely theoretical objects. There is general consensus that everyday objects like books or houses are observable since they are accessible via unaided perception, but disagreement starts for objects that are only accessible through aided perception. This includes using telescopes to study distant galaxies, microscopes to study bacteria or using cloud chambers to study positrons. So the question is whether distant galaxies, bacteria or positrons should be regarded as observable or merely theoretical objects. Some even hold that any measurement process of an entity should be considered an observation of this entity. In this sense, the interior of the Sun is observable since neutrinos originating there can be detected. The difficulty with this debate is that there is a continuity of cases going from looking at something with the naked eye, through a window, through a pair of glasses, through a microscope, etc. Because of this continuity, drawing the line between any two adjacent cases seems to be arbitrary. One way to avoid these difficulties is to hold that it is a mistake to identify the empirical with what is observable or sensible. Instead, it has been suggested that empirical evidence can include unobservable entities as long as they are detectable through suitable measurements. A problem with this approach is that it is rather far from the original meaning of &quot;empirical&quot;, which contains the reference to experience.

=== Knowledge &quot;a posteriori&quot; and &quot;a priori&quot; ===

Knowledge or the justification of a belief is said to be &quot;a posteriori&quot; if it is based on empirical evidence. &quot;A posteriori&quot; refers to what depends on experience (what comes after experience), in contrast to &quot;a priori&quot;, which stands for what is independent of experience (what comes before experience). For example, the proposition that &quot;all bachelors are unmarried&quot; is knowable &quot;a priori&quot; since its truth only depends on the meanings of the words used in the expression. The proposition &quot;some bachelors are happy&quot;, on the other hand, is only knowable &quot;a posteriori&quot; since it depends on experience of the world as its justifier. Immanuel Kant held that the difference between &quot;a posteriori&quot; and &quot;a priori&quot; is tantamount to the distinction between empirical and non-empirical knowledge.

Two central questions for this distinction concern the relevant sense of &quot;experience&quot; and of &quot;dependence&quot;. The paradigmatic justification of knowledge &quot;a posteriori&quot; consists in sensory experience, but other mental phenomena, like memory or introspection, are also usually included in it. But purely intellectual experiences, like rational insights or intuitions used to justify basic logical or mathematical principles, are normally excluded from it. There are different senses in which knowledge may be said to depend on experience. In order to know a proposition, the subject has to be able to entertain this proposition, i.e. possess the relevant concepts. For example, experience is necessary to entertain the proposition &quot;if something is red all over then it is not green all over&quot; because the terms &quot;red&quot; and &quot;green&quot; have to be acquired this way. But the sense of dependence most relevant to empirical evidence concerns the status of justification of a belief. So experience may be needed to acquire the relevant concepts in the example above, but once these concepts are possessed, no further experience providing empirical evidence is needed to know that the proposition is true, which is why it is considered to be justified &quot;a priori&quot;.

=== Empiricism and rationalism ===
In its strictest sense, empiricism is the view that all knowledge is based on experience or that all epistemic justification arises from empirical evidence. This stands in contrast to the rationalist view, which holds that some knowledge is independent of experience, either because it is innate or because it is justified by reason or rational reflection alone. Expressed through the distinction between knowledge a priori and a posteriori from the previous section, rationalism affirms that there is knowledge a priori, which is denied by empiricism in this strict form. One difficulty for empiricists is to account for the justification of knowledge pertaining to fields like mathematics and logic, for example, that 3 is a prime number or that modus ponens is a valid form of deduction. The difficulty is due to the fact that there seems to be no good candidate of empirical evidence that could justify these beliefs. Such cases have prompted empiricists to allow for certain forms of knowledge a priori, for example, concerning tautologies or relations between our concepts. These concessions preserve the spirit of empiricism insofar as the restriction to experience still applies to knowledge about the external world. In some fields, like metaphysics or ethics, the choice between empiricism and rationalism makes a difference not just for how a given claim is justified but for whether it is justified at all. This is best exemplified in metaphysics, where empiricists tend to take a skeptical position, thereby denying the existence of metaphysical knowledge, while rationalists seek justification for metaphysical claims in metaphysical intuitions.

=== Scientific evidence ===

Scientific evidence is closely related to empirical evidence. Some theorists, like Carlos Santana, have argued that there is a sense in which not all empirical evidence constitutes scientific evidence. One reason for this is that the standards or criteria that scientists apply to evidence exclude certain evidence that is legitimate in other contexts. For example, anecdotal evidence from a friend about how to treat a certain disease constitutes empirical evidence that this treatment works but would not be considered scientific evidence. Others have argued that the traditional empiricist definition of empirical evidence as perceptual evidence is too narrow for much of scientific practice, which uses evidence from various kinds of non-perceptual equipment.

Central to scientific evidence is that it was arrived at by following scientific method in the context of some scientific theory. But people rely on various forms of empirical evidence in their everyday lives that have not been obtained this way and therefore do not qualify as scientific evidence. One problem with non-scientific evidence is that it is less reliable, for example, due to cognitive biases like the anchoring effect, in which information obtained earlier is given more weight, although science done poorly is also subject to such biases, as in the example of -hacking.

=== Observation, experimentation and scientific method ===
In the philosophy of science, it is sometimes held that there are two sources of empirical evidence: observation and experimentation. The idea behind this distinction is that only experimentation involves manipulation or intervention: phenomena are actively created instead of being passively observed. For example, inserting viral DNA into a bacterium is a form of experimentation while studying planetary orbits through a telescope belongs to mere observation. In these cases, the mutated DNA was actively produced by the biologist while the planetary orbits are independent of the astronomer observing them. Applied to the history of science, it is sometimes held that ancient science is mainly observational while the emphasis on experimentation is only present in modern science and responsible for the scientific revolution. This is sometimes phrased through the expression that modern science actively &quot;puts questions to nature&quot;. This distinction also underlies the categorization of sciences into experimental sciences, like physics, and observational sciences, like astronomy. While the distinction is relatively intuitive in paradigmatic cases, it has proven difficult to give a general definition of &quot;intervention&quot; applying to all cases, which is why it is sometimes outright rejected.

Empirical evidence is required for a hypothesis to gain acceptance in the scientific community. Normally, this validation is achieved by the scientific method of forming a hypothesis, experimental design, peer review, reproduction of results, conference presentation, and journal publication. This requires rigorous communication of hypothesis (usually expressed in mathematics), experimental constraints and controls (expressed in terms of standard experimental apparatus), and a common understanding of measurement. In the scientific context, the term semi-empirical is used for qualifying theoretical methods that use, in part, basic axioms or postulated scientific laws and experimental results. Such methods are opposed to theoretical &quot;ab initio&quot; methods, which are purely deductive and based on first principles. Typical examples of both &quot;ab initio&quot; and semi-empirical methods can be found in computational chemistry.

<text>The Rhodopes (; , ; , &quot;Rodopi&quot;; ) are a mountain range in Southeastern Europe, and the largest by area in Bulgaria, with over 83% of its area in the southern part of the country and the remainder in Greece. Golyam Perelik is its highest peak at . The mountain range gives its name to the terrestrial ecoregion Rodope montane mixed forests that belongs in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome and the Palearctic realm. The region is particularly notable for its karst areas with their deep river gorges, large caves and specific sculptured forms, such as the Trigrad Gorge.

A significant part of Bulgaria&#x27;s hydropower resources are located in the western areas of the range. There are a number of hydro-cascades and dams used for electricity production, irrigation, and as tourist destinations. In Greece, there are also the hydroelectric power plants of Thisavros and Platanovrysi. The Rhodopes have a rich cultural heritage including ancient Thracian sites such as Perperikon, Tatul and Belintash, and medieval castles, churches, monasteries, and picturesque villages with traditional Bulgarian architecture from the 18th and 19th centuries.

== Name and mythology==
The name of the Rhodope Mountains is of Thracian origin. Rhod-ope (Род-oпа) is interpreted as the first name of a river, meaning &quot;rusty/reddish river&quot;, where &quot;Rhod-&quot; has the same Indo-European root as the Bulgarian &quot;руда&quot; (ore, &quot;ruda&quot;), &quot;ръжда&quot; (rust, &quot;rǎžda&quot;), &quot;риж&quot; (red-haired, &quot;riž&quot;), Latin &quot;rufus&quot; (red), German &quot;rot&quot; (red), English &quot;red&quot;, Greek ροδ- (rhod).

In Greek mythology, Queen Rhodope of Thrace, the wife of King Haemus of Thrace, offended the gods, and was changed into a mountain by Zeus and Hera as a punishment along with her husband.

The mountains are also associated with the mythic figure of Orpheus.

In the Middle Ages, the mountains were known as the Slavey Mountains (Slaveyev Mountains), and under Ottoman rule were known as the Dospatsky Mountains, after the Dospat Municipality and Dospat River.

== Geography ==

In geomorphological terms, the Rhodopes are part of the Rila-Rhodope massif, which is the oldest landmass on the Balkan peninsula. The Rhodopes are spread over , of which are on Bulgarian territory. They have the greatest extent of any single mountain range in Bulgaria. The mountains are about long and about wide, with an average altitude of . To the north the mountain slopes descend steeply towards the Upper Thracian Plain. To the west, the Rhodopes reach the Avram saddle, Yundola and the valley of the Mesta River. To the south and east they extend to the coastal plains of Greek Thrace. The Rhodopes are a complex system of ridges and deep river valleys.

Fifteen reserves have been established in the region, some of which are under UNESCO protection. The mountains are famous for the largest coniferous woods in the Balkans, their mild relief and the lush vegetation in the western parts as well as the abundance of birds of prey in the eastern areas.

=== Climate ===
The location of the Rhodopes in the southeastern part of the Balkan Peninsula largely determines the climate in the region. It is influenced both by the colder air coming from the north and by the warmer breeze from the Mediterranean.

The average annual temperature in the Eastern Rhodopes is , the maximum precipitation is in December, the minimum in August. In the Western Rhodopes, the temperature varies from and in the summer rainfalls prevail.

The mild climate, combined with some other factors, works in favour of the development of recreation and tourist activities. The Pamporovo resort, where the microclimate permits a heavy snow cover to be preserved for a long time, is an excellent example.

Temperatures as low as are common in winter, and due to this the Rhodopes are the southernmost place in the Balkans where tree species such as the Norway Spruce and the Silver Birch can be found.

=== Waters ===

The mountains have abundant water reserves, with a dense network of mountain springs and rivers. Nearly 80% of the mountain&#x27;s territory falls within the drainage of the river Maritsa. The natural lakes are few, the most renown of these being the Smolyan lakes situated at several kilometers from the town of the same name. Some of the largest dams in the country are located in the Rhodopes including the Dospat Dam, Batak Dam, Golyam Beglik, Kardzhali Dam, Studen Kladenets, Vacha Dam, Shiroka Polyana and many others, while in Greece there are the dams of Thisavros and Platanovrysi. They are used mainly for hydro-electric power generation and for irrigation. There are many mineral water springs, the most famous being in Velingrad, Narechen, Devin, Beden, Mihalkovo and others. In Greece there are mineral water springs in Thermes, 40 km. north of (Xanthi) and in Thermia, 60 km. north of Drama, at 620 m.

=== Subdivision ===

==== Western Rhodopes ====
The Western Rhodopes are the largest (66% of the area of the Rhodopes in Bulgaria), higher, most infrastructurally developed, and most visited part of the mountains. The highest and best known peaks are located in the region (more than 10 are over high) including the highest one, &quot;Golyam Perelik&quot; (). Among the other popular peaks are &quot;Shirokolashki Snezhnik&quot; (), &quot;Golyam Persenk&quot; (), &quot;Batashki Snezhnik&quot; (), &quot;Turla&quot; ().

Some of the deepest river gorges in the Rhodopes are located in the western parts, as well as the rock phenomenon Wonderful Bridges. Significant bodies of water include the Chaira lakes and the Dospat, Batak, Shiroka Polyana, Golyam Beglik and Tsigov Chark dams.

The town of Batak is also located in this part of the mountains, as well as the popular tourist centres Smolyan, Velingrad, Devin, Chepelare, the winter resort Pamporovo, the Eastern Orthodox Bachkovo Monastery, the ruins of the Asen dynasty&#x27;s fortress, and the Devil&#x27;s Throat, Yagodinska, and Uhlovitsa caves. The highest village in Bulgaria, Manastir (over ), is crouched in the northern foot of Prespa Peak. A number of architectural reserves, such as Shiroka Laka, Kovachevitsa, Momchilovtsi, Kosovo, are also located in the area.

==== Eastern Rhodopes ====
The Eastern Rhodopes are spread over a territory of about 34% of the mountains&#x27; area in Bulgaria, constituting a much lower part.

The large artificial dams Kardzhali and Studen Kladenets are located in this part of the mountains. The region is rich in thermal mineral springs. The waters around Dzhebel have national reputation for healing various diseases. Belite Brezi is an important healing centre for respiratory and other ailments.

Major cities in the area are Haskovo and Kardzhali, as well as the smaller Momchilgrad, Krumovgrad, Zlatograd and Kirkovo. The Eastern Rhodopes, being significantly lower, are also more populated than the western part.

Almost every species of the European birds of prey nest in the rocks and forests of the Eastern Rhodopes including the rare black vulture and Egyptian vulture.

==== Southern (Greek) Rhodopes ====
The Southern Rhodopes are the part of the mountain range that is located in Greece. The Rhodope regional unit in the northern part of the country is named after the region. This area includes the Rodopi Mountain Range National Park.
The Southern Rhodopes are characterized by numerous peaks of relatively low altitude. Their highest peak is Delimposka (1,953m) in the mountain of Frakto, near the Greek-Bulgarian border. Nowadays the Southern Rhodopes is an area almost deserted. After World War II and the Greek Civil War most villages depopulated permanently and their inhabitants never returned. Even the Sarakatsani stockbreeders abandoned the difficult life of the Rhodopes. The depopulation of the region, that has not been grazed for more than 50 years, combined with high rainfall and its geographical location, has contributed to the creation and maintenance of a biological paradise. There grow coniferous trees, such as the Norway Spruce and the Silver Birch, that cannot be found elsewhere in Greece.

In the forest of Frakto there are 300-year-old trees, more than 50 metres high, and the endangered wild goat.

In the eastern part of the region there is the well known nature reserve of Dadia Forest, an ideal habitat for birds of prey, with 36 of the 38 species of birds of prey of Europe, like the rare Eastern imperial eagle and Lesser spotted eagle.

== History ==
The Rhodopes have been inhabited since the Prehistoric age. There have been many archaeological finds of ancient tools in some of the caves.

The first known human inhabitants in the mountains were the Thracians. They built many temples, cities and fortresses. The most famous town in the area is the sacred city of Perperikon located 15 km northeast of Kardzhali. One of the most important Thracian temples was Tatul near the village of the same name. Additionally, there are archeological sites throughout the region related to the cult of Dionysus, such as the ancient Thracian city of Perperikon.
The frequent mention of the Rhodope in Ancient Greek and Latin sources indicates that the mountain had played an important role in the political and religious life of the Thracian tribes that lived on it. On the tops of the mountain there was a famous oracle, which they had visited to consult Alexander the Great and later the father of Octavian Augustus. On the mountain were also sanctuaries of various other deities, as was Apollo, Zeus, the Thracian Horseman, Mithras, etc. Finally, Rhodope served as a true bastion of freedom of the Thracians and last refuge of resistance against the Romans. This explains the fact that Thrace became a Roman province about 200 years after Macedonia.

In 2005, German scholars from the University of Heidelberg confirmed that the two rather small fragments discovered by archaeologist Nikolay Ovcharov in the Eastern Rhodopes mountains are written in the Minoan Linear A script from about 15th century BC.

In the Middle Ages the mountain was part of the Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires and often changed hands between the two countries. There was a dense network of castles which guarded the trade routes and the strategic heights. The largest and most important castles include Lyutitsa, Ustra, Tsepina, Mezek, Asenova krepost and many others. Between 1371 and 1375 the Rhodopes fell under Ottoman occupation in the course of the Bulgarian–Ottoman wars.

During the 16th and 17th centuries the Ottoman authorities began a process of Islamisation of the region.

The towns and the villages in the Western Rhodopes took active part in the April Uprising in 1876. When the uprising was crushed the Ottomans slaughtered around 5,000 people in Batak alone. Thousands more perished in Bratsigovo, Perushtitsa and other rebel villages which were also burnt and looted by the Ottomans.

The northern Rhodopes were ceded in 1878 to an autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia until its unification with the Principality of Bulgaria. The other part of the Rhodopes was annexed as a result of the First Balkan War (1912–1913) but after the Second Balkan War (1913) and the First World War (1914–1918) the southern slopes of the mountain was occupied by Greece and the Bulgarian population of the area was forced to flee to Bulgaria.

== People ==

The sparsely populated area of the Rhodopes has been a place of ethnic and religious diversity for hundreds of years. Apart from the Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians and Greeks, the mountains are also home to a number of Muslim communities, including the Pomaks, that predominate in the western parts and a large concentration of Bulgarian Turks and Greek Turks, particularly in the Eastern Rhodopes. The mountains are also one of the regions associated with the Sarakatsani, a nomadic Greek people who traditionally roamed between Northern Thrace and the Aegean coast. Aromanians, a Romance-speaking ethnic group, also live in the Rhodopes. and Agupti who are a blend of Turks, Roma and Pomaks and don’t associate themselves with other Roma groups.

== Economy ==

The economy of the Rhodopes region is dominated by services, tourism, industry and agriculture.

Livestock breeding, forestry and tobacco are the most important agricultural activities. Due to the large Muslim population the number of pigs is relatively low but there are many sheep which are traditional for the Rhodopes. Tobacco is grown in the Eastern Rhodopes and forms a large part of the total national production.

The industrial sector is well-developed. One of the largest industries in the area is mining. There are around 80 mines for lead and zinc whose reserves are among the largest in Europe. They are situated mainly in central parts of the mountain and along the border with Greece as well as to the east. Kardzhali Province is rich in non-metalliferous minerals and gold. There are also small reserves of chromite and iron ore as well as significant impurities of rare metals in the lead and zinc ores. There are several flotation factories which enrich the ores before it is sent to the large lead and zinc refineries in Kardzhali and Plovdiv. The machine-building industry is developed in Smolyan, Kardzhali, Devin, Bratsigovo, Ivailovgrad and others; there is a pharmaceutical plant in Pestera. Some of the centers of textile industry include Zlatograd, Smolyan, Madan, Laki. The timber industry is developed mainly in the western parts where there are some of the most important forest massifs in the Balkan Peninsula. The Rhodopes are one of the main hydro-power generation regions of Bulgaria with a number of major hydroelectric power plants such as Batak, Peshtera, Aleko, Studen Kladenets, Kardzhali, Vacha and Thisavros and Platanovrysi in Greece.

Tourism is an important industry with growing significance. Pamporovo and Chepelare are major winter resorts. There are many resorts, camp sites and refuges on the shores of the dams or in the green valleys, which can be visited in the summer. The caves along the Greek border such as Yagodinska, Uhlovitsa, Devil&#x27;s Throat Cave, Snezhanka (near Peshtera) and others are popular among speleologists with their spectacular forms and underground lakes and rivers. The ruins of castles, Thracian sites such as Perperikon and Tatul, the villages in National Revival style and the monasteries are also visited by many Bulgarian and foreign tourists.

==Honour==
Rodopi Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after the Rhodope Mountains.

<text>Jeu de Paume (, &quot;Real Tennis Court&quot;) is an arts centre for modern and postmodern photography and media. It is located in the north corner (west side) of the Tuileries Gardens next to the Place de la Concorde in Paris. In 2004, Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume, Centre national de la photographie and Patrimoine Photographique merged to form the Association Jeu de Paume.

==History==
The rectangular building was constructed in 1861 at the request of Napoleon III. Napoleon III tasked Charles Delahaye to oversee the construction of the building and he commissioned Hector-Martin Lefuel as the architect. It was designed for &quot;jeu de paume&quot;, which nowadays is known as real tennis, court tennis or royal tennis, but its exterior complemented the already-existing &quot;Orangerie&quot; building. In 1877, Delahaye commissioned Virant to design a second court on the East side of the building. However, as tennis supplanted &quot;jeu de paume&quot; as a sport, the Jeu de Paume proved an inadequate space and was transformed into a gallery in 1909. 

When the Musée du Luxembourg opened its doors to foreign schools of painting at the end of the 19th century, the works it sponsored became important enough to require a separate exhibition space, and in 1909 the Jeu de Paume re-opened as a gallery with the &quot;One hundred portraits of women from the 18th-century English and French Schools&quot; exhibition. Operating first as an extension of the Louvre and Musée de l&#x27;Orangerie, it became an independent gallery from 1922, showing country and/or artist-themed expositions mostly modern foreign works. The gallery shifted towards an avant-garde style with the 1937 Exposition Internationale and an &quot;Origins and development of Independent International Art&quot; show organised by Jean Cassou, Matisse, Braque, Picasso and Léger.

===Nazi sorting house===
Jeu de Paume was used from 1940 to 1944 to store Nazi plunder looted by the regime&#x27;s Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce (ERR) in France. These works included masterpieces from the collections of French Jewish families like the Rothschilds, the David-Weills, the Bernheims, and noted dealers including Paul Rosenberg who specialised in impressionist and post-impressionist works.

Hermann Göring commanded that the loot would first be divided between Adolf Hitler and himself. For this reason, from the end of 1940 to the end of 1942 he traveled twenty times to Paris. At Jeu de Paume, art dealer Bruno Lohse staged 20 expositions of the newly looted art objects, especially for Göring, from which Göring selected at least 594 pieces for his own collection; the rest was destined for the Führermuseum in Linz.

So called &quot;degenerate art&quot; (modern art &quot;unworthy&quot; in the eyes of the Nazis) was legally banned from entering Germany, and so once designated was held in what was called the Martyr&#x27;s Room at the Jeu de Paume. Much of Paul Rosenberg&#x27;s professional dealership and personal collection were subsequently so designated by the Nazis. Following Joseph Goebbels&#x27;s earlier private decree to sell these degenerate works for foreign currency to fund the building of the Führermuseum and the wider war effort, Goering personally appointed a series of ERR-approved dealers including Hildebrand Gurlitt to liquidate these assets and then pass the funds to swell his personal art collection. With much of the looted degenerate art sold onwards via Switzerland, Rosenberg&#x27;s collection was scattered across Europe. Unsold art (including works by Picasso and Dalí) was destroyed in a bonfire on the grounds of the Jeu de Paume on the night of 27 July 1942, an act of almost unparalleled vandalism. However, the Nazis had burned nearly 4000 works of German &quot;degenerate&quot; art in Berlin in 1939.

French resistance curator Rose Valland, who was working at the museum, kept a secret list of all the works passing through, and after the Nazi defeat in 1945 most of these works were thereby returned to their rightful owners. Today, some 70 of Rosenberg&#x27;s paintings are missing, including: the large Picasso watercolor &quot;Naked Woman on the Beach&quot;, painted in Provence in 1923; seven works by Matisse; and the &quot;Portrait of Gabrielle Diot&quot; by Degas.

===Post-war museum===
Between 1947 and 1986, it contained the Musée du Jeu de Paume, an offshoot of the Louvre that held many important impressionist works now housed in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay. Widely considered as the &quot;most famous museum of impressionist painting in the world&quot;, the rooms bore names such as Salle Degas, Salle Cézanne or Salle Monet.

From 1989, as part of the Grands Projets of François Mitterrand, the building underwent a $10 million renovation by architect Antoine Stinco, resulting in about 1180 square metres (12,700 square feet) of exhibition space spread across three floors. The formerly walled-in reception hall was transformed into an atrium-like open area flooded with natural light from large bay windows, allowing views of the neighboring Tuileries Gardens, Place de la Concorde, and Eiffel Tower. The top floor features a series of galleries lit by skylights.

==Present==
In 1991, the Jeu de Paume reopened as &quot;France&#x27;s first national gallery of contemporary art&quot;, with an exhibition devoted to Jean Dubuffet. Subsequent retrospectives were dedicated to international artists such as Marcel Broodthaers (1991), Robert Gober (1991), Ellsworth Kelly (1992), Helio Oiticica (1992), and Eva Hesse (1993). In 1999, the museum chose American architect Richard Meier as the subject of its first-ever architectural exhibition.

In 2004, Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume, Centre National de la Photographie and Patrimoine Photographique merged to form the Association de Préfiguration for the Etablissement Public (EPIC) Jeu de Paume. It has since developed into a centre for modern and postmodern photography and media, mounting survey exhibitions on Ed Ruscha (2006), Cindy Sherman (2006), Martin Parr (2009), William Kentridge (2010), Claude Cahun (2011), Lorna Simpson (2013), Valérie Jouve (2015) among others. In 2016, it received the anthological solo exhibition of contemporary photograph Helena Almeida.

On 27 April 2005, a plaque honoring the work of Rose Valland to catalogue looted art during the Nazi occupation was placed on the south wall of the Jeu de Paume.

On 1 December 2018 the museum was torched in politically related mob violence as the Tuileries Gardens were stormed by protestors.

Today, the Jeu de Paume is subsidised by the French Ministry of Culture and Communication. Attendance increased from 200,000 visitors in 2006 to over 320,000 visitors in 2008.

==In popular culture==
The museum&#x27;s wartime history has been depicted, heavily fictionalized, several times on film. In John Frankenheimer&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;The Train&quot;, starring Burt Lancaster and Jeanne Moreau, Rose Valland is represented as Mademoiselle Villard, played by Suzanne Flon. In George Clooney&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;The Monuments Men&quot;, Valland is represented as Claire Simone, played by Cate Blanchett. In Anatole Litvak&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;The Night of the Generals&quot;, Peter O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s character General Tanz visits the museum and is transfixed by a self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh, referenced as &quot;Vincent In Flames&quot;.

In Sara Houghteling&#x27;s novel &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; (2009), the character of Rose Clément is based on Rose Valland. In Ruth Reichl&#x27;s novel &quot;The Paris Novel&quot; (2024), Rose Valland&#x27;s war efforts are mentioned several times.

== Architecture ==
The Jeu de Paume was designed by architect Melchior Viraut in the Second Empire style and has many classical architectural features, such as semi-fluted ionic columns and a decorative tympanum with Napoleon&#x27;s coat of arms. Unique to the Jeu De Paume is the letter &quot;N&quot; above the entrance of the building. Along the sides of the building are large arched windows to allow for light to enter the court areas.

The interior was completely renovated in 1989 by Antoine Stinco to make the space more suited to exhibiting art. Stinco said his goal was to create a space that would not compete with the artwork, but that would allow at least a glimpse of the views of the gardens and beyond.

<text>Two&#x27;s complement is the most common method of representing signed (positive, negative, and zero) integers on computers, and more generally, fixed point binary values. Two&#x27;s complement uses the binary digit with the &quot;greatest&quot; value as the &quot;sign&quot; to indicate whether the binary number is positive or negative; when the most significant bit is &quot;1&quot; the number is signed as negative and when the most significant bit is &quot;0&quot; the number is signed as positive. As a result, non-negative numbers are represented as themselves: 6 is 0110, zero is 0000, and −6 is 1010 (NOT 6 + 1). Note that while the number of binary bits is fixed throughout a computation it is otherwise arbitrary. 

Unlike the ones&#x27; complement scheme, the two&#x27;s complement scheme has only one representation for zero. Furthermore, arithmetic implementations can be used on signed as well as unsigned integers
and differ only in the integer overflow situations.

== Procedure ==
The following is the procedure for obtaining the two&#x27;s complement representation of a given &quot;negative&quot; number in binary digits:

* Step 1: starting with the absolute binary representation of the number, with the leading bit being a sign bit;
* Step 2: inverting (or flipping) all bits – changing every 0 to 1, and every 1 to 0;
* Step 3: adding 1 to the entire inverted number, ignoring any overflow. Accounting for overflow will produce the wrong value for the result.

For example, to calculate the decimal number −6 in binary from the number 6:

* Step 1: &quot;+6&quot; in decimal is &quot;0110&quot; in binary; the leftmost significant bit (the first 0) is the sign (just 110 in binary would be −2 in decimal). 
* Step 2: flip all bits in &quot;0110&quot;, giving &quot;1001&quot;. 
* Step 3: add the place value 1 to the flipped number &quot;1001&quot;, giving &quot;1010&quot;.

To verify that &quot;1010&quot; indeed has a value of &quot;−6&quot;, add the place values together, but &quot;subtract&quot; the sign value from the final calculation. Because the most significant value is the sign value, it must be subtracted to produce the correct result: 1010 = −(1×23) + (0×22) + (1×21) + (0×20) = 1×−8 + 0 + 1×2 + 0 = −6. 
Note that steps 2 and 3 together are a valid method to compute the additive inverse formula_1 of any (positive or negative) integer formula_2 where both input and output are in two&#x27;s complement format. An alternative to compute formula_1 is to use subtraction formula_4. See below for subtraction of integers in two&#x27;s complement format.

==Theory==
Two&#x27;s complement is an example of a radix complement. The &#x27;two&#x27; in the name refers to the number - &quot;two to the power of N&quot;, which is the value in respect to which the complement is calculated in an -bit system (the only case where exactly &#x27;two&#x27; would be produced in this term is , so for a 1-bit system, but these do not have capacity for both a sign and a zero). As such, the precise definition of the &quot;two&#x27;s complement&quot; of an -bit number is the complement of that number with respect to .

The defining property of being a &quot;complement to a number with respect to &quot; is simply that the summation of this number with the original produce . For example, using binary with numbers up to three bits (so and , where &#x27;2&#x27; indicates a binary representation), a two&#x27;s complement for the number 3 () is 5 (), because summed to the original it gives . Where this correspondence is employed for representing negative numbers, it effectively means, using an analogy with decimal digits and a number-space only allowing eight non-negative numbers 0 through 7, dividing the number-space into two sets: the first four of the numbers 0 1 2 3 remain the same, while the remaining four encode negative numbers, maintaining their growing order, so making 4 encode −4, 5 encode −3, 6 encode −2 and 7 encode −1. A binary representation has an additional utility however, because the most significant bit also indicates the group (and the sign): it is 0 for the first group of non-negatives, and 1 for the second group of negatives. The tables at right illustrate this property.
Calculation of the binary two&#x27;s complement of a positive number essentially means subtracting the number from the . But as can be seen for the three-bit example and the four-bit (), the number will not itself be representable in a system limited to bits, as it is just outside the bits space (the number is nevertheless the reference point of the &quot;Two&#x27;s complement&quot; in an -bit system). Because of this, systems with maximally -bits must break the subtraction into two operations: first subtract from the maximum number in the -bit system, that is (this term in binary is actually a simple number consisting of &#x27;all 1s&#x27;, and a subtraction from it can be done simply by inverting all bits in the number also known as the bitwise NOT operation) and then adding the one. Coincidentally, that intermediate number before adding the one is also used in computer science as another method of signed number representation and is called a ones&#x27; complement (named that because summing such a number with the original gives the &#x27;all 1s&#x27;).

Compared to other systems for representing signed numbers (e.g., ones&#x27; complement), the two&#x27;s complement has the advantage that the fundamental arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication are identical to those for unsigned binary numbers (as long as the inputs are represented in the same number of bits as the output, and any overflow beyond those bits is discarded from the result). This property makes the system simpler to implement, especially for higher-precision arithmetic. Additionally, unlike ones&#x27; complement systems, two&#x27;s complement has no representation for negative zero, and thus does not suffer from its associated difficulties. Otherwise, both schemes have the desired property that the sign of integers can be reversed by taking the complement of its binary representation, but two&#x27;s complement has an exception – the lowest negative, as can be seen in the tables.

==History==
The method of complements had long been used to perform subtraction in decimal adding machines and mechanical calculators. John von Neumann suggested use of two&#x27;s complement binary representation in his 1945 &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot; proposal for an electronic stored-program digital computer. The 1949 EDSAC, which was inspired by the &quot;First Draft&quot;, used two&#x27;s complement representation of negative binary integers.

Many early computers, including the CDC 6600, the LINC, the PDP-1, and the UNIVAC 1107, use ones&#x27; complement notation; the descendants of the UNIVAC 1107, the UNIVAC 1100/2200 series, continued to do so. The IBM 700/7000 series scientific machines use sign/magnitude notation, except for the index registers which are two&#x27;s complement. Early commercial computers storing negative values in two&#x27;s complement form include the English Electric DEUCE (1955) and the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-5 (1963) and PDP-6 (1964). The System/360, introduced in 1964 by IBM, then the dominant player in the computer industry, made two&#x27;s complement the most widely used binary representation in the computer industry. The first minicomputer, the PDP-8 introduced in 1965, uses two&#x27;s complement arithmetic, as do the 1969 Data General Nova, the 1970 PDP-11, and almost all subsequent minicomputers and microcomputers.

==Converting from two&#x27;s complement representation==
A two&#x27;s-complement number system encodes positive and negative numbers in a binary number representation. The weight of each bit is a power of two, except for the most significant bit, whose weight is the negative of the corresponding power of two.

The value  of an -bit integer formula_5 is given by the following formula:

formula_6

The most significant bit determines the sign of the number and is sometimes called the sign bit. Unlike in sign-and-magnitude representation, the sign bit also has the weight shown above. Using bits, all integers from to can be represented.

==Converting to two&#x27;s complement representation==

In two&#x27;s complement notation, a &quot;non-negative&quot; number is represented by its ordinary binary representation; in this case, the most significant bit is 0. Though, the range of numbers represented is not the same as with unsigned binary numbers. For example, an 8-bit unsigned number can represent the values 0 to 255 (11111111). However a two&#x27;s complement 8-bit number can only represent non-negative integers from 0 to 127 (01111111), because the rest of the bit combinations with the most significant bit as &#x27;1&#x27; represent the negative integers −1 to −128.

The two&#x27;s complement operation is the additive inverse operation, so negative numbers are represented by the two&#x27;s complement of the absolute value.

===From the ones&#x27; complement===
To get the two&#x27;s complement of a negative binary number, all bits are inverted, or &quot;flipped&quot;, by using the bitwise NOT operation; the value of 1 is then added to the resulting value, ignoring the overflow which occurs when taking the two&#x27;s complement of 0.

For example, using 1 byte (=8 bits), the decimal number 5 is represented by

The most significant bit (the leftmost bit in this case) is 0, so the pattern represents a non-negative value. To convert to −5 in two&#x27;s-complement notation, first, all bits are inverted, that is: 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0:

At this point, the representation is the ones&#x27; complement of the decimal value −5. To obtain the two&#x27;s complement, 1 is added to the result, giving:

The result is a signed binary number representing the decimal value −5 in two&#x27;s-complement form. The most significant bit is 1, signifying that the value represented is negative.

Alternatively, instead of adding 1 after inverting a positive binary number, 1 can be subtracted from the number &quot;before&quot; it is inverted. The two methods can easily be shown to be equivalent. The inversion (ones&#x27; complement) of formula_7 equals formula_8, so the sum of the inversion and 1 equals formula_9formula_10formula_11, which equals the two&#x27;s complement of formula_7 as expected. The inversion of formula_13 equals formula_14formula_9formula_11, identical to the previous equation. Essentially, the subtraction inherent in the inversion operation changes the -1 added to formula_7 before the inversion into +1 added after the inversion. This alternate subtract-and-invert algorithm to form a two&#x27;s complement can sometimes be advantageous in computer programming or hardware design, for example where the subtraction of 1 can be obtained for free by incorporating it into an earlier operation.

The two&#x27;s complement of a negative number is the corresponding positive value, except in the special case of the most negative number. For example, inverting the bits of −5 (above) gives:

And adding one gives the final value:

The two&#x27;s complement of the most negative number representable (e.g. a one as the most-significant bit and all other bits zero) is itself. Hence, there is an &#x27;extra&#x27; negative number for which two&#x27;s complement does not give the negation, see below.

The case for the most negative number is one of only two special cases. The other special case is for zero, the two&#x27;s complement of which is zero: inverting gives all ones, and adding one changes the ones back to zeros (since the overflow is ignored). Mathematically, in the two&#x27;s complement system of signed integers (which represents the negative of each number as its two&#x27;s complement), this is obviously correct: the negative of 0 is in fact 0 (formula_18). This zero case also makes sense by the definition of two&#x27;s complements: by that definition, the two&#x27;s complement of zero would be formula_19, but in formula_20 bits, all values are taken modulo formula_21, and formula_21formula_23. In other words, the two&#x27;s complement of 0 in formula_20 bits is (by definition) a single 1 bit followed by formula_20 zeros, but the 1 gets truncated, leaving 0.

In summary, the two&#x27;s complement of any number, either positive, negative, or zero, can be computed in the same ways. In two&#x27;s complement signed integer representation, the two&#x27;s complement of any integer is equal to -1 times that integer, except for the most negative integer representable in the given number of bits formula_20, i.e. the integer formula_27, the two&#x27;s complement of which is itself (still negative).

===Subtraction from 2&quot;N&quot;===

The sum of a number and its ones&#x27; complement is an -bit word with all 1 bits, which is (reading as an unsigned binary number) . Then adding a number to its two&#x27;s complement results in the lowest bits set to 0 and the carry bit 1, where the latter has the weight (reading it as an unsigned binary number) of . Hence, in the unsigned binary arithmetic the value of two&#x27;s-complement negative number of a positive satisfies the equality .

For example, to find the four-bit representation of −5 (subscripts denote the base of the representation):

Hence, with :

The calculation can be done entirely in base 10, converting to base 2 at the end:
===Working from LSB towards MSB===
A shortcut to manually convert a binary number into its two&#x27;s complement is to start at the least significant bit (LSB), and copy all the zeros, working from LSB toward the most significant bit (MSB) until the first 1 is reached; then copy that 1, and flip all the remaining bits (Leave the MSB as a 1 if the initial number was in sign-and-magnitude representation). This shortcut allows a person to convert a number to its two&#x27;s complement without first forming its ones&#x27; complement. For example: in two&#x27;s complement representation, the negation of &quot;0011 1100&quot; is &quot;1100 0100&quot;, where the underlined digits were unchanged by the copying operation (while the rest of the digits were flipped).

In computer circuitry, this method is no faster than the &quot;complement and add one&quot; method; both methods require working sequentially from right to left, propagating logic changes. The method of complementing and adding one can be sped up by a standard carry look-ahead adder circuit; the LSB towards MSB method can be sped up by a similar logic transformation.

==Sign extension==


When turning a two&#x27;s-complement number with a certain number of bits into one with more bits (e.g., when copying from a one-byte variable to a two-byte variable), the most-significant bit must be repeated in all the extra bits. Some processors do this in a single instruction; on other processors, a conditional must be used followed by code to set the relevant bits or bytes.

Similarly, when a number is shifted to the right, the most-significant bit, which contains the sign information, must be maintained. However, when shifted to the left, a bit is shifted out. These rules preserve the common semantics that left shifts multiply the number by two and right shifts divide the number by two. However, if the most-significant bit changes from 0 to 1 (and vice versa), overflow is said to occur in the case that the value represents a signed integer.

Both shifting and doubling the precision are important for some multiplication algorithms. Note that unlike addition and subtraction, width extension and right shifting are done differently for signed and unsigned numbers.

==Most negative number==
With only one exception, starting with any number in two&#x27;s-complement representation, if all the bits are flipped and 1 added, the two&#x27;s-complement representation of the negative of that number is obtained. Positive 12 becomes negative 12, positive 5 becomes negative 5, zero becomes zero(+overflow), etc.

Taking the two&#x27;s complement (negation) of the minimum number in the range will not have the desired effect of negating the number. For example, the two&#x27;s complement of in an eight-bit system is as shown in the table to the right. Although the expected result from negating is there is no representation of with an eight bit two&#x27;s complement system and thus it is in fact impossible to represent the negation. Note that the two&#x27;s complement being the same number is detected as an overflow condition since there was a carry into but not out of the most-significant bit.

Having a nonzero number equal to its own negation is forced by the fact that zero is its own negation, and that the total number of numbers is even. Proof: there are nonzero numbers (an odd number). Negation would partition the nonzero numbers into sets of size 2, but this would result in the set of nonzero numbers having even cardinality. So at least one of the sets has size 1, i.e., a nonzero number is its own negation.

The presence of the most negative number can lead to unexpected programming bugs where the result has an unexpected sign, or leads to an unexpected overflow exception, or leads to completely strange behaviors. For example,
* the unary negation operator may not change the sign of a nonzero number. e.g., (where &quot;&quot; is read as &quot;becomes&quot;).
* an implementation of absolute value may return a negative number; e.g., 

* Likewise, multiplication by may fail to function as expected; e.g.,   
* Division by may cause an exception (like that caused by dividing by ); even calculating the remainder (or modulo) by can trigger this exception; e.g.,   

In the C and C++ programming languages, the above behaviours are undefined and not only may they return strange results, but the compiler is free to assume that the programmer has ensured that undefined numerical operations never happen, and make inferences from that assumption. This enables a number of optimizations, but also leads to a number of strange bugs in programs with these undefined calculations.

This most negative number in two&#x27;s complement is sometimes called &quot;the weird number&quot;, because it is the only exception.
Although the number is an exception, it is a valid number in regular two&#x27;s complement systems. All arithmetic operations work with it both as an operand and (unless there was an overflow) a result.

==Why it works==
Given a set of all possible -bit values, we can assign the lower (by the binary value) half to be the integers from 0 to inclusive and the upper half to be to −1 inclusive. The upper half (again, by the binary value) can be used to represent negative integers from to −1 because, under addition modulo they behave the same way as those negative integers. That is to say that, because , any value in the set can be used in place of .

For example, with eight bits, the unsigned bytes are 0 to 255. Subtracting 256 from the top half (128 to 255) yields the signed bytes −128 to −1.

The relationship to two&#x27;s complement is realised by noting that , and is the ones&#x27; complement of .

===Example===

For example, an 8 bit number can only represent every integer from −128. to 127., inclusive, since . is equivalent to 161. since



Fundamentally, the system represents negative integers by counting backward and wrapping around. The boundary between positive and negative numbers is arbitrary, but by convention all negative numbers have a left-most bit (most significant bit) of one. Therefore, the most positive four-bit number is 0111 (7.) and the most negative is 1000 (−8.). Because of the use of the left-most bit as the sign bit, the absolute value of the most negative number (|−8.| = 8.) is too large to represent. Negating a two&#x27;s complement number is simple: Invert all the bits and add one to the result. For example, negating 1111, we get . Therefore, 1111 in binary must represent −1 in decimal.

The system is useful in simplifying the implementation of arithmetic on computer hardware. Adding 0011 (3.) to 1111 (−1.) at first seems to give the incorrect answer of 10010. However, the hardware can simply ignore the left-most bit to give the correct answer of 0010 (2.). Overflow checks still must exist to catch operations such as summing 0100 and 0100.

The system therefore allows addition of negative operands without a subtraction circuit or a circuit that detects the sign of a number. Moreover, that addition circuit can also perform subtraction by taking the two&#x27;s complement of a number (see below), which only requires an additional cycle or its own adder circuit. To perform this, the circuit merely operates as if there were an extra left-most bit of 1.

==Arithmetic operations==

===Addition===
Adding two&#x27;s complement numbers requires no special processing even if the operands have opposite signs; the sign of the result is determined automatically. For example, adding 15 and −5:
Or the computation of 5 − 15 = 5 + (−15):

This process depends upon restricting to 8 bits of precision; a carry to the (nonexistent) 9th most significant bit is ignored, resulting in the arithmetically correct result of 1010.

The last two bits of the carry row (reading right-to-left) contain vital information: whether the calculation resulted in an arithmetic overflow, a number too large for the binary system to represent (in this case greater than 8 bits). An overflow condition exists when these last two bits are different from one another. As mentioned above, the sign of the number is encoded in the MSB of the result.

In other terms, if the left two carry bits (the ones on the far left of the top row in these examples) are both 1s or both 0s, the result is valid; if the left two carry bits are &quot;1 0&quot; or &quot;0 1&quot;, a sign overflow has occurred. Conveniently, an XOR operation on these two bits can quickly determine if an overflow condition exists. As an example, consider the signed 4-bit addition of 7 and 3:

In this case, the far left two (MSB) carry bits are &quot;01&quot;, which means there was a two&#x27;s-complement addition overflow. That is, 10102 = 1010 is outside the permitted range of −8 to 7. The result would be correct if treated as unsigned integer.

In general, any two -bit numbers may be added &quot;without&quot; overflow, by first sign-extending both of them to bits, and then adding as above. The bits result is large enough to represent any possible sum ( two&#x27;s complement can represent values in the range −16 to 15) so overflow will never occur. It is then possible, if desired, to &#x27;truncate&#x27; the result back to bits while preserving the value if and only if the discarded bit is a proper sign extension of the retained result bits. This provides another method of detecting overflow – which is equivalent to the method of comparing the carry bits – but which may be easier to implement in some situations, because it does not require access to the internals of the addition.

===Subtraction===
Computers usually use the method of complements to implement subtraction. Using complements for subtraction is closely related to using complements for representing negative numbers, since the combination allows all signs of operands and results; direct subtraction works with two&#x27;s-complement numbers as well. Like addition, the advantage of using two&#x27;s complement is the elimination of examining the signs of the operands to determine whether addition or subtraction is needed. For example, subtracting −5 from 15 is really adding 5 to 15, but this is hidden by the two&#x27;s-complement representation:

Overflow is detected the same way as for addition, by examining the two leftmost (most significant) bits of the borrows; overflow has occurred if they are different.

Another example is a subtraction operation where the result is negative: 15 − 35 = −20:

As for addition, overflow in subtraction may be avoided (or detected after the operation) by first sign-extending both inputs by an extra bit.

===Multiplication===
The product of two -bit numbers requires bits to contain all possible values.

If the precision of the two operands using two&#x27;s complement is doubled before the multiplication, direct multiplication (discarding any excess bits beyond that precision) will provide the correct result. For example, take . First, the precision is extended from four bits to eight. Then the numbers are multiplied, discarding the bits beyond the eighth bit (as shown by &quot;&quot;):

This is very inefficient; by doubling the precision ahead of time, all additions must be double-precision and at least twice as many partial products are needed than for the more efficient algorithms actually implemented in computers. Some multiplication algorithms are designed for two&#x27;s complement, notably Booth&#x27;s multiplication algorithm. Methods for multiplying sign-magnitude numbers do not work with two&#x27;s-complement numbers without adaptation. There is not usually a problem when the multiplicand (the one being repeatedly added to form the product) is negative; the issue is setting the initial bits of the product correctly when the multiplier is negative. Two methods for adapting algorithms to handle two&#x27;s-complement numbers are common:

* First check to see if the multiplier is negative. If so, negate (i.e., take the two&#x27;s complement of) both operands before multiplying. The multiplier will then be positive so the algorithm will work. Because both operands are negated, the result will still have the correct sign.
* Subtract the partial product resulting from the MSB (pseudo sign bit) instead of adding it like the other partial products. This method requires the multiplicand&#x27;s sign bit to be extended by one position, being preserved during the shift right actions.

As an example of the second method, take the common add-and-shift algorithm for multiplication. Instead of shifting partial products to the left as is done with pencil and paper, the accumulated product is shifted right, into a second register that will eventually hold the least significant half of the product. Since the least significant bits are not changed once they are calculated, the additions can be single precision, accumulating in the register that will eventually hold the most significant half of the product. In the following example, again multiplying 6 by −5, the two registers and the extended sign bit are separated by &quot;|&quot;:
===Comparison (ordering)===
Comparison is often implemented with a dummy subtraction, where the flags in the computer&#x27;s status register are checked, but the main result is ignored. The zero flag indicates if two values compared equal. If the exclusive-or of the sign and overflow flags is 1, the subtraction result was less than zero, otherwise the result was zero or greater. These checks are often implemented in computers in conditional branch instructions.

Unsigned binary numbers can be ordered by a simple lexicographic ordering, where the bit value 0 is defined as less than the bit value 1. For two&#x27;s complement values, the meaning of the most significant bit is reversed (i.e. 1 is less than 0).

The following algorithm (for an -bit two&#x27;s complement architecture) sets the result register R to −1 if A &lt; B, to +1 if A &gt; B, and to 0 if A and B are equal:
// reversed comparison of the sign bit

if A(n-1) = 0 and B(n-1) = 1 then
 return +1;
else if A(n-1) = 1 and B(n-1) = 0 then
 return -1
end;
// comparison of remaining bits

for i := n-2 downto 0 do begin
 if A(i) = 0 and B(i) = 1 then
 return -1
 else if A(i) = 1 and B(i) = 0 then
 return +1 
 end
end
return 0
==Two&#x27;s complement and numbers==
In a classic &quot;HAKMEM&quot; published by the MIT AI Lab in 1972, Bill Gosper noted that whether or not a machine&#x27;s internal representation was two&#x27;s-complement could be determined by summing the successive powers of two. In a flight of fancy, he noted that the result of doing this algebraically indicated that &quot;algebra is run on a machine (the universe) which is two&#x27;s-complement.&quot;

Gosper&#x27;s end conclusion is not necessarily meant to be taken seriously, and it is akin to a mathematical joke. The critical step is &quot;...110 = ...111 − 1&quot;, i.e., &quot;2&quot;X&quot; = &quot;X&quot; − 1&quot;, and thus &quot;X&quot; = ...111 = −1. This presupposes a method by which an infinite string of 1s is considered a number, which requires an extension of the finite place-value concepts in elementary arithmetic. It is meaningful either as part of a two&#x27;s-complement notation for all integers, as a typical 2-adic number, or even as one of the generalized sums defined for the divergent series of real numbers 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ⋯. Digital arithmetic circuits, idealized to operate with infinite (extending to positive powers of 2) bit strings, produce 2-adic addition and multiplication compatible with two&#x27;s complement representation. Continuity of binary arithmetical and bitwise operations in 2-adic metric also has some use in cryptography.

== Fraction conversion ==
To convert a number with a fractional part, such as .0101, one must convert starting from right to left the 1s to decimal as in a normal conversion. In this example 0101 is equal to 5 in decimal. Each digit after the floating point represents a fraction where the denominator is a multiplier of 2. So, the first is 1/2, the second is 1/4 and so on. Having already calculated the decimal value as mentioned above, only the denominator of the LSB (LSB = starting from right) is used. The final result of this conversion is 5/16.

For instance, having the floating value of .0110 for this method to work, one should not consider the last 0 from the right. Hence, instead of calculating the decimal value for 0110, we calculate the value 011, which is 3 in decimal (by leaving the 0 in the end, the result would have been 6, together with the denominator 24 = 16, which reduces to 3/8). The denominator is 8, giving a final result of 3/8.

<text>The purple sandpiper (Calidris maritima) is a small shorebird in the sandpiper family Scolopacidae. This is a hardy sandpiper that breeds in the arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia and North America and winters further south on the Atlantic coast.

==Taxonomy==
The purple sandpiper was formally described in 1764 by the Danish zoologist Morten Thrane Brünnich and given the binomial name &quot;Tringa maratina&quot;. This species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Erolia&quot;, but is now placed with 23 other sandpipers in the genus &quot;Calidris&quot; that was introduced in 1804 by the German naturalist Blasius Merrem. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific epithet &quot;maritima&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;of the sea&quot;, from &quot;mare&quot;, &quot;sea&quot;. The purple sandpiper is treated as monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. Within the genus &quot;Calidris&quot; the purple sandpiper is sister to the rock sandpiper (&quot;Calidris ptilocnemis&quot;) and is closely related to the sanderling (&quot;Calidris alba&quot;) and the dunlin (&quot;Calidris alpina&quot;).

==Description==
Adults have short yellow legs and a medium thin dark bill with a yellow base. The body is dark on top with a slight purplish gloss and mainly white underneath. The breast is smeared with grey and the rump is black. They measure in length and across the wings, and weight is from .

==Distribution and habitat==
The purple sandpiper&#x27;s breeding range extends from the arctic islands of northern Canada, eastwards to Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard and northern Scandinavia across to Western Siberia and the Taymyr Peninsula. In the high arctic the sandpiper breeds at low altitude on the tundra, sometimes far from the coastline, but in the subarctic regions of Sweden and Norway it breeds on barren mountain sides near the limit of the frozen ground. Birds breeding at high latitudes migrate south and spend the winter on rocky shores on both sides of the north Atlantic. They winter along the North America coast as far south as South Carolina and on the eastern Atlantic coast as far south as France and northern Iberia.

Birds wintering in northern Scotland and southwest Ireland migrate to Canada (Baffin Island and Devon Island) to breed.

In Britain, these birds occur in winter in good numbers principally along the east and south coasts, where they favour rocky shorelines adjacent to the sea. It is much rarer as a breeding bird, found only in a localised area of the Cairngorms National Park, where 1–3 pairs have bred since 1978. Records of breeding by this species in the UK are monitored and archived by the Rare Breeding Birds Panel.

They are late migrants and move to rocky, ice-free Atlantic coasts in winter. Most go no further south than North Carolina and northern Portugal. They are fairly gregarious, forming small flocks, often with ruddy turnstones. This species is tame and approachable.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===

Their breeding habitat is the northern tundra on Arctic islands in Canada and coastal areas in Greenland and northwestern Europe. They can breed at one year of age. The male makes several scrapes on the ground; the female chooses one and lays 3 or 4 eggs. These are olive with brown blotches and are approximately in size. The male takes the major responsibility for incubation of the eggs which hatch in 21–22 days. The chicks are covered with dense down. The upperparts have black and cinnamon patches with white specks; the underparts are mainly white. Usually only the male tends the chicks which can feed themselves. The maximum age recorded from ring-recovery data in Europe is 20 years and 9 months for a bird recovered in Sweden.

An apparent case of hybridization between this species and the dunlin has been reported from England.

===Feeding===
These birds forage on rocky coasts, picking up food by sight. They mainly eat arthropods and molluscs, mainly littorinids and mussels, also some plant material. One of the main staples are seaweed flies of the &quot;Coelopa&quot; genera (&quot;C. frigida&quot;).

==Status==
The purple sandpiper has an extremely large range and although the population appears to be decreasing, the population is very large. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has judged that the threat to the species is of &quot;Least concern&quot;. The purple sandpiper is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>The Bank of Greece ( , ) is the Greek member of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for Greece from 1927 to 2000, issuing the drachma. Since 2014, it has also been Greece&#x27;s national competent authority within European Banking Supervision. 

Unlike most contemporary central banks, the Bank of Greece still has private shareholders and its stock is listed on the Athens Exchange.

==History==

The Bank of Greece was established by Law 3424/7 December 1927, under the conditions of the stabilization loan coordinated by the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations, and its operations started officially in 1928. The shares of the Bank of Greece are registered and have been listed on the Athens Exchange since June 12, 1930.

During the Axis occupation of Greece (1941–44), Governor Kyriakos Varvaresos and Deputy Governor Georgios Mantzavinos followed the Greek government in exile to London. The collaborationist governments in Greece fired Varvaresos and Mantzavinos in 1941 and appointed first Miltiadis Negrepontis as Governing Counsellor (April 24, 1941 – July 3, 1941), then Dimitrios Santis as Governor (July 3, 1941 – January 20, 1943) and Andreas Papadimitriou as Deputy Governor (July 3, 1941 – November 18, 1941), and finally Theodoros Tourkovasilis as Governor (April 19, 1943 – April 13, 1944) and Spyridon Hatzikyriakos as Deputy Governor (April 5, 1943 – October 5, 1944). After the liberation, all dismissals and appointments by occupation-era governments concerning members of the administration of the Bank of Greece were declared null and void.

Until January 2001 (when Greece adopted the euro) the bank was responsible for the former national currency, the drachma. Greece had failed to meet the membership criteria and was excluded from participating when the euro was launched on 1 January 1999. Use of physical drachma notes and coins continued until 31 December 2001, as denominations of the euro.

==Operations==

The bank has a staff of more than 1,800 employees. Its primary objective is to ensure price stability in Greece. It also supervises the private banks and acts as a treasurer and fiscal agent for the Greek government. Since law 3867/2010 was passed the Bank of Greece is also responsible for supervising private insurance companies, merging with the Committee for the Supervision of Insurance Companies established by law 3229/2004.

Its Euro banknotes printer identification code is Y. The Bank of Greece also sells gold sovereigns.

==Legal status and ownership==

The Bank of Greece is a joint-stock company with special privileges, special restrictions, and duties. It is prohibited from operating as a commercial bank. 

The percentage of shares under Greek state ownership cannot exceed 35 percent (initially this limit was 10 percent). As of early 2024, the government share was slightly over 21 percent, of which 8.9 percent directly held by the Greek state and 12.4 percent through the . The rest of the bank&#x27;s equity was widely dispersed, with no single shareholder known to hold more than 1 percent. 

==Leadership==
===Governors===

The chief officer of the Bank of Greece is the Governor (, ), a governmental appointee.

===Deputy governors===

The Deputy Governor () is the Bank&#x27;s second-in-line officer. Traditionally the Deputy Governors&#x27; main remit is administration, whereas Governors supervise monetary policy at large.

==Buildings==

The Bank of Greece&#x27;s central building on Panepistimiou Street was designed in 1933 by a team of architects led by Nikolaos Zoumpoulidis, Kimon Laskaris, and Konstantinos Papadakis and inaugurated in 1938. It was extended in the 1970s to occupy the entire block.

The building in Thessaloniki, on the northern corner of Eleftherias Square, was designed in 1925 by Aristomenis Valvis and N. Mitsakis for the National Bank of Greece. With the Bank of Greece being established in the course of its construction, it was remodeled to accommodate both institutions and completed in 1933. Since then, it has been continuously shared by the two, with respective entrances on opposite ends of the building. 

The bank also erected branch buildings in a number of other Greek cities, aimed at providing services but also to project a sense of stability following the turmoil of the European banking crisis of 1931. For that, it adopted a generally neoclassical design style in the 1930s for the branches in Chania, Larissa, Mytilene, Samos, Serres, Tripoli and Volos, some of which were only completed after World War II. The Bank of Greece later completed new branch buildings in Heraklion, Ioannina and Komotini in the 1968s, Alexandroupolis in 2000, and Patras in 2001. In Kalamata, Kavala and Lamia, it purchased pre-existing buildings. The branch building in Rhodes was designed in Rome for the Bank of Italy under Italian rule of the Dodecanese, taken over by the Greek government in 1945, and transferred to the Bank of Greece in 1952.

<text>The primitive equations are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations that are used to approximate global atmospheric flow and are used in most atmospheric models. They consist of three main sets of balance equations:

# A &quot;continuity equation&quot;: Representing the conservation of mass.
# &quot;Conservation of momentum&quot;: Consisting of a form of the Navier–Stokes equations that describe hydrodynamical flow on the surface of a sphere under the assumption that vertical motion is much smaller than horizontal motion (hydrostasis) and that the fluid layer depth is small compared to the radius of the sphere
# A &quot;thermal energy equation&quot;: Relating the overall temperature of the system to heat sources and sinks

The primitive equations may be linearized to yield Laplace&#x27;s tidal equations, an eigenvalue problem from which the analytical solution to the latitudinal structure of the flow may be determined.

In general, nearly all forms of the primitive equations relate the five variables &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, ω, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, and their evolution over space and time.

The equations were first written down by Vilhelm Bjerknes.

== Definitions ==

*formula_1 is the zonal velocity (velocity in the east–west direction tangent to the sphere)
*formula_2 is the meridional velocity (velocity in the north–south direction tangent to the sphere)
*formula_3 is the vertical velocity in isobaric coordinates
*formula_4 is the temperature
*formula_5 is the geopotential
*formula_6 is the term corresponding to the Coriolis force, and is equal to formula_7, where formula_8 is the angular rotation rate of the Earth (formula_9 radians per sidereal hour), and formula_10 is the latitude
*formula_11 is the gas constant
*formula_12 is the pressure
*formula_13 is the density
*formula_14 is the specific heat on a constant pressure surface
*formula_15 is the heat flow per unit time per unit mass
*formula_16 is the precipitable water

==Forces that cause atmospheric motion==
Forces that cause atmospheric motion include the pressure gradient force, gravity, and viscous friction. Together, they create the forces that accelerate our atmosphere.

The pressure gradient force causes an acceleration forcing air from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure. Mathematically, this can be written as:

:formula_20

The gravitational force accelerates objects at approximately 9.8 m/s2 directly towards the center of the Earth.

The force due to viscous friction can be approximated as:

:formula_21

Using Newton&#x27;s second law, these forces (referenced in the equations above as the accelerations due to these forces) may be summed to produce an equation of motion that describes this system. This equation can be written in the form:

:formula_22
:formula_23

Therefore, to complete the system of equations and obtain 6 equations and 6 variables:
*formula_24

*formula_25
*formula_26
*formula_27

where n is the number density in mol, and T:=RT is the temperature equivalent value in Joule/mol.

==Forms of the primitive equations ==

The precise form of the primitive equations depends on the vertical coordinate system chosen, such as pressure coordinates, log pressure coordinates, or sigma coordinates. Furthermore, the velocity, temperature, and geopotential variables may be decomposed into mean and perturbation components using Reynolds decomposition.

=== Pressure coordinate in vertical, Cartesian tangential plane ===

In this form pressure is selected as the vertical coordinate and the horizontal coordinates are written for the Cartesian tangential plane (i.e. a plane tangent to some point on the surface of the Earth). This form does not take the curvature of the Earth into account, but is useful for visualizing some of the physical processes involved in formulating the equations due to its relative simplicity.

Note that the capital D time derivatives are material derivatives. Five equations in five unknowns comprise the system.

* the hydrostatic equation, a special case of the vertical momentum equation in which vertical acceleration is considered negligible:

::formula_30

* the continuity equation, connecting horizontal divergence/convergence to vertical motion under the hydrostatic approximation (formula_31):

* and the thermodynamic energy equation, a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics

::formula_33

When a statement of the conservation of water vapor substance is included, these six equations form the basis for any numerical weather prediction scheme.

=== Primitive equations using sigma coordinate system, polar stereographic projection ===
According to the &quot;National Weather Service Handbook No. 1 – Facsimile Products&quot;, the primitive equations can be simplified into the following equations:

* Zonal wind:
::formula_34

* Meridional wind:
::formula_35

* Temperature:
::formula_36

The first term is equal to the change in temperature due to incoming solar radiation and outgoing longwave radiation, which changes with time throughout the day. The second, third, and fourth terms are due to advection. Additionally, the variable &quot;T&quot; with subscript is the change in temperature on that plane. Each &quot;T&quot; is actually different and related to its respective plane. This is divided by the distance between grid points to get the change in temperature with the change in distance. When multiplied by the wind velocity on that plane, the units kelvins per meter and meters per second give kelvins per second. The sum of all the changes in temperature due to motions in the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; directions give the total change in temperature with time.

* Precipitable water:
::formula_37

This equation and notation works in much the same way as the temperature equation. This equation describes the motion of water from one place to another at a point without taking into account water that changes form. Inside a given system, the total change in water with time is zero. However, concentrations are allowed to move with the wind.

* Pressure thickness:
::formula_38

These simplifications make it much easier to understand what is happening in the model. Things like the temperature (potential temperature), precipitable water, and to an extent the pressure thickness simply move from one spot on the grid to another with the wind. The wind is forecast slightly differently. It uses geopotential, specific heat, the Exner function &quot;π&quot;, and change in sigma coordinate.

==Solution to the linearized primitive equations==
The analytic solution to the linearized primitive equations involves a sinusoidal oscillation in time and longitude, modulated by coefficients related to height and latitude.

:formula_39

where &quot;s&quot; and formula_40 are the zonal wavenumber and angular frequency, respectively. The solution represents atmospheric waves and tides.

When the coefficients are separated into their height and latitude components, the height dependence takes the form of propagating or evanescent waves (depending on conditions), while the latitude dependence is given by the Hough functions.

This analytic solution is only possible when the primitive equations are linearized and simplified. Unfortunately many of these simplifications (i.e. no dissipation, isothermal atmosphere) do not correspond to conditions in the actual atmosphere. As a result, a numerical solution which takes these factors into account is often calculated using general circulation models and climate models.

<text>The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) is a New World vulture and the largest North American land bird. It became extinct in the wild in 1987 when all remaining wild individuals were captured, but has since been reintroduced to northern Arizona and southern Utah (including the Grand Canyon area and Zion National Park), the coastal mountains of California, and northern Baja California in Mexico. It is the only surviving member of the genus &quot;Gymnogyps&quot;, although four extinct members of the genus are also known. The species is listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as Critically Endangered, and similarly considered &quot;Critically Imperiled&quot; by NatureServe.

The plumage is black with patches of white on the underside of the wings; the head is largely bald, with skin color ranging from gray on young birds to yellow and bright orange on breeding adults. Its wingspan is the widest of any North American bird, and its weight of up to nearly equals that of the trumpeter swan, the heaviest among native North American bird species. The condor is a scavenger and eats large amounts of carrion. It is one of the world&#x27;s longest-living birds, with a lifespan of up to 60 years.

Condor numbers dramatically declined in the 20th century due to agricultural chemicals (DDT), poaching, lead poisoning, and habitat destruction. A conservation plan put in place by the United States government led to the capture of all the remaining wild condors by 1987, with a total population of 27 individuals. These surviving birds were bred at the San Diego Wild Animal Park and the Los Angeles Zoo. Numbers rose through captive breeding, and beginning in 1991, condors were reintroduced into the wild. Since then, their population has grown, but the California condor remains one of the world&#x27;s rarest bird species. By 31 December 2023, the Fish and Wildlife Service had updated the total world population of 561. A May 2024 population estimate of 561 is provided by the non-profit Ventana Wildlife Society on their website. The condor is a significant bird to many Californian Native American groups and plays an important role in several of their traditional myths.

==Taxonomy==

The California condor was described by English naturalist George Shaw in 1797 as &quot;Vultur californianus&quot;; Archibald Menzies collected the type specimen &quot;from the coast of California&quot; during the Vancouver expedition. It was originally classified in the same genus as the Andean condor (&quot;V. gryphus&quot;), but, due to the Andean condor&#x27;s slightly different markings, slightly longer wings, and tendency to kill small animals to eat, the California condor has been placed in its own monotypic genus. The generic name &quot;Gymnogyps&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;gymnos&quot;/γυμνος &quot;naked&quot; or &quot;bare&quot;, and &quot;gyps&quot;/γυψ &quot;vulture&quot;, while the specific name &quot;californianus&quot; comes from its location in California. The word condor itself is derived from the Quechua word &quot;kuntur&quot;.
The exact taxonomic placement of the California condor and the other six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though similar in appearance and ecological roles to Old World vultures, the New World vultures evolved from a different ancestor in a different part of the world. Just how different the two are is under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in &quot;Incertae sedis&quot;, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.

As of the 51st Supplement (2010) of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, the California condor is in the family Cathartidae of the order Cathartiformes.

===Evolutionary history===

The genus &quot;Gymnogyps&quot; is an example of a relict distribution. During the Pleistocene Epoch, this genus was widespread across the Americas. From fossils, the Floridian &quot;Gymnogyps kofordi&quot; from the Early Pleistocene and the Peruvian &quot;Gymnogyps howardae&quot; from the Late Pleistocene have been described. A condor found in Late Pleistocene deposits on Cuba was initially described as &quot;Antillovultur varonai&quot;, but has since been recognized as another member of &quot;Gymnogyps&quot;, &quot;Gymnogyps varonai&quot;. It may even have derived from a founder population of California condors.

The California condor is the sole surviving member of &quot;Gymnogyps&quot; and has no accepted subspecies. However, there is a Late Pleistocene form that is sometimes regarded as a palaeosubspecies, &quot;Gymnogyps californianus amplus&quot;. Opinions are mixed, regarding the classification of the form as either a chronospecies or a separate species, &quot;Gymnogyps amplus&quot;. &quot;Gymnogyps amplus&quot; occurred over much of the bird&#x27;s historical range – even extending into Florida – but was larger, having about the same weight as the Andean condor. This bird also had a wider bill. As the climate changed during the last ice age, the entire population became smaller until it had evolved into the &quot;Gymnogyps californianus&quot; of today, although more recent studies by Syverson question that theory.

==Description==

The adult California condor is a uniform black with the exception of large triangular patches or bands of white on the underside of the wings. It has gray legs and feet, an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black feathers surrounding the base of the neck, and brownish red eyes. The juvenile is mostly a mottled dark brown with blackish coloration on the head. It has mottled gray instead of white on the underside of its flight feathers.

The condor&#x27;s head has little to no feathers, which helps keep it clean when feeding on carrion. The skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state. The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or grunting sounds only heard when very close.
The female condor is smaller than the male, an exception to the rule among birds of prey (the related Andean condor is another exception). Overall length ranges from and wingspan from . Their weight ranges from , with estimations of average weight ranging from . Wingspans of up to have been reported but no wingspan over has been verified. Most measurements are from birds raised in captivity, so it is difficult to determine if major differences exist between wild and captive condors.

California condors have the largest wingspan of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large that they can be mistaken for a small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than that they are mistaken for other bird species.

The middle toe of the California condor&#x27;s foot is greatly elongated, and the hind toe is only slightly developed. The talons of all the toes are straight and blunt and are thus more adapted to walking than gripping. This is more similar to their supposed relatives the storks than to birds of prey and Old World vultures, which use their feet as weapons or organs of prehension.

==Historic range==

At the time of human settlement of the Americas, the California condor was widespread across North America; condor bones from the late Pleistocene have been found at the Cutler Fossil Site in southern Florida. However, at the end of the last glacial period came the extinction of the megafauna that led to a subsequent reduction in range and population. Five hundred years ago, the California condor roamed across the American Southwest and West Coast. Faunal remains of condors have been found documented in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. The Lewis and Clark Expedition of the early 19th century reported on their sighting and shooting of California condors near the mouth of the Columbia River.

In the 1970s, two Condor Observation Sites were established in the Santa Clara River Valley to host hopeful birders interested in the endangered species: one about 15 miles north of Fillmore, California, near the Sespe Wildlife Area of Los Padres National Forest, and one atop Mount Pinos, &quot;accessible from a dirt road off the highway in from Gorman&quot;.

==Habitat==
The California condor lives in rocky shrubland, coniferous forest, and oak savanna. They are often found near cliffs or large trees, which they use as nesting sites. Individual birds have a huge range and have been known to travel up to in search of carrion.

There are two sanctuaries chosen because of their prime condor nesting habitat: the Sisquoc Condor Sanctuary in the San Rafael Wilderness and the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in the Los Padres National Forest.

The Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act of 1992 expanded existing wilderness by and designated of new wilderness that provide habitat for the condor in the Los Padres.

==Ecology and behavior==

The California condor&#x27;s large flight muscles are not anchored by a correspondingly large sternum, which restricts them to being primarily soarers. The birds flap their wings when taking off from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation they largely glide, sometimes going for miles without a single flap of their wings. They have been known to fly up to speeds of and as high as . They prefer to roost on high perches from which they can launch without any major wing-flapping effort. Often, these birds are seen soaring near rock cliffs, using thermals to aid them in keeping aloft.

The California condor has a long life span, reaching up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, and a variety of hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.

===Breeding===

Condors begin to look for a mate when they reach sexual maturity at the age of 6. To attract a prospective mate, the male condor performs a display, in which the male turns his head red and puffs out his neck feathers. He then spreads his wings and slowly approaches the female. If the female lowers her head to accept the male, the condors become mates for life. The pair makes a simple nest in caves or on cliff clefts, especially ones with nearby roosting trees and open spaces for landing. A mated female lays one bluish-white egg every other year. Eggs are laid as early as January to as late as April. The egg weighs about and measures from in length and about in width. If the chick or egg is lost or removed, the parents &quot;double clutch&quot;, or lay another egg to take the lost one&#x27;s place. Researchers and breeders take advantage of this behavior to double the reproductive rate by taking the first egg away for puppet-rearing; this induces the parents to lay a second (or even third) egg, which the condors are sometimes allowed to raise.

The eggs hatch after 53 to 60 days of incubation by both parents. Chicks are born with their eyes open and sometimes can take up to a week to leave the shell completely. The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after 5 to 6 months, but continue to roost and forage with their parents until they are in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest. Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.

In 2021, the San Diego Zoo reported having had two unfertilized eggs hatch within its breeding program in 2001 and 2009, producing male young by parthenogenesis as indicated by genetic studies. The mothers had been housed with males and had mated before, but the offspring lacked markers of male paternity and showed all-maternal inheritance, suggesting the specific mechanism of parthenogenesis involved automixis, gametic fusion, or endomitosis. Earlier evidence of similar parthenogenesis in birds found that among the known examples the embryos died before hatching, unlike these condor chicks. Neither chick lived to sexual maturity, preventing data collection on their reproductive potential.

In July 2024, the LA Zoo reported that a record-setting 17 California condor chicks hatched during the year&#x27;s breeding season, crediting the surge on novel breeding and rearing techniques developed by their condor team. The technique involves introducing 2 to 3 chicks to a single surrogate mature condor who raises them. Due to the endangered status of the California condor, all 17 chicks are to be released into the wild. 

===Feeding===

Wild condors maintain a large home range, often traveling a day in search of carrion. It is thought that in the early days of its existence as a species, the California condor lived off the carcasses of the Pleistocene megafauna, which are largely extinct in North America. They still prefer to feast on large, terrestrial mammalian carcasses such as deer, goats, sheep, donkeys, horses, pigs, cougars, bears, or cattle. Alternatively, they may feed on the bodies of smaller mammals such as rabbits, squirrels, and coyotes, aquatic mammals such as whales and California sea lions, or salmon. Bird and reptile carcasses are rarely eaten. Condors prefer fresh kills, but they also eat decayed food when necessary. Since they do not have a sense of smell, they spot these corpses by looking for other scavengers, like eagles and smaller vultures, the latter of which cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of the larger condor. They can usually intimidate other scavengers away from the carcass, with the exception of bears, which will ignore them, and golden eagles, which will fight a condor over a kill or a carcass. In the wild they are intermittent eaters, often going for between a few days to two weeks without eating, then gorging themselves on of meat at once.

==Conservation==
The California condor conservation project may be one of the most expensive species conservation projects in United States history, costing over $35 million, including $20 million in federal and state funding, since World War II. As of 2007, the annual cost for the condor conservation program was around $2.0 million per year. Successful reintroduction of captive-bred condors into the wild has become a multi-step and complex process, fraught with the need to periodically recapture the birds to test for lead poisoning and sometimes the necessity for lead removal by chelation.

===Recovery plan===

As the condor&#x27;s population continued to decline, discussion began about starting a captive breeding program for the birds. Opponents to this plan argued that the condors had the right to freedom and that capturing all of the condors would change the species&#x27; habits forever, and that the cost was too great. The project received the approval of the United States government, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service established the California Condor Recovery Program in 1979. The capture of the remaining wild condors was completed on Easter Sunday 1987, when AC-9, the last wild condor, was captured. At that point, there were only 22 surviving condors, all of them in captivity. The goal of the California Condor Recovery Plan was to establish two geographically separate populations, one in California and the other in Arizona, each with 150 birds and at least 15 breeding pairs.

The study and capture of the remaining California condors was made possible through the efforts of Jan Hamber, an ornithologist with the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. Hamber personally captured AC-9, the final wild California condor, and her dedication to the bird&#x27;s conservation led her to compile decades of field notes into the Condor Archives, a searchable database focused on condor biology and conservation.

The captive breeding program, led by the San Diego Wild Animal Park and Los Angeles Zoo, and with other participating zoos around the country, including the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden, got off to a slow start due to the condor&#x27;s mating habits. However, utilizing the bird&#x27;s ability to double clutch, biologists began removing the first egg from the nest and raising it with puppets, allowing the parents to lay another egg.

Aside from breeding programs, the Condor Recovery Center at Oakland Zoo treats condors that are ill from lead poisoning.
=== Reintroduction to the wild ===
In 1988, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California. Only females were released, to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a South American species into the United States. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America. California condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California at Big Sur, Pinnacles National Park and Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge and in 1996 at the Vermilion Cliffs release site in Arizona near the Grand Canyon. The Fish and Wildlife Service designated the Arizona condors as an &quot;experimental, nonessential&quot; animal so they would not affect land regulations or development as ranchers were concerned they could be charged with an offense if any birds were injured on their property after the release. Though the birth rate remains low in the wild, their numbers are increasing steadily through regular releases of captive-reared adolescents.

===Obstacles to recovery===
In modern times, numerous causes have contributed to the California condor&#x27;s decline, both before and after recovery efforts began. For example, between 1992 and 2013, 237 condor deaths occurred in the wild population. The leading cause of mortality in condor nestlings is the ingestion of trash that is fed to them by their parents. Among juveniles and adults, lead poisoning (from eating animal carcasses containing lead shot) is the leading cause of death.

Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, DDT poisoning, electric power lines, egg collecting, and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets.

Its low clutch size (one young per nest) and late age of sexual maturity (≈6 years) make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline.

Inbreeding may be causing increased incidence of fatal chondrodystrophic dwarfism in wild condors, as well as a syndrome presenting with 14 rather than the typical 12 tail feathers. A 2021 study found a surprising degree of genomic diversity in condors, however. Such data allow refinement to conservation strategies, helping mitigate the effects of inbreeding. One of the study&#x27;s authors hopes to complete genomic analysis of all 22 individuals from which all living condors descend.

====Lead poisoning====
Lead poisoning is a significant threat to condors and other avian and terrestrial scavengers Fragmented lead ammunition in large game waste is highly problematic for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices. Blood-lead analysis of wild condors showed lead isotope signature matches to ammunition purchased by researchers near the range of the affected condors. In California, the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act went into effect July 1, 2008, requiring that hunters use non-lead ammunition when hunting in the condor&#x27;s range. Blood lead levels in golden eagles as well as turkey vultures has declined with the implementation of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, demonstrating that the legislation has helped reduce other species&#x27; lead exposures aside from the California condor. There is no comparable anti-lead-bullet legislation in the other states in which the condor resides.

In 2015, Bruce Rideout, director of the wildlife disease laboratories for San Diego Zoo Global, indicated that lead poisoning is the most common cause of death for juvenile and adult condors in the wild. Among wild deaths with known causes between 1992 and 2013, over 60% (excluding chicks and fledglings) have been as a result of lead poisoning. Due to condors&#x27; long lifespan (over 50 years) and relatively late age of sexual maturity (≈6 years), and small clutch size in the wild (one egg every year or two), the population is very poorly suited to withstand the neurotoxic effects of lead exposure.&quot;

According to epidemiologist Terra Kelly, until all natural food sources are free from lead-based ammunition, &quot;lead poisoning will threaten recovery of naturally sustaining populations of condors in the wild.&quot; While researchers and veterinarians involved in the condor recovery program note that hunters who use lead-free ammunition actually provide critical sources of food for condors and other scavengers, they caution that using lead ammunition presents a serious and preventable threat to condors and other wildlife.

====Other premature death====
Premature condor death may also occur due to contact with golden eagles, whose talons enable defense of carrion against condors. Evidence from condor release efforts also suggests golden eagles may occasionally kill condors.

Collision with power lines can also result in condor death. Since 1994, captive-bred California condors have been trained to avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of condor deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased.

====Trash ingestion====
&quot;Being vultures, condors not only eat dead animals but they also have been observed eating small pieces of bone [which is especially crucial during the egg-laying period]. Although extremely intelligent, condors can’t always tell the difference between small pieces of trash and pieces of bone,&quot; according to Tim Hauck, Project Director for the California Condor Reintroduction Program. Indigestible trash can cause impaction, starvation, and death if affected condors do not receive timely medical intervention. Parent birds may unintentionally feed microtrash to nestlings, which some research has shown to be the leading cause of death among wild condor nestlings.

====Disease====
In 2023, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infected members of the Utah-Arizona flock, killing 21 condors (including 13 individuals from 8 breeding pairs). Other individuals were released back into the wild following medical treatment. Sixteen condors were treated as part of a vaccine trial. As of 2 February 2024, 94 condors had received at least the first of two doses of the vaccine.

During routine winter trapping intended to assess lead levels, blood samples collected from 21 condors were tested for HPAI antibodies. About half the samples showed the presence of antibodies to the H5N1 strain of HPAI, indicating these birds were exposed to the virus and survived naturally.

=== Population growth ===
Nesting milestones have been reached by the reintroduced condors. In 2003, the first nestling fledged in the wild since 1981. In March 2006, a pair of California condors, released by Ventana Wildlife Society, attempted to nest in a hollow tree near Big Sur, California. This was the first time in more than 100 years that a pair of California condors had been seen nesting in Northern California.

In October 2010, the wild condor population reached 100 individuals in its namesake state of California, plus 73 wild condors in Arizona. In November 2011, there were 394 living individuals, 205 of them in the wild and the rest in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, the Santa Barbara Zoo, the Los Angeles Zoo, the Oregon Zoo, and the World Center for Birds of Prey in Boise, Idaho. In May 2012, the number of living individuals had reached 405, with 179 living in captivity. By June 2014, the condor population had reached 439: 225 in the wild and 214 in captivity. Official statistics from the December 2016 USFWS recorded an overall population of 446, of which 276 are wild and 170 are captive. A key milestone was reached in 2015 when more condors were born in the wild than died.

=== Reintroduction to Mexico ===

As the Recovery Program achieved milestones, a fifth active release site in Sierra de San Pedro Mártir National Park, Baja California, Mexico, was added to the three release sites in California and the release site in Arizona. In early 2007, a California condor laid an egg in Mexico for the first time since at least the 1930s.

In June 2016, three chicks that were born in Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City, were flown to Sierra de San Pedro Mártir National Park, Baja California, Mexico. In the spring of 2009, a second wild chick was born in the Sierra de San Pedro Mártir National Park and was named &quot;Inyaa&quot; (&quot;Sun&quot; in the Kiliwa language) by local environmentalists.

=== Expanded range ===
In 2014, Condor #597, also known as &quot;Lupine&quot;, was spotted near Pescadero, a coastal community south of San Francisco. Lupine had been routinely seen at Pinnacles National Park after having been released into the wild at Big Sur the previous year. Younger birds of the central California population are seeking to expand their territory, which could mean that a new range expansion is possible for the more than 60 condors flying free in central California. Also in 2014 the first successful breeding in Utah was reported. A pair of condors that had been released in Arizona, nested in Zion National Park and the hatching of one chick was confirmed. The 1,000th chick since recovery efforts began hatched in Zion in May 2019. The California condor was seen for the first time in nearly 50 years in Sequoia National Park in late May 2020.

As part of an effort headed by the Yurok tribe to reintroduce the condor (Yurok name &#x27;prey-go-neesh&#x27;) to the coastal redwoods of northern California, birds hatched at the Oregon Zoo and the World Center for Birds of Prey were released at Redwood National Park in 2022. The first condor brought to the Yurok site was called Paaytoqin from the Nez Perce language meaning &#x27;Come back&#x27;; he is also known as &#x27;Mentor&#x27; or #736. He was brought to the site, but not released, to help instruct the younger condors how to behave &quot;because of his calm nature and good disposition&quot;. Mentor condors are used to serve as a role model and establish a social hierarchy within a flock as an essential part of its survival.

The first condor to be released was called Poy’-we-son (Yurok for &quot;the one who goes ahead&quot;), followed by Nes-kwe-chokw (&quot;He returns&quot;), Ney-gem’ ‘Ne-chweenkah’ (&quot;She carries our prayers&quot;) and ‘Hlow Hoo-let’ (&quot;At last I (or we) fly!&quot;). The youngsters felt at home with one another having lived together at other facilities. As of March 2024 11 birds (4 females and 7 males) have been successfully introduced, with another 5 or more being released this year. An article in the North Coast Journal from November 2023 describes the 11 birds with their names and translations. By the end of November 2024, 18 condors have been released at the site.

===Condor Watch===

A crowdsourcing project called Condor Watch (CW) was started on April 14, 2014, and ended in 2020. Hosted by the web portal Zooniverse, volunteers were asked to examine motion-capture images of California condors associated with release sites managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service and Ventana Wildlife Society. The tasks on the website included identifying tagged condors and marking the distance to feeding sources such as animal carcasses. Biologists can then use this data to deduce which birds are at risk of lead poisoning.

Condor Watch enabled volunteers, or citizen scientists, to participate in active research. The project had up 175,000 images to view and assess, far more than the team could hope to view on their own. Lead scientist Myra Finkelstein believes volunteering is fun because it allows enthusiasts to track the &quot;biographies&quot; of individual condors. Citizen science has long been used in ornithology, for instance in the Audubon Society&#x27;s Christmas Bird Count, which began in 1900 and the breeding bird survey which began in 1966. McCaffrey (2005) believes this approach not only directly benefits ongoing projects, but will also help train aspiring ornithologists.

==Relationship with humans==

Throughout its historic range, the California condor has been a popular subject of mythology and an important symbol to Native Americans. Unusually, this bird takes on different roles in the storytelling of the different tribes.

The Wiyot tribe of California say that the condor recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped humanity out with a flood. However, other tribes, such as California&#x27;s Mono, view the condor as a destroyer, not a creator; they say that Condor seized humans, cut off their heads, and drained their blood so that it would flood Ground Squirrel&#x27;s home. Condor then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor&#x27;s head when Condor paused to take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokuts people, the condor sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses. The Chumash tribe of Southern California tell that the condor was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew too close to a fire.

Condor bones have been found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave paintings of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a Shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing had to be made for his successor.

Some researchers such as Snyder believe that this practice of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor&#x27;s decline, writing that California Indians killed up to 700 condors each year. Snyder continues that this figure of 700 is &quot;no doubt an unrealistically high estimate&quot;, writing that any estimate &quot;would remain impressively high even if divided by 10&quot;. A few tribes were known to have killed condors such as the Miwok, the Patwin, the Luiseño and the Pomo but how many is not known and difficult to judge. Using available information, Wilbur writes that &quot;a pre-European loss of condors to Indians might not have exceeded a dozen [12] or so annually.&quot; Wilbur concludes that Indians might have contributed to the decline of California condors, &quot;but their impact was minor except in highly localized situations.&quot;

<text>The Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) is a South American New World vulture and is the only member of the genus Vultur. It is found in the Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America. With a maximum wingspan of and weight of , the Andean condor is one of the largest flying birds in the world, and is generally considered to be the largest bird of prey in the world.

It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird&#x27;s emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. The female condor is smaller than the male, an exception to the usual sexual dimorphism seen in birds of prey.

The condor is primarily a scavenger, feeding on carrion. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of deer or cattle. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and nests at elevations of up to , generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world&#x27;s longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.

The Andean condor is a national symbol of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru and plays an important role in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered vulnerable by the IUCN. It is threatened by habitat loss and by secondary poisoning from lead in carcasses killed by hunters. Captive breeding programs have been instituted in several countries.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Andean condor was described by Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and retains its original binomial name of &quot;Vultur gryphus&quot;. The Andean condor is sometimes called the Argentinean condor, Bolivian condor, Chilean condor, Colombian condor, Ecuadorian condor, or Peruvian condor after one of the nations to which it is native. The generic term &quot;Vultur&quot; is directly taken from the Latin &quot;vultur&quot; or &quot;voltur&quot;, which means &quot;vulture&quot;. Its specific epithet is derived from a variant of the Greek word γρυπός (&quot;grupós&quot;, &quot;hook-nosed&quot;). The word condor itself is derived from the Quechua &quot;kuntur&quot;.

The exact taxonomic placement of the Andean condor and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Although both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world and are not closely related. Just how different the two families are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Accipitriformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead described them as &quot;incertae sedis&quot;, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.

The Andean condor is the only accepted living species of its genus, &quot;Vultur&quot;. Unlike the California condor (&quot;Gymnogyps californianus&quot;), which is known from extensive fossil remains and some additional ones of congeners, the fossil record of the Andean condor recovered to date is scant. Presumed Plio-Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species, although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of Tarija Department, Bolivia, may have been a smaller palaeo subspecies, &quot;V. gryphus patruus&quot;.

==Description==
The overall length of the Andean condor can range from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is and the tarsus is . Measurements are usually taken from specimens reared in captivity. The mean weight is , with the males averaging about a kilogram more at , the females a kilogram less at . Condors possess the heaviest average weight for any living flying bird or animal, ahead of trumpeter swans (&quot;Cygnus buccinator&quot;) and Dalmatian pelicans (&quot;Pelecanus crispus&quot;). However, other sources claim a mean species body mass of for the Andean condor. The Andean condor is the largest living land bird capable of flight if measured in terms of average weight and wingspan, although male bustards of the largest species (far more sexually dimorphic in size) can weigh more. The mean wingspan is around and the wings have the largest surface area of any extant bird. It has a maximum wingspan of . Among living bird species, only the great albatrosses and the two largest species of pelican exceed the Andean condor in average and maximal wingspan.

The adult plumage is all black, except for a frill of white feathers at the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white bands on the wings, which only appear after the bird&#x27;s first moult. The head and neck, kept meticulously clean, are red to blackish-red, and have few feathers. Their baldness means the skin is more exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and high-altitude UV light. The crown of the head is flattened, and (in the male) is topped by a dark red comb (also called a caruncle); the skin hanging from its neck is called a wattle. Males also have yellower skin. When condors are agitated (for example, during courtship), their head and neck flush, a clear signal to animals nearby. This flush of colour is especially intense in dominant males when feeding at carcasses, and can happen in just a few seconds. Juveniles are grayish-brown, but with a blackish head and neck, and a brown ruff.

The middle toe is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only slightly developed, while the talons of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted to walking, and are of little use as weapons or organs of prehension as in birds of prey and Old World vultures. The beak is hooked, and adapted to tear rotting meat. The irises of the male are brown, while those of the female are deep red. They have no eyelashes. Unlike the case with most other birds of prey, the female is smaller.

Observation of wing color patterns, and the size and shape of the male&#x27;s crest, are the best ways of identifying individual Andean condors. Sighting-resighting methods assess the size and structure of populations.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Andean condor is found in South America in the Andes and the Santa Marta Mountains. In the north, its range begins in Venezuela and Colombia, where it is extremely rare, then continues south along the Andes in Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, through Bolivia and western Argentina to the Tierra del Fuego. In the early 19th century, the Andean condor bred from western Venezuela to Tierra del Fuego, along the entire chain of the Andes, but its range has been greatly reduced due to human activity. Its habitat is mainly composed of open grasslands and alpine areas up to in elevation. It prefers relatively open, non-forested areas which allow it to spot carrion from the air, such as the páramo or rocky, mountainous areas in general. It occasionally ranges to lowlands in eastern Bolivia, northern Peru, and southwestern Brazil, descends to lowland desert areas in Chile and Peru, and is found over southern-beech forests in Patagonia. In southern Patagonia, meadows are important for Andean condors as this habitat is likely to have herbivores present. In this region, Andean condor distributions are therefore influenced by the locations of meadows as well as cliffs for nesting and roosting.

==Ecology and behavior==

The condor soars with its wings held horizontally and its primary feathers bent upwards at the tips. The lack of a large sternum to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer. It flaps its wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation it flaps its wings very rarely, relying on thermals to stay aloft. In &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;, Charles Darwin mentioned watching condors for half an hour without once observing a flap of their wings. It prefers to roost on high places from which it can launch without major wing-flapping effort. Andean condors are often seen soaring near rock cliffs, using the heat thermals to aid them in rising in the air. Flight recorders have shown that &quot;75% of the birds&#x27; flapping was associated with take-off&quot;, and that it &quot;flaps its wings just 1% of the time during flight&quot;. The proportion of time for flapping is more for short flights. Flapping between two thermal glides is more than flapping between two slope glides.

Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has the unusual habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through evaporation has been proposed as a reason for this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.

There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a &#x27;pecking order&#x27; by body language, competitive play behavior, and vocalizations. Generally, mature males tend to be at the top of the pecking order, with post-dispersal immature males tending to be near the bottom.

===Breeding===

Sexual maturity and breeding behavior do not appear in the Andean condor until the bird is five or six years of age. It may live to 50 years or more, and it mates for life. During courtship displays, the skin of the male&#x27;s neck flushes, changing from dull red to bright yellow, and inflates. He approaches the female with neck outstretched, revealing the inflated neck and the chest patch, while hissing, then extends his wings and stands erect while clicking his tongue. Other courtship rituals include hissing and clucking while hopping with wings partially spread, and dancing. 

The Andean condor prefers to roost and breed at elevations of . Its nest, which consists of a few sticks placed around the eggs, is created on inaccessible ledges of rock. However, in coastal areas of Peru, where there are few cliffs, some nests are simply partially shaded crannies scraped out against boulders on slopes. It deposits one bluish-white egg, weighing about and ranging from in length. Breeding occurs about every second year, in the southern Andes around October, in the central and northern Andes it can be throughout the year. The egg hatches after 54 to 58 days of incubation by both parents. If the chick or egg is lost or removed, another egg is laid to take its place. Researchers and breeders take advantage of this behavior to double the reproductive rate by taking the first egg away for hand-rearing, causing the parents to lay a second egg, which they are generally allowed to raise. The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but continue to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch.

===Feeding===
The Andean condor is a scavenger, feeding mainly on carrion. Wild condors inhabit large territories, often traveling more than a day in search of carrion. In inland areas, they prefer large carcasses. Naturally, they feed on the largest carcasses available, which can include llamas (&quot;Lama glama&quot;), alpacas (&quot;Lama pacos&quot;), rheas (&quot;Rhea ssp.&quot;), guanacos (&quot;Lama guanicoe&quot;), deer and armadillos. Wild individuals could acquire extra carotenoids from vegetal matter contained in carcass viscera and fresh vegetation. However, most inland condors now live largely off of domestic animals, which are now more widespread in South America, such as cattle (&quot;Bos taurus&quot;), horses (&quot;Equus caballus&quot;), donkeys (&quot;Equus asinus&quot;), mules, sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;), domestic pigs (&quot;Sus domesticus&quot;), domestic goats (&quot;Capra hircus&quot;) and dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;). They also feed on the carcasses of introduced game species such as wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), rabbits (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;), foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) and red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;). For condors who live around the coast, the diet consists mainly of beached carcasses of marine mammals, largely cetaceans. They will also raid the nests of smaller birds to feed on the eggs. Andean condors have been observed to do some hunting of small, live animals, such as rodents, birds and rabbits, which (given their lack of powerful, grasping feet or developed hunting technique) they usually kill by jabbing repeatedly with their bill.
Coastal areas provide a constant food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers, such as corvids or other vultures. It may follow New World vultures of the genus &quot;Cathartes&quot;—the turkey vulture (&quot;C. aura&quot;), the lesser yellow-headed vulture (&quot;C. burrovianus&quot;), and the greater yellow-headed vulture (&quot;C. melambrotus&quot;)—to carcasses. The &quot;Cathartes&quot; vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of the larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species. However, studies have indicated that Andean condors are fairly proficient at searching out carrion without needing to rely on other scavengers to guide them to it. Black vultures (&quot;Coragyps atratus&quot;) and several mammalian carnivorous scavengers such as foxes may sometimes track &quot;Cathartes&quot; vultures for carcasses or compete with condors over available carrion but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range. A study in Patagonia found surprisingly that condors were driving the ecology of puma (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) in the area, apparently by routinely commandeering the powerful cat&#x27;s kills (often the day following the puma&#x27;s nighttime kills). It is projected that the condors were able to engage in harassment of the pumas despite the large cat&#x27;s size and power, and has apparently driven the pumas to increase their kill rate in order to accommodate for their frequent losses to the scavengers. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes to the point of being unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.

Andean condors can efficiently absorb a wide variety of carotenoid pigments from the vegetal matter within the viscera that they consume from carcasses. These include carotenoids such as β-carotene and echineone. The pigments result in the yellow skin colouration of adult males and their ability to flush their skin a brilliant yellow during contests for dominance, as well as the colour of the iris and bright orange tongues of both sexes. Captive Andean condors have a lower concentration of carotenoid pigments in their bodies than wild condors, likely because the diet of captive condors is usually restricted to just flesh. An analysis of the droppings of wild condors found that 90% contained vegetal remains, and of those that contained vegetal remains, 35% of them were composed of primarily vegetal matter (around 80% by volume). The potential sources for the vegetal matter is posited to include the viscera of herbivore carcasses as well as fresh vegetation.

===Longevity===
Being a slowly-maturing bird with no known natural predators in adulthood, an Andean condor is a long-lived bird. Longevity and mortality rates are not known to have been extensively studied in the wild. Some estimations of lifespans of wild birds has exceeded 50 years. In 1983, the Guinness Book of World Records considered the longest-lived bird of any species with a confirmed lifespan was an Andean condor that died after surviving 72 years in captivity, having been captured from the wild as a juvenile of undetermined age. Several species of parrot have been reported to live for perhaps over 100 years in captivity, but these (at least in 1983) were not considered authenticated. Another early captive-held specimen of condor reportedly lived for 71 years. However, these lifespans have been exceeded by a male, nicknamed &quot;Thaao&quot;, that was kept at Beardsley Zoo in Connecticut. Thaao was born in captivity in 1930 and died on January 26, 2010, making him 79 years of age. This is the greatest verified age ever known for a bird.

==Relationship with humans==

===Conservation status===
The Andean condor is considered vulnerable by the IUCN and the Peruvian Conservation Organization. As a result of research on its plight, its status was changed to Vulnerable from Near Threatened in 2020, and only about 10,000 individuals remain. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which stems from the fact that it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive.

In response to the capture of all the wild individuals of the California condor, in 1988 the US Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California. Only females were released to prevent it becoming an invasive species. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America before the reintroduction of the California condors took place.

In June 2014, local authorities of the Ancasmarca region rescued two Andean condors that were caged and displayed in a local market as an attraction for tourists.

===Role in culture===

The Andean condor is a national symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuelan Andes states. It is the national bird of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. It plays an important role in the folklore and mythology of the South American Andean regions, and has been represented in Andean art from onward, and they are a part of indigenous Andean religions. In Andean mythology, the Andean condor was associated with the sun deity, and was believed to be the ruler of the upper world. The Andean condor is considered a symbol of power and health by many Andean cultures, and it was believed that the bones and organs of the Andean condor possessed medicinal powers, sometimes leading to the hunting and killing of condors to obtain its bones and organs. In some versions of Peruvian bullfighting (&quot;Yawar Fiesta&quot; or &quot;Blood Festival&quot;), a condor is tied to the back of a bull, where it pecks at the animal as bullfighters fight it. The condor generally survives and is set free.

The Andean condor is a popular figure on stamps in many countries, appearing on one for Ecuador in 1958, Argentina in 1960, Peru in 1973, Bolivia in 1985, Colombia in 1992, Chile in 1935 and 2001, and Venezuela in 2004. It has also appeared on the coins and banknotes of Colombia and Chile.

<doc id="307158" wikidata="Q851611" url="?curid=307158" title="Bugsy Malone">
<text>Bugsy Malone is a 1976 gangster musical comedy film written and directed by Alan Parker (in his feature film directorial debut). A co-production of United States and United Kingdom, it features an ensemble cast, comprising only child actors playing adult roles, with Jodie Foster, Scott Baio, and John Cassisi in major roles. The film tells the story of the rise of &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; and the battle for power between &quot;Fat Sam&quot; and &quot;Dandy Dan&quot;.

Set in New York City, it is a gangster movie spoof, with machine guns that fire gobs of whipped cream instead of bullets. The film is based loosely on events in New York and Chicago during Prohibition era, specifically the exploits of real-life gangsters such as Al Capone and Bugs Moran. Parker lightened the subject matter considerably for the children&#x27;s market and the film received a G rating in the U.S. &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; premiered at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or. It was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on July 23, 1976, by Fox-Rank Distributors, and in the United States by Paramount Pictures on September 15. Although a commercial success in the UK, it was not a financial success overseas. The film received critical acclaim, with praise drawn for Parker&#x27;s screenplay and direction, its musical numbers, unique narrative and the performances of the cast.

Over the years, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; has been cited amongst the greatest films in cinema history. In 2003, it was voted #19 on a list of the 100 greatest musicals, as chosen by viewers of Channel 4 in the UK. In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it 353rd on their list of 500 greatest movies of all time. 
The film received eight nominations at the 30th British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film, and won three: Best Supporting Actress and Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles for Foster and Best Screenplay for Parker. The film also received three nominations at the 34th Golden Globe Awards including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.

==Plot==
During the prohibition era, a mobster named Roxy Robinson is &quot;splurged&quot; by members of a rival gang, using rapid-fire cream-shooting &quot;splurge guns&quot;. Once splurged, a gangster is &quot;all washed up... finished&quot;. Mob boss Fat Sam Staccetto introduces himself in the opening narration, as well as introducing Bugsy Malone, a penniless boxing promoter who is &#x27;a little too popular with the broads... but a nice guy&#x27; (&quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;).

At Fat Sam&#x27;s Grand Slam Speakeasy, there is much dancing and singing (&quot;Fat Sam&#x27;s Grand Slam&quot;). Fat Sam rants about the loss of Roxy, who was one of his best men, laying the blame on up-and-coming rival mob boss Dandy Dan and worried that Dan is trying to take control of his criminal empire. Blousey Brown, an aspiring singer and actress, has come for an audition at the speakeasy, but Sam is too distracted to see her. Bugsy meets Blousey when he trips over her luggage; he is instantly smitten and attempts to flirt with her. Just then, Fat Sam&#x27;s is raided by Dandy Dan&#x27;s men, who shoot up the place. Over the next few weeks, Dan&#x27;s men continue to attack Fat Sam&#x27;s empire, eventually taking over all of Sam&#x27;s moneymaking rackets and splurging members of Fat Sam&#x27;s gang until only the speakeasy remains. Sam finds his gang fooling around (&quot;Bad Guys&quot;) and then sends all his available men except his personal enforcer Knuckles, to see if they can track down the guns but they are ambushed at a laundry and splurged by Dandy Dan&#x27;s gang.

Bugsy returns to Fat Sam&#x27;s to arrange a new audition for Blousey. Fat Sam&#x27;s girlfriend, the chanteuse Tallulah, makes a pass at him and, although Bugsy rejects her flirtation, Tallulah plants a big kiss on Bugsy&#x27;s forehead just as Blousey enters. Blousey is jealous but performs anyway, using her personal feelings to boost her performance (&quot;I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; Fine&quot;). Fat Sam hires Blousey after her audition and she leaves quickly, refusing to speak to Bugsy.

Sam hires Bugsy as a driver to accompany him to a truce meeting with Dandy Dan. He also takes along &quot;Looney&quot; Bergonzi, a top Chicago mob enforcer. The meeting is a trap, but Bugsy helps Fat Sam escape and is paid $200 by a grateful Sam. Bugsy and Blousey reconcile and have a romantic outing on a lake, where Bugsy promises to take her to Hollywood. When he returns Sam&#x27;s car to the garage he is attacked and his money is stolen. Bugsy is saved by Leroy Smith, who assaults the attackers and drives them away. Bugsy realizes that Leroy has the potential to be a great boxer and introduces him to boxing coach Cagey Joe (&quot;So You Wanna Be a Boxer?&quot;). Fat Sam seeks Bugsy&#x27;s aid again after Knuckles is accidentally splurged to death by a malfunctioning splurge gun knockoff. Bugsy resists but Fat Sam offers him $400, enough money to keep his promise to Blousey, although she is disappointed when she learns that Bugsy hasn&#x27;t bought the tickets to California yet (&quot;Ordinary Fool&quot;). Bugsy and Leroy follow Dandy Dan&#x27;s men to a warehouse where the guns are being stashed. They realize the two of them can&#x27;t take the place alone, so Bugsy recruits a large group of down-and-out workers at a soup kitchen (&quot;Down and Out&quot;). They successfully assault the warehouse and take the crates of guns.

Taking refuge at Fat Sam&#x27;s Speakeasy, Bugsy and his army disguise themselves as waiters and patrons and await Dan&#x27;s arrival. Chaos ensues as a massive splurge gun fight erupts and unarmed patrons throw cream pies, covering everyone (except Bugsy and Blousey), but somehow no one gets &quot;finished&quot; this time. Razamataz the piano player is hit from behind and falls onto the keys, striking a single bass chord. The tone silences the room, and the cream-covered crowd realize they can all be friends. They perform the final number (&quot;Bad Guys Reprise&quot; / &quot;You Give a Little Love&quot;) as Bugsy and Blousey leave for Hollywood.

==Production==
&quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; was Alan Parker&#x27;s first feature film. Parker was trying to find a film project that was not &quot;parochial&quot; and decided upon an American gangster setting: &quot;I had four young children and we used to go to a cottage in Derbyshire at weekends. On the long, boring car journey up there, I started telling them the story of a gangster called Bugsy Malone. They’d ask me questions and I’d make up answers, based on my memories of watching old movie reruns as a kid.&quot; His eldest son suggested children should be cast as the &quot;heroes&quot;.

Alan Marshall, who was a producer and partner on several TV commercials with Parker, encouraged him to do the script. David Puttnam, who had served as producer on Parker&#x27;s first script in &quot;Melody&quot; (1971), served as executive producer, helping to secure a deal with £1 million of funding that came from Rank Organisation and the National Film Finance Corporation, with the provision that a United States distributor was found. Richard Sylbert, the art director-turned-executive at Paramount Pictures was approached with Parker&#x27;s visual presentation of the material and agreed to help distribute the film.

===Casting===
The director chose to cast several unknown actors in the film. To find his Fat Sam, Parker visited a Brooklyn classroom, asking for &quot;the naughtiest boy in class&quot;. The students were unanimous in selecting John Cassisi, and Parker gave him the role. Florrie Dugger (Blousey) originally was cast in a smaller role; when the actress cast as Blousey suddenly grew taller than Baio, Dugger was promoted. She had been &quot;discovered&quot; at RAF Chicksands, an air force base in Bedfordshire where her American father was stationed. At the time of filming, all of the cast were under 17 years old.

Parker cast Baio after he slammed down the script and stormed out of his audition. Baio later remembered:

In Los Angeles, Parker met a 12-year-old Jodie Foster, who at the time was about to start the filming of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. About casting Foster as Tallulah and working with her, Parker said:

===Music===
Parker chose Paul Williams to score the film in order to get a more &quot;palatable&quot; modern sound, and simply because he liked him. Williams had scored Brian De Palma&#x27;s commercial failure &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot;, but had also written huge pop-radio hits (such as &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot; (lyrics), and &quot;(Just An) Old Fashioned Love Song&quot;). In fact, Williams would soon win an Oscar for his song &quot;Evergreen&quot; from the film &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1976).

Williams felt that &quot;... the challenge for me was to provide songs that reflected the period ... and yet maintained an energy that would hold the young audiences attention.&quot; According to Parker, Williams was writing while on tour, recording songs in different cities, and sending the completed tapes to Hollywood. Arriving during the first pre-shoot rehearsals, the songs had to be accepted and used as they were, with voices by Williams, Archie Hahn, and others.

Neither the director nor the songwriter were comfortable with the results. Williams later wrote &quot;I&#x27;m really proud of the work and the only thing I&#x27;ve ever doubted is the choice of using adult voices. Perhaps, I should have given the kids a chance to sing the songs.&quot; Parker also commented: &quot;Watching the film after all these years, this is one aspect that I find the most bizarre. Adult voices coming out of these kids&#x27; mouths? I had told Paul that I didn&#x27;t want squeaky kids&#x27; voices and he interpreted this in his own way. Anyway, as the tapes arrived, scarcely weeks away from filming, we had no choice but to go along with it!&quot;

The film soundtrack album was originally released as an LP in 1976. In March 1996, Polydor UK released the soundtrack on CD.

Performers include Paul Williams, Archie Hahn, Julie McWhirter, and Liberty Williams.

===Filming===
The film was rehearsed and shot in the United Kingdom, largely on Pinewood Studios&#x27; &quot;H&quot; stage, with locations in Black Park Country Park (Wexham, Buckinghamshire) and primarily the former Huntley &amp; Palmers buildings in Reading, Berkshire.

The &quot;splurge firearm&quot; proved to be problematic. After initial experiments with cream-filled wax balls proved painful, Parker decided to abandon the idea of filming the firearms directly. Instead, the firearms fired ping-pong balls, and a fast cut to a victim being pelted with &quot;splurge&quot; was used to convey the impression of the rapid-firing firearms.

Baio later said making the film was &quot;awesome&quot;:

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; holds a score of 79% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 6.50/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Delightfully bizarre, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; harnesses immense charm from its cast of child actors playing wise guys with precocious pluck.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 71 based on seven reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

====British critics====
Among British reviewers, Patrick Gibbs of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described the film as &quot;entertainment of considerable originality and polish.&quot; Arthur Thirkell of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; applauded Foster&#x27;s performance and called &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; &quot;one of the most delightfully professional films to hit the screen in the last decade.&quot; Alexander Walker of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; called it &quot;an impossible film to categorise—but a wholly fresh, inventive, enjoyable experience to view. It has taste, shape, melody, infinite affection for its period props—and a joyously spunky reading by the kids of its period stereotypes.&quot; Russell Davies of &quot;The Observer&quot; said that &quot;the performance he has coaxed from Scott Baio in the title role is particularly remarkable; the lad catches a consistently honest, unflashy diffidence that is the very essence of that traditional figure in American mythology, the average guy. whom the ladies go for.&quot; David Castell of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; said that &quot;all W.C. Fields-like prejudices are left outside this vast adventure playground in which the children conduct themselves with an earnestness and natural dignity that is a delight to watch. The only concession it has been necessary to make is the fairly unobtrusive dubbing in of adult singing voices.&quot; Madeleine Harmsworth of the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; wrote:

Kenneth Baily of &quot;The Sunday People&quot; said that &quot;some may fear that kids glamorised as speak-easy chorus girls and slicked-up as gangsters could turn out a sick joke. The splendid achievement of the film is its wholly good taste and enjoyable entertainment.&quot; Derek Malcolm of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film a more mixed assessment, praising Williams&#x27; music, Parker&#x27;s script and direction and the various performances, while noting that &quot;there are times when the movie loses its way, when the invention sags and when the essential artificiality of the concept becomes apparent.&quot; A review from David Robinson in &quot;The Times&quot; read as follows:

====American critics====
Rex Reed gave the film an exuberantly positive review upon its debut in New York, less than two months later:

Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it &quot;a charming one&quot; with &quot;yet another special performance by Jodie Foster&quot;. Gene Siskel also gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and said that &quot;what makes &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; really worth watching—as opposed to being just a cute idea—are the fine performers, terrific choreography, catchy songs, and bright photography.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film had &quot;charm, neat acting by an all-youngster cast, a tongue-in-cheek script and dialog, lilting songs, and score&quot;, but that audiences may find it &quot;a bit fragile over its hour-and-a-half duration, and its content and approach just that bit too clever.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;The world that Alan Parker has created in &#x27;Bugsy Malone&#x27; is very peculiar, but he is remarkably successful considering the terrible odds against such a stunt in the first place.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a rare, original, tuneful, lighthearted, charming, and preposterously innocent family film&quot;. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; panned the film as &quot;a freakish embarrassment&quot; and an &quot;icky misconception&quot;, though he singled out Jodie Foster for praise as an actress whose &quot;precociousness is truly extraordinary&quot;. Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;nothing but its godawful idea&quot;, writing &quot;We&#x27;re not watching actors in a story, we&#x27;re watching kids doing a stunt, and so we&#x27;re primed to ooh and aah, the way the audience does for a chimp on the Carson show.&quot; Kathleen Carroll of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; praised the songs, script and performances in her three-star review, but believed the novelty wore thin after a while, and she was also critical of the song dubbing.

===Box office===
&quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; was not a commercial success in the U.S., bringing in just over $2.7 million. Paramount gave it a limited release, usually in second-tier theaters in a double-bill with &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot;, which had been out for six months and was no longer much of a draw. According to Parker, the film was &quot;quite successful&quot; in the United Kingdom. By 1985, it had earned an estimated profit of £1,854,000.

===Accolades===
The film garnered 15 award nominations, including &quot;Best Motion Picture (Musical/Comedy)&quot;, &quot;Best Original Score&quot; and &quot;Best Original Song&quot; (for the title track) from the Golden Globes, and an Oscar for &quot;Best Original Song Score&quot; (Paul Williams). The film was in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival. Jodie Foster received two BAFTAs, &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; and &quot;Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles&quot;, however, both her nominations were for her previous year&#x27;s work in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, in addition to her work on &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;. Alan Parker received the BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay, and a nomination for Best Direction. Geoffrey Kirkland won the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design. Additionally, Paul Williams received a nomination for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and Monica Howe a Best Costume Design nomination. The film received a Best Picture nomination.

==Home media==
In the early 1980s, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; was released on VHS. On 16 April 1996, it was re-released by Paramount on VHS. A region 2 DVD has been available since 2003 and although the film has never been released on Region 1 DVD, it has been available through Internet sites as an Asian import supporting Region 1 (US). On 9 September 2008, Arista/SME released a Blu-ray version, encoded for &quot;all regions&quot;, as a United Kingdom import. This edition includes a director&#x27;s commentary as well as other special features. A new 4K restoration was released as part of the &quot;Paramount Presents&quot; line on 31 August 2021.

==Legacy==
In 2003, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; was voted #19 on a list of the 100 greatest musicals, as chosen by viewers of Channel 4 in the UK, placing it higher than &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Cats&quot;, and &quot;The King and I&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; was voted 39th on a list of the 100 greatest family films (also compiled by Channel 4) ahead of &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and behind &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;. &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; ranks 353rd on &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.

A 2003 television documentary called &quot;Bugsy Malone: After They Were Famous&quot; features a reunion and interviews with Jodie Foster, Scott Baio, John Cassisi, and Florrie Dugger. The British actors who played Fat Sam&#x27;s gang are also reunited at Pinewood Studios. The documentary reported that Dugger, who (unlike her co-stars) had never acted again, had chosen to pursue a career in the United States Air Force Medical Service.

In 2010, UK band Silvery included a cover of &quot;You Give a Little Love&quot; on their second album &quot;Railway Architecture&quot;, and Olly Murs, runner-up in the 2009 UK series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, sampled &quot;So You Wanna Be a Boxer&quot; in his song &quot;Hold On&quot; that can be found on his debut album.

In 2011, the film was the most screened film in secondary schools in the United Kingdom.

In 2017, the song &quot;You Give a Little Love&quot; was sung by a children&#x27;s chorus at the end of a Netflix &quot;Black Mirror&quot; episode (Season 4 Episode 3 &quot;Crocodile&quot;).

Sometime in the 2000s, Coca-Cola Ltd. (Canada) made an animated ad using &quot;You Give a Little Love&quot; that was only screened in movie theaters before any trailers.

The song &quot;Ordinary Fool&quot; has been covered by numerous artists including Ella Fitzgerald and The Carpenters.

In 2024, Morrisons released their Christmas ad featuring oven gloves singing &quot;You Give a Little love&quot;.

===Comic book adaptation===
Graham Thompson adapted the film into a 1976 comic book, which was only released in the United Kingdom.

==Stage adaptation==
Parker wrote the book for a stage adaptation of &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;, using Williams&#x27; music. This premiered in the West End in 1983 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre and ran for 300 performances. It was directed by Michael Dolenz and the cast featured Catherine Zeta-Jones as Tallulah. Unlike the film version, the young cast perform their own songs rather than being dubbed by adult voices. In 1997, the National Youth Music Theatre mounted an all-youth version at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, starring Sheridan Smith and Jamie Bell. Another revival played in 2015 and again in 2016 at the Lyric Hammersmith, where it was nominated for the Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival. The Lyric Hammersmith production toured the UK from July 2022, before a Christmas run at Alexandra Palace in London.

The only cast recording of the stage show released to date is by the National Youth Music Theatre, released in 1998. This includes all the songs featured in the film and two new songs written by Williams: &quot;That&#x27;s Why They Call Him Dandy&quot; and &quot;Show Business&quot;. There is also some additional incidental orchestral score, such as an &quot;Overture&quot; and &quot;Exit Music&quot;, with music arranged by John Pearson. The recording features a young Sheridan Smith as Tallulah. As the film version dubbed the songs with adult voices, this is the only released version with the songs performed by children and young adults.

<text>The Arabah/Araba () or Aravah/Arava () is a loosely defined geographic area in the Negev Desert, south of the Dead Sea basin, which forms part of the border between Israel to the west and Jordan to the east.

The old meaning, which was in use up to around the early 20th century, covered almost the entire length of what today is called the Jordan Rift Valley, running in a north–south orientation between the southern end of the Sea of Galilee and the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba of the Red Sea at Aqaba–Eilat. This included the Jordan River Valley between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, the Dead Sea itself, and what today is commonly called the Arava Valley. The contemporary use of the term is restricted to this southern section alone.

==Geography==
The Arabah is in length, from the Gulf of Aqaba to the southern shore of the Dead Sea.

Topographically, the region is divided into three sections. From the Gulf of Aqaba northward, the land gradually rises over a distance of , and reaches a height of above sea level, which represents the watershed divide between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea. From this crest, the land slopes gently northward over the next to a point south of the Dead Sea. In the last section, the Arabah drops steeply to the Dead Sea, which is below sea level.

The Arabah is scenic with colorful cliffs and sharp-topped mountains. The southern Arabah is hot and dry and virtually without rain.

==Flora and fauna==
There are numerous species of flora and fauna in the Aravah Valley. Notably the caracal (&quot;Caracal caracal&quot;) is found on the valley&#x27;s savanna areas.

===Important Bird Areas===
A tract of the northern Arava Valley, from the Ne&#x27;ot Hakikar Nature Reserve in the north to the Hazeva and Shezaf Nature Reserve in the south, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of both resident and migrating bird species, including sand partridges, garganeys, common cranes, black and white storks, Eurasian spoonbills and bitterns, black-winged stilts, desert tawny owls, lappet-faced vultures, Levant sparrowhawks, sooty falcons, Arabian warblers and babblers, Tristram&#x27;s starlings, hooded wheatears and Dead Sea sparrows.
Furthermore, a tract of the southern Arava Valley, from Yotvata in the north to the Gulf of Aqaba in the south, including the western (Israeli) half of the valley floor and the ridge of the Eilat Mountains, has also been recognised as an IBA, with additional significant species being Lichtenstein&#x27;s sandgrouse, grey herons, great white pelicans, slender-billed curlews, marsh sandpipers, black-winged pratincoles, white-eyed gulls, white-winged terns, pallid scops owls, European honey buzzards, Egyptian vultures, eastern imperial eagles, lesser kestrels, lanner falcons, Arabian larks, Sinai rosefinches and cinereous buntings. On the eastern (Jordanian) side of the southern Arava Valley is the corresponding, , Wadi Araba IBA, about long by up to wide. An additional species recorded there is the vulnerable MacQueen&#x27;s bustard, in very small numbers.

==History==
===Bronze and Iron Ages; Nabatean period===
In the Bronze and Iron Ages, the Arava was a center of copper production. King Solomon is reported in the Hebrew Bible to have had mines in this area. Copper mining at the Ashalim site predates his reign in the 10th century BCE. The Arabah, especially its eastern part, was part of the realm of the Edomites (called &quot;Idumeans&quot; during Hellenistic and Roman times). Later the eastern Arabah became the domain of the Nabateans, the builders of the city of Petra.

====Archaeology: Kingdom of Edom====
The existence of the biblical Kingdom of Edom was proved by archaeologists led by Erez Ben-Yosef and Tom Levy, using a methodology called the punctuated equilibrium model in 2019. Archaeologists mainly took copper samples from the Timna Valley and Faynan in Jordan&#x27;s Arava valley dated to 1300–800 BCE. According to the results of the analyses, the researchers thought that Pharaoh Shoshenk I of Egypt (the Biblical &quot;Shishak&quot;), who attacked Jerusalem in the 10th century BC, encouraged trade and production of copper instead of destroying the region. Tel Aviv University professor Ben-Yosef reported, &quot;Our new findings contradict the view of many archaeologists that the Arava was populated by a loose alliance of tribes, and they&#x27;re consistent with the biblical story that there was an Edomite kingdom here&quot;.

===Israel and Jordan, 20th-21st c.===
The Israel–Jordan Peace Treaty was signed in the Arava on October 26, 1994. The governments of Jordan and Israel are promoting development of the region. There is a plan to bring sea water from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea through a canal (Red–Dead Seas Canal), which follows along the Arabah. This (long envisioned) project was once an issue of dispute between Jordan and Israel, but it was recently agreed that the project shall be constructed on and by the Jordanian side.

==Population and localities==
===Israel===
====Demography====
The Israeli population of the region is 52,000, of whom 47,500 live in Eilat (52,753 in 2021), and just over 5,000 live in 20 small towns north of Eilat, the largest of which is Yotvata, with a population (as of 2019) of 717 (735 in 2021). Eilat is a city, while all other towns are communal settlements of the kibbutz, moshav and community settlement type.

====Localities====
Below is a list of Israeli localities in the Arava, from north to south. They belong to one city council, Eilat, and three regional councils: Tamar (a), Central Arava (b), and Hevel Eilot (c), all part of the Southern District.

===Jordan===
====Demography====
The total Jordanian population in the region is 103,000, of whom 96,000 live in Aqaba (95,048 as of 2021).

In 2004, the Jordanian administrative district of Wadi Araba had a population of 6,775.

Five major Bedouin tribes comprise eight settlements on the Jordanian side: Al-S&#x27;eediyeen (), Al-Ihewat (), Al-Ammareen/Amareen (; see also Palestinian Bedouin), Al-Rashaideh/Rashaydeh (; see also Palestinian Bedouin), and Al-Azazmeh (), as well as smaller tribes of the Al-Oseifat (), Al-Rawajfeh (), Al-Manaja&#x27;h (), and Al-Marzaqa (), among others. The main economic activities for these Arabah residents revolve around herding sheep, agriculture, handicrafts, and serving in the Jordanian Army.

====Localities====
Below is a list of Jordanian population clusters in Wadi Araba:

*Aqaba
*Feifa
*Safi
*Al Mazraa

==Landmarks==

Timna Valley Park is notable for its prehistoric rock carvings, some of the oldest copper mines in the world, and a convoluted cliff called King Solomon&#x27;s pillars. On the Jordanian side is Wadi Rum, famous among rock climbers, hikers, campers, and lovers of the outdoors. There is the Jordanian copper mining area of Wadi Feynan, including the site of Khirbat en-Nahas, corresponding to the one from Timna Valley in the west.

Feynan Ecolodge was opened in Wadi Feynan by the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature in 2005.

<text>In German folklore, a Wolpertinger (, also called Wolperdinger or Woiperdinger) is an animal said to inhabit the alpine forests of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg in Southern Germany.

== Origins ==
Images of creatures that may be Wolpertingers have been found in woodcuts and engravings dating back to the 17th century, though they might be images of rabbits infected by the Shope papilloma virus. The origin of the name is unclear, but may come from glassmakers from the village of Wolterdingen who made schnapps glasses shaped like animals, which they called &quot;Wolterdinger.&quot; The Wolpertinger myth has increased in popularity over the past two centuries because of taxidermies created Bavarian taxidermists in the 1800s for fun and to sell to tourists as &quot;local wildlife.&quot;

==Description==
It has a body comprising various animal parts – generally wings, antlers, a tail, and fangs; all attached to the body of a small mammal. The most widespread description portrays the Wolpertinger as having the head of a rabbit, the body of a squirrel, the antlers of a deer, and the wings and occasionally the legs of a pheasant. No two Wolpertinger look alike because they are supposed the result of crossbreeding between animals in the area such as foxes, roebucks, hares, ducks, and pheasants.

According to folklore, Wolpertingers can be found in the forests of Bavaria. The folklore states that Wolpertingers only show themselves to beautiful maidens on a full moon if they are taken into secluded parts of the Bavarian forests by the right man.

Stuffed &quot;Wolpertingers&quot;, composed of parts of real animals that have been stuffed, are often displayed in inns or sold to tourists as souvenirs in the animal&#x27;s &quot;native regions&quot;. The Deutsches Jagd- und Fischereimuseum in Munich, Germany features a permanent exhibit on the creature.

It resembles other creatures from German folklore, such as the &quot;Rasselbock&quot; of the Thuringian Forest, the Dilldapp of the Alemannic region, and the &quot;Elwedritsche&quot; of the Palatinate region, which accounts describe as a chicken-like creature with antlers; additionally, the American Jackalope as well as the Swedish Skvader somewhat resemble the wolpertinger. The Austrian counterpart of the Wolpertinger is the Raurakl.

Variant regional spellings of the name include Wolperdinger, Woipertingers, and Volpertinger. They are part of a larger family of horned mammals that exist throughout the Germanic regions of Europe, such as the Austrian Raurackl, which is nearly identical to the German Wolpertinger.

==In popular culture==
* Rumo, a &#x27;Wolperting&#x27; is the main character of the novel &quot;Rumo and His Miraculous Adventures&quot; by Walter Moers, depicted as an anthropomorphic dog with horns.
* Wolpertingers are available as pets in World of Warcraft during special events.

<text>The National Bank of Greece (NBG; ) is a banking and financial services company with its headquarters in Athens, Greece. Founded in 1841 as the newly independent country&#x27;s first financial institution, it has long been the largest Greek bank, a position it still held in the early 21st century. Following the financial turmoil of the Greek government-debt crisis in the 2010s, it remains one of Greece&#x27;s four dominant banks together with Alpha Bank, Eurobank Ergasias, and Piraeus Bank. It has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank. NBG offers financial products and services for corporate and institutional clients along with private and business customers. Services include banking services, brokerage, insurance, asset management, shipping finance, leasing and factoring markets. 

The National Bank of Greece was Greece&#x27;s dominant bank of issue from 1842 to 1928. As a consequence of Greece&#x27;s territorial expansion, it shared the issuance privilege on a local basis with the Ionian Bank in the Ionian Islands between 1864 and 1920, with the Privileged Bank of Epirothessaly in those regions between 1882 and 1899, and with the Bank of Crete in Crete between 1899 and 1919. In 1920, it recovered its original issuance monopoly following its acquisition of the Bank of Crete and revocation of the Ionian Bank&#x27;s note-issuance privilege. That monopoly was transferred in 1928 to the Bank of Greece, newly established as the country&#x27;s central bank under oversight of the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations. 

NBG has been listed on the Athens Stock Exchange since the latter&#x27;s founding in 1880, and was also listed on the New York Stock Exchange from 1999 to 2015.(NYSE:NBG, ADR, ISIN US6336437057). Its development has included major acquisitions such as those of the Privileged Bank of Epirothessaly in 1899, the Bank of Crete in 1919, and the Bank of Athens in 1953.

==History==


===19th century===

The bankers Jean-Gabriel Eynard and Georgios Stavros founded NBG in 1841 as a commercial bank. Stavros was also elected as the first director of the Bank until his death in 1869. The bank&#x27;s creation was acknowledged by the decree &quot;On the establishment of (a) National Bank&quot; (Official Gazette, no. 6 March 30, 1841, p. 59), according to which the National Bank is a private limited company based in Athens with a capital of 5,000,000 drachmas, divided into 5,000 shares of 1,000 drachmas. It was the first bank in the Modern Greek state&#x27;s history. (The Ionian Bank was established in 1838 but only started operations in 1842 and initially operated only in the United States of the Ionian Islands, a separate polity at the time.)

At its founding the major shareholder of the National Bank was the Greek state with 1,000 shares out of 3,402. Other major shareholders were Nicholas Zosimas with 500 shares, Jean-Gabriel Eynard with 300 shares, King Louis of Bavaria with 200 shares, Konstantinos Vranis with 150 shares, Adolf Graf with 146 shares and Theodoros Rallis with 100 shares. Rothshild Frères Paris bought 50 shares and Jean-Gabriel Eynard bought another 50 shares in their name to boost the prestige of the new bank. It used to have the sole right of note issue, which it lost in 1928 when the newly established Bank of Greece took over as the country&#x27;s central bank. In 1880, NBG was listed in the Athenas Stock Exchange. In 1899, NBG acquired the Privileged Bank of Epirothessaly.


===20th century===

The arrival of the 20th Century saw NBG begin its international expansion. In 1904 NBG established the Banque d&#x27;Orient as a joint venture with Nationalbank für Deutschland, which soon withdrew from the venture and sold the branches in Constantinople and Hamburg. The Banque d&#x27;Orient kept its branches in Salonica and Smyrna, which were part of the Ottoman Empire at the time, and Alexandria in Egypt. Three years later, NBG established a first overseas branch of its own in Cyprus. NBG became government-owned during the First World War when NBG refused to finance new military equipment for the Greek government. The government then passed a law that permitted the government to appoint its own people to the Bank&#x27;s board.

In 1919 NBG acquired the Bank of Crete (Trapeza Kritis). However, in 1923 the Treaty of Lausanne provided for a compulsory exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, leading to the departure of the Greeks from Smyrna. As a result, Banque d&#x27;Orient closed its branch there. The influx of more than 1 million refugees to Greece during this period created several challenges; NBG played a pivotal role in their settlement with loans and related instruments.

The 1930s saw further international expansion. In 1930 NBG and Bank of Athens combined their activities in Egypt into a joint subsidiary, Banque Nationale de Grèce et d&#x27;Athènes. Two years later, NBG acquired full ownership of the Banque d&#x27;Orient. Then in 1939, on the eve of the Second World War, the NBG established a subsidiary in New York City, the &quot;Hellenic Bank Trust Company&quot;. Throughout the interwar period, the NBG was widely viewed as representing British capital in Greece, not least through its longstanding association with London-based Hambros Bank, whereas its smaller competitor the Bank of Athens was perceived as aligned with French interests.

In 1941, during the Axis Occupation of Greece, Deutsche Bank assumed oversight of the bank, which entailed operational control even though it did not technically take over its shares out of consideration for Italian sensitivities.
In 1953 the NBG took over the Bank of Athens, which was at that time the second largest Bank in Greece. Both banks cooperated before in their foreign branches in Middle East which were operated as &quot;Banque Nationale de Grèce et d&#x27;Athènes&quot;. The NBG took over also the affiliated &quot;South African Bank of Athens&quot; (est. 1947). The former headquarters of the Bank of Athens are also still used until today. In 1960 Egypt nationalised all banks in Egypt, including Banque Nationale de Grèce et d&#x27;Athènes, which it merged into National Bank of Egypt.

In 1965 NBG acquired the Greek &quot;Trapeza Epagelmatikis Pistis&quot; (Professional Credit Bank). The next year bank governor Georgios Mavros founded the Cultural Foundation of the National Bank. In 1978 the Greek government permitted the formation of Arab Hellenic Bank with 49% Arab ownership, as an exception to its prohibition on foreign banks owning more than 40% of the equity of a Greek bank. NBG held 51% and provided most of the bank staff. The Libyan Arab-Foreign Bank and Kuwaiti Investment Organisation held 40% between them while other Arab investors held 9%. That same year NBG opened again a branch in Cairo. In 1994 NBG incorporated its branches in Cyprus into a subsidiary: National Bank of Greece (Cyprus). The next year the Greek government dissolved the insolvent Arab Hellenic Bank at a cost to Greece&#x27;s Deposit Guarantee Fund of €1.5 million in payments to depositors. In 1998 the Swiss architect Mario Botta won the competition for the new wing of the headquarters, the building was completed in 2001. In 1998 NBG merged with the &quot;Ethniki Ktimatiki Trapeza Ellados&quot; (National Mortgage Bank of Greece), itself the result of the merger of the &quot;National Mortgage Bank&quot; and the &quot;National Housing Bank of Greece&quot;. In 1999 NBG started trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

===21st century===
After the end of communism in Eastern Europe, NBG took advantage of the opportunity to expand to Southeast Europe. In April 2000, in a joint deal with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and IFC, NBG acquired a majority stake in Stopanska Banka (Skopje, North Macedonia). In July, National Bank of Greece acquired 89.9% of the United Bulgarian Bank (UBB).

In 2002 NBG merged with &quot;ETEBA&quot; (National Investment Bank for Industrial Development), but NBG&#x27;s attempted merger with Alpha Bank fell through. The next year, NBG bought Banca Romaneasca, a Romanian bank, and currently holds 88.7% of all outstanding shares. Banca Romaneasca has 90 branches.

However, while it was expanding to Southeast Europe, NBG was retreating in North America and other places serving the Greek diaspora. The first move occurred in 2005 when NBG sold all its operations in Canada to Bank of Nova Scotia. The next year NBG sold its US arm, Atlantic Bank of New York, to New York Community Bancorp for US$400 million (€331 million) in cash. It then used proceeds from the sale to help finance further acquisitions in southeast Europe. In 2004 the Institute for Corporate Culture Affairs was founded by NBG and Deutsche Bank as not-for-profit institute based in Frankfurt.

In 2006 NBG acquired 46% of the shares of Finansbank in Turkey, a share that it increased in 2007 to 80%. Hüsnü Özyeğin reported in the initial press conference when NBG announced its 46% share purchase that he would have &quot;loved to have been offered National Bank of Greece shares instead of cash, however there were no shares available&quot; (outside of the current shares floated in the free market). Still in 2006, NBG acquired 99.44% of Serbia&#x27;s Vojvođanska banka for €385 million.

At home, in 2005, as part of the NBG Group&#x27;s ongoing effort to improve its portfolio structure and effectively respond to changes in the domestic and international markets, the Boards of Directors of National Bank of Greece S.A. and National Investment Company S.A. decided to merge the two companies through absorption of the latter by the Bank. Two years later, NBG merged with &quot;National Management &amp; Organization Co.&quot; (the issuer of &quot;Ethnokarta&quot;). At the time, NBG already held 100% of National Management &amp; Organization Co. shares. Also in 2007, NBG concluded the acquisition of &quot;P&amp;K Investment Services SA&quot;. The acquisition created the largest provider of brokerage and investment services in Greece. NBG plans to expand this business to all countries where NBG has a presence.

The bank suffered following the Greek government debt crisis holding part of the debt. The bank wrote off more than $19 billion; €10 billion ($12.7 billion) of it in the restructuring of the debt.

On 18 February 2011 NBG made an offer to buy Alpha Bank for €2.8 billion. and another offer to buy Emporiki Bank, both offers were not successful, Emporiki Bank was then bought by Alpha Bank.

In January 2013 NBG made an offer to take over the Eurobank Ergasias this was not completed. The 64,000 Eurobank shareholders and the Greek capital market commission agreed. Some weeks after the proposed buyout that fell through, NBG presented the plans to reduce the staff of the new banking group, many of them by taking early retirement. The merger was criticized, as some said that the new bank would be too big if it had to be sold, but one of the bankers said that much bigger banks have been sold. The NBG absorbed the healthy assets and liabilities of the Greek FBBank in 2013. The European Commission in July 2014 approved restructuring plans for NBG after finding that state aid was not hampering competition.

On 28 November 2015, the New York Stock Exchange announced that American depositary receipts (&quot;ADRs&quot;) of National Bank of Greece S.A. were in the process of being delisted following a 14% value decline on Friday 27 November 2015 and a year-to-date slump of 91%. While the year-to-date plunge of 91% was a major factor, the exchange stated that the National Bank of Greece is no longer suitable for listing based on &quot;abnormally low&quot; prices of the ADRs, pursuant to Section 802.01D of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Also, the bank failed to meet the trading standards and also failed to cross the $1.00 mark since mid-July, resulting in the NYSE&#x27;s determination to delist the bank&#x27;s ADRs.

On 4 December 2015, the European Commission approved state aid amounting to €2.71 billion.

In December 2015, the bank announced it would sell Turkish subsidiary Finansbank to the Qatari QNB Group, in order to pay down its expensive central bank debt. Including €910 million of subordinate debt, a sum of €2.75 billion in cash was agreed upon. In 2015 National Bank of Greece announced it would sell NBGI Private Equity. In September 2016, the transaction of selling it funds to Stage Capital was completed.

In March 2017, the bank entered into an agreement to sell its South African subsidiary South African Bank of Athens to AFGRI Holdings. The sale was completed in October 2018. The bank was renamed GroBank.

National Bank of Greece has faced bad loans due to the debt crisis in the country and has opted for securitizations projects since 2020. In February 2020, NBG announced the project Frontier, which consisted of the securitization of non-performing loans. NBG&#x27;s Frontier portfolio is composed of more than 6.0 billion euros of non-performing mortgages, small and medium-sized business loans, as customer loans. In June 2020, NGB hired Morgan Stanley to advise on bad debt sales.

In March 2021, NGB announced the project Frontier 2 for reducing the non-performing credit exposure ratio from 13.6 percent to 6-7 percent. National Bank of Greece&#x27;s impaired loans fell to 4.2 billion euros in the first quarter of 2021. In July 2021, NBG picked DoValue, Bain Capital and Fortress as preferred bidders on bad loans sale.

In November 2023, the HFSF reduced its stake in NBG from 40.39% to 20,39%, as part of a broader re-privatization of Greek lenders bailed-out during the crisis. In october 2024, the HFSF sold a 10% stake in NGB and will transfer its remaining 8.4% stake in National Bank to Greece’s sovereign wealth fund by the end of 2024.

<text>Richard E. Grant (born Richard Grant Esterhuysen; 5 May 1957) is a Swaziland-born English actor and presenter. He made his film debut as Withnail in the comedy &quot;Withnail and I&quot; (1987). Grant received critical acclaim for his role as Jack Hock in Marielle Heller&#x27;s drama film &quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&quot; (2018), winning various awards including the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male. He also received Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor.

Grant is also known for his roles in the feature films &quot;Warlock&quot; (1989), &quot;Henry &amp; June&quot; (1990), &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; (1991), &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992), &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993), &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1996), &quot;The Little Vampire&quot; (2000), &quot;Gosford Park&quot; (2001), &quot;Penelope&quot; (2006), &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; (2011), &quot;Jackie&quot; (2016), &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), and &quot;Saltburn&quot; (2023). He is also known for his roles in television, including &quot;Frasier&quot; (2004), &quot;Dig&quot; (2015), &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (2016), &quot;Hang Ups&quot; (2018), &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; (2019), and &quot;Suspect&quot; (2022).

==Early life and education==
Grant was born as Richard Grant Esterhuysen on 5 May 1957 in Mbabane, Protectorate of Swaziland (now the Kingdom of Eswatini). He is the elder child of Henrik Esterhuysen and Leonne Esterhuysen. Henrik Esterhuysen was head of education for the British government administration in the British protectorate of Swaziland. Grant has English, Dutch/Afrikaner, and German ancestry. He has a younger brother, Stuart, an accountant in Johannesburg, from whom he is estranged; Grant has stated that they &quot;never had any relationship&quot;.

As a boy, Grant attended St Mark&#x27;s School, a local government school in Mbabane, which had only recently become racially integrated. When Grant was 10, he witnessed, sitting in the back seat, his mother commit adultery in a car with his father&#x27;s best friend, which subsequently led to his parents&#x27; divorce. This event inspired Grant to keep a daily diary, which he has continued to do ever since.

Grant attended secondary school at Waterford Kamhlaba United World College of Southern Africa, an independent school near Mbabane. In May 1976, he arrived at the University of Cape Town to study English and drama. He adopted his stage name (truncating his Afrikaans-sounding surname to a single letter) when he moved to Britain in 1982, a year after his father&#x27;s death, and registered with Equity.

==Career==
Grant was a member of the Space Theatre Company in Cape Town before moving to London in 1982. He later stated, &quot;I grew up in Swaziland when it was mired in a 1960s sensibility. The kind of English spoken where I grew up was a period English sound and when I came to England people said, &#x27;how strange&#x27;. Charles Sturridge, who directed &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; for TV, said, &quot;you speak English like someone from the 1950s.&quot;

Grant&#x27;s first film role was the perpetually inebriated title character in the cult classic &quot;Withnail and I&quot; (1987). Following this, he started appearing in Hollywood films, taking on a range of projects from blockbuster studio movies to small independent projects. Since then, Grant has had supporting roles in the films &quot;Henry &amp; June&quot;, &quot;L.A. Story&quot;, &quot;The Player&quot;, &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;, &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;, &quot;Spice World&quot;, &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, &quot;Bright Young Things&quot;, and &quot;Penelope&quot;.

While filming &quot;L.A. Story&quot; with Steve Martin, the pair communicated by fax. Martin wrote: &quot;I kept these faxes, which grew to a stack more than 2 inches thick, because they entertained me, and because I thought they were valuable aesthetic chunks from a screeching mind, a stream-of-consciousness faucet spewing sentences – sometimes a mile long – none of it rewritten, and bearing just the right amount of acid and alkaline.&quot;

In 1995, Grant starred as the titular character in Peter Capaldi&#x27;s short film &quot;Franz Kafka&#x27;s It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;. The film won the 1995 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. In 1996, he portrayed Sir Andrew Aguecheek in Trevor Nunn&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night.&quot; He released a single and accompanying video &quot;To Be Or Not To Be&quot; with Orpheus in 1997.

Grant has twice portrayed the Doctor from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, both outside the main continuity. In the comedy sketch &quot;Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death&quot;, he portrayed a version of the Tenth Doctor, referred to as the &quot;Quite Handsome Doctor.&quot; He also voiced a version of the Ninth Doctor for the BBC original animated webcast &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot;. The latter had intended to be the official Ninth Doctor prior to the revival of the TV series. His version of the Doctor also appeared as a projection in &quot;Rogue&quot; (2024), during a sequence in which the faces of the Fifteenth Doctor&#x27;s previous incarnations were shown floating around his head. He made his first official &quot;Doctor Who&quot; appearance in the 2012 Christmas special, titled &quot;The Snowmen&quot;, in which he plays the villain, Walter Simeon. During the episode, Simeon is erased from his body and it is taken over by the Great Intelligence, voiced by Ian McKellen in the episode until the takeover. Grant reprised the role in &quot;The Bells of Saint John&quot; and in the Series 7 finale, &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;.
Grant appeared as &quot;The Voice&quot; in &quot;2+2+2&quot; at &quot;American Nights at The King&#x27;s Head Theatre&quot;, from 3 to 29 July 2007, and in 2008 co-starred in the London-based comedy &quot;Filth and Wisdom&quot;. Grant presented the 2008 Laurence Olivier Awards. In 2008, he made his musical theatre debut with Opera Australia, playing the role of Henry Higgins in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, a role he reprised in 2017 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. In 2009, Grant played Alain Reille in Yasmina Reza&#x27;s one-act play &quot;God of Carnage&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Bath, and subsequently at Cheltenham, Canterbury, Richmond, Brighton, and Milton Keynes.

In 2010 he starred in short film &quot;The Man Who Married Himself&quot;, which won Best Comedy at LA International Shorts Festival and Rhode Island Film Festival. Later that year, he made an appearance in a music video, when short-lived Bristol band The Chemists hired him to appear in their video for &quot;This City&quot;; the band split the same year. This appearance followed Grant&#x27;s involvement with the band the previous year, in which he spoke the lyrics to &quot;This City&quot; to background music as part of the intro and outro tracks on their only album, &quot;Theories of Dr Lovelock&quot;.
In March 2013, Grant starred as intelligence analyst Brian Jones in David Morley&#x27;s radio drama &quot;The Iraq Dossier&quot; with Peter Firth, Anton Lesser, David Caves, and Lindsay Duncan. It recounted the story of how British Ministry of Defence Intelligence expert Jones had tried to warn that his government&#x27;s September Dossier on Iraq&#x27;s Weapons of Mass Destruction was inaccurate. In 2014, Grant was cast on the HBO series &quot;Girls&quot; after series creator Lena Dunham saw him in &quot;Spice World&quot;.

On 9 May 2015, Grant gave a reading at VE Day 70: A Party to Remember in Horse Guards Parade, London. In 2016 he joined the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; in Season 6 as Izembaro. In 2017, he appeared as the villainous corporate scientist Zander Rice in Logan.

Grant&#x27;s critically lauded performance as Jack Hock in &quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&quot; (2018) earned him Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. The part also won Grant a New York Film Critics Circle Award and several other critics awards.

In 2019, Grant appeared in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;. In March 2020, Grant joined the cast of the Disney+ / Marvel Cinematic Universe series &quot;Loki&quot; as Classic Loki, an older variant of Loki. Grant portrays Sir Walter Elliot in Carrie Cracknell&#x27;s 2022 adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Persuasion&quot;. The film was released 15 July 2022 on Netflix. In 2023 he was cast in Emerald Fennell&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Saltburn&quot; opposite Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, and Rosamund Pike.

===&quot;Wah-Wah&quot;===
Grant wrote and directed the 2005 film &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;, loosely based on his own childhood experiences. A screenwriter recommended he write a screenplay after reading Grant&#x27;s memoirs of his &quot;Withnail and I&quot; experience. The film took him over seven years to complete and starred Nicholas Hoult in the lead role, with Gabriel Byrne, Miranda Richardson, Julie Walters, and Emily Watson. Grant kept a diary of the experience, later published as a book (&quot;The Wah-Wah Diaries&quot;). The book received positive reviews from critics, many of whom were impressed by the honesty of the tale, especially in regard to his difficult relationship with the &quot;inexperienced&quot; producer Marie-Castille Mention-Schaar.

Grant stated in subsequent interviews that she was a &quot;control freak out of control&quot;, and he would &quot;never see her again as long as [he] live[s].&quot; In a BBC interview, he again mentioned his &quot;disastrous&quot; relationship with Mention-Schaar. He related that he had received only five emails from her in the last two months of pre-production, and that she rarely turned up on the set at all. She failed to obtain clearance firstly for song rights and secondly to film in Swaziland. For the last infraction, Grant was eventually forced to meet with the King of Eswatini to seek clemency. During an interview with an Australian chat show, he mentioned that &quot;Wah-Wah&quot; was not released in France, and as a result, his producer did not make money out of it.

==Personal life==

Grant married voice coach Joan Washington in 1986 and had two daughters with her, Tiffany who lived for only half an hour and Olivia, and a stepson, Tom. After being diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, Washington died on 2 September 2021.

Grant abstains from drinking alcohol, as he has an alcohol intolerance. If he does drink alcohol he is violently sick for up to 24 hours. After casting him as the alcoholic Withnail, director Bruce Robinson made Grant drink a bottle of champagne and half a bottle of vodka during the course of a night so he could experience drunkenness.

Grant is a fan of Barbra Streisand and has done a tour of Streisand&#x27;s New York, visiting her early home, her high school, and the Village Vanguard, among other places.

Grant is a dual citizen of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and the United Kingdom. He is fluent in Swazi, the national language of the country. He used to wear a watch on each wrist, one of which was given to him by his dying father and set to Swaziland time.

In 2008, Grant told &quot;The Times&quot; that he is an atheist. He is an avid supporter of Premier League football club West Ham United. In April 2014, Grant launched his new unisex perfume, JACK, exclusively at Liberty of Regent Street, London. Grant runs the perfume business in collaboration with his daughter.

In 2022, Grant released a memoir, &quot;A Pocketful of Happiness&quot;, mostly written in the last year of his wife&#x27;s life.

<text>The McDonnell Aircraft Corporation was an American aerospace manufacturer based in St. Louis, Missouri. The company was founded on July 6, 1939, by James Smith McDonnell, and was best known for its military fighters, including the F-4 Phantom II, and crewed spacecraft including the Mercury capsule and Gemini capsule. McDonnell Aircraft later merged with the Douglas Aircraft Company to form McDonnell Douglas in 1967.

==History==
James McDonnell founded J.S. McDonnell &amp; Associates in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1928 to produce a small aircraft for family use. The economic depression from 1929 ruined his plans and the company collapsed. He went to work for Glenn L. Martin.

He left in 1938 to try again with his own firm, McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, based at St. Louis, Missouri, in 1939. World War II was a major boost to the new company. It grew from 15 employees in 1939 to 5,000 at the end of the war and became a significant aircraft parts producer, and developed the XP-67 Bat fighter prototype. McDonnell also developed the LBD-1 Gargoyle guided missile. McDonnell Aircraft suffered after the war with an end of government orders and a surplus of aircraft, and heavily cut its workforce. The advent of the Korean War helped push McDonnell into a major military fighter supply role.
In 1943, McDonnell began developing jets when they were invited to bid in a US Navy contest and eventually built the successful FH-1 Phantom in the postwar era. The Phantom introduced McDonnell&#x27;s telltale design with engines placed forward under the fuselage and exiting just behind the wing, a layout that was used successfully on the F2H Banshee, F3H Demon, and the F-101 Voodoo. David S. Lewis joined the company as Chief of Aerodynamics in 1946. He led the development of the legendary F-4 Phantom II in 1954, which was introduced into service in 1960. Lewis became Executive Vice President in 1958, and finally became President and Chief Operating Officer in 1962. 

McDonnell made a number of missiles, including the pioneering Gargoyle and unusual ADM-20 Quail, as well as experimenting with hypersonic flight, research that enabled them to gain a substantial share of the NASA projects Mercury and Gemini. The success of the Mercury capsule led the company adopted a new logo features the capsule circling a globe with the motto &quot;First Free Man in Space&quot;. The company was now a major employer, but was having problems. It had almost no civilian business, and was thus vulnerable to any peacetime downturn in procurement.

Meanwhile, Douglas Aircraft was reeling from cash flow problems and development costs. It was also having a hard time meeting demand. The two companies began sounding each other out about a merger in 1963. On paper, they were a good match. Douglas&#x27; civilian business would have been more than enough to allow McDonnell to withstand any downturns in military procurement, while the cash flow from McDonnell&#x27;s military contracts would have given Douglas badly-needed security. Douglas formally accepted McDonnell&#x27;s offer in December 1966, and the two firms officially merged on April 28, 1967, as the McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC). Soon after the merger was announced, McDonnell bought 1.5 million shares of Douglas stock to help Douglas meet &quot;immediate financial requirements&quot;. McDonnell management dominated the merged company. It was based at McDonnell&#x27;s facility in St. Louis, with James McDonnell as chairman and CEO. In 1967, with the merger of McDonnell and Douglas Aircraft, David Lewis, then president of McDonnell, was named chairman of what was called the Douglas Aircraft Division. After managing the turnaround of the division, he returned to St. Louis in 1969 as president of McDonnell Douglas.

McDonnell Douglas later merged with Boeing in August 1997. Boeing&#x27;s defense and space division includes the part purchased from Rockwell (ROK) in 1986 and is based at the former McDonnell facility in St. Louis, and is responsible for defense and space products and services. McDonnell Douglas&#x27; legacy product programs include the F-15 Eagle, AV-8B Harrier II, F/A-18 Hornet, and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.

<doc id="307179" wikidata="Q605165" url="?curid=307179" title="McDonnell XF-85 Goblin">
<text>The McDonnell XF-85 Goblin is an American prototype fighter aircraft conceived during World War II by McDonnell Aircraft. It was intended to deploy from the bomb bay of the Convair B-36 bomber as a parasite fighter. The XF-85&#x27;s intended role was to defend bombers from hostile interceptor aircraft, a need demonstrated during World War II. McDonnell built two prototypes before the Air Force (USAF) terminated the program.

The XF-85 was a response to a USAAF requirement for a fighter to be carried within the Northrop XB-35 and B-36, then under development. This was to address the limited range of existing interceptor aircraft compared to the greater range of new bomber designs. The XF-85 was a diminutive jet aircraft featuring a distinctive potato-shaped fuselage and a forked-tail stabilizer design. The prototypes were built and underwent testing and evaluation in 1948. Flight tests showed promise in the design, but the aircraft&#x27;s performance was inferior to the jet fighters it would have faced in combat, and there were difficulties in docking. The XF-85 was swiftly canceled, and the prototypes were thereafter relegated to museum exhibits. The 1947 successor to the USAAF, the United States Air Force (USAF), continued to examine the concept of parasite aircraft under three related projects following the cancellation: MX-106 &quot;Tip Tow&quot;, FICON, and &quot;Tom-Tom.&quot;

==Design and development==
During World War II, American bombers such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Consolidated B-24 Liberator, and Boeing B-29 Superfortress were protected by long-range escort fighters such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang. These fighters could not match the range of the Northrop B-35 or Convair B-36, the next generation of bombers developed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The development cost for longer-ranged fighters was high, while aerial refueling was still considered risky and technologically difficult. Pilot fatigue had also been a problem during long fighter escort missions in Europe and the Pacific, giving further impetus to innovative approaches.

The USAAF considered a number of different options including the use of remotely piloted vehicles before choosing parasite fighters as the most viable B-36 defense. The concept of a parasite fighter had its origins in 1918, when the Royal Air Force examined the viability of Sopwith Camel parasite fighters operating from their 23-class airships. In the 1930s, the U.S. Navy had a short-lived operational parasite fighter, the Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk, aboard the airships and . Starting in 1931, aircraft designer Vladimir Vakhmistrov conducted experiments in the Soviet Union as part of the Zveno project during which up to five fighters of various types were carried by Polikarpov TB-2 and Tupolev TB-3 bombers. In August 1941, these combinations flew the only combat missions ever undertaken by parasite fighters – TB-3s carrying Polikarpov I-16SPB dive bombers attacked the Cernavodă bridge and Constantsa docks, in Romania. After that attack, the squadron, based in the Crimea, carried out a tactical attack on a bridge over the river Dnieper at Zaporozhye, which had been captured by advancing German troops. Later in World War II, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; experimented with the Messerschmitt Me 328 as a parasite fighter, but problems with its pulsejet engines could not be overcome. Other late-war rocket-powered parasite fighter projects such as the Arado E.381 and Sombold So 344 were unrealized &quot;paper projects&quot;.

On 3 December 1942, the USAAF sent out a Request for Proposals (RfP) for a diminutive piston-engined fighter. By January 1944, the Air Technical Service Command refined the RfP and, in January 1945, the specifications were further revised in MX-472 to specify a jet-powered aircraft. Although a number of aerospace companies studied the feasibility of such aircraft, McDonnell was the only company to submit a proposal to the original 1942 request and later revised requirements. The company&#x27;s Model 27 proposal was completely reworked to meet the new specifications.

The initial concept for the Model 27 was for the fighter to be carried half-exposed under the B-29, B-35, or B-36. The USAAF rejected this proposal, citing increased drag, and hence reduced range for the composite bomber-fighter configuration. On 19 March 1945, McDonnell&#x27;s design team led by Herman D. Barkey, submitted a revised proposal, the extensively redesigned Model 27D. The smaller aircraft had a potato-shaped fuselage, three fork-shaped vertical stabilizers, horizontal stabilizers with a significant dihedral, and 37° swept-back folding wings to allow it to fit in the confines of a bomb bay. The diminutive aircraft measured long; the folding wings spanned . Only a limited fuel supply of was deemed necessary for the specified 30-minute combat endurance. A hook was installed along the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity; in flight, it retracted to lie flat in the upper part of the nose. The aircraft had an empty weight just short of . To save weight, the fighter had no landing gear. During the testing program, a fixed steel skid under the fuselage and spring-steel &quot;runners&quot; at the underside of the wingtips were installed in case of an emergency landing. Despite the cramped quarters, the pilot was provided with a cordite ejection seat, bail-out oxygen bottle, and high-speed ribbon parachute. Four machine guns in the nose made up the aircraft&#x27;s armament.

In service, the parasite fighter would be launched and retrieved by a trapeze. With the trapeze fully extended, the engine would be airstarted and the release from the mother ship was accomplished by the pilot pulling the nose back to disengage from the hook. In recovery, the aircraft would approach the mother ship from underneath and link up with the trapeze using the retractable hook in the aircraft&#x27;s nose. The anticipated production shift would see a mixed B-36 fleet with both &quot;fighter carriers&quot; and bombers employed on missions. There were plans that, from the 24th B-36 onward, provisions would be made to accommodate one XF-85, with a maximum of four per bomber envisioned. Up to 10 percent of the B-36s on order were to be converted to fighter carriers with three or four F-85s instead of a bomb load.
On 9 October 1945, the USAAF signed a letter of intent covering the engineering development for two prototypes (US serial numbers &quot;46-523/4&quot;), although the contract was not finalized until February 1947. After the successful conclusion of two reviews of a wooden mock-up in 1946 and 1947 by USAAF engineering staff, McDonnell constructed two prototypes in late 1947. The Model 27D was re-designated XP-85, but by June 1948, it was changed to XF-85 and given the name &quot;Goblin&quot;. There were plans to acquire 30 production P-85s, but the USAAF took the cautious approach – if test results from the two prototypes were positive, production orders for more than 100 Goblins would be finalized later.

==Operational history==
During wind tunnel testing at Moffett Field, California, the first prototype XF-85 was accidentally dropped from a crane at a height of , causing substantial damage to the forward fuselage, air intake, and lower fuselage. The second prototype had to be substituted for the remainder of the wind tunnel tests and the initial flight tests.

As a production series B-36 was unavailable, all XF-85 flight tests were carried out using a converted EB-29B Superfortress mother ship that had a modified, &quot;cutaway&quot; bomb bay complete with trapeze, front airflow deflector, and an array of camera equipment and instrumentation. Since the EB-29B, named &quot;Monstro&quot;, was smaller than the B-36, the XF-85 would be flight tested half-exposed. To load the XF-85 into the host plane, a special &quot;loading pit&quot; was dug into the tarmac at South Base, Muroc Field, where all the flight tests originated. On 23 July 1948, the XF-85 flew the first of five captive flights, designed to test whether the EB-29B and its parasite fighter could fly &quot;mated&quot;. The XF-85 was carried in a stowed position, but was sometimes tethered and extended into the airstream with the engine off, for the pilot to gain some feel for the aircraft in flight.
McDonnell test pilot Edwin Foresman Schoch was assigned to the project, riding in the XF-85 while it was stowed aboard the EB-29B, before attempting a &quot;free&quot; flight on 23 August 1948. After Schoch was released from the bomber at a height of 20,000 ft (6,000 m), he completed a 10-minute proving flight at speeds between 180 and 250 mph (290–400 km/h), testing controls and maneuverability. When he attempted a hook-up, it became obvious the Goblin was extremely sensitive to the bomber&#x27;s turbulence, as well as being affected by the air cushion created by the two aircraft operating in close proximity. Constant but gentle adjustments of throttle and trim were necessary to overcome the cushioning effect. After three attempts to hook onto the trapeze, Schoch miscalculated his approach and struck the trapeze so violently that the canopy was smashed and ripped free and his helmet and mask were torn off. He saved the prototype by making a belly landing on the reinforced skid at the dry lake bed at Muroc. All flight testing was suspended for seven weeks while the XF-85 was repaired and modified. Schoch used the down period to undertake a series of problem-free dummy dockings with a Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star fighter.

After boosting the trim power by 50 percent, adjusting the aerodynamics, and other modifications, two further mated test flights were carried out before Schoch was able to make a successful release and hookup on 14 October 1948. During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948, Schoch again found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber&#x27;s trapeze, aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85&#x27;s nose. Another forced landing was carried out at Muroc.

With the first prototype&#x27;s repairs completed, it also joined the flight test program, completing captive flights. While in flight, the Goblin was stable, easy to fly, and recoverable from spins, although initial estimates of a 648 mph (1,043 km/h) top speed proved optimistic. The first test flights revealed that turbulence during approach to the B-29 was significant, leading to the addition of upper and lower fins at the extreme rear fuselage, as well as two wingtip fins to compensate for the increased directional instability in docking. All the initial flights had the hook secured in a fixed position, but when the hook was stowed and later raised, the resulting buffeting added to the difficulty in attempting a hookup. To address the problem, small aerodynamic fairings were added to the hook well that reduced the buffeting when the hook was extended and retracted. When testing resumed, on the 18 March 1949 test flight, Schoch continued to have difficulty in hooking up, striking and damaging the trapeze&#x27;s nose-stabilizing section, before resorting to another emergency belly landing. After repairs to the trapeze, Schoch flew the first prototype on 8 April 1949, completing a 30-minute free flight test, but after three attempts, abandoned his efforts and resorted to another belly landing at Muroc.

Aware of the problems revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.

Two main reasons contributed to the cancellation. The XF-85&#x27;s deficiencies revealed in flight testing included a lackluster performance in relation to contemporary jet fighters, and the high demands on pilot skill experienced during docking revealed a critical shortcoming that was never fully corrected. The development of practical aerial refueling for conventional fighters used as bomber escort was also a factor in the cancellation. The two Goblins flew seven times, with a total flight time of 2 hours and 19 minutes with only three of the free flights ending in a hookup. Schoch was the only pilot who ever flew the aircraft.

==Further developments==
Despite cancellation of the XF-85, the USAF continued to examine the concept of parasite aircraft as defensive fighters through a series of projects. These included Project MX-106 &quot;Tip Tow&quot;, Project FICON, and Project &quot;Tom-Tom&quot; – which involved fighter aircraft attached to bomber aircraft by their wingtips. Project FICON (&quot;fighter conveyor&quot;) emerged as an effective Convair GRB-36D and Republic RF-84K Thunderflash combined bomber-reconnaissance-fighter, although the role was changed to that of strategic reconnaissance. Project FICON drew heavily on data from the abortive XF-85 project and closely followed McDonnell&#x27;s recommendations in designing a more refined trapeze. A total of 10 converted B-36s and 25 reconnaissance fighters saw limited service with the Strategic Air Command in 1955–1956, before they were supplemented by more effective aircraft and satellite systems.

==Aircraft on display==

After the program&#x27;s termination, the two XF-85 prototypes were stored, before being surplussed and relegated to museum display in 1950.
* 46-0523 – National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. Following the cancellation of the program, the aircraft was transferred to the museum on 23 August 1950 and was one of the first experimental aircraft to be displayed at the new Air Force Museum. For several decades, the aircraft was displayed alongside the museum&#x27;s Convair B-36. In 2000, the aircraft was moved to the museum&#x27;s Experimental Aircraft Hangar.
* 46-0524 – Strategic Air and Space Museum in Ashland, Nebraska. It was originally transferred to the Norton Air Force Base (near San Bernardino, California) in 1950, still in a damaged state after its last emergency landing. When the base museum was closed and its collection dispersed, the second XF-85 prototype languished in an unrestored condition as part of the Tallmantz private collection in California, until being acquired by Offutt AFB. It is now refurbished and displayed on its ground-handling trestle, nestled under the wing of a B-36J bomber (serial number &quot;52-2217&quot;).

<text>The Horites ( &quot;Ḥōrīm&quot;), were a people mentioned in the Torah (, ) inhabiting areas around Mount Seir in Canaan ().

==Name==
According to Archibald Sayce (1915), the Horites have been identified with references in Egyptian inscriptions to &quot;Khar&quot; (formerly translated as &quot;Harri&quot;), which concern a southern region of Canaan. More recent scholarship has associated them with the Hurrians.

The rabbinical tradition in Genesis Rabbah 42:6 (300-500 CE) says they are called Horites because &quot;they made themselves independent [free]&quot;, which assumes the name is cognate with &quot;ḥori&quot; meaning &quot;free.&quot;

==Hebrew Bible ==
The Horites initially appear in the Torah as being members of a Canaanite coalition, who lived near the Sodom and Gomorrah. The coalition rebelled against Kedorlamer of Elam, who ruled them for twelve years. Kedorlamer attacked and subdued them in response ().

Later, according to , the Horites co-existed and inter-married with the family of Esau, grandson of Abraham through Isaac (). They were eventually brought under the rule of the descendants of Esau, also then known as Edom.

The ancestry of Seir the Horite is not specified. Some say Seir lived around the time of Terah, father of Abraham. He is also said to be a descendant of Hor who is supposed to have lived around the time of Reu and was a descendant of Hivi, son of Canaan son of Ham. 

The pre-Edomite Horite chiefs, descendants of Seir, are listed in the Book of Genesis () and 1 Chronicles (). Two of these chiefs would appear to have been female - Timna and Oholibamah. Timna is infamous for being the progenitor of the Amalekites, the archenemy of the Israelites ().

The chiefs who descended from Esau are listed in .

At some time, certain of these leaders rose to the level of &#x27;kings&#x27; over the other chiefs, and the Horite land became known as Edom rather than the land of Seir. One example of these kings is Jobab, son of Zerah, a son of Esau and his wife Basemath, who was Ishmael&#x27;s daughter (). Another is a &#x27;Temanite&#x27;, Husham (), a descendant of Esau&#x27;s son, Teman ().

None of these kings&#x27; sons became kings after their fathers died. Apparently, there was no familial royal line whereby sons of these post-Horite kings succeeded to the throne, but rather, some other system was in place by which kings were either chosen or won the right to rule ().

By the time governance of these peoples had been consolidated under kings instead of chiefs, Horites are no longer mentioned as such. According to , the Edomites destroyed the Horites and settled in their land. Theologians Carl Friedrich Keil and Franz Delitzsch considered the Horites to be Rephaim, since the verse explicitly compares the Edomite conquest with the Moabite and Ammonite conquests of the Rephaim.

<text>The Hivites ( &quot;Ḥiwwîm&quot;) were one group of descendants of Canaan, son of Ham, according to the Table of Nations in (10:17). A variety of proposals have been made, but beyond the references in the Bible to Hivites in the land of Canaan, no consensus has been reached about their precise historical identity.

==Etymology==
E. C. Hostetter has proposed that the name comes from &quot;tent-dweller,&quot; as a cognate to the Hebrew word &quot;hawwah&quot; (), which means &quot;tent-camp&quot;, although this proposal is rejected by John Day.

No name resembling &quot;Hivite&quot; has been found in Egyptian or Mesopotamian inscriptions, though the &quot;Hiyawa&quot; in a Luvian-Phoenician bilingual has been linked to the Biblical &quot;Hiwwi.&quot;

==Location==

The Hivites, according to the Book of Joshua, lived in the hilly region of Lebanon from Lebo Hamath () to Mount Hermon (). Hivites are also mentioned further south in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, which assigns to Hivites the towns of Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-Jearim (). However, the Septuagint reads these four towns as inhabited by Horites, suggesting that the name Hivite may have entered the Masoretic Text via a spelling error.

The Masoretic Text of described the Hivites as being &quot;under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.&quot; However, the Septuagint reads &quot;Hittites&quot; in place of &quot;Hivites,&quot; suggesting that one text or the other has suffered an error. 

Similarly in according to the Masoretic Text, Hivites are mentioned immediately after &quot;the stronghold of Tyre,&quot; where the Septuagint once again reads &quot;Hittites.&quot;

== Biblical mentions ==

Within the Hebrew Bible, Hivites are often listed among the inhabitants of Canaan, promised to the descendants of Abraham. , in the Masoretic Text, mentions that one of Esau&#x27;s wives was &quot;Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite&quot; who is also described as &quot;of the daughters of Canaan&quot;. However, textual evidence from the Septuagint and Genesis 36:20 suggest that Zibeon was originally referred to not as a Hivite, but a Horite.

The Book of Joshua claims that Hivites were one of seven groups living in the land of Canaan when the Israelites under Joshua commenced their conquest of the land (). These seven nations were to be exterminated: Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. In , Joshua enslaved the Hivites of Gibeon to be wood gatherers and water carriers for the Temple of YHWH (see Nethinim).

The Bible records that David&#x27;s census included Hivite cities. During the reign of Solomon, they are described as part of the slave labor for his many building projects. It is not clear if, when or how they ceased to be a separate group before the Israelite kingdoms came to an end.

Medieval Jewish exegetes like Nachmanides and Radak have suggested that the Hivvites are the same as the Rephaim, which explains why the two names never appear together in Biblical lists of Canaanite tribes. Nonetheless, this assumption has been question by later scholars. Others have argued that the Rephaim were not strictly Canaanite, but their land was nonetheless promised to Abraham.

<text>The Tennessee River is a long river located in the southeastern United States in the Tennessee Valley. Flowing through the states of Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, it begins at the confluence of French Broad and Holston rivers at Knoxville, and drains into the Ohio River near Paducah, Kentucky. It is the largest tributary of the Ohio, and drains a basin of .

Its tributary, the Little Tennessee River, flows into it from Western North Carolina and northeastern Georgia.

== Etymology ==
The river appears on French maps from the late 17th century with the names &quot;Caquinampo&quot; or &quot;Kasqui.&quot; Maps from the early 18th century call it &quot;Cussate,&quot; &quot;Hogohegee,&quot; &quot;Callamaco,&quot; and &quot;Acanseapi.&quot; A 1755 British map showed the Tennessee River as the &quot;River of the Cherakees.&quot; By the late 18th century, it had come to be called &quot;Tennessee,&quot; a name derived from the Cherokee village named Tanasi. 

==Course==

The Tennessee River is formed at the confluence of the Holston and French Broad rivers in present-day Knoxville, Tennessee. From Knoxville, it flows southwest through East Tennessee into Chattanooga before crossing into Alabama. It travels through the Huntsville and Decatur area before reaching the Muscle Shoals area, and eventually forms a small part of the state&#x27;s border with Mississippi, before returning to Tennessee. The river misses Georgia by about . The Tennessee River&#x27;s route northerly through Tennessee defines the boundary between two of Tennessee&#x27;s Grand Divisions: Middle and West Tennessee.

The Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project providing navigation on the Tombigbee River and a link to the Port of Mobile, enters the Tennessee River near the Tennessee-Alabama-Mississippi boundary. This waterway reduces the navigation distance from Tennessee, north Alabama, and northern Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico by hundreds of miles. The final part of the Tennessee&#x27;s run is north through western Kentucky, where it separates the Jackson Purchase from the rest of the state. It flows into the Ohio River at Paducah, Kentucky.

==History==
The river valley was once home to several Native American tribes. At Painted Bluff, in northeast Alabama, painted glyphs dating to ca. 1400 A.D. have been discovered among cliffs overlooking the river.

The first major battles of the American Civil War occurred along the river in 1862. The commander in the western theater, General Henry Halleck, considered the Tennessee River to be more significant than the Mississippi.

===Starting point===
 The Tennessee River begins at mile post 652, where the French Broad River meets the Holston River, but historically there were several different definitions of its starting point. In the late 18th century, the mouth of the Little Tennessee River (at Lenoir City) was considered to be the beginning of the Tennessee River. Through much of the 19th century, the Tennessee River was considered to start at the mouth of Clinch River (at Kingston). An 1889 declaration by the Tennessee General Assembly designated Kingsport (on the Holston River) as the start of the Tennessee, but the following year a federal law was enacted that finally fixed the start of the river at its current location.

===Water rights and border dispute between Georgia and Tennessee===
At various points since the early 19th century, Georgia has disputed its northern border with Tennessee. In 1796, when Tennessee was admitted to the Union, the border was originally defined by United States Congress as located on the 35th parallel, thereby ensuring that at least a portion of the river would be located within Georgia. As a result of an erroneously conducted survey in 1818 (ratified by the Tennessee legislature, but not Georgia), however, the actual border line was set on the ground approximately one mile south, thus placing the disputed portion of the river entirely in Tennessee.

Georgia made several unsuccessful attempts to correct what Georgia felt was an erroneous survey line &quot;in the 1890s, 1905, 1915, 1922, 1941, 1947 and 1971 to &#x27;resolve&#x27; the dispute&quot;, according to C. Crews Townsend, Joseph McCoin, Robert F. Parsley, Alison Martin and Zachary H. Greene, in their May 12, 2008, article for the &quot;Tennessee Bar Journal&quot;, a publication of the Tennessee Bar Association.

In 2008, as a result of a serious drought and resulting water shortage, the Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution directing the governor to pursue its claim in the United States Supreme Court.

According to a story aired on WTVC-TV in Chattanooga on March 14, 2008, a local attorney familiar with case law on border disputes, said the U.S. Supreme Court generally will maintain the original borders between states and avoid stepping into border disputes, preferring the parties work out their differences.

The &quot;Chattanooga Times Free Press&quot; reported on March 25, 2013, that Georgia senators approved House Resolution 4 stating that if Tennessee declines to settle with them, the dispute will be given to the state attorney general, to take Tennessee before the Supreme Court to settle the issue once and for all. &quot;The Atlantic Wire,&quot; in commenting on Georgia&#x27;s actions, stated:

==Modern use==
The Tennessee River is an important part of the Great Loop, the recreational circumnavigation of Eastern North America by water. The main channel is accessible to recreational watercraft at over 200 public access points along the river&#x27;s course.

The Tennessee River has historically been a major highway for riverboats through the South, and today they are frequently used along the river. Major ports include Guntersville, Chattanooga, Decatur, Yellow Creek, and Muscle Shoals. This river has contributed greatly to the economic and industrial development of the Tennessee Valley as a whole. The economies of cities such as Decatur and Chattanooga would not be as dynamic as they are today, were it not for the Tennessee River. Many companies still rely on the river as a means of transportation for their materials. In Chattanooga, for example, steel is exported on boats, as it is much more efficient than moving it on land.

In addition, locks along the Tennessee River waterway provide passage between reservoirs for more than 13,000 recreational craft each year. The Chickamauga Dam, located just upstream from Chattanooga, was projected in 2014 to have a new lock built, but it has been delayed due to a lack of funding.

In 2022, the Tennessee Volunteers football team defeated Alabama 52-49, their first win in the series since 2006. Afterward, fans stormed the field and tore down the goalposts, throwing them in the Tennessee River after parading them through the city.

==Dams==
The river has been dammed nine times since the 1930s by Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) projects. The construction of TVA&#x27;s Kentucky Dam on the Tennessee River and the Corps of Engineers&#x27; Barkley Dam on the Cumberland River led to the development of associated lakes, and the creation of an area called the Land Between the Lakes. A navigation canal located at Grand Rivers, Kentucky, links Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley. The canal allows for a shorter trip for river traffic going from the Tennessee to most of the Ohio River, and for traffic going down the Cumberland River toward Tennessee.

==Ecology==
The Tennessee River and its tributaries host some 102 species of mussel. Native Americans ate freshwater mussels. Potters of the Mississippian culture used crushed mussel shell mixed into clay to make their pottery stronger.

A &quot;pearl&quot; button industry was established in the Tennessee Valley beginning in 1887, producing buttons from the abundant mussel shells. Button production ceased after World War II when plastics replaced mother-of-pearl as a button material. Mussel populations have declined drastically due to dam construction, water pollution, and invasive species.

<text>Pioneer species are resilient species that are the first to colonize barren environments, or to repopulate disrupted biodiverse steady-state ecosystems as part of ecological succession. A number of kinds of events can create good conditions for pioneers, including disruption by natural disasters, such as wildfire, flood, mudslide, lava flow or a climate-related extinction event or by anthropogenic habitat destruction, such as through land clearance for agriculture or construction or industrial damage. Pioneer species play an important role in creating soil in primary succession, and stabilizing soil and nutrients in secondary succession.

For humans, because pioneer species quickly occupy disrupted spaces they are sometimes treated as weeds or nuisance wildlife, such as the common dandelion or stinging nettle. Even though humans have mixed relationships with these plants, these species tend to help improve the ecosystem because they can break up compacted soils and accumulate nutrients that help with a transition back to a more mature ecosystem. In human managed ecological restoration or agroforestry, trees and herbaceous pioneers can be used to restore soil qualities and provide shelter for slower growing or more demanding plants. Some systems use introduced species to restore the ecosystem, or for environmental remediation. The durability of pioneer species can also make them potential invasive species. 

==Pioneer flora==
Some lichens grow on rocks without soil, so may be among the first of life forms, and break down the rocks into soil for plants. Since some uninhabited land may have thin, poor quality soils with few nutrients, pioneer species are often hardy plants with adaptations such as long roots, root nodes containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and leaves that employ transpiration. Note that they are often photosynthetic plants, as no other source of energy (such as other species) except light energy is often available in the early stages of succession, thus making it less likely for a pioneer species to be non-photosynthetic.

The plants that are often pioneer species also tend to be wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, as insects are unlikely to be present in the usually barren conditions in which pioneer species grow; however, pioneer species tend to reproduce asexually altogether, as the extreme or barren conditions present make it more favourable to reproduce asexually in order to increase reproductive success rather than invest energy into sexual reproduction. Pioneer species will eventually die, create plant litter, and break down as &quot;leaf mold&quot; after some time, making new soil for secondary succession (see below), and releasing nutrients for small fish and aquatic plants in adjacent bodies of water.

Some examples of pioneering plant species:
* Barren sand - lyme grass (&quot;Leymus arenarius&quot;), sea couch grass (&quot;Agropyron pungens&quot;), Marram grass (&quot;Ammophila breviligulata&quot;)
* Salt water - green algae, marine eel grass (&quot;Zostera&quot; spp.), pickleweed (&quot;Salicornia virginica&quot;), and cordgrass (hybrid &quot;Spartina × townsendii&quot;) and (&quot;Spartina anglica&quot;).
* Clear water - algae, mosses, freshwater eel grass (&quot;Vallisneria americana&quot;).
* Solidified lava flows (volcanic rock) -
** in Hawaii: swordfern (&quot;Polystichum munitum&quot;), ‘ōhi‘a lehua (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;), ‘ohelo (&quot;Vaccinium reticulatum&quot;) and ‘āma‘u (&quot;Sadleria cyatheoides&quot;);
** on Surtsey: lichen (&quot;Stereocaulon vesuvianum&quot; and &quot;Placopsis gelida&quot;) and moss (&quot;Racomitrium ericoides&quot;); green algae
* Disturbed areas such as construction sites, road cuttings and verges, cultivated lands - see ruderal species
* Bare clay - Orchids
* Mountains - Lichens

==Pioneer fauna==
=== On land ===
The pioneering fauna will colonize an area only after flora and fungi have inhabited the area. Soil fauna, ranging from microscopic protists to larger invertebrates, have a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling. Bacteria and fungi are the most important groups in the breakdown of organic detritus left by primary producing plants such as skeletal soil, moss and algae. Soil invertebrates enhance fungal activity by breaking down detritus. As soil develops, earthworms and ants alter soil characteristics. Worm burrows aerate soil and ant hills alter sediment particle size dispersal, altering soil character profoundly.

Though vertebrates in general would not be considered pioneer species, there are exceptions. Natterjack toads are specialists in open, sparsely vegetated habitats which may be at an early seral stage. Wide-ranging generalists visit early succession stage habitats, but are not obligate species of those habitats because they use a mosaic of different habitats.

Vertebrates can affect early seral stages. Herbivores may alter plant growth. Fossorial mammals could alter soil and plant community development. In a profound example, a seabird colony transfers considerable nitrogen into infertile soils, thereby altering plant growth. A keystone species may facilitate the introduction of pioneer species by creating new niches. For example, beavers may flood an area, allowing new species to immigrate.

=== Under water ===
The concept of ecologic succession also applies to underwater habitats. If a space becomes newly available in a reef surrounding, haplosclerid and calcareous sponges are the first animals to initially occur in this environment in greater numbers than other species. These types of sponges grow faster and have a shorter life-span than the species which follow them in this habitat.

==Secondary succession and pioneer species==
The term pioneer species is also used to refer to the first species, usually plants, to return to an area after disturbance as part of the process of secondary succession. Disturbances may include floods, tornadoes, forest fires, deforestation, or clearing by other means.

Pioneer species tend to be fast-growing, shade-intolerant, and tend to reproduce large numbers of offspring quickly. The seeds of pioneer species can sometimes remain viable for years or decades in the soil seed bank and often are triggered to sprout by disturbance. Mycorrhizal fungi have a powerful influence on the growth of pioneer species.

Some examples of the plants in such areas include:
* Raspberry - &quot;Rubus&quot; spp.
* Heaths - Ericaceae spp.
* Graminoids, forbs, and wildflowers - native, introduced, and invasive species: such as fire dependent seed, cone, and resprouter chaparral genera.

<text>Ruslan Olehovych Ponomariov (; born 11 October 1983) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster. He was FIDE World Chess Champion from 2002 to 2004 and was the youngest holder of the title at the age of 18 years, 3 months and 12 days, though the title was split at the time. He won the Ukrainian Chess Championship in 2011.

He was runner-up in the Chess World Cup 2005 and Chess World Cup 2009, and reached the semi-finals in 2011 and the quarterfinals in 2007.

==Early career==
Ponomariov was born in Horlivka in Ukraine. He was taught to play chess by his father at the age of 5. At 9 he became a first category player, and in September 1993 he moved to Kramatorsk. Here Ponomariov attended the A. V. Momot Chess School and was trained by Boris Ponomariov. In 1994 he placed third in the World Under-12 Championship at the age of ten. In 1996 he won the European Under-18 Championship at the age of just twelve, and the following year won the World Under-18 Championship. In 1998, at the age of fourteen, he was awarded the Grandmaster title, making him the youngest ever player at that time to hold the title. In 1999, he was a member of the Ukrainian national youth team, which won the U-16 Chess Olympiad in Artek, Ukraine.

Among Ponomariov&#x27;s notable later results are first place at the Donetsk Zonal tournament in 1998, 5/7 score in the European Club Cup 2000 (including a victory over then-FIDE World Champion Alexander Khalifman), joint first with 7½/9 at Torshavn 2000, 8½/11 for Ukraine in the 2001 Chess Olympiad in Istanbul, winning gold medal on board 2, and first place with 7/10 in the 2001 Governor&#x27;s Cup in Kramatorsk.

==FIDE World Chess Champion 2002==
In 2002 he beat his fellow countryman Vasyl Ivanchuk in the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2002 by a score of 4½-2½ to become FIDE World Champion at the age of 18. He is the youngest ever holder of the title, though because he won it in a knockout-style tournament during the period where there was a title split in the chess world, he was not an undisputed holder of the title.

In the same year he finished second in the very strong Linares tournament, behind Garry Kasparov. His result in the strong 2003 Corus tournament at Wijk aan Zee was not as good – despite having the third highest Elo rating, he finished only joint eleventh out of fourteen players with 6/13, and at Linares the same year he finished only fifth out of seven with 5½/12.

There were plans for him to play a fourteen-game match against Kasparov in Yalta in September 2003, the winner of which would go on to play the winner of a match between Vladimir Kramnik and Péter Lékó as part of the so-called &quot;Prague Agreement&quot; to reunify the World Chess Championship (from 1993 until 2006 there were two world chess championships). However, this was called off by FIDE on the grounds that Ponomariov failed to sign the contract in time. The latter always alleged lack of equality in the contract for both contenders.

Ponomariov remained FIDE champion until Rustam Kasimdzhanov won the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004.

==Post-championship career==
On Ponomariov&#x27;s 20th birthday, October 11, 2003, he became the first high-profile player to forfeit a game because of his mobile phone ringing during play. This happened in round one of the European Team Chess Championship in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, when Ponomariov was playing Black against Swedish GM Evgenij Agrest.

In 2004, Ponomariov won the gold medal at the 2004 Chess Olympiad held in Calvià, Spain, with the Ukrainian team.

In 2005, he won the 15th edition of the &quot;Ciudad de Pamplona&quot; tournament. He also won a rapid tournament in Odesa, Ukraine, and the Golden Blitz Cup in Moscow. Finally, that year he reached the 2005 Chess World Cup final against Levon Aronian, who won the final. Ponomariov defeated Fritz under tournament conditions, at the 2nd Festival Internacional de Ajedrez Man-Machine in Bilbao, Spain. This is the last time that a human player has defeated a top computer at even odds under tournament conditions.

In 2006, he shared first place with Aronian and Peter Leko in the Tal Memorial tournament in Moscow.

His second-place finish in the Chess World Cup 2005 qualified him for the 2007 Candidates tournament. Ponomariov lost in the first round, in a six-game match against Sergei Rublevsky, and thus did not qualify for the 2007 World Championship tournament. he has not qualified for a Candidates tournament since.

In 2009, he shared first place with Hikaru Nakamura at the Donostia Chess Festival in San Sebastian, Spain. The latter won the tie-break blitz games 2–0. Ponomariov got one more second place by tie-break that year in the 2009 Chess World Cup, where he reached the final against Israeli Boris Gelfand. After four classic games, four rapid games, and two blitz games with a drawn score, Gelfand finally won in one last set of two blitz games.

In July 2010, Ponomariov won the prestigious Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting in Dortmund, one point ahead of Lê Quang Liêm from Vietnam. In September of that year, Ukraine won the gold once more at the 2010 Chess Olympiad in Khanty-Mansiysk with players Vasyl Ivanchuk, Ruslan Ponomariov, Pavel Eljanov, Zahar Efimenko, and Alexander Moiseenko.

In February 2011, after occupying last place at the World Blitz Championship in November 2010 in Moscow, Ponomariov showed great improvement at the strong Aeroflot Blitz held in the same city by reaching second place, just half a point behind Shakhriyar Mamedyarov.

In June 2011, he won the 80th Ukrainian Chess Championship, the strongest ever in the country, with 8½/11 and a performance rating of 2853.

== Personal life ==
Ponomariov is married to Ines, a Spanish interpreter. The two have known each other since 2008. They live in Bilbao with their son, Yaroslav.

<doc id="307191" wikidata="Q3506415" url="?curid=307191" title="Muktananda">
<text>Muktananda (16 May 1908 – 2 October 1982), born Krishna Rai, was a yoga guru and the founder of Siddha Yoga. He was a disciple of Bhagavan Nityananda. He wrote books on the subjects of Kundalini Shakti, Vedanta, and Kashmir Shaivism, including a spiritual autobiography entitled &quot;The Play of Consciousness&quot;. In honorific style, he is often referred to as &quot;Swami Muktananda&quot;, or &quot;Baba Muktananda&quot;, or in a familiar way just &quot;Baba&quot;.

== Biography ==
Swami Muktananda was born in 1908 near Mangalore in Madras Presidency, British India, to a wealthy family. His birth name was Krishna Rai. 

At 15, he encountered Bhagawan Nityananda, a wandering avadhoot who profoundly changed his life. After this encounter, Krishna left home and began his search for the experience of God. He studied under Siddharudha Swami in Hubli, where he learned Sanskrit, Vedanta, and all branches of yoga. He received sannyasa initiation in the Sarasvati order of the Dashanami Sampradaya, taking the name of Swami Muktananda. After Siddharudha&#x27;s death, Muktananda left to study with a disciple of Siddharudha called Muppinarya Swami at his Sri Airani Holematt in Ranebennur Haveri District. Then Swami Muktananda began wandering India on foot, studying with many different saints and gurus.

In 1947, Muktananda went to Ganeshpuri to receive the darshan of Bhagavan Nityananda, who had originally inspired Muktananda&#x27;s search for God. He received &quot;shaktipat&quot; initiation from him on August 15 of that year. Muktananda often said that his spiritual journey did not truly begin until he received shaktipat from Nityananda. He described it as a profound and sublime experience. For the next nine years, Muktananda lived and meditated in a small hut in Yeola. He wrote about his sadhana and kundalini-related meditation experiences in his autobiography. 

In 1956, Bhagawan Nityananda acknowledged the culmination of Muktananda&#x27;s spiritual journey. He appointed Muktananda as the leader of an ashram in Ganeshpuri, near Bombay. The same year he started teaching his Siddha Yoga path. Between 1970 and 1981, Muktananda went on three world tours. During these tours, he established Siddha Yoga ashrams and meditation centers in many countries. In 1975, he founded the Siddha Yoga Ashram in Oakland in the San Francisco Bay area. In 1979, he established Shree Nityananda Ashram (now Shree Muktananda Ashram) in the Catskills, northwest of New York City. Muktananda established Gurudev Siddha Peeth as a public trust in India to administer his work there. He founded the SYDA Foundation in the United States to administer the global work of Siddha Yoga meditation. He wrote many books, sixteen of which are still in print with the SYDA Foundation.

In May 1982, Muktananda appointed two successors, Swami Chidvilasananda and her younger brother, Swami Nityananda, as joint leaders of Siddha Yoga. Nityananda later resigned and formed his own group.

Muktananda died in October 1982 in Gurudev Siddha Peeth in Ganeshpuri, India. He is buried in his samādhi shrine there.

==Teaching and practice==
Central to his teachings were to &quot;See God in each other&quot;, and &quot;Honor your Self. Worship your Self. Meditate on your Self. God dwells within you as you.&quot; Muktananda often gave a shorter version of this teaching: &quot;God dwells within you as you.&quot;

According to Lola Williamson, Muktananda was known as a &quot;shaktipat guru because kundalini awakening occurred so readily in his presence&quot;. Through &quot;Shaktipat Intensives&quot; participants were said to receive shaktipat initiation, the awakening of Kundalini Shakti that is said to reside within a person, and to deepen their practice of Siddha Yoga meditation. Historically, Shaktipat initiation had been reserved for the few who had done many years of spiritual service and practices; Muktananda offered this initiation to newcomers and yogis alike. There are several published accounts that describe the reception of &quot;shaktipat&quot; from Muktananda. Paul Zweig wrote one such account of receiving &quot;shaktipat&quot; from Muktananda. In &quot;Gurus of Modern Yoga&quot;, Andrea Jain, in her chapter on Muktananda, quotes an anonymous source, who describes his moment of shaktipat, when he was 19 years old, conferred by Muktananda with a wand of peacock feathers in 1975:
== Alleged sexual assaults ==
Sarah Caldwell, in an essay in the academic journal &quot;Nova Religio&quot; (2001), argued that Muktananda was both an enlightened spiritual teacher and a practitioner of Shakta Tantrism, but also &quot;engaged in actions that were not ethical, legal or liberatory with many disciples.&quot; According to Lola Williamson, &quot;Muktananda stressed the value of celibacy for making progress on the spiritual path, but he almost certainly violated his own rules.&quot; Author Andrea Jain asserts &quot;Muktananda engaged in secret sexual rituals with several of his young female disciples—some of whom were teenagers—that were meant to transmit &quot;sakti&quot; to the tantric hero.&quot;

In 1981, Stan Trout, a swami for Siddha Yoga, wrote an open letter in which he referred to a number of stories of Muktananda engaging in sexual activities with young women, and threats and harassment in order to force people to &quot;stop talking about your escapades with young girls in your bedroom.&quot; In 1983 William Rodarmor printed several allegations in &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; from anonymous female devotees that Muktananda regularly had sex with them and raped them. In the article, based on twenty five interviews, former devotees charged that Muktananda had molested under-age girls, and engaged in sexual interactions with young devotees, which &quot;drew naive young women into esoteric Tantric rituals.&quot; Lis Harris repeated and extended Rodarmor&#x27;s allegations in an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (1994).

<doc id="307192" wikidata="Q815521" url="?curid=307192" title="Climax community">
<text>In scientific ecology, climax community or climatic climax community is a historic term for a community of plants, animals, and fungi which, through the process of ecological succession in the development of vegetation in an area over time, have reached a steady state. This equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area. The term is sometimes also applied in soil development. Nevertheless, it has been found that a &quot;steady state&quot; is more apparent than real, particularly across long timescales. Notwithstanding, it remains a useful concept.

The idea of a single climax, which is defined in relation to regional climate, originated with Frederic Clements in the early 1900s. The first analysis of succession as leading to something like a climax was written by Henry Cowles in 1899, but it was Clements who used the term &quot;climax&quot; to describe the idealized endpoint of succession.

== Frederic Clements&#x27; use of &quot;climax&quot; == 
Clements described the successional development of an ecological community comparable to the ontogenetic development of individual organisms. Clements suggested only comparisons to very simple organisms. Later ecologists developed this idea that the ecological community is a &quot;superorganism&quot; and even sometimes claimed that communities could be homologous to complex organisms and sought to define a single climax-type for each area. The English botanist Arthur Tansley developed this idea with the &quot;polyclimax&quot;—multiple steady-state end-points, determined by edaphic factors, in a given climatic zone. Clements had called these end-points other terms, not climaxes, and had thought they were not stable because by definition, climax vegetation is best-adapted to the climate of a given area. Henry Gleason&#x27;s early challenges to Clements&#x27; organism simile, and other strategies of his for describing vegetation were largely disregarded for several decades until substantially vindicated by research in the 1950s and 1960s (below). Meanwhile, climax theory was deeply incorporated in both theoretical ecology and in vegetation management. Clements&#x27; terms such as pre-climax, post-climax, plagioclimax and disclimax continued to be used to describe the many communities which persist in states that diverge from the climax ideal for a particular area.

Though the views are sometimes attributed to him, Clements never argued that climax communities must always occur, or that the different species in an ecological community are tightly integrated physiologically, or that plant communities have sharp boundaries in time or space. Rather, he employed the idea of a climax community—of the form of vegetation best adapted to some idealized set of environmental conditions—as a conceptual starting point for describing the vegetation in a given area. There are good reasons to believe that the species best adapted to some conditions might appear there when those conditions occur. But much of Clements&#x27; work was devoted to characterizing what happens when those ideal conditions do not occur. In those circumstances, vegetation other than the ideal climax will often occur instead. But those different kinds of vegetation can still be described as deviations from the climax ideal. Therefore, Clements developed a very large vocabulary of theoretical terms describing the various possible causes of vegetation, and various non-climax states vegetation adopts as a consequence. His method of dealing with ecological complexity was to define an ideal form of vegetation—the climax community—and describe other forms of vegetation as deviations from that ideal.

== Continuing usage of &quot;climax&quot; ==
Despite the overall abandonment of climax theory, during the 1990s use of climax concepts again became more popular among some theoretical ecologists. Many authors and nature-enthusiasts continue to use the term &quot;climax&quot; in a diluted form to refer to what might otherwise be called mature or old-growth communities. The term &quot;climax&quot; has also been adopted as a description for a late successional stage for marine macroinvertebrate communities.

Additionally, some contemporary ecologists still use the term &quot;disclimax&quot; to describe an ecosystem dominated by invasive species that competitively prevent the re-introduction of once native species. This concept borrows from Clements&#x27; earliest interpretation of climax as referring to an ecosystem that is resistant to colonization by outside species. The term disclimax was used in-context by Clements (1936), and despite being an anthropogenic phenomenon which prevents the facilitation and succession to a true climax community, it is one of the only examples of climax that can be observed in nature.

<doc id="307193" wikidata="Q1742054" url="?curid=307193" title="Rosh Hashanah (tractate)">
<text>Rosh Hashanah () is the name of a text of Jewish law originating in the Mishnah which formed the basis of tractates in both the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud of the same name. It is the eighth tractate of the order &quot;Moed&quot;. The text contains the most important rules concerning the calendar year, together with a description of the inauguration of the months, laws on the form and use of the shofar and laws related to the religious services during the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah.

==Mishna==
The Mishnah commences with an account of the four beginnings of the religious and the civil year (); it speaks of the four judgement-days of the pilgrim festivals and Rosh ha-Shanah (); of the six months in which the messengers of the Sanhedrin announce the month (); of the two months, the beginnings of which witnesses announce to the Sanhedrin even on the Sabbath (), and even if the moon is visible to every one (); Gamliel even sent on the Sabbath for forty pairs of witnesses from a distance (1:6); when father and son (who as relatives may otherwise not witness together) behold the new moon they must set out for the &quot;beth din&quot; (1:7), since they do not absolutely belong to those that are legally unfit for this purpose (1:8). 

The weak and sick are borne on litters, and are protected against the attacks of the Sadducees; they must be provided with food, for witnesses were bound to journey even on the Sabbath (1:9). Others went along to identify the unknown (2:1). In olden times bonfire-signals on the mountains announced to all as far as Babylon that the month had been sanctified. The custom of having witnesses and messengers was introduced after the Sadducees had attempted to practice deception (2:2–4). The large court called &quot;Bet Ya&#x27;azeḳ&quot; was the assembly-place for the witnesses (2:5); bountiful repasts awaited them, and dispensations from the Law were granted to them (2:6); the first pair of witnesses was questioned separately concerning the appearance of the moon, but all other witnesses were questioned at least cursorily. The Mishnah makes the point that all witnesses must be made to feel their testimony is valued to ensure witnesses continue to come to courts (2:6). Then the &quot;av bet din&quot; (head of the Court) called out to a large assembly, &quot;Sanctified!&quot; all the people cried out aloud after him (2:8). Rabban Gamliel II had representations of the moon which he showed to the witnesses. There once arose a dispute between him and Rabbi Yehoshua regarding the Tishri moon; the latter, in obedience to the &quot;nasi&quot;, came on foot to Jamnia on the day which he had calculated to be the Day of Atonement, and the two scholars made peace (iii.). There were various obstacles to the sanctification of the months, as when time was lacking for the ceremony, or when there were no witnesses present before the &quot;bet din&quot;. In the first case the following day became the new moon; in the second case the &quot;bet din&quot; alone performed the sanctification.

The Mishnah discusses also the laws of the shofar (3:2); the horn of the cow may not be used (3:2); the form of the trumpet for Rosh haShanah, the fast-day, and Yovel is determined (3:3–5); damage to the shofar and means of repair are indicated (3:6); in times of danger the people that pray assemble in pits and caves (3:7); one passing a synagogue who hears the shofar fulfills his obligation only if he intended to fulfill it (3:7); they are exhorted to be firm by being reminded of Moses&#x27; uplifted hands in the war with the Amalekites (3:8). Deaf-mutes, insane, and children are legally unfit for blowing the shofar. Johanan ben Zakkai established that the shofar be blown at Yavneh and the surrounding places even if the festival fell on Shabbat, while at one time this was done only in the Temple (4:1); he also fixed the &quot;lulav&quot; outside of the Temple for seven days, and forbade the eating of new grain on the second day of Passover (4:2); he extended the time for examining witnesses until the evening, and had them come to Yavneh even in the absence of the &quot;av bet din&quot; (4:3). The Mishnah then discusses of the order of Rosh Hashanah Mussaf prayers (4:4); of the succession of the &quot;Malkhuyot&quot;, &quot;Zikhronot&quot;, and &quot;Shofarot&quot;; of the Bible verses concerning the kingdom of God, Providence, and the trumpet-call of the future (4:5), and of the leader in prayer and his relation to the &quot;teki&#x27;ah&quot; (4:6); descriptions of the festival are given in reference to the shofar (4:7); then follows the order of the traditional trumpet-sounds (4:8); and remarks on the duties of the leader in prayer and of the congregation close the treatise (4:9).

==Tosefta==
Curious as is the order of subjects followed in this treatise, in which several mishnaic sources have been combined, the &quot;Tosefta&quot; follows it, adding comments that form the basis of the &quot;Gemara&quot; in both Talmuds. The contents of the Mishnah with the corresponding sections of the Tosefta are as follows:

General calendar for the year, 1:1–4 = Tosefta 1:1–13. Regulations concerning the months&#x27; witnesses, 1:5–2:1 (connecting with 1:4) = Tosefta 1:15–2:1 (abbreviated). Historical matter regarding fire-signals and messengers and their reception on the Sabbath, 2:2–6 = Tosefta 2:2 (abbreviated). The continuation of the laws of 2:1 concerning witnesses (2:7, 8), and the questioning of witnesses, and the sanctification of the months are entirely lacking in the Tosefta. Historical data concerning Gamaliel and the dispute with Joshua, 2:8–9 = Tosefta 2:3 (a mere final teaching). Continuation of the laws of 2:7 concerning witnesses, 3:1 = Tosefta 3:1, 2. Regulations regarding the shofar and its use, 3:2–5 = Tosefta 3:3–6a. Aggadic teaching on devotion = Tosefta 3:6b. Final remarks on the shofar and on its obligations, 3:6–end = Tosefta 4:1. Ordinances of Johanan ben Zakkai concerning Rosh ha-Shanah and the Sabbath, and other matters = Tosefta 4:2. Order of worship, 4:5–end = Tosefta 4:4–end. 

Mishnah 2:7 seems to have been transposed according to Tosefta 4:3, but it belongs there according to its contents.

In quoting many of Gamliel&#x27;s ordinances the Mishnah emphasizes the authority of the patriarchal house by recounting the dispute between the patriarch and his deputy Joshua and showing how the latter was forced to yield. The &quot;Tosefta&quot; omits the ordinances of Gamliel and of Johanan ben Zakkai, and the dispute of the two leaders of the school-house, nor does it mention anything of the power of any tannaitic dignitary; the &quot;Tosefta&quot; is here a product of the time of the Amoraim. The dignity of the &quot;nasi&quot; is not emphasized, because acumen and scholarship prevailed in the schoolhouse, and there was no desire to let old precedences (see &quot;Eduyot&quot;) come to the fore again. Even the Mishnah contains some additions from the time of the Amoraim (see, for example, 4:2, where a gap must be filled from the Tosefta).

<text>An emergent coastline is a stretch along the coast that has been exposed by the sea by a relative fall in sea levels by either isostasy or eustasy.

Emergent coastline are the opposite of submergent coastlines, which have experienced a relative rise in sea levels.

The emergent coastline may have several specific landforms:
* Raised beach or machair
* Wave cut platform
* Sea cave such as King&#x27;s Cave, Isle of Arran

The Scottish Gaelic word &quot;machair&quot; or &quot;machar&quot; refers to a fertile low-lying raised beach found on some of the coastlines of Ireland and Scotland (especially the Outer Hebrides).

Hudson Bay, in Canada&#x27;s north, is an example of an emergent coastline. It is still emerging by as much as 1 cm per year. Another example of emergent coastline is the Eastern Coastal Plains of the Indian Subcontinent.

<text>Submergent coastlines or drowned coastlines are stretches along the coast that have been inundated by the sea by a relative rise in sea levels from either isostacy or eustacy.

Submergent coastline are the opposite of emergent coastlines, which have experienced a relative fall in sea levels.

Many submergent coastlines were formed by the end of the Last Glacial Period (LGP), when glacial retreat caused both global sea level rise and also localised changes to land height.

== Formation ==
Submergent coastlines form either when sea level rises or the land level fall. This can be caused by isostatic or eustatic change. Both isostatic and eustatic change can be caused by a variety of reasons.

Isostatic change could be due to post-glacial adjustment. Another common cause of isostatic change that can result in a submergent coastline is tectonic action. Events such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions may cause land subsidence therefore causing isostatic sea level increases.

Eustatic sea level rise can also be caused by many reasons. One common reason is thermal expansion. Thermal expansion occurs when water gets warmer and so the volume of water increases, this therefore causes global sea level rise forming submergent coastlines.

== Common features ==
Features of a submergent coastline include:

=== Rias ===

Rias, a drowned river valley. They are a section of a river valley flooded by the sea, making them much wider than would be expected based on the river flowing into it. Many rias were formed by the rise in sea level after the melting of vast continental glaciers. Rias commonly have a widening funnel shape and gradually increasing depth as they move towards the coast. The widening and deepening of the ria towards the sea usually causes an exaggerated tidal effect within the estuary.

=== Fjords ===
Fjords, which are drowned glaciated valleys (&quot;Also known as U-shaped valleys)&quot;. A section of a glacially eroded valley is flooded by the sea when a fjord is formed.

=== Dalmatian Coasts ===

Dalmatian coasts composed of long narrow islands running parallel to the coastline and separated from the coast by narrow sea channels called sounds. Dalmatian coasts are named after the Dalmatia region of Croatia which displays the common features of a dalmatian coast.

== Examples ==
Notable and illustrative examples of submergent coastlines include:
* Western Norway, famed for its many fjords created by sea level rise at the end of the LGP.
* The Western Coastal Plains of the Indian subcontinent, which includes the estuaries of the Narmada and the Tapti Rivers.
* Southern England and South Wales, caused by a &quot;see-saw&quot; reaction to uplift to the north of Great Britain after glacial retreat redistributed weight on the land, including many substantial rias such as Falmouth Harbour, Plymouth Harbour, Kingsbridge Estuary and Milford Haven.
* The Dalmatian coast, famed for its many small inshore islands, formed by sea level rise in the Mediterranean at the end of the LGP.
* Port Jackson or the Sydney Harbour in New South Wales, Australia is an example of a ria or drowned river valley.

<doc id="307209" wikidata="Q3098117" url="?curid=307209" title="Wisconsin Badgers">
<text>The Wisconsin Badgers are the athletic teams representing the University of Wisconsin–Madison. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level), primarily competing in the Big Ten Conference for all sports since the 1896–97 season. The women&#x27;s ice hockey team competes in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), while the men&#x27;s crew team compete in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC).

The athletic director is Chris McIntosh, former professional football player and lineman for the Wisconsin Badger football team. The Badgers team colors are cardinal and white, and the team mascot is named &quot;Buckingham U. Badger,&quot; known as &quot;Bucky Badger.&quot; The Badgers have several major on-campus facilities, including Camp Randall Stadium, the UW Field House, and the Kohl Center.

==Team name origin==

Wisconsin was dubbed the &quot;Badger State&quot; because of the lead miners who first settled there in the 1820s and 1830s. Without shelter in the winter, they had to &quot;live like badgers&quot; in tunnels burrowed into hillsides.
The badger mascot was adopted by the University of Wisconsin in 1889.

His name, &quot;Buckingham U. Badger&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Bucky Badger,&quot; was chosen in a contest in 1949. The emblem, a scowling, strutting badger wearing a cardinal-and-white striped sweater, was designed by Art Evans in 1940 and updated in 2003. A live badger from Eau Claire was used at the first few football games that year, but proved to be too fierce to be controlled and was retired to the nearby Henry Vilas Zoo. For a time, the school replaced the live badger with a live raccoon named &quot;Regdab&quot; (&quot;badger&quot; backwards).

In 2006, Bucky Badger became a charter member of the Mascot Hall of Fame&#x27;s College Division. Bucky Badger has a tradition of doing the amount of pushups that the football team has every time they score.

== Sports sponsored ==

Wisconsin is the only Big Ten school and one of only five Power 5 schools that do not sponsor baseball, the other four being Colorado, Iowa State, SMU and Syracuse. Wisconsin previously sponsored a baseball team, but discontinued it after the 1991 season. Wisconsin is also the only Big Ten school with a varsity men&#x27;s rowing program. Badger men&#x27;s rowing has won 9 national championships, making it Wisconsin&#x27;s most successful athletics program.

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===
Wisconsin has made it to the NCAA Final Four four times in its history — back-to-back trips in 2014 and 2015, in 2000, and in 1941, when it won the national championship. The Badgers participated in the NCAA tournament for 19 consecutive seasons (1999–2017). Wisconsin tied for first place in the Big Ten in the 2001–02 season, along with Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio State. In 2002–03 the Badgers won the Big Ten outright, but then lost in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament to Ohio State. In the NCAA Tournament, Wisconsin lost to Kentucky in the Sweet 16. In 2003–04, Wisconsin finished second in the Big Ten. The team went on to win the program&#x27;s first Big Ten tournament title. However, the Badgers lost to 3rd-seeded Pittsburgh in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. In the 2004–05 season Wisconsin finished third in the Big Ten. In the 2005 NCAA Tournament, Wisconsin advanced to the Elite Eight by defeating 11th-seeded Northern Iowa, 14th-seeded Bucknell, and 10th-seeded North Carolina State. In 2005–06 the Badgers lost to Indiana in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals, and to Arizona in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The highlight of the season was a win over intrastate rival Marquette.

In the 2006–07 season the Badgers had victories at Marquette and at home against 2nd ranked Pittsburgh. Its lone non-conference loss was against Missouri State. On February 19, 2007, they earned their first No. 1 ranking in school history with a 26–2 record, but were defeated the next day by the unranked Michigan State Spartans. Entering the Big 10 Tournament as the second seed, their first game was against Michigan State, who the Badgers defeated 70–57. In the next round against Illinois, the Badgers won 53–41 and advanced to the final to face No. 1-ranked Ohio State. The Buckeyes defeated the Badgers 66–49. In the NCAA Tournament Wisconsin received a Number 2 seed in the Midwest bracket. The Badgers defeated Texas A&amp;M Corpus-Christi. The second round of the tournament proved fatal for the Badgers, who lost to UNLV.

Dick Bennett is largely credited with beginning the turnaround of the program. During his six-year tenure at Wisconsin (1995–2000), the Badgers achieved a 91–68 record and had two 20-win seasons. Only twice previously had the Badgers won at least 20 games in a season, the most recent being the 1940–41 championship season. Coach Bo Ryan has been in charge since the 2001–02 season and has led the Badgers to the NCAA Tournament every year. During the 2006–07 season, he not only achieved his 500th win as a college coach but the Badgers were also ranked Number 1 in the AP Top for the first time in program history. On December 12, 2009, Ryan earned his 200th win with the Badgers (against 75 losses), defeating in-state rival Marquette. During the 2014–2015 season, the Badgers reached the National Championship game, but lost to Mike Krzyzewski&#x27;s Duke squad.

Badgers currently in the NBA include Sam Dekker, Frank Kaminsky, Devin Harris, Greg Stiemsma and Jon Leuer.

=== Football ===
Wisconsin&#x27;s football program has been among the most successful in the Big Ten since the early 1990s, when Barry Alvarez was hired as head coach. Under Alvarez, the Badgers won three Big Ten Championships and three Rose Bowls. In the 2005 season, Alvarez&#x27;s last year as coach, the Badgers defeated the Auburn Tigers 24-10, in the Capital One Bowl. In 2006, Bret Bielema took over as head coach, posting a 12–1 record and defeating Arkansas 17-14, in the Capital One Bowl. On December 5, 2012, Bielema announced his departure for Arkansas, stating, &quot;I just felt it was time for me to try and spread my wings and fly a little bit further.&quot; Bielema was Alvarez&#x27;s handpicked successor, and he coached the Badgers in their return to the Rose Bowl. The Badgers are 16–14 in bowl games, and have made 14 bowl appearance in the past 15 seasons, including a school record seven straight appearances. The Badger football program has had two Heisman Trophy winners: fullback Alan Ameche in 1954, and running back Ron Dayne in 1999. They came close in the 2011–2012 season, with their running back Montee Ball, who was a finalist but lost to Robert Griffin III (RG3). Running back Melvin Gordon was runner-up in 2014.Under Paul Chryst they have won 4 straight bowl games and 2 NY6 bowl wins in the Cotton and Orange bowls and never winning less than 8 games in a season in his 4 years.

The Wisconsin Badgers football team plays its home games at Camp Randall Stadium. Built in 1917, Camp Randall is the fourth-oldest college football stadium in the country and has a capacity of 80,321. The student section at Camp Randall is considered by many to be one of the best in all of college football. Among the stadium traditions is a well-known student celebration to the House of Pain song &quot;Jump Around,&quot; occurring at the end of the third quarter of every home game. The students also sing songs in unison, including &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; and &quot;(Build Me Up) Buttercup&quot;. The University of Wisconsin Marching Band performs its &quot;Fifth Quarter&quot; after every game.

=== Ice hockey ===
The Badger men won their sixth national championship in 2006, at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, with a 2–1 victory over Boston College Eagles. The men&#x27;s team had previously won the national championship in 1973, 1977, 1981, 1983, and 1990.

The Badger women won their first title in 2006, at Mariucci Arena in Minneapolis, with a 3–0 victory over the defending champion Minnesota Golden Gophers. This was the first women&#x27;s hockey national championship for Wisconsin and the first time that the NCAA Women&#x27;s National Championship trophy left the state of Minnesota. (Minnesota-Duluth won the trophy in 2001, 2002, and 2003; Minnesota won it in 2004 and 2005.) The victory did, however, continue the Western Collegiate Hockey Association&#x27;s dominance of the women&#x27;s crown. On March 18, 2007, the Badger women captured the back-to-back national championship with a 4–1 win over Minnesota-Duluth at Herb Brooks Arena, in Lake Placid, New York. The Badgers returned to the national championship game in 2008, but suffered a 4–0 loss at the hands of Minnesota-Duluth. In 2009, the Badgers became the first team in NCAA history to reach the title game in four consecutive seasons, winning their third national championship with a 5–0 victory over Mercyhurst. The Badgers went on to win their fourth national championship in 2011, defeating Boston University 4-1 at Tullio Arena in Erie, Pennsylvania.

Mike Eaves was the head coach of the men&#x27;s hockey team until March 2016, while Mark Johnson coaches the women&#x27;s hockey team. Both coaches were teammates on the Badgers&#x27; 1977 NCAA title team. Former Denver Pioneers head coach George Gwozdecky, the only other person besides Eaves and Johnson to win ice hockey national championships as both a player and head coach, was also a member of Wisconsin&#x27;s 1977 national championship team.

The men&#x27;s team plays their home games at the Kohl Center in Madison. The women&#x27;s team plays their home games at LaBahn Arena. Both teams use the LaBahn Arena as a practice facility.

===Softball===

The Badgers softball team began play in 1996. The team has made seven NCAA Tournament appearances in 2001, 2002, 2005, 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2018. The current head coach is Yvette Healy.

=== Wrestling ===
The University of Wisconsin wrestling team was established in 1911. Through the 2018–19 season, the UW Badger wrestling team has had 18 NCAA champions, 70 Big Ten champions, 112 All-Americans, and 4 Olympians. Home dual meets and tournaments take place at the Wisconsin Fieldhouse. Barry Davis served as head coach of the program for 25 years until his retirement in 2018. Former South Dakota State University head coach Chris Bono, took over as Wisconsin&#x27;s head coach at the start of the 2018–19 season.

<doc id="307211" wikidata="Q1029941" url="?curid=307211" title="Camp Randall Stadium">
<text>Camp Randall Stadium is an outdoor stadium in Madison, Wisconsin, located on the campus of the University of Wisconsin. It has been the home of the Wisconsin Badgers football team in rudimentary form since 1895, and as a fully functioning stadium since 1917. It is the oldest and fifth largest stadium in the Big Ten Conference.
The field has a conventional north–south alignment, at an approximate elevation of above sea level.

==History==
The stadium lies on the grounds of Camp Randall, a Union Army training camp during the Civil War. The camp was named after then Governor Alexander Randall, who later became Postmaster General of the United States.
After an outcry from veterans over plans to turn the site into building lots, the state bought it in 1893 and presented it to the university. Soon afterward, it was pressed into service as an athletic ground. It was originally used by the track and field team before the football and baseball teams moved there in 1895. The wooden bleachers were very difficult to maintain, and some were condemned as unsafe in 1914. The university then asked for $40,000 to build a concrete-and-steel stadium, and got $20,000. After three sections of bleachers collapsed during a 1915 game, the state readily granted the additional money. The new stadium opened for the first time on October 6, 1917. It consisted of 7,500 concrete seats—roughly corresponding to the lower portion of the current stadium&#x27;s east grandstand—and 3,000 wooden seats from the old field.

After the wooden seats burned down in 1922, more permanent seats were added in stages until it consisted of a horseshoe opening to the south, with a running track around the field. In 1940, the UW built an addition to the east side of Camp Randall that included housing for 150 people (as well as a rifle range and facilities for boxing and wrestling). In 1951, the university decided to turn the Stadium Dorm rooms into office space. The stadium was renovated at various points to raise the size of the horseshoe by nearly doubling the number of rows around the stadium in stages, placing south stands in front of the Wisconsin Field House (built in 1930), the removal of the track and addition of nearly 11,000 seats in 1958, the addition of the upper deck on the west side in 1966, and finally the 2005 addition of boxes along the eastern rim of the stadium.

Originally natural grass, the field was one of the first in the United States to convert to artificial turf in 1968. Superturf was installed in 1980, and a new AstroTurf field was installed in 1990, and replaced in 1998. A new type of artificial grass, infilled FieldTurf, was installed for the 2003 season, replaced after the spring term in time for the 2012 season.

The stadium also houses athletic offices of the university. In 2002, a large-scale reconstruction project commenced, which added luxury boxes, a five-story office building, and separate football program offices. In addition, concessions, restrooms and other infrastructure items were upgraded, the walkway around the field was removed, and new scoreboards were installed. The construction was completed prior to the start of the 2004 season. The football team continued to play at the stadium throughout the construction.

Also during this period of reconstruction at the stadium, changes were made to the visiting team locker room. Known as one of the best visiting team locker rooms in the Big Ten Conference, it was initially painted a bright pink, a color thought to affect the play of the visiting team (similar to Iowa&#x27;s pale pink visiting locker room). The UW Athletic Dept. decided that the color may irritate the opposing team and had the room painted a pale shade of blue called &quot;prison blue&quot;, named for the shade of paint used in Wisconsin Department of Corrections facility cells, which is intended to have a &quot;calming effect.&quot; Since this change, the Badgers have had a 43–4 home record.

The numbers of Wisconsin&#x27;s two Heisman Trophy winners, Alan Ameche and Ron Dayne, are displayed on the upper deck façade. Both of their numbers (35 and 33, respectively) are retired; The retired numbers of Elroy Hirsch (40), Dave Schreiner (80), Allan Shafer (83), and Pat Richter (88) were added during the 2006 football season.

At Barry Alvarez&#x27;s final game as head coach in 2005, plans were announced to place a statue of him in the Stadium&#x27;s Kellner Plaza. The bronze statue was unveiled in 2006 on October 13. On November 17, it was joined by a similar statue of former UW athlete and athletic director Pat Richter.

Announced in the fall of 2010 and completed in January 2014, the Student Athlete Performance Center, an expansion of Camp Randall to the north, included a new scoreboard, academic and strength training facilities, multimedia instructional space, lower-level football team access tunnel, and renovated locker rooms, shower rooms and equipment space. The new scoreboard is and the Daktronics screen is (per @BadgerFootball), with two smaller screens flanking either side.

In 2018, a plan was announced to build premium seating in the south end zone (replacing existing bleacher seating), replace the artificial turf, upgrade utilities, and improve the press box. These projects were completed over the summer of 2022, cutting the stadium&#x27;s capacity from 80,321 down to its current number of 75,822. With the 2024 expansion of the Big Ten and its new television contract adding new evening games to the schedule deep into November, and the possibility of hosting College Football Playoff games, UW–Madison replaced the field after the 2023 season with a heated surface and winterization measures which will allow it to continue hosting games until the end of the year. The scoreboard will also have additional panels added on to replace traditional static advertising hoardings.

==Crush==


On October 30, 1993, Wisconsin defeated the Michigan Wolverines, 13–10, for the first time since 1981. As the final gun sounded, students began to charge the field to celebrate, but were blocked by the guardrails surrounding the field. The crowd in the back, not aware of what was going on at the front, continued to move forward, aided by gravity. Those in front were crushed against the rails and then trampled when the rails finally gave way and the throng spilled onto the field. There were no fatalities, but 73 students were injured, six of them critically. Several Badgers football players assisted with removing the injured from the tangle. Per Mar Security (stadium security) and the University of Wisconsin were later found liable for this situation.

As a result, design changes were made in the stadium that increased the size and strength of the fences. Stadium personnel also received training to help them better handle a field rush. A field rush after a defeat of no. 1 Ohio State on October 16, 2010, showed that the measures taken after 1993 worked, as only one minor injury took place.

==Off-the-field traditions==
Badger football events at Camp Randall Stadium include numerous traditions. Some of these include:

===The Fifth Quarter===
In 1969, the Badgers had lost 24 straight games, and Michael Leckrone took over the Wisconsin Marching Band. Working with athletic director Elroy Hirsch, Leckrone and the band created a fan event called &quot;The Fifth Quarter&quot;, that took place at the end of the game.

Songs typically played during the Fifth Quarter include &quot;On Wisconsin&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Said It All&quot; (also known as the &quot;Bud&quot; song, referring to its beginning as a jingle in a Budweiser beer commercial), &quot;Space Badgers&quot; (A variation on the opening to Also sprach Zarathustra), &quot;Dance Little Bird&quot; (The Chicken Dance), &quot;Beer Barrel Polka&quot;, &quot;Tequila&quot;, and &quot;Hey Baby.&quot; Many spectators remain in the stands for 20 minutes after the game to enjoy the performance. Many of the songs are associated with specific choreography in which the band, cheerleaders and the audience all participate.

At the end of the Fifth Quarter, the band lines up to play &quot;Varsity&quot; as the spectators sing. The band then exits the field via the north entrance to perform more and sing &quot;It&#x27;s Hard to Be Humble&quot;, after which the band marches to the Mosse Humanities Building, where it is dismissed.

The Fifth Quarter was officially named in 1978, and its traditions have been passed down since then.

Leckrone directed his final &quot;Fifth Quarter&quot; performance on November 24, 2018, after a 50-year career as director of the band.

===&quot;Jump Around&quot; tradition===
Another tradition at UW football games is the &quot;Jump Around&quot;, where fans dance to the House of Pain song of the same name. This takes place between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition began during the 1993 football season with the men&#x27;s swim team smuggling in a megaphone and discman and playing the song to rile up sections O and P. The media start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers&#x27; Homecoming game against the Purdue Boilermakers. After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, the Badgers&#x27; marketing agent in charge of sound piped the song through the loudspeakers. It stirred up fans and players and has become a tradition of the last decade.

On September 6, 2003, (the Badgers&#x27; first home game of the season), with construction of the skyboxes surrounding the stadium, UW officials decided to cancel the &quot;Jump Around&quot; tradition that had been a staple for five years. Stadium security and the local police department had been informed of this decision, but no notification had been given to the fans. As the fourth quarter began and students realized there had been no &quot;Jump Around&quot;, they became upset. Some jumped around without the requisite music. Then an entire section sat down in protest, a majority directed their middle finger at the sound booth, and a chant of &quot;Fuck the sound guy&quot; began. Sitting down was particularly significant as the student section generally stands on the bleachers while the team is playing. Chanting and booing continued through the majority of the fourth quarter. With 6:29 to go in the game, Lee Evans scored on a 99-yard play and led the Badgers to a victory.

When news surfaced on Monday, September 8, 2003, that this event was not a technical or human malfunction, but rather a decision by campus officials, the students launched a protest. Petitions circulated and students pushed back against administration. Structural engineers confirmed that the stadium could withstand the vibrations created by jumping. Two days later, Chancellor John D. Wiley announced that the &quot;Jump Around&quot; tradition would resume.

==Other uses==

The stadium is also used by the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association for its state football championships.

===NFL===
The Green Bay Packers played twelve exhibition games at Camp Randall, which, up until 2013, had a larger seating capacity than the Packers&#x27; home stadium, Lambeau Field. The series began in 1986, shortly after the Chicago Bears began to use nearby University of Wisconsin-Platteville as a training camp site. The most recent pre-season Packers game at Camp Randall was played in 1999.

===Hockey===

The University of Wisconsin men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams each played an outdoor hockey game at Camp Randall Stadium on February 6, 2010, as part of the Culver&#x27;s Camp Randall Hockey Classic. The Wisconsin women defeated Bemidji State 6–1, while the Badger men beat Michigan 3–2.

===Entertainment===

Camp Randall has also hosted a number of major concerts.

==Complex==
The Camp Randall athletic complex includes three additional facilities: the Field House, home to the UW basketball teams until January 1998, and now the wrestling and women&#x27;s volleyball teams; the Dave McClain Athletic Facility, an indoor football practice facility named for the late Badgers football coach, Dave McClain, which also houses locker rooms for football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track, and soccer, and strength and conditioning, sports medicine, and academic services; and the Camp Randall Memorial Sports Center (&quot;The Shell&quot;), which contains a 200-meter indoor track that surrounds facilities for intramural sports. The indoor track is used by the UW track teams during their indoor seasons. The Shell also houses a practice ice sheet.

<text>Banco de Gaia is an English electronic music project, formed in 1989 by Toby Marks (born 1964, South London, England).

The music of Banco de Gaia is mostly categorized as ambient dub and downtempo. Marks works to cross genres, often using Arabic and Middle Eastern samples against a bass heavy reggae, rock, or trance rhythm to produce deeply textured tracks that progress layer upon layer.

==History==
In 1978, Marks began his musical career as a drummer in a heavy metal band.

Marks moved to Portugal in 1986 and played Beatles music for tourists. He first delved into electronic music in 1989, when he bought a digital sampler. The first tune he recorded on it was called &quot;Maxwell House&quot;.

Having cut his teeth on the early 1990s ambient dub compilations, in 1994 he released his first studio album &quot;Maya&quot; on the Planet Dog label, which was submitted to the Mercury Music Prize on its release. It was followed in 1995 by the critically acclaimed &quot;Last Train to Lhasa&quot;. Both albums reached No. 1 on the UK Indie Chart and featured in the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart. In the following decade, Marks released &quot;Live at Glastonbury&quot;, &quot;Big Men Cry&quot;, &quot;The Magical Sounds of Banco De Gaia&quot;, &quot;Igizeh&quot; and &quot;You Are Here&quot;.

In 1997, Marks put together a five-piece band that included Ted Duggan (drums), Ashley Hopkins (bass), Larry Whelan (wind synth, saxophone and ethnic flutes), and Gary Spacey-Foot (percussion and saxophones). The band reduced in number to just Marks, Duggan and Hopkins in 1999, and then just Marks and Duggan from 2000 until 2003, when Marks went back to being a solo artist.

On 20 September 2009, Marks played an album launch show for his album &quot;Memories Dreams Reflections&quot; at Dingwalls in London. This show was to celebrate 20 years of Banco de Gaia. Marks was joined on stage by three members from the original five-piece band: Hopkins, Whelan and Duggan and vocalist Maya Preece, who sang on the latest album.

He released a studio album &quot;Apollo&quot; on 8 April 2013, on his own Disco Gecko Recordings.

In 2015, Marks returned to playing with a live three-piece band, with Ted Duggan (drums) and James Eller (bass).

On 7 October 2016, he released his ninth studio album &quot;The 9th of Nine Hearts&quot;, featuring collaborations with Sophie Barker (Zero 7), Tim Bowness (No-Man), Dick Parry (Pink Floyd) and his band.

<text>Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall (born Marmaduke William Pickthall; 7 April 187519 May 1936) was an English Islamic scholar noted for his 1930 English translation of the Quran, called &quot;The Meaning of the Glorious Koran&quot;. His translation of the Quran (usually anglicized as &quot;Koran&quot; in Pickthall&#x27;s era) is one of the most widely known and used in the English-speaking world. A convert from Christianity to Islam, Pickthall was a novelist, esteemed by D. H. Lawrence, H. G. Wells, and E. M. Forster, as well as journalists, political and religious leaders. He declared his conversion to Islam in dramatic fashion after delivering a talk on &#x27;Islam and Progress&#x27; on 29 November 1917, to the Muslim Literary Society in Notting Hill, West London.

==Biography==
Marmaduke William Pickthall was born in Cambridge Terrace, near Regent&#x27;s Park in London, on 7 April 1875, the elder of the two sons of the Reverend Charles Grayson Pickthall (1822–1881) and his second wife, Mary Hale, &quot;née&quot; O&#x27;Brien (1836–1904). Charles was an Anglican clergyman, the rector of Chillesford, a village near Woodbridge, Suffolk. The Pickthalls traced their ancestry to a knight of William the Conqueror, Sir Roger de Poictu, from whom their surname derives. Mary, of the Irish Inchiquin clan, was the widow of William Hale and the daughter of Admiral Donat Henchy O&#x27;Brien, who served in the Napoleonic Wars. Pickthall spent the first few years of his life in the countryside, living with several older half-siblings and a younger brother in his father&#x27;s rectory in rural Suffolk. He was a sickly child. When about six months old, he fell very ill of measles complicated by bronchitis. On the death of his father in 1881 the family moved to London. He attended Harrow School but left after six terms. As a schoolboy at Harrow, Pickthall was a classmate and friend of Winston Churchill.

Pickthall travelled across many Eastern countries, gaining a reputation as a Middle-Eastern scholar, at a time when the institution of the Caliphate had collapsed with the Muslim world failing to find consensus on appointing a successor. Before declaring his faith as a Muslim, Pickthall was a strong ally of the Ottoman Empire. He studied the Orient, and published articles and novels on the subject. While in the service of the Nizam of Hyderabad, Pickthall published his English translation of the Quran with the title &quot;The Meaning of the Glorious Koran&quot;. The translation was authorized by the Al-Azhar University and the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; praised his efforts by writing &quot;noted translator of the glorious Quran into English language, a great literary achievement.&quot; Pickthall was conscripted in the last months of World War I and became corporal in charge of an influenza isolation hospital.

When news of the Armenian genocide reached Britain, Pickthall frequently wrote in defense of the Ottomans by downplaying atrocities committed against Armenians, whom he also made derogatory remarks about. During the war, Pickthall developed a reputation as &quot;a rabid Turkophile&quot;, consequently denying him a position with the Arab Bureau. The role was instead given to T. E. Lawrence.

In June 1917, Pickthall gave a speech defending the rights of Palestinian Arabs, in the context of the debate over the Balfour Declaration. In November 1917, Pickthall publicly took shahada at the Woking Muslim Mission with the support of Khwaja Kamal-ud-Din. He followed this with a speech contrasting the Christian and Muslim approaches to religious law, arguing that Islam was better equipped than Christianity to handle the post-World War world.

Pickthall, who now identified himself as a &quot;Sunni Muslim of the Hanafi school&quot;, was active as &quot;a natural leader&quot; within a number of Islamic organizations. He preached Friday sermons in both the Woking Mosque and in London. Some of his khutbas (sermons) were subsequently published. For a year he ran the Islamic Information Bureau in London, which issued a weekly paper, &quot;The Muslim Outlook&quot;. Pickthall and Quran translator Yusuf Ali were trustees of both the Shah Jehan Mosque in Woking and the East London Mosque.

In 1920 he went to India with his wife to serve as editor of the &quot;Bombay Chronicle&quot;, On the behest of Nizam of Hyderabad he was appointed Principal at Chadarghat High School in the Princely State of Hyderabad in 1926. The Nizam’s Government proposed to establish a Publicity Bureau in the Hyderabad State as it appeared in the Mushir-i-Deccan on 14 June 1931, that Marmaduke Pickthall is to be appointed Publicity Officer in addition to his own duties as Principal of the Chadarghat High School. Returning to England only in 1935, a year before his death at St Ives, Cornwall.

Pickthall was buried in the Muslim section at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey, England, where Abdullah Yusuf Ali was later buried.

<text>John Haley &quot;Zoot&quot; Sims (October 29, 1925 – March 23, 1985) was an American jazz saxophonist, playing mainly tenor but also alto (and, later, soprano) saxophone. He first gained attention in the &quot;Four Brothers&quot; sax section of Woody Herman&#x27;s big band, afterward enjoying a long solo career, often in partnership with fellow saxmen Gerry Mulligan and Al Cohn.
==Biography==
Sims was born in 1925 in Inglewood, California, United States, to vaudeville performers Kate Haley and John Sims. His father was a vaudeville hoofer, and Sims prided himself on remembering many of the steps his father taught him. Growing up in a performing family, he learned to play drums and clarinet at an early age. His brother was the trombonist Ray Sims.

Sims began on tenor saxophone at age 13. He initially modelled his playing on the work of Lester Young, Ben Webster, and Don Byas. By his late teens, having dropped out of high school, he was playing in big bands, starting with those of Kenny Baker and Bobby Sherwood. He joined Benny Goodman&#x27;s band for the first time in 1943 (he was to rejoin in 1946, and continued to perform with Goodman on occasion through the late 1970s). Sims replaced Ben Webster in Sid Catlett&#x27;s Quartet of 1944. In May 1944, Sims made his recording debut for Commodore Records in a sextet led by pianist Joe Bushkin, who two months earlier had recorded for the same label as part of Lester Young&#x27;s Kansas City Six.

Sims served as a corporal in the United States Army Air Force from 1944 to 1946, then returned to music in the bands of Artie Shaw, Stan Kenton, and Buddy Rich. He was one of Woody Herman&#x27;s &quot;Four Brothers&quot;. From 1954–1956 he toured with his friend Gerry Mulligan&#x27;s sextet, and in the early 1960s, with Mulligan&#x27;s Concert Jazz Band. Sims played on some of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s recordings. From the late 1950s to the end of his life, Sims was primarily a freelancer, though he worked frequently in the 1960s and early 1970s with a group co–led with Al Cohn. In the 1970s and 1980s, he also played and recorded regularly with a handful of other musical partners including Bucky Pizzarelli, Joe Venuti, and Jimmy Rowles. In 1975, he began recording for Norman Granz&#x27;s Pablo Records label. Sims appeared on more than 20 Pablo albums, mostly as a featured solo artist, but also as a backing musician for artists including Count Basie, Sarah Vaughan, and Clark Terry. Between 1974 and 1983, Sims recorded six studio albums with pianist Jimmy Rowles in a quartet setting that critic Scott Yanow wrote feature Sims at his best.

Sims acquired the nickname &quot;Zoot&quot; early in his career while he was in the Kenny Baker band in California. &quot;When he joined Kenny Baker&#x27;s band as a fifteen-year-old tenor saxophonist, each of the music stands was embellished with a nonsense word. The one he sat behind said &#x27;Zoot.&#x27; That became his name.&quot;

Sims played a 30-second solo on the song &quot;Poetry Man&quot;, written by singer Phoebe Snow on her debut eponymous album in 1974. He also played on Laura Nyro&#x27;s &quot;Lonely Women&quot;, on her album &quot;Eli and the Thirteenth Confession&quot;.

Sims&#x27; last studio recording was a November, 1984 trio session featuring bassist Red Mitchell, recorded in Sweden and released in 1985 by Sonet records. He died of lung cancer on March 23, 1985, in New York City, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, in Nyack, New York.

<text>Alistair Te Ariki Campbell ONZM (25 June 1925 – 16 August 2009) was a poet, playwright, and novelist. Born in the Cook Islands, Campbell was the son of a Cook Island Māori mother and a Pākehā father, who both died when he was young, leading to him growing up in a New Zealand orphanage. He became a prolific poet and writer, with a lyrical and romantic style tempered by a darkness borne out of his difficult childhood and struggles with mental health as a young adult. Although he wrote about Māori culture from his earliest works, after a revelatory return to the Cook Islands in 1976, his later works increasingly featured Pasifika culture and themes. 

Campbell received a number of notable awards during his lifetime including the New Zealand Book Award for Poetry and Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement, and is considered one of New Zealand&#x27;s foremost poets as well as a pioneer of Pasifika literature written in English.

==Early life and career==

Campbell was born in Rarotonga, on 25 June 1925, and spent his early years on Penrhyn atoll or Tongareva. His mother, Teu Bosini, was Cook Island Māori, and his father, John Archibald (Jock) Campbell, was a Pākehā New Zealander of Scottish descent. His father was a former World War I soldier who worked on the island as a successful trader. In 1932, when Campbell was seven, his mother died from what may have been tuberculosis. The following year, his father also died after becoming an alcoholic. Campbell was sent with his younger brother, Bill, to live with their grandmother in Dunedin, in the South Island of New Zealand. She already had care of their two older siblings. She was however unable to cope with the four children given the Great Depression and sent the children to an orphanage in 1934, where Campbell spent the next six years. In later life, he said that he did not remember the years after his father&#x27;s death due to his grief. Although he spoke little English at the time of the move to New Zealand, he quickly learnt, and found the books in the orphanage to be a refuge from his feelings of abandonment. He attended Otago Boys&#x27; High School, where he did well academically and in sports, but experienced racism from other students due to his Cook Island heritage. He began writing poetry around this time.

He studied first at the University of Otago and then attended Victoria University of Wellington off and on between 1944 and 1952, while working various menial jobs to support himself. His oldest brother, Stuart, was killed while serving with the Māori Battalion in Italy in 1945. At the University of Otago he became good friends with James K. Baxter, another famous New Zealand poet. In 1949 his poem &quot;The Elegy&quot; was published in &quot;Landfall&quot;, marking his first significant publication. It was dedicated to his friend Roy Dickson who had died in a mountaineering accident in 1947, having previously accompanied Campbell on trips to central Otago. The poem was set to music by his friend, composer Douglas Lilburn, in 1951. He became a part of the Wellington Group in the 1950s, a group of poets who saw themselves as having a different perspective to Allen Curnow, another notable New Zealand poet, and through this group became friends with James K. Baxter and others. In this time he was a founder and editor of two literary magazines, &quot;Hilltop&quot; and &quot;Arachne&quot;.

==Literary career==
Campbell&#x27;s first poetry collection, &quot;Mine Eyes Dazzle&quot;, was published in 1950. It was the first book published by the Pegasus Press, and was reprinted in 1951 and 1956. The first part of the book was his poem &quot;The Elegy&quot;, and it also featured love poems about unattainable and beautiful women; the title of the book combined both themes, having been taken from a line in &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;: &quot;Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she died young&quot;. His writing was known for being lyrical and romantic in style, if somewhat dark, and his early poetry did not mention his Cook Islands heritage. In 1953 he graduated from Victoria with a Bachelor of Arts, and the following year he obtained a teaching diploma from Wellington Teachers&#x27; College. In 1952 he married his first wife, the poet Fleur Adcock; they had two sons but divorced six years later. The two remained on good terms in later years.

After obtaining his teaching diploma, Campbell taught for a short period at Newtown School in Wellington, and subsequently became the editor of the &quot;New Zealand School Journal&quot; from 1955 to 1972. He married his second wife, Aline Margaret (Meg) Anderson, in 1958; she was a young actress who would later become a poet herself, and they had a son and two daughters together. In 1961 they moved to Pukerua Bay near Wellington, and would live there for the rest of their lives. In the same year he wrote a novel for children, &quot;The Happy Summer&quot; (1961). 
During his early working life Campbell experienced some mental breakdowns as he recovered from his childhood experiences, and his wife also suffered from severe post-natal depression. These experiences led him to turn to writing and explore his troubles in poetry; in a 1969 interview he said: &quot;It was almost as if the springs of creativity had become iced over ... my nervous breakdown cracked the ice and allowed the spring to flow once more.&quot; He was also inspired by New Zealand&#x27;s history, with a sequence in the collection &quot;Sanctuary of Spirits&quot; (1963) featuring narration by the nineteenth-century Ngāti Toa leader Te Rauparaha. In 2001 the sequence was adapted into a ballet and performed as part of the Kapiti Arts Festival. His third collection, &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, was published by Oxford University Press in 1964. In addition to some new works, it featured some of his earlier poems revised and rearranged for overseas readers. His biographer Nelson Wattie said of the work that &quot;old poems are blended harmoniously with new, so that, more than a retrospective, &quot;Wild Honey&quot; suggests a future for the poet secure on the foundations he had laid and ... a determination to overcome the obstacles his illness had created by stretching the bow between future and past&quot;. In 1965 his poem &quot;The Return&quot; was set to music by Douglas Lilburn, and was Lilburn&#x27;s first major electronic work.

In 1976, a formative experience in Campbell&#x27;s life occurred when he returned to Tongareva, together with his younger brother Bill, and rediscovered his Polynesian heritage and family. The trip had been inspired by a letter Campbell had found in the late 1970s, written by his grandfather to Campbell and his siblings in 1933, which expressed love for them and asked them not to forget their family in Tongareva. He said of the return: &quot;Suddenly, we had a family again. As a long-lost son, I was wept over by old ladies, wailing &#x27;Aue!&#x27; I also had the clear sensation my mother was there, waiting.&quot; From this trip onwards he used his full name, Alistair Te Ariki Campbell. The middle name &quot;Te Ariki&quot; was part of his birth name and meant that his family was of high rank. He had stopped using the name after his move to New Zealand. His Polynesian heritage, which he had begun exploring in the 1960s, from then on became central to his writing and poetry. His 1980 collection, &quot;The Dark Lord of Savaiki&quot;, focussed on his ancestors through his mother&#x27;s side, in particular his grandfather, and his feelings as he came to terms with his heritage. In 1984 he wrote a memoir, &quot;Island to Island&quot;, which traced his life through his childhood in Tongareva and his later return.

From 1972 until 1987 Campbell was the senior editor at the New Zealand Council for Educational Research. From 1987 onwards, Campbell wrote full-time. In addition to his poetry, Campbell also wrote plays such as &quot;The Suicide&quot; (1966) and &quot;When the Bough Breaks&quot; (1970), edited a radio programme about poetry in 1958, wrote a trilogy of novels (&quot;The Frigate Bird&quot; (1989), &quot;Sidewinder&quot; (1991) and &quot;Tia&quot; (1993)), and wrote more novels for children such as &quot;Fantasy with Witches&quot; (1998). He also tutored creative writing, and in the late 1970s, was the President of the New Zealand PEN Centre, the New Zealand branch of PEN International. In 1979 he toured New Zealand with Sam Hunt, Hone Tuwhare and Jan Kemp.

==Later life and legacy==
Campbell wrote about his father&#x27;s and brother&#x27;s experiences in wartime in his later life, with the collection &quot;Gallipoli and Other Poems&quot; (1999) and a poetic sequence called &quot;Māori Battalion&quot; in 2001. Reviewer Iain Sharp wrote that these later works &quot;rank among his strongest work&quot;. Peter Simpson noted that Campbell continued to find &quot;poetry and peace not in repressing his distant past, but in embracing it and exploring it&quot;. After the death of his wife Meg in 2007, Campbell edited a joint collection of their poems called &quot;It&#x27;s Love, Isn&#x27;t It?&quot; which was published in 2008. It was his final collection; on 16 August 2009 he died in Wellington Hospital.

The &quot;Dictionary of New Zealand Biography&quot; says of Campbell that he was &quot;one of New Zealand&#x27;s most distinctive poetic voices from the 1950s to the 2000s ... His work, which combined lyricism and darkness, was shaped by an idyllic Rarotongan childhood, early family tragedies, childhood exile to New Zealand, and a transformative return to Polynesia in middle age.&quot; He received many honours and awards during his career, most notably the New Zealand Book Award for Poetry for his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 1982, the Creative New Zealand Pacific Islands Artist Award in 1998, an honorary doctorate in literature from Victoria University of Wellington in 1999, and a Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement in 2005. In the 2005 New Year Honours, he was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit. On receiving the award, he said: &quot;This finally justifies all those years that I struggled with my demons and chose the path I am still on. This is my wife Meg&#x27;s recognition and makes all the sacrifices worthwhile.&quot;

In 2016 his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; were published by Victoria University Press, with Robert Sullivan noting in the foreword that &quot;Campbell&#x27;s dual Polynesian and Pākehā heritage makes him a foreparent of bicultural and multicultural writing in Aotearoa&quot;. Other New Zealand writers like Albert Wendt have cited him as an influence. In April 2020 New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern recorded a reading of his poem &quot;Gallipoli Peninsula&quot; as part of Anzac Day commemorations for Westminster Abbey.

<doc id="307229" wikidata="Q1351306" url="?curid=307229" title="Regional lockout">
<text>A regional lockout (or region coding) is a class of digital rights management preventing the use of a certain product or service, such as multimedia or a hardware device, outside a certain region or territory. A regional lockout may be enforced through physical means, through technological means such as detecting the user&#x27;s IP address or using an identifying code, or through unintentional means introduced by devices only supporting certain regional technologies (such as video formats, i.e., NTSC and PAL).

A regional lockout may be enforced for several reasons, such as to stagger the release of a certain product, to avoid losing sales to the product&#x27;s foreign publisher, to maximize the product&#x27;s impact in a certain region through localization, to hinder grey market imports by enforcing price discrimination, or to prevent users from accessing certain content in their territory because of legal reasons (either due to censorship laws, or because a distributor does not have the rights to certain intellectual property outside their specified region).

== Multimedia ==

=== Disc regions ===

The DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and UMD media formats all support the use of region coding; DVDs use eight region codes (Region 7 is reserved for future use; Region 8 is used for &quot;international venues&quot;, such as airplanes and cruise ships), and Blu-ray Discs use three region codes corresponding to different areas of the world. Most Blu-rays, however, are region-free. Ultra HD Blu-ray discs are also region-free.

On computers, the DVD region can usually be changed five times. Windows uses three region counters: its own one, the one of the DVD drive, and the one of the player software (occasionally, the player software has no region counter of its own, but uses that of Windows). After the fifth region change, the system is locked to that region. In modern DVD drives (type RPC-2), the region lock is saved to its hardware, so that even reinstalling Windows or using the drive with a different computer will not unlock the drive again.

Unlike DVD regions, Blu-ray regions are verified only by the player software, not by the computer system or the drive. The region code is stored in a file or the registry, and there are hacks to reset the region counter of the player software. In stand-alone players, the region code is part of the firmware.

For bypassing region codes, there are software and multi-regional players available.

A new form of Blu-ray region coding tests not only the region of the player/player software, but also its country code, repurposing a user setting intended for localization (PSR19) as a new form of regional lockout. This means, for example, while both the U.S. and Japan are Region A, some American discs will not play on devices/software configured for Japan or vice versa, since the two countries have different country codes. (For example, the United States is &quot;US&quot; (21843 or hex 0x5553), Japan is &quot;JP&quot; (19024 or hex 0x4a50), and Canada is &quot;CA&quot; (17217 or hex 0x4341).) Although there are only three Blu-ray regions, the country code allows much more precise control of the regional distribution of Blu-ray Discs than the six (or eight) DVD regions.

Since Blu-ray discs are cheaper in America than in Japan, American releases of Japanese anime series are often protected in that way to prevent reversal importations. Some discs check whether the country code is U.S. or Canada (sometimes also Mexico) and play only in these countries, others allow all country codes (even those of non–Region-A countries), except the Japanese.

AnyDVD HD (7.5.9.0 and higher) has an option to enforce the U.S. country code. The software developers say users can also change the country code to enforce in the registry value &quot;bdCountryCode&quot; themselves or set &quot;no country code&quot; by using the value 4294967295 or hex 0xFFFFFFFF. (Before the change of the value, AnyDVD must be closed, and after changing, it must be restarted.)

Some stand-alone Blu-ray players and player programs allow to change the country code (e.g., via the parental lock) and can bypass this protection like that.

=== Software ===
Some features of certain programs are/were disabled if the software is/was installed on a computer in a certain region.

In older versions of the copy software CloneCD, the features &quot;&quot;Amplify Weak Sectors&quot;, &quot;Protected PC Games&quot;,&quot; and &quot;&quot;Hide CDR Media&quot; were disabled in the United States and Japan. Changing the region language settings in Windows (e.g., to Canadian English) or patches could unlock these features in the two countries. SlySoft decided to leave these options disabled for the U.S. for legal reasons, but, strangely enough, in the program &quot;AnyDVD&quot;&quot;, which is also illegal according to U.S. law, no features were disabled. The current version of CloneCD (5.3.1.4) is not region-restricted anymore.

The newer versions of the copy software (9.1.5.0 and higher) come in a U.S. version (with no Blu-ray–ripping feature), which is downloaded if the homepage &quot;dvdfab.cn&quot; identifies a U.S. IP address, and a non-US version (with working Blu-ray–ripping feature). Some webpages allow the download of the non-U.S. version also from the U.S. (they store the non-U.S. version directly and do not use download links to the developer&#x27;s homepage).

The software CCleaner v5.45.6611 has an added check to prevent the use in embargoed countries.

Some programs (e.g., games) are distributed in different versions for NTSC and PAL computers. In some cases, to avoid grey market imports or international software piracy, they are designed not to run on a computer with the wrong TV system. Other programs can run on computers with both TV systems.

Kaspersky Lab sells its anti-virus products at different prices in different regions and uses regionalized activation codes. A program bought in a country of a region can be activated in another country of the region. Once activated, the software can also be used in and download updates from other regions as long as the license is valid. Problems may arise when the license must be renewed, or if the software must be reinstalled, in a region other than the one where it was bought. The region is identified by the IP address (there is no activation possible without Internet connection), so the use of VPN or a proxy is recommended to circumvent the restriction.

The Kaspersky regions are:

* Region 1: Canada, United States, Mexico, and Bermuda
* Region 2: Western Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, Egypt, and Japan
* Region 3: Southeast Asia
* Region 4: Central America, South America (excluding French Guiana), and Oceania; Mexico uses software that uses flags for both regions 1 and 4
* Region 5: Africa, India, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (also includes Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Serbia)
* Region 6: Mainland China
* Region 7: Elsewhere
* Region 8: Special international area (airplane, steamer, etc.)

The desktop versions of HP Pavilion and Compaq Presario are region-locked, according the build is 91UKV6PRA1, for the A6740uk released in 2009. WildTangent EMEA, Magic Desktop will not work on models in the U.S.

The HP FlexBuild regions are:
* USA: United States
* JAP: Japan
* KOR: Korean
* EMEA: Middle East
* TOUCH: Designed for HP Touchsmart only

=== Websites ===

On the internet, geo-blocking is used primarily to control access to online media content that is only licensed for playback in a certain region due to territorial licensing arrangements.

== Video games ==
Regional lockouts in video games have been achieved by several methods, such as hardware/software authentication, slot pin-out change, differences in cartridge cases, IP blocking and online software patching. Most console video games have region encoding.

The main regions are:
* Japan and Asia (NTSC-J)
* Americas (NTSC-U)
* Europe, Oceania, Middle East, India, South Africa (PAL)
* China (NTSC-C)

=== Atari ===
The Atari 2600 does not have regional locking; however, NTSC games can display wrong colors, slow speed and sound on PAL systems, and vice versa.

The Atari 7800 has regional locking on NTSC systems, making PAL games unplayable on them. However, the PAL versions of the Atari 7800 can run NTSC games, but still suffering from the same problems the Atari 2600 had.

The Atari 5200, Lynx and Jaguar are region-free.

=== Nintendo ===
Nintendo was the first console maker to introduce regional locks to its consoles, using them for every one of its home consoles except for the Nintendo Switch. Nintendo has mostly abstained from using them for its handheld consoles.

Games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) were locked through both physical and technical means; the design of cartridges for the NES differed between Japan and other markets, using a different number of pins. As the Famicom (the Japanese model) used slightly smaller cartridges, Japanese games could not fit into NES consoles without an adapter (and even with that, they could still not use the extra sound functionalities of the Famicom due to their differing hardware). Official adapters existed inside early copies of &quot;Gyromite&quot;; other Famicom games could be played by disassembling the cartridge and then swapping out the original board of the game with a different Famicom game&#x27;s board.

Additionally, the NES also contained the 10NES authentication chip; the chip was coded for one of four regions:
* &quot;NTSC&quot; (North America)
* &quot;PAL-A&quot; (United Kingdom, Australia and Italy)
* &quot;PAL-B&quot; (other European countries and South Korea)
* &quot;Asia&quot; (South East Asia, India, and Hong Kong)

A game&#x27;s region is recognized by the console using the 10NES chip. If the chip inside the cartridge conflicts with the chip inside the console, the game will not boot. The 10NES chip also doubled as a form of digital rights management to prevent loading unlicensed or bootleg games. The redesigned Nintendo Entertainment System (Model NES-101) released in 1993/1994 lacks the 10NES chip, and can play PAL and unlicensed games, although Famicom games still need a converter. The Famicom does not include a 10NES chip, but is still unable to play imports unless an adapter is used, due to the different size of the media.
The American Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and the Super Famicom use differences in cartridge cases. A Super NES cartridge will not fit in a Super Famicom/PAL SNES slot due to its different shape and two pieces of plastic in the SNES slot prevent Super Famicom cartridges from being inserted in the SNES. PAL SNES carts can be fully inserted in Japanese consoles, but a similar chip to the 10NES, called the CIC, prevents PAL games from being played in NTSC consoles and vice versa. While physical modification of the cases (either console or cartridges) is needed to play games from the different regions, in order to play games of different TV systems, a hardware modification is also needed. Region locks could be bypassed using special unlicensed cartridge adapters such as Game Genie. The swapping of cartridge shells also bypasses the physical regional lockout.

The Nintendo 64 uses similar lockout methods as the Super NES.

Both the GameCube and Wii are region-locked, and the Wii Shop Channel is also region-locked as well. On the Wii, channels from other regions will refuse to load with the message &quot;This channel can&#x27;t be used.&quot; The coded regions are:
* NTSC-U (The Americas and Asia)
* PAL (Europe and Oceania)
* NTSC-J (Japan)
* NTSC-K (South Korea)

The GameCube and Wii&#x27;s regional lockout can be bypassed either by console modification or simply by third-party software. Datel&#x27;s FreeLoader or Action Replay discs are most notable.

The Wii U and its Gamepads are also region-locked.

The Nintendo Switch is region-free, and therefore allows for games from any region to be played, whether through physical cartridges or digital downloads. For instance, games from the Nintendo eShop can be purchased and downloaded regardless of region.

The only exception to this is the Chinese version of the Nintendo Switch distributed by Tencent in mainland China. This version of the console can still play cartridge-based games from any region; however, they can only connect to Chinese servers. Thus, it cannot access any game updates, DLC or online modes from games in other regions, or download said games digitally. Conversely, all other versions of the Nintendo Switch are unable to play cartridge-based games made by Tencent specifically for the Chinese Nintendo Switch.

All Nintendo handheld consoles except both Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS models are fully region-free. In the case of the former, only the physical and digital games that cannot be played on earlier DS models are region-locked. The latter&#x27;s region lock strictly applies to all software designed for it, with the only exception being the application &quot;Nintendo 3DS Guide: Louvre&quot;, which is not a game in of itself, but rather as an application that serves as a guide for visitors of the Louvre Museum. Similar to the Wii, the 3DS&#x27;s regional lockout can be bypassed by third-party software or custom firmware such as Luma3DS.

=== Sony ===
The PlayStation and PlayStation 2 are region-locked into three regions: NTSC U/C, NTSC-J, and PAL. It is possible to disable region locking on said systems via a modchip or by performing a disk-swap when the console starts. In the case of the PlayStation 2, a special disc known as the Swap Magic can be used to bypass regional locks. DVD movies on the PlayStation 2 are also region-locked.

All PlayStation 3 games except for &quot;Persona 4 Arena&quot; and &quot;Way of the Samurai 3&quot; are region free. Although publishers could choose to region-lock specific games based on a mechanism that allows for the game to query the model of the PS3, none did so during the first three years after the PS3&#x27;s launch. In the case of &quot;Persona 4 Arena&quot;; publisher Atlus declined to reverse its decision despite substantial outcry by some of their fanbase. The decision was made to avoid excessive importing, because all versions of the game share the same features and language support, but have differing price points and release dates in each region. They did, however, decide not to apply regionlocking to its sequel (&quot;Persona 4 Arena Ultimax&quot;). Region locking is present for backwards-compatible PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games, as well as DVD and Blu-ray movies. Additionally, some games separate online players per region, such as &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;.

The PlayStation Store only contains content for its own country. For example, the EU store will not supply usable map packs for an imported U.S. copy of &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;. In addition, downloadable content for the PlayStation 3 systems is region-matched with the game itself. For example, DLC from the U.S. PlayStation Store must be used in conjunction with a U.S.–region game. More specifically, the PS3&#x27;s file system includes region-of-origin, so DLC cannot be shared between different region games much like save files cannot. Also, the PSN Store is tied to each user&#x27;s PSN account, and payment methods for PSN is also region-locked. For example, a user with a Japanese PSN account will only be able to access the Japanese PSN store despite owning a U.S. PS3, and can only pay for a game with a Japanese PSN gift card or Japanese credit card. However, with a few rare exceptions, notably &quot;Joysound Dive&quot;, downloaded content from each PSN store are also region free, as are PSOne and PS2 classics offered on the store.

The regions include:

Although PlayStation Portable has no region locking for UMD games, UMD movies are locked by region. However, Sony has confirmed that it is possible to implement regionlocking on the PSP, and the firmware will disable features based on region. For example, Asian region PSPs will not display the &quot;Extras&quot; option on the XMB despite having been upgraded to the U.S. version of Firmware 6.20, preventing owners of such PSPs from installing the Comic Book Viewer and the TV Streaming applications. As the applications are installed through a PC, and users from the region are not blocked from downloading them, it is possible to install them on non-Asian PSPs that have been imported into the region.

While PlayStation Vita games had the potential to be region-locked, all games released for the system are region-free.

Like with the PlayStation 3, the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 are not region-locked, although it is still possible to develop region-locked games. Sony&#x27;s official stance is that they discourage developers from region-locking and will only relent in special cases (as with the PS3 &quot;Persona 4 Arena&quot;). However, as with the PlayStation 3, digital content such as downloadable content for games still requires a PSN account from the region the content was made for. That said, PSN accounts themselves are not region-locked and an account for one region can be made on a console from another one.

PlayStation 5 game discs no longer have region codes. The region variant of a game can be identified by the rating label and SKU ID on the spine of the disc case.

=== Sega ===
The SG-1000 does not have region lockout between Japanese and Australian systems, the same applies with SC-3000 games on cartridge and cassettes, as well SF-7000 disks.

WesternSega Master Systems have a different shape from the Japanese cartridge connector, meaning Sega Mark III and SG-1000 games are incompatible with it. A BIOS included prevents Japanese cartridges (both Mark III and SG-1000) to be used on Western systems, even with adapters. The Sega Card slot on these systems has the same pinout from its Japanese counterpart, but they cannot run Japanese and SG-1000 cards due to lack of a certain code in the ROM header. This can be circumvented by removing the BIOS IC from it. However, some European-only games such as &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; will refuse to boot on NTSC systems. Japanese games can be run on Power Base Converter with use of adapters, but it will not run SG-1000 games, regardless of region.
Japanese Sega Mega Drive cartridges have a different shape and will not fit in the Genesis or PAL Mega Drive slot, which have the same shape (although the Genesis 3 in the U.S. will accept Japanese titles due to its wider slot.) Japanese Mega Drive systems have a piece of plastic that slides in a place of the cartridge when the power switch is turned on, thus, inserting an American or European cart will make it impossible to use on a Japanese Mega Drive (though minor modifications to the plastic locks in the systems will bypass this). The console&#x27;s main board, however, was designed with language and frequency jumper sets which originally activated features in the same ROM for different regions. This feature was later used to enable software-based regional locks that display warning messages that prevent the game from being played. Switches, instead of the jumpers, were used to bypass the locks. In region-locked games, if there is a multiple language feature, it can be changed with the switches after the game has booted-up (as with the case of &quot;Cyber Brawl&quot; / &quot;Cosmic Carnage&quot; for the Super 32X). Despite the console itself being regionlocked, most of the games, especially ones made by Sega, were region-free and could be played on any region, unless the cartridge doesn&#x27;t fit the console.

The Game Gear is region free, and some games have a dual-language feature depending on which region of the system is used. &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; (game title changes to &quot;Puzlow Kids&quot; on Western systems) and &quot;Donald no Magical World&quot; (title changes to &quot;Ronald McDonald in Magical World&quot; in Western systems), are both Japan-exclusive games, but if run on Western units, they will be fully translated.

Sega CD/Mega-CD games are region-locked. The region can be changed when making CD-R copies; however, this method is not completely foolproof (e.g., &quot;Sengoku Denshou&quot; in American consoles will freeze on the Sega license screen with a region-swapped CD-R copy). Furthermore, third party accessories exist that can bypass the regional-lockouts of Sega Mega-CD games, inserted into the main console&#x27;s cartridge slot. Flashcarts such as the Everdrive can also be used to boot any regional Mega-CD BIOS from the SD card. Different region Mega-CD consoles will also work with different region Mega Drive/Genesis systems; however, they often carry the risk of damaging the add-on if the proper voltage converters are not used. The power voltages for the add-on will vary depending on the region, therefore requiring voltage converters to prevent damage to the add-on. For instance, the Japanese Mega-CD will work in the Genesis; however, it does not use the same AC voltage as the Genesis or the American Sega CD. Likewise, the European Mega-CD will work on a Japanese Mega Drive or Genesis, but the differences in AC voltage are more staggering compared to a Japanese Mega-CD in a Genesis. In such cases, using a step-up (or step-down) converter is recommended.

Most American Sega Saturn discs can be played in Japanese consoles, but most Japanese games are locked for American and European consoles. Like in the Mega Drive/Genesis, the use of a switch will circumvent the region-lock, but won&#x27;t change the language. In addition, the use of certain unlicensed backup/RAM cartridges will also allow a console to play games from different regions, except for games that use proprietary ROM-RAM carts. Games from different television systems may have graphical problems.

Dreamcast GD-ROM discs are region-locked; however, this could be circumvented with the use of boot discs. MIL-CDs and backup CDs are region-free.

=== Microsoft ===
The Xbox and the Xbox 360 are region-locked, but some games are region-free and will play in any region. Digital content through Xbox Live on the Xbox 360 and original Xbox are also region-locked, such as DLC, movies, and apps.

The Xbox One was initially planned to have a region blocking policy that would have prevented its use outside its region in an effort to curb parallel importing. Microsoft later reversed the policy and the final retail version of the console was not region-locked. It was reported, though, that the console would be region-locked in China; however, this decision has since been reverted as of April 2015.

The Xbox Series X is region-free.

=== Other ===
The Philips CD-i and the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer are region-free. Japanese 3DO units, however, have a kanji font in ROM, which is required by a few games. When such games can&#x27;t find the font, they can get locked or rendered unplayable.

The Neo Geo, Neo Geo CD, and Neo Geo Pocket line are also region-free.

Amongst PC games, regional lockout is more difficult to enforce because both the game application and the operating system can be easily modified. Subscription-based online games often enforce a regional lock by blocking IP addresses (which can often be circumvented through an open proxy) or by requiring the user to enter a national ID number (which may be impossible to verify). A number of other games using regional lockout are rare but do exist. One of the examples of this is the Windows version of &quot;The Orange Box&quot;, which uses Steam to enforce the regional lockout. Steam also enforces a form of regional lockout in adherence to German law by offering to German users special versions of some games with banned contentmost notably swastikasreplaced. Steam is also used to restrict the release of the PC port of &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot; to US and Europe only due to Sony having an exclusivity deal with Konami in Asia, and to restrict the Asian release of the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy to Japanese-only versions of the games. Besides the law and licensing issues, there is also a financial reason for Steam to region lock their games, since in Russia and other CIS countries prices of games on Steam are much lower than in the EU or North America.

== Printers ==
Hewlett-Packard printer cartridges have been regionalised since 2004. Thus, they do not work in printers with a different region code, unless the user calls technical support for the device to be reassigned to the appropriate region.

HP printers have four regions:
# Americas, Greenland, Australia, New Zealand, Koreas, Mongolia, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, East Asia
# Western Europe, Turkey
# CIS, Africa, Near East, Japan
# China (except Hong Kong), Taiwan and India

The region can be changed three times; then, the printer will be locked to a region.

Lexmark printers use different region-coding systems:

a) e.g., OfficeEdge Pro4000, OfficeEdge Pro4000c, OfficeEdge Pro5500, OfficeEdge Pro5500t, CS310, CS410 Color Laser Printer
# Americas
# Greenland, EU, EFTA
# (in CS310, CS410 Color Laser Printer called Region 8): Former Yugoslavian states, except for EU members Croatia and Slovenia, and rest of world (East Europe, Africa, Near East, Asia, Australia)

b) e.g., MS710, MS810 Monochrome Laser Printer
# USA, Canada
# Greenland, EU, EFTA
# Asia, Australia, New Zealand
# Central and South America
# Former Yugoslavian states (except Croatia and Slovenia), Eastern Europe, Turkey, Near East, Africa

Canon print cartridges for the Pixma MP 480 will not work in printers of that type with a different region code either (even when listed on the packaging of the Canon printer cartridges in question).

Epson ink cartridges are also use region-coded.

Xerox also uses region codes. Their printers are shipped with neutral &quot;factory&quot; ink sticks with no region coding. Upon the installation of the first new ink stick after these factory sticks, the machine will set a region code based on the installed ink stick and will only accept ink stick for that region from that point forward. &quot;Officially,&quot; only three starter ink sticks per color can be used; then, the printer will no longer accept them and will want region-coded ink sticks to be inserted, but there are workarounds for that problem.

Common region settings are:
* NA (North America)
* Metered-NA
* DMO (developing markets, such as Asia and South America)
* XE (Europe).

=== Circumvention ===
One method to bypass printer-region-coding is to store empty cartridges from the old region and refill them with the ink of cartridges from the new region, but many modern ink cartridges have chips and sensors to prevent refilling, which makes the process more difficult. On the Internet, one can find refilling instructions for various cartridge models. Another method is have ink cartridges from the old region shipped to the new region.

Some manufacturers of regionalized printers also offer region-free printers specially designed for travelers.

== Smartphones, tablets, and computers ==

=== Samsung devices ===
Starting from the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Samsung phones and tablets contained a warning label stating that it would only operate with SIM cards from the region the phone was sold in. A spokesperson clarified the policy, stating that it was intended to prevent grey-market reselling, and that it only applied to the first SIM card inserted. For devices to use a SIM card from other regions, one of the following actions totaling five minutes or longer in length must first be performed with the SIM card from the local region:

* Make calls on the phone or watch from the Samsung Phone app
* Use the Call and Text on Other Devices feature to make calls

==== Changes for 2017 ====
Samsung has changed the region locking policy completely since it was first introduced in 2013. Previously, the CSC was generally decided based on which region the phone was meant for, and it could be changed by user input. The SIM card now plays a central role in deciding what CSC is active.

===== South Korea, US, Canada, and China =====
If the phone/tablet was purchased in any of these countries and the SIM card is from a different region, they cannot be used together. Although the restriction can be removed after using a local SIM card to make a call for at least five minutes, it only removes the restrictions for that particular country. Furthermore, the device may not work properly in some circumstances, such as Samsung Pay. An unlocked device purchased in these above markets can only work on other service providers within the same market where the device was purchased from, and so on, despite having the bands to work on other networks. For example, if one buys an XAA/OYM device in the United States but one is now living in China and using a Chinese SIM, the active CSC will not be changed to CHC/OYM, because the firmware does not include CHC in the multi-CSC file. As a result, the new SIM card cannot be used in a device made for another market.

====== Phones ======
* N: South Korea
* U/U1: United States of America
* W: Canada
* 0: China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao

====== Tablets ======
* N: South Korea
* U/U1: United States
* W: Canada
* C: China mainland

===== All other regions =====
The same rules still apply as usual; however, not all the countries will be unlocked for use. For example, if one buys a DBT/OXM device in Germany, but one is now living in Portugal and using a Portuguese SIM, the active CSC is potentially TPH/OXM, which makes the new SIM card usable in the new region.

====== Phones ======
* E: Latin America &amp; Caribbean, Middle East &amp; North Africa, India, Asia Pacific
* B: Europe &amp; CIS

====== Tablets ======
All countries except for South Korea, USA, Canada, and mainland China fall in the B section.

==== Country Specific Codes (CSCs) for Samsung devices ====

===== Wi-Fi only devices =====
As of 2022, Samsung has simplified most CSCs into a larger one. Assume that all service providers are supported for each region. For example, if one buys an XAR/OXM tablet in the United States but one is now living in Taiwan and using a Chinese phone with a Taiwanese SIM card paired to an XAR tablet, the active CSC on both devices is potentially BRI/OXM, which makes the paired phone usable in the new region. However, if the SIM card is from mainland China, it cannot be paired with the tablet, since mainland China (CHN) is not part of the OXM multi-CSC file.

====== OXM ======
With the release of the Galaxy Tab S8 series, Southeast Asia is now Asia Pacific (APAC does not include Indonesia, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan or China (Mainland China and Hong Kong)).
* KOO: South Korea
* XAR: North America (USA)
* XAC: North America (Canada)
* MXO: Latin America (Mexico)
* ZBR: Latin America (Other)
* EUX: Europe (1)
* EUY: Europe (2)
* SER: CIS (Russia)
* SEK: CIS (Ukraine)
* CAU: CIS (Caucasus)
* ILO: Middle East (Israel)
* TUR: Middle East (Turkey)
* XSG: Middle East (Other, formerly UAE)
* INU: India
* XSP: Asia Pacific (formerly Singapore/Southeast Asia)
* BRI: Taiwan

===== Cellular devices =====
* OKR: South Korea (cellular devices only)
* OYM/OYN: United States (cellular devices only)
* OYA/OYV: Canada (cellular devices only)
* OWB/OWO/OWE: Latin America and the Caribbean (some devices)
* OJM: Middle East (including Israel) and Africa (some devices)
* ODM/ODI: India/South Asia (some devices)
* OLM/OLN/OLO: Southeast Asia (excluding Indonesia) and Oceania (some devices)
* OLE/OLP: Indonesia (all devices, except smartwatches)
* OXE: Post-Soviet states (some devices)
* CHN/CHC: Mainland China (all devices)
* OZS: Taiwan and Hong Kong (smartphones only)
* XJP/SJP: Japan (some devices)
* OXM: Europe/All other countries (including US/Canada/South Korea/Hong Kong/Taiwan Wi-Fi only devices, as well as Hong Kong/Taiwan cellular tablets)
As of the Galaxy Tab S6, Wi-Fi only devices are no longer region locked, and the Call and Text on Other Devices features on those devices can work on SIM cards from most regions (excluding mainland China and Indonesia). All regions (except for mainland China and Indonesia) share the same CSC in their firmware version.

Starting with Windows Phone 7 for mobile devices and Windows 8 for computers, not all display languages are preinstalled/available for download on all devices with an OEM license of Windows. Users may not see all the display languages listed as options on the device or as options available for download as separate language packs. These exact options depend on the device manufacturer and country/region of purchase (and the mobile operator, if the device features cellular connectivity). Microsoft believes region locking is necessary because these display languages (which contains additional features like text suggestions, speech languages, and supplementary fonts) can take up a significant amount of storage, which leaves less space for data and media and impacts device performance. For cellular-connected devices, some mobile operators may choose not to support particular languages. For example, a wireless carrier in North America may not feel comfortable supporting European languages.

=== Google Play store ===
Starting from June 2021, Google began enforcing region-locking by preventing users from redeeming Google Play gift cards of other countries, despite user attempts to alter location with usage of VPNs. Detection is based on location history tracking and device fingerprint activity data associated with a user&#x27;s Google account usage history.

=== Apple devices ===
There are provisions in place to restrict iOS features in specific locations, which include both hard-coding techniques (e.g., device model variants for different countries) and soft-coding techniques. For example, FaceTime is not available in the UAE, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia due to government restrictions on VoIP services.

An inspection of iOS 16.2&#x27;s code showed a new system internally called &quot;countryd&quot; was added to precisely determine the user&#x27;s location, to enforce restrictions determined by government regulators. The system gathers multiple data sources, such as: current GPS location, country code from the Wi-Fi router, and information obtained from the SIM card to determine the user&#x27;s current country.

==== Exclusive features for the European Union ====
In March 2024, Apple released iOS 17.4, introducing a distinct set of additional features for the European Union residents to comply with the Digital Markets Act. The expanded features include: installation of apps from alternative marketplaces, installation of web browsers with alternative engines, management of default web browser settings, utilization of alternative payment methods in the app store.

To prevent non-EU users from accessing the additional features introduced in iOS 17.4, Apple has put in place measures which include: requiring a user&#x27;s Apple ID region to be set to one of the EU&#x27;s 27 member states, and performing routine on-device geolocation checks to ensure a user is physically present within the EU&#x27;s borders. Users who travel out of the EU can continue accessing alternative app marketplaces for a grace period of 30 days. Users who are away from the EU for too long would lose access to these features; they can continue using previously installed apps but are unable to update or install apps from 3rd party app stores.

<text>The Gran Teatre del Liceu (; ; ), or simply Liceu, is a theater in Barcelona, Spain. Situated on La Rambla, it is the city&#x27;s oldest theater building still in use for its original purpose. 

Founded in 1837 at another location, the Liceu opened at its current address on 4 April 1847. The theater was rebuilt after fires in 1861 and 1994, and reopened on 20 April 1862 and 7 October 1999. On 7 November 1893, on the opening night of the season, an anarchist threw two bombs into the stalls. About twenty people were killed, and many more were injured.

Between 1847 and 1989, the 2,338-seat Liceu was the largest opera house in Europe by capacity. Since 1994, the Liceu has been owned and managed by a public foundation whose board of trustees represents the Ministry of Culture, the Generalitat de Catalunya, the Provincial Deputation of Barcelona and the City Council of Barcelona. The theater has its own choir (the Cor del Gran Teatre del Liceu), symphony orchestra (the Orquestra Simfònica del Gran Teatre del Liceu) and college of music (the Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu).

==History==
===Origins (1837–1847)===
In 1837, the Liceo Filodramático de Montesión (Philodramatic Lyceum of Montesión, now named Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu) was founded in Barcelona to promote musical education (hence the name &quot;Liceo&quot;, or lyceum.) It organized opera productions performed by Liceo students.

A theater (Teatro de Montesión, or Teatro del Liceo de Montesión) was founded in a convent building, and plays and operas were performed. The first performance was Vicenzo Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot;, on 3 February 1838. The repertoire was Italian, the most-performed composers were Donizetti, Mercadante, Bellini and Rossini. The Barcelona premiere of Hérold&#x27;s &quot;Zampa&quot; was held here.

In 1838, the society changed its name to Liceo Dramático Filarmónico de S. M. la Reina Isabel II (Dramatic Philharmonic Lyceum of H.M. Queen Isabel II). Lack of space and pressure from the nuns who formerly owned the convent and had the right to return motivated the Liceu to leave its location in 1844. The last performance there was on 8 September of that year.

The Trinitarian convent building in Barcelona&#x27;s central La Rambla was purchased, and the Liceu&#x27;s managers entrusted Joaquim de Gispert d&#x27;Anglí with construction of a new building. Two societies were created: a &quot;building society&quot; and an &quot;auxiliary building society.&quot; Shareholders of the building society obtained the permanent right of use of some theater boxes and seats in exchange for their economic contributions. Auxiliary-building-society shareholders contributed the rest of the money necessary in exchange for rights to other spaces in the building, including some shops and the private Círculo del Liceo club.

Unlike other European cities where the monarchy was responsible for the building and upkeep of opera houses, the Liceu was funded by private shareholders of what would become the Societat del Gran Teatre del Liceu (Great Liceu Theater Society, organized similarly to a trading company or &quot;societat&quot;). This is reflected in the building&#x27;s architecture; there is no royal box. Since the queen did not contribute to construction, the society&#x27;s name was changed to Liceo Filarmónico Dramático. 

With Miquel Garriga i Roca as the architect, construction began on 11 April 1845. The theater was opened on 4 April 1847.

===Opening, fire and rebuilding (1847–1862)===
The opening presented a mixed program which included the premieres of a José Melchior Gomis musical ouverture, the historical play &quot;Don Fernando de Antequera&quot; by Ventura de la Vega, the ballet &quot;La Rondeña&quot; (&quot;The Girl From Ronda&quot;) by Josep Jurch, and the cantata &quot;Il regio himene&quot; with music by Liceu musical director Marià Obiols. The first complete opera, Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena,&quot; was presented on 17 April 1847. 

Liceu was the biggest opera house in Europe, with 3,500 seats. Other operas performed during the first year were (in chronological order) &quot;I due Foscari&quot; (Verdi), &quot;Il bravo&quot; (Mercadante), &quot;Parisina d&#x27;Este&quot; (Donizetti), &quot;Giovanna d&#x27;Arco&quot; (Verdi), &quot;Leonora&quot; (Mercadante), &quot;Ernani&quot; (Verdi), &quot;Norma&quot; (Bellini), &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot; (Donizetti) and &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; (Rossini).

The building was severely damaged by fire on 9 April 1861, but was rebuilt with a design by architect Josep Oriol Mestres and re-opened on 20 April 1862 with a performance of Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot;. Of the old building, only the facade, the entrance hall and the foyer (Hall of Mirrors) remained.

===Bombing and civil war (1862–1940)===
On 7 November 1893, during the season&#x27;s opening night and the second act of Rossin&#x27;s opera &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, two Orsini bombs were thrown into the Liceu&#x27;s stalls. Although only one of the bombs exploded, about twenty people were killed and many more were injured. The attack by anarchist Santiago Salvador shocked Barcelona, and became symbolic of the era&#x27;s social unrest. The Liceu re-opened its doors on 18 January 1894, but the seats occupied by those killed were not used for a number of years. The second bomb was displayed at the Van Gogh Museum in 2007, during the exhibition &quot;Barcelona around 1900&quot;.

In 1909, the auditorium was renovated. Spanish neutrality during World War I allowed the Catalan textile industry to amass enormous wealth by supplying the warring parties. The 1920s were prosperous; the Liceu became established, welcoming leading singers, conductors and companies such as Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes.

When the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed in 1931, political instability triggered a financial crisis for the Liceu which was overcome with subsidies from the Barcelona City Council and the regional Catalonia government. The theater was nationalized during the Spanish Civil War and was renamed Teatre del Liceu – Teatre Nacional de Catalunya (Liceu Opera House – the National Theater of Catalonia); its opera seasons were suspended. After the civil war, in 1939, the Liceu was returned to its original owners.

===&quot;Silver Age&quot; and crisis (1940–1980)===
From 1940 to the 1960s, the seasons were high-quality. In 1955 the Bayreuth Festival Company visited. They performed &quot;Parsifal&quot;, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, with innovative sets by Wieland Wagner and were enthusiastically received. An economic crisis affected the theater during the 1970s; the privately-based organization could not afford the increasing cost of modern opera productions, and overall quality declined.

===New direction and second fire (1980–1994)===
The death of in 1980 revealed the need for the intervention of official bodies if the Liceu was to remain a leading opera house. In 1981, the Generalitat de Catalunya, Barcelona&#x27;s City Council and the Societat del Gran Teatre del Liceu created the Consorci del Gran Teatre del Liceu (Consortium of the Great Liceu Theater) responsible for the theater&#x27;s management.

The Provincial Deputation of Barcelona and the Spanish Ministry of Culture joined the consortium in 1985 and 1986, respectively. The consortium attracted the public back to the Liceu quickly with improvements in its artistic standard. This included a more complete and up-to-date perspective of the nature of an opera performance, improvements to the choir and orchestra, careful casting, and attracting public interest to aspects of productions other than the leading roles. This approach, coupled with new economic support and a more-discerning public, resulted in quality productions.

The consortium maintained high standards in casting, production and public loyalty (measured by attendance) until a 31 January 1994 fire which destroyed the building, caused by a spark that fell on the curtain during a routine repair during the run of Paul Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Mathis der Maler.&quot; The following opera was scheduled to be Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;.

Public and institutional response was unanimous on the need to rebuild the opera house on the same site with improved facilities. The new Liceu is the result of efforts to preserve parts of the building unaffected by the fire which had also survived the 1861 fire. The auditorium was rebuilt with the same layout, with new the roof paintings by Perejaume and state-of-the-art stage technology.

The theater became public to rebuild and improve it. The Fundació del Gran Teatre del Liceu (Great Liceu Theater Foundation) was created, and the Societat del Gran Teatre del Liceu handed over ownership of the building to the foundation. Some stakeholders disagreed with the decision, which was unsuccessfully challenged in court.

=== Reopening (1994–present) ===
From 1994 until the Liceu&#x27;s reopening in 1999, Barcelona&#x27;s opera seasons were performed in the Palau Sant Jordi arena (some large-scale performances in 1994), Palau de la Música Catalana, and Teatre Victòria. The rebuilt, improved and expanded theater opened on 7 October 1999 with Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;, the next opera in the season at the time of the 1994 fire. The new venue had the same traditional horseshoe-shaped auditorium, with improved technical, rehearsal, office and educational facilities, a new rehearsal hall, a new chamber-opera and small-performance hall, and more public space. The architects for the rebuilding were Ignasi de Solà-Morales and Xavier Fabré i Lluís Dilmé.

Surtitles, projected onto a screen above the proscenium, are used for all opera performances and some lieder concerts. An electronic libretto system provides translations (into English, Spanish or Catalan) on small, individual monitors for most seats.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Liceu marked Spain&#x27;s lockdown end with a performance for an audience of 2,292 house plants which was livestreamed on social media. Each plant was then donated to healthcare workers at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.

== Building ==
The theater is in La Rambla, in downtown Barcelona. It has two facades, since the other two sides were surrounded until 1994 by residential buildings.

Some parts of the earlier building remain:

* The main façade in La Rambla (1847)
* The hall and the staircase (1861), with a Vallmitjana statue of Music (1901)
* The romantically-ornamental foyer (Saló de Miralls, or Hall of Mirrors, 1847), with paintings of musicians, singers and dancers from the era of Pasta, Rubini, Donizetti, Bellini, Gluck, and Marie Taglioni. It was partially redecorated in 1877 by Elies Rogent, and the roof painting of the Parnassus dates to this period.

The auditorium was rebuilt after the 1994 fire as an improved recreation of the 1861 auditorium. It has a seating capacity of 2,292 (making the Liceu one of Europe&#x27;s largest opera houses), and is a typical Italian horseshoe-shaped theater with a maximum length and width of . The auditorium has a &quot;platea&quot; (main floor) and five balconies. Boxes with small rooms attached are in front of the stage, on the &quot;platea&quot; and in some galleries. There are no significant physical divisions between boxes; a low screen separates one box from another. There are no columns in the theater except inside the &quot;platea&quot;, making the balconies look like a golden horseshoe without visual interruptions. The &quot;amfiteatre ubicare&quot; is a projection of the first balcony with a less-pronounced horseshoe shape accommodating three rows of seats, considered the best in the theater.

Building expenses were covered by the sale of boxes and seats. Boxes were lavishly decorated by their owners, but they were destroyed in the 1994 fire. The proscenium reproduces the old one, which was rebuilt in 1909. It has a large central arch with two Corinthian columns on both sides and, among the columns, four tiers of boxes. These wider, more-luxurious boxes are known as &quot;banyeres&quot; (&quot;bathtubs&quot;).

The auditorium ornamentation reproduces that of 1909: sumptuous, with the golden and polychrome plaster moldings usual in 19th-century European theaters. Its brass lamps have glass in the shape of a drake. The stalls, on the main floor, are made of strained iron and red velvet.

Modern features were introduced in the reconstruction. The eight circular paintings in the roof and the three in the proscenium, lost in the fire, have been re-created by the contemporary artist Perejaume. The stage curtain is by Catalan designer . The new hemispheric lamp in the center of the roof is a platform for technical facilities (lighting, sound and computer).

Other technical facilities are control and projecting cabins in some balconies, a &quot;technical floor&quot; over the roof, and high-tech equipment to record and broadcast performances. With computerized cameras, the auditorium can also be used for live or recorded televised performances. Stage facilities are modern, allowing quick scene changes and the simultaneous use of four different sets.

A new foyer was built under the main auditorium for the main bar and restaurant and for concerts, small-format performances, lectures, cultural activities, and meetings. The Liceu station of the Barcelona Metro line 3 is adjacent to the theater.

==Artistic history==
===Performed works===
The Liceu is a receiving and producing house, with two or three new productions staged each year. Its company consists of a permanent orchestra and choir and singers for supporting roles. Leading roles are usually sung by guest singers. Stagecraft is produced internally by the theater (alone or with other opera houses) and rented from other houses. Until the 1990s, the Liceu also had a ballet company. Most of the operas performed are from 19th-century Italy and Germany: Verdi, Wagner, &quot;bel canto&quot; composers and, more recently, Puccini, Richard Strauss and Mozart.

The history of Liceu premieres illustrates the evolution of European operatic tastes. Opera was only a part of its artistic activities at first, alternating with &quot;zarzuela&quot; (Spanish light opera), romantic ballet (&quot;Giselle&quot; had its first Barcelona performance in 1847), theatrical performances, and magic shows.

The first operas performed, Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I due Foscari&quot;, are emblematic of the taste for &quot;bel canto&quot; and Italian romantic melodrama: Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, and Verdi. They are still in the repertory, and Verdi is the most-performed composer.

The first operas by non-Italian composers which were put on at the Liceu were Ferdinand Hérold&#x27;s &quot;Zampa&quot; (1848), Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; (1849), Giacomo Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Robert le diable&quot;, Auber&#x27;s &quot;La muette de Portici&quot; (1852) and &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; (1853). These were sung in Italian, the custom at the time.

The first performances of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (1854) and &quot;La traviata&quot; (1855) led to the crowning of Giuseppe Verdi as the king of opera. In 1866, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; was staged at the Liceu for the first time.

In 1883, Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; was first performed. From the 1880s to the 1950s, Wagner was one of the most beloved and highly-regarded composers at the Liceu. It staged the first performance of &quot;Parsifal&quot; outside Bayreuth on 31 December 1913, after the Bayreuth monopoly ended, with Francesc Viñas in the title role and conducted by Franz Beidler. In 1955, the Bayreuth Festival company visited the theater and performed three operas.

&quot;Verismo&quot;, especially Puccini, is a late-19th-century tradition. The first Russian opera was staged in 1915 with great success, and Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky were often performed. 

Early in the 20th century, Richard Strauss conducted his works. Siegfried Wagner conducted a concert in 1904, followed a year later by Pietro Mascagni.

In 1915, impresario Mestres Calvet broadened the repertory and introduced composers such as de Falla and Stravinsky. It was a golden age for Russian and German operas, which were now sung in their original language. Mestres also was associated, beginning in 1917, with the success of Diaghilev&#x27;s ballets with Vaslav Nijinsky, Léonide Massine, Lydia Lopokova, Chernicheva and other dancers. Years later, Anna Pavlova also performed at the Liceu.

In 1947, the directing company came into the hands of Arquer and Pàmias. In contrast with the preceding years, which had been marked by programming of the great repertory works, the first season of the new directorship renewed the repertoire with the first performances in Barcelona of about 100 works by a number of composers. Revivals featured Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, which had first been staged at the Liceu one hundred years earlier. For 33 years, Pàmias led Liceu activity when it seemed impossible to maintain the opera house without official aid.

The Liceu&#x27;s repertory has included the world&#x27;s most-performed titles since the 1950s, including nearly all the great 20th-century composers (Bartók, Honegger, Gershwin, Berg, Janáček, Weill, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Britten, Schönberg, and Hindemith) and the baroque and classical composers Monteverdi, Handel and Gluck. Ballet remains an important part of the theater&#x27;s activities, with performances by some of the world&#x27;s best-known companies (including the Béjart Ballet).

====Stage directors and stagecraft====
During the second half of the 19th century, a school of stagecraft and theatrical scenery was developed at the Liceu. After beginning with Joan Ballester, who was known for his sets for &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, the leading set designer was Francesc Soler i Rovirosa. The style was realistic, using painted paper flats and curtains. Sets and costumes were made in the theater workshops. From the 1900s to the 1930s, the school was represented by scenery painters who included Maurici Vilomara, Fèlix Urgellés, Salvador Alarma and Oleguer Junyent. The last of these painters was Josep Mestres Cabanes, who painted scenery from 1930 to the 1950s.

==Círculo del Liceo==
The Círculo del Liceo is a private club in the Liceu building. The &quot;Círculo&quot; opened in November 1847 with 125 founding members, according to its earliest records. The club has lounges, conference rooms, a restaurant, a library and other amenities. 

For its first 150 years, only men could join; women were allowed access as guests of male members. In 2001, after controversy about the club&#x27;s exclusively-male membership, its constitution was amended and ten women (including Montserrat Caballé and relatives of existing members) were permitted to apply for membership. All ten were turned down, but were admitted after a subsequent vote by members (373 votes in favor and 279 against). The club has about one thousand members.

The Círculo del Liceo is Spain&#x27;s oldest club still at its original location. The club has accumulated a number of artistic works, and many of its rooms are decorated in Art Nouveau style. Four large windows in the low foyer attest the influence of Wagnerism in Catalan culture at the beginning of the 20th century.

In addition to its furniture and decor, the club has a collection of sculptures, marquetry, enamels, engravings, etchings and paintings by Catalan artists who include Alexandre de Riquer, Santiago Rusiñol, Modest Urgell Inglada and Francesc Miralles. The club&#x27;s most notable art is a set of twelve oils on fabric, commissioned to Ramon Casas and installed in its rotunda. Each of the twelve paintings, Casas&#x27; most ambitious work, is inspired by a musical subject.
