<text>Robert Keith McFerrin Jr. (born March 11, 1950) is an American singer, songwriter, and conductor. His vocal techniques include singing fluidly but with quick and considerable jumps in pitch—for example, sustaining a melody while also rapidly alternating with arpeggios and harmonies—as well as scat singing, polyphonic overtone singing, and improvisational vocal percussion. He performs and records regularly as an unaccompanied solo vocal artist. He has frequently collaborated with other artists from both the jazz and classical scenes.

McFerrin&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, Be Happy&quot; is the only acapella track to ever reach No. 1 in the US, which it reached in 1988 and additionally won Song of the Year and Record of the Year honors at the 1989 Grammy Awards. McFerrin has also worked in collaboration with jazz fusion instrumentalists including pianists Chick Corea (of Return to Forever), Herbie Hancock (of The Headhunters), and Joe Zawinul (of Weather Report), drummer Tony Williams, and cellist Yo-Yo Ma.

==Early life and education==
McFerrin was born in Manhattan, New York City in 1950, the son of operatic baritone Robert McFerrin, who was the first Black man to sing at America&#x27;s flagship opera company – the Metropolitan Opera, and singer Sara Copper (1924-2019). He attended Cathedral High School in Los Angeles, Cerritos College, University of Illinois Springfield (then known as Sangamon State University) and California State University, Sacramento.

His mother Sara (Copper) McFerrin was a soloist and taught voice at Fullerton College in Southern California.

== Career ==

McFerrin&#x27;s first recorded work, the self-titled album &quot;Bobby McFerrin&quot;, was not produced until 1982, when he was 31 years old. Before that, he had spent six years developing his musical style, the first two years of which he attempted not to listen to other singers at all, in order to avoid sounding like they sounded. He was influenced by Keith Jarrett, who had achieved great success with a series of solo improvised piano concerts including &quot;The Köln Concert&quot; of 1975, and wanted to attempt something similar vocally.

In 1984, McFerrin performed at the Playboy Jazz Festival in Los Angeles as a sixth member of Herbie Hancock&#x27;s VSOP II, sharing horn trio parts with the Marsalis brothers.

In 1986, McFerrin was the voice of Santa Bear in &quot;Santa Bear&#x27;s First Christmas&quot;, and in 1987 he was the voice of Santa Bear/Bully Bear in the sequel &quot;Santa Bear&#x27;s High Flying Adventure&quot;. On September 24 of that same year, he recorded the theme song for the opening credits of Season 4 of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;.

In 1988, McFerrin recorded the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, Be Happy&quot;, which became a hit and brought him widespread recognition across the world. The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1988. The song&#x27;s success &quot;ended McFerrin&#x27;s musical life as he had known it,&quot; and he began to pursue other musical possibilities on stage and in recording studios. The song was used as the official campaign song for George H. W. Bush in the 1988 U.S. presidential election, without McFerrin&#x27;s permission or endorsement. In reaction, McFerrin publicly protested the use of his song, and said that he was going to vote against Bush. He also dropped the song from his own performance repertoire.

In 1989, McFerrin composed and performed the music for the Pixar short film &quot;Knick Knack&quot;. The rough cut to which he recorded his vocals had the words &quot;blah blah blah&quot; in place of the end credits (meant to indicate that he should improvise). He decided to sing &quot;blah blah blah&quot; as lyrics, and the final version of the short film includes these lyrics during the end credits. Also in 1989, he formed a ten-person &quot;Voicestra&quot; which he featured on both his 1990 album &quot;Medicine Music&quot; and in the score to the 1989 Oscar-winning documentary &quot;Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt&quot;.

Around 1992, an urban legend began that McFerrin had committed suicide; it has been suggested that the false story spread because people enjoyed the irony of a man known for the positive message of &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, Be Happy&quot; suffering from depression in real life.

In 1993, he sang Henry Mancini&#x27;s &quot;Pink Panther Theme&quot; for the 1993 comedy film &quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot;.
In addition to his vocal performing career, in 1994, McFerrin was appointed as creative chair of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. He makes regular tours as a guest conductor for symphony orchestras throughout the United States and Canada, including the San Francisco Symphony (on his 40th birthday), the New York Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the London Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic and many others. In McFerrin&#x27;s concert appearances, he combines serious conducting of classical pieces with his own vocal improvisations, often with participation from the audience and the orchestra. For example, the concerts often end with McFerrin conducting the orchestra in an a cappella rendition of the &quot;William Tell Overture,&quot; in which the orchestra members sing their musical parts in McFerrin&#x27;s vocal style instead of playing their parts on their instruments.

For a few years in the late 1990s, McFerrin toured a concert version of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. He said that his production was partly in honor of his father, who sang the role for Sidney Poitier in the 1959 film version, and partly &quot;to preserve the score&#x27;s jazziness&quot; in the face of &quot;largely white orchestras&quot; who tend not &quot;to play around the bar lines, to stretch and bend&quot;.

McFerrin also participates in various music education programs and makes volunteer appearances as a guest music teacher and lecturer at public schools throughout the U.S. He has collaborated with his son, Taylor, on various musical ventures.

In July 2003, McFerrin was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music during the Umbria Jazz Festival where he conducted two days of clinics.

In 2009, McFerrin and psychologist Daniel Levitin hosted &quot;The Music Instinct&quot;, a two-hour documentary produced by PBS and based on Levitin&#x27;s best-selling book &quot;This Is Your Brain on Music&quot;. Later that year, the two appeared together on a panel at the World Science Festival.

McFerrin was given a lifetime achievement award at the A Cappella Music Awards on May 19, 2018. He received the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award on August 20, 2020.

McFerrin was honored with the Grammy Awards Lifetime Achievement Award in 2022. This award is given to &quot;performers who, during their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording.&quot;

==Personal life==
McFerrin is married to Debbie Green and has three children; musicians Taylor and Madison, and actor Jevon.

In an interview with Daniel Levitin, McFerrin revealed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, prompting him to sell his home in rural Pennsylvania and move to San Francisco.

==Vocal technique==
As a vocalist, McFerrin often switches rapidly between modal and falsetto registers to create polyphonic effects, performing both the main melody and the accompanying parts of songs. He makes use of percussive effects created both with his mouth and by tapping on his chest. He is also capable of multiphonic singing.

A document of McFerrin&#x27;s approach to singing is his 1984 album &quot;The Voice&quot;, the first solo vocal jazz album recorded with no accompaniment or overdubbing.

<text>The Pezizaceae (commonly referred to as cup fungi) are a family of fungi in the Ascomycota which produce mushrooms that tend to grow in the shape of a &quot;cup&quot;. Spores are formed on the inner surface of the fruit body (ascoma). The cup shape typically serves to focus raindrops into splashing spores out of the cup. Additionally, the curvature enables wind currents to blow the spores out in a different manner than in most agarics and boletes.

Cup fungi grow in peculiar shapes, frequently resembling cups or saucers. For example, the orange peel fungus (&quot;Aleuria aurantia&quot;) resembles a discarded orange rind. According to one 2008 estimate, the family contains 31 genera and 230 species.

<text>Stromboli ( , ; ) is an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea, off the north coast of Sicily, containing Mount Stromboli, one of the four active volcanoes in Italy. It is one of the seven Aeolian Islands, a volcanic arc north of Sicily, and the mythological home of Aeolus.

The island, with an area of , represents the upper third of the volcano. Its population was about 500 . The volcano has erupted many times and is constantly active with minor eruptions, often visible from many points on the island and from the surrounding sea, giving rise to the island&#x27;s nickname &quot;Lighthouse of the Mediterranean&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name Stromboli is derived from the Ancient Greek name , () which was derived from (, &#x27;round&#x27;), after the volcano&#x27;s round, conical appearance when seen from a distance.

==Height and shape==
Stromboli stands above sea level,
and over above the sea floor.

The area of Stromboli island is .

As of June 2024, there are two active craters at the peak, each with multiple vents showing volcanic activity and lava flows.

The Sciara del Fuoco (&quot;stream of fire&quot;) is a large horseshoe-shaped depression created in the last 13,000 years by several collapses on the northwestern side of the cone. Approximately northeast lies Strombolicchio, the volcanic plug remnant of the original volcano.

==Volcano==

Mount Stromboli has been in almost continuous eruption for the past 2,000–5,000 years; its last serious one occurred in 1921. A pattern of eruption is maintained in which explosions occur at the summit craters, with mild to moderate eruptions of incandescent volcanic bombs, a type of tephra, at intervals ranging from minutes to hours. This pattern of Strombolian eruption, as it is known, is also observed at other volcanoes worldwide.

Eruptions from the summit craters typically result in a few short, mild, but energetic bursts, ranging up to a few hundred meters in height, containing ash, incandescent lava fragments, and stone blocks. Stromboli&#x27;s activity is almost exclusively explosive, but lava flows do occur at times when volcanic activity is high: an effusive eruption occurred in 2002, the first in 17 years, and again in 2003, 2007, and 2013–14. Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a multi-component gas analyzer system, which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magma, improving prediction of volcanic activity.

On 3 July 2019, two major explosive events occurred at around 16:46 local time, alongside 20 additional minor explosive events identified by Italy&#x27;s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology. A hiker near the volcano&#x27;s summit died after being struck by flying debris when the eruption began. Additionally, 6 people suffered minor injuries due to the eruption.

On 28 August 2019, at 10:16 local time, an explosive eruption sent a pyroclastic flow down the volcano&#x27;s northern flank and into the sea, where it continued for several hundred meters before collapsing. The resulting ash column reached a height of .

On 4 July 2024, Stromboli erupted along with Mount Etna, as Protezione Civile issued the highest alert level.

Two villages, San Bartolo and San Vincenzo, lie in the northeast, while the smaller village Ginostra lies in the southwest. Administratively, they are one of the (unit of a commune and municipality) of Lipari, Messina.

In the early 20th century, a few thousand people inhabited the island, but after several waves of emigration, the population has numbered a few hundred since the mid-1950s. The population on the island was about 500 .

In addition to Italian, a derivative of the Sicilian dialect that is called Aeolian is generally spoken on this and the other Aeolian islands.

==In popular culture==
* In &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1864) by Jules Verne, the conclusion of the novel is set on Stromboli.
* Author J. R. R. Tolkien identified his fictional volcano Mount Doom in Mordor with the volcano of Stromboli, according to scholar Clyde S. Kilby.
* &quot;Stromboli&quot; (1950), also known as &quot;Stromboli, Land of God&quot;, is an Italian-American film set on Stromboli, directed by Roberto Rossellini and starring Ingrid Bergman.
*Rising Appalachia&#x27;s 2015 song &quot;Stromboli&quot; was written on and titled after the island. The studio version appears on &quot;Wider Circles&quot; (2015), and a live version appears on &quot;Alive&quot;.
*The lyrics of the Woody Guthrie song &quot;Ingrid Bergman&quot; (set to music &amp; released on the 1998 album &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; by Billy Bragg &amp; Wilco) focus on images of the actress in the Rossellini film &quot;Stromboli&quot;, and erotic references to the island&#x27;s volcanic nature.
*An Italian-American savory pastry is named stromboli after the island.
* The novel &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot;, written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child features the island as part of its conclusion.

<doc id="304566" wikidata="Q609066" url="?curid=304566" title="Avolition">
<text>Avolition or amotivation, as a symptom of various forms of psychopathology, is the decrease in the ability to initiate and persist in self-directed purposeful activities. Such activities that appear to be neglected usually include routine activities, including hobbies, going to work or school, and most notably, engaging in social activities. A person experiencing avolition may stay at home for long periods of time, rather than seeking out work or peer relations. It is a disorder of diminished motivation.

==Psychopathology==
People with avolition often want to complete certain tasks but lack the ability to initiate behaviors necessary to complete them. Avolition is most commonly seen as a symptom of some other disorder, but might be considered a primary clinical disturbance of itself (or as a coexisting second disorder) related to disorders of diminished motivation. In 2006, avolition was identified as a negative symptom of schizophrenia by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and has been observed in patients with bipolar disorder as well as resulting from trauma.

Avolition is sometimes mistaken for other, similar symptoms also affecting motivation, such as abulia, anhedonia and asociality, or strong general disinterest. For example, abulia is also a restriction in motivation and initiation, but characterized by an inability to set goals or make decisions and considered a disorder of diminished motivation. In order to provide effective treatment, the underlying cause of avolition (if any) has to be identified and it is important to properly differentiate it from other symptoms, even though they might reflect similar aspects of mental illness.

==Social and clinical implications==
Implications from avolition often result in social deficits. Not being able to initiate and perform purposeful activities can have many implications for a person with avolition. By disrupting interactions with both familiar and unfamiliar people, it jeopardizes the patient&#x27;s social relations. When part of a severe mental illness, avolition has been reported, in first person accounts, to lead to physical and mental inability to both initiate and maintain relationships, as well as work, eat, drink or even sleep.

Clinically, it may be difficult to engage an individual experiencing avolition in active participation of psychotherapy. Patients are also faced with the stresses of coping with and accepting a mental illness and the stigma that often accompanies such a diagnosis and its symptoms. Regarding schizophrenia, the American Psychiatric Association reported in 2013 that there currently are &quot;no treatments with proven efficacy for primary negative symptoms&quot; (such as avolition). Together with schizophrenia&#x27;s chronic nature, such facts added to the outlook of never getting well, might further implicate feelings of hopelessness and similar in patients as well as their friends and family.

==Treatment==
Antipsychotics are less effective in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as avolition than for positive symptoms. Low dose amisulpride has shown to be more effective than placebo for treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which includes avolition. It works by blocking pre-synaptic dopamine receptors, causing a release of dopamine into the synapse.

Compared with social skills training (SST), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) shows more promise in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, including avolition.

According to a 2015 article, aripiprazole may be useful for treatment of apathy syndrome (avolition). However, its role and efficacy in treatment of apathy requires further investigation in clinical trials. A comparison to amisulpride published in 2022, found that aripiprazole was effective in treating negative symptoms, while amisulpride was not.

According to a 2020 study, mitragynine contained in kratom may have the ability to reduce avolition.

<text>Frederick Claude Vivian Lane (2 February 1880 – 14 May 1969) was an Australian swimmer who competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics.

Lane, from Manly, New South Wales, was four years old when his brother saved him from drowning in Sydney Harbour, whereupon he decided to learn to swim. Later, he attended high school at Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview.

After breaking many Australasian swimming records, Lane moved to England to compete in the English Championships in 1899.

He was the first Australian to represent his country in swimming at the Olympic Games, when he competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, and won two gold medals. He first won the 200 metres freestyle, clearly beating Hungarian Zoltán Halmay. His second final was just 45 minutes later, the discontinued 200 metre obstacle event, where he beat Austrian Otto Wahle.

After the Olympics, Lane stayed in England for another two years working for a legal firm in Blackpool while he continued to swim and break records. In July 1902, he won a 100-yard race and became the first person to record one minute dead for that distance. In August, he swam 220 yards in 2 minutes 28.6 seconds, which in 1974 was ratified by FINA as the first World Record for 200 metres. In October, he broke the one-minute barrier for 100 yards in 59.6 seconds.

On returning to Australia, Lane became a master printer and a partner in a printing and stationery firm on Bridge Street. He married in 1908. He died in 1969 at Avalon Beach.

In 1969, Lane was honoured by the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

On 10 December 1985, Lane was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. In 2022, he was an inaugural inductee of the Swimming Australia Hall of Fame.

<doc id="304572" wikidata="Q192822" url="?curid=304572" title="Tonality">
<text>Tonality is the arrangement of pitches and / or chords of a musical work in a hierarchy of perceived &quot;relations&quot;, &quot;stabilities&quot;, &quot;attractions&quot;, and &quot;directionality&quot;. 

In this hierarchy, the single pitch or the root of a triad with the greatest &quot;stability&quot; in a melody or in its harmony is called the &quot;tonic&quot;. In this context &quot;stability&quot; approximately means that a pitch occurs frequently in a melody – and usually is the final note – or that the pitch often appears in the harmony, even when it is not the pitch used in the melody.

The &quot;root&quot; of the tonic triad forms the name given to the key, so in the key of C major the note C can be both the tonic of the scale and the root of the tonic triad. However, the tonic can be a different tone in the same scale, and then the work is said to be in one of the &quot;modes&quot; of that scale. 

Simple folk music songs, as well as orchestral pieces, often start and end with the tonic note. The most common use of the term &quot;tonality&quot;
: &quot;is to designate the arrangement of musical phenomena around a referential tonic in European music from about 1600 to about 1910&quot;.

Contemporary classical music from 1910 to the 2000s may seek to avoid any sort of tonality — but harmony in almost all Western popular music remains tonal. Harmony in jazz includes many but not all tonal characteristics of the European common practice period, usually known as &quot;classical music&quot;.

: &quot;All harmonic idioms in popular music are tonal, and none is without function.&quot;

Tonality is an organized system of tones (e.g., the tones of a major or minor scale) in which one tone (the tonic) becomes the central point for the remaining tones. The other tones in a tonal piece are all defined in terms of their relationship to the tonic. In tonality, the tonic (tonal center) is the tone of complete relaxation and stability, the target toward which other tones lead. The cadence (a rest point) in which the dominant chord or dominant seventh chord resolves to the tonic chord plays an important role in establishing the tonality of a piece.
: &quot;Tonal music is music that is &quot;unified&quot; and &quot;dimensional&quot;. Music is &#x27;unified&#x27; if it is exhaustively referable to a pre-compositional system generated by a single constructive principle derived from a basic scale-type; it is &#x27;dimensional&#x27; if it can nonetheless be distinguished from that pre-compositional ordering&quot;.

The term &quot;tonalité&quot; originated with Alexandre-Étienne Choron and was borrowed by François-Joseph Fétis in 1840. According to Carl Dahlhaus, however, the term &quot;tonalité&quot; was only coined by Castil-Blaze in 1821. Although Fétis used it as a general term for a system of musical organization and spoke of &quot;types de tonalités&quot; rather than a single system, today the term is most often used to refer to major–minor tonality, the system of musical organization of the common practice period. Major-minor tonality is also called &quot;harmonic tonality&quot; (in the title of Carl Dahlhaus, translating the German &quot;harmonische Tonalität&quot;), &quot;diatonic tonality&quot;, &quot;common practice tonality&quot;, &quot;functional tonality&quot;, or just &quot;tonality&quot;.

== Characteristics and features ==
At least eight distinct senses of the word &quot;tonality&quot; (and corresponding adjective, &quot;tonal&quot;), some mutually exclusive, have been identified.

=== Systematic organization ===
The word tonality may describe any systematic organization of pitch phenomena in any music at all, including pre-17th century western music as well as much non-western music, such as music based on the slendro and pelog pitch collections of Indonesian gamelan, or employing the modal nuclei of the Arabic maqam or the Indian raga system.

This sense also applies to the tonic/dominant/subdominant harmonic constellations in the theories of Jean-Philippe Rameau as well as the 144 basic transformations of twelve-tone technique. By the middle of the 20th century, it had become &quot;evident that triadic structure does not necessarily generate a tone center, that non-triadic harmonic formations may be made to function as referential elements, and that the assumption of a twelve-tone complex does not preclude the existence of tone centers&quot;.

For the composer and theorist George Perle, tonality is not &quot;a matter of &#x27;tone-centeredness&#x27;, whether based on a &#x27;natural&#x27; hierarchy of pitches derived from the overtone series or an &#x27;artificial&#x27; pre compositional ordering of the pitch material; nor is it essentially connected to the kinds of pitch structures one finds in traditional diatonic music&quot;. This sense (like some of the others) is susceptible to ideological employment, as Schoenberg, did by relying on the idea of a progressive development in musical resources &quot;to compress divergent &quot;fin-de-siècle&quot; compositional practices into a single historical lineage in which his own music brings one historical era to a close and begins the next.&quot; From this point of view, twelve-tone music could be regarded &quot;either as the natural and inevitable culmination of an organic motivic process (Webern) or as a historical &quot;Aufhebung&quot; (Adorno), the dialectical synthesis of late Romantic motivic practice on the one hand with a musical sublimation of tonality as pure system on the other&quot;.

=== Theoretical arrangement of pitches ===
In another sense, tonality means any rational and self-contained theoretical arrangement of musical pitches, existing prior to any concrete embodiment in music.

For example, &quot;Sainsbury, who had Choron translated into English in 1825, rendered the first occurrence of tonalité as a &#x27;system of modes&#x27; before matching it with the neologism &#x27;tonality&#x27;. While tonality qua system constitutes a theoretical (and thus imaginative) abstraction from actual music, it is often hypostatized in musicological discourse, converted from a theoretical structure into a musical reality. In this sense, it is understood as a Platonic form or prediscursive musical essence that suffuses music with intelligible sense, which exists before its concrete embodiment in music, and can thus be theorized and discussed apart from actual musical contexts&quot;.

=== Contrast with modal and atonal systems ===
To contrast with &quot;modal&quot; and &quot;atonal&quot;, the term tonality is used to imply that tonal music is discontinuous as a form of cultural expression from modal music (before 1600) on the one hand and atonal music (after 1910) on the other.

=== Pre-modern concept ===
In some literature, tonality is a generic term applied to pre-modern music, referring to the eight modes of the Western church, implying that important historical continuities underlie music before and after the emergence of the common practice period around 1600, with the difference between &quot;tonalité ancienne&quot; (before 1600) and &quot;tonalité moderne&quot; (after 1600) being one of emphasis rather than of kind.

=== Referential tonic ===
In a general way, tonality can refer to a wide variety of musical phenomena (harmonies, cadential formulae, harmonic progressions, melodic gestures, formal categories) as arranged or understood in relation to a referential tonic.

=== Tonal theories ===
In a slightly different sense to the one above, tonality can also be used to refer to musical phenomena perceived or pre-interpreted in terms of the categories of tonal theories.

This is a psychophysical sense, where for example &quot;listeners tend to hear a given pitch as, for instance, an A above middle C, an augmented 4th above E, the minor 3rd in an F minor triad, a dominant in relation to D, or (where the caret designates a scale degree) in G major rather than a mere acoustical frequency, in this case 440 Hz&quot;.

=== Synonym for &quot;key&quot; ===
The word tonality is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;key&quot;, as in &quot;the C-minor tonality of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony&quot;.

In some languages, indeed, the word for &quot;key&quot; and that for &quot;tonality&quot; are the same, e.g. French &quot;tonalité&quot;.

=== Other perspectives ===
There is a loose assortment of ideas associated with the term.

: &quot;Tonal harmonies must always include the third of the chord&quot;.

In major and minor harmonies, the perfect fifth is often implied and understood by the listener even if it is not present. To function as a tonic, a chord must be either a major or a minor triad. Dominant function requires a major-quality triad with a root a perfect fifth above the affiliated tonic and containing the leading tone of the key. This dominant triad must be preceded by a chord progression that establishes the dominant as the penultimate goal of a motion that is completed by moving on to the tonic. In this final dominant-to-tonic progression, the leading tone normally ascends by semitone motion to the tonic scale degree. A dominant seventh chord always consist of a major triad with an added minor seventh above the root. To achieve this in minor keys, the seventh scale degree must be raised to create a major triad on the dominant.

David Cope considers key, consonance and dissonance (relaxation and tension, respectively), and hierarchical relationships the three most basic concepts in tonality.

Carl Dahlhaus lists the characteristic schemata of tonal harmony, &quot;typified in the compositional formulas of the 16th and early 17th centuries,&quot; as the &quot;complete cadence&quot; I–ii–V–I, I–IV–V–I, I–IV–I–V–I; the circle of fifths progression I–IV–vii°–iii–vi–ii–V–I; and the major–minor parallelism: minor v–i–VII–III equals major iii–vi–V–I; or minor III–VII–i–v equals major I–V–vi–iii. The last of these progressions is characterized by &quot;retrograde&quot; harmonic motion.

=== Form ===
=== Consonance and dissonance ===

The consonance and dissonance of different intervals plays an important role in establishing the tonality of a piece or section in common practice music and popular music. For example, for a simple folk music song in the key of C Major, almost all of the triadic chords in the song will be Major or minor chords which are stable and consonant (e.g., in the key of C Major, commonly-used chords include D minor, F Major, G Major, etc.). The most commonly used dissonant chord in a pop song context is the dominant seventh chord built on the fifth scale degree; in the key of C Major, this would be a G dominant seventh chord, or G7 chord, which contains the pitches G, B, D and F. This dominant seventh chord contains a dissonant tritone interval between the notes B and F. In pop music, the listener will expect this tritone to be resolved to a consonant, stable chord (in this case, typically a C Major cadence (coming to rest point) or a deceptive cadence to an A minor chord).

=== Tonal musics ===
&quot;The larger portion of the world&#x27;s folk and art music can be categorized as tonal,&quot; as long as the definition is as follows: &quot;Tonal music gives priority to a single tone or tonic. In this kind of music all the constituent tones and resulting tonal relationships are heard and identified relative to their tonic&quot;. In this sense, &quot;All harmonic idioms in popular music are tonal, and none is without function&quot;. However, &quot;within the continuing hegemony of tonality there is evidence for a relatively separate tradition of genuine folk musics, which do not operate completely or even mainly according to the assumptions or rules of tonality. … throughout the reign of tonality there seem to have existed subterranean folk musical traditions organized on principles different from tonality, and often modal: Celtic songs and blues are obvious examples&quot;.

According to Allan Moore, &quot;part of the heritage of rock lies within common-practice tonality&quot; but, because the leading-note / tonic relationship is &quot;axiomatic to the definition of common-practice tonality&quot;, and a fundamental feature of rock music&#x27;s identity is the absence of a diatonic leading tone, the harmonic practices of rock music, &quot;while sharing many features with classical tonality, are nonetheless distinct&quot;. Power chords are especially problematic when trying to apply classical functional tonality to certain varieties of popular music. Genres such as heavy metal, new wave, punk rock, and grunge music &quot;took power chords into new arenas, often with a reduced emphasis on tonal function. These genres are often expressed in two parts—a bass line doubled in fifths, and a single vocal part. Power chord technique was often allied with modal procedure&quot;.

Much jazz is tonal, but &quot;functional tonality in jazz has different properties than that of common-practice classical music. These properties are represented by a unique set of rules dictating the unfolding of harmonic function, voice-leading conventions, and the overall behavior of chord tones and chordal extensions&quot;.

== History and theory ==
=== 18th century ===
Jean-Philippe Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Harmony&quot; (1722) is the earliest effort to explain tonal harmony through a coherent system based on acoustical principles, built upon the functional unit being the triad, with inversions.

=== 19th century ===
The term &quot;tonalité&quot; (tonality) was first used in 1810 by Alexandre Choron in the preface &quot;Sommaire de l&#x27;histoire de la musique&quot; to the &quot;Dictionnaire historique des musiciens artistes et amateurs&quot; (which he published in collaboration with François-Joseph-Marie Fayolle) to describe the arrangement of the dominant and subdominant above and below the tonic—a constellation that had been made familiar by Rameau. According to Choron, this pattern, which he called &quot;tonalité moderne&quot;, distinguished modern music&#x27;s harmonic organization from that of earlier [pre 17th century] music, including &quot;tonalité des Grecs&quot; (ancient Greek modes) and &quot;tonalité ecclésiastique&quot; (plainchant). According to Choron, the beginnings of this modern tonality are found in the music of Claudio Monteverdi around the year 1595, but it was more than a century later that the full application of tonal harmony finally supplanted the older reliance on the melodic orientation of the church modes, in the music of the Neapolitan School — most especially that of Francesco Durante.

François-Joseph Fétis developed the concept of &quot;tonalité&quot; in the 1830s and 1840s, finally codifying his theory of tonality in 1844, in his &quot;Traité complet de la théorie et de la pratique de l&#x27;harmonie&quot;. Fétis saw &quot;tonalité moderne&quot; as the historically evolving phenomenon with three stages: tonality of &quot;ordre transitonique&quot; (&quot;transitonic order&quot;), of &quot;ordre pluritonique&quot; (&quot;pluritonic order&quot;) and, finally, &quot;ordre omnitonique&quot; (&quot;omnitonic order&quot;). The &quot;transitonic&quot; phase of tonality he connected with the late Monteverdi. He described his earliest example of &quot;tonalité moderne&quot; thus: &quot;In the passage quoted here from Monteverdi&#x27;s madrigal (&quot;Cruda amarilli&quot;, mm. 9–19 and 24–30), one sees a tonality determined by the &quot;accord parfait&quot; [root position major chord] on the tonic, by the sixth chord assigned to the chords on the third and seventh degrees of the scale, by the optional choice of the &quot;accord parfait&quot; or the sixth chord on the sixth degree, and finally, by the &quot;accord parfait&quot; and, above all, by the unprepared seventh chord (with major third) on the dominant&quot;. Among most subtle representatives of &quot;pluritonic order&quot; there were Mozart and Rossini; this stage he saw as the culmination and perfection of &quot;tonalité moderne&quot;. The romantic tonality of Berlioz and especially Wagner he related to &quot;omnitonic order&quot; with its &quot;insatiable desire for modulation&quot;. His prophetic vision of the omnitonic order (though he didn&#x27;t approve it personally) as the way of further development of tonality was a remarkable innovation to historic and theoretic concepts of the 19th century.

&quot;Tonalité ancienne&quot; Fetis described as tonality of &quot;ordre unitonique&quot; (establishing one key and remaining in that key for the duration of the piece). The principal example of this &quot;unitonic order&quot; tonality he saw in the Western plainchant.

Fétis believed that tonality, &quot;tonalité moderne&quot;, was entirely cultural, saying, &quot;For the elements of music, nature provides nothing but a multitude of tones differing in pitch, duration, and intensity by the greater or least degree ... The conception of the relationships that exist among them is awakened in the intellect, and, by the action of sensitivity on the one hand, and will on the other, the mind coordinates the tones into different series, each of which corresponds to a particular class of emotions, sentiments, and ideas. Hence these series become various types of tonalities.&quot; &quot;But one will say, &#x27;What is the principle behind these scales, and what, if not acoustic phenomena and the laws of mathematics, has set the order of their tones?&#x27; I respond that this principle is purely metaphysical [anthropological]. We conceive this order and the melodic and harmonic phenomena that spring from it out of our conformation and education.&quot;

Fétis&#x27; &quot;Traité complet&quot; was very popular. In France alone the book was printed between 1844 and 1903 twenty times. The 1st edition was printed in Paris and Brussels in 1844, the 9th edition was printed in Paris in 1864, and the 20th edition was printed in Paris in 1903.

In contrast, Hugo Riemann believed tonality, &quot;affinities between tones&quot; or &quot;Tonverwandtschaften&quot;, was entirely natural and, following Moritz Hauptmann, that the major third and perfect fifth were the only &quot;directly intelligible&quot; intervals, and that I, IV, and V, the tonic, subdominant, and dominant were related by the perfect fifths between their root notes.

It is in this era that the word &quot;tonality&quot; was popularized by Fétis.

Theorists such as Hugo Riemann, and later Edward Lowinsky and others, pushed back the date when modern tonality began, and the cadence began to be seen as the definitive way that a tonality is established in a work of music.

In the music of some late-Romantic or post-Romantic composers such as Richard Wagner, Hugo Wolf, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Alexander Scriabin, and others, we find a variety of harmonic and linear procedures that have the effect of weakening functional tonality. These procedures may produce a suspension of tonality or may create a sense of tonal ambiguity, even to the point that at times the sense of tonality is completely lost. Schoenberg described this kind of tonality (with references to the music of Wagner, Mahler, and himself, amongst others) as &quot;aufgehobene Tonalität&quot; and &quot;schwebende Tonalität&quot;, usually rendered in English as &quot;suspended&quot; (&quot;not in effect&quot;, &quot;cancelled&quot;) tonality and &quot;fluctuating&quot; (&quot;suspended&quot;, &quot;not yet decided&quot;) tonality, respectively.

=== 20th century ===
In the early 20th century, the tonality that had prevailed since the 17th century was seen to have reached a crisis or break down point. Because of the &quot;...increased use of the ambiguous chords, the less probable harmonic progressions, and the more unusual melodic and rhythmic inflections,&quot; the syntax of functional harmony loosened to the point where, &quot;At best, the felt probabilities of the style system had become obscure; at worst, they were approaching a uniformity which provided few guides for either composition or listening.&quot;

Tonality may be considered generally, with no restrictions on the date or place the music was produced, and little restriction on the materials and methods used. This definition includes pre-17th century western music, as well as much non-western music. By the middle of the 20th century, it had become &quot;evident that triadic structure does not necessarily generate a tone center, that non-triadic harmonic formations may be made to function as referential elements, and that the assumption of a twelve-tone complex does not preclude the existence of tone centers&quot;. For the composer and theorist George Perle, tonality is not &quot;a matter of &#x27;tone-centeredness&#x27;, whether based on a &#x27;natural&#x27; hierarchy of pitches derived from the overtone series or an &#x27;artificial&#x27; pre compositional ordering of the pitch material; nor is it essentially connected to the kinds of pitch structures one finds in traditional diatonic music&quot;.

== Theoretical underpinnings ==

One area of disagreement going back to the origin of the term tonality is whether tonality is &quot;natural&quot; or inherent in acoustical phenomena, whether it is inherent in the human nervous system or a psychological construct, whether it is inborn or learned, and to what degree it is all these things. A viewpoint held by many theorists since the third quarter of the 19th century, following the publication in 1862 of the first edition of Helmholtz&#x27;s &quot;On the Sensation of Tone&quot;, holds that diatonic scales and tonality arise from natural overtones.

Rudolph Réti differentiates between harmonic tonality of the traditional kind found in homophony, and melodic tonality, as in monophony. In the harmonic kind, tonality is produced through the V–I chord progression. He argues that in the progression I–x–V–I (and all progressions), V–I is the only step &quot;which &quot;as such&quot; produces the effect of tonality&quot;, and that all other chord successions, diatonic or not, being more or less similar to the tonic-dominant, are &quot;the composer&#x27;s free invention.&quot; He describes melodic tonality (the term coined independently and 10 years earlier by Estonian composer Jaan Soonvald) as being &quot;entirely different from the classical type,&quot; wherein, &quot;the whole line is to be understood as a musical unit mainly through its relationship to this basic note [the tonic],&quot; this note not always being the tonic as interpreted according to harmonic tonality. His examples are ancient Jewish and Gregorian chant and other Eastern music, and he points out how these melodies often may be interrupted at any point and returned to the tonic, yet harmonically tonal melodies, such as that from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; below, are actually &quot;strict harmonic-rhythmic pattern[s],&quot; and include many points &quot;from which it is impossible, that is, illogical, unless we want to destroy the innermost sense of the whole line&quot; to return to the tonic.
Consequently, he argues, melodically tonal melodies resist harmonization and only reemerge in western music after, &quot;harmonic tonality was abandoned,&quot; as in the music of Claude Debussy: &quot;melodic tonality plus modulation is [Debussy&#x27;s] modern tonality&quot;.

== Outside common-practice period ==
The noun &quot;tonality&quot; and adjective &quot;tonal&quot; are widely applied also, in studies of early and modern Western music, and in non-Western traditional music (Arabic maqam, Indian raga, Indonesian slendro etc.), to the &quot;systematic arrangements of pitch phenomena and relations between them&quot;. Felix Wörner, Ullrich Scheideler, and Philip Rupprecht in the introduction to a collection of essays dedicated to the concept and practice of tonality between 1900 and 1950 describe it generally as &quot;the awareness of key in music&quot;.

Harold Powers, in a series of articles, used terms &quot;sixteenth-century tonalities&quot; and &quot;Renaissance tonality&quot;. He borrowed German &quot;Tonartentyp&quot; from , who related it to Palestrina, translated it into English as &quot;tonal type&quot;, and systematically applied the concept of &quot;tonal types&quot; to Renaissance sacred and paraliturgical polyphony. Cristle Collins Judd (the author of many articles and a thesis dedicated to the early pitch systems) found &quot;tonalities&quot; in this sense in motets of Josquin des Prez. Judd also wrote of &quot;chant-based tonality&quot;, meaning &quot;tonal&quot; polyphonic compositions based on plainchant. Peter Lefferts found &quot;tonal types&quot; in the French polyphonic chanson of the 14th century, Italian musicologists Marco Mangani and Daniele Sabaino in the late Renaissance music, and so on.

The wide usage of &quot;tonality&quot; and &quot;tonal&quot; has been supported by several other musicologists (of diverse provenance). A possible reason for this broader usage of terms &quot;tonality&quot; and &quot;tonal&quot; is the attempt to translate German &quot;Tonart&quot; as &quot;tonality&quot; and &quot;Tonarten-&quot; prefix as &quot;tonal&quot; (for example, it is rendered so in the seminal &quot;New Grove&quot; article &quot;Mode&quot;, etc.). Therefore, two different German words &quot;Tonart&quot; and &quot;Tonalität&quot; have sometimes been translated as &quot;tonality&quot; although they are not the same words in German.
In 1882, Hugo Riemann defined the term &quot;Tonalität&quot; specifically to include chromatic as well as diatonic relationships to a tonic, in contrast to the usual diatonic concept of &quot;Tonart&quot;. In the neo-Riemannian theory of the late 20th century, however, the same chromatic chord relations cited by Riemann came to be regarded as a fundamental example of nontonal triadic relations, reinterpreted as a product of the hexatonic cycle (the six-pitch-class set forming a scale of alternating minor thirds and semitones, Forte&#x27;s set-type 6–20, but manifested as a succession of from four to six alternating major and minor triads), defined without reference to a tonic.

In the 20th century, music that no longer conformed to the strict definition of common-practice tonality could nevertheless still involve musical phenomena (harmonies, cadential formulae, harmonic progressions, melodic gestures, formal categories) arranged or understood in relation to a referential tonic. For example, the closing bars of the first movement of Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta&quot; do not involve a composed-out triad, but rather a diverging-converging pair of chromatic lines moving from a unison A to an octave E and back to a unison A again, providing a framing &quot;deep structure&quot; based on a tritone relationship that nevertheless is not analogous to a tonic-dominant axis, but rather remains within the single functional domain of the tonic, A. To distinguish this species of tonality (found also, for example, in the music of Barber, Berg, Bernstein, Britten, Fine, Hindemith, Poulenc, Prokofiev, and, especially, Stravinsky) from the stricter kind associated with the 18th century, some writers use the term &quot;neotonality&quot;, while others prefer to use the term &quot;centricity&quot;, and still others retain the term &quot;tonality&quot;, in its broader sense or use word combinations like &quot;extended tonality&quot;.

== Computational methods to determine the key ==
In music information retrieval, techniques have been developed to determine the key of a piece of classical Western music (recorded in audio data format) automatically. These methods are often based on a compressed representation of the pitch content in a 12-dimensional pitch-class profile (chromagram) and a subsequent procedure that finds the best match between this representation and one of the prototype vectors of the 24 minor and major keys. For implementation, often the constant-Q transform is used, displaying the musical signal on a log frequency scale. Although a radical (over)simplification of the concept of tonality, such methods can predict the key of classical Western music well for most pieces. Other methods also take into consideration the sequentiality of music.

<text>Breslov (also Bratslav and Breslev) is a branch of Hasidic Judaism founded by Nachman of Breslov (1772–1810), a great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism. Its adherents strive to develop an intense, joyous relationship with God and receive guidance toward this goal from the teachings of Nachman.

The movement has had no central, living leader for the past 200 years, as Nachman did not designate a successor. As such, Breslov adherents are sometimes referred to as the &quot;dead Hasidim&quot; () since they have never had a formal Rebbe since Nachman&#x27;s death. However, certain groups and communities under the Breslov banner refer to their leaders as &quot;Rebbe&quot;.

The movement weathered strong opposition from virtually all other Hasidic movements in Ukraine throughout the 19th century, yet, at the same time, experienced growth in numbers of followers from Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Poland. By World War I, thousands of Breslov Hasidim lived in the region. After the Bolshevik Revolution, communist persecution forced the Breslov Hasidic movement underground in Russia. Thousands of Breslov Hasidim were imprisoned or executed during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge and later during the Nazi period, both before and after Germany&#x27;s invasion of Soviet Russia in 1941. The movement was regenerated in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Israel by those who escaped the persecutions of Europe, with large numbers of Yemenite Jews and other Mizrahi Jews joining the sect.

==History==
&quot;Breslov&quot; is the name used nowadays by Breslover followers for the town of Bratslav, where Nachman lived for the last eight years of his life before moving to Uman where he died. Bratslav is located on the Bug river in Ukraine (latitude 48.82 N., longitude 28.95 E.), midway between Tulchin to the south and Nemirov to the north— from each. Bratslav should not be confused with Wrocław, a town now located in Poland, called in German &quot;Breslau&quot;, and also pronounced &quot;Breslov&quot; in Yiddish, which was a renowned Jewish center in its own right.

Prior to his arrival in Breslov in 1802, Nachman lived and taught in other towns in the Russian Empire, such as Ossatin, Medvedevka , Zlatopol, and Odessa. But upon his arrival in Breslov, he declared, &quot;Today, we have planted the name of the Breslover Hasidim. This name will never disappear because my followers will always be called after the town of Breslov.&quot;

Later, followers said the name of the town dovetailed with Nachman&#x27;s teachings. He encouraged Jews to remove the barriers that stood between themselves and a closer relationship with God. They noted that the Hebrew letters of the word &quot;Breslov&quot; (ברסלב) can be re-arranged to spell &quot;lev basar&quot; (לב בשר —the &quot;ס&quot; and &quot;ש&quot; sounds are interchangeable), &quot;a heart of flesh&quot;, echoing the prophecy in Ezekiel (36:26): &quot;I [God] will take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.&quot; (For this reason, some adherents spell the name of the Hasidut, &quot;Breslev&quot;, stressing the &quot;lev&quot; (heart). Contemporary Breslov teacher Shmuel Moshe Kramer of Jerusalem also noted that the gematria (&quot;numerical value&quot;) of the Hebrew letters of &quot;Breslov&quot; (ברסלב) is 294, as is the Hebrew spelling of &quot;Nachman ben Faiga&quot; (נחמן בן פיגא) (Nachman son [of] Faiga), the names of Nachman and his mother.

==Religious approach==

The Breslov approach places great emphasis on serving God through the sincerity of the heart, with much joy and living life as intensely as possible. Breslov&#x27;s teachings particularly emphasize &quot;emunah&quot; (faith) and &quot;teshuvah&quot; (repentance) and that every Jew on any level of Divine service is required to yearn to return to God constantly, no matter how high or low they are situated on the spiritual echelon.

Breslover Hasidim see the study and fulfillment of Torah life as the means to a joyful existence, and their approach to worship is very personalized and emotional, with much clapping, singing, and dancing. Nachman said, &quot;It is a great mitzvah [commandment or good deed] to always be happy&quot;. In this same lesson, he notes that even leading intellectuals in the medical field will attest to depression and bitterness being the main cause of most mental and physical ailments.

Breslov teachings emphasize the importance of drawing people to the &quot;true tzadik&quot; as the key to rectifying the world, overcoming evil, and bringing people closer to God, according to Nachman and Nathan of Breslov. In Breslov thought, the &quot;true tzadik&quot; is Nachman himself.

Nachman also emphasized Jewish prayer. Besides the regular daily services in the synagogue, Nachman advised his followers to engage in &quot;hitbodedut&quot; (literally, &quot;self-seclusion&quot;), on a daily basis. Nachman claimed that every true tzaddik attained his lofty spiritual level almost uniquely because of &quot;hitbodedut&quot;. Nachman explained that &quot;hitbodedut&quot; is the loftiest form of Divine service and that it is virtually impossible to be a good Jew without this practice. During &quot;hitbodedut&quot;, the individual pours out his thoughts and concerns to God in his mother tongue, as if talking to a close personal friend. The goal is to establish complete unification with God and a clearer understanding of one&#x27;s personal motives and goals.

A sub-group of the Breslov sect, colloquially known as &quot;Na Nachs&quot;, uses the &quot;Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman&quot; mantra, which is based on a permutation of the Hebrew letters of Nachman&#x27;s name. This mantra was not used by Nachman himself but was taught in the 20th century by Yisroel Ber Odesser. The &quot;NaNach&quot; movement, however, is highly controversial within the wider Breslov community because it places less emphasis on learning traditional Jewish texts such as the Talmud and more emphasis on ecstatic worship.

Nachman always maintained that his high spiritual level was due to his own efforts and not to his famous lineage or any other circumstances of his birth. He repeatedly insisted that all Jews could reach the same level as he and disagreed with those who thought that the main reason for a Rebbe&#x27;s greatness was the superior level of his soul.

==The Rosh Hashana kibbutz==

Another specifically Breslov practice is the annual Rosh Hashanah kibbutz, a large gathering at the grave of Nachman in Uman, Ukraine, on the Jewish New Year. Nachman himself said:
During his lifetime, hundreds of followers spent the holiday with him; after his death, his closest disciple, Nathan of Breslov, organized an annual pilgrimage to his grave, starting with Rosh Hashana 1811, the year after Nachman&#x27;s death. Until World War I, thousands of Hasidim from Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Poland joined the holiday prayer gathering. The Rosh Hashana kibbutz operated clandestinely, and on a smaller scale, under Communism, when public prayer gatherings were forbidden. The pilgrimage was officially re-instituted after the fall of Communism in 1989, and continues to this day, with upwards of 70,000 men and boys arriving each Rosh Hashana from all over the world.

Breslovers also make individual pilgrimages to their Rebbe&#x27;s grave at other times of the year. Visiting the grave at any time is deemed beneficial, because Nachman said:
==Important books==
The main Hasidic texts revered and studied by Breslover Hasidim are those written by Nachman and Nathan. All of Nachman&#x27;s teachings were transcribed by Nathan. Additionally, Nathan wrote some of his own works.

Note that, at the same time, Breslovers do not restrict themselves to Nachman&#x27;s commentaries on the Torah, but also study many of the classic texts, including the Tanakh, Talmud, Midrash, and many others. 
They may also study the writings of Rebbes from other dynasties. 
In fact, Nachman claimed that while even a complete simpleton can become a pure and righteous Jew, the ideal study schedule of an extremely scholarly Hasid should include the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) with its commentaries, the entire Talmud with its commentaries, the entire Shulchan Aruch (code of law), all the Midrashic works, the Zohar and Tikkunei Zohar, the teachings of the Arizal, and other kabbalistic works, all over the course of a single year.
Today, many Breslov &quot;hasidim&quot; practice a daily review the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;.

Nachman&#x27;s magnum opus is the two-volume &quot;Likutei Moharan&quot; (Collected [Lessons] of Our Teacher, Rabbi Nachman), a collection of 411 lessons displaying in-depth familiarity and understanding of the many overt and esoteric concepts embedded in Tanakh, Talmud, Midrash, Zohar, and Kabbalah. In the introductory section of certain editions of Likutei Moharan, the book is likened to the Zohar itself, and Nachman is likened to the &quot;Zohar&quot;&#x27;s supposed author, Shimon bar Yochai. This is based on the citation of numerous parallels between the lives of the two sages, as well as the fact that the names &quot;Nachman ben Simcha&quot; (Simcha being Nachman&#x27;s father&#x27;s name) and &quot;Shimon ben Yochai&quot; share the same gematria (numerical value) of 501.

Upon Nachman&#x27;s instructions, Nathan collected all the practical teachings and advice contained in the &quot;Likutei Moharan&quot;, and published them in:
*&quot;Likutei Eitzot&quot; (Collected Advices)
*&quot;Kitzur Likutei Moharan&quot; (Abridged Likutei Moharan)

Nachman&#x27;s other works include:
*&quot;Sefer HaMiddot&quot; (Book of Traits) – a collection of aphorisms on various character traits; also published in English as &quot;The Aleph-Bet Book&quot;
*&quot;Sipurei Ma`asiyot&quot; (Story Tales) – 13 mystical parables, also published in English as &quot;Rabbi Nachman&#x27;s Stories&quot;, &quot;13 Tales of Rabbi Nachman&quot;, &quot;Tales of Ancient Times&quot;.
*&quot;Tikkun HaKlali&quot; (The General Remedy) – a specific order of 10 Psalms which remedies &quot;p&#x27;gam habrit kodesh&quot; (blemish to the sign of the holy Covenant, i. e., the organ of procreation), and all sins in general.

After Nachman&#x27;s death, Nathan wrote down all the conversations, fragments of lessons, and interactions that he and others had had with Nachman. He published these in the following collections:

*&quot;Shevachei HaRan&quot; (Praises of the Rav Nachman) and &quot;Sichot HaRan&quot; (Conversations of the Rav Nachman) – published in English as &quot;Rabbi Nachman&#x27;s Wisdom&quot;
*&quot;Chayei Moharan&quot; (Life of Our Teacher, Rabbi Nachman) – published in English as &quot;The Life of Rabbi Nachman&quot;

Nathan also authored these commentaries and novellae:
*&quot;Likutei Halachot&quot; (Collected Laws) – an 8-volume Hasidic commentary on &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; which shows the interrelationship between every halakha and Nachman&#x27;s lessons in &quot;Likutei Moharan&quot;.
*&quot;Likutei Tefillot&quot; (Collected Prayers) – 210 direct and heart-felt prayers based on the concepts in &quot;Likutei Moharan&quot;.
*&quot;Yemei Moharanat&quot; (The Days of Our Teacher, Rabbi Nathan) – an autobiography
*&quot;Alim LeTerufah&quot; (Leaves of Healing) – Nathan&#x27;s collected letters
*&quot;Shemot HaTzaddikim&quot; (Names of Tzaddikim) – a list of the tzaddikim of Tanakh, Talmud, Midrash, Kabbalah, and Hasidut, and Geonim of Torah in general Nachman said about this that saying the names of the righteous in every generation is a great virtue and can change nature in favor of the one who said the names of the righteous.

Students of Nathan, their students, and their students&#x27; students added to Breslov literature, with further commentaries on Nachman&#x27;s teachings, as well as original works. See for example .

Beginning in the 1970s, Breslov works in English began to appear, most notably Aryeh Kaplan&#x27;s &quot;Gems of Rabbi Nachman&quot;. The Breslov Research Institute, founded in Jerusalem in 1979, publishes authoritative translations, commentaries, and general works on Breslov Hasidut in the major languages spoken by modern-day Jewish communities: English, Hebrew, Spanish, and Russian.

&quot;The Breslov Siddur&quot;, published in a 2014 hard-cover edition (828 pages in length), is one of the few Hasidic siddurim available in an English language translation (and contains the original text). Translated by Avraham Sutton and Chaim Kramer.

==Today==

Today, Breslover communities exist in several locations in Israel, as well as in major cities around the world with large Jewish populations, including New York, Los Angeles, Paris, London, Montreal, and Lakewood Township, New Jersey. While there are no exact statistics, according to the Breslov Research Institute, the number of core adherents in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak amounts to several thousand families, and several tens in Safed.

The original Jerusalem community was founded by emigres from Ukraine in the late 19th century, and was joined by descendants of the &quot;Yerushami Yishuv haYashan&quot; (Old Yishuv in Jerusalem) community. It is built around the Breslov Yeshiva in Mea Shearim, founded by Eliyahu Chaim Rosen in 1953, which is referred to as the shul. It is affiliated with the Edah HaChareidis, and led by Yaakov Meir Shechter and Shmuel Moshe Kramer.

===Outreach and growth===

The first large-scale Breslov outreach activities were conducted by Levi Yitzchok Bender, who attracted thousands of &quot;baal teshuva&quot; followers to the Breslov movement in the 1970s and 1980s.

Concurrently, Eliezer Shlomo Schick began publishing his nearly 1,000 pamphlets distilling the teachings of Nachman of Breslov, and disseminating them to a worldwide audience. 
Schick founded the Heichal HaKodesh Breslov community – largely consisting of &quot;baalei teshuvah&quot; – in the Galilee town of Yavne&#x27;el, Israel, in 1985. As of 2015, that community had nearly 400 families, representing 30 percent of the town&#x27;s population.

Eliezer Berland, rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Shuvu Bonim in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, has also brought thousands of Jews from secular backgrounds closer to Orthodox Judaism and Breslov. One of Berland&#x27;s students, Shalom Arush, went on to found the Chut Shel Chessed Institutions in Jerusalem. Arush leads a group including Sephardic followers of Breslov Hasidut, who mainly originated in the baal teshuva movement.

Zvi Aryeh Rosenfeld introduced Breslov Hasidism to the United States from the 1960s. He also arranged for the first English translation of two key Breslov texts, Shivchei HaRan and Sichot HaRan.
&quot;Heichal haKodesh&quot;, the Breslov yeshiva in Williamsburg, was founded there by Eliezer Shlomo Schick.
In 1979, one year after Rosenfeld&#x27;s death, his son-in-law, Chaim Kramer, established the Breslov Research Institute to continue the effort to publish Breslov teachings in English.

Other Breslov rabbis engaged in outreach include Israel Isaac Besançon, rabbi of the Shir Chadash community in Tel Aviv, and Shalom Sabag. The Na Nach group, which follows the teachings of Yisroel Ber Odesser, conducts on-the-street outreach with its roving musical vans and dancers, and sidewalk distribution of Breslov texts.

<doc id="304586" wikidata="Q746903" url="?curid=304586" title="Gray Panthers">
<text>The Gray Panthers are a series of multi-generational local advocacy networks in the United States which confront ageism and many other social justice issues. The organization was formed by Maggie Kuhn in response to her forced retirement from the Presbyterian Church at the age of 65 in 1970. The Gray Panthers are named in reference to the Black Panthers.

In addition to its initial response to the issue of mandatory retirement, Gray Panthers have challenged other ageist laws and stereotypes and engaged in anti-war activism, Medicare and Social Security preservation, inter-generational housing, LGBT rights advocacy, environmentalism, the fair treatment of people in nursing homes, and the promotion of single-payer health care.

==History==

=== Founding history ===
Maggie Kuhn&#x27;s interest in older persons’ rights existed well before she founded the Gray Panthers in 1970. She was involved with the White House Conference on Aging in 1961, and appalled by the way people in some retirement homes were treated.

What really sparked her determination to form an activist organization was when she found herself a victim of the lack of rights for older persons in 1970, forced to retire from a job she loved in the Presbyterian Church. Instead of passively accepting retirement, Kuhn decided to band together with other people she knew who were also forced to retire. The lack of accepting the status quo would not just form the Gray Panther organization, but also the Gray Panther name--“It’s a fun name. There’s a certain militancy, rather than just a docile acceptance of what our country’s doing.”

When Kuhn formed the organization, her alliances were not just limited to other older persons facing a plight similar to her own. As indicated by the Gray Panthers’ slogan which endures to this day, “Age and Youth in Action,” she made it a priority to include people of all generations. Gray Panther&#x27;s membership continues to be inclusive of people of diverse ages.

=== Issues in the 1970s and 1980s ===
During this period, the main issues of the Gray Panthers included forced retirement, ageist stereotypes, cuts to Medicare and Social Security, and world peace.

There had been a mandatory forced retirement age at 65, based on the perception that older persons could not be productive members of a workplace after that age. While that stereotype was difficult to overcome, the Panthers were ultimately successful in their efforts to overturn the law, and in 1986, Congress passed a law banning mandatory retirement in most jobs. The law was signed by President Ronald Reagan, as of that time the oldest ever President of the United States.

There were other ageist stereotypes that the Gray Panthers wanted to end. In particular, the stereotype that older persons were “impotent, frail, disabled, demented, or dependent.” By confronting those stereotypes, the Gray Panthers were at the forefront of ideas some considered provocative—namely, ideas that older persons should be able to live in inter-generational housing, and that older people can and should freely have sex. And, of course, many of Maggie Kuhn&#x27;s quotes—including,”Old age is not a disease, it is strength and survivorship, triumph over all kinds of vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illnesses”—were used as weapons against ageist stereotypes.

While the Gray Panthers wanted to counteract the stereotypes that older persons were weak, disabled, and incapable of doing much physical labor, the organization still cared deeply for people who were frail. As such, the organization was among the most vocal opponents to President Reagan&#x27;s proposed cuts to Medicare and Social Security. As with the ban on mandatory retirement, this was an issue where the Gray Panthers were able to get what they wanted because Medicare and Social Security were saved from deep cuts.

Another key facet of Gray Panther work from its early years was its advocacy for peace. The Panthers, both young and old, were particularly vociferous in its opposition to the Vietnam War, and war, in general, was a part of the Gray Panthers platform from the very beginning. The organization&#x27;s work in being anti-war did not stop with Vietnam—the Panthers were opponents of several of President Reagan&#x27;s plans, such as his “Star Wars” and increased foreign intervention in Central America.

=== Issues in the 1990s and 2000s ===
While mandatory retirement ages were abolished in 1986, there were still many threats and social injustices for Gray Panthers to address, including world peace, Medicare and Social Security Benefits, and single-payer health care. They would also become a prominent advocate for LGBT rights.

The organization was prominent in protests against both Iraq Wars, in 1991 and 2003. There were even some Gray Panthers who were arrested over protests in 2003. While such efforts were originally unsuccessful, protesting these wars resonated with younger generations of potential Gray Panthers, therefore, engaging the “youth” part of “Age and Youth in Action.” Furthermore, with the 2003 Iraq War, the Gray Panthers were critical of American intervention years before the majority of Americans shared similar opinions.

The Gray Panthers also advocated for a robust national health care system, whether it be through the preservation of Medicare and Social Security, or through single-payer health care. On these issues, the organization continued to succeed in preserving Medicare and Social Security, though the Clinton Administration&#x27;s health care proposal in 1993-94 fell short of what the Gray Panthers wanted. In fact, the health care plan Maggie Kuhn championed what was described by The New York Times as “the most radical of the various proposals: health insurance paid totally by the government.”

The organization protested President Bill Clinton’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy which kept members of the military from being openly LGBT. The Gray Panthers were, therefore, at the forefront of an issue which was deeply unpopular at the time.

=== Present-day issues ===
In the present day, the Gray Panthers continue to be at the forefront of advocacy against ageism and for social justice at the local, national, and international levels.

Within the United States, the Gray Panthers have received considerable media attention for triggering an audit of nursing home violations, confronting ageist stereotypes at all levels of society, and bringing attention to other issues which affect the quality of life of all seniors. The Gray Panthers are working with the United States Department of Labor to ensure support for family caregivers, and are involved in discussions on how to deliver improved home health care in the United States.

Action and advocacy for older persons is not confined just to the United States. The Gray Panthers have also become increasingly prominent at the United Nations. The organization is one of the strongest advocates for a binding global Convention to protect the Human Rights of Older Persons. Gray Panthers has been instrumental in ensuring that the concerns of older persons have been enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals, the world&#x27;s blueprint for social, economic, and environmental development. Ensuring that the rights of older women would be recognized, Gray Panthers successfully overcame resistance so that the Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women had explicit protections. Gray Panthers has become one of the most prominent American non-governmental organizations advocating for the rights of older persons globally.

<doc id="304587" wikidata="Q643999" url="?curid=304587" title="Coat of arms of England">
<text>The coat of arms of England is the coat of arms historically used as arms of dominion by the monarchs of the Kingdom of England, and now used to symbolise England generally. The arms were adopted 1200 by the Plantagenet kings and continued to be used by successive English and British monarchs; they are currently quartered with the arms of Scotland and Ireland in the coat of arms of the United Kingdom. Historically they were also quartered with the arms of France, representing the English claim to the French throne, and Hanover.

The arms continue to be used in heraldry to represent England, for example in the arms of Canada, although they rarely appear in isolation in royal or government contexts. They have also been adapted by English sporting bodies, forming the basis of the coat of arms of the Football Association, the logo of the England and Wales Cricket Board, England Hockey and England Boxing.

== Description ==

The arms have a red background, on which are three gold lions with blue claws and tongues. The lions are depicted striding dexter (heraldic right), with their right front paw raised and their heads turned to face the viewer. The blazon, or formal heraldic description, is &quot;Gules, three lions passant guardant in pale Or armed and langued Azure&quot;. The &quot;lions passant guardant&quot; were historically referred to as &quot;leopards&quot;, but this refers to their pose rather than species. 

During the existence of the Kingdom of England the arms were usually depicted as part of a full heraldic achievement, the appearance of which has varied over the centuries. 

The first example of a crest on the royal arms was on Edward III&#x27;s third great seal, which shows a helm above the arms, on which is a crowned gold lion standing upon a chapeau. The design has varied little since, and took on its present form in the reign of Henry VIII.

The chapeau was eventually replaced by a crown, the design of which has varied over time. It was usually shown as an open circlet adorned with fleurs-de-lys or stylised leaves until the reign of Henry VI, when the design was altered to include crosses formy. The crown gained a single arch in reign of Edward IV, and a double arch under Henry VII. Since the late 17th century the crown has consisted of a jewelled circlet with alternating crosses formy and fleurs-de-lys, and two arches with a monde surmounted by a cross formy at their intersection. The shape of the arches of the crown has been represented differently at different times, and can help to date a depiction of the crest.

The helm on which the crest was borne was originally a simple steel design, sometimes with gold embellishments. In the reign of Elizabeth I this was changed to a gold helm with a barred visor, facing the viewer, a design which is restricted to royal arms. At the same time the decorative mantling, which was originally red cloth lined with ermine, was altered to cloth of gold lined with ermine.

Animal supporters first appeared in English heraldry in the 15th century. They were not regarded as an integral part of arms, and were frequently changed. The supporters of many medieval monarchs were invented during the Tudor period but are still used to represent them, for instance at St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The supporters became more consistent under the Tudors, and by the reign of Elizabeth I were usually a red Welsh dragon and a gold lion. After the Union of the Crowns the Stuart monarchs swapped the dragon for a Scottish unicorn, and the lion and unicorn have remained the supporters of the royal arms since.

The English royal arms were often shown encircled by the Order of the Garter, England&#x27;s highest order of chivalry, a blue circlet bearing the order&#x27;s Old French motto &quot;Honi soit qui mal y pense&quot; (&quot;Shame be to him who thinks evil of it&quot;). A motto has also been shown on a scroll under the arms since at least the reign of Henry IV, who used &quot;Sovereyne&quot; (&#x27;Sovereign&#x27;). The current motto, (&quot;God and my right&quot;), was first adopted by Henry V, but did not become standardised until 1714.

== History ==
Some of the earliest Royal Emblems depicting lions were first used by the Saxons (Lions were adopted in Germanic tradition around the 5th century) and Danes and re-interpreted in a Christian context in the western kingdoms of Gaul and Northern Italy (around the 6th and 7th centuries), as well as by the Normans. Later, during the reign of the Plantagenets (specifically around the end of the 12th century), a formal and consistent English heraldry system emerged.

The blazon of the arms of Plantagenet is: &quot;Gules, three lions passant guardant in pale or armed and langued azure&quot;, signifying three identical gold lions (also known as leopards) with blue tongues and claws, walking past but facing the observer, arranged in a column on a red background. Although the tincture &quot;azure&quot; of tongue and claws is not cited in many blazons, they are historically a distinguishing feature of the arms of England. This coat, designed in the High Middle Ages, has been variously combined with those of the Kings of France, Scotland, a symbol of Ireland, the House of Nassau and the Kingdom of Hanover, according to dynastic and other political changes occurring in England, but has not altered since it took a fixed form in the reign of Richard I of England (1189–1199), the second Plantagenet king.

The earliest surviving representation of an escutcheon, or shield, displaying three lions is that on the Great Seal of King Richard I (1189–1199), which initially displayed one or two lions rampant, but in 1198 was permanently altered to depict three lions passant, perhaps representing Richard I&#x27;s principal three positions as King of the English, Duke of Normandy, and Duke of Aquitaine.

Much later antiquarians would retrospectively invent attributed arms for earlier kings, but their reigns pre-dated the systematisation of hereditary English heraldry that only occurred in the second half of the 12th century. Lions may have been used as a badge by members of the Norman dynasty: a late-12th century chronicler reports that in 1128, Henry I of England knighted his son-in-law, Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, and gave him a gold lion badge. The memorial enamel created to decorate Geoffrey&#x27;s tomb depicts a blue coat of arms bearing gold lions. His youngest son, William FitzEmpress, used an equestrian seal showing a coat with a single lion rampant, while the eldest son, Henry II (1133–1189) used a lion as his emblem, and based on the arms used by his sons and other relatives, he may have used a coat of arms with a single lion or two lions, though no direct testimony of this has been found. His children experimented with different combinations of lions on their arms. Richard I (1189–1199) used a single lion rampant, or perhaps two lions affrontés, on his first Great Seal of England, but later used three lions passant in his 1198 Great Seal. The arms bear a striking resemblance to the family arms of the Hohenstaufen Emperors adopted at nearly the same time, which Richard would have been acquainted with from his travels, and would show his personal alliance with them. Richard&#x27;s brother John had used a seal during the reigns of his father and elder brother that showed two lions passant, but his adoption of his brother&#x27;s three-lion arms on his succession established this as the lasting design of the royal arms of England.

In 1340, following the extinction of the House of Capet, Edward III claimed the French throne. In addition to initiating the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Edward III expressed his claim in heraldic form by quartering the royal arms of England with the arms of France. This quartering continued until 1801, with intervals in 1360–1369 and 1420–1422.

=== After the Union of the Crowns ===
Following the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, the throne of England was inherited by the Scottish House of Stuart, resulting in the Union of the Crowns: the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland were united in a personal union under James VI and I. As a consequence, the royal arms of England and Scotland were combined in the king&#x27;s new personal arms. Nevertheless, although referencing the personal union with Scotland and Ireland, the royal arms of England remained distinct from the royal arms of Scotland, until the two realms were joined in a political union in 1707, leading to a unified royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom.

=== After the formation of Great Britain ===
On 1 May 1707 the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to form that of Great Britain; to symbolise this their arms were impaled in the first and fourth quarters of the royal arms. French throne continued, albeit passively, until it was mooted by the French Revolution and the formation of the French First Republic in 1792. The Acts of Union 1800 united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Under King George III of the United Kingdom, a proclamation of 1 January 1801 set the royal style and titles and modified the royal arms, removing the French quarter and putting the arms of England, Scotland and Ireland on the same structural level, with the dynastic arms of Hanover moved to an inescutcheon.

=== Development ===
==Royal banner of England==
When the royal arms take the form of an heraldic flag, it is variously known as the Royal Banner of England, the Banner of the Royal Arms, the Banner of the King (Queen) of England, or by the misnomer the Royal Standard of England. This royal banner differs from England&#x27;s national flag, the St George&#x27;s Cross, in that it does not represent any particular area or land, but rather symbolises the sovereignty vested in the rulers thereof.

The royal banner of England is the English banner of arms and so has always borne the royal arms of England—the personal arms of England&#x27;s reigning monarch. When displayed in war or battle, this banner signalled that the sovereign was present in person. Because the royal banner depicted the royal arms of England, its design and composition changed throughout the Middle Ages. It is variously known as the royal banner of England, the banner of the royal arms, the banner of the king of England, or by the misnomer of the royal standard of England; Arthur Charles Fox-Davies explains that it is &quot;a misnomer to term the banner of the royal arms the Royal Standard&quot;, because &quot;the term standard properly refers to the long tapering flag used in battle, by which an overlord mustered his retainers in battle&quot;. The archaeologist and antiquarian Charles Boutell also makes this distinction.

==Contemporary use==

=== Royal heraldry ===
As the arms of England have been superseded by the arms of the United Kingdom the former are rarely seen alone in contemporary contexts. One exception is the Duchy of Lancaster, the monarch&#x27;s private estate, which uses the arms of England differenced by a &#x27;label of France&#x27;, i.e. a blue label of three points with three fleurs-de-lys in each. These arms originated with Edmund Crouchback, the second son of Henry III, whose descendants were created dukes of Lancaster. The duchy merged with the Crown when Henry Bolingbroke became king in 1399.

The arms also make a standalone appearance at coronations, when banners of the individual quarterings of the royal arms are processed through Westminster Abbey.

=== Non-royal heraldry ===

==== Local government ====

Several English towns display adapted versions of the arms of England, often derived from seals which showed the full arms. The most common alterations are to change the tinctures (colours); Dorset County Council, for example, uses a silver field and red lions, and Hereford a red field with silver lions. Several such arms are associated with the Cinque Ports, a confederation of historic ports in southeast England whose arms are those of England dimidiated with three ships&#x27; hulls on a blue field. 

The arms of Berkshire County Council bore arms with two golden lions, referencing the attributed arms of the Norman kings and their early influence upon the county.

A single gold lion, on a red chief, appears on the coats of arms of Canterbury and Chichester. Outside of England, it also appears on the coats of arms of the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, reflecting their heritage.

==== Corporate ====
The arms of England are used by several institutions, often founded by or with a link to the monarchy. Westminster Abbey, for example, includes the fifteenth century version of the arms in its own achievement. At Oxford University, Oriel College uses the royal arms with a border to symbolise that it was founded by Edward II, while at Cambridge University the arms of Christ&#x27;s College, St John&#x27;s College, and St Edmund&#x27;s College include the arms as they were founded by descendants of the royal family.

==== Personal ====
Several families are entitled to use the English arms, usually differenced in some way. This most often occurred through descent from a member of the royal family (e.g. the dukes of Norfolk, descended from Thomas of Brotherton, fifth son of Edward I), or from an illegitimate child of the monarch being granted a version of the royal arms (e.g. the dukes of Richmond, descended from Charles Lennox, illegitimate son of Charles II). 

=== Other uses ===
The English arms, and the three lions passant alone, have become one of the national symbols of England. The three lions have been extensively used in sport, and currently feature in the coats of arms of The Football Association, the England and Wales Cricket Board, and in the logo of England Boxing. In 1997 and 2002 the Royal Mint issued a one pound coin featuring three lions passant to represent England. The arms have also featured on Royal Mail postage stamps, such as a 2001 issue to celebrate St George&#x27;s Day which featured the three lions on second-class stamps.

<text>Brain injury (BI) is the destruction or degeneration of brain cells. Brain injuries occur due to a wide range of internal and external factors. In general, brain damage refers to significant, undiscriminating trauma-induced damage.

A common category with the greatest number of injuries is traumatic brain injury (TBI) following physical trauma or head injury from an outside source, and the term acquired brain injury (ABI) is used in appropriate circles to differentiate brain injuries occurring after birth from injury, from a genetic disorder (GBI), or from a congenital disorder (CBI). Primary and secondary brain injuries identify the processes involved, while focal and diffuse brain injury describe the severity and localization.

Impaired function of affected areas can be compensated through neuroplasticity by forming new neural connections.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of brain injuries vary based on the severity of the injury or how much of the brain is affected. The four categories used for classifying the severity of brain injuries are mild, moderate, or severe.

=== Severity of injuries ===
==== Mild brain injuries ====
Symptoms of a mild brain injury include headaches, confusions, tinnitus, fatigue, changes in sleep patterns, mood or behavior. Other symptoms include trouble with memory, concentration, attention or thinking. Mental fatigue is a common debilitating experience and may not be linked by the patient to the original (minor) incident.

==== Moderate/severe brain injuries ====
Cognitive symptoms include confusion, aggressiveness, abnormal behavior, slurred speech, and coma or other disorders of consciousness. Physical symptoms include headaches that worsen or do not go away, vomiting or nausea, convulsions, brain pulsation, abnormal dilation of the eyes, inability to awaken from sleep, weakness in extremities, and loss of coordination.

=== Symptoms in children ===
Symptoms observed in children include changes in eating habits, persistent irritability or sadness, changes in attention, or disrupted sleeping habits.

===Location of brain damage predicts symptoms===
Symptoms of brain injuries can also be influenced by the location of the injury and as a result impairments are specific to the part of the brain affected. Lesion size is correlated with severity, recovery, and comprehension. Brain injuries often create impairment or disability that can vary greatly in severity.

In cases of severe brain injuries, the likelihood of areas with permanent disability is great, including neurocognitive deficits, delusions (often, to be specific, monothematic delusions), speech or movement problems, and intellectual disability. There may also be personality changes. The most severe cases result in coma or even persistent vegetative state. Even a mild incident can have long-term effects or cause symptoms to appear years later.

Studies show there is a correlation between brain lesion and language, speech, and category-specific disorders. Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia is associated with anomia, unknowingly making up words (neologisms), and problems with comprehension. The symptoms of Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia are caused by damage to the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus.

Damage to the Broca&#x27;s area typically produces symptoms like omitting functional words (agrammatism), sound production changes, dyslexia, dysgraphia, and problems with comprehension and production. Broca&#x27;s aphasia is indicative of damage to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the brain.

An impairment following damage to a region of the brain does not necessarily imply that the damaged area is wholly responsible for the cognitive process which is impaired, however. For example, in pure alexia, the ability to read is destroyed by a lesion damaging both the left visual field and the connection between the right visual field and the language areas (Broca&#x27;s area and Wernicke&#x27;s area). However, this does not mean one with pure alexia is incapable of comprehending speech—merely that there is no connection between their working visual cortex and language areas—as is demonstrated by the fact that people with pure alexia can still write, speak, and even transcribe letters without understanding their meaning.

Lesions to the fusiform gyrus often result in prosopagnosia, the inability to distinguish faces and other complex objects from each other. Lesions in the amygdala would eliminate the enhanced activation seen in occipital and fusiform visual areas in response to fear with the area intact. Amygdala lesions change the functional pattern of activation to emotional stimuli in regions that are distant from the amygdala.

Other lesions to the visual cortex have different effects depending on the location of the damage. Lesions to V1, for example, can cause blindsight in different areas of the brain depending on the size of the lesion and location relative to the calcarine fissure. Lesions to V4 can cause color-blindness, and bilateral lesions to MT/V5 can cause the loss of the ability to perceive motion. Lesions to the parietal lobes may result in agnosia, an inability to recognize complex objects, smells, or shapes, or amorphosynthesis, a loss of perception on the opposite side of the body.

===Non-localizing features===
Brain injuries have far-reaching and varied consequences due to the nature of the brain as the main source of bodily control. Brain-injured people commonly experience issues with memory. This can be issues with either long or short-term memories depending on the location and severity of the injury. Sometimes memory can be improved through rehabilitation, although it can be permanent. Behavioral and personality changes are also commonly observed due to changes of the brain structure in areas controlling hormones or major emotions.

Headaches and pain can occur as a result of a brain injury, either directly from the damage or due to neurological conditions stemming from the injury. Due to the changes in the brain as well as the issues associated with the change in physical and mental capacity, depression and low self-esteem are common side effects that can be treated with psychological help. Antidepressants must be used with caution in brain injury people due to the potential for undesired effects because of the already altered brain chemistry.

===Long term psychological and physiological effects===
There are multiple responses of the body to brain injury, occurring at different times after the initial occurrence of damage, as the functions of the neurons, nerve tracts, or sections of the brain can be affected by damage. The immediate response can take many forms. Initially, there may be symptoms such as swelling, pain, bruising, or loss of consciousness. Post-traumatic amnesia is also common with brain damage, as is temporary aphasia, or impairment of language.

As time progresses, and the severity of injury becomes clear, there are further responses that may become apparent. Due to loss of blood flow or damaged tissue, sustained during the injury, amnesia and aphasia may become permanent, and apraxia has been documented in patients. Amnesia is a condition in which a person is unable to remember things. Aphasia is the loss or impairment of word comprehension or use. Apraxia is a motor disorder caused by damage to the brain, and may be more common in those who have been left brain damaged, with loss of mechanical knowledge critical. Headaches, occasional dizziness, and fatigue—all temporary symptoms of brain trauma—may become permanent, or may not disappear for a long time.

There are documented cases of lasting psychological effects as well, such as emotional changes often caused by damage to the various parts of the brain that control human emotions and behavior. Individuals who have experienced emotional changes related to brain damage may have emotions that come very quickly and are very intense, but have very little lasting effect. Emotional changes may not be triggered by a specific event, and can be a cause of stress to the injured party and their family and friends. Often, counseling is suggested for those who experience this effect after their injury, and may be available as an individual or group session.

The long term psychological and physiological effects will vary by person and injury. For example, perinatal brain damage has been implicated in cases of neurodevelopmental impairments and psychiatric illnesses.

==Causes==
Brain injuries can result from a number of conditions, including:
* Trauma; multiple traumatic injuries can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy. A coup-contrecoup injury occurs when the force impacting the head is not only strong enough to cause a contusion at the site of impact, but also able to move the brain and cause it to displace rapidly into the opposite side of the skull, causing an additional contusion.
** open head injury
** closed head injury
** penetrating: when a sharp object enters the brain, causing a large damage area. Penetrating injuries caused by bullets have a 91 percent mortality rate.
* Deceleration injuries
* Poisoning; for example, from heavy metals including mercury and compounds of lead
* Genetic disorder
* Hypoxia, including birth hypoxia
* Tumors
* Infections
* Stroke leading to infarct, which may follow thrombosis, embolisms, angiomas, aneurysms, and cerebral arteriosclerosis.
* Neurological illness or disorders such as cerebral palsy, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, etc.
* Surgery
* Substance use disorder
* Neurotoxins- pollution exposure or biological exposure (Annonaceae, rotenone, Aspergillus spores, West Nile fever, Viral meningitis)
* Suicide attempt such as hanging, falling off from height, and even on rare occasion getting shot by a firearm, etc.
* Acute total or REM sleep deprivation lasting longer than a day

===Chemotherapy===
Chemotherapy can cause brain damage to the neural stem cells and oligodendrocyte cells that produce myelin. Radiation and chemotherapy can lead to brain tissue damage by disrupting or stopping blood flow to the affected areas of the brain. This damage can cause long term effects such as but not limited to; memory loss, confusion, and loss of cognitive function. The brain damage caused by radiation depends on where the brain tumor is located, the amount of radiation used, and the duration of the treatment. Radiosurgery can also lead to tissue damage that results in about 1 in 20 patients requiring a second operation to remove the damaged tissue.

===Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome===
Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome can cause brain damage and results from a Vitamin B deficiency (specifically vitamin B1, thiamine). This syndrome presents with two conditions, Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy and Korsakoff psychosis. Typically Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy precedes symptoms of Korsakoff psychosis. Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy results from focal accumulation of lactic acid, causing problems with vision, coordination, and balance.

Korsakoff psychosis typically follows after the symptoms of Wernicke&#x27;s decrease. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is typically caused by conditions causing thiamine deficiency, such as chronic heavy alcohol use or by conditions that affect nutritional absorption, including colon cancer, eating disorders and gastric bypass.

===Iatrogenic===
Brain lesions are sometimes intentionally inflicted during neurosurgery, such as the carefully placed brain lesion used to treat epilepsy and other brain disorders. These lesions are induced by excision or by electric shocks (electrolytic lesions) to the exposed brain or commonly by infusion of excitotoxins to specific areas.

===Diffuse axonal===
Diffuse axonal injury is caused by shearing forces on the brain leading to lesions in the white matter tracts of the brain. These shearing forces are seen in cases where the brain had a sharp rotational acceleration, and is caused by the difference in density between white matter and grey matter.

==Body&#x27;s response to brain injury==
Unlike some of the more obvious responses to brain damage, the body also has invisible physical responses which can be difficult to notice. These will generally be identified by a healthcare provider, especially as they are normal physical responses to brain damage. Cytokines are known to be induced in response to brain injury. These have diverse actions that can cause, exacerbate, mediate and/or inhibit cellular injury and repair. TGFβ seems to exert primarily neuroprotective actions, whereas TNFα might contribute to neuronal injury and exert protective effects. IL-1 mediates ischaemic, excitotoxic, and traumatic brain injury, probably through multiple actions on glia, neurons, and the vasculature. Cytokines may be useful in order to discover novel therapeutic strategies. At the current time, they are already in clinical trials.

== Diagnosis ==
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the most widely used scoring system used to assess the level of severity of a brain injury. This method is based on the objective observations of specific traits to determine the severity of a brain injury. It is based on three traits: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response, gauged as described below. Based on the Glasgow Coma Scale severity is classified as follows, severe brain injuries score 3–8, moderate brain injuries score 9–12 and mild score 13–15.

There are several imaging techniques that can aid in diagnosing and assessing the extent of brain damage, such as computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). CT scans and MRI are the two techniques widely used and are most effective. CT scans can show brain bleeds, fractures of the skull, fluid build up in the brain that will lead to increased cranial pressure.

MRI is able to better to detect smaller injuries, detect damage within the brain, diffuse axonal injury, injuries to the brainstem, posterior fossa, and subtemporal and subfrontal regions. However, patients with pacemakers, metallic implants, or other metal within their bodies are unable to have an MRI done. Typically the other imaging techniques are not used in a clinical setting because of the cost, lack of availability.

==Management==
===Acute===
The treatment for emergency traumatic brain injuries focuses on assuring the person has enough oxygen from the brain&#x27;s blood supply, and on maintaining normal blood pressure to avoid further injuries of the head or neck. The person may need surgery to remove clotted blood or repair skull fractures, for which cutting a hole in the skull may be necessary. Medicines used for traumatic injuries are diuretics, anti-seizure or coma-inducing drugs. Diuretics reduce the fluid in tissues lowering the pressure on the brain. In the first week after a traumatic brain injury, a person may have a risk of seizures, which anti-seizure drugs help prevent. Coma-inducing drugs may be used during surgery to reduce impairments and restore blood flow. Mouse NGF has been licensed in China since 2003 and is used to promote neurological recovery in a range of brain injuries, including intracerebral hemorrhage.

In the case of brain damage from traumatic brain injury, dexamethasone and/or Mannitol may be used.
===Chronic===
Various professions may be involved in the medical care and rehabilitation of someone with an impairment after a brain injury. Neurologists, neurosurgeons, and physiatrists are physicians specialising in treating brain injury. Neuropsychologists (especially clinical neuropsychologists) are psychologists specialising in understanding the effects of brain injury and may be involved in assessing the severity or creating rehabilitation strategies. Occupational therapists may be involved in running rehabilitation programs to help restore lost function or help re-learn essential skills. Registered nurses, such as those working in hospital intensive care units, are able to maintain the health of the severely brain-injured with constant administration of medication and neurological monitoring, including the use of the Glasgow Coma Scale used by other health professionals to quantify extent of orientation.

Physiotherapists also play a significant role in rehabilitation after a brain injury. In the case of a traumatic brain injury (TBI), physiotherapy treatment during the post-acute phase may include sensory stimulation, serial casting and splinting, fitness and aerobic training, and functional training. Sensory stimulation refers to regaining sensory perception through the use of modalities. There is no evidence to support the efficacy of this intervention. Serial casting and splinting are often used to reduce soft tissue contractures and muscle tone. Evidence based research reveals that serial casting can be used to increase passive range of motion (PROM) and decrease spasticity.

Functional training may also be used to treat patients with TBIs. To date, no studies supports the efficacy of sit to stand training, arm ability training and body weight support systems (BWS). Overall, studies suggest that patients with TBIs who participate in more intense rehabilitation programs will see greater benefits in functional skills. More research is required to better understand the efficacy of the treatments mentioned above.

Other treatments for brain injury can include medication, psychotherapy, neuropsychological rehabilitation, neurotherapy and/or surgery.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis, or the likely progress of a disorder, depends on the nature, location, and cause of the brain damage (see Traumatic brain injury, Focal and diffuse brain injury, Primary and secondary brain injury).

In general, neuroregeneration can occur in the peripheral nervous system but is much rarer and more difficult to assist in the central nervous system (brain or spinal cord). However, in neural development in humans, areas of the brain can learn to compensate for other damaged areas, and may increase in size and complexity and even change function, just as someone who loses a sense may gain increased acuity in another sense—a process termed neuroplasticity.

There are many misconceptions that revolve around brain injuries and brain damage. One misconception is that if someone has brain damage then they cannot fully recover. Recovery depends a variety of factors; such as severity and location. Testing is done to note severity and location. Not everyone fully heals from brain damage, but it is possible to have a full recovery. Brain injuries are very hard to predict in outcome. Many tests and specialists are needed to determine the likelihood of the prognosis. People with minor brain damage can have debilitating side effects; not just severe brain damage has debilitating effects.

The side-effects of a brain injury depend on location and the body&#x27;s response to injury. Even a mild concussion can have long term effects that may not resolve. Another misconception is that children heal better from brain damage. Children are at greater risk for injury due to lack of maturity. It makes future development hard to predict. This is because different cortical areas mature at different stages, with some major cell populations and their corresponding cognitive faculties remaining unrefined until early adulthood. In the case of a child with frontal brain injury, for example, the impact of the damage may be undetectable until that child fails to develop normal executive functions in his or her late teens and early twenties.

== History ==
The foundation for understanding human behavior and brain injury can be attributed to the case of Phineas Gage and the famous case studies by Paul Broca. The first case study on Phineas Gage&#x27;s head injury is one of the most astonishing brain injuries in history. In 1848, Phineas Gage was paving way for a new railroad line when he encountered an accidental explosion of a tamping iron straight through his frontal lobe. Gage observed to be intellectually unaffected but was claimed by some to have exemplified post-injury behavioral deficits.

Ten years later, Paul Broca examined two patients exhibiting impaired speech due to frontal lobe injuries. Broca&#x27;s first patient lacked productive speech. He saw this as an opportunity to address language localization. It was not until Leborgne, informally known as &quot;tan&quot;, died when Broca confirmed the frontal lobe lesion from an autopsy. The second patient had similar speech impairments, supporting his findings on language localization. The results of both cases became a vital verification of the relationship between speech and the left cerebral hemisphere. The affected area is known today as Broca&#x27;s area and the condition as Broca&#x27;s aphasia.

A few years later, a German neuroscientist, Carl Wernicke, consulted on a stroke patient. The patient experienced neither speech nor hearing impairments, but had a few brain deficits. These deficits included lacking the ability to comprehend what was spoken to him and the words written down. After his death, Wernicke examined his autopsy that found a lesion located in the left temporal region. This area became known as Wernicke&#x27;s area. Wernicke later hypothesized the relationship between Wernicke&#x27;s area and Broca&#x27;s area, which was proven fact.

<text>Clarence Albertson Barlow (also Klarenz; 27 December 1945 – 29 June 2023) was a British composer of classical and electroacoustic works. He was an academic teacher internationally, at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague from 1990 and at the University of California, Santa Barbara, from 2006, among others. He taught at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse from 1982 to 1994.

== Life ==
=== Early life and education ===
Barlow was born on 27 December 1945 in Calcutta, British India. Of English, Portuguese, and French colonial descent, he wrote his first compositions in 1957. He studied piano, music theory and natural sciences. In 1965 he received a science degree from Calcutta University, as well as a Licentiate Diploma in piano from Trinity College of Music in London. From 1966 to 1968 he taught music theory and worked as a conductor at the Calcutta School of Music.

In 1968 Barlow relocated to Cologne, where he studied electronic music and composition at the Hochschule für Musik Köln with Herbert Eimert, Vinko Globokar, Bernd Alois Zimmermann (1968 to 1970) and Karlheinz Stockhausen (1971 to 1973). From 1971 to 1972 he also studied at the Institute of Sonology of Utrecht University, where he began to use computers as an aid for compositions.

=== Career ===
Barlow was one of the founders of Initiative Musik und Informatik Köln in 1986. He taught at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse from 1982 to 1994. In 1988 he was the director of music at the International Computer Music Conference in Cologne. From 1990 to 1994, Barlow was the artistic director of the Institute of Sonology, at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, where he also taught in the composition department, continuing until 2006. He was a visiting professor of composition at the Folkwang Hochschule Essen in 1990 and 1991. He was a member of the Académie Internationale de Musique Electroacoustique in Bourges from 1994 to 2010, and visiting professor of composition at the School of Music and Performing Arts ESMAE in Porto in 2005 and 2006.

Barlow was the Corwin Endowed Chair and head of composition at University of California, Santa Barbara&#x27;s Music Department from 2006 to 2019. He was visiting professor at the Catalonia College of Music in Barcelona from 2018 to 2020. Among his students were Dennis Báthory-Kitsz, Marko Ciciliani, Georg Hajdu, Rozalie Hirs, Gabriel Pareyon and Kristoffer Zegers.

=== Personal life ===
Barlow was married to the artist Birgit Faustmann. He was severely injured in a fall in April 2023. He died in Barcelona on 29 June 2023 aged 77.

== Compositions ==
Barlow became known as a pioneer of electronic and computer music, with advancements in interdisciplinary works including mathematics and computer science, visual arts and literature. His music incorporated tradition and elements inherited from the past. His works were mostly written for traditional instruments, including elements also from other cultures. Barlow preferred traditional timbres to synthesized ones because &quot;they sound so much more alive and exciting&quot;. He frequently used computers to generate the structures of his works. His comprehensive theory of tonality and metrics was first tested in the piano work &quot;Çoǧluotobüsişletmesi&quot; (1975–79). Spectral analysis and instrumental resynthesis of human speech also played an important role in his compositions.

Between 1959 and 2020 Barlow composed more than 100 works, including orchestral works such as two piano concertos, 40 pieces of chamber music including two string quartets, works for music theater, choral and vocal compositions, 30 piano pieces, five film scores and 20 electroacoustic works.

<text>Margaret Eliza &quot;Maggie&quot; Kuhn (August 3, 1905 – April 22, 1995) was an American activist known for founding the Gray Panthers movement, after she was forced to retire from her job at the then-mandatory retirement age of 65. The Gray Panthers became known for advocating nursing home reform and fighting ageism, claiming that &quot;old people and women constitute America&#x27;s biggest untapped and undervalued human energy source.&quot; She dedicated her life to fighting for human rights, social and economic justice, global peace, integration, and an understanding of mental health issues. For decades, she combined her activism with caring for her disabled mother and a brother who suffered from mental illness. Embracing her age and activism, she referred to herself as a &quot;wrinkled radical.&quot; By the mid-1970s, Kuhn had achieved national celebrity status, speaking at over 200 engagements a year and appearing on shows like &#x27;The Phil Donahue Show,&#x27; &#x27;Today,&#x27; and &#x27;The Tonight Show&#x27; with Johnny Carson. In 1978, the &quot;World Almanac&quot; named her one of the 25 most influential women in the United States.

==Early life and career==
Kuhn was born in Buffalo, New York, the elder of Minnie Louise Kooman and Samuel Frederick Kuhn&#x27;s two children. Her father managed the Memphis, Tennessee office of the conservative Bradstreet Company (later Dun &amp; Bradstreet) and spent her childhood in Cleveland, Ohio and Buffalo as her mother did not want her children raised in the then-segregated South. She majored in English at the Flora Stone Mather College of Case Western Reserve University.

She worked for the YWCA in both Cleveland, OH and Philadelphia, PA from 1930 to 1941, and for the National Board of the YWCA in New York, NY from 1941 to 1947. During this time she developed a strong theoretical and practical framework for social justice and activism. She educated women about unionizing, women&#x27;s issues, and social issues. She caused controversy by starting a human sexuality class in which she discussed such topics as the mechanics of sex, birth control, sexual pleasure, pregnancy, and the difficulties of remaining single in a culture where marriage is the norm. During World War II, she became program director for the YWCA-USO, which was a controversial career choice due to her opposition to the war. In spite of this, she continued to advocate a progressive stance on issues such as desegregation, urban housing, McCarthyism, the Cold War, and nuclear arms.

Kuhn worked for the General Alliance of Unitarian and Other Liberal Christian Women in Boston, MA from 1947 to 1948. She then worked for the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s national Board of Christian Education from 1948 until 1965, and for the Presbyterian Board of National Missions from 1965 to 1970. She was able to work at the national level of the church to help shape the shift in focus from the social gospel framework to that of social justice. This gave a more powerful framework, social dimension, and social justice themes to this work of the church and the way the church interpreted the Old and New Testaments. This may be, in part, rooted in her ancestral Jewish background and the tradition of tikkun olam. While tradition confined most seminarians to fieldwork within churches, Kuhn declared that none of her students would pass unless they went out and found poverty within the local community.

==Gray Panthers==

In 1970, although she was working at a job she loved with the Presbyterian Church, she was forced to retire the day she turned 65 because of the mandatory retirement law then in effect. That year, she banded together with other retirees and formed the movement that became known as the Gray Panthers. It was originally called &quot;The Consultation of Older and Younger Adults for Social Change.&quot; The name &quot;Gray Panthers&quot; was first suggested by Rev. Reuben Gums, a WPIX-TV producer in New York City, who, after hearing Kuhn advocate for militancy among older adults, proposed the more impactful name. It was quickly adopted as their public identity, attracting media attention and public support, and became the official name of the movement in 1972. In 1977, an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Johnny Carson further popularized the name. Carson mistakenly introduced Kuhn as part of the &quot;Black Panthers&quot; before correcting himself.On Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show on February 18, 1977, a gray-haired, seventy-two-year-old white woman wearing a Mao jacket with her hair in a bun strode out as one of Carson’s guests. In his opening monologue, he mistakenly introduced her as Maggie Kuhn of “the Black Panthers” and then, cracking up as he realized his not-inconsiderable mistake, corrected himself while emphasizing that she was the founder of the Gray Panthers, not the Black Panthers, and that she was a champion for &#x27;old people’s power&#x27;. Kuhn in turn assured him it was OK to mix up the name in the monologue because she said the Black Panthers and Gray Panthers were collaborating on &#x27;some very good things.&#x27;Seeing all issues of injustice as inevitably linked, the Gray Panthers refused to restrict themselves to elder rights activism, but focused also on peace, presidential elections, poverty, and civil liberties. Their first big issue was opposition to the Vietnam War.

After an elderly woman was murdered and robbed of $309 after cashing a check, Kuhn enlisted the help of Ralph Nader who set up a meeting with the president of the First Pennsylvania Bank. The bank agreed to establish special check-drawn savings accounts for people over 65 free of charge and make loans more accessible to older people.

The Gray Panthers&#x27; motto was &quot;Age and Youth In Action,&quot; and many of its members were high school and college students. Kuhn believed that teens should be taken more seriously and given more responsibility by society. To her, this was just another example of a fast-paced, exploitative culture wasting vital human resources.

The Gray Panthers also combated the then-popular &quot;disengagement theory,&quot; which argues that old age involves a necessary separation from society as a prelude to death. Kuhn implicated the American lifestyle for treating the old as problems of society and not as persons experiencing the problems created by society. She accused gerontologists of perpetuating the illusion of old people as incapacitated, noting that grant money seemed to favor such research. She called into question the representation of old people in popular media.

Kuhn raised controversy by openly discussing the sexuality of older people, and shocked the public with her assertion that older women, who outlive men by an average of 8 years, could develop sexual relationships with younger men or each other. She also took a stance on Social Security, arguing that politicians had created an intergenerational war over federal funds in order to divert public attention from the real budgetary issues: overspending on the military and extravagant tax breaks for the rich.

Kuhn criticized housing for the elderly, calling them &quot;glorified playpens&quot;. While acknowledging that they helped to keep seniors safe, she contended that they also segregated the elderly from mainstream society. In Maggie Kuhn on Aging, she described the structural reforms needed to address these problems with elder housing, mandatory retirement, and social and economic inequities. During her years as a Gray Panther activist, she lived in her own home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She shared that home with younger adults, who received a break on rent in exchange for their help with chores and their companionship. Maggie called this community her &quot;family of choice.&quot; Kuhn founded the Shared Housing Resource Center. She worked with Anne Hays Egan and Carroll L. Estes to develop the Festival of the Ages in Princeton, in 1981. The proceedings of the festival were published as a book, &quot;Empowering Ministry in an Ageist Society&quot;.

Kuhn wrote her autobiography, &quot;No Stone Unturned&quot;, in 1991—four years before she died of cardiac arrest in Philadelphia at the age of 89. In 1995, Kuhn was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<doc id="304601" wikidata="Q46057" url="?curid=304601" title="1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine">
<text>A popular uprising by Palestinian Arabs in Mandatory Palestine against the British administration, later known as the Great Revolt, the Great Palestinian Revolt, or the Palestinian Revolution, lasted from 1936 until 1939. The movement sought independence from British colonial rule and the end of British support for Zionism, including Jewish immigration and land sales to Jews.

The uprising occurred during a peak in the influx of European Jewish immigrants, and with the growing plight of the rural fellahin rendered landless, who as they moved to metropolitan centres to escape their abject poverty found themselves socially marginalized. Since the Battle of Tel Hai in 1920, Jews and Arabs had been involved in a cycle of attacks and counter-attacks, and the immediate spark for the uprising was the murder of two Jews by a Qassamite band, and the retaliatory killing by Jewish gunmen of two Arab labourers, incidents which triggered a flare-up of violence across Palestine. A month into the disturbances, Amin al-Husseini, president of the Arab Higher Committee and Mufti of Jerusalem, declared 16 May 1936 as &#x27;Palestine Day&#x27; and called for a general strike. David Ben-Gurion, leader of the Yishuv, described Arab causes as fear of growing Jewish economic power, opposition to mass Jewish immigration and fear of the British identification with Zionism.

The general strike lasted from April to October 1936. The revolt is often analysed in terms of two distinct phases. The first phase began as spontaneous popular resistance, which was seized on by the urban and elitist Arab Higher Committee, giving the movement an organized shape that was focused mainly on strikes and other forms of political protest, in order to secure a political result. By October 1936, this phase had been defeated by the British civil administration using a combination of political concessions, international diplomacy (involving the rulers of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Transjordan and Yemen) and the threat of martial law. The second phase, which began late in 1937, was a peasant-led resistance movement provoked by British repression in 1936 in which increasingly British forces were targeted as the army itself increasingly targeted the villages it thought supportive of the revolt. During this phase, the rebellion was brutally suppressed by the British Army and the Palestine Police Force using repressive measures that were intended to intimidate the whole population and undermine popular support for the revolt. A more dominant role on the Arab side was taken by the Nashashibi clan, whose NDP party quickly withdrew from the rebel Arab Higher Committee, led by the radical faction of Amin al-Husseini, and instead sided with the British – dispatching &quot;Fasail al-Salam&quot; (the &quot;Peace Bands&quot;) in coordination with the British Army against nationalist and Jihadist Arab &quot;Fasail&quot; units (literally &quot;bands&quot;).

According to official British figures covering the whole revolt, the army and police killed more than 2,000 Arabs in combat, 108 were hanged, and 961 died because of what they described as &quot;gang and terrorist activities&quot;. In an analysis of the British statistics, Walid Khalidi estimates 19,792 casualties for the Arabs, with 5,032 dead: 3,832 killed by the British and 1,200 dead due to intracommunal terrorism, and 14,760 wounded. By one estimate, ten percent of the adult male Palestinian Arab population between 20 and 60 was killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled. Estimates of the number of Palestinian Jews killed are up to several hundred.

The Arab revolt in Mandatory Palestine was unsuccessful, and its consequences affected the outcome of the 1948 Palestine war. It caused the British Mandate to give crucial support to pre-state Zionist militias like the Haganah, whereas on the Palestinian Arab side, the revolt forced the flight into exile of the main Palestinian Arab leader of the period, al-Husseini.

== Economic background ==
World War I left Palestine, especially the countryside, deeply impoverished. The Ottoman and then the Mandate authorities levied high taxes on farming and agricultural produce and during the 1920s and 1930s this together with a fall in prices, cheap imports, natural disasters and paltry harvests all contributed to the increasing indebtedness of the fellahin. The rents paid by tenant fellah increased sharply, owing to increased population density, and growing transfer of land from Arabs to the Jewish settlement agencies, such as the Jewish National Fund, increased the number of fellahin evicted while also removing the land as a future source of livelihood. By 1931 the 106,400 dunums of low-lying Category A farming land in Arab possession supported a farming population of 590,000 whereas the 102,000 dunums of such land in Jewish possession supported a farming population of only 50,000. The late 1920s witnessed poor harvests, and the consequent immiseration grew even harsher with the onset of the Great Depression and the collapse of commodity prices. The Shaw Commission in 1930 had identified the existence of a class of &#x27;embittered landless people&#x27; as a contributory factor to the preceding 1929 disturbances, and the problem of these &#x27;landless&#x27; Arabs grew particularly grave after 1931, causing High Commissioner Wauchope to warn that this &#x27;social peril ... would serve as a focus of discontent and might even result in serious disorders.&#x27;
Economic factors played a major role in the outbreak of the Arab revolt. Palestine&#x27;s fellahin, the country&#x27;s peasant farmers, made up over two-thirds of the indigenous Arab population and from the 1920s onwards they were pushed off the land in increasingly large numbers into urban environments where they often encountered only poverty and social marginalisation. Many were crowded into shanty towns in Jaffa and Haifa where some found succour and encouragement in the teachings of the charismatic preacher Izz ad-Din al-Qassam who worked among the poor in Haifa. The revolt was thus a popular uprising that produced its own leaders and developed into a national revolt.

Although the Mandatory government introduced measures to limit the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews, these were easily circumvented by willing buyers and sellers. The failure of the authorities to invest in economic growth and healthcare for the general Palestinian public and the Zionist policy of ensuring that their investments were directed only to facilitate expansion exclusively of the Yishuv further compounded matters. The government did, however, set the minimum wage for Arab workers below that for Jewish workers, which meant that those making capital investments in the Yishuv&#x27;s economic infrastructure, such as Haifa&#x27;s electricity plant, the Shemen oil and soap factory, the Grands Moulins flour mills and the Nesher cement factory, could take advantage of cheap Arab labour pouring in from the countryside. After 1935 the slump in the construction boom and further concentration by the Yishuv on an exclusivist Hebrew labour programme removed most of the sources of employment for rural migrants. By 1935 only 12,000 Arabs (5% of the workforce) worked in the Jewish sector, half of these in agriculture, whereas 32,000 worked for the Mandate authorities and 211,000 were either self-employed or worked for Arab employers.

The ongoing disruption of agrarian life in Palestine, which had been continuing since Ottoman times, thus created a large population of landless peasant farmers who subsequently became mobile wage workers who were increasingly marginalised and impoverished; these became willing participants in nationalist rebellion. At the same time, Jewish immigration peaked in 1935, just months before Palestinian Arabs began their full-scale, nationwide revolt. Over the four years between 1933 and 1936 more than 164,000 Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine, and between 1931 and 1936 the Jewish population more than doubled from 175,000 to 370,000 people, increasing the Jewish population share from 17% to 27%, and bringing about a significant deterioration in relations between Palestinian Arabs and Jews. In 1936 alone, some 60,000 Jews immigrated that year – the Jewish population having grown under British auspices from 57,000 to 320,000 in 1935

== Political and socio-cultural background ==

The advent of Zionism and British colonial administration crystallised Palestinian nationalism and the desire to defend indigenous traditions and institutions. Palestinian society was largely clan-based (&quot;hamula&quot;), with an urban land-holding elite lacking a centralised leadership. Traditional feasts such as Nebi Musa began to acquire a political and nationalist dimension and new national memorial days were introduced or gained new significance; among them Balfour Day (2 November), the anniversary of the Battle of Hattin (4 July), and beginning in 1930, 16 May was celebrated as Palestine Day. The expansion of education, the development of civil society and of transportation, communications, and especially of broadcasting and other media, all facilitated notable changes. The Yishuv itself, at the same time, was steadily building the structures for its own state-building with public organisations like the Jewish Agency and the covert creation and consolidation of a paramilitary arm with the Haganah and Irgun.

In 1930 Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam organised and established the Black Hand, a small anti-Zionist and anti-British militia. He recruited and arranged military training for impoverished but pious peasants but also for ex-criminals he had persuaded to take Islam seriously and they engaged in a campaign of vandalizing tree plantations and British-constructed rail lines, destroying phone lines and disrupting transportation. Three minor mujāhīdūn and jihadist groups had also been formed that advocated armed struggle; these were the Green Hand (&quot;al-Kaff al-Khaḍrā&quot;) -active in the area of Acre-Safed-Nazareth from 1929 until 1930 when they were dispersed; the Organization for Holy Struggle (&quot;al-Jihād al-Muqaddas&quot;), led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and operative in the areas of Jerusalem (1931–1934); and the Rebel Youth (&quot;al-Shabāb al-Thā&#x27;ir&quot;), active in the Tulkarm and Qalqilyah area from 1935, and composed mainly of local boy scouts.)

The pressures of the 1930s wrought several changes, giving rise to new political organizations and a broader activism that spurred a far wider cross-section of the population in rural areas, strongly nationalist, to join actively in the Palestinian cause. Among new political parties formed in this period were the Independence Party which called for an Indian Congress Party-style boycott of the British, the pro-Nashashibi National Defence Party, the pro-Husayni Palestinian Arab Party the pro-Khalidi Arab-Palestinian Reform Party, and the National Bloc, based mainly around Nablus.

Youth organisations emerged like Young Men&#x27;s Muslim Association and the Youth Congress Party, the former anti-Zionist, the latter pan-Arab. The Palestinian Boy Scout Movement, founded early in 1936, became active in the general strike. Women&#x27;s organisations, which had been active in social matters, became politically involved from the end of the 1920s, with an Arab Women&#x27;s Congress held in Jerusalem in 1929 attracting 200 participants, and an Arab Women&#x27;s Association (later Arab Women&#x27;s Union) being established at the same time, both organised by feminist Tarab Abdul Hadi. Myriads of rural women would play an important role in response to &quot;faz&#x27;a&quot; alarm calls for inter-village help by rallying in defence of the rebellion.

==Inspiration from abroad==
General strikes had been used in neighbouring Arab countries to place political pressures on Western colonial powers. In Iraq a general strike in July 1931, accompanied by organised demonstrations in the streets, led to independence for the former British mandate territory under Prime Minister Nuri as-Said, and full membership of the League of Nations in October 1932.The Syrian national movement had used a general strike from 20 January to 6 March in 1936 which, despite harsh reprisals, brought about negotiations in Paris that led to a Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence. This showed that determined economic and political pressure could challenge a fragile imperial administration.

==Prelude==
On 16 October 1935 a large arms shipment camouflaged in cement bins, comprising 25 Lewis guns and their bipods, 800 rifles and 400,000 rounds of ammunition destined for the Haganah, was discovered during unloading at the port of Jaffa. The news sparked Arab fears of a Jewish military takeover of Palestine. A little over two weeks later, on 2 November 1935, al-Qassam gave a speech in the port of Haifa denouncing the Balfour declaration on its 18th anniversary. In a proclamation to that effect, together with Jamal al-Husayni, he alluded to the Haganah weapons smuggling operation. Questioned at the time by a confidant about his preparations, he stated that he had 15 men, each furnished with a rifle and one cartridge. Soon after, perhaps fearing a pending preemptive arrest, he disappeared with his group into the hills, not to start a revolution, premature at that point, but to impress upon people that he was a man ready to do what he said should be done. Some weeks later, a Jewish policeman was shot dead in a citrus grove while investigating the theft of grapefruit, after he happened to come close to the Qassamites&#x27; encampment. Following the incident, the Palestine police launched a massive manhunt and surrounded al-Qassam in a cave just north of Ya&#x27;bad. In the ensuing battle, on 20 November, al-Qassam was killed.

The death of al-Qassam generated widespread outrage among Palestinian Arabs, galvanizing public sentiments with an impact similar to the effect on the Yishuv of news of the death of Joseph Trumpeldor in 1920 at the Tel Hai settlement. Huge crowds gathered for the occasion of his obsequies in Haifa and later burial in Balad al-Shaykh. 

The actual uprising was triggered some five months later, on 15 April 1936, by the Anabta shooting where remnants of a Qassamite band stopped a convoy on the road from Nablus to Tulkarm, robbed its passengers and, stating that they were acting to revenge al-Qassam&#x27;s death, shot 3 Jewish passengers, two fatally, after ascertaining their identity. One of the three, Israel Chazan, was from Thessaloniki. The Salonican community&#x27;s request that permission be granted to allow them to conduct a solemn funeral for Chasan was turned down by the district commissioner, who had allowed al-Qassam a ceremonial burial some months earlier. The refusal sparked a demonstration by 30,000 Jews in Tel Aviv who overcame the police and maltreated Arab labourers and damaged property in Jaffa. The following day, two Arab workers sleeping in a hut in a banana plantation beside the highway between Petah Tikva and Yarkona were assassinated in retaliation by members of the Haganah-Bet. 

Jews and Palestinians attacked each other in and around Tel Aviv. Palestinians in Jaffa rampaged through a Jewish residential area, resulting in several Jewish deaths. After four days, by 19 April, the deteriorating situation erupted into a set of countrywide disturbances. An Arab general strike and revolt ensued that lasted until October 1936.

==Timeline==

===Arab general strike and armed insurrection, April–October 1936===

The strike began on 19 April in Nablus, where an Arab National Committee was formed, and by the end of the month National Committees had been formed in all of the towns and some of the larger villages. On the same day, the High Commissioner Wauchope issued Emergency Regulations that laid the legal basis for suppressing the insurgency. On 21 April the leaders of the five main parties accepted the decision at Nablus and called for a general strike of all Arabs engaged in labour, transport and shopkeeping for the following day.

While the strike was initially organised by workers and local committees, under pressure from below, political leaders became involved to help with co-ordination. This led to the formation on 25 April 1936 of the Arab Higher Committee (AHC). The Committee resolved &quot;to continue the general strike until the British Government changes its present policy in a fundamental manner&quot;; the demands were threefold: (1) the prohibition of Jewish immigration; (2) the prohibition of the transfer of Arab land to Jews; (3) the establishment of a National Government responsible to a representative council.

About one month after the general strike started, the leadership group declared a general non-payment of taxes in explicit opposition to Jewish immigration.

In the countryside, armed insurrection started sporadically, becoming more organized over time. One particular target of the rebels was the Mosul–Haifa oil pipeline of the Iraq Petroleum Company constructed only a few years earlier to Haifa from a point on the Jordan River south of Lake Tiberias. This was repeatedly bombed at various points along its length. Other attacks were on railways (including trains) and on civilian targets such as Jewish settlements, secluded Jewish neighbourhoods in the mixed cities, and Jews, both individually and in groups. During the summer of that year, thousands of Jewish-farmed acres and orchards were destroyed, Jewish civilians were attacked and murdered, and some Jewish communities, such as those in Beisan and Acre, fled to safer areas.

The measures taken against the strike were harsh from the outset and grew harsher as the revolt deepened. Unable to contain the protests with the two battalions already stationed in the country, Britain inundated Palestine with soldiers from regiments all over the empire, including its Egyptian garrison. The drastic measures taken included house searches without warrants, night raids, preventive detention, caning, flogging, deportation, confiscation of property, and torture. As early as May 1936 the British formed armed Jewish units equipped with armoured vehicles to serve as auxiliary police.

The British government in Palestine was convinced that the strike had the full support of the Palestinian Arabs and they could see &quot;no weakening in the will and spirit of the Arab people.&quot; Air Vice-Marshall Richard Peirse, commander of British forces in Palestine and Transjordan from 1933 to 1936, reported that because the rebel armed bands were supported by villagers,

It was quickly evident that the only way to regain the initiative from the rebels was by initiating measures against the villagers from which the rebels and saboteurs came ... I therefore initiated, in co-operation with the Inspector-General of Police R. G. B. Spicer, village searches. Ostensibly, these searches were undertaken to find arms and wanted persons, actually the measures adopted by the Police on the lines of similar Turkish methods, were punitive and effective.

In reality the measures created a sense of solidarity between the villagers and the rebels. The pro-Government Mayor of Nablus complained to the High Commissioner that, &quot;During the last searches effected in villages properties were destroyed, jewels stolen, and the Holy Qur&#x27;an torn, and this has increased the excitement of the fellahin.&quot; However, Moshe Shertok of the Jewish Agency even suggested that all villages in the area of an incident should be punished.

On 2 June, an attempt by rebels to derail a train bringing the 2nd Battalion Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment from Egypt led to the railways being put under guard, placing a great strain on the security forces. On 4 June, in response to this situation, the government rounded up a large number of Palestinian leaders and sent them to a detention camp at Auja al-Hafir in the Negev desert.

The Battle of Nur Shams on 21 June marked an escalation with the largest engagement of British troops against Arab militants so far in this Revolt.

During July, Arab volunteers from Syria and Transjordan, led by Fawzi al-Qawukji, helped the rebels to divide their formations into four fronts, each led by a District Commander who had armed platoons of 150–200 fighters, each commanded by a platoon leader.

A Statement of Policy issued by the Colonial Office in London on 7 September declared the situation a &quot;direct challenge to the authority of the British Government in Palestine&quot; and announced the appointment of Lieutenant-General John Dill as supreme military commander. By the end of September British troops in Palestine were deployed to &quot;round up Arab bands&quot;.

In June 1936 the British involved their clients in Transjordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Egypt in an attempt to pacify the Palestinian Arabs and on 9 October the rulers made an appeal for the strike to be ended. A more pressing concern may have been the approaching citrus harvest and the attractive, soaring prices on the international markets caused by the disruption to the Spanish citrus harvest due to the Spanish Civil War.

On 22 August 1936, Anglo-Jewish Arabist scholar Levi Billig of Hebrew University was murdered in his home outside Jerusalem by an Arab assassin, one of three Jews killed by Arabs on 22 August, and one of 73 Jews killed since the beginning of the Arab armed insurrection.

===Peel commission; break in hostilities (October 1936 – September 1937)===
The strike was called off on 11 October 1936 and the violence abated for about a year while the Peel Commission deliberated. The Royal Commission was announced on 18 May 1936 and its members were appointed on 29 July, but the Commission did not arrive in Palestine until 11 November. In the early 1920s the first High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel, had failed to create a unified political structure embracing both Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews in constitutional government with joint political institutions. This failure facilitated internal institutional partition in which the Jewish Agency exercised a degree of autonomous control over the Jewish settlement and the Supreme Muslim Council performed a comparable role for Muslims. Thus, well before Lord Peel arrived in Palestine on 11 November 1936, the groundwork for territorial partition as proposed by the Royal Commission in its report on 7 July 1937 had already been done.

The commission, which concluded that 1,000 Arab rebels had been killed during the six month strike, later described the disturbances as &quot;an open rebellion of the Palestinian Arabs, assisted by fellow-Arabs from other countries, against Mandatory rule&quot; and noted two unprecedented features of the revolt: the support of all senior Arab officials in the political and technical departments in the Palestine administration (including all of the Arab judges) and the &quot;interest and sympathy of the neighbouring Arab peoples&quot;, which had resulted in support for the rebellion in the form of volunteers from Syria and Iraq.
Peel&#x27;s main recommendation was for partition of Palestine into a small Jewish state (based on current Jewish land ownership population and incorporating the country&#x27;s most productive agricultural land), a residual Mandatory area, and a larger Arab state linked to Transjordan. A second and more radical proposal was for transfer of 225,000 Palestinian Arabs from the proposed Jewish state to a future Arab state and Transjordan. It is likely that Zionist leaders played a role in persuading Peel to accept the notion of transfer, which had been a strand of Zionist ideology from its inception.

The Arab Higher Committee rejected the recommendations immediately, as did the Jewish Revisionists. Initially, the religious Zionists, some of the General Zionists, and sections of the Labour Zionist movement also opposed the recommendations. Ben-Gurion was delighted by the Peel Commission&#x27;s support for transfer, which he viewed as the foundation of &quot;national consolidation in a free homeland.&quot; Subsequently, the two main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and Ben Gurion had convinced the Zionist Congress to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for further negotiation, and to negotiate a modified Peel proposal with the British.

The British government initially accepted the Peel report in principle. However, with war clouds looming over Europe, they realized that to attempt to implement it against the will of the Palestinian Arab majority would rouse up the entire Arab world against Britain. The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out). With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State. The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to &quot;political, administrative and financial difficulties&quot;.

===Resumed revolt (September 1937 – August 1939)===


With the failure of the Peel Commission&#x27;s proposals the revolt resumed during the autumn of 1937 marked by the assassination on 26 September of Acting District Commissioner of the Galilee Lewis Andrews by Quassemite gunmen in Nazareth. Andrews was widely hated by Palestinians for supporting Jewish settlement in the Galilee, and he openly advised Jews to create their own defense force. On 30 September, regulations were issued allowing the Government to detain political deportees in any part of the British Empire, and authorising the High Commissioner to outlaw associations whose objectives he regarded as contrary to public policy. Haj Amin al-Husseini was removed from the leadership of the Supreme Moslem Council and the General Waqf Committee, the local National Committees and the Arab Higher Committee were disbanded; five Arab leaders were arrested and deported to the Seychelles; and in fear of arrest Jamal el-Husseini fled to Syria and Haj Amin el-Husseini to Lebanon; all frontiers with Palestine were closed, telephone connections to neighbouring countries were withdrawn, press censorship was introduced and a special concentration camp was opened near Acre.

In November 1937, the Irgun formally rejected the policy of Havlagah and embarked on a series of indiscriminate attacks against Arab civilians as a form of what the group called &quot;active defense&quot; against Arab attacks on Jewish civilians. The British authorities set up military courts, which were established for the trial of offenses connected with the carrying and discharge of firearms, sabotage and intimidation. Despite this, however, the Arab campaign of murder and sabotage continued and Arab gangs in the hills took on the appearance of organised guerrilla fighters.
Violence continued throughout 1938. In July 1938, when the Palestine Government seemed to have largely lost control of the situation, the garrison was strengthened from Egypt, and in September it was further reinforced from England. The police were placed under the operational control of the army commander, and military officials superseded the civil authorities in the enforcement of order. In October the Old City of Jerusalem, which had become a rebel stronghold, was reoccupied by the troops. By the end of the year a semblance of order had been restored in the towns, but terrorism continued in rural areas until the outbreak of the Second World War.

====Attacks and casualties in numbers====
In the final fifteen months of the revolt alone there were 936 murders and 351 attempted murders; 2,125 incidents of sniping; 472 bombs thrown and detonated; 364 cases of armed robbery; 1,453 cases of sabotage against government and commercial property; 323 people abducted; 72 cases of intimidation; 236 Jews killed by Arabs and 435 Arabs killed by Jews; 1,200 rebels killed by the police and military and 535 wounded.

====Irgun anti-British attacks====
Despite cooperation of the Yishuv with the British to quell the revolt, some incidents towards the end of the conflict indicated a coming change in relations. On 12 June 1939, A British explosives expert was killed trying to defuse an Irgun bomb near a Jerusalem post office. On 26 August, two British police officers, Inspector Ronald Barker and Inspector Ralph Cairns, commander of the Jewish Department of the C.I.D., were killed by an Irgun mine in Jerusalem.

==Response==

===Role of the Mandate Government and the British Army===


Military law allowed swift prison sentences to be passed. Thousands of Arabs were held in administrative detention, without trial, and without proper sanitation, in overcrowded prison camps.

The British had already formalised the principle of collective punishment in Palestine in the 1924–1925 Collective Responsibility and Punishment Ordinances and updated these ordinances in 1936 with the Collective Fines Ordinance. These collective fines (amounting to £1,000,000 over the revolt) eventually became a heavy burden for poor Palestinian villagers, especially when the army also confiscated livestock, destroyed properties, imposed long curfews and established police posts, demolished houses and detained some or all of the Arab men in distant detention camps.

Full martial law was not introduced but in a series of Orders in Council and Emergency Regulations, 1936–37 &#x27;statutory&#x27; martial law, a stage between semi-military rule under civil powers and full martial law under military powers, and one in which the army and not the civil High Commissioner was pre-eminent was put in place. Following the Arab capture of the Old City of Jerusalem in October 1938, the army effectively took over Jerusalem and then all of Palestine.

The main form of collective punishment employed by the British forces was destruction of property. Sometimes entire villages were reduced to rubble, as happened to Mi&#x27;ar in October 1938; more often several prominent houses were blown up and others were trashed inside. The biggest single act of destruction occurred in Jaffa on 16 June 1936, when large gelignite charges were used to cut long pathways through the old city, destroying 220–240 buildings and rendering up to 6,000 Arabs homeless. Scathing criticism for this action from Palestine Chief Justice Sir Michael McDonnell was not well received by the administration and the judge was soon removed from the country. Villages were also frequently punished by fines and confiscation of livestock. The British even used sea mines from the battleship HMS &quot;Malaya&quot; to destroy houses.

In addition to actions against property, a large amount of brutality by the British forces occurred, including beatings, torture and extrajudicial killings. A surprisingly large number of prisoners were &quot;shot while trying to escape&quot;. Several incidents involved serious atrocities, such as massacres at al-Bassa and Halhul. Desmond Woods, an officer of the Royal Ulster Rifles, described the massacre at al-Bassa:

Now I will never forget this incident ... We were at al-Malikiyya, the other frontier base and word came through about 6 o&#x27;clock in the morning that one of our patrols had been blown up and Millie Law [the dead officer] had been killed. Now Gerald Whitfeld [Lieutenant-Colonel G.H.P. Whitfeld, the battalion commander] had told these mukhtars that if any of this sort of thing happened he would take punitive measures against the nearest village to the scene of the mine. Well the nearest village to the scene of the mine was a place called al-Bassa and our Company C were ordered to take part in punitive measures. And I will never forget arriving at al-Bassa and seeing the Rolls-Royce armoured cars of the 11th Hussars peppering Bassa with machine gun fire and this went on for about 20 minutes and then we went in and I remembered we had lighted braziers and we set the houses on fire and we burnt the village to the ground ... Monty had him [the battalion commander] up and he asked him all about it and Gerald Whitfeld explained to him. He said &quot;Sir, I have warned the mukhtars in these villages that if this happened to any of my officers or men, I would take punitive measures against them and I did this and I would&#x27;ve lost control of the frontier if I hadn&#x27;t.&quot; Monty said &quot;All right but just go a wee bit easier in the future.&quot;

As well as destroying the village the RUR and men from the Royal Engineers collected around fifty men from al-Bassa and blew some of them up with explosion under a bus. Harry Arrigonie, a policeman who was present said that about twenty men were put onto a bus; those who tried to escape were shot and then the driver of the bus was forced to drive over a powerful land mine buried by the soldiers which completely destroyed the bus, scattering the mutilated bodies of the prisoners everywhere. The other villagers were then forced to bury the bodies in a pit.

Despite these measures Lieutenant-General Haining, the General Officer Commanding, reported secretly to the Cabinet on 1 December 1938 that &quot;practically every village in the country harbours and supports the rebels and will assist in concealing their identity from the Government Forces.&quot; Haining reported the method for searching villages:

A cordon round the area to be searched is first established either by troops or aircraft and the inhabitants are warned that anybody trying to break through the cordon is likely to be shot. As literally hundreds of villages have been searched, in some cases more than once, during the past six months this procedure is well-known and it can be safely assumed that cordon-breakers have good reasons for wishing to avoid the troops. A number of such cordon-breakers have been shot during searches and it is probable that such cases form the basis of the propaganda that Arab prisoners are shot in cold blood and reported as &quot;killed while trying to escape&quot;. After the cordon is established the troops enter the village and all male inhabitants are collected for identification and interrogation.

The report was issued in response to growing concern at the severity of the military measures amongst the general public in Great Britain, among members of the British Government, and among governments in countries neighbouring Palestine.

In addition to actions against villages the British Army also conducted punitive actions in the cities. In Nablus in August 1938 almost 5,000 men were held in a cage for two days and interrogated one after another. During their detention the city was searched and then each of the detainees was marked with a rubber stamp on his release. At one point a night curfew was imposed on most of the cities.

It was common British army practice to use local Arabs as human shields by forcing them to ride with military convoys to prevent mine attacks and sniping incidents: soldiers would tie the hostages to the bonnets of lorries, or put them on small flatbeds on the front of trains. The army told the hostages that any of them who tried to run away would be shot. On the lorries, some soldiers would brake hard at the end of a journey and then casually drive over the hostage, killing or maiming him, as Arthur Lane, a Manchester Regiment private recalled:
 ... when you&#x27;d finished your duty you would come away nothing had happened no bombs or anything and the driver would switch his wheel back and to make the truck waver and the poor wog on the front would roll off into the deck. Well if he was lucky he&#x27;d get away with a broken leg but if he was unlucky the truck behind coming up behind would hit him. But nobody bothered to pick up the bits they were left. You know we were there we were the masters we were the bosses and whatever we did was right ... Well you know you don&#x27;t want him any more. He&#x27;s fulfilled his job. And that&#x27;s when Bill Usher [the commanding officer] said that it had to stop because before long they&#x27;d be running out of bloody rebels to sit on the bonnet.
British troops also left Arab wounded on the battlefield to die and maltreated Arab fighters taken in battle, so much so that the rebels tried to remove their wounded or dead from the field of battle. Sometimes, soldiers would occupy villages, expel all of the inhabitants and remain for months. The Army even burned the bodies of &quot;terrorists&quot; to prevent their funerals becoming the focus of protests.

===Tegart forts===
Sir Charles Tegart was a senior police officer brought into Palestine from the colonial force of British India on 21 October 1937.
Tegart and his deputy David Petrie (later head of MI5) advised a greater emphasis on foreign intelligence gathering and closure of Palestine&#x27;s borders. Like many of those enrolled in the Palestinian gendarmerie, Tegart had served in Great Britain&#x27;s repression of the Irish War of Independence, and the security proposals he introduced exceeded measures adopted down to this time elsewhere in the British Empire. 70 fortresses were erected throughout the country at strategic choke points and near Palestinian villages which, if assessed as &quot;bad&quot;, were subjected to collective punishment. Accordingly, from 1938 Gilbert Mackereth, the British Consul in Damascus, corresponded with Syrian and Transjordan authorities regarding border control and security to counteract arms smuggling and &quot;terrorist&quot; infiltration and produced a report for Tegart on the activities of the Palestine Defence Committee in Damascus. Tegart recommended the construction of a frontier road with a barbed wire fence, which became known as Tegart&#x27;s wall, along the borders with Lebanon and Syria to help prevent the flow of insurgents, goods and weapons. Tegart encouraged close co-operation with the Jewish Agency. It was built by the Histadrut construction company Solel Boneh. The total cost was £2 million. The Army forced the fellahin to work on the roads without pay.

Tegart introduced Arab Investigation Centres where prisoners were subjected to beatings, foot whipping, electric shocks, denailing and what is now known as &quot;waterboarding&quot;. Tegart also imported Doberman Pinschers from South Africa and set up a special centre in Jerusalem to train interrogators in torture.

===Role of the Royal Air Force===
The Royal Air Force developed close air support into its then most refined form during the Arab Revolt. Air patrols had been found effective in keeping convoys and trains free from attack, but this did not help to expose insurgents to battle conditions likely to cause their defeat. From the middle of June 1936 wireless vehicles accompanied all convoys and patrols. During rebel attacks these vehicles could issue emergency &quot;XX calls&quot; (XX with a coded location), which were given priority over all other radio traffic, to summon aerial reinforcements. Bombers, which were usually airborne within five minutes, could then either attack insurgents directly or &quot;fix&quot; their position for infantry troops. Forty-seven such XX calls were issued during the revolt, causing heavy losses to the rebels. In the June 1936 Battle of Nur Shams British planes attacked Arab irregulars with machine gun fire.

This use of air power was so successful that the British were able to reduce the regular garrison.

In 1936 an Air Staff Officer in Middle East Command based in the Kingdom of Egypt, Arthur Harris, known as an advocate of &quot;air policing&quot;, commented on the revolt saying that &quot;one 250 lb. or 500 lb. bomb in each village that speaks out of turn&quot; would satisfactorily solve the problem. In 1937 Harris was promoted to Air Commodore and in 1938 he was posted to Palestine and Trans-Jordan as Air Officer Commanding the RAF contingent in the region until September 1939. &quot;Limited&quot; bombing attacks on Arab villages were carried out by the RAF, although at times this involved razing whole villages. Harris described the system by which recalcitrant villages were kept under control by aerial bombardment as &quot;Air-Pin&quot;.

Aircraft of the RAF were also used to drop propaganda leaflets over Palestinian towns and villages telling the fellahin that they were the main sufferers of the rebellion and threatening an increase in taxes.

Low flying RAF squadrons were able to produce detailed intelligence on the location of road blocks, sabotaged bridges, railways and pipelines. RAF aerial photographs were also used to build up a detailed map of Arab population distribution.

Although the British Army was responsible for setting up the Arab counter-insurgent forces (known as the peace bands) and supplying them with arms and money these were operated by RAF Intelligence, commanded by Patrick Domville.

At the beginning of the revolt RAF assets in the region comprised a bomber flight at RAF Ramleh, an RAF armoured car flight at Ramleh, fourteen bomber squadrons at RAF Amman, and a RAF armoured car company at Ma&#x27;an.

===Role of the Royal Navy===

At the beginning of the Revolt crew from the Haifa Naval Force&#x27;s two cruisers were used to carry out tasks ashore, manning two howitzers and naval lorries equipped with QF 2 pounder naval guns and searchlights used to disperse Arab snipers. From the end of June two destroyers were used to patrol the coast of Palestine in a bid to prevent gun running. These searched as many as 150 vessels per week and were an effective preventive measure. At the request of the Army additional naval platoons landed in July to help protect Haifa and Jewish settlements in the surrounding countryside. The Navy also relieved the Army of duties in Haifa by using nine naval platoons to form the &quot;Haifa Town Force&quot; and in August three naval platoons were landed to support the police.

Following publication of the Peel Commission&#x27;s report in July 1937 HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; sailed to Haifa where landing parties were put ashore to maintain calm. Various other naval vessels continued with this role until the end of the revolt.

Following the Irgun&#x27;s detonation of a large bomb in a market in Haifa on 6 July 1938 the High Commissioner signalled the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, requesting the assistance of naval vessels capable of providing landing parties. Pound dispatched HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; and diverted HMS &quot;Emerald&quot; to Haifa, which arrived the same day and landed five platoons, one to each police district. HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; relieved HMS &quot;Emerald&quot; the following day and after another bomb was detonated on 10 July five platoons from the ship, made up of sailors and Royal Marines, dispersed mobs and patrolled the city.

On 11 July provision of three platoons from &quot;Repulse&quot; released men of the West Kent Regiment for a punitive mission against Arabs who had attacked a Jewish colony near Haifa. By 17 July the &quot;Repulse&quot; established a Company Headquarters where seamen and Royal Marines manned a 3.7-inch howitzer. Sailors, Royal Marines, and men of the Suffolk Regiment, who had embarked on the &quot;Repulse&quot;, accompanied foot patrols of the Palestine Police Force.

The &quot;Repulse&quot;, and HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; provided howitzer crews which were sent ashore to combat gun running near the border with Lebanon. Detained Arabs were used to build emplacements and the howitzers were moved quickly between these positions by day and night to confuse bandits as to the likely direction of fire. Periodically, the guns were used to fire warning rounds close to the vicinity of villages believed to have rebel sympathies.

====Strategic importance of Haifa====
Britain had completed the modern deep-sea port in Haifa in 1933 and finished laying a pipeline from the Iraqi oilfields to Haifa in 1935, shortly before the outbreak of the revolt. A refinery for processing oil from the pipeline was completed by Consolidated Refineries Ltd, a company jointly owned by British Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell, in December 1939.

These facilities enhanced the strategic importance of Palestine and of Haifa in particular in Britain&#x27;s control of the eastern Mediterranean. The threat to British control of the region posed by the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in October 1935 and the deteriorating situation in Europe toward the end of the 1930s probably made British policy makers more willing to make concessions to Arab governments on the Palestine issue following the furore over the recommendations of the Peel Commission.

===Role of the British intelligence services===

The Arab Revolt was the last major test of Britain&#x27;s security services in the Middle East before World War II. The development and deployment of intelligence-led counterinsurgency strategies was integral to the restoration of British imperial control in Palestine as the revolt had demonstrated to the British authorities how a popular rebellion could undermine intelligence gathering operations and thereby impair their ability to predict and respond to inter-communal disorder. The rebellion had brought together urban nationalism and peasant economic grievances arising from rural poverty and landlessness, which was blamed on British misrule. Accordingly, the Palestinian revolt targeted the political and economic apparatus of the British colonial state, including the communications network, pipelines, police stations, army outposts and British personnel. It was this aspect of the revolt, rather than attacks on Jews or violence between rivals for leadership of the national movement, that most concerned the high commissioner. The mandate authorities were further disturbed by the unity of purpose displayed during the six-month general strike and by the resurgence of pan-Arab nationalism as evidenced by the rise of the Istiqlal Party.

In response to these challenges the British army command (&quot;I&quot; Branch) and battalion headquarters across Palestine issued a daily intelligence bulletin every afternoon detailing political developments. Special Service Officers (SSOs) assigned to intelligence gathering reported directly to their local command headquarters and their cars were equipped with wireless transmitters so that high grade intelligence could be reported directly to &quot;I&quot; Branch immediately. These sources of intelligence gradually became more important than those of the C.I.D. in Palestine, which had been dependent on Arab informers, and which were no longer reliable.

In September 1937, the Jewish Agency appointed Reuven Zaslany liaison officer for intelligence and security affairs between the Political Department of the Jewish Agency and the intelligence arms of the Royal Air Force and the C.I.D. Zaslany sifted through intelligence collected by Jewish-controlled field operatives and forwarded it to the British military. He was a frequent visitor at the headquarters of British intelligence and the army, the police and C.I.D. and he also travelled to Damascus to liaise with the Arab opposition&#x27;s peace bands and with the British Consul in Iraq. Colonel Frederick Kisch, a British army officer and Zionist leader, was appointed chief liaison officer between the British army and the Jewish Agency Executive with Zaslany as his deputy. Zaslany also worked as interpreter for Patrick Domville, head of RAF Intelligence in Palestine (who was described by Haganah leader Dov Hos as the &quot;best Zionist informer on the English&quot;), until the latter was posted to Iraq in 1938, and through him became acquainted with many of the British intelligence officers.

In 1937 the Jewish Agency&#x27;s intelligence groups were responsible for bugging the Peel Commission hearings in Palestine. Eventually, the Arab Revolt convinced the Agency that a central intelligence service was required and this led to the formation of a counter-intelligence agency known as the &quot;Ran&quot; (headed by Yehuda Arazi, who also helped to smuggle rifles, machine guns and ammunition from Poland to Palestine) and thereafter in 1940 to the creation of SHAI, the forerunner of Mossad.

===British and Jewish co-operation===
The &quot;Haganah&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;defence&quot;), a Jewish paramilitary organisation, actively supported British efforts to suppress the uprising, which reached 10,000 Arab fighters at their peak during the summer and fall of 1938. Although the British administration did not officially recognise the &quot;Haganah&quot;, the British security forces cooperated with it by forming the Jewish Settlement Police, Jewish Supernumerary Police, and Special Night Squads. The Special Night Squads engaged in activities described by colonial administrator Sir Hugh Foot, as &#x27;extreme and cruel&#x27; involving torture, whipping, abuse and execution of Arabs.

The British authorities maintained, financed and armed the Jewish police from this point onward until the end of the Mandate, and by the end of September 1939 around 20,000 Jewish policeman, supernumeraries and settlement guards had been authorised to carry arms by the government, which also distributed weapons to outlying Jewish settlements,and allowed the Haganah to acquire arms. Independently of the British, &quot;Ta&#x27;as&quot;, the Haganah&#x27;s clandestine munitions industry, developed an 81-mm mortar and manufactured mines and grenades, 17,500 of the latter being produced for use during the revolt.

In June 1937, the British imposed the death penalty for unauthorised possession of weapons, ammunition, and explosives, but since many Jews had permission to carry weapons and store ammunition for defence this order was directed primarily against Palestinian Arabs and most of the 108 executed in Acre Prison were hanged for illegal possession of arms.

In principle all of the joint units functioned as part of the British administration, but in practice they were under the command of the Jewish Agency and &quot;intended to form the backbone of a Jewish military force set up under British sponsorship in preparation for the inevitable clash with the Arabs.&quot; The Agency and the Mandate authorities shared the costs of the new units equally. The administration also provided security services to Jewish commercial concerns at cost.

Jewish and British officials worked together to co-ordinate manhunts and collective actions against villages and also discussed the imposition of penalties and sentences. Overall, the Jewish Agency was successful in making &quot;the point that the Zionist movement and the British Empire were standing shoulder to shoulder against a common enemy, in a war in which they had common goals.&quot;

The rebellion also inspired the Jewish Agency to expand the intelligence-gathering of its Political Department and especially of its Arab Division, with the focus changing from political to military intelligence. The Arab Division set up a network of Jewish controllers and Arab agents around the country. Some of the intelligence gathered was shared with the British administration, the exchange of information sometimes being conducted by Moshe Shertok, then head of the Jewish Agency, directly with the high commissioner himself. Shertok also advised the administration on political affairs, on one occasion convincing the high commissioner not to arrest Professor Joseph Klausner, a Revisionist Maximalist activist who had played a key role in the riots of 1929, because of the likely negative consequences.

====Forces of the Jewish settlement====

† Ta&#x27;as and Rekhesh were developed and expanded during the Arab Revolt but already existed before 1936 and the Haganah had been in operation from the earliest days of the Mandate.

====Haganah intelligence services====
There was no single body within the Jewish settlement capable of co-ordinating intelligence gathering before 1939. Until then there were four separate organisations without any regular or formal liaison. These were an underground militia, forerunner of the first official information service, &quot;Sherut Yediot&quot; (Shai); the &quot;Arab Platoon&quot; of the Palmach, which was staffed by Jews who were Arab-speaking and Arab-looking; &quot;Rekhesh&quot;, the arms procurement service, which had its own intelligence gathering capabilities, and likewise the &quot;Mossad LeAliyah Bet&quot;, the illegal immigration service. In mid-1939 the effort to co-ordinate the activities of these groups was led by Shaul Avigur and Moshe Shertok.

===Role of the Revisionist Zionists===
In 1931, a Revisionist underground splinter group broke off from Haganah, calling itself the &quot;Irgun&quot; organisation (or &quot;Etzel&quot;). The organisation took its orders from Revisionist leader Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky who was at odds with the dominant Labour Zionist movement led by David Ben-Gurion. The rift between the two Zionist movements further deteriorated in 1933 when two Revisionists were blamed for the murder of Haim Arlosoroff, who had negotiated the Haavara Agreement between the Jewish Agency and Nazi Germany. The agreement brought 52,000 German Jews to Palestine between 1933 and 1939, and generated $30,000,000 for the then almost bankrupt Jewish Agency, but in addition to the difficulties with the Revisionists, who advocated a boycott of Germany, it caused the Yishuv to be isolated from the rest of world Jewry.

Ultimately, however, the events of the Arab Revolt blurred the differences between the gradualist approach of Ben-Gurion and the Maximalist Iron Wall approach of Jabotinsky and turned militarist patriotism into a bipartisan philosophy. Indeed, Ben-Gurion&#x27;s own Special Operations Squads conducted a punitive operation in the Arab village of Lubya firing weapons into a room through a window killing two men and one woman and injuring three people, including two children.

From October 1937 the Irgun instituted a wave of bombings against Arab crowds and buses. For the first time in the conflict massive bombs were placed in crowded Arab public places, killing and maiming dozens. These attacks substantially increased Arab casualties and sowed terror among the population. The first attack was on 11 November 1937, killing two Arabs at the bus depot near Jaffa Street in Jerusalem and then on 14 November, a day later commemorated as the &quot;Day of the Breaking of the &quot;Havlagah&quot; (restraint),&quot; Arabs were killed in simultaneous attacks around Palestine. More deadly attacks followed: on 6 July 1938 21 Arabs were killed and 52 wounded by a bomb in a Haifa market; on 25 July a second market bomb in Haifa killed at least 39 Arabs and injured 70; a bomb in Jaffa&#x27;s vegetable market on 26 August killed 24 Arabs and wounded 39. The attacks were condemned by the Jewish Agency.

===Role of the &quot;peace bands&quot;===

The &quot;peace bands&quot; (&quot;fasa&#x27;il al-salam&quot;) or &quot;Nashashibi units&quot; were made up of disaffected Arab peasants recruited by the British administration and the Nashashibis in late 1938 to battle against Arab rebels during the revolt. Despite their peasant origins the bands were representative mainly of the interests of landlords and rural notables. Some peace bands also sprang up in the Nablus area, on Mount Carmel (a stronghold of the Druze who largely opposed the rebellion after 1937), and around Nazareth without connection to the Nashashibi-Husayni power struggle.

From December 1937 the main opposition figures among the Arabs approached the Jewish Agency for funding and assistance, motivated by the assassination campaign pursued by the rebels at the behest of the Husseini leadership. In October 1937, shortly after Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the leader of the Arab Higher Committee, had fled from Palestine to escape British retribution, Raghib al-Nashashibi had written to Moshe Shertok stating his full willingness to co-operate with the Jewish Agency and to agree with whatever policy it proposed. From early in 1938 the Nashashibis received funding specifically to conduct anti-rebel operations, with Raghib al-Nashashibi himself receiving £5,000. The British also supplied funding to the peace bands and sometimes directed their operations.

Fakhri Nashashibi was particularly successful in recruiting peace bands in the Hebron hills, on one occasion in December 1938 gathering 3,000 villagers for a rally in Yatta, also attended by the British military commander of the Jerusalem District General Richard O&#x27;Connor. Just two months earlier, on 15 October 1938, rebels had seized the Old City and barricaded the gates. O&#x27;Connor had planned the operation by which men of the Coldstream Guards, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and Black Watch recaptured the Old City, killing 19 rebels.

Towards the end of the revolt in May 1939 the authorities dissolved the peace bands and confiscated their arms. However, because members of the bands had become tainted in the eyes of the Palestinian Arabs, and some were under sentence of death, they had little choice but to continue the battle against the national movement&#x27;s leadership, which they did with the continuing help of the Zionist movement.

===Role of rebel leaders===

At least 282 rebel leaders took part in the Arab Revolt, including four Christians. Rebel forces consisted of loosely organized bands known as &quot;fasa&#x27;il&quot; (sing: &quot;fasil&quot;). The leader of a &quot;fasil&quot; was known as a &quot;qa&#x27;id al-fasil&quot; (pl. &quot;quwwa&#x27;id al-fasa&#x27;il&quot;), which means &quot;band commander&quot;. The Jewish press often referred to them as &quot;brigands&quot;, while the British authorities and media called them &quot;bandits&quot;, &quot;terrorists&quot;, &quot;rebels&quot; or &quot;insurgents&quot;, but never &quot;nationalists&quot;. &quot;Ursabat&quot; (meaning &quot;gangs&quot;) was another Arabic term used for the rebels, and it spawned the British soldiers&#x27; nickname for all rebels, which was &quot;Oozlebart&quot;.

According to historian Simon Anglim, the rebel groups were divided into general categories: &quot;mujahadeen&quot; and &quot;fedayeen&quot;. The former were guerrillas who engaged in armed confrontations, while the latter committed acts of sabotage. According to later accounts of some surviving rebel leaders from the Galilee, the &quot;mujahideen&quot; maintained little coordination with the nominal hierarchy of the revolt. Most ambushes were the result of a local initiative undertaken by a &quot;qa&#x27;id&quot; or a group of &quot;quwwa&#x27;id&quot; from the same area.

====Galilee====
Abdul Khallik was an effective peasant leader appointed by Fawzi al-Qawuqji who caused great damage and loss of life in the Nazareth District and was thus a significant adversary of the Mandate and Jewish settlement authorities. He was trapped by British troops in a major engagement on 2 October 1938 and was killed whilst trying to lead his men to safety. Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir was the main Qassamite rebel leader in the Upper Galilee and was the only active rebel leader on the ground who was a member of the Damascus-based Central Committee of National Jihad. Abdallah al-Asbah was a prominent commander active in the Safad region of northeastern Galilee. He was killed by British forces who besieged him and his comrades near the border with Lebanon in early 1937.

====Jabal Nablus area====
Abd al-Rahim al-Hajj Muhammad from the Tulkarm area was a deeply religious, intellectual man and as a fervent anti-Zionist, he was deeply committed to the revolt. He was regarded second to Qawukji in terms of leadership ability and maintained his independence from the exiled rebel leadership in Damascus. He personally led his &quot;fasa&#x27;il&quot; and carried out nighttime attacks against British targets in the revolt&#x27;s early stage in 1936. When the revolt was renewed in April 1937, he established a more organised command hierarchy consisting of four main brigades who operated in the north-central highlands (Tulkarm-Nablus-Jenin area). He competed for the position of General Commander of the Revolt with Aref Abdul Razzik, and the two served the post in rotation from September 1938 to February 1939, when al-Hajj Muhammad was confirmed as the sole General Commander.

Al-Hajj Muhammad refused to carry out political assassinations at the behest of political factions, including al-Husayni, once stating &quot;I don&#x27;t work for Husayniya (&#x27;Husanyni-ism&#x27;), but for wataniya (&#x27;nationalism&#x27;).&quot; He is still known by Palestinians as a hero and martyr and is regarded as a metonym &quot;for a national movement that was popular, honourable, religious, and lofty in its aims and actions.&quot; He was shot dead in a firefight with British forces outside the village of Sanur on 27 March 1939, after Farid Irsheid&#x27;s peace band informed the authorities of his location.

Yusuf Abu Durra, a Qassamite leader in the Jenin area, was born in Silat al-Harithiya and before becoming a rebel worked as a Gazoz vendor. He was said to be a narrow-minded man who thrived on extortion and cruelty and thus became greatly feared. Yusuf Hamdan was Durra&#x27;s more respected lieutenant and later a leader of his own unit; he was killed by an army patrol in 1939 and buried in al-Lajjun. Durra himself was apprehended by the Arab Legion in Transjordan on 25 July 1939 and subsequently hanged.

Fakhri Abdul Hadi of Arrabah worked closely with Fawzi al-Qawukji in 1936, but later defected to the British authorities. He bargained for a pardon by offering to collaborate with the British on countering rebel propaganda. Once on the payroll of the British consul in Damascus, Gilbert Mackereth, he carried out many attacks against the rebels in 1938–1939 as leader of his own &quot;peace band&quot;.
Aref Abdul Razzik of Tayibe was responsible for the area south of Tulkarm and was known for evading capture whilst being pursued by the security forces. He signed his bulletins as &#x27;The Ghost of Sheikh Qassam&#x27;. Razzik assumed a place in British army folklore and the troops sang a song about him. Razzik was capable and daring and gained a reputation as one of the army&#x27;s problem heroes.

====Jerusalem area====
Issa Battat was a peasant leader in the southern hills below Jerusalem who caused enormous damage to security patrols in his area. He was killed by a patrol of armed police in a battle near Hebron in 1937.

====Arab volunteers====
In the first phase of the revolt, around 300 volunteers, mostly veterans of the Ottoman Army and/or rebels from the Great Syrian Revolt (1925–27), deployed in northern Palestine. Their overall commander was Fawzi al-Qawuqji and his deputies were Said al-As and Muhammad al-Ashmar. Qawuqji also led the volunteer force&#x27;s Iraqi and Transjordanian battalions, and al-Ashmar was commander of the Syrian battalion, which largely consisted of volunteers from Damascus&#x27;s al-Midan Quarter, Hama and Homs. The Druze ex-Ottoman officer, Hamad Sa&#x27;ab, commanded the Lebanese battalion.

===Funding===
In the contest of wills between the British Empire and Palestinian aspirants for statehood, the respective efforts to secure the financial means to sustain the hostilities also played out as a battle for funding. The Mandatory Authority&#x27;s repression of the revolt was bankrolled directly from London and through the revenue stream supplied to the administration by land and property taxes, stamp duties, excises on manufactured goods and customs duties on imports and exports. Draconian collective punishment fines on the peasantry –many heavily burdened already by debt and unable to pay them – were such that revenue extracted from punitive fines exceeded, and more than compensated for, the revenue lost during the revolt.

The majority of funds raised to finance the uprising came from Arab/Muslim sources. In the broader Arab/Muslim world a measure of financial aid, never vast, filtered in from Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Muslim India for some time. In Palestine, the peasantry, often debt-ridden, could offer little towards subsidising the resistance. A variety of measures were adopted. Women donated jewelry and ran fund-raising committees, a jihad tax was placed on citrus groves, the industry being the backbone of Palestine&#x27;s export trade; Palestinians on the government payroll contributed sums anywhere up to half of their salaries; levies were imposed on wealthier Arabs (many of whom went abroad to avoid paying them, or because they could not meet demands to provide financial aid to strikers). The AHC&#x27;s functions in this capacity were truncated when it was abolished by the British authorities in October 1937. Displaced in Damascus, its leaders were cut off from contact with field units and donations gradually dried up. al-Husayni, by then in exile, proved unable to raise money, and in Syria militant contacts were informed by July 1938 that they would have to make do on their own. By 1938 the drop in revenues caused militant gangs to resort to extortion and robbery, often draining villages of ready cash reserves set aside to pay government fines, which then had to be met by the sale of crops and livestock. Some contributions were obtained from American sources.

A great deal of speculation later arose around the purported role of Germany and Italy in backing the revolt financially, based on early claims by Jewish operatives that both countries were fomenting the uprising by funneling cash and weapons to the insurgents. German plans to ship arms to the rebels were never implemented due to distrust of the Saudi middlemen. Italian attempts to furnish arms by the same venue were thwarted by British intelligence. The British never found arms or munitions of German or Italian provenance. RAF intelligence dismissed these claims as either referring to &#x27;comparatively small&#x27; sums or as purveyed to bring discredit on the Palestinians. al-Husayni and his associates received limited funding from Fascist Italy during the revolt as the Italians were in dispute with the United Kingdom over Abyssinia and wished not only to disrupt the British rear but also to extend Italian influence in the region. The rebels utilized the Italian funding to smuggle weapons into Palestine via Syria. Total Italian funding amounted to approximately £150.000. It stopped in late 1938 and played no decisive role since the uprising peaked after that date.

In the first years after 1933 Germany was approached by a variety of Arab nationalist groups from Palestine and abroad asking for aid, but Germany categorically refused. Maintaining good relations with the British was still considered to be of the uppermost priority, hence it limited itself to expressing its sympathy and moral support. Soon after the outbreak of the revolt, in December 1936, Germany was approached by the rebel commander Fawzi al-Qawuqji and in January 1937 by representatives of the Arab Higher Committee, both requesting arms and money, but again in vain. In July al-Husayni himself approached Heinrich Doehle, new general counsel of Jerusalem, to request support for the &quot;battle against the Jews&quot;. Doehle found that Germany&#x27;s hesitation in supporting the rebels had caused pro-German sentiment among Palestinian Arabs to waver. Some limited German funding for the revolt can be dated to around the summer of 1938 and was perhaps related to a goal of distracting the British from the on-going occupation of Czechoslovakia. The Abwehr gave money to al-Husayni and other sums were funneled via Saudi Arabia.

Despite the intervention of up to 50,000 British troops and 15,000 Haganah men, the uprising continued for over three years. By the time it concluded in September 1939, more than 5,000 Arabs, over 300 Jews, and 262 Britons had been killed and at least 15,000 Arabs were wounded.

===Impact on the Jewish Yishuv===


In the overall context of the Jewish settlement&#x27;s development in the 1930s the physical losses endured during the revolt were relatively insignificant. Although hundreds were killed and property was damaged no Jewish settlement was captured or destroyed and several dozen new ones were established. Over 50,000 new Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine. In 1936 Jews made up about one-third of the population.

The hostilities contributed to further disengagement of the Jewish and Arab economies in Palestine, which were intertwined to some extent until that time. Development of the economy and infrastructure accelerated. For example, whereas the Jewish city of Tel Aviv relied on the nearby Arab seaport of Jaffa, hostilities dictated the construction of a separate Jewish-run seaport for Tel Aviv, inspiring the delighted Ben-Gurion to note in his diary &quot;we ought to reward the Arabs for giving us the impetus for this great creation.&quot; Metal works were established to produce armoured sheeting for vehicles and a rudimentary arms industry was founded. The settlement&#x27;s transportation capabilities were enhanced and Jewish unemployment was relieved owing to the employment of police officers, and replacement of striking Arab labourers, employees, craftsman and farmers by Jewish workers. Most of the important industries in Palestine were owned by Jews and in trade and the banking sector they were much better placed than the Arabs.

As a result of collaboration with the British colonial authorities and security forces many thousands of young men had their first experience of military training, which Moshe Shertok and Haganah leader Eliyahu Golomb cited as one of the fruits of the Haganah&#x27;s policy of havlagah (restraint).

Although the Jewish settlement in Palestine was dismayed by the publication of the 1939 White Paper restricting Jewish immigration, David Ben-Gurion remained undeterred, believing that the policy would not be implemented, and in fact Neville Chamberlain had told him that the policy would last at the very most only for the duration of the war. In the event the White Paper quotas were exhausted only in December 1944, over five and a half years later, and in the same period the United Kingdom absorbed 50,000 Jewish refugees and the British Commonwealth (Australia, Canada and South Africa) took many thousands more. During the War over 30,000 Jews joined the British forces and even the Irgun ceased operations against the British until 1944.

===Impact on the Palestinian Arabs===
The revolt weakened the military strength of Palestinian Arabs in advance of their ultimate confrontation with the Jewish settlement in the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and was, according to Benny Morris, thus counterproductive. During the uprising, British authorities attempted to confiscate all weapons from the Arab population. This, and the destruction of the main Arab political leadership in the revolt, greatly hindered their military efforts in the 1948 Palestine war, where imbalances between the Jewish and Arab economic performance, social cohesion, political organisation and military capability became apparent.

The Mufti, Hajj Amin al-Husseini and his supporters directed a Jihad against any person who did not obey the Mufti. Their national struggle was a religious holy war, and the incarnation of both the Palestinian Arab nation and Islam was Hajj Amin al-Husseini. Anyone who rejected his leadership was a heretic and his life was forfeit. After the Peel report publication, the murders of Arabs leaders who opposed the Mufti were accelerated. Pressed by the assassination campaign pursued by the rebels at the behest of the Husseini leadership, the opposition had a security cooperation with the Jews. The flight of wealthy Arabs, which occurred during the revolt, was also replicated in 1947–49.
Thousands of Palestinian houses were destroyed, and massive financial costs were incurred because of the general strike and the devastation of fields, crops and orchards. The economic boycott further damaged the fragile Palestinian Arab economy through loss of sales and goods and increased unemployment.
The revolt did not achieve its goals, although it is &quot;credited with signifying the birth of the Arab Palestinian identity.&quot; It is generally credited with forcing the issuance of the White Paper of 1939 in which Britain retreated from the partition arrangements proposed by the Peel Commission in favour of the creation of a binational state within ten years, although The League of Nations commission held that the White Paper was in conflict with the terms of the Mandate as put forth in the past. The White Paper of 1939 was regarded by many as incompatible with the commitment to a Jewish National Home in Palestine, as proclaimed in the 1917 Balfour Declaration. Al-Husseini rejected the new policy, although it seems that the ordinary Palestinian Arab accepted the White Paper of 1939. His biographer, Philip Mattar wrote that in that case, the Mufti preferred his personal interests and the ideology rather than the practical considerations.

===Impact on the British Empire===
As the inevitable war with Germany approached, British policy makers concluded that although they could rely on the support of the Jewish population in Palestine, who had no alternative but to support Britain, the support of Arab governments and populations in an area of great strategic importance for the British Empire was not assured. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain concluded &quot;if we must offend one side, let us offend the Jews rather than the Arabs.&quot;

In February 1939 Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Malcolm MacDonald called together a conference of Arab and Zionist leaders on the future of Palestine at St. James&#x27;s Palace in London but the discussions ended without agreement on 27 March.The government&#x27;s new policy as published in White Paper of 17 May had been determined already and despite Jewish protests and Irgun attacks the British remained resolute.

There was a growing feeling among British officials that there was nothing left for them to do in Palestine.
Perhaps the ultimate achievement of the Arab Revolt was to make the British sick of Palestine. Major-General Bernard &quot;Monty&quot; Montgomery concluded, &quot;the Jew murders the Arab and the Arab murders the Jew. This is what is going on in Palestine now. And it will go on for the next 50 years in all probability.&quot;

==Historiography==

The 1936–39 Arab Revolt has been and still is marginalized in both Western and Israeli historiography on Palestine, and even progressive Western scholars have little to say about the anti-colonial struggle of the Palestinian Arab rebels against the British Empire. According to Swedenburg&#x27;s analysis, for instance, the Zionist version of Israeli history acknowledges only one authentic national movement: the struggle for Jewish self-determination that resulted in the Israeli Declaration of Independence in May 1948. Swedenburg writes that the Zionist narrative has no room for an anticolonial and anti-British Palestinian national revolt. Zionists often describe the revolt as a series of &quot;events&quot; (Hebrew מאורעות תרצ&quot;ו-תרצ&quot;ט) &quot;riots&quot;, or &quot;happenings&quot;. The appropriate description was debated by Jewish Agency officials, who were keen not to give a negative impression of Palestine to prospective immigrants In private, however, David Ben-Gurion was unequivocal: the Arabs, he said, were &quot;fighting dispossession ... The fear is not of losing land, but of losing the homeland of the Arab people, which others want to turn into the homeland of the Jewish people.&quot;

British historian Alan Allport, in his 2020 survey of the British Empire on the eve of the Second World War concludes that murderous incidents like al-Bassa:
were outrageous precisely because they were unusual. On the whole, the British Army and the various colonial &quot;gendarmeries&quot; that worked alongside it in the 1920s and 1930s behaved fairly well—certainly with a good deal more self-restraint than security forces of other imperial states. There is nothing in the British record in Palestine to compare with the devastating violence of the Rif War in Spanish Morocco for instance or the Italian pacification of Libya, both of which involve killing on a vastly greater scale. Many British soldiers behaved impeccably in Palestine during the Arab revolt.
He concludes that it was the &quot;Palestine surge&quot;—that is, London&#x27;s use of sheer weight of numbers to overwhelm and crush the Arab rebels—was a success.

Matthew Hughes, a leading authority on the Revolt, notes that it is a standard move in British historiography to contrast the relative mildness of British counter-insurgency achievements with those of other Western colonial powers. A contrast is frequently drawn between the German suppression of the Herero, Belgium&#x27;s genocide in the Congo and France&#x27;s violence in Algeria to the winning-the-hearts-and-minds approach Britain is said to have adopted in Kenya in containing the Mau Mau revolt. One British military commander asserted that &#x27;If the Germans were in occupation in Haifa we&#x27;d not have any bloody troubles from the Arabs.&#x27; Nonetheless, while moderating forces did mitigate the violence, atrocities were committed, torture used, brutality commonplace. Collective punishment, the razing of villages, the smashing of personal property in homes, and the destruction of foodstocks was widespread. Britain&#x27;s pacification succeeded and &#x27;left Palestine in ruins.&#x27;

<text>Mechatronics engineering, also called mechatronics, is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that focuses on the integration of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, electronic engineering and software engineering, and also includes a combination of robotics, computer science, telecommunications, systems, control, automation and product engineering.

As technology advances over time, various subfields of engineering have succeeded in both adapting and multiplying. The intention of mechatronics is to produce a design solution that unifies each of these various subfields. Originally, the field of mechatronics was intended to be nothing more than a combination of mechanics, electrical and electronics, hence the name being a portmanteau of the words &quot;mechanics&quot; and &quot;electronics&quot;; however, as the complexity of technical systems continued to evolve, the definition had been broadened to include more technical areas.

No later than in 1951, the word &quot;mechatronics&quot; was used in an advertisement of the company Servomechanisms, Inc. as can be seen in the journal Nucleonics, vol. 9, issue 3 on page 99.

The word &quot;mechatronics&quot; originated in Japanese-English and was created by Tetsuro Mori, an engineer of Yaskawa Electric Corporation. The word &quot;mechatronics&quot; was registered as trademark by the company in Japan with the registration number of &quot;46-32714&quot; in 1971. The company later released the right to use the word to the public, and the word began being used globally. Currently the word is translated into many languages and is considered an essential term for advanced automated industry.

Many people treat &quot;mechatronics&quot; as a modern buzzword synonymous with automation, robotics and electromechanical engineering.

French standard NF E 01-010 gives the following definition: &quot;approach aiming at the synergistic integration of mechanics, electronics, control theory, and computer science within product design and manufacturing, in order to improve and/or optimize its functionality&quot;.

== History ==
The word &quot;mechatronics&quot; was registered as trademark by the company in Japan with the registration number of &quot;46-32714&quot; in 1971. The company later released the right to use the word to the public, and the word began being used globally.

With the advent of information technology in the 1980s, microprocessors were introduced into mechanical systems, improving performance significantly. By the 1990s, advances in computational intelligence were applied to mechatronics in ways that revolutionized the field.

==Description==

A mechatronics engineer unites the principles of mechanics, electrical, electronics, and computing to generate a simpler, more economical and reliable system.

Engineering cybernetics deals with the question of control engineering of mechatronic systems. It is used to control or regulate such a system (see control theory). Through collaboration, the mechatronic modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing properties in the production scheme. Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most known architectures involve hierarchy, polyarchy, heterarchy, and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control algorithms, which might or might not utilize formal methods in their design. Hybrid systems important to mechatronics include production systems, synergy drives,
exploration rovers, automotive subsystems such as anti-lock braking systems and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, hard disks, CD players and phones.

== Subdisciplines ==

=== Mechanical ===

Mechanical engineering is an important part of mechatronics engineering. It includes the study of mechanical nature of how an object works. Mechanical elements refer to mechanical structure, mechanism, thermo-fluid, and hydraulic aspects of a mechatronics system. The study of thermodynamics, dynamics, fluid mechanics, pneumatics and hydraulics. Mechatronics engineer who works a mechanical engineer can specialize in hydraulics and pneumatics systems, where they can be found working in automobile industries. A mechatronics engineer can also design a vehicle since they have strong mechanical and electronical background. Knowledge of software applications such as computer-aided design and computer aided manufacturing is essential for designing products. Mechatronics covers a part of mechanical syllabus which is widely applied in automobile industry.

Mechatronic systems represent a large part of the functions of an automobile. The control loop formed by sensor—information processing—actuator—mechanical (physical) change is found in many systems. The system size can be very different. The anti-lock braking system (ABS) is a mechatronic system. The brake itself is also one. And the control loop formed by driving control (for example cruise control), engine, vehicle driving speed in the real world and speed measurement is a mechatronic system, too. The great importance of mechatronics for automotive engineering is also evident from the fact that vehicle manufacturers often have development departments with &quot;Mechatronics&quot; in their names.

=== Electronics and electricals ===

Electronics and telecommunication engineering specializes in electronics devices and telecom devices of a mechatronics system. A mechatronics engineer specialized in electronics and telecommunications have knowledge of computer hardware devices. The transmission of signal is the main application of this subfield of mechatronics. Where digital and analog systems also forms an important part of mechatronics systems. Telecommunications engineering deals with the transmission of information across a medium.

Electronics engineering is related to computer engineering and electrical engineering. Control engineering has a wide range of electronic applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airplanes to the cruise control present in many modern cars. VLSI designing is important for creating integrated circuits. Mechatronics engineers have deep knowledge of microprocessors, microcontrollers, microchips and semiconductors. The application of mechatronics in electronics manufacturing industry can conduct research and development on consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, computers, cameras etc. For mechatronics engineers it is necessary to learn operating computer applications such as MATLAB and Simulink for designing and developing electronic products.

Mechatronics engineering is a interdisciplinary course, it includes concepts of both electrical and mechanical systems. A mechatronics engineer engages in designing high power transformers or radio-frequency module transmitters.

=== Avionics ===
Avionics is also considered a variant of mechatronics as it combines several fields such as electronics and telecom with aerospace engineering. It is the subdiscipline of mechatronics engineering and aerospace engineering which is engineering branch focusing on electronics systems of aircraft. The word avionics is a blend of aviation and electronics. The electronics system of aircraft includes aircraft communication addressing and reporting system, air navigation, aircraft flight control system, aircraft collision avoidance systems, flight recorder, weather radar and lightning detector. These can be as simple as a searchlight for a police helicopter or as complicated as the tactical system for an airborne early warning platform.

=== Advanced mechatronics ===
Another variant is motion control for advanced mechatronics, presently recognized as a key technology in mechatronics. The robustness of motion control will be represented as a function of stiffness and a basis for practical realization. Target of motion is parameterized by control stiffness which could be variable according to the task reference. The system robustness of motion always requires very high stiffness in the controller.

=== Industrial ===

The branch of industrial engineer includes the design of machinery, assembly and process lines of various manufacturing industries. This branch can be said somewhat similar to automation and robotics. Mechatronics engineers who works as industrial engineers design and develop infrastructure of a manufacturing plant. Also it can be said that they are architect of machines. One can work as an industrial designer to design the industrial layout and plan for setting up of a manufacturing industry or as an industrial technician to lookover the technical requirements and repairing of the particular factory.

=== Robotics ===
Robotics is one of the newest emerging subfield of mechatronics. It is the study of robots and how they are manufactured and operated. Since 2000, this branch of mechatronics is attracting a number of aspirants. Robotics is interrelated with automation because here also not much human intervention is required. In a large number of factories, especially in automobile factories, robots are found in assembly lines, where they perform the job of drilling, installation and fitting. Programming skills are necessary for specialization in robotics. Knowledge of programming language—ROBOTC—is important for functioning robots. An industrial robot is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics and computing to do its day-to-day jobs.

=== Computer ===
The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data. IoT and mechatronics are complementary. Many of the smart components associated with the Internet of Things will be essentially mechatronic. The development of the IoT is forcing mechatronics engineers, designers, practitioners and educators to research the ways in which mechatronic systems and components are perceived, designed and manufactured. This allows them to face up to new issues such as data security, machine ethics and the human-machine interface.

Knowledge of programming is very important. A mechatronics engineer has to do programming in different levels – for example, PLC programming, drone programming, hardware programming, CNC programming, etc. Due to combination of electronics engineering, soft skills from computer side is important. Important programming languages for mechatronics engineer to learn are Java, Python, Rust, C++ and C programming language.

<doc id="304608" wikidata="Q3110129" url="?curid=304608" title="Polytrope">
<text>In astrophysics, a polytrope refers to a solution of the Lane–Emden equation in which the pressure depends upon the density in the form
formula_1
where is pressure, is density and is a constant of proportionality. The constant is known as the polytropic index; note however that the polytropic index has an alternative definition as with &quot;n&quot; as the exponent.

This relation need not be interpreted as an equation of state, which states &quot;P&quot; as a function of both ρ and &quot;T&quot; (the temperature); however in the particular case described by the polytrope equation there are other additional relations between these three quantities, which together determine the equation. Thus, this is simply a relation that expresses an assumption about the change of pressure with radius in terms of the change of density with radius, yielding a solution to the Lane–Emden equation.

Sometimes the word &quot;polytrope&quot; may refer to an equation of state that looks similar to the thermodynamic relation above, although this is potentially confusing and is to be avoided. It is preferable to refer to the fluid itself (as opposed to the solution of the Lane–Emden equation) as a polytropic fluid or polytropic gas. Specifically, the polytropic gas is a gas for which the specific heat is constant. The equation of state of a polytropic fluid is general enough that such idealized fluids find wide use outside of the limited problem of polytropes.

The polytropic exponent (of a polytrope) has been shown to be equivalent to the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus where its relation to the Murnaghan equation of state has also been demonstrated. The polytrope relation is therefore best suited for relatively low-pressure (below 107 Pa) and high-pressure (over 1014 Pa) conditions when the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus, which is equivalent to the polytrope index, is near constant.

==Example models by polytropic index==
*An index polytrope is often used to model rocky planets. The reason is that polytrope has constant density, i.e., incompressible interior. This is a zero order approximation for rocky (solid/liquid) planets.
*Neutron stars are well modeled by polytropes with index between and .
*A polytrope with index is a good model for fully convective star cores (like those of red giants), brown dwarfs, giant gaseous planets (like Jupiter). With this index, the polytropic exponent is 5/3, which is the heat capacity ratio (γ) for monatomic gas. For the interior of gaseous stars (consisting of either ionized hydrogen or helium), this follows from an ideal gas approximation for natural convection conditions.
*A polytrope with index is also a good model for white dwarfs of low mass, according to the equation of state of non-relativistic degenerate matter.
*A polytrope with index is a good model for the cores of white dwarfs of higher masses, according to the equation of state of relativistic degenerate matter.
*A polytrope with index is usually also used to model main-sequence stars like the Sun, at least in the radiation zone, corresponding to the Eddington standard model of stellar structure. 
*A polytrope with index has an infinite radius. It corresponds to the simplest plausible model of a self-consistent stellar system, first studied by Arthur Schuster in 1883, and it has an exact solution.
*A polytrope with index corresponds to what is called an &quot;isothermal sphere&quot;, that is an isothermal self-gravitating sphere of gas, whose structure is identical to the structure of a collisionless system of stars like a globular cluster. This is because for an ideal gas, the temperature is proportional to ρ1/n, so infinite &quot;n&quot; corresponds to a constant temperature.

In general as the polytropic index increases, the density distribution is more heavily weighted toward the center () of the body.

<text>The K6-2 is an x86 microprocessor introduced by AMD on May 28, 1998, and available in speeds ranging from 266 to 550 MHz. An enhancement of the original K6, the K6-2 introduced AMD&#x27;s 3DNow! SIMD instruction set and an upgraded system-bus interface called Super Socket 7, which was backward compatible with older Socket 7 motherboards. It was manufactured using a 250 nanometer process, ran at 2.2 volts, and had 9.3 million transistors.

==History==
The K6-2 was designed as a competitor to Intel&#x27;s flagship processor, the significantly more expensive Pentium II. Performance of the two chips was similar: the previous K6 tended to be faster for general-purpose computing, while the Intel part was faster in x87 floating-point applications. To battle the Pentium II&#x27;s dominance on floating point calculations the K6-2 was the first CPU to introduce a floating point SIMD instruction set (dubbed 3DNow! by AMD), which significantly boosted performance. However programs needed to be specifically tailored for the new instructions and despite beating Intel&#x27;s SSE instruction set to market, 3DNow achieved only limited popularity.

Super Socket 7, which increased the processor bus from 66 MHz to 100 MHz, allowed the K6-2 to withstand the effects of ever-increasing CPU multipliers fairly gracefully and in later life it remained surprisingly competitive. Nearly all K6-2s were designed to use 100 MHz Super Socket 7 mainboards, allowing the system-bus to keep pace with the K6-2&#x27;s clock-frequency.

The K6-2 was a very financially successful chip and enabled AMD to earn the revenue it would need to introduce the forthcoming Athlon. The introductory K6-2 300 was by far the best-selling variant. It rapidly established an excellent reputation in the marketplace and offered a favorable price/performance ratio versus Intel&#x27;s Celeron 300A. While the K6-2 had mediocre floating-point performance compared to the Celeron, it offered faster system RAM access (courtesy of the Super 7 mainboard), as well as 3DNow graphics extensions.

As the market moved on, AMD released a long series of faster K6-2 parts, the best-selling ones being the 350, 400, 450, and 500. By the time the 450 and the 500 were mainstream parts, the K6-2 family had already moved to the budget PC segment, where it still competed successfully against Intel&#x27;s Celeron.

==K6-2+==
Despite the name, the little-known K6-2+ was based on the AMD K6-III+ design (model 13) with 128 KiB of integrated L2 cache and built on a 0.18 micrometre process (essentially a K6-III+ with half the L2 cache). The K6-2+ was specifically designed as a low-power mobile CPU. Some motherboard companies such as Gigabyte and FIC provided BIOS updates for their desktop motherboards to allow for usage of these processors; for other officially not supported mainboards, the community created unofficial BIOS updates on their own.

Most K6-2+ motherboards did not support a clock multiplier setting greater than 5.5 since 550 MHz was the highest official speed of the K6-2+ (100*5.5 = 550) but a little known feature of both the K6-2 and K6-2+ was that it interpreted the motherboard clock multiplier setting 2 as 6. This allowed many users to run their K6-2+ 550 MHz and often even a K6-2+ 500 MHz at a speed of 600 MHz simply by setting the motherboard clock multiplier to 2.

<text>A safety valve is a valve that acts as a fail-safe. An example of safety valve is a pressure relief valve (PRV), which automatically releases a substance from a boiler, pressure vessel, or other system, when the pressure or temperature exceeds preset limits. Pilot-operated relief valves are a specialized type of pressure safety valve. A leak tight, lower cost, single emergency use option would be a rupture disk.

Safety valves were first developed for use on steam boilers during the Industrial Revolution. Early boilers operating without them were prone to explosion unless carefully operated.

Vacuum safety valves (or combined pressure/vacuum safety valves) are used to prevent a tank from collapsing while it is being emptied, or when cold rinse water is used after hot CIP (clean-in-place) or SIP (sterilization-in-place) procedures. When sizing a vacuum safety valve, the calculation method is not defined in any norm, particularly in the hot CIP / cold water scenario, but some manufacturers have developed sizing simulations.

The term &quot;safety valve&quot; is also used metaphorically.

==Function and design==

The earliest and simplest safety valve was used on a 1679 steam digester and utilized a weight to retain the steam pressure (this design is still commonly used on pressure cookers); however, these were easily tampered with or accidentally released. On the Stockton and Darlington Railway, the safety valve tended to go off when the engine hit a bump in the track. A valve less sensitive to sudden accelerations used a spring to contain the steam pressure, but these (based on a Salter spring balance) could still be screwed down to increase the pressure beyond design limits. This dangerous practice was sometimes used to marginally increase the performance of a steam engine. 

In 1856, John Ramsbottom invented a tamper-proof spring safety valve that became universal on railways. The Ramsbottom valve consisted of two plug-type valves connected to each other by a spring-laden pivoting arm, with one valve element on either side of the pivot. Any adjustment made to one of valves in an attempt to increase its operating pressure would cause the other valve to be lifted off its seat, regardless of how the adjustment was attempted. The pivot point on the arm was not symmetrically located between the valves, so any tightening of the spring would cause one of the valves to lift. 

Only by removing and disassembling the entire valve assembly could its operating pressure be adjusted, making impromptu &quot;tying down&quot; of the valve by locomotive crews in search of more power impossible. The pivoting arm was commonly extended into a handle shape and fed back into the locomotive cab, allowing crews to &#x27;rock&#x27; both valves off their seats to confirm that they were set and operating correctly.

Safety valves also evolved to protect equipment such as pressure vessels (fired or not) and heat exchangers. The term safety valve should be limited to compressible fluid applications (gas, vapour, or steam).

The two general types of protection encountered in industry are &quot;thermal protection&quot; and &quot;flow protection&quot;.

For liquid-packed vessels, thermal relief valves are generally characterized by the relatively small size of the valve necessary to provide protection from excess pressure caused by thermal expansion. In this case a small valve is adequate because most liquids are nearly incompressible, and so a relatively small amount of fluid discharged through the relief valve will produce a substantial reduction in pressure.

Flow protection is characterized by safety valves that are considerably larger than those mounted for thermal protection. They are generally sized for use in situations where significant quantities of gas or high volumes of liquid must be quickly discharged in order to protect the integrity of the vessel or pipeline. This protection can alternatively be achieved by installing a high integrity pressure protection system (HIPPS).

==Technical terms==
In the petroleum refining, petrochemical, chemical manufacturing, natural gas processing, power generation, food, drinks, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries, the term safety valve is associated with the terms pressure relief valve (PRV), pressure safety valve (PSV) and relief valve.
The generic term is Pressure relief valve (PRV) or pressure safety valve (PSV). PRVs and PSVs are not the same thing, despite what many people think; the difference is that PSVs have a manual lever to open the valve in case of emergency.
* Relief valve (RV): an automatic system that is actuated by the static pressure in a liquid-filled vessel. It specifically opens proportionally with increasing pressure.
* Safety valve (SV): an automatic system that relieves the static pressure on a gas. It usually opens completely, accompanied by a popping sound.
* Safety relief valve (SRV): an automatic system that relieves by static pressure on both gas and liquid.
* Pilot-operated safety relief valve (POSRV): an automatic system that relieves on remote command from a pilot, to which the static pressure (from equipment to protect) is connected.
* Low pressure safety valve (LPSV): an automatic system that relieves static pressure on a gas. Used when the difference between the vessel pressure and the ambient atmospheric pressure is small.
* Vacuum pressure safety valve (VPSV): an automatic system that relieves static pressure on a gas. Used when the pressure difference between the vessel pressure and the ambient pressure is small, negative and near to atmospheric pressure.
* Low and vacuum pressure safety valve (LVPSV): an automatic system that relieves static pressure on a gas. Used when the pressure difference is small, negative or positive and near to atmospheric pressure.

RV, SV and SRV are spring-operated (even spring-loaded). LPSV and VPSV are spring-operated or weight-loaded.

==Legal and code requirements in industry==
In most countries, industries are legally required to protect pressure vessels and other equipment by using relief valves. Also, in most countries, equipment design codes such as those provided by the ASME, API and other organizations like ISO (ISO 4126) must be complied with. These codes include design standards for relief valves and schedules for periodic inspection and testing after valves have been removed by the company engineer.

Today, the food, drinks, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals industries call for hygienic safety valves, fully drainable and Cleanable-In-Place. Most are made of stainless steel; the hygienic norms are mainly 3A in the USA and EHEDG in Europe.

== Development of the safety valve ==

=== Deadweight lever valves ===
The first safety valve was invented by Denis Papin for his steam digester, an early pressure cooker rather than an engine. A weight acting through a lever held down a circular plug valve in the steam vessel. By using a &quot;steelyard&quot; lever a smaller weight was required, also the pressure could easily be regulated by sliding the same weight back and forth along the lever arm. Papin retained the same design for his 1707 steam pump. 

Early safety valves were regarded as one of the engineman&#x27;s controls and required continuous attention, according to the load on the engine. In a famous early explosion at Greenwich in 1803, one of Trevithick&#x27;s high-pressure stationary engines exploded when the boy trained to operate the engine left it to catch eels in the river, without first releasing the safety valve from its working load. By 1806, Trevithick was fitting pairs of safety valves, one external valve for the driver&#x27;s adjustment and one sealed inside the boiler with a fixed weight. This was unadjustable and released at a higher pressure, intended as a guarantee of safety.

When used on locomotives, these valves would rattle and leak, releasing near-continuous puffs of waste steam.
==== Direct-acting deadweight valves ====

Although the lever safety valve was convenient, it was too sensitive to the motion of a steam locomotive. Early steam locomotives therefore used a simpler arrangement of weights stacked directly upon the valve. This required a smaller valve area, so as to keep the weight manageable, which sometimes proved inadequate to vent the pressure of an unattended boiler, leading to explosions. An even greater hazard was the ease with which such a valve could be tied down, so as to increase the pressure and thus power of the engine, at further risk of explosion.

Although deadweight safety valves had a short lifetime on steam locomotives, they remained in use on stationary boilers for as long as steam power remained.
=== Direct spring valves ===

Weighted valves were sensitive to bouncing from the rough riding of early locomotives. One solution was to use a lightweight spring rather than a weight. This was the invention of Timothy Hackworth on his &quot;Royal George&quot; of 1828. Owing to the limited metallurgy of the period, Hackworth&#x27;s first spring valves used an accordion-like stack of multiple leaf springs.

These direct-acting spring valves could be adjusted by tightening the nuts retaining the spring. To avoid tampering, they were often shrouded in tall brass casings which also vented the steam away from the locomotive crew.
=== Salter spring balance valves ===
The Salter coil spring spring balance for weighing, was first made in Britain by around 1770. This used the newly developed spring steels to make a powerful but compact spring in one piece. Once again by using the lever mechanism, such a spring balance could be applied to the considerable force of a boiler safety valve.

The spring balance valve also acted as a pressure gauge. This was useful as previous pressure gauges were unwieldy mercury manometers and the Bourdon gauge had yet to be invented.

==== Lockable valves ====
The risk of firemen tying down the safety valve remained. This was encouraged by them being fitted with easily adjustable wing nuts, the practice of adjusting the boiler&#x27;s working pressure via the safety valve being an accepted behaviour well into the 1850s. It was later common with Salter valves for them to be fitted in pairs, one adjustable and often calibrated for use as a gauge, the other sealed inside a locked cover to prevent tampering.

==== Paired spring balance valves ====
Paired valves were often adjusted to slightly different pressures too, a small valve as a control measure and the lockable valve made larger and permanently set to a higher pressure, as a safeguard. Some designs, such as one by Sinclair for the Eastern Counties Railway in 1859, had the valve spring with pressure scale behind the dome, facing the cab, and the locked valve ahead of the dome, out of reach of interference.
=== Ramsbottom safety valves ===
In 1855, John Ramsbottom, later locomotive superintendent of the LNWR, described a new form of safety valve intended to improve reliability and especially to be tamper-resistant. A pair of plug valves were used, held down by a common spring-loaded lever between them with a single central spring. This lever was characteristically extended rearwards, often reaching into the cab on early locomotives. 

Rather than discouraging the use of the spring lever by the fireman, Ramsbottom&#x27;s valve encouraged this. Rocking the lever freed up the valves alternately and checked that neither was sticking in its seat. Even if the fireman held the lever down and increased the force on the rear valve, there was a corresponding reduction of force on the forward valve.

Various forms of Ramsbottom valve were produced. Some were separate fittings to the boiler, through separate penetrations. Others were contained in a U-shaped housing fastened to a single opening in the boiler shell. As boiler diameter increased, some forms were even set inside the boiler shell, with the springs housed in a recess inside and only the valves and balance lever protruding outside. These had obvious drawbacks for easy maintenance.

A drawback to the Ramsbottom type was its complexity. Poor maintenance or mis-assembly of the linkage between the spring and the valves could lead to a valve that no longer opened correctly under pressure. The valves could be held against their seats and fail to open or, even worse, to allow the valve to open but insufficiently to vent steam at an adequate rate and so not being an obvious and noticeable fault. Mis-assembly of just this nature led to a fatal boiler explosion in 1909 at Cardiff on the Rhymney Railway, even though the boiler was almost new, at only eight months old.

== Naylor valve ==
s were introduced around 1866. A bellcrank arrangement reduced the strain (percentage extension) of the spring, thus maintaining a more constant force. They were used by the L&amp;Y and NER.
=== &quot;Pop&quot; valves ===

All of the preceding safety valve designs opened gradually and had a tendency to leak a &quot;feather&quot; of steam as they approached &quot;blowing-off&quot;, even though this was below the pressure. When they opened they also did so partially at first and did not vent steam quickly until the boiler was well over pressure.
The quick-opening &quot;pop&quot; valve was a solution to this. Their construction was simple: the existing circular plug valve was changed to an inverted &quot;top hat&quot; shape, with an enlarged upper diameter. They fitted into a stepped seat of two matching diameters. When closed, the steam pressure acted only on the crown of the top hat, and was balanced by the spring force. Once the valve opened a little, steam could pass the lower seat and began to act on the larger brim. This greater area overwhelmed the spring force and the valve flew completely open with a &quot;pop&quot;. Escaping steam on this larger diameter also held the valve open until pressure had dropped &quot;below&quot; that at which it originally opened, providing hysteresis.

These valves coincided with a change in firing behaviour. Instead of letting steam reach a feather at the valve, firemen (stokers) now tried to &quot;avoid&quot; noisy blowing off, especially at platforms or under the large roof of a major station. This was mostly at the behest of stationmasters, but also because firemen realised that any blowing off through a pop valve wasted boiler pressure. In one case, this was estimated at lost corresponding to the burning of or more of shovelled coal.

Pop valves derived from Adams&#x27;s patent design of 1873, with an extended lip. R. L. Ross&#x27;s valves were patented in 1902 and 1904. They were more popular in America at first, but widespread from the 1920s on.
Although polished brass safety valve coverings had been an early feature of steam locomotives, the only railway to maintain this tradition after pop valves were introduced was the Great Western Railway, with their distinctive tapered brass safety valve bonnets and copper-capped chimneys.

=== Marine and Cockburn high-lift safety valves ===
Developments in high-pressure water-tube boilers for marine use placed more demands on safety valves. Valves of greater capacity were required, to vent safely the high steam-generating capacity of these large boilers. As the force on their valves increased, the issue of the spring&#x27;s increasing stiffness as its load increased (like the Naylor valve) became more critical. The need to reduced valve feathering became even more important with high-pressure boilers, as this represented both a loss of distilled feedwater and also a scouring of the valve seats, leading to wear.

High-lift safety valves are direct-loaded spring types, although the spring does not bear directly on the valve, but on a guide-rod valve stem. The valve is beneath the base of the stem, the spring rests on a flange some height above this. The increased space between the valve itself and the spring seat allows the valve to lift higher, further clear of the seat. This gives a steam flow through the valve equivalent to a valve one and a half or twice as large (depending on detail design).

The Cockburn Improved High Lift design has similar features to the Ross pop type. The exhaust steam is partially trapped on its way out and acts on the base of the spring seat, increasing the lift force on the valve and holding the valve further open.

To optimise the flow through a given diameter of valve, the full-bore design is used. This has a servo action, where steam through a narrow control passage is allowed through if it passes a small control valve. This steam is then not exhausted, but is passed to a piston that is used to open the main valve.

There are safety valves known as PSV&#x27;s and can be connected to pressure gauges (usually with a 1/2&quot; BSP fitting). These allow a resistance of pressure to be applied to limit the pressure forced on the gauge tube, resulting in prevention of over pressurisation. the matter that has been injected into the gauge, if over pressurised, will be diverted through a pipe in the safety valve, and shall be driven away from the gauge.

==Types==

There is a wide range of safety valves having many different applications and performance criteria in different areas. In addition, national standards are set for many kinds of safety valves.

===United States===
* ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) Boiler &amp; Pressure Vessel Code, Section I
* ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) Boiler &amp; Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1
* API (American Petroleum Institute) Recommended Practice 520 and API Standard 526, API Standard 2000 (low pressure - Storage tank)

===European Union===

* ISO 4126 (harmonized with European Union directives)
* EN 764-7 (former CEN standard, harmonized with European Union directives, replaced with EN ISO 4126-1)
* AD Merkblatt (German)
* PED 97/23/CE (Pressure Equipment Directive - European Union)

==Water heaters==

Safety valves are required on water heaters, where they prevent disaster in certain configurations in the event that a thermostat should fail. Such a valve is sometimes referred to as a &quot;T&amp;P valve&quot; (Temperature and Pressure valve). There are still occasional, spectacular failures of older water heaters that lack this equipment. Houses can be leveled by the force of the blast.

==Pressure cookers==

Pressure cookers are cooking pots with a pressure-proof lid. Cooking at pressure allows the temperature to rise above the normal boiling point of water (100 degrees Celsius at sea level), which speeds up the cooking and makes it more thorough.

Pressure cookers usually have two safety valves to prevent explosions. On older designs, one is a nozzle upon which a weight sits. The other is a sealed rubber grommet which is ejected in a controlled explosion if the first valve gets blocked. On newer generation pressure cookers, if the steam vent gets blocked, a safety spring will eject excess 
pressure and if that fails, the gasket will expand and release excess pressure downwards between the lid and the pan. 

Newer generation pressure cookers have a safety interlock which locks the lid when internal pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, to prevent accidents from a sudden release of very hot steam, food and liquid, which would happen if the lid were to be removed when the pan is still slightly pressurised inside (however, the lid will be very hard or impossible to open when the pot is still pressurised).

<text>Schönebeck was a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the middle of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) the district-free city Magdeburg, the districts Jerichower Land, Anhalt-Zerbst, Köthen, Bernburg, Aschersleben-Staßfurt and Bördekreis.

== History ==
The district was created on July 1, 1816, with the capital Calbe, and was therefore named &quot;Landkreis Calbe&quot;. 1946 Schönebeck became a district-free city, but was reincorporated into the district in 1950 and became the new administrative seat. It was also renamed to &quot;Landkreis Schönebeck&quot; then to represent the change of capital.

== Geography ==
Main rivers in the district are the Elbe and the Saale. The landscape is the mostly flat &quot;Magdeburger Börde&quot;. The elevation of the district ranges between 43 m and 123 m above sea level.

==Partnerships==
In 1991 the district started a friendship with the Polish district Jarosław, which was converted into a partnership in 2001. Another friendship with the district Wittmund in Lower Saxony.

<doc id="304621" wikidata="Q295014" url="?curid=304621" title="AMD K6-III">
<text>The K6-III (code name: &quot;Sharptooth&quot;) was an x86 microprocessor line manufactured by AMD that launched on February 22, 1999. The launch consisted of both 400 and 450 MHz models and was based on the preceding K6-2 architecture. Its improved 256 KB on-chip L2 cache gave it significant improvements in system performance over its predecessor the K6-2. The K6-III was the last processor officially released for desktop Socket 7 systems, however later mobile K6-III+ and K6-2+ processors could be run unofficially in certain socket 7 motherboards if an updated BIOS was made available for a given board. The Pentium III processor from Intel launched 6 days later.

At its release, the fastest available desktop processor from Intel was the Pentium II 450 MHz, and in integer application benchmarks a 400 MHz K6-III was able to beat it as the fastest processor available for business applications. Just days later on February 26 Intel released the Pentium III &quot;Katmai&quot; line at speeds of 500 MHz, slightly faster than the K6-III 450 MHz.

Intel retained the lead in 3D gaming performance. Many popular first person games at the time were specifically tuned to extract maximum performance from Intel&#x27;s pipelined floating point unit in drawing their 3D environments. Since the K6-III inherits the same floating point unit as the K6-2 (low latency but not pipelined), unless the game was updated to use AMD&#x27;s 3D-Now! SIMD instructions - performance could still remain significantly lower than when run on Intel.

==Architecture==

In conception, the design is simple: it was a K6-2 with on-die 256KiB L2 cache. In execution, however, the design was not simple, with 21.4 million transistors. The pipeline was short compared to that of the Pentium III and thus the design did not scale well past 500 MHz. Nevertheless, the K6-III 400 sold well, and the AMD K6-III 450 was clearly the fastest x86 chip on the market on introduction, comfortably outperforming AMD K6-2s and Intel Pentium IIs.

===3DNow!===

3DNow! is an extension to the x86 instruction set developed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). It added single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions to the base x86 instruction set, enabling it to perform vector processing, which improves the performance of many graphic-intensive applications. The first microprocessor to implement 3DNow was the AMD K6-2, which was introduced in 1998.

The K6-III+ had the &quot;Enhanced 3DNow!&quot;(Extended 3DNow! or 3DNow+) which added 5 new DSP instructions, but not the 19 new extended MMX instructions.

===TriLevel Cache===
The original K6-2 had a 64 KB primary cache and a much larger amount of motherboard-mounted cache (usually 512 KB or 1024 KB but varying depending on the choice of motherboard). The K6-III, with its 256 KB on-die secondary cache, re-purposed the variable-size external cache on the motherboard as the L3 cache. This scheme was termed &quot;TriLevel Cache&quot; by AMD. The L3 cache has a capacity of up to 2 MB.

==Market performance==
Intel&#x27;s Pentium II replacement was not yet available but, as a stop-gap, Intel introduced a modestly revised version of the Pentium II and re-badged it as the &quot;Pentium III&quot;. The base design was unchanged (the addition of SSE instructions was at that time of no performance significance) but Intel&#x27;s new production process allowed clockspeed improvements, and it became difficult to determine which company&#x27;s part was the faster.

Both firms were keen to establish a clear lead, and both experienced manufacturing problems with their higher-frequency parts. AMD chose not to sell a 500 MHz or faster K6-III after the rare 500 MHz K6-III had been immediately recalled; it was found to be drawing enough current to damage some motherboards. AMD preferred to concentrate on their soon-to-be-released Athlon instead. Intel produced a 550 MHz Pentium III with some success but their 600 MHz version had reliability issues and was soon recalled.

With the release of the Athlon, the K6-III became something of an orphan. No longer a competitive CPU in its intended market segment, it nevertheless required substantial manufacturing resources to produce: in spite of its 21.4 million transistors, its 118 mm² die was considerably smaller than the 184 mm² of the 22-million-transistor Athlon (cache RAM taking much less area per-transistor than logic), but the K6-III was still significantly more costly to produce than the 81 mm² 9.3 million-transistor K6-2 CPUs (roughly 2/3 the size of the K6-III). For a time, the K6-III was a low priority part for AMD—something to be made only when all orders for high-priced Athlons and cheap-to-produce K6-2s had been filled—and it became difficult to obtain in significant quantities.

The original K6-III went out of production when Intel released their &quot;Coppermine&quot; Pentium III (a much improved part that used an on-die cache) and, at the same time, switched to a new production process. The changeover was fraught with difficulties and Intel CPUs were in global short supply for 12 months or more. This, coupled with the better performance of the Athlon, resulted in even many former Intel-only manufacturers ordering Athlon parts, and stretched AMD&#x27;s manufacturing facilities to the limit. In consequence, AMD stopped making the K6-III in order to leave more room to manufacture Athlons (and K6-2s).

=== K6-III+ and K6-2+ ===
By the time the x86 CPU shortage was over, AMD had developed and released revised members of the K6 family. These K6-2+ and K6-III+ variants were specifically designed as low-power mobile (laptop) CPUs, and significantly marked the transition of the K6 architecture (and foretold of AMD&#x27;s future K7 project) to the new 180 nm production process. Functionally, both parts were die shrunk K6-IIIs (the 2+ disabled 128 KiB of cache, the III+ had the full 256 KiB) and introduced AMD&#x27;s new PowerNow! power saving technology. PowerNow! offered processor power savings for mobile applications by measuring computational load, and reduced processor operational voltage and frequency during idle periods in order to reduce overall system power consumption.

Although intended for notebook computers, both parts found an enthusiast following also in desktop systems as some motherboard companies (such as Gigabyte and FIC) provided BIOS updates for their desktop motherboards to allow usage of these processors. For other officially not supported mainboards, the enthusiast community created unofficial BIOS updates on their own. These boards became firm favorites within the overclocking community. Both the K6-III+ and K6-2+ 450 MHz CPUs were routinely overclocked to over 600 MHz (). Unfortunately, even with the 180 nm process shrink, the K6 architecture&#x27;s short 6-stage pipeline while efficient, was difficult to scale with regards to clock speed. K6 III+ and 2+ were never offered higher than 570 MHz officially, and overclocking efforts using air cooling achieved a maximum around 800 MHz (133x6) at best - however this constraint was also exacerbated by a lack of Socket 7 motherboards supporting stable speeds over 112 MHz FSB.

As AMD&#x27;s marketing resources at the time were focused on the launch of the upcoming Athlon K7 processor line, the 180 nm K6 series were relatively unknown outside of the industry.

<text>The Rose of Tralee International Festival is an event which is celebrated among Irish communities all over the world. The festival, held annually in the town of Tralee in County Kerry, takes its inspiration from a 19th-century ballad of the same name about a woman called Mary, who because of her beauty was called &quot;The Rose of Tralee&quot;. The words of the song are credited to C. (or E.) Mordaunt Spencer and the music to Charles William Glover, but a story circulated in connection with the festival claims that the song was written by William Pembroke Mulchinock, a wealthy Protestant, out of love for Mary O&#x27;Connor, a poor Catholic maid in service to his parents.

==History==
The festival has its origins in the local Carnival Queen, once an annual town event, fallen by the wayside due to post-war emigration. In 1957, the Race Week Carnival was resurrected in Tralee, and it featured a Carnival Queen. The idea for the festival came when a group of local business people met in Harty&#x27;s bar, Tralee to come up with ideas to bring more tourists to the town during the horse racing meeting and to encourage expats to return to their native Tralee. Led by Dan Nolan, then Managing Director of &quot;The Kerryman&quot; newspaper, they hit on the idea of the Rose of Tralee Festival. The event started in 1959 on a budget of £750.

The founders of the organisation were Billy Clifford, an accountant with the Rank Organisation, who was one of the first recipients of the Golden Rose award (which was inaugurated to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Festival of Kerry); Dan Nolan, owner of the local newspaper The Kerryman, involved with the Tralee Races; Jo Hussey, a shopkeeper in Tralee; Ted Keane Snr, a local restaurateur, and Margaret Dwyer, a New Yorker, with strong Tralee roots, who moved back to Tralee in 1948 with her two young boys having been widowed in 1945. 

Originally, only women from Tralee were eligible to take part. In the early 1960s it was extended to include any women from Kerry, and in 1967 it was further extended to include any women of Irish birth or ancestry. Recent winners have included women of mixed heritage: Mindy O&#x27;Sullivan (Filipina-Irish), Tara Talbot (Filipina-Irish), Clare Kambamettu (Indian-Irish) and Kirsten Mate Maher (Zambian-Irish). On winning the title in 2018 Maher said &quot;There is no &#x27;typical Irish woman&#x27;. We&#x27;re all different and we all come in all shapes and sizes and skin colours... We&#x27;re such a diverse community, and we need to embrace that&quot;.

In 2004 the Rose of Tralee Regional Finals were introduced to offer more people an opportunity to participate in the Rose of Tralee International Festival. It was held every year until 2015 in Portlaoise, County Laois on the June Bank Holiday weekend.

In the inaugural Regional Final, fourteen women competed for three places in the Rose of Tralee International Festival in August. It became bigger each year and in 2015 the Regional Finals brought together 56 Roses from the United States, Ireland, Britain, Europe, Canada and the United Arab Emirates. Over three selection nights, seven Irish Roses and sixteen International Roses were then selected to progress and join the other 9 Roses at the Rose of Tralee International Festival in August.

From 2004 to 2015, the number of Rose Centres grew to more than 65. In 2014 it was announced that the 2015 Regional Finals would be the last, in favour of a revamped selection process held in Tralee.

The 2020 and 2021 events were cancelled due to the restrictions in place to address the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. In December 2021, it was announced that the festival would return in 2022.

In December 2021, it was also announced by Anthony O&#x27;Gara that married women and transgender women can enter for the Rose of Tralee, and that the maximum age limit had increased to 29 years of age.

In July 2023, it was announced that Kathryn Thomas would join Dáithí Ó Sé as a co-host, marking the first time that the event would have two presenters.

==Modern practice==
The Rose of Tralee festival is held every year in Tralee, County Kerry, to choose a young woman to be crowned the Rose. The winner is the woman deemed best to match the attributes relayed in the song: &quot;lovely and fair&quot;. She is selected on the basis of personality and should be a good role-model for the festival and ambassador for Ireland during her travels around the world. It is not a beauty pageant and the participants (Roses) are not judged on their appearances but on their personality and suitability to serve as ambassadors for the festival. The festival bills itself as a celebration of the &quot;aspirations, ambitions, intellect, social responsibility and Irish heritage&quot; of modern young women.

Each of the 32 counties of the island of Ireland selects a Rose, and the international Roses, chosen from around the world, also participate in the qualifying rounds now staged in the Festival Dome in Tralee. Ultimately, 32 Roses are selected to appear in the televised selection finals on RTÉ One, out of whom one is crowned the Rose of Tralee.

The selection, which is broadcast over two nights by RTÉ, has been hosted by Dáithí Ó Sé since 2010. It was previously presented for 17 years by Gay Byrne. Other previous presenters include Terry Wogan, Brendan O&#x27;Reilly, Michael Twomey, Kathleen Watkins, Ray D&#x27;Arcy, Ryan Tubridy, Marty Morrissey and Derek Davis. The first presenter of The Rose of Tralee (before it was televised) was Kevin Hilton.

The festival overcame financial difficulties in 2004, and has strengthened with growing visitor numbers and maintaining strong viewer figures.

The maximum age for women is 29 years of age. Married women are also eligible to enter as of December 2021. Until the year 2008, unmarried mothers were not allowed to enter the contest.

Men also participate in the show in the form of Rose Escorts, who assist the Roses during their time in the festival. The escort who works hardest is named &quot;Escort of the Year&quot;, and is invited back to the festival the following year.

===Media portrayals===
The Channel 4 comedy &quot;Father Ted&quot; parodied the festival in the episode &quot;Rock-a-Hula Ted&quot; where the eponymous character is asked to host the local &quot;Lovely Girls&quot; competition. 
Will Scally produced and directed a Channel Four documentary called &quot;Rose of Tralee&quot;.

===Commemoration===
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the festival in 2009, 50 Roses took part in the 2009 competition; usually there are around 30.

In 2014, Maria Walsh revealed that she was gay after winning.

Michele McCormack (1985 Chicago Rose) has gone on to win an Edward R. Murrow Award in her chosen profession of broadcast journalism. She hosts selection contests in Philadelphia and in the Midwest of the USA. (She credits her interview technique to Gay Byrne, who hosted the contest when she was in Tralee.) Other notable Roses include Aoife Mulholland of Galway (2003) who went on to achieve acclaim as an actor, and Noreen Culhane (New York Rose 1970) now Executive Vice-President of the New York Stock Exchange.

Gabby Logan, the BBC TV sports presenter, was the Leeds Rose in 1991.

Jeanine Cummins, the author of American Dirt, participated in the competition in 1993.

<doc id="304642" wikidata="Q7384599" url="?curid=304642" title="Ryan Tubridy">
<text>Ryan Tubridy (born 28 May 1973) is an Irish broadcaster. He currently presents the weekday mid-morning programme &quot;The Ryan Tubridy Show&quot; on Virgin Radio UK, as well as a weekend programme on Sundays.

His broadcasting career with RTÉ spanned over two decades, where he presented many shows on radio and television, most notably &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on RTÉ One from 2009 to 2023. Other shows he presented include RTÉ 2fm&#x27;s &quot;The Full Irish&quot; (2004–2009) and &quot;Tubridy&quot; (2010–2015), RTÉ One&#x27;s &quot;Tubridy Tonight&quot; (2004–2009), RTÉ Radio One&#x27;s &quot;The Tubridy Show&quot; (2005–2010) and &quot;The Ryan Tubridy Show&quot; (2015–2023). He also hosted the Rose of Tralee contest on two occasions and worked for BBC Radio.

Tubridy wrote several books, including &quot;JFK in Ireland&quot;, &quot;The Irish Are Coming&quot; and &quot;Patrick and the President&quot;. He was known as the highest-paid person at RTÉ over several years; related controversies included his refusal to take a voluntary pay cut in 2009, and, most importantly for his career, in 2023 over misstatement of his total earnings and additional payments, at least some made via a costly &quot;barter account&quot; mechanism. The latter scandal led to RTÉ dispensing with Tubridy&#x27;s services in August 2023.

==Background and early life==
===Birth and education===
Born in Booterstown, Dublin, in 1973, Tubridy was educated at Carysfort National School and Blackrock College. Tubridy studied Greek and Latin, and was schooled alongside Craig Doyle and Ryle Nugent.

He studied for his Bachelor of Arts (BA) in history and Greek and Roman civilisation at University College Dublin (UCD). While he was interested in the Students&#x27; Union when he was attending UCD, Tubridy made his impression while engaging in social, rather than political, activities. He was also a member of the Fianna Fáil Kevin Barry Cumann, and involved with the Dún Laoghaire branch of Ógra Fianna Fáil, as well as Belfield FM.

===Parents and wider family===
One of five children, Tubridy&#x27;s siblings are Judith, Niall, Rachel and Garrett; he also has two half-sisters from his father&#x27;s second marriage. His father, Patrick Tubridy of Blackrock, who died in January 2013, was a psychiatrist, working at the St John of God campus in Stillorgan, and the only son of the Fianna Fáil TD Seán Tubridy (1897–1939). Seán Tubridy was the only son of Patrick Tubridy (1869–1920) and Jane Waldron (born 1868). Tubridy&#x27;s mother is Catherine (née Andrews), whose father, Todd Andrews, was a prominent associate of Fianna Fáil founder Éamon de Valera and held a number of posts in semi-state companies. 

Of his siblings, Niall is a Professor of Clinical Medicine and one of the country&#x27;s leading neurologists. Garrett ran unsuccessfully for the Pembroke-Rathmines ward of Dublin City Council at the 2009 local elections. During the election campaign Ryan was advised against making public appearances alongside his brother.

A maternal uncle, Niall Andrews, was a TD and MEP, while another maternal uncle, David Andrews, was an Irish Government minister. Two of his first cousins, Barry Andrews and Chris Andrews, have also sat in Dáil Éireann as Fianna Fáil TDs, the former being a Minister of State for Children in the coalition government of Brian Cowen, since then becoming chief executive of aid charity GOAL, while the latter was re-elected to Dáil Éireann as a Sinn Féin member in 2020. Another first cousin, David Andrews Jnr, is a comedian who works under the pseudonym of David McSavage. Following Tubridy&#x27;s departure from &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, McSavage publicly criticised him for never having him as a guest in his 14 years as host. McSavage regularly appeared as a guest under Tubridy&#x27;s predecessor Pat Kenny. Tubridy also claims actor Tom Cruise as a distant relation through marriage.

==Broadcasting career==
Though later noted for his perceived bookishness, it was television films that interested Tubridy as a child; he wrote to RTÉ at the age of 12, to complain that there should be more of those on TV for the likes of him and others who were his age. RTÉ responded by inviting Tubridy to review films on its Saturday morning programme &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, and so began a long relationship with the broadcaster.

Tubridy&#x27;s association with broadcasting and books began later, when he was reviewer on &quot;Poporama&quot;.

===RTÉ===
====Radio====

After leaving college Tubridy became a runner in RTÉ, initially working on &quot;The Gerry Ryan Show&quot; as maker of tea and coffee. Tubridy said at the death of Gerry Ryan that &quot;The moment I set foot in RTÉ, he put his wing around me and said: &#x27;I like what you do. I like what you are. I&#x27;m going to look after you.&#x27;&quot; He credits Ryan for his kindness &quot;in a place which is so full of ego and bizarre resentment&quot;. Tubridy was also influenced by the &quot;nerd made good&quot; style of British broadcaster Chris Evans.

Later he worked as a reporter for &quot;Today with Pat Kenny&quot;, as well as occasionally presenting the radio news show &quot;Five Seven Live&quot;. In the summer of 1999, Tubridy presented &quot;Morning Glory&quot; on RTÉ Radio 1 and in July 2000 he moved to &quot;The Sunday Show&quot;. From 2002 until 2005 he presented RTÉ 2fm&#x27;s morning breakfast show, &quot;The Full Irish&quot;. The move to the morning by Head of 2fm John Clarke was seen as risky, with station insiders disapproving and &quot;Hot Press&quot; publishing a double-page editorial with the headline &quot;station in turmoil&quot;. Within one year its ratings had soared and Tubridy was given a major award. When &quot;The Full Irish&quot; ended it was the second most popular radio programme in Ireland, after &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;. Clarke later described moving Tubridy to the morning as the best decision of his 25-year career in radio.

In 2006, Tubridy began presenting &quot;The Tubridy Show&quot;, on weekday mornings on RTÉ Radio 1. Around this time, he wrote a column for the &quot;Sunday World&quot; in which he expressed amongst other things his support for Barack Obama, &quot;one of his favourite singers&quot; Fionn Regan and the success of Kenny Egan, a silver medal winning boxer at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He later interviewed Said Obama, the uncle of U.S. President Barack Obama for &quot;The Tubridy Show&quot;. Tubridy hinted he would consider moving to new pastures if the opportunity arose.

After the death of Gerry Ryan, Tubridy&#x27;s friend and colleague, Tubridy was the subject of rumours by various newspapers that he would be succeeding him in the RTÉ 2fm slot, becoming RTÉ&#x27;s top earner with a salary of 1 million. In June 2010, RTÉ confirmed that Tubridy would in fact fill that slot from August, presenting a programme called &quot;Tubridy&quot; from 09:00 to 11:00. His salary remained unchanged. In an RTÉ press release, he was quoted as saying: &quot;In my new role on RTÉ 2fm I will be presenting a programme that will be very different, with a different time slot, and a different style of presenting.&quot; To allow for presenting &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, his show was only two hours long, compared to the 3 hours that Gerry Ryan&#x27;s show lasted. However JNLR figures released in July 2011 revealed Tubridy had lost over 110,000 listeners since the move.

After finishing &quot;The Tubridy Show&quot; on 16 July 2010, he began presenting &quot;Tubridy&quot; on RTÉ 2fm on 20 August 2010, surprising listeners by starting the programme three days earlier that what was originally scheduled for 23 August. His first guest on the programme was Bono. His RTÉ Radio 1 slot was filled by John Murray. &quot;Tubridy&quot; became synonymous with declining listenership figures, a 40% collapse of which by 2011 coincided with increased listenership figures for its rival &quot;The Ray D&#x27;Arcy Show&quot;.

Tubridy returned to RTÉ Radio 1 in September 2015 to host &quot;The Ryan Tubridy Show&quot;, an hour-long weekday morning show. On 17 August 2023, it was confirmed that Tubridy would not return to his presenting role in RTÉ after negotiations with RTÉ Director General Kevin Bakhurst collapsed in the wake of the RTÉ secret payment scandal. He had been off-air since the revelations broke.

====Television====

Tubridy was presumed heir to Gay Byrne as presenter of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; as early as 2003, when he was about to take over as presenter of the Rose of Tralee, another of Byrne&#x27;s former roles. At that time, Tubridy had never presented a live television programme.

After graduating from reviewing films as a child, Tubridy initially limited his TV appearances, preferring to concentrate on radio instead. He tried on a wedding outfit on fashion magazine show &quot;Off the Rails&quot; and appeared on &quot;The Panel&quot;. It was during an episode of this show that he aired his thoughts on breastfeeding, characterising it as similar to urinating in public, an opinion for which he received public criticism.

He refused RTÉ&#x27;s leading afternoon TV programme &quot;Open House&quot;, upon discovering that it required his services on Fridays only. His first serious effort at his own TV show was &quot;All Kinds of Everything&quot;, a music nostalgia programme that took its title from the song of the same name, which, as a schoolgirl, Dana sang at the Eurovision Song Contest 1970. Before this had even been broadcast, however, Tubridy had been offered the Rose of Tralee presenting vacancy, which he accepted. RTÉ was set on Derek Mooney, but festival organisers objected and Tubridy landed the role.

Tubridy presented the &quot;EsatBT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition&quot; at the Royal Dublin Society, in 2003 and 2004. He presented the RTÉ People in Need Telethon in 2004 and 2007.

In October 2004, &quot;Tubridy Tonight&quot; began. This was his own live Saturday night talk show, seen as a successor to &quot;Kenny Live&quot; (formerly &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;). Tubridy initially announced his intention to take over the hosting of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; from Pat Kenny but he later stated that he would remain as host of &quot;Tubridy Tonight&quot;, describing it as his &quot;&quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot; job&quot; and &quot;little fun-size legacy&quot;.

However, it was announced on 11 May 2009 that Tubridy would indeed succeed Pat Kenny as host of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. He vowed to bring back Gay Byrne&#x27;s &quot;one for everybody in the audience&quot; catchphrase, described by Will Hanafin in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; as an attempt to &quot;dig up more old relics than archaeologists would on an excavation&quot;, in reference to Tubridy&#x27;s passion for history. Tubridy said he was &quot;very taken aback&quot; to learn he had been selected, describing it as &quot;a humbling honour to be asked to present such an iconic programme&quot;. His role as host allowed him to fulfill a childhood ambition – presenting &quot;The Late Late Toy Show&quot; – &quot;I know this is the one that I always wanted. I love the fact that children are uncontaminated by the reality of adulthood&quot;. &quot;Tubridy Tonight&quot; concluded on 30 May 2009.

Tubridy&#x27;s first guest on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was Taoiseach Brian Cowen, an interview that drew an audience share of 62 per cent. Gay Byrne, the original host, was one of Tubridy&#x27;s guests in December 2009.

Tubridy often clashed with his guests. In May 2011, a former director of television at RTÉ, Helen O&#x27;Rahilly, said of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;: &quot;If I was back in charge of RTÉ, you wouldn&#x27;t see this utter shite on Friday night&quot;.

On 16 March 2023, Tubridy announced that he would be stepping down as the presenter of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; after 14 years. His last show was broadcast on 26 May at the end of the 2023 season. Tubridy requested a &quot;low key/no fuss&quot; finale and no wrap party was held between Tubridy and his production team after the final episode aired, and there were no speeches. Patrick Kielty was announced as Tubridy&#x27;s successor.

===BBC Radio===
In July 2010, Tubridy&#x27;s agent Noel Kelly confirmed that Tubridy was offered by the BBC to present a summer filler for Jonathan Ross&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 programme. He turned down the offer citing preparations for &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and the recent death of Gerry Ryan. It was confirmed that Tubridy would present the slot for eight weeks from 23 July 2011, covering for Ross&#x27; replacement, Graham Norton.

Tubridy returned to the BBC in December 2011, this time as a replacement for Ken Bruce on Radio 2. Amid constant media criticism related to declining listenership and viewership figures, he received support from Chris Evans and was defended by Vincent Browne. Tubridy has also stood in for Chris Evans on the Radio 2 Breakfast Show, and Simon Mayo on the Radio 2 drivetime slot. In 2015, he has also stood in on Terry Wogan&#x27;s weekend show on Sunday.

===Presenting the Toy Show===

Tubridy has spoken of the personal pleasure he takes from his annual presenting of &quot;The Late Late Toy Show&quot;, which he did ahead of Christmas for fourteen editions of the programme between 2009 and 2022. Tubridy explained: &quot;When you guys aren&#x27;t here and the &quot;Toy Show&quot; isn&#x27;t on, I&#x27;m walking around Clifden (in County Galway) or Dublin or wherever, and you&#x27;re the Toy Man to children, all year round. It is one of the greatest, weirdest gifts I&#x27;ve ever been given&quot;.

In November 2022, ahead of what turned out to be his last edition of the &quot;Toy Show&quot;, Tubridy visited St Finian&#x27;s National School in Finglas, where he was reminded of the Toy Man effect. He explained: &quot;I looked through the window, and I&#x27;d forgotten the magic of the &quot;Toy Show&quot; and the Toy Man because jaws dropped, mouths were grabbed, eyes came out&quot;. Tubridy said that the children in each class he visited would ask him three questions: what age he was, why he had chosen to come to their school, and did he like Fanta? This last question resulted from Tubridy&#x27;s &quot;fizzy orange fumble&quot;, a controversy which resulted from uncertainty over which word Tubridy used when he swore on the &quot;Toy Show&quot; in 2020.

===Tuttle Productions Limited===
The microcompany Tuttle Productions Limited was set up on 29 August 2008, with a registered address at Drayton Mews, Monkstown Road, Monkstown, County Dublin, and one shareholder. It is involved in &quot;Radio and Television Activities&quot;.

During his time with RTÉ, Tubridy was not an employee, but was a contractor, and, as of 2011, was reported to be paying himself €283,756 a year from his production company, Tuttle Productions.

===Virgin Radio UK===
On 16 November 2023, it was announced that Tubridy would join Virgin Radio UK in early January 2024 to present its mid-morning programme live from London following &quot;The Chris Evans Breakfast Show&quot;.

Tubridy presented his first show on Virgin Radio UK on 2 January, with &quot;The Ryan Tubridy Show&quot; airing weekdays from 10am to 1pm and simultaneously broadcast on Dublin&#x27;s Q102. It was also announced that he would host a dedicated Irish weekend programme each Sunday, with &quot;The Ryan Tubridy Show on Sundays&quot; airing from 10am to 12pm on Dublin&#x27;s Q102, Cork&#x27;s 96FM, LMFM, and Limerick&#x27;s Live 95.

==Other activities==
On 2 November 2011, Tubridy was MC and guest of honour for the launch of the Irish Film Archive Preservation Fund at the Irish Film Institute.

The following month he helped switch on the Christmas lights on Grafton Street.

===Children&#x27;s and cancer charities===
Tubridy is a UNICEF ambassador. His interest in reading leads to his particular interest in childhood literacy.

Tubridy has also been associated with the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul Toy Appeal.

After &quot;The Late Late Toy Show&quot; Tubridy often sent his famous jumpers off to be auctioned for charity. The jumper he wore on his 2009 &quot;Toy Show&quot; debut found a suitable cause in the 2010 Haiti earthquake and was dispensed with on the radio programme &quot;Money&quot;. That jumper raised €1,050. The jumper he wore on the 2011 &quot;Toy Show&quot; he donated to the fund of artist Alexandra Trotsenko on the radio programme &quot;Liveline&quot;. €10,000 was raised for SVP from the auction of the infamous &quot;Elf Christmas Jumper&quot; after the 2012 edition of &quot;The Late Late Toy Show&quot;.

As well as his interest in the welfare of children, Tubridy has assisted in the promotion of other, more adult, initiatives, including the launch of a breast cancer initiative in May 2009.

In February 2015, Tubridy combined his long-running interests in children and cancer when he officially launched Galway&#x27;s Hand in Hand support centre, which provides support and counselling services for parents of children with cancer.

===Writing===
For more than €100,000 HarperCollins signed Tubridy as part of a two-book deal. They wanted an autobiography but he persuaded them otherwise. Tubridy&#x27;s first book, the 302-page long &quot;JFK in Ireland&quot;, was launched at the Mansion House, Dublin on 27 October 2010. It is a profile of U.S. President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1963 visit to Ireland. While researching the book, he discovered that Éamon de Valera had part of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s speech to Dáil Éireann erased from the record after finding its content offensive. In March 2012, Tubridy, referred to as a &quot;tabloid star&quot;, made his American television debut, during which he discussed his book, &quot;JFK in Ireland&quot;. Tubridy&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Irish Are Coming&quot;, about the influence of Irish people in the UK, was published by William Collins in 2013.

A first book for children, &quot;Patrick and the President&quot;, was later published. In 2017, to coincide with the centenary of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s birth, Tubridy read to children from the book at a tea party in County Wexford.

Tubridy co-wrote the title track, &quot;We Are Where We Are&quot;, of Paddy Cullivan&#x27;s extended play, released in October 2010. The writer and broadcaster commented: &quot;Paddy is a pal and we would have conversations a lot over a pint of Guinness&quot;. He also sang a song on &quot;The Late Late Toy Show&quot; in 2010, becoming the first host to do such a thing.

===Social media and other Internet issues===
Tubridy has expressed his disdain for &quot;anonymous cowards on the internet&quot;, those who operate &quot;under the shadowy cover of names like Catman or Twenty Rothmans or whatever&quot;, and has stated that he believes Wikipedia is &quot;a fact-free bull run for any passing eejit to come along and add whatever fact or fiction they desire and up it goes onto the site&quot;. He prefers books instead.

A former user of Twitter, where he amassed more than 60,000 followers, was described by the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; as &quot;one of Ireland&#x27;s most famous Twits&quot;. Tubridy left the social networking and microblogging service on 9 August 2011, posting a late night farewell to his followers: &quot;Dear Twitter, this is my last tweet. It&#x27;s been lots of fun but I must leave. No drama, just not enough time. Thanks and take care. #goodbye. The Tubridy Radio Show and Late Late Show will have well attended Twitter accounts as I leave this curious social medium.&quot;

In 2018, Tubridy said returning to a Nokia 3310 allowed him to instruct his daughters on &quot;better smartphone etiquette&quot;. Speaking out against smartphones, Tubridy said he was &quot;starting to treat phones in the house much like cigarettes were treated once upon a time. In other words, it&#x27;s rude to smoke in front of somebody without asking permission, it&#x27;s rude, it&#x27;s not good for you to smoke that much - if at all - and it&#x27;s unsociable if you&#x27;re sitting on the couch and someone lights up... it&#x27;s just rude and I hate that.&quot;

After a five-year break, he returned to social media and created an Instagram account.

==Controversies==
===Issues around pay===
====2009 pay-cut refusal====
In 2008, Tubridy was the RTÉ presenter on the fourth-highest salary, having received a 50% increase in his salary from the previous year.

Tubridy refused to take a pay-cut in early 2009 (even when colleagues such as Pat Kenny and Marian Finucane agreed to salary cuts), and he attracted criticism for this decision. Tubridy&#x27;s decision not to take a pay-cut was criticised on social networking site Facebook. Later, on 9 March 2009, Tubridy announced he would take a 10 per cent pay cut, stating that his legal situation had changed in recent days.

====Reported earnings====
It was reported in December 2018 that he earned €495,000 in 2016, suggesting that his earnings had not increased from the 2015 figure, and in January 2021 that Tubridy had earned €495,000 for each of the previous three years. It was further reported in February 2023 that Tubridy was still RTÉ&#x27;s highest earner, with the figures given at that time indicating that Tubridy had been paid €466,250 in 2020 and €440,000 in 2021.

====2023 pay revelations====

It emerged publicly in June 2023 that the figures previously published relating to Tubridy&#x27;s earnings were inaccurate and that he had been earning more than half a million all along, with a total discrepancy of €345,000; this had been supplied, at least in part, through a barter account, attracting substantial additional costs. The scandal caused by this was associated with massive public disquiet, political comment and the resignation of the Director General of RTÉ.

On 22 June 2023, following internal work dating back some months, RTÉ admitted that it paid Tubridy €345,000 more than publicly declared between 2017 and 2022, in what the chair of its board said was a &quot;serious breach of trust with the public&quot;, with more than €80,000 more spent on fees associated with the transfer of €150,000 of that extra money. In a statement, Tubridy said he was &quot;surprised&quot; to learn about the &quot;errors&quot; and &quot;can&#x27;t shed any light&quot; on hidden payments made to him by RTÉ. It was revealed the next day that the Director General of RTÉ Dee Forbes had been suspended from her employment by the RTÉ Board a day prior to the controversy and issued a statement defending her record. Tubridy then issued a second statement in which he sought to explain his position, apologising &quot;wholeheartedly&quot; for failing to ask questions. Forbes resigned from RTÉ with immediate effect on 26 June. On 27 June, RTÉ&#x27;s acting Director General Adrian Lynch issued a nine-page statement addressing the circumstances around the revelations, stating that there was &quot;no finding of wrongdoing&quot; against Tubridy or the commercial partner involved in what happened. Tubridy and his agent agreed to attend two Oireachtas committee meetings on 11 July, which heard that he had endured a &quot;tortuous&quot;, &quot;chaotic&quot; and &quot;destructive&quot; three weeks during which his name and reputation were &quot;sullied&quot; and that he had become &quot;the face of a national scandal; accused of being complicit, deceitful and dishonest&quot;. It was later confirmed that Tubridy would not return to his presenting role in RTÉ in the wake of the scandal.

===Environmental record===
Tubridy rarely covered environmental topics while working for RTÉ. The magazine &quot;Village&quot; has contrasted this with Tubridy&#x27;s history of car ownership and his criticism of Greta Thunberg in 2019.

Tubridy drove a BMW before he signed a two-year contract with Lexus in June 2003 &quot;to drive an IS200 and to participate in a number of Lexus customer events and promotions&quot; and mentioned in an interview with the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; in 2004 how he was enjoying its heated seats. Tubridy&#x27;s involvement with Lexus ended when the company refused to provide him with a more expensive car, with Tubridy resuming his relationship with BMW. BMW said Tubridy had asked for a new flashier car, but confirmed that it had refused him this, as it came around the time BMW was concluding its &quot;brand ambassadorship&quot; policy. In August 2012, Tubridy was seen on a new blue Vespa scooter, after reports (which later proved inaccurate) that his salary had been reduced by €150,000.

Several years later, it was revealed that Tubridy had exchanged his BMW for a Jaguar XJ. To promote the 2014 Jaguar Golf Classic, Tubridy was pictured with rugby player Eoin Reddan in front of a Jaguar F-TYPE. In 2020, Tubridy was pictured in a modern Volvo. In a 2021 interview with &quot;The Times&quot; Tubridy stated that his car was a 14 year-old. In 2022, when the topic of electric cars was discussed on his radio show, Tubridy repeatedly stated: &quot;I drive an old car, it&#x27;s an &#x27;07, but it&#x27;s a beautiful looking car&quot;.

In 2019, Tubridy attracted criticism for remarks made about climate activist Greta Thunberg following a speech she had given at the United Nations, where he had expressed concern at the stress of campaigning at a young age potentially having a negative effect on Thunberg&#x27;s health and wellbeing, describing her face as appearing &quot;contorted in pain, in agony and in anxiety&quot; when she had been giving her speech.

===Castration call incident===
In May 2011, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland upheld a complaint against Tubridy who called a paedophile a &quot;monster&quot; and &quot;creature&quot; and added: &quot;From what I gather these guys cannot be quote-unquote cured ... only one way to deal with them, and that&#x27;s physiological ... these guys should have bits taken off.&quot;

==Personal life==
Tubridy lived for many years in Monkstown in south Dublin, at one point in a €1 million+ refurbished Victorian end-of-terrace house which measured 240 square metres (2,600 square feet), but put up for sale in 2015, when he described it as &quot;too much&quot; for him. One report in 2023 suggested that he might now live in Clontarf. 

He has claimed British broadcaster Sir David Attenborough as one of his heroes; prior to interviewing him on &quot;Tubridy Tonight&quot; in March 2009, Tubridy said he &quot;grew up watching his nature programmes&quot;. Among his favourite films are &quot;The Queen&quot; and &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot;. Noted for interests ranging from U.S. politics (he took time off work to cheer on Barack Obama in that country&#x27;s 2008 presidential election), &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; box sets (the lead character of which he described as &quot;the morose and melancholic opera lover who deals with an inordinate amount of bloodshed in Oxford&quot;), &quot;real turf, the John Hinde donkey post card kind&quot; and buying out-of-print history books on Amazon.com—while appearing on &quot;Seoige and O&#x27;Shea&quot; in April 2008, Tubridy ranked his top three books of the previous year as &quot;The Road&quot; by Cormac McCarthy, &quot;Christine Falls&quot; by Benjamin Black and &quot;Exit Ghost&quot; by Philip Roth. He is fond of the humour of Gerry Ryan and the fictional character Ross O&#x27;Carroll-Kelly. Before taking over as host of the Rose of Tralee in 2003, Tubridy admitted that he did not often make his own food, but that he was capable of frying onions and liked to buy adult portions of kiddies meals.

===Family===
Tubridy met his wife, the producer Anne Marie Power at RTÉ in 1997 when he spotted her in a recording studio. He later spoke of the moment they met: &quot;She was going in to make a programme, I was going out. My head turned and my life changed. I pursued her relentlessly. She used to sashay down the corridor and I was quite taken by her. She was very erudite and she made documentaries on flamenco. She was much brighter than I am and continues to be, which isn&#x27;t that hard really if you dig deep enough, and I asked her out.&quot; The couple had a daughter, Ella, and later married in 2003, Tubridy having proposed in the Abbeyglen Hotel (a &quot;favourite haunt&quot; of his) in Clifden, County Galway. The engagement was announced in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; with the words &quot;Ella Tubridy is delighted to announce the engagement of her parents Ryan and Anne Marie&quot;. Tubridy visited Pompeii on his honeymoon. 

Tubridy separated from his wife in 2006. They have two children, Ella and Julia.

===Later relationship===

After separating from his wife, Tubridy has been at various times involved with Aoibhinn Ní Shúilleabháin, a radio and television presenter. Tubridy expressed his dissatisfaction when photos of the couple on a stroll at Powerscourt Waterfall were used by the press and was frustrated by subsequent claims that the photos were a publicity stunt. He later told the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; (in the week approaching his début as host of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;) that Ní Shúilleabháin was &quot;great support&quot; and had transformed his life. In 2010 he told the same newspaper she was &quot;my rock&quot; since the death of friend and colleague Gerry Ryan.

Referring to the type of woman he would like, Tubridy said: &quot;I like intelligence, I like a good conversation. I like elegance, I like a girl who is feminine without being vain, I like a little retro in terms of fashion and look and sprinkle it with a little sense of humour. I also love a girl who appreciates the darkness. I&#x27;m a lot darker than people think – plenty of dark humour.&quot; While dating Ní Shúilleabháin in 2013, Tubridy introduced his radio audience to Jessica Drake, &quot;a cracking-looking bird, no doubt about it, with big tattoos on her ankles&quot;. On the same occasion he elaborated further on his ideal woman (&quot;I think there has to be a certain quality of product and standards kept&quot;) and favours women having a &quot;quality tick&quot; on their backside that would showcase their abilities to prospective male partners.

In December 2014, Tubridy&#x27;s agent Noel Kelly announced that he and Miss Ní Shúilleabháin had separated, saying &quot;Aoibhinn and Ryan are no longer together&quot;.

In 2023, Tubridy was reported to be spending time with former Rose of Tralee winner, Clare Kambamettu.

===Health===
On 30 March 2020, RTÉ announced that Tubridy had tested positive for COVID-19. In a statement issued to RTÉ, Tubridy said &quot;Like so many other people in Ireland, I tested positive, but I was in the very fortunate position to have a very unintrusive experience, which I now have come to the end of. While I&#x27;ve been at home watching television and listening to the radio, I have been bowled over by the extraordinary work of our front line heroes and their families who continue to make Ireland a healthier and safer place. I look forward to being back to work really soon.&quot; On 7 April 2020 he returned to work on his radio show saying that &quot;I disappeared because I felt it was the right thing to do. And it was, in many ways, a useful thing for me to do because I was pretty tired anyway, and to take a couple of weeks to just to rest was really, a very, very good thing to do. I feel on top of the world today.&quot;

==Image==
In his early career, Tubridy often described himself as a &quot;young fogey&quot;.

Dermot Whelan, Dave Moore and Siobhan O&#x27;Connor of radio station 98FM rewrote the Steps song &quot;Tragedy&quot; to include lyrics which make personal references to Tubridy before playing it on their morning radio show. The song pokes fun at his famous ears as well as his hairstyle with the line: &quot;His ears stand up like the FA Cup, he sits in his chair chatting with Holy Communion-style hair&quot;. Tubridy himself rang the show to congratulate Dermot, Dave and Siobhan on their achievement of &quot;taking the mick out of him&quot; with a song of &quot;pure ego&quot; that caused him to &quot;burst out laughing when I saw it&quot;. He was less pleased when Gordon Ramsay, appearing as a guest on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, poked fun at his ears and weight; Tubridy later remarked on &quot;The Ray D&#x27;Arcy Show&quot;: &quot;I thought he was a bit, em, British for my liking. I won&#x27;t be buying the books [Ramsay was promoting]. In fact, I didn&#x27;t take the free one&quot;.

While hosting &quot;Tubridy Tonight&quot;, he spoke of the public&#x27;s perception of him, saying: &quot;I think I am a victim of my own image. I think it&#x27;s been cultivated by others for me. I live in a very ordinary semi-detached house. People only ever see me on a Saturday night on TV and I&#x27;m in a smart suit with a book-lined backdrop so that&#x27;s what they think – you&#x27;re Johnny smart suit with a book-lined backdrop.&quot; Podge and Rodge, a televised puppet chat show, commented on his &quot;stupid awkward eyes, he reminds me of the undead&quot; and introduced him as &quot;South Dublin on a stick&quot; when he appeared on their TV show.

Rhys Ifans and Howard Marks appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on 1 October 2010 to discuss &quot;Mr. Nice&quot;, the British independent film in which Ifans portrayed Marks. The incident followed on from Ifans&#x27;s playful request to buy Tubridy a drink. Tubridy said, &quot;Uh absolutely&quot; then tried to ask Ifans about his latest film. Ifans said, &quot;It&#x27;s called &quot;Neverland&quot; and uh, it&#x27;s a prequel to &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. Yeah? OK? Are you familiar with that?&quot; &quot;I sure am&quot; said Tubridy. &quot;Because you&#x27;ve got very Peter Panny feet&quot; Ifans continued. Tubridy thanked him for the compliment then Ifans smiled and said &quot;Dainty little bugger&quot; to laughter from the studio audience.

==Awards and recognition==
Tubridy won the Best Irish DJ category at the 2004 Meteor Awards for his breakfast show, &quot;The Full Irish&quot;. He was named Best Male TV Presenter at the TV Now Awards in 2009. He collected the award for &quot;Favourite Irish TV Show&quot; from then girlfriend Aoibhinn Ní Shúilleabháin, won by &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; at the 2010 awards. &quot;The Dubliner&quot; magazine awarded him the title Dubliner of the Year in 2009. &quot;Village&quot; named him 29th most influential person of 2009.

On 15 March 2023, Tubridy received the Guaranteed Irish Person of the Year Award for 2023, with the presenter described as having &quot;long been a supporter of Guaranteed Irish&quot; and highlighting &quot;his continued championing of Irish business, support of Irish brands, and overall embodiment of the core values of Guaranteed Irish&quot;. In May 2023, Tubridy was awarded the President&#x27;s Medal by the Library Association of Ireland for his work promoting reading and libraries.

<doc id="304645" wikidata="Q5030652" url="?curid=304645" title="Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate">
<text>The Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate (CUSID generally) is the national organization which governs all English language competitive university debating and public speaking in Canada. It sanctions several official annual tournaments and represents Canadian debating domestically and abroad. Its membership consists of student debating unions, sanctioned by their respective universities, from across Canada. CUSID has been described as &quot;a student-run, parliamentary debate league with close ties to the American Parliamentary Debate Association&quot;.

Many prominent Canadians were university debaters, including Prime Ministers Justin Trudeau, Joe Clark and Brian Mulroney, MP John Godfrey, Canadian Supreme Court justices Ian Binnie and Morris Fish, songwriter Leonard Cohen, entrepreneur Moses Znaimer, environmentalist David Suzuki, and journalist Ian Hanomansing. CUSID debaters have gone on to notable careers in law, business, government and academia and the presidency of the organization is a highly sought-after position.

== History ==
CUSID was officially founded in 1978, although it held its first annual tournament in 1977. The regular tournaments held under its auspices, such as those at the University of Toronto, McGill University, the University of Western Ontario, Queen&#x27;s University, and the University of Ottawa predate CUSID&#x27;s formation by many decades.

Founded as a national organization with strong central Canadian region roots, over the years, individual regional differences—particularly the separate identities of &quot;CUSID East&quot; and &quot;CUSID West&quot;—have become more pronounced. One of its primary functions is facilitating communications between its members institutions. Until the late 2000s, those communications have been primarily through their online forum, &quot;CUSIDnet&quot;, first set up in 1994, as the first online student debating forum in the world. More recently, communications are conducted through social media platforms such as Facebook.

Annual intervarsity tournaments held in Canada include the McGill University Winter Carnival, the Queen&#x27;s University Chancellor&#x27;s Cup and Sutherland IV, the Carleton University Lord Dorchester Cup, the University of Toronto Hart House IV, the University of Ottawa Father Guindon Cup, and the Wilfrid Laurier University/University of Waterloo Seagram&#x27;s IV.

The inaugural British Parliamentary National Championship (now known as the Canadian Universities Debating Championship) was hosted in 2004 at the University of Toronto. Unlike other CUSID title tournaments, participants do not need to be a member of a CUSID institution in order to take part. This leads to the tournament to often be attended by American and other international teams.

In 2020, for the first time in history, the society was forced to cancel its Canadian Parliamentary National Debating Championship due to the risk presented by COVID-19. Other tournaments affected included Carleton&#x27;s Lord Dorchester Cup, the North American Womxn and Gender Minorities Debating Championship and numerous American tournaments. In July 2020, the National Championship was revived by hosting an online iteration organized by the year&#x27;s original host institution, the University of Calgary Debate Society. Due to continued pandemic restrictions, the entirety of the 2020–2021 season was also held online.

In 2020 CUSID voted to end the long-standing tradition to not allow hybrid teams (teams representing two different institutions) at Canadian Parliamentary Nationals, the Central Canadian Debating Championship, the Atlantic Canadian Debating Championship and the Western Canadian Debating Championship. This aligned them with the society&#x27;s British Parliamentary Championship, which has always allowed such teams.

In 2024, the British Parliamentary National Championship was renamed to the Canadian Universities Debating Championship (CUDC). The inaugural CUDC, organized by the University of Waterloo, brought together 61 teams from 16 universities across 7 provinces, exceeding pre-pandemic participation levels.

== Organization ==
CUSID is subdivided into three regional bodies, representing each region of Canada:
* CUSID Central, for Ontario and Quebec, which sponsors the Central Canadian Debating Championship (&quot;Léger Cup&quot;)
* CUSID East, for the Atlantic Provinces, which sponsors the Atlantic Canadian Debating Championship
* CUSID West, for the Western Provinces, Territories, and the U.S. state of Alaska, which sponsors the Western Canadian Debating Championship (&quot;McGoun Cup&quot;)

CUSID nationally and internationally sanctions several official championship tournaments, including:
* Canadian Parliamentary National Debating Championship
* British Parliamentary Debating Championship (typically called BP Champs)
* Central Canadian Debating Championship (the Léger Cup)
* Western Canadian Debating Championship (the McGoun Cup)
* Atlantic Canadian Debating Championship
* North American Debating Championship (with the American Parliamentary Debate Association)
* North American University Debating Championship
* World Universities Debating Championship (with other national debate organizations)

The president of CUSID is the head of the organization and leads an elected executive team of six national and regional officers. They also represents CUSID and Canadian debating interests inside and outside of Canada, and is the Canadian representative on the World Universities Debating Council. They are elected annually by the member institutions at the National Championships.

There have been seven CUSID Presidents who have won either of the National Championships during their term as President: Jason Brent (1992), Gerald Butts (1993), Robert Silver (2000), Vinay Mysore (2010), Louis Tsilivis (2013), 
Harar Hall (2019), and Daniel Svirsky (2023, 2024).

=== Notable Presidents of CUSID ===
* Matthew Mendelsohn (1986–1988)
* Todd Swift (1988–1989)
* Gerald Butts (1992–1993)
* Shuman Ghosemajumder (1994–1995)

== Formats ==

=== Canadian Parliamentary ===
Many CUSID tournaments are held in the Canadian Parliamentary Style of debate. This style emphasizes argumentation and rhetoric, rather than research and detailed factual knowledge. Each round consists of two teams – the government team and the opposition team – each of which consists of two debaters. Teams alternate between government and opposition at tournaments. The speaking times in CUSID Central and East are:

* Prime Minister Constructive (PMC): 7 minutes
* Member of Opposition (MO): 7 minutes
* Minister of the Crown (MC): 7 minutes
* Leader of Opposition (LO): 10 minutes
* Prime Minister Rebuttal (PMR): 3 minutes

There are also alternative timings that may be used in other competitions. For example, the Canadian Student Debating Federation&#x27;s (CSDF) 2011 Rules for Debate outlined 8 minutes each for the MO, MC and LO, as well as 5 minutes for PMC and 3 minutes for PMR. Additionally, a new modification to the prior CUSID Central and East times was introduced at the 2003 McGill University Winter Carnival Invitational called the Prime Minister&#x27;s Rebuttal Extension (PMRE). The PMRE allows the government team the option to take a 6-minute PMC and 4-minute PMR and was designed to help compensate for the alleged inherent advantage to the opposition side. In most rounds, the resolution is &quot;squirrelable&quot;, meaning that the government team can propose any topic it wants for debate. The PMC lays out the topic for debate and presents arguments in favor of its position. The opposition team must then immediately present opposing arguments. New arguments can be presented in the first four speeches; they are prohibited in the rebuttal speeches. In the early 2010s the &quot;opposition choice&quot; option was introduced. Rather than presenting the motion as it stands, the Prime Minister lays out the topic and the opposite bench has the option of choosing which side of the motion they would prefer.

&quot;Points of information&quot; are generally permitted and expected in the standard Canadian Parliamentary style. With POIs, debaters may rise and attempt to ask a question of an opposing debater, who can choose whether to accept or refuse the question. It is generally considered good form to accept at least a few questions during a speech.

=== British Parliamentary ===

Tournaments are otherwise held in British Parliamentary, sometimes known as WUDC style. Presently, all tournaments for the first semester of the academic year, September–December, use British Parliamentary as the format. This is for teams to prepare for the World University Debating Championship which occurs over New Year&#x27;s each year. Since its introduction, British Parliamentary has become the more competitive of the two formats, largely because it is the format used for international competition.

<text>Aquaman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #73 (November 1941). Initially a backup feature in DC&#x27;s anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series. During the late 1950s and 1960s superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding member of the Justice League. In the 1990s Modern Age, writers interpreted Aquaman&#x27;s character more seriously, with storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis.

The son of a human lighthouse keeper and the queen of Atlantis, Aquaman is the alias of Arthur Curry, who also goes by the Atlantean name Orin. Others to use the title of Aquaman include a short-lived human successor, Joseph Curry; his protégé Jackson Hyde; and the mysterious Adam Waterman, who was briefly active during World War II. Aquaman&#x27;s comic books are filled with colorful undersea characters and a rich supporting cast, including his mentor Vulko, his powerful wife Mera, and various sidekicks such as Aqualad, Aquagirl, and Dolphin. Aquaman stories tend to blend high fantasy and science fiction. His villains include his archenemy, Black Manta, and his half-brother, Ocean Master.

The character&#x27;s original 1960s animated appearances left a lasting impression, making Aquaman widely recognized in popular culture and one of the world&#x27;s most recognized superheroes. Jokes about his wholesome, weak portrayal in &quot;Super Friends&quot; and perceived feeble powers and abilities have been staples of comedy programs and stand-up routines, leading DC several times to attempt to make the character edgier or more powerful in the comic books. Modern comic book depictions have tried to reconcile these various aspects of his public perception, with many versions often casting Aquaman as serious and brooding, weighed down by his public reputation, his responsibilities as king, and the complex world of Atlantean politics.

Aquaman has been featured in several adaptations, first appearing in animated form in the 1967 &quot;The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure&quot; and then in the related &quot;Super Friends&quot; program. Since then he has appeared in various animated productions, including prominent roles in the 2000s series &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as several DC Universe Animated Original Movies. Actor Alan Ritchson also portrayed the character in the live action television show &quot;Smallville&quot;. In the DC Extended Universe, actor Jason Momoa portrays the character in the films &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, &quot;Justice League&quot; and its director&#x27;s cut &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;, &quot;Aquaman&quot;, the HBO Max series &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, and &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&quot;.

==Creation==
Artist Paul Norris spoke on the inception of the character stating, &quot;One day when I had brought in a finished
script to Murray Boltinoff, I was told that Whit wanted to see me...I stopped in Whit’s office. They wanted to start a new feature about a character that lived in the sea. Whit asked me to create the character... that is how AQUAMAN was born.&quot;

==Publication history==
Aquaman&#x27;s appearances began in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #73 in 1941 and continued until issue #107, after which all superhero stories were replaced with humor features. At this time, in 1946, Aquaman was transferred to &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; with issue #103 along with the other superhero features from &quot;More Fun Comics&quot;. Aquaman would continue to feature in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; for the next 15 years, being one of the few DC superheroes to appear continuously throughout the 1950s.

In 1961, Aquaman starred in a four-issue run in the anthology series &quot;Showcase&quot; in issues #30–33. These Showcase issues are notable as Aquaman&#x27;s first cover appearances in any comic. Simultaneously, the Aquaman backup feature ended in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; with issue #284 and was transferred to &quot;Detective Comics&quot; with issue #293.

Soon thereafter, the first &quot;Aquaman&quot; solo series began, with the first issue cover-dated February 1962. The same month, the backup feature in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; ended with issue #300. Simultaneously with the solo series, an Aquaman backup feature was also published in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot; #125–139 (cover-dated May 1962 to February 1964). The solo series &quot;Aquaman&quot; would last 56 issues in its initial run until 1971.

After a three-year hiatus, Aquaman returned as a backup feature in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; for issues #435–437 before becoming the main feature in issues #441–452. This run transitioned into a revival of the &quot;Aquaman&quot; solo series in 1977, resuming the initial run&#x27;s numbering at #57; however, the series ended after just seven issues with #63 in 1978.

Aquaman once again returned to &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; as part of the Dollar Comics revamp of the series, appearing in issues #460–466 over 1978–1979. When this ended, Aquaman appeared in three issues of &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; (#262–264) and then returned to &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; as the first feature for four more issues (#475–#478) and as a backup in issues #491–500. The feature found a new home as a backup in &quot;Action Comics&quot; for 14 issues (#517–521; #527–530; #536–540), which would be the end of Aquaman&#x27;s Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; solo appearances.

Aquaman&#x27;s first Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearance was in the four-issue miniseries &quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 2) in 1986, which gave the character a new blue costume which did not reappear in any later series. This blue &quot;camouflage&quot; suit, however, was used as inspiration for one of the main suits in the &quot;Aquaman&quot; film sequel &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&quot; in 2023. In 1988 the character starred in the one-shot &quot;Aquaman&quot; #1, followed by the &quot;Legend of Aquaman Special&quot; one-shot issue in 1989. This was followed by the five-issue miniseries &quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 3). A new ongoing series, &quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 4), began in 1991, but was cancelled after 13 issues.

The character was reinvented in the 1993–1994 miniseries &quot;Aquaman: Time and Tide&quot;, which provided a revamped origin for Aquaman. This was followed by a new ongoing series, &quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 5), which lasted until 2001 with 75 issues altogether, making it the longest-running Aquaman solo series to date.

&quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 6) was launched in 2003, following on from the Obsidian Age storyline in &quot;JLA&quot;. In the wake of the DC event miniseries &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and DC&#x27;s &quot;One Year Later&quot; relaunch, the series was renamed &quot;Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis&quot; with issue #40 until the final issue (#57); these 18 issues starred a brand new, younger Aquaman named Arthur Joseph Curry. There were no more solo Aquaman publications in Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, although the original Aquaman did feature as a main character in the limited series &quot;Brightest Day&quot;.

&quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot in September 2011 saw the beginning of the ongoing series &quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 7). A spin-off team title, &quot;Aquaman and the Others&quot;, also ran for 11 issues from 2014 to 2015. &quot;Aquaman&quot; vol. 7 lasted for the entirety of the &quot;New 52&quot; era of DC, ending with issue #52 in 2016 as part of the line-wide relaunch &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;. The &quot;New 52&quot; volume was immediately followed by the one-shot issue &quot;Aquaman: Rebirth&quot;, preceding the launch of the ongoing series &quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 8), which ended with issue #66.

Upon cancellation of Aquaman vol. 8, Aquaman did not have a self-titled release until a digital only series titled &quot;Aquaman: Deep Dives&quot; released in 2020. Throughout 2022 Aquaman appeared in both &quot;Aquaman: The Becoming&quot;, and &quot;Aquamen&quot; which saw Aquaman train Jackson Hyde/Aqualad to take over his mantle. However, by the end of 2022, it seemed DC was moving away from this decision as they began publishing regular Aquaman team-up stories again. These included the seven-issue series &quot;Aquaman/Green Arrow: Deep Target&quot; and the three issue &quot;Aquaman/The Flash: Voidsong&quot;. In August 2022, Aquaman received a three-issue mini-series called &quot;Aquaman: Andromeda&quot; under DC&#x27;s adult audience comic series DC Black Label. The most current Aquaman titled released was the &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom Special&quot; one-shot, released in October 2023 to coincide with the release of the Aquaman sequel film of the same name.

==Fictional character biography==
===Golden Age===

Aquaman&#x27;s first origin story was presented in flashback from his debut in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #73 (November 1941), narrated by the character himself:

In his early Golden Age appearances, Aquaman can breathe underwater and control fish and other underwater life for up to an hour. Initially, he was depicted as speaking to sea creatures &quot;in their own language&quot; rather than telepathically and only when they were close enough to hear him (within a radius). Aquaman&#x27;s adventures took place all across the world and his base was &quot;a wrecked fishing boat kept underwater,&quot; in which he also lived.

During his wartime adventures, most of Aquaman&#x27;s foes were Nazi U-boat commanders and various Axis villains from when he once worked with the All-Star Squadron. The rest of his adventures in the 1940s and 1950s had him dealing with several sea-based criminals, including modern-day pirates such as his longtime archenemy Black Jack, as well as various threats to aquatic life, shipping lanes, and sailors.

Aquaman&#x27;s last appearance in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; was in issue #106, before being moved along with Superboy and Green Arrow to &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, starting with issue #103 in 1946.

In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot; #1 (2022), writer Geoff Johns restores a variation of the Golden Age Aquaman to DC continuity. This version&#x27;s profile tells the story of an Aquaman who was the predecessor of Arthur Curry. This Aquaman was the unnamed son of two well-respected scientists who studied what they believed to be the underwater ruins of Atlantis (in reality an abandoned Atlantean scientific outpost), where they lived in an underwater lab. This unique environment seemed to slowly alter their young son&#x27;s physiology. The boy learned how to breathe in the water, developed incredible strength, and formed a bond with sea life while training some of them to aid him in his underwater heroic activities. In 1941, he first appeared to the surface world as Aquaman. While he turned down the offer to join the Justice Society of America when he encountered Green Lantern, he was briefly a member of the All-Star Squadron. In 1947, Aquaman left the sea where he sought to live on the land using the alias of &quot;Adam Waterman&quot;. He retreated back to the ocean soon after for reasons unknown. This Aquaman disappeared from the public eye in the 1950s.

At the end of the &quot;Flashpoint Beyond&quot; limited series, this version of Aquaman was among &quot;The Thirteen&quot; characters &quot;removed from time&quot; seen in the custody of the Time Masters. The capsules containing this Aquaman and those with him were found to have failed and they have been pulled back to the 1940s, restoring them to DC&#x27;s history in modern-day stories.

===Arthur Curry===
====Silver Age====
Aquaman&#x27;s adventures continued to be published in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; through the 1940s and 1950s, as one of the few superheroes to last through the 1950s in continuous publication. Starting in the late 1950s new elements to Aquaman&#x27;s backstory were introduced, with various new supporting characters added and several adjustments made to the character, his origins, his power and persona. The first of these elements was the story &quot;Aquaman&#x27;s Undersea Partner&quot; in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #229 (October 1956), where his octopus sidekick Topo was first introduced. This and subsequent elements were later removed or altered from the Aquaman character after the establishment of DC&#x27;s multiverse in the 1960s, attributed to the Aquaman of Earth-One.

The Silver Age Aquaman made his first appearance in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #260 (May 1959). In it and subsequent Silver Age comics, it was revealed that this Aquaman was Arthur Curry, the son of lighthouse keeper Tom Curry and Atlanna, a water-breathing outcast from the lost underwater city of Atlantis. Due to his heritage, Aquaman discovered as a youth that he possessed various superhuman abilities, including the powers of surviving underwater, communication with sea life and tremendous swimming prowess. Eventually, Arthur decided to use his talents to become the defender of the Earth&#x27;s oceans. It was later revealed that in his youth Arthur had adventured as Aquaboy and, on one occasion, met Superboy, Earth&#x27;s only other publicly active superpowered hero at the time. When Arthur grew up, he called himself &quot;Aquaman&quot;.

It was later revealed that after Atlanna&#x27;s death, Tom Curry met and married an ordinary human woman and had a son named Orm Curry, Aquaman&#x27;s half-brother. Orm grew up as a troubled youth in the shadow of his brother, who constantly bailed him out of trouble with the law. He grew to hate Aquaman not only for the powers that he could never possess, but also because he believed that their father would always favor Aquaman. Orm disappeared after becoming an amnesiac and would resurface years later as Aquaman&#x27;s nemesis the Ocean Master.

Aquaman&#x27;s ability to talk with fish eventually expanded to full-fledged telepathic communication with sea creatures even from great distances. He also retroactively developed a specific weakness akin to Superman&#x27;s vulnerability to kryptonite or Green Lantern&#x27;s vulnerability to the color yellow: Aquaman had to come into contact with water at least once per hour or he would die. Prior to this, Aquaman could exist both in and out of water indefinitely.

In &quot;Aquaman&quot; #18 (December 1964), Aquaman married Mera in the first superhero wedding depicted in a comic book.

Aquaman was included in the &quot;Justice League of America&quot; comic book series, appearing with the team in their first adventure, and was also a founding member of the team. Aquaman took part in most of the 1960s adventures of the superhero team.

Aquaman&#x27;s supporting cast and rogues gallery soon began to grow with the addition of Aqualad, an outcast, orphaned youth from an Atlantean colony whom Aquaman took in and began to mentor. Aquaman later discovered the submerged fictional city of New Venice, which became Aquaman&#x27;s base of operations for a time.

Aquaman is recognized as the son of Atlanna and is later voted to be the King after the death of the former regent, who had no heirs. By this time, Aquaman had met Mera, a queen from a water-based dimension, and married her shortly after he became king. They soon have a son, Arthur Jr. (nicknamed &quot;Aquababy&quot;).
The 1960s series introduced other such archenemies as the Ocean Master (Aquaman&#x27;s amnesiac half-brother Orm), Black Manta, the Fisherman, the Scavenger, and the terrorist organization known as O.G.R.E. Other recurring members of the Aquaman cast introduced in this series include the well-meaning but annoying Qwsp (a water sprite); Dr. Vulko, a trustworthy Atlantean scientist who became Aquaman&#x27;s royal advisor and whom Aquaman eventually appoints to be king after leaving the throne himself; and Tula (known as &quot;Aquagirl&quot;), an Atlantean princess who was Aqualad&#x27;s primary love interest.

In the mid-1980s, after his own feature&#x27;s demise, Aquaman is briefly made the leader of the Justice League of America. In a storyline in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #228–230, an invasion of Earth by a race of Martians occurs at a time when the core members are missing. Aquaman is thus forced to defend Earth with a League much depleted in power and capability, and he takes it upon himself to disband the Justice League altogether in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; Annual #2 (1984), thereafter reforming it with new bylaws requiring members to give full participation to the League&#x27;s cases.

With the help of veteran Justice League members the Martian Manhunter, Zatanna, and the Elongated Man, Aquaman recruits and trains four new and untried members: Gypsy, Vibe, Vixen, and Steel. Arthur also relocates the team&#x27;s headquarters to a reinforced bunker in Detroit, Michigan after the destruction of the JLA&#x27;s satellite headquarters during the Martian invasion. Aquaman&#x27;s participation in this new version of the Justice League ended in #243 (October 1985), when he resigned to work on his marriage with Mera.

====Modern Age====
After the 1985 miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, several short miniseries were produced in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, beginning with 1986&#x27;s four-issue miniseries &quot;Aquaman&quot; (February–May 1986), written by Neal Pozner and featuring Aquaman in a new, largely deep-sea blue &quot;camouflage&quot; costume. The series was well received and a follow-up limited series was in the works, but was eventually cancelled due to creative problems. This series also expanded on several details of the Silver Age Aquaman&#x27;s origin as well as Aquaman&#x27;s relationship with his half-brother, the Ocean Master, whose origin was retold in more complete detail. The series also added mystical elements to Aquaman&#x27;s mythology and reinvented the Ocean Master as a sorcerer. Aquaman reappeared in his blue costume in &quot;Aquaman Special&quot; #1 (1988).
In late 1988, the character appeared in the &quot;Invasion!&quot; storyline, guest-starring with the Doom Patrol and once again wearing his trademark orange and green costume.

In 1989, the &quot;Legend of Aquaman Special&quot; (officially titled as &quot;Aquaman Special&quot; #1 in the comic&#x27;s legal indicia, the second &quot;Special&quot; in back-to-back years) rewrote Aquaman&#x27;s mythos and origin while still keeping most of his Silver Age history intact. The special was written by writer Robert Loren Fleming with plots/breakdown art by Keith Giffen and full pencil art by artist Curt Swan.

This origin story of the Modern Age recounts that Aquaman is born as to Queen Atlanna and the mysterious wizard Atlan in the sunken Atlantean city of Poseidonis. As a baby, Orin was abandoned to die on Mercy Reef (which is above sea level at low tide, causing fatal air exposure to Atlanteans) because of his blond hair, which was seen by the superstitious Atlanteans as a sign of a curse they called &quot;the Mark of Kordax.&quot; The only individual who spoke up on Orin&#x27;s behalf was Vulko, a scientist who had no patience for myth or superstition. While his pleas fell on deaf ears, Vulko would later become a close friend and advisor to the young Orin.

As a feral child who raised himself in the wilds of the ocean with only sea creatures to keep him company, Orin was found and taken in by a lighthouse keeper named Arthur Curry who named Orin &quot;Arthur Curry&quot; after himself. One day, a young Arthur returns home and finds that his adoptive father has disappeared, so he sets off on his own. In his early teens, Orin ventures to Alaska, where he meets and falls in love with an Inupiaq girl named Kako. It is also here that he first earned the hatred of Orm, the future Ocean Master, who was later revealed to be Arthur&#x27;s half-brother by Atlan and an Inupiaq woman.

As detailed in the five-issue miniseries &quot;Aquaman&quot; (June–October 1989) (by the same creative team of the 1989 special of Robert Loren Fleming, Keith Giffen, and Curt Swan), which continued a few of the themes from the &quot;Legend of Aquaman Special&quot;, Mera is eventually driven insane by grief over the death of her son, Arthur Jr., and is committed to an asylum in Poseidonis. Shortly afterwards, a jellyfish-esque alien force conquers Atlantis. Arthur is forced to save the city, but is hampered by an escaped Mera, who personally blames Arthur for the death of their son. In a fit of rage, Mera leaves Earth for her homeworld of Xebel in another dimension.

The publication of writer Peter David&#x27;s &quot;The Atlantis Chronicles&quot; #1–7 (March–September 1990), which tells the story of Atlantis from antediluvian times to Aquaman&#x27;s birth, introduced the ancient Atlantean characters Orin (after whom Aquaman was named) and Atlan (who was revealed to be Aquaman&#x27;s father).

Another &quot;Aquaman&quot; ongoing series with creative team Shaun McLaughlin and Ken Hooper (#1–13) thereafter ran from December 1991 to December 1992, which portrayed Aquaman reluctantly deciding to remain in Poseidonis as its protector once again. For a time, Arthur served as Atlantis&#x27; representative to the United Nations, but always found himself thrust back into the superhero role. Becoming more and more of a workaholic and solitary figure, Aquaman eventually returned to the oceans and soon becomes tangled up in another attempt by Black Manta to destroy Atlantis by dragging it into a war with a surface nation.

Peter David returned to the character in another miniseries, &quot;Aquaman: Time and Tide&quot;, a 1993–1994 four-issue miniseries which further explained Aquaman&#x27;s origins, as he finally learns all about the history of his people through the &quot;Atlantis Chronicles&quot;, which are presented as historical texts passed down and updated through the centuries. Aquaman learns that his birth name was Orin and that he and his enemy the Ocean Master share the same father, &quot;an ancient Atlantean wizard&quot; named Atlan. This revelation sends Orin into a bout of rage and depression, setting the stage for later confrontations between the two, as it is said in the &quot;Chronicles&quot; that &quot;two brothers will also battle for control of Atlantis&quot;. This is in contrast to the Silver Age Aquaman, who had always known that the Ocean Master was his half-brother Orm, although Orm&#x27;s amnesia prevented him from remembering this fact for some time. This series is credited by Kevin Melrose of Comic Book Resources with helping the character reach the height of his modern-era popularity.

Aquaman starred in his own series again with the publication of &quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 5) #1 (August 1994), initially scripted by Peter David, following up on his 1993 &quot;Time and Tide&quot; miniseries. This series was the longest-running for the character, lasting until its 75th issue. David left the series after issue #46 (July 1998) after working on it for nearly four years.
David began by giving Aquaman an entirely new look, forsaking his former clean-cut appearance. Following his discoveries reading the &quot;Atlantis Chronicles&quot; during &quot;Time and Tide&quot;, Aquaman withdraws from the world for a time. Garth finds him weeks later, with his hair and beard grown long, brooding in his cave. Aquaman loses his left hand when the madman Charybdis, attempting to force Arthur to show him how he can harness Arthur&#x27;s ability to communicate with sea life, sticks Arthur&#x27;s hand into a piranha-infested pool. This loss causes Aquaman to become somewhat unhinged and he begins having prophetic dreams, and then, feeling in need of a &quot;symbol&quot;, attaches a harpoon spearhead to his left arm in place of his missing hand. His classic orange shirt is shredded in a battle with Lobo, but rather than replace it, he instead goes shirtless for a while before donning a gladiatorial manica. After the destruction of the harpoon, Aquaman has it replaced by a cybernetic prosthetic harpoon from S.T.A.R. Labs with a retractable reel that he can fully control.

A major storyline, culminating in #25, concerns the Five Lost Cities of Atlantis. Facing an unearthly invading species linked to the origin of the Atlanteans, Aquaman has to search out and unite the lost cities. This storyline established Arthur as a Warrior King and a major political power, ruling largely undisputed over all the Atlantean cities. The remainder of Peter David&#x27;s run focused on Orin coming to terms with his genetic heritage and his role as king. During this time he discovers the remnants of a sentient alien ship beneath Poseidonis and is able to take control of it, returning Poseidonis to the surface and bringing Atlantis into greater contact with the outside world. The cultural changes this brings about, including increased tourism, as well as his conflicting duties as superhero and king, bring him into increasing tension with the political powers in his city.

After a brief stint by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, David was replaced as writer by Erik Larsen with issue #50 (Dec. 1998) and again by Dan Jurgens in issue #63 (January 2000). The series ended with issue #75 (January 2001). During this time Aquaman&#x27;s wife Mera returns, once again sane, from the otherworldly dimension where she had been trapped and Aquaman narrowly averts a coup d&#x27;état orchestrated by his son Koryak and his advisor Vulko. Arthur&#x27;s second harpoon is also destroyed, this time in a battle with Noble, King of the Lurkers. Aquaman replaces it with a golden prosthetic hand developed by Atlantean scientists which can change shape at his command, thus retaining the powers of the former harpoon while also being more all-purpose. After a brief war with an island nation, Aquaman expands Atlantis&#x27; surface influence by annexing the country to Atlantis.

Aquaman had no regular series of his own from 2001 to 2003, but his plot went through several developments via his cameo appearances in multiple other titles.

Aquaman was a founding member of the reformed JLA and remained an active, if sometimes reluctant member of that team, until the &quot;Our Worlds at War&quot; storyline in 2001 (shortly after the cancellation of &quot;Aquaman&quot; vol. 5), during which Aquaman and the city of Poseidonis disappear during a battle between Aquaman and an Imperiex probe.

The Justice League eventually found out that the city was still there, just magically shielded, but in ruins and apparently uninhabited. These Atlanteans were trapped in the ancient past, sent there by Tempest (Aqualad) as a last measure when it appeared that the city would be destroyed by the probe. There, however, they were enslaved by their own Atlantean ancestors, led by a powerful sorceress named Gamemnae, and Aquaman himself was transformed into living water and imprisoned in an ornamental pool. Over time, this civilization had collapsed until only Gamemnae herself, now immensely powerful, inhabited the ruins.

After a few months of their own time, but fully 15 years for the Atlanteans, the JLA free Aquaman in &quot;The Obsidian Age&quot; storyline in &quot;JLA&quot;. Although the original League is killed by Gamemnae, their souls are contained by the magician Manitou Raven to use in a spell to contain Gamemnae in Atlantis until the present day, when he is able to resurrect them. Aquaman is freed from his imprisonment in the pool and Zatanna enhances his abilities so that he can now control the entire ocean as a powerful water wraith. With this power, Aquaman is able to sever Gamemnae&#x27;s connection to the city by sinking it under the sea again. While he fights Gamemnae, the League members return the modern Atlanteans to the present, where they begin rebuilding the city, which is once again at the bottom of the sea. Aquaman is restored to his regular form, but for exposing the dark secrets of Atlantis&#x27;s past and being responsible for his peoples&#x27; enslavement in the past, he is put on trial by Atlantis.
A sixth &quot;Aquaman&quot; series began shortly afterward, initially written by Rick Veitch, who sought to take Aquaman in a more mystical direction. Subsequent writers who contributed to the series include John Ostrander, Will Pfeifer, Tad Williams, and John Arcudi. This series ran 57 issues, starting in December 2002 (cover-dated February 2003). Initially focusing on Aquaman&#x27;s efforts to survive after he was exiled from Atlantis and the ocean following his trial, the theme of the storyline changed when Aquaman became involved after a sizeable portion of San Diego sunk into the ocean. Over the next few months, it was discovered that the sinking was the work of a scientist who had acquired a sample of Aquaman&#x27;s DNA. Believing that the human race as it currently existed would destroy Earth, he had sunk the city while also using the DNA sample he took from Aquaman to convert most of the residents into water-breathers. Aquaman goes on to establish himself as the protector of &#x27;Sub Diego&#x27;, aided by new Aquagirl Lorena Marquez, despite such problems as the human residents&#x27; poor reaction to being trapped underwater and the Ocean Master&#x27;s attempt to rewrite history so that he is Aquaman while Orin is the Ocean Master.

Starting with #40 (May 2006), following the events of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, the series was renamed &quot;Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis&quot; which ended with issue #57 (October 2007). These issues featured a new, younger Aquaman named Arthur Joseph Curry.

Following the &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline (starting with &quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 6) #40 (May 2006)), the series was renamed &quot;Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis&quot; and taken in an entirely different direction by writer Kurt Busiek. In this version, Aquaman is missing and presumed dead following the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. A young man with aquatic powers by the name of Arthur Joseph Curry is summoned by the mysterious Dweller in the Depths to take up the mantle of Aquaman, but it gradually emerges that the Dweller himself is Aquaman, having lost much of his memory and been strangely mutated, while gaining magical powers (see the Arthur Joseph Curry section below).

These changes were explained later during the &quot;missing year&quot; between &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;One Year Later&quot; depicted in the weekly series &quot;52&quot;, where Aquaman makes a brief appearance at the memorial for Superboy. Sometime later Ralph Dibny, seemingly accompanied by Doctor Fate&#x27;s helmet, meets a bearded, long-haired and amnesic Orin in the ruins of Atlantis. The helmet portends that &quot;&quot;if&quot; he lives... &quot;if&quot; he lives... it is as a victim of the magicks of legend and the power of the sea.&quot;

During &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Orin makes a deal with the gods of the sea in a desperate bid to gain the power to save the lives of several Sub Diego inhabitants who had lost the ability to live in water. Using the bones of his severed left hand in a magical ritual, the sea gods give Orin the power to raise Sub Diego onto dry land. However, as a side effect of this, Orin mutates into the &quot;Dweller of the Depths&quot; and loses his memories. The fate the Dweller foresees for Arthur Joseph Curry once they meet is revealed to really only be a confused memory of the Dweller&#x27;s own past as Aquaman.

In the midst of trying to help his successor, Arthur Joseph, the Dweller (Orin) is murdered by Narwhal. Upon the receipt of Orin&#x27;s body, members of the Justice League of America, including Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, and the Flash, examine the body in Atlantis and wish the best for Mera and the new Aquaman.

Orin seemingly reappears in Atlantis during the 2008 &quot;Final Crisis&quot; storyline to fend off the forces of Darkseid, but this Aquaman is revealed to be from another Earth in the multiverse. The appearance of this Aquaman is later perceived by Hal Jordan and Barry Allen to be an unsubstantiated rumor, however, since this person was never seen nor heard from again. Sometime between his death and the beginning of the 2008–09 &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline, Orin&#x27;s body is moved and buried on land at Mercy Reef alongside Tom Curry in accordance with his final wishes.

In &quot;Blackest Night&quot; #1 (July 2009), Garth returns to Atlantis and tells Orin&#x27;s wife Mera that he is angry at the notion of Aquaman&#x27;s body being buried on land. Mera relays to Tempest that Orin felt safe on land and that this is indeed what Arthur wanted. Sometime later, a black power ring is seen entering Orin&#x27;s grave, bidding him to rise from the dead. Aquaman&#x27;s corpse rises, along with those of Tula and the Dolphin as revenant members of the Black Lantern Corps, and demands that Mera reunite with him in death, offering her a chance to see her son again. Garth is killed and joins the Black Lanterns himself. Mera rejects Aquaman&#x27;s corpse before fleeing. In the climax of the miniseries, Aquaman is among those resurrected by The White Lantern Entity and is reunited with Mera. The Black Lantern Ring helps reconstruct Orin&#x27;s body and when he is resurrected, his hand is restored as well.

During the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; storyline, Aquaman and Mera spend the night together in the lighthouse of Amnesty Bay, but in the morning Mera finds Arthur on the dock looking at the sea and wondering why he was resurrected. They later intercept a pirate vessel, but Aquaman finds that he can now only call on dead sea life to help him.

While cleaning up an oil spill, Aquaman and Mera are attacked by soldiers from Mera&#x27;s homeworld, led by the Siren, and Mera reveals that the Siren was sent to kill him. Mera also hints that, despite the long-lasting exile of her people, Xebel&#x27;s soldiers had been enemies of Black Manta himself from a distant time, even preceding the first public appearance of Aquaman. She also states that, despite Mera&#x27;s original mission being a solo one, the Siren is now backed by an entire Death Squad of elite Xebel soldiers acting at the orders of the acting princess and also later reveals that the Siren is her younger sister.

Aquaman is instructed by the White Lantern Entity to find Jackson Hyde before a second, unidentified group does. Mera states that she knows who Hyde is and after she tells Aquaman, he leaves and rescues Jackson from a Xebel attack. It is revealed that Aquaman&#x27;s Silver Age origin has been re-established and he is once again the half-human son of Tom Curry and an Atlantean queen. The Entity subsequently reduces Aquaman to what appears to be white water. Aquaman is revealed to be one of the Elementals, transformed by the Entity to become the element of water and protect the Star City forest from the Dark Avatar, the Black Lantern version of the Swamp Thing. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, the Swamp Thing returns Aquaman to normal. Afterward, Aquaman is reunited with Mera, at which point he discovers that the Xebels&#x27; weapons were made of Atlantean technology.

====&quot;The New 52&quot;====
As part of &quot;The New 52&quot;, DC&#x27;s 2011 relaunch of their entire superhero line, Geoff Johns, Ivan Reis and Joe Prado served as the initial creative team of the company&#x27;s new &quot;Aquaman&quot; series, the first issue of which was released September 28, 2011. The three creators remained on the title for the first 16 issues which subsequently lead into the first continual Aquaman-related crossover in years: &quot;Throne of Atlantis&quot;.

The relaunched series cemented Aquaman&#x27;s status as the half-human son of Tom Curry and Atlanna and saw him return to Amnesty Bay with Mera. Greatly distressed by the harsh treatment given to the oceans during his time as ruler of Atlantis, Aquaman decides to abdicate the Atlantean throne and return to full-time heroics. Arthur struggles, however, with his lack of reputation with the greater public, which views him as a lesser metahuman with less impressive powers than those of his peers. He is also once again a founding member of the Justice League and it is revealed in &quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 7) #7 that early in his career, Aquaman had teamed with a mysterious, loose-knit group of characters simply known as the Others. The Others consist of Aquaman, the South American jungle girl Ya&#x27;Wara and her panther, a Russian known as Vostok-X, an ex-army veteran called Prisoner-of-War, the Operative, and an Iranian called Kahina the Seer. All of the Others have in their possession an enchanted relic from Atlantis. From 2014 to 2015, an independent &quot;Aquaman and the Others&quot; series was launched based on the success of these new characters.

====Convergence====
The 2015 &quot;Convergence&quot; storyline gave Aquaman a new look at issue #41. In this story, he has been deposed from his throne by Mera, now Queen of Atlantis, who is now hunting him as a fugitive. Along the way, Arthur acquires some new powers and new equipment, giving him access to powerful mystical capabilities. It is later revealed that Atlantis is really being run by the Siren, identical twin sister of Mera, whom Mera had taken prisoner.

====&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;/&quot;DC Universe&quot;====
Following the company-wide rebranding in &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; with one focus point to bring back legacy and relationships, Arthur finally proposes to Mera in &quot;DC Universe: Rebirth&quot; #1. Aquaman was given an eighth volume of his eponymous series, which started with a one-shot comic book entitled Aquaman: Rebirth #1 (August 2016). This series kept writer Dan Abnett, who had taken over the title for the last three issues of &quot;The New 52&quot; and who had previously written the character for a short time a decade earlier. &quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 8) focuses on Aquaman&#x27;s role as king and diplomat with Arthur attempting to strengthen Atlantis-surface relationships by opening an Atlantean embassy in Amnesty Bay, with Mera appointed as ambassador. The series largely focuses on the main cast featured in the &quot;New 52&quot; series, consisting of Aquaman, Mera, and Black Manta while also fleshing out forgotten side characters such as Lagoon Boy, Tula (Aquagirl), Black Jack, and others. After the events of Drowned Earth Arthur loses his memories, begins going by Andy and lives amongst an enclave of island dwellers making their home on Unspoken Water.

Unbeknownst to him, however, this habitation is a place set within the Sphere of the Gods where forgotten sea deities go—either when/after they perish, fade from their worshipers&#x27; memories or simply forget their role in servicing the ocean&#x27;s majesty. One such goddess, who was actually a primordial adept from before time, begrudgingly makes her home on a separate island adjacent to that of the divinity who betrayed her and her departed husband. Namma, whose real name is actually Mother Salt, has every intention of drowning the world in brine with the intended consequence of killing everything that lives and breathes on it in revenge and to start over—remaking the universe in her own image.

With the help of one of Namma&#x27;s cast-off creatures—needed to regain her full power as well as aid from the forgotten gods—who is reawakened by Arthur/Andy&#x27;s clarion call through the Life Force power, Aquaman is able to best the vengeful divine progenitor and scatter her essence across the cosmos, ending her threat for a time. In thanks for aiding them in quelling their mother&#x27;s fury, the Sea Gods of the World and the newly revived Father Sea (the aforementioned life mate of Mother Salt), give praise to Arthur for his valor and integrity. The Sea Gods awaken his dormant demigod abilities by bestowing upon him tribal tattoos, christening him a bastion of the High Seas, while Father Sea himself retrieves Arthur/Andy&#x27;s trident from the waters bestowing it to him once more. Yearning to remember who he was, Arthur/Andy undergoes a ritual where he communes with another primal ocean entity known as Mother Shark, who, when asked to, restores Arthur&#x27;s memories wherein he realizes Mera killed him in a fit of rage because of his hesitation about hearing that he is going to become a father.

Aquaman and the sea gods return to Amnesty Bay, the gods settle on Amnesty Island, in an abandoned lighthouse formerly occupied by Tristram Maurer, a 19th-century horror writer. Aquaman is called upon to bail Jackson Hyde out of jail, and Jackson appoints himself Aquaman&#x27;s ”assistant”. Along with Callie and Tula, the two fight a sea monster which mysteriously disappears when the new lamp in the restored lighthouse is destroyed. An Amnesty Bay civilian named Ralph is killed during the fight, and at his funeral, Aquaman meets the resurrected Tristan Maurer.

Black Manta destroys an Atlantean historical site in order to provoke a confrontation with Mera and the recently resurrected Arthur. Mera, along with Arthur, Jackson Hyde, and Arthur&#x27;s new ally Tristan Maurer successfully fight off Manta, who is equipped with a mecha provided by Lex Luthor. Mera joins her powers with Jackson to create a gigantic, bioelectric powered water construct of herself, destroying the mecha, however, the strain of the immense hydrokinetic power Mera she is forced to use puts her in a coma, and she gives birth to her daughter Andy shortly after. Arthur was present for his daughter&#x27;s birth, and fell in love with her instantly, losing all of his trepidation about becoming a father or the kind of life they could have together. He named her Andy, the name he used while amnesiac and stranded on Unspoken Water.

Mera remains comatose for ten months, during which Arthur and Andy would regularly sneak into Atlantis to visit the comatose Mera in secret. After 10 months in a coma, Mera reawakens. With the ruse of a fake wedding to Vulko she calls to Atlantis the leaders of the 7 underwater kingdoms. Prior to the wedding, she has the entire widowhood arrested. Once all 7 kingdoms are assembled, to their surprise, Mera announces that she was dissolving the Atlantean monarchy and that she intended to hand power to the people. Orm attempts to take power for himself, however, Orm and his forces are stopped by Aquaman, assisted by the Justice league and the Sea gods.

Following this, Mera finally embraces her daughter, as she and Arthur settle down in Amnesty Bay. Soon afterwards, Mera and Arthur marry in the presence of their family and friends, in what was originally planned as a welcome back party for her.

Following the abolition of the monarchy, Arthur and Mera intended to hold themselves apart from Atlantis to allow the city to govern itself, but they were forced to intervene when the Frost King&#x27;s forces attacked the city during what was intended to be their honeymoon. Arthur journeyed into the city&#x27;s heating vents to meet with the Fire Trolls who lived in the tunnels below Atlantis, hoping they could be an ally against the Frost King. Originally Mera agreed to stay behind to guard Andy but quickly followed him, arriving in time to save Arthur from a Fire Troll with a hydrokinetic attack. The Trolls were in awe of this and swore loyalty to her. With her army of Fire Trolls, Mera and Arthur defeated the ice creatures attacking Atlantis.

===Arthur Joseph Curry===
Arthur Joseph Curry is the second DC Comics superhero to be known as Aquaman. Created by Kurt Busiek and Jackson Guice, he first appeared in &quot;Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis&quot; #40 (May 2006). As part of DC Comics&#x27;s &quot;One Year Later&quot; event, Aquaman&#x27;s series was renamed &quot;Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis&quot; with issue #40 (May 2006). The new developments included a new lead character, a new supporting cast, and the inclusion of sword and sorcery–type fantasy elements in the series. The character was short-lived. The character appears in comic books during a brief period (2006-2009) after which he is never seen, heard from, or mentioned again. 

In the &quot;Sword of Atlantis&quot; series, Arthur becomes acquainted with Aquaman&#x27;s supporting cast and rogue&#x27;s gallery, and learns of the cruel fate of the original Aquaman following &quot;52&quot;, who is now a cursed creature known as the Dweller of the Depths. It is later revealed Arthur was named after the original Aquaman by his father, oceanobiologist Dr. Phillip Curry (nephew of Orin&#x27;s father Tom Curry), who saved his life with an experimental procedure involving water from Aquaman&#x27;s mystical water hand. When Aquaman later exhausted his powers to save the city of Sub Diego, part of his soul latched onto Arthur Joseph Curry&#x27;s dead body, while Orin mutated into the Dweller. The younger Arthur then vowed to never use his &quot;stolen&quot; name again, going by Joseph instead of Arthur. He later makes scattered appearances in a few comic books, including &quot;Outsiders&quot; and &quot;Superman/Batman&quot;, but is not mentioned again in any comics following the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; crossover story, where Tempest finds Joseph&#x27;s trident and costume draped over a throne, confirming that he had abandoned his duties as king.

==Powers and abilities==
===Marine Telepathy===
Aquaman&#x27;s most widely recognized power is the ability to communicate with marine life, which he can summon from great distances. This was originally described in the stories as an ability to actually speak with fish (in a similar manner to Dr. Dolittle&#x27;s ability to speak to animals). This portrayal of his powers was later retconned into the ability to communicate with them telepathically. He once stated that this power more relied on encouraging and compelling the subject rather than full control, citing piranha as a species he has trouble commanding under any circumstances due to their ruthlessness and hunger.

In the &quot;New 52&quot; onwards, Aquaman&#x27;s telepathy abilities changed; acknowledging that most marine life does not possess enough intelligence to carry on a meaningful telepathic communication, Aquaman is now stated to simply add compulsions and needs in the mindset of aquatic life, compelling them to do his bidding by a subtle altering of their cerebellum. It is later revealed during &quot;Drowned Earth&quot; event that Arthur&#x27;s ability to speak with the ocean comes from a metaphysical energy known as the Life Force, a vast ocean of genesic power which enables him to connect with any and all forms of sentience within the cosmos, even from across realities. Through it, Arthur could also use its power to revert lost forms and assert varying consciousnesses within, like making the human shell of Mother Salt&#x27;s monster daughter, the Cailleach, subservient to her human host&#x27;s will; even restoring the true forms and divine powers of long-forgotten ocean gods while calling out to them through his aquatelepathy.

===Physical abilities===
The character has a number of other superhuman powers, most of which derive from the fact that he is adapted to live and thrive in the harshest of underwater environments. He has the ability to breathe underwater and possesses a superhuman physique strong enough to withstand attacks from superhuman opponents and resist machine gun fire. Aquaman frequently displays feats of super-Atlantean (the average Atlantean can lift/press approximately two tons) and superhuman strength. While not on par with Superman and Wonder Woman, he has proven capable of leaps up to six miles. He can swim at extremely high speeds, capable of reaching speeds of and can swim up Niagara Falls. He can see in near total darkness and has enhanced hearing, granting limited sonar.

Although Aquaman can remain underwater indefinitely without suffering any ill effects, he grows weak if he remains on land for extended periods. Originally, when Batman invented Aquaman&#x27;s water suit, he was able to walk on land for an indefinite amount of time and was no longer vulnerable to a &quot;dehumidifier&quot;. This weakness was later removed from continuity in 2011, establishing that he grew up on land before learning of his Atlantean heritage, but he still runs the risk of dying by dehydration within incredibly hostile environments, such as deserts. Aquaman had also been bestowed an ability he never showcased before, given to him by an old Sea Monarch, granting him the ability of unaided flight using his own power.

===Other powers and abilities===
While typically able to mostly telepathically commune with marine animals, Aquaman has at times demonstrated the ability to affect any being that lives upon the sea (e.g., sea eagles), or even any being evolved from marine life (e.g., humans and some aliens). Pre-Flashpoint Aquaman has had an ill-defined level of telekinetic capability he would use every so often. It&#x27;s very, very rarely touched upon and the only times he ever used it few and far between; often applying these abilities as a focus for team battles to strengthen combo attacks with other supers.

At various times in his life, Aquaman has been transformed into a purely oceanic entity with power over all the seas of the world, such as the &quot;Water Wraith&quot; and the &quot;Dweller in the Depths&quot;. This was usually temporary, as he would often revert to normal afterwards. 

Following DC&#x27;s 2024 &quot;Absolute Power&quot; event, Arthur is accidentally given his wife Mera&#x27;s hydrokinesis. She begins schooling him in how to use it in &quot;Aquaman&quot; (vol. 9) #1 (2025) as part of DC All In. Aquaman previously used hydrokinesis in his &quot;water hand&quot; era prior to One Year Later in 2006. Versions of Aquaman in other media possess this power naturally. For example, the original &quot;Superfriends&quot; Aquaman could create concussive &quot;water blasts&quot;, while the Aquaman who appeared as a recurring character in &quot;&quot; used water manipulation as his primary power.

===Weapons and equipment===
====Trident of Neptune====
Before &quot;The New 52&quot;, the Trident, granted by Poseidon to the rightful ruler and protector of the seas, was indestructible and a very powerful melee weapon, which Aquaman wielded with unmatched skill. Apart from its power as a melee weapon, the Trident also had the power to manipulate water, fire bolts of powerful energy and act as a focus to amplify the magical power of others, most notably Tempest.

In the &quot;New 52,&quot; the Trident of Neptune (also called Atlan&#x27;s Trident or the Trident of Atlan) is a weapon in which is part of a collection of seven very powerful Atlantean magical items, forged by the first king of Atlantis who calls himself &#x27;The Dead King&#x27;. initially thought to be the most powerful weapon of the set, with the possible exception of the recently discovered seventh item, the Trident is completely indestructible and able to hurt even the most powerful of opponents, such as the evil New God Darkseid. In one instance, the Trident was shown glowing with magical power when Black Manta used the rest of the items to discover the hidden seventh one. Sometimes when Arthur utilizes the Trident of Neptune&#x27;s supernatural powers, his eyes glow with arcane power and this further strengthens his abilities as well as giving him various arcane energy-based capabilities.

====Trident of Poseidon====
In the New 52 onwards, the trident in which is usually the favored weapon of Poseidon was given to Aquaman by the sea god. Poseidon&#x27;s trident has displayed the power to summon tsunamis and deluges, and call down thunder and lightning, project and control ice, move landmasses, and grant the ability for Aquaman to teleport himself across global and even interplanetary distances using water as a medium. It can also transform into a gladius (a type of sword used by ancient Roman gladiators) and back into a trident at will.

====Prosthetic hand====
After the loss of his left hand, Aquaman initially replaced it with a cybernetic retractable hook, then a liquid metal hand. The mechanical hand was replaced by a magical hand made out of water. His biological hand was restored when the character was resurrected in &quot;Blackest Night&quot; #8.

=====Waterbearer Hand=====
A magical hand made out of water, it was given to him by the Lady of the Lake, which granted Aquaman numerous abilities. These included: the ability to instantly dehydrate to death anyone he touched, shoot jets of scalding or freezing water from it, healing abilities, the ability to create portals into mystical dimensions that could act as spontaneous transport, control and negate magic, manipulate almost any body of water he sets his focus on and the capability to communicate with the Lady of the Lake.

==Other versions==
===Earth-Two===

In the 1960s following the establishment of DC Comics&#x27;s multiverse system, the Golden Age version of Aquaman became known as the Aquaman of Earth-Two, while the Silver Age version of Aquaman became the Aquaman of Earth-One. This Aquaman has the same history as his Golden Age counterpart. Although the two versions of Aquaman never met, the Earth-Two Aquaman did appear post-Golden Age in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #31 (March 1984) and #59–60 (July–August 1986). The Earth-Two version of the character was retroactively eliminated from existence via the 1985 &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; storyline.

===Earth-C-Minus===
The 1980s series &quot;Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!&quot; presented the parallel Earth of &quot;Earth-C-Minus&quot;, a world populated by anthropomorphic animal superheroes that paralleled the mainstream DC Universe. Earth-C-Minus featured Aquaduck, a duck version of Aquaman with similar powers.

===Supergirl: Wings===
Aquaman watches over the seas and his kingdom in the &quot;Supergirl: Wings&quot; Elseworlds story.

===Tangent Comics===
Arthur Curry appears in the 1997 Tangent Comics one-shot &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, in which he is revealed to be the son of the pilot Captain Boomerang, and a member of Boomerang&#x27;s fleet.

===Old Lady Harley===
Aquaman is the focus in a look into the future in &quot;Old Lady Harley&quot;. During a Joker attack on the Justice League, Aquaman and Lobo had pursued the villain. A simple accident has the Joker decapitated by Aquaman&#x27;s trident. Future Aquaman acts as a peacekeeper between America and Mexico, a meeting that goes well for all concerned.

===Earth-11===
In the &quot;Countdown&quot; tie-in issue &quot;The Search for Ray Palmer: Superwoman/Batwoman&quot;, a female version of Aquaman is shown to reside on Earth-11. This version is called &quot;Anne&quot;, is physically similar to Joseph Curry, and commands the armies of Atlantis. The Aquawoman of the slightly revised Earth-11 appears in &quot;The Multiversity&quot; #1 (2014) as one of the assembled heroes of the Multiverse who have come together to save it from destruction.

===JLA/Avengers===
In the 2003–04 intercompany crossover &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;, Aquaman teams up with the Avenger the Vision to investigate the changes to their respective Earths as a result of the actions of the Grandmaster. He displays his immense psychic control over sea life when he single-handedly shuts down the minds of Atlantean soldiers under the control of Attuma, although his abilities only partially affect Namor the Sub-Mariner, due to Namor&#x27;s half-human physiology.

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the 2011 &quot;Flashpoint&quot; storyline, Aquaman is brought back to Atlantis when he was a teenager, due to the death of his father. As a result, the young Arthur never learned compassion and kindness from his father, who was killed by the Atlantean agents sent to recover him. In the present day, Aquaman and all of Atlantis wage war against Wonder Woman and the Amazons, which began when Diana&#x27;s mother Hippolyta was killed on Aquaman and Diana&#x27;s wedding day. In an act of retribution, Wonder Woman later killed Mera, who had apparently married Aquaman. The death of Hippolyta was, however, revealed to be a casualty of war since the real target was Wonder Woman herself. Aquaman later caused Western Europe to sink into the sea, killing over 60 million people, and intends to sink England as well. In the present, Aquaman reassigns the Siren and the Ocean Master to assassinate Terra in New Themyscira. The mission fails, with the Siren being killed by Diana&#x27;s aunt, Penthesleia. The Amazonian Furies then attack the reinforcements led by Aquaman, who is confronted in battle by their leader, Wonder Woman. During their struggle, Wonder Woman tells him that they have both been deceived by the Ocean Master and Penthesileia, who are responsible for the war between the Atlanteans and the Amazons. This Aquaman returns in &quot;Convergence: Justice League&quot; #1.

===Injustice: Gods Among Us prequel===

In the prequel comic to the online video game &quot;&quot;, Aquaman appears to attack Japanese fisherman who killed a whale. He is intercepted by the Justice League, with it turning into a brawl between the Justice League and the Atlanteans. Superman, having undergone the death of his wife and unborn child and the destruction of Metropolis, threatens Aquaman to stop his efforts. While warned over a communication link with Batman not to test him, Aquaman does just that, summoning a kraken. In response Superman, Green Lantern, Shazam, and Wonder Woman lift the entire city of Atlantis off the sea floor and carry it to dry deserts, putting its inhabitants in harm as a way to bully Aquaman. He relents and, as a result of this, largely abstains from the conflict between the Regime (led by Superman) and the Insurgency (led by Batman). In Year Four, he gets involved when Batman informs him that the Greek gods have attempted to force their own rule over the world, so Aquaman and Mera take on Poseidon. He wins the conflict, as his wife stalls a massive tidal wave from crashing on Themiscyra. Superman comes to Atlantis in Year Five to ensure the Regime has Aquaman&#x27;s support, despite Aquaman having frequently made it clear he is not choosing sides. Aquaman agrees, purely to get Superman to leave.

===Earth-3===

During the 2013 &quot;Trinity War&quot; storyline, Aquaman&#x27;s Crime Syndicate counterpart is revealed to be The Sea King. He apparently fails to survive the passage from Earth-3 to Prime Earth, but is awakened in &quot;Forever Evil: Blight&quot; after being possessed by Deadman. The design of the Sea King resembles that of the 1990s Aquaman.

Within the live-action DC Extended Universe films, American actor Jason Momoa plays Aquaman, and the character made his feature film debut in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016). Momoa reprised the role in &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023) and starred in his own films &quot;Aquaman&quot; (2018) and &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&quot; (2023).

In 2023, the Aquaman: Power Wave roller coaster opened at Six Flags Over Texas.

== Reception and legacy ==
Aquaman was listed as the 147th-greatest comic book character of all time by &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine. IGN also ranked Aquaman as the 53rd-greatest comic book hero of all time, opining that &quot;even though he&#x27;ll forever be the butt of jokes thanks to his fishy powers, comic readers have come to love Aquaman as a noble (and very powerful) figure who is forever torn between the worlds of land and sea.&quot; In a 2011 reader poll, &quot;Parade&quot; magazine ranked Aquaman among the top 10 superheroes of all time.

By 2008, cultural critic Glen Weldon noted that Aquaman had become ridiculed by a popular mindset that cast him as an ineffectual hero. This was due to the perception that his heroic abilities were too narrow. Weldon wrote that critics and pop culture comedians who chose to focus on this had overplayed the joke, making it &quot;officially the hoariest, hackiest arrow in the quiver of pop-culture commentary.&quot;

<text>Parmesan (, ) is an Italian hard, granular cheese produced from cow&#x27;s milk and aged at least 12 months or, outside the European Union and Lisbon Agreement countries, a locally produced imitation. 

Parmigiano Reggiano is named after two of the areas which produce it, the Italian provinces of Parma and Reggio Emilia (&quot;Parmigiano&quot; is the Italian adjective for the city and province of Parma and &quot;Reggiano&quot; is the adjective for the province of Reggio Emilia); it is also produced in the part of Bologna west of the River Reno and in Modena (all of the above being located in the Emilia-Romagna region), as well as in the part of Mantua (Lombardy) on the south bank of the River Po. 

The names &quot;Parmigiano Reggiano&quot; and &quot;Parmesan&quot; are protected designations of origin (PDO) for cheeses produced in these provinces under Italian and European law. Outside the EU, the name &quot;Parmesan&quot; is legally used for similar cheeses, with only the full Italian name unambiguously referring to PDO Parmigiano Reggiano. However, a 2021 report found that in one group of PDO-protected cheeses, which included Parmigiano Reggiano, 90% of the cheeses sold in the US were produced domestically, rather than in the PDO-designated regions.

Parmigiano Reggiano has been called the &quot;king of cheeses&quot; and &quot;practically perfect food&quot;.

==Production==

Parmigiano Reggiano is made from unpasteurised cow&#x27;s milk. The whole milk of the morning milking is mixed with the naturally skimmed milk of the previous evening&#x27;s milking, resulting in a part skim mixture. This mixture is pumped into copper-lined vats, which heat evenly and contribute copper ions to the mix.
Starter whey (containing a mixture of certain thermophilic lactic acid bacteria) is added, and the temperature is raised to . Calf rennet is added, and the mixture is left to curdle for 10–12 minutes. The curd is then broken up mechanically into small pieces (around the size of rice grains). The temperature is then raised to with careful control by the cheese-maker. The curd is left to settle for 45–60 minutes. The compacted curd is collected in a piece of muslin before being divided in two and placed in molds. There are of milk per vat, producing two cheeses each. The curd making up each wheel at this point weighs around . The remaining whey in the vat was traditionally used to feed the pigs from which &quot;prosciutto di Parma&quot; was produced. The barns for these animals were usually just a few metres away from the cheese production rooms.
The cheese is put into a stainless steel, round form that is pulled tight with a spring-powered buckle so the cheese retains its wheel shape. After a day or two, the buckle is released and a plastic belt imprinted numerous times with the Parmigiano Reggiano name, the plant&#x27;s number, and month and year of production is put around the cheese, and the metal form is buckled tight again. The imprints take hold on the rind of the cheese in about a day and the wheel is then put into a brine bath to absorb salt for 20–25 days. After brining, the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for 12 months. Each cheese is placed on wooden shelves that can be 24 cheeses high by 90 cheeses long or 2,160 total wheels per aisle. Each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned every seven days, and the cheese is turned.

At 12 months, the () inspects every wheel. The cheese is tested by a master grader who taps each wheel to identify undesirable cracks and voids within the wheel. Wheels that pass the test are then heat-branded on the rind with the &quot;Consorzio&quot;&#x27;s logo. Those that do not pass the test used to have their rinds marked with lines or crosses all the way around to inform consumers that they are not getting top-quality Parmigiano Reggiano; more recent practices simply have these lesser rinds stripped of all markings.

Traditionally cows are fed only on grass or hay, producing grass-fed milk. Only natural whey culture is allowed as a starter, together with calf rennet.

The only additive allowed is salt, which the cheese absorbs while being submerged for 20 days in brine tanks saturated to near-total salinity with Mediterranean sea salt. The product ages for a minimum of one year and an average of two years; an expert from the &quot;Consorzio&quot; typically conducts a sound test with a hammer to determine if a wheel has finished maturing.

A typical Parmigiano Reggiano wheel is about high, in diameter, and weighs .

==Industry==

All producers of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese belong to the (), which was founded in 1928. Besides setting and enforcing the standards for the PDO, the &quot;Consorzio&quot; also sponsors marketing activities.

, about 3.6 million wheels (approx. 137,000 metric tons) of Parmesan are produced every year; they use about 18% of all the milk produced in Italy.

Most workers in the Italian dairy industry (&quot;bergamini&quot;) belong to the Italian General Confederation of Labour. As older dairy workers retire, younger Italians have tended to work in factories or offices. Immigrants have filled that role. In 2015, 60 percent of the workers in the Parmesan industry were immigrants from India, almost all Sikhs.

==Consumption==

Parmigiano Reggiano is commonly grated over pasta dishes, stirred into soups and risottos, and eaten on its own. It is often shaved or grated over other dishes such as salads. Slivers and chunks of the hardest parts of the crust (also called the rind) are sometimes simmered in soups, broths, and sauces to add flavor. They can also be broiled and eaten as a snack if they have no wax on them, or infused in olive oil or used in a steamer basket while steaming vegetables.

==History==
According to legend, Parmigiano Reggiano was created in the course of the Middle Ages in the &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of Bibbiano, in the province of Reggio Emilia. Its production soon spread to the Parma and Modena areas. Historical documents show that in the 13th and 14th centuries, Parmigiano was already very similar to that produced today, which suggests its origins can be traced to far earlier. Some evidence suggests that the name was used for Parmesan cheese in Italy and France in the 17th-19th century.

It was praised as early as 1348 in the writings of Boccaccio; in the &quot;Decameron&quot;, he invents a &#x27;mountain, all of grated Parmesan cheese&#x27;, on which &#x27;dwell folk that do nought else but make macaroni and ravioli, and boil them in capon&#x27;s broth, and then throw them down to be scrambled for; and hard by flows a rivulet of Vernaccia, the best that ever was drunk, and never a drop of water therein&#x27;.

During the Great Fire of London of 1666, Samuel Pepys buried his &quot;Parmazan cheese, as well as his wine and some other things&quot; to preserve them.

In the memoirs of Giacomo Casanova, he remarked that the name &quot;Parmesan&quot; was a misnomer common throughout an &quot;ungrateful&quot; Europe in his time (mid-18th century), as the cheese was produced in the &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of Lodi, in Lombardy, not Parma. Though Casanova knew his table and claimed in his memoir to have been compiling a (never completed) dictionary of cheeses, his comment has been taken to refer mistakenly to a grana cheese similar to Parmigiano, Grana Padano, which is produced in the Lodi area.

Parmigiano Reggiano has been the target of organized crime in Italy, particularly the Mafia or Camorra, which ambush delivery trucks on the Autostrada A1, in northern Italy, between Milan and Bologna, hijacking shipments. The cheese is ultimately sold in southern Italy. Between November 2013 and January 2015, an organised crime gang stole 2039 wheels of Parmigiano Reggiano from warehouses in northern and central Italy. Some banks will accept Parmesan cheese as collateral for a loan.

October 27 is designated &quot;Parmigiano Reggiano Day&quot; by The Consortium of Parmigiano Reggiano. This day celebrating the &quot;king of cheeses&quot; originated in response to the two earthquakes hitting the area of origin in May 2012. The devastation was profound, displacing tens of thousands of residents, collapsing factories, and damaging historical churches, bell towers, and other landmarks. Years of cheese production were lost during the disaster, about $50 million worth. To assist the cheese producers, Modena native chef Massimo Bottura created the recipe &quot;riso cacio e pepe&quot;. He invited the world to cook this new dish along with him launching &quot;Parmigiano Reggiano Day&quot;—October 27.

==Aroma and chemical components==

Parmigiano Reggiano has many aroma-active compounds, including various aldehydes and butyrates. Butyric acid and isovaleric acid together are sometimes used to imitate the dominant aromas.

Parmigiano Reggiano is also particularly high in glutamate, containing as much as 1.2 g of glutamate per 100 g of cheese. The high concentration of glutamate explains the strong umami taste of Parmigiano Reggiano.

Parmigiano Reggiano cheese typically contains cheese crystals, semi-solid to gritty crystalline spots that at least partially consist of the amino acid tyrosine.

==Definitions==
The name is legally protected in the European Union and, in Italy, exclusive control is exercised over the cheese&#x27;s production and sale by The Consortium of Parmigiano Reggiano, which was created by a governmental decree. Each wheel must meet strict criteria early in the aging process, when the cheese is still soft and creamy, to merit the official seal and be placed in storage for aging. Because it is widely imitated, Parmigiano Reggiano has become an increasingly regulated product, and in 1955 it became what is known as a certified name (which is not the same as a brand name). In 2008, an EU court determined that the name &quot;Parmesan&quot; in Europe only refers to Parmigiano Reggiano and cannot be used for imitation Parmesan. Thus, in the European Union, Parmigiano Reggiano is a protected designation of origin (PDO); legally, the name refers exclusively to the Parmigiano Reggiano PDO cheese manufactured in a limited area in northern Italy. Special seals identify the product as authentic, with the identification number of the dairy, the production month and year, a code identifying the individual wheel, and stamps regarding the length of aging.

==Non-European Parmesan cheese==
Parmesan cheese made outside of the European Union is a family of hard-grating cheeses made from cow&#x27;s milk and inspired by the original Italian cheese. They are generally pale yellow in color and usually used grated on dishes such as pasta, Caesar salad, and pizza. Some American generic Parmesan is sold already grated and has been aged for less than 12 months. 

Within the European Union, the term &quot;Parmesan&quot; may only be used, by law, to refer to Parmigiano Reggiano itself, which must be made in a restricted geographic area, using stringently defined methods. In many areas outside Europe the name &quot;Parmesan&quot; has become genericised and may denote any of several hard Italian-style grating types of cheese. These cheeses, chiefly from the US and Argentina, are often commercialised under names intended to evoke the original, such as Parmesan, Parmigiana, Parmesana, Parmabon, Real Parma, Parmezan, or Parmezano. After the European ruling that &quot;parmesan&quot; could not be used as a generic name, Kraft Foods renamed its grated cheese &quot;Pamesello&quot; in Europe.

===Non-European production===
Parmesan cheese is defined differently in various jurisdictions outside of Europe. In the United States, the &quot;Code of Federal Regulations&quot; includes a Standard of Identity for &quot;Parmesan and Reggiano cheese&quot;. This defines both aspects of the production process and of the final result. In particular, Parmesan must be made of cow&#x27;s milk, cured for 10 months or more, contain no more than 32% water, and have no less than 32% milkfat in its solids. Similarly, the Canadian regulation only defines moisture and fat levels, with no restriction on aging time.

Kraft Foods is a major North American producer of grated Parmesan and has been selling it since 1945. Many Wisconsin cheesemakers, some founded by Italian immigrants, produce Parmesan in whole wheels.

Several non-European Parmesan producers have taken strong exception to the attempts of the European Union to globally control the trademark of the Parmesan name, claiming that it is more about control of trade than control of quality.

===Adulteration controversy===
Several American manufacturers have been investigated for allegedly going beyond the 4% cellulose limit (allowed as an anticaking agent for grated cheese, 21 CFR 133.146). In one case, FDA findings found &quot;no Parmesan cheese was used to manufacture&quot; a Pennsylvania manufacturer&#x27;s grated cheese labeled &quot;Parmesan&quot;, apparently made from a mixture of other cheeses and cellulose. The manufacturer pleaded guilty and received a sentence of three years&#x27; probation, a $5,000 fine, and 200 hours of community service.

==Similar cheeses==
===Grana Padano===
Grana Padano is an Italian cheese similar to Parmigiano Reggiano, but is produced mainly in Lombardy, where &quot;Padano&quot; refers to the Po Valley (&quot;Pianura Padana&quot;); the cows producing the milk may be fed silage as well as grass; the milk may contain slightly less fat, milk from several different days may be used, and must be aged a minimum of 9 months.

===Reggianito===

Reggianito is an Argentine cheese similar to Parmigiano Reggiano. Developed by Italian Argentine cheesemakers, the cheese is made in smaller wheels and aged for less time but is otherwise broadly similar.

<text>Christopher Polhammar (18 December 1661 – 30 August 1751) better known as Christopher Polhem (), which he took after his ennoblement in 1716, was a Swedish scientist, inventor, and industrialist. He made significant contributions to the economic and industrial development of Sweden, particularly mining. He was ennobled by King Charles XII of Sweden for his contributions to Swedish technological development.

==Biography==
Polhem (Polhammar) was born on the island of Gotland in the village of Tingstäde, north-east of Visby. Originally, the Polhem family came from Hungary, where they were established latest in the 14th century of possible Austrian descent.

Polhem&#x27;s father, Wolf Christoph Polhammer, born in Hungary to a baron, moved from Hungary to Swedish Pomerania because the Austrian catholics had the then predominantly protestant Hungarians under religious persecution. Wolf Polhammer traded with Visby. He would eventually settle down to become a skipper.

Christopher Polhammar attended a German language school in Stockholm until the age of 8 when his father died. His mother, Christina Eriksdotter Schening, who was from Vadstena in Östergötland, later remarried. Because of conflicts with his stepfather, his private tuition was no longer paid and Polhem was sent to live with his uncle in Stockholm.

He took a job as a farmhand on Vansta, a property in Södertörn, Stockholm. Quickly, he rose to the position of supervisor, being responsible for supervision and accounting, for which he was well suited by his affinity for mathematics. He worked at Vansta for ten years, during which period he constructed a workshop where he made tools, repaired and constructed simple machinery to earn money.

Hungering for knowledge within his fields of interest, mathematics and mechanics, he soon realized that he would get no further without learning Latin. Self-studies were attempted, but given up; Polhem realized he needed a tutor. In exchange for constructing a complex clock, he was given Latin lessons by a local vicar.

Word of Polhem&#x27;s mechanical skill spread quickly and a member of the clergy wrote to Anders Spole, professor of mathematics at Uppsala University to recommend Polhem. Anders Spole, grandfather of Anders Celsius, presented two broken clocks to Polhem and offered to let him study under him if he could repair them. Polhem repaired the clocks with no difficulty and in 1687, entered the University of Uppsala at the age of 26.

==Personal life==
Polhem married Maria Hoffman (1671–1735) on 28 December 1691. Together they had 8 children between 1692 and 1705.

In 1716, he was ennobled by King Charles XII of Sweden in gratitude of his services to the nation by the king and changed his surname from &quot;Polhammar&quot; to &quot;Polheim&quot;, which he later shortened to &quot;Polhem&quot;.

He and his son Gabriel Polhem (1700–1772) were both elected members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1739, the same year the academy was founded.

Polhem died of natural causes in 1751 in Stockholm, at the age of 90.

== Career ==
=== Industrial ===
According to Polhem&#x27;s autobiography, the event that marked the beginning of his career was the successful repair of the unfinished medieval (16th century) astronomical clock designed by Petrus Astronomus at Uppsala Cathedral, which had remained unfinished and broken for more than a century.

In 1690 Polhem was appointed to improve upon the current mining operations of Sweden. His contribution was a construction for lifting and transporting ore from mines, a process that was rather risky and inefficient at the time. The construction consisted of a track system for lifting the ore, as opposed to wires; the construction was powered entirely by a water wheel. Human labor needed was limited to loading the containers. Being new and revolutionary, word of Polhem&#x27;s work reached King Charles XI of Sweden who was so impressed with the work that he assigned him to improve Sweden&#x27;s main mining operation; the Falun Mine in Dalarna.

Funded by the Swedish mining authority, Polhem traveled throughout Europe, studying mechanical development. He returned to Sweden in 1697 to establish &quot;laboratorium mechanicum&quot; in Stockholm, a facility for the training of engineers, as well as a laboratory for testing and exhibiting his designs. It has since become the prestigious KTH Royal Institute of Technology, whose history began with Charles XI and his praise for Polhem for his mining efforts.

His greatest achievement was an automated factory powered entirely by water; automation was very unusual at the time. Built in 1699 in Stjärnsund, the factory produced a number of products including manufacture of knives, locks and clocks. Development of the factory was derived from the idea that Sweden should export fewer raw materials and instead process them within their own borders. 
The factory met great resistance among workers who feared they would be replaced by machinery. Eventually most of the factory was destroyed in a fire in 1734, leaving only the part of the factory that produced clocks. The factory continued producing clocks, known for their high quality and low price. Although the popularity of the clocks diminished during the beginning of the 19th century, clock-making continues to this day at Stjärnsund, still producing around twenty clocks of the Polhem design per year.

Another product from the factory was the &quot;Polhem locks&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Polhemslås&quot;), essentially the first design of the variation of padlocks common today. Economically, the factory was unfeasible, but the king at the time, Charles XII, was supportive and gave Polhem freedom from taxes to encourage his efforts. The factory of Stjärnsund was visited by one of his contemporaries, Carl Linnaeus, who wrote about the factory in his diaries as &quot;Nothing is more optimistic than Stjärnsund&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Intet är spekulativare än Stjärnsund&quot;).

Polhem also contributed to the construction of Göta Canal, a canal connecting the east and west coasts of Sweden. Together with Charles XII of Sweden, he planned the construction of parts of the canal, particularly the canal locks in the 18th century; it was not to be finished until 1832, long after his death.

Other major contributions made by Polhem were the constructions of dry docks, dams, and canal locks, which he designed together with his assistant and friend, Emanuel Swedenborg.
===Other fields===
Polhem was not only active within the field of mechanics, he actively wrote essays concerning medicine, social criticism, astronomy, geology, and economics.

===Curiosa===
One ancestor to Béla Bartók, on his mother&#x27;s side was Rozália Pallheim.

<text>Akai (, ) is a consumer electronics manufacturer based in Hong Kong. It was established as Akai Electric Company Ltd in Tokyo, Japan, in 1946.

After the controversial collapse of the original business in 2000, the Akai brand came under the ownership of Grande Holdings in Hong Kong. The company now distributes a range of electronic products, including LED TVs, washing machines, clothes dryers, air conditioners, and smartphones. These products are developed through collaborations with other electronics companies with relevant expertise.

The &quot;Akai Professional&quot; electronic instrument division was spun off in 1999 and operates under separate ownership from the main &quot;Akai&quot; brand.

==Corporate history==
Akai was founded by Masukichi Akai and his son, Saburo Akai (who died in 1973), as , a Japanese manufacturer, in 1929. Some sources, however, suggest the company was established in 1946.

The company&#x27;s business eventually became disorganized, and it exited the audio industry in 1991. At its peak in the late 1990s, Akai Holdings employed 100,000 workers and had annual sales of HK$40 billion (US$5.2 billion). The company filed for insolvency in November 2000, owing creditors US$1.1 billion. It emerged that ownership of Akai Holdings had passed to Grande Holdings in 1999, a company founded by Akai&#x27;s chairman James Ting. The liquidators claimed that Ting had stolen over US$800 million from the company with the assistance of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, who had tampered with audit documents dating back to 1994. Ting was imprisoned for false accounting in 2005, and E&amp;Y paid $200 million to settle the negligence case out of court in September 2009. In a separate lawsuit, a former E&amp;Y partner, Christopher Ho, made a &quot;substantial payment&quot; to Akai creditors in his role as chairman of Grande Holdings.

The &quot;Akai Professional&quot; division, specializing in electronic instruments, became a separate business in 1999. It was acquired in 2005 by businessman Jack O&#x27;Donnell (later becoming a part of his inMusic Brands group) and is no longer associated with the main &quot;Akai&quot; brand.

==History==

===Historical products===
Akai&#x27;s products included reel-to-reel audiotape recorders (such as the GX series), tuners (top-level AT, mid-level TR and TT series), audio cassette decks (top-level GX and TFL, mid-level TC, HX, and CS series), amplifiers (AM and TA series), microphones, receivers, turntables, video recorders, and loudspeakers.
Many Akai products were sold under the name Roberts in the U.S., as well as A&amp;D in Japan (from 1987, following a partnership with Mitsubishi Electric), Tensai, and &quot;Transonic Strato&quot; in Western Europe. During the late 1960s, Akai adopted Tandberg&#x27;s cross-field recording technologies (using an extra tape head) to enhance high-frequency recording and later switched to the increasingly reliable Glass and Crystal (X&#x27;tal) (GX) ferrite heads. The company&#x27;s most popular products included the GX-630D, GX-635D, GX-747/GX-747DBX, and GX-77 open-reel recorders (the latter featuring an auto-loading function), the three-head, closed-loop GX-F95, GX-90, GX-F91, GX-R99 cassette decks, and the AM-U61, AM-U7, and AM-93 stereo amplifiers.

Akai manufactured and badged most of its imported hi-fi products under the Tensai brand (named after the Swiss audio and electronics distributor Tensai International). Tensai International served as Akai&#x27;s exclusive distributor for the Swiss and Western European markets until 1988.

Akai limited its consumer hi-fi product line in the United States and Europe toward the end of the 20th century.

====Introduction of the on-screen display====
Akai produced consumer video cassette recorders (VCRs) during the mid-1980s. The Akai VS-2 was the first VCR to feature an on-screen display, originally named the Interactive Monitor System. By displaying information directly on the television screen, this innovation eliminated the need for the user to be physically near the VCR to program recordings, read the tape counter, or perform other common functions. Within a few years, all competing manufacturers had adopted on-screen display technology in their own products.

===Akai Professional===
 
In 1984, a new division of the company was formed to focus on the manufacture and sale of electronic instruments, and was called Akai Professional.

The first product released by the new subsidiary was the MG1212, a 12-channel, 12-track recorder. This innovative device used a specialized VHS-like cartridge (the MK-20) and could record 10 minutes of continuous 12-track audio at 19 cm per second or 20 minutes at half speed (9.5 cm per second). One track (14) was permanently dedicated to recording absolute time, and another for synchronization such as SMPTE or MTC. Each channel strip included dbx type-1 noise reduction and semi-parametric equalizers (with fixed bandwidths). The unit also featured innovations like an electronic 2-bus system, a 12-stereo channel patch bay, and automatic punch in and out capabilities, among others. The unique transport design and noise reduction gave these units a recording quality that rivaled more expensive 16-track machines using 1&quot; tape. The MG-1212 was later succeeded by the MG-1214, which improved the transport mechanism and overall performance.

====AX series analog synthesizers====

Other early products included the Akai AX80 8-voice analog synthesizer in 1984, followed by the AX60 and AX73 6-voice analog synthesizers around 1986. The AX-60 borrowed many design elements from the Roland Juno series, but used voltage-controlled analog oscillators (VCO) as its sound source, unlike Roland&#x27;s more common digitally controlled analog oscillators (DCO). It also allowed the performer to &quot;split&quot; the keyboard, assigning different timbres to different ranges of keys. The AX-60 featured the ability to interface with Akai&#x27;s early samplers via a serial cable, using 12-bit samples as an additional oscillator.

====Digital Samplers (S, X, Z series)====


The S612 12-bit digital sampler released in 1985 was the first in a series of relatively affordable samplers, designed in a 19-inch studio-rack format and finished in black. It could hold only a single sample at a time, which was loaded into memory via a separate disk drive utilizing 2.8-inch Quick Disk floppy disks. The maximum sample time at the highest quality sampling rate (32 kHz) was one second.



The introduction of a &quot;professional&quot; range of digital samplers began with the 12-bit S900 in 1986, followed by the X7000 keyboard sampler in 1986, and the S700 rack-mount version in 1987. Unlike the single-sample S612, these models allowed the use of up to six active samples simultaneously, featured a built-in disk drive, and could be extended with six individual outputs via cable. Additionally, a flash memory extension added another six samples to the memory for multisample playback. The S700/X7000 sampler series were light grey in color, a design choice that remained consistent throughout the entire &quot;professional&quot; range of Akai samplers.

The 16-bit Akai S1000 series followed in 1988, introducing the ability to read CD-ROMs and write to hard disks via SCSI. This range was eventually superseded by the S3000 series in 1993, which offered an optional built-in CD-ROM drive, followed by the S5000 and S6000 models. Additional notable releases included the Z4 and Z8 24-bit 96 kHz samplers.

====MPC====

Akai also produced several Digital MIDI sequencers and digital synthesizers such as the MPC range, a line of integrated drum machines, MIDI sequencers, samplers and direct-to-disk recorders.

====New ownership of Akai Professional====
In December 1999, one year before the application of the to Akai Electric Company Ltd., the brand of its musical instrument division, Akai Professional, was acquired by a company based in the United States. The new company was named &quot;Akai Professional Musical Instrument Corporation&quot;. Akai Professional M.I. was established the same year, but it filed for bankruptcy in 2005.

In 2004, following a US distribution deal, the Akai Professional Musical Instrument division was acquired by Jack O&#x27;Donnell, owner of Numark Industries and Alesis. In 2012, inMusic Brands was formed as the parent company for O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s companies, including Akai Professional.

==Current products==
In early 2003, Grande Holdings began reintroducing Akai&#x27;s brands by marketing various audio-visual products manufactured by Samsung. In the same year, Grande started distributing Akai home appliances, including air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, and refrigerators. In the 2010s, it began distributing Akai smartphones in collaboration with Chinese smartphone manufacturers such as Gionee, in India and other countries.

<doc id="304684" wikidata="Q227690" url="?curid=304684" title="Agaricus bisporus">
<text>Agaricus bisporus, commonly known as the cultivated mushroom, is a basidiomycete mushroom native to grasslands in Eurasia and North America. It is cultivated in more than 70 countries and is one of the most commonly and widely consumed mushrooms in the world. It has two color states while immature – white and brown – both of which have various names, with additional names for the mature state, such as chestnut, portobello, portabellini, button and champignon de Paris.

&quot;A. bisporus&quot; has some deadly poisonous lookalikes in the wild, such as &quot;Entoloma sinuatum&quot;.

==Description==
The pileus or cap of the original wild species is a pale grey-brown, with broad, flat scales on a paler background and fading toward the margins. It is first hemispherical before flattening out with maturity, and measures
 in diameter. The narrow, crowded gills are free and initially pink, then red-brown, and finally a dark brown with a whitish edge from the cheilocystidia. The cylindrical stipe is up to tall by wide and bears a thick and narrow ring, which may be streaked on the upper side. The firm flesh is white, although it stains a pale pinkish-red on bruising. The spore print is dark brown. The spores are oval to round and measure approximately 4.5–5.5 μm × 5–7.5 μm, and the basidia usually two-spored, although two four-spored varieties have been described from the Mojave Desert and the Mediterranean, with predominantly heterothallic and homothallic lifestyles, respectively.

===Similar species===
The common mushroom could be confused with young specimens of a group of lethal mushrooms in the &quot;Amanita&quot; genus referred to as destroying angels, but the latter may be distinguished by their volva or cup at the base of the mushroom and pure white gills (as opposed to pinkish or brown of &quot;A. bisporus&quot;).

A more common and less dangerous mistake is to confuse &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot; with &quot;A. xanthodermus&quot;, an inedible mushroom found worldwide in grassy areas. &quot;A. xanthodermus&quot; has an odor reminiscent of phenol; its flesh turns yellow when bruised. This fungus causes nausea and vomiting in some people.

The poisonous European species &quot;Entoloma sinuatum&quot; has a passing resemblance but has yellowish gills, turning pink, and lacks a ring.

==Taxonomy==
The common mushroom has a complicated taxonomic history. It was first described by English botanist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in his 1871 &quot;Handbook of British Fungi&quot;, as a variety (var. &quot;hortensis&quot;) of &quot;Agaricus campestris&quot;. Danish mycologist Jakob Emanuel Lange later reviewed a cultivar specimen, and dubbed it &quot;Psalliota hortensis&quot; var. &quot;bispora&quot; in 1926. In 1938, it was promoted to species status and renamed &quot;Psalliota bispora&quot;. Emil Imbach (1897–1970) imparted the current scientific name of the species, &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot; after the genus &quot;Psalliota&quot; was renamed to &quot;Agaricus&quot; in 1946. The specific epithet &quot;bispora&quot; distinguishes the two-spored basidia from four-spored varieties.
=== Names ===
When immature and , this mushroom may be known as:
* common mushroom
* white mushroom 
* button mushroom 
* cultivated mushroom
* table mushroom
* champignon (French for mushroom) de Paris
When immature and , it may be known variously as:
* Swiss brown mushroom
* Roman brown mushroom
* Italian brown mushroom
* cremini (also crimini) mushroom
* chestnut mushroom (not to be confused with &quot;Pholiota adiposa&quot;)
* baby bella

When marketed in its mature state, the mushroom is brown with a cap measuring . This form is commonly sold under the names portobello, portabella, or portobella. The etymology is disputed.

==Distribution and habitat==
This mushroom is commonly found worldwide in fields and grassy areas following rain, from late spring to autumn, especially in association with manure.

==Cultivation==
===Production===
In 2022, world production of mushrooms (including truffles) was 48 million tonnes, led by China with 94% of the total (table). Japan and the United States were secondary producers. 

===History===
The earliest scientific description of the commercial cultivation of &quot;A. bisporus&quot; was made by French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in 1707. French agriculturist Olivier de Serres noted that transplanting mushroom mycelia would lead to the propagation of more mushrooms.

Originally, cultivation was unreliable as mushroom growers would watch for good flushes of mushrooms in fields before digging up the mycelium and replanting them in beds of composted manure or inoculating &#x27;bricks&#x27; of compressed litter, loam, and manure. Spawn collected this way contained pathogens, and crops would be infected or not grow. In 1893, sterilized, or pure culture, spawn was discovered and produced by the Pasteur Institute in Paris for cultivation on composted horse manure.

Modern commercial varieties of the common agaricus mushroom were originally light brown. The white mushroom was discovered in 1925 growing among a bed of brown mushrooms at the Keystone Mushroom Farm in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Louis Ferdinand Lambert, the farm&#x27;s owner and a mycologist by training, brought the white mushroom back to his laboratory. As with the reception of white bread, it was seen as a more attractive food item and became grown and distributed. Similar to the commercial development history of the navel orange and Red Delicious apple, cultures were grown from the mutant individuals. Most cream-colored store mushrooms marketed today are products of this 1925 chance natural mutation.

&quot;A. bisporus&quot; is cultivated in at least seventy countries worldwide.

==Nutrition==
&quot;A. bisporus&quot; mushrooms are 92% water, 3% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and contain negligible fat (table).

In a reference amount of , raw white mushrooms provide of food energy and are an excellent source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of the B vitamins riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid (table). Fresh mushrooms are also a good source (10–19% DV) of the dietary minerals phosphorus and potassium (table).

While fresh &quot;A. bisporus&quot; only contains 0.2 micrograms (8 IU) of vitamin D per 100 g, the ergocalciferol (D2) content increases substantially to 11.2 micrograms (446 IU) after exposure to UV light.

<doc id="304686" wikidata="Q3035912" url="?curid=304686" title="Don Sutton">
<text>Donald Howard Sutton (April 2, 1945 – January 19, 2021) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played 23 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Sutton won a total of 324 games, pitched 58 shutouts including five one-hitters and ten two-hitters, and led the National League in walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) four times. He is seventh on baseball&#x27;s all-time strikeout list with 3,574.

Sutton was born in Clio, Alabama. He attended high school and community college in Florida before entering professional baseball. After a year in the minor leagues, Sutton joined the Dodgers. Beginning in 1966, he was in the team&#x27;s starting pitching rotation with Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, and Claude Osteen. Sixteen of Sutton&#x27;s 23 MLB seasons were spent with the Dodgers. He spent much of the 1980s with the Houston Astros, the Milwaukee Brewers, the Oakland Athletics and the California Angels, before returning for a second stint with the Dodgers. He registered only one 20-win season, but earned 10 or more wins in every season except 1983 and 1988.

Sutton became a television sports broadcaster after his retirement as a player. He worked in this capacity for several teams, the majority being with the Atlanta Braves. Sutton was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998.

==Early life==
Sutton was born in Clio, Alabama, a small town in Barbour County, on April 2, 1945, the same day as future Dodger teammate Reggie Smith. He was born to sharecroppers at the end of World War II, in a tarpaper shack. At the time Sutton was born, his father was 18 and his mother was 15. Sutton&#x27;s father, Howard, gave him the strong work ethic which he carried throughout his career. His father tried logging and construction work, and in looking for work, moved the family to Molino, Florida, just north of Pensacola. Sutton and his family were Evangelical Christians.

Sutton attended J. M. Tate High School where he played baseball, basketball, and football. He led his baseball team to the small-school state finals two years in row, winning his junior year, 1962, and losing 2–1 in his senior year, and was named all-county, all-conference, and all-state for both of those seasons. He graduated in 1963 and was voted &quot;Most Likely to Succeed&quot;. He wanted to attend the University of Florida, but coach Dave Fuller was not interested. He attended Gulf Coast Community College, Panama City for one year, and then Whittier College. After a good summer league, he was signed by the Dodgers.

==Baseball career==

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
After playing for the Sioux Falls Packers in South Dakota, Sutton entered the major leagues at 21. His major league debut came with the Dodgers on April 14, 1966. On the 1966 Dodgers, Sutton was the fourth starting pitcher in a rotation that included Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, and Claude Osteen. He later said that the &quot;best thing that could have happened to me was to join a team with Drysdale and Koufax. They were obviously helpful to me as a pitcher.&quot; He struck out 209 batters that season, which was the highest strikeout total for a rookie since 1911. Sutton was passed over in Game 4 of the 1966 World Series, giving Drysdale a second start. Though the Baltimore Orioles did start a rookie in the World Series, future Hall of Famer, Jim Palmer, Sutton did not pitch and the Dodgers were swept in four games by the Orioles.

Sutton was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game four times in the 1970s. The 1974 Dodgers made the postseason after winning 102 games during the regular season. They defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the playoffs and Sutton accounted for two of the team&#x27;s three wins. They lost the 1974 World Series four games to one, with Sutton earning the only win for the team. In 1976, Sutton had his best major league season, finishing the year with a 21–10 win–loss record. He was the National League&#x27;s starting pitcher and MVP of the 1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium. He earned a complete game win in the 1977 playoffs, followed by a 1–0 record in two appearances in that year&#x27;s World Series, which the team lost to the Yankees.

In August 1978, Sutton captured media attention after a physical altercation with teammate Steve Garvey. Sutton had criticized what he thought was excessive media attention paid to Garvey, saying that Reggie Smith was really the team&#x27;s best player. When Garvey confronted Sutton about the comments before a game against the Mets, they fought and had to be separated by teammates and team officials. The team returned to the postseason that year. Sutton had a 15–11 record during the regular season, but he struggled in the postseason as the Dodgers lost the World Series to New York again. In 17 postseason innings that year, Sutton gave up 14 earned runs.

===Later career===
Los Angeles made Sutton a free agent after the 1980 season. During his time in Los Angeles, he set a team record for career wins.

Sutton was selected by ten teams in the 1980 free agent re-entry draft. He was courted by both the Yankees and Astros but ultimately selected Houston. One factor in Houston&#x27;s favor was that Sutton would be able to play in the pitcher-friendly Astrodome.

After the 1981 player strike interrupted the season, Sutton returned with seven wins and one loss. In an October 2 loss to the Dodgers, Sutton left the game with a patellar fracture, ending his season just as the Astros were about to clinch a berth in the NL postseason.

Prior to the 1982 season, Sutton expressed a desire to return to play in Southern California, where he continued to live. The team did not grant his request and, in August, the Astros sent Sutton to the Milwaukee Brewers for Kevin Bass, Frank DiPino, and Mike Madden. Astros player Ray Knight was critical of the trade, saying, &quot;My first reaction to this trade is disbelief. I don&#x27;t know who are the prospects we are getting, but I would think Don Sutton would bring a big name, a real big name. Here&#x27;s a guy who is going to win you 15–20 games every year, and he never misses a start... He should really help the Brewers.&quot; Sutton earned a win in a 1982 playoff game against the Angels, then started two games in the 1982 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He pitched 10 innings in the series, gave up nine earned runs and was charged with one loss.

In 1983, Sutton had a down year for the Brewers, notching only 8 wins, his lowest full season total to date, and having an ERA of 4.08, the second highest of his career. His record and ERA improved in 1984 to 14–12 and 3.77.

In 1985, Sutton was traded to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for Ray Burris. He was reluctant to report to the team, as he was hoping to play for a team in Southern California so that he could live at home with his family. Sutton ultimately reported to Oakland 12 days late for spring training. He said that he had his family&#x27;s approval in the decision and he mentioned his win total – he was 20 wins shy of 300 career wins – as a factor in the decision. After starting the season with a 13–8 record, Sutton was traded to the California Angels in September. In return, the Angels would send two minor league players to be named later to Oakland, Robert Sharpnack and Jerome Nelson.
Coming into the 1986 season, Sutton had 295 career victories. He struggled early in the season, recording a 9.12 ERA in his first five starts, but earned his 300th career win on June 18, pitching a complete game against the Texas Rangers in which he allowed only three hits and one run while striking out Gary Ward for the final out of the game. He appeared in two games in the 1986 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, earning a 1.86 ERA but registering two no-decisions.

Sutton signed with the Dodgers again in 1988. Before the 1988 season began, Angels pitcher John Candelaria criticized him for tipping off police that Candelaria was drinking the previous year, leading to one of Candelaria&#x27;s two 1987 drunk driving arrests. Sutton said that he made the report out of concern for Candelaria&#x27;s safety; Candelaria said that Sutton was practicing &quot;self-preservation&quot; and attempting to have Candelaria removed from the Angels&#x27; starting rotation since Sutton was not pitching well.

In August 1988, Sutton spoke with Astros team leadership about a vacant assistant general manager position with the team. Dodgers executive vice president Fred Claire said that Sutton violated league rules by discussing such a position while under contract with a team, but Sutton said that he ran into Astros general manager Bill Wood at a game and simply mentioned his willingness to discuss the position later. The team released him on August 10. Claire said that Sutton&#x27;s stamina was a major consideration in the move, as the team was looking for pitchers who could last more than five or six innings per start.

Sutton holds the record for most at-bats without a home run (1,354). Sutton retains another record: seven times he pitched nine scoreless innings but got a no-decision. He also holds the major league record for most consecutive losses to one team (13 to the Chicago Cubs). Sutton also holds the Dodger franchise record for wins (233) and held the strikeouts record (2,696) for 42 years until he was passed by Clayton Kershaw in 2022.

As a hitter, Sutton was about average as pitchers go, posting a .144 batting average (195-for-1354) with 64 runs batted in and 60 walks. Defensively, he was above average, recording a .968 fielding percentage which was 15 points higher than the league average at his position.

==Broadcasting career==
Sutton started his broadcasting career in 1989, splitting duties between Dodgers cable telecasts on Z Channel and Atlanta Braves telecasts on TBS.

The following year, he became a full-time commentator for the Braves. In 2002, Sutton was diagnosed with kidney cancer resulting in the removal of his left kidney. In addition, part of his lung was removed in 2003. While undergoing cancer treatment, he continued his broadcasting career. He left TBS after the 2006 season, mainly because the network would broadcast fewer games in 2007 and had to cut back on the number of broadcasters.

Sutton was a color commentator for the Washington Nationals on the MASN network during the 2007 and 2008 seasons. After the end of the 2008 season, Sutton still had two years left on his contract with the Nationals, but when an Atlanta Braves radio job opened up, he negotiated his release on January 27, 2009, in order to return to Atlanta, where he had many ties. His most recent broadcast partner was Jim Powell, who joined the Braves Radio Network in 2009. Sutton missed the 2019 season due to a broken femur. He was unable to return to his broadcast career before his death.

==Honors==
In 1997, Sutton appeared on the National Baseball Hall of Fame ballot for the fourth time. Sutton had previously expressed his desire to be elected to the Hall of Fame. However, when he fell nine votes short of election that year, he said that the vote was not that important. When he received the results of the vote, his two-month-old daughter Jacqueline was in an Atlanta neonatal intensive care unit after she was born 16 weeks early. His daughter later recovered. On the 1998 ballot, Sutton became the only player selected for induction, receiving votes on 81.6% of ballots. The Dodgers retired his number that year.

Sutton was inducted into the Braves Hall of Fame in July 2015 for his work as a broadcaster. He became the fourth Braves broadcaster to be honored in this fashion, joining his mentors Ernie Johnson, Skip Caray, and Pete Van Wieren.

A section of U.S. Highway 29, the main route for drivers leaving Pensacola north into Alabama, is named &quot;Don Sutton Highway&quot;, and a youth baseball complex in Molino, FL (near his childhood home of Cantonment, FL) also bears his name.

==Personal life==
Sutton was married twice: with his first wife Patti, he had two children: son Daron (b. 1969) and daughter Staci (b. 1973). With his second wife Mary, he had a daughter Jaqueline (b. 1996). His son Daron was also a broadcaster and has served as a television host or play-by-play announcer for five different Major League Baseball organizations: the Atlanta Braves, Milwaukee Brewers, Arizona Diamondbacks, Los Angeles Angels and Los Angeles Dodgers.

Sutton was an avid golfer and wine enthusiast and frequently made references to those hobbies while broadcasting. Sutton also broadcast golf and served as a pre- and post-game analyst for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1983 and 1987 American League Championship Series. Sutton previously served as a color commentator for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1979 National League Championship Series. He was also a fan of the game show &quot;Match Game&quot;, even appearing as a panelist on sporadic occasions from 1976 to 1980.

Sutton died of cancer on January 19, 2021, at age 75, at his home in Rancho Mirage, California.

<text>Video 2000 (also known as V2000, with the tape standard Video Compact Cassette, or VCC) is a consumer videocassette system and analogue recording standard developed by Philips and Grundig to compete with JVC&#x27;s VHS and Sony&#x27;s Betamax video technologies. It was designed for the PAL color television standard, but some models additionally handled SECAM. Distribution of Video 2000 products began in 1979 exclusively in Europe, South Africa and Argentina and ended in 1988.

Although some initial models and advertising featured a mirror-image &quot;VCR&quot; badge based on the logo of Philips&#x27;s earlier Video Cassette Recording (VCR) system, Video 2000 was an entirely new (and incompatible) format, which incorporated many technical innovations. Despite this, the format was not a major success and was eventually discontinued, having lost out to the rival VHS system in the videotape format war.

== The Video Compact Cassette ==
Philips named the videotape standard Video Compact Cassette (VCC) to complement its landmark audio Compact Cassette format introduced in 1963, but the format itself was marketed under the trademark Video 2000.

Despite the name, VCCs are marginally larger than VHS cassettes—shorter, but thicker and deeper. They have two co-planar reels containing half-inch (12.5 mm) wide chromium dioxide magnetic tape. The format used only half (6.25 mm) of the half-inch tape on a given &quot;side&quot;, and so it is occasionally referred to erroneously as a quarter-inch tape format, despite its physical tape width. The cassette can then be flipped over to use the other half of the tape, thus doubling playing time.

==Format and features==

Dynamic Track Following (DTF) eliminated the need for a separate control track and enabled the video heads to accurately follow the recorded tracks on the tape during playback. Therefore, by design V2000 machines do not require a video tracking control.

== Launch ==

A key intention of the V2000 format, thanks to DTF, was tape compatibility. A tape from any machine should play perfectly on any other machine. However, when the VR2020 reached the shops it was discovered that its audio head was 2.5 mm out of position compared to that on Grundig&#x27;s Video 2×4 (Grundig V1600). This meant that the sound would be out of sync with the picture when played back on the other type of machine. Both manufacturers&#x27; hastily moved the audio head 1.25 mm to a common position, but compatibility issues remained for recordings made on the first generation of machines.

<doc id="304689" wikidata="Q748379" url="?curid=304689" title="1960 U-2 incident">
<text>On 1 May 1960, a United States U-2 spy plane was shot down by the Soviet Air Defence Forces while conducting photographic aerial reconnaissance deep inside Soviet territory. Flown by American pilot Francis Gary Powers, the aircraft had taken off from Peshawar, Pakistan, and crashed near Sverdlovsk (present-day Yekaterinburg), after being hit by a surface-to-air missile. Powers parachuted to the ground and was captured.

Initially, American authorities acknowledged the incident as the loss of a civilian weather research aircraft operated by NASA, but were forced to admit the mission&#x27;s true purpose a few days later after the Soviet government produced the captured pilot and parts of the U-2&#x27;s surveillance equipment, including photographs of Soviet military bases.

The incident occurred during the tenures of American president Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, around two weeks before the scheduled opening of an east–west summit in Paris, France. Khrushchev and Eisenhower had met face-to-face at Camp David in Maryland in September 1959, and the seeming thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations had raised hopes globally for a peaceful resolution to the Cold War. The U-2 incident shattered the amiable &quot;Spirit of Camp David&quot; that had prevailed for eight months, prompting the cancellation of the summit in Paris and embarrassing the U.S. on the international stage. The Pakistani government issued a formal apology to the Soviet Union for its role in the mission.

Following his capture, Powers was convicted of espionage and sentenced to three years of imprisonment plus seven years of hard labour; he was released two years later, in February 1962, in a prisoner exchange for Soviet intelligence officer Rudolf Abel.

==Background==

In July 1958, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower requested permission from the Pakistani prime minister Feroze Khan Noon for the U.S. to establish a secret intelligence facility in Pakistan and for the U-2 spy plane to fly from Pakistan. The U-2 flew at altitudes that could not be reached by Soviet fighter jets of the era; it was believed to be beyond the reach of Soviet missiles as well. A facility established in Badaber (Peshawar Air Station), from Peshawar, was a cover for a major communications intercept operation run by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). Badaber was an excellent location because of its proximity to Soviet central Asia. This enabled the monitoring of missile test sites, key infrastructure and communications. The U-2 &quot;spy-in-the-sky&quot; was allowed to use the Pakistan Air Force section of Peshawar Airport to gain vital photo intelligence in an era before satellite observation.

President Eisenhower did not want to fly American U-2 pilots over the Soviet Union because he felt that if one of these pilots were to be shot down or captured, it could be seen as an act of aggression. At a time like the Cold War, any act of aggression could spark open conflict between the two countries. In order to ease the burden of flying Americans into Soviet airspace the idea developed to have British pilots from the Royal Air Force fly these missions in place of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). With the United Kingdom still reeling from the aftermath of the Suez Crisis and in no position to snub American requests, the British government was amenable to the proposal. Using British pilots allowed Eisenhower to be able to use the U-2 aircraft to spy for American interests in the Soviet Union, while still being able to plausibly deny any affiliation if a mission became compromised.

After the success of the first two British pilots and because of pressure to determine the number of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles more accurately, Eisenhower allowed the flying of two more missions before the Four Power Paris Summit, scheduled for 16 May. The final two missions before the summit were to be flown by American pilots.

On 9 April 1960, a U-2C spy plane of the special CIA unit &quot;10-10&quot;, piloted by Bob Ericson, crossed the southern national boundary of the Soviet Union in the area of Pamir Mountains and flew over four Soviet top-secret military objects: the Semipalatinsk Test Site, the Dolon Air Base where Tu-95 strategic bombers were stationed, the surface-to-air missile (SAM) test site of the Soviet Air Defence Forces near Saryshagan, and the Tyuratam missile range (Baikonur Cosmodrome).

The aircraft was detected by the Soviet Air Defense Forces when it had flown more than over the Soviet national boundary and avoided several attempts at interception by a MiG-19 and a Su-9 during the flight. The U-2 left Soviet air space and landed at an Iranian airstrip at Zahedan. It was clear that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had successfully performed an extraordinarily dangerous but productive intelligence operation. The next flight of the U-2 spy plane from Peshawar airport was planned for late April.

== Event ==
On 28 April 1960, a U.S. Lockheed U-2C spy plane, Article 358, was ferried from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to the US base at Peshawar airport by pilot Glen Dunaway. Fuel for the aircraft had been ferried to Peshawar the previous day in a US Air Force C-124 transport. A US Air Force C-130 followed, carrying the ground crew, mission pilot Francis Powers, and the backup pilot, Bob Ericson. On the morning of 29 April, the crew in Badaber was informed that the mission had been delayed by one day. As a result, Bob Ericson flew Article 358 back to Incirlik and John Shinn ferried another U-2C, Article 360, from Incirlik to Peshawar. On 30 April, the mission was delayed one day further because of bad weather over the Soviet Union.

The weather improved and on 1 May, 15 days before the scheduled opening of the east–west summit conference in Paris, Captain Powers, flying Article 360, &quot;56–6693&quot; left the base in Peshawar on a mission with the operation&#x27;s code word &quot;GRAND SLAM&quot; to overfly the Soviet Union, photographing targets including the ICBM sites at the Baikonur Cosmodrome and Plesetsk Cosmodrome, then land at Bodø in Norway. At the time, the USSR had six ICBM launch pads, two at Baikonur and four at Plesetsk. Mayak, then named Chelyabinsk-65, an important industrial center of plutonium processing, was another of the targets that Powers was to photograph. A close study of Powers&#x27; account of the flight shows that one of the last targets he overflew, before being shot down, was the Chelyabinsk-65 plutonium production facility.

The U-2 flight was expected, and all units of the Soviet Air Defence Forces in the Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Siberia, Ural, and later in the USSR European Region and Extreme North, were placed on red alert. Soon after the aircraft was detected, Lieutenant General of the Air Force Yevgeniy Savitskiy ordered the air-unit commanders &quot;to attack the violator by all alert flights located in the area of foreign plane&#x27;s course, and to ram if necessary&quot;.

Because of the U-2&#x27;s extreme operating altitude, Soviet attempts to intercept the aircraft using fighter aircraft failed. The U-2&#x27;s course was out of range of several of the nearest SAM sites, and one SAM site even failed to engage the aircraft since it was not on duty that day. The U-2 was shot down near Kosulino, Ural Region, by the first of three S-75 Dvina surface-to-air missiles fired by a battery commanded by Mikhail Voronov. The S-75 site had been supposedly identified previously by the CIA, using photos taken during Vice President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to Sverdlovsk the previous summer.

Powers bailed out but neglected to disconnect his oxygen hose first and struggled with it until it broke, enabling him to separate from the aircraft. After parachuting safely down onto Soviet soil, Powers was quickly captured. Powers carried with him a modified silver dollar which contained a lethal, shellfish-derived saxitoxin-tipped needle, but he did not use it.

The SAM command center was unaware for more than 30 minutes that the aircraft was destroyed. One of the Soviet MiG-19 fighters pursuing Powers was also destroyed in the missile salvo, and the pilot, Sergei Safronov, was killed. The MiGs&#x27; IFF transponders were not yet switched to the new May codes because of the 1 May holiday.

== American cover-up and exposure ==

Four days after Powers&#x27; disappearance, NASA issued a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had &quot;gone missing&quot; north of Turkey. The press release speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged, even falsely claiming that &quot;the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties&quot;. To bolster this, a U-2 was quickly painted in NASA colors and shown to the media. Under the impression that the pilot had died and that the plane had been destroyed, the Americans had decided to use the NASA cover-up plan. Nikita Khrushchev used the American misstep to embarrass President Eisenhower and his administration.

That same day, on 5 May, the Senate made its first comments on the U-2 incident and began a domestic political controversy for Eisenhower. Mike Mansfield, the Senate Majority Whip, stated, &quot;First reports indicate that the President had no knowledge of the plane incident. If that is the case, we have got to ask whether or not this administration has any real control over the federal bureaucracy.&quot; Mansfield, more than any other person, highlighted the dilemma Eisenhower faced—Eisenhower could admit responsibility for the U-2 flight, and likely ruin any chances for détente at the Paris Summit, or he could continue to deny knowledge and indicate that he did not control his own administration.

After Khrushchev found out about America&#x27;s NASA cover story, he developed a political trap for Eisenhower. His plan began with the release of information to the world that a spy plane had been shot down in Soviet territory, but he did not reveal that the pilot of this aircraft had also been found and that he was alive. With the information that Khrushchev released, the Americans believed that they would be able to continue with their cover story that the crashed U-2 was a weather research aircraft and not a military spy plane. The cover-up stated that the pilot of the U-2 weather aircraft had radioed in that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties while flying over Turkey. From there they claimed that the aircraft could have continued on its path because of auto-pilot, and that this could be the U-2 that crashed in the Soviet Union. The final attempt to make the cover story seem as real as possible was the grounding of all U-2 aircraft for mandatory inspection of oxygen systems in order to make sure that no other &quot;weather missions&quot; would have the same result as the one that was lost and possibly crashed in the Soviet Union.

On 7 May, Khrushchev sprang his trap and announced: 

Also, because of the release of some photographs of the aircraft, there was evidence that most of the covert U-2 technologies had survived the crash. From this Khrushchev was able to openly embarrass the Eisenhower administration by exposing the attempted cover-up.
Khrushchev still attempted to allow Eisenhower to save face, and possibly to salvage the peace summit to some degree, by specifically laying the blame not on Eisenhower himself, but on Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles and the CIA: Khrushchev said that anyone wishing to understand the U-2&#x27;s mission should &quot;seek a reply from Allen Dulles, at whose instructions the American aircraft flew over the Soviet Union&quot;. On 9 May, the Soviet premier told US ambassador Thompson that he &quot;could not help but suspect that someone had launched this operation with the deliberate intent of spoiling the summit meeting&quot;. Thompson also wrote in his diplomatic cable that Khrushchev suspected it was Allen Dulles, and that Khrushchev had heard about Senator Mansfield&#x27;s remarks that Eisenhower did not control his own administration.

Upon receiving this cable, Eisenhower, who frequently was very animated, was quiet and depressed. The only words he said to his secretary were, &quot;I would like to resign.&quot; Meanwhile, the domestic pressure continued to mount. Eisenhower then accepted Dulles&#x27;s argument that the congressional leadership needed to be briefed on the U-2 missions from the last four years. Dulles told the legislature that all U-2 flights were used for aerial espionage and had been flown pursuant to &quot;presidential directives&quot;. Still, Dulles played down Eisenhower&#x27;s direct role in approving every previous U-2 flight.

The next day, on 10 May, without consulting with any agency heads, House Appropriations Chair Clarence Cannon received considerable press attention when he, not President Eisenhower, revealed the true nature of the U-2 mission. He said to an open session of the House of Representatives that the U-2 was a CIA aircraft engaged in aerial espionage over the Soviet Union. Cannon said,
At the end of Cannon&#x27;s speech, Democrats and Republicans uncharacteristically rose to their feet to applaud.

Still, Eisenhower faced criticism in the press for not controlling his own administration, as Cannon&#x27;s speech only said the mission was &quot;under the aegis of&quot; the president, not &quot;directed by&quot;. Press reports were creating a belief in the public that Eisenhower had lost control, which Eisenhower would not let stand. Knowing that he was jeopardizing the Paris Peace Summit, Eisenhower decided to reveal the aerial espionage program and his direct role in it, an unprecedented move for a U.S. president. His speech on 11 May revolved around four main points: the need for intelligence gathering activities; the nature of intelligence gathering activities; how intelligence activities should be viewed (as distasteful, but vital); and finally that Americans should not be distracted from the real problems of the day. Eisenhower closed passionately by reacting to the Soviet claim that the US acted provocatively and said: &quot;They had better look at their own [espionage] record.&quot; As he finished, he told reporters he was still going to the Paris Peace Summit.

Defense analyst Richard Best, for the Congressional Research Service, writes: &quot;Many observers believed that when President Eisenhower in 1960 accepted responsibility for U-2 overflights of the Soviet Union, he made reaching agreements with Moscow much more difficult; had he blamed the flights on the Pentagon or the CIA, Khrushchev arguably might not have felt forced to react so strongly even though he might not believe the denials. Such reasoning, while constrained, is hardly unusual. It is easier for a President to deal with foreign leaders who are known to have committed violent acts, but have never admitted having done so, than to meet formally with those who have acknowledged &#x27;unacceptable&#x27; behavior.&quot;

A large part of the wreck as well as many items from Powers&#x27; survival pack are on display at the Central Armed Forces Museum in Moscow. A small piece of the U-2 was returned to the United States and is on display at the National Cryptologic Museum.

== Aftermath ==

===Contemporary reactions and effect on the Four Powers Summit ===
The Summit was attended by Eisenhower, Khrushchev, French President Charles de Gaulle, and British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. It was the first conference to be attended by both Soviet and western leaders in five years. However, prospects for constructive dialogue were dashed by the explosive controversy surrounding the U-2 flight over Soviet territory.

Although the Four Powers Summit was the first meeting between western and Soviet leaders in five years when it was held, the mood was optimistic that there could be an easing of tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States. In an effort to present a less hostile, more cordial Soviet Union, Khrushchev publicly advocated a policy of &quot;peaceful coexistence with the United States&quot;. The May Day celebrations on 1 May of that year were marked by this newfound cooperative spirit. Absent were the militarized symbols of previous parades, such as artillery and armor. Instead, there were children, white doves, and athletes. But the reaction of the Soviet government to the spy plane incident and the response from the United States doomed any potential meaningful peace agreement.

In the days directly leading up to the conference, tensions increased dramatically between the United States and the Soviet Union over the U-2 incident. At this point in the negotiations, the hardliners of the Soviet government were applying heavy pressure to Khrushchev. In the weeks leading up to the summit there had been a revitalization of anti-American sentiment within the Kremlin, with the Soviets blocking a planned trip to Washington D.C. of a Soviet air marshal, inviting Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong to Moscow, and launching an anti-American press campaign designed to critique &quot;American aggression&quot;. At this time east and west were divided about how to move forward in Berlin, and the American press characterized Khrushchev&#x27;s decision to emphasize the U-2 incident at the summit as an attempt to gain leverage on this issue.

The summit itself did not last long, with talks only beginning on 15 May and ending on 16 May. Both Eisenhower and Khrushchev gave statements on the 16th. Khrushchev blasted the United States on the U-2 incident. He pointed out that the policy of secret spying was one of mistrust and that the incident had doomed the summit before it even began. He expected the United States and Eisenhower to condemn the spying and pledge to end further reconnaissance missions.

At the summit, after Khrushchev had blown Eisenhower&#x27;s cover, Eisenhower did not deny that the aircraft had been spying on Soviet military installations but contended that the action was not aggressive but defensive. He argued that the current state of international relations was not one in which peaceful coexistence was an already established fact. The policy of the United States towards the Soviet Union at that time was defensive and cautionary. Eisenhower also made the point that dialogue at the Four Powers Summit was the type of international negotiation that could lead to a relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union where there would be no need to spy on each other. Eisenhower also laid out a plan for an international agreement that authorized the U.N. to &quot;inspect&quot; any nations willing to submit to its authority for signs of increased militarization and aggressive action. He stated that the United States would be more than willing to submit to such an inspection by the U.N. and that he hoped to circumvent the spying controversy with this alternative international surveillance agreement.

The meeting during which both parties made their statements lasted just over three hours. During this time Khrushchev rescinded an invitation he had earlier given to Eisenhower to visit the Soviet Union.

According to American broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite, Khrushchev would go on to say that this incident was the beginning of his decline in power as party chairman, perhaps because he seemed unable to negotiate the international arena and the communist hardliners at home. The collapse of the summit also saw an increased tension between the Soviets and the Americans in the years to come. After this debacle, the arms race accelerated and any considerations for negotiations were dashed for the immediate future.

===Consequences of the incident===
As a result of the spy plane incident and the attempted cover-up, the Four Power Paris Summit was not completed. At the beginning of the talks on 16 May, there was still hope that the two sides could come together even after the events that took place earlier in May, but Eisenhower refused to apologize and Khrushchev left the summit one day after it had begun. Even though Eisenhower refused to apologize, he did admit that the flights were &quot;suspended and would not resume&quot;. Some public opinion was that Khrushchev had overreacted to the event in an attempt to strengthen his own position, and for that, he was the one to blame for the collapse of the Four Power Paris Summit.

Before the U-2 incident Khrushchev and Eisenhower had been getting along well and the summit was going to be an opportunity for the two sides to come together. Also, Eisenhower had been looking forward to a visit to the Soviet Union and was very upset when his invitation was retracted. The two sides were going to discuss topics such as nuclear arms reduction and also how to deal with increasing tensions surrounding Berlin. According to Eisenhower, had it not been for the U-2 incident, the summit and his visit to the Soviet Union could have greatly helped Soviet and American relations.

The Soviet Union convened a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on 23 May to tell their side of the story. The meetings continued for four days with other allegations of spying being exchanged, as well as recriminations over the Paris Summit, and a US offer of an &quot;open skies&quot; proposal to allow reciprocal flights over one another&#x27;s territory, at the end of which the Soviet Union overwhelmingly lost a vote on a concise resolution which would have condemned the incursions and requested the US to prevent their recurrence.

The incident also reverberated around the world. For example in Japan, the incident contributed to the growth of the ongoing Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty (known as &quot;Anpo&quot; in Japanese) which allowed the United States to maintain military bases on Japanese soil. The Japanese government was forced to admit that U-2 planes were also based at U.S. bases in Japan, which meant that Japan might be subject to attack should a war break out between the United States and the Soviet Union. Accordingly, when the U2 revelations came to light, Japanese protesters felt added urgency in their drive to eliminate the treaty and rid Japan of U.S. military bases.

===Fallout in Pakistan and Norway===
;Pakistan
The U-2 incident severely compromised Pakistan&#x27;s security and dented relations with the United States. After the incident, Nikita Khrushchev threatened to drop a nuclear bomb on Peshawar, thus warning Pakistan that it had become a target of Soviet nuclear forces. General Khalid Mahmud Arif of the Pakistan Army stated that &quot;Pakistan felt deceived because the US had kept her in the dark about such clandestine spy operations launched from Pakistan&#x27;s territory&quot;, although Pakistan&#x27;s president Muhammad Ayub Khan may have known about the operations. Khan visited the USSR in 1965 and apologized for the incident. When Khan invited Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko to visit Pakistan, pointing out he&#x27;d never visited the country, the latter sarcastically replied &quot;I always keep ahead of the U-2&quot;.

The communications wing at Badaber was formally closed down on 7 January 1970. Further, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a lengthy inquiry into the U-2 incident.

;Norway
In Norway, authorities gave permission for the United States to have a temporary base in Bodø during 1960; the condition was that U-2 missions were only to fly over international waters; the request from the U.S. was made to chief of intelligence Vilhelm Evang, then passed on to defense minister Nils Handal, then passed on to &quot;&quot;regjeringens sikkerhetsutvalg&quot; (&#x27;the Cabinet&#x27;s security committee&#x27;) where prime minister Gerhardsen and foreign minister Lange&quot; were members.

In the Norwegian Armed Forces, the U2 incident caused &quot;dirty laundry to be aired&quot;, but no blame was assigned; as of 2022, the archives from 1960 of Norwegian Intelligence Service have not been declassified.

===Pilot&#x27;s fate===
Upon his capture, Gary Powers told his Soviet captors what his mission had been and why he had been in Soviet airspace. He did this in accordance with orders that he had received before he went on his mission. Powers pleaded guilty and was convicted of espionage on 19 August and sentenced to three years imprisonment and seven years of hard labor. He served one year and nine months of the sentence before being exchanged for Rudolf Abel on 10 February 1962. The exchange occurred on the Glienicke Bridge connecting Potsdam, East Germany, to West Berlin.

===New tactics and technology===
The incident showed that even high-altitude aircraft were vulnerable to Soviet surface-to-air missiles. As a result, the United States began emphasizing high-speed, low-level flights for its previously high altitude B-47, B-52 and B-58 bombers, and began developing the supersonic F-111, which would include an FB-111A variant for the Strategic Air Command. The Corona spy satellite project was accelerated. The CIA also accelerated the development of the Lockheed A-12 OXCART supersonic spyplane that first flew in 1962 and later began developing the Lockheed D-21 unmanned drone.

As a result of the capture, the Russians reverse-engineered the U-2 and ended up producing the Beriev S-13, but development was cancelled after Powers was released.

==Later versions==
The original consensus about the cause of the U-2 incident was that the spy plane had been shot down by one of a salvo of 14 Soviet SA-2 missiles. This story was originated by Oleg Penkovsky, a GRU agent who spied for MI6. In 2010, CIA documents were released indicating that &quot;top US officials never believed Powers&#x27;s account of his fateful flight because it appeared to be directly contradicted by a report from the National Security Agency&quot; which alleged that the U-2 had descended from 65,000 to 34,000 feet (19,812 to 10,363 m) before changing course and disappearing from radar. One more recent reading of the NSA&#x27;s story is that they mistakenly tracked the descent of a MiG-19 piloted by Sr. Lt. Sergei Safronov.

===Igor Mentyukov===
In 1996, Soviet pilot Captain Igor Mentyukov claimed that, at altitude, under orders to ram the intruder, he had caught the U-2 in the slipstream of his unarmed Sukhoi Su-9, causing the U-2 to flip over and break its wings. The salvo of missiles had indeed scored a hit, downing a pursuing MiG-19, not the U-2. Mentyukov said that if a missile had hit the U-2, its pilot would not have lived.

Though the normal Su-9 service ceiling was , Mentyukov&#x27;s aircraft had been modified to achieve higher altitudes, having its weapons removed. With no weapons, the only attack option open to him was aerial ramming. Mentyukov asserted that Soviet generals concealed these facts to avoid challenging Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s faith in the efficiency of Soviet air defenses.

===Selmer Nilsen===
In 1981, Selmer Nilsen, a Norwegian convicted for spying for the Soviet Union, claimed in his book &#x27;I Was a Russian Spy&#x27; that Powers&#x27;s U-2 had actually been sabotaged. He alleged that a bomb had been placed in the tail of the aircraft by two Soviet spies disguised as mechanics at a Turkish airfield. He claimed to have been told this by Soviet officials shortly after the incident. This may have been a contemporary 1962 theory also. Ian Fleming, writing his 1963 James Bond novel, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, had M mention to Bond during a briefing that &quot;a plastic explosives expert was working for the KGB in Turkey. If it&#x27;s true that the U-2 that fellow Powers was piloting was brought down by delayed charges and not by rockets, it may be this man is implicated.&quot;

===Fletcher Prouty===
Fletcher Prouty was an Air Force officer who coordinated covert actions between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Central Intelligence Agency. In the 1990s, he gave an interview suggesting the incident was an elaborate disinformation operation with a secondary political goal of sabotaging peace talks. Prouty noted the U2 did not carry the advanced camera, that the U2 had previously crashed and had been rebuilt by Lockheed to non-standard specifications, and the hydrogen tank had only been half-filled, meaning it would have run out of fuel over the Soviet Union. The effect of such an operation would be to mislead the Soviet Union about the aircraft&#x27;s capabilities such as camera resolution.

==Film==
In 2015, the Steven Spielberg feature film &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot; was released, which dramatized James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks)&#x27;s negotiations for Powers&#x27;s release, but took certain liberties with what really happened. For instance, Powers is shown being tortured by the Soviets, when in reality he was treated well by his captors and spent much of his time doing handicrafts.

In January 2016, the BBC magazine produced photographs from the time and an interview with Powers&#x27;s son.

<text>Lawrence Harvey Brown (born September 14, 1940) is an American basketball coach and former player who last served as an assistant coach for the Memphis Tigers. Brown is the only coach in basketball history to win both an NCAA national championship (Kansas Jayhawks, 1988) and an NBA title (Detroit Pistons, 2004). He has a 1,275–965 lifetime professional coaching record in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is the only coach in NBA history to lead eight teams (differing franchises) to the playoffs. He also won an ABA championship as a player with the Oakland Oaks in the 1968–69 season, and an Olympic gold medal in 1964. He is also the only person ever to coach two NBA franchises in the same season (Spurs and Clippers during the 1991–92 NBA season). Before coaching, Brown played collegiately at the University of North Carolina and professionally in the ABA.

Brown was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach on September 27, 2002. On July 8, 2021, the National Basketball Coaches Association awarded Brown the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Early life and early basketball accomplishments==
Brown is Jewish and was born in Brooklyn, New York. His maternal grandfather Hittelman was from Minsk, Belarus, and his mother&#x27;s family immigrated to the United States in 1910 and opened a bakery in Brooklyn. His mother met his father Milton Brown, a furniture salesman, when she was 26 years old. He has an older brother, Herbert, who has been an NBA head coach. In 1947 his father died suddenly of a ruptured aneurysm. His family moved first to Brooklyn, then to Long Beach, New York, on Long Island. His mother lived until the age of 106.

A point guard, Brown attended Long Beach High School. He won a gold medal with Team USA in basketball at the 1961 Maccabiah Games in Israel, on a team that included Art Heyman and Charley Rosen.

Brown attended University of North Carolina, where he played basketball under legendary coaches Frank McGuire and Dean Smith. Brown was an All-Atlantic Coast Conference player in 1963.

==Playing career==
A stellar player for the Tar Heels in the early 1960s, Brown was considered too small to play in the NBA. He began his post-college career with the National Alliance of Basketball Leagues&#x27;s Akron Wingfoots, where he played for two years (1964–65). He led the Wingfoots to the 1964 AAU National Championship. Brown was selected for Team USA&#x27;s 1964 Summer Olympics team, which won the gold medal.

After a two-year stint (1965–1967) as an assistant coach at North Carolina, Brown joined the upstart American Basketball Association, playing with the New Orleans Buccaneers (1967–68), Oakland Oaks (1968–69), Washington Caps (1969–70), Virginia Squires (1970–71), and Denver Rockets (1971–72). Brown was named MVP of the ABA&#x27;s first All-Star Game in 1968, and was named to the All-ABA Second Team the same year. Brown led the ABA in assists per game during the league&#x27;s first three seasons, and when he ended his playing career, Brown was the ABA&#x27;s all-time assist leader. His total of 2,509 assists places him seventh on the ABA&#x27;s career list, and he holds the ABA record for assists in a game with 23. He was a three-time ABA All-Star.

==Coaching and management career==

===Early years: 1969–1983===

Brown&#x27;s first head coaching job was at Davidson College in North Carolina in 1969. He resigned after less than two months, having never fielded a team or coached a game. He did not discuss the reasons for his resignation, saying only that &quot;it was in the best interests of Davidson and myself&quot;. He has later stated that it was a matter of the program reneging on promises made.

Brown moved on to the ABA and coached with the Carolina Cougars and then the Denver Nuggets, who later joined the NBA in 1976, for five and a half seasons from 1974 to 1979. He then moved on to coach for UCLA (1979–1981), leading his freshman-dominated 1979–80 team to the NCAA title game before falling to Louisville, 59–54. However, that appearance was later vacated by the NCAA after two UCLA players were found to be ineligible—one of the few times a Final Four squad has had its record vacated. Brown was the head coach for the NBA&#x27;s New Jersey Nets for two years following that, from 1981 to 1983.
===University of Kansas: 1983–1988===
Brown began his tenure at the University of Kansas (1983–1988), replacing the fired Ted Owens, who had overseen back-to-back losing seasons in 1981–82 and 1982–83. Brown&#x27;s impact was felt almost immediately, as the 1983–84 Jayhawks put together a 22–10 record, finished in second place in that year&#x27;s Big 8 standings, upset Oklahoma to win the 1984 Big 8 Tournament, and advanced to the 1984 NCAA Tournament&#x27;s Round of 32 before losing to Wake Forest. In the meantime Brown signed the most coveted high school player in the country, Danny Manning, to play for KU after signing his father, Ed Manning, to a position as an assistant coach.

Perhaps Brown&#x27;s finest team at Kansas was the 1985–86 team. This squad put together a 35–4 record, the first 30-win season in KU history. They won the Big 8 regular season title for the first time since 1978, defeated Iowa State to win the 1986 Big 8 Tournament, and advanced to the 1986 Final Four before losing to Duke in the semifinals.

In the 1987–88 season, Kansas got off to a mediocre 12–8 start, including 1–4 in the Big 8, and the end of the Jayhawks&#x27; 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse. Ultimately, behind the high-scoring of Danny Manning, KU rallied to win nine of their next twelve games to finish third place in the Big 8 and qualify for the 1988 NCAA tournament as a 6-seed in the Midwest Regional. Kansas then proceeded to defeat 11th-seed Xavier, 14th-seed Murray State, and 7th-seed Vanderbilt before meeting rival Kansas State, which had beaten KU twice in three meetings that year. KU upset the 4th-seeded Wildcats 71–58 in the Elite Eight to reach the Final Four in Kansas City&#x27;s Kemper Arena. Once there, Kansas upset the East Region&#x27;s #2 seed Duke, 66–59, avenging an overtime loss at home to the Blue Devils earlier in the season. Two nights later, the Jayhawks, who became known as &quot;Danny and the Miracles&quot;, upset the Southeast Region&#x27;s #1-seed and fellow Big 8 rival Oklahoma, 83–79, to avenge a regular-season sweep by the Sooners and win the 1988 NCAA championship. Manning, who scored 31 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in the final, was named Most Outstanding Player of the Tournament. Kansas concluded the year 27–11; the 11 losses remain a record for most losses by an NCAA champion to this day.

Two months later, Brown opted to return to professional coaching, departing KU for the San Antonio Spurs. In his five seasons at Kansas, Brown had one Big 8 regular season title, two Big 8 postseason titles, five NCAA Tournament appearances, three Sweet 16 appearances, two trips to the Final Four, and one national title. As a collegiate coach, he had a cumulative coaching record of 177–61 (.744) in seven seasons, including a 135–44 (.754) record at Kansas. His efforts led to him being named &quot;Coach of the Year&quot; for the NCAA in 1988 and &quot;Coach of the Year&quot; for the Big Eight Conference in 1986.

After Brown left Kansas to return to the NBA, NCAA sanctions were levied against Kansas in the 1988–89 season as a result of recruiting violations; potential transfer Vincent Askew was provided with money to leave his campus visit to visit his ill grandmother. No players on any of Brown&#x27;s teams were named in the report, and Askew did not transfer to Kansas. The Jayhawks were given three years&#x27; probation and banned from the 1989 NCAA Tournament–to date, the only time a defending champion has been barred from defending its title. They were also docked one scholarship for the 1989–90 season, and barred from paid visits during the 1989 calendar year. As harsh as these sanctions were, the infractions committee seriously considered imposing a &quot;death penalty&quot; on Kansas, which would have resulted in canceling the entire 1989–90 season. Indeed, enforcement director David Berst said that Kansas was &quot;on the bubble&quot; for a death penalty. However, the committee opted against imposing a death penalty because Askew was the only player who received impermissible benefits, and because Brown had returned to the NBA by then.

===San Antonio Spurs: 1988–1992===
Brown was hired to coach the San Antonio Spurs in 1988, signing a five-year, $3.5 million contract. With Brown at the helm, the Spurs won two consecutive Midwest Division titles. In his second season, the Spurs, led by David Robinson–who finally joined the Spurs after serving his two-year naval commitment–vaulted from the worst record in franchise history to the best. Brown remained with the Spurs until he was fired on January 21, 1992. He described his tenure later as a rocky one in his press conference for his next coaching position, saying &quot;In San Antonio, we won 21 games my first year, and that never satisfied our owner (referring to Red McCombs). From Day 1, I felt he felt he made a terrible mistake in hiring me, and no matter what we did after that I always felt that was the case...I have a commitment from the Clippers. I think they made a statement, and I think that statement will be made to the players. I don&#x27;t know if our players in San Antonio ever felt that I was in control of the basketball end.&quot;

===Los Angeles Clippers: 1992–1993===
On February 7, 1992, Brown was hired to coach the Los Angeles Clippers. He took a sub-.500 team in 1992 and guided them to their first winning season since the franchise moved to Los Angeles and their first playoff berth since they were the Buffalo Braves in 1976. He followed that up the next season with another playoff appearance in 1993. Brown resigned his position on May 21, 1993. The Clippers claimed to be surprised by the move, as he left with two years remaining on a contract that paid him $750,000 a year while on vacation in May. Brown claimed he resigned in February, which they accepted, although he stated that they tried to later offer him a contract for life (with a request from owner Donald Sterling himself) that they did not follow up on. He was the first fulltime Clippers coach to finish with a winning record in his tenure and the only one until Vinny Del Negro twenty years later.

===Indiana Pacers: 1993–1997===
Brown was hired by the Indiana Pacers in June 1993. Prior to Brown being their coach, the Pacers had never won a postseason series since joining the NBA. He proceeded to lead them to the conference finals on two occasions. On December 13, 1996, he won his 594th game as an NBA coach with a 97–94 victory over the Boston Celtics. Combined with his wins in the NCAA and the ABA, it was his 1,000th combined win as a head coach. He resigned his position on April 30, 1997, citing his frustration with the team&#x27;s inability to advance past the conference finals, which he felt was his responsibility. In four seasons, he had gone 190–138.

===Philadelphia 76ers: 1997–2003===
Brown was hired as head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers in 1997. The 76ers had lost 60 games prior to Brown&#x27;s arrival, but they were brightened by the emergence of Allen Iverson, who won Rookie of the Year. The 1997–98 season was the only one under Brown that the 76ers did not reach the postseason, as they went 31–51. In the strike-shortened 1998–99 season, they finished 6th in the Eastern Conference to reach the postseason for the first time since 1991. They advanced to the Semifinals after a first-round win, but they lost to the Indiana Pacers in a four-game sweep. The following year was essentially a repeat as they lost again to the Pacers in the Semifinals. The 2000–01 season, however, would be different. Bolstered by the efforts of Iverson, who led the league in scoring with 31.1 points per game and the defensive dominance of Dikembe Mutombo, the team rocketed their way to 56 wins, the first 50-win season since the 1989–90 team. They dispatched the Pacers in four games but had to deal with tough opponents in the Toronto Raptors and the Milwaukee Bucks in the Semifinals and Conference finals, respectively. Philadelphia won each of those series in seven games. They faced the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the 2001 NBA Finals, who had not lost any of their postseason games that year. The Sixers gave them trouble in Game 1 of the series, which saw them pull off an overtime win 107–101 with Iverson scoring 48 points. As it turned out, it would be the only highlight of the Finals for the Sixers, who lost the next four games to lose the series. After the season, Brown was named Coach of the Year.

The following year saw the team plagued by injury while making the playoffs as a 6 seed. They lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. The next year, they went 48-34 and made it in as a 4 seed. They beat the New Orleans Hornets in the first round before the Detroit Pistons ended their season with a six-game victory. Brown resigned his post in 2003. Brown also served as Director of Basketball Operations in Philadelphia.

In 2005, Allen Iverson, who frequently clashed with Brown when he played for him in Philadelphia, said that he was without a doubt &quot;the best coach in the world&quot;.

===Detroit Pistons and U.S. National Team: 2003–2005===
Brown was hired to replace Rick Carlisle to coach the Detroit Pistons. Brown won his first (and ultimately only) NBA championship during his first year with the Detroit Pistons in 2004, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers four games to one in the 2004 NBA Finals. By doing so, Brown became the first, and so far only, coach to lead teams to both NCAA and NBA titles. Brown is also the only NBA coach to take two teams (76ers and Pistons) to the NBA Finals against the same opponent (Los Angeles Lakers in 2001 and 2004), lose the first time, and win the second.

Brown was chosen as the head coach for the United States men&#x27;s basketball team at the 2004 Summer Olympics. That team won the bronze medal at the Olympics; it was the first U.S. men&#x27;s basketball team to fail to win gold at a Summer Olympics since NBA players began playing on the U.S. men&#x27;s team in 1992.

In May 2005, rumors surfaced that Brown would become the Cleveland Cavaliers&#x27; team president as soon as the Detroit Pistons finished their postseason. At any rate, the Pistons played the San Antonio Spurs to seven games in the 2005 NBA Finals. The Pistons were up two points with 9.4 seconds to play in game 5 and had to defend an inbound play. Rasheed Wallace was assigned to guard Robert Horry. On the play, Wallace trapped Manu Ginobili, who passed it away to Horry, who found time to shoot the game-winning three for the Spurs. Chauncey Billups (the Finals MVP from the previous year), who was not in the game for the final play, stated later that Brown &quot;just kind of choked&quot; in that game.

On July 19, 2005, the Pistons, displeased with Brown&#x27;s public flirtations with other teams—bought out the remaining years of Brown&#x27;s contract, allowing him to sign with another team. A week later, on July 28, 2005, Brown became the head coach of the New York Knicks, with a 5-year contract reportedly worth between US$50 million and $60 million, making him the highest-paid coach in NBA history.

===New York Knicks: 2005–2006===

On January 13, 2006, the Knicks beat the Atlanta Hawks to give Brown his 1,000th win in the NBA, making him only the fourth coach to do so (at the time, the other three were Lenny Wilkens, Don Nelson, and Pat Riley; coincidentally, all three had previously served as coach of the Knicks at some point in their careers.

Brown&#x27;s tenure as Knicks head coach lasted one season. The Knicks fired him on June 23, 2006, after he led the team to a 23–59 record. Brown&#x27;s season with the Knicks was marred by public feuds with his own players, most notably point guard Stephon Marbury. After the firing, the Knicks declined to pay the remaining sum (more than $40 million) under Brown&#x27;s contract on the grounds that he had been terminated for cause. Before the contract dispute was to be heard by NBA Commissioner David Stern, Brown reached an agreement with the Knicks wherein the team agreed to pay him $18.5 million.

===Philadelphia 76ers front office: 2007–2008===
In January 2007, Brown became Executive Vice President of the Philadelphia 76ers. Brown resigned in April 2008.

===Charlotte Bobcats: 2008–2010===
On April 29, 2008, Brown signed to become the head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats – his ninth NBA coaching job. He managed to keep the relatively young team in playoff contention. The following season, Brown guided the Bobcats to the franchise&#x27;s first ever playoff appearance. Charlotte was the eighth team he had led to the postseason, an NBA record.

On December 22, 2010, Brown parted ways with the Bobcats after the team started the 2010–2011 season with a record of 9–19. His departure was officially characterized as a resignation, but other sources reported that Brown was fired. Assistant coach Jeff Capel II told &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; that the entire coaching staff had been fired.

He returned to Lawrence, Kansas to coach in an exhibition match on September 24, 2011, for the &quot;Legends of the Phog&quot; event, opposite Ted Owens, in which various Kansas Jayhawks Basketball alumni played an exhibition game during the 2011 NBA lockout.

===Southern Methodist University: 2012–2016===
On April 17, 2012, ESPN reported that Brown was to be named the new head coach of the SMU Mustangs, replacing Matt Doherty, who had been fired from SMU earlier in March. Tim Jankovich, the head coach of Illinois State, was hired as the coach-in-waiting.

After a rebuilding season in 2012–2013 (15–17), Brown brought SMU into the national conversation the following year, as the school made its first appearance in The Associated Press Top 25 rankings since 1985. SMU went on to be the overall number one seed in the National Invitational Tournament, losing in the final game of the tournament to Minnesota, and finished the year with a record of 27–10. In the 2014–2015 season, SMU won the American Athletic Conference tournament and secured its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1993.

On September 29, 2015, Brown was suspended by the NCAA for 30% of the Mustangs&#x27; games in the upcoming 2015–2016 season, and the team was banned from 2016 post-season play, placed on probation for three years, and lost nine scholarships over a three-year period. The NCAA found that Brown failed to report violations when a former administrative assistant committed academic fraud on behalf of a student-athlete and he initially lied to enforcement staff about his knowledge of the potential violations.

On July 8, 2016, Brown announced his resignation as head basketball coach.

===Auxilium Torino: 2018===
On June 12, 2018, Brown accepted the proposal of Auxilium Torino to become the new head coach of the Italian basketball club of the Lega Basket Serie A (LBA). On June 17, he officially became new head coach of Torino. He was fired midseason on December 27 with the team&#x27;s record at just 5–19.

===University of Memphis: 2021–2022===
In June 2021, Brown joined the coaching staff of the Memphis Tigers men&#x27;s basketball program, as an assistant coach under head coach and former NBA player Penny Hardaway. Brown had most recently served as an assistant coach in 1967. After the 2021–22 season, Brown transitioned to an advisory role for Memphis before stepping down mid-season due to health concerns.

<doc id="304692" wikidata="Q864592" url="?curid=304692" title="Battle Royale (film)">
<text>is a 2000 Japanese dystopian action film directed by Kinji Fukasaku from a screenplay by Kenta Fukasaku, based on the 1999 novel of the same name by Koushun Takami. The film stars Tatsuya Fujiwara, Aki Maeda, Tarō Yamamoto, Chiaki Kuriyama, Kou Shibasaki, Masanobu Andō, and Beat Takeshi. It follows a group of junior high school students forced to fight to the death by a totalitarian Japanese government.

&quot;Battle Royale&quot; was theatrically released in Japan on December 16, 2000, by Toei Company, with an R15+ rating, which is rarely used in Japan. The film drew controversy and was banned or excluded from distribution in several countries. Toei refused to sell the film to any United States distributor for over a decade due to concerns about potential controversy and lawsuits, until Anchor Bay Films eventually acquired the film in 2010 for a direct-to-video release. Worldwide, it grossed against a production budget of $4.5 million. The film earned critical acclaim and, especially with its video releases, drew a large global cult following. It is often regarded as one of Fukasaku&#x27;s best films and one of the best films of the 2000s and of all time. In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as his favorite film of the previous two decades.

&quot;Battle Royale&quot; was the last film to be fully directed by Kinji Fukasaku. He started working on the sequel, titled &quot;Battle Royale II: Requiem&quot;, but died of prostate cancer on January 12, 2003, after shooting only one scene with Takeshi. His son, Kenta Fukasaku, who also wrote &quot;Requiem&quot;, completed the film that same year. The sequel drew mostly negative reviews and was deemed inferior to its predecessor.

The film is notable for featuring many young, unknown actors who became stars later on, along with helping to spawn the battle royale genre.

==Plot==

Following a recession, a totalitarian Japanese government passes an act to curb juvenile delinquency, sending a random junior high school class to participate in a game called Battle Royale. As junior high schooler Shuya Nanahara struggles to process his father&#x27;s suicide, his friend Yoshitoki Kuninobu stabs their teacher Kitano, who subsequently resigns. Shuya&#x27;s classmate, Noriko Nakagawa, secretly keeps Kuninobu&#x27;s knife.

One year later, Shuya&#x27;s class awakens on a remote island. Kitano explains that they were chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale; they have three days to fight to the death until a victor emerges. Explosive collars will kill uncooperative students or those within prohibited areas. Each student is provided rations, a map, supplies, and a random weapon. Kitano then kills two of the students, including Kuninobu. Twelve students die within the first six hours, four by suicide. Mysterious, abused loner Mitsuko Souma and brutal high schooler Kazou Kiriyama become the most ruthless players. Transfer student Shogo Kawada spares Shuya after killing one student, while Shuya accidentally kills another. Basketball player Shinji Mimura recruits others to help him hack into the computer system to disrupt the program.

Amid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe, as Kuninobu had feelings for her. They are eventually rescued from Mitsuko by Kawada, who reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, who sacrificed herself when they were the final two remaining. He volunteered for the current Battle Royale game to avenge her by winning and killing those in charge. Kiriyama eventually attacks and wounds Shuya with his Uzi, but Shuya is saved by Sugimura.

Shuya awakens in the island&#x27;s lighthouse, bandaged by Yukie Utsumi. Five other girls are hiding there, having made a pact to not participate in the game. Yuko Sakaki, having witnessed Shuya accidentally kill Tatsumichi Oki, attempts to poison his food. However, another girl, Yuka, eats it, leading to a confrontation between the group, which results in a shootout. All but Yuko are killed; guilt-ridden, she jumps to her death. Shuya reunites with Noriko and Kawada, and the trio sets out to find Mimura. Later, Sugimura is killed by Kotohiri, and he professes his love for her before he dies. Mitsuko kills her and then engages in a brawl with Kiriyama before she is killed.

Mimura and two others successfully infiltrate the computer system, which Kitano manually resets. Kiriyama arrives and kills them, but Mimura uses his homemade bomb to blow up the base, injuring and blinding Kiriyama. When the trio arrives at the base, Kawada engages in a shootout with Kiriyama. Kiriyama&#x27;s Uzi injures Kawada, while Kawada manages to detonate Kiriyama&#x27;s collar.

On the final day, the trio awakens on the shore. Kawada, aware of the collars&#x27; internal microphones, feigns killing Shuya and Noriko. Believing Kawada has won, Kitano brings him into the base, but realizes that Kawada hacked the system months beforehand and had disabled Shuya and Noriko&#x27;s tracking devices. Shuya and Noriko enter the control room, and Kitano unveils a painting of the massacred class, depicting Noriko as the victor. He explains that he was unable to bear the hostility from his students, having been rejected by his own daughter, and that, because Noriko never disrespected him, he views her as a daughter. He asks her to kill him, but Shuya shoots him after he threatens them. After a final phone conversation with his daughter, Kitano succumbs to his wounds. The trio leaves the island on a boat, but Kawada dies from his injuries. Some time later, Noriko gives Shuya the knife that Kuninobu had used to injure Kitano. Shuya and Noriko are declared fugitives by the Japanese government, last seen on the run toward Shibuya Station.

In an epilogue, Shuya dreams of Kuninobu, who tells him to move on with his life and that everything will be okay. Noriko reflects on the time she met Kitano for ice cream after the knife attack. When she tells him she has Kuninobu&#x27;s knife in her possession, Kitano responds, &quot;In this moment, what should an adult say to a kid?&quot;

==Cast==

==Production==
===Casting===
Roughly 6,000 actors auditioned for the film, which was narrowed down to 800 potential cast members. These finalists were subjected to a six-month period of physical fitness training under the supervision of the director, Kinji Fukasaku, who eventually cast 42 out of the 800.

Despite the characters being middle school students, Aki Maeda, Yukihiro Kotani, Takayo Mimura, and Yukari Kanasawa were the only four who were aged 15 to 16 years old. The other members of the cast had all graduated from secondary education, and Tarō Yamamoto and Masanobu Andō were the oldest among the actors, aged 25.

The actor-director-comedian Takeshi Kitano (also known as Beat Takeshi) was cast in the role of the teacher. His casting served several purposes. As one of the most successful Japanese celebrities of the last few decades, both domestically and internationally, he helped draw a large audience to the film. And more vividly, he was a real game show presenter, known for hosting popular Japanese game shows such as &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1986–1990), adding a sense of potential realism to the film&#x27;s extreme game show concept.

===Creative process===
Kinji Fukasaku stated that he decided to direct the film because the novel it was adapted from reminded him of his time as a 15-year-old munitions factory worker during World War II. At that time, his class was made to work in a munitions factory. In July 1945, the factory came under artillery fire from US navy warships. The children could not escape, so they dove under each other for cover. The surviving members of the class had to dispose of the corpses. At that point, Fukasaku realised that the Japanese government was lying about World War II, and he developed a burning hatred of adults in general that he maintained for a long time afterwards.

Beat Takeshi told a documentary crew during filming that he believes &quot;an actor&#x27;s job is to satisfy the director ... I move the way I&#x27;m told to. I try to look the way I&#x27;m told to. I don&#x27;t know much about the emotional side&quot;, before adding, &quot;Mr. Fukasaku told me to play myself. I did not really understand, but he told me to play myself, as I ordinarily would! I&#x27;m just trying to do what he tells me.&quot;

When asked in an interview with &quot;The Midnight Eye&quot; if the film is &quot;a warning or advice to the young,&quot; Kinji Fukasaku responded by describing the words &quot;warning&quot; and &quot;advice&quot; as &quot;sounding very strong to me&quot; as if they were actions that one tries to accomplish; therefore, the film would not be &quot;particularly a warning or advice.&quot; Fukasaku explained that the film, which he describes as &quot;a fable,&quot; includes themes such as juvenile crime(s), which in Japan &quot;are very much real modern issues.&quot; Fukasaku said that he did not have a lack of concern or a lack of interest; he used the themes as part of his fable. When the interviewer told Fukasaku that he asked the question specifically because of the word &quot;run&quot; in the concluding text, which the interviewer described as &quot;very positive&quot;, Fukasaku explained that he developed the concept throughout the film. Fukasaku interpreted the interviewer&#x27;s question as having &quot;a stronger meaning&quot; than &quot;a simple message.&quot; He further explained that the film simply contains his &quot;words to the next generation&quot;, so the viewer should decide whether to take the words as advice or as a warning.

===Music===
The film score for &quot;Battle Royale&quot; was composed, arranged, and conducted by Masamichi Amano, performed by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, and features several pieces of Western classical music along with Amano&#x27;s original compositions. The choral movement used in the film&#x27;s overture and original trailer is &quot;Dies Irae&quot; from Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;.

The song used during the end credits, &quot;Shizuka na Hibi no Kaidan o&quot; by the rap rock band Dragon Ash, is not included in either the Japanese or French edition of the soundtrack.

==Theatrical release==
===Controversies===
Fukasaku originally opposed the R15+ rating given by the &quot;Eiga Rinri Kanri Iinkai&quot; (Eirin) because of Fukasaku&#x27;s experiences as a teenager, the novel&#x27;s use of 15-year-olds, and the fact that many of the actors were around fifteen years of age. After he submitted an appeal and before &quot;Eiga Rinri Kanri Iinkai&quot; could rule on the appeal, members of the National Diet said that the film harmed teenagers; the Diet members also criticised the film industry ratings, which were a part of self-regulation by the Japanese film industry. Fukasaku dropped the appeal to appease the Japanese Diet in hopes they would not pursue increasing film regulation further. Fukasaku criticized the ruling since the film was already blocked from people under 16 years of age.

The film was labeled &quot;crude and tasteless&quot; by members of the National Diet and other government officials after it was screened for them before its general release. Fukasaku stated that the Diet members had preconceived biases, making them unable to understand the points of the film. The film created a debate over government action on media violence. At one point, director Kinji Fukasaku gave a press statement directed at the age group of the film&#x27;s characters, saying, &quot;You can sneak in, and I encourage you to do so.&quot; Many conservative politicians used the film to blame popular culture for a youth crime wave. Ilya Garger of &quot;Time&quot; magazine said that &quot;Battle Royale&quot; received &quot;free publicity&quot; and received &quot;box-office success usually reserved for cartoons and TV-drama spin-offs.&quot; The Japanese reaction to the film in the early 2000s has been compared to the British outrage over &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; in the early 1970s. Fukasaku stated that he felt discomfort with it, even though publicity increased due to the controversy.

Critics note the relation of &quot;Battle Royale&quot; to the increasingly extreme trend in Asian cinema and its similarity to reality television.

For eleven years, the film was never officially released in the United States or Canada, except for screenings at various film festivals. The film was screened to a test audience in the U.S. during the early 2000s, not long after the Columbine High School massacre, resulting in a negative reaction to the film&#x27;s content. According to the book &quot;Japanese Horror Cinema&quot;, &quot;Conscious of the Columbine syndrome, which also influenced the reception of &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999), much of the test audience for &quot;Battle Royale&quot; condemned the film for its &#x27;mindless&#x27; and gratuitous violence in terms very reminiscent of the British attitude towards Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (1971) on its initial release.&quot;

No North American distribution agreement for the film had ever been reached due to myriad corporate and legal concerns on the parts of both the Japanese Toei Company, Ltd. and prospective North American studios, despite mutual interest. It was said in 2005 by a representative of a prospective U.S. distributor that Japanese executives from the Toei Company were advised by American lawyers who attended test screenings in the early 2000s that &quot;they&#x27;d go to jail&quot; had the film been mass-released in the United States at the time. In the company&#x27;s best interests, Toei attached prohibitive rules, costs, and legal criteria to any possible North American distribution deal. Toei representative Hideyuki Baba stated that the reason for &quot;withholding distribution&quot; in North America was &quot;due to the picture&#x27;s contents and theme.&quot; A representative for a prospective US distributor criticised Toei for expecting a wide release rather than a limited art house run, noting that &quot;in the US it will never get past the MPAA ratings board, and the major theater chains will never play it un-rated. If you cut it enough to get an R rating, there&#x27;d be nothing left.&quot;

In April 2013, the film was banned in Germany, but subsequently the ban was lifted following an objection by the German distributor Capelight Pictures.

===Releases===
&quot;Battle Royale&quot; was released on December 16, 2000, in Japan. Over the next two years, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; was distributed to cinemas in 22 countries, across Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America (in addition to Mexico), gaining early cult film followings in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and the Philippines. The first showing in the US was at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, California, in 2002.

The original 113-minute version of the film began its first North American theatrical run at the Cinefamily Theater in Los Angeles on December 24, 2011, 11 years after its original Japanese release. The planned 9-day run was extended another 6 days due to popular demand. Beginning in early 2012, the film has been publicly exhibited at screenings in many American universities, including those in Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Texas and Massachusetts, with a New York City run at the IFC Center that began on May 25, 2012. As of June 2012, it has been regularly showing at the Projection Booth Theatre, site of the former Gerrard Cinema in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

===Special edition===
A special edition of the film was released after the original, which had eight extra minutes of running time. Unusually, the extra material includes scenes newly filmed after the release of the original. Inserted scenes include (but are not limited to):
* Flashbacks to a basketball game, which is used as a framework for the entire story.
* A flashback that expands on a likely contributor to Mitsuko Souma&#x27;s mental illness or sociopathy. She comes home from school to find her mother drunk with a strange man who tries to molest her. She then pushes him down the staircase to his death.
* Three epilogues (referred to as &quot;requiems&quot;). The first is an extension of the basketball scene, showing the students of Class 3-B winning their game. It also spotlights Mitsuko&#x27;s apparent social anxiety and alienation from the classmates in 3-B. The second is a vision of Nobu telling Shuya to take care of Noriko (a replay of a hallucination seen earlier in the special version of the film). The third is a scene between Kitano and Noriko, who talk casually by a riverbank; parts of this scene (a dream sequence) also appear in the original version of the film, but with the dialogue muted, whereas in the requiem it is audible and reveals a friendship or other relationship that may or may not have existed between Noriko and Kitano.
* Added shots of the lighthouse after the shoot-out.
* Added reaction shots in the classroom and extensions to existing shots.
* Extra CGI throughout the film.

===3D theatrical re-release===
The film was released to theaters in 3D in Japan on November 20, 2010. Fukasaku&#x27;s son and the film&#x27;s screenwriter, Kenta Fukasaku, oversaw the conversion. The 3D version was also screened at the Glasgow Film Festival on April 24, 2011. Anchor Bay Entertainment planned to release the 3D version in the United States sometime in 2011, but the release was cancelled.

==Home media==
===Sasebo slashing controversy===
The creators of the sequel postponed the release of the DVD (originally scheduled for June 9, 2004) to later that year because of the Sasebo slashing, in which the killer had read &quot;Battle Royale&quot;.

===Limited edition release===
Arrow Video released the film on Blu-ray and DVD in a limited edition version in the United Kingdom on December 13, 2010, as a three-disc collector&#x27;s edition set, featuring both cuts of the film. The DVD version was limited to 5,000 copies. The Blu-ray version was initially being released as limited to 5,000 copies, but due to the large volume of pre-orders, it was increased to 10,000 copies. The limited-edition Blu-ray is region-free, meaning it can play on Blu-ray players worldwide. The DVD is also region-free.

In 2021, Arrow Video announced a new limited edition Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray boxset featuring both cuts of the film in a new 4K restoration, as well as both cuts of the sequel on Blu-ray.

===United States release===
For a long time, Toei refused to sell the film to a United States distributor because he worried that the film would get involved in legal troubles in the United States. Eventually, Toei agreed to sell the film&#x27;s United States rights to Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2010.

An official DVD and Blu-ray edition of the film (and its sequel) was released in North America on March 20, 2012, by Anchor Bay Films. The film is available in a standard edition featuring the two films and a 4-disc &quot;Complete Collection&quot; that features both the Special Edition (labelled the Director&#x27;s Cut) and the theatrical version of the first film, the sequel, and a disc of behind-the-scenes material.

==Reception==
===Box office===
During the first weekend, it grossed (). It went on to domestically gross (), making it the third highest-grossing Japanese film of 2001, after the anime films &quot;Spirited Away&quot; and &quot;Pokémon 4Ever&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the film sold 56,758 tickets (including 56,182 tickets in 2001 and 576 tickets from later limited re-releases by 2017), equivalent to a box office gross revenue of approximately ().

In seven other European countries, the film sold 156,676 tickets (including 113,220 tickets in France and 43,456 tickets in six other European countries) between 2001 and 2017, equivalent to a box office gross revenue of approximately ().

The film also grossed $339,954 in South Korea, Chile, and Argentina, in addition to $26,099 in Taiwan. This brings the film&#x27;s estimated worldwide gross revenue to approximately in these thirteen countries (equivalent to adjusted for inflation in 2018).

===Critical reception===
 Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 based on seven critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; commented, &quot;Given the most basic characters to work with, the mostly teen cast attacks the material with frightening gusto, and Fujiwara dutifully invokes the voice of inner moral conflict. Production is exceedingly handsome and vigorous, offering no sign that Fukasaku is slowing down.&quot; He stated that, &quot;returning to his roots as Japan&#x27;s maestro of mayhem, Kinji Fukasaku has delivered&quot; one of &quot;his most outrageous and timely films&quot;, comparing it to &quot;the outrage over youth violence&quot; that Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; &quot;generated in early-&#x27;70s Britain&quot; and featuring some of &quot;the most startling scenes of mayhem since the movies of the wild and bloody &#x27;70s.&quot; Jason Korsner of BBC News gave &quot;Battle Royale&quot; four out of five stars, stating that it is &quot;a heart-stopping action film, teaching us the worthy lessons of discipline, teamwork, and determination, but wrapping them up in a deliberately provocative, shockingly violent package.&quot; BBC users gave the film five out of five stars. Almar Haflidason of BBC also gave the film five out of five stars. In a review for &quot;Empire&quot;, critic Kim Newman gave the film four stars out of five. He compared it to &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; in how it makes audiences &quot;wonder what they would do in the same situation&quot;, but wrote that &quot;Battle Royale&quot; gives &quot;even harder choices for its school-uniformed characters.&quot; He concluded that &quot;Some will be uncomfortable or appalled, and the mix of humour and horror is uneasy, but this isn&#x27;t a film you&#x27;ll forget easily. And, seriously, what would you do?&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film four stars in September 2001, choosing it as the best film of the week. He praised Takeshi Kitano&#x27;s performance as the teacher and some of the scenes as &quot;a stunningly proficient piece of action film-making, plunging us into a world of delirium and fear.&quot; He notes that, among &quot;the hail of bullets and the queasy gouts of blood, troubling narratives of yearning and sadness are played out. It is as if the violence of &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is not a satire of society at all but simply a metaphor for the anguish of adolescent existence.&quot; He concluded that, while some &quot;will find the explicit violence of this movie repulsive&quot;, it &quot;is a film put together with remarkable confidence and flair. Its steely candor and weird, passionate urgency make it compelling.&quot; Bryant Frazer of Deep Focus gave it a B+ rating and called it &quot;a vicious take-off on reality TV that turns a high-school milieu dominated by cliques and childish relationships into a war zone.&quot; British critic Jonathan Ross stated that &quot;if you want to catch a wildly original and super-cool slice of entertainment before it gets remade and ruined by the Americans, then I suggest you try hard not to miss it&quot; and concluded that &quot;it&#x27;s a wildly imaginative example of just what can be achieved in a teen movie.&quot; In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as the best film he had seen in the past two decades, stating that, &quot;If there&#x27;s any movie that&#x27;s been made since I&#x27;ve been making movies that I wish I had made, it&#x27;s that one.&quot;

There has been renewed interest in the film following its 2012 Blu-ray release in the United States. Chris Nashawaty of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rates the film an &quot;A&quot; grade, positing that the examination of the students&#x27; different motives for survival or subversion of the Program is a &quot;sick blast&quot;. A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, stating &quot;[the] expertly choreographed scenes of mayhem are at once comical and appalling, and [Fukasaku&#x27;s] young cast embraces the melodramatic extremity of the story with impressive conviction&quot;, adding that &quot;Battle Royale&quot; &quot;is in many ways a better movie [than &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;] and in any case a fascinating companion, drawn from a parallel cultural universe. It is a lot uglier and also, perversely, a lot more fun.&quot; Entertainment critic Cary Darling describes &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as &quot;tense, tragic and timely ... a modern-day horror story imbued with an electric sense of drama and dread.&quot; Alexandra Cavallo of the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; writes, &quot;&quot;Battle Royale&quot; is &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; not diluted for young audiences,&quot; while giving the film three stars out of four. Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustible Celluloid gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, calling it a &quot;gloriously sick and twisted story&quot; and claiming that it is &quot;endlessly entertaining, by turns gory and hilarious, disturbing and exciting.&quot; In the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert&#x27;s Australia correspondent Michael Mirasol praised &quot;Battle Royale&quot; for its &quot;thoughtful characterisation&quot; that is &quot;lavished upon all the students&quot; and concluded that it is an &quot;intensely violent fable aimed at a young audience, but with true feeling, intelligence, and respect.&quot; Jake Mulligan of &quot;The Suffolk Voice&quot; gave it five out of five stars, stating that &quot;the influence of &quot;&quot;Royale&quot; on works as disparate as &quot;Kill Bill&quot; and &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;&quot; cannot be measured&quot; and describing &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as &quot;Provocative, funny, violent, and aided by a script that somehow gives equal attention to most of the students while also displaying the well-thought-out minutia behind the narrative.&quot;

R.L. Shaffer of IGN gave the film a score of 8 out of 10, taking &quot;a moment to thank &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; for reminding us how awesome &quot;Battle Royale&quot; really is&quot; and concluding that &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is &quot;a masterpiece of mayhem, violence and unfettered teen melodrama.&quot; J. Hurtado of Twitch Film noted that many &quot;reviews of &quot;Battle Royale&quot; focus on the violence, which is extreme to be sure, and not so much on the humanity of the film.&quot; He stated that &quot;cranking up that already elevated hormonal level of emotional hysteria by throwing these students into a real life-or-death situation is incredibly effective&quot; and that &quot;the story of &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is the story of those teenage years and just how wrong we all were about the extent of our emotional turmoil.&quot; DVD Talk gave the original theatrical cut of the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and 4 out of 5 stars for the Director&#x27;s Cut, concluding that it gives &quot;a glimpse into what might very well happen should the rules of society, such as they are, ever do crumble to the point where it&#x27;s everyone for themselves. There&#x27;s enough black humor here and enough tense action that the film never quite feels bleak or depressing (though it does come close), but most importantly, it makes you think.&quot; Devon Ashby of CraveOnline gave the film a score of 8.5 out of 10, referring to it as &quot;Japanese legend Kinji Fukasaku&#x27;s adolescent shooting spree opus&quot; and &quot;a compassionate and technically accomplished masterpiece.&quot; Brent McKnight of PopMatters gave the film a score of 9 out of 10, describing it as &quot;savage, sharp, satirical, and brutally funny&quot; and &quot;a bleak commentary on humanity and society.&quot;

Film critics Robert Davis and Riccardo de los Rios praised the film&#x27;s narrative structure. They commented that in adapting a story such as &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, which requires a suspension of disbelief to go along with its &quot;far-fetched&quot; story, Fukasaku instead turns conventional rules of screenwriting on its head. Instead of focusing on the detail of the premise of a near future where school kids kill one another, &quot;the filmmakers dispense with premise in a short series of title cards&quot;. As the last film to be fully directed by Fukasaku, the &quot;Directory of World Cinema&quot; refers to &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as &quot;perhaps the finest cinematic swansong ever conceived.&quot;

===Social and political interpretations===
An interpretation of the film is that it represents Japanese generational attitudes that are creating social, political and economic divides between the young and old. Fukasaku himself has stated: &quot;The children who have grown up and witnessed what happened to the adults&#x27; anxiety became heightened as well. So I set &quot;Battle Royale&quot; within this context of children versus adults.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the 2001 Japanese Academy Awards, &quot;Battle Royale &quot;was nominated for nine awards, including Picture of the Year, and won three of them. The film was nominated for two awards from international film festivals but failed to win.

==Legacy==
In 2009, Quentin Tarantino listed &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as his favorite film released since he began directing in 1992. That same year, Moviefone included it in the top three of its &quot;50 Best Movies of the Decade&quot; list. Jon Condit of Dread Central called it &quot;one of the best movies [he&#x27;s] ever seen.&quot; Bloody Disgusting ranked the film fifteenth in its list of the &quot;Top-20 Horror Film of the Decade&quot;, with the article calling the film &quot;a go-for-break extravaganza: fun, provocative, ultra-violent, and bound to arouse controversy (which it did) ... the film [is] more than just an empty provocation; it builds character through action, a method all good filmmakers should seek to emulate.&quot; In 2010, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked &quot;Battle Royale&quot; #235 and #82 on their lists of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; and &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema,&quot; respectively. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the film in its list of Top 10 Ridiculously Violent Movies. In 2012, &quot;The Independent&quot; included it in its &quot;10 best sports movies ever made&quot; list. &quot;Complex&quot; magazine ranked it #47 in its list of The 50 Best Action Movies of All Time.

===Sequel===

Kinji Fukasaku, who directed the first film, began work on a sequel, entitled &quot;Requiem&quot;, but died of prostate cancer on January 12, 2003, after shooting only one scene with Takeshi Kitano. His son, Kenta Fukasaku, directed the rest of the film, which was released on May 18, 2003.

Unlike the first film, the sequel is not adapted from a novel but was based on an original screenplay written by Kenta Fukasaku. The plot revolves around the survivor Shuya Nanahara leading a terrorist rebellion, but was controversial for its provocative anti-American sentiments and criticised for being inferior to the original.

===Remake plans===
In June 2006, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that New Line Cinema, with producers Neal H. Moritz and Roy Lee, intended to produce a new adaptation of &quot;Battle Royale&quot;. Several Web sites echoed the news, including Ain&#x27;t It Cool News, which claimed the remake would be &quot;an extremely Hard R—serious-minded Americanisation of Battle Royale.&quot; New Line tentatively set a release date of 2008.

The next month, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on an Internet backlash against the remake. Through the article, Lee assured fans of his respect for the original work, claiming, &quot;This is the one I&#x27;m going to be the most careful with.&quot; He stated that, despite earlier concerns, the film would not be toned down to PG or PG-13, the characters would remain young teenagers, and that it would draw elements equally from the novel, the original film, and the manga. The reporter noted that &quot;the hubbub ... was at least slightly premature [as] New Line hasn&#x27;t yet purchased the remake rights.&quot;

Following the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007, Lee claimed that prospects for the remake had been &quot;seriously shaken&quot;. While he remained willing to proceed, he stated, &quot;we might be a little more sensitive to some of the issues.&quot; The reporting article noted that New Line still had not secured remake rights; its spokeswoman claimed &quot;no news&quot; when asked about progress on any deal.

&quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; pointed out that the 2008 novel &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; and its subsequent 2012 film adaptation have similar themes. Although &quot;Hunger Games&quot; author Suzanne Collins maintains that she &quot;had never heard of that book until [her] book was turned in&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reports that &quot;the parallels are striking enough that Collins&#x27;s work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff&quot; and that &quot;there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently.&quot; The 2012 film adaptation has also faced similar criticisms for similarities to &quot;Battle Royale&quot;.

In March 2012, Roy Lee reported that a remake of &quot;Battle Royale&quot; would no longer be possible due to the release of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;, stating, &quot;Audiences would see it as just a copy of &quot;Games&quot;—most of them wouldn&#x27;t know that ″&quot;Battle Royale&quot;″ came first. It&#x27;s unfair, but that&#x27;s reality.&quot; However, he stated that he might return to the film in ten years to &quot;develop a &quot;&quot;Battle Royale&quot; movie for the next generation.&quot;

===American TV series===
During the summer of 2012, The CW had been in discussion with Hollywood representatives about the possibility of turning &quot;Battle Royale&quot; into an American television show. According to a spokesperson, the talks were only preliminary, but if a deal could be reached, the network would acquire rights to Koushun Takami&#x27;s underlying novel, then unpack and expand on it for an hour-long dramatic series. Joyce Jun, a Hollywood attorney representing U.S. rights to the title, stated that &quot;there is no deal in place&quot;. A CW spokesman confirmed only there had been some discussion but declined to comment further.

==Cultural impact==

The film, especially with its DVD releases, drew a large global cult following and became a cultural phenomenon. Quentin Tarantino considers &quot;Battle Royale&quot; to be one of the most influential films in recent decades. The film has been highly influential in global popular culture, inspiring numerous works of battle royale genre fiction in a number of different media across the world.

===Film and television===
Since its release, the film has had an influence on filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino, most notably his &quot;Kill Bill&quot; films; the character Gogo Yubari, played by Chiaki Kuriyama, resembles the character she plays in &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, Takako Chigusa. &quot;Battle Royale&quot; has also been referenced in the 2004 zombie comedy film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, where Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg made sure a big &quot;Battle Royale&quot; poster is prominently displayed in Shaun&#x27;s living room. Despite not being officially released in the United States for a long time, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; has often been referenced in American pop culture, ranging from Tarantino&#x27;s films to the rock band The Flaming Lips&#x27; use of footage from the film as a backdrop for its &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; tour, along with references in Hollywood films such as Jason Reitman&#x27;s &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot; (2005) and &quot;Juno&quot; (2007) and American television shows such as &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Community&quot;. In &quot;Wrong Turn 2: Dead End&quot;, one of the characters (Matthew Currie Holmes as Michael &quot;M&quot; Epstein) wears a &quot;Battle Royale&quot; shirt.

Maggie Lee of Reuters describes &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as the &quot;film that pioneered the concept of the teen death game&quot;, citing its influence on films such as &quot;Kaiji&quot; (2009) and Hideo Nakata&#x27;s &quot;The Incite Mill&quot; (2010), both of which starred Tatsuya Fujiwara (who played &quot;Battle Royale&quot; protagonist Shuya Nanahara) in the leading roles. V.A. Musetto of the &quot;New York Post&quot; compared it to &quot;The Condemned&quot; (2007), which the critic called &quot;a bad rip-off&quot; of &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as well as &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;.

Critics have also noted the influence of &quot;Battle Royale&quot; on other films, such as the 2008 film &quot;Kill Theory&quot;, the 2009 film &quot;The Tournament&quot;, and &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; trilogy. &quot;Battle Royale&quot; has also drawn comparisons to films such as &quot;Gamer&quot; (2009), &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Belko Experiment&quot; (2016). Other examples of &quot;battle royale&quot; films include &quot;The Purge&quot; series (2013), &quot;Assassination Nation&quot; (2018), &quot;Ready or Not&quot; (2019), and &quot;The Hunt&quot; (2020). The South Korean Netflix original series &quot;Squid Game&quot; (2021) was also influenced by &quot;Battle Royale&quot;.

===Comics, manga and anime===
In Japan, the film established the battle royale genre of manga and anime, revolving around a similar narrative premise. Along with the &quot;Battle Royale&quot; manga (2000 debut), other examples of the genre include &quot;Basilisk&quot; (2003 debut), &quot;Bokurano&quot; (2003 debut), the &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; franchise (2004 debut), &quot;Future Diary&quot; (2006 debut), &quot;Deadman Wonderland&quot; (2007 debut), the &quot;Danganronpa&quot; franchise (2010 debut), &quot;Magical Girl Raising Project&quot; (2012 debut), and the &quot;Death Parade&quot; series (2013 debut). &quot;Battle Royale&quot; has also drawn comparisons to the &quot;Gantz&quot; franchise of manga (2000), anime (2004) and films (2011). &quot;Btooom!&quot; (2009 debut) features a variation of the battle royale theme.

The film has influenced the creation of the Marvel Comics series &quot;Avengers Arena&quot;. The series&#x27; logo also mirrors that of the logo used in the &quot;Battle Royale&quot; movie.

===Video games and visual novels===
The genre of battle royale video games, in which players compete to be the last one standing in a shrinking battlefield, was inspired by and took its name from the film. The genre became popular in the late 2010s and includes games such as &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot;, &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;, &quot;ARMA 3&quot;, &quot;H1Z1: King of the Kill&quot;, &quot;Knives Out&quot;, &quot;Rules of Survival&quot;, &quot;Garena Free Fire&quot;, &quot;Apex Legends&quot;, &quot;Realm Royale&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops 4&quot;″s &quot;Blackout&quot; game mode, and &quot;Call of Duty: Warzone&quot;.

The film&#x27;s title also refers to the battle royale genre of visual novels, revolving around a similar narrative premise. Examples include the &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; series (2004 debut), &quot;Dies irae&quot; (2007), and the &quot;Zero Escape&quot; series (2009 debut). The &quot;Danganronpa&quot; series (2010 debut) is also notably influenced by the film, with its scenario writer Kazutaka Kodaka citing the film as an influence. &quot;Battle Royale&quot; has also drawn comparisons to Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;The World Ends with You&quot; (2007).

<text>Charles Melvin &quot;Cootie&quot; Williams (July 10, 1911 – September 15, 1985) was an American jazz, jump blues, and rhythm and blues trumpeter.

==Biography==
Born in Mobile, Alabama, Williams began his professional career at the age of 14 with the Young Family band, which included saxophonist Lester Young. According to Williams he acquired his nickname as a boy when his father took him to a band concert. When it was over his father asked him what he&#x27;d heard and he replied, &quot;Cootie, cootie, cootie.&quot;

In 1928, he made his first recordings with pianist James P. Johnson in New York, where he also worked briefly in the bands of Chick Webb and Fletcher Henderson. Williams rose to prominence as a member of Duke Ellington&#x27;s orchestra when the band was playing at the Cotton Club, with which he first performed from 1929 to 1940. He also recorded his own sessions during this time, both freelance and with other Ellington sidemen. Williams was renowned for his &quot;jungle&quot;-style trumpet playing (in the manner of Ellington&#x27;s earlier trumpeter Bubber Miley and trombonist Joe &quot;Tricky Sam&quot; Nanton) and for his use of the plunger mute. He also sang occasionally, a notable instrumental feature being in the Ellington piece &quot;Echoes of the Jungle&quot;. For him, Duke Ellington wrote &quot;Concerto for Cootie,&quot; which when lyrics were added became &quot;Do Nothing till You Hear from Me&quot;. He was also the soloist in other Ellington compositions, such as &quot;Echoes of Harlem&quot;, &quot;Harlem Air Shaft&quot;, and the religious piece &quot;The Shepherd Who Watches Over the Night Flock&quot;, which was dedicated to the Rev. John Gensel.

In 1940, Williams joined Benny Goodman&#x27;s orchestra, a highly publicized move that caused quite a stir at the time (commemorated by Raymond Scott with the song &quot;When Cootie Left the Duke&quot;), then in 1941 formed his own orchestra, in which over the years he employed Charlie Parker, Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, Bud Powell, Eddie Vinson, and other young players.

In 1947, Williams wrote the song &quot;Cowpox Boogie&quot; while recuperating from a bout with smallpox. He contracted the disease from a vaccination he insisted all band members receive.

By the late 1940s, Williams had fallen into obscurity, having had to reduce his band numbers and finally to disband. In the 1950s, he began to play more rhythm and blues, toured with small groups, and played in the Savoy Ballroom.

In the late 1950s, he formed a small jazz group and recorded a number of albums with Rex Stewart, as well as his own album, &quot;Cootie Williams in Hi-Fi&quot; (1958). In 1962, he rejoined Ellington and stayed with the orchestra until 1974, after Ellington&#x27;s death. In 1975, he performed during the Super Bowl IX halftime show. He was a 1991 inductee of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame.

==Death==
Williams died in New York City on September 15, 1985, at the age of 74 from a kidney ailment. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

<doc id="304699" wikidata="Q95385166" url="?curid=304699" title="Luciferase">
<text>Luciferase is a generic term for the class of oxidative enzymes that produce bioluminescence, and is usually distinguished from a photoprotein. The name was first used by Raphaël Dubois who invented the words &quot;luciferin&quot; and &quot;luciferase&quot;, for the substrate and enzyme, respectively. Both words are derived from the Latin word &quot;lucifer&quot;, meaning &quot;lightbearer&quot;, which in turn is derived from the Latin words for &quot;light&quot; (&quot;lux)&quot; and &quot;to bring or carry&quot; (&quot;ferre)&quot;.Luciferases are widely used in biotechnology, for bioluminescence imaging microscopy and as reporter genes, for many of the same applications as fluorescent proteins. However, unlike fluorescent proteins, luciferases do not require an external light source, but do require addition of luciferin, the consumable substrate.

== Examples ==
A variety of organisms regulate their light production using different luciferases in a variety of light-emitting reactions. The majority of studied luciferases have been found in animals, including fireflies, and many marine animals such as copepods, jellyfish, and the sea pansy. However, luciferases have been studied in luminous fungi, like the Jack-O-Lantern mushroom, as well as examples in other kingdoms including bioluminescent bacteria, and dinoflagellates.

=== Firefly and click beetle ===

The luciferases of fireflies – of which there are over 2000 species – and of the other Elateroidea (click beetles and relatives in general) are diverse enough to be useful in molecular phylogeny. In fireflies, the oxygen required is supplied through a tube in the abdomen called the abdominal trachea. One well-studied luciferase is that of the Photinini firefly &quot;Photinus pyralis&quot;, which has an optimum pH of 7.8.

=== Sea pansy ===

Also well studied is the sea pansy, &quot;Renilla reniformis&quot;. In this organism, the luciferase (Renilla-luciferin 2-monooxygenase) is closely associated with a luciferin-binding protein as well as a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Calcium triggers release of the luciferin (coelenterazine) from the luciferin binding protein. The substrate is then available for oxidation by the luciferase, where it is degraded to coelenteramide with a resultant release of energy. In the absence of GFP, this energy would be released as a photon of blue light (peak emission wavelength 482 nm). However, due to the closely associated GFP, the energy released by the luciferase is instead coupled through resonance energy transfer to the fluorophore of the GFP, and is subsequently released as a photon of green light (peak emission wavelength 510 nm). The catalyzed reaction is:

* coelenterazine + O2 → coelenteramide + CO2 + photon of light

==== Copepod ====

Newer luciferases have recently been identified that, unlike other luciferases, are naturally secreted molecules. One such example is the &quot;Metridia&quot; coelenterazine-dependent luciferase (MetLuc, ) that is derived from the marine copepod &quot;Metridia longa&quot;. The &quot;Metridia longa&quot; secreted luciferase gene encodes a 24 kDa protein containing an N-terminal secretory signal peptide of 17 amino acid residues. The sensitivity and high signal intensity of this luciferase molecule proves advantageous in many reporter studies. Some of the benefits of using a secreted reporter molecule like MetLuc is its no-lysis protocol that allows one to be able to conduct live cell assays and multiple assays on the same cell.

=== Bacterial ===

Bacterial bioluminescence is seen in Photobacterium species, &quot;Vibrio fischeri, Vibrio haweyi, and Vibrio harveyi&quot;. Light emission in some bioluminescent bacteria utilizes &#x27;antenna&#x27; such as lumazine protein to accept the energy from the primary excited state on the luciferase, resulting in an excited lulnazine chromophore which emits light that is of a shorter wavelength (more blue), while in others use a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) with flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as the chromophore and emits light that is red-shifted relative to that from luciferase.

=== Dinoflagellate ===

Dinoflagellate luciferase is a multi-domain eukaryote protein, consisting of an N-terminal domain, and three catalytic domains, each of which preceded by a helical bundle domain. The structure of the dinoflagellate luciferase catalytic domain has been solved. The core part of the domain is a 10 stranded beta barrel that is structurally similar to lipocalins and FABP. 
The N-terminal domain is conserved between dinoflagellate luciferase and luciferin binding proteins (LBPs). It has been suggested that this region may mediate an interaction between LBP and luciferase or their association with the vacuolar membrane.
The helical bundle domain has a three helix bundle structure that holds four important histidines that are thought to play a role in the pH regulation of the enzyme. There is a large pocket in the β-barrel of the dinoflagellate luciferase at pH 8 to accommodate the tetrapyrrole substrate but there is no opening to allow the substrate to enter. Therefore, a significant conformational change must occur to provide access and space for a ligand in the active site and the source for this change is through the four N-terminal histidine residues. At pH 8, it can be seen that the unprotonated histidine residues are involved in a network of hydrogen bonds at the interface of the helices in the bundle that block substrate access to the active site and disruption of this interaction by protonation (at pH 6.3) or by replacement of the histidine residues by alanine causes a large molecular motion of the bundle, separating the helices by 11Å and opening the catalytic site. Logically, the histidine residues cannot be replaced by alanine in nature but this experimental replacement further confirms that the larger histidine residues block the active site. Additionally, three Gly-Gly sequences, one in the N-terminal helix and two in the helix-loop-helix motif, could serve as hinges about which the chains rotate in order to further open the pathway to the catalytic site and enlarge the active site.

A dinoflagellate luciferase is capable of emitting light due to its interaction with its substrate (luciferin) and the luciferin-binding protein (LBP) in the scintillon organelle found in dinoflagellates. The luciferase acts in accordance with luciferin and LBP in order to emit light but each component functions at a different pH. Luciferase and its domains are not active at pH 8 but they are extremely active at the optimum pH of 6.3 whereas LBP binds luciferin at pH 8 and releases it at pH 6.3. Consequently, luciferin is only released to react with an active luciferase when the scintillon is acidified to pH 6.3. Therefore, in order to lower the pH, voltage-gated channels in the scintillon membrane are opened to allow the entry of protons from a vacuole possessing an action potential produced from a mechanical stimulation. Hence, it can be seen that the action potential in the vacuolar membrane leads to acidification and this in turn allows the luciferin to be released to react with luciferase in the scintillon, producing a flash of blue light.

== Mechanism of reaction ==
All luciferases are classified as oxidoreductases (), meaning they act on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen. Because luciferases are from many diverse protein families that are unrelated, there is no unifying mechanism, as any mechanism depends on the luciferase and luciferin combination. However, all characterised luciferase-luciferin reactions to date have been shown to require molecular oxygen at some stage.

=== Firefly luciferase ===
The luciferase of &quot;Photinus pyralis&quot; catalyzes a two-step bioluminescent reaction. First is adenylation, a process in which D-luciferin is converted to D-luciferyl-adenylate (D-AMP) via the covalent addition of adenosine monophosphate  to an amino acid side chain. Next, oxidative decarboxylation of the adenylated intermediate occurs, a necessary step for light emission. Studies have presented the first crystal structure of luciferase in its second catalytic conformation using DLSA (5′-O-[N-(dehydroluciferyl)-sulfamoyl]adenosine), a stable analog of D-AMP. The Photinus pyralis luciferase in the adenylate-forming conformation bound to DLSA illustrates conserved interactions observed in other adenylate-forming enzymes as well as key insights into the mechanism of bioluminescence. The active site is located at the interface of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Lys529 is the catalytic lysine for the initial adenylation reaction, interacting with the carbonyl oxygen of the ligand. A transition to the oxidation-available conformation involves a ~140° rotation of the C-terminal domain, upon which oxidation initiates formation of the dioxetanone intermediate. The decomposition of this intermediate releases visible light. Unlike D-AMP, DLSA cannot undergo oxidation, but the “locking” of the enzyme in its second catalytic conformation allowed researchers to study the oxidation-ready state of luciferase.

=== Bacterial luciferase ===
The reaction catalyzed by bacterial luciferase is also an oxidative process:
* FMNH2 + O2 + RCHO → FMN + RCOOH + H2O + light

In the reaction, molecular oxygen oxidizes flavin mononucleotide and a long-chain aliphatic aldehyde to an aliphatic carboxylic acid. The reaction forms an excited hydroxyflavin intermediate, which is dehydrated to the product FMN to emit blue-green light.
Nearly all of the energy input into the reaction is transformed into light. The reaction is 80% to 90% efficient. In comparison, the incandescent light bulb only converts about 10% of its energy into light and a 150 lumen per Watt (lm/W) LED converts 20% of input energy to visible light.

== Applications ==

Luciferases can be produced in the lab through genetic engineering for a number of purposes. Luciferase genes can be synthesized and inserted into organisms or transfected into cells. As of 2002, mice, silkworms, and potatoes are just a few of the organisms that have already been engineered to produce the protein.

In the luciferase reaction, light is emitted when luciferase acts on the appropriate luciferin substrate. Photon emission can be detected by light sensitive apparatus such as a luminometer or an optical microscope with a CCD camera. This allows observation of biological processes. Since light excitation is not needed for luciferase bioluminescence, there is minimal autofluorescence and therefore the bioluminescent signal is virtually background-free. Therefore, as little as 0.02 pg can still be accurately measured using a standard scintillation counter.

In biological research, luciferase is commonly used as a reporter to assess the transcriptional activity in cells that are transfected with a genetic construct containing the luciferase gene under the control of a promoter of interest. Additionally, proluminescent molecules that are converted to luciferin upon activity of a particular enzyme can be used to detect enzyme activity in coupled or two-step luciferase assays. Such substrates have been used to detect caspase activity and cytochrome P450 activity, among others.

Luciferase can also be used to detect the level of cellular ATP in cell viability assays or for kinase activity assays. Luciferase can act as an ATP sensor protein through biotinylation. Biotinylation will immobilize luciferase on the cell-surface by binding to a streptavidin-biotin complex. This allows luciferase to detect the efflux of ATP from the cell and will effectively display the real-time release of ATP through bioluminescence. Luciferase can additionally be made more sensitive for ATP detection by increasing the luminescence intensity by changing certain amino acid residues in the sequence of the protein.

Whole organism imaging (referred to as &quot;in vivo&quot; when intact or, otherwise called &quot;ex vivo&quot; imaging for example of living but explanted tissue) is a powerful technique for studying cell populations in live plants or animals, such as mice. Different types of cells (e.g. bone marrow stem cells, T-cells) can be engineered to express a luciferase allowing their non-invasive visualization inside a live animal using a sensitive charge-couple device camera (CCD camera).This technique has been used to follow tumorigenesis and response of tumors to treatment in animal models. However, environmental factors and therapeutic interferences may cause some discrepancies between tumor burden and bioluminescence intensity in relation to changes in proliferative activity. The intensity of the signal measured by in vivo imaging may depend on various factors, such as -luciferin absorption through the peritoneum, blood flow, cell membrane permeability, availability of co-factors, intracellular pH and transparency of overlying tissue, in addition to the amount of luciferase.

Luciferase is a heat-sensitive protein that is used in studies on protein denaturation, testing the protective capacities of heat shock proteins. The opportunities for using luciferase continue to expand.

<doc id="304706" wikidata="Q495167" url="?curid=304706" title="Panmunjom">
<text>Panmunjom (also spelled Panmunjeom) was a village just north of the &quot;de facto&quot; border between North Korea and South Korea, where the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement that ended the Korean War was signed. It was located in what is now Paju, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea and Panmun-guyok, Kaesong, North Korea. The building where the armistice was signed still stands.

Its name is often used as a metonym for the nearby Joint Security Area (JSA), where discussions between North Korea and South Korea still take place in blue buildings that straddle the Military Demarcation Line. As such, it is considered one of the last vestiges of the Cold War.

==Location==
The site of the former village is 53 kilometers north-northwest of the capital of South Korea, Seoul, and 10 kilometers east of Kaesong. The village, a small cluster of fewer than ten huts, is on the south side of the Kaesong-Seoul road on the west bank of the Sa&#x27;cheon stream. Meetings of the Military Armistice Commission took place in several tents set up on the north side.

The eighteen copies of Volume I and II of the armistice were signed by the senior delegates of each side in a building constructed by both sides over a 48-hour period. (North Korea provided labour and some supplies, while the United Nations Command provided some supplies, generators and lighting to allow the work to continue at night.)

After the Armistice Agreement was signed, construction began in September 1953 on a new site, the JSA, located approximately one kilometer east of the village. All meetings between North Korea and the United Nations Command or South Korea have taken place here since its completion. The JSA is often referred to as Panmunjom.

After the war, all civilians were removed from the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), except for two villages near the JSA on opposite sides of the Military Demarcation Line. After that, the empty village of Panmunjom fell into disrepair and eventually disappeared from the landscape. There is no evidence of it today. However, the building constructed for the signing of the armistice has since been renamed by North Korea as the Peace Museum.

== Truce talks and POW issue ==
United Nations forces met with North Korean and Chinese officials at Panmunjom from 1951 to 1953 for truce talks. The talks dragged on for many months. The main point of contention during the talks was the question surrounding the prisoners of war. Moreover, South Korea was uncompromising in its demand for a unified state. On 8 June 1953, an agreement to the POW problem was reached.

Those prisoners who refused to return to their countries were allowed to live under a neutral supervising commission for three months. At the end of this period, those who still refused repatriation would be released. Among those who refused repatriation were 21 American and one British POWs, all but two of whom chose to defect to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

A final armistice agreement was reached on 27 July 1953. The United Nations Command, Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army, and North Korea People&#x27;s Army agreed to an armistice ending the fighting. The agreement established a 4-kilometer-wide demilitarized zone along the armistice line, effectively dividing Korea into two separate countries. Although most troops and all heavy weapons were to be removed from the area, it has been heavily armed by both sides since the end of the fighting.

<doc id="304707" wikidata="Q365863" url="?curid=304707" title="George Washington Donaghey">
<text>George Washington Donaghey (July 1, 1856 – December 15, 1937) was an American businessman and the 22nd Governor of the U.S. state of Arkansas from 1909 to 1913.

==Early life and education==
Donaghey was born as the oldest of five children to Christopher Columbus and Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Ingram) Donaghey, in the Oakland Community in Union Parish in north Louisiana. His father&#x27;s family was from Ireland and his mother&#x27;s from Scotland. His father Christopher was a farmer who moved from Alabama to northern Louisiana, purchasing land there, and later moved to Arkansas where he served in the Confederate Army.

In 1875, without letting his family know, Donaghey moved to Texas where he worked as a cowboy on the Chisholm Trail and farmer, but later moved again to Arkansas in 1876 due to cowboy lifestyle and health issues. From 1882 to 1883, he attended the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He was a school teacher and carpenter, and studied both architecture and structural engineering. In 1883, Donaghey established his residence at Conway, Arkansas, and adopted that city as his hometown. There, he later met his wife Louvenia Wallace; they had no children. One of the major streets there bears his name. He served one term as town marshal and was an unsuccessful prohibition candidate for mayor in 1885.

Having himself lacked a formal education, Donaghey worked diligently to bring institutions of higher learning to Conway. He served on the boards of Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Hendrix College (to which he donated $75,000 in 1910), the University of Central Arkansas, State Normal School (where he was the principal speaker for its 1908 dedication) and Little Rock Junior College (both now part of University of Central Arkansas) in Conway, where his service extended from 1906 until his death. Additionally, he gave generously to both institutions.

==Business==
Donaghey entered business as a contractor and constructed courthouses in Texas and Arkansas, including the first bank building in Conway in 1890. Shortly afterward, he detoured into the mercantile business—for his contracting business was not profitable in its early years—and suffered significant losses after building the second Faulkner County courthouse. When he returned, he reconstructed the Arkansas Insane Asylum after a tornado in 1894. He built ice plants and roads in Arkansas, and water tanks and railroad stations for the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad, and often invested in farm and timber land.

In 1899, Donaghey was appointed to the commission tasked with constructing the new state capitol. The project was not complete until a dozen years later; during much of that time Jefferson &quot;Jeff&quot; Davis was state governor and firmly opposed all the new plans. This obstruction impelled Donaghey to enter politics; eventually in 1907 he sought the nomination for governor, in the teeth of opposition from Davis (who had been elected U.S. senator for Arkansas) and Davis&#x27;s ally William F. Kirby.

==As governor==
In 1908, Donaghey won a three-way primary election that broke the hold of Jeff Davis on the Arkansas Democratic Party. He then attained an easy victory in the gubernatorial general election with 106,512 votes, over Republican John I. Worthington (42,979) and Socialist J. Sam Jones (6,537). Worthington had also run in 1906 against Davis. Donaghey had to wait ten months to take office. In the meantime he traveled the country, and as professor Calvin Ledbetter, Jr. of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock points out in his book &quot;The Carpenter from Conway&quot;, Donaghey educated himself for the political office which awaited him. In June 1909, he appointed the fourth and final state capitol commission and hired Cass Gilbert for the architecture project.

Donaghey was reelected in 1910, defeating another Republican, Andrew L. Roland, by 101,612 votes to 38,870. Another 9,196 ballots were cast for the Socialist candidate, Dan Hogan. That same year he negotiated with the Southern Regional Education Board to bring its campaign to Arkansas, which had successful results in the state, and he also supported four agricultural high schools that later formed into Arkansas Tech University, Arkansas State University, Southern Arkansas University and the University of Arkansas at Monticello. His actions in 1910 also included helping to create the Booneville Tuberculosis Sanatorium, thus improving public health; he later also negotiated with the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission to eradicate hookworm. During his term, Arkansas was the first state in the country to require smallpox vaccinations for all schoolchildren and school personnel, and the Crossett malaria control experiment campaigned against the mosquitos. Donaghey&#x27;s achievements included establishment of a new state board of education, support for high schools, and the passage of a law making consolidation easier.

Although several of the prisoners he pardoned from the convict lease program were black, Donaghey still supported segregation. In 1910 at the state Baptist Colored Convention in Little Rock, he said &quot;It is not for any political purpose that I come to talk to you. It is not for the purpose of getting your votes, this you know as well as I do, because your people don&#x27;t vote much. This, perhaps, is best for you. The greatest man in your race [Booker T. Washington] has said that you should keep out of politics and in this I agree with him. I think it is best that you stay out of politics and look after the condition of your people, and in this you have as much as you can do&quot;. In autumn 1911, he appeared with Booker T. Washington at the National Negro Business League and said to an audience of one thousand black men to &quot;not waste their time running around begging for social equality&quot;. &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot; quoted him as saying &quot;You must ride in the last two seats in our street cars; you must not sit in a Pullman car; you must not ride on the same deck, nor eat in the same restaurant, nor drink in the same saloon as me...You are a race of degenerates, your women are lewd and we cannot afford to have our white women and children associate with you&quot;.

Donaghey&#x27;s progressive stance procured passage of the Initiative and Referendum Act by which Arkansans can take governmental matters into their own hands and bypass the state legislature. He recruited William Jennings Bryan to help campaign for the amendment&#x27;s adoption in 1910. Arkansas is the only state in the American South to grant its citizens such power. The initiative, which began in South Dakota, is otherwise particularly known in California and Colorado.

The Donaghey administration focused on roads, public health, and railroads. Donaghey was vehemently opposed to the use of prisoners for contract-leased labor, especially for building railroads. He particularly learned about convict lease while at a Southern governors&#x27; conference in West Virginia in autumn 1912. Unable to get the legislature to abolish the practice, he prior to leaving office pardoned 360 prisoners, 44 in country farms and 316 out of 850 in penitentiaries and 37 percent of the incarcerated population. This left the lease system with insufficient available prisoners for utilization in construction. In 1913, a year after Donaghey left office, the legislature finally ended the practice and a new prison board was formed.

In 1912, he was eager for a third term, hoping to take care of statewide prohibition and the much-needed tax reform, but the legislature rejected his reforms and the electorate rejected his prohibition plans. During his campaign for the third term the state capitol project ran out of money, and Donaghey&#x27;s appropriation plans were not successful. What also helped bring on his defeat was that former governor Jeff Davis and his allies also campaigned for governor, along with emerging powerbroker Joseph Taylor Robinson.

Donaghey was the first Arkansas governor who could indisputably be labeled &#x27;progressive&#x27; but was also within the southern progressive tradition, as well as the first businessman to become governor of Arkansas.

==After being governor==
After his bid for a third term as governor was defeated by Joseph Taylor Robinson in 1912, Donaghey persisted in his quest to complete the Capitol. A critical year was 1913. Senator Jeff Davis died two days into the year. Robinson, by this time state governor, was named by the legislature as Davis&#x27;s successor. J. M. Futtrell, president of the Arkansas Senate, became acting governor. The result was that Futtrell and the Capitol Building Commission asked Donaghey to become a commission member and take charge of completing construction, which he did. The Capitol, valued at more than $300 million today, was completed in 1917 for $2.2 million, ending an 18-year effort. As a hallmark to completion, Donaghey personally built the governor&#x27;s conference table, which sets today as the centerpiece of the governor&#x27;s conference room in the north wing of the Capitol.

As a former governor, Donaghey served on a number of boards and commissions responsible for a variety of tasks such as constructions, education, and charities. He penned the book &quot;Build a State Capitol&quot;, which details the construction of the Arkansas capitol building.

Donaghey died from a heart attack in Little Rock in 1937, and is interred there at the Roselawn Memorial Park Cemetery. His estate is managed by George W. Donaghey Foundation in Little Rock.

Former Arkansas Governor (1949–1953) Sid McMath said in his memoir &quot;Promises Kept: a Memoir&quot; that Donaghey was &quot;without a doubt, one of the great governors of Arkansas and served as an inspiration to my administration and to others, particularly in the continuing struggle for human rights, and I decided to continue what he had begun&quot;. One book called him &quot;arguably one of the best and most influential governors and philanthropists in Arkansas history&quot;.

In 1999, the &quot;Log Cabin Democrat&quot; named him one of the ten most influential people in Faulkner County&#x27;s history.

==Donaghey&#x27;s Monument==
In 1931, Donaghey, who felt a kinship to both Arkansas and Louisiana, established a monument at the Union Parish/Union County state line near his birthplace. The Art Deco-style monument contains intricate carvings; it includes references to transportation in 1831 and 1931, and mentions Governor Huey P. Long, Jr., whose educational program Donaghey admired. The land was not registered with state parks offices in either state, timber companies cut trees around it, and the marker was forgotten.

In 1975, an employee of the Louisiana Department of Transportation came across the abandoned monument and informed then-State Representative Louise B. Johnson of Bernice of his discovery.

The Monument was dedicated in 1933; Donaghey died four years later. At one time there were plans for a Donaghey State Park, but these were never implemented.

<text>DirectBand was a North American wireless datacast network owned and operated by Microsoft. It used FM radio broadcasts in over 100 cities to constantly transmit data to a variety of devices, including portable GPS devices, wristwatches and home weather stations.

== How it works ==
DirectBand used the 67.65 kHz subcarrier leased by Microsoft from commercial radio broadcasters. This subcarrier delivers about 12 kbit/s (net after ECC) of data per tower, for over 100 MB per day per city. Data included traffic, sports, weather, stocks, news, movie times, calendar appointments, and local time.

=== Not like RDS ===
DirectBand did not use the RDS (Radio Data System) subcarrier. RDS is a different system and has much lower data rate (~730 bit/s after ECC, including framing). Its much narrower subcarrier is primarily used for radio station information and traffic. DirectBand and RDS can co-exist on the same FM station.

=== Forward acting error correction ===
Since many DirectBand uses were mobile, and there was no opportunity to request retransmission of a broadcast signal, DirectBand utilized an advanced error-correction strategy that allowed for reconstruction of messages even when sizable portions of the message were lost due to buildings, tunnels or other obstructions of the FM signal. Error correction was 1/2 rate interleaved trellis with time diversity, soft-decision decode. The DirectBand data rate was in excess of 12 kbit/s after ECC.

=== Push network ===
DirectBand was a push network new content was delivered every two minutes. Users pre-selected the virtual channels that they were interested in.

== Receivers ==
There were a variety of DirectBand receivers. All used a small (2.794 mm × 2.794 mm × 860 μm) radio receiver. Some designs added an ARM7-based processor.

The initial DirectBand products were a series of data watches. These had mild success, but never met expectations and production of new watches was discontinued in 2008. Recently, several other applications have surfaced, the most visible being the traffic data/local info market, particularly to auto GPS sets for Garmin and Avis. This competes directly with older RDS-based services, which operate at a substantially lower data rate.

== Microsoft design ==
DirectBand is a product of the Smart Personal Objects Technology (SPOT) team at Microsoft. System hardware was designed for Microsoft by SCA Data Systems of Santa Monica, California. MSN Direct is the consumer brand that Microsoft uses for devices that receive content from the DirectBand network.

== FM subcarrier usage ==

RDS uses a portion of the FM station spectrum immediately above the stereo signal, centered at 57 kHz (the stereo pilot frequency). RDS extends between about 55 and 59 kHz. DirectBand is above RDS, extending from about 59 kHz to 75 kHz.
== Shutdown ==
On October 26, 2009, Microsoft announced that MSN Direct service would end on January 1, 2012.

Although this clearly indicated Microsoft&#x27;s intent to cease usage of the service, it is not yet known whether the DirectBand technology will be sold to another company, such as one of the hardware licensees of MSN Direct (e.g. Garmin) or whether the technology will be put in the public domain as an open source technology.

<doc id="304711" wikidata="Q2086683" url="?curid=304711" title="John Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland">
<text>John James Robert Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland, (13 December 18184 August 1906), known as Lord John Manners before 1888, was a British .

==Youth and poetry==
Rutland was born at Belvoir Castle, the younger son of John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland, by Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle. Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland, was his elder brother and Lord George Manners his younger brother. He was educated at Eton College, then entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1836. At Cambridge, he was a member of the University Pitt Club. He graduated MA in 1839, and was later awarded the honorary degrees of LLD by the same university in 1862, and DCL by Oxford in 1876.

He wrote two books of poetry: &quot;England&#x27;s Trust and Other Poems&quot;, published in 1841, and &quot;English Ballads and Other Poems&quot;, published in 1850. The 1841 book contains his famous quote: &quot;Let wealth and commerce, laws and learning die, But leave us still our old Nobility!&quot; The 1850 book contains his poem &quot;A Legend of Haddon Hall.&quot;

==Political career==
In 1841 Rutland was returned for Newark in the Tory interest, along with William Ewart Gladstone, and sat for that borough until 1847. Subsequently, he sat for Colchester, 1850–57; for North Leicestershire, 1857–85; and for Melton from 1885 until, in 1888, he took his seat in the House of Lords upon succeeding to the dukedom.

===Young England===
In the early 1840s, Manners was a leading figure in the Young England movement, led by Benjamin Disraeli. This party sought to reduce the predominance of the middle class &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;, and to re-create the political prestige of the aristocracy by proving its capacity to ameliorate the social, intellectual, and material condition of the peasantry and the labouring classes. At the same time its members looked for a regeneration of the Church, and the rescue of both the Church and Ireland from the troubles inherited from the Whig predominance of the 18th century. Manners made an extensive tour of inspection in the industrial parts of northern England, in the course of which he and his friend George Smythe, later 7th Viscount Strangford, gave well-received speeches. In 1843 he supported Lord Grey&#x27;s motion for an inquiry into the condition of England, the serious disaffection of the working classes of the north being a subject to which he was constantly drawing the attention of parliament. Among other measures that he urged were the disestablishment of the Irish Church, the modification of the Statutes of Mortmain, and the resumption of regular diplomatic relations with the Vatican. In the same year he issued in pamphlet form a strong &quot;Plea for National Holydays&quot;.

In 1844 Lord John vigorously supported the Factories Act (&quot;Ten-hours Bill&quot;), which, though strongly opposed by Manchester representatives, was ultimately passed in May 1847. In October 1844 he took part in, and spoke at, the &quot;soirée&quot; held at the Manchester Athenaeum under the presidency of Disraeli. A few days later, he and his friends attended a festival at Bingley, in Yorkshire, to celebrate the allotment of land for gardens to working men, a step which, through the agency of his father, he had done a great deal to further.

However, divergences of opinion starting in 1845 eventually led to the disruption of the movement.

===Cabinet===
During the three short administrations of Lord Derby (1852, 1858–59, and 1866–68) he sat in the cabinet as First Commissioner of Works. In 1852 he was admitted to the Privy Council. On the return of the Conservatives to power in 1874, he became Postmaster-General under Disraeli, and was made GCB on his retirement in 1880. He was again Postmaster-General in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s administration, 1885–86, and was head of the department when sixpenny telegrams were introduced. Finally, in the Conservative government of 1886–92 he was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1891. In 1896 he was created Baron Roos of Belvoir, in the County of Leicester, when his son Henry Manners was summoned to the House of Lords by a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s title of Baron Manners.

He was patron of Saint Martin&#x27;s League for letter carriers.

==Sporting interests==
He had a sympathetic interest in the Olympian Games movement of William Penny Brookes, first shown when he joined a party with his first cousin Lord Forester that viewed the first Wenlock Olympian Games at Much Wenlock in 1850. He there and then donated a cash prize of £1 (worth approximately £80 in 2017) to the committee, who awarded it to the winner of a running race. He was a member of the council of the fourth National Olympian Games that were held, again at Much Wenlock, in 1874. In 1883 he was president of Wenlock Olympian Games themselves that year.

==Family==

Rutland married firstly Catherine Louisa Georgina, daughter of Colonel George Marlay and Catherine Louisa Tisdall, and granddaughter of George Marlay, Bishop of Dromore, in 1851. They had two children: 
*Henry John Brinsley Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland (1852–1925)
*Edith Katharine Mary Manners (12 March 1854 – 24 March 1854), died in infancy

His wife died 7 April 1854, aged 23, from childbirth complications, weeks after giving birth to a daughter, Edith, who lived only 12 days. She was buried with her infant daughter in Highgate Cemetery.

Rutland married secondly Janetta Hughan, daughter of Thomas Hughan, in 1862. They had seven children, including:
*Lord Edward William John Manners (1864–1903)
*Lady Katherine Selina Janetta Manners (1866–1900)
*Lord Cecil Reginald John Manners (1868–1945)
*Lieutenant Colonel Lord Robert William Orlando Manners (1870–1917), an officer in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps. This son was killed while commanding 10th Bn. Northumberland Fusiliers during the Great War. He was awarded the Order of St Michael and St George and the Distinguished Service Order. He is buried in The Huts Cemetery, six kilometres southwest of Ypres. He married in 1902 Mildred Mary Buckworth, daughter of Rev. Charles P. Buckworth and widow of a fellow KRRC-officer Major Henry Buchanan-Riddell.
*Lady Victoria Alexandrina Elizabeth Dorothy Manners (1876–1933)
*Lady Elizabeth Emily Manners (1878–1924), who in 1903 married Lord George Scott

His second family also had a Scottish property: St Mary&#x27;s Tower in Dunkeld.

Rutland succeeded to the dukedom of Rutland in March 1888, upon the death of his elder brother. The Duchess of Rutland died in July 1899. Rutland survived her by seven years and died on 4 August 1906, aged 87, at Belvoir Castle.

<text>A Bob (contraction of &quot;Blitter object&quot;) is a graphical element (GEL) used by the Amiga computer. Bobs are hardware sprite-like objects, movable on the screen with the help of the blitter coprocessor.

The AmigaOS GEL system consists of VSprites, Bobs, AnimComps (&quot;animation components&quot;) and AnimObs (&quot;animation objects&quot;), each extending the preceding with additional functionality. While VSprites are a virtualization of hardware sprites Bobs are drawn into a playfield by the blitter, saving and restoring the background of the GEL as required. The Bob with the highest video priority is the last one to be drawn, which makes it appear to be in front of all other Bobs.

In contrast to hardware sprites Bobs are not limited in size and number. Bobs require more processing power than sprites, because they require at least one DMA memory copy operation to draw them on the screen. Sometimes three distinct memory copy operations are needed: one to save the screen area where the Bob would be drawn, one to actually draw the Bob, and one later to restore the screen background when the Bob moves away.

An AnimComp adds animation to a Bob and an AnimOb groups AnimComps together and assigns them velocity and acceleration.

<text>Aileen LeBell Eaton (February 5, 1909 – November 7, 1987) was an American boxing and professional wrestling promoter who was influential in the United States&#x27; west coast&#x27;s boxing and wrestling scene for five decades. In 2002, she was the first woman inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

Eaton was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She attended Los Angeles High School.

Her second husband, Cal Eaton, was a boxing promoter in Los Angeles. She got involved in her husband&#x27;s business in 1942. During her career as a promoter, Eaton would get involved with big-name promoters and fighters, sometimes traveling to other states in search of business. Eaton is the mother of martial artist and professional wrestler Gene LeBell and professional wrestling promoter Mike LeBell.

Eaton appeared as a contestant on the panel game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; on October 22, 1961. A panel of Arlene Francis, Barry Nelson, Dorothy Kilgallen and Bennett Cerf was unable to guess Eaton&#x27;s occupation as a boxing promoter.

Cal died in 1966. Nicknamed &quot;The Redhead&quot;, Eaton took over presidency of her husband&#x27;s company and went on to stage more than 10,000 boxing bouts and as many wrestling matches at the L.A. Olympic Auditorium, promoting such fighters as Floyd Patterson, Danny Lopez, Carlos Palomino, Joe Frazier and George Foreman before she retired in 1980. When alongside her husband, she had also helped promote fights of Sugar Ray Robinson and Carmen Basilio, among others.

Eaton died in November 7, 1987 after a being sick for a long time.

In 1994, she was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. Eaton was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2002, the first woman in the hall. In 2011, Eaton, along with her sons Gene and Mike LeBell, was inducted into National Wrestling Alliance&#x27;s Hall of Fame. She was posthumously inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2017.
