<text>The 1911 Revolution, also known as the Xinhai Revolution or Hsinhai Revolution, ended China&#x27;s last imperial dynasty, the Qing dynasty, and led to the establishment of the Republic of China (ROC). The revolution was the culmination of a decade of agitation, revolts, and uprisings. Its success marked the collapse of the Chinese monarchy, the end of over two millennia of imperial rule in China and the 200-year reign of the Qing, and the beginning of China&#x27;s early republican era.

The Qing had struggled for a long time to reform the government and resist foreign aggression, but the program of reforms after 1900 was opposed by conservatives in the Qing court as too radical and by reformers as too slow. Several factions, including underground anti-Qing groups, revolutionaries in exile, reformers who wanted to save the monarchy by modernizing it, and activists across the country debated how or whether to overthrow the Qing dynasty. The flash-point came on 10 October 1911, with the Wuchang Uprising, an armed rebellion among members of the New Army. Similar revolts then broke out spontaneously around the country, and revolutionaries in all provinces of the country renounced the Qing dynasty. On 1 November 1911, the Qing court appointed Yuan Shikai (leader of the Beiyang Army) as prime minister, and he began negotiations with the revolutionaries.

In Nanjing, revolutionary forces created a provisional coalition government. On 1 January 1912, the National Assembly declared the establishment of the Republic of China, with Sun Yat-sen, leader of the Tongmenghui, as President of the Republic of China. A brief civil war between the North and the South ended in compromise. Sun would resign in favor of Yuan, who would become President of the new national government, if Yuan could secure the abdication of the Qing emperor. The edict of abdication of the six-year-old Xuantong Emperor, was promulgated on 12 February 1912. Yuan was sworn in as president on 10 March 1912.

In December 1915, Yuan restored the monarchy and proclaimed himself as the Hongxian Emperor, but the move was met with strong opposition from the population and the Army, leading to his abdication in March 1916 and the reinstatement of the Republic. Yuan&#x27;s failure to consolidate a legitimate central government before his death in June 1916 led to decades of political division and warlordism, including an attempt at imperial restoration of the Qing dynasty.

The name &quot;Xinhai Revolution&quot; is derived from the traditional Chinese calendar, where &quot;Xinhai&quot; () is the label corresponding to 1911 according to the sexagenary cycle. The governments of Taiwan and China both consider themselves the legitimate successors to the 1911 Revolution and honor the ideals of the revolution including nationalism, republicanism, modernization of China and national unity. 10 October is the National Day of the Republic of China on Taiwan, and the Anniversary of the 1911 Revolution in the PRC.


== Background ==


After suffering its first defeat by the West in the First Opium War in 1842, a conservative court culture constrained efforts to reform and did not want to cede authority to local officials. Following defeat in the Second Opium War in 1860, the Qing began efforts to modernize by adopting Western technologies through the Self-Strengthening Movement. In the wars against the Taiping (1851–1864), Nian (1851–1868), Yunnan (1856–1873) and Dungan (1862–1877), the court came to rely on armies raised by local officials. After a generation of relative success in importing Western naval and weapons technology, defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 was all the more humiliating and convinced many of the need for institutional change. The court established the New Army under Yuan Shikai and many concluded that Chinese society also needed to be modernized if technological and commercial advancements were to succeed.

In 1898, the Guangxu Emperor turned to reformers like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao who offered a program inspired in large part by the reforms in Japan. They proposed basic reform in education, military, and economy in the so-called Hundred Days&#x27; Reform. The reform was abruptly canceled by a conservative coup led by Empress Dowager Cixi. The Emperor was put under house arrest in June 1898, where he remained until his death in 1908. Reformers Kang and Liang exiled themselves to avoid being executed. The Empress Dowager controlled policy until her death in 1908, with support from officials such as Yuan. Attacks on foreigners and Chinese Christians in the Boxer Rebellion, encouraged by the Empress Dowager, prompted another foreign invasion of Beijing in 1900.

After the Allies imposed a punitive settlement, the Qing court carried out basic fiscal and administrative reforms, including local and provincial elections. These moves did not secure trust or wide support among political activists. Many, like Zou Rong, felt strong anti-Manchu prejudice and blamed them for China&#x27;s troubles. Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao formed the Emperor Protection Society in an attempt to restore the emperor, but others, such as Sun Yat-sen organized revolutionary groups to overthrow the dynasty rather than reform it. They could operate only in secret societies and underground organizations, in foreign concessions, or exile overseas, but created a following among Chinese in North America and Southeast Asia, and within China, even in the new armies. The famine in 1906 and 1907 was also a major contributor to the revolution. Following the death of the Guangxu Emperor and Cixi in 1908, the throne was inherited by the two-year-old Xuantong Emperor, with Prince Chun as a regent. The Prince continued the reform path of Cixi, but conservative Manchu elements in the court opposed it, causing further support for revolutionaries.

== Organization ==
=== Earliest groups ===
Many revolutionaries and groups wanted to overthrow the Qing government to re-establish the Han-led government. The earliest revolutionary organizations were founded outside of China, such as Yeung Ku-wan&#x27;s Furen Literary Society, created in Hong Kong in 1890. There were 15 members, including Tse Tsan-tai, who did political satire such as &quot;The Situation in the Far East&quot;, one of the first manhua, and who later became one of the core founders of the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;.

Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Revive China Society was established in Honolulu in 1894, with the main purpose of raising funds for revolutions. The two organizations merged in 1894.

=== Smaller groups ===
The Huaxinghui (China Revival Society) was founded in 1904 by notables like Huang Xing, Zhang Shizhao, Chen Tianhua, Sun Yat-sen, and Song Jiaoren, along with 100 others. Their motto was &quot;Take one province by force, and inspire the other provinces to rise&quot;.

The Guangfuhui (Restoration Society) was also founded in 1904, in Shanghai, by Cai Yuanpei. Other notable members include Zhang Binglin and Tao Chengzhang. Despite professing the anti-Qing cause, the Guangfuhui was highly critical of Sun Yat-sen. One of the most famous female revolutionaries was Qiu Jin, who fought for women&#x27;s rights and was also from Guangfuhui.

Gelaohui (Elder Brother Society) was another group, with Zhu De, Wu Yuzhang, Liu Zhidan () and He Long. This revolutionary group would eventually develop a strong link with the later Communist Party.
=== Tongmenghui ===
Sun Yat-sen successfully united the Revive China Society, Huaxinghui and Guangfuhui in the summer of 1905, thereby establishing the unified Tongmenghui (United League) in August 1905 in Tokyo. While it started in Tokyo, it had loose organizations distributed across and outside the country. Sun Yat-sen was the leader of this unified group. Other revolutionaries who worked with the Tongmenghui include Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin. When the Tongmenghui was established, more than 90% of the Tongmenghui members were between 17 and 26 years of age. Some of the work in the era includes manhua publications such as the &quot;Journal of Current Pictorial&quot;.

=== Later groups ===
In February 1906, Rizhihui () also had many revolutionaries, including Sun Wu (), Zhang Nanxian (), He Jiwei and Feng Mumin. A nucleus of attendees at this conference evolved into the Tongmenghui&#x27;s establishment in Hubei.

In July 1907, several members of Tongmenghui in Tokyo advocated a revolution in the area of the Yangtze. Liu Quiyi (), Jiao Dafeng (), Zhang Boxiang () and Sun Wu () established the Gongjinhui (). In January 1911, the revolutionary group Zhengwu Xueshe (振武學社) was renamed as Wenxueshe (Literary Society) (). Jiang Yiwu () was chosen as the leader. These two organizations would play a big role in the Wuchang Uprising.

Many young revolutionaries adopted the anarchist program. In Tokyo, Liu Shipei proposed to overthrow the Manchus and return to Chinese classical values. In Paris, well-connected young intellectuals, Li Shizhen, Wu Zhihui and Zhang Renjie, agreed with Sun&#x27;s revolutionary program and joined the Tongmenghui, but argued that simply replacing one government with another would not be progress; fundamental cultural change, a revolution in family, gender and social values, would remove the need for government and coercion. Zhang Ji and Wang Jingwei were among the anarchists who defended assassination and terrorism as means to awaken the people to revolution, but others insisted that education was the only justifiable strategy. Important anarchists included Cai Yuanpei. Zhang Renjie gave Sun major financial help. Many of these anarchists would later assume high positions in the Kuomintang (KMT).

=== Views ===
Many revolutionaries promoted anti-Qing/anti-Manchu sentiments and revived memories of conflict between the ethnic minority Manchu and the ethnic majority Han Chinese from the late Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Leading intellectuals were influenced by books that had survived from the final years of the Ming dynasty, the last dynasty of Han Chinese. In 1904, Sun Yat-sen announced that his organization&#x27;s goal was &quot;to expel the Tatar barbarians, to revive Zhonghua, to establish a Republic, and to distribute land equally among the people.&quot; (). Many underground groups promoted the ideas of &quot;Resist Qing and restore Ming&quot; (反清復明) that had been around since the days of the Taiping Rebellion. Others, such as Zhang Binglin, spread calls to &quot;slay the Manchus&quot; () and the concept of &quot;Anti-Manchuism&quot; ().

== Society and class ==
Many groups supported the 1911 Revolution, including students and intellectuals returning from abroad, as well as participants of revolutionary organizations, overseas Chinese, soldiers of the new army, local gentry, farmers, and others.

===Overseas Chinese===
Assistance from overseas Chinese was important in the 1911 Revolution. In 1894, the first year of the Revive China Society, the first meeting ever held by the group was held in the home of Ho Fon, an overseas Chinese who was the leader of the first Chinese Church of Christ. Overseas Chinese supported and actively participated in funding revolutionary activities, especially the Southeast Asian Chinese of British Malaya. Many of these groups were reorganized by Sun, who was referred to as the &quot;father of the Chinese revolution&quot;.

=== Emerging intellectual class ===
The Qing government established new schools and encouraged students to study abroad as part of the Self-Strengthening movement. Many young people attended the new schools or went abroad to study in places like Japan. A new progressive class of intellectuals emerged from those students, who contributed immensely to the 1911 Revolution. Besides Sun Yat-sen, key figures in the revolution, such as Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, Hu Hanmin, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin and Wang Jingwei, were all Chinese students in Japan. Some were young students like Zou Rong, known for writing &quot;Revolutionary Army&quot;, a book in which he talked about the extermination of the Manchus for the 260 years of oppression, sorrow, cruelty, and tyranny, and creating new revolutionary Han figures.

Before 1908, revolutionaries focused on coordinating these organizations in preparation for uprisings they would launch; hence, these groups would provide most of the manpower needed for the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. After the 1911 Revolution, Sun Yat-sen recalled the days of recruiting support for the revolution and said, &quot;The literati were deeply into the search for honors and profits, so they were regarded as having only secondary importance. By contrast, organizations like Sanhehui were able to sow widely the ideas of resisting the Qing and restoring the Ming.&quot;

=== Gentry and businessmen ===
The gentry&#x27;s strength in local politics became apparent. From December 1908, the Qing government created some apparatus to allow the gentry and businessmen to participate in politics. These middle-class people were originally supporters of constitutionalism. However, they became disenchanted when the Qing government created a cabinet with Prince Qing as prime minister. By early 1911, an experimental cabinet had thirteen members, nine of whom were Manchus selected from the imperial family.

=== Foreign supporters ===
Besides Chinese and overseas Chinese, some supporters and participants of the 1911 Revolution were foreigners; among them, the Japanese were the most active group. Some Japanese even became members of Tongmenghui. Miyazaki Touten was the closest Japanese supporter; others included Heiyama Shu and Ryōhei Uchida. Homer Lea, an American, who became Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s closest foreign advisor in 1910, supported Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s military ambitions. British soldier Rowland J. Mulkern also took part in the revolution. Some foreigners, such as English explorer Arthur de Carle Sowerby, led expeditions to rescue foreign missionaries in 1911 and 1912.

The far right-wing Japanese ultra-nationalist Black Dragon Society supported Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s activities against the Manchus, believing that overthrowing the Qing would help the Japanese take over the Manchu homeland and that Han Chinese would not oppose the takeover. Toyama believed that the Japanese could easily take over Manchuria and that Sun Yat-sen and other anti-Qing revolutionaries would not resist and help the Japanese take over and enlarge the opium trade in China, while the Qing was trying to destroy the opium trade. The Japanese Black Dragons supported Sun Yat-sen and anti-Manchu revolutionaries until the Qing collapsed. The far right-wing Japanese ultranationalist Gen&#x27;yōsha leader Tōyama Mitsuru supported anti-Manchu, anti-Qing revolutionary activities including the ones organized by Sun and supported Japanese taking over Manchuria. The anti-Qing Tongmenghui was founded and based in exile in Japan where many anti-Qing revolutionaries gathered.

The Japanese had been trying to unite anti-Manchu groups made out of Han people to take down the Qing. The Japanese were the ones who helped Sun Yat-sen unite all anti-Qing, anti-Manchu revolutionary groups together, and there were Japanese like Tōten Miyazaki inside of the anti-Manchu Tongmenghui revolutionary alliance. The Black Dragon Society hosted the Tongmenghui in its first meeting. The Black Dragon Society had very intimate, long term and influential relations with Sun Yat-sen who sometimes passed himself off as Japanese. According to an American military historian, Japanese military officers were part of the Black Dragon Society. The Yakuza and Black Dragon Society helped arrange in Tokyo for Sun Yat-sen to hold the first Kuomintang meetings, and were hoping to flood China with opium and overthrow the Qing and deceive the Chinese into overthrowing the Qing to Japan&#x27;s benefit. After the revolution was successful, the Japanese Black Dragons started infiltrating China and spreading opium. The Black Dragons pushed for the takeover of Manchuria by Japan in 1932. Sun Yat-sen was married to a Japanese woman, Kaoru Otsuki.

=== Soldiers of the New Armies ===
The New Army was formed in 1901 after the defeat of the Qing in the First Sino-Japanese War. They were launched by a decree from eight provinces. New Army troops were by far the best trained and equipped. Recruits were of a higher quality than the old army and received regular promotions. Beginning in 1908, the revolutionaries began to shift their call to the new armies. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionaries infiltrated the New Army.

== Prelude ==
The central foci of the uprisings were mostly connected with the Tongmenghui and Sun Yat-sen, including subgroups. Some uprisings involved groups that never merged with the Tongmenghui. Sun Yat-sen may have participated in 8–10 uprisings; all uprisings failed before the Wuchang Uprising.
=== First Guangzhou Uprising ===
In the spring of 1895, the Revive China Society, based in Hong Kong, planned the . Lu Haodong was tasked with designing the revolutionaries&#x27; Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. On 26 October 1895, Yeung Ku-wan and Sun Yat-sen led Zheng Shiliang and Lu Haodong to Guangzhou, preparing to capture Guangzhou in one strike. However, the details of their plans were leaked to the Qing government. The government began to arrest revolutionaries, including Lu Haodong, who was later executed. The First Guangzhou Uprising was a failure. Under pressure from the Qing government, the government of Hong Kong banned the two men from the territory for five years. Sun Yat-sen went into exile, promoting the Chinese revolution and raising funds in Japan, the United States, Canada, and Britain. In 1901, following the Huizhou Uprising, Yeung Ku-wan was assassinated by Qing agents in Hong Kong. After his death, his family protected his identity by not putting his name on his tomb, just the number &quot;6348&quot;.

=== Independence Army Uprising ===
In 1900, after the Boxer Rebellion started, Tang Caichang () and Tan Sitong of the previous Foot Emancipation Society organized the Independence Army. The Independence Army Uprising () was planned to occur on 23 August 1900. Their goal was to overthrow Empress Dowager Cixi to establish a constitutional monarchy under the Guangxu Emperor. Their plot was discovered by the governors-general of Hunan and Hubei. About twenty conspirators were arrested and executed.

=== Huizhou Uprising ===
On 8 October 1900, Sun Yat-sen ordered the launch of the Huizhou Uprising (). The revolutionary army was led by Zheng Shiliang and initially included 20,000 men, who fought for half a month. However, after Japanese prime minister Hirobumi Ito prohibited Sun Yat-sen from carrying out revolutionary activities on Taiwan, Zheng Shiliang had no choice but to order the army to disperse. Accordingly, this uprising also failed. British soldier Rowland J. Mulkern participated in this uprising.
=== Great Ming Uprising ===

A very short uprising occurred from 25 to 28 January 1903, to establish a &quot;Great Ming Heavenly Kingdom&quot; (). This involved Tse Tsan-tai, Li Jitang (), Liang Muguang () and Hong Quanfu (), who formerly took part in the Jintian uprising during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era.

=== Ping-liu-li Uprising ===
Ma Fuyi () and Huaxinghui was involved in an uprising in the three areas of Pingxiang, Liuyang and Liling, called &quot;Ping-liu-li Uprising&quot;, () in 1905. The uprising recruited miners as early as 1903 to rise against the Qing ruling class. After the uprising failed, Ma Fuyi was executed.

=== Beijing assassination attempt ===
Wu Yue ( of the Guangfuhui carried out an assassination attempt at the Beijing Zhengyangmen East Railway station () in an attack on five Qing officials on 24 September 1905.

=== Huanggang Uprising, Chaozhou ===
The Huanggang Uprising () was launched on 22 May 1907, in Chaozhou. The revolutionary party, along with Xu Xueqiu (), Chen Yongpo () and Yu Tongshi (), launched the uprising and captured Huanggang city. After the uprising began, the Qing government quickly and forcefully suppressed it. Around 200 revolutionaries were killed.

=== Huizhou Qinühu Uprising, Huizhou ===
In the same year, Sun Yat-sen sent more revolutionaries to Huizhou to launch the &quot;Huizhou Qinühu Uprising&quot; (). On 2 June, Deng Zhiyu () and Chen Chuan () gathered some followers, and together they seized Qing arms in the lake, from Huizhou. They killed several Qing soldiers and attacked Taiwei () on 5 June. The Qing army fled in disorder, and the revolutionaries exploited the opportunity, capturing several towns. They defeated the Qing army once again in Bazhiyie. Many organizations voiced their support after the uprising, and the number of revolutionary forces increased to two hundred men at its height. The uprising, however, ultimately failed.

=== Anqing Uprising ===
On 6 July 1907, Xu Xilin of Guangfuhui led an uprising in Anqing, Anhui, which became known as the Anqing Uprising (. Xu Xilin at the time was the police commissioner as well as the supervisor of the police academy. He led an uprising that aimed to assassinate the provincial governor of Anhui, En Ming (). They were defeated after four hours of fighting. Xu was captured, and En Ming&#x27;s bodyguards cut out his heart and liver and ate them. His cousin Qiu Jin was executed a few days later.

=== Qinzhou Uprising ===
From August to September 1907, the Qinzhou Uprising occurred (欽州防城起義), to protest against heavy taxation from the government. Sun Yat-sen sent Wang Heshun () there to assist the revolutionary army and captured the county in September. After that, they attempted to besiege and capture Qinzhou but were unsuccessful. They eventually retreated to the area of Shiwandashan, while Wang Heshun returned to Vietnam.

=== Zhennanguan Uprising ===
On 1 December 1907, the Zhennanguan Uprising () took place at Zhennanguan along the Chinese-Vietnamese border. Sun Yat-sen sent Huang Mintang () to monitor the pass, which was guarded by a fort. With the assistance of supporters among the fort&#x27;s defenders, the revolutionaries captured the cannon tower in Zhennanguan. Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing and Hu Hanmin personally went to the tower to command the battle. The Qing government sent troops led by Long Jiguang and Lu Rongting to counterattack, and the revolutionaries were forced to retreat into the mountainous areas. After this uprising&#x27;s failure, Sun was forced to move to Singapore due to anti-Sun sentiments within the revolutionary groups. He would not return to the mainland until after the Wuchang Uprising.

=== Qin-Lian Uprising, Guangdong ===
On 27 March 1908, Huang Xing launched a raid, later known as the Qin-lian Uprising (), from a base in Vietnam and attacked the cities of Qinzhou and Lianzhou in Guangdong. The struggle continued for fourteen days but was forced to stop after the revolutionaries ran out of supplies.

=== Hekou Uprising, Yunnan ===
In April 1908, another uprising was launched in Yunnan, Hekou, called the Hekou Uprising (). Huang Mingtang () led two hundred men from Vietnam and attacked Hekou on 30 April. Other participating revolutionaries included Wang Heshun () and Guan Renfu (). They were outnumbered and defeated by government troops, however, and the uprising failed.

=== Mapaoying Uprising, Anhui ===
On 19 November 1908, the Mapaoying Uprising () was launched by revolutionary group Yuewanghui () member Xiong Chenggei ( in Anhui. Yuewanghui, at this time, was a subset of Tongmenghui. This uprising also failed.

=== Guangzhou ===

In February 1910, the Gengxu New Army Uprising (), also known as the Guangzhou New Army Uprising (), took place. This involved a conflict between the citizens and local police against the New Army. After revolutionary leader Ni Yingdian was killed by Qing forces, the remaining revolutionaries were quickly defeated, causing the uprising to fail.

On 27 April 1911, an uprising occurred in Guangzhou, known as the Second Guangzhou Uprising () or Yellow Flower Mound Revolt (). It ended in disaster, as 86 bodies were found (only 72 could be identified). The 72 revolutionaries were remembered as martyrs. Revolutionary Lin Juemin was one of the 72. On the eve of battle, he wrote &quot;A Letter to My Wife&quot; (), later to be considered a masterpiece in Chinese literature.

== Wuchang Uprising ==


The Literary Society () and the Progressive Association () were revolutionary organizations involved in the uprising that mainly began with a Railway Protection Movement protest. In the late summer, some Hubei New Army units were ordered to neighboring Sichuan to quell the Railway Protection Movement, a mass protest against the Qing government&#x27;s seizure and handover of local railway development ventures to foreign powers. Banner officers like Duanfang, the railroad superintendent, and Zhao Erfeng led the New Army against the Railway Protection Movement.

The New Army units of Hubei had originally been the Hubei Army, which had been trained by Qing official Zhang Zhidong. On 24 September, the Literary Society and Progressive Association convened a conference in Wuchang, along with sixty representatives from local New Army units. During the conference, they established a headquarters for the uprising. The leaders of the two organizations, Jiang Yiwu () and Sun Wu (), were elected as commander and chief of staff. Initially, the date of the uprising was to be 6 October 1911. It was postponed to a later date due to insufficient preparations.

Revolutionaries intent on overthrowing the Qing dynasty had built bombs, and on 9 October, one accidentally exploded. Sun Yat-sen himself had no direct part in the uprising and was traveling in the United States at the time to recruit more support from among overseas Chinese. The Qing Viceroy of Huguang, Rui Cheng (), tried to track down and arrest the revolutionaries. Squad leader Xiong Bingkun () and others decided not to delay the uprising any longer and launched the revolt on 10 October 1911, at 7:00 p.m. The revolt was a success; the entire city of Wuchang was captured by the revolutionaries on the morning of 11 October. That evening, they established a tactical headquarters and announced the establishment of the &quot;Military Government of Hubei of Republic of China&quot;. The conference chose Li Yuanhong as the governor of the temporary government. Qing officers like the bannermen Duanfang and Zhao Erfeng were killed by the revolutionary forces.

Revolutionaries killed a German arms dealer in Hankou as he was delivering arms to the Qing. Revolutionaries killed 2 Germans and wounded 2 other Germans at the battle of Hanyang, including a former colonel.

== Provincial uprisings ==
After the success of the Wuchang Uprising, many other protests occurred throughout the country for various reasons. Some uprisings declared restoration (光復) of the Han Chinese rule. Other uprisings were a step toward independence, and some were protests or rebellions against the local authorities. Regardless of the reason for the uprising the outcome was that all provinces in the country renounced the Qing dynasty and joined the ROC.

=== Changsha ===
On 22 October 1911, the Hunan Tongmenghui were led by Jiao Dafeng () and Chen Zuoxin (). They headed an armed group, consisting partly of revolutionaries from Hongjiang and partly of defecting New Army units, in a campaign to extend the uprising into Changsha. They captured the city and killed the local Imperial general. Then they announced the establishment of the Hunan Military Government of the Republic of China and announced their opposition to the Qing Empire.

=== Shaanxi ===
On the same day, Shaanxi&#x27;s Tongmenghui, led by Jing Dingcheng () and Qian Ding () as well as Jing Wumu () and others including Gelaohui, launched an uprising and captured Xi&#x27;an after two days of struggle. The Hui Muslim community was divided in its support for the revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries, while the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing. The native Hui of Xi&#x27;an joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the Manchus. The native Hui Muslims of Gansu province led by general Ma Anliang led more than twenty battalions of Hui troops to defend the Qing imperials and attacked Shaanxi, held by revolutionary Zhang Fenghui (). The attack was successful, and after news arrived that Puyi was about to abdicate, Ma agreed to join the new Republic. The revolutionaries established the &quot;Qinlong Fuhan Military Government&quot; and elected Zhang Fenghui, a member of the Yuanrizhi Society (), as new governor. After the Xi&#x27;an Manchu quarter fell on 24 October, Xinhai forces killed all the Manchus in the city, about 20,000 Manchus were killed in the massacre. Many of its Manchu defenders committed suicide, including Qing general Wenrui (), who threw himself down a well. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi&#x27;an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims.

Hui General Ma Anliang abandoned the Qing cause upon the Qing abdication in the Xinhai Revolution while the Manchu governor general Shengyun was enraged at the revolution.

Pro-revolution Hui Muslims like Shaanxi Governor Ma Yugui and Beijing Imam Wang Kuan persuaded Qing Hui general Ma Anliang to stop fighting, telling him as Muslims not to kill each other for the sake of the Qing monarchists and side with the republican revolutionaries instead. Ma Anliang then agreed to abandon the Qing under the combination of Yuan Shikai&#x27;s actions and these messages from other Hui.

A year before the massacre of Manchus in October 1911, an oath against Manchus was sworn at the Great Goose Pagoda in Xi&#x27;an by the Gelaohui in 1911. Manchu banner garrisons were slaughtered in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Taiyuan, Xi&#x27;an and Wuchang The Manchu quarter was located in the north eastern part of Xi&#x27;an and walled off while the Hui Muslim quarter was located in the northwestern part of Xi&#x27;an but did not have walls separating it from the Han parts. Southern Xi&#x27;an was entirely Han. Xi&#x27;an had the biggest Manchu banner garrison quarter by area before its destruction.

The revolutionaries were led by students of the military academy who overcame the guards at the gates of Xi&#x27;an and shut them, secured the arsenal and slaughtering all Manchus at their temple and then storming and slaughtering the Manchus in the Manchu banner quarter of the city. The Manchu quarter was set on fire and many Manchus were burned alive. Manchu men, women and girls were slaughtered for three days and then after that, only Manchu women and girls were spared while Manchu men and boys continued to be slaughtered. Many Manchus committed suicide by overdosing on opium and throwing themselves into wells. The revolutionaries were helped by the fact that Manchus stored gunpowder in their houses so they exploded when set on fire, killing the Manchus inside. 10,000 to 20,000 Manchus were slaughtered.

Ma Anliang was ordered to attack the revolutionaries in Shaanxi by the baoyi bondservant Chang Geng and Manchu Shengyun.

Eastern soldiers of the new republic were mobilized by Yuan Shikai when the attack against Shaanxi began by Ma Anliang, but news of the abdication of the Qing emperor reached Ma Anliang before he attacked Xi&#x27;an, so Ma Anliang ended all military operations and changed his allegiance to the Republic of China. All pro-Qing military activity in the northwest was put to an end by this.

Yuan Shikai managed to induce Ma Anliang to not attack Shaanxi after the Gelaohui took over the province and accept the Republic of China under his presidency in 1912. During the National Protection war in 1916 between republicans and Yuan Shikai&#x27;s monarchy, Ma Anliang readied his soldiers and informed the republicans that he and the Muslims would stick to Yuan Shikai until the end. Yuan Shikai ordered Ma Anliang to block Bai Lang (White Wolf) from going into Sichuan and Gansu by blocking Hanzhong and Fengxiangfu.

The Protestant Shensi mission operated a hospital in Xian. Some American missionaries were reported killed in Xi&#x27;an. A report claimed Manchus massacred missionaries in the suburbs of Xi&#x27;an. Missionaries were reported killed in Xi&#x27;an and Taiyuan. Shaanxi joined the revolution on October 24. Sheng Yun was governor of Shaanxi in 1905.

Some Gansu Hui led by Ma Fuxiang joined the republicans. Gansu Hui general Ma Fuxiang did not participate with Ma Anliang in the battles with Shaanxi revolutionaries and refused to join the Qing Manchu Shengyun and Changgeng in their attempts to defend the Qing before the Qing abdication, instead the independence of Gansu from Qing control was jointly declared by non-Muslim gentry with Hui Muslim Ma Fuxiang.

===Jiujiang===

On 23 October, Lin Sen, Jiang Qun (), Cai Hui () and other members of the Tongmenghui in the province of Jiangxi plotted a revolt of New Army units. A Qing naval fleet also revolted against the state, which solidified victory in the Wuchang Uprising. After they achieved victory, they announced their independence. The Jiujiang Military Government was then established.

===Shanxi===
On 29 October, Yan Xishan of the New Army led an uprising in Taiyuan, the capital city of the province of Shanxi. The rebels in Taiyuan bombarded the streets where Banner people resided and killed all the Manchu. They managed to kill the Qing Governor of Shanxi, Lu Zhongqi (). They then announced the establishment of Shanxi Military Government with Yan Xishan as the military governor.

===Kunming===
On 30 October, Li Genyuan () of the Tongmenghui in Yunnan joined with Cai E, Luo Peijin (), Tang Jiyao, and other officers of the New Army to launch the Double Ninth Uprising (). They captured Kunming the next day and established the Yunnan Military Government, electing Cai E as the military governor.

===Nanchang===
On 31 October, the Nanchang branch of the Tongmenghui led New Army units in a successful uprising. They established the Jiangxi Military Government. Li Liejun was elected as the military governor. Li declared Jiangxi as independent and launched an expedition against Qing official Yuan Shikai.

===Shanghai===
On 3 November, Shanghai&#x27;s Tongmenghui, Guangfuhui and merchants led by Chen Qimei, Li Pingsu (), Zhang Chengyou (), Li Yingshi (), Li Xiehe () and Song Jiaoren organized an armed rebellion in Shanghai. They received support from local police officers. The rebels captured the Jiangnan Workshop on the 4th and captured Shanghai soon after. On 8 November, they established the Shanghai Military Government and elected Chen Qimei as the military governor. He would eventually become one of the founders of the four big families of the Republic of China, along with some of the most well-known families of the era.

=== Guizhou ===
On 4 November, Zhang Bailin () of the revolutionary party in Guizhou led an uprising along with New Army units and students from the military academy. They immediately captured Guiyang and established the Great Han Guizhou Military Government, electing Yang Jincheng () and Zhao Dequan () as the chief and vice governor respectively.

===Zhejiang ===
Also on 4 November, revolutionaries in Zhejiang urged the New Army units in Hangzhou to launch an uprising. Zhu Rui (), Wu Siyu (), Lu Gongwang () and others of the New Army captured the military supplies workshop. Other units, led by Chiang Kai-shek and Yin Zhirei (), captured most of the government offices. Eventually, Hangzhou was under the control of the revolutionaries, and the constitutionalist Tang Shouqian () was elected as the military governor.

===Jiangsu===
On 5 November, Jiangsu constitutionalists and gentry urged Qing governor Cheng Dequan () to announce independence and established the Jiangsu Revolutionary Military Government with Cheng himself as the governor. Unlike some other cities, anti-Manchu violence began after the restoration on 7 November in Zhenjiang. Qing general Zaimu () agreed to surrender, but because of a misunderstanding, the revolutionaries were unaware that their safety was guaranteed. The Manchu quarters were ransacked, and an unknown number of Manchus were killed. Zaimu, feeling betrayed, committed suicide. This is regarded as the Zhenjiang Uprising ().

===Anhui===
Members of Anhui&#x27;s Tongmenghui also launched an uprising on that day and laid siege to the provincial capital. The constitutionalists persuaded Zhu Jiabao, the Qing governor of Anhui, to announce independence.

===Guangxi===
On 7 November, the Guangxi politics department decided to secede from the Qing government, announcing Guangxi&#x27;s independence. Qing Governor Shen Bingkun () was allowed to remain governor, but Lu Rongting would soon become the new governor. Lu Rongting would later rise to prominence during the Warlord Era, and his bandits controlled Guangxi for more than a decade. Under leadership of Huang Shaohong, the Muslim law student Bai Chongxi was enlisted into a Dare to Die unit to fight as a revolutionary.

===Fujian===
In November, members of Fujian&#x27;s branch of the Tongmenghui, along with Sun Daoren () of the New Army, launched an uprising against the Qing army. The Qing viceroy, Song Shou (), committed suicide. On 11 November, the entire Fujian province declared independence. The Fujian Military Government was established, and Sun Daoren was elected as the military governor.

===Guangdong ===
Near the end of October, Chen Jiongming, Deng Keng (), Peng Reihai () and other members of Guangdong&#x27;s Tongmenghui organized local militias to launch the uprising in Huazhou, Nanhai, Sunde and Sanshui in Guangdong Province. On 8 November, after being persuaded by Hu Hanmin, General Li Zhun () and Long Jiguang () of the Guangdong Navy agreed to support the revolution. The Qing viceroy of Liangguang, Zhang Mingqi (), was forced to discuss with local representatives a proposal for Guangdong&#x27;s independence. They decided to announce it the next day. Chen Jiongming then captured Huizhou. On 9 November, Guangdong announced its independence and established a military government. They elected Hu Hanmin and Chen Jiongming as Chief and Vice-Governor. Qiu Fengjia is known to have helped make the independence declaration more peaceful. It was unknown at the time if representatives from the European colonies of Hong Kong and Macau would be ceded to the new government.

=== Shandong ===
On 13 November, after being persuaded by revolutionary Ding Weifen and several other officers of the New Army, the Qing governor of Shandong, Sun Baoqi, agreed to secede from the Qing government and announced Shandong&#x27;s independence.

=== Ningxia ===
On 17 November, Ningxia Tongmenghui launched the Ningxia Uprising (). The revolutionaries sent Yu Youren to Zhangjiachuan to meet Dungan Sufi master Ma Yuanzhang to persuade him not to support the Qing. However, Ma did not want to endanger his relationship with the Qings. He sent the eastern Gansu Muslim militia under the command of one of his sons to help Ma Qi fight the Ningxia Gelaohui. Ma Anliang, Changgeng and Shengyun failed to capture Shaanxi from the revolutionaries. In Ningxia, Qing forces were attacked by both Hui Muslim Gelaohui and Han Gelaohui members, while Hui general Ma Qi and Ma Yuanzhang were in the Qing forces fighting against them but Ma Yuanzhang defected to the republicans after Ma Anliang gave up on the Qing. However, the Ningxia Revolutionary Military Government was established on 23 November. Some revolutionaries involved included Huang Yue () and Xiang Shen (), who gathered New Army forces at Qinzhou ().

=== Sichuan ===
On 21 November, Guang&#x27;an organized the Great Han Shu Northern Military Government.

On 22 November, Chengdu and Sichuan declared independence. By the 27th, the Great Han Sichuan Military Government was established, headed by revolutionary Pu Dianzun (). Qing official Duanfang would also be killed.

=== Nanjing ===
On 8 November, supported by the Tongmenghui, Xu Shaozhen () of the New Army announced an uprising in Molin Pass (), away from Nanjing. Xu Shaozhen, Chen Qimei and other generals decided to form a united army under Xu to strike Nanjing together. On 11 November, the united army headquarters was established in Zhenjiang. Between 24 November and 1 December, under the command of Xu Shaozhen, the united army captured Wulongshan (), Mufushan (), Yuhuatai (), Tianbao () among other Qing army strongholds. On 2 December, Nanjing was captured by the revolutionaries after the Battle of Nanjing, 1911. On 3 December, revolutionary Su Liangbi led troops in a massacre of a large number of Manchus. Shortly afterward he was arrested and his troops disbanded.

=== Dihua and Yili Uprising ===
In Xinjiang on 28 December, Liu Xianzun () and revolutionaries started the Dihua Uprising (). This was led by more than 100 members of Gelaohui. This uprising failed. On 7 January 1912, the Yili Uprising () with began. Qing governor (袁大化) fled and submitted his resignation to Yang Zengxin, because he could not handle fighting the revolutionaries.

On 8 January, a new Yili government was established for the revolutionaries. Today some Chinese historians believe this contributed to the Qing dynasty fall, because this prevented the Qing dynasty&#x27;s plan to flee to the western country. The revolutionaries would be defeated at Jinghe in January and February, eventually, because of the abdication to come, Yuan Shikai recognized Yang Zengxin&#x27;s rule, appointed him Governor of Xinjiang and had the province join the Republic. Eleven more former Qing officials would be assassinated in Zhenxi, Karashahr, Aksu, Kucha, Luntai and Kashgar in April and May 1912.

The revolutionaries printed new multi-lingual media.

== Territorial uprisings ==
=== Tibet ===

In 1905, the Qing sent Zhao Erfeng to Tibet to retaliate against rebellions. By 1908, Zhao was appointed imperial resident in Lhasa. Zhao was beheaded in December 1911 by pro-Republican forces. The bulk of the area historically known as Kham was now claimed to be the Xikang Administrative District, created by the Republican revolutionaries. By the end of 1912, the last Qing troops were forced out of Tibet through India. Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama, returned to Tibet in January 1913 from Sikkim, where he had been residing. When the new ROC government apologized for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama to his former position, he replied he was not interested in Chinese ranks, that Tibet had never been subordinated to China, that Tibet was an independent country, and that he was assuming the spiritual and political leadership of Tibet. Because of this, many have read this reply as a formal declaration of independence. The Chinese side ignored the response, and Tibet had thirty years free of interference from China until 1951 and now Tibet is still ruled by China.

=== Outer Mongolia ===

At the end of 1911, Outer Mongolians took action with an armed revolt against Qing authorities but were unsuccessful. The independence movement that took place was not limited to just Outer Mongolia but was a pan-Mongolian phenomenon. On 29 December 1911, Bogd Khan became the ruler of the Bogd Khanate. Inner Mongolia became a contested terrain between the Bogd Khanate and China. In general, Russia supported the independence of Outer Mongolia (including Tannu Uriankhai) during the time of the 1911 Revolution.

Tibet and Outer Mongolia then recognized each other in a treaty. In 1919, the Republic of China regained Outer Mongolia but then lost it again in 1921. The People&#x27;s Republic of China, a member of the United Nations, has officially recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia since 1949. Taiwan opened a cultural representative office and economy as part of their recognition of Mongolia in 2002.

===Tannu Uriankhai secession===
==Change of government==
===North: Qing Court final transformation attempt===
On 1 November 1911, the Qing government appointed Yuan Shikai as Prime Minister of the imperial cabinet, replacing Prince Qing. On 3 November, after a proposition by Cen Chunxuan from the , the Qing court passed the Nineteen Articles, which turned the Qing from an autocratic system with the emperor having unlimited power to a constitutional monarchy. On 9 November, Huang Xing even cabled Yuan Shikai and invited him to join the Republic. The court changes were too late, and the emperor was about to have to step down.

===South: Provisional Government in Nanking===
On 28 November 1911, Wuchang and Hanyang had fallen back to the Qing army. For safety, the revolutionaries convened their first conference at the British Concession in Hankou on 30 November. By 2 December, the revolutionary forces were able to capture Nanking in the uprising; and the revolutionaries decided to make it the site of the new provisional government. At the time, Beijing was still the Qing capital.

===North–South Conference===
On 18 December, the was held in Shanghai to discuss the north and south issues. The reluctance of foreign financiers to give financial support to the Qing government or the revolutionaries contributed to both sides agreeing to start negotiations. Yuan Shikai selected Tang Shaoyi as his representative. Tang left Beijing for Wuhan to negotiate with the revolutionaries. The revolutionaries chose Wu Tingfang. With the intervention of six foreign powers, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Russia, Japan, and France, Tang Shaoyi and Wu Tingfang began to negotiate a settlement at the British concession. Foreign businessman Edward Selby Little (李德立) acted as the negotiator and facilitated the peace agreement. They agreed that Yuan Shikai would force the Qing emperor to abdicate in exchange for the southern provinces&#x27; support of Yuan as President of the Republic. After considering the possibility that the new republic might be defeated in a civil war or by foreign invasion, Sun Yat-sen agreed to Yuan&#x27;s proposal to unify China under Yuan Shikai&#x27;s Beijing government. Further decisions were made to let the emperor rule over his little court in the New Summer Palace. He would be treated as a ruler of a separate country and have expenses of several million taels in silver.

==Establishment of the Republic==
===Republic of China declared and national flag issued===
On 29 December 1911, Sun Yat-sen was elected as the first provisional president. 1 January 1912 was set as the first day of the First Year of the ROC. On 3 January, the representatives recommended Li Yuanhong as the Provisional Vice-president.

During and after the 1911 Revolution, many groups that participated wanted their own pennant as the national flag. During the Wuchang Uprising, the military units of Wuchang wanted the nine-star flag with a taijitu. Others in competition included Lu Haodong&#x27;s Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. Huang Xing favored a flag bearing the mythical &quot;well-field&quot; system of village agriculture. In the end, the assembly compromised: the national flag would be the banner of Five Races Under One Union. The Five Races Under One Union flag with horizontal stripes represented the five major nationalities of the republic. The red represented Han, the yellow represented Manchus, the blue for Mongols, the white for Muslims, and the black for Tibetans. Despite the general target of the uprisings to be the Manchus, Sun Yat-sen, Song Jiaoren and Huang Xing unanimously advocated racial integration to be carried out from the mainland to the frontiers.

===Donghuamen Incident===
On 16 January, while returning to his residence, Yuan Shikai was ambushed in a bomb attack organized by the Tongmenghui in , Beijing. Eighteen revolutionaries were involved. About ten guards died, but Yuan himself was not seriously injured. He sent a message to the revolutionaries the next day pledging his loyalty and asking them not to organize any more assassination attempts against him.

===Abdication of the Emperor===
Zhang Jian drafted an abdication proposal that was approved by the Provisional Senate. On 20 January, Wu Tingfang of the Nanking Provisional Government officially delivered the Imperial Edict of Abdication to Yuan Shikai for the abdication of Puyi. On 22 January, Sun Yat-sen announced that he would resign the presidency in favor of Yuan Shikai if the latter supported the emperor&#x27;s abdication. Yuan then pressured Empress Dowager Longyu with the threat that the imperial family&#x27;s lives would not be spared if abdication did not come before the revolutionaries reached Beijing, but if they agreed to abdicate, the provisional government would honor the terms proposed by the imperial family.

On 3 February, Empress Dowager Longyu gave Yuan full permission to negotiate the abdication terms of the Qing emperor. Yuan then drew up his own version and forwarded it to the revolutionaries on 3 February. His version consisted of three sections instead of two. On 12 February, after being pressured by Yuan and other ministers, Puyi (age six) and Empress Dowager Longyu accepted Yuan&#x27;s terms of abdication.

===Capital location debate===
As a condition for ceding leadership to Yuan Shikai, Sun Yat-sen insisted that the provisional government remain in Nanjing. On 14 February, the Provisional Senate initially voted 20–5 in favor of making Beijing the capital over Nanjing, with two votes going for Wuhan and one for Tianjin. The Senate majority wanted to secure the peace agreement by taking power in Beijing. Zhang Jian and others reasoned that having the capital in Beijing would check against Manchu restoration and Mongol secession. But Sun and Huang Xing argued in favor of Nanjing to balance against Yuan&#x27;s power base in the north. Li Yuanhong presented Wuhan as a compromise. The next day, the Provisional Senate voted again, this time, 19–6 in favor of Nanjing with two votes for Wuhan. Sun sent a delegation led by Cai Yuanpei and Wang Jingwei to persuade Yuan to move to Nanjing. Yuan welcomed the delegation and agreed to accompany the delegates back to the south. Then on the evening of 29 February, riots and fires broke out all over the city. They were allegedly started by disobedient troops of Cao Kun, a loyal officer of Yuan. The disorder gave Yuan the pretext to stay in the north to guard against unrest. On 10 March, Yuan was inaugurated in Beijing as the Provisional President of the Republic of China. On 5 April, the Provisional Senate in Nanjing voted to make Beijing the capital of the Republic and convened in Beijing at the end of the month.

==Republican Government in Beijing==

On 10 March 1912, Yuan Shikai was sworn as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China in Beijing. The first National Assembly election took place according to the Provisional Constitution. While in Beijing, the Kuomintang was formed on 25 August 1912. The KMT held the majority of seats after the election. Song Jiaoren was elected as premier. However, Song was assassinated in Shanghai on 20 March 1913, under the secret order of Yuan Shikai.

==Proposed Han monarchy==

Some advocated that an ethnic Han be installed as Emperor of China, either a descendant of Confucius who held the noble title of the Duke of Yansheng, or a descendant of the Ming imperial family who possessed the title of the Marquis of Extended Grace. The Duke of Yansheng was proposed as a candidate for emperorship by Liang Qichao.

The Han hereditary aristocratic nobility like the Duke of Yansheng were retained by the new Republic of China and the title holders continued to receive their pensions.

A plan backed by foreign bankers was reportedly in place to declare the Duke of Yansheng as Emperor of China, if the revolutionary&#x27;s republican cause failed.

== Legacy ==
=== Social influence ===

After the revolution, there was a huge outpouring of anti-Manchu sentiment through China, but particularly in Beijing where thousands died in anti-Manchu violence. Imperial restrictions on Han residency and behavior within the city crumbled as Manchu imperial power crumbled. Anti-Manchu sentiment is recorded in books like &quot;A Short History of Slaves&quot; () and &quot;The Biographies of Avaricious Officials and Corrupt Personnel&quot; () by Laoli ().

During the abdication of the last emperor, Empress Dowager Longyu, Yuan Shikai and Sun Yat-sen both tried to adopt the concept of &quot;Manchu and Han as one family&quot; (. People started exploring and debating with themselves on the root cause of their national weakness. This new search of identity was the New Culture Movement. Manchu culture and language, on the contrary, became virtually extinct by 2007.

Unlike revolutions in the West, the 1911 Revolution did not restructure society. The participants in the 1911 Revolution were mostly military personnel, old-type bureaucrats, and local gentries. These people still held regional power after the 1911 Revolution. Some became warlords. There were no major improvements in the standard of living. The writer Lu Xun commented in 1921 during the publishing of &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot;, ten years after the 1911 Revolution, that basically nothing changed except &quot;the Manchus have left the kitchen&quot;. Economic problems were not addressed until the governance of Chiang Ching-kuo in Taiwan and Mao Zedong on the mainland.

The 1911 Revolution mainly got rid of feudalism (fengjian) from the late imperial period. In the usual view of historians, there are two restorations of feudal power after the revolution: the first was Yuan Shikai; the second was Zhang Xun. Due to the effects of anti-Manchu sentiment after the revolution, the Manchus of the Metropolitan Banners were driven into deep poverty, with Manchu men too impoverished to marry, so Han men married Manchu women, Manchus stopped dressing in Manchu clothing and stopped practicing Manchu traditions.

===Historical significance===

The 1911 Revolution overthrew the Qing government and four thousand years of monarchy. Throughout Chinese history, old dynasties had always been replaced by new dynasties. The 1911 Revolution, however, was the first to overthrow a monarchy completely and attempt to establish a republic to spread democratic ideas throughout China. In 1911 at the provisional government proclamation ceremony, Sun Yat-sen said, &quot;The revolution is not yet successful, the comrades still need to strive for the future.&quot; ().

Since the 1920s, both the ROC and PRC have seen the 1911 Revolution quite differently. Both Chinas recognize Sun Yat-sen as the Father of the Nation, but in Taiwan, they mean &quot;Father of the Republic of China&quot;. On the mainland, Sun Yat-sen was seen as the man who helped bring down the Qing, a pre-condition for the Communist state founded in 1949. The PRC views Sun&#x27;s work as the first step toward the real revolution in 1949, when the communists set up a truly independent state that expelled foreigners and built a military and industrial power. The father of New China is seen as Mao Zedong. In 1954, Liu Shaoqi was quoted as saying that the &quot;1911 Revolution inserted the concept of a republic into common people&quot;. Zhou Enlai pointed out that the &quot;1911 Revolution overthrew the Qing rule, ended 4,000 years of monarchy, and liberated the mind of people to a great extent, and opened up the path for the development of future revolution. This is a great victory.&quot;

===Modern evaluation===

A change in the belief that the revolution had been a generally positive change began in the late 1980s and 1990s, but Zhang Shizhao was quoted as arguing that &quot;When talking about the 1911 Revolution, the theorist these days tends to overemphasize. The word &#x27;success&#x27; was way overused.&quot;

The degree of success of democracy gained by the revolution can vary depending on one&#x27;s view. Even after Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, for sixty years, the KMT controlled all five branches of the government; none were independent. Yan Jiaqi, founder of the Federation for a Democratic China, has said that Sun Yat-sen is to be credited as founding China&#x27;s first republic in 1912, and the second republic is the people of Taiwan and the political parties there now democratizing the region.

Meanwhile, the ideals of democracy are far from realised on the mainland Chinese side. For example, former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao once said in a speech that without real democracy, there is no guarantee of economic and political rights; but he led a 2011 crackdown against the peaceful Chinese jasmine protests. Others, such as Qin Yongmin of the Democracy Party of China, who was imprisoned for twelve years, do not praise the 1911 Revolution. Qin said the revolution only replaced one dictator with another, that Mao was not an emperor, but he is worse than the emperor.

=== Media ===
One of Japan&#x27;s earliest film companies (M. Pathe, owned by Sun supporter Shōkichi Umeya) documented the success of the revolution beginning with the Wuchang uprising and leading to Sun&#x27;s inauguration, producing three documentary films that covered the revolution.

<doc id="298028" wikidata="Q214681" url="?curid=298028" title="Panaji">
<text>Panaji (; , ), also known as Panjim, is the capital of the Indian state of Goa and the headquarters of North Goa district. Previously, it was the territorial capital of the former Portuguese India. It lies on the banks of the Mandovi river estuary in the Tiswadi sub-district &quot;(taluka)&quot;. With a population of 114,759 in the metropolitan area, Panaji is Goa&#x27;s largest urban agglomeration, ahead of Margao and Mormugao.

Panaji has terraced hills, concrete buildings with balconies and red-tiled roofs, churches, and a riverside promenade. There are avenues lined with gulmohar, acacia and other trees. The baroque Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church is located overlooking the main square known as Praça da Igreja. Panaji has been selected as one of a hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under the Smart Cities Mission. Panaji&#x27;s HDI is almost around 0.90, and is considered to be the best amongst other major Indian cities.

The city was built with stepped streets and a seven kilometre long promenade on a planned grid system after the Portuguese relocated the capital from Velha Goa in the 17th century. It was elevated from a town to a city on 22 March 1843.

== Etymology ==
The city was renamed from &quot;Panjim&quot; in English to &quot;Panaji&quot;, its present official name in the 1980s. The Portuguese name is &quot;Pangim&quot;. The city had been renamed &quot;Nova Goa&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;New Goa&quot;) when it officially replaced the city of Goa (now Old Goa) as the capital of Portuguese India, though the Viceroy had already moved there in 1759.

The justification of the modern word &quot;Panaji&quot; is derived from the words &quot;panjani&quot; and &quot;khali&quot;, which mean &quot;a boat&quot; and &quot;a small creek&quot; respectively, in Sanskrit. Thus the modern word Panjim is believed to be a corruption of the old word &quot;Panjanakhani&quot; as inscribed on the discovered Panjim copper-plates dated 1059 CE, belonging to the rule of Kadamba king Jayakesi I. According to legend, this northern capital city was mentioned in a stone inscription of Kadamba king Jayakesi I dated 1054 CE as &#x27;Panjanakhani&#x27;, giving him the epithet of &quot;Padavalendra&quot; which is Kannada for &quot;lord of the western ocean&quot;.

== History ==
Panaji was made the capital of Portuguese India, after a devastating epidemic decimated the population of the City of Goa in the mid-18th century.

Panaji was annexed by India with the rest of Goa and the former Portuguese territories after the Indian annexation of Portuguese India in 1961. It became a state-capital on Goa&#x27;s elevation to statehood in 1987and between 1961 and 1987, it was the capital of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu. A new Legislative Assembly complex was inaugurated in March 2000, across the Mandovi River, in Alto Porvorim. Panaji is also the administrative headquarters of North Goa district.

<text>Pierre Stewart Pettigrew (born April 18, 1951) is a Canadian politician and businessman.

==Early life and career==
Born in Quebec City, Pettigrew has a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières (1972) and a Master of Philosophy degree in international relations from the University of Oxford (1976) where he studied at Balliol College.

Prior to seeking elected office, Pettigrew was director of the Political Committee, NATO Assembly, in Brussels, from 1976 to 1978, executive assistant to the Leader of the Quebec Liberal Party from 1978 to 1981 and Foreign Policy Advisor to Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, from 1981 to 1984. Pettigrew was vice-president of Samson Bélair/Deloitte &amp; Touche in Montreal from 1985 to 1995, where he acted as a business consultant to companies with dealings in international markets.

==Political career==
Pettigrew served in the Liberal cabinet of Jean Chrétien in various capacities and in the government of Paul Martin as Canada&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the 2006 federal election he was defeated as the Member of Parliament for the Montreal-area electoral district of Papineau.

Following the 1995 Quebec referendum Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was committed to bringing in more star candidates from Quebec to his cabinet. He thus appointed Pettigrew and Stéphane Dion to cabinet, even before they were in the house. Pettigrew previously ran for parliament in the 1984 federal election in the riding of Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup but was defeated by less than 7,000 votes by the Progressive Conservative candidate, André Plourde.

André Ouellet was made head of Canada Post, opening the riding of Papineau—Saint-Michel. Pettigrew was elected to Parliament in a March 25, 1996 by-election. He was re-elected in 1997 and 2000, representing the new riding of Papineau—Saint-Denis. In 1996 he became Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible for La Francophonie.
From 1996 to 1999, he also served as Minister of Human Resources Development. In that time, the Department of Human Resources Development represented more than half of the Canadian federal budget. Pettigrew negotiated with the provinces and the territories the National Child Benefit, the most important social program since Canada Pension Plan (1966), a 10 billions program by now. He implemented the new Employment Insurance Program which became balanced after years of deficit despite lowering the premiums. Under his watch, however, ineffective accounting practices at HRDC allegedly left millions of dollars unaccounted for. Pettigrew was fortunate to have been shuffled to the portfolio of International Trade. His successor Jane Stewart took the brunt of the &quot;billion-dollar boondoggle&quot; scandal.

As Minister for International Trade, he promoted free trade and always characterized the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as &quot;a tremendous success&quot;. and a model to expand upon. He was a key participant in the World Trade Organization (WTO) trade talks, claiming that Canada&#x27;s main goal of lowering agricultural subsidies would be of great benefit to the world&#x27;s poorer nations. At the 2003 WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancún, Pettigrew played an aggressive role as chair of the working group on the Singapore issues, controversial sectors of proposed liberalization which were bitterly opposed by some developing nation delegates, not to mention masses of protesters outside of the gates where the meetings were held. He also championed the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), and in the period leading up to the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in 2001, he spearheaded a campaign to allay growing public suspicion of the deal by promising the eventual release of the draft negotiating texts. After a delay due to translating the texts into the Portuguese language, the texts were made publicly available July 3, 2001. Throughout his mandate at International Trade, he was heavily embroiled in the US - Canada softwood lumber dispute.

On December 12, 2003, he was appointed Minister of Health and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs by newly appointed Prime Minister Paul Martin. On July 20, 2004, he moved to his long-desired portfolio of Foreign Affairs minister, replacing Bill Graham.

On April 26, 2005, the Montreal newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot; reported that the trilingual Pettigrew, who speaks English, French and Spanish, would leave Canadian politics to serve as the Secretary General of the Organization of American States. The newspaper suggested that Pettigrew had sufficient support among OAS members to win the job, although officially Canada supported the election of Luis Ernesto Derbez of Mexico in the 2005 OAS Secretary General election.

Pettigrew has long been rumoured to be a possible leadership candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada or as a leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec.

In 1999, Pettigrew wrote &quot;Pour une politique de la confiance&quot; (English translation: &quot;The New Politics of Confidence&quot;), a book on globalization and the art of governing.

On June 17, 2005, an incident occurred at a conference in Montreal regarding the subject of Haiti, at one point during the conference, Pettigrew was splashed with a red substance by Yves Engler, a political activist associated with the group &quot;Haiti Action Montreal&quot;. As Engler threw the red substance on Pettigrew, he shouted &quot;Pettigrew lies, Haitians die&quot;. Engler claimed that the red paint was meant to symbolize the blood on the hands of the Canadian state due to Canada&#x27;s involvement in Haiti. Pettigrew told police that he wanted full charges pressed against Engler. However, a couple of days later, Pettigrew suddenly decided to drop all charges.

Despite growing pressure, Pettigrew consistently stated that Canada would &quot;stay the course&quot; in Haiti.

On December 28, 2005, Pettigrew was the victim of an attempted mugging while he was waiting for a train in the Montreal subway station. The accused, Frederick Estelle, has been charged with aggravated theft.

At the 2004 election, Pettigrew was nearly defeated by a Bloc Québécois challenger – only the second time that the Liberals&#x27; hold on the riding had been seriously threatened. At the 2006 election, Pettigrew was defeated by Bloc challenger Vivian Barbot.

==Post-political career==
On October 23, 2006, Deloitte Canada&#x27;s Managing Partner and Chief Executive Alan MacGibbon announced that Pierre Pettigrew had been appointed as Executive Advisor for the firm&#x27;s international activities. Pettigrew is a member of the Inter-American Dialogue.

He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Warwick in July 2008.

In August 2016, Pettigrew was appointed special envoy on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union.

He currently resides in Toronto.

<text>Nithard (c. 795–844), a Frankish historian, was the son of Charlemagne&#x27;s daughter Bertha. His father was Angilbert.

==Life==
Nithard was born sometime around the year Charlemagne was crowned &quot;Imperator Augustus&quot; in December 800. He was probably raised either at the imperial palace, where his mother continued to live until the death of the emperor, or at the monastery of St. Riquier, where his father was lay abbot. He would have been educated most likely at the imperial &quot;schola&quot;, which offered the kind of high-quality instruction in both military and literary training he is known to have received.

Nithard himself later became lay abbot of St Riquier &quot;in commendam&quot;. He served his cousin Charles the Bald in both war and peace, fighting at his side during the Carolingian civil war and at the battle of Fontenoy in June 841. It is probable that he died as the result of wounds received whilst fighting for him against the Northmen near Angoulême. The date of his death is disputed among scholars, but consensus is now for June 14, 844. In the 11th century his body, with the fatal wound still visible, was found in the grave of his father, Angilbert.

==Works==
Nithard&#x27;s historical work consists of four books on the history of the Carolingian empire under the turbulent sons of the emperor Louis I, especially during the turbulent period between 838 and 843. The &quot;Historiae&quot; or &quot;De dissensionibus filiorum Ludovici pii&quot; (&quot;On the Dissensions of the Sons of Louis the Pious&quot;) is valuable for the light which it throws upon the causes which led to the disintegration of the Carolingian empire. Nithard&#x27;s work has been described as a &quot;nostalgic lament&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;In the times of Charles the Great of good memory,
who died almost thirty years ago, peace and concord ruled everywhere
because our people were treading the one proper way,
the way of the common welfare, and thus the way of God.
But now since each goes his separate way, dissension and struggle abound.
Once there was abundance and happiness everywhere,
now everywhere there is want and sadness&lt;/poem&gt;

The first three of these books were written before Nithard&#x27;s appointment as lay abbot of St-Riquier in the winter of 842, the fourth and final in spring of 843 after taking up office there. Although rough in style, partisan in character and sometimes incorrect in detail, the books are the work of a man who had an intimate knowledge of the events which he relates, who possessed a clear and virile mind, and who above all was not a recluse but a man of action. They are dedicated to Charles the Bald, at whose request they were written.

His work as a military intellectual places him in the tradition of Xenophon, Julius Caesar, Ammianus Marcellinus, and Flavius Merobaudes. For the military historian, Nithard&#x27;s description of the complex exercises of cavalry in Gaul is particularly valuable as a supplement to the account in the &quot;Tactical Handbook&quot; of Arrian as well as for its insight into Carolingian techniques.

Only two manuscripts of the &quot;Historiae&quot; survived, one roughly contemporary and an incomplete Renaissance-era text useless in the reconstruction of the text.

:*The standard critical edition of Nithard (with French translation) is that of Philippe Lauer, &quot;Histoire des fils de Louis le Pieux,&quot; Paris: Champion, 1926.
:*The 1907 Latin edition of Ernst Müller was republished in 1965 as part of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica series.
:*An English translation by Bernhard Walter Scholz and Barbara Rogers is available in &quot;Carolingian Chronicles:&quot; Royal Frankish Annals &quot;and Nithard’s&quot; Histories (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1972).

<text>The Boston Mountains is a Level III ecoregion designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the U.S. states of Arkansas and Oklahoma. Part of the Ozarks, the Boston Mountains are a deeply dissected plateau. The ecoregion is steeper than the adjacent Springfield Plateau to the north, and bordered on the south by the Arkansas Valley. The Oklahoma portion of the range is locally referred to as the Cookson Hills. There are several theories of how the mountains were named, though apparently none are related to the Massachusetts city.

The Boston Mountains ecoregion has been subdivided into two Level IV ecoregions.

==Description==
The ecoregion is mountainous, forested, and underlain by Pennsylvanian sandstone, shale, and siltstone. It is one of the Ozark Plateaus; some folding and faulting has occurred but, in general, strata are much less deformed than in the Ouachita Mountains. Maximum elevations are higher, soils have a warmer temperature regime, and carbonate rocks are much less extensive than in the Ozark Highlands. Physiography is distinct from the Arkansas Valley. Upland soils are mostly Ultisols that developed under oak-hickory and oak-hickory-pine forests. Today, forests are still widespread; northern red oak, southern red oak, white oak, and hickories usually dominate the uplands, but shortleaf pine grows on drier, south- and west-facing slopes underlain by sandstone. Pastureland or hayland occur on nearly level ridgetops, benches, and valley floors. Population density is low; recreation, logging, and livestock farming are the primary land uses. Water quality in streams is generally exceptional; biochemical, nutrient, and mineral water quality parameter concentrations all tend to be very low. Fish communities are mostly composed of sensitive species; a diverse, often darter-dominated community occurs along with nearly equal proportions of minnows and sunfishes. During low flows, streams usually run clear but, during high flow conditions, turbidity in the Boston Mountains tends to be greater than in the Ouachitas. Summer flow in many small streams is limited or non-existent but isolated, enduring pools may occur.

==Geology and physiography==

The Boston Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger Ozark Plateaus province, which in turn is part of the larger Interior Highlands physiographic division.

The area is underlain by Pennsylvanian sandstone, shale, and siltstone, where some folding and faulting has occurred. The sandstone beds become thinner with higher shale content in the west as the mountains decline in elevation.

The range covers an area of . The rocks of the region are essentially little disturbed, flat-lying sedimentary layers of the Paleozoic age. The highest ridges and peaks are capped by Pennsylvanian sandstone and shale. The deeply eroded valleys are cut into Mississippian limestones and below that layer Ordovician dolomites.

==General description==
The Boston Mountains form the southwestern part of the Ozark plateau where they are the highest portion of the Ozarks. Summits can reach elevations of just over with valleys to deep.

<doc id="298049" wikidata="Q3853685" url="?curid=298049" title="Case Closed">
<text>Case Closed, &lt;onlyinclude&gt;also known as , is a Japanese detective manga series written and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama. It has been serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; since January 1994; its chapters are collected in 106 volumes as of October 2024. Because of legal problems with the name &quot;Detective Conan&quot;, the English language releases from Funimation and Viz Media were renamed &quot;Case Closed&quot;. The story follows the high school detective Shinichi Kudo, whose body was transformed into that of an elementary school-age child while investigating a mysterious organization. Generally, he solves a multitude of cases by impersonating his childhood best friend&#x27;s father and various other characters.

The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation and TMS Entertainment, which premiered in January 1996. The anime resulted in animated feature films, original video animations, video games, audio disc releases and live action episodes. Funimation licensed the anime series for North American broadcast in 2003 under the name &quot;Case Closed&quot; with the characters given Americanized names. The anime premiered on Adult Swim but was discontinued due to low ratings.

In March 2013, Funimation began streaming their licensed episodes of &quot;Case Closed&quot;; Crunchyroll simulcast them in 2014.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; Funimation also localized the first six &quot;Case Closed&quot; films, while Discotek Media localized the &quot;Lupin III&quot; crossover special, its film sequel, and select films, starting with &quot;Case Closed Episode One&quot;. Meanwhile, the manga is localized by Viz Media, which used Funimation&#x27;s changed title and character names. Shogakukan Asia is making its own localized English version of the manga, which used the original title and Japanese names.

The volumes of the manga had over 270 million copies in circulation worldwide by January 2023, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. In 2001, the manga was awarded the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award in the category. The anime adaptation has been well received and ranked in the top twenty in &quot;Animage&quot;″s polls between 1996 and 2001. In the Japanese anime television ranking, &quot;Case Closed&quot; episodes ranked in the top six weekly. Both the manga and the anime have had a positive response from critics for their plot and cases. The manga has been sold in 25 countries, while the anime has been broadcast in 40 countries.

==Plot==

Jimmy Kudo (Japanese name: Shinichi Kudo) is a high school detective who sometimes works with police to solve cases. During an investigation, he is ambushed and incapacitated by a member of a crime syndicate known as the Black Organization. In an attempt to murder the young detective, they force-feed him a dangerous experimental drug. However, instead of killing him, it shrinks his body to the size of an elementary school child. Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mori) and her father, Richard (Kogoro Mori), who is a private detective. Throughout the series, he tags along on Richard&#x27;s cases. Nonetheless, after Kudo solves one, he uses Dr. Agasa&#x27;s hidden tranquilizer to sedate Richard and then uses a voice changer to simulate his voice to reveal the solution. He also enrolls in Teitan Elementary School, where he makes friends with a group of classmates who form their own Junior Detective League (Detective Boys). While he continues to dig deeper into the Black Organization, he frequently interacts with other characters, including his neighbor, Dr. Agasa; Ran&#x27;s friend Serena Sebastian (Sonoko Suzuki); a fellow teenage detective, Harley Hartwell (Heiji Hattori); assorted police detectives from different regions; and a phantom thief called Kaito Kid.

Kudo later encounters an elementary school transfer student, Anita Hailey (Ai Haibara), who reveals herself to be a former member of the Black Organization under the code name Sherry and the creator of the experimental drug that shrunk him. She too ingested it to evade the pursuit of the organization. She soon joins the Junior Detectives. During a rare encounter with the Black Organization, Conan helps the FBI plant a CIA agent, Kir, inside the Black Organization as a spy.

==Production==
&quot;Case Closed&quot; was conceived in 1994 during the rise of mystery genre manga due to the publishing of the series &quot;The Kindaichi Case Files&quot;; the first chapter appeared in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; on January 5. Aoyama cites the stories of Arsène Lupin, Sherlock Holmes and the samurai films by Akira Kurosawa as influences on his work. When scripting each chapter, he ensures the dialogue remains simple and spends an average of four hours for each new case and twelve for more complicated ones. Aoyama&#x27;s older brother is a scientist who helps him out with the &quot;gimmicks&quot; in the series. Each case spans several chapters (except for a handful of shorter cases that span only one) and is resolved at the end, when characters explain the details of their solutions in simple terms. An online database of all the cases from the manga was launched in 2007. In 2007, Aoyama hinted that he had planned an ending but did not intend to end the series yet. Aoyama and his staff decided to computerize their manga creation process in early 2011, although he still draws with a pen and paper. The change began with the final page of chapter 760.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama, &quot;Case Closed&quot; started its serialization in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; on January 5, 1994. &quot;Case Closed&quot; became one of the longest running manga series, with over 1,000 chapters released in Japan, and the first series with over 1,000 chapters published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. Shogakukan has collected its chapters into individual volumes. The first volume was released on June 18, 1994. On October 18, 2021, the series reached one hundred volumes; &quot;One Piece&quot; author, Eiichiro Oda, whose series achieved the same feat a month before, sent congratulations to Aoyama. As of October 18, 2024, 106 volumes have been published.Viz Media announced its acquisition of the series for North America on June 1, 2004. Following Funimation&#x27;s localization, Viz released the series as &quot;Case Closed&quot; and took their character names to keep consistency between the two media. Viz Media released the first volume in September 2004 and began releasing digital editions in 2013. On May 9, 2023, Viz Media launched their &quot;Viz Manga&quot; digital manga service, with the series&#x27; chapters receiving simultaneous English publication in North America as they are released in Japan. Gollancz licensed and distributed 15 of Viz Media&#x27;s volumes in the United Kingdom before ceasing publication of manga. (Viz Media has since re-released them). In 2014 Shogakukan Asia began its own English localization of the series for Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries as &quot;Detective Conan&quot;. Laura Thornton of CBR.com, citing the common Japanese ownership in both Shogakukan Asia and Viz, described the Singapore version as, compared to the Viz one, &quot;completely identical, word-for-word, even -- save for the names and the &quot;Detective Conan&quot; logo&quot;.

====Spin-offs====

Gosho Aoyama&#x27;s assistants have written an anthology series of &quot;Case Closed&quot; which are released irregularly.

A spin-off manga series, titled &quot;Case Closed: The Culprit Hanzawa&quot;, by Mayuko Kanba, began in the July 2017 issue of Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Shōnen Sunday S&quot;, released on May 25, 2017.

Another spin-off manga series, illustrated by Takahiro Arai with supervision by Aoyama, titled &quot;Case Closed: Zero&#x27;s Tea Time&quot; started in issue #24 of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; on May 9, 2018. The story centers on the agent Toru Amuro/Rei Furuya. New chapters of the manga are only published when &quot;Case Closed&quot; is on hiatus.

Another spin-off manga series by Arai, titled &quot;Detective Conan: Police Academy Arc – Wild Police Story&quot;, was serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from October 2, 2019, to November 18, 2020. Spanning 13 chapters, it again focuses on Amuro/Furuya during his years in the police academy with his colleagues.

===Anime===

The anime version of &quot;Case Closed&quot; is produced by Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation and TMS Entertainment. Over 1,150 episodes have aired in Japan since the anime&#x27;s premiere on January 8, 1996, making it the fifteenth longest anime series to date. Initially, Shogakukan collected and released the episodes on VHS video cassettes from June 1996 to October 2006. Four hundred and twenty-six episodes were released on VHS until Shogakukan abandoned the format and switched over to DVDs, starting over from the first episode. For the fifteenth anniversary of the anime series, the series was made available for video on demand. The series celebrated its 25th anniversary in January 2021, and the &quot;Moonlight Sonata Murder Case&quot; episode (11th episode of the series) was given the remake treatment as the first part of its celebration, which featured the latest staff and production techniques, and classical pianist Aimi Kobayashi performed Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 14 for the episode. It aired on March 6, 2021.

As of 2018, the &quot;Detective Conan&quot; anime has been broadcast in 40 countries around the world. The Canadian channel YTV picked up the &quot;Case Closed&quot; series and broadcast 22 episodes between April 7, 2006, and September 2, 2006, before taking it off the air. &quot;Case Closed&quot; was later broadcast in North America on NHK&#x27;s cable network TV Japan. Hanabee Entertainment licensed the series for distribution in Australia.

In 2003, the first 104 episodes, as well as the first six movies were licensed by Funimation for distribution in North America, under the title &quot;Case Closed&quot; because of legal considerations. The &quot;Case Closed&quot; anime has also been released in other languages such as French, German and Italian. &quot;Case Closed&quot; debuted on Cartoon Network as part of their Adult Swim programming block on May 24, 2004; no more than 50 episodes were licensed from Funimation due to low ratings. Funimation made the series available with the launch of the Funimation Channel in November 2005; it was temporary available on Colours TV during its syndication with the Funimation Channel. Funimation also released DVDs of their dubbed series beginning August 24, 2004. Initially, the releases were done in single DVDs and future episodes were released in seasonal boxes; 130 episodes have been released in total. The seasonal boxes were later re-released in redesigned boxes called Viridian edition. Funimation began streaming &quot;Case Closed&quot; episodes in March 2013. Finally, in 2018, Funimation lost the rights to the series.

A separate English adaptation of the series was made by Voiceovers Unlimited Pte Ltd. in Singapore. Another one by Animax Asia premiered in the Philippines on January 18, 2006, under the name &quot;Detective Conan&quot;. Because Animax were unable to obtain further TV broadcast rights, their version comprised only 52 episodes. The series continued with reruns until August 7, 2006, when it was removed from the station. Both the Singapore and Philippines versions used Japanese character names. The California-based channel United Television Broadcasting (UTB) aired it with English subtitles from 2011 to 2014, until episode 421.

Crunchyroll began simulcasting the series in October 2014, starting with episode 754. In September 2020, Crunchyroll began streaming the first 42 episodes, later adding episodes 42–123 in August 2021 (with any special episodes with an extended runtime that were previously split into multiple parts being presented as they were originally broadcast in Japan). In August 2024, Crunchyroll removed the first 123 episodes. In January 2016, 52 episodes of the anime appeared on Netflix, initially under its original title &quot;Detective Conan&quot; before changing to its English moniker &quot;Case Closed&quot;. The episodes were listed as &quot;season one&quot;, although in reality they are episodes 748 to 799. The episodes were only available in Japanese, but were subtitled. The availability was likely part of Netflix&#x27;s efforts to expand its anime catalog. In January 2021, Netflix removed the episodes.

It was revealed in February 2023 that TMS Entertainment commissioned a new English dub of &quot;Case Closed&quot;, with episodes of the anime beginning streaming on Tubi that same month, starting at episode 965. This marked the first English dub for the series since 2010. The dub is produced by Florida-based studio Macias Group with a new dub cast (except for the voices of Shinichi, Conan, Ran, Kogoro, and Kaito Kid, whose voice actors were retained from the Bang Zoom! Entertainment home video dubs).

====Films====

Twenty-seven feature films based on the &quot;Case Closed&quot; series have been released. They are animated by TMS Entertainment and produced by Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation, Nippon Television, ShoPro, and Toho.

The revenue earned from the films funded Toho&#x27;s other film projects. Each film was adapted into two film comics which were released in the fourth quarter of the same year. Funimation released English dubbed versions of the first six films on Region 1 DVDs between October 3, 2006, and February 16, 2010. Bang Zoom!

===Critical response===
In the United States, &quot;Case Closed&quot; received praises from Mania.com&#x27;s Eduardo M. Chavez and IGN&#x27;s A. E. Sparrow for its stories—telling the mysteries and how they were unfolded by the investigations of Conan and gang. Sparrow called the style of the series a mix of Scooby-Doo and Sherlock Holmes, while Chavez believed the manga had appeal to readers of all ages. Melissa Sternenberg from &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; gave the series 5 out of 5 stars, she praised its animation and plot, and described it as &quot;what puts &quot;Detective Conan&quot; as my all-time favorite anime is the superb writing. I soak up &quot;Detective Conan&quot; like a good book, I get so drawn into every episode that everything around me just sinks away and it is just me and the episode. It is engrossing. I can not think of another word for it. Like I said, every episode is fresh, and every mystery that is solved is profound. The kid is a prodigy, and you can not blink while watching an episode of this wonderful series&quot;.

ActiveAnime&#x27;s reviewers commented on complex character design and the &quot;spirit&quot; that the series has, indicating that fans of serialized mystery shows would rather enjoy it. The series is also said to better suit the more matured audience. Lori Lancaster of Mania.com described &quot;Case Closed&quot; as &quot;a clever series that had mysteries at every corner&quot;, noting the &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;interesting&quot; nature of each case. IGN&#x27;s Chris Wyatt was positive to the manner the cases were set up, relating them to Agatha Christie&#x27;s locked-room mysteries. He described the series as &quot;Inspector Gadget meets Law &amp; Order but in an anime style&quot;.

In the United States, the dubbed series faced several negative reactions toward its changes to localize the content for international English-speaking audiences, mostly North American. Jeffrey Harris of IGN found it pointless to change the names of the characters, and &quot;Anime News Network&quot;&#x27;s Carl Kimlinger said that the changes of certain Japanese cultural references rendered several parts of the mysteries and their investigation illogical. The voice-overs proved to be a mixed bag for Carlo Santos, who reviewed the first DVD release of &quot;Case Closed&quot; for &quot;Anime News Network&quot;; he said that while the main characters sounded like &quot;real people&quot;, the secondary ones &quot;[came] off as caricatures&quot;.

===Accolades===
The &quot;Case Closed&quot; manga series was awarded the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award in the &quot;shōnen&quot; category in 2001. It respondents in an online poll for Japanese citizens in their mid-twenties voted &quot;Case Closed&quot; as one of the top three manga they wanted to continue running in publication. In France, the series was nominated for the Angoulême Festival Graphic Novel award among the Japanese selection. The series ranked on About.com&#x27;s top continuing manga series of 2010, under the title &quot;Best Underappreciated Gem: Shonen&quot; category.

Several of the franchise&#x27;s films were nominated for awards in their home country. The ninth film was nominated for the feature film category at the 5th Annual Tokyo Anime Awards, and the next five films were nominees for the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year in their respective years of release.

<text>PotlatchDeltic Corporation (originally Potlatch Corp) is an American diversified forest products company based in Spokane, Washington.

It manufactures and sells lumber, panels and particleboard and receives revenue from other assets such as mineral rights and the leasing of land as well as the sale of land considered expendable. In February 2018, Potlatch acquired Deltic Timber Corp., a smaller Arkansas-based timber company. Following the merger, the company was renamed PotlatchDeltic Corporation. In 2021, the company harvested 5,515,000 tons of lumber. In 2022, PotlatchDeltic merged with CatchMark Timber Trust, Inc.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The Potlatch Lumber Company was incorporated in 1903 with an authorized capital of $3.0 million by a consortium of lumber investors, including William Deary of Northland Pine Company, Henry Turrish of Wisconsin Log and Lumber, and Frederick Weyerhaeuser, who was also an investor in Deary&#x27;s Northland Pine business. Frederick Weyerhaeuser&#x27;s son Charles A. Weyerhaeuser became the company&#x27;s first President and held that role until his death in 1930, while Deary was named the company&#x27;s General Manager. Potlatch planned a lumber mill on the Palouse River in north central Idaho and began construction in 1905, completing it in 1906.

The company town of Potlatch was built to serve the mill, and over 200 buildings were designed by architect C. Ferris White for the firm. The town soon became the second biggest in Latah County (behind Moscow), and the firm was the biggest taxpayer in Idaho for some years. Its commercial district, which includes the main administrative building of the company, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. William Deary also oversaw the building of a logging railroad connecting the mill to the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s Pacific Extension; the town of Deary, also in Latah County, was named after him.

In 1931, the company became Potlatch Forests, Inc. (PFI) after acquiring the operations of neighboring Clearwater Timber and Edward Rutledge Timber companies, which were facing financial difficulties as a result of lumber oversupply during the Great Depression. After the acquisitions, the company operated the original Potlatch mill as well as a sawmill in Elk River, Idaho (opened by Potlatch in 1907, closed in 1930), the Clearwater sawmill in Lewiston (opened in 1927), and the Rutledge sawmill in Coeur d&#x27;Alene (opened in 1916, closed in 1987).

=== Sustainable Forest Management ===
John Philip (Phil) Weyerhaeuser, Jr., nephew of Charles A. Weyerhaeuser, became president of PFI in 1931. Previously, as general manager of Clearwater Timber, he began the first program of sustainable forest management for timber as a crop in the United States. PFI continued this program and Phil Weyerhaeuser implemented it on a larger scale when he joined the family Weyerhaeuser Timber Company in 1933.

After Phil Weyerhaeuser&#x27;s departure, C.L. Billings took over as PFI&#x27;s general manager. During his tenure, which lasted until 1949, PFI continued to develop and practice sustained yield forest management in the Inland Northwest. PFI began paying out dividends in 1940.

=== Postwar Expansion ===

PFI grew significantly during the postwar economic expansion, broadening its product portfolio and enlarging its manufacturing and sales footprint nationally. Notably:

* In 1950, PFI started up its first pulp and paperboard mill at the site of the Lewiston sawmill
* In 1953, PFI acquired a paper mill in Pomona, California, and entered the tissue business
* In 1958, PFI acquired Southern Lumber Company and Bradley Lumber Company, based in Warren, Arkansas
* In 1963, PFI began producing private label tissue products from its Lewiston mill
* In 1964, PFI acquired Northwest Paper Company, based in Cloquet, Minnesota
* In 1964, PFI moved its executive offices from Lewiston to San Francisco, California
* In 1968, PFI purchased a plywood plant in St. Maries, Idaho
* In 1973, PFI became Potlatch Corporation, reflecting its diversification and expansion
* In 1977, Potlatch built its second pulp and paperboard mill in Arkansas City, Arkansas, naming it the Cypress Bend Mill

=== Modern Day ===
The Potlatch mill operated until mid-August 1981, and the company announced that mill closure would be permanent in 1983. In 1985, Canadian businessman Samuel Belzberg&#x27;s First City Financial Corporation attempted a takeover of the company. Potlatch eventually bought back the corporation&#x27;s 1.1 million shares, paying $8.1 million and ending the takeover bid. With the buyback, the stock returned to the control of the Weyerhaeuser family, the descendants of the original founder.

The Rutledge mill in Coeur d&#x27;Alene operated through October 1987; the site was acquired by Duane Hagadone the following year in a three-way land swap, and became the golf course (1991) of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Resort. Its buildings were allowed to be burned in June 1988; local fire departments used it as a training exercise.

After 32 years in San Francisco, California, corporate headquarters of Potlatch were moved from One Maritime Plaza to downtown Spokane in 1997; from 1931 to 1965, the company was based in Idaho at Lewiston.

In March 2002, Potlatch sold its Cloquet, Minnesota, pulp and printing papers facilities and associated assets to Sappi Limited for $480 million. This sale marked its exit from the coated printing papers business. Sappi closed the facilities and moved the production to its own plants in Maine at Skowhegan and Westbrook.

In 2006, Potlatch restructured to form a real estate investment trust (REIT). In this restructuring all of the company&#x27;s manufacturing operations are held by a wholly owned subsidiary, allowing the company to refocus on managing their large land holdings in Oregon, Idaho, Minnesota, and Arkansas.

In February 2018, Potlatch acquired Deltic Timber Corp., a smaller Arkansas-based timber company. Following the merger, the company was renamed PotlatchDeltic Corporation. The merged companies owned 2 million acres of timber in total.

==Properties==
The company owns over of timberland in rural Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. Its forest products are processed at seven company-owned facilities.

==Spin-off of Clearwater Paper==

In 2008, Clearwater Paper Corporation, previously a subsidiary of Potlatch, was created on December 9 via a spin-off with headquarters in Spokane; Gordon L. Jones, a vice-president of Potlatch, was the new company&#x27;s president and CEO.

Shares of Clearwater Paper (NYSE:CLW) stock were distributed to Potlatch shareholders at a ratio of 1 share of Clearwater stock for every 3.5 shares of Potlatch stock held, with fractional shares paid in cash. Clearwater stock began trading on December 16, 2008.

In August 2012, since Clearwater Paper&#x27;s stock had failed to rise, the company prepared to split in two and sell one or both businesses.

<text>In physics, the trinification model is a Grand Unified Theory proposed by Alvaro De Rújula, Howard Georgi and Sheldon Glashow in 1984.

==Details==
It states that the gauge group is either

:formula_1

or

:formula_2;

and that the fermions form three families, each consisting of the representations: formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5. The L includes a hypothetical right-handed neutrino, which may account for observed neutrino masses (see neutrino oscillations), and a similar sterile &quot;flavon.&quot;

There is also a formula_6 and maybe also a formula_7 scalar field called the Higgs field which acquires a vacuum expectation value. This results in a spontaneous symmetry breaking from

:formula_8 to formula_9.

The fermions branch (see restricted representation) as

:formula_10,

:formula_11,

:formula_12,

and the gauge bosons as

:formula_13,

:formula_14,

:formula_15.

Note that there are two Majorana neutrinos per generation (which is consistent with neutrino oscillations). Also, each generation has a pair of triplets formula_16 and formula_17, and doublets formula_18 and formula_19, which decouple at the GUT breaking scale due to the couplings

:formula_20

and

:formula_21.

Note that calling representations things like formula_22 and (8,1,1) is purely a physicist&#x27;s convention, not a mathematician&#x27;s, where representations are either labelled by Young tableaux or Dynkin diagrams with numbers on their vertices, but it is standard among GUT theorists.

Since the homotopy group

:formula_23,

this model predicts &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov magnetic monopoles.

Trinification is a maximal subalgebra of E6, whose matter representation has exactly the same representation and unifies the formula_24 fields. E6 adds 54 gauge bosons, 30 it shares with SO(10), the other 24 to complete its formula_25.

<text>Law and economics, or economic analysis of law, is the application of microeconomic theory to the analysis of law. The field emerged in the United States during the early 1960s, primarily from the work of scholars from the Chicago school of economics such as Aaron Director, George Stigler, and Ronald Coase. The field uses economics concepts to explain the effects of laws, assess which legal rules are economically efficient, and predict which legal rules will be promulgated. There are two major branches of law and economics; one based on the application of the methods and theories of neoclassical economics to the positive and normative analysis of the law, and a second branch which focuses on an institutional analysis of law and legal institutions, with a broader focus on economic, political, and social outcomes, and overlapping with analyses of the institutions of politics and governance.

==History==
=== Origin ===
The historical antecedents of law and economics can be traced back to the classical economists, who are credited with the foundations of modern economic thought. As early as the 18th century, Adam Smith discussed the economic effects of mercantilist legislation; later, David Ricardo opposed the British Corn Laws on the grounds that they hindered agricultural productivity; and Frédéric Bastiat, in his influential book &quot;The Law&quot;, examined the unintended consequences of legislation. However, to apply economics to analyze the law regulating nonmarket activities is relatively new. A European law &amp; economics movement around 1900 did not have any lasting influence. In a 1917 article analyzing the study of law and economics in American universities, Eugene Allen Gilmore concluded, &quot;the relation between law and economics seems either not to be perceived, or, if perceived, not to be regarded as a relationship desirable or feasible of very much cultivation.&quot;

Harold Luhnow, the head of the Volker Fund, not only financed F. A. Hayek in the U.S. starting in 1946, but he shortly thereafter financed Aaron Director&#x27;s coming to the University of Chicago in order to set up there a new center for scholars in law and economics. The University was headed by Robert Maynard Hutchins, a close collaborator of Luhnow&#x27;s in setting up the Chicago School, as it became commonly known. The university faculty then included a strong base of libertarian scholars, including Frank Knight, George Stigler, Henry Simons, Ronald Coase and Jacob Viner. Soon, it would also have not just Hayek himself, but Director&#x27;s brother-in-law and Stigler&#x27;s friend Milton Friedman, and also Robert Fogel, Robert Lucas, Eugene Fama, Richard Posner, and Gary Becker.

Historians Robert van Horn and Philip Mirowski described the development of modern economic concepts in &quot;The Rise of the Chicago School of Economics&quot;, a chapter of &quot;The Road from Mont Pelerin &quot;(2009); and historian Bruce Caldwell (a great admirer of von Hayek) filled in more details of the account in his chapter, &quot;The Chicago School, Hayek, and Neoliberalism&quot;, in &quot;Building Chicago Economics&quot; (2011). The field began with Gary Becker&#x27;s 1968 paper on crime (Becker also received a Nobel Prize). In 1972, Richard Posner, a law and economics scholar and the major advocate of the positive theory of efficiency, published the first edition of Economic Analysis of Law and founded &quot;The Journal of Legal Studies&quot;, both are regarded as important events. Gordon Tullock and Friedrich Hayek also wrote intensively in the area and influenced to spread of law and economics.

=== Founding ===
In 1958, Director founded &quot;The Journal of Law &amp; Economics&quot;, which he co-edited with Nobel laureate Ronald Coase, and which helped to unite the fields of law and economics with far-reaching influence. In 1960 and 1961, Ronald Coase and Guido Calabresi independently published two groundbreaking articles, &quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot; and &quot;Some Thoughts on Risk Distribution and the Law of Torts&quot;. This can be seen as the starting point for the modern school of law and economics.

In 1962, Aaron Director helped to found the Committee on a Free Society. Director&#x27;s appointment to the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School in 1946 began a half-century of intellectual productivity, although his reluctance about publishing left few writings behind. He taught antitrust courses at the law school with Edward Levi, who eventually would serve as Dean of Chicago&#x27;s Law School, President of the University of Chicago, and as U.S. Attorney General in the Ford administration. After retiring from the University of Chicago Law School in 1965, Director relocated to California and took a position at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution. He died September 11, 2004, at his home in Los Altos Hills, California, ten days before his 103rd birthday.

=== Later development ===
In the early 1970s, Henry Manne (a former student of Coase) set out to build a center for law and economics at a major law school. Ultimately, Manne established a center at George Mason, which became a center for the education of judges — many never previously exposed to the concepts of law and economics. Manne also attracted the support of the John M. Olin Foundation; Olin centers (or programs) for Law and Economics now exist at many universities.

==Positive and normative law and economics==
Economic analysis of law is usually divided into two subfields: positive and normative.

===Positive law and economics===
&#x27;Positive law and economics&#x27; uses economic analysis to predict the effects of various legal rules. So, for example, a positive economic analysis of tort law would predict the effects of a strict liability rule as opposed to the effects of a negligence rule. Positive law and economics has also at times purported to explain the development of legal rules, for example the common law of torts, in terms of their economic efficiency.

===Normative law and economics===
&quot;Normative law and economics&quot; goes one step further and makes policy recommendations based on the economic consequences of various policies. The key concept for normative economic analysis is efficiency, in particular, allocative efficiency.

A common concept of efficiency used by law and economics scholars is Pareto efficiency. A legal rule is Pareto efficient if it could not be changed so as to make one person better off without making another person worse off. A weaker conception of efficiency is Kaldor–Hicks efficiency. A legal rule is Kaldor–Hicks efficient if it could be made Pareto efficient by some parties compensating others as to offset their loss.

Nonetheless, the possibility of a clear distinction between positive and normative analysis has been questioned by Guido Calabresi who, in his book on &quot;The future of Law and Economics&quot; (2016: 21-22), believes that there is an &quot;actual - and unavoidable - existence of value judgments underlying much economic analysis&quot;

Uri Weiss proposed this alternative: &quot;It is common in law and economics to search for the law that will lead to the optimal outcome, providing the maximum size &#x27;pie,&#x27; and to think about maximizing happiness instead of minimizing pain. We prefer another approach: We do not try to identify games that will lead to the optimal result but to prevent games in which it is in the best interests of the players to come to an unjust result&quot;.

==Criminal law==
In 1968, Gary Becker, who would later win the Nobel prize for economics, published &quot;Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach&quot;. This work relied on the economic concept of utility as the basic unit of analysis. In 1985, in &quot;An Economic Theory of the Criminal Law&quot;, Posner set out an alternative approach that relied instead on wealth as the basic unit of analysis.

==Relationship to other disciplines and approaches==
As used by lawyers and legal scholars, the phrase &quot;law and economics&quot; refers to the application of microeconomic analysis to legal problems. Because of the overlap between legal systems and political systems, some of the issues in law and economics are also raised in political economy, constitutional economics and political science.

Approaches to the same issues from Marxist and critical theory/Frankfurt School perspectives usually do not identify themselves as &quot;law and economics&quot;. For example, research by members of the critical legal studies movement and the sociology of law considers many of the same fundamental issues as does work labeled &quot;law and economics&quot;, though from a vastly different perspective. The law and political economy movement also analyzes similar concepts using an entirely different approach.

The one wing that represents a non-neoclassical approach to &quot;law and economics&quot; is the Continental (mainly German) tradition that sees the concept starting out of the governance and public policy (&quot;Staatswissenschaften&quot;) approach and the German Historical school of economics; this view is represented in the &quot;Elgar Companion to Law and Economics&quot; (2nd ed. 2005) and—though not exclusively—in the &quot;European Journal of Law and Economics&quot;. Here, consciously non-neoclassical approaches to economics are used for the analysis of legal (and administrative/governance) problems.

Law and economics is closely related to jurimetrics, the application of probability and statistics to legal questions.

==Influence==
The economic analysis of law has been influential in the United States as well as elsewhere. Judicial opinions use economic analysis and the theories of law and economics with some regularity, in the US but also, increasingly, in Commonwealth countries and in Europe. The influence of law and economics has also been felt in legal education, with graduate programs in the subject being offered in a number of countries. The influence of law and economics in civil law countries may be gauged from the availability of textbooks of law and economics, in English as well as in other European languages (Schäfer and Ott 2004; Mackaay 2013).

Many law schools in North America, Europe, and Asia have faculty members with a graduate degree in economics. In addition, many professional economists now study and write on the relationship between economics and legal doctrines. Anthony Kronman, former dean of Yale Law School, has written that &quot;the intellectual movement that has had the greatest influence on American academic law in the past quarter-century [of the 20th Century]&quot; is law and economics.

==Criticisms==

Despite its influence, the law and economics movement has been criticized from a number of directions. This is especially true of normative law and economics. Because most law and economics scholarship operates within a neoclassical framework, fundamental criticisms of neoclassical economics have been drawn from other, competing frameworks, though there are numerous internal critiques as well. Yet other schools of economic thought have emerged and have been applied to the work of law and economics in, for example, the work of Edgardo Buscaglia and Robert Cooter in the book &quot;Law and Economics of Development&quot;.

=== Rational choice theory ===
Critics of the economic analysis of legal questions have argued that normative economic analysis does not capture the importance of human rights and concerns for distributive justice. Some of the heaviest criticisms of law and economics come from the critical legal studies movement, in particular Duncan Kennedy and Mark Kelman. Jon D. Hanson, of Harvard Law School, argues that our legal, economic, political, and social systems are unduly influenced by an individualistic model of behavior based on preferences, instead of a model that incorporates cognitive biases and social norms.

=== Pareto efficiency ===
Additional criticism has been directed toward the assumed benefits of law and policy designed to increase allocative efficiency when such assumptions are modeled on &quot;first-best&quot; (Pareto optimal) general-equilibrium conditions. Under the theory of the second best, for example, if the fulfillment of a subset of optimal conditions cannot be met under any circumstances, it is incorrect to conclude that the fulfillment of &quot;any&quot; subset of optimal conditions will necessarily result in an increase in allocative efficiency.

Consequently, any expression of public policy whose purported purpose is an unambiguous increase in allocative efficiency (for example, consolidation of research and development costs through increased mergers and acquisitions resulting from a systematic relaxation of antitrust laws) is, according to critics, fundamentally incorrect, as there is no general reason to conclude that an increase in allocative efficiency is more likely than a decrease.

Essentially, the &quot;first-best&quot; neoclassical analysis fails to properly account for various kinds of general-equilibrium feedback relationships that result from intrinsic Pareto imperfections.

Another critique comes from the fact that there is no unique optimal result. Warren Samuels in his 2007 book, &quot;The Legal-Economic Nexus&quot;, argues, &quot;efficiency in the Pareto sense cannot dispositively be applied to the definition and assignment of rights themselves, because efficiency requires an antecedent determination of the rights (23–4)&quot;.

=== &quot;Internal&quot; analytical criticisms ===
Relatedly, legal scholarship also has criticized the movement for allowing its framing of models to dictate its results, for over-emphasizing or under-emphasizing specific incentives and costs, and for building models that do not degrade &quot;gracefully&quot; (and therefore have difficulty modeling reality).
In other words, the law and economics movement may not achieve &quot;efficiency&quot;, even to the extent allocative efficiency is the goal of the law.

=== Criminal methodology ===
Cullerne Bown has criticised Posner&#x27;s approach on methodological grounds. He concludes that Posner&#x27;s approach to evaluating policies in the criminal process is methodologically invalid and that &quot;these failings in turn make the entirety of his conclusions on the criminal process unreliable&quot;.

=== Responses to criticism ===
Law and economics has adapted to some of these criticisms and been developed in a variety of directions. One important trend has been the application of game theory to legal problems. Other developments have been the incorporation of behavioral economics into economic analysis of law, and the increasing use of statistical and econometrics techniques. Within the legal academy, the term socio-economics has been applied to economic approaches that are self-consciously broader than the neoclassical tradition.

Property rights, which are analyzed using economic analysis, are seen as fundamental human rights by defenders of law and economics.

<text>William de Mandeville (died before 1130) was an Anglo-Norman baron and Constable of the Tower of London.

==Life==

William de Mandeville inherited the estates of his father Geoffrey de Mandeville, the Domesday tenant-in-chief, around 1100. He was Constable of the Tower of London at that time, and thus keeper of the first person known to be imprisoned there for political reasons, Ranulf Flambard. Flambard&#x27;s escape in February 1101 would have significant consequences for William.

It is not known if William was in some way complicit in the escape of Flambard, or was simply a careless keeper. Regardless, as a punishment, in 1103 Henry I confiscated the three richest of William&#x27;s Essex estates, Sawbridgeworth, Saffron Walden, and Great Waltham, comprising about a third of his entire holdings, as well as the constableship giving them to Eudo Dapifer, William’s father-in-law. Little is known of William&#x27;s activities after this.

William married Margaret, daughter of Eudo FitzHubert (&quot;Dapifer&quot;) and Rohese de Clare. Widowed, Margaret married secondly Othuer fitz Earl (d. 1120), illegitimate son of Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester. William and Margaret&#x27;s son Geoffrey de Mandeville would recover the seized estates and the constableship during the reign of King Stephen.

==Family==
* Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex (d. 1144)
*Beatrice de Mandeville (d. 19 Apr. 1197), married William de Say (d. Aug. 1144). Their granddaughter Beatrice de Say took some of the Mandeville inheritance to her husband, Geoffrey fitz Peter.

<text>In ethics, welfarism is a theory that well-being, what is good for someone or what makes a life worth living, is the only thing that has intrinsic value. In its most general sense, it can be defined as descriptive theory about what has value but some philosophers also understand welfarism as a moral theory, that what one should do is ultimately determined by considerations of well-being. The right action, policy or rule is the one leading to the maximal amount of well-being. In this sense, it is often seen as a type of consequentialism, and can take the form of utilitarianism.

It is important for various discussions and arguments about welfarism how the nature of well-being is understood. Pure welfarists hold that this value is directly determined by the individual degrees of well-being of each entity. Impure welfarists, on the other hand, include other factors related to well-being, like whether the well-being is equally distributed among sentient entities. Hedonists try to give a more substantial account of well-being by holding that all and only experiences of pleasure and pain constitute someone&#x27;s well-being. This view is rejected by desire theorists, who equate well-being with desire fulfillment. Objective list theories, on the other hand, also include objective or mind-independent factors as constituents of well-being.

Diverse arguments in favor of and against welfarism are found in the academic literature. Arguments in favor often focus on general intuitions about the importance of well-being concerning most evaluative judgments. Critics of welfarism frequently concentrate on specific counterexamples in which these general intuitions seem to fail, including cases of malicious pleasures, the value of beauty and art, and the so-called &quot;repugnant conclusion&quot;. Criticisms are sometimes addressed specifically to welfarism itself, but they also often arise within discussions of other theories, like utilitarianism or hedonism, and are directed at welfarism only implicitly by concerning the welfarist aspects of these theories. Some objections are directed specifically at pure welfarism but are avoided by impure welfarism. Welfarism has been influential in the fields of law and economics.

== Definition ==
As a descriptive theory of value, welfarism provides a general framework for answering questions of value, such as which choices are good or which of two alternatives is better. In a more normative sense it consists of three theses: that individual well-being exists, that it has moral significance and that nothing else has moral significance.

=== As theory of value ===
In this sense, welfarism is the view that well-being is the only thing that has value. The value in question is usually understood as intrinsic value or what is good in itself, as contrasted with extrinsic value, which belongs to things that are useful as a means for something else.

Welfarism implies that any two outcomes that are identical in terms of well-being have the same value, no matter how much they differ otherwise. The well-being in question is usually understood in its widest sense, i.e. as the well-being not just of humans but of any sentient being. This can be articulated by stating that the value of outcomes ultimately only depends on the benefits of each one affected. Expressed in terms of possible worlds, welfarism holds that &quot;the relative value of possible worlds is fully determined by how individuals are faring&quot;. Expressed in terms of a function, welfarism is the thesis that &quot;the relative goodness of alternative states of affairs must be based exclusively on, and taken as an increasing function of, the respective collections of individual utilities in these states&quot;.

Welfarism as a theory of value can be interpreted as one theoretical commitment of utilitarianism together with consequentialism. Consequentialism is the theory that only acts leading to the best possible overall outcome are morally required or permissible. Consequentialism by itself leaves it open how to evaluate which of two possible outcomes is better. But this topic is addressed by welfarism. Combined, they constitute utilitarianism, i.e. the view that one should act as to produce &quot;the greatest amount of good for the greatest number&quot;.

=== As a moral theory ===
It is commonly accepted by many ethical theories that considerations of well-being play an important role for how one should act. Some authors see welfarism as including the ethical thesis that morality fundamentally depends on the welfare of individuals. For example, by learning that one alternative is better in terms of well-being than another, an agent usually has a reason to act such as to bring about the first rather than the second alternative. But welfarism, in its ethical sense, goes beyond this common-sense agreement by holding that, ultimately, well-being is the only thing that matters in terms of what one ought to do. This involves not just determining what is best but also includes the factor of what is in the agent&#x27;s power to do, i.e. which possible actions are available to the agent. In this sense, welfarism is usually seen as a form of consequentialism, which holds that actions, policies or rules should be evaluated on the basis of their consequences.

One argument commonly cited in favor of welfarism is that nothing would be good or bad in a world without sentient beings. So it would not matter whether such a world had clean water, global warming or natural disasters. The reason for this is that, according to welfarism, there would be neither positive nor negative well-being: nothing would matter because nothing had an impact on anyone&#x27;s well-being. Another argument is that many of the things commonly seen as valuable have a positive impact on someone&#x27;s well-being. In this sense, health and economic prosperity are valuable because they tend to increase overall well-being. On the other hand, many things seen as bad, such as disease or ignorance, tend to have a negative impact on well-being, either directly or indirectly. There are also various indirect arguments for welfarism in the form of criticisms of the theoretical competitors of welfarism. It is sometimes claimed that some of them fail either to properly draw the distinction between what is valuable at all and what is ultimately valuable or to take all consequences into account.

== Types ==
Within welfarism, there are disagreements as to the exact way in which well-being determines value. For this reason, theorists often distinguish different types of well-being.

=== Pure vs. impure welfarism ===
Among the different formulations of welfarism, it is possible to distinguish between pure and impure versions. &quot;Pure welfarism&quot; holds that the value of a possible world only depends on the individual degrees of well-being of the different entities in it. Utilitarians, for example, focus on the sum total of everyone&#x27;s well-being and hold that an action is right if it maximizes this sum total. &quot;Impure welfarism&quot;, on the other hand, involves other factors related to well-being as well. These factors can include whether the well-being is distributed equally among the entities and to what degree the entities deserve the level of well-being they have.

=== Weak paretianism ===
One of the least controversial forms of welfarism is called weak paretianism. It holds that one state is better than another state if it is better for everyone involved: if everyone&#x27;s well-being is higher in the first state. However, that principle remains quiet on cases where a trade-off is involved: if the well-being of some is increased while it is decreased for others. Egalitarians, on the other hand, argue that it is most important to increase the well-being of those that are generally worse off. This idea can be captured by a prioritarianist approach that takes everyone&#x27;s well-being into account but gives greater weight to the well-being of those who fare worse. One argument against this type of approach is that it strays away from the original intuition driving welfarism: that well-being is the only thing &quot;intrinsically&quot; valuable. But equality is a relation &quot;between&quot; entities and not &quot;intrinsic&quot; to any of them. An important requirement usually associated with welfarist theories is that they ought to be agent-neutral. According to agent-neutrality, it should not matter to whom the well-being belongs but only that it is higher or better distributed overall.

== Nature of well-being ==
Central to many discussions of welfarism is the question concerning the nature of well-being. In many cases, it depends on one&#x27;s conception of well-being whether a certain argument for or against welfarism is successful. In its most general sense, well-being refers to what is good for someone or what makes a life worth living. This is usually taken to imply a subjective component, i.e. that well-being always belongs to an individual and is expressed by how this individual feels. Despite the common characterization in positive terms, well-being is normally understood as arising in degrees that may also be negative. The term &quot;well-being&quot; is often used synonymously with other terms like personal good, being in the agent&#x27;s interest, prudential value, eudaimonia and utility. It is generally agreed that only sentient beings are capable of well-being.

Theories of well-being try to give a more substantial account of what constitutes well-being besides the above-mentioned general characteristics. These theories can roughly be divided into hedonistic theories, desire theories, and objective list theories.

=== Hedonist theories ===
&quot;Hedonists&quot; hold that all and only experiences of pleasure and pain constitute someone&#x27;s well-being. In this context, pleasure and pain are understood in the widest sense, i.e. as whatever feels good or bad. The paradigmatic cases are sensory experiences associated, for example, with sex or injury. But it also includes other types of experiences, like the intellectual joy at grasping a new theory or like suffering an existential crisis.

=== Desire theories ===
According to &quot;desire theories&quot;, well-being consists in desire-fulfillment or getting what one wants. In many concrete cases, hedonists and desire theorists are in agreement since desire-fulfillment and pleasure often go hand in hand: getting what one wants tends to be pleasurable, just as failing to get what one wants tends to be unpleasant. But there are a few exceptions where the two come apart. This is the case, for example, when the agent does not know that one of their desires has already been fulfilled. Another counterexample is due to bad desires, the fulfillment of which would have terrible consequences for the agent. To avoid these counterexamples, some desire theories focus not on what the agent actually wants but what the agent would want if they were well informed.

=== Objective list theories ===
&quot;Objective list theories&quot; stand in contrast to hedonism and desire theories in that they include objective factors that are independent of the agent&#x27;s mental states. Such factors can include friendship, having virtues or perfecting human nature. Objections to objective list theories often center on the plausibility of the claim that subject-independent factors can determine a person&#x27;s well-being even if the person does not care about these factors. For example, it is questionable whether having friends would improve the well-being of someone who does not care about friendship.

== Criticism ==
=== Pleasure ===
An important argument against welfarism concerns the value of pleasure. There is very wide agreement among welfarists that pleasure is either the only or at least one central constituent of well-being. The problem arises due to the fact that not all pleasures seem to be equally valuable. Traditionally, this debate focused on the difference between lower and higher pleasures. John Stuart Mill, for example, argued that the &quot;lower pleasures&quot; of the body are less valuable than the &quot;higher pleasures&quot; of the mind. On this view, the pleasure one takes in studying a philosophical theory is more valuable than the pleasure one takes from eating at one&#x27;s favorite restaurant, even if the degrees of these two pleasures should be equal. If true, this would pose an important objection to &quot;pure welfarism&quot; since it points to a rift between the degree of well-being and value. But this problem may be avoided by &quot;impure welfarism&quot;. In the contemporary debate, it has been suggested that some forms of pleasure even have a negative value, for example, malicious pleasures like schadenfreude. Such examples pose even more serious problems for welfarism since the pleasure seems to be good for the agent and thereby constitutes well-being while at the same time having a negative value. One response to this type of counterexample is to contend that malicious pleasures have positive value and to argue that the negative element does not concern the &quot;value simpliciter&quot; of the pleasure experience itself but the &quot;moral value&quot; of the person&#x27;s character instead.

=== Beauty ===
Another type of objection focuses on the value of beauty. In this regard, it has been claimed that beautiful things possess a value that is independent of anyone&#x27;s well-being. G. E. Moore, for example, holds that a world is better if it is beautiful than if it is ugly, even if it does not contain any sentient beings. But not everyone shares Moore&#x27;s intuition concerning this example. In this sense, it has been argued that the value of beauty lies not in the beautiful object by itself but in the positive experience of it. A similar argument against welfarism is due to Susan Wolf, who affirms that one cannot account for the value of great works of art by only focusing on the well-being they cause. Ben Bramble has objected to this line of argument by pointing out that great works of art can cause well-being in a variety of ways. These ways are not just restricted to the pleasure one takes while perceiving them but include other components, like the motivation to discover similar works of art or to share one&#x27;s experience with friends.

=== Definition of well-being ===
A different line of argument suggests that welfarism is false since, strictly speaking, there is no well-being. The underlying idea of this thesis is that well-being is what is good &quot;for someone&quot;. Based on this definition, G. E. Moore argues that there is no well-being since goodness cannot be restricted to a person in this sense, i.e. there is good or bad in an absolute sense but there is no good or bad &quot;for someone&quot;.

=== Different evaluations between subjective values ===
One more problem arises when comparing alternatives in which the well-being at stake does not belong to the same persons in both alternatives but to different persons. This is the case, for example, when deciding whether it would be better for future generations to have a low number of people, each with a very high well-being, in contrast to a high number of people, each with a well-being that is just slightly positive. According to one perspective, what counts is the total well-being. On this view, having enough people with a slightly positive well-being would be better than having few people with a very high well-being. This view has been rejected by Derek Parfit, who termed it the &quot;repugnant conclusion.&quot; Another solution holds that what matters is not the &quot;total well-being&quot; but the &quot;average well-being&quot;. On this view, the alternative concerning few people with a very high well-being would be preferable.

=== Distribution of well-being ===
Another criticism, directed specifically at pure welfarism, is based on a common intuition that morally good people deserve a high degree of well-being but morally bad people do not. In this sense, the well-being of morally bad people would either be less valuable or even have a negative value. Immanuel Kant expresses a similar idea by stating that the &quot;highest good&quot; is &quot;Virtue and happiness together ... in a person&quot;. This point is also emphasized by W. D. Ross, who holds that &quot;justice&quot;, defined as happiness in proportion to merit, is intrinsically valuable. Impure welfarists can accommodate this intuition by holding that the well-being of morally bad people has less value. But this adjustment is not available to pure welfarism.

One more objection that concerns pure welfarism in particular is due to the common impression that it is more important to increase the well-being of those that are worse off. So when faced with the question of whether to raise the well-being of a happy person or an unhappy person, one should benefit the unhappy person. This intuition seems to be based on the idea that what matters is not just a high total well-being, as suggested by pure welfarism, but also an equal distribution. One way to explain the initial intuition is to formulate the problem not in terms of well-being but in terms of resources. In this sense, giving one hundred dollars to a poor person would be better than giving it to a rich person. This can be explained by pure welfarism since the same amount of resources would mean more to the poor person and thereby have a bigger impact on their well-being.

== Influence ==
=== In law and economics ===
&quot;Welfarist&quot; views have been influential in the law and economics movement. Steven Shavell and Louis Kaplow, for example, have argued in &quot;Fairness versus Welfare&quot; that welfare should be the exclusive criteria by which legal analysts evaluate legal policy choices. Penal welfarism is a theory in the study of criminal justice which holds that prisoners should have the right and the positive motivation to gain opportunities for advancement within the criminal justice system. Economists usually think of individual welfare in terms of utility functions, a perspective in which social welfare can be conceived as an aggregation of individual utilities or utility functions.

<doc id="298078" wikidata="Q7259581" url="?curid=298078" title="Pulp and paper industry in Europe">
<text>The [[pulp and paper industry]] in Europe accounts for about a quarter of the world production and is a major employer. The leading producing countries are Finland, Sweden and Germany. The industry is a large user of renewable energy and achieved a recycling rate of 71.5% in 2015.

==Production data== 
The European paper industry produces more than 90 million tonnes of paper and board and more than 36 million tonnes of pulp annually. Directly it provides 178,000 jobs and indirectly 3 million jobs along the forest and paper chain. The European paper industry&#x27;s turnover is approximately 180 billion euros. 633 companies are represented by the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) and these account for 23% of world production.
The raw material consists of 40% recycled fibre and 44% virgin pulp, the balance being other pulp (1%) and non-fibrous materials (15%). 94% of the wood requirements come from managed forests within Europe.

In national terms the largest &quot;paper&quot; producer is Germany, followed by Finland, Sweden and France; the largest &quot;pulp&quot; producers are Finland and Sweden. The two largest European companies in the sector, Stora Enso and UPM, are both based in Finland.

==Renewable energy==
The European pulp and paper industry is the largest industrial producer and consumer of energy from renewable sources. Its share of biomass-based energy exceeds 55% of its total primary annual energy consumption of 1,301,483 TJ. The sector has adopted an objective to reduce carbon emissions of 80% by 2050, which is likely to involve new technological methods to reduce water usage and thus reduce energy usage.

==Recycling==
Paper for recycling is a major source of the paper industry&#x27;s raw material, which is why the industry aims to maximise the European recycling rate. The recycling rate along the paper value chain (ERPC) reached 71.5% in 2015 - exceeding the voluntary target of 70% that was set by the industries declaration in 2011. The total amount of paper collected and sent to recycling in paper mills in 2015 was almost 56 million tonnes. 18.2% was exported for recycling in third countries in 2015. The recycling rate is now considered close to its maximum possible.

==Innovation==
In 2011, the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) launched the “2050 Roadmap to a low-carbon bioeconomy”, as the first European manufacturing industry sector to react to the European Commission&#x27;s roadmap towards a low-carbon economy with its own sector roadmap. The “Two Team Project”, which ran in 2013, sought to find the most innovative breakthrough technologies of the industry with two teams competing against each other. Eight breakthrough technologies made it to the publication. 
In 2015, CEPI collected more than 40 of the industry&#x27;s most innovative products in another publication, “The Age of Fibre”, showcasing once again the versatility and innovation in the industry.

<text>SBB (first known as &quot;Silesian Blues Band&quot;, later as &quot;Szukaj, Burz, Buduj&quot; – Polish for &quot;Search, Break up, Build&quot;) is a Polish progressive rock band formed in 1971 in Siemianowice, Upper Silesia. It was made up of multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Józef Skrzek, guitarist Apostolis Anthimos, drummer Jerzy Piotrowski, and sound engineer Grzegorz Maniecki. SBB was one of the most popular super-groups in Poland and Europe in the 1970s.

The band was one of the forerunners of progressive rock and jazz-rock and attracted many influential jazz musicians, who often performed with the band. The trumpeter Andrzej Przybielski and the saxophonist &amp; bass clarinetist Tomasz Szukalski developed a long lasting association with SBB.

==History==

=== Niemen (1971–1973) ===
From 1971 until late 1973, SBB performed as Czesław Niemen&#x27;s backing band, Grupa Niemen. During this time, it performed at the &quot;Rock &amp; Jazz Now!&quot; opening show for the Olympic Games in Munich, organized by Joachim-Ernst Berendt and featuring Charles Mingus, John McLaughlin &amp; Mahavishnu Orchestra. SBB also toured accompanying Jack Bruce. SBB&#x27;s collaboration with Niemen can be heard on 5 albums. In Munich SBB recorded two LP&#x27;s for CBS Records International, starting a long lasting friendship and collaboration with Reinhold Mack. Reinhold&#x27;s son Julian Mack would later perform on SBB&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;New Century&quot;.

=== Classic run (1974–1980) ===

In 1974, the newly formed SBB recorded a live album of their concert at Warsaw&#x27;s Klub Stodoła on April 18-19, 1974. When the album was released, it met with great commercial success, reaching a price on the black market four times higher than the retail price.

The group regularly toured Czechoslovakia, East and West Germany, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium, where, in 1978, SBB won the OIRT award - the &quot;Gouden Zeezwaluw (Golden Seaswallow)&quot;. 

The band split up in 1980, exactly 13 months before the proclamation of Martial Law in Poland. Józef Skrzek, Tomasz Szukalski and the band&#x27;s technical crew continued as the &quot;Józef Skrzek - Tomasz Szukalski Duo&quot; and the &quot;Józef Skrzek Formation&quot; taking part in the prophetic movie &quot;The War of the Worlds: Next Century&quot; produced 11 months before the proclamation of Martial Law in Poland. After the proclamation of martial law, Apostolis Anthimos joined the jazz trumpeter Tomasz Stańko and the Greek band of George Dalaras, Jerzy Piotrowski joined or played with various bands, e.g. Kombi, Young Power, Krzak, Martyna Jakubowicz and Stanisław Sojka and Józef Skrzek performed mainly organ music in sacral buildings.

=== Reunions (1991–present) ===

SBB was briefly re-activated in 1991, 1993, 1998 and finally in 2000. After reactivation SBB also briefly toured in the United States (1994, drummer Jerzy Piotrowski stayed in the USA) and Russia and in 2006 performed as the highlight of the Baja Prog festival in Mexicali, Mexico (with the drummer Paul Wertico). 
In 2016 Michał Urbaniak began to play with the band.

<text>Dobrich ( ; ; ) is the 9th most populated city in Bulgaria, the administrative centre of Dobrich Province and the capital of the region of Southern Dobrudzha. It is located in the northeastern part of the country, 30 km west of the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, not far from resorts such as Albena, Balchik, and Golden Sands. In January 2012, Dobrich was inhabited by 79,269 people within the city limits. The city is named after the Bulgarian medieval lord of the surrounding region - Dobrotitsa. Agriculture is the most developed branch of the economy. The most popular types of agricultural products in the region are wheat and lavender oil.

Dobrich Knoll on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Dobrich. A point of interest is the Dobrich TV Tower.

==Etymology==

The city is named after the 14th-century Dobrujan ruler Dobrotitsa, from the Slavic root &quot;dobr&quot;, &quot;good&quot;.

The city has had several name changes throughout its history. When the town was founded in the 16th century during the Ottoman period, it bore the name Hacıoğlu Pazarcık after the Turkish travelling merchant who established the settlement, and to distinguish it from the larger town of Pazarcık (today Pazardzhik).

After the autonomous Bulgarian state was established, the citizens of the town voted to change the name to Dobrich on 19 February 1882. When Romania annexed Southern Dobruja in 1913 after the Second Balkan War, the city was known as Bazargic, the Romanian variant of its earlier Turkish name.

On 25 September 1940, per the Treaty of Craiova, the city reverted to Bulgarian rule and &quot;Dobrich&quot; became the name once again. In 1949, during the Communist era, the city was renamed Tolbukhin in honour of Soviet Marshal Fyodor Tolbukhin. Finally, after the end of the Zhivkov regime, the name of the city was changed back to &quot;Dobrich&quot; by presidential decree on 19 September 1990.

== History ==
The first evidence of settlement in what is now Dobrich dates from the 4th or 3rd century BC. Under the Latin name Abrittum, it was a city of the Roman province of Moesia Inferior, important enough to become a suffragan bishopric of the Metropolitan of the capital, Marcianopolis, but the Catholic diocese faded later. Ruins from 2nd to 4th centuries AD and the 7th to 11th centuries have also been found, including a Bulgar necropolis featuring pagan graves in the centre of the city.

During the 11th century, Pecheneg invasions devastated the interior of Dobruja, leaving many settlements in the region uninhabited at the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire.

The settlement was founded for a second time in the 16th century by the Turkish merchant &quot;Hacıoğlu Pazarcık&quot;, whose name it bore until 1882. According to Ottoman data from 1646–1650, there were over 1,000 houses in the city, about 100 shops, three inns, three Turkish baths, twelve mosques and twelve schools. From the 17th to the 19th century, the city developed as a handicraft, trade and agricultural centre, being famous for its weaving, homespun tailoring, coppersmith&#x27;s trade, leather-work and agricultural products, such as wheat, linseed, wool and cheese. At the beginning of the 19th century, the city&#x27;s population reached 12,000, many of whom refugees from eastern Bulgaria after the Russo-Turkish Wars. The cultural appearance of the city was also formed. The first Orthodox church was built in 1843. The city was liberated from the Ottoman Empire on 27 January 1878 and renamed Dobrich on 19 February 1882.

After the Treaty of Bucharest of 1913 (confirmed by the Treaty of Neuilly of 1919), Dobrich and the whole of Southern Dobruja were incorporated in Romania for a period until 1940. During that time, the city bore the name &quot;Bazargic&quot;, which is a transformation of the earlier Turkish name &quot;Hacıoğlu Pazarcık&quot;, and was centre of Caliacra County (județ in Romanian). On 25 September 1940, the Bulgarian army marched into the city after signing Treaty of Craiova on September 7, 1940; date celebrated as the city&#x27;s holiday, later changed to September 25.

In 1949, during the period of Communist rule, Dobrich was renamed &quot;Tolbukhin&quot; (Толбухин) after Marshal of the Soviet Union Fyodor Tolbukhin. On 19 September 1990, a presidential decree restored the city&#x27;s old name of Dobrich. Despite the renewing of the name Dobrich architecturally maintains an ex-communist outlook even in the 21st century. The vehicle registration plate code for the region has also remained unchanged; it is the abbreviation TX (from ТолбуХин; Тolbukhin).

==Geography==
Dobrich is located in the northeastern part of the country, 30 km west of the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, not far from resorts such as Albena, Balchik, and Golden Sands.

=== Climate ===
=== Ecology ===
==== Air ====
In the municipality of Dobrich, the quality of atmospheric air is monitored by the mobile station for emission control of the Regional Inspectorate for the Environment and Water Resources (RIEWR) - Varna. The station is equipped with automatic monitoring devices measuring the quantities of carbon oxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfuric dioxide, and fine dust particles.
The municipality is implementing a program for decreasing the quantities of dust particles, which was adopted by the municipal council in 2003.

==== Water resources ====
Surface water resources are insufficient in the region, with often water shortages. The town is supplied with water from drill wells and water catchment areas located near the town. Eight pumping stations provide bacteria-free drinking water which does not need further treatment. The water sources are in constant operation. A security area surrounds each source, and the water distribution is controlled by computers. The municipality boasts a complete water supply network.

==== Green areas ====

The municipal Green System Plan examines the status of the existing urban and suburban green areas, as well as the variety of the plant species. The Green System includes the following categories of green areas: public parks and gardens, special parks and gardens, sanitary/protective greening, transportation greening (streets and roads), and limited-usage greening.

==Economy==

Today Dobrich is a modern industrial-agricultural and transport center of the Dobrudzha region, one of the ten largest cities in Bulgaria - an important cultural, economic and administrative center in the northeastern economic region of the country. The economic profile of Dobrich is determined by the food industry, which provides over 50% of the volume of urban industry, as well as light industry. The rich agricultural area provides valuable raw materials.

The specific features of the region are a prerequisite for the development of agriculture as one of the priority sectors in the economy of the district. Dobrich produces high quality products, which are processed on site and are competitive on both domestic and foreign markets. The arable agricultural land in the territory of the municipality is 7700 ha. The main crops are wheat, corn, sunflower. The structure-determining branch in the municipality is the food industry. The share in the national scale in the production of dairy products, bread and confectionery, oil and margarine, wines and spirits is solid. The city hosts the largest agricultural exhibition in the country, &quot;Agriculture and everything about it.&quot; A significant share of the city&#x27;s economy is occupied by light industry with the production of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s clothing, furniture, fabrics, leather, jacquard products.

The extremely favorable combination of natural and climatic conditions in the region are a real prerequisite for the high level of agricultural development. It has always been and is now also one of the priority sectors in the district&#x27;s economy. Apart from being the center of a large agricultural region, the municipality of Dobrich has a well-formed industrial complex. The city has developed the branches of the food industry / production of dairy products, sausages, pasta, wines and spirits, soft drinks; poultry meat products, flour, bread and confectionery /, light industry / production of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s clothing, leather clothing, furniture and footwear /, mechanical engineering / production of batteries, machinery and equipment for milk processing, semi-trailers and containers, agricultural machinery , radiators and filters for cars and trucks, plastic products /, construction / construction of buildings and facilities, design, civil and industrial construction /. Another form of trade development is the organization of annual fairs and exhibitions on a national and international scale, such as &quot;Agriculture and everything about it&quot;, &quot;National Exchange for Seeds and Seedlings&quot;, &quot;Beekeeping&quot;, &quot;Trade, wines and delicacies&quot; , &quot;Made in Bulgaria&quot;, as the role of &quot;Dobrich Fair&quot; AD is essential for their successful implementation.

===Agriculture===

Agriculture is the most developed branch of the economy. The main reason for this is the environment – climate, soils and clean lands. 81% of all the land in Dobrich is agricultural, almost 4,000,000 decares. More than 70% of it is cultivated, which makes Dobrich №1 cultivated region in the country. Farming, plant-growing and stock-breeding are the most important part of the economy in Dobrich. Dobrudja territory, called the “granary of Bulgaria” is part of the district. Some of the end products made in Dobrich are: bread and flour products, all kinds of sausages, milk and dairy products, poultry products, margarine and vegetable oils, wine, soft drinks.
The biggest bird-farm is located in the district. Other factories of great importance are the milk factory (one of the biggest factories in Bulgaria), the bread factory (one of the biggest factories in Bulgaria). Additional important products from other industries are cement, electric appliances, clothes, confection, furniture, car batteries, containers and there are many other factories from the food and beverage industry.

===Gasification===
The municipal strategy provides that the household, utility and industrial sectors be supplied with gas under a project for gasification. The network of gas pipelines has been extended to 43,808 metres. Currently we are working on the gasification of the residential areas. All municipal establishments from the educational, administrative, healthcare and social service sectors have already been covered by the gas supply network.

====Communications====
Dobrich has six offices for postal services. They cover the whole territory of the town thus meeting the needs of the community. The municipality of Dobrich is wired by two local landline telecommunication networks which operate four analogue and one digital exchanges.

== Population ==
As of the 2021 Census, Dobrich is inhabited by 79,269 people within the city limits. The number of the residents of the city (not the municipality) reached its peak in the period 1986-1991 when exceeded 110,000.

Total: 91,030

The percentage of Orthodox Christians, according to the 2001 census data, is 86%, whereas around 10% of the population are adherents of the Muslim faith.

====Church &quot;St. George&quot;====

The church is the oldest church from the Revival period in Dobrich. It is located in the center of the town, in the immediate vicinity of the Ethnographic house. The building is a cultural heritage site. It was built in 1864, on the spot of an older Christian church from 1843 that burned down during the Crimean War, together with the lower Bulgarian neighborhood.

In an architectural sense, the new church is a three-nave basilica. It was built with the donations of the Bulgarian population in Dobrich and the Dobrich district, in the courtyard of the great Bulgarian Revival figure Ivan Hadzhi Valkov. It is assumed that the church was made by unknown craftsmen who belonged or at least were familiar with the school of the famous Bulgarian master Kolyu Ficheto. The frescoes inside are made by Kozma Blazhenov, a representative of the Debar Art School, who also made the engraved iconostasis. The icons were painted by painters famous at the time – Nedko Todorovic from Zheravna, Haralambi Todorov from Pirdop and Nikolay Vasilev from Shumen. The church was consecrated in 1889 by Bishop Simeon.

====“Holy Trinity” Church====

The “Holy Trinity” church is located in the center of Dobrich. The older church building that was situated at this place was built in 1859, to the left of the entrance of today’s church. It was later joined by the first school in the town, where the mutual instruction approach was used. The present church was built in 1911. Architecturally speaking, it is a classic three-nave basilica, a dome and a bell tower. The icons of its iconostasis were painted by Gospodin Zhelyazkov, a student of Repin.

====Armenian Church “Saint Hovhaness”====

== Culture ==
== Places of interest ==

=== The City Park St. George ===

The City Park St. George or the city garden as known among people of Dobrich is the most visited place in Dobrich by its citizens and guests. In the far year of 1867 Bildieto (the City Municipal Council) selects a place in the neighborhood of Karabokluka for establishment of the first city garden. An enormous contribution for development of the city-park art has the family of Gradinarovi. Its area is 430 dca and is divided into several sectors – “The Old Garden”, Children’s sector – a zone for games and fun, park lakes zone, zone of rock terrace gardens, sports zone etc. In 1999 the old garden of the city park is announced to be a monument of culture and garden park art.
The park is located immediately next to the central pedestrian zone in Dobrich. The park is one of the five oldest city parks in the country. It covers – the old garden, declared to be a cultural heritage site, a children&#x27;s area, lakes, terraced rock gardens and a sports area.

The park hosts also one on the town museums, with a separate room for temporary and visiting exhibitions.

<doc id="298124" wikidata="Q334086" url="?curid=298124" title="Lin Yutang">
<text>Lin Yutang (10 October 1895 – 26 March 1976) was a Chinese inventor, linguist, novelist, philosopher, and translator. One scholar commented that Lin&#x27;s &quot;particular blend of sophistication and casualness found a wide audience, and he became a major humorous and critical presence&quot;, and he made compilations and translations of the Chinese classics into English. His &quot;My Country and My People&quot; (1935) reached the top of the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list. Some of his writings criticized the racism and imperialism of the West.

==Early life==
Lin was born in 1895 in the town of Banzai, Fujian. His father was a Christian minister. His journey of faith from Christianity to Taoism and Buddhism, and back to Christianity in his later life was recorded in his book &quot;From Pagan to Christian&quot; (1959).

==Academia==
Lin studied for his bachelor&#x27;s degree at St. John&#x27;s University, a Christian university in Shanghai. Then he received a half-scholarship to continue study for a doctoral degree at Harvard University. He later wrote that in the Widener Library he first found himself and first came alive, but he never saw a Harvard–Yale game.

In financial difficulty, he left Harvard early and moved to work with the Chinese Labour Corps in France and eventually to Germany, where he completed his requirements for a doctoral degree in Chinese philology at the University of Leipzig. From 1923 to 1926, he taught English literature at Peking University.

Enthusiastic about the success of the Northern Expedition, he briefly served in the new Nationalist government, but soon turned to teaching and writing. He found himself in the wake of the New Culture Movement which criticized certain ancient traditions as feudal and harmful. Instead of accepting this charge, Lin immersed himself in the Confucian texts and literary culture which his Christian upbringing and English language education had denied him.

His humor magazine &quot;The Analects Fortnightly&quot; (&quot;Lunyu Banyuekan&quot;, 1932–1940, 1945–1949) featured essays by writers such as Hu Shih, Lao She, Lu Xun, and Zhou Zuoren. He was one of the figures who introduced the Western concept of humor. In 1924, the term &quot;youmo&quot; () was invented, a phono-semantic match with the English word &quot;humor.&quot; Lin used the &quot;Analects&quot; to promote his conception of humor as the expression of a tolerant, cosmopolitan, understanding and civilized philosophy of life.

In 1933, Lu Xun attacked the &quot;Analects&quot; for being apolitical and dismissed Lin&#x27;s &#x27;small essays&#x27; () as &quot;bric a brac for the bourgeoisie&quot;. Lu Xun nevertheless continued to write for the magazine.

Lin&#x27;s writings in Chinese were critical of the Nationalist government to the point that he feared for his life. Many of his essays from this time were later collected in &quot;With Love and Irony&quot; (1940). In 1933, he met Pearl Buck in Shanghai, who introduced him and his writings to her publisher and future husband, Richard Walsh, head of the John Day Company.

Lin&#x27;s relation with Christianity changed over the years. His father was a second-generation Christian, but at Tsinghua, Lin asked himself what it meant to be a Christian in China. Being a Christian meant acceptance of Western science and progress, but Lin became angry that being a Christian also meant losing touch with China&#x27;s culture and his own personal identity.

On his return from study abroad, Lin renewed his respect for his father, yet he plunged into study of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism and did not identify himself as Christian until the late 1950s.

==Career outside China==

After 1935, Lin lived mainly in the United States, where he was a writer of Chinese philosophy and way of life. Lin wrote &quot;My Country and My People&quot; () (1935) and &quot;The Importance of Living&quot; () (1937) in English. Others include &quot;Between Tears and Laughter&quot; () (1943), &quot;The Importance of Understanding&quot; (1960, a book of translated Chinese literary passages and short pieces), &quot;The Chinese Theory of Art&quot; (1967). The novels &quot;Moment in Peking&quot; (1939), &quot;A Leaf in the Storm&quot; (1940), and &quot;The Vermilion Gate&quot; () (1953) described China in turmoil while &quot;Chinatown Family&quot; (1948) presented the lives of Chinese Americans in New York. Partly to avoid controversial contemporary issues, Lin in 1947 published &quot;The Gay Genius: The Life and Times of Su Tungpo&quot;, which presented the struggle between two Song dynasty figures, Su Shi and Wang Anshi, as parallel to the struggle between Chinese liberals and totalitarian communists.

Lin&#x27;s political writings in English sold fewer copies than his cultural works and were more controversial. &quot;Between Tears and Laughter&quot; (1943) broke with the genial tone of his earlier English writings to criticize Western racism and imperialism, going against the advice of his Western patrons and publisher. He vehemently criticised Churchill for refusing to extend the right to self-determination to Britain&#x27;s colonies under the Atlantic Charter and also quipped that &#x27;all you need to do to make an Englishman a gentleman again is to ship him back west of the Suez Canal&#x27;.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Lin traveled in China and wrote favorably of the war effort and Chiang Kai-shek in &quot;Vigil of a Nation&quot; (1944). American China Hands such as Edgar Snow criticized the works.

Lin was interested in mechanics. Since Chinese is a character-based rather than an alphabet-based language, with many thousands of separate characters, it was difficult to employ modern printing technologies. However, Lin worked on this problem for decades using a workable Chinese typewriter, brought to market in the middle of the war with Japan.

The Ming Kwai (&#x27;clear and quick&#x27;) Chinese typewriter played a pivotal role in the Cold War machine translation research.

From 1954 to 1955, Lin served briefly and unhappily as president of Nanyang University, which was newly established in Singapore by Chinese business interests to provide tertiary education in Chinese studies in parallel with the English-medium University of Singapore. However, according to CIA agent, Joseph B. Smith, Lin clashed with founder Tan Lark Sye and the board of trustees on the direction of the new university. Smith quoted Lin as saying &quot;They want to indoctrinate the students not only with a love of China.&quot;

The faculty rejected Lin&#x27;s plans to demolish and rebuild the new school building (which though grand, was not &quot;Western&quot; enough), his demands to have sole control over finances, and a budget clearly beyond its means. Lin accepted a dismissal fee of $305,203, entirely contributed by Tan Lark Sye, to prevent depleting the university&#x27;s funds.

After he returned to New York in the late 1950s, Lin renewed his interest in Christianity. His wife was a devout believer, and Lin admired her serenity and humility. After attending services with her at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church for several months, he joined the church and announced his return to the faith.

Lin presided over the compilation of a Chinese-English dictionary, &quot;Lin Yutang&#x27;s Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage&quot; (1972), which contains an English index to definitions of Chinese terms. The work was undertaken at the newly founded Chinese University of Hong Kong.

He continued his work until his death in 1976. Lin was buried at his home in Yangmingshan, Taipei. His home has been turned into a museum, which is operated by Taipei-based Soochow University. The town of Lin&#x27;s birth, Banzai, has also preserved the original Lin home and turned it into a museum.

==Legacy==

Although his major books have remained in print, Lin was a thinker whose place in modern Chinese intellectual history has been overlooked. Lin themed conventions have been organized in Taiwan and Lin&#x27;s native Fujian, and in December 2011, the International Conference on the Cross-cultural Legacy of Lin Yutang in China and America was held at City University of Hong Kong, with professional and private scholars from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, the United States, Germany and Slovakia. The organizer of the conference was Dr. Qian Suoqiao, author of the book, &quot;Liberal Cosmopolitan: Lin Yutang and Middling Chinese Modernity&quot; (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2010).

The first full-length academic study of Lin in English is Diran John Sohigian&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Times of Lin Yutang&quot; (Columbia University Ph.D. diss., 1991). Jing Tsu, &quot;Sound and Script in Chinese Diaspora&quot; (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2010) and Thomas S. Mullaney, &quot;The Chinese Typewriter: A History&quot; (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2017)
give a detailed accounts of Lin Yutang in the context of late 19th century script reform, Chinese national language reform in the early twentieth century and machine translation research during the Cold War.

==Family==
His wife, Lin Tsuifeng (née Liao)(), was an author, who, along with her daughter Lin Hsiang Ju, wrote three cook books which popularized Chinese cuisine in the English speaking world. Lin wrote introductions.

His first daughter Adet Lin (1923–1971) was a Chinese-American author who used the pseudonym Tan Yun. Adet Lin later committed suicide by hanging herself.

His second daughter Lin Tai-yi (1926–2003) was also known as Anor Lin in her earliest writing and had the Chinese name Yu-ju (). She was an author and the editor-in-chief of Chinese edition of the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; from 1965 until her retirement in 1988. She also wrote a biography of her father in Chinese ().
His third daughter Lin Hsiang-ju (林相如; born 1930), was referred to as Meimei in childhood. She graduated with a Doctor of Science (DSc) in Biochemistry from Harvard University and later co-authored Chinese cookbooks with her Mother including &quot;Chinese Gastronomy&quot; for which her father wrote the foreword. Working as a biochemist, she became the Department Head of Pathology at the University of Hong Kong(HKU) and later as a medical researcher at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.

<doc id="298129" wikidata="Q1140040" url="?curid=298129" title="Little Rock Central High School">
<text>Little Rock Central High School (LRCH) is an accredited comprehensive public high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States. The school was the site of the Little Rock Crisis in 1957 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation by race in public schools was unconstitutional three years earlier. This was during the period of heightened activism in the civil rights movement.

Central is located at the intersection of Little Rock Nine Way (a section of Park Street, designated in September 2022) and Daisy L. Gatson Bates Drive (formerly 14th Street). Bates was an African-American journalist and state NAACP president who played a key role in bringing about, through the 1957 crisis, the integration of the school.

Central can trace its origins to 1869 when the Sherman School operated in a wooden structure at 8th and Sherman streets; it graduated its first class on June 13, 1873. In 1885 the Sherman School was moved to 14th and Scott streets and was named Scott Street School, but was more commonly called &quot;City High School.&quot; Five years later in 1890, the Peabody School was constructed at West Capitol and Gaines streets. It was named in honor of philanthropist George Peabody from US$200,000 received via the Peabody Education Fund. In 1905, the city founded Little Rock High School at the intersection of 14th and Cumberland streets, and shuttered the Peabody and Scott Street schools to serve as the city&#x27;s sole public high school. Until 1957, only white students were permitted to be enrolled.

In 1927 at a cost of US$1.5 million, the city completed construction on the nation&#x27;s largest and most expensive high school facility, which remains in use today. In 1953 with the construction of Hall High School, the school was renamed as Little Rock Central High School. It has since been listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and named as a U.S. National Historic Landmark and National Historic Site.

Central High School, which covers grades 9 through 12, had an enrollment of 2,476 in school year 2020–2021. It is in the Little Rock School District, and serves sections of Little Rock and the entirety of Cammack Village. Nancy Rousseau was appointed principal in 2002, and retained that position .

==History==
===Early campus history===
Built in 1927 at a cost of $1.5 million, Little Rock Senior High School was designed in the Gothic Revival style; it was hailed as the most expensive, most beautiful, and largest high school in the nation. Statues of four figures over the front entrance represent ambition, personality, opportunity, and preparation. Its opening earned national publicity, with nearly 20,000 people attending the dedication ceremony. In 1953 it was renamed as Little Rock Central High School.

At the time in Arkansas and other states across the South, public school educational facilities were legally racially segregated. In 1954 the US Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that such segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, and encouraged the states to integrate their schools. Related historic events in the 1950s changed education at Central High School and throughout the United States.

===Little Rock integration===

LRCHS was the focal point of the Little Rock Integration Crisis of 1957. Nine Black students, known as the Little Rock Nine, were denied entrance to the school in defiance of the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling ordering integration of public schools. This provoked a showdown between the Democrat Governor Orval Faubus and Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower that gained international attention.

On the morning of September 23, 1957, the nine Black high school students faced an angry mob of over 1,000 Whites in front of Central High School who were protesting the integration project. As the students were escorted inside by the Little Rock police, violence escalated, and they were removed from the school. The next day, Eisenhower ordered the 1,200-man 327th Airborne Battle Group of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to escort the nine students into the school. By the same order, he federalized the entire 10,000-man Arkansas National Guard, in order to remove them from the control of Governor Faubus. At nearby Camp Robinson, a hastily organized Task Force 153rd Infantry drew guardsmen from units all over the state. Most of the Arkansas Guard was quickly demobilized, but the ad hoc Task Force 153rd Infantry assumed control at Thanksgiving when the 327th withdrew, and patrolled inside and outside the school for the remainder of the school year. As Melba Pattillo Beals, one of the nine students, wrote in her diary, &quot;After three full days inside Central [High School], I know that integration is a much bigger word than I thought.&quot;

This event, watched by the nation and world, was the site of the first important test for the implementation of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision of 1954. Many areas of the South pledged to resist this ruling. Arkansas&#x27; governor Orval Faubus questioned the authority of the federal court system and the validity of desegregation. The crisis at Little Rock&#x27;s Central High School was the first fundamental test of the national resolve to enforce black civil rights in the face of massive resistance during the years following the Brown decision. As to whether Eisenhower&#x27;s specific actions to enforce integration violated the Posse Comitatus Act, the Supreme Court, in &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot; (1958), indirectly affirmed the legality of his conduct. It was never expressly reviewed.

In 1958, federal Judge Jesse Smith Henley of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, stating that integration had &quot;broken down under the pressure of public opinion,&quot; suspended operation of the federal integration order until the 1960-61 school term. The school board said that it had faced large fees and could not afford to hire security guards to keep the peace in school.

LRCHS was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 19, 1977, and was designated as a National Historic Landmark on May 20, 1982. The school continues to be used as an educational facility.

In 2007, Central High School held an event for the 50th Anniversary of the Little Rock Nine entering Central. On September 24, 2007, a new museum was opened honoring the Little Rock Nine. That same year, HBO produced a documentary film directed by the Renaud Brothers, &quot;Little Rock Central: 50 Years Later,&quot; which explored the significant changes and continuities within the school since its desegregation.

===Teaching evolution===
Little Rock Central High School made legal history again in 1968, in a case based on the teaching of evolution in the public schools. LRCHS biology teacher Susan Epperson agreed to be the plaintiff in a case challenging an Arkansas law forbidding the teaching of the theory of evolution by natural selection in the public schools. The United States Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Epperson v. Arkansas&quot; held that states could not require that &quot;teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma,&quot; i.e., the teaching of evolution in schools could not be forbidden on religious grounds.

==After integration==
Today, the high school is minority-majority, with a minority enrollment of 67.7%. The racial breakdown of the school in 2021 was 52.7% Black, 32.3% White, 8.1% Asian, 5.5% Hispanic, and 0.9% two or more races.

It is issued in the form of a quarterly mini-magazine that keeps students updated on issues around the school. The newspaper has won many Arkansas Scholastic Press Association awards.

==Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site==
On November 6, 1998, Congress established Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site. The National Historic Site is administered in partnership with the National Park Service, Little Rock Public Schools, the City of Little Rock, and others.

The visitor center for the site is located diagonally across the street from the school and across from the memorial dedicated by Michael Warrick, and opened in fall 2006. It contains a captioned interpretive film on the Little Rock integration crisis, as well as multimedia exhibits on both that and the larger context of desegregation during the 20th century and the Civil Rights Movement.

Opposite the visitor center to the west is the Central High Commemorative Garden, which features nine trees and benches that honor the students. Arches that represent the school&#x27;s facade contain embedded photographs of the school in years since the crisis, and showcase students of various backgrounds in activities together.

Opposite the visitor center to the south is a historic Mobil gas station, which has been preserved in its appearance at the time of the crisis. At the time, it served as the area for the press and radio and television reporters. It later served as a temporary visitor center before the new one was built.

<doc id="298148" wikidata="Q1187364" url="?curid=298148" title="Generalized System of Preferences">
<text>The Generalized System of Preferences, or GSP, is a preferential tariff system which provides tariff reduction on various products. The concept of GSP is very different from the concept of &quot;most favored nation&quot; (MFN). MFN status provides equal treatment in the case of tariff being imposed by a nation but in case of GSP differential tariff could be imposed by a nation on various countries depending upon factors such as whether it is a developed country or a developing country. Both the rules comes under the purview of WTO.

GSP provides tariff reduction for least developed countries but MFN is only for not discriminating among WTO members.

==History==

The idea of tariff preferences for developing countries was the subject of considerable discussion within the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in the 1960s. Among other concerns, developing countries claimed that MFN was creating a disincentive for richer countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and other trade restrictions with enough speed to benefit developing countries.

In 1971, the GATT followed the lead of UNCTAD and enacted two waivers to the MFN that permitted tariff preferences to be granted to developing country goods. Both these waivers were limited in time to ten years. In 1979, the GATT established a permanent exemption to the MFN obligation by way of the enabling clause. This exemption allowed contracting parties to the GATT (the equivalent of today&#x27;s WTO members) to establish systems of trade preferences for other countries, with the caveat that these systems had to be &quot;generalized, non-discriminatory and non-reciprocal&#x27; with respect to the countries they benefited (so-called &quot;beneficiary&quot; countries). Countries were not supposed to set up GSP programs that benefited just a few of their &quot;friends.&#x27;

==Effects==

From the perspective of developing countries as a group, GSP programs have been a mixed success. On one hand, most rich countries have complied with the obligation to generalize their programs by offering benefits to a large swath of beneficiaries, generally including nearly every non-OECD member state. Certainly, every GSP program imposes some restrictions. The United States, for instance, has excluded countries from GSP coverage for reasons such as being communist (Vietnam), being placed on the U.S. State Department&#x27;s list of countries that support terrorism (Libya), and failing to respect U.S. intellectual property laws.

Criticism has been leveled noting that most GSP programs are not completely generalized with respect to products, and this is by design. That is, they don&#x27;t cover products of greatest export interest to low-income developing countries lacking natural resources. In the United States and many other rich countries, domestic producers of &quot;simple&quot; manufactured goods, such as textiles, leather goods, ceramics, glass and steel, have long claimed that they could not compete with large quantities of imports. Thus, such products have been categorically excluded from GSP coverage under the U.S. and many other GSP programs. Critics assert that these excluded products are precisely the kinds of manufactures that most developing countries are able to export, the argument being that developing countries may not be able to efficiently produce things like locomotives or telecommunications satellites, but they can make shirts.

Supporters note that even in the face of its limitations, it would not be accurate to conclude that GSP has failed to benefit developing countries, though some concede GSP has benefited developing countries unevenly. Some assert that, for most of its history, GSP has benefited &quot;richer developing&quot; countries - in early years Mexico, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, more recently Brazil and India - while providing virtually no assistance to the world&#x27;s least developed countries, such as Haiti, Nepal, and most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S., however, has closed some of these gaps through supplemental preference programs like the African Growth and Opportunity Act and a newer program for Haiti and Europe has done the same with Everything But Arms.

<doc id="298152" wikidata="Q1024734" url="?curid=298152" title="Surfers Paradise, Queensland">
<text>Surfers Paradise (or Surfers colloquially) is a town and the suburban capital of the City of Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. In the , the suburb of Surfers Paradise had a population of 26,412 people.

Colloquially known as &quot;Surfers&quot;, the suburb has many high-rise apartment buildings and a wide surf beach. The feature of the heart of the suburb is Cavill Mall, which runs through the shopping and entertainment precinct. Cavill Avenue, named after Jim Cavill, an early hotel owner, is one of the busiest shopping strips in Queensland, and the centre of activity for night life. One of the features of the area is the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids designed to build goodwill with tourists.

Surfers Paradise is the Gold Coast&#x27;s entertainment and tourism centre and the suburb&#x27;s high-rise buildings are the best known feature of the city&#x27;s skyline.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Surfers Paradise was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;location&quot;.

== Geography ==

Surfers Point is bounded to the east by the Coral Sea of the Pacific Ocean. The entire coastline of Surfers Paradise is called Surfers Paradise Beach () and is a continuous sandy surf beach. The Esplanade is a road that runs along the coast in the north-east of the suburb.

It is bounded to the north-west by the Nerang River which then flows through the suburb to exit at the suburb&#x27;s most northerly boundary almost at the mouth of the river where it flows into the southern end of Moreton Bay. The south-west of the suburb is land on the western bank of the river and is bounded by Bundall Road.

The Gold Coast Highway passes through the suburb from north to south.

The course of the river has been modified extensively in the latter part of the 20th century to create permanent islands for residential development, some of which were natural features while others were on reclaimed land created by a system of canals.

Macintosh Island is an island, substantially redeveloped to create a canal residential estate (). It was named after Hugh Macintosh, a draftsman in the Queensland Lands Department, who was heavily involved in the surveying of Gold Coast area. It is connected to the mainland by the Gold Coast Highway, which passes through the eastern part of the island from north (Main Beach) to south (Surfers Paradise).

Chevron Island is a natural island which has been developed for residential use as a neighbourhood (). Thomas Drive is the main road on an east–west axis and which connects the island by two bridges to mainland Surfers Paradise to the east and to the suburb or Southport to the west. It has another bridge to the north to Cronin Island (), a smaller reclaimed island and residential neighbourhood which is only accessible by road via Chevron Island. Cronin Island is named after Jack Cronin, the first engineer employed by the Southport Town Council (now the Gold Coast City Council).

Budds Beach is a beach on the Nerang River on the mainland part of the suburb facing Macintosh Island, Chrevron Island and Cronin Island (). It was named after Alan Foster Budd who built a house there in the 1940s. Jarriparilla Cove is the body of water that lies between Budds Beach and Macintosh Island (). It is a traditional Aboriginal name.

Girung Island is a small undeveloped island () named using Yugambeh word for the flying foxes (fruit bats) which roost on the island.

Despite its name, the Isle of Capri is not an island but a canal residential neighbourhood () in the south-west of the suburb on the western side of the Nerang River. Also on the western side of the river and to the north of the Isle of Capri is Evandale Park () which is a park which contains the Gold Coast Council Chambers (administrative centre) and the council&#x27;s Home of the Arts cultural precinct.Northcliffe Beach is a section of the Surfers Paradise Beach () in the area of Northcliffe Terrace, a name that refers to a 1920s real estate development between Enderley Avenue and Fern Street.

== History ==

James Beattie, a farmer, became the first European to settle in the area when he staked out an farm on the northern bank of the Nerang River, close to present-day Cavill Avenue. The farm proved unsuccessful and was sold in 1877 to German immigrant Johan Meyer, who turned the land into a sugar farm and mill. Meyer also had little luck growing in the sandy soil and within a decade had auctioned the farm to focus on providing access to tourists wanting to visit the surf beach. From 1880 to 1928, Meyer&#x27;s Ferry operated across the Nerang River transporting passengers and vehicles. He operated a horse-and-buggy service from the Southport railway station to the beach. He built the Main Beach Hotel. By 1889, Meyer&#x27;s hotel had become a post receiving office and subdivisions surrounding it were called Elston, named by the Southport postmaster after his wife&#x27;s home in Southport, Lancashire, England. The Main Beach Hotel licence lapsed after Meyer&#x27;s death in 1901 and for 16 years Elston was a tourist town without a hotel or post office.

In 1917, a land auction was held by Brisbane real estate company Arthur Blackwood to sell subdivided blocks in Elston as the &quot;Surfers&#x27; Paradise Estate&quot;, but the auction failed because access was difficult. This was the first recorded reference to the name Surfers Paradise.

Elston began to get more visitors after the opening of Jubilee Bridge and the extension of the South Coast Road in 1925. Elston was no longer cut off by the river and speculators began buying land around Elston and further south at Burleigh Heads. Estates down the coast were promoted and hotels opened to accommodate tourists and investors.

In 1925, Brisbane hotelier Jim Cavill opened the Surfers Paradise Hotel located on what would later become the site of the Surfers Paradise Centre which incorporates the Surfers Paradise Beer Garden and Hard Rock Cafe. In opening the hotel and neighbouring zoo, Cavill created the first attraction in the suburb. Located between the ferry jetty and the white surf beach off the South Coast Road, it became popular and shops and services sprang up around it. In the following years Cavill pushed to have the name Elston changed to Surfers&#x27; Paradise. The suburb was officially renamed on 1 December 1933 after the local council felt the Surfers Paradise name was more marketable. In July 1936 Cavill&#x27;s timber hotel burnt to the ground and was rebuilt the following year.

In 1934, Surfers Paradise State School was first established on the north-east corner of Laycock Street and the Gold Coast Highway (now Gold Coast Boulevard), three blocks south of Cavill Avenue (). In 1976, the school relocated to its current site on the Isle of Capri.

In December 1938, tenders were called to construct a Methodist Church in Hamilton Avenue, just off the Pacific Highway, close to the beach. The church was to seat 140 people and was designed by architect W. J. E. Kerrison. It was anticipated that the church would open at Easter in 1939. However, tenders were called again in July 1939. In June 1940, church officials indicated that they still did not have sufficient funds to build the church. In September 1940, tenders were called again to build the church in Clifford Street. On Saturday 23 October 1940, the stump-capping ceremony was held. On Saturday 14 December 1940, the Surfers Paradise Methodist Church was opened by Reverend Wilfred Slater, the President of the Methodist Conference. In 1977, it was part of the amalgamation that created the Uniting Church in Australia and became known as Clifford Street Uniting Church. The church celebrated its 50th anniversary in December 1990. An amalgamation of the Uniting Church congregations on the Gold Coast resulted in the closure of the Clifford Street church, which was relocated to Emmanuel College in Carrara to serve as their chapel. It was officially reopened at the college on 7 July 1991.

In the late 40s Margot Kelly moved here and had the Hibiscus Room built. This was a fine-dining restaurant and entertainment venue that attracted an exclusive clientele. A development boom followed in the 1950s and 1960s. The first highrise in Surfers Paradise was erected in 1959 and was named the Kinkabool. The Kinkabool stood 10 stories high and remains to this day in Hanlan Street. Many tall apartment buildings were constructed in the decades that followed, including the iconic buildings included the Iluka, St Tropez and The Pink Poodle. The boom later saw strong Japanese investment in the 1980s.

Little remains of the early vegetation or natural features of the area and even the historical association of the beachfront development with the river is tenuous. The early subdivision pattern remains, although later reclamation of the islands in the Nerang River as housing estates (e.g. Chevron Island), and the bridges to those islands, have created a contrast reflected in subdivision and building form. Some early remnants survived such as Budds Beach — a low-scale open area on the river which even in the early history of the area was a centre for boating, fishing and swimming.
In the early 2010s, the annual Surfers Paradise Festival was held in March and April. It was a celebration of local music, food, fashion, film and art and is a key driver of the Gold Coast&#x27;s long-term cultural development. Across the four weekends of the festival, the Surfers Paradise precinct was transformed into a vibrant showcase of the Gold Coast&#x27;s emerging arts and cultural scene.The festival comprised an accessible mix of family events, exhibitions, live music, street markets and short film screenings.
By 2020, minor changes had occurred in extending the road along the beachfront since the early subdivision and The Esplanade road is now a focus of activity, with supporting shops and restaurants. The intensity of activity, centred on Cavill, Orchid and Elkhorn Avenues, is reflected in the density of development. Of all places on the Gold Coast the high-rise buildings in this area constitute a dominant and enduring image visible from as far south as Coolangatta and from the mountain resorts of the hinterland.

Gold Coast Mayor Bruce Small promoted the city in 1967 through the use of the bikini-clad meters maids.

The program was known for playing non-traditional and offbeat music from many genres that kids can appreciate, much of it rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll that was not originally created with kids in mind. From 1994 to 2006 the show was on WFMU, the New York/New Jersey area freeform station.

Based in Portland since 2004, Belinda and Hova continued to produce Greasy Kid Stuff remotely for a couple of years, running the show from their home and sending a live feed to WFMU&#x27;s Jersey City studios through the phone line. In 2006, they launched the Portland version of &quot;Greasy Kid Stuff&quot; on KNRK 94/7 Alternative Portland.

Three compilation CDs of &quot;Greasy Kid Stuff&quot; favorites have been issued on the Confidential Recordings record label, all with art by Musho Rodney Alan Greenblat.

They Might Be Giants featured a song on their podcast entitled &quot;Greasy Kid Stuff&quot; in honor of the radio show. . Caspar Babypants (aka Chris Ballew from PUSA) also wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Hova and Belinda&quot; for Greasy Kid Stuff.

<text>Pop Idol is a British music competition television series created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or &quot;pop idol&quot;) in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcast, one in 2001–2002 and a second in 2003. An immense success when it launched in 2001, Maggie Brown in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;the show became a seminal reality/entertainment format once on air that autumn&quot;. Series judge Simon Cowell became a major public figure in entertainment, and the show produced instant No. 1 chart hits, including for the first series winner Will Young, whose single &quot;Evergreen&quot; was the fastest-selling debut in UK chart history and the best-selling song of 2002. &quot;Pop Idol&quot; was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after Simon Cowell announced the launch of &quot;The X Factor&quot; in the UK in April 2004.

The show has become an international TV franchise since, spawning multiple &quot;Idol&quot; series worldwide. In the meantime, a legal dispute arose with the makers of &quot;Popstars&quot;, which eventually led to the word &quot;pop&quot; being excluded from the titles of all the spin-offs, such as &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, &quot;Arab Idol&quot;, &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, &quot;Indonesian Idol&quot;, &quot;Indian Idol,&quot; &quot;New Zealand Idol&quot;, &quot;Latin American Idol&quot;, &quot;Idol&quot; (Norway), &quot;Idol&quot; (Poland), &quot;Idol&quot; (Sweden), &quot;Singapore Idol&quot;, &quot;Idols&quot; (South Africa), &quot;Pakistan Idol&quot;, &quot;Bangladeshi Idol&quot; and (same name for the Portuguese and Brazilian series).

The show&#x27;s theme music was written by Gingell/Stone and Cathy Dennis.

==Format==
One of the UK&#x27;s top-earning TV format exports, &quot;Pop Idol&quot; made extensive use of premium-priced viewer interactivity, with viewers voting by telephone, mobile telephone texting (not used on series one), through the &quot;red button&quot; on digital television sets, or via the official website. The final of the first series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; in February 2002 received the highest-ever one-night vote for a UK TV show, making the show one of ITV&#x27;s most profitable. The sister show on ITV2, &quot;Pop Idol Extra&quot;, hosted by Kate Thornton also made extensive use of mobile phone text messages to raise additional revenue. The first &quot;Pop Idol&quot; received very high voting figures despite allowing only telephone and Internet voting and not making use of texting or the &quot;red button&quot;. However, the &#x27;voting&#x27; system was effectively meaningless, as any individual was permitted to make an unlimited number of votes, the winning contestant thus being merely the one with the most persistent supporters.

The Saturday night primetime show initially followed the audition process, as hopefuls sang before four judges (record producer and music executive Pete Waterman, music executive and music manager Simon Cowell, music promoter and music manager Nicki Chapman and Radio DJ and television personality Neil &quot;Dr&quot; Fox) at various locations around the UK. Besides the successful auditionees, the poorest &quot;singers&quot; were often aired due to their obvious lack of talent or presence. Poor singers often faced harsh criticisms from the judges, especially from Simon Cowell (whose controversial rantings also made him famous on &quot;American Idol&quot;). The judges&#x27; reactions to such performances often ranged from disgust to nearly open laughter; their style of judgement and attitude towards pop-star wannabes resulted in the controversial opinions of others about the show&#x27;s setup, including that of Take That manager Nigel Martin Smith.

The viewing public quickly fell in love with the format though, as viewing figures indicated. The judges&#x27; policy of speaking candidly would have to be sanitised in series 2, however, as it received condemnation from MPs.

Once the first round of auditions was completed, the series moved to the Criterion Theatre, where further auditions saw the judges decide on a group of 50. Unusually, this was the final point at which the judges had direct control over the contestants&#x27; fates, as the remainder of the results would be driven solely by viewer voting.

Stage 3 of the series took place in a conventional TV studio. The 50 contestants were split into five groups of ten, each of whom sang one song for the judges, accompanied only by a piano. Each judge offered their opinion, and at the end of the pre-recorded show phone lines opened for votes. Later the same evening a live show followed in which the voting results were revealed, the top two earning a place in the final ten. In series 2, a wildcard round (an innovation that originated on &quot;American Idol&quot;) was added, in which the judges selected ten rejected contestants and gave them a second chance. In this special edition, one contestant, Susanne Manning, was selected by the viewer vote, and one, Sam Nixon, was chosen by the judges. This meant that the next stage began with twelve contestants, rather than the ten in series 1.

For the final stage, the show moved to a more lavish TV set, where all remaining contestants sang on live television, accompanied by either a backing track or live band. Most editions had a theme, with contestants singing songs from a particular genre or artist (no original songs were performed at any stage in the competition). Again, the judges offered comments, but the results were decided by viewer voting. Again, a live results show was broadcast later in the evening, but this time the singer with the fewest votes was eliminated, the rest continuing to the following week until only the winner remained.

Exceptions to the usual format were limited. In series 1, Darius Danesh was promoted to the live shows when Rik Waller dropped out. Danesh was third in the results for the group where Waller had won his place. Also, the first two live shows of series 2 saw two contestants leave, in order to rebalance the numbers after the addition of the two extra performers from the wildcard show.

==Results and legacy==
The first series was won by Will Young, with Gareth Gates coming second. Michelle McManus won the second series. All of the top three contestants from series 1 had number-one singles in the UK. Young continues to be a recording artist. Gates initially had great success as a recording artist, releasing three studio albums and seven top 5 singles. He has since moved on to a successful career in musical theatre appearing as lead in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, as Marius in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, on tour and in the West End and as Claude in Hair. In 2013, he became a member of the supergroup 5th Story. Darius Danesh had two hit albums and appeared in the West End musicals &quot;Chicago&quot;, playing the role of Billy Flynn, and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, originating the role of Rhett Butler. He also appeared in the touring version of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; as Sky Masterson. Finalists Rosie Ribbons and Zoe Birkett have both scored chart hits, Birkett also moving on to a career in musical theatre whilst Jessica Garlick represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. Semi-finalist Sarah Whatmore had two chart hits, despite failing to be voted into the top 10. Series 2 contestants enjoyed significantly less chart success, which many believe damaged the credibility of the show and helped hasten its demise in its home country.

Immediately after the second series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, the same set was used to host &quot;World Idol&quot;, in which winners of various &quot;Idol&quot; series around the world, including original &quot;Pop Idol&quot; winner Will Young, &quot;American Idol&quot; winner Kelly Clarkson and &quot;Australian Idol&quot; winner Guy Sebastian, competed in a one-off competition, complete with a large judging panel featuring one judge from each country (Simon Cowell officially representing &quot;American Idol&quot;, with Pete Waterman the &quot;official&quot; UK judge). The surprise winner was Norway&#x27;s Kurt Nilsen, who proceeded to minor UK chart success. Cowell was strongly critical of &quot;World Idol&quot;, and it is highly unlikely to be staged again.

After the second series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, ITV put the show on indefinite hiatus when in April 2004 judge and music executive Simon Cowell announced the launch of his own show, &quot;The X Factor&quot;, which he and his record label (Syco) held the rights to. In September 2004, &quot;Pop Idol&quot; creator Simon Fuller filed a lawsuit against &quot;The X Factor&quot; producers claiming that the format was copied from his own show. The case was eventually settled out of court in November 2005, and as part of the settlement, Simon Fuller was made a joint partner in &quot;The X Factor&quot; show, and Simon Cowell was obliged to stay on as a judge on &quot;American Idol&quot; for a further five years.

ITV&#x27;s licence to produce &quot;Pop Idol&quot; has since expired, meaning that other channels could theoretically acquire the series. Despite rumours (see below), no broadcaster has since acquired the rights to the format in the UK.

Despite running for only two series, &quot;Pop Idol&quot;″s impact was immense and led 19 Entertainment and FremantleMedia to roll the format out globally; currently there are over 50 versions in 110 countries, including, notably, &quot;American Idol&quot;, on which Cowell was a judge until 2010, before launching &quot;The X Factor USA&quot; in 2011.

==Series 1 (2001–02)==

* 1 Had been eliminated in previous rounds, but reinstated following Rik Waller&#x27;s exit.

==Series 2 (2003)==
Following the completion of the series, the official &quot;Pop Idol&quot; companion book published percentages of votes for each contestant every week. In some circumstances, the book suggested that the bottom 2 or 3 contestants were not the same as announced by the show hosts. It is not known if the incorrect result was announced, or if the book merely made a typing error. However, the contestant deemed to have had the lowest percentage was always eliminated on that week, meaning the overall result of the show was not changed.

==Video games==
&quot;Pop Idol&quot; was released as a video game developed by Codemasters for the PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance it was also released for the PC on 30 October 2003. The player creates his/her own singer, then they must sing their way through the auditions, theatre stages, heats, and then the finals. The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses through the competition. With each stage of the finals, one or two players with the least public vote tally are eliminated. The gameplay mainly consists of lining up a moving symbol with a fixed object in the centre of the screen and pressing the corresponding symbol on the game&#x27;s controller. If the player presses it when the symbol is in the middle of the circle, their singer sings a good note. If he or she presses it when it is not in the circle, or mistimes their press, the singer sings a bad note.

==Related programmes==
The &quot;Idol&quot; format has been launched in dozens of nations worldwide, and there have been many imitations of the programme.

A &quot;World Idol&quot; international television special was held in December 2003, featuring national first series &quot;Idol&quot; contest winners competing against each other; viewers worldwide voted &quot;Norwegian Idol&#x27;s&quot; Kurt Nilsen &quot;World Idol&quot;.

The similar &quot;Popstars&quot; format preceded &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, and was succeeded in Britain by one series of &quot;&quot; and fifteen series of &quot;The X Factor&quot; as of 2018. After &quot;Popstars&quot; producers threatened legal action, a deal was struck that, among other clauses, does not allow the use of the word &quot;pop&quot; in the title of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; editions outside of the UK.

<text>Originating in ancient India, Vastu Shastra (, &quot;&quot; – literally &quot;science of architecture&quot;) is a traditional Hindu system of architecture based on ancient texts that describe principles of design, layout, measurements, ground preparation, space arrangement, and spatial geometry. The designs aim to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilising geometric patterns (yantra), symmetry, and directional alignments.

Vastu Shastra are the textual part of &quot;Vastu Vidya&quot; – the broader knowledge about architecture and design theories from ancient India. Vastu Vidya is a collection of ideas and concepts, with or without the support of layout diagrams, that are not rigid. Rather, these ideas and concepts are models for the organisation of space and form within a building or collection of buildings, based on their functions in relation to each other, their usage and the overall fabric of the Vastu. Ancient Vastu Shastra principles include those for the design of &quot;Mandir&quot; (Hindu temples) and the principles for the design and layout of houses, towns, cities, gardens, roads, water works, shops, and other public areas. The Pandit or Architects of Vastu Shastra are &quot;Sthapati&quot;, &quot;Sūtragrāhin(Sutradhar)&quot;, &quot;Vardhaki&quot;, and &quot;Takṣhaka&quot;.

In contemporary India, states Chakrabarti, consultants that include &quot;quacks, priests and astrologers&quot; fueled by greed are marketing pseudoscience and superstition in the name of Vastu-sastras. They have little knowledge of what the historic Vastu-sastra texts actually teach, and they frame it in terms of a &quot;religious tradition&quot;, rather than ground it in any &quot;architectural theory&quot; therein.

==Terminology==
The Sanskrit word &quot;vāstu&quot; means a dwelling or house with a corresponding plot of land. The vrddhi, &quot;vāstu&quot;, takes the meaning of &quot;the site or foundation of a house, site, ground, building or dwelling-place, habitation, homestead, house&quot;. The underlying root is &quot;vas&quot; &quot;to dwell, live, stay, reside&quot;. The term shastra may loosely be translated as &quot;doctrine, teaching&quot;.

&quot;Vāstu-Śastras&quot; (literally, science of dwelling) are ancient Sanskrit manuals of architecture. These contain Vastu-Vidya (literally, knowledge of dwelling).

==History==

Vastu, crafts and architecture are traditionally attributed to the divine Vishwakarma in the Hindu pantheon. Theories tracing links of the principles of composition in &quot;Vastu Shastra&quot; and the Indus Valley civilization have been made, but scholar Kapila Vatsyayan considers this speculation since the Indus Valley script remains undeciphered. According to Chakrabarti, Vastu Vidya is as old as the Vedic period and linked to the ritual architecture. According to Michael W. Meister, the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; contains verses with mystic cosmogony which provide a paradigm for cosmic planning, but they did not represent architecture nor a developed practice. The &quot;Arthashastra&quot; dated to 2nd century BCE and 3rd century CE, dedicates chapters to domestic architecture, forts and town planning. 

Vastu sastras are stated by some to have roots in pre-1st-century CE literature, but these views suffer from being a matter of interpretation. For example, the mathematical rules and steps for constructing Vedic yajna square for the sacrificial fire are in the &quot;Sulba-sutras&quot; dated to 4th-century BCE. However, these are ritual artifacts and they are not buildings or temples or broader objects of a lasting architecture. Varahamihira&#x27;s &quot;Brihat Samhita&quot; dated to about the sixth century CE is among the earliest known Indian texts with dedicated chapters with principles of architecture. For example, Chapter 53 of the &quot;Brihat Samhita&quot; is titled &quot;On architecture&quot;, and there and elsewhere it discusses elements of vastu sastra such as &quot;planning cities and buildings&quot; and &quot;house structures, orientation, storeys, building balconies&quot; along with other topics. According to Michael Meister, a scholar of Indian architecture, we must acknowledge that Varahamihira does mention his own sources on &quot;vastu&quot; as older texts and sages. However, these may be mythology and reflect the Indian tradition to credit mythical sages and deities.

==Description==

There exist many Vāstu-Śastras on the art of building houses, temples, towns and cities. Among early known example is the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; dated to 2nd century BCE and 3rd century CE, with chapters dedicated to domestic architecture, forts and town planning. By 6th century AD, Sanskrit texts for constructing palatial temples were in circulation in India. Vāstu-Śastras include chapters on home construction, town planning, and how efficient villages, towns and kingdoms integrated temples, water bodies and gardens within them to achieve harmony with nature. While it is unclear, states Barnett, as to whether these temple and town planning texts were theoretical studies and if or when they were properly implemented in practice, these texts suggest that town planning and Hindu temples were conceived as ideals of art and integral part of Hindu social and spiritual life. 

Six of the most studied, complete and referred to Indian texts on Vastu Vidya that have survived into the modern age, states Tillotson, are – the &quot;Mayamata&quot;, the &quot;Manasara&quot;, the &quot;Samarangana Sutradhara&quot;, the &quot;Rajavallabha&quot;, the &quot;Vishvakarmaprakasha&quot; and the &quot;Aparajitaprccha&quot;. Numerous other important texts contain sections or chapters on aspects of architecture and design.

The &quot;Silpa Prakasa&quot; of Odisha, authored by Ramachandra Bhattaraka Kaulachara sometime in ninth or tenth century CE, is another Vāstu Śastra. Silpa Prakasa describes the geometric principles in every aspect of the temple and symbolism such as 16 emotions of human beings carved as 16 types of female figures. These styles were perfected in Hindu temples prevalent in the eastern states of India. Other ancient texts found expand these architectural principles, suggesting that different parts of India developed, invented and added their own interpretations. For example, in &quot;Saurastra&quot; tradition of temple building found in western states of India, the feminine form, expressions and emotions are depicted in 32 types of &quot;Nataka-stri&quot; compared to 16 types described in &quot;Silpa Prakasa&quot;. Silpa Prakasa provides brief introduction to 12 types of Hindu temples. Other texts, such as &quot;Pancaratra Prasada Prasadhana&quot; compiled by Daniel Smith and Silpa Ratnakara compiled by Narmada Sankara provide a more extensive list of Hindu temple types.

Sanskrit texts for temple construction discovered in Rajasthan, in northwestern region of India, include Sutradhara Mandana&#x27;s &quot;Prasadamandana&quot; (literally, planning and building a temple) with chapters on town building. &quot;Manasara shilpa&quot; and &quot;Mayamata&quot;, texts of South Indian origin, estimated to be in circulation by 5th to 7th century AD, is a guidebook on South Indian Vastu design and construction. &quot;Isanasivagurudeva paddhati&quot; is another Sanskrit text from the 9th century describing the art of building in India in south and central India. In north India, &quot;Brihat-samhita&quot; by Varāhamihira is the widely cited ancient Sanskrit text from 6th century describing the design and construction of &quot;Nagara&quot; style of Hindu temples.

These &quot;Vāstu Śastras&quot;, often discuss and describe the principles of Hindu temple design, but do not limit themselves to the design of a Hindu temple. They describe the temple as a holistic part of its community, and lay out various principles and a diversity of alternate designs for home, village and city layout along with the temple, gardens, water bodies and nature.

==Mandala types and properties==

The central area in all mandala is the &quot;Brahmasthana&quot;. Mandala &quot;circle-circumference&quot; or &quot;completion&quot;, is a concentric diagram having spiritual and ritual significance in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The space occupied by it varies in different mandala – in &quot;Pitha&quot; (9) and &quot;Upapitha&quot; (25). 
it occupies one square module, in &quot;Mahaapitha&quot; (16), &quot;Ugrapitha&quot; (36) and &quot;Manduka&quot; (64), four square modules and in &quot;Sthandila&quot; (49) and &quot;Paramasaayika&quot; (81), nine square modules. The Pitha is an amplified Prithvimandala in which, according to some texts, the central space is occupied by earth. The Sthandila mandala is used in a concentric manner.

A site of any shape can be divided using the Pada Vinyasa. Sites are known by the number of squares. They range from 1x1 to 32x32 (1024) square sites. Examples of mandalas with the corresponding names of sites include:
* &quot;Sakala&quot; (1 square) corresponds to &quot;Eka-pada&quot; (single divided site)
* &quot;Pechaka&quot; (4 squares) corresponds to &quot;Dwi-pada&quot; (two divided site)
* &quot;Pitha&quot; (9 squares) corresponds to &quot;Tri-pada&quot; (three divided site)
* &quot;Mahaapitha&quot; (16 squares) corresponds to &quot;Chatush-pada&quot; (four divided site)
* &quot;Upapitha&quot; (25 squares) corresponds to &quot;Pancha-pada&quot; (five divided site)
* &quot;Ugrapitha&quot; (36 squares) corresponds to &quot;Shashtha-pada&quot; (six divided site)
* &quot;Sthandila&quot; (49 squares) corresponds to &quot;Sapta-pada&quot; (seven divided site)
* &quot;Manduka/ Chandita&quot; (64 square) corresponds to &quot;Ashta-pada&quot; (eight divided site)
* &quot;Paramasaayika&quot; (81 squares) corresponds to &quot;Nava-pada&quot; (nine divided site)
* &quot;Aasana&quot; (100 squares) corresponds to &quot;Dasa-pada&quot; (ten divided site)
* &quot;Bhadrmahasan&quot; (196 squares) corresponds to &quot;Chodah-pada&quot; (14 divided sites)

==Modern adaptations and usage==
Vāstu Śastra represents a body of ancient concepts and knowledge to many modern architects, a guideline but not a rigid code. The square-grid mandala is viewed as a model of organisation, not as a ground plan. The ancient Vāstu Śastra texts describe functional relations and adaptable alternate layouts for various rooms or buildings and utilities, but do not mandate a set compulsory architecture. Sachdev and Tillotson state that the mandala is a guideline, and employing the mandala concept of Vāstu Śastra does not mean every room or building has to be square. The basic theme is around core elements of central space, peripheral zones, direction with respect to sunlight, and relative functions of the spaces.

The pink city Jaipur in Rajasthan was master planned by architect Vidyadhar Bhattacharya (1693–1751) who was approached by Rajput king Jai Singh and was built by 1727 CE, in part around Vastu Shilpa Sastra principles. Similarly, modern-era projects such as the architect Charles Correa&#x27;s designed Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya in Ahmedabad, Vidhan Bhavan in Bhopal, and Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur adapt and apply concepts from the Vastu Shastra Vidya. In the design of Chandigarh city, Le Corbusier incorporated modern architecture theories with those of Vastu Shastra.

During the colonial rule period of India, town planning officials of the British Raj did not consider Vastu Vidya, but largely grafted Islamic Mughal era motifs and designs such as domes and arches onto Victorian-era style buildings without overall relationship layout. This movement, known as Indo-Saracenic architecture, is found in chaotically laid out, but externally grand structures in the form of currently used major railway stations, harbours, tax collection buildings, and other colonial offices in South Asia.

Vāstu Śastra Vidya was ignored, during colonial era construction, for several reasons. These texts were viewed by 19th and early 20th century architects as archaic, the literature was inaccessible being in an ancient language not spoken or read by the architects, and the ancient texts assumed space to be readily available. In contrast, public projects in the colonial era were forced into crowded spaces and local layout constraints, and the ancient Vastu sastra were viewed with prejudice as superstitious and rigid about a square grid or traditional materials of construction. Sachdev and Tillotson state that these prejudices were flawed, as a scholarly and complete reading of the Vāstu Śastra literature amply suggests the architect is free to adapt the ideas to new materials of construction, local layout constraints and into a non-square space. The design and completion of a new city of Jaipur in early 1700s based on Vāstu Śastra texts, well before any colonial era public projects, was one of many proofs. Other examples include modern public projects designed by Charles Correa such as Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur, and Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad. Vastu Shastra remedies have also been applied by Khushdeep Bansal in 1997 to the Parliament complex of India, when he contented that the library being built next to the building is responsible for political instability in the country.

German architect Klaus-Peter Gast states that the principles of Vāstu Śastras is witnessing a major revival and wide usage in the planning and design of individual homes, residential complexes, commercial and industrial campuses, and major public projects in India, along with the use of ancient iconography and mythological art work incorporated into the Vastu vidya architectures.

=== Vastu and superstition ===

The use of &quot;Vastu shastra&quot; and &quot;Vastu consultants&quot; in modern home and public projects is controversial. Some architects, particularly during India&#x27;s colonial era, considered it arcane and superstitious. Other architects state that critics have not read the texts and that most of the text is about flexible design guidelines for space, sunlight, flow and function.

Vastu Shastra is a pseudoscience, states Narendra Nayak – the head of Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations. In contemporary India, Vastu consultants &quot;promote superstition in the name of science&quot;. Astronomer Jayant Narlikar states that Vastu Shastra has rules about integrating architecture with its ambience but that the dictates of Vastu and alleged harm or benefits being marketed have &quot;no logical connection to environment&quot;. He gives examples of Vastu consultants claiming the need to align the house to magnetic axis for &quot;overall growth, peace and happiness, or that &quot;parallelogram-shaped sites can lead to quarrels in the family&quot;, states Narlikar. He says this is pseudoscience.

Vibhuti Chakrabarti, a scholar of Architecture and Sanskrit literature has critically translated historic Vastu literature, and states that in contemporary India, some are offering their services as Vastu consultants where they project it as a &quot;religious tradition&quot;, rather than an &quot;architectural methodology&quot; as taught in historic texts. He says that these consultants include &quot;quacks, priests and astrologers&quot; fuelled by greed and with little knowledge of what the historic Vastu-sastra texts teach. They are said to market false advice and superstition in the name of Vastu Vidya tradition, sometimes under the rubric of &quot;Vedic sciences&quot;.

==Sanskrit treatises on architecture==
Of the numerous Sanskrit treatises mentioned in ancient Indian literature, some have been translated in English. Many Agamas, Puranas and Hindu scriptures include chapters on architecture of temples, homes, villages, towns, fortifications, streets, shop layout, public wells, public bathing, public halls, gardens, river fronts among other things. In some cases, the manuscripts are partially lost, some are available only in Tibetan, Nepalese or South Indian languages, while in others original Sanskrit manuscripts are available in different parts of India. Some treatises, or books with chapters on Vaastu Shastra include:

<text>Historical Chinese anthems comprise a number of official and unofficial national anthems of China composed during the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China.

&quot;Chinese national anthem&quot; may refer to: 
* &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; of the People&#x27;s Republic of China
* &quot;National Anthem of the Republic of China&quot; of the Republic of China

== &quot;Tune of Li Zhongtang&quot; ==

&quot;Quasi-official&quot;

In 1896, for purposes of diplomatic missions to Western Europe and Russia, Li Hongzhang (Zhongtang being a term of respect for a vizier or prime minister) employed in political lyrics combined with classical Chinese music to create a song later known as the &quot;Tune of Li Zhongtang&quot; (李中堂樂).
==&quot;Praise the Dragon Flag&quot;==

&quot;Quasi-official&quot;

After the Department of the Army was established in 1906, &quot;Praise the Dragon Flag&quot; became the army song, and has been played at formal occasions overseas.

¹ 兆 usually means one trillion (1012), but it could mean one million (106), and should have that value here in the song for factual accuracy. See Chinese numerals for details.

== &quot;Cup of Solid Gold&quot; (1911–1912)==

&quot;Official&quot;

The &quot;Cup of Solid Gold&quot; became the official national anthem of the Qing Empire in less than a week when the Wuchang Uprising occurred in 1911. It lasted for about one year until the end of the empire and the establishment of the Republic of China. It is in classical Chinese.

== &quot;Song of Five Races Under One Union&quot;==

&quot;Provisional&quot;

After the establishment of the provisional government in Nanjing, the Ministry of Education under Cai Yuanpei asked the public for possible anthems (as well as coats of arms), and &quot;Song of Five Races under One Union&quot; (五旗共和歌), with lyrics by Shen Enfu (沈恩孚) and music by Shen Pengnian (沈彭年), was released as a draft in the newspaper.
== &quot;How Great is Our China!&quot; ==
&quot;Unofficial&quot;

Also called &quot;Patriotic Song&quot; (愛國歌), &quot;How Great is Our China!&quot; (泱泱哉，我中華！) has lyrics written by Liang Qichao and music by overseas Chinese at Datong School (大同學校), Yokohama. Released in 1912, it became quite popular, especially among students.
== &quot;Song to the Auspicious Cloud&quot; (1913–1928)==

&quot;Official&quot;

The &quot;Song to the Auspicious Cloud&quot; has two versions, one used in 1913 and another after 1920.

===First version ===
On April 8, 1913, this national anthem was used in the opening ceremony of the 1st Regular Council; the last line was added by Wang Baorong (汪寶榮), with other lines from &quot;Shang Shu&quot;; it was set to music by Jeans Hautstont.
===Second version ===
In November 1919, Duan Qirui established the National Anthem Research Committee (國歌研究會), which adopted:
* The lyrics (1920) by Zhang Taiyan (章太炎) from the classic &quot;The Song to the Auspicious Cloud&quot; (卿雲歌) from the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;.
* The music (1921) by Beijing professor, Xiao Youmei (蕭友梅).
The anthem was released in July 1921 by the Department of National Affairs (國務院).

¹糺 (&quot;jiū&quot; &quot;collaborate&quot;) is sometimes written as 糾 (&quot;jiū&quot; &quot;investigate&quot;) or 織 (&quot;zhī&quot; &quot;to web&quot;)

== &quot;China Heroically Stands in the Universe&quot; (1915–1921)==

&quot;Official&quot;

After general Yuan Shikai became head of state, the Ritual Regulations Office (禮制館) issued the new official anthem, &quot;China Heroically Stands in the Universe&quot; (中國雄立宇宙間) in June 1915. Its lyrics were written by Yin Chang (廕昌) and music by Wang Lu (王露).
== &quot;Song of the National Revolution&quot; ==
&quot;Provisional&quot;

Written by officers of the Whampoa Military Academy, the &quot;Revolution of the Citizens&quot; song (國民革命歌, &quot;Guomin Geming Ge&quot;), sung to the tune of &quot;&quot;Frère Jacques&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Two Tigers&quot; in China),&quot; was released on July 1, 1926.
== &quot;The Internationale&quot; ==
When the Chinese Soviet Republic was established in 1931, The Internationale in Chinese was decided to be its national anthem, since it followed the ideals of communism, especially the Soviet Union.

<text>William Robert Young (born 20 January 1979) is an English singer, songwriter, and actor. He came to prominence after winning the 2002 inaugural series of the ITV talent contest &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, making him the first winner of the worldwide &quot;Idol&quot; franchise. His double A-sided debut single &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot; / &quot;Evergreen&quot; was released two weeks after the show&#x27;s finale and became the fastest-selling debut single in the UK. Young also came in fifth place in &quot;World Idol&quot; performing the single &quot;Light My Fire&quot; written by the band the Doors.

As a teenager, Young studied politics at the University of Exeter before moving to London, where he studied musical theatre at the Arts Educational Schools in Chiswick. Young put his studies on hold in late 2001 to become a contestant on &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. After winning the competition the following year, he released his debut album &quot;From Now On&quot; (2002) which went straight to number one. &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot; (2003) followed and enjoyed greater success, eventually going platinum five times in the UK and spawning three top five singles on the UK singles chart. His following albums &quot;Keep On&quot; (2005), &quot;Let It Go&quot; (2008) and &quot;Echoes&quot; (2011) also went multi-platinum and &quot;85% Proof&quot; (2015) became his fourth UK number-one album on the UK Albums Chart. His albums have spawned many songs that have achieved top ten positions in the UK, four of which went to the number one spot. Young has also undertaken numerous concert tours, and has accumulated multiple honours, including two Brit Awards from 12 nominations, and the estimated worldwide sale of over eight million albums. Young&#x27;s net worth was estimated at £13.5 million in April 2012.

Alongside his music career, Young has acted in film, on stage and in television. For his performance in the 2013 London revival of the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;, he was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical. He has also participated in philanthropy and released books &quot;Anything is Possible&quot; (2002), &quot;On Camera, Off Duty&quot; (2004), his autobiography &quot;Funny Peculiar&quot; (2012), &quot;To be a Gay Man&quot; (2020), and &quot;The A–Z of Wellbeing&quot; (2022). In January 2022, he appeared in the third series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Lionfish&quot; and in May issued the compilation album &quot;20 Years: The Greatest Hits&quot;.

== Early life and education ==

Young was born on 20 January 1979 in Wokingham, Berkshire, and is the second-oldest child of Robin Young, a company director of an engineering firm, and Annabel Young (née Griffith), a plant nursery gardener. Born six weeks premature, he was ten minutes older than his twin brother, Rupert who died in July 2020. He also has an older sister Emma.

Young was born into an affluent, upper middle class family, whose paternal ancestry has strong ties to the British government and military services. His grandfather, Digby Aretas Young (d. 1966) was a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, and his great-great-great-great-grandfather was Colonel Sir Aretas William Young, who, in 1795 at seventeen years old, joined the British Army and served in Ireland and Egypt before fighting in the Peninsular War. Aretas was later stationed in Trinidad and eventually took charge of the Trinidadian government, before moving to Demerara where he was appointed Protector of Slaves. Aretas became the sixth Governor of Prince Edward Island in 1831, and three years later was knighted by King William IV. One of Aretas&#x27;s sons was Sir Henry Young, fifth Governor of South Australia, later first Governor of Tasmania.

Young was brought up in Hungerford, West Berkshire, and was initially educated at Kingsbury Hill School in Marlborough, Wiltshire, before attending Horris Hill Preparatory School, Newbury, between the ages of eight and thirteen. His first appearance on stage was at the age of four when he played a fir tree in a school production and had one line to speak. At Horris Hill, Young was head chorister in the school choir, and at the age of nine he learned how to play the piano. Young recalls that at Horris Hill, pupils were taught that they were more privileged than pupils from state schools, and that one day he wrote a letter stating, &quot;I must pass common entrance to take me to public school, otherwise I&#x27;ll be going to state school and everyone will be very disappointed.&quot; At thirteen, Young and his brother were enrolled as boarders at the public school Wellington College in Crowthorne, Berkshire. Young appeared in several school productions and often gave speeches in assembly, despite later admitting that he never felt completely comfortable being the centre of attention.

It was during this period that he became interested in sports and for a time he dreamed of competing in the Olympic Games in the 400-metre sprint, which he could run in under fifty seconds – the Olympic average is forty-three seconds. He became captain of the school&#x27;s basketball and athletics teams, and also represented the school in the triple jump, long jump, football and rugby. The only sport he says he felt uncomfortable playing was cricket.

Young left school with ten GCSEs, but achieved disappointing A-Level results and had to enrol in d&#x27;Overbroeck&#x27;s College, Oxford, to re-sit his exams. He took a part-time job as a waiter at the Grand Café in Oxford, and became interested in environmental issues and local campaigning, joining a group called the Eco Society. He passed his A-Levels the second time, earning As in Politics and Ancient History, and a B in English. In 1998 Young began studying politics at the University of Exeter, choosing the subject because, &quot;I thought I should know more about what was going on in my country.&quot; He also took women&#x27;s studies at university and considers himself a feminist. His interest in performing arts continued, and he joined a theatre group called Footlights where he eventually landed the lead role of Curly in their production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; &quot;I really enjoyed it and doing that gave me a lot of confidence&quot;, he later said of the show. He also took a work experience position at Sony Records to gain insight into the music industry. Other work included runway and photographic modelling, gardening, tearing labels off T-shirts in a clothing factory, and being a waiter. He graduated in 2001 with a 2:2 bachelor&#x27;s degree. After leaving university, Young knew that he wanted to be a professional singer, but wanted training and experience. In September 2001 he became a student at the Arts Educational Schools, in Chiswick, London.

== Career ==

=== 1999–2001: Early auditions ===

In 1999 during his second year at university, Young watched an episode of &quot;This Morning&quot; and learned that the show was holding a competition to find members for a new boy band. He mailed the producers an audition tape and received a letter back from the show telling him he had been selected as one of seventy-five competitors, and that he had to appear in London for an off-camera audition. The 75 auditionees were whittled down to 9 finalists including Young, who were then invited to perform on the show. On 29 May 1999, Young appeared on the programme and performed a short rendition of the Jackson 5 song, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, in front of a panel of judges that included Simon Cowell, an artists and repertoire executive at BMG, and Kate Thornton, a former editor of &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, turned television presenter. One week later, Young was selected into the boy band alongside three other competitors. They were Lee Ryan who later joined the boy band Blue, Declan Bennett who joined the boy band Point Break, signed to Danielle Barnett, the current lead singer of Urban Cookie Collective and Music Manager who contacted him directly following the This Morning audition, and Andy Scott-Lee who went on to compete in the second series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. Cowell said of the group, &quot;We&#x27;ve tried to find people with star quality and these guys can sing and dance&quot;, but the band failed to find any success and it soon dis-banded. Young&#x27;s next audition was at the Guildhall in London to be a jazz singer, but he accidentally arrived on the wrong date.

===2001–2002: &quot;Pop Idol&quot;===

On 20 June 2001, one of Young&#x27;s university classmates showed him an advertisement in the &quot;News of the World&quot; for auditionees of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, a planned nationwide televised talent show to find a solo pop artist in a similar way that &quot;Popstars&quot; had created the pop band Hear&#x27;Say the previous year. The winner was guaranteed a £1 million recording contract with BMG and representation by 19 Management. He printed out an application form from the website, filled it out and posted it on 28 June. On 7 August 2001, he received a reply which told him he had been accepted for an audition at ExCeL London on 5 September 2001. On the day of the audition, Young performed Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Until You Come Back to Me (That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Gonna Do)&quot; in front of an assistant producer, and was deemed good enough to be given a second audition two days later. For his second audition, Young sang &quot;Blame It on the Boogie&quot; by the Jacksons in front of a show producer and won a place to the third round to perform before the show&#x27;s judges: Simon Cowell; Nicki Chapman, a &quot;Popstars&quot; judge who also worked as a publicist at 19 Entertainment, the company that was producing &quot;Pop Idol&quot;; Pete Waterman, a music producer who had written or produced twenty-one singles that had charted at Number One in the UK Singles Chart, 200 Top Tens, and sold over 500 million records for the artists such as Kylie Minogue, Rick Astley, Bananarama, Steps and Westlife; and Neil &quot;Dr Fox&quot; Fox, a disc jockey who presented the drivetime show on Capital FM and the nationally syndicated Pepsi Chart. He was the final contestant the judges saw, and after a day of watching mostly poor performances they were not in the best spirits. Again, Young performed &quot;Blame It on the Boogie&quot;, but the judges thought his overall performance was merely average. Chapman told him that his dance moves had let him down, but his vocal was good. Fox described him as cheesy, Waterman was unimpressed by his stage presence and image – Young was wearing baggy and faded jeans, scuffed shoes and his grandfather&#x27;s jumper which was stained with egg yolk – but conceded that his voice was &quot;nice&quot;. Despite their uncertainty, however, they advanced him through to the next round. The following week, auditions were held at the Criterion Theatre, and Young sang &quot;All or Nothing&quot; by O-Town, the Drifters&#x27; &quot;Up on the Roof&quot; and &quot;Fast Love&quot; by George Michael. Still not completely convinced by his performances, he was made to wait in the &quot;Maybe&quot; room until the judges decided to send him through to the Final 50.

The first episode of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; was broadcast on 6 October 2001 on ITV, and Young&#x27;s audition aired on the third show on 20 October 2001. The next round of the competition was split into five heats that aired every Saturday between 3 November 2001 and 8 December 2001. Each show featured ten of the fifty competitors singing one song in the &quot;Pop Idol&quot; studios in front of the judges and an audience, but unlike previous rounds, the viewing public decided who would advance to the next round by interactive televoting voting using their telephones, the Red Button on digital television remote controls, and the &quot;Pop Idol&quot; website. The two singers with the highest number of votes in each heat advanced to the final rounds of the competition. Young competed in Heat 4, broadcast on 24 November, and sang a jazz/lounge interpretation of &quot;Light My Fire&quot; by the Doors. Judges Chapman, Fox and Waterman were all enthusiastic about his performance, but Cowell was unimpressed and called it &quot;distinctly average&quot;, adding, &quot;I just thought it was totally normal. In the context of the show I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was good enough.&quot; The other judges and contestants all expressed shock at his comments, and Young responded, telling Cowell that while he was entitled to his opinion, it was wrong.

This incident has often been cited as the moment when Young&#x27;s pop career truly began, standing out to viewers and endeared himself to them. It appeared that the voting audience agreed with Young and disagreed with Cowell, because he was voted through to the next round, in first place, with 41.5% of the overall vote. During Young&#x27;s next appearance on the show on 15 December 2001, Cowell stated that he had previously made a &quot;huge mistake&quot;, and that Young had conducted himself with a dignity that had humbled him. Young later stated that his proudest moment of the entire competition was this incident.

Young easily progressed through each subsequent round by performing jazz, lounge and soul versions of songs such as &quot;Wives and Lovers&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;. In the first four weeks of the Live Finals, he received the highest percentage of votes. In weeks five, six and seven, he received the second highest percentage of votes, losing out on first place to Gareth Gates each time. In the Semi-final, competing against Gates and Darius Danesh, Young again received the most votes (39.8%). Gates received 39.3% of the votes and won the other place in the Grand Final, while Danesh received 20.9% of the votes and was eliminated from the competition.

Throughout the following week, Young and Gates embarked on separate whistle-stop tours of the United Kingdom in large tour buses adorned with their faces, in an attempt to canvass for votes. In election-style campaigns, they made numerous radio and television appearances, were interviewed in magazines, national and local newspapers, and met and performed for their fans. Celebrities such as Noel Gallagher, Robbie Williams, Posh and Becks, Kylie Minogue, Myleene Klass, Michelle Collins, S Club 7 and Jenny Frost announced their support for Young, while Gates was backed by Duncan James, Natasha Hamilton, Richard and Judy, Westlife, Faye Tozer, Denise Van Outen, Ben Adams, Neil Tennant, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Claire Richards, Boy George, Ricky Gervais and Francis Rossi. The media pitted Young and Gates against each other, publishing false news articles claiming that the two contestants were bitter rivals and their parents were bickering and fighting backstage, stories which both camps denied. Although for a brief moment earlier in the series Young was favoured to win, bookmakers gave Gates better odds on the eve of the Grand Final, pointing to his angelic voice, good looks and displays of emotion that appealed to a younger audience, compared with Young&#x27;s soulful crooning and maturity appealing to housewives and intellectuals. Gates was given various odds of 1/5, 2/9 and 2/7, while Young&#x27;s odds were quoted at 100/30, 11/4, 3/1 and 5/2 at different times in the week.

On 9 February 2002, 13.34 million viewers watched Young and Gates battle each other in the Grand Final for the title of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. Both acts sang &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot; and &quot;Evergreen&quot;, which were to be released as a double A-side single by the winner. Young also sang &quot;Light My Fire&quot; a second time as his favourite performance from the series. 8.7 million votes were registered over the two-and-a-half hours that the voting lines were open, which set a new world record. However, some voters complained that their votes had not been registered and that ITV, British Telecom and Telescope (the company responsible for operating the phone system) had not prepared well enough for the volume of calls because the system crashed at one point during the evening. It was also alleged that the phonelines had been fixed and they were involved in vote rigging. Nevertheless, Young was announced the winner of the competition after receiving 4.6 million (53.1%) votes, just 500,000 more than Gates. Young&#x27;s shock at hearing the news was obvious to viewers as his jaw dropped and he clasped his hands to his face. &quot;When he [Ant McPartlin] said what the votes were, I thought, &#x27;I am second, and I have lost by that much. Oh well, that&#x27;s not bad&#x27;,&quot; Young recalled. &quot;When I heard I&#x27;d won ... I felt like I&#x27;d been hit. I stepped backwards. I could not believe it.&quot; In 2011, Young described &quot;Pop Idol&quot; as &quot;a huge starting point and ... the best ever experience for me, ever.&quot;

==== &quot;Pop Idol&quot; performances and results ====
=== 2002–2003: &quot;From Now On&quot; ===
Young&#x27;s first single was a double A-side featuring Westlife&#x27;s song &quot;Evergreen&quot; and &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot;, a new song written for the winner of the show by Chris Braide and Cathy Dennis. In March 2002, this became the fastest-selling debut in UK chart history, selling 403,027 copies on its day of release (1,108,659 copies in its first week). It went on to sell over 1.7 million copies, and on the official list of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK issued later that year, it was ranked eleventh. In 2008, Official Charts Company released the Top 40 Biggest Selling Singles of the 21st century (so far) in which Young&#x27;s version of Evergreen topped the chart. On 31 December 2009, Radio 1 confirmed that &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot;/&quot;Evergreen&quot; was the biggest selling single of the 2000s decade in the United Kingdom. This was again confirmed on 7 May 2012 when Radio 1 played a countdown of the top-selling 150 songs of the millennium so far. &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot; won an Ivor Novello Award for Bestselling Song of 2002.

In October 2002, Young released his debut album, &quot;From Now On&quot;, which included &quot;Evergreen&quot;, nominated in the Best British Single category at the Brit Awards 2003, and &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot;. It produced three singles: &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; (a duet with Gareth Gates, released as a double A-side with Gates&#x27;s song &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;/&quot;You and I&quot; (released in aid of Children in Need). He won his first BRIT Award in February 2003 as Best British Breakthrough Act. Young sang &quot;Try Again&quot;, a song featured in Disney&#x27;s &quot;101 Dalmatians II: Patch&#x27;s London Adventure&quot;, the 2003 direct-to-video sequel to Walt Disney&#x27;s 1961 feature &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;.

=== 2003–2007: &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot; and &quot;Keep On&quot; ===

Young&#x27;s second album, &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot;, was released in December 2003. It features the singles &quot;Leave Right Now&quot;, nominated in the Best British single category of the past 25 years at the Brit Awards 2005 and winner of the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically in 2004, &quot;Your Game&quot; (which won Young his second Brit Award in 2005 for Best British Single of the Year) and &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot; In November 2005, Young released his third album, &quot;Keep On&quot;, which included the single &quot;All Time Love&quot;, nominated in the Best British Single category at the Brit Awards 2007. Other singles from the album were &quot;Switch It On&quot; and &quot;Who Am I&quot;.

In May 2006, he sang at the Prince&#x27;s Trust 30th Birthday, which took place at the Tower of London. From 12 September until 2 October 2006, Young toured the UK with his Keep On Live Tour, which included the songs taken from his album &quot;Keep On&quot; and a selection of past songs. The official merchandise range for the tour, highlighted by the press, included a &quot;tip and strip&quot; pen which, when turned over, reveals Young in his underpants. In October 2006, Young sang at Nitin Sawhney&#x27;s concert in the BBC Electric Proms series of concerts. He followed this by performing in South Africa for Nelson Mandela&#x27;s Unite of the Stars charity concerts.

In July 2007, he appeared at the Concert for Diana at the new Wembley Stadium. Young was the headline act at the Proms in the Park, which took place in Hyde Park in September 2007 as part of the Last Night of the Proms. In September 2007, Young performed at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club with the Vanguard Big Band. Young took part in the Little Noise Sessions, a series of intimate, acoustic gigs for the learning disability charity, Mencap. He performed in November 2007 with special guests at Islington&#x27;s Union Chapel.

=== 2008–2010: &quot;Let It Go&quot; and &quot;The Hits&quot; ===

On 29 September 2008, Young&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Let It Go&quot;, was released. It peaked at No.2 on the UK Albums Chart, having been preceded by the single &quot;Changes&quot;, which was released on 15 September and peaked at No.10 in the UK Singles Chart.

Young was told by someone at the record company to re-record his hit single &quot;Leave Right Now&quot; because he sounded too gay on the track. He didn&#x27;t realize this but he was made to re-record the song until the record executives were satisfied with it.

=== 2011–2016: &quot;Echoes&quot;, record label change and &quot;85% Proof&quot; ===
In early 2011, Young tweeted teaser clips of tracks from his new album, &quot;Echoes&quot;, which was subsequently released on 22 August 2011 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number one on 29 August 2011 making it Young&#x27;s first number one album since &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot; in 2003. The first single &quot;Jealousy&quot; premiered on BBC Radio 2, between 9.00am-12noon, Monday 11 July 2011. The single was released on 21 August 2011, preceding the album by 1 day with the single peaking at No.5. &quot;A Night with...Will Young&quot; was aired two days before the release of &quot;Echoes&quot; on ITV1 presented by Kate Thornton charting all of Young&#x27;s greatest hits plus performing a few new tracks from the album. Young appeared on the third episode of &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot; performing &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; from Echoes to further promote the album. Young undertook a 23 date Echoes Tour in the UK including 2 nights at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in Autumn 2011. The second single from Echoes was &quot;Come On&quot; released in November 2011, with the accompanying video featuring Young performing at a dog show. It was confirmed that Young would appear as one of the four judges on the first series of the singing competition series &quot;The Voice UK&quot; although on 12 December 2011 it was reported that Young had been replaced by Danny O&#x27;Donoghue at the last minute. He performed a special Christmas concert at the London Palladium in December as the final night of his 2011 performances. The following day it was announced that he would be undertaking summer shows as part of the Forestry Commission&#x27;s summer concert programme, also at Cornbury Festival. 2012 singles releases were &quot;Losing Myself&quot; and &quot;I Just Want a Lover&quot; with accompanying videos.

On &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, Young announced that he was recording his sixth studio album. On 25 March 2015, he announced on his Instagram account that the title of the new album will be &quot;85% Proof&quot;. It was released on 25 May.

=== 2019–2021: &quot;Lexicon&quot; and &quot;Crying on the Bathroom Floor&quot; ===

Young&#x27;s album &quot;Lexicon&quot; was released on 21 June. Young also released the lead single &quot;All the Songs&quot; from the album the same day and announced he would be embarking on a tour in October 2019 in support of the album. Young had stated in an interview he had no intentions of releasing any more records as he was focusing on acting and his podcast series, however after going into the studio with old friend and producer Richard X, the lead single was recorded and the album naturally followed. On 26 March 2021 Young announced the release of his eighth studio album &quot;Crying on the Bathroom Floor&quot;, which was released on 6 August 2021. Following the release, Young said: &quot;I loved the idea of creating an album that celebrates some of the modern female artists I so admire in pop. In today&#x27;s times it&#x27;s so much easier and accepted to occupy other genders, ideas and explore new avenues. I wanted to understand what it might be like to sing their lyrics. A song about a boy called Daniel; crying on the bathroom floor, feeling like Elizabeth Taylor. This is not a covers album as such, well certainly not in the standard way. I wanted to bring songs from female artists who I admire into a new arena. I wanted to work with Richard X again and create a true pop record.&quot; &quot;Daniel&quot;, the lead single taken from the album, was released on 26 April 2021, with the official video released on the same day. The second song to be lifted from the album was &quot;Elizabeth Taylor&quot;, a cover of a Clare Maguire track which was released on 28 May. The title track (a cover of the 2017 Muna single) was released on 8 July 2021.

===2021–present: 20th anniversary and &quot;Light It Up&quot;===

On 25 October 2021, Young announced the compilation &quot;20 Years: The Greatest Hits&quot; for release on 27 May 2022, marking 20 years since he won &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. The album included his greatest hits alongside two new tracks, &quot;Why Does It Hurt&quot; and &quot;Breaking Free&quot;. Young also announced the 20 Year Tour in support of the album in October 2022.

In January 2022 Young competed in the third series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Lionfish&quot;. He was unmasked in the third episode.

From 22 February 2023 to 11 March 2023, Young starred in the play &quot;Song from Far Away&quot;, which was staged at HOME in Manchester. Mark Fisher, reviewing the play for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, praised Young&#x27;s performance, writing that he &quot;act[ed] with melodic grace&quot;. In June 2023 Young performed, again on the Avalon Stage, at the Glastonbury Festival. Young confirmed in an interview with Sky News that he had begun work on his next studio album and that it would be released in 2024.

== Other ventures ==

=== Acting career ===
Young added acting to his repertoire when he accepted a role in the BBC film &quot;Mrs Henderson Presents&quot;, starring Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins, in which he played Bertie. The film was released in the UK in November 2005 to excellent reviews—not least for Young&#x27;s performance as both actor and singer in the film. The scene in which Young appears naked postdated his &quot;absolutely thrilled&quot; acceptance of the British male Rear of the Year Award 2005, an accolade to add to the Most Stylish Male Music Star, Best Bod, Sexiest Star, Best Dressed and Best Hair awards he had already won. Young was an executive producer for Ralph Fiennes&#x27; production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Coriolanus&quot; filmed in Serbia, and his documentary on the making of the film features on its DVD release. He was to have a small role in the film as a reporter on the conflict as well as being executive producer, but it was decided that his appearance was a &quot;distraction&quot; and it did not make the final cut of the film.

Young trod the boards in the Royal Exchange Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;The Vortex&quot; by Noël Coward. This production ran from January to March 2007 and Young played the leading role of Nicky Lancaster. Critics, including Nicholas de Jongh, were very positive. In 2012, he appeared in the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; in London, after a short nationwide tour. This marked his West End debut. He was awarded the What&#x27;s on Stage Award for London Newcomer of the Year. He was also nominated for the 2013 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical, but lost out to Michael Ball for Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street at the 2013 Laurence Olivier Awards.

Young also appeared in the 2010 &quot;Marple&quot; drama &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d from Side to Side&quot; and guest starred in a 2010 episode of &quot;Skins&quot;. In 2011, he starred in a new drama series on Sky Living called &quot;Bedlam&quot;, about supernatural happenings taking place at a disused asylum being converted into loft-style apartments. The £3 million six-part series began airing on 7 February 2011. It was distributed by BBC Worldwide. Young was a guest on &quot;Top Gear&quot; during season 12 episode 2 and set the fastest wet lap around the track in the Chevrolet Lacetti. On 31 October 2011, Young was also the guest host of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;.

In November 2004, Young presented a documentary entitled &quot;Runaways&quot; as part of the Children in Need campaign, highlighting the problems facing distressed teens who run away from home, and the plight they were in being picked up off the streets and railway stations by pimps who offered them work and drugs. The children did not know where to go for immediate help unless they were picked up by the police and sent to a refuge centre. During June 2007 a series of documentaries entitled &quot;Saving Planet Earth&quot; was shown on BBC Television. Young filmed an episode about saving the gorillas of West Africa during his visit to Africa earlier in the year.

In March 2009, ITV1 arts programme, &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; presented an hour long fly on the wall documentary about Young that they had been filming over the course of the year as he returned to promote the &quot;Let It Go&quot; album. It showed him in Iceland filming the video for the &quot;Let It Go&quot; single, backstage before his performance on &quot;The X Factor&quot; and on his UK theatre tour from November 2008 among other segments. In August 2011, ITV based an hour-long programme on Young, entitled &quot;A Night with... Will Young&quot;. This was to promote the release of his most recent album &quot;Echoes&quot;.

In October 2007, Young narrated an audio version of the Roald Dahl novel &quot;Danny, the Champion of the World&quot;.

Young was made a &quot;Companion&quot; of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in 2009.

In January 2023, Young returned to the theatre with the one-man show &quot;Song from Far Away&quot;, by Olivier Award winner Simon Stephens and Mark Eitzel, at the HOME Theatre in Manchester.

Young supports the charity Women&#x27;s Aid, about which he wrote, &quot;I am proud to put my name beside this cause, and hope that I might be able to help more people affected by the terrors of domestic violence, as well as help to create a wider awareness within our society.&quot;

Young also supports Mencap, about which he wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m very much in this for the long term, and I&#x27;d like to help continue to break down peoples&#x27; misconceptions and prejudices&quot;. He also supports The Children&#x27;s Society Safe and Sound Campaign, and &quot;Positive Action Southwest&quot; (PASW), for which he performed at his first solo concert, in July 2003, at Killerton House, Exeter.

Young is an ambassador for Catch22, a UK young people&#x27;s charity, which supports young people in tough situations. The young people may come from tough upbringings or districts, where poverty, crime and unemployment are common features. They may be leaving care, truanting, or have been excluded from school. Some of them have started getting into trouble with the police or may have got as far as custody. In April 2011 Young ran the London Marathon for Catch22, competing again for the charity in 2012.

On 18 April 2012, Young confirmed he would be releasing his first autobiography. The book was published by Sphere on 11 October 2012 entitled &quot;Funny Peculiar&quot;.

After having competed, with professional dancer Karen Clifton, over the first three weeks of the show, on 11 October he announced that he was quitting the show for &quot;personal reasons&quot;.

Young is a longtime supporter of wildlife charities, including WWF. He released &quot;What the World Needs Now&quot; in late 2015, from the album &quot;85% Proof&quot;, to raise awareness and funds for declining wildlife populations around the world, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s shocking to think that in my lifetime global wildlife populations have declined by over 50% and our forests and oceans remain at risk.&quot; The music video, produced by WWF, was aired on UK television in late 2015.

Young confirmed on 1 September 2020 during BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview that his new book &quot;To Be a Gay Man&quot; would be published by Virgin Books on 3 September 2020. In it, he writes of the Chris Moyles &quot;rampage of homophobia&quot; in 2009, live on BBC Radio 1, which left Young &quot;aghast&quot; and unable to speak out against it at the time.

In November 2021, Young handcuffed himself to a gate, joining a protest at Camp Beagle.

Following the death of his twin, Rupert, Young presented a Channel 4 documentary, titled &quot;Will Young: Losing My Twin Rupert&quot;. The documentary, airing on 10 May 2022, was rated 4/5 stars by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Young was praised by viewers and critics for being so open and honest about Rupert&#x27;s addiction and suicide.

== Personal life ==
In March 2002 after winning &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, Young publicly came out as gay, pre-empting a tabloid newspaper from outing him. He also stated that he had never hidden it and was comfortable with his sexual orientation. As of 2017, Young was in a relationship.

Young&#x27;s main home is a house in Dalston, East London. He also owns a 17th-century cottage in the middle of Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, where he is a keen gardener.

In an August 2024 with &quot;Attitude&quot; magazine, Young expressed his desire to start a family, specifying fostering children. He shared, &quot;I think I&#x27;d be very good at being emotionally available and emotionally validating. That&#x27;s the key for kids or young people.&quot;

On 30 July 2020, it was confirmed that Young&#x27;s twin brother, Rupert, had died, aged 41. A spokesperson for the family said, &quot;Will&#x27;s relationship with Rupert had been tough over the years at times, and they had both spoken about the mental health problems which had made it challenging ... there were hopes he had turned a corner and they are a very loving family – and utterly devastated by his passing.&quot;

In 2020, Young adopted two dogs, Domino and Diamond, which had faced being put down in America.

In April 2021 Young spoke about his experiences at his prep school, Horris Hill Preparatory School in Newbury, saying he had had PTSD. He said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about prep school, and wondering if any of those institutions will be brought to justice for the things that I saw happen ... kids thrown against radiators. Other things I can&#x27;t talk about.&quot; Young also remembered drunk teachers &quot;rolling around dormitories&quot;, and one &quot;you wouldn&#x27;t go for a ride with ... Teachers looking at our penises in the shower, in the bath ... There was such a sense of injustice from things that I experienced and witnessed ... I think I escaped – not that it didn&#x27;t damage me.&quot;

<text>Gerald Daniel Stern (February 22, 1925 – October 27, 2022) was an American poet, essayist, and educator. The author of twenty collections of poetry and four books of essays, he taught literature and creative writing at Temple University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Raritan Valley Community College and the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop. From 2009 until his death, he was a distinguished poet-in-residence and faculty member of Drew University&#x27;s graduate program for a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in poetry.

Stern was a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh and Columbia University and attended the University of Paris for post-graduate study. He received the National Book Award for Poetry in 1998 for &quot;This Time: New and Selected Poems&quot; and was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry in 1991 for &quot;Leaving Another Kingdom: Selected Poems&quot;. In 2000, Governor Christine Todd Whitman appointed him the first Poet Laureate of New Jersey.

==Early life==
Stern was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on February 22, 1925. His parents, Harry and Ida Barach Stern, were Jewish and immigrated to the United States from Ukraine and Poland, respectively, in 1905. They owned several clothing stores and sold other items including cigars. Stern attended Taylor Allderdice High School in his hometown, graduating in 1942. He was initially rejected from military service due to his poor eyesight, but served in the Army Air Forces from 1946 to 1947 after the military re-examined him. He studied at the University of Pittsburgh, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1947. Two years later, he obtained a Master of Arts from Columbia University.

==Career==
After earning his master&#x27;s degree, Stern relocated to Europe to undertake doctoral studies at the University of Paris. However, he did not finish his degree and spent his twenties traveling between New York City and Europe. It was during this time that he started to write and publish poetry. Stern went back to the US in 1956 and started teaching at Temple University. He remained there for seven years and left after being unable to receive tenure. He subsequently taught at Indiana University of Pennsylvania for four years. After a period of paid leave, he taught at Raritan Valley Community College in New Jersey, before briefly working at Pittsburgh (his alma mater) in 1979. He then went to the University of Iowa at the behest of the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, and taught there for 14 years until his retirement in 1996. Stern came out of retirement to teach at Sarah Lawrence College for a while.

Stern published his first poem, &quot;The Pineys&quot;, in 1969 in &quot;The Journal of the Rutgers University Library&quot;. Four years later, he released his first poetry collection titled &quot;Rejoicings&quot;. His work became widely recognized after the 1977 publication of his second collection, &quot;Lucky Life&quot;, which was that year&#x27;s Lamont Poetry Selection, and was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry. He also authored a series of essays on writing poetry in &quot;American Poetry Review.&quot; He went on to receive several awards for his writing, including the 1996 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, the 1998 National Book Award for &quot;This Time: New and Selected Poems,&quot; and the 2012 Library of Congress Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Award for &quot;Early Collected Poems: 1965–1992.&quot; He was Poet Laureate of New Jersey from 2000 to 2002, and received the Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets in 2005. From 2006 on Stern was a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.

In addition to the aforementioned academic institutions, Stern also taught at Rutgers University. During the mid-1970s, he was a literature consultant for both New Jersey and Pennsylvania Council of the Arts as well as a coordinator for Pennsylvania&#x27;s poetry in schools program. Stern was a faculty member and co-founder of New England College&#x27;s Master of Fine Arts Program in Poetry.

==Personal life==
Stern married Patricia Miller in 1952. They had two children together. They divorced in the 1980s. He was in a domestic partnership with poet Anne Marie Macari during the last 25 years of his life, and he lived in New York City and Miami Beach, Florida.

Stern died on October 27, 2022, at the Calvary Hospice in New York City. He was 97 years old.

<doc id="298184" wikidata="Q623933" url="?curid=298184" title="Darius Campbell Danesh">
<text>Darius Campbell Danesh (19 August 1980 – 11 August 2022) was a Scottish singer-songwriter, actor and film producer. He first came to prominence as Darius Danesh when he appeared in the first series of &quot;Popstars&quot; in 2001, and the 2002 inaugural series of the ITV talent contest &quot;Pop Idol&quot;.

Under the name Darius, he released two studio albums, &quot;Dive In&quot; (2002) and &quot;Live Twice&quot; (2004), with both reaching top 40 in the UK Albums Chart. His debut single, &quot;Colourblind&quot;, reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in 2002. His next singles, &quot;Rushes&quot; and &quot;Incredible (What I Meant to Say)&quot;, reached the top ten in the UK in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

Danesh performed the role of Billy Flynn in the West End production of &quot;Chicago&quot; in two runs of the musical. He played the lead role of Sky Masterson in the Olivier Award-winning &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, and the originating role of Rhett Butler in Sir Trevor Nunn&#x27;s theatrical adaptation of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

In 2010, he trained with tenor Rolando Villazón, won the ITV competition &quot;Popstar to Operastar&quot; and performed a duet with Villazón on &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;. The UK&#x27;s biggest operatic production was the occasion of his operatic début, at the O2 Arena with the Royal Philharmonic, in &quot;Carmen&quot;. At the age of 29, he assumed the lead role of Escamillo, Carmen&#x27;s lover. The same year, he also starred in &quot;The History of the Big Bands&quot; tour, a show which takes the audience on a musical journey through the big band and swing era.

==Early life==
Campbell Danesh was born in Glasgow on 19 August 1980 to a Scottish mother, Avril Campbell, and an Iranian father, Booth Danesh (); his family live in Bearsden. He was the eldest of three boys. He attended Bearsden Primary School and the Glasgow Academy, before going on to study English Literature and Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh.

==Career==
===2001–2002: &quot;Popstars&quot; and &quot;Pop Idol&quot;===
Danesh&#x27;s professional career began with a non-singing role in the Scottish Opera&#x27;s avant garde 1990s production of &quot;The Trojans&quot;. As a teenager, he then performed at Covent Garden Royal Opera House with the Scottish Opera in a production of &quot;Carmen&quot;.

As Darius Danesh, he first gained fame in 2001 after appearing on the British talent competition &quot;Popstars&quot;. A year later he was voted to the finals of the TV talent show, &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. He turned down Simon Cowell&#x27;s record deal, then signed with producer Steve Lillywhite.

In an interview to &quot;Daily Record&quot;, he said that he had not decided to drop the &quot;Campbell&quot; from his name, and that all was decided for him and that he should go by the name Darius Danesh.

===2002–2004: &quot;Colourblind&quot; and &quot;Dive In&quot;===
The first single written by Danesh, &quot;Colourblind&quot;, was released on 29 July 2002 and entered the UK singles chart at number 1, staying at the top of the charts for two weeks; it was certified silver. It became certified gold on 1 May 2020.

His debut album, &quot;Dive In&quot;, was certified platinum in the UK in 2004, charting at number 6 on the UK Albums Chart during the competitive pre-Christmas sales period. He subsequently had five UK top ten singles.

He wrote all 12 songs on the &quot;Dive In&quot; album, and produced one of the tracks, &quot;Better Than That&quot;, whilst collaborating with a number of other producers, such as The Misfits and The Matrix on the other tracks. Steve Lillywhite was executive producer on the album. Danesh, then performing as Darius Danesh, supported Shakira on her world tour and went on to complete his own sell-out UK Dive In tour.

The Dive In tour took place in April and May 2003. The fifteen dates scheduled for May expanded to twenty three dates on public demand.

===2004–2008: &quot;Sink or Swim&quot;, &quot;Live Twice&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;===
His book &quot;Sink or Swim&quot;, about the perils of the music business, was a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; best seller. He contributed to the War Child charity album with Coldplay and Oasis. He also headlined in India with Alanis Morissette.

After receiving news that his father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, he wrote and dedicated his second studio album &quot;Live Twice&quot; to Dr Booth Danesh, who later made a miraculous recovery. In 2005, the album&#x27;s title-track &quot;Live Twice&quot; became his fifth top ten single.

Danesh had two West End runs in &quot;Chicago&quot; during 2005–2006, and at 25, became the youngest actor to fill the role of Billy Flynn since the show first opened on Broadway in 1975.

In 2007, after seeing Ewan McGregor in the role, he played the lead in Michael Grandage&#x27;s Olivier Award-winning production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, starring as Sky Masterson. Later that year, he reprised his role of Billy Flynn for the 10th anniversary charity performance of &quot;Chicago&quot; in London, to benefit the charities Breast Cancer Haven and Breast Health Institute.

In 2008, he returned to London&#x27;s West End to play Rhett Butler in Sir Trevor Nunn&#x27;s musical adaptation of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

===2010–2015: &quot;Popstar to Operastar&quot; and &quot;From Here to Eternity the Musical&quot; ===
In January and February 2010, Danesh won the UK&#x27;s ITV1 talent show &quot;Popstar to Operastar&quot;, in which eight pop stars were trained to perform famous opera arias. He was mentored by tenor Rolando Villazón, with whom he went on to duet on the song &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;. In May 2010 he appeared as toreador Escamillo in Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot; at The O2 Arena in London. At the age of 29, he assumed the lead role of Carmen&#x27;s lover. The same year, he starred in &quot;The History of the Big Bands&quot; tour, a show about the Big Band and Swing Era, featuring the songs of Frank Sinatra and the music of the key musicians of the big band era, including music from Harry James, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman and Buddy Rich.

On 1 July 2013, it was announced that Danesh would play the lead role of Warden in the show &quot;From Here to Eternity the Musical&quot;.

===2015–2022: &quot;Funny Girl&quot; and final works===
Danesh played Nick Arnstein in &quot;Funny Girl&quot; at the Savoy Theatre in the West End, following a transfer from the Menier Chocolate Factory in April 2016.

Weeks prior to his death in August 2022, Danesh was said to have been &quot;excited&quot; about an upcoming &quot;Pop Idol&quot; re-union, with it being rumoured that he was set to duet with both Will Young and Gareth Gates in a reunion special which would be hosted by Ant &amp; Dec. Filming was due to commence at Criterion Theatre in London.

==Other work==
===Television===
In 2003, Danesh appeared as himself in an episode of the Channel 4 soap &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, performing &quot;Girl in the Moon&quot; at a graduation ball. In 2009, he guest starred on the BBC show &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot; as Gennaro Fazio, an Italian magazine editor.

===Charity===
Danesh was an ambassador for The Prince&#x27;s Trust, helping underprivileged youth. He designed a guitar for Guitar Aid. He worked with and supported the Lymphoma Association and Cancer Research UK, in addition to other cancer charities.

==Personal life==
In 2010, Danesh was seriously injured in a car crash in Spain, which left him with chronic neck pain. He declined an operation because there was a risk it would affect his vocal cords.

Danesh married Canadian actress Natasha Henstridge in February 2011. They filed for divorce in July 2013. The divorce was finalised in February 2018.

==Death==
Campbell Danesh was found unresponsive on 11 August 2022 in his apartment in Rochester, Minnesota, United States, and he was pronounced dead later that day. His family reported there were no suspicious circumstances or signs of intent surrounding his death. A private funeral was held on 25 August 2022 at a church in the Glasgow suburb of Bearsden, attended by family members and close friends.

An autopsy report, released on 10 September 2022, concluded that Danesh died from inhalation of chloroethane, which led to respiratory arrest. He used chloroethane in addition to physiotherapy to treat his neck pain. His death was ruled accidental. Danesh had suffered from chronic pain since a car accident in 2010 while on a holiday in Spain.

Tributes were paid by his close friend Gerard Butler and others who had worked closely with Danesh, including Simon Cowell, Gareth Gates, Will Young and Ant &amp; Dec. Eight days after his death, his debut single &quot;Colourblind&quot; charted at number two on both the UK Official Singles Download and Sales charts.

<doc id="298190" wikidata="Q1065215" url="?curid=298190" title="Univers">
<text>Univers () is a sans-serif typeface family designed by Adrian Frutiger and released by his employer Deberny &amp; Peignot in 1957. Classified as a neo-grotesque sans-serif, one based on the model of nineteenth-century German typefaces such as Akzidenz-Grotesk, it was notable for its availability from the moment of its launch in a comprehensive range of weights and widths. The original marketing for Univers deliberately referenced the periodic table to emphasise its scope.

Univers was one of the first typeface families to fulfil the idea that a typeface should form a family of consistent, related designs. Past sans-serif designs such as Gill Sans had much greater differences between weights, while loose families such as American Type Founders&#x27; Franklin Gothic family often were advertised under different names for each style, to emphasise that they were not completely matching. By creating a matched range of styles and weights, Univers allowed documents to be created in one consistent typeface for all text, making it easier to artistically set documents in sans-serif type. This matched the desire among practitioners of the &quot;Swiss style&quot; of typography for neutral sans-serif typefaces avoiding artistic excesses.

The design concept of Univers was intended to take advantage of the new technology of phototypesetting, in which fonts were stored as glass discs rather than as solid metal type and matrices for every size to be used. Deberny &amp; Peignot had established itself as a leader in this technology, although as by the time of its launch metal type was still very popular, the design was also released in this form. Univers was rapidly licensed and re-released by Monotype, Linotype, American Type Founders, IBM and others for phototypesetting, for metal type and reproduction by typewriter. Historian James Mosley has described it as &quot;probably the last major&quot; release of a large family as metal type.

==Characteristics==
Univers is one of a group of neo-grotesque sans-serif typefaces, all released in 1957, that includes Folio and Neue Haas Grotesk (later renamed Helvetica). As all are based on Akzidenz-Grotesk, these three faces are sometimes confused with each other. These typefaces figure prominently in the Swiss Style of graphic design.

Univers was released after a long period in which geometric typefaces such as Futura had been popular. Frutiger disliked purely geometric designs, finding them too rigid, following a common school of thought among Swiss designers of the period. While studying at the Kunstgewerbeschule (Arts and Crafts School) in Zürich, he had begun to sketch a revived grotesque family based on 19th-century grotesques, at the time considered antiquated outside Switzerland. He described Univers in 1998 as having a &#x27;visual sensitivity between thick and thin&#x27; strokes, avoiding perfect geometry.

Different weights and variations within the type family are designated by the use of numbers rather than names, a system since adopted by Frutiger for other type designs. Frutiger envisioned a large family with multiple widths and weights that maintained a unified design idiom. However, the actual typeface names within Univers family include both number and letter suffixes. The design, with a working title of &quot;Monde&quot;, was developed from 1953 to a final release in 1957.

Like most grotesque and neo-grotesque sans-serifs, Univers&#x27;s slanted form is an oblique, in which the letterforms are slanted, with minor corrections but no other major alterations. This is different from a true italic, in which the letterforms become modified to resemble handwriting more. In the original design, Frutiger chose obliques with the extremely aggressive slant of sixteen degrees, which was reduced to twelve in some later releases. Linotype Univers (below) returns to the original angle.
Frutiger&#x27;s original ampersand was a true &#x27;et&#x27; ligature, similar to that in Trebuchet among others. Frutiger later provided an alternative for non French-speaking countries in which the form might be less familiar.

The Deberny &amp; Peignot library was acquired in 1972 by Haas Type Foundry. It was transferred into the D. Stempel AG and Linotype collection in 1985 and 1989 respectively upon the Haas&#x27;sche Schriftgiesserei&#x27;s acquisition and closure; it is now owned by Monotype following its purchase of Linotype in 2007. An independent version of Univers was licensed by the Berthold Type Foundry for its phototypesetting system with adaptations by Günter Gerhard Lange; Frutiger wrote in his autobiography that he had some affection for it.

==Comparison with Akzidenz-Grotesk, Folio, and Helvetica==

Univers is similar in design to other European grotesque fonts, of which Akzidenz-Grotesk, Folio, and Helvetica are among the most common. Differences include:

* The tail of &#x27;a&#x27; and the top of &#x27;1&#x27; are much less rounded.
* Upper-case &#x27;G&#x27; is formed without an arrow head (called a &quot;spur&quot;).
* Both arms of &#x27;K&#x27; join at the stem.
* The tail of &#x27;Q&#x27; runs along the baseline.
* The tail of &#x27;R&#x27; is curved (compared with Akzidenz-Grotesk).
* The top of &#x27;t&#x27; is angled.
* The dot of the &#x27;i&#x27; is not square but a rectangle.
* Lower-case &#x27;y&#x27; has a straight descender.
* Many of the numerals in Univers have straight vs. curved ascenders
* Helvetica tends to have a slightly greater x-height than Univers
* Univers generally has quite a wide spacing between letters, and its low x-height gives it a more low-slung, splayed appearance than Helvetica, especially in bold.

Frutiger himself has commented: &quot;Helvetica is the jeans, and Univers the dinner jacket.&quot; Walter Tracy described it as better proportioned for text than Helvetica: &quot;more original and subtle in its modelling than Helvetica and, because its character spacing was properly done, a better performer in text composition.&quot; Mosley has described its even design as &quot;rather bland&quot; and noted that Monotype&#x27;s eccentric, chaotically organised Grotesque family remained popular with more &quot;iconoclastic&quot; printers in the 1960s. Stephen Coles describes Univers as &quot;in some ways, even more spare [than Helvetica] (no beards or tails)&quot; and Simon Loxley comments that Helvetica &quot;escapes the chilliness of Univers...it does have some elusive quality that gives it a friendlier feel&quot;. Dutch font designer Martin Majoor, while praising Univers for its &quot;almost scientific&quot; range of weights, criticised it for its lack of originality: &quot;basing a sans serif on another is rather cheap.&quot; Frutiger&#x27;s later landmark sans-serif designs, Avenir and Frutiger, would take very different, more humanist and geometric approaches.

==Usage==
Univers enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and 1970s because many corporations adopted it for usage. It was also adopted by the 1972 Summer Olympics organizers for its image and emblem also in 1976 Summer Olympics. General Electric used the font from 1986 to 2004 before switching to GE Inspira. Apple Inc. previously used this typeface as well as its condensed oblique variant for the keycaps on many of its keyboards. Munich Re used a custom version of Univers until 2009.

Univers is used as an official logo in lowercase for UNICEF since 2003.

Audi Sans is a variant based on Univers, designed by Ole Schäfer. It became Audi&#x27;s corporate identity font in the 1990s when Audi contracted MetaDesign to support Audi&#x27;s brand management strategy. The font was used extensively by Audi, appearing in sales literature, corporate communications, owners&#x27; documentation and even on the vehicles themselves in the instrument panel graphics and their MMI dashboard displays.

Both the current and the former eBay logo are set in Univers.

==The Frutiger numbering system==
Adrian Frutiger designed his unique classification system to eliminate naming and specifying confusion. It was first used with Univers, and was adopted for use in the Frutiger, Avenir, and Neue Helvetica typeface families.

The number used in a font is a concatenation of two numbers. The first digit defines weight, while the second defines width and whether it is oblique or not.

(note: oblique is not strict italic)

As an example, the number 56 denotes the &quot;normal weight&quot; (a first digit of 5) and an &quot;oblique style&quot; with the normal width (a second digit of 6).

Due to some typeface manufacturers’ failure to understand and implement the system correctly, however, things have actually become more confusing. To further complicate matters, the numbering system is not consistently applied to the Univers font family. In older publications, all oblique fonts have even-numbered 2nd values; but in digital versions, both odd and even 2nd values have been used on oblique fonts, but not in all font formats or weights. For example, Univers 55 Roman Oblique has both Windows menu names and PostScript full names as &quot;Univers LT 55 Oblique&quot; and &quot;Univers 56 Oblique&quot;, but only for the Windows PostScript version of the font; however, in Univers 85 Extra Black Oblique, there is no font named Univers 86 in any format. Nevertheless, oblique Univers fonts always have even-numbered 2nd value.

Inconsistent usage aside, the syntax of 2nd value is also inconsistent with 1st value. Bigger 1st value implies the glyph of a given character uses more horizontal space, but it has opposite meaning in 2nd value.

===Linotype numbering system===
In Linotype Univers and Univers Next font family, a 3-number system is used. First numeral describes font weight, second numeral describes font width, third numeral describes position.

Unlike the original Univers, tilted fonts in Linotype Univers and derivative font families have not been named &#x27;oblique&#x27;.

==Releases==
Versions of Univers have been released for almost every major typesetting system, including versions for a wide range of writing systems and with additional features such as schoolbook characters.

Although Univers was originally conceived to take advantage of the cost-saving properties of phototypesetting (Deberny &amp; Peignot, hoping to leapfrog their competitors by taking full advantage of the new technology, advertised their Lumitype glass master discs as each replacing three tons of brass matrices), Deberny &amp; Peignot arranged licensing deals with type foundries such as Monotype for wider release. Univers was quite successful in metal type, with several weights among Monotype&#x27;s best-selling of all time despite being released at the very end of the metal type era, although Frutiger felt that the Monotype version, which some later versions copied, was limited by the antiquated Monotype technical system.

===Pre-digital versions===

Frutiger (with Howard &quot;Bud&quot; Kettler) adapted Univers for the IBM Selectric Composer in the 1960s. This was an ultra-premium electric &#x27;golfball&#x27; typewriter system, intended to be used for producing high-quality office documents or copy to be photographically enlarged for small-scale printing projects. Unlike most typewriters, the Composer produced proportional type, rather than monospaced letters. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, as it was displaced by cheaper phototypesetting, and then in the 1980s by word processors and general-purpose computers. The release was somewhat compromised due having to be made to fit a 9-unit escapement system.

Several pirate versions of Univers have been released taking advantage of the lack of copyright protection of typeface designs. One unusual modified version was &quot;Univers Flair&quot;, a 1970s phototype clone from Phil Martin&#x27;s &quot;Alphabet Innovations&quot;, adding ostentatious swashes. Frutiger, who found it amusing, placed a specimen on his office wall.

===URW Classic Sans===
Univers 45, 55, 65, 57, 67, 53 and 63 (regular and bold weights with obliques in regular and condensed widths) are incorporated in the PostScript 3 digital printing standard as core fonts. As part of the Ghostscript project to create a free alternative to PostScript, URW++ donated its clones of these weights under the series name U001, and then as URW Classic Sans under the Aladdin Free Public License.

===Linotype Univers===
In 1997 Frutiger reworked the whole Univers family in cooperation with Linotype, thus creating the Linotype Univers, which consists of 63 fonts. By reworking the Univers more &quot;extreme&quot; weights as &quot;Ultra Light&quot; or &quot;Extended Heavy&quot; were added as well as some monospaced typefaces. The numbering system was extended to three digits to reflect the larger number of variations in the family.

In addition to extra font width and weight combinations, the fonts are digitally interpolated, so that character widths scale uniformly with changing font weights. For fonts within a specific font weight, caps height, x-height, ascender and descender heights are the same. For oblique fonts, the slope is increased from 12° to the 16° of Frutiger&#x27;s original drawings, and the character widths were adjusted optically. In addition, characters such as &amp;, ®, euro sign, are redesigned, the ampersand to Frutiger&#x27;s preferred true et ligature.

===Linotype Univers Typewriter===
Linotype Univers Typewriter is a sub-family of fixed-width fonts under the Linotype Univers family. Four fonts have been produced in Regular and Bold weights, with obliques on each weight. Characters such as 1, I, J, M, W, i, j, l, dotless j are drawn differently.

===Univers Next (2010)===
In 2010, Linotype extended the Linotype Univers family with true small caps and renamed as &quot;Univers Next&quot;. All later extensions of the font family were marketed under the Univers Next title.

<doc id="298197" wikidata="Q758380" url="?curid=298197" title="Au Pairs">
<text>The Au Pairs were a British post-punk band that formed in Birmingham in 1978 and continued until 1983. They produced two studio albums and three singles. Their songs were said to have &quot;contempt for the cliches of contemporary sexual politics&quot; and their music has been compared to that of the Gang of Four and the Young Marble Giants. The band was led by Lesley Woods, who was once described as &quot;one of the most striking women in British rock&quot;.

==Career==
Au Pairs formed in Birmingham in 1978. Their first album, &quot;Playing with a Different Sex&quot;, is considered a post-punk classic, with strong, sarcastic songs such as &quot;It&#x27;s Obvious&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re So Cool&quot; taking a dry look at gender relations. Other songs, such as &quot;Armagh&quot;—with its refrain, &quot;we don&#x27;t torture&quot;—criticized the British government&#x27;s treatment of Irish Republican prisoners during the troubles in Northern Ireland.

In 1980 the band were filmed live for the concert film &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot;.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Sense and Sensuality&quot; (1982), showed a greater influence of jazz, soul, funk and disco on the band&#x27;s sound, but was less well received.

Following the departure of bassist Jane Munro in 1983, the band recruited Nick O&#x27;Connor who also played piano and synthesizers. At this time the group were further augmented by Jayne Morris (percussion and backing vocals), Graeme Hamilton (trumpet) and Cara Tivey on additional keyboards. The band were scheduled to record a third album with producer Steve Lillywhite in 1983 but broke up. Woods has intimated that the hostility and violence she and other women faced playing music was a factor in the group&#x27;s demise: &quot;There comes a point where you can’t go on any more at that level,&quot; she told Nige Tassell of &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Woods formed an all-woman band called the Darlings in the late 1980s, but then left the music industry. Now, as Lesley Longhurst-Woods, she works as a lawyer in London. Guitarist Paul Foad published a guitar technique book, co-written with Stuart Ritchie, titled &quot;The Caged Guitarist&quot; (2000). Bass player Jane Munro works as an alternative therapist (aromatherapy, reflexology and Indian head massage) in Birmingham. Pete Hammond also remains an active musician and teaches percussion in Birmingham.

==Reception==
In mid-1981 critic Robin Denselow of the London &quot;Guardian&quot; praised the group&#x27;s &quot;viciously well-observed lyrics on contemporary life and love and the role of women’.

The Au Pairs toured the United States in 1981. In a review of their first show at the Whisky a Go Go, critic Richard Cromelin said: &quot;When the crowd at the Whisky kept calling Au Pairs back to the stage for encores Wednesday night, it was as if they were trying to tell the group&#x27;s singer Lesley Woods that her band had done just fine and she could go ahead and loosen up a little.&quot;

Writing about their show at The Ritz, John Rockwell said &quot;The Au Pairs blend political lyrics, a tough, funk-dance-rock idiom and an at least initially dispassionate vocal style, rather like the Gang of Four meeting the Young Marble Giants&quot; and suggested that Lesley Woods &quot;and the band were able to build the insinuating monotones of the songs early in the set through street taunts into a rousing rock-and-roll climax.&quot;

Music historian Gillian G. Gaar noted in her 2002 &quot;She&#x27;s a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock and Roll (Live Girls)&quot; that the band mingled male and female musicians in a revolutionary collaborative way, as part of its outspoken explorations of sexual politics.

<doc id="298210" wikidata="Q863794" url="?curid=298210" title="Chili con carne">
<text>Chili con carne ( ), often shortened to chili, is a spicy stew of Mexican origin containing chili peppers (sometimes in the form of chili powder), meat (usually beef), tomatoes, and often pinto beans or kidney beans. Other seasonings may include garlic, onions, and cumin.

The types of meat and other ingredients used vary based on geographic and personal tastes. Recipes provoke disputes among aficionados, some of whom insist that the word &quot;chili&quot; applies only to the basic dish, without beans and tomatoes. Chili con carne is a common dish for cook-offs, and may be used as a side, garnish, or ingredient in other dishes, such as soups or salsas.

==Origins and history==
In writings from 1529, the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún described chili pepper-seasoned stews being consumed in the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, now the location of Mexico City. The use of beef as the primary meat originated when the Spanish introduced cattle to Mexico. 

Most of the beef being consumed in Mexico, especially by the Rancheros or cowboys in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, was dried salted beef known as “tasajo” or “cecina”. Tasajo was consumed in many dishes, including a stew of red chili sauce known as &quot;Carne con Chile,&quot; or meat with chili. Carne con chile was very common throughout much of Mexico, as it was an easy and cheap meal. An English naval officer and explorer, George Francis Lyon, wrote in 1826 about eating dried beef in a chili sauce with Rancheros while travelling through northern Veracruz, near Pánuco: French colonist Mathieu de Fossey had a similar experience in 1831 when he was served tasajo cooked in chili in the village of Jáltipan near Coatzacoalcos in southern Veracruz: In her 1843 book &quot;Life in Mexico&quot;, Scottish noblewoman Frances Erskine Inglis wrote about eating a dish called &quot;embarrado&quot;, a composition of meat and chili, while attending the &quot;rodeo&quot; (cattle roundup) and &quot;herradero&quot; (cattle branding celebration) in the village of Santiago in the state of Hidalgo in 1840: 

American traveler Theodore Taylor Johnson also wrote about eating &quot;carne con chile&quot; while in San Blas, Nayarit in 1849: 

In Spanish, the term &quot;chile con carne&quot;, consisting of the word &quot;chile&quot; (from the Nahuatl &quot;chīlli&quot;) and &quot;con carne&quot;, Spanish for &#x27;with meat&#x27;, is first recorded in a book from 1857 about the Mexican–American War. A recipe dating back to the 1850s describes dried beef, suet, dried chili peppers and salt, which were pounded together, formed into bricks and left to dry, which could then be boiled in pots in an army encampment in Monterrey, of what is now Nuevo León, Mexico.

Chili also became commonly prepared in northern Mexico and southern Texas. Unlike some other Texas foods, such as barbecued brisket, chili largely originated with working-class Tejana and Mexican women. The &quot;chili queens&quot; of San Antonio, Texas, were particularly famous in previous decades for selling their inexpensive chili-flavored beef stew in their casual &quot;chili joints&quot;.

The San Antonio Chili Stand, in operation at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, helped popularize chili by giving many Americans their first taste of it. San Antonio was a tourist destination and helped Texas-style chili con carne spread throughout the South and West of the United States. Chili con carne is the official dish of the U.S. state of Texas as designated by the House Concurrent Resolution Number 18 of the 65th Texas Legislature during its regular session in 1977.

===Chili parlors===
Before World War II, hundreds of small, family-run chili parlors could be found throughout Texas and other states, particularly those in which émigré Texans had made new homes. Each establishment usually had a claim to some kind of secret recipe.

By 1904, chili parlors were opening outside of Texas, in part due to the availability of commercial versions of chili powder, first manufactured in Texas in the late 19th century. After working at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Charles Taylor opened a chili parlor in Carlinville, Illinois, serving &quot;Mexican Chili&quot;. Varallo&#x27;s, the oldest restaurant in Tennessee, opened as a chili parlor in 1907, competing with other chili parlors that had opened in Nashville during the 1890s. In the 1920s and 1930s, chains of diner-style chili parlors began opening in the Midwest.

Cincinnati chili is a substantially different dish developed by Macedonian and Greek immigrants, deriving from their own culinary traditions. Dozens of restaurants offer this style throughout the Cincinnati area. It can be traced back to at least 1922, when the original Empress Chili location opened.

In Green Bay, Wisconsin, the chili parlor Chili John&#x27;s has existed since 1913. As with Cincinnati chili, it is most commonly served over spaghetti with oyster crackers, but the recipe has more chili powder and a higher proportion of fat. The original proprietor&#x27;s son opened a second location in Burbank, California in 1946, which remains open. The Green Bay location closed in 2020.

Until the late 2000s, a chili parlor dating to 1904, O.T. Hodge, continued to operate in St. Louis. It featured a chili-topped dish called a slinger: two cheeseburger patties, hash browns, and two eggs, and smothered in chili. As of 2014 no O.T. Hodge-branded locations remain, though Tully&#x27;s Tap, a pub and restaurant in O&#x27;Fallon, Missouri, offers what it claims to be the original O.T. Hodge recipe on its menu.

==Dispute over ingredients==
===Beans===
Beans, a staple of Tex-Mex cuisine, have been associated with chili as far back as the early 20th century. The question of whether beans belong in chili has long been a matter of contention among chili cooks. While it is generally accepted that the earliest chilis did not include beans, proponents of their inclusion contend that chili with beans has a long enough history to be considered authentic. The Chili Appreciation Society International, an organization that mainly operates in Texas, United States, specified in 1999 that, among other things, cooks in their competitions are forbidden to include beans in the preparation of chili for official competition—nor are they allowed to marinate any meats. Small red or pink common beans are commonly used for chili, as are black beans, black-eyed peas, kidney beans, pinto beans, great northern beans, or navy beans.
Most commercially prepared canned chili includes beans. Commercial chili prepared without beans is usually called &quot;chili no beans&quot; in the United States. Some U.S. manufacturers, notably Bush Brothers and Company and Eden Organic, also sell canned precooked beans (without meat) that are labeled &quot;chili beans&quot;; these beans are intended for consumers to add to a chili recipe and are often sold with spices added.

===Tomatoes===
Tomatoes are another ingredient on which opinions differ. Wick Fowler, a north Texas newspaperman and inventor of &quot;Two-Alarm Chili&quot; (which he later marketed as a kit of spices), insisted on adding tomato sauce to his chili in the ratio of one 15-ounce can per three pounds of meat (425 g per 1.36 kg). He also believed that chili should never be eaten freshly cooked, but refrigerated overnight to seal in the flavor. Matt Weinstock, a Los Angeles newspaper columnist, once remarked that Fowler&#x27;s chili &quot;was reputed to open eighteen sinus cavities unknown to the medical profession&quot;.

==Variations==

===Vegetarian chili===

Vegetarian chili (also known as chili sin carne, chili without meat, chili non carne, and chili sans carne) acquired wide popularity in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s with the rise of vegetarianism. It is also popular with those on a diet restricting the use of red meat. To make the chili vegetarian, the cook leaves out the meat or replaces it with a meat analogue, such as textured vegetable protein or tofu, quinoa, or a starchy vegetable, such as potatoes. These chilis nearly always include beans. Variants may contain corn, squash, sautéed mushrooms, pearl onions, shallots or beets.

===Chile verde===
Chile verde (&#x27;green chile&#x27;) is a moderately to extremely spicy New Mexican stew or sauce usually made from chunks of pork that have been slow-cooked in chicken broth, garlic, green tomatillos, and roasted green chile. The spiciness of the chile is adjusted by the use of various peppers: Hatch chile, poblano, jalapeño, serrano, and occasionally habanero. Chile verde is a common filling for the Mission burrito.

=== Cactus chili ===
Cactus chili is a spicy Southwestern stew that is a variation on traditional chili con carne, usually containing traditional ingredients such as chili peppers, beef, tomatoes, and pinto beans, along with sliced cactus pieces. It is traditionally cooked in a slow cooker and served with a side of salted crackers. Cactus chili is a relatively rare variation of chili con carne. However, it has gained prominence as a menu item at restaurant chains such as Showmars.

===White chili===

White chili is made using chicken or turkey meat and broth, white beans, and green chili peppers. The resulting dish appears light in color when cooked. A white cheese, such as Monterey Jack, or sour cream are often added when served.

==Accompaniments and additions==
The dish may be served with toppings or accompaniments; grated cheese, diced onions, and sour cream are common toppings, as are saltine crackers, tortilla chips or corn chips, cornbread, rolled-up corn or flour tortillas, and pork tamales. Chili can also be served over rice or pasta in dishes such as chili mac.

==Pre-made chili==
===Canned chili===
Willie Gebhardt, originally of New Braunfels, Texas, and later of San Antonio, produced the first canned chili in 1908. Rancher Lyman Davis near Corsicana, Texas, developed Wolf Brand Chili in 1895. He owned a meat market and was a particular fan of Texas-style chili. In the 1880s, in partnership with an experienced range cook, he began producing heavily spiced chili based on chunks of lean beef and rendered beef suet, which he sold by the pot to local cafés.

In 1921, Davis began canning his product, naming it for his pet wolf, Kaiser Bill. Wolf Brand canned chili was a favorite of Will Rogers, who always took along a case when traveling and performing in other regions of the world. Ernest Tubb, the country singer, was such a fan that one Texas hotel maintained a supply of Wolf Brand for his visits. Both the Gebhardt and Wolf brands are now owned by ConAgra Foods, Inc. Another major maker of canned chili, Hormel, sells chili available with or without beans, made with turkey or in vegetarian varieties, under their own name and other brands like Stagg.

===Brick chili===
Another method of marketing commercial chili in the days before widespread home refrigerators was &quot;brick chili&quot;. It was produced by pressing out nearly all of the moisture, leaving a solid substance roughly the size and shape of a half-brick. Wolf Brand was originally sold in this form. Commonly available in small towns and rural areas of the American Southwest in the first three-quarters of the 20th century, brick chili has largely been superseded by canned chili. A few manufacturers, such as XLNT Foods and Dolores Canning in Southern California, continue to distribute brick chili to supermarkets.

===Seasoning mix===
Home cooks may also purchase seasoning mixes for chili, including packets of dry ingredients such as chili powder, salt, and cayenne pepper, to flavor meat and other ingredients.

==Other dishes made with chili==
* A chili dog is a hot dog served with a topping of chili (usually without beans).
* A chili burger is a burger topped with chili (usually without beans). 
* Chili is also added to french fries and cheese to make chili cheese fries, or Coney Island fries.
* Chili mac is a dish made with canned chili, or roughly the same ingredients as chili (meat, spices, onion, tomato sauce, beans, and sometimes other vegetables), with the addition of macaroni or some other pasta. Chili mac is a standard dish in the U.S. military and is one of the varieties of Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE).
* A Frito pie or walking taco, as it is called at festivals and county fairs in the midwest, typically consists of a small, single-serving bag of Fritos corn chips with a cup of chili poured over them, often topped with grated cheese or onions and jalapeños and sour cream. Frito pies are popular in the southwestern United States.

<doc id="298214" wikidata="Q14906" url="?curid=298214" title="Garlic press">
<text>A garlic press, also known as a garlic crusher, is a kitchen utensil to crush garlic cloves efficiently by forcing them through a grid of small holes, usually with some type of piston. Many garlic presses also have a device with a matching grid of blunt pins to clean out the holes.

The inventor of the garlic press is generally held to be Karl Zysset (1907–1988) founder of the Swiss kitchen utensil company Zyliss.

Garlic presses present a convenient alternative to mincing garlic with a knife, especially because a clove of garlic can be passed through a sturdy press without even removing its peel. The peel remains in the press while the garlic is extruded out. Some sources also claim that pressing with the peel on makes cleaning the press easier.

Garlic crushed by a press is generally believed to have a different flavor from minced garlic, more of garlic&#x27;s strong flavor compounds are liberated. A few sources prefer the flavor of pressed garlic. Raw-foods chef Renée Underkoffler says &quot;a good garlic press makes dealing with garlic a clean pleasure. Pressed garlic has a lighter, more delicate flavor than minced garlic because it excludes the bitter center stem.&quot; The magazine &quot;Cook&#x27;s Illustrated&quot; says &quot;a good garlic press can break down cloves more finely and evenly than an average cook using a knife, which means better distribution of garlic flavor throughout any given dish.&quot;

On the other hand, some chefs say garlic crushed in a press has an inferior flavor compared to other forms of garlic. For instance, chef Anthony Bourdain called garlic presses &quot;abominations&quot; and advised &quot;&quot;don&#x27;t&quot; put it through a press. I don&#x27;t know what that junk is that squeezes out of the end of those things, but it ain&#x27;t garlic.&quot; The cookery writer Elizabeth David wrote an essay titled &quot;Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless&quot;. Alton Brown (known for his dislike of single-purpose kitchen tools) has referred to garlic presses as &quot;useless&quot; and without a reason to exist.

&quot;Cook&#x27;s Illustrated&quot; lists some additional uses for a garlic press, such as mashing other small items (including olives, capers, anchovies, ginger and canned chipotles) or pressing out small quantities of onion or shallot juice.

== Collection ==
The largest collection of unique garlic presses is thought to be owned by Tord Elfwendahl, Stockholm, who has since 1979 collected an excess of 1200 unique garlic presses.

<doc id="298221" wikidata="Q6500754" url="?curid=298221" title="Internship">
<text>An internship is a period of work experience offered by an organization for a limited period of time. Once confined to medical graduates, internship is used to practice for a wide range of placements in businesses, non-profit organizations and government agencies. They are typically undertaken by students and graduates looking to gain relevant skills and experience in a particular field. Employers benefit from these placements because they often recruit employees from their best interns, who have known capabilities, thus saving time and money in the long run. Internships are usually arranged by third-party organizations that recruit interns on behalf of industry groups. Rules vary from country to country about when interns should be regarded as employees. The system can be open to exploitation by unscrupulous employers.

Internships for professional careers are similar in some ways. Similar to internships, apprenticeships transition students from vocational school into the workforce. The lack of standardization and oversight leaves the term &quot;internship&quot; open to broad interpretation. Interns may be high school students, college and university students, or post-graduate adults. These positions may be paid or unpaid and are temporary. Many large corporations, particularly investment banks, have &quot;insights&quot; programs that serve as a pre-internship event numbering a day to a week, either in person or virtually. 

Typically, an internship consists of an exchange of services for experience between the intern and the organization. Internships are used to determine whether the intern still has an interest in that field after the real-life experience. In addition, an internship can be used to build a professional network that can assist with letters of recommendation or lead to future employment opportunities. The benefit of bringing an intern into full-time employment is that they are already familiar with the company, therefore needing little to no training. Internships provide current college students with the ability to participate in a field of their choice to receive hands-on learning about a particular future career, preparing them for full-time work following graduation.

== Types ==

Internships exist in a wide variety of industries and settings. An internship can be paid, unpaid, or partially paid (in the form of a stipend). Internships may be part-time or full-time and are usually flexible with students&#x27; schedules. A typical internship lasts between one and four months, but can be shorter or longer, depending on the organization involved. The act of job shadowing may also constitute interning.
*Insights: Many large corporations, particularly investment banks, have &quot;insights&quot; programs that serve as a pre-internship event numbering a day to a week, either in person or virtually. 
*Paid internships are common in professional fields including medicine, architecture, science, engineering, law, business (especially accounting and finance), technology, and advertising. Work experience internships usually occur during the second or third year of schooling. This type of internship is to expand an intern&#x27;s knowledge both in their school studies and also at the company. The intern is expected to bring ideas and knowledge from school into the company.
* Work research, virtual research (graduation) or dissertation: This is mostly done by students who are in their final year of school. With this kind of internship, a student does research for a particular company. The company can have something that they feel they need to improve, or the student can choose a topic in the company themselves. The results of the research study will be put in a report and often will have to be presented.
* Unpaid internships are typically through non-profit charities and think tanks which often have unpaid or volunteer positions. State law and state enforcement agencies may impose requirements on unpaid internship programs under Minimum Wage Act. A program must meet criteria to be properly classified as an unpaid internship. Part of this requirement is proving that the intern is the primary beneficiary of the relationship. Unpaid interns perform work that is not routine and work that company doesn&#x27;t depend upon. 
* Partially-paid internships is when students are paid in the form of a stipend. Stipends are typically a fixed amount of money that is paid out on a regular basis. Usually, interns that are paid with stipends are paid on a set schedule associated with the organization.
*Virtual Internship are internships that are done remotely on email, phone, and web communication. This offers flexibility as physical presence isn&#x27;t required. It still provides the capacity to gain job experience without the conventional requirement of being physically present in an office. Virtual interns generally have the opportunity to work at their own pace.
*International Internships are internships done in a country other than the one that the country of residence. These internships can either be in person or done remotely. Van Mol analyzed employer perspectives on study abroad versus international internships in 31 European countries, finding that employers value international internships more than international study, while Predovic, Dennis and Jones found that international internships developed cognitive skills like how new information is learned and the motivation to learn.
*Returnship are internships for experienced workers who are looking to return to the workforce after taking time away to care for parents or children. 
=== Internship for a fee ===

Companies in search of interns often find and place students in mostly unpaid internships, for a fee. These companies charge students to assist with research, promising to refund the fee if no internship is found. The programs vary and aim to provide internship placements at reputable companies. Some companies may also provide controlled housing in a new city, mentorship, support, networking, weekend activities or academic credit. Some programs offer extra add-ons such as language classes, networking events, local excursions, and other academic options. 

Some companies specifically fund scholarships and grants for low-income applicants. Critics of internships criticize the practice of requiring certain college credits to be obtained only through unpaid internships. Depending on the cost of the school, this is often seen as an unethical practice, as it requires students to exchange paid-for and often limited tuition credits to work an uncompensated job. Paying for academic credits is a way to ensure students complete the duration of the internship, since they can be held accountable by their academic institution. For example, a student may be awarded academic credit only after their university receives a positive review from the intern&#x27;s supervisor at the sponsoring organization.

===Secondary level work experience===
Work experience in England was established in the 1970s by Jack Pidcock, Principal Careers Officer of Manchester Careers Service. The Service organized two weeks work experience for all Year 10 pupils in Manchester Local Education Authority schools, including those for pupils with special educational needs.
Ironically, it was initially resisted by trade unions, and at first he had a job convincing schools, until eventually he persuaded the L.E.A. and councilors to go ahead. It became highly valued by pupils, teachers, inspectors, employers and politicians. 
Work experience provided a taste of the requirements and disciplines of work and an insight into possible vocational choices. 
It ran alongside professional, individual, impartial, face to face careers guidance by local careers advisers.
A Conservative Government introduced the Education (Work Experience) Act 1973 which enabled all education authorities ‘to arrange for children under school-leaving age to have work experience, as part of their education’.
The Conservative Liberal coalition government abolished compulsory work experience for students in England at key stage 4 (Years 10 to 11 for 14-16 years olds) in 2012.
Recently a number of non-governmental and employer led bodies have become critical of pupils and students not understanding the ‘world of work’. 
Work experience is no longer offered on the national curriculum for students in years 10 and 11 in the United Kingdom. but is available for (3rd and 4th year in Scotland), Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland; every student who wishes to do so has a statutory right to take work experience. In 2011, however, the Wolf Review of Vocational Education proposed a significant policy change that—to reflect the fact that almost all students now stay past the age of 16—the requirement for pre-16 work experience in the UK should be removed. Work experience in this context is when students in an adult working environment more or less act as an employee, but with the emphasis on learning about the world of work. Placements are limited by safety and security restrictions, insurance cover and availability, and do not necessarily reflect eventual career choice but instead allow a broad experience of the world of work.

Most students do not get paid for work experience. However, some employers pay students, as this is considered part of their education. The duration varies according to the student&#x27;s course, and other personal circumstances. Most students go out on work experience for one or two weeks in a year. Some students work in a particular workplace, perhaps one or two days a week for extended periods of time throughout the year—either for vocation reasons and commitment to alternative curricula or because they have social or behavioral problems.

===University level work experience===

At university level, work experience is often offered between the second and final years of an undergraduate degree course, especially in the science, engineering and computing fields. Courses of this nature are often called &quot;sandwich courses&quot;, with the work experience year itself known as the &quot;sandwich year&quot;. During this time, the students on work placement have the opportunity to use the skills and knowledge gained in their first two years, and see how they are applied to real world problems. This offers them useful insights for their final year and prepares them for the job market once their course has finished. Some companies sponsor students in their final year at university with the promise of a job at the end of the course. This is an incentive for the student to perform well during the placement as it helps with two otherwise unwelcome stresses: the lack of money in the final year, and finding a job when the university course ends.

<doc id="298222" wikidata="Q1146771" url="?curid=298222" title="Gefilte fish">
<text>Gefilte fish (; from , , lit. &quot;stuffed fish&quot;) is a dish made from a poached mixture of ground deboned fish, such as carp, whitefish, or pike. It is traditionally served as an appetizer by Ashkenazi Jewish households. Popular on Shabbat and Jewish holidays such as Passover, it may be consumed throughout the year. It is typically garnished with a slice of cooked carrot on top.

Historically, gefilte fish was a stuffed whole fish consisting of minced-fish forcemeat stuffed inside the intact fish skin. By the 16th century, cooks had started omitting the labor-intensive stuffing step, and the seasoned fish was most commonly formed into patties similar to &quot;quenelles&quot; or fish balls.

In Poland, gefilte fish is referred to as (&quot;carp Jewish-style&quot;).

==Origins==
Gefilte fish likely originated in non-Jewish, German cooking. The earliest historical reference to &quot;gefuelten hechden&quot; (stuffed pikes) comes from &quot;Daz Buoch von Guoter Spise&quot; (&quot;The Book of Good Food&quot;), a Middle High German cookbook dating to circa 1350 CE. &quot;Gefuelten hechden&quot; consisted of poached and mashed pike that was flavored with herbs and seeds, stuffed back inside the fish skin, and then roasted. This dish was popular with German Catholics during Lent, when it is forbidden to eat meat. By the Middle Ages, stuffed fish had migrated into the cuisine of German and Eastern European Jews.

==Preparation and serving==

Gefilte fish was traditionally cooked inside the intact skin of a fish, forming a loaf which is then sliced into portions before serving. More commonly, it is now most often cooked and served as oval patties, like quenelles. In the United Kingdom, gefilte fish is commonly fried. Gefilte fish is typically garnished with a slice of carrot on top, and a horseradish mixture called chrain on the side.

To make the modernized &quot;gefilte fish&quot; fish balls, fish fillets are ground and mixed with eggs (some recipes exclude eggs), breadcrumbs or matza crumbs, spices, salt, onions, carrots, and sometimes potatoes, to produce a paste or dough which is then simmered in fish stock.

Carp, pike, mullet, or whitefish are commonly used to make gefilte fish; more recently, Nile perch and salmon are also used, with gefilte fish made from salmon having a slightly pink hue. Catfish is not used, however, because it is not kosher.

==&quot;Gefilte Fish Line&quot;==
Gefilte fish may be slightly sweet or savory. Different preparations and taste preferences may be a proxy for reflecting Ashkenazi Jews&#x27; specific ancestral origins in Europe. The preference for sweet gefilte with sugar was popular among Galician Jews from central Europe, while gefilte fish with black pepper was preferred by the more northern Litvak Jews. The boundary separating the two camps was dubbed &quot;the Gefilte Fish Line&quot; by Yiddish linguist Marvin Herzog in the mid-1960s.

Sweet gefilte fish with sugar in Galicia can be traced to the turn of the 19th century, when the first sugar beet factory opened in southern Poland. The sugar industry, which involved many Jews, grew rapidly, and sugar was included in many foods in the region. Culinary historian Gil Marks quipped that, &#x27;&quot;Other Jews had savory noodle kugels. You didn&#x27;t have sweet challah. The idea of putting sugar into anything else was absurd.&quot; But Polish Jews began to put sugar into all of these dishes. Previously peppery kugels. The now-sweet-and-sour stuffed cabbage. And gefilte fish.&#x27;

==Ready-to-serve==

The late 1930s brought a brand named Mother&#x27;s from &quot;Sidney Leibner, the son of a fish store owner.&quot; This ready-to-serve fish was followed by &quot;Manischewitz, Mrs. Adler’s, Rokeach and others.&quot;

The post-WWII method of making gefilte fish commercially takes the form of patties or balls, or utilizes a wax paper casing around a &quot;log&quot; of ground fish, which is then poached or baked. This product is sold in cans and glass jars, and packed in jelly made from fish broth, or the fish broth itself. The sodium content is relatively high at 220–290 mg/serving. Low-salt, low-carbohydrate, low-cholesterol, and sugar-free varieties are available. The patent for this jelly, which allowed mass-market distribution of gefilte fish, was granted on October 29, 1963, to Monroe Nash and Erich G. Freudenstein. 

Gefilte fish has been described as &quot;an acquired taste&quot;.

Grocery stores also sell frozen &quot;logs&quot; of gefilte fish.

==Religious customs and considerations==

===Jewish===
Among religiously observant Jews, gefilte fish has become a traditional Shabbat food to avoid &quot;borer&quot;, which is one of the 39 activities prohibited on Shabbat outlined in the Shulchan Aruch. &quot;Borer&quot;, literally &quot;selection/choosing&quot;, would occur when one picks the bones out of the fish, taking &quot;the chaff from within the food&quot;.

A less common belief is that fish are not subject to &quot;ayin ra&#x27;a&quot; (&quot;evil eye&quot;) because they are submerged while alive, so that a dish prepared from several fish varieties brings good luck. Moreover, because submersion in the water protects the fish from the evil eye, in the Middle East, fish &quot;became popular for amulets and miscellaneous good luck charms. In Eastern Europe, it even became a name, Fishel, an optimistic reflection that the boy would be lucky and protected.&quot;

Gefilte fish is often eaten on the Sabbath. However, on Sabbath, separating bones from meat, as well as cooking, are forbidden by rabbinical law. So usually, the dish is prepared the day before and served cold or at room temperature. With gefilte fish being a Sabbath dinner staple, and the commandment in Genesis for fish to be &quot;fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas&quot;, fish at Sabbath meals took on the patina of an aphrodisiac, the sages believing that &quot;the intoxicating [fish] odor on the Sabbath table would encourage couples to &#x27;be fruitful and multiply&#x27;—which in Jewish tradition is encouraged on Friday night.&quot; Moreover, &quot;dag&quot;, the Hebrew word for fish, has the numerical value of seven, the day of the Sabbath, further underscoring the serving of fish on that day. However, since Jewish law forbids the separating of the flesh of fish from its bones, pre-made fish cakes such as gefilte fish obviate the need to perform such separation, thus making a preparation such as gefilte fish a regular Sabbath staple, and the perfect vehicle for the requisite fish aphrodisiac.

===Catholic===
In Polish Catholic homes (more commonly in the northern regions near the Baltic Sea), gefilte fish () is a traditional dish to be eaten on Christmas Eve (for twelve-dish supper) and Holy Saturday, as these are traditionally meatless feasts. This follows a pattern in which a number of Jewish non-meat dishes were also eaten on Catholic religious days in Poland.

<text>Glassblowing is a glassforming technique that involves inflating molten glass into a bubble (or parison) with the aid of a blowpipe (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a &quot;glassblower&quot;, &quot;glassmith&quot;, or &quot;gaffer&quot;. A &quot;lampworker&quot; (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of borosilicate glass.

==Technology==
===Principles===

As a novel glass forming technique created in the middle of the 1st century BC, glassblowing exploited a working property of glass that was previously unknown to glassworkers; inflation, which is the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air into it. That is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network, therefore molten glass is viscous enough to be blown and gradually hardens as it loses heat.

To increase the stiffness of the molten glass, which in turn makes the process of blowing easier, there was a subtle change in the composition of glass. With reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from Sepphoris. postulated that the concentration of natron, which acts as flux in glass, is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting. Lower concentration of natron would have allowed the glass to be stiffer for blowing.

During blowing, thinner layers of glass cool faster than thicker ones and become more viscous than the thicker layers. That allows production of blown glass with uniform thickness instead of causing blow-through of the thinned layers.

A full range of glassblowing techniques was developed within decades of its invention. The two major methods of glassblowing are free-blowing and mold-blowing.

====Free-blowing====

This method held a pre-eminent position in glassforming ever since its introduction in the middle of the 1st century BC until the late 19th century, and is still widely used as a glassforming technique, especially for artistic purposes. The process of free-blowing involves the blowing of short puffs of air into a molten portion of glass called a &quot;gather&quot; which has been spooled at one end of the blowpipe. This has the effect of forming an elastic skin on the interior of the glass blob that matches the exterior skin caused by the removal of heat from the furnace. The glassworker can then quickly inflate the molten glass to a coherent blob and work it into a desired shape.

Researchers at the Toledo Museum of Art attempted to reconstruct the ancient free-blowing technique by using clay blowpipes. The result proved that short clay blowpipes of about facilitate free-blowing because they are simple to handle and to manipulate and can be re-used several times. Skilled workers are capable of shaping almost any vessel forms by rotating the pipe, swinging it and controlling the temperature of the piece while they blow. They can produce a great variety of glass objects, ranging from drinking cups to window glass.

An outstanding example of the free-blowing technique is the Portland Vase, which is a cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment was carried out by Gudenrath and Whitehouse with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for the body of the vase was gathered on the end of the blowpipe and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot white glass. Inflation occurred when the glassworker blew the molten glass into a sphere which was then stretched or elongated into a vase with a layer of white glass overlying the blue body.

====Mold-blowing====

Mold-blowing was an alternative glassblowing method that came after the invention of free-blowing, during the first part of the second quarter of the 1st century AD. A glob of molten glass is placed on the end of the blowpipe, and is then inflated into a wooden or metal carved mold. In that way, the shape and the texture of the bubble of glass is determined by the design on the interior of the mold rather than the skill of the glassworker.

Two types of mold, namely single-piece molds and multi-piece molds, are frequently used to produce mold-blown vessels. The former allows the finished glass object to be removed in one movement by pulling it upwards from the single-piece mold and is largely employed to produce tableware and utilitarian vessels for storage and transportation. Whereas the latter is made in multi-paneled mold segments that join together, thus permitting the development of more sophisticated surface modeling, texture and design.

The Roman leaf beaker which is now on display in the J. Paul Getty Museum was blown in a three-part mold decorated with the foliage relief frieze of four vertical plants. Meanwhile, Taylor and Hill tried to reproduce mold-blown vessels by using three-part molds made of different materials. The result suggested that metal molds, in particular bronze, are more effective in producing high-relief design on glass than plaster or wooden molds.

The development of the mold-blowing technique has enabled the speedy production of glass objects in large quantity, thus encouraging the mass production and widespread distribution of glass objects.

===Modern glassblowing===

The transformation of raw materials into glass takes place at around ; the glass emits enough heat to appear almost white hot. The glass is then left to &quot;fine out&quot; (allowing the bubbles to rise out of the mass), and then the working temperature is reduced in the furnace to around . At this stage, the glass appears to be a bright orange color. Though most glassblowing is done between , &quot;soda-lime&quot; glass remains somewhat plastic and workable at as low as . Annealing is usually done between .
Glassblowing involves three furnaces. The first, which contains a crucible of molten glass, is simply referred to as &quot;the furnace&quot;. The second is called the &quot;glory hole&quot;, and is used to reheat a piece in between steps of working with it. The final furnace is called the &quot;lehr&quot; or &quot;annealer&quot;, and is used to slowly cool the glass, over a period of a few hours to a few days, depending on the size of the pieces. This keeps the glass from cracking or shattering due to thermal stress. Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes.

=== Tools ===

The major tools used by a glassblower are the blowpipe (or blow tube), &quot;punty&quot; (or punty rod, pontil, or mandrel), bench, marver, blocks, jacks, paddles, tweezers, newspaper pads, and a variety of shears.

==== Blowpipe ====
The tip of the blowpipe is first preheated; then dipped in the molten glass in the furnace. The molten glass is &quot;gathered&quot; onto the end of the blowpipe in much the same way that viscous honey is picked up on a honey dipper. This glass is then rolled on the marver, which was traditionally a flat slab of marble, but today is more commonly a fairly thick flat sheet of steel. This process, called &quot;marvering&quot;, forms a cool skin on the exterior of the molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating a bubble. Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a piece has been blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass is attached to a stainless steel or iron rod called a &quot;punty&quot; for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from the blowpipe to provide an opening and to finalize the top.

==== Bench ====
The &quot;bench&quot; is a glassblower&#x27;s workstation; it includes places for the glassblower to sit, for the handheld tools, and two rails that the pipe or punty rides on while the blower works with the piece.

==== Blocks ====
&quot;Blocks&quot; are ladle-like tools made from water-soaked fruitwood, and are used similarly to the marver to shape and cool a piece in the early steps of creation. In similar fashion, pads of water-soaked newspaper (roughly square, thick), held in the bare hand, can be used to shape the piece.

==== Jacks ====
&quot;Jacks&quot; are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming shape later in the creation of a piece. &quot;Paddles&quot; are flat pieces of wood or graphite used for creating flat spots such as a bottom. Tweezers are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important types of shears, straight shears and diamond shears. Straight shears are essentially bulky scissors, used for making linear cuts. Diamond shears have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are used for cutting off masses of glass.

=== Patterning ===
There are many ways to apply patterns and color to blown glass, including rolling molten glass in powdered color or larger pieces of colored glass called &quot;frit&quot;. Complex patterns with great detail can be created through the use of cane (rods of colored glass) and murrine (rods cut in cross-sections to reveal patterns). These pieces of color can be arranged in a pattern on a flat surface, and then &quot;picked up&quot; by rolling a bubble of molten glass over them. One of the most exacting and complicated caneworking techniques is &quot;reticello&quot;, which involves creating two bubbles from cane, each twisted in a different direction and then combining them and blowing out the final form.

Lampworkers, usually but not necessarily work on a much smaller scale, historically using alcohol lamps and breath- or bellows-driven air to create a hot flame at a workbench to manipulate preformed glass rods and tubes. These stock materials took form as laboratory glassware, beads, and durable scientific &quot;specimens&quot;—miniature glass sculpture. The craft, which was raised to an art form in the late 1960s by Hans Godo Frabel (later followed by lampwork artists such as Milon Townsend and Robert Mickelson), is still practiced today. The modern lampworker uses a flame of oxygen and propane or natural gas. The modern torch permits working both the soft glass from the furnace worker and the borosilicate glass (low-expansion) of the scientific glassblower. This latter worker may also have multiple headed torches and special lathes to help form the glass or fused quartz used for special projects.

==History==
===Earliest evidence===
Glassblowing was invented by Syrian craftsmen from Hama and Aleppo between 27 BC and 14 AD. The ancient Romans copied the technique consisting of blowing air into molten glass with a blowpipe making it into a bubble.

Hence, tube blowing not only represents the initial attempts of experimentation by glassworkers at blowing glass, it is also a revolutionary step that induced a change in conception and a deep understanding of glass. Such inventions swiftly eclipsed all other traditional methods, such as casting and core-forming, in working glass.

Evidence of glass blowing comes even earlier from the Indian subcontinent in the form of Indo-Pacific beads which uses glass blowing to make cavity before being subjected to tube drawn technique for bead making dated more than 2500 BP. Beads are made by attaching molten glass gather to the end of a blowpipe, a bubble is then blown into the gather.

===Roman Empire===

The invention of glassblowing coincided with the establishment of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC, which enhanced the spread and dominance of this new technology. Glassblowing was greatly supported by the Roman government (although Roman citizens could not be &quot;in trade&quot;, in particular under the reign of Augustus), and glass was being blown in many areas of the Roman world. On the eastern borders of the Empire, the first large glass workshops were set up by the Phoenicians in the birthplace of glassblowing in contemporary Lebanon and Israel as well as in the neighbouring province of Cyprus.

Ennion for example, was among the most prominent glassworkers from Lebanon of the time. He was renowned for producing the multi-paneled mold-blown glass vessels that were complex in their shapes, arrangement and decorative motifs. The complexity of designs of these mold-blown glass vessels illustrated the sophistication of the glassworkers in the eastern regions of the Roman Empire. Mold-blown glass vessels manufactured by the workshops of Ennion and other contemporary glassworkers such as Jason, Nikon, Aristeas, and Meges, constitutes some of the earliest evidence of glassblowing found in the eastern territories.

Eventually, the glassblowing technique reached Egypt and was described in a fragmentary poem printed on papyrus which was dated to the 3rd century AD. The Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean areas resulted in the substitution of glassblowing for earlier Hellenistic casting, core-forming and mosaic fusion techniques. The earliest evidence of blowing in Hellenistic work consists of small blown bottles for perfume and oil retrieved from the glass workshops on the Greek island of Samothrace and at Corinth in mainland Greece which were dated to the 1st century AD.

Later, the Phoenician glassworkers exploited their glassblowing techniques and set up their workshops in the western territories of the Roman Empire, first in Italy by the middle of the 1st century AD. Rome, the heartland of the empire, soon became a major glassblowing center, and more glassblowing workshops were subsequently established in other provinces of Italy, for example Campania, Morgantina and Aquileia. A great variety of blown glass objects, ranging from unguentaria (toiletry containers for perfume) to cameo, from tableware to window glass, were produced.

From there, escaping craftsmen (who had been forbidden to travel) otherwise advanced to the rest of Europe by building their glassblowing workshops in the north of the Alps (which is now Switzerland), and then at sites in northern Europe in present-day France and Belgium.

One of the most prolific glassblowing centers of the Roman period was established in Cologne on the river Rhine in Germany by the late 1st century BC. Stone base molds and terracotta base molds were discovered from these Rhineland workshops, suggesting the adoption and the application of mold-blowing technique by the glassworkers. Besides, blown flagons and blown jars decorated with ribbing, as well as blown perfume bottles with letters CCAA or CCA which stand for Colonia Claudia Agrippiniensis, were produced from the Rhineland workshops. Remains of blown blue-green glass vessels, for example bottles with handles, collared bowls and indented beakers, were found in abundance from the local glass workshops at Poetovio and Celeia in Slovenia.

Surviving physical evidence, such as blowpipes and molds which are indicative of the presence of blowing, is fragmentary and limited. Pieces of clay blowpipes were retrieved from the late 1st century AD glass workshop at Avenches in Switzerland. Clay blowpipes, also known as mouthblowers, were made by the ancient glassworkers due to the accessibility and availability of the resources before the introduction of the metal blowpipes. Hollow iron rods, together with blown vessel fragments and glass waste dating to approximately 4th century AD, were recovered from the glass workshop in Mérida of Spain, as well as in Salona in Croatia.

===Middle Ages===
The glass blowing tradition was carried on in Europe from the medieval period through the Middle Ages to the Renaissance in the demise of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. During the early medieval period, the Franks manipulated the technique of glassblowing by creating the simple corrugated molds and developing the claws decoration techniques. Blown glass objects, such as the drinking vessels that imitated the shape of the animal horn were produced in the Rhine and Meuse valleys, as well as in Belgium. The Byzantine glassworkers made mold-blown glass decorated with Christian and Jewish symbols in Jerusalem between the late 6th century and the middle of the 7th century AD. Mold-blown vessels with facets, relief and linear-cut decoration were discovered at Samarra in the Islamic lands.

Renaissance Europe witnessed the revitalization of glass industry in Italy. Glassblowing, in particular the mold-blowing technique, was employed by the Venetian glassworkers from Murano to produce the fine glassware which is also known as &quot;cristallo&quot;. The technique of glassblowing, coupled with the cylinder and crown methods, was used to manufacture sheet or flat glass for window panes in the late 17th century. The applicability of glassblowing was so widespread that glass was being blown in many parts of the world, for example, in China, Japan and the Islamic Lands.

The Nøstetangen Museum at Hokksund, Norway, shows how glass was made according to ancient tradition. The Nøstetangen glassworks had operated there from 1741 to 1777, producing table-glass and chandeliers in the German and English styles.

===Industrial Revolution===
===Recent developments===
The &quot;studio glass movement&quot; began in 1962 when Harvey Littleton, a ceramics professor, and Dominick Labino, a chemist and engineer, held two workshops at the Toledo Museum of Art, during which they started experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art. Littleton promoted the use of small furnaces in individual artists&#x27; studios. This approach to glassblowing blossomed into a worldwide movement, producing such flamboyant and prolific artists as Dale Chihuly, Dante Marioni, Fritz Driesbach and Marvin Lipofsky as well as scores of other modern glass artists. Today there are many different institutions around the world that offer glassmaking resources for training and sharing equipment.

Working with large or complex pieces requires a team of several glassworkers, in a complex choreography of precisely timed movements. This practical requirement has encouraged collaboration among glass artists, in both semi-permanent and temporary working groups.

In addition, recent developments in technology allow for the use of glass components in high-tech applications. Using machininery to shape and form glass enables to manufacture glass products of the highest quality and accuracy. As a result, glass is often used in semiconductor, analytical, life science, industrial, and medical applications.

===In literature===
The writer Daphne du Maurier was descended from a family of glass-blowers in 18th century France, and she wrote about her forebears in the 1963 historical novel &quot;The Glass-Blowers&quot;.

The subject of mystery novelist Donna Leon&#x27;s &quot;Through a Glass, Darkly&quot; is the investigation of a crime in a Venetian glassworks on the island of Murano.

<text>Scarsdale is a town in Westchester County, New York, United States. The Town of Scarsdale is coextensive with the Village of Scarsdale, but the community has opted to operate solely with a village government, one of several villages in the state that have a similar governmental situation. As of the 2020 census, Scarsdale&#x27;s population was 18,253.

==History==

===Colonial era===
Caleb Heathcote purchased land that would become Scarsdale at the end of the 17th century and, on March 21, 1701, had it elevated to a royal manor. He named the lands after his ancestral home in Derbyshire, England. The first local census of 1712 counted twelve inhabitants, including seven African slaves. When Caleb died in 1721, his daughters inherited the property. The estate was broken up in 1774, and the town was officially founded on March 7, 1788.

The town saw fighting during the American Revolution when the Continental and British armies clashed briefly at what is now the junction of Garden Road and Mamaroneck Road. The British commander, Sir William Howe, lodged at a farmhouse on Garden Road that remains standing. Scarsdale&#x27;s wartime history formed the basis for James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s 1821 novel, &quot;The Spy: A Tale of the Neutral Ground&quot;, written while the author lived at the Angevine Farm in the present-day Heathcote section of town.

===1790–1945===
According to the first federal census in 1790, the town&#x27;s population was 281. By 1840, that number had declined to 255—the vast majority farmers and farm workers. In 1846, the New York and Harlem Railroad connected Scarsdale to New York City, leading to an influx of commuters.

The Arthur Suburban Home Company purchased a farm in 1891 and converted it into a subdevelopment of one-family dwellings, starting a transformation of the community from rural to suburban. Civil institutions soon appeared: the Heathcote Association (1904), the Town Club (1904), the Scarsdale Woman&#x27;s Club (1918) and the Scarsdale League of Women Voters (1921). Scarsdale High School and Greenacres Elementary School were built in 1912, and the Edgewood Elementary School opened in 1918. The first store in Scarsdale opened on the corner of Popham Road and Garth Road in 1912. By 1915, the population approached 3000. By 1930, that number approached 10,000.

In 1940, Nazi agent Gerhardt Alois Westrick secretly met with American business leaders at his Scarsdale home until public pressure—a reaction to articles in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; produced by British Security Coordination in New York—drove his family from the community. He was subsequently deported for pursuing activities unfriendly to the United States.

===1945–present===

Scarsdale became the subject of national controversy in the 1950s when a &quot;Committee of Ten&quot; led by Otto Dohrenwend alleged &quot;Communist infiltration&quot; in the public schools. A thorough investigation by the town rejected these claims. This same group, known as the Scarsdale Citizens Committee, sued to prevent a benefit for the Freedom Riders from taking place at the public high school in 1963 because some of the performers (Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Pete Seeger) were allegedly &quot;communist sympathizers and subversives.&quot;

Another controversy enveloped the town in 1961, when the Scarsdale Golf Club, headed by Charles S. McCallister, refused to allow a young man who had converted from Judaism into the Episcopal Church, Michael Cunningham Hernstadt, to escort a young woman, Pamela Nottage, to her debut at the club. At the time, it was the club&#x27;s policy to prohibit Jews from the premises. In response, the Rev. George French Kempsell of the Church of Saint James the Less announced that he would ban any supporters of the club&#x27;s decision from receiving Holy Communion. The event marked a turning point toward the decline of anti-Semitism in the town.

Scarsdale&#x27;s public library, which had been housed in historic Wayside Cottage since 1928, moved to its present structure on the White Plains Post Road in 1951. The driving force behind the library was New York City publisher S. Spencer Scott, who raised $100,000 for the project after the village rejected a bond issue to fund the building in 1938. The new library opened with 27,000 books and Sylvia C. Hilton serving as the first librarian.

The last of the town&#x27;s five elementary schools, Heathcote School, opened in September 1953. The $1,000,000 architectural landmark was designed by Perkins &amp; Will of Chicago. Walter B. Cocking, the president of the New York State Committee for the Public Schools, delivered the dedication address.

In 1967, U.S. Secretary of State and former longtime resident Dean Rusk returned to Scarsdale at the height of the Vietnam War to receive the town&#x27;s Man of the Year Award and was greeted with a silent protest.

Scarsdale was the subject of a landmark United States Supreme Court decision, &quot;ACLU v. Scarsdale&quot; (1985), that established the so-called &quot;reindeer rule&quot; regarding public nativity scenes and upheld the right of local religious groups to place crèches on public property.

Scarsdale was involved in another United States Supreme Court case in 1985, &quot;Board of Trustees of Scarsdale v. McCreary&quot;, concerning the display of privately sponsored nativity scenes on public property.

On January 1, 2022, the village of Scarsdale banned the sale of all tobacco and cannabis products as well as smoking on public property for people of all ages. After the 60 day grace period, a 100 dollar fine will be imposed by law enforcement on violators.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which 0.12% is water. It is located approximately 7 miles to the border of New York City (in The Bronx), 11 miles from the northern tip of Manhattan, and 20 miles from Midtown Manhattan, which may be reached by Metro-North Railroad express train in approximately 30 minutes.

===Climate===
The town is in a humid continental climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Dfa), with cold, snowy winters and hot, humid summers and four distinct seasons. Scarsdale is just within the hardiness zone 7a, along with New York City and Long Island in New York state, with temperatures below 0 degrees Fahrenheit being rare.

===Neighborhoods===
Scarsdale is divided into five neighborhoods, which correspond to the public elementary schools: Greenacres, Fox Meadow, Heathcote, Quaker Ridge, and Edgewood.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 census, there were 18,253 people and 5,510 households in the village. The population density was . There were 5,747 housing units at an average density of 861.0 per square mile (332.4/km2). The racial makeup of the village was 68.5% White, 1.3% Black or African American, 0.1% Native American, 21.0% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 1.4% from other races, and 7.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.1% of the population.

There were 5,510 households, out of which 53.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them. 81.2% were married couples living together, 1.1% were cohabitating unmarried couples, 5.7% had a male householder with no spouse or partner present, and 11.9% had a female householder with no spouse or partner present. 9.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.31.

The population was 31.0% under the age of 18 and 14.7% 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. The population was 51% female and 49% male.

As of the 2022 U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS), the estimated median household income in the village was over $250,000 and the average household income was $568,942. 90% of the population 25 years and over had a Bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. 2.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.4% of those under age 18 and 2.9% of those aged 65 or over. The poverty rate was 2.2% for males and 3.6% for females. 80% of the civilian employed population over 16 years of age had management, business, science, and arts occupations.

25% of the population was foreign-born, of which 55% were naturalized U.S. citizens. 44% of the foreign-born population was from Asia, and 31% was from Europe.

===Ethnic groups===

As of 2000 Scarsdale was a favorite location for Japanese expatriates working in the US. According to Lisa W. Foderaro of &quot;The New York Times&quot; it was well known in Japan as a place with good housing stock and schools. By 1991, many Japanese businesspeople with work assignments in New York City chose to move &quot;en masse&quot; to Scarsdale. The large settlement of Japanese caused friction among the American population, particularly students at Scarsdale High School. The Japanese residents were unable to take part in much of the town political sphere partly because they were not citizens and partly due to lack of familiarity with American politics. Many Japanese businesses appeared to cater to the community.

Scarsdale has a large and active Jewish population, and there also are burgeoning communities of Indians, Chinese and others.

==Arts and culture==
===Library===

The library is one of 38 public libraries in the Westchester Library System. The 25,000 square foot library building houses a collection of over 147,000 books and audiovisual materials.

==Government==
Scarsdale selects its Board of Trustees using a nonpartisan system that dates back to 1911. Candidates for office are privately interviewed by a diversely composed committee and then nominated for office. New York State law mandates that these nominees must be democratically elected; however, nominated candidates are rarely contested in the general election. The coordinating Scarsdale Citizens&#x27; Non-Partisan Party states &quot;The Scarsdale Citizens&#x27; Non-Partisan Party promotes the election of non-partisan candidates for village mayor, village trustees and village justice. Our local non-partisan system encourages cooperative, deliberative and open civic government to attract highly qualified individuals to public service.&quot;.

==Education==
The Scarsdale Union Free School District operates five elementary schools serving families from different areas of the town: Edgewood, Fox Meadow, Greenacres, Heathcote and Quaker Ridge. It also operates Scarsdale Middle School and Scarsdale High School. Heathcote Elementary School received the National Blue Ribbon Award in 2020 and Scarsdale High School received it in 1983.

The French-American School of New York (FASNY) has its preschool campus in Scarsdale.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York operates Catholic schools in Westchester County.

<text>A necktie, or simply a tie, is a piece of cloth worn for decorative purposes around the neck, resting under the shirt collar and knotted at the throat, and often draped down the chest.

Variants include the ascot, bow, bolo, zipper tie, cravat, and knit. The modern necktie, ascot, and bow tie are descended from the cravat. Neckties are generally unsized but may be available in a longer size. In some cultures, men and boys wear neckties as part of office attire or formal wear. Women wear them less often. Neckties can also be part of a uniform. Neckties are traditionally worn with the top shirt button fastened, and the tie knot resting between the collar points.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The necktie that spread from Europe traces back to Croatian mercenaries serving in France during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). These mercenaries from the Military Frontier, wearing their traditional small, knotted neckerchiefs, aroused the interest of the Parisians. Because of the difference between the Croatian word for Croats, , and the French word, , the garment gained the name &quot;cravat&quot; ( in French). Louis XIV began wearing a lace cravat around 1646 when he was seven and set the fashion for French nobility. This new article of clothing started a fashion craze in Europe; both men and women wore pieces of fabric around their necks. From its introduction by the French king, men wore lace cravats, or jabots, which took a large amount of time and effort to arrange. These cravats were often tied in place by cravat strings, arranged neatly and tied in a bow.

International Necktie Day is celebrated on October 18 in Croatia and in various cities around the world, including in Dublin, Tübingen, Como, Tokyo, Sydney and other towns.

=== 1710–1800: stocks, solitaires, neckcloths, cravats ===

In 1715, another kind of neckwear, called &quot;stocks&quot; made its appearance. The term originally referred to a leather collar, laced at the back, worn by soldiers to promote holding the head high in a military bearing. The leather stock also afforded some protection to the major blood vessels of the neck from saber or bayonet attacks. General Sherman is seen wearing a leather stock in several American Civil War-era photographs.

Stock ties were initially just a small piece of muslin folded into a narrow band wound a few times around the shirt collar and secured from behind with a pin. It was fashionable for men to wear their hair long, past shoulder length. The ends were tucked into a black silk bag worn at the nape of the neck. This was known as the bag-wig hairstyle, and the neckwear worn with it was the stock.

The solitaire was a variation of the bag wig. This form had matching ribbons stitched around the bag. After the stock was in place, the ribbons would be brought forward and tied in a large bow in front of the wearer.

Sometime in the late 18th century, cravats began to make an appearance again. This can be attributed to a group of young men called the macaronis (as mentioned in the song &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;). These were young Englishmen who returned from Europe and brought with them new ideas about fashion from Italy. The French contemporaries of the macaronis were the &#x27;petits-maîtres&#x27; and incroyables.

=== 1800–1850: cravat, stocks, scarves, bandanas ===

At this time, there was also much interest in the way to tie a proper cravat and this led to a series of publications. This began in 1818 with the publication of &quot;Neckclothitania&quot;, a style manual that contained illustrated instructions on how to tie 14 different cravats. Soon after, the immense skill required to tie the cravat in certain styles quickly became a mark of a man&#x27;s elegance and wealth. It was also the first book to use the word &quot;tie&quot; in association with neckwear.

It was about this time that black stocks made their appearance. Their popularity eclipsed the white cravat, except for formal and evening wear. These remained popular through the 1850s. At this time, another form of neckwear worn was the scarf. This was where a neckerchief or bandana was held in place by slipping the ends through a finger or scarf ring at the neck instead of using a knot. This is the classic sailor neckwear and may have been adopted from them.

=== 1860s–1945: bow ties, scarf/neckerchief, the ascot, the long tie ===

With the Industrial Revolution, more people wanted neckwear that was easy to put on, was comfortable and would last an entire workday. Neckties were designed to be long, thin, and easy to knot, without accidentally coming undone. This is the necktie design still worn by millions.

Academic tailors Castell &amp; Son (Oxford) Limited, which opened in 1846 in Oxford, takes credit for creating the first modern style necktie in 1870.

In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt became the first US president to wear the modern long necktie in a presidential portrait.

By this time, the sometimes complicated array of knots and styles of neckwear gave way to neckties and bow ties, the latter a much smaller, more convenient version of the cravat. Another type of neckwear, the ascot tie, was considered &quot;de rigueur&quot; for male guests at formal dinners and male spectators at races. These ascots had wide flaps that were crossed and pinned together on the chest.

In 1922, a New York tie maker, Jesse Langsdorf, came up with a method of cutting the fabric on the bias and sewing it in three segments. This technique improved elasticity and facilitated the fabric&#x27;s return to its original shape. Since that time, most men have worn the &quot;Langsdorf&quot; tie. Yet another development during that time was the method used to secure the lining and interlining once the tie had been folded into shape.

=== 1945–1995 ===


After the First World War, hand-painted ties became an accepted form of decoration in the U.S. The widths of some of these ties went up to . These loud, flamboyant ties sold very well through the 1950s.

Diagonal (&quot;regimental or &quot;repp&quot;) stripes are a common necktie pattern. In Britain and other Commonwealth countries, these have been used to denote association with a particular military regiment, corps, or service since at least the 1920s, and are also used to represent civic and educational institutions. It is considered inappropriate for persons who are unaffiliated with a regiment, university, school, or other organization, to wear a necktie affiliated with that organization. In Commonwealth countries, necktie stripes commonly run from the left shoulder down to the right side but when Brooks Brothers introduced similar striped ties in the United States, around the beginning of the 20th century, they had their stripes run from the right shoulder to the left side, in part to distinguish them from British regimental striped neckties. Members of the British Royal Family are frequently seen wearing regimental striped ties corresponding to the military unit in which they have served or been appointed to an honorary position such as colonel-in-chief.

Before the Second World War ties were typically worn shorter than they are today. This was due, in part, to men at that time more commonly wearing trousers with a higher rise (at the natural waist, just above the belly button) and waistcoats; i.e., ties could be shorter because trousers sat higher up and, at any rate, the tip of the tie was almost always concealed. Around 1944, ties started to become not only wider but even wilder. This was the beginning of what was later labeled the Bold Look: ties that reflected the returning GIs&#x27; desire to break with wartime uniformity. Widths reached , and designs included Art Deco, hunting scenes, scenic &quot;photographs&quot;, tropical themes, and even girlie prints, though more traditional designs were also available. The typical length was .

The Bold Look lasted until about 1951 when the &quot;Mister T&quot; look (so termed by Esquire magazine) was introduced. The new style, characterized by tapered suits, slimmer lapels, and smaller hat brims, included thinner and not so wild ties. Tie widths slimmed to by 1953 and continued getting thinner up until the mid-1960s; length increased to about as men started wearing their trousers lower, closer to the hips. Through the 1950s, neckties remained somewhat colorful, yet more restrained than in the previous decade. Small geometric shapes were often employed against a solid background (i.e., foulards); diagonal stripes were also popular. By the early 1960s, dark, solid ties became very common, with widths slimming down to as little as .

The 1960s brought about an influx of pop art influenced designs. The first was designed by Michael Fish when he worked at Turnbull &amp; Asser, and was introduced in Britain in 1965; the term Kipper tie was a pun on his name, as well as a reference to the triangular shape of the front of the tie. The exuberance of the styles of the late 1960s and early 1970s gradually gave way to more restrained designs. Ties became wider, returning to their width, sometimes with garish colors and designs. The traditional designs of the 1930s and 1950s, such as those produced by Tootal, reappeared, particularly Paisley patterns. Ties began to be sold along with shirts, and designers slowly began to experiment with bolder colors.

In the 1980s, narrower ties, some as narrow as but more typically wide, became popular again. Into the 1990s, as ties got wider again, increasingly unusual designs became common. Novelty (or joke) ties or deliberately kitschy ties designed to make a statement gained a certain popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. These included ties featuring cartoon characters, commercial products, or pop culture icons, and those made of unusual materials, such as plastic or wood. During this period, with men wearing their trousers at their hips, ties lengthened to .

The number of ties sold in the United States reached a peak of 110 million in the early 1990s.

=== 1995–present ===

During this period, the use of neckties in the workplace underwent a gradual decline. By 2001, the number of ties sold per year in the US had declined to 60 million.

At the start of the 21st century, ties widened to wide, with a broad range of patterns available, from traditional stripes, foulards, and club ties (ties with a crest or design signifying a club, organization, or order) to abstract, themed, and humorous ones. The standard length remains , though other lengths vary from 117 cm to 152 cm. While ties as wide as are still available, ties under wide also became popular, particularly with younger men and the fashion-conscious. In 2008 and 2009 the world of fashion saw a return to narrower ties.

== Types ==
=== Cravat ===

In 1660, in celebration of its hard-fought victory over the Ottoman Empire, a crack regiment from Croatia visited Paris. There, the soldiers were presented as glorious heroes to Louis XIV, a monarch well known for his eye for personal adornment. It so happened that the officers of this regiment were wearing brightly colored handkerchiefs fashioned of silk around their necks. These neckcloths struck the fancy of the king, and he soon made them an insignia of royalty as he created a regiment of Royal Cravattes. The word &quot;cravat&quot; is derived from the —&#x27;in the style of the Croats&#x27;.

=== Four-in-hand ===

The four-in-hand necktie (as distinct from the four-in-hand knot) was fashionable in Great Britain in the 1850s. Early neckties were simple, rectangular cloth strips cut on the square, with square ends. The term &quot;four-in-hand&quot; originally described a carriage with four horses and a driver; later, it also was the name of a London gentlemen&#x27;s club, The Four-in-Hand Driving Company founded in 1856. Some etymologic reports are that carriage drivers knotted their reins with a four-in-hand knot (see below), whilst others claim the carriage drivers wore their scarves knotted &#x27;four-in-hand&#x27;, but, most likely, members of the club began wearing their neckties so knotted, thus making it fashionable. In the latter half of the 19th century, the four-in-hand knot and the four-in-hand necktie were synonymous. As fashion changed from stiff shirt collars to soft, turned-down collars, the four-in-hand necktie knot gained popularity; its sartorial dominance rendered the term &quot;four-in-hand&quot; redundant usage, shortened &quot;long tie&quot; and &quot;tie&quot;.

In 1926, Jesse Langsdorf from New York City introduced ties cut on the bias (US) or cross-grain (UK), allowing the tie to evenly fall from the knot without twisting; this also caused any woven pattern such as stripes to appear diagonally across the tie.

Today, four-in-hand ties are part of men&#x27;s dress clothing in both Western and non-Western societies, particularly for business.

Four-in-hand ties are generally made from silk or polyester and occasionally with cotton. Another material used is wool, usually knitted, common before World War II but not as popular nowadays. More recently, microfiber ties have also appeared; in the 1950s and 1960s, other manmade fabrics, such as Dacron and rayon, were also used, but have fallen into disfavor. Modern ties appear in a wide variety of colors and patterns, notably striped (usually diagonally); club ties (with a small motif repeated regularly all over the tie); foulards (with small geometric shapes on a solid background); paisleys; and solids. Novelty ties featuring icons from popular culture (such as cartoons, actors, or holiday images), sometimes with flashing lights, have enjoyed some popularity since the 1980s.

=== Six- and seven-fold ties ===
A seven-fold tie is an unlined construction variant of the four-in-hand necktie which pre-existed the use of interlining. Its creation at the end of the 19th century is attributed to the Parisian shirtmaker Washington Tremlett for an American customer. A seven-fold tie is constructed completely out of silk. A six-fold tie is a modern alteration of the seven-fold tie. This construction method is more symmetrical than the true seven-fold. It has an interlining which gives it a little more weight and is self-tipped.

=== Skinny tie ===
A skinny tie is a necktie that is narrower than the standard tie and often all-black. Skinny ties have widths of around at their widest, compared to usually for regular ties. Skinny ties were first popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by British bands such as the Beatles and the Kinks, alongside the subculture that embraced such bands, the mods. This is because clothes of the time evolved to become more form-fitting and tailored. They were later repopularized in the late 1970s and early 1980s by new wave and power pop bands such as the Knack, Blondie and Duran Duran.

=== &quot;Pre-tied&quot; ties and development of clip-ons ===

The &quot;pre-tied&quot; necktie, or more commonly, the clip-on necktie, is a permanently knotted four-in-hand or bow tie affixed by a clip or hook. The clip-on tie sees use with children, and in occupations where a traditional necktie might pose a safety hazard to mechanical equipment operators, etc. (see below).

The perceived utility of this development in the history of the style is evidenced by the series of patents issued for various forms of these ties, beginning in the late 19th century, and by the businesses filing these applications and fulfilling a market need for them. For instance, a patent filed by Joseph W. Less of the &quot;One-In-Hand Tie Company&quot; of Clinton, Iowa for &quot;Pre-tied neckties and methods for making the same&quot; noted that:

The inventor proceeded to claim for the invention—the latest version of the 1930s–1950s product line from former concert violinist Joseph Less, Iowan brothers Walter and Louis, and son-in-law W. Emmett Thiessen evolved to be identifiable as the modern clip-on—&quot;a novel method for making up the tie[...] [eliminating] the neckband of the tie, which is useless and uncomfortable in warm weather[...] [and providing] means of attachment which is effective and provides no discomfort to the wearer&quot;, and in doing so achieves &quot;accurate simulation of the Windsor knot, and extremely low material and labor costs&quot;. Notably, the company made use of ordinary ties purchased from the New York garment industry and was a significant employer of women in the pre-war and World War II years.

== Knots ==


There are four main knots used to knot neckties. In rising order of difficulty, they are:

* the four-in-hand knot. The four-in-hand knot may be the most common.
* the Pratt knot (the Shelby knot)
* the half-Windsor knot
* the Windsor knot (also redundantly called the &quot;full Windsor&quot; and the &quot;Double Windsor&quot;).

Although he did not invent it, the Windsor knot is named after the Duke of Windsor. The Duke did favor a voluminous knot; however, he achieved this by having neckties specially made of thicker cloths.

In the late 1990s, two researchers, Thomas Fink and Yong Mao of Cambridge&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory, used mathematical modeling to discover that 85 knots are possible with a conventional tie (limiting the number &quot;moves&quot; used to tie the knot to nine; longer sequences of moves result in too large a knot or leave the hanging ends of the tie too short). The models were published in academic journals, while the results and the 85 knots were published in layman&#x27;s terms in a book entitled &quot;The 85 Ways to Tie a Tie&quot;. Of the 85 knots, Fink and Mao selected 13 knots as &quot;aesthetic&quot; knots, using the qualities of symmetry and balance. Based on these mathematical principles, the researchers came up with not only the four necktie knots in common use, but nine more, some of which had seen limited use, and some that are believed to have been codified for the first time.

Other types of knots include:
* Small knot (also &quot;oriental knot&quot;, &quot;Kent knot&quot;): the smallest possible necktie knot. It forms an equilateral triangle, like the half-Windsor, but much more compact (Fink–Mao notation: Lo Ri Co T, Knot 1). It is also the smallest knot to begin inside-out.
* Nicky knot: an alternative version of the Pratt knot, but better-balanced and self-releasing (Lo Ci Ro Li Co T, Knot 4). Supposedly named for Nikita Khrushchev, it tends to be equally referred to as the Pratt knot in men&#x27;s style literature. This is the version of the Pratt knot favored by Fink and Mao.
* Atlantic knot: a reversed Pratt knot, highlighting the structure of the knot normally hidden on the back. For the wide blade to remain in front and right-side-out, the knot must begin right-side-out, and the thin end must be wrapped around the wide end. (Ri Co Ri Lo Ci T; not cataloged by Fink and Mao, but would be numbered 5 according to their classification.)
* Prince Albert knot (also &quot;double knot&quot;, &quot;cross Victoria knot&quot;): A variant of the four-in-hand with an extra pass of the wide blade around the front, before passing the wide blade through both of the resultant loops (Li Ro Li Ro Li Co T T, Knot 6). A version knotted through only the outermost loop is known as the Victoria knot (Li Ro Li Ro Li Co T, Knot 6).
* Christensen knot (also &quot;cross knot&quot;): An elongated, symmetrical knot, whose main feature is the cruciform structure made by knotting the necktie through the double loop made in the front (Li Ro Ci Lo Ri Lo Ri Co T T, Knot 25). While it can be made with modern neckties, it is most effective with thinner ties of consistent width, which fell out of common use after the 19th century.
* Ediety knot (also &quot;Merovingian knot&quot;): a doubled Atlantic knot, best known as the tie knot worn by the character &quot;the Merovingian&quot; in the 2003 film &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. This tie can be knotted with the thin end over the wide end, as with the Atlantic knot, or with the wide end over the thin end to mimic the look seen in the film, with the narrow blade in front. (Ri Co Ri Lo Ci Ri Co Ri Lo Ci T – not cataloged by Fink and Mao, as its 10 moves exceed their parameters.)
* Trinity knot: This knot was first created by Christopher Johnson in Watertown, WI in 2004. He was inspired by the 2003 film &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. It is relatively easy to tie in spite of its complex look. It is best with a tie that is without taper or flare on the narrow blade. (Tying the thin end over the larger end, it can be described as Li Co Li Ro Ci Lo Ri Co T Li Ro T, with the final through move being like a Ci move. Due to having 11 moves and two through moves, it was not listed by Fink and Mao.)
* Herringbone knot (also &quot;Eldredge knot&quot;): This knot is tied in almost the same process as the Trinity knot, but tends to create more volume to the sides, and is thus most suited to spread or cutaway collars.
* Grantchester knot: A self-releasing, asymmetric knot.

== Ties as a sign of membership ==

The use of coloured and patterned neckties indicating the wearer&#x27;s membership in a club, military regiment, school, professional association (Royal Colleges, Inns of Courts) or other institution, dates only from late-19th century England. The immediate forerunners of today&#x27;s college neckties were in 1880 the oarsmen of Exeter College, Oxford, who tied the bands of their straw hats around their necks.

In the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth countries, neckties are commonly an essential component of a school uniform and are either worn daily, seasonally or on special occasions with the school blazer. In Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand, neckties are worn as the everyday uniform, usually as part of the winter uniform. In countries with no winter such as Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, and many African countries, the necktie is usually worn as part of the formal uniform on special occasions or functions. Neckties may also denote membership in a house or a leadership role (i.e. school prefect, house captain, etc.).

The most common pattern for such ties in the UK and most of Europe consists of diagonal stripes of alternating colors running down the tie from the wearer&#x27;s left. Since neckties are cut on the bias (diagonally), the stripes on the cloth are parallel or perpendicular to the selvage, not diagonal. The colors themselves may be particularly significant. The dark blue and red regimental tie of the Household Division is said to represent the blue blood (i.e. nobility) of the Royal Family, and the red blood of the Guards.

In the United States, diagonally striped ties are commonly worn with no connotation of a group membership. Typically, American striped ties have the stripes running downward from the wearer&#x27;s right (the opposite of the European style). (However, when Americans wear striped ties as a sign of membership, the European stripe style may be used.) In some cases, American &quot;repp stripe&quot; ties may simply be reverse images of British regimental ties. Striped ties are strongly associated with the Ivy League and preppy style of dress.

An alternative membership tie pattern to diagonal stripes is either a single emblem or a crest centered and placed where a tie pin normally would be, or a repeated pattern of such motifs. Sometimes, both types are used by an organization, either simply to offer a choice or to indicate a distinction among levels of membership. Occasionally, a hybrid design is used, in which alternating stripes of color are overlaid with repeated motif patterns.

== Use by women and girls ==
Neckties are sometimes part of uniforms worn by women, which nowadays might be required in professions such as in the restaurant industry or in police forces. In many countries, girls are nowadays required to wear ties as part of primary and secondary school uniforms.

Ties may also be used by women as a fashion statement. During the late 1970s and 1980s, it was not uncommon for young women in the United States to wear ties as part of a casual outfit. This trend was popularized by Diane Keaton, who wore a tie as the titular character in the 1977 film &quot;Annie Hall&quot;.

In 1993, neckties reappeared as prominent fashion accessories for women in both Europe and the U.S. Canadian recording artist Avril Lavigne wore neckties with tank tops early in her career.

== Occasions for neckties ==
Traditionally, ties are a staple of office attire, especially for professionals. Proponents of the tie&#x27;s place in the office assert that ties neatly demarcate work and leisure time.

The theory is that the physical presence of something around your neck serves as a reminder to knuckle down and focus on the job at hand. Conversely, loosening the tie after work signals that one can relax.

Outside of these environments, ties are usually worn especially when attending traditionally formal or professional events, including weddings, important religious ceremonies, funerals, job interviews, court appearances, and fine dining.

== Opposition to neckties ==

=== Christian denominations teaching plain dress ===
Among many Christian denominations teaching the doctrine of plain dress, long neckties are not worn by men; this includes many Anabaptist communities (such as the Conservative Mennonite churches), traditional Quakers (who view neckties as contravening their testimony of simplicity), and some holiness denominations. While Reformed Mennonites, among some other Anabaptist communities, reject the long necktie, the wearing of the bow tie is customary.

=== Anti-necktie sentiment ===

In the early 20th century, the number of office workers began increasing. Many such men and women were required to wear neckties because it was perceived as improving work attitudes, morale, and sales.
Removing the necktie as a social and sartorial business requirement (and sometimes forbidding it) is a modern trend often attributed to the rise of popular culture. Although it was common as everyday wear as late as 1966, over the years 1967–69, the necktie fell out of fashion almost everywhere, except where required. There was a resurgence in the 1980s, but in the 1990s, ties again fell out of favor, with many technology-based companies having casual dress requirements, including Apple, Amazon, eBay, Genentech, Microsoft, Monsanto, and Google.

In western business culture, a phenomenon known as Casual Friday has arisen, in which employees are not required to wear ties on Fridays, and then—increasingly—on other, announced, special days. Some businesses have extended casual dress days to Thursday, and even Wednesday; others require neckties only on Monday (to start the workweek). At the furniture company IKEA, neckties are not allowed.

An example of anti-necktie sentiment is found in Iran, where the government of the Islamic Republic considers neckties to be &quot;decadent, un-Islamic and viewed as &quot;symbols of the Cross&quot; and the oppressive West.&quot; Most Iranian men in Iran have retained the Western-style long-sleeved collared shirt and three-piece suit, while excluding the necktie. While ties are viewed as &quot;highly politicised clothing&quot; in Iran, some Iranian men continue to wear them, as do many Westerners who visit the country.

Neckties are viewed by various sub- and counter-culture movements as being a symbol of submission and slavery (i.e., having a symbolic chain around one&#x27;s neck) to the corrupt elite of society, as a &quot;wage slave&quot;.

For 60 years, designers and manufacturers of neckties in the United States were members of the Men&#x27;s Dress Furnishings Association but the trade group shut down in 2008 as a result of declining membership due to the declining numbers of men wearing neckties.

In 1998 Dutch royal consort Prince Claus removed his tie at a public event, calling on the &quot;tie-wearers of all countries&quot; to unite and cast off the oppression of the tie. The incident gained a lot of media attention.

In 2019, US presidential candidate Andrew Yang drew attention when he appeared on televised presidential debates without a tie. Yang dismissed media questions about it, saying that voters should be focused on more important issues.

New Zealand Member of Parliament Rawiri Waititi has been vocal in his opposition to neckties, calling them a &quot;colonial noose&quot;. In February 2021, he was ejected from Parliament for refusing to wear a tie, drawing attention and parliamentary debate, which ultimately resulted in the requirement being dropped from NZ parliament&#x27;s &quot;appropriate business attire&quot; requirements for males.

Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, believes ties are a symbol of oppression and slavery.

== Health and safety hazards ==
Necktie wearing presents some risks for entanglement, infection, and vasoconstriction. A 2018 study published in the medical journal &quot;Neuroradiology&quot; found that a Windsor knot tightened to the point of &quot;slight discomfort&quot; could interrupt as much as 7.5% of cerebral blood flow. A 2013 study published in the &quot;British Journal of Ophthalmology&quot; found increased intraocular pressure in such cases, which can aggravate the condition of people with weakened retinas. There may be additional risks for people with glaucoma.

Entanglement is a risk when working with machinery or in dangerous, possibly violent, jobs such as police officers and prison guards, and certain medical fields.

Paramedics performing life support remove an injured man&#x27;s necktie as a first step to ensure it does not block his airway. Neckties might also be a health risk for persons other than the wearer. They are believed to be vectors of disease transmission in hospitals. Notwithstanding such fears, many doctors and dentists wear neckties for a professional image. Hospitals take seriously the cross-infection of patients by doctors wearing infected neckties, because neckties are less frequently cleaned than most other clothes. On September 17, 2007, British hospitals published rules banning neckties. In such a context, some instead prefer to use bow ties due to their short length and relative lack of hindrance.

Police officers, traffic wardens, and security guards in the UK wear clip-on ties which instantly unclip when pulled to prevent any risk of strangulation during a confrontation. They are part of the National Framework Contract for the police uniform.

<text>United States Colored Troops (USCT) were Union Army regiments during the American Civil War that primarily comprised African Americans, with soldiers from other ethnic groups also serving in USCT units. Established in response to a demand for more units from Union Army commanders, USCT regiments, which numbered 175 in total by the end of the war in 1865, constituted about one-tenth of the manpower of the army, according to historian Kelly Mezurek, author of &quot;For Their Own Cause: The 27th United States Colored Troops&quot; (The Kent State University Press, 2016). &quot;They served in infantry, artillery, and cavalry.&quot; Approximately 20 percent of USCT soldiers were killed in action or died of disease and other causes, a rate about 35 percent higher than that of white Union troops. Numerous USCT soldiers fought with distinction, with 16 receiving the Medal of Honor. The USCT regiments were precursors to the Buffalo Soldier units which fought in the American Indian Wars.

The courage displayed by colored troops during the Civil War played an important role in African Americans gaining new rights. As Frederick Douglass said in an 1863 speech:
==Background==

===The Confiscation Act===
The U.S. Congress passed the Confiscation Act in July 1862, legalizing the practice of Union officers freeing slaves and putting them to work as army laborers. Congress also passed the Militia Act, which empowered the President to use free blacks and former slaves from the rebel states in any capacity in the army. President Abraham Lincoln was concerned with public opinion in the four border states that remained in the Union, as they had numerous slaveholders, as well as with northern Democrats who supported the war but were less supportive of abolition than many northern Republicans. At first, Lincoln opposed early efforts to recruit African American soldiers, although he accepted the Army using them as paid workers. In September 1862, Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation, announcing that all slaves in rebellious states would be free as of January 1. Recruitment and training of colored regiments began in full force following the Proclamation in January 1863.

==Formation==
The United States War Department issued General Order Number 143 on May 22, 1863, establishing the Bureau of Colored Troops to facilitate the recruitment of African-American soldiers to fight for the Union Army. Regiments, including infantry, cavalry, engineers, light artillery, and heavy artillery units were recruited from all states of the Union. Approximately 175 regiments comprising more than 178,000 free blacks and freedmen served during the last two years of the war. Their service bolstered the Union war effort at a critical time.

Initially, the USCT were relegated to menial jobs such as that of laborers, teamsters, cooks, and other support duties. However, even these duties were essential to the war effort. For example, USCT engineers built Fort Pocahontas, a Union supply depot, in Charles City, Virginia. Eventually USCT were sent into combat.

The USCT suffered 2,751 combat casualties during the war, and 68,178 losses from all causes. Disease caused the most fatalities for all troops, both black and white. In the last year-and-a-half and from all reported casualties, approximately 20% of all African Americans enrolled in the military died. Notably, their mortality rate was significantly higher than white soldiers:


USCT regiments were led by white Union officers, while rank advancement was limited for Black soldiers, who could only rise to the rank of non-commissioned officers. Approximately 110 Black soldiers did become commissioned officers before the end of the war, primarily as surgeons or chaplains. The Supervisory Committee for Recruiting Colored Regiments in Philadelphia opened the Free Military Academy for Applicants for the Command of Colored Troops at the end of 1863. For a time, Black soldiers received less pay than their white counterparts, but they and their supporters lobbied and eventually gained equal pay. Notable members of USCT regiments included Martin Robinson Delany and the sons of abolitionist Frederick Douglass.

The process for white officers aiming to lead USCT units was considered more protracted and perhaps rigorous than for ordinary Union officers. This was because it was assumed that leading Black soldiers would require a better officer than those leading white troops. At the end of their studies, those men who wished to lead Black troops had to pass an examination administered by Brig. Gen. Silas Casey&#x27;s staff in Washington. After a short period of examinations in mid-1863, only half of the men who had taken the exam passed.

===Volunteer regiments===
Before the USCT was formed, several volunteer regiments were raised from free black men, including freedmen in the South. In 1863 a former slave, William Henry Singleton, helped recruit 1,000 former slaves in New Bern, North Carolina, for the First North Carolina Colored Volunteers. He became a sergeant in the 35th USCT. Freedmen from the Roanoke Island Freedmen&#x27;s Colony, established in 1863 on the island, also formed part of the Free North Carolina Colored Volunteers (FNCCV) and subsequently the 35th. Nearly all of the volunteer regiments were converted into USCT units.

In 1922 Singleton published his memoir (in a slave narrative) of his journey from slavery to freedom and becoming a Union soldier. Glad to participate in reunions, years later at the age of 95, he marched in a Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) event in 1938.

===State volunteers===
Six regiments were considered regular units, rather than auxiliaries. Their veteran status allowed them to get federal government jobs after the war, from which African Americans had usually been excluded in earlier years. However, the men received no formal recognition for combat honors and awards until the turn of the 20th century. These units were:
* 5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry
* 54th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment
* 55th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment
* 29th Connecticut (Colored) Volunteer Infantry Regiment
* 30th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry Regiment
* 31st Infantry Regiment (Colored)

===1st Louisiana Native Guard (Corps d&#x27;Afrique)===
The 1st Louisiana Native Guard, one of many Louisiana Union Civil War units, was formed in New Orleans after the city was taken and occupied by Union forces. It was formed in part from the Confederacy&#x27;s former unit of the same name, which had been made up of property-owning free people of color (&quot;gens de couleur libres&quot;). These men had wanted to prove their bravery and loyalty to the Confederacy like other Southern property owners by joining Confederate Black soldiers, but the Confederacy did not allow them to serve and confiscated their arms.

For the new unit, the Union also recruited freedmen from the refugee camps. Liberated from nearby plantations, they and their families had no means to earn a living and no place to go. Local commanders, starved for replacements, started equipping volunteer units with cast-off uniforms and obsolete or captured firearms. The men were treated and paid as auxiliaries, performing guard or picket duties to free up white soldiers for maneuver units. In exchange their families were fed, clothed and housed for free at the Army camps; often schools were set up for them and their children.

Despite class differences between free Black people and freedmen, the troops of the new guard served with distinction, including under Captain Andre Cailloux at the Battle of Port Hudson and throughout the South. Its units included:
* 4 Regiments of Louisiana Native Guards (renamed the 1st–4th Corps d&#x27;Afrique Infantry, later renamed as the 73rd–76th US Colored Infantry on April 4, 1864).
* 1st and 2nd Brigade Marching Bands, Corps d&#x27;Afrique (later made into Nos. 1 and 2 Bands, USCT).
* 1st Regiment of Cavalry (1st Corps d&#x27;Afrique Cavalry, later made into the 4th US Colored Cavalry).
* 22 Regiments of Infantry (1st–20th, 22nd, and 26th Corps d&#x27;Afrique Infantry, later converted into the 77th–79th, 80th–83rd, 84th–88th, and 89th–93rd US Colored Infantry on April 4, 1864).
* 5 Regiments of Engineers (1st–5th Corps d&#x27;Afrique Engineers, later converted into the 95th–99th US Colored Infantry regiments on April 4, 1864) whose work building Bailey&#x27;s Dam saved the Union navy&#x27;s Mississippi River Squadron.
* 1 Regiment of Heavy Artillery (later converted into the 10th US Colored (Heavy) Artillery on May 21, 1864).

===Right Wing, XVI Corps (1864)===

Colored troops served as laborers in the 16th Army Corps&#x27; Quartermaster&#x27;s Department and Pioneer Corps.
* Detachment, Quartermaster&#x27;s Department.
* Pioneer Corps, 1st Division (Mower), 16th Army Corps.
* Pioneer Corps, Cavalry Division (Grierson), 16th Army Corps.

===USCT Regiments===
* 6 Regiments of Cavalry [1st–6th USC Cavalry]
* 1 Regiment of Light Artillery [2nd USC (Light) Artillery]
* 1 Independent USC (Heavy) Artillery Battery
* 13 Heavy Artillery Regiments [1st and 3rd–14th USC (Heavy) Artillery]
* 1 unassigned Company of Infantry [Company A, US Colored Infantry]
* 1 Independent USC Company of Infantry (Southard&#x27;s Independent Company, Pennsylvania (Colored) Infantry)
* 1 Independent USC Regiment of Infantry [Powell&#x27;s Regiment, US Colored Infantry]
* 135 Regiments of Infantry [1st–138th USC Infantry] (The 94th, 105th, and 126th USC Infantry regiments were never fully formed)

;Details
* The 2nd USC (Light) Artillery Regiment (2nd USCA) was made up of nine separate batteries grouped into three nominal battalions of three batteries each. The batteries were usually detached.
** I Battalion: A,B &amp; C Batteries.
** II Battalion: D, E &amp; F Batteries.
** III Battalion: G, H &amp; I Batteries.
* The second raising of the 11th USC Infantry (USCI) was created by converting the 7th USC (Heavy) Artillery into an infantry unit.
* The second raising of the 79th USC Infantry (USCI) was formed from the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry.
* The second raising of the 83rd USC Infantry (USCI) was formed from the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry.
* The second raising of the 87th USCI was formed from merging the first raisings of the 87th and 96th USCI.
* The second raising of the 113th USCI was formed by merging the first raisings of the 11th, 112th, and 113th USCI.

==Notable actions==

The first engagement by African-American soldiers against Confederate forces during the Civil War was at the Battle of Island Mound in Bates County, Missouri on October 28–29, 1862. African Americans, mostly escaped slaves, had been recruited into the 1st Kansas Colored Volunteers. They accompanied white troops to Missouri to break up Confederate guerrilla activities based out of Hog Island near Butler, Missouri. Although outnumbered, the African-American soldiers fought valiantly, and the Union forces won the engagement. The conflict was reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. In 2012 the state established the Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site to preserve this area; the eight Union men killed were buried near the battleground.

USCT regiments fought in all theaters of the war, but mainly served as garrison troops in rear areas. The most famous USCT action took place at the Battle of the Crater during the Siege of Petersburg. Regiments of USCT suffered heavy casualties attempting to break through Confederate lines. Other notable engagements include Fort Wagner, one of their first major tests, and the Battle of Nashville.

Colored Troop soldiers were among the first Union forces to enter Richmond, Virginia, after its fall in April 1865. The 41st USCT regiment was among those present at the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox. Following the war, USCT regiments served among the occupation troops in former Confederate states.

U.S. Army General Ulysses S. Grant praised the competent performance and bearing of the USCT, saying at Vicksburg that:
===Prisoners of war===
USCT soldiers suffered extra violence at the hands of Confederate soldiers, who singled them out for mistreatment. They were often the victims of battlefield massacres and atrocities by Confederates, most notably at Fort Pillow in Tennessee, at the Battle of the Crater in Virginia, and at the Battle of Olustee in Florida. They were often murdered when captured by Confederate soldiers, as the Confederacy announced that former slaves fighting for the Union were traitors and would be immediately executed.

The prisoner exchange protocol based on the Dix–Hill Cartel broke down over the Confederacy&#x27;s position on black prisoners-of-war. The Congress of the Confederate States of America had passed a law on May 1, 1863, stating that white officers commanding black soldiers and blacks captured in uniform would be tried as rebellious slave insurrectionists in civil courts — a capital offense with automatic sentence of death. In practice, USCT soldiers were often murdered by Confederate troops without being taken to court. This law became a stumbling block for prisoner exchange, as the U.S. government in the Lieber Code objected to such discriminatory mistreatment of prisoners of war on basis of ethnicity. The Republican Party&#x27;s platform during the 1864 presidential election also condemned the Confederacy&#x27;s mistreatment of black U.S. soldiers. In response to such mistreatment, General Ulysses S. Grant, in a letter to Confederate officer Richard Taylor, urged the Confederates to treat captured black U.S. soldiers humanely and professionally, and not to murder them. He stated the U.S. government&#x27;s official position, that black U.S. soldiers were sworn military men. The Confederacy had said they were escaped slaves who deserved no better treatment.
==Numbers of colored troops by state, North and South==
The soldiers are classified by the state where they were enrolled; Northern states often sent agents to enroll formerly enslaved from the South. Many soldiers from Delaware, D.C., Kentucky, Missouri, and West Virginia were formerly enslaved as well. Most of the troops credited to West Virginia, however, were not actually from that state.

==Postwar==
The USCT was disbanded in the fall of 1865. In 1867, the Regular Army was set at ten regiments of cavalry and 45 regiments of infantry. The Army was authorized to raise two regiments of black cavalry (the 9th and 10th (Colored) Cavalry) and four regiments of black infantry (the 38th, 39th, 40th, and 41st (Colored) Infantry), who were mostly drawn from USCT veterans. The first draft of the bill that the House Committee on Military Affairs sent to the full chamber on March 7, 1866, did not include a provision for regiments of black cavalry; however, this provision was added by Senator Benjamin Wade prior to the bill&#x27;s passing. In 1869 the Regular Army was kept at ten regiments of cavalry but cut to 25 regiments of Infantry, reducing the black complement to two regiments (the 24th and 25th (Colored) Infantry).

The two black infantry regiments represented 10 percent of the size of all twenty-five infantry regiments. Similarly, the black cavalry units represented 20 percent of the size of all ten cavalry regiments.

From 1870 to 1898 the strength of the US Army totaled 25,000 service members with black soldiers maintaining their 10 percent representation. USCT soldiers fought in the Indian Wars in the American West, where they became known as the Buffalo Soldiers, thus nicknamed by Native Americans who compared their hair to the curly fur of bison.

==Awards==
===US Medal of Honor===
Eighteen African-American USCT soldiers earned the Medal of Honor, the nation&#x27;s highest award, for service in the war:
* Sergeant William Harvey Carney of the 54th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of Fort Wagner in July 1863. During the advance, Carney was wounded but still went on. When the color-bearer was shot, Carney grabbed the flagstaff and planted it in the parapet, while the rest of his regiment stormed the fortification. When his regiment was forced to retreat, he was wounded two more times while he carried the colors back to Union lines. He did not relinquish it until he handed it to another soldier of the 54th. Carney received his medal 37 years after the battle.
* Fourteen African-American soldiers, including Sergeant Major Christian Fleetwood and Sergeant Alfred B. Hilton (mortally wounded) of the 4th USCT, were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions at the Battle of Chaffin&#x27;s Farm in September 1864, during the campaign to take Petersburg.
* Corporal Andrew Jackson Smith of the 55th Massachusetts (Colored) Volunteer Infantry was recommended for the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of Honey Hill in November 1864. Smith prevented the regimental colors from falling into enemy hands after the color sergeant was killed. Due to a lack of official records, he was not awarded the medal until 2001.

===The Butler Award===
Soldiers who fought in the Army of the James were eligible for the Butler Medal, commissioned by that army&#x27;s commander, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler. When several slaves escaped to Butler&#x27;s lines in 1861, at Fort Monroe in Virginia, Butler was the first to declare any refugee slaves as contraband, and refused to return them to slaveholders, a standard that slowly became an unofficial policy throughout the Union Army. Their owner, a Confederate colonel, came to Butler under a flag of truce and demanded that they be returned to him under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Butler informed him that since Virginia claimed to have left the Union, the Fugitive Slave Law no longer applied, declaring the slaves to be contraband of war.

==Legacy and modern views==
The historian Steven Hahn proposes that when slaves organized themselves and worked with the Union Army during the American Civil War, including as some regiments of the USCT, their actions comprised a slave rebellion that dwarfed all other slave revolts. The African American Civil War Memorial Museum helps to preserve pertinent information from the period.

===Tributes===
* In 1924, the Grand Army of the Republic unveiled the Colored Soldiers Monument in Frankfort, Kentucky.
* In September 1996, a national celebration in commemoration of the service of the United States Colored Troops was held.
* The African American Civil War Memorial (1997), featuring &quot;Spirit of Freedom&quot; by sculptor Ed Hamilton, was erected at the corner of Vermont Avenue and U Street NW in the capital, Washington, D.C. It is administered by the National Park Service.
* In 1999 the African American Civil War Museum opened nearby.
* In July 2011, the African American Civil War Museum celebrated a grand opening of its new facility at 1925 Vermont Avenue Northwest, Washington, D.C., just across the street from the memorial.

===Other===
The motion picture &quot;Glory&quot;, starring Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick, portrayed the African-American soldiers of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment. It showed their training and participation in several battles, including the second assault on Fort Wagner on July 18, 1863. Although the 54th was not a USCT regiment, but a state volunteer regiment originally raised from free blacks in Boston, similar to the 1st and 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry, the film portrays the experiences and hardships of African-American troops during the Civil War. Richard Walter Thomas, black scholar of race relations, observed that the relationship between white and black soldiers in the Civil War was an instance of what he calls &quot;the other tradition&quot;: &quot;... after sharing the horrors of war with their black comrades in arms, many white officers experienced deep and dramatic transformations in their attitudes toward blacks.&quot;

<doc id="298235" wikidata="Q944461" url="?curid=298235" title="Lateral thinking">
<text>Lateral thinking is a manner of solving problems using an indirect and creative approach via reasoning that is not immediately obvious. Synonymous to thinking outside the box, it involves ideas that may not be obtainable using only traditional step-by-step logic. The cutting of the Gordian Knot is a classical example. 

The term was first used in 1967 by Maltese psychologist Edward de Bono who used the Judgement of Solomon, the Nine Dots Puzzle, and the sewing machine (automating the work rather than adding more workers) as examples, among many others, of lateral thinking. 

Lateral thinking deliberately distances itself from Vertical Thinking, the traditional method for problem solving.

De Bono argues lateral thinking entails a switch-over from a familiar pattern to a new, unexpected one. Such insight sometimes takes the form of humour 
but can also be cultivated.

Critics have characterized lateral thinking as a pseudo-scientific concept, arguing de Bono&#x27;s core ideas have never been rigorously tested or corroborated.

== Methods ==
Lateral thinking has to be distinguished from critical thinking. Critical thinking is primarily concerned with judging the true value of statements and seeking errors whereas lateral thinking focuses more on the &quot;movement value&quot; of statements and ideas. A person uses lateral thinking to move from one known idea to new ideas. Edward de Bono defines four types of thinking tools:
#idea-generating tools intended to break current thinking patterns—routine patterns, the status quo
#focus tools intended to broaden where to search for new ideas
#harvest tools intended to ensure more value is received from idea generating output
#treatment tools that promote consideration of real-world constraints, resources, and support

=== Random entry idea generation ===
The thinker chooses an object at random, or a noun from a dictionary and associates it with the area they are thinking about. De Bono exemplifies this through the randomly chosen word &quot;nose&quot; being applied to an office photocopier, leading to the idea that the copier could produce a lavender smell when it was low on paper.

=== Provocation idea generation ===

A provocation is a statement that we know is wrong or impossible but used to create new ideas. De Bono gives an example of considering river pollution and setting up the provocation, &quot;the factory is downstream of itself&quot;, causing a factory to be forced to take its water input from a point downstream of its output, an idea which later became law in some countries. Provocations can be set up by the use of any of the provocation techniques—wishful thinking, exaggeration, reversal, escape, distortion, or arising. The thinker creates a list of provocations and then uses the most outlandish ones to move their thinking forward to new ideas.

=== Movement techniques ===
The purpose of movement techniques is to produce as many alternatives as possible in order to encourage new ways of thinking about both problems and solutions. The production of alternatives tends to produce many possible solutions to problems that seemed to only have one possible solution. One can move from a provocation to a new idea through the following methods: extract a principle, focus on the difference, moment to moment, positive aspects or special circumstances.

=== Challenge ===
A tool which is designed to ask the question, &quot;Why?&quot;, in a non-threatening way: why something exists or why it is done the way it is. The result is a very clear understanding of &quot;Why?&quot;, which naturally leads to new ideas. The goal is to be able to challenge anything at all, not just those things that are problematic. For example, one could challenge the handles on coffee cups: The reason for the handle seems to be that the cup is often too hot to hold directly; perhaps coffee cups could be made with insulated finger grips, or there could be separate coffee-cup holders similar to beer holders, or coffee should not be so hot in the first place.

=== Concept formation ===
Ideas carry out concepts. This tool systematically expands the range and number of concepts in order to end up with a very broad range of ideas to consider.

=== Disproving ===
Based on the idea that the majority is always wrong (as suggested by Henrik Ibsen and by John Kenneth Galbraith), take anything that is obvious and generally accepted as &quot;goes without saying&quot;, question it, take an opposite view, and try to convincingly disprove it. This technique is similar to de Bono&#x27;s &quot;Black Hat&quot; of &quot;Six Thinking Hats&quot;, which looks at identifying reasons to be cautious and conservative.

=== Fractionation ===
The purpose of fractionation is to create alternative perceptions of problems and solutions by taking the commonplace view of the situation and breaking it into multiple alternative situations in order to break away from the fixed view and see the situation from different angles. This allows the generation of multiple possible solutions that can be synthesized into more comprehensive answers.

==Problem solving==
; Problem solving
: When something creates a problem, the performance or the status quo of the situation drops. Problem-solving deals with finding out what caused the problem and then figuring out ways to fix the problem. The objective is to get the situation to where it should be. For example, a production line has an established run rate of 1000 items per hour. Suddenly, the run rate drops to 800 items per hour. Ideas as to why this happened and solutions to repair the production line must be thought of, such as giving the worker a pay raise. A study on engineering students&#x27; abilities to answer very open-ended questions suggests that students showing more lateral thinking were able to solve the problems much quicker and more accurately.

; Lateral problem &quot;solving&quot;
: Lateral thinking often produces solutions that appear &quot;obvious&quot; in hindsight. It can often highlight problems people never knew they had, or solve simple problems that have huge impacts. For example, if a production line produced 1000 books per hour, lateral thinking may suggest that a drop in output to 800 would lead to higher quality, and more motivated workers. Students have shown lateral thinking in their application of a variety of individual, unique concepts in order to solve complex problems.

<text>Constance Mary Katherine Applebee (June 4, 1873 – January 26, 1981) is best known for introducing field hockey in the United States. She was a co-founder of the American Field Hockey Association and served as its head for 20 years. She also founded Sportswoman magazine and was the athletic director at Bryn Mawr College for 24 years.

Applebee graduated from the British College of Physical Education in 1899. In 1901, she came to America and took a course in anthropometry at Dudley Allen Sargent&#x27;s Summer School of Physical Training at Harvard University. After a discussion among her classmates and instructors regarding the British sport of field hockey, she took them to a courtyard behind the Harvard gymnasium and gave a demonstration of the game.

In the autumn of 1901 she embarked on a tour of women&#x27;s colleges in the northeastern United States, introducing field hockey and giving coaching and instruction regarding the sport to the students and faculty at each stop. She was invited to Vassar College by Harriet Ballintine, the school&#x27;s athletic director, and also visited Wellesley College, Bryn Mawr College, Smith College, Mount Holyoke College and Radcliffe College, and Wheaton Female Seminary. She made return visits to each of those schools and the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics to coach field hockey through the spring of 1904. In 1904 she was hired as full-time athletic director at Bryn Mawr College, where she served in that capacity through 1928.

In September 1922, Applebee established an annual three-week camp for intensive field hockey instruction at Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, on the grounds of Camp Tegawitha. The camp was in business for more than 70 years before finally closing after the 1994 season.

In 1924 she founded The Sportswoman, initially a field hockey magazine that eventually focused on all women&#x27;s sports

She was more commonly known by her nickname, &quot;The Apple&quot;, and on January 26, 1981, she died at 107 at a New Milton, Hampshire, England nursing home. She is buried at St John the Baptist Church at Burley in the New Forest. As well as a grave she is commemorated within the church in one of the stained glass windows.

She was also active in establishing lacrosse as a women&#x27;s sport in the United States of America. The U. S. Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Association was founded at her camp in the summer of 1931. The USWLA governed the sport on the collegiate and club levels until 1981, when the NCAA inaugurated its national championship tournament for women.

Applebee was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1991.

<doc id="298244" wikidata="Q25928" url="?curid=298244" title="Eurasian oystercatcher">
<text>The Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) also known as the common pied oystercatcher, or (in Europe) just oystercatcher, is a wader in the oystercatcher bird family Haematopodidae. It has striking black and white plumage, a long straight orange-red bill, red eyes and relatively short dull pink legs. The sexes are similar in appearance but the bill of the female is longer than that of the male.

It is the most widespread of the oystercatchers, with three races breeding in western Europe, central Eurosiberia, Kamchatka, China, and the western coast of Korea. No other oystercatcher occurs within this area.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian oystercatcher was listed by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Haemotopus ostralegus&quot;. The genus name &quot;Haematopus&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;haima&quot; meaning &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;pous&quot; meaning &quot;foot&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;ostralegus&quot; combines the Latin &quot;ostrea&quot; meaning &quot;oyster&quot; and &quot;legere&quot; meaning &quot;to gather&quot;.

The name &quot;oyster catcher&quot; was coined by Mark Catesby in 1731 as a common name for the North American species &quot;H. palliatus,&quot; described as eating oysters. William Yarrell in 1843 established this as the preferred term, replacing the older name &quot;sea pie&quot;.

Four subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;H. o. ostralegus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – breeds Iceland to Scandinavia and south Europe, winters in west Africa
* &quot;H. o. longipes&quot; Buturlin, 1910 – breeds Ukraine and Turkey to central Russia and west Siberia, winters in east Africa
* &quot;H. o. buturlini&quot; Dementiev, 1941 – breeds west Kazakhstan to northwest China, winters in southwest Asia and India
* &quot;H. o. osculans&quot; Swinhoe, 1871 – breeds Kamchatka Peninsula, Korean Peninsula, and northeast China, winters in east China

The extinct Canary Islands oystercatcher (&quot;Haematopus meadewaldoi&quot;), usually considered as distinct species, may have actually been an isolated subspecies or distinct population of the Eurasian oystercatcher.

==Description==
The oystercatcher is one of the largest waders in the region. It is long, the bill accounting for , and has a wingspan of . It is an obvious and noisy plover-like bird, with black and white plumage, pink legs and a strong broad red bill used for smashing or prising open molluscs such as mussels or for finding earthworms. The sexes are similar in plumage but the female has a longer bill than the male. Despite its name, oysters do not form a large part of its diet. The bird still lives up to its name, as few if any other wading birds are capable of opening oysters.

This oystercatcher is unmistakable in flight, with white patches on the wings and tail, otherwise black upperparts, and white underparts. Young birds are more brown, have a white neck collar and a duller bill. The call is a distinctive loud piping.

The bill shape varies; oystercatchers with broad bill tips open molluscs by prising them apart or hammering through the shell, whereas pointed-bill birds dig up worms. Much of this is due to the wear resulting from feeding on the prey. Individual birds specialise in one technique or the other which they learn from their parents. It shows clinal variation with an increase from west to east. The subspecies &quot;longipes&quot; has distinctly brownish upperparts and the nasal groove extends more than halfway along the bill. In the subspecies &quot;ostralegus&quot; the nasal groove stops short of the half-way mark. The &quot;osculans&quot; subspecies lacks white on the shafts of the outer 2–3 primaries and has no white on the outer webs of the outer five primaries.

The American oystercatcher (&quot;Haematopus palliatus&quot;) differs from the Eurasian oystercatcher in having a yellow eye and blackish-brown rather than black dorsal plumage.

==Distribution and migration==
The oystercatcher is a migratory species over most of its range. The European population breeds mainly in northern Europe, but in winter the birds can be found in north Africa and southern parts of Europe. Although the species is present all year in Ireland, Great Britain and the adjacent European coasts, there is still migratory movement: the large flocks that are found in the estuaries of south-west England in winter mainly breed in northern England or Scotland. Similar movements are shown by the Asian populations. The birds are highly gregarious outside the breeding season.

==Breeding==

The mating system is monogamous and the pair-bond usually lasts for the many years. They first breed when they are between three and five years of age. The nest is a bare scrape on pebbles, on the coast or on inland gravelly islands. Two to four eggs are laid. On average the eggs are in size and weigh . They are buffish-yellow in colour with black-brown blotches and streaks. Beginning after the last egg is laid, they are incubated by both parents and hatch synchronously after 24–27 days. The young are precocial and nidifugous. They are brooded by both parents and leave the nest after one or two days. They are fed by both parents. Only one brood is raised in a season. Both eggs and chicks are highly cryptic.

==Status==
Because of its large numbers and readily identified behaviour, the oystercatcher is an important indicator species for the health of the ecosystems where it congregates. Extensive long-term studies have been carried out on its foraging behaviour in northern Germany, the Netherlands, and particularly on the River Exe estuary in south-west England. These studies form an important part of the foundation for the modern discipline of behavioural ecology.

<doc id="298248" wikidata="Q3245490" url="?curid=298248" title="James the Less">
<text>James the Less ( ) is a figure of early Christianity. He is also called &quot;the Minor&quot;, &quot;the Little&quot;, &quot;the Lesser&quot;, or &quot;the Younger&quot;, according to translation, James is styled &quot;the Less&quot; to distinguish him from the Apostle James the Great (also called &quot;James the Elder&quot;) with &quot;Less&quot; meaning younger or shorter, rather than less important. James the Great was the brother of John the Apostle. 

James the Less has traditionally been commemorated along with St. Philip in the Western Christian calendars. In the Roman Catholic Church their feast day was observed on 1 May until 1955, when it was moved to 11 May to accommodate the Feast of St Joseph the Worker on 1 May. A later revision of the calendar moved the feast back to 3 May. In many other churches (for example, the Church of England) the feast has never moved from 1 May.

He is identified by Jerome as the same person also called &quot;James the Just&quot; and &quot;James, brother of Jesus&quot; in the Bible, thought of by Jerome and others as really a cousin of Jesus, and by Papias of Hierapolis he is also identified with &quot;James, son of Alphaeus&quot;, one of the Twelve Apostles.

== New Testament ==
In the New Testament, the name &quot;James&quot; identifies multiple men. James the Less is named only in connection with his mother &quot;Mary&quot;, who is also the mother of Joseph, who is called Joses by Mark (Joseph and Joses are variants of the same name). There are four mentions:
* &quot;Mary, the mother of James and Joseph&quot; (Matthew 27:56);
* &quot;Mary, the mother of James the younger and of Joses&quot; (Mark 15:40) (&quot;James the younger&quot; here has also been translated &quot;James the less&quot;);
* &quot;Mary, the mother of James&quot; (Mark 16:1 and Luke 24:10).

This &quot;Mary&quot; may have been Mary of Clopas, mentioned only in . It is unlikely to be Mary the mother of Jesus since she is not identified as Jesus&#x27; mother but only called the mother of James the Less and Joseph/Joses. In Matthew 27:56, she is clearly distinguished from the mother of James, son of Zebedee.

== Identification as James the brother of Jesus ==
According to Jerome, James the Less is identified with James the brother of Jesus and with James, the son of Alphaeus.

Jerome first tells that James the Less must be identified with James, the son of Alphaeus.

After that, James the Less being the same as James, the son of Alphaeus, Jerome describes in his work called &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot; that James &quot;the brother of the Lord&quot; is the same as James, son of Alphaeus:
 Thus, Jerome concludes that James the Less, James, son of Alphaeus and James the brother of Jesus are one and the same person.

According to the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, which is a collection of hagiographies, compiled by Jacobus de Voragine in the thirteenth century:


The same work adds &quot;Simon Cananean and Judas Thaddeus were brethren of James the Less and sons of Mary Cleophas, which was married to Alpheus.&quot;

== Identification as James, the son of Alphaeus ==
The title, &quot;the Less&quot;, is used to differentiate James from other people named James. Since it means that he is either the younger or shorter of two, he seems to be compared to one other James. In the lists of the twelve apostles in the synoptic Gospels, there are two apostles called James, who are differentiated there by their fathers: James, son of Zebedee, and James, son of Alphaeus. Long-standing tradition identifies James, the son of Alphaeus, as James the Less. James, son of Zebedee, is then called &quot;James the Great&quot; (although that designation does not appear in the New Testament). Some propose that Alphaeus was the same man as Cleophas or at least the husband of Mary Clopas.

In this regard, Jerome identified James the Less with James, son of Alpheus writing in his work called &quot;The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary&quot; the following:
Papias of Hierapolis, who lived circa 70–163 AD, in the surviving fragments of his work &quot;Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord&quot; relates that Mary, wife of Alphaeus is mother of James the Less:

Therefore, James, son of Alphaeus would be the same as James the Less.

In Catholic tradition, James&#x27;s mother is none other than Mary of Clopas who was among the women at the foot of the Cross of Jesus, weeping. For that reason, and given the fact that the Semitic word for brother is also used for other close relatives, James son of Alpheus is often held as a cousin to Jesus. He is also thought by some to be the brother of Matthew the Apostle, since the father of both was named Alphaeus (compare Mark 2:14 and 3:18).

Modern Biblical scholars are divided on whether this identification is correct. Catholic priest and biblical scholar John Paul Meier finds it unlikely. Amongst evangelicals, the &quot;New Bible Dictionary&quot; supports the traditional identification, while Don Carson and Darrell L. Bock both regard the identification as possible, but not certain.

<text>David A. Wagner (born 1974) is a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley and a well-known researcher in cryptography and computer security. He is a member of the Election Assistance Commission&#x27;s Technical Guidelines Development Committee, tasked with assisting the EAC in drafting the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines. He was also a member of the ACCURATE project.

== Biography ==
Wagner received an A.B. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1995, an M.S. in computer science from Berkeley in 1999, and a Ph.D. in computer science from Berkeley in 2000. He joined the faculty of Berkeley after graduation, became a Full Professor in 2010, and was chair of the Computer Science Department from 2020 to 2022. He has received awards for his teaching.

== Research ==
Wagner has published two books and over 200 peer-reviewed scientific papers. His notable achievements include:

* 2017 Development of the Carlini-Wagner attack on machine learning models (with Nicholas Carlini); used it to break 20 adversarial machine learning defenses.

* 2007 Served as principal investigator for the source code review and also the documentation review of the historic California state Top-to-Bottom review of electronic voting systems certified for use. Flaws found with vendor-supplied voting machines resulted in decertification and provisional recertification by the Secretary of State.
* 2001 Cryptanalysis of WEP, the security protocol used in 802.11 &quot;WiFi&quot; networks (with Nikita Borisov and Ian Goldberg).
* 2000 Cryptanalysis of the A5/1 stream cipher used in GSM cellphones (with Alex Biryukov and Adi Shamir).
* 1999 Cryptanalysis of Microsoft&#x27;s PPTP tunnelling protocol (with Bruce Schneier and &quot;Mudge&quot;).
* 1999 Invention of the slide attack, a new form of cryptanalysis (with Alex Biryukov); also the boomerang attack and mod n cryptanalysis (the latter with Bruce Schneier and John Kelsey).
* 1998 Development of Twofish block cipher, which was a finalist for NIST&#x27;s Advanced Encryption Standard competition (with Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson).
* 1997 Cryptanalyzed the CMEA algorithm used in many U.S. cellphones (with Bruce Schneier).
* 1995 Discovered a flaw in the implementation of SSL in Netscape Navigator (with Ian Goldberg).

<doc id="298261" wikidata="Q2190861" url="?curid=298261" title="Richie Rich (character)">
<text>Richard &quot;Richie&quot; $ Rich Jr. (often stylized as Ri¢hie Ri¢h) is a fictional character in the Harvey Comics universe. He debuted in the comic book &quot;Little Dot&quot; #1, cover-dated September 1953, and was created by Alfred Harvey with artists Warren Kremer and/or Steve Muffatti. Dubbed &quot;the poor little rich boy&quot;, Richie is the only child of fantastically wealthy parents and is the world&#x27;s richest kid. He is so rich, his middle name is a dollar sign, $.

During Harvey Comics&#x27; heyday from 1950 to 1982, Richie was the publisher&#x27;s most popular character, eventually starring in over 50 separate titles, including the long-running comics &quot;Richie Rich&quot;, &quot;Richie Rich Millions&quot;, &quot;Richie Rich Dollars and Cents&quot;, and &quot;Richie Rich Success Stories&quot;.

In 2011, Ape Entertainment began publishing a new licensed Richie Rich comic book series, taking the character in a very different, action-oriented, direction.

==Publication history==
Although created in 1953, Richie did not have his own title until 1960. Once he did, however, he quickly became Harvey&#x27;s most popular character, eventually starring in over fifty separate titles. The flagship, &quot;Richie Rich&quot;, ran 254 issues from 1960 to 1991 (with a hiatus from 1982 to 1986), followed by a second volume that ran an additional 28 issues from 1991 to 1994.

Other long-running titles were &quot;Richie Rich Millions&quot; (113 issues from 1961 to 1982), &quot;Richie Rich Dollars and Cents&quot; (109 issues from 1963 to 1982), and &quot;Richie Rich Success Stories&quot; (105 issues from 1964 to 1982).

In 1972, Harvey realized that Richie was its most lucrative character, and introduced five new Richie Rich titles: &quot;Richie Rich Bank Book&quot;, &quot;Richie Rich Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Richie Rich Jackpots&quot;, &quot;Richie Rich Money World&quot; and &quot;Richie Rich Riches&quot;. By the mid-1970s, says historian Mark Arnold, &quot;Richie was starring in 32 different titles every 60 days... Certainly Richie was the most successful feature in American comic books in the 1970s.&quot;

Harvey ceased publishing in 1982, but started up again in 1986 under new ownership; this hiatus resulted in the cancelation of many titles. Richie (along with many of the Harvey characters) has been published only sporadically since 1994.

Writers for the Richie Rich comic books and syndicated comic strip included Sid Jacobson, Lennie Herman, Stan Kay, and Ralph Newman. Richie Rich&#x27;s most famous illustrator is Warren Kremer. Other illustrators included Ernie Colón, Sid Couchey, Dom Sileo, Ben Brown, Steve Muffatti, and Joe Dennett.

==Character==
Despite negative stereotypes associated with his incredible wealth, Richie Rich is portrayed as unfailingly kind and charitable (in fact, his moniker is &quot;the poor little rich boy&quot;). He lives in an expensive mansion and owns at least two of everything money can buy. Richie appears to be around seven to ten years old, with a round cherubic face and parted blond hair. His typical attire is a waistcoat, a white shirt with an Eton collar (which is obscured by a giant red bow tie), and blue shorts. He was occasionally shown attending school in his hometown of Harveyville. Other times he is classmates with Little Dot and Little Lotta in Bonnie Dell.

===Ape Entertainment===
For the Ape Entertainment comic book series debuting in 2011, the character was updated by emphasizing his altruistic side; &quot;a mix of James Bond and Indiana Jones with the world&#x27;s biggest bank account, Richie is an altruistic adventurer who travels the world helping the less fortunate!&quot; The new Richie was joined by updated versions of his robot maid Irona and his butler Cadbury.

==Supporting characters==
===Rich family===
* Mr. Richard Rich Sr. – Richie&#x27;s father who is an industrialist (first appearance &quot;Little Dot&quot; #3)
* Mrs. Regina Rich (née Van Dough) – Richie&#x27;s mother (first appearance &quot;Little Dot&quot; #1)
* Aunt Noovo Rich (a pun on the French term &quot;nouveau riche&quot;) – Richie&#x27;s wealthy but very eccentric aunt who is crazy about posting signs. She has a tendency to show off her wealth. While few of Richie&#x27;s aunts and uncles are clarified to be paternal or maternal, Aunt Noovo is known to be his paternal aunt making her Mr. Rich&#x27;s sister.
* Uncle Titus - Although just as wealthy as the rest of the family, Uncle Titus is fanatical about saving money. He typically wears the most threadbare of clothes and makes every conceivable effort to avoid spending money, to the extent that his house is equipped with an alarm that goes off if he carelessly leaves the house with &quot;too much&quot; money. Some in the family have nicknamed him &quot;Tite-wad&quot;(as in ), a name he accepts with good humor.
* Aunt Mintley – An oft-bewildered aristocrat.
* Aunt Cleo – An animal lover.
* Uncle Worry – Richie&#x27;s uncle and former coach of a professional football team known for its long losing streak.
* Uncle Stormy – Another of Richie&#x27;s uncles whom Richie initially mistakes for an impostor named Blackie Bludsoe in one issue.
* Uncle Spender – Another uncle of Richie who squanders his money yet often realizes a profit on his extravagance.
* Aunt Gussie – A formerly overweight aunt who slimmed down and decided to keep her new figure.
* Aunt Surprise – A jovial aunt who brings Richie elaborate toys for Christmas and is imprisoned along with Richie, his parents, Cadbury, and Casper inside a magic lamp by the Meanie Genie.
* Ezekiel Rich – Richie&#x27;s nineteenth century ancestor whom Richie and Gloria met when they went back in time. He was arrested by the British as an enemy of the crown, but Richie came up with a way to save him.
* Gabby – A cousin who talks incessantly and became a salesman only to discover it was not the best line of work for him.
* Buck/Dollar – The Rich family &quot;Dollarmatian&quot; dog (like a Dalmatian, but with dollar signs instead of spots).

===Van Dough family===
* Reginald &quot;Reggie&quot; Van Dough Jr. – Richie&#x27;s mean, spoiled, maternal cousin, known for playing constant pranks on everyone, most notably Richie and his family, which causes his father to punish him. He treats his servants shabbily, often by calling them &quot;peasant&quot; which in turn causes them to call him &quot;monster&quot; as they swiftly correct themselves and call him Master (first appearance &quot;Little Dot&quot; #2).
* Reginald Van Dough Sr. – Mrs. Rich&#x27;s brother and Reggie&#x27;s father. He is often angered with Reggie&#x27;s non-stop pranks and often punishes him for them (usually by spanking).
* Vanessa Van Dough – Mrs. Rich&#x27;s sister-in-law and Reggie&#x27;s mother. She is not as quick to punish Reggie for his pranks, but she doesn&#x27;t tolerate Reggie&#x27;s unabashed cruelty either.
* Penny Van Dough – Reggie&#x27;s baby sister. She talks only in &quot;baby talk&quot;. The curl on her head is shaped like a dollar sign.

===Richie&#x27;s friends===
* Gloria Glad – Richie&#x27;s red haired girlfriend, notorious for her regular refusal of the many luxurious gifts Richie offers, and for her disdain for the open display of money, diamonds and other forms of wealth in Richie&#x27;s household, despite his efforts to conceal it from her. Regardless, she always wins his attention in comparison to Mayda Munny (first appearance &quot;Little Dot&quot; #33). Gloria&#x27;s last name, for the 1994 live-action film, was changed to Koscinski.
* Mayda Munny – Mayda Munny (whose name is a play on the phrase &quot;made of money&quot;) is Richie&#x27;s snobby ravenette -girlfriend, who never wins his attention. Like the Riches and Van Doughs, her family is fabulously wealthy. Immensely jealous of Gloria, and often angry when her plans to snare Richie&#x27;s attention backfire on her. Like Reggie, Mayda is snobbish and addresses those beneath her as &quot;peasant&quot;.
* Freckles and Pee-Wee Friendly – Richie&#x27;s poor but most-prized friends (first appearance &quot;Little Dot&quot; #2), whose blue-jeaned playtime attire sharply contrasts Richie&#x27;s bow-tied formal suit. Despite his working-class background, Freckles doesn&#x27;t object to Richie&#x27;s wealth the way Gloria does, and at times even enjoys it. Pee-Wee plays along with all of Freckles&#x27; and Richie&#x27;s activities without ever saying a word.
* Billy Bellhops – A redheaded boy who worked as a bellhop at his father&#x27;s hotel. Premiered in &quot;Richie Rich and Billy Bellhops&quot; in 1977, but was short-lived. Created by Alfred Harvey&#x27;s son Russel.
* Timmy Time – An extraterrestrial boy who time-travels to present-day Earth (landing on the Riches&#x27; private beach) from the year 2019 in search of tholarine, a substance he needs for spaceship fuel back in 2019. He appeared only in &quot;Richie Rich Meets Timmy Time&quot; #1 (September 1977). Timmy Time was created by Ernie Colón as Mark Time. Colón&#x27;s frustration at Mark Time being renamed Timmy Time and presented as a Richie Rich spin-off, when the original agreement had been that the character would debut in his own series, led him to abandon the project.
** Traveler - Timmy Time&#x27;s robot friend.
* Jackie Jokers – A stand-up comedian and a friend of Richie Rich.
* Jerry Jokers – The father of Jackie Jokers who often performs in comedy acts with his son.

===Rich family employees===
* Cadbury C. Cadbury – The Riches&#x27; butler who attends to the Rich estate. British born, Cadbury gives the image of propriety and service. When need demands however, he becomes a tough, gun-toting man of action. Cadbury is also a master hypnotist, ventriloquist and wood-carver. The 1994 live-action film gave him a modified (longer, but actually more credible) name: Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury. 
* Irona – The Riches&#x27; robot maid and Richie&#x27;s bodyguard.
* Bascomb – The Riches&#x27; chauffeur and skilled mechanic. He is also a vehicle inventor when not performing his primary duty.
* Chef Pierre – The Riches&#x27; chef extraordinaire.
* Mr. Cheepers – Mr. Rich&#x27;s accountant who finds constantly working with cash stressful.
* Mr. Woody – The incompetent Rich estate carpenter who is most adept at inadvertently annoying Richard Rich.
* Nurse Jenny – The Rich family nurse who was Richie&#x27;s nanny when he was a baby.
* Professor Keenbean – A scientist who is the head of the Rich research and development department and Richie&#x27;s personal tutor.
* Professor Mindblow – A worker at the research and development department.
* Professor Pianissimo – Richie&#x27;s violin teacher for one lesson in one issue, who becomes the teacher of a promising self-taught child violinist named Louis whom Richie met in a music shop.
* Chadwick – The Riches&#x27; assistant butler.
* Minnie Mintz – One of the Riches&#x27; cooks.
* Captain Fuzzby – The captain of the Rich family&#x27;s estate police.
* Marie – The Riches&#x27; French maid and Chef Pierre&#x27;s girlfriend.
* Mr. Green – The Riches&#x27; gardener.
* Captain Alar – The pilot of the Riches&#x27; supersonic jet.

===Villains===
* Onion – A recurring villain with horrible onion-powered breath capable of knocking victims unconscious with a trademark &quot;hashaah!&quot;
* Dr. Robert Blemish – A recurring villain, he is an evil mad scientist and nemesis of Professor Keenbean.
* Dr. N-R-Gee – A recurring villain with the distinguishing feature of a huge red light bulb for a head, caused when scientist Phil Lament (a pun referring to a light bulb&#x27;s &quot;filament&quot;) suffered an electrical accident in his lab.
* Condor – A billionaire mastermind with his own terrorist army and the Rich Family&#x27;s worst enemy. His only desire is to take over Mr. Rich&#x27;s empire.

==In other media==
===Animated TV series===
* Beginning in 1980, Richie Rich appeared in his own Saturday morning cartoon show, simply called &quot;Richie Rich&quot; where Richie Rich was voiced by Sparky Marcus. The show aired on &quot;The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show&quot; from 1980 to 1982 and &quot;The Pac-Man/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show&quot; from 1982 to 1984. In the animated version, Richie and his pals are somewhat older, around 12 years old. In the cartoon, Richie wears a red sweater with the letter &quot;R&quot; in front. Gloria was voiced by Nancy Cartwright while the other voice talents consisted of Dick Beals as Reggie Van Dough, William Callaway as Professor Keanbean and Chef Pierre, Joan Gerber as Irona and Regina Rich, Christian Hoff as Freckles and Pee-Wee, Stanley Jones as Cadbury and Mr. Rich, and Frank Welker as Dollar. While Dr. Blemish (also voiced by Frank Welker) appeared in one episode, Richie also has a recurring enemy in the Collector (voiced by Robert Ridgely).
* In 1996, the second &quot;Richie Rich&quot; animated series, also called &quot;Richie Rich&quot; aired in non-network syndication, starring Katie Leigh as the voices of Richie Rich and Irona. The series ran for 13 episodes and portrayed Richie in his &quot;classic&quot; tuxedo outfit. The show also features the voice talents of Jeannie Elias as Freckles, Gloria Glad, Reggie Van Dough, and Pee-Wee, René Auberjonois as Richard Rich, Chef Pierre, and Professor Keanbean, Pat Fraley as Dollar, Martin Jarvis as Cadbury and Bascomb, and Susan Silo as Regina Rich.
* Richie Rich made some appearances in the Fox cartoon &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in the episodes &quot;Three Men and a Comic Book&quot;, &quot;Behind the Laughter&quot;, &quot;Simple Simpson&quot;, and &quot;Double, Double, Boy in Trouble&quot;. 
* Richie Rich was parodied in the Adult Swim cartoon &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, voiced by Breckin Meyer. He was featured in a parody of the TV show &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;, where the character is portrayed as a playboy and a rapper and he shows his house in the same style as the MTV show.
* In 2019, Richie Rich made his first appearance as a guest character on &quot;Harvey Girls Forever!&quot;, a Netflix animated series based on Harvey Comics characters, voiced by Jack Quaid. He is a main character in season 3 which premiered later that year.

===Live-action TV series===
A half-hour comedy series titled &quot;Richie Rich&quot; debuted in 2015 on Netflix, with Jake Brennan starring as Richie Rich, along with Joshua Carlon, Jenna Ortega, Lauren Taylor, Kiff VandenHeuvel, and Brooke Wexler. However, the series is very different from the original and the rest of the original main characters were replaced, like Herbert Cadbury their butler and Professor Keenbean head of Rich&#x27;s research and development, the only exception is Irona. Unlike the comic book version, Richie is not born wealthy and is a self-made trillionaire. Unlike the comics in this series, Richie has a sister, instead of being an only child, and both of them are raised by a single parent, their father. The show was executive produced by Jeff Hodsden and Tim Pollack from &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; and &quot;A.N.T. Farm&quot;. The show was produced by DreamWorks Animation.

===Live-action films===
* &quot;Richie Rich&quot;, a live-action film adaptation, was released in 1994, with Macaulay Culkin as the titular character, Edward Herrmann as Richard Rich, Christine Ebersole as Regina Rich, Jonathan Hyde as Cadbury, Michael McShane as Professor Keanbean, John Larroquette as the evil Laurence Van Dough, and Frank Welker providing special vocal effects. It was produced by Silver Pictures and Davis Entertainment and released by Warner Bros. under its Family Entertainment label.
* A live-action sequel titled &quot;Richie Rich&#x27;s Christmas Wish&quot; followed in 1998. This film starred David Gallagher as the titular character, Martin Mull as Richard Rich, Lesley Ann Warren as Regina Rich, Keene Curtis as Cadbury, Don McLeod as Irona, Michelle Trachtenberg as Gloria, Eugene Levy as Professor Keanbean, and Jake Richardson as Reggie Van Dough.

===Music===
* &quot;Richie Rich&quot; is mentioned in the Dance Hall Crashers song “Old and Grey” as having been, along with &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, one of co-vocalist Elyse Rogers&#x27; favorite television programs to watch after school as a child (this may be referring to &quot;The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show&quot;).

===Advertisements===
In 2012, Richie Rich was shown in MetLife&#x27;s &quot;Everyone&quot; commercial during Super Bowl XLVI.

<text>An &quot;ex post facto&quot; law is a law that retroactively changes the legal consequences or status of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, before the enactment of the law. In criminal law, it may criminalize actions that were legal when committed; it may aggravate a crime by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; it may change the punishment prescribed for a crime, as by adding new penalties or extending sentences; it may extend the statute of limitations; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make conviction for a crime likelier than it would have been when the deed was committed.

Conversely, a form of &quot;ex post facto law&quot; called an amnesty law may decriminalize certain acts. Alternatively, rather than redefining the relevant acts as non-criminal, it may simply prohibit prosecution; or it may enact that there is to be no punishment, but leave the underlying conviction technically unaltered. A pardon has a similar effect, except it applies in just one case instead of a class of cases. Other legal changes may alleviate possible punishments retroactively, for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment. Such legal changes are also known by the Latin term in mitius.

Some common-law jurisdictions do not permit retroactive criminal legislation, though new precedent generally applies to events that occurred before the judicial decision. &quot;Ex post facto&quot; laws are expressly forbidden by the United States Constitution in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3 (with respect to federal laws) and Article 1, Section 10 (with respect to state laws). In some nations that follow the Westminster system of government, &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws may be possible, because the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy allows Parliament to pass any law it wishes, within legal constraints. In a nation with an entrenched bill of rights or a written constitution, &quot;ex post facto&quot; legislation may be prohibited or allowed, and this provision may be general or specific. For example, Article 29 of the Constitution of Albania explicitly allows retroactive effect for laws that alleviate possible punishments.

&quot;Ex post facto&quot; criminalization is prohibited by Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 15(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 9 of the American Convention on Human Rights. While American jurisdictions generally prohibit &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws, European countries apply the principle of lex mitior (&quot;the milder law&quot;). It provides that, if the law has changed after an offense was committed, the version of the law that applies is the one that is more advantageous for the accused. This means that &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws apply in European jurisdictions to the extent that they are the milder law.

==&quot;Ex post facto&quot; laws by country==

===Australia===
Australia has no strong constitutional prohibition on &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws, although narrowly retrospective laws might violate the constitutional separation of powers principle. Australian courts normally interpret statutes with a strong presumption that they do not apply retrospectively.

Retrospective laws designed to prosecute what was perceived to have been a blatantly unethical means of tax avoidance were passed in the early 1980s by the Fraser government (see Bottom of the harbour tax avoidance). Similarly, legislation criminalising certain war crimes retrospectively has been held to be constitutional (see &quot;Polyukhovich v Commonwealth&quot;).

Australia participated in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and was an original signatory in 1948. The Declaration includes a prohibition on retrospectively holding anyone guilty of a penal offence that was not an offence at the time it was committed. The Australian Human Rights Commission states the Declaration is an &quot;expression of the fundamental values which are shared by all members of the international community&quot; but &quot;does not directly create legal obligations for countries.&quot;

Australia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The implementation of retrospective criminal laws is expressly prohibited by the Covenant. Australia is also a party to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Protocol enables individuals subject to the jurisdiction of a state party to file complaints with the United Nations Human Rights Committee for that state party&#x27;s non-compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

===Brazil===
According to the 5th Article, section XXXVI of the Brazilian Constitution, laws cannot have &quot;ex post facto&quot; effects that affect acquired rights, accomplished juridical acts and &quot;res judicata&quot;.

The same article in section XL prohibits &quot;ex post facto&quot; criminal laws. Like France, there is an exception when retroactive criminal laws benefit the accused person.

===Canada===
In Canada, &quot;ex post facto&quot; criminal laws are constitutionally prohibited by section 11(g) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Also, under section 11(i) of the Charter, if the punishment for a crime has varied between the time the crime was committed and the time of sentencing following a conviction, the convicted person is entitled to the lesser punishment. Due to section 1 and section 33 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms these rights are not absolute, and may be overridden.

The Canada sex offender registry, which went into effect on December 15, 2004, is somewhat retroactive. When the registry was created, all offenders who were on the Ontario sex offender registry, which was created in 2001, were required to register on the national registry. In addition, sex offenders in all provinces who were serving a sentence (whether imprisoned or on probation or parole) on December 15, 2004, were required to register, regardless of when their offense and conviction occurred. However, the registry was not retroactive to anybody who had completed their sentence by late 2004 and was not on the Ontario registry. Canadian courts have never ruled on the somewhat retroactive nature of the sex offender registry, since this seems to have never been challenged.

Sex offender registration was not mandatory for sex offenders until 2011, and had to be ordered by a judge. Sex offender registration was seemingly mandatory for people convicted before December 15, 2004, who were serving a sentence on that date, but was only optional for sex offenders convicted between December 15, 2004, and January 1, 2011.

Because section 11 of the Charter is among the sections that can be overridden under section 33 (the notwithstanding clause), Parliament could in theory enact &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws by invoking section 33. However, the federal Parliament, which has exclusive jurisdiction over criminal law, has never attempted to enact an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law (or any other law) using section 33.

The Charter prohibition applies only to criminal law. Changes to civil law in Canada can be, and occasionally are, enacted &quot;ex post facto&quot;. In one example, convicted murderer Colin Thatcher was ordered to forfeit proceeds from a book he had published (after being paroled from prison) under a Saskatchewan law. Although the law was passed long after Thatcher&#x27;s murder conviction, the courts have ruled that such laws prescribe only civil penalties (as opposed to additional criminal penalties) and are thus not subject to Charter restrictions.

===Croatia===
Article 90 of the Constitution of Croatia states that &quot;only individual provisions of a law may have a retroactive effect for exceptionally justified reasons&quot;. According to Croatian legal scholar , this means that &quot;a law cannot be applied retroactively as a whole, and regulations enacted pursuant to statutory authority can never be applied retroactively&quot;.

===Denmark===

Following the liberation of Denmark from Nazi occupation in 1945, the Folketing, heavily influenced by the Frihedsråd, passed a special law (Lov Nr. 259 af 1. Juni 1945 om Tillæg til Borgerlig Straffelov angaaende Forræderi og anden landsskadelig Virksomhed, colloquially &quot;landsforræderloven&quot; (the traitor law) or &quot;strafferetstillægget&quot; (the penal code addendum)), temporarily reintroducing the death penalty (previously abolished in 1930) for acts of treason committed during German occupation. Passed on 1 June 1945, the law applied to actions performed subsequent to 9 April 1940, unless those actions were done under orders from the government prior to 29 August 1943. With this authorization, 103 death sentences were issued, of which 46 were carried out.

===Estonia===
Estonian constitution is declaring that no one shall be convicted of an act which did not constitute a criminal offense under the law in force at the time the act was committed. And that no one shall be sentenced to a heavier penalty than the one that was applicable at the time the offense was committed.

===Finland===
Generally, the Finnish legal system does not permit &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws, especially those that would expand criminal responsibility. They are not expressly forbidden; instead, the ban is derived from more general legal principles and basic rights. In civil matters, such as taxation, &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws may be made in some circumstances.

Former Minister of the Interior Päivi Räsänen became subject of a criminal investigation about suspected agitation against an ethnic group in late 2019 over her text concerning homosexuality, which was published online in 2004. The statute of limitations for said charge is five years, which has led the case to be interpreted as &quot;ex post facto&quot;. However, agitation against an ethnic group is a &quot;perpetuating crime&quot;, and the statute of limitations only begins once the offending material has been removed from public viewing. The investigation has still been characterized as strange, as Räsänen&#x27;s text is hardly the only material online or otherwise that could be viewed as agitation against an ethnic group, and the demarcation between who should and who should not be prosecuted for publishing and/or making such material available is unclear.

Historically there have been three exceptional instances when &quot;ex post facto&quot; criminal laws have been used in Finland.

# Following the Finnish Civil War of 1918, the Parliament of Finland passed a law setting up tribunals to try suspected rebels. These tribunals issued death sentences in many cases, although very few of those accused could have committed a crime that carried the death penalty under Finnish law in force during the war. Several hundred people were executed under what was arguably an &quot;ex post facto&quot; legal arrangement. During the war, and before the tribunals were set up, thousands of people had been executed without trial by both sides. However, once this phase of the civil war ended, amnesty laws were passed. Thus, the legality of the actions of the government or the participants of either side of the war cannot be legally contested anymore.
# After World War II, Finland was under pressure to convict political leaders whom the Allied powers considered responsible for Finnish involvement in the war. An &quot;ex post facto&quot; law was passed in the autumn of 1945 to permit prosecution for war responsibility, and eventually eight politicians were convicted. In another post-war case, the weapons cache case, an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law was passed in 1947 so that military personnel could be prosecuted for unofficially preparing for guerrilla resistance in case of Soviet occupation.
# During World War II, desertion, draft dodging and conscientious objection were punishable by death or jail. Amnesty laws were passed after World War II to free deserters and draft dodgers from imprisonment and further prosecution and allow them to return home without further legal consequences.

===France===
In France, so-called &quot;lois rétroactives&quot; (retroactive laws) are technically prohibited by Article 2 of the Code Civil, which states that: &quot;Legislation provides only for the future; it has no retrospective operation&quot;. In practice, however, since the Code Civil does not have the status of constitutional legislation and can therefore be overruled by subsequent laws, the has determined that retroactive laws can be passed within certain limits – such as in the case of financial or tax legislation –, particularly where it is considered to be in the &quot;general interest&quot;; this has been demonstrated by a series of decisions handed down by the Conseil Constitutionnel concerning retroactive tax laws.

However, in criminal law, &quot;ex post facto&quot; sanctions are effectively forbidden as per Article 112-1 of the French Penal Code, except in cases wherein the retroactive application benefits the accused person (called retroactivity &quot;in mitius&quot;). They are also considered unconstitutional, since the principle of non-retroactivity is laid down in Article 8 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which has constitutional status under French law. The &quot;épuration légale&quot; trials held after the 1944 liberation of France introduced the status of &quot;indignité nationale&quot; for Nazi collaborators as a way to avoid &quot;ex post facto&quot; law.

===Germany===
Article 103 of the German basic law requires that an act may be punished only if it has already been punishable by law at the time it was committed (specifically: by &quot;written&quot; law, Germany following civil law).

Robert A. Taft, at the time a U.S. Senator from Ohio, asserted that the Nuremberg Trials following World War II were based on &quot;ex post facto&quot; law because the Allies did not negotiate the Nuremberg Charter, which defined crimes against humanity and created the International Military Tribunal, until well after the acts charged. Others, including the International Military Tribunal, argued that the London Charter merely restated and provided jurisdiction to prosecute offenses that were already made unlawful by the Kellogg–Briand Pact, the Covenant of the League of Nations, and the various Hague Conventions.

William O. Douglas complained that the Allies were guilty of &quot;substituting power for principle&quot; at Nuremberg Trials because the actions of the defendants were lawful in the 1930s Germany. He contended that the Nuremberg Trials were implementing laws after the fact (that is, ex post facto) &quot;to suit the clamor of the time.&quot; American Chief Justice Harlan Stone, likewise, called the Nuremberg Trials a &quot;fraud&quot; because of the ex post facto laws.

The problem of &quot;ex post facto&quot; law was also relevant in the 1990s after German reunification as there was a discussion about the trials against East German border troops who killed fugitives on the Inner-German border (&quot;Mauerschützen-Prozesse&quot; – &quot;Wall-shooters&#x27;/ -guards&#x27; trials&quot;). German courts in these cases recurred to the Radbruch formula.

===Hungary===
In 2010, the Hungarian National Assembly established a 98% punitive tax on any income over two million forints received either as a retirement package or as severance pay in the previous five years in the government sector.

===India===
In India, without using the expression &quot;ex post facto law&quot;, the underlying principle has been adopted in the article 20(1) of the Indian Constitution in the following words:
Further, what article 20(1) prohibits is conviction and sentence under an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law for acts done prior thereto, but not the enactment or validity of such a law. There is, thus, a difference between the Indian and the American positions on this point; whereas in the United States, an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law is in itself invalid, it is not so in India. The courts may also interpret a law in such a manner that any objection against it of retrospective operation may be removed.

An example for retrospective law in India is the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978 in the state of Karnataka.

===Indonesia===
The Indonesian Constitution prohibits trying citizens under retroactive laws in any circumstance. This was tested in 2004 when the conviction of Masykur Abdul Kadir, one of the Bali bombers, under retroactive anti-terrorist legislation was quashed.

===Iran===
&quot;Ex post facto&quot; laws, in all contexts, are prohibited by Article 169 (Chapter 11) of the Iranian Constitution.

===Ireland===
During the Irish Civil War, Anti-Treaty IRA members Rory O&#x27;Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard “Dick” Barrett and Joseph McKelvey were executed ex post facto and without trial, just 2 days into the existence of the Irish Free State. Despite being imprisoned for over four months, following their deaths the Third Dáil retrospectively approved their executions for a crime that had only been legislated against. Largely, the executions were considered retribution for the assassination of the legislator, Deputy Seán Hales TD the previous day. 

The imposition of retroactive criminal sanctions is prohibited in the subsequent Irish Constitution, introduced by Eamonn De Valera, in Article 15.5.1°. Retroactive changes of the civil law have also been found to violate the constitution when they would have resulted in the loss in a right to damages before the courts, the Irish Supreme Court having found that such a right is a constitutionally protected property right.
===Israel===
Israel enacted the 1950 Nazis and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law for the purpose of punishing acts that occurred during the Second World War and the Holocaust, when Israel did not exist as a state. The law was used to punish Adolf Eichmann and others.

===Italy===
Article 25, paragraph 2, of the Italian Constitution, establishing that &quot;nobody can be punished but according to a law come into force before the deed was committed&quot;, prohibits indictment pursuant a retroactive law. Article 11 of preliminary provisions to the Italian Civil Code and Article 3, paragraph 1, of the Statute of taxpayer&#x27;s rights, prohibit retroactive laws on principle: such provisions can be derogated, however, by acts having force of the ordinary law; on the contrary, non-retroactivity in criminal law is thought absolute.

===Japan===
Article 39 of the constitution of Japan prohibits the retroactive application of laws. Article 6 of Criminal Code of Japan further states that if a new law comes into force after the deed was committed, the lighter punishment must be given.

===Lithuania===
Lithuania has no constitutional prohibition on &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws. However, as a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights and as a member of the European Union whose Charter of Fundamental Rights has the effect of law, any retroactive law could still be struck down. Retroactive criminal sanctions are prohibited by Article 2, Part 1 (Chapter 1) of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania. Retroactive administrative sanctions are prohibited by Article 8 of the Administrative Code of the Republic of Lithuania.

Lithuanian lawyer Dainius Žalimas contends that there has been retroactive application of the law on Genocide (and subsequently adopted articles of the Criminal Code) against participants in Soviet repressions against Lithuanian guerilla fighters and their supporters, and gives examples of such decisions. The Article 99 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania was introduced only on September 26, 2000, and therefore can&#x27;t be used in events of 1944–1953.

===Mexico===
According to the first and second paragraphs of the 14th Article of the Mexican Constitution, retroactive application of the law is prohibited if it is detrimental to a person&#x27;s rights, but a new law can be applied if it benefits the person.

===Netherlands===
Article 4 of the Law on General Provisions (in effect since 1838) states that &quot;The law has no retroactive effect&quot;.

Article 1 of Criminal Law states that no act is punishable without a pre-existing law, and that in the case an act was punishable but the law was changed after the criminal act the &quot;most favorable&quot; (to the suspect) of the two laws will apply.

In Civil Law there is no such provision.

===New Zealand===
Section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1999 stipulates that enactments do not have retrospective effect. The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 also affirms New Zealand&#x27;s commitment to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with section 26 preventing the application of retroactive penalties. This is further reinforced under section 6(1) of the current Sentencing Act 2002 which provides, &quot;[p]enal enactments not to have retrospective effect to disadvantage of offender&quot; irrespective of any provision to the contrary.

Section 26 of the Bill of Rights and the previous sentencing legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 1985, caused significant digression among judges when the New Zealand Parliament introduced legislation that had the effect of enacting a retrospective penalty for crimes involving an element of home invasion. Ultimately, the discrepancy was restricted with what some labelled artificial logic in the cases of &quot;R v Pora&quot; and &quot;R v Poumako&quot;.

===Norway===
Article 97 of the Norwegian Constitution prohibits any law to be given retroactive effect. The prohibition applies to both criminal and civil laws, but in some civil cases, only particularly unreasonable effects of retroactivity will be found unconstitutional.

===Pakistan===
Article 12 of the Constitution of Pakistan prohibits any law to be given retroactive effect by stating:
* 12.1 – No law shall authorize the punishment of a person:-
* 12.1.a – for an act or omission that was not punishable by law at the time of the act or omission; or
* 12.1.b – for an offence by a penalty greater than, or of a kind different from, the penalty prescribed by law for that offence at the time the offence was committed.

===Philippines===
The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines categorically prohibits the passing of any &quot;ex post facto&quot; law. Article III (Bill of Rights), Section 22 specifically states: &quot;No &quot;ex post facto&quot; law or bill of attainder shall be enacted.&quot;

However, the Cybercrime Prevention Act, which went into effect on October 3, 2012, is criticized for being &quot;ex post facto&quot;.

===Poland===
Retroactive application of law is prohibited by the Article 3 of the Polish civil code, and the legal rule prohibiting such retroactive application is commonly memorised as a Latin sentence &quot;Lex retro non agit&quot; (&quot;A law does not apply retroactively&quot;). The said article, however, allows retroactive application of an Act of Parliament if it is expressly understood from its text or purpose.

===Portugal===
Article 18 of the Portuguese Constitution forbids the retroactive application of any law the restricts right; article 29 of the Portuguese Constitution forbids retroactive application of criminal law; article 103 forbids the application of retroactive taxes.

===Romania===
Article 15 (2) of the Romanian Constitution provides that the law shall only act for the future, except for the more favourable criminal or administrative law.

===Russia===
&quot;Ex post facto&quot; punishment in criminal and administrative law is prohibited by article 54 of the Russian Constitution; &quot;ex post facto&quot; tax laws by article 57 of the constitution.

===Spain===
Article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution guarantees the principle of non-retroactivity of punitive provisions that are not favorable to or restrictive of individual rights. Therefore, &quot;ex post facto&quot; criminal laws or any other retroactive punitive provisions are constitutionally prohibited.

As well as Statute law mentioned above, this now also includes &#x27;court-made law&#x27;. The Parot doctrine, in which terrorists were denied the right (enshrined in a 1973 Statute) to earn a reduction in the length of their sentences by a Spanish court ruling in 2006 was judged by the European Court of Human Rights to be contrary to relevant articles on retroactivity &amp; liberty and security in 2013.

===South Africa===
Section 35(3) of the South African Bill of Rights prohibits &quot;ex post facto&quot; criminal laws, except that acts which violated international law at the time they were committed may be prosecuted even if they were not illegal under national law at the time. It also prohibits retroactive increases of criminal punishments.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, retroactive penal sanctions and other retroactive legal effects of criminal acts due the State are prohibited by chapter 2, section 10 of the Instrument of Government (&quot;Regeringsformen&quot;). Retroactive taxes or charges are not prohibited, but they can have retroactive effect reaching back only to the time when a new tax bill was proposed by the government. The retroactive effect of a tax or charge thus reaches from that time until the bill is passed by the parliament.

As the Swedish Act of Succession was changed in 1979, and the throne was inherited regardless of sex, the inheritance right was withdrawn from all the descendants of Charles XIV John (king 1818–44) except the current king Carl XVI Gustaf. Thereby, the heir-apparent title was transferred from the new-born Prince Carl Philip to his older sister Crown Princess Victoria.

The Swedish Riksdag voted in 2004 to abolish inheritance tax by January 1, 2005. However, in 2005 they retro-actively decided to move the date to December 17, 2004. The main reason was abolishing inheritance tax for the many Swedish victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which took place on December 26.

===Turkey===
&quot;Ex post facto&quot; punishment is prohibited by Article 38 of the Constitution of Turkey. It states:
* c1. No one shall be punished for any act which does not constitute a criminal offence under the law in force at the time committed; no one shall be given a heavier penalty for an offence other than the penalty applicable at the time when the offence was committed.
* c2. The provisions of the above paragraph shall also apply to the statute of limitations on offences and penalties and on the results of conviction.
Thus, the article does not prohibit &quot;in mitius&quot; laws, i.e. cases wherein the retroactive application benefits the accused person.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws are permitted by virtue of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. Historically, all acts of Parliament before 1793 were &quot;ex post facto&quot; legislation, inasmuch as their date of effect was the first day of the session in which they were passed. This situation was rectified by the Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793.

Some laws are still passed retrospectively: e.g., the Pakistan Act 1990 (by which the United Kingdom amended its legislation consequent to the Commonwealth of Nations having re-admitted Pakistan as a member) was one such law; despite being passed on 29 June 1990, section 2 subsection 3 states that &quot;This Act shall be deemed to have come into force on 1st October 1989&quot;, nine months before it was enacted.

Retrospective &quot;criminal&quot; laws are prohibited by Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory, but some legal authorities have stated their opinion that parliamentary sovereignty takes priority even over this. For example, the War Crimes Act 1991 created an &quot;ex post facto&quot; jurisdiction of British courts over war crimes committed during the Second World War. Another important example of a case which shows the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy in action is in relation to &quot;Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate&quot;, where the decision of the courts was overridden with retrospective effect by the War Damage Act 1965, which changed the law on compensation resulting from scorched earth actions in Burma during the war. More recently, the Police (Detention and Bail) Act 2011 retroactively overrode a controversial court judgment resulting from an error in the drafting of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that would potentially have invalidated thousands of criminal convictions.

Another example of an &quot;ex post facto&quot; criminal law in the UK is the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This law allows people acquitted of murder and certain other serious offences to be retried if there is &quot;new, compelling, reliable and substantial evidence&quot; that the acquitted person really was guilty. This Act applies retroactively and can be used to re-prosecute people who were acquitted before it came into force in 2005, or even before it was passed in 2003. As a result, two of the defendants who were acquitted in the murder of Stephen Lawrence were allowed to be retried, even though this murder occurred in 1993 and the defendants had been acquitted in 1996. Many people have criticized the Criminal Justice Act because of its essential abolition of prohibition against both ex post facto and double jeopardy laws.

Taxation law has on multiple occasions been changed to retrospectively disallow tax avoidance schemes. The most significant example known concerns double-taxation treaty arrangements where the Finance Act 2008 with BN66 retrospectively amended 1987 legislation, creating large tax liabilities for 3,000 people where no liability existed before.

===United States===
Thomas Jefferson, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, stated in 1813 that:

Congress is prohibited from passing &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws by clause 3 of Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution. The states are prohibited from passing &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws by clause 1 of Article I, Section 10. This is one of the relatively few restrictions that the United States Constitution made to both the power of the federal and state governments before the Fourteenth Amendment. Over the years, however, when deciding &quot;ex post facto&quot; cases, the United States Supreme Court has referred repeatedly to its ruling in &quot;Calder v. Bull&quot;, in which Justice Samuel Chase held that the prohibition applied only to criminal matters, not civil matters, and established four categories of unconstitutional &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws. The case dealt with the Article I, Section 10, prohibition on &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws, because it concerned a Connecticut state law.

As a result of &quot;Calder v. Bull&quot;, several retroactive taxes have been passed by the US Congress, starting with the 1913 Revenue Act, which imposed the first income tax. By 1935, prohibitions on retroactive taxation had been declared &quot;dead.&quot; In 1938, the US Supreme Court claimed the standard on retroactive taxation was “retroactive application is so harsh and oppressive as to transgress the constitutional limitation.” In practice, this has resulted in virtually all retroactive taxes being upheld, and in one case a 1993 revision of tax law that applied retroactively to 1984 was upheld.

Not all laws with retroactive effects have been held to be unconstitutional. One current U.S. law that has a retroactive effect is the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. This law imposes new registration requirements on convicted sex offenders and also applies to offenders whose crimes were committed before the law was enacted. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Smith v. Doe&quot; (2003) that requiring sex offenders to register their whereabouts at regular intervals, and the posting of personal information about them on the Internet, do not violate the constitutional prohibition against &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws, because these laws do not impose any kind of punishment.

In &quot;Starkey v. Oklahoma Department of Corrections&quot;, the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma found the Oklahoma Sex Offender Registration Act, or SORA, to be punitive in nature, if not in intent. While the law in question had been ruled as not being retroactive in nature, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections had been applying the new legislation retroactively. The court found that &quot;the Department&#x27;s retroactive application of the level assignment provisions of 57 O.S. Supp. 2007, 582.1 – 582.5, as amended, violates the ex post facto clause.&quot;

Controversy has also arisen with regard to sexually violent predator (SVP) laws, which allow the indefinite commitment of a person with a mental abnormality which predisposes them to molest children. This issue arose in the case &quot;Kansas v. Hendricks&quot;. In &quot;Hendricks&quot;, a man with a long history of sexually molesting children was scheduled to be released from prison shortly after the enactment of Kansas&#x27;s SVP act. Rather than being released, he was committed on the grounds that he had a mental abnormality. Hendricks contested the law on &quot;ex post facto&quot; and double jeopardy grounds. The Supreme Court of Kansas invalidated the Act, but the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the decision and ruled that the law was constitutional on the basis that the law did not impose a criminal punishment.

Another example is the Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban, where firearms prohibitions were imposed on those convicted of misdemeanor domestic-violence offenses and on subjects of restraining orders (which do not require criminal conviction). These individuals can now be sentenced to up to ten years in a federal prison for possession of a firearm, regardless of whether the weapon was legally possessed when the law was passed. The law has been legally upheld because it is considered regulatory, not punitive; it is a status offense.

Another example is the Copyright Term Extension Act which was retroactive since it affected both new works and existing ones, but it was upheld by decision Eldred v. Ashcroft. Also the Uruguay Round Agreement Act which restored copyright in foreign works, removing them from the public domain was also upheld by another decision, Golan v. Holder.

The US military also recognizes ex post facto law. Common law states that Courts-martial will not enforce an ex post facto law, including increasing amount of pay to be forfeited for specific crimes. (See United States v. Gorki 47 M.J. 370).

Finally, in &quot;Calder v. Bull&quot;, the court expressly stated that a law that &quot;mollifies&quot; a criminal act was merely retrospective, and was not an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law. Scholars have argued that, as a historical matter, the phrase &quot;ex post facto&quot; referred to civil as well as criminal laws.

In administrative law, federal agencies may apply their rules retroactively if Congress has authorized them to; otherwise, retroactive application is generally prohibited. Retroactive application of regulations is disfavored by the courts for several reasons. The courts uphold retroactive regulation where Congress has expressly granted such retroactive power to the agency, as they did in &quot;Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital&quot;.

The rules as they relate to the effects of &quot;ex post facto&quot; upon the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines can be found in .

=== Vietnam ===
&quot;Ex post facto&quot; laws is defined in Article 152, 2015 Law on Promulgation of Legal Documents:

# Only in cases of extreme necessity to ensure the common good of society, to exercise the rights and interests of organizations and individuals prescribed in laws and resolutions of the National Assembly, legal documents of central government rules are retroactive.
# The retroactive effect is prohibited in the following cases: a) Impose legal liability for acts that at the time of committing such acts the law does not stipulate liability; b) Impose higher legal liability.
# Legislative documents of People&#x27;s Councils, People&#x27;s Committees at all levels, local governments in special administrative-economic units are not retroactive.

There has been no case that new law stated it has a retroactive effect. But the second item of this Article has been widely used in court system (&quot;in mitus&quot; laws&quot;)&quot;.

==Treatment by international organizations and treaties==

===International criminal law===
In international criminal law, the Nuremberg trials prosecuted war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated in World War II. Although the Nuremberg Charter, the procedural law under which the trials were held, postdated V-E Day, the tribunal rejected the defence that the criminal law was &quot;ex post facto&quot;, arguing it derived from earlier treaties like the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. The International Criminal Court established in 2002 cannot prosecute crimes committed before 2002.

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related treaties===
Article 11, paragraph 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that no person be held guilty of any criminal law that did not exist at the time of offence nor suffer any penalty heavier than what existed at the time of offence. It does however permit application of either domestic or international law.

Very similar provisions are found in Article 15, paragraph 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, replacing the term &quot;penal offence&quot; with &quot;criminal offence&quot;. It also adds that if a lighter penalty is provided for after the offence occurs, that lighter penalty shall apply retroactively. Paragraph 2 adds a provision that paragraph 1 does not prevent trying and punishing for an act that was criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations. Specifically addressing the use of the death penalty, article 6, paragraph 2 provides in relevant part that a death sentence may only be imposed &quot;for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime&quot;.

===African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights===
Article 2, paragraph 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights provides in part that &quot;no one may be condemned for an act or omission which did not constitute a legally punishable offence at the time it was committed. No penalty may be inflicted for an offence for which no provision was made at the time it was committed.&quot;

===American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man===
Article 25 of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man provides in part that &quot;[n]o person may be deprived of his liberty except in the cases and according to the procedures established by pre-existing law.&quot; The right to be tried in accordance to &quot;pre-existing law&quot; is reiterated in article 26.

===Arab Charter on Human Rights===
Article 15 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights provides that &quot;[n]o crime and no penalty can be established without a prior provision of the law. In all circumstances, the law most favorable to the defendant shall be applied.&quot;

===European Convention on Human Rights===
Effectively all European states (except Belarus), including all European Union and European Economic Area states, are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 7 of the Convention mirrors the language of both paragraphs of Article 15 of the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, with the exception that it does not include that a subsequent lighter penalty must apply.

==Grammatical form and usage==
The &quot;Digesta Iustiniani&quot; (15.3.10.8.3, 20.1.22.pr2) (&quot;Digest of Justinian&quot;) contains the two-word phrase &quot;ex postfacto&quot;: &quot;out of a postfactum&quot; (an after-deed), or more naturally, &quot;from a law passed afterward&quot;. This same work, however, also makes use of the three-word phrase &quot;ex post facto&quot;, (2.14.17.4.2, 4.6.17.1.1, &quot;passim&quot;), suggesting that &quot;post&quot; might best be understood as an adverb. Other adverbial usages of &quot;post&quot; include the Classical Roman author and senator Marcus Tullius Cicero employing phrases such as &quot;multis post annis&quot; (&quot;De Re Publica&quot; 2.5.8 and elsewhere). Thus, &quot;ex post facto&quot; or &quot;ex postfacto&quot; is natively an adverbial phrase, a usage demonstrated by the sentence &quot;He was convicted &quot;ex post facto&quot; (from a law passed after his crime).&quot; The law itself would rightfully be a &quot;lex postfacta&quot; in Latin, although English generally uses the phrase &quot;an ex post facto law&quot;.

In Poland the phrase &quot;lex retro non agit&quot; (&quot;the law does not operate retroactively&quot;) is used.
