<text>The Cloisters, also known as the Met Cloisters, is a museum in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, New York City. The museum, situated in Fort Tryon Park, specializes in European medieval art and architecture, with a focus on the Romanesque and Gothic periods. Governed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it contains a large collection of medieval artworks shown in the architectural settings of French monasteries and abbeys. Its buildings are centered around four cloisters—the Cuxa, Saint-Guilhem, Bonnefont, and Trie—that were acquired by American sculptor and art dealer George Grey Barnard in France before 1913 and moved to New York. Barnard&#x27;s collection was bought for the museum by financier and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. Other major sources of objects were the collections of J. P. Morgan and Joseph Brummer.

The museum&#x27;s building was designed by the architect Charles Collens, on a site on a steep hill, with upper and lower levels. It contains medieval gardens and a series of chapels and themed galleries, including the Romanesque, Fuentidueña, Unicorn, Spanish, and Gothic rooms. The design, layout, and ambiance of the building are intended to evoke a sense of medieval European monastic life. It holds about 5,000 works of art and architecture, all European and mostly dating from the Byzantine to the early Renaissance periods, mainly during the 12th through 15th centuries. The objects include stone and wood sculptures, tapestries, illuminated manuscripts, and panel paintings, of which the best known include the Early Netherlandish &quot;Mérode Altarpiece&quot; and the –1505 Flemish &quot;Hunt of the Unicorn&quot; tapestries.

Rockefeller purchased the museum site in Washington Heights in 1930 and donated it to the Metropolitan in 1931. Upon its opening on May 10, 1938, the Cloisters was described as a collection &quot;shown informally in a picturesque setting, which stimulates imagination and creates a receptive mood for enjoyment&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
The basis for the museum&#x27;s architectural structure came from the collection of George Grey Barnard, an American sculptor and collector who almost single-handedly established a medieval art museum near his home in the Fort Washington section of Upper Manhattan. Although he was a successful sculptor who had studied at the Art Institute of Chicago, his income was not enough to support his family. Barnard was a risk taker and led most of his life on the edge of poverty. He moved to Paris in 1883 where he studied at the Académie des Beaux-Arts. He lived in the village of Moret-sur-Loing, near Fontainebleau, between 1905 and 1913, and began to deal in 13th- and 14th-century European objects to supplement his earnings. In the process he built a large personal collection of what he described as &quot;antiques&quot;, at first by buying and selling stand-alone objects with French dealers, then by the acquisition of &quot;in situ&quot; architectural artifacts from local farmers.
Barnard was primarily interested in the abbeys and churches founded by monastic orders from the 12th century. Following centuries of pillage and destruction during wars and revolutions, stones from many of these buildings were reused by local populations. A pioneer in seeing the value in such artifacts, Barnard was often met with hostility from local and governmental groups. Yet he was an astute negotiator who had the advantage of a professional sculptor&#x27;s eye for superior stone carving, and by 1907 he had built a high-quality collection at relatively low cost. Reputedly he paid $25,000 for the Trie buildings, $25,000 for the Bonnefort and $100,000 for the Cuxa cloisters. His success led him to adopt a somewhat romantic view of himself. He recalled bicycling across the French countryside and unearthing fallen and long-forgotten Gothic masterworks along the way. He claimed to have found the tomb effigy of Jean d&#x27;Alluye face down, in use as a bridge over a small stream. By 1914 he had gathered enough artifacts to open a gallery in Manhattan.
Barnard often neglected his personal finances, and was so disorganized that he often misplaced the origin or provenance of his purchases. He sold his collection to John D. Rockefeller Jr. in 1925 during one of his recurring monetary crises. The two had been introduced by the architect William W. Bosworth. Purchased for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the acquisition included structures that would become the foundation and core of the museum. Rockefeller and Barnard were polar opposites in both temperament and outlook and did not get along; Rockefeller was reserved, Barnard exuberant. The English painter and art critic Roger Fry was then the Metropolitan&#x27;s chief European acquisition agent and acted as an intermediary. Rockefeller eventually acquired Barnard&#x27;s collection for around $700,000, retaining Barnard as an advisor.

In 1927 Rockefeller hired Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., son of one of the designers of Central Park, and the Olmsted Brothers firm to create a park in the Fort Washington area. In February 1930 Rockefeller offered to build the Cloisters for the Metropolitan. Under consultation with Bosworth, he decided to build the museum at a site at Fort Tryon Park, which they chose for its elevation, views, and accessible but isolated location. The land and existing buildings were purchased that year from the C. K. G. Billings estate and other holdings in the Fort Washington area. The Cloisters building and adjacent gardens were designed by Charles Collens. They incorporate elements from abbeys in Catalonia and France. Parts from Sant Miquel de Cuixà, Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert, Bonnefont-en-Comminges, Trie-sur-Baïse and Froville were disassembled stone-by-stone and shipped to New York City, where they were reconstructed and integrated into a cohesive whole. Construction took place over a five-year period from 1934. In 1933, Rockefeller donated several hundred acres of the New Jersey Palisades clifftops across the river, which he had purchased over several years for the Palisades Interstate Park Commission to preserve the land from further development. The Cloisters&#x27; new building and gardens were officially opened on May 10, 1938, though the public was not allowed to visit until four days later.

===Early acquisitions===

Rockefeller financed the purchase of many of the early collection of works, often buying independently and then donating the items to the museum. His financing of the museum has led to it being described as &quot;perhaps the supreme example of curatorial genius working in exquisite harmony with vast wealth&quot;. The second major donor was the industrialist J. P. Morgan, founder of the Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York, who spent the last 20 years of his life acquiring artworks, &quot;on an imperial scale&quot; according to art historian Jean Strous, spending some $900 million (inflation adjusted) in total. After his death, his son J. P. Morgan Jr. donated a large number of works from the collection to the Metropolitan.

A further major early source of objects was the art dealer Joseph Brummer (1883–1947), long a friend of a curator at the Cloisters, James Rorimer. Rorimer had long recognized the importance of Brummer&#x27;s collection, and purchased large quantities of objects in the months after Brummer&#x27;s sudden death in 1947. According to Christine E. Brennan of the Metropolitan, Rorimer realized that the collection offered works that could rival the Morgan Collection in the Metropolitan&#x27;s Main Building, and that &quot;the decision to form a treasury at The Cloisters was reached... because it had been the only opportunity since the late 1920s to enrich the collection with so many liturgical and secular objects of such high quality.&quot; These pieces, including works in gold, silver, and ivory, are today held in the Treasury room of the Cloisters.

==Collection==
The museum&#x27;s collection of artworks consists of about 5,000 pieces. They are displayed across a series of rooms and spaces, mostly separate from those dedicated to the installed architectural artifacts. The Cloisters has never focused on building a collection of masterpieces; rather, the objects are chosen thematically yet arranged simply to enhance the atmosphere created by the architectural elements in the particular setting or room in which they are placed. To create the atmosphere of a functioning series of cloisters, many of the individual works, including capitals, doorways, stained glass, and windows are placed within the architectural elements themselves.

===Panel paintings and sculpture===

The museum&#x27;s best-known panel painting is Robert Campin&#x27;s c. 1425–28 &quot;Mérode Altarpiece&quot;, a foundational work in the development of Early Netherlandish painting, which has been at The Cloisters since 1956. Its acquisition was funded by Rockefeller and described at the time as a &quot;major event for the history of collecting in the United States&quot;. The triptych is well preserved with little overpainting, glossing, dirt layers, or paint loss. Other panel paintings in the collection include a Nativity triptych altarpiece attributed to a follower of Rogier van der Weyden, and the &quot;Jumieges panels&quot; by an unknown French master.

The 12th-century English walrus ivory Cloisters Cross contains more than 92 intricately carved figures and 98 inscriptions. A similar 12th-century French metalwork reliquary cross contains six sequences of engravings on either side of its shaft, and across the four sides of its lower arms. Further pieces of note include a 13th-century English &quot;Enthroned Virgin and Child&quot; statuette, a c. 1490 German statue of Saint Barbara, and an early 16th-century boxwood Miniature Altarpiece with the Crucifixion. Other significant works include fountains and baptismal fonts, chairs, aquamaniles (water containers in animal or human form), bronze lavers, alms boxes and playing cards.
The museum has an extensive collection of medieval European frescoes, ivory statuettes, reliquary wood and metal shrines and crosses, as well as examples of the very rare Gothic boxwood miniatures. It has liturgical metalwork vessels and rare pieces of Gothic furniture and metalwork. Many pieces are not associated with a particular architectural setting, so their placement in the museum may vary. Some of the objects have dramatic provenance, including those plundered from the estates of aristocrats during the French Revolutionary Army&#x27;s occupation of the Southern Netherlands. The Unicorn tapestries were for a period used by the French army to cover potatoes and keep them from freezing. The set was purchased by Rockefeller in 1922, and six of the tapestries hung in his New York home until they were donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1938.

===Illuminated manuscripts===

The museum&#x27;s collection of illuminated books is small but of exceptional quality. J.P. Morgan was a major early donor, but although his taste leaned heavily towards rare printed and illuminated books, he donated very few to the Metropolitan, instead preserving them at the Morgan Library. At the same time, the consensus within the Met was that the Cloisters should focus on architectural elements, sculpture and decorative arts to enhance the environmental quality of the institution, whereas manuscripts were considered more suited to the Morgan Library in lower Manhattan. The Cloisters&#x27; books are today displayed in the Treasury room, and include the French &quot;Cloisters Apocalypse&quot; (or &quot;Book of Revelation&quot;, c. 1330, probably Normandy), Jean Pucelle&#x27;s &quot;Hours of Jeanne d&#x27;Evreux&quot; (c. 1324–28), the &quot;Psalter of Bonne de Luxembourg&quot;, attributed to Jean Le Noir and the &quot;Belles Heures du Duc de Berry&quot; (c. 1399–1416) attributed to the Limbourg brothers. In 2015 the Cloisters acquired a small Netherlandish Book of Hours illuminated by Simon Bening. Each is of exceptional quality, and their acquisition was a significant achievement for the museum&#x27;s early collectors.

A coat of arms illustrated on one of the leaves of the &quot;Cloisters Apocalypse&quot; suggests it was commissioned by a member of the de Montigny family of Coutances, Normandy. Stylistically it resembles other Norman illuminated books, as well as some designs on stained glass, of the period. The book was in Switzerland by 1368, possibly at the abbey of Zofingen, in the canton of Aargau. It was acquired by the Met in 1968.

The &quot;Hours of Jeanne d&#x27;Evreux&quot; is a very small early Gothic book of hours containing 209 folios, of which 25 are full-page miniatures. It is lavishly decorated in grisaille drawings, historiated initials and almost 700 border images. Jeanne d&#x27;Évreux was the third wife of Charles IV of France, and after their deaths the book went into the possession of Charles&#x27; brother, Jean, duc de Berry. The use of grisaille (shades of gray) drawings allowed the artist to give the figures a highly sculptural form, and the miniatures contain structures typical of French Gothic architecture of the period. The book has been described as &quot;the high point of Parisian court painting&quot;, and evidence of &quot;the unprecedentedly refined artistic tastes of the time&quot;.

The &quot;Belles Heures&quot; is widely regarded as one of the finest extant examples of manuscript illumination, and very few books of hours are as richly decorated. It is the only surviving complete book attributed to the Limbourg brothers. Rockefeller purchased the book from Maurice de Rothschild in 1954, and donated it to the Metropolitan.

The very small &quot;Bonne de Luxembourg&quot; manuscript (each leaf 12.5 × 8.4 × 3.9 cm) is attributed to Jean le Noir, and noted for its preoccupation with death. It was commissioned for Bonne de Luxembourg, Duchess of Normandy, daughter of John the Blind and the wife of John II of France, probably at the end of her husband&#x27;s life, c. 1348–49. It was in a private collection for many years and thus known only through poor-quality photographic reproductions until acquired by the museum in 1969. Produced in tempera, grisaille, ink, and gold leaf on vellum, it had been rarely studied and was, until that point, misattributed to Jean Pucelle. Following its acquisition, it was studied by art historians, after which attribution was given to Le Noir.

===Tapestries===

While examples of textile art are displayed throughout the museum, there are two dedicated rooms given to individual series of tapestries, the South Netherlandish &quot;Nine Heroes&quot; () and Flemish &quot;The Hunt of the Unicorn&quot; (). The Nine Heroes room is entered from the Cuxa cloisters. Its 14th-century tapestries are among the earliest surviving examples of tapestry, and are thought to be the original versions following widely influential and copied designs attributed to Nicolas Bataille. They were acquired over twenty years, involving the purchase of more than 20 fragments which were then sewn together during a long reassembly process. The chivalric figures represent the scriptural and legendary Nine Worthies, who consist of three pagans (Hector, Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar), three Jews (Joshua, David and Judas Maccabeus) and three Christians (King Arthur, Charlemagne and Godfrey of Bouillon). Of these, five figures survive: Hector, Caesar, Joshua, David and Arthur. They have been described as representing &quot;in their variety, the highest level of a rich and powerful social structure of later fourteenth-century France&quot;.
The &quot;Hunt of the Unicorn&quot; room can be entered from the hall containing the &quot;Nine Heroes&quot; via an early 16th-century door carved with representations of unicorns. The unicorn tapestries consist of a series of large, colourful hangings and fragment textiles designed in Paris and woven in Brussels or Liège. Noted for their vivid colourization—dominated by blue, yellow-brown, red, and gold hues—and the abundance of a wide variety of flora, they were produced for Anne of Brittany and completed –1505. The tapestries were purchased by Rockefeller in 1922 for about one million dollars, and donated to the museum in 1937. They were cleaned and restored in 1998, and are now hung in a dedicated room on the museum&#x27;s upper floor.

The large &quot;Nativity&quot; panel (also known as &quot;Christ is Born as Man&#x27;s Redeemer&quot;) from , South Netherlandish (probably in Brussels), &quot;Burgos Tapestry&quot; was acquired by the museum in 1938. It was originally one of a series of eight tapestries representing the salvation of man, with individual scenes influenced by identifiable panel paintings, including by van der Weyden. It was badly damaged in earlier centuries: it had been cut into several irregular pieces and undergone several poor-quality restorations. The panel underwent a long restoration from 1971, undertaken by Tina Kane and Alice Blohm of the Metropolitan&#x27;s Department of Textile Conservation. It is today hung in the Late Gothic hall.

===Stained glass===

The Cloisters&#x27; collection of stained glass consists of around three hundred panels, generally French and Germanic and mostly from the 13th to early 16th centuries. A number are handmade opalescent glass, and most are characterized by vivid colors and often abstract designs and patterns; many have a devotional image as a centerpiece. The majority of these works are in the museum&#x27;s Boppard room, named after the Carmelite church of Saint Severinus in Boppard, near Koblenz, Germany. The collection&#x27;s pot-metal works (from the High Gothic period) highlight the effects of light, especially the transitions between darkness, shadow and illumination. The Met&#x27;s collection grew in the early 20th century when Raymond Picairn made acquisitions at a time when medieval glass was not highly regarded by connoisseurs, and was difficult to extract and transport.

Jane Hayward, a curator at the museum from 1969 who began the museum&#x27;s second phase of acquisition, describes stained glass as &quot;unquestioningly the preeminent form of Gothic medieval monumental painting&quot;. She bought c.1500 heraldic windows from the Rhineland, now in the Campin room with the &quot;Mérode Altarpiece&quot;. Hayward&#x27;s addition in 1980 led to a redesign of the room so that the installed pieces would echo the domestic setting of the altarpiece. She wrote that the Campin room is the only gallery in the Met &quot;where domestic rather than religious art predominates...a conscious effort has been made to create a fifteenth-century domestic interior similar to the one shown in [Campin&#x27;s] &quot;Annunciation&quot; panel.&quot;

Other significant acquisitions include late 13th-century grisaille panels from the Château de Bouvreuil in Rouen, glass work from the Cathedral of Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais at Sées, and panels from the Acezat collection, now in the Heroes Tapestry Hall.

==Exterior==

The building is set into a steep hill, and thus the rooms and halls are divided between an upper entrance and a ground-floor level. The enclosing exterior building is mostly modern, and is influenced by and contains elements from the 13th-century church at Saint-Geraud at Monsempron, France, from which the northeast end of the building borrows especially. It was mostly designed by the architect Charles Collens, who took influence from works in Barnard&#x27;s collection. Rockefeller closely managed both the building&#x27;s design and construction, which sometimes frustrated the architects and builders.

The building contains architecture elements and settings taken mostly from four French abbeys, which between 1934 and 1939 were transported, reconstructed, and integrated with new buildings in a project overseen by Collins. He told Rockefeller that the new building &quot;should present a well-studied outline done in the very simplest form of stonework growing naturally out of the rocky hill-top. After looking through the books in the Boston Athenaeum ... we found a building at Monsempron in Southern France of a type which would lend itself in a very satisfactory manner to such a treatment.&quot;

The architects sought to both memorialize the north hill&#x27;s role in the American Revolution and to provide a sweeping view over the Hudson River. Construction of the exterior began in 1935. The stonework, primarily of limestone and granite from several European sources, includes four Gothic windows from the refectory at Sens and nine arcades. The dome of the Fuentidueña Chapel was especially difficult to fit into the planned area. The east elevation, mostly of limestone, contains nine arcades from the Benedictine priory at Froville and four flamboyant French Gothic windows from the Dominican monastery at Sens, Burgundy.

===Cloisters===
====Cuxa====

Located on the south side of the building&#x27;s main level, the Cuxa cloisters are the museum&#x27;s centerpiece both structurally and thematically. They were originally erected at the Benedictine Abbey of Sant Miquel de Cuixà on Mount Canigou, in the northeast Spanish Pyrenees, which was founded in 878. The monastery was abandoned in 1791 and fell into disrepair; its roof collapsed in 1835 and its bell tower fell in 1839. About half of its stonework was moved to New York between 1906 and 1907. The installation became one of the first major undertakings by the Metropolitan after it acquired Barnard&#x27;s collection. After intensive work over the fall and winter of 1925–26, the Cuxa cloisters were opened to the public on April 1, 1926.
The quadrangle-shaped garden once formed a center around which monks slept in cells. The original garden seemed to have been lined by walkways around adjoining arches lined with capitals enclosing the garth. It is impossible now to represent solely medieval species and arrangements; those in the Cuxa garden are approximations by botanists specializing in medieval history. The oldest plan of the original building describes lilies and roses. Although the walls are modern, the capitals and columns are original and cut from pink Languedoc marble from the Pyrenees. The intersection of the two walkways contains an eight-sided fountain.

The capitals were carved at different points in the abbey&#x27;s history and thus contain a variety of forms and abstract geometric patterns, including scrolling leaves, pine cones, sacred figures such as Christ, the Apostles, angels, and monstrous creatures including two-headed animals, lions restrained by apes, mythic hybrids, a mermaid and inhuman mouths consuming human torsos. The motifs are derived from popular fables, or represent the brute forces of nature or evil, or are based on late 11th- and 12th-century monastic writings, such as those by Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153). The order in which the capitals were originally placed is unknown, making their interpretation especially difficult, although a sequential and continuous narrative was probably not intended. According to art historian Thomas Dale, to the monks, the &quot;human figures, beasts, and monsters&quot; may have represented the &quot;tension between the world and the cloister, the struggle to repress the natural inclinations of the body&quot;.

====Saint-Guilhem====

The Saint-Guilhem cloisters were taken from the site of the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert, and date from 804 AD to the 1660s. Their acquisition around 1906 was one of Barnard&#x27;s early purchases. The transfer to New York involved the movement of around 140 pieces, including capitals, columns and pilasters. The carvings on the marble piers and column shafts recall Roman sculpture and are coiled by extravagant foliage, including vines. The capitals contain acanthus leaves and grotesque heads peering out, including figures at the Presentation at the Temple, Daniel in the Lions&#x27; Den and the Mouth of Hell, and several pilasters and columns. The carvings seem preoccupied with the evils of hell. Those beside the mouth of hell contain representations of the devil and tormenting beasts, with, according to Young, &quot;animal-like body parts and cloven hoofs [as they] herd naked sinners in chains to be thrown into an upturned monster&#x27;s mouth&quot;.

The Guilhem cloisters are inside the museum&#x27;s upper level and are much smaller than originally built. Its garden contains a central fountain and plants potted in ornate containers, including a 15th-century glazed earthenware vase. The area is covered by a skylight and plate glass panels that conserve heat in the winter months. Rockefeller had initially wanted a high roof and clerestory windows, but was convinced by Joseph Breck, curator of decorative arts at the Metropolitan, to install a skylight. Breck wrote to Rockefeller that &quot;by substituting a skylight for a solid ceiling ... the sculpture is properly illuminated, since the light falls in a natural way; the visitor has the sense of being in the open; and his attention, consequently, is not attracted to the modern superstructure.&quot;

====Bonnefont====

The Bonnefont cloisters were assembled from several French monasteries, but mostly come from a late 12th-century Cistercian at Bonnefont-en-Comminges, southwest of Toulouse. The abbey was intact until at least 1807, and by the 1850s all of its architectural features had been removed from the site, often for decoration of nearby buildings. Barnard purchased the stonework in 1937. Today the Bonnefont cloisters contain 21 double capitals, and surround a garden that contains many features typical of the medieval period, including a central wellhead, raised flower beds and lined with wattle fences. The marbles are highly ornate and decorated, some with grotesque figures. The inner garden has been set with a medlar tree of the type found in &quot;The Hunt of the Unicorn&quot; tapestries, and is centered around a wellhead placed at Bonnefont-en-Comminges in the 12th century. The Bonnefont is on the upper level of the museum and gives a view of the Hudson River and the cliffs of the Palisades.

====Trie====

The Trie cloisters was compiled from two late 15th- to early 16th-century French structures. Most of its components came from the Carmelite convent at Trie-sur-Baïse in south-western France, whose original abbey, except for the church, was destroyed by Huguenots in 1571. Small narrow buttresses were added in New York during the 1950s by Breck. The rectangular garden hosts around 80 species of plants and contains a tall limestone cascade fountain at its center. Like those from Saint-Guilhem, the Trie cloisters have been given modern roofing.

The convent at Trie-sur-Baïse featured some 80 white marble capitals carved between 1484 and 1490. Eighteen were moved to New York and contain numerous biblical scenes and incidents from the lives of saints. Several of the carvings are secular, including those of legendary figures such as Saint George and the Dragon, the &quot;wild man&quot; confronting a grotesque monster, and a grotesque head wearing an unusual and fanciful hat. The capitals are placed in chronological order, beginning with God in the act of creation at the northwest corner, Adam and Eve in the west gallery, followed by the Binding of Isaac, and Matthew and John writing their gospels. Capitals in the south gallery illustrate scenes from the life of Christ.

===Gardens===
The Cloisters has three gardens: the Judy Black Garden at the Cuxa Cloister on the main level, and the Bonnefont and Trie Cloisters gardens on the lower level. They were laid out and planted in 1938 and contain a variety of rare medieval species, with a total of over 250 genera of plants, flowers, herbs and trees, making it one of the world&#x27;s most important collections of specialized gardens. The garden&#x27;s design was overseen by Rorimer during the museum&#x27;s construction. He was aided by Margaret B. Freeman, who conducted extensive research into the keeping of plants and their symbolism in the Middle Ages. Today the gardens are tended by a staff of horticulturalists; the senior members are also historians of 13th- and 14th-century gardening techniques.

==Interior==
===Gothic chapel===

The Gothic chapel is set on the museum&#x27;s ground level, and was built to display its stained glass and large sculpture collections. The entrance from the upper-level Early Gothic Hall is lit by stained glass double-lancet windows, carved on both sides and acquired from the church of La Tricherie, France. The ground level is entered through a large door at its east wall. This entrance begins with a pointed Gothic arch leading to high bayed ceilings, ribbed vaults and buttress. The three center windows are from the church of Sankt Leonhard, in southern Austria, from c. 1340. The glass panels include a depiction of Martin of Tours as well as complex medallion patterns. The glass on the east wall comes from Évron Abbey, Maine, and dates from around 1325. The apse contains three large sculptures by the main windows; two larger than life-size female saints dating from the 14th century, and a Burgundian Bishop dating from the 13th. The large limestone sculpture of Saint Margaret on the wall by the stairs dates to around 1330 and is from the church of in Lleida, Catalonia.
Each of the six effigies are supreme examples of sepulchral art. Three are from the in Catalonia. The monument directly facing the main windows is the c. 1248–67 sarcophagus of Jean d&#x27;Alluye, a knight of the crusades, who was thought to have returned from the Holy Land with a relic of the True Cross. He is shown as a young man, his eyes open, and dressed in chain armor, with his longsword and shield. The female effigy of a lady, found in Normandy, dates to the mid 13th century and is perhaps of Margaret of Gloucester. Although resting on a modern base, she is dressed in high contemporary aristocratic fashion, including a mantle, cotte, jewel-studded belt and an elaborate ring necklace brooch.

Four of the effigies were made for the Urgell family, are set into the chapel walls, and are associated with the church of Santa Maria at Castello de Farfanya, Catalonia, redesigned in the Gothic style for Ermengol X (died c. 1314). The elaborate sarcophagus of Ermengol VII, Count of Urgell (d. 1184) is placed on the left hand wall facing the chapel&#x27;s south windows. It is supported by three stone lions, and a grouping of mourners carved into the slab, which also shows Christ in Majesty flanked by the Twelve Apostles. The three other Urgell tombs also date to the mid 13th century, and may be of Àlvar of Urgell and his second wife, Cecilia of Foix, the parents of Ermengol X, and that of a young boy, possibly Ermengol IX, the only one of their direct line ancestors known to have died in youth. The slabs of the double tomb on the wall opposite Ermengol VII, contain the effigies of his parents, and have been slanted forward to offer a clear view of the stonework. The heads are placed on cushions, which are decorated with arms. The male&#x27;s feet rest on a dog, while the cushion under the woman&#x27;s head is held by an angel.

===Fuentidueña chapel===
The Fuentidueña chapel is the museum&#x27;s largest room, and is entered through a broad oak door flanked by sculptures that include leaping animals. Its centerpiece is the Fuentidueña Apse, a semicircular Romanesque recess built between about 1175 to 1200 at the Saint Joan church at Fuentidueña, Segovia. By the 19th century, the church was long abandoned and in disrepair. The chapel was acquired by Rockefeller for the Cloisters in 1931, following three decades of complex negotiation and diplomacy between the Spanish church and both countries&#x27; art-historical hierarchies and governments. It was eventually exchanged in a deal that involved the transfer of six frescoes from San Baudelio de Berlanga to the Prado, on an equally long-term loan. The structure was disassembled into almost 3,300 mostly sandstone and limestone blocks, each individually cataloged, and shipped to New York in 839 crates. It was reconstructed at the Cloisters in the late 1940s The build was large and complex enough that it required the demolition of the former &quot;Special Exhibition Room&quot;. The chapel was opened to the public in 1961, seven years after its installation had begun.
The apse consists of a broad arch leading to a barrel vault, and culminates with a half-dome. The capitals at the entrance contain representations of the Adoration of the Magi and Daniel in the lions&#x27; den. The piers show Martin of Tours on the left and the angel Gabriel announcing to The Virgin on the right. The chapel includes other, mostly contemporary, medieval artwork. They include, in the dome, a large fresco dating to between 1130 and 1150, from the Spanish Church of Sant Joan de Tredòs. The fresco&#x27;s colourization resembles a Byzantine mosaic and is dedicated to the ideal of Mary as the mother of God. Hanging within the apse is a crucifix made between about 1150 to 1200 for the in Astudillo, Spain. Its reverse contains a depiction of the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God), decorated with red and blue foliage at its frames. The exterior wall holds three small, narrow and stilted windows, which are nevertheless designed to let in the maximum amount of light. The windows were originally set within imposing fortress walls; according to the art historian Bonnie Young &quot;these small windows and the massive, fortress-like walls contribute to the feeling of austerity ... typical of Romanesque churches.&quot;

===Langon chapel===
The Langon chapel is on the museum&#x27;s ground level. Its right wall was built around 1126 for the Romanesque Cathédrale Notre-Dame-du-Bourg de Digne. The chapter house consists of a single aisle nave and transepts taken from a small Benedictine parish church built around 1115 at Notre Dame de Pontaut. When acquired, it was in disrepair, its upper level in use as a storage place for tobacco. About three-quarters of its original stonework was moved to New York.

The chapel is entered from the Romanesque hall through a doorway, a large, elaborate French Gothic stone entrance commissioned by the Burgundian court for Moutiers-Saint-Jean Abbey in Burgundy, France. Moutiers-Saint-Jean was sacked, burned, and rebuilt several times. In 1567, the Huguenot army removed the heads from the two kings, and in 1797 the abbey was sold as rubble for rebuilding. The site lay in ruin for decades and lost further sculptural elements until Barnard arranged for the entrances&#x27; transfer to New York. The doorway had been the main portal of the abbey, and was probably built as the south transept door.

Carvings on the elaborate white oolitic limestone doorway depict the Coronation of the Virgin and contains foliated capitals and statuettes on the outer piers; including two kings positioned in the embrasures and various kneeling angels. Carvings of angels are placed in the archivolts above the kings. The large figurative sculptures on either side of the doorway represent the early Frankish kings Clovis I (d. 511) and his son Chlothar I (d. 561). The piers are lined with elaborate and highly detailed rows of statuettes, which are mostly set in niches, and are badly damaged; most have been decapitated. The heads on the right-hand capital were for a time believed to represent Henry II of England. Seven capitals survive from the original church, with carvings of human figures or heads, some of which have been identified as historical persons, including Eleanor of Aquitaine.

===Romanesque hall===
The Romanesque hall contains three large church doorways, with the main visitor entrance adjoining the Guilhem Cloister. The monumental arched Burgundian doorway is from Moutier-Saint-Jean de Réôme in France and dates to c. 1150. Two animals are carved into the keystones; both rest on their hind legs as if about to attack each other. The capitals are lined with carvings of both real and imagined animals and birds, as well as leaves and other fauna. The two earlier doorways are from Reugny, Allier, and Poitou in central France. The hall contains four large early-13th-century stone sculptures representing the Adoration of the Magi, frescoes of a lion and a wyvern, each from the Monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza in north-central Spain. On the left of the room are portraits of kings and angels, also from the monastery at Moutier-Saint-Jean. The hall contains three pairs of columns positioned over an entrance with molded archivolts. They were taken from the Augustinian church at Reugny. The Reugny site was badly damaged during the French Wars of Religion and again during the French Revolution. Most of the structures had been sold to a local man, Piere-Yon Verniere, by 1850, and were acquired by Barnard in 1906.

===Treasury room===
The Treasury room was opened in 1988 to celebrate the museum&#x27;s 50th anniversary. It largely consists of small luxury objects acquired by the Met after it had built its initial collection, and draws heavily on acquisitions from the collection of Joseph Brummer. The rooms contain the museum&#x27;s collection of illuminated manuscripts, the French 13th-century arm-shaped silver reliquary, and a 15th-century deck of playing cards.

===Library and archives===
The Cloisters contains one of the Metropolitan&#x27;s 13 libraries. Focusing on medieval art and architecture, it holds over 15,000 volumes of books and journals, the museum&#x27;s archive administration papers, curatorial papers, dealer records and the personal papers of Barnard, as well as early glass lantern slides of museum materials, manuscript facsimiles, scholarly records, maps and recordings of musical performances at the museum. The library functions primarily as a resource for museum staff, but is available by appointment to researchers, art dealers, academics and students. The archives contain early sketches and blueprints made during the early design phase of the museum&#x27;s construction, as well as historical photographic collections. These include photographs of medieval objects from the collection of George Joseph Demotte, and a series taken during and just after World War II showing damage sustained to monuments and artifacts, including tomb effigies. They are, according to curator Lauren Jackson-Beck, of &quot;prime importance to the art historian who is concerned with the identification of both the original work and later areas of reconstruction&quot;. Two important series of prints are kept on microfilm: the &quot;Index photographique de l&#x27;art en France&quot; and the German &quot;Marburg Picture Index&quot;.

==Governance==
The Cloisters is governed by the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Metropolitan&#x27;s collections are owned by a private corporation of about 950 fellows and benefactors. The board of trustees comprise 41 elected members, several officials of the City of New York, and persons honored as trustees by the museum. The current chairman of the board is the businessman and art collector Daniel Brodsky, who was elected in 2011, having previously served on its Real Estate Council in 1984 as a trustee of the museum and Vice Chairman of the Buildings Committee.

==Acquisition and deaccessioning==
A specialist museum, the Cloisters regularly acquires new works and rarely sells or otherwise gets rid of them. While the Metropolitan does not publish separate figures for the Cloisters, the entity as a whole spent $39 million on acquisitions for the fiscal year ending in June 2012. The Cloisters seeks to balance its collection between religious and secular artifacts and artworks. With secular pieces, it typically favors those that indicate the range of artistic production in the medieval period, and according to art historian Timothy Husband, &quot;reflect the fabric of daily [medieval European] life but also endure as works of art in their own right&quot;. In 2011 it purchased the then-recently discovered &quot;The Falcon&#x27;s Bath&quot;, a Southern Netherlands tapestry dated c. 1400–1415. It is of exceptional quality, and one of the best preserved surviving examples of its type. Other recent acquisitions of significance include the 2015 purchase of a Book of Hours attributed to Simon Bening.

== Exhibitions and programs ==
The museum&#x27;s architectural settings, atmosphere, and acoustics have made it a regular setting both for musical recitals and as a stage for medieval theater. Notable stagings include &quot;The Miracle of Theophilus&quot; in 1942, and John Gassner&#x27;s adaption of &quot;The Second Shepherds&#x27; Play&quot; in 1954. Recent significant exhibitions include &quot;Small Wonders: Gothic Boxwood Miniatures&quot; which ran in the summer of 2017 in conjunction with the Art Gallery of Ontario and Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.

==Objects from the collection==
==In popular culture==
Since it opened in 1938, The Cloisters has been featured and referenced in many works of popular culture. One of the more prominent uses of the Cloisters as a setting took place in 1948, when director Maya Deren used its ramparts as a backdrop for her experimental film &quot;Meditation on Violence&quot;. That year, German director William Dieterle used the Cloisters as the location for a convent school in his film &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot;. The 1968 film &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot; used the site&#x27;s pathways and lanes for a scenic motorcycle chase. In the 2021 Steven Spielberg film &quot;West Side Story&quot;, Maria (Rachel Zegler) and Tony (Ansel Elgort) go to the Cloisters on a date.

<text>The University of Redlands is a private university headquartered in Redlands, California, United States. The university&#x27;s main, residential campus is situated on 160 acres (65 ha) near downtown Redlands. An additional eight regional locations throughout California largely provide programs for working adults.

==History==

===Founding===
While currently a secular institution, the University of Redlands&#x27; roots go back to the founding of two other American Baptist institutions, California College in Oakland, and Los Angeles University. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake damaged the finances of California College, a Baptist commission began exploring the liquidation of both institutions to develop a new institution in Southern California. The Reverend Jasper Newton Field, a Baptist pastor at Redlands, persuaded the Redlands Board of Trade to propose a donation of at least $100,000 and for an interdenominational campus on land donated by a K.C. Wells. On June 27, 1907, the Commission voted in favor of the Redlands proposal.

Ground was broken on April 9, 1909, on the hill where the administration building now stands. Nine founding faculty members held their first day of classes in the Redlands Baptist Church on September 30, 1909, with 39 students attending.

On January 27, 1910, the University of Redlands opened its physical doors by occupying the administration building. Bekins Hall and the President&#x27;s mansion were the only two other buildings completed. Now-university president Field was charged with further securing $200,000 for endowment, but the 1912 United States cold wave, which wiped out half the California citrus crop and severely damaged the local economy, made this impossible.

President Field resigned in 1914. Victor LeRoy Duke, dean and mathematics professor, became the next president. The southern California Baptist community initiated a campaign to raise $50,000 to clear outstanding debt. The following spring the Northern Baptist Education Board endorsed the school, promising to help raise an endowment.
By 1925, the faculty numbered 25, and student enrollment had increased to 465. Finances had improved to the extent that, with significant volunteer help, the university was able to erect 12 new buildings by the end of the decade. New dormitories, classrooms, a library, a gymnasium, and Memorial Chapel were built. A school of education was added. A developing alumni base also started to support the university. By 1928, the university&#x27;s endowment was $2.592 million, the fourth largest in the state and among the top ten percent of American universities.

===Great Depression===
By the beginning of 1932, the effects of the Great Depression started to be felt at the university. Enrollment soared, as there was no work to be found, but student indebtedness also increased exponentially, as well as the amount the university owed banks. Salaries were cut, and employees were laid-off. On March 3, 1933, President Duke died of a cerebral hemorrhage.

The administration of the university&#x27;s third president, Clarence Howe Thurber, soon ran afoul of ultra-conservative churches. Student members complained of a liberal attitude toward Baptist doctrine being taught at the campus. The later affair of William H. Roberts, a psychology professor who became the campaign manager of Upton Sinclair&#x27;s run for governor in 1934, also severely strained town and gown relations.

===During and after World War II===
The 1940s brought many changes to the University of Redlands particularly with the onset of direct U.S. involvement in World War II. As conscription and enlistments for the war depleted classes, courses were set up for the soldiers at Camp Haan and March Field.

The July 1, 1943, arrival of a Navy V-12 unit, composed of 631 men for officer candidate training, along with a civilian enrollment of 473 women and 110 men, was Redlands&#x27; largest enrollment ever, and gradually led to the easing of social restrictions. Military men were not required to attend chapel, and on New Year&#x27;s Eve the Marines clandestinely held the first impromptu dance ever on the campus. Two months later, the Navy held the first formal dance on the commons, and the trustees finally discarded the &quot;no dancing&quot; policy in 1945, after the Redlands V-12 unit had been disbanded.

The passage of the G.I. Bill further opened the doors at Redlands. By special action of Congress, housing units for 50 veterans&#x27; families (&quot;Vets&#x27; Village&quot;) were installed on campus. Of the 219 graduates of June 1949, 126 were veterans, 70 of whom were married.

The 1950s saw other changes. Fraternity houses were established for the first time, and other improvements were made to the university. The first Ph.D. ever granted by the university was received in 1957, by Milton D. Hunnex, in Philosophy.

Compulsory chapel attendance fell to the student militancy of the 1960s and 1970s. The seventh president of the university, Dr. Douglas Moore, was not Baptist. The school went some years without clergymen on the board of trustees.

Following Moore, James R. Appleton served as the eighth president of the University of Redlands for 18 years from 1987 to 2005.

Dr. Stuart Dorsey served as the ninth president of the University of Redlands from 2005 to 2010. During this period, the university opened the Center for the Arts, and renovated the Armacost Library, adding five computer laboratories and a café. Dr. Dorsey resigned his position on March 16, 2010, amid controversy over budget deficits and proposed cuts.

On March 17, 2010, the then-current chancellor and former president Dr. James R. Appleton was appointed for a two-year term.

In August 2012, Dr. Ralph Kuncl became the 11th president of the University of Redlands. As president, he has focused on expanding the internationalization of the university, raising its stature by bringing public intellectuals into campus residence as University Distinguished Fellows, leading a comprehensive campaign, and strengthening the university&#x27;s financial health.

In February 2019, the university announced an agreement in principle to acquire San Francisco Theological Seminary (SFTS) in a transaction that would preserve the secular nature of the university as a whole, while maintaining the historic religious affiliations of SFTS. The deal closed on July 1, 2019, creating a new U of R graduate school—the Graduate School of Theology—and a U of R campus in the Bay Area that hosts programming from both institutions.

In December 2022, the university announced that it would be acquiring the Presidio Graduate School in San Francisco. The merger is awaiting approval as of January 2024. Upon completion of the merger, the Presidio Graduate School will become part of the university&#x27;s School of Business and Society.

In January 2024, the university announced that it would be acquiring Woodbury University in Burbank.

==Organization==
Students at the university study in one of several schools and centers: College of Arts &amp; Sciences (including the Johnston Center for Integrative Studies, Conservatory of Music, and Center for Spatial Studies); School of Business (including the School of Continuing Studies); School of Education; and Graduate School of Theology.

===College of Arts and Sciences===
The College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) serves approximately 2,400 undergraduate students and 100 graduate students from 41 states and 28 countries.

The college has 187 full-time faculty members serving more than 50 major areas of study. Eighty-five percent of full-time faculty have a Ph.D. or terminal degree. The student-faculty ratio is approximately 13:1; the average class size is 19. Professors or instructors teach all courses and sections.

====Johnston Center for Integrative Studies====

Born in the midst of the Experiential Education Movement, Johnston College is an endowed college that began as an experiment in professor-student mentor relationships and a student-initiated, contract-driven education, and operated as an autonomous unit of the university for approximately 10 years. The first class of approximately 30 students graduated in 1972. The structure of the educational system was based on seminars (8–10 students), tutorials (3–8), and independent studies. In 1979, it was integrated into the College of Arts and Sciences as the Johnston Center for Individualized Studies. It operated under that name until the mid-1990s, when it was renamed the Johnston Center for Integrative Studies.

Today, about 200 Redlands students live and learn together in the Johnston complex, which includes two residence halls and five faculty offices. Students design their own majors in consultation with faculty and write contracts for their courses, for which they receive narrative evaluations in lieu of traditional grades.

====Conservatory of Music====
The University of Redlands Conservatory of Music (formerly the School of Music) was founded along with the university as its School of Fine Arts. It is today an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music, and its requirements for entrance and graduation comply with the standards of this accrediting organization.

Approximately 350 students study music with 13 full-time and 26 adjunct faculty. The School of Music offers Bachelor of Music (BM) degrees in composition, Performance, and Education; Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees in music; and Master of Music (MM) degrees.

Any University student may participate in musical activities through enrollment (usually by audition) in the University Choir, Chapel Singers, Madrigals, Wind Ensemble, Concert Band, Studio Jazz Band, Symphony Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, University Opera, and a variety of chamber music ensembles. Students are invited to register for private, group, or class lessons, available on all instruments and for voice.

In 2022, the School of Music officially became the Conservatory of Music, as part of the School of Performing Arts.

====Center for Spatial Studies====
The Center for Spatial Studies endeavors to create a spatially infused learning community at the University of Redlands, through faculty-student interaction, research, and community service.

===School of Business===
Founded in 1976 as the Alfred North Whitehead College for Lifelong Learning, the School of Business began as an experiment in providing educational services to working adults in locations throughout Southern California. It was one of the first successful ventures in quality education through off-site learning. It evolved to become the School of Business in 2001.

The School of Business currently has approximately 700 undergraduate students and close to 800 graduate students (2010), taught by 22 full-time and 46 adjunct professors. Classes are held at the Redlands campus as well as regional campuses in Burbank, Orange County, Rancho Cucamonga/Ontario, Riverside, Temecula, Torrance, and San Diego. Programs are also planned on the university&#x27;s new campus in Marin County, California.

===School of Education===
The oldest graduate division within the university, the School of Education was founded in 1924. As of 2006, it serves 516 students in graduate coursework, with 17 full-time professors and 30 adjunct professors.

Geared primarily to the working professional, the School also partners with the College of Arts and Sciences to offer undergraduates a chance to earn their teaching credential. The School offers master&#x27;s degrees in learning and teaching, curriculum and instruction, clinical mental health counseling, school counseling, educational administration, and higher education, as well a number of credentials: Preliminary Teaching Credential (multiple or single subject), Education Specialist Teaching Credential, Pupil Personnel Services Credential—School Counseling, Preliminary Administrative Services Credential (Tier 1), and Clear Administrative Services Credential (Tier II). In addition, a Doctorate in Leadership for Educational Justice (Ed.D.), the university&#x27;s only doctoral program, is grounded in theories of social justice and a commitment to ensuring equity for students from all backgrounds.

In 2001, the School of Education partnered with the Lewis Center for Educational Research in Apple Valley, California to offer Preliminary Teaching Credentials onsite and serve Apple Valley and the surrounding high desert communities. In 2008, the University of Redlands School of Education expanded to a second regional campus in Orange County. In 2012, the School began offering programs in Temecula and Rancho Cucamonga. Programs are also planned on the university&#x27;s new campus in Marin County, California.

===Graduate School of Theology===
The Graduate School of Theology is a multi-faith and interdisciplinary program that resulted from a merger between the San Francisco Theological Seminary and the University of Redlands on July 1, 2019. A member of the Graduate Theological Union (GTU), the Graduate School of Theology also provides its students with access to classes and resources from the GTU&#x27;s member and affiliate institutions.

==Academics==
The University of Redlands offers traditional undergraduate liberal arts degree programs within the College of Arts and Sciences, along with graduate programs in business, education, communicative disorders, music and geographic information systems. The Johnston Center for Integrative Studies offers customized degree programs for undergraduates, based upon a contract system and narrative evaluations.

===Ranking, admissions and retention===
In its 2021 rankings, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its Best Colleges ranked the University of Redlands as #5 in Regional Universities West, #3 in Best Colleges for Veterans, #47 in Top Performers on Social Mobility, and classified admission to the university as &quot;selective,&quot; with an acceptance rate of approximately 68% and a freshmen retention rate of 88%.

==Athletics==
Redlands competes in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC), which operates within NCAA Division III. Redlands was one of the founding members of the SCIAC in 1915 and is one of only two schools to have had continuous membership.

The university competes in 21 sports: ten men&#x27;s teams and eleven women&#x27;s teams. The men&#x27;s teams include: baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swim and dive, tennis, track and field, and water polo. The women&#x27;s teams include: basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swim and dive, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and water polo.

The mission of Bulldog Athletics is to provide student-athletes with an opportunity to compete successfully in an intercollegiate athletic program that is an integral part of their educational experience. About 20 percent of U of R&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences undergraduates are student-athletes; including intramural sports (which focus on recreational experiences) more than 50 percent of College of Arts and Sciences undergraduates participate in athletics. The average GPA of student-athletes is 3.2, and 90 percent of student-athletes return for their second year of study at the U of R. In addition to numerous championships, 70 percent of the university&#x27;s varsity teams have ranked in the top 25 nationally in NCAA Division III and SCIAC since 2009.

In 2018, the university embarked on a $20 million campaign for Bulldog Athletics to create a new home for the program on Brockton Avenue, build a new tennis complex, and revitalize the Currier Gymnasium.

===Mascot===
The Bulldogs are represented by a live bulldog mascot, a tradition dating back to 1918. The bulldogs name began not with a dog, but with a football game; in 1917, after Redlands embarrassed a rival school 20–0, the opposing coach was quoted as saying, &quot;The U of R football team might well be called the bulldogs of the conference for the fight they put into the game.&quot;

==Community service==
The university&#x27;s Community Service Learning program, which is now more than 25 years old, provides students the opportunity to extend their learning beyond the classroom in activities from mentoring local youths to building houses in Mexico. Each year, University of Redlands students complete more than 120,000 hours of service. These efforts have been recognized by the President&#x27;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Role.

==Campus housing==
The university, whose Redlands campus has been consistently honored by Arbor Day Foundation as a Tree Campus USA School, offers its undergraduate students guaranteed housing during their four years of study and, for the most part, undergraduate students are required live on campus. Exceptions include students who are over the age of 23, living with a parent, or married; sometimes exemptions are also granted to upperclass students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher.

Many residence halls are &quot;living-learning communities,&quot; with themes such as &quot;freshmen,&quot; &quot;social justice,&quot; &quot;substance-free,&quot; etc. These themes and configurations change from time to time.

==Transportation==
On October 24, 2022, the Arrow commuter rail service&#x27;s Redlands–University station opened on the southwest corner of campus, which provides daily rail connections to/from Los Angeles Union Station via the rest of the Metrolink commuter rail system.

==Greek life==
The university offers a Greek System, unaffiliated with national Greek organizations, which also contains several houses for residence by the groups&#x27; members.

==Diversity-based exchanges and organizations==
In October 2017, the University of Redlands partnered with Tuskegee University, a private, historically black university in Alabama, enabling student and faculty exchanges between the institutions and opening the door to a variety of other joint programming.

Diversity-based organizations on the University of Redlands campus include:

* Rangi Ya Giza (RYG) (founded on May 15, 1992): non-Greek, diversity based brotherhood that seeks to positively affect the campus and community by organizing service projects, raising awareness of local and global issues, and taking action against injustices in our society. Rangi Ya Giza is Swahili for &quot;A Darker Shade&quot; to represent their East African roots. RYG focuses specifically on benefiting organizations in the community such as Boys &amp; Girls Club of Redlands, Emmerton Elementary school, and the Stillman House.
* Wadada Wa Rangi Wengi (WRW) (founded on October 15, 1992): non-Greek sisterhood dedicated to raising awareness about issues of diversity, gender, and social injustice. Wadada Wa Rangi Wengi means &quot;Sisters of Many Shades&quot; in Swahili. WRW sponsors many events on campus, including Breast Cancer Awareness Week, Diversity Mixer, and Sexual Violence Awareness Week. (RYG and WRW were both founded in response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots.)
* Fidelity, Isonomy, Erudition (FIE) (founded on February 10, 2006): co-ed siblinghood that prides itself in its commitment to service and awareness, creating a more empathetic community, and combating a gender binary. Service, Awareness, and Siblinghood are the three pillars the organization&#x27;s members stand firm on. FIE was recognized as the university&#x27;s Multicultural Organization of the Year in 2006 &amp; 2010.

==Filming at Redlands==
Due to its location in the Greater Los Angeles Area, The University of Redlands campus has been used as the setting for films such as &quot;Goodbye My Fancy&quot;, with Joan Crawford and Robert Young, &quot;Hell Night&quot;, &quot;Joy Ride&quot;, &quot;Slackers&quot;, and &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;. It has also been used in at least one &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode as a stand-in for the fictional Euclid College. The campus was also used for the Korean drama &quot;The Heirs&quot;, where Kim Tan (Lee Min-ho) attends during his exile in America. Additionally, the music video for &quot;Spicy&quot; by the Korean music act Aespa was filmed on the campus. The 2023 film &quot;A Little White Lie&quot; was partially filmed on the campus and around the city of Redlands.

==Redlands culture and traditions==
* The &quot;R&quot;: This letter carved into the vegetation of the San Bernardino Mountains at 34°11′00″N 117°06′17″W started as prank in 1913, but still stands today and is currently the second-largest collegiate letter in the nation.
* Mascot: The university has a live bulldog who serves as its official mascot. The male pup George now holds the U of R mascot title. Histories are kept of the past and present bulldog mascots on the University of Redlands website.
* Commencement: The university holds its annual commencement ceremonies on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday in late April instead of May or June.

<text>John Davison Rockefeller Jr. (January 29, 1874 – May 11, 1960) was an American financier and philanthropist. Rockefeller was the fifth child and only son of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller. He was involved in the development of the vast office complex in Midtown Manhattan known as Rockefeller Center, making him one of the largest real estate holders in the city. Towards the end of his life, he was famous for his philanthropy, donating over $500 million to a wide variety of different causes, including educational establishments. Among his projects was the reconstruction of Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. He was widely blamed for having orchestrated the Ludlow Massacre and other offenses during the Colorado Coalfield War. Rockefeller was the father of six children: Abby, John III, Nelson, Laurance, Winthrop, and David.

==Early life==
John Davison Rockefeller Jr. was born on January 29, 1874, in Cleveland, Ohio. He was the fifth and youngest child of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia &quot;Cettie&quot; Spelman. His four older sisters were Elizabeth (Bessie), Alice (who died an infant), Alta, and Edith. Living in his father&#x27;s mansion at 4 West 54th Street, he attended Park Avenue Baptist Church at 64th Street (now Central Presbyterian Church) and the Browning School, a tutorial establishment set up for him and other children of associates of the family; it was located in a brownstone owned by the Rockefellers, on West 55th Street. His father John Sr. and uncle William Rockefeller Jr. co-founded Standard Oil together.

Initially, he had intended to go to Yale University but was encouraged by William Rainey Harper, president of the University of Chicago, among others, to enter the Baptist-oriented Brown University instead. Nicknamed &quot;Johnny Rock&quot; by his roommates, he joined both the Glee and the Mandolin clubs, taught a Bible class, and was elected junior class president. Scrupulously careful with money, he stood out as different from other rich men&#x27;s sons.

In 1897, he graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Arts, after taking nearly a dozen courses in the social sciences, including a study of Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. He joined the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.

==Business career==

After graduation from Brown, Rockefeller joined his father&#x27;s business in October 1897, setting up operations in the newly formed family office at 26 Broadway where he became a director of Standard Oil. He later also became a director at J. P. Morgan&#x27;s U.S. Steel company, which had been formed in 1901. Junior resigned from both companies in 1910 in an attempt to &quot;purify&quot; his ongoing philanthropy from commercial and financial interests after the Hearst media empire unearthed a bribery scandal involving John Dustin Archbold (the successor to Senior as head of Standard Oil) and two prominent members of Congress.

In September 1913, the United Mine Workers of America declared a strike against the Colorado Fuel and Iron (CF&amp;I) company in what would become the Colorado Coalfield War. Junior owned a controlling interest in CF&amp;I (40% of its stock) and sat on the board as an absentee director. In April 1914, after a long period of industrial unrest, the Ludlow Massacre occurred at a tent camp occupied by striking miners. At least 20 men, women, and children died in the attack. This was followed by nine days of violence between miners, strikebreakers, the Colorado National Guard. Although he did not order the attack that began this unrest, there are accounts to suggest Junior was mostly to blame for the violence, with the awful working conditions, death ratio, and no paid dead work which included securing unstable ceilings, workers were forced into working in unsafe conditions just to make ends meet. In January 1915, Junior was called to testify before the Commission on Industrial Relations. Many critics blamed Rockefeller for ordering the massacre. Margaret Sanger wrote an attack piece in her magazine &quot;The Woman Rebel&quot;, declaring, &quot;But remember Ludlow! Remember the men and women and children who were sacrificed in order that John D. Rockefeller Jr., might continue his noble career of charity and philanthropy as a supporter of the Christian faith.&quot;

He was at the time being advised by the pioneer public relations expert, Ivy Lee, and William Lyon Mackenzie King. Lee warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to listen closely to the grievances. This was novel advice and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized version of the Rockefellers. Mackenzie King said Rockefeller&#x27;s testimony was the turning point in Junior&#x27;s life, restoring the reputation of the family name; it also heralded a new era of industrial relations in the country.

During the Great Depression, he was involved in the financing, development, and construction of the Rockefeller Center, a vast office complex in midtown Manhattan, and as a result, became one of the largest real estate holders in New York City. He was influential in attracting leading blue-chip corporations as tenants in the complex, including GE and its then affiliates RCA, NBC and RKO, as well as Standard Oil of New Jersey (now ExxonMobil), Associated Press, Time Inc, and branches of Chase National Bank (now JP Morgan Chase).

The family office, of which he was in charge, shifted from 26 Broadway to the 56th floor of the landmark 30 Rockefeller Plaza upon its completion in 1933. The office formally became &quot;Rockefeller Family and Associates&quot; (and informally, &quot;Room 5600&quot;).

In 1921, Junior received about 10% of the shares of the Equitable Trust Company from his father, making him the bank&#x27;s largest shareholder. Subsequently, in 1930, Equitable merged with Chase National Bank, making Chase the largest bank in the world at the time. Although his stockholding was reduced to about 4% following this merger, he was still the largest shareholder in what became known as &quot;the Rockefeller bank&quot;. As late as the 1960s, the family still retained about 1% of the bank&#x27;s shares, by which time his son David had become the bank&#x27;s president.

In the late 1920s, Rockefeller founded the Dunbar National Bank in Harlem. The financial institution was located within the Paul Laurence Dunbar Apartments at 2824 Eighth Avenue near 150th Street, servicing a primarily African-American clientele. It was unique among New York City financial institutions in that it employed African Americans as tellers, clerks and bookkeepers as well as in key management positions. However, the bank folded after only a few years of operation.

==Philanthropy and social causes==
In a celebrated letter to Nicholas Murray Butler in June 1932, subsequently printed on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Rockefeller, a lifelong teetotaler, argued against the continuation of the Eighteenth Amendment on the principal grounds of an increase in disrespect for the law. This letter became an important event in pushing the nation to repeal Prohibition.

Rockefeller was known for his philanthropy, giving over $537 million to myriad causes over his lifetime compared to $240 million to his own family. He created the Sealantic Fund in 1938 to channel gifts to his favorite causes; previously his main philanthropic organization had been the Davison Fund. He had become the Rockefeller Foundation&#x27;s inaugural president in May 1913 and proceeded to dramatically expand the scope of this institution, founded by his father. Later he would become involved in other organizations set up by Senior: Rockefeller University and the International Education Board.

In the social sciences, he founded the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial in 1918, which was subsequently folded into the Rockefeller Foundation in 1929. A committed internationalist, he financially supported programs of the League of Nations and crucially funded the formation and ongoing expenses of the Council on Foreign Relations and its initial headquarters building in New York in 1921.

He established the Bureau of Social Hygiene in 1913, a major initiative that investigated such social issues as prostitution and venereal disease, as well as studies in police administration and support for birth control clinics and research. In 1924, at the instigation of his wife, he provided crucial funding for Margaret Sanger–who had previously been a personal opponent to him due to his treatment of workers–in her work on birth control and involvement in population issues. He donated $5,000 to her American Birth Control League in 1924 and a second time in 1925.

In the arts, he gave extensive property he owned on West 54th Street in Manhattan for the site of the Museum of Modern Art, which had been co-founded by his wife in 1929.

In 1925, he purchased the George Grey Barnard collection of medieval art and cloister fragments for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He also purchased land north of the original site, now Fort Tryon Park, for a new building, The Cloisters.

In November 1926, Rockefeller came to the College of William and Mary for the dedication of an auditorium built-in memory of the organizers of Phi Beta Kappa, the honorary scholastic fraternity founded in Williamsburg in 1776. Rockefeller was a member of the society and had helped pay for the auditorium. He had visited Williamsburg the previous March, when the Reverend Dr. W. A. R. Goodwin escorted him—along with his wife Abby, and their sons, David, Laurance, and Winthrop—on a quick tour of the city. The upshot of his visit was that he approved the plans already developed by Goodwin and launched the massive historical restoration of Colonial Williamsburg on November 22, 1927. Amongst many other buildings restored through his largesse was The College of William &amp; Mary&#x27;s Wren Building and the Episcopalian Bruton Parish Church.

In 1940, Rockefeller hosted Bill Wilson, one of the original founders of Alcoholics Anonymous, and others at a dinner to tell their stories. &quot;News of this got out on the world wires; inquiries poured in again and many people went to the bookstores to get the book, &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;.&quot; Rockefeller offered to pay for the publication of the book, but in keeping with AA traditions of being self-supporting, AA rejected the money.

Through negotiations by his son Nelson, in 1946 he bought for $8.5 million—from the major New York real estate developer William Zeckendorf—the land along the East River in Manhattan which he later donated for the United Nations headquarters. This was after he had vetoed the family estate at Pocantico as a prospective site for the headquarters (see Kykuit). Another UN connection was his early financial support for its predecessor, the League of Nations; this included a gift to endow a major library for the League in Geneva which today still remains a resource for the UN.

A confirmed ecumenicist, over the years he gave substantial sums to Protestant and Baptist institutions, ranging from the Interchurch World Movement, the Federal Council of Churches, the Union Theological Seminary, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York&#x27;s Riverside Church, and the World Council of Churches. He was also instrumental in the development of the research that led to Robert and Helen Lynd&#x27;s famous Middletown studies work that was conducted in the city of Muncie, Indiana, that arose out of the financially supported Institute of Social and Religious Research.

As a follow on to his involvement in the Ludlow Massacre, Rockefeller was a major initiator with his close friend and advisor William Lyon Mackenzie King in the nascent industrial relations movement; along with major chief executives of the time, he incorporated Industrial Relations Counselors (IRC) in 1926, a consulting firm whose main goal was to establish industrial relations as a recognized academic discipline at Princeton University and other institutions. It succeeded through the support of prominent corporate chieftains of the time, such as Owen D. Young and Gerard Swope of General Electric.

==Overseas philanthropy==
In the 1920s, he also donated a substantial amount towards the restoration and rehabilitation of major buildings in France after World War I, such as the Reims Cathedral, the Château de Fontainebleau and the Château de Versailles, for which in 1936 he was awarded France&#x27;s highest decoration, the Grand-Croix de la Legion d&#x27;honneur, which also was awarded decades later to his son David Rockefeller.

He also liberally funded the notable early excavations at Luxor in Egypt, and the American School of Classical Studies for excavation of the Agora and the reconstruction of the Stoa of Attalos, both in Athens; the American Academy in Rome; Lingnan University in China; St. Luke&#x27;s International Hospital in Tokyo; the library of the Imperial University in Tokyo; and the Shakespeare Memorial Endowment at Stratford-on-Avon.

In addition, he provided the funding for the construction of the Palestine Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem – the Rockefeller Museum – which today houses many antiquities and was the home of many of the Dead Sea Scrolls until they were moved to the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum.

==Conservation==
He had a special interest in conservation, and purchased and donated land for many American National Parks, including Grand Teton (hiding his involvement and intentions behind the Snake River Land Company), Mesa Verde National Park, Acadia, Great Smoky Mountains, Yosemite, and Shenandoah. In the case of Acadia National Park, he financed and engineered an extensive Carriage Road network throughout the park. Both the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway that connects Yellowstone National Park to the Grand Teton National Park and the Rockefeller Memorial in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park were named after him. He was also active in the movement to save redwood trees, making a significant contribution to Save the Redwoods League in the 1920s to enable the purchase of what would become the Rockefeller Forest in Humboldt Redwoods State Park. In 1930, Rockefeller helped the federal government extend Yosemite National Park&#x27;s boundary by by purchasing tracts held by timber companies for about $3.3 million. Rockefeller covered half of the cost.

In 1951, he established &quot;Sleepy Hollow Restorations&quot;, which brought together under one administrative body the management and operation of two historic sites he had acquired: Philipsburg Manor House in North Tarrytown, now called Sleepy Hollow (acquired in 1940 and donated to the Tarrytown Historical Society), and &quot;Sunnyside&quot;, Washington Irving&#x27;s home, acquired in 1945. He bought Van Cortland Manor in Croton-on-Hudson in 1953 and in 1959 donated it to Sleepy Hollow Restorations. In all, he invested more than $12 million in the acquisition and restoration of the three properties that were the core of the organization&#x27;s holdings. In 1986, Sleepy Hollow Restorations became &quot;Historic Hudson Valley&quot;, which also operates the current guided tours of the Rockefeller family estate of Kykuit in Pocantico Hills.

He is the author of the noted life principle, among others, inscribed on a tablet facing his famed Rockefeller Center: &quot;I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity, an obligation; every possession, a duty&quot;.

In 1935, Rockefeller received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal Award, &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.&quot; He was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1943.

==Family==
In August 1900, Rockefeller was invited by the powerful senator Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich of Rhode Island to join a party aboard President William McKinley&#x27;s yacht, the USS &quot;Dolphin&quot;, on a cruise to Cuba. Although the outing was of a political nature, Rockefeller&#x27;s future wife, philanthropist and socialite Abigail Greene &quot;Abby&quot; Aldrich, was included in the large party. The two had first met in the fall of 1894 and had been courting for over four years.

Rockefeller married Abby on October 9, 1901, in what was seen at the time as the consummate marriage of capitalism and politics. She was a daughter of Senator Aldrich and Abigail Pearce Truman &quot;Abby&quot; Chapman. Moreover, their wedding was the major social event of its time – one of the most lavish of the Gilded Age. It was held at the Aldrich Mansion at Warwick Neck, Rhode Island, and attended by executives of Standard Oil and other companies.

The couple had six children: Abby in 1903, John III in 1906, Nelson in 1908, Laurance in 1910, Winthrop in 1912, and David in 1915.

Abby died of a heart attack at the family apartment at 740 Park Avenue in April 1948. Junior remarried in 1951, to Martha Baird, the widow of his old college classmate Arthur Allen.

His sons, the five Rockefeller brothers, established an extensive network of social connections and institutional power over time, based on the foundations that Junior – and before him Senior – had laid down. David became a prominent banker, philanthropist and world statesman. Abby and John III became philanthropists. Laurance became a venture capitalist and conservationist. Nelson and Winthrop Rockefeller later became state governors; Nelson went on to serve as Vice President of the United States under President Gerald Ford.

==Death==
Rockefeller died of pneumonia on May 11, 1960, at the age of 86 in Tucson, Arizona, and was interred in the family cemetery in Tarrytown, with 40 family members present.

==Residences==
From 1901 to 1913, Junior lived at 13 West 54th Street in New York. Afterward, Junior&#x27;s principal residence in New York was the 9-story mansion at 10 West 54th Street, but he owned a group of properties in this vicinity, including Nos. 4, 12, 14 and 16 (some of these properties had been previously acquired by his father, John D. Rockefeller). After he vacated No. 10 in 1936, these properties were razed and subsequently all the land was gifted to his wife&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art. In that year he moved into a luxurious 40-room triplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue. In 1953, the real estate developer William Zeckendorf bought the 740 Park Avenue apartment complex and then sold it to Rockefeller, who quickly turned the building into a cooperative, selling it on to his rich neighbors in the building.

Years later, just after his son Nelson become Governor of New York, Rockefeller helped foil a bid by greenmailer Saul Steinberg to take over Chemical Bank. Steinberg bought Junior&#x27;s apartment for $225,000, $25,000 less than it had cost new in 1929. It has since been called the greatest trophy apartment in New York, in the world&#x27;s richest apartment building.

==Honors and legacy==
In 1929, Junior was elected an honorary member of the Georgia Society of the Cincinnati. In 1935, he received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.&quot; In 1939, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society under statute 12.

The John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library at Brown University, completed in 1964, is named in his honor.

<text>The Peacock Throne (Hindustani: &quot;Mayūrāsana&quot;, Sanskrit: मयूरासन, Urdu: تخت طاؤس, , &quot;Takht-i Tāvūs&quot;) was the imperial throne of Hindustan. The throne is named after the dancing peacocks at its rear and was the seat of the Mughal emperors of India from 1635 to 1739. It was commissioned in the early 17th century by Emperor Shah Jahan and was located in the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audiences, or Ministers&#x27; Room) in the Red Fort of Delhi. The original throne was taken as a war trophy by Nader Shah, Shah of Iran in 1739 after his invasion of India. Its replacement disappeared during or soon after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

== History ==
Shah Jahan ruled in what is now considered the Golden Age of the vast Mughal Empire, which covered almost all of the Indian subcontinent. He ruled from the newly constructed capital of Shahjahanabad. The emperor was the focus around which everything else revolved, giving audiences and receiving petitioners. The ruler&#x27;s court was to be a mirror image of paradise on earth, in the very center of the empire, and such a ruler would be worthy of a Throne of Solomon (تختِ سليمان, Takht-e-Sulaiman) to underscore his position as a just king. Like Solomon&#x27;s throne, the Peacock Throne was to be covered in gold and jewels, with steps leading up to it, with the ruler floating above the ground and closer to heaven. Said Gilani and his workers from the imperial goldsmiths&#x27; department were commissioned to construct this new throne. It took seven years to complete. Large amounts of solid gold, precious stones, and pearls were used, creating a masterful piece of Mughal artistry that was unsurpassed before or after its creation. It was an opulent indulgence that could only be seen by a few courtiers, aristocrats, and visiting dignitaries. The throne was, even by Golden Age Mughal standards, supremely extravagant, costing twice as much as the construction of the Taj Mahal.

The appearance of this new throne was in stark contrast to the older throne of Jahangir, a large rectangular slab of engraved black basalt constructed in the early 1600s, used by the father of Shah Jahan.

The new throne was not initially given the name by which it became known. It was known as the &quot;Jeweled Throne&quot; or &quot;Ornamented Throne&quot; (&quot;Takht-Murassa&quot;). It received its name from later historians because of the peacock statues featured on it.

The Peacock Throne was inaugurated in a triumphant ceremony on 22 March 1635, the formal seventh anniversary of Shah Jahan&#x27;s accession. The date was chosen by astrologers and was doubly auspicious, since it coincided exactly with Eid al-Fitr, the end of Ramadan, and Nowruz, the Persian New Year. The emperor and the court were returning from Kashmir, and it was determined that the third day of Nowruz would be the most auspicious day for him to enter the capital and take his seat on the throne.

Muhammad Qudsi, the emperor&#x27;s favourite poet, was chosen to compose twenty verses inscribed in emerald and green enamel on the throne. He praised the matchless skill of the artisans, the &quot;heaven-depleting grandeur&quot; of its gold and jewels, and included the date in the letters of the phrase &quot;the throne of the just king&quot;.

Poet Abu-Talib Kalim was given six pieces of gold for each verse in his poem of sixty-three couplets.

The emperor summoned master goldsmith Said Gilani and showered him with honours, including his weight in gold coins and the title &quot;Peerless Master&quot; (&quot;Bibadal Khan&quot;). Gilani produced a poem of 134 couplets, filled with chronograms, the first twelve couplets giving the date of the emperor&#x27;s birth, the following thirty-two the date of his first coronation, then ninety couplets giving the date of the throne&#x27;s inauguration.

After Shah Jahan&#x27;s death, his son Aurangzeb, who had the regnal name of Alamgir, ascended the Peacock Throne. Aurangzeb was the last of the strong Mughal emperors. After he died in 1707, his son Bahadur Shah I reigned from 1707 to 1712. Bahadur Shah I could keep the empire stable by maintaining a relaxed religious policy; however, after his death, the empire declined. A period of political instability, military defeats, and court intrigues led to a succession of weak emperors: Jahandar Shah ruled for one year from 1712 to 1713, Farrukhsiyar from 1713 to 1719, Rafi ud-Darajat and Shah Jahan II only for a couple of months in 1719. By the time Muhammad Shah came to power, Mughal power was seriously declining, and the empire was vulnerable. Nevertheless, under the generous patronage of Muhammad Shah, the court at Delhi became again a beacon of the arts and culture. Administrative reforms could not, however, stop the later Mughal-Maratha Wars, which significantly sapped the imperial forces. It was only a question of time until forces from neighbouring Persia saw their chance to invade.

Nader Shah&#x27;s invasion of the Mughal Empire culminated in the Battle of Karnal, on 13 February 1739, and the defeat of Muhammad Shah. Nadir Shah entered Delhi and sacked the city, in the course of which tens of thousands of inhabitants were massacred. Persian troops left Delhi at the beginning of May 1739, taking with them the throne as a war trophy. Their treasure haul amounted to a considerable reduction in Mughal wealth and an irreplaceable loss of cultural artefacts. Among the known precious stones that Nadir Shah looted were the Akbar Shah, Great Mughal, Great Table, Koh-i-Noor, and Shah diamonds, as well as the Samarian spinel and the Timur ruby. These stones were either part of the Peacock Throne or were in possession of the Mughal emperors. The Akbar Shah Diamond was said to form one of the eyes of a peacock, as did the Koh-i-Noor. The Shah diamond was described by Jean-Baptiste Tavernier as being on the side of the throne. Many of these stones ended up becoming part of the Persian crown jewels and, later, the British crown jewels as a result of Great Britain&#x27;s colonial expansion into the region.
When Nadir Shah was assassinated by his officers on 19 June 1747, the throne disappeared, most probably being dismantled or destroyed for its valuables, in the ensuing chaos. One of the unsubstantiated rumours claimed the throne was given to the Ottoman Sultan, although this could have been a minor throne produced in Persia and given as a gift. The Persian emperor Fath-Ali Shah commissioned the Sun Throne to be constructed in the early 19th century. The Sun Throne has a platform in the shape of that of the Peacock Throne. Some rumours claim that parts of the original Peacock Throne were used in its construction, although there is no evidence. Over time, the Sun Throne was erroneously called the Peacock Throne, a term the West later appropriated as a metonym for the Persian monarchy. No structural parts proven to be of the original Peacock Throne survived. Only some of the diamonds and precious stones attributed to it have survived and been re-worked.

A Sikh legend has it that a rectangular stone slab measuring by by was uprooted, enchained, and brought by Ramgarhia Misl chief Jassa Singh Ramgarhia to Ramgarhia Bunga, in Amritsar, after the capture of the Red Fort by the combined Dal Khalsa forces of Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, Jassa Singh Ramgarhia and Baghel Singh in 1783, as war booty. However, that this stone pedestal does indeed come from the Peacock Throne has not been independently corroborated by scientists and historians.

A replacement throne resembling the original was probably constructed for the Mughal emperor after the Persian invasion. The throne was located on the eastern side of the &quot;Divan-i-Khas&quot;, towards the windows. This throne, however, was also lost, possibly during or after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the subsequent looting and partial destruction of the Red Fort by the British. The marble pedestal on which it rested has survived and can still be seen today.

In 1908, the New York Times reported that Caspar Purdon Clarke, Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, obtained what was purported to be a marble leg from the pedestal of the throne. Although mentioned in the 1908 annual report, the status of this pedestal leg remains unknown. There is another marble leg in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Where precisely these two pedestal legs originate, and if they are connected to the Peacock Throne, remains unclear.

Inspired by the legend of the throne, King Ludwig II of Bavaria installed a romanticised version of it in his &quot;Moorish Kiosk&quot; in Linderhof Palace, constructed in the 1860s.

== Descriptions ==

The contemporary descriptions that are known today of Shah Jahan&#x27;s throne are from the Mughal historians Abdul Hamid Lahori and Inayat Khan, and the French travellers François Bernier and Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. No known painting of the throne that would match their descriptions exists.

=== By Abdul Hamid Lahori ===
Abdul Hamid Lahori (d. 1654) describes, in his &quot;Padshahnama&quot;, the construction of the throne:

=== By Inayat Khan ===
The following is the account given of the throne in the &quot;Shahjahannama&quot; of Inayat Khan:

=== By François Bernier ===
The French physician and traveller François Bernier described, in his &quot;Travels in the Mogul Empire A.D. 1656–1668&quot;, the throne in the &quot;Diwan-i-Khas&quot;:

=== By Jean-Baptiste Tavernier ===

The French jeweler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier made his sixth voyage to India between 1663 and 1668. It was his great privilege to be invited by emperor Aurangzeb himself to visit the court at Delhi, where he remained as Aurangzeb&#x27;s guest for two months, from 12 September 1665 to 11 November 1665.

Tavernier was invited so the emperor could inspect the jewels he had brought from the West, intending to purchase them. During this visit, Tavernier sold several jewels to the emperor and the emperor&#x27;s uncle, Jafar Khan, and established a close relationship with the emperor, leading to a more extended stay. Tavernier was invited to stay until the conclusion of the emperor&#x27;s annual birthday celebrations. During that time, he had the opportunity to visit the Red Fort and inspect the Peacock Throne. He was also allowed to inspect the valuable jewels and stones belonging to the emperor but could not see those still kept by Aurangzeb&#x27;s father, Shah Jahan, who was imprisoned at Agra Fort. In January 1666, only a few months after Tavernier&#x27;s stay, Shah Jahan died, and Aurangzeb claimed the remaining stones.

Tavernier gives a detailed description of the Peacock Throne in his book &quot;Les Six Voyages de J. B. Tavernier&quot;, published in 1676 in two volumes. The account of the throne appears in Chapter VIII of Volume II, in which he describes the preparations for the emperor&#x27;s annual birthday festival and the court&#x27;s magnificence. Tavernier is considered among the least reliable from a conventionally historical perspective.

Tavernier, however, describes seeing the throne in what is probably the &quot;Diwan-i-Am&quot;. One theory is that the throne was sometimes moved between the two halls, depending on the occasion. Tavernier also describes five other thrones in the &quot;Diwan-i-Khas&quot;.

== Discrepancies between descriptions of Lahori and Tavernier ==

The descriptions of Lahori, from before 1648, and Tavernier&#x27;s, published in 1676, are generally in broad agreement on the essential features of the thrones, such as its rectangular shape, standing on four legs at its corners, the 12 columns on which the canopy rests, and the type of gemstones embedded on the throne, such as balas rubies, emeralds, pearls, diamonds, and other coloured stones. There are, however, some significant differences between the two descriptions:

* Lahori&#x27;s account of the throne, based on the language used, could describe the projected design. Tavernier&#x27;s account of the throne seems to be an eyewitness observation during his 1665 visit to the Red Fort. It could be that there were differences between the projected and final designs of the throne that Shah Jahān ascended for the first time on 12 March 1635.
* According to Lahori, the throne was to have a length of 3 yards (9 feet) and a breadth of 2½ yards (7½ feet). Tavernier, however, gives the length at 6 feet and breadth of 4 feet. Lahori describes the height as 5 yards (15 feet), but Tavernier&#x27;s account does not mention its total height. Only the height of the four legs at the corners, about 2 feet, is mentioned.
* Lahori describes the canopy as being supported by 12 emerald columns; Tavernier describes 12 columns surrounded by and embedded with rows of pearls, which were round and of fine water and weighed 6 to 10 carats each. He thinks these pearls were, in fact, the most costly and precious aspect of the throne.
* A significant difference is the position of the eponymous peacock statues. Lahori states that on the top of each pillar, there were to be two peacocks, thick-set with gems, and between every two peacocks, a tree set with rubies and diamonds, emeralds, and pearls. If the reference to &quot;pillar&quot; here means &quot;column&quot; there would be 24 peacocks right round the throne. Tavernier, however, saw only a single large peacock above the quadrangular-shaped, dome-like canopy, with an elevated tail embedded with blue sapphires and other coloured stones; the body of the peacock is made of gold inlaid with precious stones, having a large ruby in front of the breast, from which hung a pear-shaped pearl around 60 carats in weight. Apart from the single large peacock, Tavernier&#x27;s account speaks of a large bouquet, representing many kinds of flowers, made of gold inlaid with precious stones, of the same height as the peacock, situated on either side of the peacock.
* According to Lahori, ascending the throne was by way of three steps, also set with jewels of fine water. Tavernier, however, describes four steps on the longer side of the throne embedded with the same types of gemstones used on the throne and with matching designs.

Apart from the significant differences between the two accounts given above, there are several details provided in Lahori&#x27;s account that are not mentioned in Tavernier&#x27;s, and vice versa.

=== Lahori&#x27;s description ===
* Lahori&#x27;s account mentions several historical diamonds that decorated the throne, such as the 186-carat Koh-i-Noor diamond, the 95-carat Akbar Shah diamond, the 88.77-carat Shah diamond, and the 83-carat Jahangir diamond, apart from the 352.50-carat Timur Ruby, the third-largest balas ruby in the world. Tavernier makes no mention of these most precious stones. One explanation is that when Tavernier saw the throne in 1665, all these historical diamonds and the balas ruby were in the possession of Shah Jahan, who was under house arrest at the Fort in Agra. Shah Jahan died on 22 January 1666—two months after Tavernier left Delhi, and reached Bengal, during this, his sixth, and last, voyage to India—and his son and successor Aurangzeb was able to claim all these gems. Lahori&#x27;s descriptions were made during the rule of Shah Jahan when all the gems were probably incorporated into the throne.
* According to Lahori, a twenty-couplet poem by Muhammad Qudsi praising Shah Jahan in emerald letters was embedded in the throne. Tavernier does not mention this in his account, either because of his inability to read and understand what was written or because Aurangzeb had ordered its removal.

=== Tavernier&#x27;s description ===
Tavernier was allowed to inspect the throne and its jewels closely and wrote the most well-known detailed description.

* In his account, Tavernier gave details of the design in which the balas rubies, emeralds, diamonds, and pearls were arranged on the four horizontal bars connecting the four vertical legs, from which the 12 vertical columns supporting the canopy arose. A large cabochon-cut balas ruby was placed in the middle of each bar, surrounded by four emeralds forming a square cross. Smaller such square crosses were situated on either side of the central large cross, along the length of the bar, but arranged in such a way that while in one square cross, a balas ruby occupied the center, surrounded by four emeralds, in the next square cross, four balas rubies surrounded an emerald. The emeralds were table-cut, and the intervals between the emerald-and-ruby crosses were covered with diamonds, also table-cut and not exceeding 10 to 12 carats in weight.
* There were three cushions or pillows upon the throne. The one behind the emperor&#x27;s back was large and round; the other two, placed at his sides, were flat. The cushions were also studded with gems.
* Tavernier mentioned some royal standards and weapons suspended from the throne, such as a mace, a sword, a round shield, a bow and quiver with arrows, all studded with gemstones.
* He counted the number of large balas rubies and emeralds on the throne. Accordingly, there were 108 large balas rubies on the throne, all cabochon-cut, the smallest weighing around 100 carats and the largest over 200 carats in weight. He counted 116 large emeralds on the throne, all of excellent colour but with many flaws (a characteristic feature of emeralds), the smallest weighing around 30 carats and the largest approximately 60 carats.
* The underside of the canopy was covered with diamonds and pearls, with a fringe of pearls all round.
* On the side of the throne facing the court was suspended a diamond of 80 to 90 carats in weight, with rubies and emeralds surrounding it. When the Emperor was seated on the throne, this suspended arrangement of jewels was in full view before him.
* Tavernier then wrote about two large gem-studded royal umbrellas, which were not part of the throne but were placed on either side at a distance of 4 feet from it. The central stems of these umbrellas, 7 to 8 feet long, were covered with diamonds, rubies, and pearls. The umbrella cloth was made of red velvet and embroidered and fringed all round with pearls. The height of these umbrellas might indicate the throne&#x27;s height, which was probably the same height. Thus, the height of the throne would have been around 7 to 10 feet.

== Later Peacock Throne ==
After Nadir Shah took the original, another throne was made for the Mughal emperor. Along with the Peacock Throne, Nadir had also taken the fabulous Koh-i Noor and Darya-i Noor diamonds to Persia, where some became part of the Persian crown jewels, and others were sold to the Ottomans. The plunder taken by Nadir was so great that he stopped taxation for three years. The bottom half of the Peacock Throne might have been converted into the Sun Throne, also a part of the Persian crown jewels. Various 19th-century Indian paintings of this later throne exist. It was located in the &quot;Diwan-i-Khas&quot; and might have been smaller than the original. However, the appearance would have been similar, based on either the original plans or from memory and eyewitness accounts. The replacement throne was made out of gold, or was gilded, and was studded with precious and semi-precious stones. Just like the original, it featured 12 columns. The columns carried a Bengali &quot;do-chala&quot; roof, which was graced with two peacock statues on the two ends, carrying pearl necklaces in their beaks and two peacocks at the top, also carrying pearl necklaces in their beaks. The two lower peacocks were in the center underneath a flower bouquet made of jewels or under a royal umbrella. A canopy of precious and colorful textiles and gold and silver threads protected this throne. The canopy was carried by four slender columns or beams made out of metal. Underneath the throne, colorful and precious carpets were laid out.

<doc id="299994" wikidata="Q114004148" url="?curid=299994" title="Westminster Hall">
<text>Westminster Hall is a medieval great hall which is part of the Palace of Westminster in London, England. It was erected in 1097 for William II (William Rufus), at which point it was the largest hall in Europe. The building has had various functions over the years, including being used for judicial purposes from the twelfth to the nineteenth centuries. When a joint address is given to the two chambers of the UK Parliament, the House of Commons and House of Lords, the hall is on rare occasions the venue. It is also used for special addresses by Parliament to the Monarch. It was used to host coronation banquets until 1821, and since the twentieth century has been the usual venue for the lyings in state of state and ceremonial funerals. 

The fabric of the hall is particularly notable for its hammerbeam roof, a form typical of English Gothic architecture which uses horizontal trusses to span large distances. The roof was commissioned for Richard II in 1393 and built by the royal carpenter, Hugh Herland. It is the largest clearspan medieval roof in England, measuring . At the same time the rest of the hall was remodelled by the master mason Henry Yevele. The renovations include eighty-three unique depictions of Richard&#x27;s favourite heraldic badge, a resting chained white hart.

== History ==
Westminster Hall has served numerous functions. Until the 19th century, it was regularly used for judicial purposes, housing three of the most important courts in the land: the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of Chancery. In the reign of Henry II (1154–1189) a royal decree established a fixed sitting of judges in the Hall. In 1215, Magna Carta stipulated that these courts would sit regularly in the Hall for the convenience of litigants. In 1875, the courts were amalgamated into the High Court of Justice, which continued to have chambers adjacent to Westminster Hall until moved to the then new Royal Courts of Justice building in 1882. In addition to regular courts, Westminster Hall also housed important state trials, including impeachment trials and the state trials of King Charles I at the end of the English Civil War, William Wallace, Thomas More, Cardinal John Fisher, Guy Fawkes, the Earl of Strafford, the rebel Scottish lords of the 1715 and 1745 uprisings, and Warren Hastings. On the night of 10 May 1941 at the height of the Blitz, the Palace of Westminster was showered with incendiary bombs. Scottish politician Walter Elliot happened to be nearby, and directed firefighters to prioritise saving the medieval Hall rather than the Chamber of the House of Commons, whose roof was also alight, and smashed through a door to the Hall with an axe so hoses could be brought in.

The St Stephen&#x27;s Porch end of the Hall displays under the stained glass window the Parliamentary War Memorial listing on eight panels the names of Members and staff of both Houses of Parliament and their sons killed serving in the First World War; the window itself, installed in 1952, commemorates members and staff of both Houses who died in the Second World War. In 2012, a new stained glass window commemorating Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s diamond jubilee was installed opposite this window, at the other end of the hall.

Westminster Hall has also served ceremonial functions. From the twelfth century to the nineteenth, coronation banquets honouring new monarchs were held here. The last coronation banquet was that of King George IV, held in 1821; his successor, William IV, abandoned the idea because he deemed it too expensive. Since the late 19th century, the Hall has been used as a place for lying in state during state and ceremonial funerals. Such an honour is usually reserved for the Sovereign and for their consorts; the only non-royals to receive it in the twentieth century were Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts (1914), the 48 victims of the crash of the airship R101 (1930) and Winston Churchill (1965). In 1910 the hall was used for the lying in state of King Edward VII, followed by King George V in 1936, King George VI in 1952, Queen Mary in 1953, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, and Queen Elizabeth II in 2022. Around 250,000 mourners filed past the coffin when Queen Elizabeth II lay in state, which resulted in the delamination of the Yorkstone floor.

The two Houses have presented ceremonial Addresses to the Crown in Westminster Hall on important public occasions. For example, Addresses were presented at Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee (1977), Golden Jubilee (2002) and Diamond Jubilee (2012), the Accession of Charles III (2022), the 300th anniversary of the Glorious Revolution (1988), and the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War (1995).

It is considered a rare privilege for a foreign leader to be invited to address both Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall. Since the Second World War, the only leaders to have done so have been French president Charles de Gaulle in 1960, South African president Nelson Mandela in 1996, Pope Benedict XVI in 2010, U.S. president Barack Obama in 2011, Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi in 2012, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2023. President Obama was the first US president to be invited to use the Hall for an address to Parliament and Aung San Suu Kyi was the first non-head of state to be given the accolade of addressing MPs and peers in Westminster Hall.

Following reforms in 1999, the House of Commons now uses the Grand Committee Room next to Westminster Hall as an additional debating chamber. (Although it is not part of the main hall, these are usually spoken of as Westminster Hall debates.) In contrast with the two main Chambers, in which the government and opposition benches directly face each other, the seating in the Grand Committee Room is laid out in a U-shape, a pattern meant to reflect the non-partisan nature of the debates there.

== Architecture ==

The hall is notable for its hammerbeam roof, which was commissioned for Richard II in 1393. It was built by the royal carpenter, Hugh Herland, and is considered &quot;the greatest creation of medieval timber architecture&quot; creating a single huge open space, with a dais at the end. Richard&#x27;s master builder Henry Yevele retained the original dimensions, refacing the walls, with fifteen life-size statues of kings placed in niches. The rebuilding had been begun by King Henry III in 1245, but by Richard&#x27;s time had been dormant for over a century. Included in Richard&#x27;s renovations are repetitions of his favourite heraldic badge – a white hart, chained, and in an attitude of rest – which is repeated eighty-three times, without any of them being an exact copy of another.

The largest clearspan medieval roof in England, Westminster Hall&#x27;s roof measures . Oak timbers for the roof came from royal woods in Hampshire and from parks in Hertfordshire and from that of William Crozier of Stoke d&#x27;Abernon, who supplied over 600 oaks in Surrey, among other sources; they were assembled near Farnham, Surrey, away. Accounts record the large number of wagons and barges which delivered the jointed timbers to Westminster for assembly.

The original design of the roof is a mystery. It is believed that, until the 13th or 14th century, carpenters were unable to create a roof significantly wider than the length of the timber available, yet no evidence of supporting columns has been found.

==&quot;New Dawn&quot;==
&quot;New Dawn&quot; is a glass artwork by Mary Branson, installed in Westminster Hall in 2016. It celebrates the campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage, and is illuminated with light levels changing according to the tidal level of the River Thames.

<text>The Parliamentary Estate is the land and buildings used by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The most notable part of the Parliamentary Estate is the Palace of Westminster, where the chambers of both houses of Parliament (the Commons and the Lords) are located. The oldest part of the Palace of Westminster is Westminster Hall, the historic core of the building; the present-day Palace of Westminster was built after a major fire in 1834 destroyed all of the palace except for Westminster Hall, the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft, the Cloisters and Chapter House of St Stephen&#x27;s, and the Jewel Tower. The palace includes two courtyards, the Old Palace Yard and New Palace Yard; the former dates to the time of Edward the Confessor, while the latter was built in 1097 on the orders of William II (Rufus).

The northern part of the Parliamentary Estate lies north of Bridge Street. It includes:

* Canon Row
* Parliament Street
* Derby Gate: formerly the Whitehall Club; houses office space for parliamentary staff and the Commons Library
* Norman Shaw North and Norman Shaw South: two 1890s buildings, both containing office space for members of Parliament (MPs) and their staff
* Portcullis House: an office building for MPs and staff, opened February 2001
* Richmond House and Richmond Terrace: became part of the Parliamentary Estate in January 2018

<doc id="299997" wikidata="Q757402" url="?curid=299997" title="Tanimbar corella">
<text>The Tanimbar corella (Cacatua goffiniana), also known as Goffin&#x27;s cockatoo or Tanimbar cockatoo, is a species of cockatoo endemic to forests of Yamdena, Larat, and Selaru, all islands in the Tanimbar Islands archipelago in Indonesia. It has been introduced to the Kai Islands, Indonesia, Puerto Rico, and Singapore. This species was only formally described in 2004, after it was discovered that the previous formal descriptions pertained to individuals of a different cockatoo species, Ducorps&#x27; or Solomons cockatoo (&quot;Cacatua ducorpsii&quot;). Tanimbar corellas are the smallest of the white cockatoos. It is classified as near threatened due to deforestation and cage-bird trade. It breeds well in captivity and a large avicultural population exists.

==Description==

Tanimbar corellas weigh, on average, about for females and for males. They are about from head to tail.

Like all members of the family Cacatuidae, the Tanimbar corella is crested, meaning it has a collection of feathers on its head that it can raise or lower. Its body is mainly covered with white feathers, with salmon- or pink-colored feathers between the beak and eyes. The deeper (proximal) parts of the crest feathers and neck feathers are also a salmon color, but the coloration here is hidden by the white color of the more superficial (distal) areas of these feathers. The underside of its wing and tail feathers exhibit a yellowish tinge. The beak is pale grey and the eye colour is brown in females and black in males. The males are slightly larger, but otherwise look similar to the females.

In captivity, Tanimbar corellas live up to 30 years, making them one of the shorter-lived cockatoo species.

==Breeding==
Not much is known about the breeding behaviour of this species in the wild. Their breeding season is unknown and little is known of their mating behaviors. Two or three eggs are laid per clutch.

Virtually all knowledge of this species&#x27; breeding habits comes from captive-bred populations. Aviculturists in the United Kingdom have reported that the Tanimbar corella breeds from late spring – with the eggs hatching before July after an incubation period around 28 days, the nest being attended to by both parents. The hen feeds her offspring for roughly three weeks after fledging. No courtship behavior was observed between cock and hen prior to mating.

==Conservation==

Due to ongoing habitat loss on Tanimbar, limited range, and illegal hunting, the Tanimbar corella is evaluated as near threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. In the 1970s, Japanese loggers ravaged the islands. Many of the dazed, disoriented birds were captured for the pet trade. Although many died from stress during shipment, a small silver lining may remain behind this ecological disaster, because many Tanimbar corellas have reproduced in captive-breeding programs. As such, more Tanimbar corellas are now in captivity than in the wild.

==Scientific naming==
Historically, the discovery of the species as &quot;Lophochroa goffini&quot; is attributed to Otto Finsch in 1863. It was named for Andreas Leopold Goffin, a friend of Finsch&#x27;s and apparently a Dutch naval lieutenant who died the same year at the age of 26.

In 2000, Finsch&#x27;s formal description of this species was found to be based on two specimens that actually belonged to an entirely different cockatoo species, Ducorps&#x27; or Solomons cockatoo (&quot;Cacatua ducorpsii&quot;). &quot;Cacatua goffini&quot; thus became a synonym for &quot;Cacatua ducorpsii&quot;, leaving this species without a proper scientific name and description. In 2004, the species was formally described as &quot;Cacatua goffiniana&quot;, maintaining the intent of Finsch to name a species of cockatoo after his friend. The new description is based on an individual collected from the Tanimbar Islands in 1923 by Dr. Felix Kopstein.

==In aviculture==

In aviculture, the parrot is widely known as Goffin&#x27;s cockatoo. Pet birds hand reared from hatching can imitate human speech, but generally they are not good talkers. They are generally quieter than the &quot;large cockatoos&quot;, but can still be quite loud, and they have a sharp screech that some find irritating.

Tanimbar corellas learn by watching and copying. Just by opening the cage door, a Tanimbar corella&#x27;s attention can be drawn to the latch on its cage and it can learn by trial and error how to open the latch with its beak and escape the cage in seconds. Tanimbar corellas can destroy furniture with their beaks and can chew through wires and cause potentially dangerous electrical incidents.

Hand-reared Tanimbar corellas tend to demand a lot of attention. Occasionally, captive birds of this species (like many cockatoos) develop self-destructive behaviours such as feather-plucking, or stereotypy if they do not have an interesting and enriching environment. Caged Tanimbar corellas require a frequent change of toys to play with so they do not become bored. They need time out of their cage for one-on-one social contact of at least four hours daily and also to exercise their wings and fly. Even very tame birds can bite humans when irritated or even when being excessively playful. Their droppings are semisolid and can be messy. The World Parrot Trust recommends that the Tanimbar corella be kept in an enclosure with a minimum length of 3 m. Many new bird owners are not aware of the time and money a cockatoo demands, and pet birds are often passed from one owner to the next or relinquished to animal shelters.

Tanimbar corella chicks make a repetitive soft howling/screeching noise (producer calls) when they are hungry.

In the UK, their sale is controlled as they are classified as a rare species (CITES Appendix I). The seller of each bird must have an official certificate to prove that it was captive-bred and not imported.

==Intelligence==

Experimental evidence from multiple studies appear to indicate that the Tanimbar corella possesses considerable intelligence. Tool-use behaviour has been observed by this species in captivity. It was reported in November 2012 by Professor Alice Auersperg of the University of Vienna that a male named Figaro was observed spontaneously shaping splinters of wood and small sticks to create rakes that were then used to extend his reach and retrieve otherwise unavailable food items located on the other side of his aviary mesh.

In July 2013, the results of a joint study involving scientists from University of Oxford, the University of Vienna, and the Max Planck Institute, again involving the Tanimbar corellas of the Vienna Goffin Lab, were announced. The birds were discovered to possess the ability to solve complex mechanical problems, in one case spontaneously working out how to open a five-part locking mechanism in sequence to retrieve a food item. The corellas were able to very quickly adapt their behaviour and again open the lock when the mechanism sections were modified or reordered, demonstrating an apparent concept of working towards a particular goal and knowledge of the way in which physical objects act upon each other – rather than merely an ability to repeat a learned sequence of actions. A 2022 study involving a golf-like task further demonstrated the Tanimbar corella&#x27;s problem-solving skills, with the cockatoos spontaneously figuring out how to use a stick to hit a marble into a designated hole to release a cashew nut reward. One bird (Figaro – also featured in the 2012 experiment) also devised a method of cheating the test, using his stick as a lever to lift and drop the test apparatus and trigger the cashew release mechanism.

A later experiment also conducted at the Vienna Goffin Lab by Prof. Auersperg and her team broadly adapted the Stanford marshmallow experiment for the Tanimbar corella, to investigate whether the birds were capable of self-control and of anticipating a delayed gain. The corellas were given the opportunity to exchange a favoured food item (in this case a pecan nut) for an even more desirable nut (a cashew), if they were only able to hold the first nut for a period of time and then return it to the human researcher&#x27;s hand uneaten – at which point the nuts would be exchanged. Although pecan nuts are normally consumed instantly, the corellas were able to resist the temptation to eat the nut for periods of time for up to 80 seconds, once aware that a cashew was also on offer. This behaviour (having also previously been demonstrated in corvids) further disproves the previous belief that birds are incapable of self-control. Further work by Auersperg&#x27;s team, published in November 2018, showed that the corellas could cut cardboard to length with their beak, to obtain a reward, but seemed unable to change the width of the tools, perhaps due to the physical limitations of their beaks.

Further research in 2020 by Auersperg&#x27;s team compared the problem-solving ability of the captive-bred corellas at the Goffin Lab with wild birds caught in Tanimbar and exposed to the same experimental conditions – in which the birds were placed in an &quot;innovation arena&quot; and presented a series of 20 different tasks (e.g. pressing a button, turning a wheel, pulling out a drawer, removing a twig, overturning a cup, opening a clip, etc.), in which they could choose to partake, to obtain a food reward. While the wild Goffins were less inclined to interact with the test apparatus, those that did solved the presented tasks at a similar rate to the captive-bred birds.

Wild corellas were also observed shaping sticks of different dimensions to create a series of tools, which enabled them to eat sea mango seeds.

A 2020 study concluded that the Tanimbar corella may be capable of developing reading-comprehension skills. In experimental conditions, a hen bird named Ellie demonstrated the ability to associate written words with images and spoken words with an accuracy of 94%, thus displaying orthographic processing, grapheme-phoneme correspondence, and semantic processing, three skills that are required for reading. Ellie also learned how to use a communication board on a tablet computer to express her wishes to researchers, touching symbols on the screen to request food items, drinks, activities, objects, and social interaction.

<text>Brighton is a town in Northumberland County, Ontario, Canada, approximately east of Toronto and west of Kingston. It is traversed by both Highway 401 and the former Highway 2. The west end of the Murray Canal that leads east to the Bay of Quinte is at the east end of the town.

Brighton later developed into primarily an agricultural community, specializing in the farming of apples and production of new apple types. However, in recent years, many of the original orchards in the area have been partially removed, to make way for the steadily growing population, and more profitable agricultural produce, such as wheat, corn and soybeans. In late September, Brighton is host to Applefest, its largest yearly festival.

The Municipality of Brighton (formed on January 1, 2001, through an amalgamation of the former Town of Brighton and Brighton Township) is home to over 12,108 inhabitants, with a higher than average percentage of those retired. This is common, as the quiet, clean and friendly atmosphere of many smaller towns near Lake Ontario tend to draw the elderly as popular places for retirement living.

Presqu&#x27;ile Provincial Park, just south of the town centre, is one of Brighton&#x27;s most popular attractions. The park is noted for bird-watching and other nature-oriented activities. Memory Junction Railway Museum, located in a former Grand Trunk station, has a collection of rail equipment and memorabilia.

==Communities==
Besides the town proper of Brighton, the municipality of Brighton comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities such as Carman, Codrington, Hilton, Spring Valley, Smithfield (partially); &quot;Butler Creek&quot;, &quot;Cankerville&quot;, &quot;Cedar Creek&quot;, &quot;Gosport&quot;, &quot;Orland&quot;, &quot;Presqui&#x27;le Point&quot;, &quot;Wade Corners&quot;.

==History==

The village of Brighton was incorporated on January 1, 1859. On December 1, 1980, it became a town.

The original Simpson house, at 61 Simpson Street, was built in 1850.

==The artificial island area of Brighton==
Part of the current Municipality of Brighton is on a separate artificial island. This is a consequence of the borders chosen when the Township of Brighton was created in 1851, and the excavation of the Murray Canal across the historic Isthmus of Murray. The Murray Canal opened in 1889.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Brighton had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Amherstview is an unincorporated community in the township of Loyalist, Ontario.

It is located on the north shore of Lake Ontario and has a population of approximately 7,959 as of 2016. It is adjacent to the city of Kingston and is considered part of the Greater Kingston area. Amherstview is named for Amherst Island, directly to the south in Lake Ontario. When the community was first established in the 1950s, the spelling was generally &quot;Amherst View&quot;.

Amherst is a common place name found in many parts of Canada commemorating Lord Jeffrey Amherst (1717–97), Field-Marshal of the British Army, Commander-in-Chief in North America, and Governor General of British North America from 1760 to 1763.

The community is the eastern end of the Loyalist Parkway, a stretch of Highway 33 that travels along Lake Ontario, in an area in which many United Empire Loyalists settled. Amherstview is home to Fairfield House which is itself situated in Fairfield Park on the shore of Lake Ontario. Fairfield House was constructed in 1793 by the Fairfield family who were among the first Loyalists to settle the area. It served as the family home and a portion of the building was also used as a tavern for some time. The impressive wood-frame building is now a museum exhibiting period artifacts and furniture and offering guided tours.

Since Amherstview is part of Loyalist Township, it has no legal boundaries. General boundaries are Lake Ontario to the south, the Canadian National rail line to the north, Coronation Boulevard to the east (the City of Kingston boundary), and Lennox and Addington County Road 6 to the west.

==Infrastructure==

Amherstview is home to the Henderson Recreation Centre. The centre houses a public library, a 25 m public swimming pool (currently closed for rebuilding), a skating arena and an outdoor soccer field. Amherstview is also home to the educational institutions Amherstview Public School and Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic School and Fairfield Elementary School, three elementary and middle schools composed of students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.

Public transportation between Amherstview and Kingston is provided by Kingston Transit.

==Media==

A 100% volunteer-run community radio station, Island Radio CJAI 101.3 FM, serves Amherstview in addition to various media outlets in nearby Kingston.

<text>In software and systems engineering, a use case is a potential scenario in which a system receives an external request (such as user input) and responds to it.
A use case is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as an &quot;actor&quot;) and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or another external system. In systems engineering, use cases are used at a higher level than within software engineering, often representing missions or stakeholder goals. The detailed requirements may then be captured in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) or as contractual statements.

== Definition ==

In software and systems engineering, the phrase use case is a polyseme with two senses:
# A usage scenario for a piece of software; often used in the plural to suggest situations where a piece of software may be useful.
# A potential scenario in which a system receives an external request (such as user input) and responds to it.
This article discusses the latter sense. 

== History ==

In 1987, Ivar Jacobson presented the first article on use cases at the OOPSLA&#x27;87 conference. He described how this technique was used at Ericsson to capture and specify requirements of a system using textual, structural, and visual modeling techniques to drive object-oriented analysis and design. Originally he had used the terms &quot;usage scenarios&quot; and &quot;usage case&quot; – the latter a direct translation of his Swedish term &quot;användningsfall&quot; – but found that neither of these terms sounded natural in English, and eventually he settled on &quot;use case&quot;.

In 1992 he co-authored the book &quot;Object-Oriented Software Engineering - A Use Case Driven Approach&quot;, which laid the foundation of the OOSE system engineering method and helped to popularize use cases for capturing functional requirements, especially in software development. In 1994 he published a book about use cases and object-oriented techniques applied to business models and business process reengineering.

At the same time, Grady Booch and James Rumbaugh worked at unifying their object-oriented analysis and design methods, the Booch method and Object Modeling Technique (OMT) respectively. In 1995 Ivar Jacobson joined them and together they created the Unified Modelling Language (UML), which includes use case modeling. UML was standardized by the Object Management Group (OMG) in 1997. Jacobson, Booch and Rumbaugh also worked on a refinement of the Objectory software development process. The resulting Unified Process was published in 1999 and promoted a use case driven approach.

Since then, many authors have contributed to the development of the technique, notably: Larry Constantine developed in 1995, in the context of usage-centered design, so called &quot;essential use-cases&quot; that aim to describe user intents rather than sequences of actions or scenarios which might constrain or bias the design of user interface; Alistair Cockburn published in 2000 a goal-oriented use case practice based on text narratives and tabular specifications; Kurt Bittner and Ian Spence developed in 2002 advanced practices for analyzing functional requirements with use cases; Dean Leffingwell and Don Widrig proposed to apply use cases to change management and stakeholder communication activities; Gunnar Overgaard proposed in 2004 to extend the principles of design patterns to use cases.

In 2011, Jacobson published with Ian Spence and Kurt Bittner the ebook &quot;Use Case 2.0&quot; to adapt the technique to an agile context, enriching it with incremental use case &quot;slices&quot;, and promoting its use across the full development lifecycle after having presented the renewed approach at the annual IIBA conference.

== General principle ==
Use cases are a technique for capturing, modeling, and specifying the requirements of a system. A use case corresponds to a set of behaviors that the system may perform in interaction with its actors, and which produces an observable result that contributes to its goals. Actors represent the role that human users or other systems have in the interaction.

In the requirement analysis, at their identification, a use case is named according to the specific user goal that it represents for its primary actor. The case is further detailed with a textual description or with additional graphical models that explain the general sequence of activities and events, as well as variants such as special conditions, exceptions, or error situations.

According to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), use cases belong to the scenario-based requirement elicitation techniques, as well as the model-based analysis, techniques. But the use cases also support narrative-based requirement gathering, incremental requirement acquisition, system documentation, and acceptance testing.

=== Variations ===
There are different kinds of use cases and variations in the technique:

* System use cases specify the requirements of a system to be developed. They identify in their detailed description not only the interactions with the actors but also the entities that are involved in the processing. They are the starting point for further analysis models and design activities. 
* Business use cases focus on a business organization instead of a software system. They are used to specify business models and business process requirements in the context of business process reengineering initiatives. 
* Essential use cases, also called abstract use cases, describe the potential intents of the actors and how the system addresses these, without defining any sequence or describing a scenario. This practice was developed with the aim of supporting the user-centric design and avoiding to induce bias about the user interface in the early stage of the system specifications. 
* Use Case 2.0 to adapt the technique for the context of agile development methods. This technique enriches the requirement-gathering practice with support for user-story narratives. It also provides use case &quot;slices&quot; to facilitate incremental elicitation of requirements and enable incremental implementation.

=== Scope ===
The scope of a use case can be defined by a subject and by goals:

* The subject identifies the system, sub-system, or component that will provide the interactions. 
* The goals can be structured hierarchically, taking into account the organizational level interested in the goal (e.g. company, department, user), and the decomposition of the user&#x27;s goal into sub-goals. The decomposition of the goal is performed from the point of view of the users, and independently of the system, which differs from traditional functional decomposition.  

=== Usage ===
Use cases are known to be applied in the following contexts:

* Object Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE), as driving element; 
* Unified Modeling Language (UML), as a behavioral modelling instrument; 
* Unified Software Development Process (UP) and its fore-runner, the IBM Rational Unified Process (RUP);
* up-front documentation of software requirements specification (SRS), as an alternative structure for the functional requirements;
* deriving the design from the requirements using the entity–control–boundary approach;
* and agile development.

== Templates ==

There are many ways to write a use case in the text, from &quot;use case brief&quot;, &quot;casual&quot;, &quot;outline&quot;, to &quot;fully dressed&quot; etc., and with varied templates. Writing use cases in templates devised by various vendors or experts is a common industry practice to get high-quality functional system requirements.

=== Cockburn style ===

The template defined by Alistair Cockburn in his book &quot;Writing Effective Use Cases&quot; has been one of the most widely used writing styles of use cases.

==== Design scopes ====

Cockburn suggests annotating each use case with a symbol to show the &quot;Design Scope&quot;, which may be black-box (internal detail is hidden) or white box (internal detail is shown). Five symbols are available:

Other authors sometimes call use cases at the Organization level &quot;Business use cases&quot;.

==== Goal levels ====

Cockburn suggests annotating each use case with a symbol to show the &quot;Goal Level&quot;; the preferred level is &quot;User-goal&quot; (or colloquially &quot;sea level&quot;).

Sometimes in text writing, a use case name followed by an alternative text symbol (! +, -, etc.) is a more concise and convenient way to denote levels, e.g. &quot;place an order!&quot;, &quot;login-&quot;.

==== Fully dressed ====

Cockburn describes a more detailed structure for a use case but permits it to be simplified when less detail is needed. His fully dressed use case template lists the following fields:

* Title: &quot;an active-verb goal phrase that names the goal of the primary actor&quot;
* Primary Actor
* Goal in Context
* Scope
* Level
* Stakeholders and Interests
* Precondition
* Minimal Guarantees
* Success Guarantees
* Trigger
* Main Success Scenario
* Extensions
* Technology &amp; Data Variations List

In addition, Cockburn suggests using two devices to indicate the nature of each use case: icons for design scope and goal level.

Cockburn&#x27;s approach has influenced other authors; for example, Alexander and Beus-Dukic generalize Cockburn&#x27;s &quot;Fully dressed use case&quot; template from software to systems of all kinds, with the following fields differing from Cockburn:

* Variation scenarios &quot;(maybe branching off from and maybe returning to the main scenario)&quot;
* Exceptions &quot;i.e. exception events and their exception-handling scenarios&quot;

==== Casual ====

Cockburn recognizes that projects may not always need detailed &quot;fully dressed&quot; use cases. He describes a Casual use case with the fields:

* Title (goal)
* Primary Actor
* Scope
* Level
* (Story): the body of the use case is simply a paragraph or two of text, informally describing what happens.

=== Fowler style ===

Martin Fowler states &quot;There is no standard way to write the content of a use case, and different formats work well in different cases.&quot; He describes &quot;a common style to use&quot; as follows:
* Title: &quot;goal the use case is trying to satisfy&quot;
* Main Success Scenario: numbered list of steps
** Step: &quot;a simple statement of the interaction between the actor and a system&quot;
* Extensions: separately numbered lists, one per Extension
** Extension: &quot;a condition that results in different interactions from .. the main success scenario&quot;. An extension from main step 3 is numbered 3a, etc.

The Fowler style can also be viewed as a simplified variant of the Cockburn template. This variant is called a user story.

Alistair Cockburn stated:

Martin Fowler stated:

== Actors ==
A use case defines the interactions between external actors and the system under consideration to accomplish a goal. Actors must be able to make decisions, but need not be human: &quot;An actor might be a person, a company or organization, a computer program, or a computer system—hardware, software, or both.&quot; Actors are always stakeholders, but not all stakeholders are actors, since they may &quot;never interact directly with the system, even though they have the right to care how the system behaves.&quot; For example, &quot;the owners of the system, the company&#x27;s board of directors, and regulatory bodies such as the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Insurance&quot; could all be stakeholders but are unlikely to be actors.

Similarly, a person using a system may be represented as a different actor because of playing different roles. For example, user &quot;Joe&quot; could be playing the role of a Customer when using an Automated Teller Machine to withdraw cash from his own account or playing the role of a Bank Teller when using the system to restock the cash drawer on behalf of the bank.

Actors are often working on behalf of someone else. Cockburn writes that &quot;These days I write &#x27;sales rep for the customer&#x27; or &#x27;clerk for the marketing department&#x27; to capture that the user of the system is acting for someone else.&quot; This tells the project that the &quot;user interface and security clearances&quot; should be designed for the sales rep and clerk, but that the customer and marketing department are the roles concerned about the results.

A stakeholder may play both an active and an inactive role: for example, a Consumer is both a &quot;mass-market purchaser&quot; (not interacting with the system) and a User (an actor, actively interacting with the purchased product). In turn, a User is both a &quot;normal operator&quot; (an actor using the system for its intended purpose) and a &quot;functional beneficiary&quot; (a stakeholder who benefits from the use of the system). For example, when user &quot;Joe&quot; withdraws cash from his account, he is operating the Automated Teller Machine and obtaining a result on his own behalf.

Cockburn advises looking for actors among the stakeholders of a system, the primary and supporting (secondary) actors of a use case, the system under design (SuD) itself, and finally among the &quot;internal actors&quot;, namely the components of the system under design.

== Business use case ==
In the same way that a use case describes a series of events and interactions between a user (or other types of Actor) and a system, in order to produce a result of value (goal), a business use case describes the more general interaction between a business system and the users/actors of that system to produce business results of value. The primary difference is that the system considered in a business use case model may contain people in addition to technological systems. These &quot;people in the system&quot; are called business workers. In the example of a restaurant, a decision must be made whether to treat each person as an actor (thus outside the system) or a business worker (inside the system). If a waiter is considered an actor, as shown in the example below, then the restaurant system does not include the waiter, and the model exposes the interaction between the waiter and the restaurant. An alternative would be to consider the waiter as a part of the restaurant system (a business worker) while considering the client to be outside the system (an actor).

== Visual modeling ==
Use cases are not only texts but also diagrams if needed. In the Unified Modeling Language, the relationships between use cases and actors are represented in use case diagrams originally based upon Ivar Jacobson&#x27;s Objectory notation. SysML uses the same notation at a system block level.

In addition, other behavioral UML diagrams such as activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, communication diagrams, and state machine diagrams can also be used to visualize use cases accordingly. Specifically, a System Sequence Diagram (SSD) is a sequence diagram often used to show the interactions between the external actors and the system under design (SuD), usually for visualizing a particular scenario of a use case.

Use case analysis usually starts by drawing use case diagrams. For agile development, a requirement model of many UML diagrams depicting use cases plus some textual descriptions, notes, or &quot;use case briefs&quot; would be very lightweight and just enough for small or easy project use. As good complements to use case texts, the visual diagram representations of use cases are also effective facilitating tools for the better understanding, communication, and design of complex system behavioral requirements.

== Examples ==

Below is a sample use case written with a slightly modified version of the Cockburn-style template. Note that there are no buttons, controls, forms, or any other UI elements and operations in the basic use case description, where only user goals, subgoals, or intentions are expressed in every step of the basic flow or extensions. This practice makes the requirement specification clearer and maximizes the flexibility of the design and implementation.

Use Case: Edit an article

Primary Actor: Member &quot;(Registered User)&quot;

Scope: a Wiki system

Level: ! &quot;(User goal or sea level)&quot;

Brief: &quot;(equivalent to a user story or an epic)&quot;

: The member edits any part (the entire article or just a section) of an article they are reading. Preview and changes comparison are allowed during the editing.

Stakeholders

Postconditions

: Minimal Guarantees:
: Success Guarantees:
:* The article is saved and an updated view is shown.
:* An edit record for the article is created by the system, so watchers of the article can be informed of the update later.

Preconditions:

: The article with editing enabled is presented to the member.

Triggers:

: The member invokes an edit request (for the full article or just one section) on the article.

Basic flow:

# The system provides a new editor area/box filled with all the article&#x27;s relevant content with an informative edit summary for the member to edit. If the member just wants to edit a section of the report, only the original content of the section is shown, with the section title automatically filled out in the edit summary.
# The member modifies the article&#x27;s content until the member is satisfied.
# The member fills out the edit summary, tells the system if they want to watch this article, and submits the edit.
# The system saves the article, logs the edit event, and finishes any necessary post-processing.
# The system presents the updated view of the article to the member.

Extensions:

2–3.

: a. Show preview:
:# The member selects &quot;Show preview&quot; which submits the modified content.
:# The system reruns step 1 with the addition of the rendered updated content for preview, and informs the member that his/her edits have not been saved yet, then continues.
: b. Show changes:
:# The member selects &quot;Show changes&quot; which submits the modified content.
:# The system reruns step 1 with the addition of showing the results of comparing the differences between the current edits by the member and the most recent saved version of the article, then continues.
: c. Cancel the edit:
:# The member selects &quot;Cancel&quot;.
:# The system discards any change the member has made, then goes to step 5.

4a. Timeout:

== Advantages ==

Since the inception of the agile movement, the user story technique from Extreme Programming has been so popular that many think it is the only and best solution for the agile requirements of all projects. Alistair Cockburn lists five reasons why he still writes use cases in agile development.

# The list of goal names provides the &quot;shortest&quot; summary of what the system will offer (even then user stories). It also provides a project planning skeleton, to be used to build initial priorities, estimates, team allocation, and timing.
# The main success scenario of each use case provides everyone involved with an agreement as to what the system will basically do and what it will not do. It provides the context for each specific line item requirement (e.g. fine-grained user stories), a context that is very hard to get anywhere else.
# The extension conditions of each use case provide a framework for investigating all the little, niggling things that somehow take up 80% of the development time and budget. It provides a look-ahead mechanism, so the stakeholders can spot issues likely to take a long time to get answers for. These issues can and should then be put ahead of the schedule so that the answers can be ready when the development team gets around to working on them.
# The use case extension scenario fragments provide answers to the many detailed, often tricky, and ignored business questions: &quot;What are we supposed to do in this case?&quot; It is a thinking/documentation framework that matches the if...then...else statement that helps the programmers think through issues. Except it is done at investigation time, not programming time.
# The full use case set shows that the investigators have thought through every user&#x27;s needs, every goal they have with respect to the system, and every business variant involved.

In summary, specifying system requirements in use cases have these apparent benefits compared with traditional or other approaches:

User focused

Use cases constitute a powerful, user-centric tool for the software requirements specification process. Use case modeling typically starts from identifying key stakeholder roles (&quot;actors&quot;) interacting with the system, and their goals or objectives the system must fulfill (an outside perspective). These user goals then become the ideal candidates for the names or titles of the use cases which represent the desired functional features or services provided by the system. This user-centered approach ensures that what has real business value and the user really want is developed, not those trivial functions speculated from a developer or system (inside) perspective.

Use case authoring has been an important and valuable analysis tool in the domain of User-Centered Design (UCD) for years.

Better communication

Use cases are often written in natural languages with structured templates. This narrative textual form (legible requirement stories), understandable by almost everyone, and complemented by visual UML diagrams fosters better and deeper communications among all stakeholders, including customers, end-users, developers, testers, and managers. Better communications result in quality requirements and thus quality systems delivered.

Quality requirements by structured exploration

One of the most powerful things about use cases resides in the formats of the use case templates, especially the main success scenario (basic flow) and the extension scenario fragments (extensions, exceptional and alternative flows). Analyzing a use case step by step from preconditions to postconditions, exploring and investigating every action step of the use case flows, from basic to extensions, to identify those tricky, normally hidden and ignored, seemingly trivial but realistically often costly requirements (as Cockburn mentioned above), is a structured and beneficial way to get clear, stable and quality requirements systematically.

Minimizing and optimizing the action steps of a use case to achieve the user goal also contribute to a better interaction design and user experience of the system.

Facilitate testing and user documentation

With content based upon an action or event flow structure, a model of well-written use cases also serves as excellent groundwork and valuable guidelines for the design of test cases and user manuals of the system or product, which is an effort-worthy investment up-front. There are obvious connections between the flow paths of a use case and its test cases. Deriving functional test cases from a use case through its scenarios (running instances of a use case) is straightforward.

== Limitations ==

Limitations of use cases include:

* Use cases are not well suited to capturing non-interaction-based requirements of a system (such as algorithm or mathematical requirements) or non-functional requirements (such as platform, performance, timing, or safety-critical aspects). These are better specified declaratively elsewhere.
* As there are no fully standard definitions of use cases, each project must form its own interpretation.
* Some use case relationships, such as &quot;extends&quot;, are ambiguous in interpretation and can be difficult for stakeholders to understand as pointed out by Cockburn (Problem #6)
* Use case developers often find it difficult to determine the level of user interface (UI) dependency to incorporate in a use case. While use case theory suggests that UI not be reflected in use cases, it can be awkward to abstract out this aspect of design, as it makes the use cases difficult to visualize. In software engineering, this difficulty is resolved by applying requirements traceability, for example with a traceability matrix. Another approach to associate UI elements with use cases is to attach a UI design to each step in the use case. This is called a use case storyboard.
* Use cases can be over-emphasized. Bertrand Meyer discusses issues such as driving system design too literally from use cases, and using use cases to the exclusion of other potentially valuable requirements analysis techniques.
* Use cases are a starting point for test design, but since each test needs its own success criteria, use cases may need to be modified to provide separate post-conditions for each path.
* Though use cases include goals and contexts, whether these goals and motivations behind the goals (stakeholders&#x27; concerns and their assessments including non-interaction) conflict or negatively/positively affect other system goals are subject of goal-oriented requirement modeling techniques (such as BMM, I*, KAOS and ArchiMate ARMOR).

== Misconceptions ==
Common misunderstandings about use cases are:

User stories are agile; use cases are not.

Agile and Scrum are neutral on requirement techniques. As the Scrum Primer states,

&quot; Product Backlog items are articulated in any way that is clear and sustainable. Contrary to popular misunderstanding, the Product Backlog does not contain &quot;user stories&quot;; it simply contains items. Those items can be expressed as user stories, use cases, or any other requirements approach that the group finds useful. But whatever the approach, most items should focus on delivering value to customers.&quot; Use case techniques have evolved to take Agile approaches into account by using use case slices to incrementally enrich a use case.

Use cases are mainly diagrams.

Craig Larman stresses that &quot;use cases are not diagrams, they are text&quot;.

Use cases have too much UI-related content.

As some put it,

&quot; Use cases will often contain a level of detail (i.e. naming of labels and buttons) which make it not well suited for capturing the requirements for a new system from scratch.&quot;

Novice misunderstandings. Each step of a well-written use case should present &quot;actor&quot; goals or intentions (the essence of functional requirements), and normally it should not contain any user interface details, e.g. naming of labels and buttons, UI operations, etc., which is a &quot;bad&quot; practice and will unnecessarily complicate the use case writing and limit its implementation.

As for capturing requirements for a new system from scratch, &quot;use case diagrams&quot; plus &quot;use case briefs&quot; are often used as handy and valuable tools, at least as lightweight as user stories. 

Writing use cases for large systems is tedious and a waste of time.

As some put it,

&quot; The format of the use case makes it difficult to describe a large system (e.g. CRM system) in less than several hundred pages. It is time-consuming and you will find yourself spending time doing an unnecessary amount of rework.&quot;

Spending much time writing tedious use cases which add no or little value and result in a lot of rework is a &quot;bad smell&quot; indicating that the writers are not well skilled and have little knowledge of how to write quality use cases both efficiently and effectively. Use cases should be authored in an iterative, incremental, and evolutionary (&quot;agile&quot;) way. Applying use case templates does not mean that all the fields of a use case template should be used and filled out comprehensively from up-front or during a special dedicated stage, i.e. the requirement phase in the traditional &quot;waterfall&quot; development model.

In fact, the use case formats formulated by those popular template styles, e.g. the RUP&#x27;s and the Cockburn&#x27;s (also adopted by the OUM method), etc., have been proved in practice as valuable and helpful tools for capturing, analyzing and documenting complex requirements of large systems. The quality of a good use case documentation (&quot;model&quot;) should not be judged largely or only by its size. It is possible as well that a quality and comprehensive use case model of a large system may finally evolve into hundreds of pages mainly because of the inherent complexity of the &quot;problem&quot; in hand, not because of the poor writing skills of its authors. 

== Tools ==
Text editors and/or word processors with template support are often used to write use cases. For large and complex system requirements, dedicated use case tools are helpful.

Some of the well-known use case tools include:

* CaseComplete
* Enterprise Architect
* MagicDraw
* Rational Software&#x27;s RequisitePro - one of the early, well-known use case and requirement management tools in the 1990s.
* Software Ideas Modeler
* Wiki software - good tools for teams to author and manage use cases collaboratively.

Most UML tools support both the text writing and visual modeling of use cases.

<doc id="300007" wikidata="Q372717" url="?curid=300007" title="Tower of the Winds">
<text>The Tower of the Winds, known as the Ωρολόγιο του Κυρρήστου in Greek, and by other names, is an octagonal Pentelic marble tower in the Roman Agora in Athens, named after the eight large reliefs of wind gods around its top. Its date is uncertain, but was completed by about 50 BC, at the latest, as it was mentioned by Varro in his &quot;De re Rustica&quot; of about 37 BC. It is &quot;one of the very small number of buildings from classical antiquity that still stands virtually intact&quot;, as it has been continuously occupied for a series of different functions. 

Formerly topped by a wind vane, it is the only surviving horologium or clock tower from classical antiquity. It also housed a large water clock and incorporated sundials placed prominently on its exterior faces; &quot;citizens were thus able by using this building to orient themselves in space and time. Architecture, sculpture and the new science were perfectly integrated&quot;. 

According to A. W. Lawrence, &quot;the originality of this building is exceptional, and of a character out of keeping with Hellenistic architecture as we know it ... the design is obviously Greek, both in the severity of decorative treatment and in the antiquated method of roofing. The contrast with work of the Roman Empire is extraordinary, considering the date&quot;, which is long after the Roman conquest of Greece.

==Names==
The English name &quot;Tower of the Winds&quot;personified on the building as the Anemoiis ultimately a calque of the ancient Greek name &quot;Pýrgos tōn Anémōn&quot; (). 
It has also been known as the Horologium in Latin, the term used by Varro, or Horologion (, &quot;Hōrológion&quot;), from &quot;hṓra&quot; (, &quot;time period, hour&quot;) &quot;lógos&quot; (, &quot;writing, recording&quot;) + &quot;-ion&quot; (), together usually meaning a sundial, clepsydra, or other timekeeping device but here used to describe the location housing them.

It is now known in Greek as the &quot;Blowing Winds&quot; (, &quot;Aérides&quot;) and as the &quot;Clock of Cyrrestes&quot; (, &quot;Orológio tou Kyrrístou&quot;).

==Design==

Raised on three steps, the Tower of the Winds is tall and has a diameter of about . In antiquity, Vitruvius tells us it was topped by a bronze statue of a Triton, holding a rod that acted as a weather vane indicating the wind direction; this has completely disappeared. The frieze has reliefs, rather over life-size, of the eight wind deities—Boreas (N), Kaikias (NE), Apeliotes (E), Eurus (SE), Notus (S), Livas (SW), Zephyrus (W), and Skiron (NW)—there are eight sundials. A cornice above is decorated with lions&#x27; heads in relief, functioning as water spouts. 

Inside, there is a single large room. From ancient mentions by Varro and Vitruvius, it seems that time was measured by a water clock, driven by water coming down from the Acropolis. There are holes and channels in the floor relating to this, but the mechanism, presumably of metal and wood, has gone. Research has shown that the considerable height of the tower was motivated by the intention to place the sundials and the wind-vane at a height visible from the Agora, effectively making it an early example of a clocktower. 
It had two porches with pediments, supported by two Corinthian columns at the front, now disassembled, though the lower parts of three columns remain in place. At least as they are now, they have no bases, unusual in the Corinthian. There also seem to be the earliest use of small versions of formal columns for porches, later a very common feature. The roofs of the porches probably used wood, the only parts of the building to do so, and eventually collapsed. Parts of the stone pediment of one may be seen set up beside the tower.

These columns had capitals of a design now sometimes known as &quot;Tower of the Winds Corinthian&quot;, a &quot;late variant form&quot; lacking the volutes ordinarily found in Corinthian capitals. The capital on the roof, which supported the Triton weather-vane, used the same form; the broken lower part of this remains in place. None of these have survived complete, but there are enough fragments to make a confident reconstruction. There is a single row of acanthus leaves at the bottom of the capital, with a row of &quot;tall, narrow leaves&quot; behind. These cling tightly to the swelling shaft, and are sometimes described as &quot;lotus&quot; leaves, as well as the vague &quot;water-leaves&quot; and palm leaves; their similarity to leaf forms on many ancient Egyptian capitals has been remarked on. The form is found in smaller columns, both ancient and modern. The porch of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, Queen Street, Edinburgh, has four examples, but conventional Corinthian capitals are used elsewhere in the building. 

To the rear a &quot;turret&quot; held the water for the clock; only part of this has survived. The main roof is essentially original (exceptionally rare in an ancient building), with 24 triangular stone slabs, carved on the outside to look like tiles; here rows of modern standard rounded roof tiles now cover the joins. Inside eight very small columns, less than four feet high but with richly carved shafts, stand at each corner of the octagon, on a circular cornice, running up to a circular architrave.

==Functionality==
Andronicus of Cyrrhus, the designer, seems to have written a book on the winds. A passage in Vitruvius&#x27;s chapter on town planning in his &quot;On Architecture&quot; (&quot;De architectura&quot;) seems to be based on this missing book. The emphasis is on planning street orientations to maximize the benefits, and minimize the harms, from the various winds. 

The London Vitruvius, the oldest surviving manuscript, includes only one of the original illustrations, a rather crudely drawn octagonal wind rose in the margin. This was written in Germany in about 800 to 825, probably at the abbey of Saint Pantaleon, Cologne.

Although often described as a clocktower, it is not clear if, or how, the readings on the water clock inside could be communicated to people outside the building; it may have been necessary to go inside. The sundials on each face are individually customised to allow for the very differing times of the day that they were in direct sunlight. There was a further sundial on the turret at the back; the further parts of the lines can still be seen. 

The bronze gnomons (shadow-creating rods) had disappeared, but the holes for them remained, and modern replacements have been fitted. The straight lines engraved in the stone, from which the hours were taken, were originally painted and would have stood out more clearly. The ancient Greeks divided the day, when it was light, into twelve equal &quot;hours&quot; regardless of the time of year. The east and west faces only have four lines each, for the hours that face was in sunlight, whereas the south facing one has eight.
The turret at the back was a water tank, fed from a spring on the Athens acropolis above. A valve mechanism allowed water to flow into the clock mechanism via a channel cut in the floor; it may also have branched into two other channels to the side. The central mechanism was surrounded by circular railings, fitted into depressions in the floor that remain. It was apparently possible to walk around the clock and see it from all angles. There have been various attempts to reconstruct on paper how the clock worked, but this remains uncertain. 

It may have been an astronomical clock, showing a calendar, and the movements of the major star groups. The Antikythera mechanism, the only ancient Greek clock mechanism to partially survive, found in a shipwreck, is of this type. The roof has traces of blue paint, and may have depicted the sky in some way, even been some form of planetarium; there were no windows in the original building. it is carved differently from the outside, to give a smooth shallow dome.

Later, the water supply was converted from underground pipes to a small aqueduct, the last section of which partially remains next to the tower. The large, slightly curving, channel in the floor leading from the turret tank to the central hole may also have been added at this point.

==The eight reliefs of the winds==
The Greeks had long had various theories on the number of classical compass winds, but eight was by this period the usual number. The anemoi were named and regarded as minor deities. The large reliefs characterize each wind in terms of the things they carry, and often spill out from containers, the warmth of their clothing, and to some extent their physiques and expressions. All have large wings and are male, but of differing ages. These representations of the winds are the largest known from antiquity. They were originally painted, and had various extra elements in other materials, probably bronze. Their names are carved above them; these are now hard to read from the ground, with the modern metal restraining cable passing through them.

In the table the prints are illustrations from the first volume of &quot;The Antiquities of Athens&quot; (London, 1762), and the start of the descriptions of the winds are given. The tower was one of only five ancient Greek buildings given a full treatment in this work. It had been surveyed and drawn by James &quot;Athenian&quot; Stuart and Nicholas Revett on an expedition in 1751–54, and the engravings were by James Basire (later the master of William Blake) back in London. These clearly tidy up the worn reliefs, but were also recorded when they had over 250 years less exposure to weather than today.

==History==

According to Vitruvius and Varro, the astronomer Andronicus of Cyrrhus designed the Tower of the Winds. But very little is known about his life, not even whether he came from the Cyrrhus in Macedonia or the larger Seleucid city (named after it) on the Euphrates. From the style of the sculptures the tower is usually dated around 50 BC, not long before Varro and Vitruvius mention it. An alternative possibility is that it was part of the generosity of Attalus III of Pergamon (d. 131 BC) who built the Stoa of Attalus in the city. This would place it earlier than the rest of the Roman forum, and explain how such an expensive build was financed. 

If the usual dating is correct, it formed part of the reconstruction of Athens after it was mostly levelled by the Roman legions under Sulla in following the Siege of Athens and Piraeus during the First Mithridatic War.
From a cross on an inside wall, and traces of paintings, the building was probably used as a martyrium for an apostle, church or baptistry in late antiquity. By the time of Ottoman rule it was buried up to half its height, and traces of this can be observed in the interior, where Turkish inscriptions may be found on the walls. It was fully excavated in the 19th century by the Archaeological Society of Athens. The idea that there was an Athens Mevlevi Convent or its ritual hall in the Tower and that the other buildings belonging to the Convent were located around it is incorrect. The Tower, which was converted into a Qadirî tekke sometime between 1749 and 1751, was used by Qadirî dervishes to perform their religious rituals for 70 years between 1751 and 1821, and was evacuated after the Greek revolt of 1821.

The building became better known outside Greece from 1762, when a description and several careful measured engraved illustrations were published in London in the first volume of &quot;The Antiquities of Athens&quot;. The tower was one of only five ancient Greek buildings given a full treatment in this important work. It had been surveyed by James &quot;Athenian&quot; Stuart and Nicholas Revett on an expedition in 1751–54. When it was seen by them the dervishes operated on a wooden floor built above the rubble of the ancient floor level, which Stuart and Revett were allowed to remove temporarily. They had cut out a mihrab in the wall, which starts just above the lower cornice, slightly above the level of their wooden floor.

By this point depictions and early photographs show that the surrounding ground level had risen by several feet, and entry was by a sort of trench around part of the building. In the later 19th and 20th centuries the surrounding area was cleared of modern buildings and excavated, restoring the original ground level around most of the building. 

The Athens Ephorate of Antiquities performed restoration work, cleaning and conserving the structure, between 2014 and 2016.

==Ancient octagonal buildings==

By far the most famous ancient octagonal building was the Pharos of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, which partly survived long enough to be described by Islamic writers. This began with a square plan, but had an octagonal middle section below a final circular one. The octagonal middle would have been considerably larger than the Athens tower, and the tower must have suggested the Pharos to ancient visitors. The Pharos was also decorated with statues of Tritons, usually shown at the top of the octagonal section on coins, and perhaps one on each of the eight sides, but it is not known whether it showed interest in the winds, or had sundials, a weather-vane or a clock.

The Pharos dates to the 3rd century BC, perhaps around 270 BC, as does a much smaller mausoleum further along the coast at Abusir, which seems to be a scaled down version, as it also rises through square, octagonal and round sections, though with very different proportions between the heights of the sections.

==Legacy==
Several buildings are based, often very loosely, on the design of the Towers of the Winds, including:

* The 18th-century Tower of the Winds on top of the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford, England, 
* The Temple of the Winds, which stands in the grounds of Mount Stewart near Newtownards in Northern Ireland, designed by James &quot;Athenian&quot; Stuart who had studied and published the original.
* St Pancras Church (1822) designed by William Inwood and his son Henry William Inwood, located in Euston, London. This is a unique Greek-revival church, that features two sets of Caryatids and a tower that was based on the classical Tower of the Winds.
* The Daniel S. Schanck Observatory (1865) an early astronomical observatory at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
* The mausoleum of the founder of the Greek National Library Panayis Vagliano at West Norwood Cemetery, London. 
* The 15th-century Torre del Marzocco in Livorno.
* The tower on St Luke&#x27;s Church, West Norwood, in London, designed by Francis Octavius Bedford after he visited Athens on a Society of Dilettanti scholarship circa 1810.
* A similar tower in Sevastopol, built in 1849. 
* The Carnaby Temple near Carnaby, East Riding of Yorkshire, built in 1770.
* The Maitland Robinson building in Downing College, Cambridge, designed by Quinlan Terry in 1992.
*The &quot;Storm Tower&quot; in Bude, Cornwall (1835), by George Wightwick
*The upper part of the Tempio della Vittoria, a memorial in Milan to the fallen in WWI (adjacent to the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, 
*The chapel of the Flanders Field American Cemetery built in 1930 in Waregem, Belgium, by Paul Cret.
* The &quot;Four Winds&quot; brick chimney of the former hydraulic power station beside Glasgow Harbour at Prince&#x27;s Dock, Glasgow, designed by Burnet, Son and Campbell and built in 1894 for the Clyde Navigation Trust.
* The Temple of the Winds at West Wycombe Park in Buckinghamshire, dating from the late 18th century.

<text>Gananoque ( )
is a town in the Leeds and Grenville area of Ontario, Canada. The town had a population of 5,383 year-round residents in the 2021 Canadian Census, as well as summer residents sometimes referred to as &quot;Islanders&quot; because of the Thousand Islands in the Saint Lawrence River, Gananoque&#x27;s most important tourist attraction. The Gananoque River flows through the town and the St. Lawrence River serves as the southern boundary of the town.

== Pronunciation ==
The town&#x27;s name is an Indigenous name which means &quot;town on two rivers&quot;. The town&#x27;s name rhymes with the place name &quot;Cataraqui&quot;, which appears in the Cataraqui River, the Little Cataraqui Creek, and the Cataraqui Cemetery in nearby Kingston, Ontario. One way to remember its pronunciation is &quot;The right way, the wrong way, and the Gananoque&quot;. In eastern Ontario speech, the town name is often abbreviated to &quot;Gan&quot;.

== History ==
Colonel Joel Stone, who served with Loyalist militia during the American Revolutionary War, established a settlement on this site in 1789. Land was granted to Col. Stone for use as a mill site.

During the War of 1812, American forces raided the government depot in the town to disrupt the flow of British supplies between Kingston and Montreal. The raiders seized the supplies they found and burned the depot. Within a month of the raid, construction of the Gananoque Blockhouse was started, with completion in 1813. It had an octagonal log parapet containing five guns. The blockhouse was abandoned after the War of 1812 and given to a private landowner.

The blockhouse was quickly repaired in the 1837–38 Patriot War when there were fears American militia forces were planning to attack. The Gananoque Blockhouse stood until 1852.

== Local attractions ==

Gananoque is referred to as the &quot;Gateway to the Thousand Islands,&quot; which lie next to it in the St. Lawrence River. Local attractions include boat cruises through the Thousand Islands and to Boldt Castle, New York, live theatre, the summer theatre festival of The Thousand Islands Playhouse, the Arthur Child Heritage Museum of the 1000 Islands, Thousand Islands Boat Museum, and the Shorelines Casino Thousand Islands. The theatre company in Gananoque is The Thousand Islands Playhouse which operates two theatre spaces: The Springer Theatre, and the Firehall Theatre, attracting international attention since 1982.

The Thousand Islands – Frontenac Arch Biosphere Reserve, designated in November 2002, is the third in Ontario, the twelfth in Canada, and one of over 400 around the world, and is part of UNESCO’s program on Man and the Biosphere.

== Transportation ==
Gananoque lies directly on three of Canada&#x27;s busiest transportation routes: the four-lane Highway 401, the double-track Canadian National Railway main line, and the St. Lawrence Seaway. It is also home to a rich provincial highway heritage, being home to the remaining stretch of Highway 2. It is the western terminus of the Thousand Islands Parkway, and a short drive from the Thousand Islands Bridge, which crosses into the United States as Interstate 81.

Via Rail inter-city passenger trains bound for Toronto and Ottawa stop at the unstaffed Gananoque station to the north of downtown. Gananoque is also served by the Gananoque Airport for general aviation.

Historically, the Gananoque River&#x27;s watershed had been an important water transportation corridor, extending north to the Rideau River watershed and playing a key role in the town&#x27;s early history and economic importance. In 1830, water was diverted near Newboro to the Cataraqui River as part of the Rideau Canal, sending this traffic instead to Kingston.

A four-mile short line railroad once linked the main CN Rail tracks to the heart of the village; the Thousand Islands Railway terminated near the town hall.

== Gananoque Police Service == 
Gananoque Police Service is a small law enforcement agency in the Eastern Ontario community of Gananoque.
The current Chief of Police is Scott Gee. Unlike other Towns and Villages of Ontario which have disbanded their municipal police forces in favour of contracting with the Ontario Provincial Police, the Gananoque Police Service continues to grow.

==Notable persons==
* Harry Brown—Gananoque-born recipient of the Victoria Cross for actions during the Battle of Hill 70 during the First World War
* Frank Belknap Long—Famed horror and science fiction writer. Long spent his summer family vacations in the vicinity with his parents, between the ages of six months and 17 years (1901–1918).
* Alyn McCauley—Gananoque-raised former NHL hockey player who currently serves as a pro scout for the Philadelphia Flyers.

<text>Giulio de&#x27; Medici ( 1533–1598) was the illegitimate son of Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, the Duke of Florence, and probably of Taddea Malaspina.

Aged about four at the time of his father&#x27;s assassination, he was passed over as a choice for the succession in favour of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, the first of the &quot;junior&quot; branch of the Medici to rule Florence. He was placed under the guardianship of Cosimo I and raised at his court. In 1562 he was appointed the first knight of the Order of Saint Stephen, an order founded to combat pirates and Turks in the Mediterranean Sea. As Admiral of the Order, from 1563 to 1566, he was sent to help the Knights Hospitallers during the Siege of Malta in 1565. He also acted as an ambassador, to Mantua in 1565; to Rome in 1571 and again in 1573.

Pompeo Litta mistakenly stated that Giulio was married to Lucrezia Gaetani, who was in fact married to his son Cosimo. Giulio had a daughter, Caterina, who became a Benedictine nun at the Monastero delle Murate in Florence and died in 1634. He also had two illegitimate sons, Cosimo (1550-1630), who followed him as a knight of the Order of Saint Stephen, and Giuliano (d.1598).

<text>Kingston Penitentiary (known locally as KP and Kingston Pen) is a former maximum security prison located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, between King Street West and Lake Ontario.

==History==


Constructed from 1833 to 1834 and opened on June 1, 1835, as the &quot;Provincial Penitentiary of the Province of Upper Canada&quot;, it was one of the oldest prisons in continuous use in the world at the time of its closure in 2013. Kingston Penitentiary was one of nine prisons in the Kingston area, prisons which had ranged from low-security facilities to the maximum-security facilities of Kingston Penitentiary and of Millhaven Institution, which was initially built to replace Kingston Pen.

The institution was built on land described as &quot;lot number twenty, in the first concession of the Township of Kingston&quot;. The cells originally measured wide by deep and high. The area had a 12-foot high wooden picket fence. In 1845, towers, stock walls, and the north gate house were completed. From 1859 through 1861 a dome was added connecting four cellblocks.

The site was chosen for &quot;combining the advantages of perfect salubrity, ready access to the water, and abundant quantities of fine limestone.&quot; Six inmates were accepted when the penitentiary was opened. English author Charles Dickens visited Kingston in 1842 and commented in his &quot;American Notes&quot;: &quot;There is an admirable jail here, well and wisely governed, and excellently regulated, in every respect. The men were employed as shoemakers, ropemakers, blacksmiths, tailors, carpenters, and stonecutters; and in building a new prison, which was pretty far advanced towards completion. The female prisoners were occupied in needlework.&quot;
The penitentiary&#x27;s western wall adjoins the Portsmouth Olympic Harbour, which hosted the sailing events for the 1976 Summer Olympics. Immediately across the road to the north is the now-closed Kingston Prison for Women, which functioned from January 24, 1934, to May 8, 2000, taking female prisoners who had been housed in segregated quarters in the main facility.

===Riots===
====1954====
On August 14, 1954, a two-hour riot broke out in the penitentiary—the worst in its history up to that point—involving 900 inmates. During the riot a breakout was attempted, but was foiled by the guards at the gate. The trouble apparently began during a morning baseball game in the exercise yard, when a guard was attacked, followed by several inmates setting fire to various buildings in the yard, including the shops and a warehouse, causing an estimated $2 million in damages. The disturbance was quelled by the guards aided by 160 Canadian Army troops and a squad of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers. The 50 ringleaders were placed in solitary confinement.

====1971====

On April 14, 1971, a riot led by the prison barber, Billy Knight, lasted four days and resulted in the death of two inmates and destruction of much of the prison. Security was substantially increased and prison reforms were instituted. Six correctional officers were held hostage, but all were eventually released unharmed. The prisoners issued formal grievances to the media including lack of recreational time, lack of work, and concerns about their future conditions in the newly built Millhaven Prison. During the riot, two prisoners, the child molester, Brian Ensor, and Bertrand Robert, a man who killed his five children, were murdered by the other prisoners. To put a stop to what was threatening to become a massacre, another inmate, Barrie MacKenzie, made a decision to release the hostages early on the morning of 18 April 1971. On 22 November 1971, the Crown made a plea bargain with the charges of two counts of first-degree murder against Brian Beaucage, who had organized the murders, were dropped in exchange for Beaucage making a guilty plea to one count of assault causing bodily harm with regard to the beating he had inflicted on Ensor. The plea bargain was and still is very controversial.

A 1971 inquiry into the riot, chaired by Justice J.W. Swackhamer, reported that they had &quot;already noted a number of causes for Kingston&#x27;s failure: the aged physical facilities, overcrowding, the shortage of professional staff, a program that had been substantially curtailed, the confinement in the institution of a number of people who did not require maximum security confinement, too much time spent in cells, a lack of adequate channels to deal with complaints and the lack of an adequate staff which resulted in the breakdowns of established procedures to deal with inmate requests. The polarization between inmates and custodial staff, between custodial staff and professional staff, led inevitably to the destruction of the program and deterioration in the life of the institution.&quot; This riot, together with successors in 1975, led to an official Sub-Committee on the Penitentiary System in Canada, chaired by Justice Mark MacGuigan. The 1977 MacGuigan Report recommended the creation of an Independent Chairperson (ICP) to investigate prisoner complaints.

===1971–1981===
From 1971 to 1981, the penitentiary served as Corrections Canada&#x27;s Ontario Region Reception Centre. Before it closed, the facility housed between 350 and 500 inmates plus another 120 at the Regional Treatment Centre contained within the prison. Every inmate was given an individual cell.

In its later years, Kingston Penitentiary became known as a &quot;dumping ground for bad guards&quot;, and after an investigation by the RCMP, eight guards were terminated.

In 1990, Kingston Penitentiary was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

On April 19, 2012, the Government of Canada announced plans to close the Kingston Penitentiary, along with the Leclerc Institution in Laval, Quebec and the Regional Treatment Centre in Kingston, Ontario. Kingston Penitentiary officially closed on September 30, 2013. The penitentiary was opened during October/November 2013 for public tours hosted by the United Way of KFL&amp;A and Habitat for Humanity Canada.

== Escapes ==
On September 10, 1923, inmate Norman &quot;Red&quot; Ryan planned and carried out an escape with several other inmates. After setting fire to a shed as a distraction, the gang used a ladder and went over the wall. They stole a car from a nearby property and fled the city.

On August 17, 1947, inmates Nicholas Minelli, Ulysses Lauzon, and Donald &quot;Mickey&quot; Macdonald climbed over the wall behind the east cell block, after cutting through the bars on their cell. Both Minelli and Lauzon were recaptured, but Macdonald was never found.
In 1999, inmate Ty Conn escaped from the facility. Although there had been at least 26 escape attempts since 1836, Conn was the first to evade capture for weeks since 1958. Two weeks later, surrounded by police in Toronto, Conn suffered a fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound while speaking on the telephone to CBC producer Theresa Burke.

==Notable inmates==

Kingston Penitentiary had been home to many of Canada&#x27;s most dangerous and notorious criminals. James Donnelly, patriarch of the Black Donnellys, was sentenced to be hanged on September 17, 1859, for the murder of Patrick Farrell. A petition for clemency started by his wife Johannah saw his sentence reduced to seven years in Kingston Penitentiary.

Other notable inmates include Lizzie Lessard, Wayne Ford, Russell Williams, Paul Bernardo, Clifford Olson, Roger Caron and Grace Marks. Wayne Boden, the Canadian &quot;Vampire Rapist&quot; died there in March 2006. Tim Buck, leader of the Communist Party, was a prisoner at Kingston Penitentiary convicted under Section 98 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; during the early 1930s. Bernie Guindon, the president of the Satan&#x27;s Choice Motorcycle Club who served part of his rape sentence at Kingston penitentiary in 1969-1970 described Kingston penitentiary as a very harsh prison where the other prisoners were not permitted to speak to one another outside of their cells unless a guard was present. Guindon&#x27;s son, Harley Davidson Guindon, was held at Kingston in 2011. Several of the Port Hope 8 such as Gary Comeau, Merv Blaker, Jeff McLeod, and Richard Sauvé were held at Kingston Penitentiary in 1979–1980. The gangster Gregory Woolley served his sentence at Kingston Penitentiary between 2005 and 2007. Howard Chard, the chief enforcer of the Papalia family, was the boxing champion of Kingston Penitentiary in the 1940s. Gregory Woolley, the boss of the Hells Angels puppet gang, the Rockers, served his prison sentence at Kingston Penitentiary between 2005 and 2011.

Marie-Anne Houde, formerly convicted for the murder of her stepdaughter Aurore Gagnon, was sentenced to life in Kingston Penitentiary, following the appeal to commute her sentence to death citing health reasons. She was released on June 29, 1935.

Robert Gentles was killed by six guards in 1993. Gentles&#x27;s mother Carmeta believed that the guards were motivated by racism in their attack on her son but was unsuccessful in bringing charges against the guards independent of the Crown. Two men, Ravin Gill and Bradley Waugh, placed wanted posters for the six guards around Kingston which led to their being charged with criminal libel. The ensuing criminal case resulted in the law being struck down in Ontario. A coroner&#x27;s inquest concluded Gentles&#x27;s death was accidental.

Mohammad and Hamed Shafia were imprisoned in the penitentiary after being convicted of killing Mohammad&#x27;s three daughters and first wife. Michael Rafferty was serving a life sentence for his role in the kidnapping, rape and murder of eight-year-old Victoria Stafford of Woodstock, but has since been relocated.

== In popular media ==

Much of &quot;Alias Grace&quot; is set in Kingston Penitentiary where the real life Grace Marks was imprisoned.

In &quot;Cataract City&quot; one of the main characters is imprisoned at Kingston Penitentiary for 20 years following a murder.

In the Canadian novel &quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot;, the Carravagio chapter begins at Kingston Penitentiary.

The Lawrence Gowan song &quot;A Criminal Mind&quot; was inspired by a cell block at Kingston Penitentiary.

Television series &quot;Mayor of Kingstown&quot; was filmed at the penitentiary.

== Correctional Service of Canada Museum ==

Located directly across from Kingston Penitentiary, the Correctional Service of Canada Museum (also known as &quot;Canada&#x27;s Penitentiary Museum&quot;) explains the history of Kingston Penitentiary and other correctional centres using displays that incorporate artifacts, photographs, equipment, and replicas. The museum also houses most of the institution&#x27;s historical records as well as those of other Canadian penitentiaries, and provides the only penitentiary research service in Canada. The museum is located in &quot;Cedarhedge&quot;, the former Warden&#x27;s residence of Kingston Penitentiary that was constructed between 1870 and 1873.

<text>Marcel Aymé (; 29 March 1902 – 14 October 1967) was a French novelist and playwright, who also wrote screenplays and works for children.

== Biography == 
Marcel André Aymé was born in Joigny, in the Burgundy region of France, the youngest of six children. His father, Joseph, was a blacksmith, and his mother, Emma Monamy, died when he was two years old, after the family had moved to Tours. Marcel was sent to live with his maternal grandparents in the village of Villers-Robert, a place where he would spend the next eight years, and which would serve as the model for the fictitious village of Claquebue in what is perhaps the most well-known of his novels, &quot;La Jument verte&quot;. In 1906 Marcel entered the local primary school. Because his grandfather was a staunch anti-clerical republican, he was looked down upon by his classmates, many of whose parents held more traditional views. Accordingly, Marcel was not baptized before reaching the age of eight, nearly two years after the death of his grandfather in 1908. Orphaned once more when his grandmother died two years later, he briefly lived with other family members before moving to Dole, a small town of the Franche-Comte region, to stay with an aunt and attend the Collège de l&#x27;Arc, where he demonstrated more ability in mathematics than in literature. His years at school there were an unpleasant experience he would never look back on fondly.

Despite ongoing issues with his health that had begun when he was a child, Aymé was able to perform his military service, which began in 1919, as part of an artillery unit in the occupied Rhineland. In 1923 he moved to Paris where he worked unsuccessfully at a bank, an insurance company, and as a journalist. Though he failed in his career as a reporter, his stint at the newspaper allowed him to discover his love of writing.

His first published novel was &quot;Brûlebois&quot; (1926), and in 1929 his &quot;La Table aux crevés&quot; won the Prix Renaudot. After the great success of his novel &quot;La Jument verte&quot; (1933), translated into English as &quot;The Green Mare&quot;, he concentrated mostly on writing and publishing children&#x27;s stories, novels, and collections of stories. In 1935 he also started writing movie scripts. In theatre, Marcel Aymé found success with his plays &quot;Lucienne et le boucher, Clérambard&quot; (1949), a farce, and &quot;Tête des autres&quot; (1952), which criticized the death penalty.

He died in 1967 and was buried in the Cimetière Saint-Vincent in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris.

== Work ==
One of Aymé&#x27;s most famous short stories is &quot;Le passe-muraille&quot; or &quot;The Walker-Through-Walls&quot;. At the age of 42, Dutilleul suddenly discovers that he has &quot;the remarkable gift of being able to pass through walls with perfect ease&quot;. What begins as a novelty that gives him pleasure ends up pushing Dutilleul toward ever more sinister pursuits.

== Legacy ==
Visitors to Paris can see a monument in his honour at Place Marcel-Aymé, in the Montmartre Quarter. The statue is based on his short story &quot;Le passe-muraille&quot; (&quot;The Walker through Walls&quot;).

<text>A streambed or stream bed is the bottom of a stream or river (bathymetry) and is confined within a channel, or the banks of the waterway. Usually, the bed does not contain terrestrial (land) vegetation and instead supports different types of aquatic vegetation (aquatic plant), depending on the type of streambed material and water velocity. Streambeds are what would be left once a stream is no longer in existence. The beds are usually well preserved even if they get buried because the banks and canyons made by the stream are typically hard, although soft sand and debris often fill the bed. Dry, buried streambeds can actually be underground water pockets. During times of rain, sandy streambeds can soak up and retain water, even during dry seasons, keeping the water table close enough to the surface to be obtainable by local people.

The nature of any streambed is always a function of the flow dynamics and the local geologic materials. The climate of an area will determine the amount of precipitation a stream receives and therefore the amount of water flowing over the streambed. A streambed is usually a mix of particle sizes which depends on the water velocity and the materials introduced from upstream and from the watershed. Particle sizes can range from very fine silts and clays to large cobbles and boulders (grain size). In general, sands move most easily, and particles become more difficult to move as they increase in size. Silts and clays, although smaller than sands, can sometimes stick together, making them harder to move along the streambed. In streams with a gravel bed, the larger grain sizes are usually on the bed surface with finer grain sizes below. This is called armoring of the streambed.The streambed is very complex in terms of erosion and deposition. As the water flows downstream, different sized particles get sorted to different parts of a streambed as water velocity changes and sediment is transported, eroded and deposited on the streambed. Deposition usually occurs on the inside of curves, where water velocity slows, and erosion occurs on the outside of stream curves, where velocity is higher. This continued erosion and deposition of sediment tends to create meanders of the stream. In streams with a low to moderate grade, deeper, slower water pools (stream pools) and faster shallow water riffles often form as the stream meanders downhill. Pools can also form as water rushes over or around obstructions in the waterway.

Under certain conditions a river can branch from one streambed to multiple streambeds. For example, an anabranch may form when a section of stream or river goes around a small island and then rejoins the main channel. The buildup of sediment on a streambed may cause a channel to be abandoned in favor of a new one (avulsion (river)). A braided river may form as small threads come and go within a main channel.

== Climate change ==
The intensity and frequency of both drought and rain events are expected to increase with climate change. Floods, or flood stage, occur when a stream overflows its banks. In undisturbed natural areas, flood water would be able to spread out within a floodplain and vegetation of either grassland or forest, would slow and absorb peak flows. In such areas, streambeds should remain more stable and exhibit minimal scour. They should retain rich organic matter and, therefore continue to support a rich biota (river ecosystem). The majority of sediment washed out in higher flows is &quot;near-threshold&quot; sediment that has been deposited during normal flow and only needs a slightly higher flow to become mobile again. This shows that the streambed is left mostly unchanged in size and shape over time.
In urban and suburban areas with little natural vegetation, high levels of impervious surface, and no floodplain, unnaturally high levels of surface runoff can occur. This causes an increase in flooding and watershed erosion which can lead to thinner soils upslope. Streambeds can exhibit a greater amount of scour, often down to bedrock, and banks may be undercut causing bank erosion. This increased bank erosion widens the stream and can lead to an increased sediment load downstream.

<doc id="300028" wikidata="Q468324" url="?curid=300028" title="L. K. Advani">
<text>Lal Krishna Advani (born 8 November 1927 ) is an Indian politician and statesman who served as the 7th Deputy Prime Minister of India from 2002 to 2004. He is one of the co-founders of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist volunteer organization. He is the longest serving Minister of Home Affairs serving from 1998 to 2004. He is also the longest serving Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha as well as the longest serving President of the BJP, the current ruling party of India. He was the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP during the 2009 general election.

Advani was born in Karachi and migrated to India during the Partition of India and settled down in Bombay where he completed his college education. Advani joined the RSS in 1941 at the age of fourteen and worked as a pracharak in Rajasthan. In 1951, Advani became a member of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh founded by Syama Prasad Mookerjee and performed various roles including in charge of parliamentary affairs, general secretary, and president of the Delhi unit. In 1967, he was elected as the chairman of the First Delhi metropolitan council and served till 1970 while becoming a member of the RSS national executive. In 1970, Advani became a member of the Rajya Sabha for the first time and would go on to serve four terms till 1989. He became the president of Jana Sangh in 1973 and Jana Sangh merged into the Janata Party before the 1977 general election. Following the Janata party&#x27;s victory in the elections, Advani became the union minister for Information and Broadcasting and leader of the house in Rajya Sabha.

In 1980, he was one of the founding members of the BJP along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and served as the president of the party three times. He was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 1989 where he served seven terms. In 1992, he was alleged to have been part of the Demolition of the Babri Masjid, but was acquitted by the courts due to lack of evidence. Following the same, he was one of the chief proponents of the movement to build a temple over the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi site in Ayodhya and the subsequent rise of Hindutva politics in the late 1990s. He has served as leader of opposition in both the houses. He was the minister of home affairs from 1998 to 2004 and deputy prime minister from 2002 to 2004. He served in the Indian parliament until 2019 and is credited for rise of BJP as a major political party. In 2015, he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian honour and in 2024, he was conferred with Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian honour.

==Early and personal life==
Advani was born on 8 November 1927 in Karachi, British India, in a Sindhi Hindu Lohana family to Kishanchand D. Advani and Gyani Devi.

Advani was educated at St. Patrick&#x27;s High School, Karachi, and at D.G. National College, Hyderabad, Sindh. His family was forced to flee Sindh and came to India during the partition of India and settled in Bombay, where he graduated in law from the Government Law College, Mumbai.

Advani married Kamla Advani in February 1965, and they have a son, Jayant, and a daughter, Pratibha. Pratibha is a television producer and also supports her father in his political activities. His wife died on 6 April 2016 due to old age. Advani resides in Delhi.

==Career==
===1941-51: Early years===
Advani joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1941 at the age of fourteen. He became a pracharak (full-time worker) conducting shakhas and became the secretary of the Karachi unit in 1947. After the partition of India, Advani was a pracharak in Rajasthan working across Alwar, Bharatpur, Kota, Bundi and Jhalawar districts until 1952.

===1951-70: Jana Sangh and DMC chairman===
Advani became a member of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), a political party founded in 1951 by Syama Prasad Mookerjee in collaboration with the RSS. He was appointed as the secretary to S. S. Bhandari, then general secretary of the Jana Sangh in Rajasthan. In 1957, he moved to Delhi and became the general secretary and later, president of the Delhi unit of the Jana Sangh. From 1966 to 1967 he served as the leader of BJS in the Delhi Metropolitan Council (DMC). After the 1967 Delhi Metropolitan Council election, he was elected as the chairman of the council and served till 1970. He also assisted K. R. Malkani with the publication of &quot;Organiser&quot;, the weekly newsletter of the RSS and became a member of its national executive in 1966.

===1971-75: Parliament entry and Jan Sangh leader===
In 1970, Advani became a member of the Rajya Sabha from Delhi for the six-year tenure. In 1973, he was elected as the president of BJS at the Kanpur session of the party working committee meeting.

===1976-80: Janata party and cabinet minister===
Advani was reelected to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat in 1976 for the second time. After the imposition of Emergency and crack down on opposition parties by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, BJS and other opposition parties merged to form the Janata Party. In the 1977 election, Janata Party won a landslide victory due to the widespread unpopularity of emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi. Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister with Advani becoming the Minister of Information and Broadcasting. The government did not complete its five year term and was dissolved to call fresh elections in 1980 where Janata party lost to the Indian National Congress. Subsequently, Advani became the leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha.

===1981-89: Formation of BJP and early years===
On 6 April 1980, Advani along with few of the erstwhile members of the Jana Sangh quit the Janata Party and formed the Bharatiya Janata Party with Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the first president. Though the previous government lasted briefly from 1977 till 1980 and was marred with factional wars, the period saw a rise in support for the RSS which culminated into the formation of the BJP. In 1982, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha for the third time from Madhya Pradesh representing the BJP. BJP won only two seats in the 1984 election with the Congress winning a landslide on the back of a sympathy wave due to the assassination of Indira Gandhi. This failure led to a shift in the party&#x27;s stance with Advani being appointed party president and the BJP turning to Hindutva ideology of Jana Sangh.

Under Advani, BJP became the political face of the Ayodhya dispute over the Ram Janmabhoomi site when the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) begun a movement for the construction of a temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the site of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. The dispute centered on the basis of the belief that the site was the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple once stood there that had been demolished by the Mughal emperor Babur with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) supporting the claim. BJP supported the campaign and made it a part of their election manifesto for the 1989 elections helping it win 86 seats with Advani getting elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time. Advani became the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha when VP Singh formed the National Front government.

===1990-97: Rath yatra and rise of BJP===
In 1990, Advani embarked on Ram Rath Yatra, a procession with a chariot to mobilise volunteers for Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The procession began from Somnath in Gujarat and headed to converge at Ayodhya. In the 1991 general election, the BJP became the second largest party after the Congress with Advani winning for the second time from Gandhinagar and becoming the leader of opposition again. In 1992, Babri Masjid was demolished with Advani alleged to have delivered a provocative speech prior to the demolition. Advani was among the accused in the demolition case but was acquitted on 30 September 2020 by a CBI&#x27;s special court. In the judgement, it was mentioned that the demolition was not pre-planned and that Advani was trying to stop the mob and not incite them.

In the 1996 general election, the BJP became the single largest party and was consequently invited by the President to form the government. Advani did not contest the elections over allegations of involvement in the Hawala scandal from which he was acquitted later by Supreme Court. While Vajpayee was sworn in as Prime Minister in May 1996, the government collapsed after just thirteen days.

===1998-2004: Home minister and deputy prime minister===
In the 1998 general election, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), came to power with Vajpayee returning as Prime Minister in March 1998. Advani was elected to the Lok Sabha for the third term and became the Home Minister. However, the government again collapsed after only thirteen months when All Indian Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) under J. Jayalalitha withdrew its support to the government. With fresh elections being called, the BJP led NDA again won a majority in the 1999 general election and Advani won from Gandhinagar for the fourth term. He assumed the office of Home Minister and was later elevated to the position of Deputy Prime Minister in 2002.

===2004-09: Leader of opposition===

In the 2004 general election, the BJP suffered a defeat with United Progressive Alliance led by the Congress coming to power, with Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister. Advani won his fifth term to the Lok Sabha and became the leader of opposition. Vajpayee retired from active politics after the 2004 defeat, promoting Advani to lead the BJP. In June 2005, while on a visit to Karachi, Advani described Mohammad Ali Jinnah as a &quot;secular&quot; leader which led to criticism from the RSS. Advani was forced to resign as BJP president but withdrew the resignation a few days later. In April 2005, RSS chief K. S. Sudarshan opined that Advani should step aside. At the silver jubilee celebrations of the BJP in Mumbai in December 2005, Advani stepped down as party president and Rajnath Singh, from Uttar Pradesh was elected in his place. In March 2006, following a bomb blast at a Hindu shrine at Varanasi, Advani undertook a &quot;Bharat Suraksha Yatra&quot; (Sojourn for National Security), to highlight the alleged failure of the ruling United Progressive Alliance in combating terrorism.

===2009-15: Prime Minister candidacy and later years===

In December 2006, Advani stated that as the leader of the opposition in a parliamentary democracy, he considered himself the Prime Ministerial candidate for the next general elections in May 2009. While not everyone was supportive of his candidacy, Vajpayee endorsed Advani&#x27;s candidacy. On 2 May 2007, BJP President Rajnath Singh stated that Advani is the natural choice for the next prime minister if BJP won the next elections. On 10 December 2007, the Parliamentary Board of BJP formally announced that L. K. Advani would be its prime ministerial candidate for the general elections due in 2009.

Though Advani won his sixth term in Lok Sabha, the BJP lost to Congress and its allies in the 2009 general elections, allowing then incumbent Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to continue in office. Following the defeat in the elections, L. K. Advani handed over the position of leader of opposition to Sushma Swaraj. He was elected working chairman of the National Democratic Alliance in 2010. Advani contested the 2014 general election from Gandhinagar, winning for the fifth consecutive time. Later he was part of the &quot;Marg Darshak Mandal&quot; (vision committee) of the BJP along with Murli Manohar Joshi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

===Rath Yatras===

Advani often organised &quot;Rath yatras&quot; or processions to boost the popularity of the BJP and unify the Hindutva ideology. He organized six rath yatras or processions across the country with the first one in 1990.

#&quot;Ram Rath Yatra&quot;: Advani started his first yatra from Somnath in Gujarat on 25 September 1990 which concluded at Ayodhya on 30 October 1990. The procession was linked to the dispute at Ram Janmabhoomi site at Ayodhya and was stopped in Bihar by then Chief Minister Lalu Yadav with Advani himself being arrested on the orders of V. P. Singh, then Prime Minister of India.
#&quot;Janadesh Yatra&quot;: Four processions starting on 11 September 1993 from four corners of country were organized and Advani led the yatra from Mysore in South India. Traversing through 14 states and two Union Territories, the processions were organized with the purpose to seek the people&#x27;s mandate against the two bills, the Constitution 80th Amendment Bill and the Representation of People (Amendment) Bill and congregated at Bhopal on 25 September.
#&quot;Swarna Jayanti Rath Yatra&quot;: The procession was organized between May and July 1997 and was conducted in celebration of 50 years of Indian Independence and to project the BJP as a party committed to good governance.
#&quot;Bharat Uday Yatra&quot;: The yatra took place in the run-up to the 2004 election.
#&quot;Bharat Suraksha Yatra&quot;: The BJP launched a nationwide mass political campaign from 6 April to 10 May 2006 consisting of two yatras – one led by Advani from Dwaraka in Gujarat to Delhi and the other led by Rajnath Singh from Puri to Delhi. The yatra was focused on fighting left wing terrorism, minority politics, price rise and corruption, protection of democracy.
#&quot;Jan Chetna Yatra&quot;: The last of the yatras was launched on 11 October 2011 from Sitab Diara in Bihar with the purpose of mobilising public opinion against corruption of then ruling UPA government and promote the BJP agenda of good governance and clean politics.

<text>Charles Pierre Péguy (; 7 January 1873 – 5 September 1914) was a French poet, essayist, and editor. His two main philosophies were socialism and nationalism; by 1908 at the latest, after years of uneasy agnosticism, he had become a believing (but generally non-practicing) Roman Catholic.
From that time, Catholicism strongly influenced his works.

==Biography==
Péguy was born into poverty in Orléans. His mother Cécile, widowed when he was an infant, mended chairs for a living. His father Désiré Péguy was a cabinet maker, who died in 1874 as a result of combat wounds. Péguy studied at the Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux, winning a scholarship at the École normale supérieure (Paris), where he attended notably the lectures of Henri Bergson and Romain Rolland, whom he befriended. He formally left without graduating, in 1897, though he continued attending some lectures in 1898. Influenced by Lucien Herr, librarian of the &quot;École Normale Supérieure&quot;, he became an ardent Dreyfusard.

In 1897, Péguy married Charlotte-Françoise Baudoin; they had one daughter and three sons, one of whom was born after Péguy&#x27;s death. Around 1910 he fell deeply in love with Blanche Raphael, a young Jewish friend; however, he was faithful to his wife.

From his earliest years, he was influenced by socialism. He joined the Socialist Party in 1895. From 1900 until his death in 1914, he was the main contributor to and the editor of the literary magazine &quot;Les Cahiers de la Quinzaine&quot;, which at first supported the Socialist Party director Jean Jaurès. However, Péguy ultimately ended this support after he began viewing Jaurès as a traitor to the nation and to socialism. In the &quot;Cahiers&quot;, Péguy published not only his own essays and poetry, but also works by important contemporary authors such as Romain Rolland.

His free-verse poem, &quot;Portico of the Mystery of the Second Virtue&quot;, has gone through more than 60 editions in France. It was a favourite book of Charles de Gaulle.

When the First World War broke out, Péguy became a lieutenant in the 19th company of the French 276th Infantry Regiment. He died in battle, shot in the forehead, near Villeroy, Seine-et-Marne on the day before the beginning of the Battle of the Marne. There is a memorial to Péguy near the field where he was killed.

==Influence==

During the Second World War both supporters and opponents of Vichy France cited Péguy. Edmond Michelet was the first of many members of the French Resistance to quote Péguy; de Gaulle, familiar with Péguy&#x27;s writing, quoted him in a 1942 speech. Those who opposed Vichy&#x27;s anti-Semitism laws often cited him. By contrast, Robert Brasillach praised Péguy as a &quot;French National Socialist&quot;, and Péguy&#x27;s sons Pierre and Marcel wrote that their father was an inspiration for Vichy&#x27;s National Revolution ideology and &quot;above all, a racist&quot;. It has been written that Péguy would likely have been horrified by his future influence on fascism.

The English novelist Graham Greene alluded to Péguy in &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;, while &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; has as its epigraph a quotation from Péguy. In &quot;The Lawless Roads&quot; Greene refers to Péguy &quot;challenging God in the cause of the damned&quot;.

The Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, in the course of describing the history of art as a sometimes more and sometimes less successful approximation of God&#x27;s creativeness, noted that Péguy&#x27;s Eve was a &quot;theological redemption of the project of Proust&quot;, meaning that where Proust had memory and charity, the Eve of Péguy – not necessarily Péguy – had memory, charity and knowledge of the redemption of God.

English poet Geoffrey Hill published a book-length poem in 1983 in homage to Péguy, entitled &quot;The Mystery of the Charity of Charles Péguy&quot;.

==Famous quotations==

&quot;The world has changed more in the last 30 years than in all the time since Jesus Christ.&quot; (said in 1913) 

&quot;The sinner is at the very heart of Christianity. Nobody is so competent as the sinner in matters of Christianity. Nobody, except the saint.&quot; This is the epigraph to Graham Greene&#x27;s novel &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (1948).

&quot;It will never be known what acts of cowardice have been committed for fear of not looking sufficiently progressive.&quot; (&quot;Notre Patrie&quot;, 1905)

&quot;Tyranny is always better organised than freedom&quot;.

&quot;Kantian ethics has clean hands but, in a manner of speaking, actually no hands.&quot;

&quot;How maddening, says God, it will be when there are no longer any Frenchmen.&quot;

&quot;There will be things that I do that no one will be left to understand.&quot; (&quot;Le Mystère des saints Innocents&quot;)

&quot;It is impossible to write ancient history because we do not have enough sources, and impossible to write modern history because we have too many&quot;. (&quot;Clio&quot;, 1909)

&quot;Everything begins in mysticism and ends in politics.&quot; (&quot;Notre Jeunesse&quot;, 1909)

&quot;Homer is original this morning, and nothing is perhaps so old as today&#x27;s newspaper.&quot;

<doc id="300030" wikidata="Q7859580" url="?curid=300030" title="Ty Conn">
<text>Tyrone Williams &quot;Ty&quot; Conn (January 18, 1967 – May 20, 1999), born Ernest Bruce Hayes, was a Canadian bank robber. He was the only person in the last half-century to escape over the wall from the Kingston Penitentiary, one of Canada&#x27;s most secure prisons.

==History==
Tyrone Conn was born in 1967, as Ernest Bruce Hayes, to an Ontario 15-year-old mother and a father from Newfoundland and Labrador. Soon after his birth, his mother abandoned him to the care of his father, who in turn abandoned him to the care of his maternal grandparents. They placed him for adoption at the age of three. He was adopted by a Belleville, Ontario psychiatrist, Dr. E. Bert Conn, and his wife. Dr. Conn&#x27;s wife was described as mentally unstable. Tyrone Conn remained with Dr. Conn and his wife for eight years before being returned to the care of the local Children&#x27;s Aid Society. He then spent the balance of his adolescent and teenage years in foster homes, group homes, and youth detention facilities, starting at the Brookside Training School, at the age of fourteen. During his time with his adoptive parents, Conn had developed a habit of compulsive stealing, starting with food and escalating, by his teens, to cars. From the age of thirteen to his death, nineteen years later, Conn was only &quot;legally at large&quot; for a total of sixty-nine days. Conn had also been &quot;illegally at large&quot; by escaping from a number of lower-security institutions.

In 1998, Conn was transferred to Kingston Penitentiary for acting as an informant at the Millhaven Institution. He advised security staff at Millhaven that fellow inmates were planning an escape and was therefore placed in protective custody.

Conn&#x27;s escape on May 6, 1999, from inside the compound was the 26th in the history of facility. More than 50 escapees were involved in those 26 incidents. Conn employed a ladder and homemade grappling hook to scale the wall and used cayenne pepper to prevent dogs from following his scent.

==Death and aftermath==
Conn was found in a Toronto apartment building two weeks after his escape. Surrounded by police, he committed suicide, rather than be captured. Other theories assert that Conn accidentally discharged the stolen shotgun in his possession during the standoff, while he was speaking on the telephone to Theresa Burke, a CBC producer. Burke and journalist Linden MacIntyre, both associated with the television program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;, later published &quot;Who Killed Ty Conn&quot; (Viking Press Canada, 2000; reissued 2011, Creative Book Publishing, St. John&#x27;s). MacIntyre had met and befriended Conn in 1994, during the course of researching an investigative story on the effects of child abuse. At the time, Conn was serving a 47-year sentence, principally for bank robbery. The length of the compound sentence was despite the lack of violence in his criminal record. MacIntyre arranged for Conn&#x27;s funeral and also gave a eulogy at the service.

::He often told me how badly he felt about the people he frightened.
:::Journalist Linden MacIntyre at Ty Conn&#x27;s funeral, 1999.

<doc id="300040" wikidata="Q11286214" url="?curid=300040" title="Puyo Puyo (video game)">
<text>is a puzzle video game released in 1991 by Compile for the MSX2. Since its creation, it uses characters from &quot;Madō Monogatari&quot;. It was created by Masamitsu &quot;Moo&quot; Niitani, the founder of Compile, who was inspired by certain elements from the &quot;Tetris&quot; and &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; series of games.

The game was released by Tokuma Shoten on the same day of the MSX2 release under the name and as part of the Famimaga Disk series for the Family Computer Disk System. A year after the MSX2 and FDS versions, Sega released an arcade version, which heavily expanded the previous versions by including a one-player story mode and a two-player competitive mode.

==Gameplay==

The main game of &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; is played against at least one opponent, computer or human. The game itself has three modes, Single Puyo Puyo, Double Puyo Puyo, and Endless Puyo Puyo. In Single mode, the player takes on the role of Arle Nadja, a 16-year-old female spellcaster that has the pleasure of foiling the Dark Prince&#x27;s plans. The Dark Prince wishes to take over the world, and Arle stands in his way. As such, Arle must first however battle her way through 12 opponents before facing the Dark Prince. With the exception of Rulue, they are not sent by the Dark Prince, and mostly they just want to pull shenanigans with her (for Rulue, she fell in love with the Dark Prince). Once Arle has beaten the Dark Prince, the world is saved, so she can return home. As in all main Puyo games, the story mode consists of playing Puyo matches against a fixed sequence of characters in one of three courses. In Double mode, two players play against each other. In exactly the same fashion as before, by out-chaining one another, the player tries to fill up their opponent&#x27;s grid. Since the rules of sending so many garbage blocks made games short-lived, no matter how many chains are sent, Compile added the rule of Offsetting in &quot;Puyo Puyo 2&quot; and onwards. This lets players counter opponents&#x27; attacks with chains of their own, sending any garbage blocks back to them as a result of overflow. In endless mode, the player must continually match puyos to get the highest score they can. In Mission mode, the player must complete 52 missions requiring the Puyos on the field to be eliminated by using limited pieces.

==Development==
An English-translated version of the arcade original was created and released internationally which replaces the original voice work, changes many of the characters&#x27; names, and removes the wings of the Harpies (which are called Dark Elves in the English version). Sega had re-released &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; for the Mega Drive on December 18, 1992 and the Game Gear on March 19, 1993 in Japan. The Game Gear port of &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; contains an English version named &quot;Puzlow Kids&quot;; this version appears whenever the game cartridge is used in a North American or European system. A PC-9801 port was released by Compile on the same day the Game Gear port was released. Tokuma Shoten had re-released their version &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; for the Family Computer itself on July 23 the same year, which added a 2-player competitive mode. Banpresto released a version for the Super Famicom under the title on December 10, 1993. In 1994, a port to the Game Boy was developed by Winkysoft, published by Banpresto and released on July 31 under the original name. NEC Avenue released their version of &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; for the PC Engine&#x27;s CD-ROM² on April 22, titled . CRI Middleware released their version of &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; for the FM Towns in December.

Before the series was branded as &quot;Puyo Pop&quot; internationally, the Genesis version of the first game saw release outside Japan in 1993 as &quot;Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine&quot; in North America and Europe; this version omitted the characters and setting of the original release, replacing them with characters from the &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; animated series. The Game Gear version was likewise altered for North America and Europe, and also ported to the Master System in Europe. Two years later, the game was released for the Super NES as &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Avalanche&quot; in North America and as &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Ghost Trap&quot; in Europe, utilizing characters from Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Kirby&quot; series.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade version of &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; on their December 15, 1992 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

The Mega Drive version was a bestseller in Japan for four months.

== Legacy ==
The Mega Drive version was re-released for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in Japan on December 2, 2006, while the arcade version was released on April 12, 2011. The arcade VC release features online play.

An arcade version was re-released for the Nintendo Switch under the brand in August 2019, with online-playing features.

Several clones of the game were created in the years following the game&#x27;s release. &quot;Super Foul Egg&quot; was one such clone created for the Amiga by request of &quot;Amiga Power&quot; magazine and was featured on a cover disk. It was then ported to RISC OS on Acorn by Owain Cole (and featured on an Acorn User cover disk), and finally ported to Java.

In late 1995 it was ported to the Apple IIGS by Bret Victor.

<doc id="300044" wikidata="Q419250" url="?curid=300044" title="Brucite">
<text>Brucite is the mineral form of magnesium hydroxide, with the chemical formula Mg(OH)2. It is a common alteration product of periclase in marble; a low-temperature hydrothermal vein mineral in metamorphosed limestones and chlorite schists; and formed during serpentinization of dunites. Brucite is often found in association with serpentine, calcite, aragonite, dolomite, magnesite, hydromagnesite, artinite, talc and chrysotile.

It adopts a layered CdI2-like structure with hydrogen-bonds between the layers.

==Discovery==
Brucite was first described in 1824 by François Sulpice Beudant and named for the discoverer, American mineralogist, Archibald Bruce (1777–1818). A fibrous variety of brucite is called nemalite. It occurs in fibers or laths, usually elongated along [1010], but sometimes [1120] crystalline directions.

==Occurrence==
A notable location in the US is Wood&#x27;s Chrome Mine, Cedar Hill Quarry, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Yellow, white and blue brucite with a botryoidal habit was discovered in Qila Saifullah District of Province Baluchistan, Pakistan. In a later discovery, brucite also occurred in the Bela Ophiolite of Wadh, Khuzdar District, Province Baluchistan, Pakistan. Brucite has also occurred from South Africa, Italy, Russia, Canada, and other localities as well, but the most notable discoveries are the US, Russian and Pakistani examples.

==Industrial applications==
Synthetic brucite is mainly consumed as a precursor to magnesia (MgO), a useful refractory and thermal insulator. It finds some use as a flame retardant because it thermally decomposes to release water in a similar way to aluminium hydroxide () and mixtures of huntite () and hydromagnesite (). It also constitutes a significant source of magnesium for industry. Although generally deemed safe, brucite can be contaminated with naturally occurring asbestos fibers.

==Magnesium attack of cement and concrete ==
When cement or concrete are exposed to Mg2+, the neoformation of brucite, an expansive material, may induce mechanical stress in the hardened cement paste or may clog the porous network creating a and delaying the alteration/transformation of the C-S-H phase (the &quot;glue&quot; phase in the hardened cement paste) into M-S-H phase (a non-cohesive mineral phase). The exact magnitude of impact that brucite has on cement paste is still debatable. Prolonged contact between sea water or brines and concrete may induce durability issues for regularly immersed concrete components or structures.

The use of dolomite as aggregate in concrete can also cause magnesium attack and should be avoided.

<doc id="300045" wikidata="Q2746540" url="?curid=300045" title="Paul Leduc (film director)">
<text>Paul Leduc Rosenzweig (11 March 1942 – 21 October 2020) was a Mexican film director.

One of Leduc&#x27;s most acclaimed works is &quot;Frida, naturaleza viva&quot; (1983 – marketed as &quot;Frida&quot; in the U.S.), a tribute to the indomitable spirit and determination of the painter Frida Kahlo.

== Overview ==
Paul Leduc Rosenzweig studied architecture and theatre, at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México; attended a French film school, Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEHC). His film career began in a university department of film studies. His first films were documentaries. Leduc like other filmmakers of his time was seeking answers to create a form of cinema capable of “affirming our culture and our language. Daring the encounter with our originality-and with reality, the profound relationship with what happens to us and what entertains, afflicts or liberates us.”

Leduc was able to launch his career due to a unique situation. During the reign of President Luis Echeverría (1970–76) the Mexican government actively intervened as a producer of cinema. Under this new policy the government paid for the amplification of &quot;Reed: Insurgent Mexico&quot; to 35 mm. This was the only time the Mexican government intervened in one of Leduc&#x27;s films. For the rest of his career he funded his films independently, through universities and unions, and with collective efforts. Leduc&#x27;s works reflects a person&#x27;s concern for certainty. &quot;Etnocidio: notas sobre el Mezquital&quot; is a powerful documentary on the extermination of the native peoples in Latin America. This documentary shows how the Otomi Indians of the Mezquital region in Mexico relate to their experiences with “civilized” society. The creation of the film was through a collaborative effort, the “script” was written by Roger Bartra, Mexico&#x27;s top leading rural sociologist. This film was based on Bartra&#x27;s years of research in the Mezquital region.

== Critically acclaimed films ==
&quot;Reed: Insurgent Mexico&quot; is one of Leduc&#x27;s most accomplished fictions in film, and was the first really distinctive work of the &quot;New Cinema&quot; movement in Mexico. The film was produced on a very small budget with a 16 mm camera. Purposely undramatic, Reed interprets the Mexican revolution (1910–17) in a way that had not been seen since Fernando De Fuentes&#x27;s masterpieces of 1933–35. This film provides the viewer with a beautiful sepia tone which helps reproduce the environment of historic revolutionary setting. A Mexican critic, Jorge Ayala Blanco, described Reed as &quot;raging against, incinerating, and annihilating the spider web that had been knitted over the once-living image of the revolution, while briefly illuminating the nocturnal ruins of our temporal and cultural distance from the men who participated in that upheaval.&quot; The film is a dramatization of John Reed&#x27;s famous account of the Mexican revolution, &quot;Insurgent Mexico&quot;, with Reed as the main character.

Leduc&#x27;s most critically acclaimed film is &quot;Frida: Naturaleza viva&quot;. This film is regarded as a highly expressionist and lyrical work on the famous Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. Leduc is credited with succeeding in recreating Frida&#x27;s passionate existence and her pain. This film kept words to a minimum whether spoken or written. This style was highly experimental. Leduc breaks from traditional cinematographic styles, the absence of dialogue, to reduce the famous figures of history and culture such as Frida Kahlo to cartoons of themselves. He uses the film to develop these characters in a way that allows them to remain at the lowest common denominator of the popular stereotypes fomented in mass culture. What makes this film unique is the sense of time. “The director observes no sense of chronology, moving forwards and backwards in time as Frida grows younger or older, scene by scene.”

==Documentaries ==
Leduc produced several documentaries, among them:
* &quot;Parto psicoprofiláctico (1969)&quot; 
* &quot;Bach y sus intérpretes (1975)&quot; 
* &quot;Etnocidio: notas sobre el Mezquital&quot;; &quot;Estudios para un retrato&quot; ( &quot;Francis Bacon&quot; ) (1978) 
* &quot;Puebla hoy (1978)&quot; 
* &quot;Monjas coronadas&quot; (1978) 
* &quot;ABC del etnocidio: notas sobre el Mezquital&quot; (1976), and 
* &quot;Puebla hoy&quot; (1979).

==Films ==
Leduc also produced films about historical events, such as: 
* &quot;Comunicados del comité nacional de huelga&quot; (1968) 
* &quot;&quot; (1973), a dramatization based on the firsthand reports of the Mexican Revolution by journalist John Reed. 
* Sur, sureste 2604; El mar (1974) 
* Historias prohibidas de Pulgarcito (1979)
* &quot;Complót petróleo: la cabeza de la hidra&quot; (1981).
* &quot;¿Cómo ves?&quot; (&quot;Whaddya Think?&quot;) (1982)
* &quot;Frida: Naturaleza viva&quot; (&quot;Frida&quot;) (1984)
* &quot;Barroco&quot; (&quot;Baroque&quot;) (1989)
* &quot;Dólar mambo&quot; (1993).
* &quot;Latino Bar&quot; (1995)
* &quot;Los Animales 1850–1950 (1995)&quot;

==History==

*1989-1990 - Las Palmas Productions, Inc. develops a proprietary tape to film transfer process that creates high quality film recordings.
*1993 - EFILM offers its film recording services to commercial, music video and movie trailer producers.
*1994 - EFILM adds high resolution scanning to its list of services.
*1995 - The company creates the world&#x27;s first 2K digital intermediate color timing sequences for &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. The images are scanned, color timed and film recorded on the company&#x27;s custom systems. The digital color timing system worked in real time via proxy images and allowed for interactive primary and secondary color corrections. The color settings were later applied to the 2K images. 25 minutes of special effects sequences were color timed this way under the creative direction of the film&#x27;s visual effects designer, John Dykstra. This custom built system predated most, if not all, other high resolution color timing systems.
:EFILM adds 65 mm film recording as a service for theatrical clients, theme parks, museums and other special venues. EFILM completed several 65 mm film recording projects including T2-3D: Battle Across Time, which open at Universal Florida in the summer of 1996.
*1996 - The company develops digital laboratory software that is used throughout EFILM for almost every step of the workflow including scanning, tape to film, film recording and video and digital cinema deliverables. Their Etron software performs all the image processing needs for most jobs.
*1997 - EFILM introduces its EWorks digital color correction software designed with a proprietary viewing approach that allowed the timer to accurately match photographed and digital images at any resolution.

<text>Al Lewis (born Abraham Meister; April 30, 1923 – February 3, 2006) was an American actor and activist, best known for his role as Grandpa on the television series &quot;The Munsters&quot; from 1964 to 1966 and its film versions. He previously also co-starred with &quot;The Munsters&quot; Fred Gwynne in the television show &quot;Car 54, Where Are You? &quot; from 1961–1963. Later in life, he was a restaurant owner, political candidate, and radio broadcaster.

==Early life==
Lewis was born Abraham Meister on April 30, 1923 in Manhattan, New York City. His parents Alexander and Ida (&quot;née&quot; Neidel), a house painter from Minsk and a garment worker respectively, were Jewish
immigrants from the Russian Empire; His two brothers were Phillip and Henry. He had originally given his birth year as 1910. His reputed early radio work in the mid-1930s would indicate the earlier birth date, as did an off-the-cuff remark on the TVLegends interview, 2002, where he says &quot;not a bad memory for 92&quot;. Ted Lewis, his son, firmly said his father was born in 1923 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York. Other sources placed his birth in Wolcott, New York, but no official record of his birth has been published to date (2006), and officials in Wolcott say they have no record of any Meister. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Lewis was born Albert Meister, probably in 1923, but he insisted that he was born in 1910. This, and Lewis&#x27;s many other questionable stories, means that much of the actor&#x27;s life is a broth of conjecture that his fans will no doubt squabble over for years to come.&quot; On his application for a Social Security number, completed sometime between 1936 and 1950, Lewis gave his date of birth as April 30, 1923. The 1925 New York State census lists Abe Meister, age 2, living with his parents Alexander and Ida Meister on 99th Street. The 1940 census lists an Albert Meister &quot;age 16&quot; living on Douglass (today&#x27;s Strauss) Street in Brooklyn, New York.

In a 1998 interview with Walt Shepperd, Lewis said:

===Education===
According to a report in &quot;The Jewish Week&quot;, Al Lewis attended Yeshiva Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn, New York, in his youth and &quot;asked annoying questions to the teachers.&quot; Lewis then attended Thomas Jefferson High School, which he left in his junior year. He claimed to have attended Oswego State Teachers College (now SUNY Oswego), notwithstanding his lack of a high school diploma, and to have earned a Ph.D. in child psychology from Columbia University in 1941, of which Columbia has no record. Lewis did send at least one of his children to Yeshiva in the San Fernando Valley.

==Career==
===Acting===

In 1949, after a suggestion from a friend, he decided to pursue a career as an actor after joining the Paul Mann Actors&#x27; Workshop in New York. He worked in burlesque and vaudeville theaters, then on Broadway in the dramas &quot;The Night Circus&quot; (1958) and &quot;One More River&quot; (1960) and as the character Moe Shtarker in the musical comedy &quot;Do Re Mi&quot; (1962).

His earliest television work includes appearances on the crime drama &quot;Decoy&quot; and &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;. From 1959 to 1963, he appeared in four episodes of &quot;Naked City&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s first well-known television role was as Officer Leo Schnauser on the sitcom &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; from 1961 to 1963, also starring Fred Gwynne (Lewis reprised the role in the 1994 movie of the same name). In the series, Lewis first played Al Spencer the Auto Body Man and a property developer in two early first-season episodes, then landed the more familiar role of Officer Schnauser. He is best remembered as Grandpa on &quot;The Munsters&quot;, which ran on CBS from 1964 to 1966.

In 1967, Lewis played the part of Zalto the magician in the &quot;Lost in Space&quot; episode &quot;Rocket to Earth&quot;. His first role in a movie was as Machine Gun Manny in &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; (1960). He had small roles in &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot; (1964), &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969), and &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot; (1971). He appeared as Hanging Judge Harrison in &quot;Used Cars&quot; (1980), played a security guard on an episode of &quot;Taxi&quot;, and had a minor role in &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; (1988). His last film role was in &quot;Night Terror&quot; (2002).
In 1991, he appeared as Grandpa in an episode of &quot;Hi Honey, I&#x27;m Home&quot; on ABC. In 1991, he appeared in a low-budget movie titled &quot;Grampire&quot; (&quot;My Grandpa Is a Vampire&quot; in the U.S. version), wearing much the same costume as he did in &quot;The Munsters&quot;. From 1987 to 1989, Lewis hosted &quot;Super Scary Saturday&quot; on TBS in his Grandpa outfit. This was parodied in &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; with the character of Grandpa Fred (Robert Prosky). Lewis also used the role to promote a 1-900 number known as &quot;the Junior Vampire Club&quot; and in a series of public domain VHS compilations for Amvest Video.

===Other pursuits===
Lewis was a proponent of free speech and frequently spoke out in the late 1980s and early 1990s against government entities such as the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and non-government entities such as the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center). A recurring guest on the Howard Stern Show, Lewis famously uttered the phrase &quot;fuck the FCC&quot;, during a 1987 speech at a &quot;Howard Stern Freedom Rally&quot; held in Manhattan and organized by the radio personality. Lewis shouted the phrase repeatedly until Stern was able to take the microphone away from him. The FCC did not punish Stern or the station for Lewis&#x27;s comments and Stern later used the speech as the opening track of Stern&#x27;s Crucified by the FCC comedy album in early 1999.

Lewis appeared in an episode of &quot;The American Experience&quot; where he recalled his experiences at Coney Island, which he frequently visited and worked at as a game barker. He was featured in the Atari 7800 videogame &quot;Midnight Mutants&quot;, an action-adventure title with a Halloween theme. His appearance in the game mirrored his Grandpa persona in &quot;The Munsters&quot;.

In 1987, he opened an Italian restaurant named Grampa&#x27;s Bella Gente at 252 Bleecker Street in Manhattan. In September 1989, he licensed a comedy club named Grampa&#x27;s to an entrepreneurial mafia family named Cataldo in New Dorp Plaza in Staten Island.

==Politics==
As a left-wing activist, he hosted a politically oriented radio program on WBAI (whose theme song was King Curtis&#x27; &quot;Foot Pattin&#x27;&quot;) and ran as Green Party candidate for governor of New York in 1998. In that race, he sought to be listed on the ballot as Grandpa Al Lewis, arguing that he was most widely known by that name. His request was rejected by the Board of Elections, a decision upheld in court against his challenge.

Despite this setback, he achieved one of his campaign objectives. His total of 52,533 votes exceeded the threshold of votes set by New York law (50,000) and hence guaranteed the Green Party of New York an automatic ballot line for the next four years (see New York gubernatorial elections). He said that, with no political machine and no money backing him, the likelihood of winning the governorship would be &quot;like climbing Mount Everest barefooted&quot;. In 2000, he sought the Green Party nomination for US Senate; he ultimately placed second in the primary, with about 32 percent of the vote, losing to Mark Dunau.

==Personal life and final years==
Lewis married Marge Domowitz in 1956, with whom he had three sons, Dave, Ted, and Paul. The marriage ended in divorce in 1977. In 1984, he married actress Karen Ingenthron, to whom he remained married for the rest of his life.

In his final years, he resided on Roosevelt Island in New York City. In 2003, he was hospitalized for an angioplasty, and complications from the surgery led to an emergency bypass and the amputation of his right leg below the knee as well as all of the toes on his left foot. He died on February 3, 2006, of natural causes in Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island.

<text>Jacopo Carucci or Carrucci (; May 24, 1494 – January 2, 1557), usually known as Jacopo (da) Pontormo or simply Pontormo (), was an Italian Mannerist painter and portraitist from the Florentine School. His work represents a profound stylistic shift from the calm perspectival regularity that characterized the art of the Florentine Renaissance. He is famous for his use of twining poses, coupled with ambiguous perspective; his figures often seem to float in an uncertain environment, unhampered by the forces of gravity.

==Biography and early work==

Jacopo Carucci was born at Pontorme (then known as Pontormo or Puntormo), near Empoli, to Bartolomeo di Jacopo di Martino Carrucci and Alessandra di Pasquale di Zanobi. Vasari relates how the orphaned boy, &quot;young, melancholy, and lonely&quot;, was shuttled around as a young apprentice:


Pontormo painted in and around Florence, often supported by Medici patronage. A foray to Rome, largely to see Michelangelo&#x27;s work, influenced his later style. Haunted faces and elongated bodies are characteristic of his work. An example of Pontormo&#x27;s early style is a fresco depicting the Visitation of the Virgin and St Elizabeth, with its dancelike, balanced figures, painted from 1514 to 1516.

This early &quot;Visitation&quot; makes an interesting comparison with his painting of the same subject which was done about a decade later, now housed in the parish church of St. Michael Archangel in Carmignano, about 20 km west of Florence. Placing these two pictures together—one from his early style, and another from his mature period—throws Pontormo&#x27;s artistic development into sharp relief. In the earlier work, Pontormo is much closer in style to his teacher, Andrea del Sarto, and to the early sixteenth-century renaissance artistic principles. For example, the figures stand at just under half the height of the overall picture, and though a bit more crowded than true high renaissance balance would prefer, at least are placed in a classicizing architectural setting at a comfortable distance from the viewer. In the later work, the viewer is brought almost uncomfortably close to the Virgin and St. Elizabeth, who drift toward each other in clouds of drapery. Moreover, the clear architectural setting that is carefully constructed in the earlier piece has been completely abandoned in favour of a peculiar nondescript urban setting.

The Joseph canvases (now in the National Gallery in London) offer another example of Pontormo&#x27;s developing style. Done around the same time as the earlier &quot;Visitation&quot;, these works (such as &quot;Joseph in Egypt&quot;, at left) show a much more mannerist leaning. According to Giorgio Vasari, the sitter for the boy seated on a step is his young apprentice, Bronzino.

In the years between the SS Annunziata and San Michele &quot;Visitation&quot;s, Pontormo took part in the fresco decoration of the salon of the Medici country villa at Poggio a Caiano (1519–20), 17 km NNW of Florence. There he painted frescoes in a pastoral genre style, very uncommon for Florentine painters; their subject was the obscure classical myth of &quot;Vertumnus and Pomona&quot; in a lunette.

In 1522, when the plague broke out in Florence, Pontormo left for the Certosa di Galluzzo, a cloistered Carthusian monastery where the monks followed vows of silence. He painted a series of frescoes, now quite damaged, on the passion and resurrection of Christ. These frescoes reveal especially strongly the influence of Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s engravings, which often provided inspiration to Pontormo after he returned to Florence.

==Main works in Florence==

The large altarpiece canvas for the Brunelleschi-designed Capponi Chapel in the church of Santa Felicita, Florence, portraying &quot;The Deposition from the Cross&quot; (1528), is considered by many Pontormo&#x27;s surviving masterpiece.

The figures, with their sharply modelled forms and brilliant colours, are united in an enormously complex, swirling ovular composition, housed by a shallow, somewhat flattened space. Although commonly known as &quot;The Deposition from the Cross&quot;, there is no actual cross in the picture. The scene might more properly be called a &quot;Lamentation&quot; or &quot;Bearing the Body of Christ&quot;. Those who are lowering (or supporting) Christ appear as anguished as the mourners. Though they are bearing the weight of a full-grown man, they barely seem to be touching the ground; the lower figure in particular balances delicately and implausibly on his front two toes. These two boys have sometimes been interpreted as angels, carrying Christ in his journey to Heaven. In this case, the subject of the picture would be more akin to an &quot;Entombment&quot;, though the lack of any discernible tomb disrupts that theory, just as the lack of cross poses a problem for the &quot;Deposition&quot; interpretation. Finally, it has also been noted that the positions of Christ and the Virgin seem to echo those of Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Pietà&quot; in Rome, though here in the &quot;Deposition&quot; mother and son have been separated. Thus in addition to elements of a &quot;Lamentation&quot; and &quot;Entombment&quot;, this picture carries hints of a &quot;Pietà&quot;. It has been speculated that the bearded figure in the background at the far right is a self-portrait of Pontormo as Joseph of Arimathea. Another unique feature of this particular &quot;Deposition&quot; is the empty space occupying the central pictorial plane as all the Biblical personages seem to fall back from this point. It has been suggested that this emptiness may be a physical representation of the Virgin Mary&#x27;s emotional emptiness at the prospect of losing her son.

On the wall to the right of the &quot;Deposition&quot;, Pontormo frescoed an &quot;Annunciation&quot; scene (at left). As with the &quot;Deposition&quot;, the artist&#x27;s primary attention is on the figures themselves rather than their setting. Placed against white walls, the Angel Gabriel and Virgin Mary are presented in an environment that is so simplified as to almost seem stark. The fictive architectural details above each of them, are painted to resemble the gray stone &quot;pietra serena&quot; that adorns the interior of Santa Felicità, thus uniting their painted space with the viewer&#x27;s actual space. The startling contrast between the figures and ground makes their brilliant garments almost seem to glow in the light of the window between them, against the stripped-down background, as if the couple miraculously appeared in an extension of the chapel wall. The &quot;Annunciation&quot; resembles his above-mentioned &quot;Visitation&quot; in the church of San Michele at Carmignano in both the style and swaying postures.

Vasari tells us that the cupola was originally painted with God the Father and Four Patriarchs. The decoration in the dome of the chapel is now lost, but four roundels with the Evangelists still adorn the pendentives, worked on by both Pontormo and his chief pupil Agnolo Bronzino. The two artists collaborated so closely that specialists dispute which roundels each of them painted.

This tumultuous oval of figures took three years for Pontormo to complete. According to Vasari, because Pontormo desired above all to &quot;do things his own way without being bothered by anyone,&quot; the artist screened off the chapel so as to prevent interfering opinions. Vasari continues, &quot;And so, having painted it in his own way without any of his friends being able to point anything out to him, it was finally uncovered and seen with astonishment by all of Florence...&quot;

A number of Pontormo&#x27;s other works have also remained in Florence; the Uffizi Gallery holds his mystical &quot;Supper at Emmaus&quot; as well as portraits.

Many of Pontormo&#x27;s well-known canvases, such as the early &quot;Joseph in Egypt&quot; series () and the later &quot;Martyrdom of St Maurice and the Theban Legion&quot; () depict crowds milling about in extreme contrapposto of greatly varied positions.

His portraits, acutely characterized, show similarly Mannerist proportions.

==Lost or damaged works==

Many of Pontormo&#x27;s works have been damaged, including the lunettes for the cloister in the Carthusian monastery of Galluzo. They now are displayed indoors, although in their damaged state.

Perhaps most tragic is the loss of the unfinished frescoes for the choir of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence which consumed the last decade of his life. His frescoes depicted a Last Judgment day composed of an unsettling morass of writhing figures. The remaining drawings, showing a bizarre and mystical ribboning of bodies, had an almost hallucinatory effect. Florentine figure painting had mainly stressed linear and sculptural figures. For example, the Christ in Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Last Judgment&quot; in the Sistine Chapel is a massive painted block, stern in his wrath; by contrast, Pontormo&#x27;s Jesus in the &quot;Last Judgment&quot; twists sinuously, as if rippling through the heavens in the dance of ultimate finality. Angels swirl about him in even more serpentine poses. If Pontormo&#x27;s work from the 1520s seemed to float in a world little touched by gravitational force, the &quot;Last Judgment&quot; figures seem to have escaped it altogether and flail through rarefied air.

In his &quot;Last Judgment,&quot; Pontormo went against pictorial and theological tradition by placing God the Father at the feet of Christ, instead of above him, an idea Vasari found deeply disturbing:

But I have never been able to understand the significance of this scene, ... I mean, what he could have intended to signify in that part where there is Christ on high, raising the dead, and below His feet is God the Father, who is creating Adam and Eve. Besides this, in one of the corners, where are the four Evangelists, nude, with books in their hands, it does not seem to me that in a single place did he give a thought to any order of composition, or measurement, or time, or variety in the heads, or diversity in the flesh-colours, or, in a word, to any rule, proportion or law of perspective, for the whole work is full of nude figures with an order, design, invention, composition, colouring, and painting contrived after his own fashion ...

==Critical assessment and legacy==

Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; of Pontormo depicts him as withdrawn and steeped in neurosis while at the centre of the artists and patrons of his lifetime. This image of Pontormo has tended to colour the popular conception of the artist, as seen in the film of Giovanni Fago, &quot;Pontormo, a heretical love&quot;. Fago portrays Pontormo as mired in a lonely and ultimately paranoid dedication to his final &quot;Last Judgment&quot; project, which he often kept shielded from onlookers. Yet as the art historian Elizabeth Pilliod has pointed out, Vasari was in fierce competition with the Pontormo/Bronzino workshop at the time when he was writing his &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;. This professional rivalry between the two &quot;bottega&quot;s could well have provided Vasari with ample motivation for running down the artistic lineage of his opponent for Medici patronage.
Perhaps as a result of Vasari&#x27;s derision, or perhaps because of the vagaries of aesthetic taste, Pontormo&#x27;s work was quite out of fashion for several centuries. The fact that so much of his work has been lost or severely damaged is a testament to this neglect, though he has received renewed attention from contemporary art historians. Indeed, between 1989 and 2002, Pontormo&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Halberdier&quot; (at right), held the title of the world&#x27;s most expensive painting by an Old Master.

Regardless of the veracity of Vasari&#x27;s account, it is certainly true that Pontormo&#x27;s artistic idiosyncrasies produced a style that few were able (or willing) to imitate, with the exception of his closest pupil Bronzino. Bronzino&#x27;s early work is so close to that of his teacher, that the authorship of several paintings from the 1520s and &#x27;30s is still under dispute—for example, the four &quot;tondi&quot; containing the Evangelists in the Capponi Chapel.

Pontormo shares some of the mannerism of Rosso Fiorentino and of Parmigianino. In some ways, he anticipated the Baroque as well as the tensions of El Greco. His eccentricities also resulted in an original sense of composition. At best, his compositions are cohesive. The figures in the &quot;Deposition&quot;, for example, appear to sustain each other: removal of any one of them would cause the edifice to collapse. In other works, as in the Joseph canvases, the crowding makes for a confusing pictorial melee. It is in the later drawings that we see a graceful fusion of bodies in a composition which includes the oval frame of Jesus in the &quot;Last Judgement&quot;.

<text>Logroño () is the capital of the autonomous community of La Rioja, Spain. Located in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, primarily in the right (South) bank of the Ebro River, Logroño has historically been a place of passage, such as the Camino de Santiago. Its borders were disputed between the Iberian kingdoms of Castille, Navarre and Aragon during the Middle Ages.
The population of the city in 2021 was 150,808 while the metropolitan area included nearly 200,000 inhabitants. The city is a centre of trade of Rioja wine, for which the area is noted, and manufacturing of wood, metal and textile products.

== Etymology ==

=== Origin of the name ===
The origin of this toponym is, as for many other places, unknown. The name &quot;Lucronio&quot; was first used in a document from 965 where García Sánchez I of Pamplona donated the place so named to the Monastery of San Millán. In the Fuero of Logroño from 1095 it appeared under the name &quot;Logronio&quot;, except once when it was called &quot;illo Gronio&quot;. The most broadly accepted theses seem to be those which indicate it is a late latinization by prefixing the article &quot;lo/illo&quot; to the old toponym &quot;Gronio&quot;/&quot;Gronno&quot;, a word of Celtic origin which means &quot;the ford&quot; or &quot;the pass&quot;. It is believed that this name was due to the frequent use of this place to cross the Ebro river.

Other historians have proposed alternative theories, such as a possible derivation from &quot;Lucus Brun&quot; or &quot;Lucus Beronius&quot; (&quot;Sacred place in the Beronian forest&quot;), but its etymology remains unknown.

=== Titles ===
John II of Castile granted it the title of &quot;City&quot; on 7 February 1431 in Palencia and ratified it on 20 February in Valladolid, thus it stopped being called &quot;Village&quot;, despite there being no explicit justification of the reasons for that change. 20 July 1444 the same king added the titles of &quot;Very noble&quot;, , and &quot;Very loyal&quot;, , which up until today appear in the seal of the city. In this case, the reason was the loyalty of the habitants against the homonymous king John II of Aragon, because despite the &quot;«long war, and wounds and deaths, and robberies, and fires, and damages and oppressions»&quot;, the city remained loyal to the service of the king of Castile.

On 5 July 1523, the king Francis I granted it the three fleurs-de-lis for the shield of the city for its resistance during the French siege in 1521.

It also received by Royal Decree the title of &quot;Excellence&quot; 6 December 1854 from Isabella II, as a reward for its behavior during the cholera epidemic which devastated the city.

== History ==
Logroño was an old settlement, first of the Romans, under the name of Vareia, a commercial port that was founded near an older city of the Berones. From the 10th century, possession of Logroño was disputed between the kings of Navarre and those of Castile; the region was finally annexed to Castile. The name is a combination of le and Groin, mashed together as Logroño over time. Alfonso VI of Castile granted Logroño in 1095 a charter of rights that served as a model for other Spanish cities. In 1609 and 1610 Logroño was the main seat of the Basque witch trials, part of the Spanish Inquisition.

<text>Santa Cruz de Tenerife (; ), commonly abbreviated as Santa Cruz, is a city, the capital of the island of Tenerife, Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and one of the capitals of the Canary Islands, along with Las Palmas. Santa Cruz has a population of 211,436 (2024) within its administrative limits. The urban zone of Santa Cruz extends beyond the city limits with a population of 507,306 and 538,000 within urban area. It is the second largest city in the Canary Islands and the main city on the island of Tenerife, with nearly half of the island&#x27;s population living in or around it.

Santa Cruz is located in the northeast quadrant of Tenerife, off the north-western coast of Africa within the Atlantic Ocean. The distance to the nearest point of mainland Spain is . Between the 1833 territorial division of Spain and 1927, Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the sole capital of the Canary Islands, until 1927 when the archipelago was split into the current two provinces. The port is of great importance and is the communications hub between Europe, Africa and Americas, with cruise ships arriving from many nations. The city is the focus for domestic and inter-island communications in the Canary Islands.

The city is home to the Parliament of the Canary Islands, the Audience of Accounts of the Canary Islands, the Captaincy General of the Canary Islands, the Canarias Ministry of the Presidency (shared on a four-year cycle with Las Palmas), one half of the Ministries and Boards of the Canarias Government, (the other half being located in Gran Canaria), the Tenerife Provincial Courts and two courts of the Superior Court of Justice of the Canary Islands. There are several faculties of the La Laguna University in Santa Cruz, including the Fine Arts School and the Naval Sciences Faculty. Its harbour is one of Spain&#x27;s busiest. It is important for commercial and passenger traffic as well as for being a major stopover for cruisers en route from Europe to the Caribbean. The city also has one of the world&#x27;s largest carnivals. The Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife now aspires to become a World Heritage Site, and is the second largest in the world.

The varied architecture of the city stands out, highlighting the Auditorio de Tenerife (&quot;Auditorium of Tenerife&quot;), which is considered one of the greatest exponents of contemporary architecture. In the panoramic view of the city, the Torres de Santa Cruz (&quot;Santa Cruz Towers&quot;) also stand out, with the tallest twin towers in Spain at high. Other outstanding places are the Plaza de España (&quot;Spain Square&quot;), which is the nerve center of the city, and the Parque García Sanabria (&quot;García Sanabria Park&quot;), a large urban park located in the center of the city. Outside the city but in its municipal district, Playa de Las Teresitas (&quot;Las Teresitas&quot;) and a large part of the Macizo de Anaga (&quot;Anaga Massif&quot;) stand out, declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2015. Santa Cruz de Tenerife hosts the first headquarters of the Center UNESCO in the Canary Islands. In recent years the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife has seen the construction of a significant number of modern structures and the city&#x27;s skyline is the sixth in height across the country, behind Madrid, Benidorm, Barcelona, Valencia and Bilbao.

In 2012, the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; included Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the list of the five best places in the world to live, next to the Cihangir district, in Istanbul; the district of Sankt Pauli, in Hamburg, the north coast of Maui, in Hawaii and Portland, in Oregon. The 82% of the municipal territory of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is considered a natural area, this is due in large part to the presence of the Anaga Rural Park. This fact makes Santa Cruz the third largest municipality in Spain with the highest percentage of natural territory, after Cuenca (87%) and Cáceres (83%). 

==Etymology==
The area where Santa Cruz currently lies belonged to Menceyato Guanche Anaga, which was the most easterly of the island. The city that is now Santa Cruz had a few names throughout its history: Añazo or Añaza (Guanche name), Puerto de Santiago Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Santa Cruz de Santiago de Tenerife, and Santa Cruz de Tenerife (current), which means: &quot;holy cross of Tenerife,&quot; in memory of the foundation of the city, when a Christian cross was planted in the place that is now the center of town.

==History==


===Guanche period, conquest and Castilian colonization===
The area on which now stands the city and the municipality of Santa Cruz de Tenerife has been the subject of human occupation since the time of the Guanches, approximately 2000 years ago, as attested by the archaeological sites found. The area was known to the Guanches, the first inhabitants of the island, as &quot;Añazo&quot; or &quot;Añaza&quot;. The famous Mummy of San Andrés is one of the most important archaeological remains of the aboriginal past of the region. Besides caves with some remains of mummified animals and stones with engravings ruprestres. This area belonged to the Menceyato de Anaga (aboriginal Guanche kingdom of Anaga), one of nine in which the island was divided.

On 3 May 1494 Castilian troops under the control of the conqueror Alonso Fernández de Lugo disembarked on the beaches of the present city and founded a military camp that would eventually develop into the city. From this place began the conquest of the island of Tenerife. During the foundation, Alonso Fernández de Lugo placed a large wooden cross in reference to the day of disembarkation, during the Catholic festivity of the Invention of the Cross (3 May). After the conquest and defeat of the Guanche aborigines, the capital of the island was initially established in the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, which was founded in the same year of the conquest of the island in 1496.

===Old Regime and Modern Stage===
Later, it became one of the most important ports of the Atlantic, a status it retains to this day. This former fishermen&#x27;s village rose to prominence after a Volcano destroyed the port of Garachico in the 18th century. Santa Cruz became the major port on the Island. It first won its independence from La Laguna and, in the 19th century, was awarded the status of Capital of the Province of Canary Islands by King Ferdinand VII.

Between 1833 and 1927 Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the sole capital of the Canary Islands. In 1927 a Royal decree ordered that the status of capital city of the Canary Islands would be shared with Las Palmas in Gran Canaria. This arrangement remains in place today.

In 1893 an outbreak of cholera-morbid spread throughout the city and neighboring municipalities. The disease was brought by an Italian ship returning from Brazil. There were 382 dead.

Between 1936 and 1939, during the Spanish Civil War, the Canary Islands were in the rear of General Francisco Franco&#x27;s side. In this context, in 1936 the republican mayor of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, José Carlos Schwartz Hernández, was arrested and murdered. After the war, years of great economic difficulties followed.

From 1978, with the new Spanish Constitution and the Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands, a new stage began, always with democratically elected mayors.

In the 80s and 90s of the 20th century, the city experiences a great economic boom. The expansion of the city towards the south begins gaining ground to the Santa Cruz de Tenerife Refinery and creating new residential and urbanizable areas such as Cabo-Llanos. Since then, this area of the city is immersed in a major construction boom that has been nicknamed &quot;Manhattanization&quot;, due to the presence of tall buildings and the layout of the streets that mimics that of American cities.

===Current era: 21st century===
Santa Cruz inaugurated the 21st century with a great expansionary and commercial boom that is especially manifested in architecture with the construction of emblematic buildings such as the Auditorio de Tenerife, the work of Santiago Calatrava or the remodeling of the Plaza de España according to the design of Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron.

A torrential flood took place on 31st March 2002. This was caused by a phenomenon of cold drop characterized by the repeated fall of torrential rain accompanied by lightning, which affected the metropolitan area of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The flooding caused 8 dead, 12 missing and dozens injured.

In recent years, it has become clear that there exists a &quot;de facto&quot; union with neighbouring city San Cristóbal de La Laguna (141,627 inhabitants as in 2005 census) due to the rapid population growth and reduction in undeveloped space between the cities, as their suburbs merged, forming a metropolitan area with 420,198 inhabitants (including the nearby municipalities of Tegueste, Candelaria and El Rosario). Regarding this situation, the mayor of Santa Cruz, Miguel Zerolo Aguilar and his La Laguna counterpart, Ana María Oramas Moro, both belonging to the Canarian Coalition, stated several times to local media that they shared a willingness to proceed to a full political union between their municipalities, even though the decision was postponed to a date after the local elections in 2007. As of 2012 the merger is no longer part of the political agenda.

The 2007–2008 financial crisis paralyzed the development of the city for more than a decade.

In June 2018, the dismantling of the Santa Cruz de Tenerife Refinery was announced, which will allow the expansion of the city to the south.

==Administrative divisions==
Santa Cruz is divided administratively into five districts, which in turn are subdivided into districts, not necessarily consistent with the traditional neighborhoods.
==Demographics==

In 1990, the population peaked above the 200,000 mark. Santa Cruz de Tenerife and the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna form a continuous urban area, with a combined population of over 380,000 inhabitants.

Ethnically, the population is mainly of European origin, primarily from the Iberian Península, both Spain and Portugal, with some mix of the island&#x27;s original inhabitants, the Guanches. There has been some Latin American immigration (especially from Cuba and Venezuela) as well as from both Northern and Sub-Sahara Africa. There are also important historical minorities such as Indians (Sindhi), Koreans (see Koreans in Spain) and, more recently, Russians. The majority of the population professes the Catholic religion, but there are also small communities of Hindus and Muslims. In Santa Cruz de Tenerife, crime has decreased in recent years and the city has gained a reputation for tolerance among its inhabitants. In fact, Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the first city of the Canary Islands to display the rainbow flag alongside the flag of the City Council, in June 2008.

In comparison with the nearby city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, which is the seat of Bishopric of Tenerife, traditionally the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife has had a much more secular character. This fact brought about in the city institutions of deep secular tradition such as the Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife that was one of the largest masonic centers in Spain.

According to a study by the National Statistics Institute of Spain (INE), among the two Canarian capitals, Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the one with the highest life expectancy at 81 years. Just behind Santa Cruz is Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, with 80.9 years.

==Metropolitan area==

The Santa Cruz de Tenerife-La Laguna Metropolitan Area forms the second largest city and metropolitan area of the European Union outside Europe. According to data provided by the Canary Islands Government and Cabildo de Tenerife the metropolitan area of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is composed of the municipalities of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, San Cristobal de La Laguna, El Rosario and Tegueste with a population of 404,913 inhabitants in 2008 in the city&#x27;s area, giving a population density of .

According to AUDES5 this conurbation also comprises the municipalities of Tacoronte and El Sauzal, bringing the total population of the urban population would reach 581.947 (2008).

The cities of Santa Cruz and San Cristobal de La Laguna and urban are physically linked, so that together have a population of over 382,331 inhabitants, making them the largest urban area in the Canaries (independent of municipal lines).

==Infrastructure==

As the centre of the Tenerife Metropolitan Area, Santa Cruz is the hub for the island&#x27;s motorway network. The long Autopista TF-1 links the south of the island, including Playa de las Américas and other southern resorts and towns, with its capital. The motorway itself starts near the Auditorio and gives access to Santa Cruz and La Laguna by three different routes.

Autopista TF-5 links Santa Cruz with the Puerto de la Cruz, La Orotava and the northern side of the island, passing right through La Laguna before entering Santa Cruz.

The Santa Cruz harbour is one of the busiest in Spain; three quays host regular ferries, fast ferries, cruise ships and merchant ships.

Tenerife North Airport, formerly Los Rodeos Airport, is adjacent to Autopista TF-5 on the western outskirts of the city.

The mostly tourist Tenerife South Airport, formerly Reina Sofia Airport, ranks 7th in Spain and is located next to the Autopista TF-1, south of Santa Cruz. There are plans to link this airport to the capital with a railway network.

The Intercambiador public transport/mass transit terminal is in the Avenida 3 de Mayo, and is the hub for all TITSA bus lines, the Tenerife Tram service, and is a major car-parking area.

The first tram line (opened in 2007) line 1, starts at the Intercambiador, and ends at La Laguna&#x27;s Avenida Trinidad, with a planned extension to Tenerife North Airport A second line between La Cuesta and Tíncer opened in 2009 (connecting with Line 1 at Hospital Universitario and El Cardonal).

Cabo-Llanos (south of downtown) is the location of new expansion. This area is undergoing a major building boom which has been nicknamed &quot;Manhattanization&quot;, where tall, modern buildings and street layouts imitate American cities.

==Economy==
Santa Cruz de Tenerife has the highest concentration of shops in the Canary Islands. The economy of Santa Cruz relies mainly on services. Trade, tourism, import-export, the seaport and the presence of the major political and financial institutions, as well as the most important companies, guarantee a strong economic activity and development. The building sector is important, while industry, apart from the oil refinery and food processing, is relatively minor. Santa Cruz has regenerated many areas of the city and modernised its infrastructure, built brand new areas, malls, high buildings and some charismatic structures, such as Calatrava&#x27;s &quot;Auditorio&quot; or the Congress Hall, César Manrique&#x27;s Marina and the not-yet-completed Óscar Domínguez Museum of Modern Art and Culture (IODACC) and the new Plaza de España layout, both by Basel-based Pritzker Prize winner studio Herzog &amp; de Meuron. Work to renew the man-made Las Teresitas Beach is ongoing under the direction of French architect Dominique Perrault.

==Naval history==
Due to the strategic location of Tenerife on the route between the Mediterranean and the Americas, it was attacked a number of times by the English and the Dutch. In particular, Santa Cruz Bay was the scene of two notable naval engagements involving two of the most famous British admirals.

In 1656, Admiral Robert Blake totally destroyed a Spanish silver fleet of 16 ships for the loss of none of his own, despite being under fire from shore batteries and attacking and withdrawing on the tide. 50 years later, the British under John Jennings were defeated when they attacked the island on 6 November 1706 during the War of the Spanish Succession.

In 1797 Admiral Horatio Nelson met with bloody defeat in an attempt to storm the harbour. It was at this battle that Nelson lost his right arm having been hit before he had stepped off the ship&#x27;s boat. It was on Santiago&#x27;s day and that is the reason for having Santiago&#x27;s sword cutting the lion&#x27;s head as a symbol of the British defeat.

===Masonic influence===

Santa Cruz de Tenerife is characterized, among other things, by the influence of Freemasonry exhibited by some of the most important historical buildings in the city, a palpable influence even on the plane of the city.

The city had a significant number of mayors and politicians affiliated with Freemasonry, especially between the 19th and early 20th centuries. In this city the Añaza Lodge (&quot;Logia Añaza&quot;) was founded in 1895, which was one of the most important Masonic workshops in Spain in the 20th century and helped consolidate Freemasonry in the Canary Islands and spread the culture and ideas of progress in the Canarian society of the time. Under its auspices the Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife will be built, located on Calle San Lucas and which was the largest Masonic center in Spain until the military occupation of the Franco regime.

The influence of Masonic symbolism on the architecture and urban planning of the city has been the subject of various academic studies, from the works of Professor Sebastián Hernández Gutiérrez of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, through the studies of Professor David Martín López from the University of Granada. More recently those of the architect Carlos Pallés, curator of the exhibitions &quot;&quot;Rostros de La Logia Añaza&quot; and &quot;Masonería y Sociedad&quot;&quot; held in 2014.

Melchor Padilla, professor of Geography and History at the University of La Laguna, maintains that by joining some of the buildings and enclaves with Masonic symbols of the city, they form a pentacle or five-pointed star that would extend through the center of the city and whose center would be the García Sanabria Park. 

In 2016 an international Masonic congress was held in Santa Cruz de Tenerife in which 17 regular supreme councils from different countries of the world participated, around 300 people participated in the congress.

<text>The minke whale (), or lesser rorqual, is a species complex of baleen whale. The two species of minke whale are the common (or northern) minke whale and the Antarctic (or southern) minke whale. The minke whale was first described by the Danish naturalist Otto Fabricius in 1780, who assumed it must be an already known species and assigned his specimen to &quot;Balaena rostrata&quot;, a name given to the northern bottlenose whale by Otto Friedrich Müller in 1776. In 1804, Bernard Germain de Lacépède described a juvenile specimen of &quot;Balaenoptera acuto-rostrata&quot;. The name is a partial translation of Norwegian &quot;minkehval&quot;, possibly after a Norwegian whaler named Meincke, who mistook a northern minke whale for a blue whale.

==Taxonomy==

Most modern classifications split the minke whale into two species:
* Common minke whale or northern minke whale (&quot;Balaenoptera acutorostrata&quot;), and

*Antarctic minke whale or southern minke whale (&quot;Balaenoptera bonaerensis&quot;).

Taxonomists further categorize the common minke whale into two or three subspecies; the North Atlantic minke whale, the North Pacific minke whale and dwarf minke whale. All minke whales are part of the rorquals, a family that includes the humpback whale, the fin whale, the Bryde&#x27;s whale, the sei whale and the blue whale.

The junior synonyms for &quot;B. acutorostrata&quot; are &quot;B. davidsoni&quot; (Scammon 1872), &quot;B. minimia&quot; (Rapp, 1837), and &quot;B. rostrata&quot; (Fabricius, 1780). There is one synonym for &quot;B. bonaerensis&quot; – &quot;B. huttoni&quot; (Gray 1874).

Writing in his 1998 classification, Rice recognized two of the subspecies of the common minke whale – &quot;B. a. scammoni&quot; (Scammon&#x27;s minke whale) and a further taxonomically unnamed subspecies found in the Southern Hemisphere, the dwarf minke whale (first described by Best as &quot;Type 3,&quot; 1985).

On at least one occasion, an Antarctic minke whale has been confirmed migrating to the Arctic. In addition, at least two wild hybrids between a common minke whale and an Antarctic minke whale have been confirmed.

==Description==
The minke whales are the second smallest baleen whale; only the pygmy right whale is smaller. Upon reaching sexual maturity (7–8 years of age), males measure an average of and and females measure an average of and in length and body mass, respectively; estimated maximum size for females suggest that they can reach lengths exceeding and weigh more than in body mass.

The minke whale has a black/gray/purple color. Common minke whales (Northern Hemisphere variety) are distinguished from other whales by a white band on each flipper. The body is usually black or dark-gray above and white underneath. Minke whales have between 240 and 360 baleen plates on each side of their mouths. Most of the length of the back, including dorsal fin and blowholes, appears at once when the whale surfaces to breathe.

Minke whales typically live between 30–50 years, but in some cases, they may live for up to 60 years. They have a gestation and calving period of approximately 10–11 months and 2 years, respectively.

Minke whales have a digestive system composed of four compartments with a high density of anaerobic bacteria throughout. The presence of the bacteria suggests minke whales rely on microbial digestion to extract nutrients provided by their food.

As with most Mysticetes, the auditory system for the minke whale is not well understood. However, magnetic resonance imaging points to evidence that the minke whale has fat deposits in their jaws intended for sound reception, much like Odontocetes.

The brains of minke whales have around 12.8 billion neocortical neurons and 98.2 billion neocortical glia. Additionally, despite its relatively large size, the minke whale is very fast, capable of swimming at speeds of , and their surfacing can be sporadic and hard to follow.

==Behavior==
The whale breathes three to five times at short intervals before &quot;deep-diving&quot; for 2 to 20 minutes. Deep dives are preceded by a pronounced arching of the back. The maximum swimming speed of minkes has been estimated at .

===Migration===
Both species undertake seasonal migration routes to the poles during spring and towards the tropics during fall and winter. The difference between the timing of the seasons may prevent the two closely related species from mixing. A long-term photo identification study on the British Columbian and Washington coasts showed that some individuals travel as far as 424 km north in the spring, and 398 km south to warmer waters in the autumn. Many specifics about migration in this species still remain unclear.

===Reproduction===

The gestation period for minke whales is ten months, and calves measure at birth. The newborns nurse for five to ten months. Breeding peaks during the summer months. Calving is thought to occur every two years.

The timing of conception and birth varies between region.

In the North Atlantic, conception takes place from December to May with a peak month of February with birth taking place from October to March with a peak in December. In the North Pacific off Japan there appears to be two phases of conception, the majority of which occurs from February to March but also from August to September, with births occurring from December to January and June to July. In the Yellow Sea stock these two phases have not been noted with conception occurring from July to September and birth peaking from May to June.

In the Southern Hemisphere conception takes place from June to December with a peak in August and September. Peak birth time occurs from July to August.

===Predation===
Killer whale predation on minke whales has been well documented. A study in 1975 found that in 49 killer whale stomachs, 84% had consumed minke whale. Minke whale carcasses investigated after attacks show that killer whales have an affinity for minke tongues and lower jaw. The anti-predatory mechanism of the minke whale is strictly a flight response, as when this fails no physical retaliation is observed. Studies have shown that they hear best in the frequency range of around 32 kHz, which overlaps with the same frequency that killer whales use when they hunt with echolocation, alerting the minke whales as soon as they hear them. Chases most commonly lead into open ocean, although there have been records of minke whales inadvertently swimming into confined, shallow waters. There have been two recorded instances of minke whales ending high speed chases by hiding under a ship&#x27;s hull; however, both instances were unsuccessful.

==Diet==

===North Atlantic===
Minke whales in the north Atlantic are observed to take a variety of food items. Before 1993, minke whales in the north Barents Sea fed predominantly on capelin until stocks collapsed and the whales switched to krill as their primary prey type. The minke whale population in the Norwegian Sea primarily feeds on adult herring while krill, capelin, and sand eels are also recorded prey types. In Scotland, sand eels are the most commonly observed prey species, followed by herring and sprat. Seasonal variations are observed off Finnmark, with krill the most popular prey type in the summer and cod in the autumn. Stable isotope analysis from 2003 shows minke whales in the north Atlantic also feed on prey from lower trophic levels.

===North Pacific===
Two stocks of minke whale are observed in the North Pacific: the &quot;J stock&quot; (Sea of Japan, Yellow Sea, East China sea) and the &quot;O stock&quot; (Okhotsk sea, west Pacific). Seasonal variations in diet exist. J-stock whales&#x27; primary prey type is Japanese anchovy during May and June, Pacific saury in July and August, and krill in September. O-stock whales primarily feed on krill in July and August. Most minke whales observed in 2002 (90.4%) fed solely on one prey species.

===Antarctic===
Antarctic minke whales are diurnal feeders. This minke whale population mainly feeds on Antarctic krill in offshore areas and ice krill in coastal areas on the continental shelf such as the Ross sea and Prydz bay. The population has been recorded to forage on ten known species: five fish (Antarctic silverfish, Antarctic jonasfish, Antarctic lanternfish, &quot;Chionodraco&quot;, and &quot;Notothenia&quot;), four euphausiids (Antarctic krill, ice krill, &quot;Euphausia frigida&quot;, &quot;Thysanoessa macrura&quot;), and one amphipod (&quot;Themisto gaudichaudii&quot;).

==Population and conservation status==
As of 2018, the IUCN Red List labels the common minke whale as Least Concern and the Antarctic minke whale as Near Threatened.

COSEWIC puts both species in the Not At Risk category. NatureServe lists them as G5 which means the species is secure on global range.

Population estimates are generated by the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission. The 2004 estimate yielded 515,000 individuals for the Antarctic minke stock.

==Whaling==


Whaling was mentioned in Norwegian written sources as early as the year 800, and hunting minke whales with harpoons was common in the 11th century. In the 19th century, they were considered too small to chase, and received their name from a young Norwegian whale-spotter in the crew of Svend Foyn, who harpooned one, mistaking it for a blue whale and was derided for it.

By the end of the 1930s, they were the target of coastal whaling by Brazil, Canada, China, Greenland, Japan, Korea, Norway, and South Africa. Minke whales were not then regularly hunted by the large-scale whaling operations in the Southern Ocean because of their relatively small size. However, by the early 1970s, following the overhunting of larger whales such as the sei, fin, and blue whales, minkes became a more attractive target of whalers. By 1979, the minke was the only whale caught by Southern Ocean fleets. Hunting continued apace until the general moratorium on whaling began in 1986.

Following the moratorium, most hunting of minke whales ceased. Japan continued catching whales under the special research permit clause in the IWC convention, though in significantly smaller numbers. The stated purpose of the research is to establish data to support a case for the resumption of sustainable commercial whaling. Environmental organizations and several governments contend that research whaling is simply a cover for commercial whaling. The 2006 catch by Japanese whalers included 505 Antarctic minke whales. Between November 2017 and March 2018, Japan reported catches of a total of 333 Minke whales, of which 122 were pregnant females.

Although Norway initially followed the moratorium, they had placed an objection to it with the IWC and resumed a commercial hunt of the Common minke whale in 1993. The quota for 2006 was set at 1,052 animals, but only 546 were taken. The quota for 2011 was set at 1286. In August 2003, Iceland announced it would start research catches to estimate whether the stocks around the island could sustain hunting. Three years later, in 2006, Iceland resumed commercial whaling.

A 2007 analysis of DNA fingerprinting of whale meat estimated South Korean fishermen caught 827 minke between 1999 and 2003, approximately twice the officially reported number. This raised concerns that some whales were being caught deliberately.

In July 2019, Japan resumed commercial whaling activities. The permitted catch for the initial season (July 1 – December 31, 2019) is 227 whales, of which 52 can be minke.

==Whale watching==

Due to their relative abundance, minke whales are often the focus of whale-watching cruises setting sail from, for instance, the Isle of Mull in Scotland, County Cork in Ireland, and Húsavík in Iceland, and tours taken on the east coast of Canada. They are also one of the most commonly sighted whales seen on whale-watches from New England and eastern Canada. In contrast to humpback whales, minkes do not raise their flukes out of the water when diving and are less likely to breach (jump clear of the sea surface).

In the northern Great Barrier Reef (Australia), a swim-with-whales tourism industry has developed based on the June and July migration of dwarf minke whales. A limited number of reef tourism operators (based in Port Douglas and Cairns) have been granted permits by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to conduct these swims, given strict adherence to a code of practice, and that operators report details of all sightings as part of a monitoring program.

Scientists from James Cook University and the Museum of Tropical Queensland have worked closely with participating operators and the Authority, researching tourism impacts and implementing management protocols to ensure these interactions are ecologically sustainable.

Minke whales are also occasionally sighted in Pacific waters, in and around the Haro Strait of British Columbia and Washington state.

<text>William Dampier (baptised 5 September 1651; died March 1715) was an English explorer, pirate, privateer, navigator, and naturalist who became the first Englishman to explore parts of what is today Australia, and the first person to circumnavigate the world three times. He has also been described as Australia&#x27;s first natural historian, as well as one of the most important British explorers of the period between Sir Francis Drake (16th century) and Captain James Cook (18th century); he &quot;bridged those two eras&quot; with a mix of piratical derring-do of the former and scientific inquiry of the latter. His expeditions were among the first to identify and name a number of plants, animals, foods, and cooking techniques for a European audience, being among the first English writers to use words such as avocado, barbecue, and chopsticks. In describing the preparation of avocados, he was the first European to describe the making of guacamole, named the breadfruit plant, and made frequent documentation of the taste of numerous foods foreign to the European palate at the time, such as flamingo and manatee.

After impressing the British Admiralty with his book &quot;A New Voyage Round the World&quot;, Dampier was given command of a Royal Navy ship and made important discoveries in western Australia, before being court-martialed for cruelty. On a later voyage he rescued Alexander Selkirk, a former crewmate who may have inspired Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. Others influenced by Dampier include George Anson, James Cook, Horatio Nelson, Charles Darwin, and Alfred Russel Wallace.

==Early life of William Dampier==
William Dampier was born at Hymerford House in East Coker, Somerset, in 1651. He was baptised on 5 September, but his precise date of birth is not recorded. He was educated at King&#x27;s School, Bruton. Dampier sailed on two merchant voyages to Newfoundland and Java before joining the Royal Navy in 1673. He took part in the two Battles of Schooneveld in June of that year.

Dampier&#x27;s service was cut short by a catastrophic illness, and he returned to England for several months of recuperation. For the next several years he tried his hand at various careers, including plantation management in Jamaica and logging in Mexico, before he eventually joined another sailing expedition. Returning to England, he married Judith around 1679, only to leave for the sea a few months later.

==First circumnavigation==

In 1679, Dampier joined the crew of the buccaneer (pirate) Captain Bartholomew Sharp on the Spanish Main of Central America, twice visiting the Bay of Campeche, or &quot;Campeachy&quot; as it was then known, on the north coast of Mexico. This led to his first circumnavigation, during which he accompanied a raid across the Isthmus of Darién in Panama and took part in the capture of Spanish ships on the Pacific coast of that isthmus. The pirates then raided Spanish settlements in Peru, with diminishing returns over time as the Spanish became aware of their presence. After a failed raid on the city of Arica, a group of the buccaneers, Dampier included, left the group in April 1681 and re-crossed the Isthmus of Darién. The remainder of the expedition continued on and rounded Cape Horn in November of the same year.
Dampier made his way to Virginia, where in 1683 he was engaged by the privateer John Cooke. Cooke entered the Pacific via Cape Horn and spent a year raiding Spanish possessions in Peru, the Galápagos Islands, and Mexico. This expedition collected buccaneers and ships as it went along, at one time having a fleet of ten vessels. Ambrose Cowley, one of the buccaneers who later wrote an account of his own circumnavigation, produced the first maps of the Galápagos during this period. Cooke died in Mexico, and a new leader, Edward Davis, was elected captain by the crew, taking the ship &quot;Batchelor&#x27;s Delight&quot;, with future Captain George Raynor in the crew.

Dampier transferred to the privateer Charles Swan&#x27;s ship, &quot;Cygnet&quot;, and on 31 March 1686 they set out across the Pacific to raid the East Indies, calling at Guam and Mindanao in the Philippines. Spanish witnesses saw the predominantly English crew as not only pirates and heretics but also cannibals. Leaving Swan and 36 others behind on Mindanao, the rest of the privateers under new Captain John Read sailed on to Manila, Poulo Condor in modern-day Vietnam, China, the Spice Islands, and New Holland (Australia). Contrary to Dampier&#x27;s later claim that he had not actively participated in actual piratical attacks during this voyage, he was in fact selected in 1687 to command one of the Spanish ships captured by &quot;Cygnet&quot;″s crew off Manila.

On 5 January 1688, &quot;Cygnet&quot; &quot;anchored two miles from shore in 29 fathoms&quot; on the northwest coast of Australia, near King Sound. Dampier and his ship remained there until 12 March, and while the ship was being careened Dampier made notes on the fauna and flora and the indigenous peoples he found there. Dampier wrote that Aboriginal Australians were the &quot;miserablest&quot; people he had ever seen who &quot;differ but little from brutes.&quot; Among his fellows were a significant number of Spanish sailors, most notably Alonso Ramírez, a native of San Juan, Puerto Rico; Ramírez would later be released after being imprisoned by another pirate, Duncan Mackintosh. Later that year, by agreement, Dampier and two shipmates were marooned on one of the Nicobar Islands. They obtained a small canoe which they modified after first capsizing and then, after surviving a great storm at sea, called at &quot;Acheen&quot; (Aceh) in Sumatra.

Dampier returned to England in 1691 via the Cape of Good Hope, penniless, with his only possessions being his journals and a tattooed slave known as Jeoly. Originally from Miangas, Jeoly and his mother were captured by slave traders and brought to Mindanao. They were bought for sixty dollars by one Mister Moody, who later passed on ownership to Dampier. When his mother died, Jeoly was inconsolable and wrapped himself in his dead mother&#x27;s clothes. Dampier claimed in his diaries that he became close with Jeoly, however, eager to recoup the money he lost while at sea, he sold Jeoly to the Blue Boar Inn on Fleet Street. Jeoly was exhibited as a &quot;prince&quot; to large crowds until he died of smallpox three months later. Numerous false stories about the tattooed foreigner were afterwards written, including his title as &quot;Prince Giolo&quot;.

==&quot;Roebuck&quot; expedition==


The publication of the book, &quot;A New Voyage Round the World&quot;, in 1697 was a popular sensation, creating interest at the Admiralty. In 1699, Dampier was given command of the 26-gun warship , with a commission from King William III (who had ruled jointly with Queen Mary II until her death in 1694). His mission was to explore the east coast of New Holland, the name given by the Dutch to what is now Australia, and Dampier&#x27;s intention was to travel there via Cape Horn.

The expedition set out on 14 January 1699, too late in the season to attempt the Horn, so it headed to New Holland via the Cape of Good Hope instead. Following the Dutch route to the Indies, Dampier passed between Dirk Hartog Island and the Western Australian mainland into what he called Shark Bay on 6 August 1699. He landed and began producing the first known detailed record of Australian flora and fauna. The botanical drawings that were made are believed to be by his clerk, James Brand. Dampier then followed the coast north-east, reaching the Dampier Archipelago and Lagrange Bay, just south of what is now called Roebuck Bay, all the while recording and collecting specimens, including many shells. From there he bore northward for Timor. Then he sailed east and on 3 December 1699 rounded New Guinea, which he passed to the north. He traced the south-eastern coasts of New Hanover, New Ireland, and New Britain, charting the Dampier Strait between these islands (now the Bismarck Archipelago) and New Guinea. En route, he paused to collect specimens such as giant clams.
By this time, &quot;Roebuck&quot; was in such bad condition that Dampier was forced to abandon his plan to examine the east coast of New Holland while less than a hundred miles from it. In danger of sinking, he attempted to make the return voyage to England, but the ship foundered at Ascension Island on 21 February 1701. While anchored offshore the ship began to take on more water and the carpenter could do nothing with the worm-eaten planking. As a result, the vessel had to be run aground. Dampier&#x27;s crew was marooned there for five weeks before being picked up on 3 April by an East Indiaman and returned home in August 1701.

Although many papers were lost with &quot;Roebuck&quot;, Dampier was able to save some new charts of coastlines, and his record of trade winds and currents in the seas around Australia and New Guinea. He also preserved a few of his specimens. Many plant specimens were donated to the Fielding-Druce Herbarium (part of the University of Oxford), and in September 1999, they were then loaned to Western Australia for the 300 year celebration.
In 2001, the &quot;Roebuck&quot; wreck was located in Clarence Bay, Ascension Island, by a team from the Western Australian Maritime Museum. Because of his widespread influence, and also because so little exists that can now be linked to him, it has been argued that the remains of his ship and the objects still at the site on Ascension Island – while the property of Britain and subject to the island government&#x27;s management – are actually the shared maritime heritage of those parts of the world first visited or described by him. His account of the expedition was published as &quot;A Voyage to New Holland&quot; in 1703.

==Court martial==
On his return from the &quot;Roebuck&quot; expedition, Dampier was court-martialled for cruelty. On the outward voyage, Dampier had his lieutenant, George Fisher, removed from the ship and jailed in Brazil. Fisher returned to England and complained about his treatment to the Admiralty. Dampier aggressively defended his conduct, but he was found guilty. His pay for the voyage was reduced, and he was dismissed from the Royal Navy.

According to records held at the UK&#x27;s National Archives, the Royal Navy court martial held on 8 June 1702 involved the following three charges:

#William Dampier, Captain, HMS &quot;Roebuck&quot;.
#:Crime: Death of John Norwood, boatswain.
#:Verdict: Acquitted.
#William Dampier, Captain, HMS &quot;Roebuck&quot;.
#:Crime: Hard and cruel usage of the lieutenant.
#:Verdict: Guilty.
#:Sentence: Forfeit all pay due and deemed unfit to command any of His Majesty&#x27;s ships.
#George Fisher, Lieutenant, HMS &quot;Roebuck&quot;
#:Crime: Dispute between the captain and the lieutenant.
#:Verdict: Acquitted.

==Second circumnavigation==
The War of the Spanish Succession had broken out in 1701, and English privateers were being readied to act against French and Spanish interests. Dampier was appointed commander of the 26-gun ship &quot;St George&quot;, with a crew of 120 men. They were joined by the 16-gun &quot;Cinque Ports&quot; with 63 men, and sailed on 11 September 1703 from Kinsale, Ireland. The two ships made a storm-tossed passage round Cape Horn, arriving at the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of Chile in February 1704. While watering and provisioning there, they sighted a heavily armed French merchantman, which they engaged in a seven-hour battle but were driven off.

Dampier succeeded in capturing a number of small Spanish ships along the coast of Peru, but released them after removing only a fraction of their cargoes because he believed they &quot;would be a hindrance to his greater designs.&quot; The greater design he had in mind was a raid on Santa María, a town on the Gulf of Panama rumoured to hold stockpiles of gold from nearby mines. When the force of seamen he led against the town met with unexpectedly strong resistance, however, he withdrew. In May 1704, &quot;Cinque Ports&quot; separated from the &quot;St George&quot; and, after putting Alexander Selkirk ashore alone on an island for complaining about the vessel&#x27;s seaworthiness, sank off the coast of what is today Colombia. Some of its crew survived being shipwrecked but were made prisoners of the Spanish.

It was now left to the &quot;St George&quot; to make an attempt on the Manila galleon, the main object of the expedition. The ship was sighted on 6 December 1704, probably &quot;Nuestra Señora del Rosario&quot;. It was caught unprepared and had not run out its guns. But while Dampier and his officers argued over the best way to mount an attack, the galleon got its guns loaded and the battle was joined. The &quot;St George&quot; soon found itself out-sized by the galleon&#x27;s 18- and 24-pounders, and, suffering serious damage, they were forced to break off the attack.

The failure to capture the Spanish galleon completed the break-up of the expedition. Dampier, with about thirty men, stayed in the &quot;St George&quot;, while the rest of the crew took a captured barque across the Pacific to Amboyna in the Dutch settlements. The undermanned and worm-damaged &quot;St George&quot; had to be abandoned on the coast of Peru. He and his remaining men embarked in a Spanish prize for the East Indies, where they were thrown into prison as pirates by their supposed allies the Dutch but later released. Now without a ship, Dampier made his way back to England at the end of 1707.

==Third circumnavigation and death==
In 1708, Dampier was engaged to serve on the privateer &quot;Duke&quot;, not as captain but as pilot. &quot;Duke&quot; beat its way into the South Pacific Ocean round Cape Horn in consort with a second ship, &quot;Duchess&quot;. Commanded by Woodes Rogers, this voyage was more successful: Selkirk was rescued on 2 February 1709, and the expedition amassed £147,975 (equivalent to £ today) worth of plundered goods. Most of that came from the capture of a Spanish galleon, &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño&quot;, along the coast of Mexico in December 1709.

In January 1710, Dampier crossed the Pacific in &quot;Duke&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Duchess&quot; and two prizes. They stopped at Guam before arriving in Batavia. Following a refit at Horn Island (near Batavia) and the sale of one of their prize ships, they sailed for the Cape of Good Hope where they remained for more than three months awaiting a convoy. They left the Cape in company with English ships, with Dampier now serving as sailing master of &quot;Encarnación&quot;. After a further delay at the Texel, they dropped anchor at the Thames in London on 14 October 1711.

Dampier may not have lived to receive all of his share of the expedition&#x27;s gains. He died in the Parish of St Stephen Coleman Street, London. The exact date and circumstances of his death, and his final resting place, are all unknown. He may have been buried in St Stephen’s Church, but the building was destroyed by bombing in 1940, and was not rebuilt. Dampier’s will was proven on 23 March 1715, and it is generally assumed he died earlier that month, but this is not known with any certainty. His estate was almost £2,000 in debt.

==Legacy==
Dampier influenced several figures better known than he:
* He made important contributions to navigation, collecting for the first time data on currents, winds and tides across all the world&#x27;s oceans that was used by James Cook and Joseph Banks.
* Jonathan Swift mentions Dampier in his &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; as a mariner comparable to Lemuel Gulliver, and the novel itself occasionally parodies Dampier&#x27;s travel books as well as other tales of exploration.
* His notes on the fauna and flora of north-western Australia were studied by naturalist and scientist Joseph Banks, who made further studies during the first voyage with James Cook. This helped lead to the naming of and colonisation of Botany Bay and the founding of modern Australia.
* His observations and analysis of natural history helped Alexander von Humboldt and Charles Darwin develop their scientific theories.
* His observations (and those of William Funnell) during his expeditions are mentioned several times by Alfred Russel Wallace in his book &quot;The Malay Archipelago&quot;, and compared to his own observations made on his 19th-century voyages.
* He is cited over 80 times in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, notably on words such as &quot;barbecue&quot;, &quot;avocado&quot;, &quot;chopsticks&quot;, and &quot;subspecies&quot;. That is not to say he coined the words, but his use of them in his writings is the first known example in English.
* Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who read Dampier&#x27;s &quot;A New Voyage Round the World&quot;, called him &quot;a rough sailor, but a man of exquisite mind.&quot; Dampier&#x27;s observations on marine life were among the many sources that Coleridge drew on for inspiration while writing his poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;.
* He recorded the first English language recipes for guacamole and mango chutney.
*His career in the Asia-Pacific is known for his kidnappings of indigenous peoples, where they were profited on and sold in Europe as slaves and human entertainment
*His life was dramatised in the 1954 Australian radio play &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Cousin&quot; by Ruth Park in which Dampier was originally played by Rod Taylor
*Gabriel García Márquez, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, mentions him in his novel &quot;The Autumn of the Patriarch.&quot;

<text>The common minke whale or northern minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is a species of minke whale within the suborder of baleen whales.

It is the smallest species of the rorquals and the second smallest species of baleen whale. Although first ignored by whalers due to its small size and low oil yield, it began to be exploited by various countries beginning in the early 20th century. As other species declined, larger numbers of common minke whales were caught, largely for their meat. It is now one of the primary targets of the whaling industry. There is a dwarf form in the Southern Hemisphere.

This species is known in the fossil record from the Pliocene epoch to the Quaternary period (age range: 3.6 million years ago to present day).
== Vernacular names ==

The origins of the species&#x27; common name are obscure. One of the first references to the name came in Henrik Johan Bull&#x27;s account of his 1893–95 voyage to the Antarctic, when he mentioned catching a small whale &quot;called in the Arctic language a Mencke whale, after a German who accompanied Mr. Foyn on some of his voyages.&quot; According to the British writer John Guille Millais (&quot;The mammals of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;, 1906, vol. 3, p. 279), &quot;Minkie was a Norwegian seaman who was always calling &#x27;Hval&#x27; at whatever backfin he saw. He is now regarded as the type of the &#x27;tenderfoot&#x27; at sea. Norwegians often refer to any small whale with some contempt or amusement as a &#x27;Minkie&#x27; or &#x27;Minkie&#x27;s hval&#x27;.&quot; The American marine biologist and painter Richard Ellis, citing the Norwegian scientist Age Jonsgård, stated &quot;that Meincke was a German laborer working for Svend Foyn, inventor of the grenade harpoon. Meincke &#x27;one day mistook a school of this whale species for blue whales... most probably he made this mistake during Foyn&#x27;s whaling operations in the Varanger Fjord between 1868 and 1885.&quot;

It has formerly been known as the little piked whale, the lesser or least rorqual, and the sharp-headed finner. American whalemen in the 19th century simply thought of them as &quot;young finbacks&quot; or a &quot;Finback&#x27;s calf&quot;, apparently under the impression that they were juveniles of their larger relative, the fin whale. They were also called zwergwal (German: &quot;dwarf whale&quot;) or vågehval (Norwegian: &quot;bay whale&quot;). In Japan they are called koiwashi-kujira (&quot;little sardine whale&quot;) or minku-kujira (&quot;minke whale&quot;). In Greenland they are known by the Danish name sildepisker (&quot;herring thresher&quot;). In Spanish it is known as Rorcual aliblanco (Whitewing Rorcual), Ballena minke común (Common Minke whale) or Ballena enana (Dwarf whale).

== Taxonomy ==

=== History ===

Otto Fabricius, in his &quot;Fauna Groenlandica&quot; (1780), was the first to describe the minke, noting its small size and white baleen – but he described it erroneously under the name &quot;Balaena rostrata&quot; (the taxonomic designation for the beaked whale). In 1804, Baron de Lacepede named it &quot;Balaenoptera acuto-rostrata&quot;, basing his description partly on the stranding of a juvenile female near Cherbourg, France in 1791.

In 1872, the American whaleman and naturalist Charles Melville Scammon described and named &quot;Balaenoptera davidsoni&quot;, after an pregnant female that was found dead on the north shore of Admiralty Inlet in October 1870 in then Washington Territory (now Washington state) and towed into Port Townsend Bay by Italian fisherman, who flensed it on the beach. Scammon mentioned its &quot;dwarfish size&quot;, &quot;pointed head&quot;, &quot;falcated dorsal fin&quot;, and the &quot;white band&quot; on its &quot;inordinately small, pointed pectorals&quot;. In 1877, the Italian geologist and paleontologist Giovanni Capellini described and named &quot;Sibbaldius mondini&quot; from a juvenile specimen that was captured off Italy in 1771. Both were later synonymized with &quot;B. acutorostrata&quot;.

A smaller, Southern Hemisphere form of minke whale with white-banded flippers was first described in separate studies by Peter Best (1985) and Peter Arnold, Helene Marsh, and George Heinsohn (1987), though a white-flippered form in the Southern Hemisphere had been noted earlier. The former described a &quot;diminutive form&quot; based on specimens caught off Durban, South Africa, while the latter named a &quot;dwarf form&quot; based on specimens and sightings from Australia. This unnamed subspecies has a prominent white flipper and shoulder blaze and a dark throat patch, whereas what was called the &quot;dark-shouldered&quot; or &quot;ordinary&quot; form of minke whale (now known as a separate species, the Antarctic minke whale, &quot;B. bonaerensis&quot;) lacked these contrasting markings.

Until recently, all minke whales were considered a single species. However, the common minke whale was recognized as a separate species from the Antarctic minke whale based on mitochondrial DNA testing. This testing also confirmed that the Antarctic minke whale is the closest relative of the common minke whale, thus confirming the validity of the minke whale clade.

=== Divergence ===

Common and Antarctic minke whales diverged from each other in the Southern Hemisphere 4.7 million years ago, during a prolonged period of global warming in the early Pliocene which disrupted the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and created local pockets of upwelling, facilitating speciation by fragmenting populations. The radiation of common minke whales into the Northern Hemisphere occurred rapidly about 1.5 million years ago during a period of cooling in the Pleistocene.

=== Hybrids ===

There have been two confirmed hybrids between common and Antarctic minke whales. Both were caught in the northeastern North Atlantic by Norwegian whaling vessels. The first, an female taken off western Spitsbergen () on 20 June 2007, was the result of a pairing between a female Antarctic minke and a male common minke. The second, a pregnant female taken off northwestern Spitsbergen () on 1 July 2010, on the other hand, had a common minke mother and an Antarctic minke father. Her female fetus, in turn, was fathered by a North Atlantic common minke, demonstrating that back-crossing is possible between hybrids of the two species.

== Description ==

=== Size ===

The common minke whale is the smallest of the rorquals, and one of the smallest baleen whales (second smallest only to the Pygmy right whale). In the North Atlantic, Norwegian whaling vessels in 1940 allegedly caught individuals of up to in length, but they were likely only measured visually in comparison to objects of known dimensions aboard the ships themselves – the longest caught in subsequent years were typically only up to in length. In the North Pacific, Soviet vessels operating out of the Kuril Islands claimed to have caught two males of 12.2 (40 ft) and and a female of – the first two were landed in 1951, the third in 1960. These likely represent undersized sei whales, part of the massive misreporting of whaling data by the Soviet Union in the North Pacific and elsewhere.

The longest measured by Icelandic scientists were an male and a female, while the longest caught by the Japanese in the western North Pacific were males and a female – the latter caught off eastern Hokkaido in 1977. For the dwarf form, the longest reported are a male caught in May 1973 and a 7.77 (25.5 ft) female caught in May 1970, both taken off South Africa.

Males caught in the western North Pacific and weighed whole on a truck scale averaged between 2.85 and 4.23 metric tons (3.14 and 4.66 short tons) (range: 0.86 to 6.36 metric tons, 0.95 to 7.01 short tons), while females averaged between 1.93 and 3.63 metric tons (2.13 and 4.00 short tons) (range: 0.84 to 8.35 metric tons, 0.93 to 9.20 short tons).

At sexual maturity, males and females in the North Atlantic average between and , while in the North Pacific they average between and . At physical maturity, males and females in the North Atlantic average between and , while in the North Pacific they are slightly smaller, averaging only , respectively. At birth, they are estimated to be in length and weigh . They are thought to be weaned at about in length. For the dwarf form, they are thought to reach sexual maturity at around for females and for males and are estimated to be about at birth.

=== Appearance ===

==== Northern form ====

Common minke whales are among the most robust members of their genus, the greatest height of their body being one-fifth their total length. They have a narrow, pointed, triangular rostrum with a low splashguard. Their prominent, upright, falcate dorsal fin averages about in height – range – and is set about two-thirds the way along the back. They are dark gray dorsally and clean white ventrally. The lower jaw projects beyond the upper jaw and is dark gray on both sides – though, like the dwarf form, it can have a &quot;white mandible blaze&quot; at the rear corner of the right lower jaw. An indistinct light gray &quot;rostral saddle&quot; may be present, and a few individuals can have pale, thin &quot;blowhole streaks&quot; trailing from the blowholes. A thin, light gray, forward-directed chevron, called the &quot;shoulder streak&quot;, lies between the pectoral fins. Two light gray to whitish swaths, called the &quot;thorax&quot; and &quot;flank patches&quot;, join ventrally in the mid-lateral region, with the former the brighter of the two. The pectoral fins are relatively small, averaging about 73 cm (about 2.4 ft) in length (maximum: 1.38 m, or about 4.5 ft). They have a transverse, white band on their outer margins, which is the most distinguishing feature of the species. In most individuals (about 94% in the western North Pacific) it is a clear white band, but in a minority of cases (about 6%) it only forms an obscure white band – about 29% of the individuals sampled from the Sea of Japan had this type of flipper band. The smooth-sided flukes average about in width and can be nearly 3 m (about 9.8 ft) wide. They are light gray or white ventrally and bordered by dark gray. The baleen plates, which number about 230 to 360 pairs and average about , are creamy white with a fine white fringe – a small percentage in the western North Pacific (mainly larger individuals) have a thin black band along the outer margin. They possess 50 to 70 thin ventral pleats, which only extend about 47 percent of the body length – among the shortest relative to body length among the rorquals, second only to the sei whale.

==== Dwarf form ====

The dwarf minke whale has similar proportions to the northern form, with an upright, hooked dorsal fin set about two-thirds the way along the back that is up to in height. It has 55 to 67 ventral grooves. Its baleen – in length – is mostly white, with up to 45 per cent of the posterior plates shading from black to dusky gray along their outer margins.

The dwarf form has the most complex coloration of any baleen whale. Dark gray fields and capes alternate with light gray and white blazes, patches, and streaks. The dark gray &quot;spinal field&quot; lies above an ivory white &quot;ventral field&quot;. This spinal field extends down into a &quot;nape field&quot;, which separates a light gray &quot;rostral saddle&quot; and a light gray, triangular, usually forwardly peaked &quot;thorax patch&quot;. The nape field, in turn, extends even further down into a &quot;dark throat patch&quot;, which reaches down to the ventral pleats and extends back to the front of the pectoral fins. Further back the spinal field extends into a &quot;dark thorax field&quot;, which usually forms an inverted triangle between the thorax patch and the light gray &quot;flank patch&quot;. This flank patch can be separated into an &quot;anterior&quot; and &quot;posterior flank patch&quot; by a dark triangular or even wave-like &quot;flank infill&quot;. Finally, the dark &quot;peduncle field&quot; covers the posterior portion of the caudal peduncle to the tips of the dorsal side of the flukes, which are white ventrally and thinly bordered by dark gray.

The most prominent features on the dwarf minke whale are the white &quot;flipper&quot; and &quot;shoulder blazes&quot;. The former covers the proximal two-thirds of the pectoral fin and continues along its leading edge, while the latter connects to the thorax patch above. A variably sized, dark oval &quot;auxiliary patch&quot; (formerly called a &quot;flipper oval&quot;) lies behind the pectoral fin, often appearing to merge with the dark gray &quot;distal flipper patch&quot;, which occupies the distal third of the pectoral fin. This auxiliary patch is often completely separated from the thorax patch by the white of the shoulder blaze and a vertical extension of the ventral field, but can also narrowly or even broadly attach to it. A &quot;mandible blaze&quot; usually covers the posterior third of the right lower jaw, while the left side is normally dark gray. Similarly, a white &quot;eye blaze&quot; is usually present on the right side, but rarely on the left. The rostral saddle likewise shows asymmetrical coloration, extending further on the right side than on the left and having a more well defined posterior right margin; the left, meanwhile, often has a diffuse posterior margin. A white &quot;peduncle blaze&quot; extends up from the ventral field, being bordered on each side by light gray double &quot;caudal chevrons&quot;, which extend down from the peduncle field and flank patch, respectively.

A variably shaped, thin, light gray line, called the &quot;nape streak&quot; (analogous to the &quot;shoulder streak&quot; or &quot;chevron&quot; of the northern form), extends laterally down the back between the pectoral fins. It can point forward, backwards or form a straight line; this variability can help to identify individual whales. A pair of light gray &quot;blowhole streaks&quot; extend posteriorly behind the blowholes, often curving to the left – the left more strongly than the right. Occasionally fine &quot;ear stripes&quot; may be present behind the opening of the auditory meatus, while dark or light speckling or streaking can occur along the flanks as well as what are called &quot;tiger stripes&quot; – &quot;parallel, dark, usually vertical stripes&quot;.

Like Bryde&#x27;s whale (and occasionally blue and fin whales), dwarf minkes can exhibit auxiliary ridges on either side of the central ridge of the rostrum.

== Distribution ==

=== Range ===

Common minke whales have a disjointed distribution. In the North Atlantic, they occur as far north as Baffin Bay, Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, and Novaya Zemlya and as far south as 40°N (New Jersey) and the Hebrides and central North Sea during summer. There are a few records from Hudson Bay (James Bay in 1986 and Button Bay in 1990), and they have also been observed occasionally in Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay. They have been recorded off Madeira and occur year-round off the Canary Islands. There are occasional sightings and strandings off Spain and Portugal, western Sahara, Mauritania, and Senegal. It is rare off the Azores and a vagrant in the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea, with a few records from the Black Sea (1880 and 1926). During the winter it has been recorded off Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Antilles, the east coast of the United States south of 40°N, and in the southeastern North Atlantic between 10°40&#x27;N and 19°35&#x27;N and 22°W and 20°05&#x27;W. In the western and central North Pacific, they range from Hawaii, the Mariana Islands, the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan in the south to the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering and Chukchi Seas in the north. In the eastern North Pacific, they occur in the Gulf of Alaska south along the entire west coast of North America (including the U.S. states of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California and the Canadian province of British Columbia) down to Baja California and into the Gulf of California. During winter, they&#x27;ve been acoustically recorded mainly between 15° and 35°N in the eastern and central North Pacific.

The dwarf form has been recorded off Brazil (June to February, including the states of Maranhão, Paraíba, Bahía, Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sol) from 2°44&#x27;S to 33°35&#x27;S, Uruguay, Argentina, in the Beagle Channel and Goree Passage of southern Chile (February to April), off South Africa (May to August), Australia (March to December, including Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland), New Zealand (March to August), New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Fiji, and as far south as the South Shetland Islands, Gerlache Strait, and the Bellingshausen Sea (69°25&#x27;S).

=== Population ===

==== North Atlantic ====

There are estimated to be over 180,000 common minke whales in the North Atlantic. Sighting surveys conducted in the Northeastern Atlantic between 1996 and 2001 resulted in an estimated abundance of 107,205 whales, with 43,835 in the Barents Sea region, 26,718 around Jan Mayen, 18,174 in the Greenland Sea and around the Svalbard archipelago, and 17,895 in the northern North Sea. There are an estimated 67,225 whales off Iceland. Based on an aerial survey performed in waters between northern Disko Island (70°45&#x27;N) and Cape Farewell (60°N) during August and September 2005, there are estimated to be 4,856 individuals (95% confidence interval (CV): 1,910-12,348) off Western Greenland; a ship-based survey made during September and October of the same year came up with a similar estimate of 4,479 (95% CI: 1,760-11,394). In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, line-transect aerial surveys done in August–September 1995 and July–August 1996 estimated there were 1,020 minke whales there, with about 75% of them on the North Shore shelf.

Estimates published in 2021 (based on 2014-2019 data) indicate that there are up to 150,000 individuals in Norwegian waters. Researchers at the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research say that these estimates are 50% higher than previous.

==== North Pacific ====

Ship-based sighting surveys that covered the Okhotsk Sea during August 1989 and August–September 1990 and adjacent areas of the Northwest Pacific during July and August 1990 estimated there were 25,049 (95% CI: 13,700-45,800) minke whales there, with 19,209 (95% CI: 10,100-36,600) in the Okhotsk Sea and 5,841 (95% CI: 2,800-12,000) in the Northwest Pacific. A sighting survey conducted in the central Bering Sea between July and August 1999 estimated there were 936 (95% CI: 473-1,852) individuals in those waters, while line-transect sighting surveys that cruised from the central Aleutian Islands east to the Kenai Peninsula from July–August 2001 – 2003 estimated there were 1,232 (95% CI: 646-2,346) whales in that area, with the majority of the sightings around the eastern Aleutian Islands, particularly in and around Seguam Pass and the Islands of Four Mountains; a few sightings were also made along the Alaska Peninsula and near Kodiak Island. In the coastal waters of British Columbia, there are estimated to be 475 (95% CI: 221-1,020) whales based on sightings from ship-based line-transect surveys made during the summers of 2004 and 2005.

==== Southern Hemisphere ====

There are no population estimates for dwarf minke whales due to sighting surveys not being able to distinguish it from the much more common Antarctic minke whale.

=== Occurrence ===

==== Site fidelity ====

Minke whales were individually identified using the shape of the dorsal fin and nicks along its edges, variations in lateral body pigmentation, and small oval scars in three separate study sites on the western coast of North America. These individuals showed strong small-scale site fidelity. A total of 55 whales were identified, 30 in the San Juan Islands of Washington state from 1980 to 1984, 17 in the Monterey Bay area of central California from 1984 to 1987, and eight in the Johnstone Strait area of British Columbia from 1981 to 1987 – although in the last region most were only photographed incidentally to the study of killer whales. The number of sightings per individual ranged from only one in one year to 37 over nine years, with 31 whales (56.4%) being sighted in at least two years and 12 (21.8%) being seen in at least five years. Most were seen exclusively or almost exclusively in one of three sub-regions in the San Juan Islands and one of two sub-regions in the Monterey Bay area.

In the San Juan Islands, 14 out of 18 whales were within their primary range on at least 94 per cent of sightings. Of the three sub-regions, Range A, northwest of Orcas Island, had the most stable constituency, with five individuals seen repeatedly over the study period, accounting for all but one of 88 sightings. Range B, east of San Juan Island, had the least stable constituency as well as the lowest number of sightings per year, while Range C, south and west of San Juan Island, had the greatest number of sightings and the greatest number of identified individuals every year. One whale, S4, was repeatedly and consistently found in Range B for three years, but was never seen there again after 1982; few sightings were made since then and all of these occurred in 1984, most of them involving three whales that were usually found in Range A (S8, S10, and S13). In Range C, five whales were seen there every year, while seven were only seen in a single year – most of the latter individuals were never encountered in any other part of the study site. There were also whales that showed no site fidelity at all, moving freely between the sub-regions. For example, whale S9, although only being sighted five times over four years, had sightings evenly divided between ranges B and C; whale S5, on the other hand, encountered 27 times over the course of eight years, was seen in more than one range in most years and moved around the three sub-regions more than any other whale.

In the Monterey Bay area, Range A was north of the deep-water canyon that runs into Carmel Bay, while Range B was south of that canyon. Individuals were sighted within one of the two ranges on at least 88 per cent of the sightings, with whales even being observed to turn around as they approached the border of their primary range and head back toward the middle of their range – this happened five times at the northern border and twice at the southern border of Range A, and six times at the northern border of Range B. Whales were sighted within of the coast, occasionally just outside the kelp, most of the time moving in a more or less straight line.

During a study conducted around the Isle of Mull, northwest Scotland, between 1990 and 1999 during the months of May to October, 66 minke whales were photo-identified based on the shape of the dorsal fin and distinctive notches and marks on it, body scars, and white oval scars – lateral body pigmentation was often not visible. Of these, 30 were seen at least twice, with 21 of them sighted in more than one year; one individual was identified 27 times over the course of ten years. During a similar study performed during whale watching cruises in the southern outer Moray Firth, northeast Scotland, between 2001 and 2007 from May to October, 34 individuals were photo-identified. Fourteen of them (41%) were sighted one or more times, while seven individuals (20%) were seen in one or more years. One whale was seen three times between 2002 and 2006; another four times between 2001 and 2006; and a third a total of eight times between 2001 and 2006.

In a photo-identification study of minke whales off Iceland conducted between 2001 and 2010, a total of 353 whales were individually identified: 292 in Faxaflói Bay, on the southwest coast, and 61 in Skjálfandi Bay, on the northeast coast. In Faxaflói Bay, 68 (23.3%) were resighted at least once, with 53 (18.2%) being resighted in two years, nine (3.1%) in three years, and six (2.1%) in four years. The majority in Skjálfandi was only sighted in one year, while ten (16.4%) were resighted at least once, four (6.6%) in two years, and six (9.8%) in three years or more. One whale, first photographed in Skjálfandi Bay in July 2002, moved repeatedly between the two study sites over a period of nearly ten years, sometimes being sighted in both areas in the same season.

In the St. Lawrence estuary, using dorsal fin shape and scars and lateral body pigmentation and scarring, a total of 209 minke whales were individually identified during the summer months between 1999 and 2004. Thirty-five were what were called &quot;regular visitors&quot;, being sighted on at least 40 different days in four to six different years. Twenty-five showed strong small-scale site fidelity to either the Laurentian Channel Head or the Saguenay Fjord, with over three-quarters of their sightings occurring in one of these two areas. Off Nova Scotia, forty individuals were reliably identified using dorsal fin notches during the summer months (mainly July and August) between 1997 and 2008. Of these, fourteen (35%) were sighted on more than one day, while only five (12.5%) were seen in more than one year.

==== Migration and movements ====

Three minke whales tagged off Iceland showed large-scale movements. One tagged off the north coast on 20 August 2002 first moved northeast of Iceland on 31 October before heading south, reaching on 8 November. Another, tagged in Faxaflói Bay on 14 September 2004, turned south along the Reykjanes Ridge about two weeks later; its last signal was received on 8 October at about . The third traveled the greatest distance. After being tagged in Faxaflói Bay on 27 August 2004 its first signal wasn&#x27;t received until 17 November, when it was over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, west of northern Spain. Its next position was transmitted six days later, some to the south, around the Azores, while its last signal was received on 5 December along the Canary Current, northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. In all, it traveled from its tagging location in a little over 100 days.

In the eastern North Pacific, individually identified minke whales were found to make intra-annual movements between feeding areas. Two whales traveled from southern (April) to northern Vancouver Island (July), while one whale moved from the southwest coast of Vancouver Island (June) to its northern coast (July–September) and another from the central British Columbia coast (July) south to northern Vancouver Island (August–September). Two whales, including one of the two that had traveled from southern to northern Vancouver Island, moved from northern (June and July, respectively) to southern Vancouver Island (September).

Four dwarf minke whales were attached with satellite tags off Lizard Island, on the Great Barrier Reef, in July 2013. All four followed the coastline south. Two stopped transmitting off southern Queensland, while the other two traveled west through the Bass Strait. The third soon stopped transmitting as well. The fourth ceased sending signals on 11 October, by which time it had reached 54°23&#x27;S, traveling some from its original tagging location.

== Biology ==

=== Reproduction ===
Common minke whales are sexually mature at about six to eight years of age for females and about six to seven years for males. Females are promiscuous. After a gestation period of 10 months, a single calf is born – only one out of 79 mature females during a study of minke whales off Iceland had twin fetuses, an female caught in July 2006 which had a male and a female. The calf is weaned after a period of six months. Peak conception is February in the North Atlantic, late February to mid-March for the &quot;O stock&quot;, which migrates along the eastern coast of Japan to the Okhotsk Sea), and between October and November for the &quot;J stock&quot; (which occurs in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and Sea of Japan, and migrates to the southern Okhotsk Sea in the spring, where it mixes with the O stock. Peak calving is December in the North Atlantic, December to January in the North Pacific, and May to July for the J stock. The calving interval is only a year, so females are often simultaneously pregnant and lactating. Females reach physical maturity perhaps as early as 13 years of age; another study suggested that growth ceases for both sexes when they have 15 to 20 growth layers in their tympanic bullae, which may correspond to about 15 to 20 years of age. Both sexes can live to about 50 years of age – the oldest in a study of Icelandic minke whales were 42 years for females and 47 years for males, respectively.

=== Prey ===

Common minke whales have been described as ichthyophagous, but their diet also includes pelagic crustaceans and cephalopods and varies by region, season, and year.

==== North Atlantic ====

In the North Atlantic, they primarily eat small schooling fish, demersal fish, and krill. A 2007 study showed that off Spitsbergen they fed almost exclusively on members of the euphausiid genus Thysanoessa (mainly &quot;T. inermis&quot;), but nearly a fifth also fed on small amounts of capelin. A small percentage of individuals, by decreasing frequency, also fed on polar cod, Atlantic cod, haddock, and copepods. Capelin dominated off Bear Island and in the southern Barents Sea, accounting for about three-quarters of their diet in both regions. Nearly half (nearly 46 per cent) also consumed euphausiids (&quot;Thysanoessa spp.&quot;) in the former area – haddock (12.5%), blue whiting (8.3%), polar cod, Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, and copepods constituted the rest. Herring and haddock were also taken in the southern Barents Sea (accounting for 41.5 and 28.7 per cent by frequency of occurrence, respectively), while sandeel (&quot;Ammodytes spp.&quot;), Atlantic cod, copepods, euphausiids, pollock, and blue whiting made up the rest of the diet. In the Norwegian Sea, herring was found in all individuals sampled (n= 10), with some (20 per cent each) also feeding on a small amount of capelin and blue whiting – an earlier study, based on data primarily obtained between 1943 and 1945, showed that they fed exclusively on herring off Vesterålen, while the diet off Lofoten was more varied, including herring (34 per cent by occurrence), pelagic crustaceans (23%), Atlantic cod (22%), haddock (6%), and a mixture of coalfish and flatfish for one individual (1.5%). In the North Sea, they primarily fed on sandeel (62%) and Atlantic mackerel (nearly 30%), with some feeding on herring (16.2%), small amounts of Mueller&#x27;s pearlside (10.8%), copepods, haddock, capelin, and whiting. They were found to feed almost exclusively on Atlantic mackerel in the northern North Sea, while the same was true for sandeel in the eastern North Sea. Off Iceland, they mainly fed on sandeel (nearly 58 per cent of sampled individuals), haddock (22.6%), herring (20%), capelin (19.4%), and Atlantic cod (14.7%), with the rest of the diet consisting of euphausiids, various larger species of gadoids, and Norway pout. Sandeel was more important in southern Iceland (constituting 78 per cent of sampled individuals), while capelin (35.1%), haddock (28.7%), and cod (22.3%) were more important in the north. Euphausiids were only consumed in the north. Although haddock was only a minor part of the diet the first couple years of the study (0 and 4% in 2003 and 2004, respectively), it subsequently constituted a major component of it (31-35% in 2005–2007), while sandeel&#x27;s importance in the south declined considerably (95.2 to 77.7% from 2003 to 2006, but only 18.1% in 2007). Off southeastern Greenland, they only fed on capelin, while sandeel dominated off southwestern Greenland. In a sample of 172 minke whales caught off Newfoundland between 1966 and 1972, the vast majority (85%) fed only on fish, mainly capelin. Some fed on a mixture of capelin and cod, while others had only consumed cod. Other gadoids, herring, krill, and squid formed the rest of the diet.

==== North Pacific ====

In the North Pacific, small schooling fish and krill are major food items. They feed exclusively on Pacific herring in the northern Okhotsk Sea and only on Alaska pollock east of Sakhalin Island. Japanese mackerel (found in 61 per cent of sampled stomachs) and Pacific saury (18%) are consumed east of the southern Kuril Islands, with only the former species being found in whales sampled in September and the latter species likewise only being found in whales taken in October. Euphausiids make up nearly two-thirds of the diet (62%) around the western Aleutian Islands, with unidentified fish (19%) constituting most of the rest. On the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido they mainly feed on euphausiids (55%), but also take sardine (24%) and sand lance (13%); on the Pacific side of Hokkaido, they feed almost exclusively on sardine (99%). In Sanriku, sardine makes up the bulk of the diet (54%), but euphausiids also play an important part (32%) – only a small percentage (9%) fed on sand lance. Euphausiids were a major food item on the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido and off Sanriku in the spring (71, 72 and 62% from April–June in the former area, and 83% in April in the latter area), while sardine dominated the diet in the summer in both areas (71% in September for the former region, and 70, 92, and 93% from May–July in the latter region). More recent data from Japanese scientific catches in the western North Pacific shows Japanese anchovy to be a major component of the diet in two of the three sub-areas (60 per cent by weight in sub-area 7 and 37.4% in sub-area 8), while Pacific saury was the major food item in sub-area 9 (64.6%) and played an important part of the diet in sub-area 8 (36.4%). Euphausiids (9.2% in all areas combined), Alaska pollock (7.8% in sub-area 7), minimal armhook squid (4.9% in sub-area 9), and mackerel were also consumed. They are thought to feed on juvenile herring and probably sand lance (&quot;Ammodytes hexapterus&quot;) around the San Juan Islands, while in the Monterey Bay region they have been observed feeding on baitfish – probably northern anchovy, which is abundant there.

==== Southern Hemisphere ====

In the Southern Ocean, dwarf minkes feed mainly on myctophid fishes. An immature female caught in the sub-Antarctic had euphausiids in its stomach, while two pregnant females from the same area had consumed fish and a mature male only had myctophids in its stomach. An immature male caught in a gillnet off southern Brazil had a stomach almost filled with the euphausiid &quot;Euphausia similis&quot;.

There have been numerous recorded instances of killer whales preying on or attacking common minke whales in places such as the Kamchatka Peninsula, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State, California, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Greenland, and Svalbard. They are normally able to outpace pursuing killer whales in open water or are trapped in a bay, where they are rammed and drowned or strand and die – in one instance a minke whale was able to refloat itself on the rising tide and swim away. Chases usually last about 30 minutes to an hour and can reach speeds of up , often with both species porpoising out of the water in low-angle leaps. Typically two to four killer whales and a lone minke are involved. If the pursuing killer whales do catch up to the minke it does not defend itself, which is typical of the fast-moving members of its genus. On two occasions fleeing minkes sought shelter under a boat, once off Yakutat, Alaska, in 1977 and again in Glacier Bay, Alaska, in 1996 – in both instances they were attacked and killed. Killer whales typically only eat the tongue, skin, and some of the blubber of the minkes they kill.

=== Scavenging ===

Greenland sharks have been found scavenging the blubber thrown overboard during Norwegian minke whaling operations off Svalbard. Great white sharks and blue sharks have also been observed feeding on a minke whale carcass off California.

=== Whale falls ===

A new species of siboglinid annelid worm, &quot;Osedax mucofloris&quot;, was discovered on the carcass of a 5.3 m (17.4 ft) female minke whale experimentally placed at a depth of 125 m (410 ft) in the North Sea. This genus of worm uses endosymbiotic bacteria to feed on the bones of whales that fall to the seafloor.

=== Parasites and epibiotics ===

Common minke whales are a host to a number of internal and external parasites, as well as commensals, and other epibiotic fauna. Off Iceland, 45.2 per cent (85 of 188) of sampled minke whales bore old scars from attacks by the sea lamprey &quot;Petromyzon marinus&quot;, while a further 10.6 per cent had fresh scars on the posterior part of their flanks; five were found with live lampreys still clinging to their flesh. The copepod &quot;Caligus elongatus&quot; was found on 11.9 per cent of individuals, with a mean intensity (M. I.) of 95.5 per whale – the monogenean hyperparasite &quot;Udonella caligorum&quot; was also found attached to 22 (6.6%) of a sub-sample of 332 &quot;C. elongatu&quot;s. Another copepod, &quot;Pennella balaenopterae&quot;, was found anchored into the flesh of 10.3 per cent of the whales (M. I. 1.6, with a maximum of five). The whale louse &quot;Cyamus balaenopterae&quot; was found on the skin of 6.5 per cent of the whales (M.I. 37), while the pseudo-stalked barnacle &quot;Xenobalanus globicipitis&quot; was found on the flukes of three whales (M.I. 5.3). A single individual of the goose barnacle &quot;Conchoderma auritum&quot; was found attached to a baleen plate that belonged to a male caught off the northwest coast in 2005, while four &quot;C. virgatum&quot; were found attached to a specimen of &quot;P. balaenopterae&quot; on a female caught off the north coast in 2003.

In the St. Lawrence Estuary of eastern Canada, sea lampreys (&quot;P. marinus&quot;) were seen on 47 individually identified minke whales on over 100 occasions between 1999 and 2004. They were seen on the whales from June to October, with peak sightings in July and August. Between one and four lampreys were found per whale; the majority were attached below or behind the dorsal fin. On eighteen occasions, the same whale was seen multiple times with one or more lampreys attached to the same spot on its body from two to 87 days with an average of fifteen days. Twice whales were seen right after a lamprey had detached from them, revealing a bloody lesion that showed that the lampreys were feeding on their blood. On several occasions scrapes were seen on the whales from lampreys moving about their bodies probably &quot;actively seeking areas of greater access to blood or decreased water flow&quot;.

Among a sample of 100 minke whales caught in the western North Pacific in 1995, 78% had the copepod &quot;P. balaenopterae&quot; anchored into their skin and blubber – the goose barnacle &quot;C. virgatum&quot; was found attached to &quot;P. balaenopterae&quot; on three of the whales. The whale louse &quot;C. balaenopterae&quot; was found on the skin of four whales, while a single whale had the pseudo-stalked barnacle &quot;X. globicipitis&quot; attached to its skin. All individuals sampled were infected with the nematode &quot;Anisakis simplex&quot; in their stomachs (sometimes their small intestine) and the acanthocephalan &quot;Bolbosoma nipponicum&quot; in their small intestine. Other internal parasites included the cestodes &quot;Diphyllobothrium macroovatum&quot;, &quot;Diplogonoporus balaenopterae&quot;, and &quot;Tetrabothius sp.&quot;, which infected the small intestine and were found in 17 per cent of the sample (all three species combined).

In the eastern North Pacific, forty-three of forty-four individually identified minke whales possessed what were believed to be scars from cookiecutter sharks, while three had individuals of the commensal barnacle &quot;Xenobalanus globicipitis&quot; attached to their dorsal fins. Both are primarily warm water species and may be evidence of migration for minke whales from British Columbia to tropical waters.

An immature male dwarf minke whale that stranded on the Banks Peninsula, South Island, New Zealand, had a stomach heavily infested with the nematode &quot;Anisakis&quot; and cysts of the cestode genus &quot;Phyllobothrium&quot; encased in the boundary between its blubber and muscle, while an immature male caught in a gillnet off southern Brazil had a stomach heavily infested with nematodes of the genera &quot;Pseudoterranova&quot; (about 97%) and &quot;Anisakis&quot; (about 3%).

== Behavior ==

=== Group size ===
Common minke whales are normally seen singly. In the San Juan Islands, although up to six whales could be seen in a feeding area at once they usually acted independently, with no indications of cooperative feeding like that observed in their larger relatives the humpback and fin whale. On occasion, two whales could be seen surfacing at the same time, within one or two body lengths of each other – such associations could last for only one surfacing to as long as about 90 minutes. Only once were three individuals seen together for a couple surfacings. In the Monterey Bay area, usually only one whale was visible at a time; on only four occasions were two whales seen swimming together. On several occasions in the Johnstone Strait area pairs and trios were briefly seen surfacing together. Around the Isle of Mull, about 68 per cent of the sightings involved single whales, 26.5 per cent involved two or three whales, while only 5.4 per cent involved groups of four to ten. Off Western Greenland and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and southern Gulf of Maine, almost all sightings involved single whales. Off Iceland, the majority of sightings (93%) were of lone whales, with only a minority of the encounters including pairs (4%) or trios (less than 3%). Cow-calf pairs were absent from most of these regions – a single cow-calf pair was seen off the Isle of Mull in 1992, while only three were seen in the southern Gulf of Maine (in May, August, and October). Of 89 sightings in the Okhotsk Sea and Northwest Pacific, 80 were of solitary whales, seven of pairs, and one each involved groups of four and five whales.

Northern minke whales occasionally breach, sometimes completely clearing the water – one individual in the Johnstone Strait area reacted to the approach of foraging killer whales by breaching eight times in rapid succession.

All of the dwarf minke whales caught off South Africa were taken singly. The majority of sightings of dwarf minke whales on the Great Barrier Reef involved either single whales (53.3%) or pairs (28.9%), with the maximum number of individuals in a group being eight. Four cow-calf pairs were seen as well. Individuals encountered on the various reef systems there often approached dive boats and circled them as well as the divers in the water. They were also seen breaching. Off Brazil, groups normally only consisted of one or two individuals, which actively avoided whale watching boats and fishing vessels. Here they were seen to associate with feeding flocks of seabirds, usually brown boobies but also kelp gulls and terns on occasion.

=== Segregation ===

Common minke whales exhibit a great degree of spatial and temporal segregation by sex, age, and reproductive condition. Off Greenland, females dominate on the west coast (comprising 68% of individuals), while males predominate off the east coast (57%). On the west coast, the proportion of females in offshore waters increases with latitude, being lowest in the south (less than 40% from 60 to 63°N) and highest north of 70°N (over 90%). Females dominate during the spring and early summer (comprising nearly 79% of individuals from May to July), while the percentage of males increases from 38 to 45 per cent in the late summer (August to September). In coastal waters, the highest incidence of females occurs in the spring (about 85%), declines in the summer (72%), and rises again in the fall (over 75%). Over 70 per cent of the females in offshore waters are mature, nearly all of them pregnant (94.4%).

Off Iceland, males dominate in most areas (particularly off the southwest coast, where they comprise 70% of individuals), while females form the slight majority (53%) on the east coast. Females dominate in the spring in most areas (61%), while males predominate in the summer (58%) and fall (66%). In the northeastern North Atlantic, females dominate around the Svalbard archipelago and in the Barents Sea (62.2 to 73.9%), while males predominate around the British Isles and off Norway (54.3 to 68.1%). Larger individuals of both sexes primarily occur further north (off Svalbard and in the Barents Sea), while smaller individuals mainly occur to the south (e.g. along the Norwegian coast from Lofoten south, in an area once known as a summering ground for newly weaned calves). In the Barents Sea, over 40 per cent of females are mature, with the vast majority being pregnant (94.4%).

In the western North Pacific, larger animals are typically found in higher latitudes (e.g. in the Okhotsk Sea, south of the Kuril Islands, and around the Commander and western Aleutian Islands), while smaller animals, especially females, dominate in lower latitudes (e.g. off Sanriku). The percentage of mature females is high in offshore areas (72.5 to 86.7%), with most of them being pregnant (85.7 to 100%). In coastal areas, however, most females are immature (60.4 to 94.2%) and fewer of the mature females are pregnant (40 to 58.4%). Females dominate in the northern Yellow Sea (90.9%) and off the east coast of North Korea (69.2%), while males predominate off the west coast of Honshu (72.6%) and off the southwest and west coasts of Hokkaido (90.5 and 59.7%). In the southern Okhotsk Sea, females arrive earlier than males (April and May, respectively), while mature females arrive earlier than immature ones.

=== Surfacing sequence ===

When a minke whale first comes to the surface to breathe its pointed rostrum is the first to break the surface. It either exhales beforehand or a narrow, diffuse blow or a low, bushy, diffuse blow is visible. It then arches its back in a quick motion, exaggerating this arch during its terminal deep dive. Often the blowholes and dorsal fin are visible at the same time. Depending on its behavior, it may exhale anywhere from one to seven times in rapid succession before going on a longer dive of several minutes duration. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, this depended on whether a whale was traveling, searching, or feeding. During traveling, when the whale was slower moving (generally in a straight line), it would exhale the greatest number of times (6.44 on average) and dive for a longer period of time (3.67 minutes on average) than when it was feeding, which was characterized by constant change in direction and vigorous swimming – this normally involved one or two respirations interspersed with three to seven (2.27 on average) followed by a relatively short dive (1.36 minutes on average). When a whale was searching, on the other hand (which involved the whale moving at a faster speed than traveling in a sort of zigzag motion), it would exhale 3.22 times on average and dive the longest of the three modes (3.76 minutes on average).

In the Monterey Bay area, focal follows of minke whales showed that they respired an average of 3.74 times during a surfacing sequence. These short duration dives averaged 37.8 seconds and were followed by a long duration dive of an average of 4.43 minutes. In the San Juan Islands, the number of exhalations and the duration of dives depended on whether the whale was lunge feeding or feeding with birds. In the former method of feeding, whales made short dives – about 22 seconds long – up to seven times in rapid succession before making a long dive of about 3.8 minutes, while during the latter method they made longer short dives of about 65 seconds followed by shorter long dives of about 1.5 minutes.

=== Feeding techniques ===

In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, minke whales exhibit three types of behaviors: entrapment maneuvers, engulfment maneuvers, and entrapment/engulfment maneuvers. Entrapment maneuvers include circles, gyres, ellipses, figure-of-eights, and hyperbolas. &quot;Circles&quot; involve a whale, lying on its side with its ventral surface facing its intended prey, swimming in a circle 1.5 to 2.5 times its diameter and lunging mouth agape across the diameter of this circle. As the whale mounts the water column the movement of its flukes create a print or trace. &quot;Gyres&quot; are larger versions of circles that steadily decrease in diameter as the whale performs each circuit. &quot;Ellipses&quot; cover a greater area than the former two maneuvers as the whale swims a long and short axis – the former can be greater than at times. Ellipses can be maintained for long periods of time and may include feeding circles within them as well as a number of engulfing maneuvers. Unlike circles, surface traces are rarely apparent. &quot;Figure-of-eights&quot; are smaller versions of ellipses, with a long axis of less than six body lengths. The whale turns in opposite directions at each end of the long axis. &quot;Hyperbolas&quot; involve the whale turning at least once at the end of a short straight line run – this maneuver is sometimes performed alongside a rock face, followed by an inward facing feeding lunge.

Engulfment maneuvers include plunges, oblique, lateral, vertical and ventral lunges. During &quot;plunges&quot; the whale approaches the water at an angle of less than 30° with its ventral surface facing downwards. Usually only the rostrum and part of the lower lip are visible above the surface of the water as it breaks the surface and often the tops of the extended ventral pleats. &quot;Oblique lunges&quot; are executed at a greater angle (about 45°) and entirely expose the extended ventral pleats; at times the entire body exits the water in a low, porpoising-like breach. During a &quot;lateral lunge&quot; the whale breaks the surface on its side, while during &quot;vertical&quot; and &quot;ventral lunges&quot; the whale exits the water at a 90° angle and while on its back, respectively.

Entrapment/engulfment maneuvers include horizontal, lateral and ventral arcs. During a &quot;horizontal arc&quot; a whale turns sharply – on either side – with only a pectoral fin or occasionally a tip of the flukes breaking the surface of the water. &quot;Lateral&quot; and &quot;ventral arcs&quot; are similar to lateral and ventral lunges, but without any part of the whale breaking the surface of the water. All three of these maneuvers have been observed with both expanded and unexpanded ventral pleats.

Plunges were used the most often (22% of the time), followed by ventral (19%), lateral (17%), and oblique lunges (15%). Vertical lunges were infrequently utilized (only 5% of the time), as were horizontal (7%), ventral (6%), and lateral arcs (3%).

Novel feeding techniques were observed during a study of five individually identified minke whales (named M1 to M5) in the Saguenay Fjord National Park, on the north side of the St. Lawrence estuary, from June to October 2003. These maneuvers included head slaps, chip-up blows, and exhales on the dive. During a &quot;head slap&quot;, the whale would raise its head high out of the water at angle of about 30 to 45°, take a quick breath, and then slam its head onto the water, creating a loud splash. It would do this without expanding its ventral pleats or forcing water out of its mouth. After doing several head slaps the whale would perform a feeding lunge. Head slaps were used almost exclusively by M4 and M5. A &quot;chin-up blow&quot; is similar to a normal surfacing but more energetic and executed at a greater angle as the whale comes high out of the water to breathe and dive again in one continuous motion without slapping the surface of the water. Chin-up blows were utilized often and performed by all five whales; it was the principal technique used by M1, M2, and M3 prior to a feeding lunge. An &quot;exhale on the dive&quot; is exactly what its name implies: a whale exhaling as its blowholes submerge. This resulted in a large volume of water being displaced and typically followed a normal blow or a chin-up blow and on occasion a head slap. This technique was only executed by M1 and M5. These new techniques are thought to have been developed by these whales to help them herd small schooling fish (likely capelin) in the well-mixed waters of the Saguenay Fjord; these tactics were not observed in the nearby Laurentian Channel Head, where &quot;strong tidal currents, a stratified water column and bottom topography combine to create large areas of upwelling in which prey are forced to the surface&quot;.

In July 2007, a minke whale with what appeared to be a rope injury was observed surface feeding on capelin in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The long, linear laceration extended around the ventral pleats, restricting their distention. This individual performed a number of oblique lunges on its right side and then rotated in mid-air to the left, landing upright on its rostrum. This was not observed in any of the other feeding whales. This may have been done to avoid landing on the injured portion of its ventral pleats.

=== Vocalizations ===

==== North Atlantic ====
In the North Atlantic, minke whales produce downsweeps and &quot;pulse&quot; or &quot;thump trains&quot;. Downsweeps, which last 0.4 seconds in duration and sweep down from 100 to 200 Hz (median: 118 Hz) to below 90 Hz (median: 80 Hz) have been recorded in the St. Lawrence estuary of eastern Canada. Pulse trains have been recorded off Puerto Rico and in Massachusetts Bay. Two types, &quot;speed-up&quot; and &quot;slow-down&quot;, were recorded off Puerto Rico, while the same two calls as well as a &quot;constant&quot; call, were recorded in Massachusetts Bay. They differ in pulse rate, peak frequency, and duration. In the latter area, slow-down was the most commonly recorded type. Their peak frequencies ranged from 58 to 136 Hz and each pulse lasted from 0.07 to 0.12 seconds, together producing pulse trains of 12.4 to 39.8 seconds in duration. Detections of pulse trains peaked during August and September, with most calls being heard from mid-July to mid-November. None were recorded in January and February and few were detected from March to June. The pulse trains off Puerto Rico were recorded in March.

==== North Pacific ====

In the North Pacific, what were called &quot;boings&quot; was first described in the mid-1960s from submarine recordings made off San Diego, California, and Kaneohe, Hawaii, in the 1950s. They consist of a brief pulse – called a &quot;precursor&quot; – with a duration of 0.28 seconds (range: 0.15 to 1.6 seconds) followed by a frequency and amplitude modulated long call – called the &quot;AM component&quot; – of 2.2 seconds duration (range: 1.4 to 4.2 seconds). Both had peak frequencies of 1.4 kHz with harmonics of up to 9 kHz. These strange calls were recorded from October to May – peaking in March – and had a source level of about 150 decibels with reference to one micropascal metre. Their source remained a mystery for decades. By the early 1980s they were thought to come from whales, but it wasn&#x27;t known what species. In the early 2000s, it was suggested these sounds might originate from minke whales, based on their similarities to vocalizations produced by Southern Hemisphere forms. Finally, during a 2002 HICEAS () survey, the R/V &quot;David Starr Jordan&quot;, using a towed hydrophone array, detected boings off the northwestern Hawaiian Islands on 7 November 2002 and discovered they came from a minke whale, which they photographed and biopsied.

Boings have been divided into two types: the &quot;central boing&quot; and the &quot;eastern boing&quot;. The former has only been recorded west of 135°W, while the latter has only been recorded east of 138°W. They differ in pulse repetition rate and total duration. There may also be a &quot;western boing&quot; off Japan. Most boings have been recorded in the tropical and warm temperate North Pacific during the winter and spring, but some have also been detected in the northeastern Chukchi Sea in the summer and fall.

==== Southern Hemisphere ====

The &quot;star wars&quot; vocalization, a complex, stereotyped call consisting of three components ranging from 50 Hz to 9.4 kHz, is produced by the dwarf minke whale. It has a source level of 150 to 165 decibels at a reference pressure of one micropascal at one metre. This bizarre call, described as &quot;almost synthetic, metallic, or mechanical&quot;, has been recorded during June and July on the northern Great Barrier Reef (about 14°30&#x27;S to 17°S), off Stradbroke Island, Queensland (27°30&#x27;S), and off Coffs Harbour, New South Wales (30°S). They also produce downswept calls of 250 to 50 Hz.

== Whaling ==
=== North Atlantic ===

The first written records attest to the active hunting of minke whales off Norway by 1100 A.D. By 1240 they began utilizing iron darts fired from crossbows that had been treated with the tissue of dead sheep infected with the bacterium &quot;Clostridium&quot;. Introducing this infectious agent to a wound weakened the whale and after a couple days the men would return and lance it to death. This method of whaling continued to be used until the 1880s.

Norwegian catching of minke whales from small fishing vessels started off Møre, western Norway, in the 1920s. It had spread north to Salten by 1932 and all along the Norwegian coast and to Bear Island, Spitsbergen, and the Barents Sea by the late 1930s – the latter area, particularly the southeastern region east to Novaya Zemlya, was one of the most important whaling grounds, with over 2,400 whales being caught there in 1949. Licenses were introduced in 1938. A westward expansion to the waters north and east of Iceland occurred; by 1966 they had reached the Denmark Strait and western Greenland just two years later. At its peak over 300 vessels participated in the hunt each season, but this declined to about 50 in the 1980s. By the end of the Second World War the catch was at nearly 2,000 per annum, peaked at 4,338 in 1958, and declined to 2,307 by 1970. Over 125,000 have been caught by Norwegian commercial whaling since 1938. In accordance with the moratorium against commercial whaling voted on by the International Whaling Commission in 1982 and taking effect in 1986, commercial catches ceased in 1987 (albeit only temporarily). From 1988 to 1990 and again from 1992 to 1994 Norway caught minke whales under scientific permit and resumed commercial whaling of the species in 1993. They typically catch 450 to 600 individuals a year, with 464 being taken in 2012.

Minke whales were first caught off Iceland in 1914 by the powered 4-ton fishing vessel &quot;Margrét IS 314&quot;, which was mounted with a 1.5 inch bore harpoon gun – this was replaced in 1923 with a 2-inch bore harpoon gun manufactured in Norway. Later other vessels joined the trade. Operations were limited to coastal waters, normally within 30 nautical miles of shore. The season extended from the beginning of March to late November, even to early December at times; though most were caught between April and October. They were mainly caught for their meat, with a minimum of 3,362 being taken between 1914 and 1980. Catch limits were introduced in 1977. The average annual catch rose from 105 from 1966 to 1970, to 137 from 1971 to 1975, and finally to 200 from 1976 to 1980. The last were caught in 1985 before whaling resumed in 2003 under scientific permit, with 200 being taken from 2003 to 2007. Commercial whaling for minkes was renewed in 2006, with a total catch of 296 between 2006 and 2012.

A Newfoundland whaling company began catching &quot;little piked whales&quot; (minke whales) off northeastern Newfoundland in 1947, taking 16 in its first year and 41 in 1948. A total of 812 minke whales were caught off Newfoundland between 1947 and 1972, with a peak of 97 in 1972. They were captured by one to three wood-hulled vessels that had a 50 mm harpoon cannon mounted on their bows. Whales were towed to a shore station for flensing. They were first caught in Conception, Bonavista, and Trinity bays, but later catches (1966 to 1972) were mainly made in Trinity Bay itself. The season extended from May to September (rarely October), with peak catches being made in June and July. A small number – 51 between 1962 and 1967 – were also caught off Nova Scotia, with the season lasting from June to August.

Minke whales were first exploited by Greenlanders off western Greenland in 1948, when a fishing vessel mounted with a harpoon cannon began catching them. This vessel averaged 18 whales per annum (range four to 32), before being joined by three other vessels in 1958. The number of vessels participating in the hunt each year increased rapidly, rising from 18 in 1963, to 25 in 1964, and to 45 in 1965. The peak was reached in 1968 and 1969, with 56 vessels active in both years. From 1970 to 1976 the average fluctuated between about 30 and 45 vessels. A total of 3,434 minke whales were taken off western Greenland between 1948 and 1976, with a peak of 315 reached in 1968. The vast majority of these whales were taken by fishing vessels normally targeting cod, shrimp, or salmon, but an increasing number in later years were caught using a number of small boats with out-board motors, armed with high-powered rifles for killing the whale and hand-held harpoons and floating bladders to secure them; walkie-talkies were used for coordination. Usage of this method, called a &quot;collective catch&quot;, increased from a catch of just one whale in 1970 to 59 in 1975.

In southwest Greenland (south of 66°15&#x27;N), the season lasts from April to November, with peaks in May and October. Occasionally a few whales are caught in the winter. On the central west coast (Disko Bay and adjacent areas from 66°15&#x27;N to 70°45&#x27;N), the season begins in late May and peaks in July, August or September. In some years, mild ice-less winters also allow catching in this region from November to April. In the northwest (mainly the Umanak district, 70°45&#x27;N to 73-74°N), the season doesn&#x27;t begin until June because of sea ice, with peak catches occurring from July to September. A few are also caught in October and November. Minke whales were caught for their meat, with it mainly being used locally for human consumption and dog food, though in Umanak the Royal Greenland Trading Department purchased some of the products of the hunt beginning in the late 1960s. An additional 4,307 minke whales were caught off Greenland between 1985 and 2012, 4,070 off western Greenland and a paltry 237 off eastern Greenland. The average annual catch during this period has usually been between 150 and 190 whales.

A total of 97 were caught off the Faroe Islands between 1960 and 1971, with a peak of 32 in 1968. One was also taken off Portugal in 1951.

=== North Pacific ===

There is no evidence minke whales were caught in Japan during the harpoon and net whaling eras. The small-type catcher boat &quot;Yuko-maru 7&quot; GRT caught the first minkes out of Akukawa in 1930. In the first half of the 1930s, about 20-30 was taken per year out of this port. Minke whaling soon spread to the port of Kamaishi (1938), on the northeast coast of Honshu; Ogawajima (about 1951), on the west coast of Kyushu; and to Wakasa Bay and Aomori (both by 1957), the former on the west coast and the latter on the north coast of Honshu. An average of 23 catcher boats – each of which averaged about 23 tons between 1952 and 1986 – were involved each year between 1950 and 1986, from a peak of 80 in 1950 to a low of seven from 1973 to 1978 – these boats also caught other species, mainly giant beaked whales, short-finned pilot whales, and killer whales. As the number of boats declined the average tonnage increased dramatically, from 14.6 in 1952 to 39 in 1982. In 1979, nine catchers averaged about 360 horsepower – they ranged from 15.2 tons and 150 horsepower for the tiny &quot;Katsu Maru&quot; (1978–1986) to the 36.99-ton &quot;Koei Maru No. 7&quot; at 450 horsepower. The largest was the 47.77-ton &quot;Sumitomo Maru No. 31&quot;, which operated from 1982 to 1986. These vessels used harpoon guns of 50 mm caliber or less. Because of their small size, limited cruising range, and inability to work during inclement weather, catchers were restricted to within 50 nautical miles of their home port in the 1950s, while the vast majority operated within 80 nautical miles of their home ports or designated unloading ports (for Hokkaido) during the period 1977 to 1987. In 1968 small motorboats were introduced, which scared the whales into swimming quickly at the surface, making them easier to track and exhausting them in the process – this allowed them to be more easily killed as well. The earliest were long and 2 tons with 65-80 horsepower outboard engines; later boats with 165 horsepower were utilized. The number of catchers using motorboats increased rapidly from 1968 to 1972; by 1979 they all used them.

Several hundred minkes were caught each year, with the peak being reached in 1956, when 532 were taken. A total of 13,334 were taken by Japanese coastal whaling between 1948 and 1987. Most were caught off Sanriku and on the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido, with the Pacific side of Hokkaido gaining some importance by the early 1970s. They were seldom caught off the west coast of Honshu (off Tottori, in Tsuruga Bay, and Toyama Bay), which was abandoned by the mid-1970s. Few were taken on the Sea of Japan side of Hokkaido as well. They were formerly captured off western Kyushu and the south coasts of Honshu and Shikoku, but catching in those regions ceased by 1965 due to the scarcity of whales. The first minkes of the season were caught off western Kyushu and the Sea of Japan side of Honshu, where peak catches occurred from March to May and March to April, respectively; from there effort shifted to the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido and Sanriku, where catches peaked in May for the former area and from April to May in the latter area. Effort was finally diverted to the Pacific side of Hokkaido, where peak catches were made from July to September. The season as a whole extended from February to October.

In 1973 a duel factory-catcher boat was built, the &quot;Miwa Maru&quot;, which caught 279 minke whales from 1973 to 1975, mainly in the Okhotsk Sea. Japanese pelagic fleets also caught six in the Gulf of Alaska, four in 1964 and two in 1971; an additional 22 were taken by pelagic fleets in the western North Pacific and western Bering Sea in 1969, 1970, and 1976 – the last, a immature female taken at , was a special permit catch.

Commercial catches ended in 1987. In 1994, Japan began catching minke whales in the western North Pacific under scientific permit. Under the title of JARPN (Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the North Pacific), up to 100 whales were caught each year by a pelagic fleet consisting of the 7,198 to 7,575 gross ton factory ship &quot;Nisshin Maru&quot; and two to three sighting/sampling vessels – including &quot;Toshi Maru No. 25&quot; (739.92 gross tons, 1994–1999), &quot;Toshi Maru No. 18&quot; (758.33 gross tons, 1994–1998), &quot;Kyo Maru No. 1&quot; (812.08 gross tons, 1995–1999), and &quot;Yushin Maru&quot; (720 gross tons, 1999) – until 1999. A total of 498 minke whales were caught. After a two-year feasibility study, JARPN II began in 2002, also taking up to 100 whales per year with a pelagic fleet consisting mainly of the same vessels – &quot;Nisshin Maru&quot; was enlarged to 8,030 gross tons in 2006 and &quot;Yūshin Maru No. 2&quot; (747 gross tons) and &quot;Yūshin Maru No. 3&quot; (742 gross tons) replaced &quot;Toshi Maru No. 25&quot; and &quot;Kyo Maru No. 1&quot; in 2003 and 2008, respectively – but expanding its operations to include a coastal component using three to four small-type sampling vessels – mainly &quot;Taisho Maru No. 28&quot; (47.31 gross tons, 2002–2012), &quot;Sumitomo Maru No. 31&quot; (32 gross tons, 2002–2010), &quot;Katsu Maru No. 7&quot; (32 gross tons, 2002–2012), and &quot;Koei Maru No. 75&quot; (46 gross tons, 2003–2010) – with a total of up to 120 individuals being caught off Sanriku in the spring and off Kushiro, on the Pacific side of Hokkaido, in the fall. This research program continues to the present.

Whaling for minke whales off Korea began in the early 1930s, when they were opportunistically caught by vessels targeting larger species. The number of boats used per year ranged from 13 (1967–68, 1983–84) to 24 (1965), with 21 per annum between 1975 and 1982. Their average tonnage and horsepower increased from 56 (1971) to 74.5 tons (1982) and from about 220 (1971) to nearly 539 horsepower (1982). In 1982, they ranged from the diminutive &quot;Gu Pok&quot;, only 18.3 tons and a mere 45 horsepower, to &quot;Tae Won&quot; and &quot;Jin Yang 5&quot; – each nearly 99 tons – and &quot;Chung Gu 1&quot;, &quot;Chung Gu 2&quot; and &quot;U Seung 3&quot;, all three with 1,000 horsepower. Minkes were permitted to be landed for flensing at the main whaling stations of Ulsan, on the east coast, and Ucheango, on the west coast, as well as Jukbyeon, Kuryongpo, Heusando, Daichangdo, and Cheju. By the early 1960s a few hundred were being caught each year. The catch increased from 715 in 1970, to 882 in 1973, to a peak of 1,033 and 1,018 in 1977 and 1978. Minkes were caught almost year-round (February to December), with the most important whaling ground being the central Yellow Sea from March to April. From there, catches extended to the Korean Strait in May and the southwestern Sea of Japan from June to October. Most were caught from April to June, with a peak in the Yellow Sea in April and in the Sea of Japan in June. They were also caught in the northern Yellow Sea and off the east coast of North Korea (before 1936), where peak catches were reached from May to June and from April to June, respectively. About 16,000 were caught between 1940 and 1986, when hunting of minke whales ceased.

A small number of minke whales were caught by the Soviets in the western North Pacific, with 21 being taken by pelagic fleets between 1933 and 1979 and an additional 94 being caught by catchers operating out of the Kuril Island land stations – the annual catch in the latter region never exceeded nine or ten whales (1951, 1954, and 1956).

One was caught off British Columbia and taken to the whaling station at Coal Harbour, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, in 1967.

=== Southern Hemisphere ===

Few dwarf minke whales have been reported taken by whaling operations. Thirteen were caught off Durban, South Africa, between 1970 and 1973. Nearly all of them (12 of 13, or 92%) were taken in the first half of the season (April to June), over three-quarters within 30 nautical miles of shore. Of 902 minke whales caught off northeastern Brazil in 1980, only three were dwarf. Of 1,789 minke whales caught in the Southern Ocean by the Japanese between 1987–88 and 1992–93, only 16 were dwarf minkes (one was caught in 1987–88, five in 1988–89, three in 1989–90, four in 1990–91, and three in 1992–93). These were taken from December to March between the latitudes of 55°22&#x27;S and 65°04&#x27;S and the longitudes of 111°26&#x27;E and 178°12&#x27;E. An additional 180 minke whales (47 males, 133 females) which had flippers with a &quot;clear white band&quot; were taken by Japanese expeditions in the sub-Antarctic between 1972–73 and 1976–77, with a peak of 69 in 1975–76.

== Other mortality ==

Minke whales are occasionally caught in fishing gear of various types, including set nets, fish pots, gillnets, trap nets, trawls, longlines, and seines. Entanglements have been reported off Korea, Japan, Canada, the United States, the Azores, Scotland, Portugal, France, Italy, Greece, Tunisia, Israel, the Canary Islands, Senegal, and Brazil. A total of 1,156 minke whales were caught off Korea between 1996 and 2008, an average of about 88 per year. They were mainly caught with set nets (31.4%), fish pots (27.3%), and gillnets (26.2%). Most were juveniles. Of 17 individuals that were reported caught in trap nets off eastern Honshu between 1978 and 1990, only two escaped alive, the rest being sold for their meat. Ship strikes are another source of mortality. They have been reported off the east coast of the United States, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and off Italy. A dwarf minke whale calf that stranded in New South Wales had one of its flukes cut by a propeller, which was the likely reason for its stranding and ensuing death.

In April 2007, a juvenile female minke whale died from domoic acid poisoning by ingesting northern anchovies – a known domoic acid vector – during an intense &quot;Pseudo-nitzschia&quot; bloom off Southern California. In March 2013, a severely emaciated juvenile male stranded at Nieuwpoort, Belgium. It was believed to have died after a prolonged starvation due to compacted plastic debris obstructing its digestive tract – the first confirmed case of death due to the ingestion of litter in a baleen whale. In May 2014, a individual that stranded at Atlantic City, New Jersey, tested positive for morbillivirus.

Minke whale strandings on the Atlantic coast of the United States, from Maine to South Carolina, have increased in frequency since January 2017. These strandings have been declared an Unusual Mortality Event (UME) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Full or partial necropsies have been conducted on over 60% of the minke whales stranded on the Atlantic coast since January 2017. Though human interactions and infectious disease were indicated by many of the necropsies, findings have been inconsistent and the cause of the strandings is not fully understood.

== Captivity ==

Several minke whales have been briefly held in captive settings in Japan. All were kept at the Mito Aquarium, in the suburbs of Numazu, Shizuoka, in a square pool netted off from the sea. The first was exhibited for nearly three months in the mid-1930s, but accepted food only during the latter half of its stay. The second was a weeks-old calf that lasted only two weeks in May 1954 before dying. The last was an estimated individual of undetermined sex that had been caught in a fixed net near the aquarium on 26 November 1955 and transported there the same day. It refused the anchovies given to it – though it may have fed on a school of mackerels kept in the pool with it – and simply swam in a counter clockwise circle for 37 days before breaking through the nets on the morning of 2 January 1956, not long after three bottlenose dolphins had been introduced to the same pool.

== Conservation status ==
The common minke whale is considered &quot;Least Concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List.
In addition, the species is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS).

<text>The Antarctic minke whale or southern minke whale (Balaenopterabonaerensis) is a species of minke whale within the suborder of baleen whales. It is the second smallest rorqual after the common minke whale and the third smallest baleen whale. Although first scientifically described in the mid-19th century, it was not recognized as a distinct species until the 1990s. Once ignored by the whaling industry due to its small size and low oil yield, the Antarctic minke was able to avoid the fate of other baleen whales and maintained a large population into the 21st century, numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Surviving to become the most abundant baleen whale in the world, it is now one of the mainstays of the industry alongside its cosmopolitan counterpart the common minke. It is primarily restricted to the Southern Hemisphere (although vagrants have been reported in the North Atlantic) and feeds mainly on euphausiids.

==Taxonomy==

===History===

In February 1867, a fisherman found an estimated male rorqual floating in the Río de la Plata near Belgrano, about ten miles from Buenos Aires, Argentina. After bringing it ashore he brought it to the attention of the German Argentine zoologist Hermann Burmeister, who described it as a new species, &quot;Balaenoptera bonaerensis&quot;, the same year. The skeleton of another specimen, a individual taken off Otago Head, South Island, New Zealand, in October 1873, was sent by Professor Frederick Hutton, keeper of the Otago Museum in Dunedin, to the British Museum in London, where it was examined by the British zoologist John Edward Gray, who described it as a new species of &quot;pike whale&quot; (minke whale, &quot;B. acutorostrata&quot;) and named it &quot;B. huttoni&quot;. Both descriptions were largely ignored for a century.

Gordon R. Williamson was the first to describe a dark-flippered form in the Southern Hemisphere, based on three specimens, a pregnant female taken in 1955 and two males taken in 1957, all brought aboard the British factory ship &quot;Balaena&quot;. All three had uniformly pale gray flippers and bicolored baleen, with white plates in the front and gray plates in the back. Further studies in the 1960s supported his description. In the 1970s osteological and morphological studies suggested it was at least a subspecies of the common minke whale, which was designated &quot;B. a. bonaerensis&quot;, after Burmeister&#x27;s specimen. In the 1980s further studies based on external appearance and osteology suggested there were in fact two forms in the Southern Hemisphere, a larger form with dark flippers and a &quot;diminutive&quot; or &quot;dwarf form&quot; with white flippers, the latter of which appeared to be more closely related to the common form of the Northern Hemisphere. This was strengthened by genetic studies using allozyme and mitochondrial DNA analyses, which proposed there were at least two species of minke whale, &quot;B. acutorostrata&quot; and &quot;B. bonaerensis&quot;, with the dwarf form being more closely related to the former species. One study, in fact, suggested that sei whales and the offshore form of Bryde&#x27;s whale were more closely related to one another than either species of minke whale were to each other. The American scientist Dale W. Rice supported these conclusions in his seminal work on marine mammal taxonomy, giving what he called the &quot;Antarctic minke whale&quot; (&quot;B. bonaerensis&quot;, Burmeister, 1867), full specific status – this was followed by the International Whaling Commission a few years later. Other organizations followed suit.

===Divergence===

Antarctic and common minke whales diverged from each other in the Southern Hemisphere 4.7 million years ago, during a prolonged period of global warming in the early Pliocene which disrupted the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and created local pockets of upwelling, facilitating speciation by fragmenting populations.

===Hybrids===

There have been two confirmed hybrids between Antarctic and common minke whales. Both were caught in the northeastern North Atlantic by Norwegian whaling vessels. The first, an female taken off western Spitsbergen () on 20 June 2007, was the result of a pairing between a female Antarctic minke and a male common minke. The second, a pregnant female taken off northwestern Spitsbergen () on 1 July 2010, on the other hand, had a common minke mother and an Antarctic minke father. Her female fetus, in turn, was fathered by a North Atlantic common minke, demonstrating that back-crossing is possible between hybrids of the two species.

==Description==

===Size===

The Antarctic minke is among the smallest of the baleen whales, with only the common minke and the pygmy right whale being smaller. The longest caught off Brazil were an female taken in 1969 and an male taken in 1975, the former four feet longer than the second longest females and the latter five feet longer than the second longest males. Off South Africa, the longest measured were a female and a male. The heaviest caught in the Antarctic were a female that weighed 10.4 metric tons (11.5 short tons) and an male that weighed 8.8 metric tons (9.7 short tons). At physical maturity, females average and males . At sexual maturity, females average and males . Calves are estimated to be at birth.

===External appearance===

Like their close relative the common minke, the Antarctic minke whale is robust for its genus. They have a narrow, pointed, triangular rostrum with a low splashguard. Their prominent, upright, falcate dorsal fin – often more curved and pointed than in common minkes –is set about two-thirds the way along the back. About half of individuals have a light gray flare or patch on the posterior half of the dorsal fin, similar to that seen in species of dolphins in the genus &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot;. They are dark gray dorsally and clean white ventrally. The lower jaw projects beyond the upper jaw and is dark gray on both sides. Antarctic minkes lack the light gray &quot;rostral saddle&quot; present in the common and dwarf forms. All individuals possess pale, thin &quot;blowhole streaks&quot; trailing from the blowhole slits, which first veer left and then right – particularly the right streak. These streaks appear to be more prominent and consistent on this species than on either the common or dwarf minke. Most also have a variably colored – light gray, light gray with dark edges, or simply dark – &quot;ear streak&quot; trailing behind the opening for the auditory meatus, which widens and becomes more diffuse posteriorly. A light gray variably shaped &quot;double chevron&quot; or W-shaped pattern (analogous to a similar pattern seen on their larger cousin the fin whale) lies between the flippers. This broadens to form a light gray &quot;shoulder patch&quot; above the flippers. Like common and dwarf minkes, they have two light gray to whitish swaths, called the &quot;thorax&quot; and &quot;flank patches&quot;, the former running diagonally up from the axilla and diagonally down again to form a triangular intrusion into the dark gray of the thorax and the latter rising more vertically along its anterior edge and extending further dorsally before gradually sloping posteriorly to merge with the white of the ventral side of the caudal peduncle. A dark gray, roughly triangular &quot;thorax field&quot; separates the two, while a narrower dark gray &quot;shoulder infill&quot; separates the thorax patch from the shoulder patch. Two light gray, forward directed &quot;caudal chevrons&quot; extend from the dark gray field above, forming a whitish &quot;peduncle blaze&quot; between them. The smooth sided flukes, usually about wide, are dark gray dorsally and clean white (occasionally light gray to gray) ventrally with a thin, dusky margin. Some small, dark gray &quot;speckling&quot; may be present on the body.

Antarctic minkes lack the bright white, transverse &quot;flipper band&quot; of the common minke and the white &quot;shoulder blaze&quot; and bright white &quot;flipper patch&quot; (occupying the proximal two-thirds of the flipper) of the dwarf minke. Instead, their narrow, pointed flippers, about one-sixth to one-eighth of the total body length, are normally either a plain light gray with an almost white leading edge and a darker gray trailing edge or two-toned, with a thin light gray or dark band separating the darker gray of the proximal third of the flipper from the lighter gray of the distal two-thirds. Unlike the dwarf minke, the dark gray between the eye and flipper does not extend unto the ventral grooves of the throat to form a &quot;dark throat patch&quot;; there is instead an irregularly shaped line running from about the level of the eye to the anterior insertion of the flipper, merging with the light gray of the shoulder patch.

The longest baleen plates average in length and about in breadth and number 155 to 415 pairs (average 273). They are two-toned, with a dark gray outer margin on the posterior plates and a white outer margin on the anterior plates – though there may be some rows of dark plates amongst the white plates. There is a degree of asymmetry, with a smaller number of white plates on the left side than on the right (12% on average for the left versus 34% on average for the right). The dark gray border occupies about one third of the width of the plates (ranging from about one-seventh to over half of its width), with the average width being greater on the left side than on the right. In contrast, dwarf minkes have smaller baleen plates of only in length, have a greater number of white plates (over 54%, often 100%) that lack this asymmetrical coloration, and have a narrow dark gray border (when present) of less than 6% of the width of the plate. Antarctic minkes have an average of 42 to 44 thin, narrow ventral grooves (range 32 to 70) that extend to about 48% of the length of the body – well short of the umbilicus.

==Distribution==
===Range===
Antarctic minke whales occur throughout much of the Southern Hemisphere. In the western South Atlantic, they have been recorded off Brazil from 0°53&#x27;N to 27°35&#x27;S (nearly year-round), Uruguay, off central Patagonia in Argentina (November–December), and in the Strait of Magellan and Beagle Channel of southern Chile (February–March), while in the eastern South Atlantic they have been recorded in the Gulf of Guinea off Togo, off Angola, Namibia (February), and Cape Province, South Africa. In the Indian and Pacific Oceans, they have been recorded off Natal Province, South Africa, Réunion (July), Australia (July–August), New Zealand, New Caledonia (June), Ecuador (2°S, October), Peru (12°30&#x27;S, September–October), and the northern fjords of southern Chile. Vagrants have been reported in Suriname – an female was killed upstream the Coppename River in October 1963; the Gulf of Mexico, where a female was found dead off the US state of Louisiana in February 2013; and off Jan Mayen (June) in the northeastern North Atlantic.

They appear to disperse into offshore waters during the breeding season. In the spring (October–December), Japanese sighting surveys from 1976 to 1987 recorded relatively high encounter rates of minke whales off South Africa and Mozambique (20° – 30°S, 30° – 40°E), off Western Australia (20° – 30°S, 110° – 120°E), around the Gambier Islands of French Polynesia (20° – 30°S, 130° – 140°W), and in the eastern South Pacific (10° – 20°S, 110° – 120°W). Later surveys, which distinguished between Antarctic and dwarf minke whales, showed that most of these were Antarctic minke whales.

They have a circumpolar distribution in the Southern Ocean (where they have been recorded year-round), including the Bellingshausen, Scotia, Weddell and Ross Seas. They are most abundant in the MacKenzie Bay-Prydz Bay area (60° – 80°E, south of 66°S) and relatively numerous off Queen Maud Land (0° – 20°E, 66° – 70°S), in the Davis (80° – 100°E, south of 66°S) and Ross Seas (160°E – 140°W, south of 70°S), and in the southern Weddell Sea (20° – 40°W, south of 70°S). Like their larger cousin the blue whale, they have a particular affinity for the pack ice. In the spring (October–November), they occur widely throughout the pack ice zone to near the edge of the fast ice, where they have been observed between belts of pack ice and in leads and polynyas – often in heavy ice cover. Some individuals have become trapped in the ice and were forced to overwinter in the Antarctic – for example, up to 120 &quot;lesser rorquals&quot; were trapped in a small breathing hole with sixty killer whales and an Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale in Prince Gustav Channel, east of the Antarctic Peninsula and west of James Ross Island, in August 1955.

===Migration and movements===

Two Antarctic minke whales marked with &quot;Discovery tags&quot; – stainless steel tubes with an inscription and number engraved on them – in the Southern Ocean during the austral summer (January) were recovered a few years later off northeastern Brazil (6° – 7°S, 34°W) during the austral winter (July and September, respectively). The first was marked off Queen Maud Land () and the second southeast of the South Orkney Islands (). Over twenty individuals marked with these Discovery tags showed large-scale movements around the Antarctic continent, each moving more than 30 degrees of longitude – two, in fact, had moved over 100 degrees of longitude. The first was marked off the Adélie Coast () and recovered the following season off the Princess Ragnhild Coast (), a minimum of 114 degrees of longitude. The second was marked north of Cape Adare () and recovered nearly six years later northwest of the Riiser-Larsen Peninsula (), a minimum of over 139 degrees of longitude. Both were marked and recovered in January.

On 20 January 1972, a broken-off bill of a marlin (&quot;Makaira&quot; sp.) was found embedded in the rostrum of a minke whale caught in the Southern Ocean at , providing indirect evidence of migration to the warmer tropical or subtropical waters of the Indian Ocean.

===Population===

Earlier estimates suggested that there were several hundred thousand minke whales in the Southern Ocean. In 2012, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission agreed upon a best estimate of 515,000. The Report of the Scientific Committee acknowledged that this estimate is subject to some degree of negative bias because some minke whales would have been outside the surveyable ice edge boundaries.

==Biology==

===Natural history===

Antarctic minke whales become sexually mature at 5 to 8 years of age for males and 7 to 9 years of age for females. Both become physically mature at about 18 years of age. After a gestation period of about 10 months, a single calf of is born – twin and triplet fetuses have been reported, but are rare. After a lactation period of about six months, the calf is weaned at a length of . The calving interval is estimated to be about 12.5 to 14 months. Peak calving is from May to June, while peak conception is from August to September. Females may live up to 43 years of age.

===Prey===

Antarctic minke whales feed almost exclusively on euphausiids. In the Southern Ocean, over 90% of individuals fed on Antarctic krill (&quot;Euphausia superba&quot;); &quot;E. crystallorophias&quot; also formed an important part of the diet in some areas, particularly in the relatively shallow waters of Prydz Bay. Rare and incidental items include calanoid copepods, the pelagic amphipod &quot;Themisto gaudichaudii&quot;, Antarctic sidestripes (&quot;Pleuragramma antarcticum&quot;), the crocodile icefish &quot;Cryodraco antarcticus&quot;, nototheniids, and myctophids. The majority of individuals examined off South Africa had empty stomachs. The few that did have food in their stomachs had all preyed on euphausiids, mainly &quot;Thysanoessa gregaria&quot; and &quot;E. recurva&quot;.

===Predation===

Antarctic minke whales are the main prey item of Type A killer whales in the Southern Ocean. Their remains have been found in the stomachs of killer whales caught by the Soviets, while individuals caught by the Japanese exhibited damaged flippers with tooth rake scars and parallel scarring on the body suggestive of killer whale attacks. Large groups of killer whales have also been observed chasing, attacking, and even killing Antarctic minke whales. Most attacks involve Type A killer whales, but on one occasion, in January 2009, a group of ten Type B or pack ice killer whales, which normally preyed on Weddell seals in the area by wave-washing them off ice floes, were observed to attack, kill, and feed on a juvenile Antarctic minke whale in Laubeuf Fjord, between Adelaide Island and the Antarctic Peninsula.

===Parasites and epibiotics===

Little has been published on the parasitic and epibiotic fauna of Antarctic minke whales. Individuals were often found with orange-brown to yellowish patches of the diatom &quot;Cocconeis ceticola&quot; on their bodies – 35.7% off South Africa and 67.5% in the Antarctic. Of a sample of whales caught by a Japanese expedition along the ice edge, one-fifth was infested with cyamids (those from one whale were identified as &quot;Cyamus balaenopterae&quot;). Several hundred of these whale lice can be found on a single whale, with an average of 55 per individual – most are found at the end of the ventral grooves and around the umbilicus. The copepod &quot;Pennella&quot; was found on only one whale. Cestodes were commonly found in the intestines (one example was identified as &quot;Tetrabothrius affinis&quot;).

==Behavior==

===Group size and composition===

Antarctic minke whales are more gregarious than their smaller counterparts, the common and dwarf minke whale. The average group size in the Antarctic was about 2.4 (adjusted downwards for observer bias), with about a quarter of the sightings consisting of singles and one-fifth of pairs; the largest aggregation consisted of 60 individuals. Off South Africa, the average group size was about two, with singles (nearly 46%) and pairs (31%) being the most common – the largest was 15. Off Brazil, most sightings were of singles (32.6%) or pairs (31.5%), with the largest group consisting of 17 individuals.

Like common minke whales, Antarctic minkes exhibit a great deal of spatial and temporal segregation by sex, age class, and reproductive condition. Off South Africa, immature animals predominate from April to May, while mature whales (mainly males) dominate from June onwards – in August and September mature males often accompany cow-calf pairs. Off Brazil, a good proportion of the individuals are immature (particularly for females) in July and August, but by September most are mature, and by October and November nearly all are mature. Females outnumber males two to one off Brazil, while the opposite is true off South Africa, where males outnumber females nearly two to one. Over a quarter of the females off South Africa were found to be lactating, whereas lactating females are very rare in the Antarctic – though a cow-calf pair was observed in the austral winter (August) in the Lazarev Sea. In the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic, immature animals are normally solitary and occur in lower latitudes further offshore, while mature whales are typically found in mixed groups (usually one sex outnumbers the other, and groups composed solely of males or females are occasionally found) and occur in higher latitudes. Mature males dominate in middle latitudes, while mature females predominate in the higher latitudes of the pack ice zone – from two-thirds to three-quarters of the whales in the Ross Sea consist of pregnant females.

An immature Antarctic minke whale was observed briefly associating with four dwarf minke whales on the Great Barrier Reef in July 2000.

Unlike common minke whales, they often have a prominent blow, which is particularly visible in the calmer waters near the pack ice. In the narrow holes and cracks in the pack ice they have been observed spyhopping – raising their head vertically – to expose their blowholes to breathe; individuals have even been seen to break breathing holes through sea ice in the winter (July–August), rising in a similar manner. When traveling fast in open water they can create larger versions of the &quot;roostertail&quot; of spray created by their smaller cousin, the Dall&#x27;s porpoise. During bouts of feeding they will lunge multiple times onto their side (either left or right) into a dense patch of prey with mouth agape and ventral pleats expanded as their gular pouch fills with prey-laden water. After making a series of shorter dives during which they will surface anywhere from two to fifteen times, they will make a longer dive of up fourteen minutes. Shallower dives of normally less than are made at night (from about 8 p.m. to about 2 am) while deeper dives that can be over deep are made during the day (from about 2 a.m. to about 8 pm).

===Vocalizations===

Antarctic minke whales produce a variety of sounds, including whistles, calls reminiscent of a clanging bell, clicks, screeches, grunts, downsweeps, and a sound called bio-duck. Downsweeps are intense, low frequency calls that sweep down from about 130 to 115 Hz to about 60 Hz, with a peak frequency of 83 Hz. Each sweep has a duration of 0.2 seconds and an average source level of about 147 decibels at a reference pressure of one micropascal at one metre. The bio-duck call, first described in the 1960s and named by sonar operators on Oberon-class submarines for its purported resemblance to the quack of a duck, consist of a series of anywhere from three to a dozen pulse trains that range from 50 to 200 Hz and have a peak frequency of about 154 Hz – they sometimes also possess harmonics of up to 1 kHz. They are repeated about every 1.5 to 3 seconds and have a source level of 140 decibels at a reference pressure of one micropascal at one metre. Their source remained a mystery for decades until attributed to the Antarctic minke whale in a paper published in 2014 – though it had been suggested to originate from this species as early as the mid-2000s. It has been recorded in the Ross and Lazarev Seas, over Perth Canyon, off Western Australia from late June to early December, and in the King Haakon VII Sea from April to December. The sound seems to be made near the surface before foraging dives, but nothing is known of its function.

==Whaling==
The barque &quot;Antarctic&quot;, sent by whaling pioneer Svend Foyn and led by Henrik Johan Bull, managed to harpoon at least three minke whales in the Antarctic between December 1894 and January 1895. Two were saved, both being used for fresh meat (one had only yielded two barrels of blubber). In December 1923, when the men of the first modern whaling expedition to visit the Ross Sea saw &quot;a number of spouts&quot; after leaving the ice edge they were soon disgusted to find out that they from lowly minke whales. The few caught by the British in the 1950s were taken more for curiosity than anything else. The chemist Christopher Ash, who had served on the British factory ship &quot;Balaena&quot; during this time, stated that they were small enough to be lifted by their tails using a 10-ton spring balance and weighed entire. &quot;Generally this is done when there are no other whales about and the deck empty except for a crowd of sightseers,&quot; Ash explained, &quot;but this crowd quickly scatters when the whale is just hanging free and starts to spin around and swing from side to side, as it almost always does.&quot; Like Bull before him, Ash commented on their meat, which he described as &quot;fine-textured in comparison with the other whales, and if properly cooked almost indistinguishable from beef.&quot;

They were primarily exploited for this very reason – their high quality meat – in later years, which fetched as much as two dollars a pound in 1977. With the larger blue, fin, and sei whales depleted, whaling nations focused their attention on the smaller, but more numerous, minke whales. Though the Soviets had caught several hundred in the 1950s, it was not until 1971–72 that a significant catch was made, with over 3,000 being taken (nearly all by a single Japanese expedition). Not wanting to repeat the same mistakes it had made with previous species, the International Whaling Commission set a quota of 5,000 for the following season, 1972–73. Despite these precautions, the quota was exceeded by 745 – later quotas would be as high as 8,000.

During the commercial whaling era, from 1950 to 1951 to 1986–87, 97,866 minke whales (the vast majority probably Antarctic minkes) were caught in the Southern Ocean – mainly by the Japanese and Soviets – with a peak of 7,900 being reached in 1976–77. Harpoon guns of lesser caliber and &quot;cold harpoons&quot; (harpoons without explosive shells) had to be used due to their small size, while no air was pumped into the carcasses when they were tied alongside for towing to ensure the greatest quality of meat. While an expedition or two was fitted out each year specifically for minke whales – the &quot;Jinyo Maru&quot; in 1971–72, the &quot;Chiyo Maru&quot; from 1972 to 1973 to 1974–75, and the &quot;Kyokusei Maru&quot; in 1973–74 – most expeditions, which targeted other species, ignored minkes during the peak of the whaling season (November–December and late February to early March) and only caught them on whaling grounds relatively close to those of larger ones – the minke whaling grounds were much further south (south of 60°S) than those for fin and sei whales.

From 1987 to the present, Japan has been sending a fleet consisting of a single factory ship and several catcher/spotting vessels to the Southern Ocean to catch Antarctic minkes under Article VIII of the IWC, which allows the culling of whales for scientific research. The first research program, Japanese Research Program in the Antarctic (JARPA), began in 1987–88, when 273 Antarctic minkes were caught. The quota and catch soon increased to 330 and 440. In 2005–06, the second research program, JARPA II, began. In its first two years, in what Japan called its &quot;feasibility study&quot;, 850 Antarctic minkes, as well as 10 fin whales, were to be taken each season (2005–06 and 2006–07). The quota was reached in the first season, but due to a fire, only 508 Antarctic minkes were caught in the second. In 2007–08, because of constant harassment from environmental groups, they failed to reach the quota again, with a catch of only 551 whales.

Beginning in 1968, larger numbers of minke whales were caught off Natal, South Africa, mainly to supplement the dwindling supply of larger species, particularly the sei whale. A total of 1,113 whales (nearly all Antarctic minke, but a few dwarf minke as well) were caught off the province between 1968 and 1975, with a peak of 199 in 1971. They were taken by whale catchers of 539 to 593 gross tons with 90 mm harpoon guns mounted on their bows, which brought them to the whaling station at Durban () for processing. Gunners refused to take minkes early in the day, because sharks devoured any minke carcasses that were flagged, forcing the catchers to tow them during the chasing of other whales and thus slowing them down. They also could not use asdic, as it frightened them and lead to protracted chases. The season lasted from February to September, with a peak in the last month of the season.

In 1966, minke whales became the target of whaling operations off northeastern Brazil (6° – 8°S) due, once again, to the decline of sei whales. Over 14,000 were caught between 1949 and 1985, with a peak of 1,039 in 1975. They were caught by a succession of whale catchers – the 367-ton &quot;Koyo Maru 2&quot; (1966–1971), the 306-ton &quot;Seiho Maru 2&quot; (1971–1977), and the 395-ton &quot;Cabo Branco&quot; (also called &quot;Katsu Maru 10&quot;, 1977–1985) – up to 100 miles offshore and brought to the whaling station at Costinha, operated by the Compania de Pesca Norte do Brasil (COPESBRA) since 1911. The season lasted from June to December, with a peak in either September or October.

An male Antarctic minke whale (confirmed by genetics) was caught west of Jan Mayen () in the northeastern North Atlantic on 30 June 1996.

==Other mortality==

Entanglement in fishing gear and probably ship strikes are other sources of mortality. The former have been reported off Peru and Brazil, and the latter off South Australia. All involved calves or juveniles.

==Conservation status==
The Antarctic minke whale is currently considered Near Threatened by the IUCN red list. However, the IUCN states that the population size is &quot;clearly in the hundreds of thousands&quot;.

The Antarctic minke whale is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

In addition, the Antarctic minke whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region.

<doc id="300082" wikidata="Q332774" url="?curid=300082" title="Anechoic chamber">
<text>An anechoic chamber (&quot;an-echoic&quot; meaning &quot;non-reflective&quot; or &quot;without echoes&quot;) is a room designed to stop reflections or echoes of either sound or electromagnetic waves. They are also often isolated from energy entering from their surroundings. This combination means that a person or detector exclusively hears direct sounds (no reflected sounds), in effect simulating being outside in a free field.

Anechoic chambers, a term coined by American acoustics expert Leo Beranek, were initially exclusively used to refer to acoustic anechoic chambers. Recently, the term has been extended to other radio frequency (RF) and sonar anechoic chambers, which eliminate reflection and external noise caused by electromagnetic waves.

Anechoic chambers range from small compartments the size of household microwave ovens to ones as large as aircraft hangars. The size of the chamber depends on the size of the objects and frequency ranges being tested.

==Acoustic anechoic chambers==

The requirement for what was subsequently called an anechoic chamber originated to allow testing of loudspeakers that generated such intense sound levels that they could not be tested outdoors in inhabited areas.

Anechoic chambers are commonly used in acoustics to conduct experiments in nominally &quot;free field&quot; conditions, free field meaning that there are no reflected signals. All sound energy will be traveling away from the source with almost none reflected back. Common anechoic chamber experiments include measuring the transfer function of a loudspeaker or the directivity of noise radiation from industrial machinery. In general, the interior of an anechoic chamber can be very quiet, with typical noise levels in the 10–20 dBA range. In 2005, the best anechoic chamber measured at −9.4 dBA. In 2015, an anechoic chamber on the campus of Microsoft broke the world record with a measurement of −20.6 dBA. The human ear can typically detect sounds above 0 dBA, so a human in such a chamber would perceive the surroundings as devoid of sound. Anecdotally, some people may not like such silence and can become disoriented.

The mechanism by which anechoic chambers minimize the reflection of sound waves impinging onto their walls is as follows: In the included figure, an incident sound wave I is about to impinge onto a wall of an anechoic chamber. This wall is composed of a series of wedges W with height H. After the impingement, the incident wave I is reflected as a series of waves R which in turn &quot;bounce up-and-down&quot; in the gap of air A (bounded by dotted lines) between the wedges W. Such bouncing may produce (at least temporarily) a standing wave pattern in A. During this process, the acoustic energy of the waves R gets dissipated via the air&#x27;s molecular viscosity, in particular near the corner C. In addition, with the use of foam materials to fabricate the wedges, another dissipation mechanism happens during the wave/wall interactions. As a result, the component of the reflected waves R along the direction of I that escapes the gaps A (and goes back to the source of sound), denoted R&#x27;, is notably reduced. Even though this explanation is two-dimensional, it is representative and applicable to the actual three-dimensional wedge structures used in anechoic chambers.

===Semi-anechoic and hemi-anechoic chambers===
Full anechoic chambers aim to absorb energy in all directions. To do this, all surfaces, including the floor, need to be covered in correctly shaped wedges. A mesh grille is usually installed above the floor to provide a surface to walk on and place equipment. This mesh floor is typically placed at the same floor level as the rest of the building, meaning the chamber itself extends &quot;below&quot; floor level. This mesh floor is damped and floating on absorbent buffers to isolate it from outside vibration or electromagnetic signals.

In contrast, semi-anechoic or hemi-anechoic chambers have a solid floor that acts as a work surface for supporting heavy items, such as cars, washing machines, or industrial machinery, which could not be supported by the mesh grille in a full anechoic chamber. Recording studios are often semi-anechoic.

The distinction between &quot;semi-anechoic&quot; and &quot;hemi-anechoic&quot; is unclear. In some uses they are synonyms, or only one term is used. Other uses distinguish one as having an ideally reflective floor (creating free-field conditions with a single reflective surface) and the other as simply having a flat untreated floor. Still other uses distinguish them by size and performance, with one being likely an existing room retrofitted with acoustic treatment, and the other a purpose-built room which is likely larger and has better anechoic performance.

==Radio-frequency anechoic chambers==


The internal appearance of the radio frequency (RF) anechoic chamber is sometimes similar to that of an acoustic anechoic chamber; however, the interior surfaces of the RF anechoic chamber are covered with radiation absorbent material (RAM) instead of acoustically absorbent material. Uses for RF anechoic chambers include testing antennas and radars, and they are typically used to house the antennas for performing measurements of antenna radiation patterns and electromagnetic interference.

Performance expectations (gain, efficiency, pattern characteristics, etc.) constitute primary challenges in designing stand alone or embedded antennas. Designs are becoming ever more complex with a single device incorporating multiple technologies such as cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth, LTE, MIMO, RFID and GPS.

===Radiation-absorbent material===
RAM is designed and shaped to absorb incident RF radiation (also known as non-ionising radiation) as effectively as possible, from as many incident directions as possible. The more effective the RAM, the lower the resulting level of reflected RF radiation. Many measurements in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and antenna radiation patterns require that spurious signals arising from the test setup, including reflections, are negligible to avoid the risk of causing measurement errors and ambiguities.

===Effectiveness over frequency===

Waves of higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and are higher in energy, while waves of lower frequencies have longer wavelengths and are lower in energy, according to the relationship formula_1 where lambda represents wavelength, v is phase velocity of wave, and formula_2 is frequency. To shield for a specific wavelength, the cone must be of appropriate size to absorb that wavelength. The performance quality of an RF anechoic chamber is determined by its lowest test frequency of operation, at which measured reflections from the internal surfaces will be the most significant compared to higher frequencies. Pyramidal RAM is at its most absorptive when the incident wave is at normal incidence to the internal chamber surface and the pyramid height is approximately equal to formula_3, where formula_4 is the free space wavelength. Accordingly, increasing the pyramid height of the RAM for the same (square) base size improves the effectiveness of the chamber at low frequencies but results in increased cost and a reduced unobstructed working volume that is available inside a chamber of defined size.

===Installation into a screened room===
An RF anechoic chamber is usually built into a screened room, designed using the Faraday cage principle. This is because most of the RF tests that require an anechoic chamber to minimize reflections from the inner surfaces also require the properties of a screened room to attenuate unwanted signals penetrating inwards and causing interference to the equipment under test and prevent leakage from tests penetrating outside.

===Chamber size and commissioning===
At lower radiated frequencies, far-field measurement can require a large and expensive chamber. Sometimes, for example for radar cross-section measurements, it is possible to scale down the object under test and reduce the chamber size, provided that the wavelength of the test frequency is scaled down in direct proportion by testing at a higher frequency.

RF anechoic chambers are normally designed to meet the electrical requirements of one or more accredited standards. For example, the aircraft industry may test equipment for aircraft according to company specifications or military specifications such as MIL-STD 461E. Once built, acceptance tests are performed during commissioning to verify that the standard(s) are in fact met. Provided they are, a certificate will be issued to that effect. The chamber will need to be periodically retested.

===Operational use===
Test and supporting equipment configurations to be used within anechoic chambers must expose as few metallic (conductive) surfaces as possible, as these risk causing unwanted reflections. Often this is achieved by using non-conductive plastic or wooden structures for supporting the equipment under test. Where metallic surfaces are unavoidable, they may be covered with pieces of RAM after setting up to minimize such reflection as far as possible.

A careful assessment may be required as to whether the test equipment (as opposed to the equipment under test) should be placed inside or outside the chamber. Typically most of it is located in a separate screened room attached to the main test chamber, in order to shield it from both external interference and from the radiation within the chamber. Mains power and test signal cabling into the test chamber require high quality filtering.

Fiber optic cables are sometimes used for the signal cabling, as they are immune to ordinary RFI and also cause little reflection inside the chamber.

===Health and safety risks associated with RF anechoic chamber===
The following health and safety risks are associated with RF anechoic chambers:

*RF radiation hazard
*Fire hazard
*Trapped personnel

Personnel are not normally permitted inside the chamber during a measurement as this not only can cause unwanted reflections from the human body but may also be a radiation hazard to the personnel concerned if tests are being performed at high RF powers. Such risks are from RF or non-ionizing radiation and not from the higher energy ionizing radiation.

As RAM is highly absorptive of RF radiation, incident radiation will generate heat within the RAM. If this cannot be dissipated adequately there is a risk that hot spots may develop and the RAM temperature may rise to the point of combustion. This can be a risk if a transmitting antenna inadvertently gets too close to the RAM. Even for quite modest transmitting power levels, high gain antennas can concentrate the power sufficiently to cause high power flux near their apertures. Although recently manufactured RAM is normally treated with a fire retardant to reduce such risks, they are difficult to eliminate.

<text>The siege of Chaves refers to the French siege and capture of Fort São Francisco and the town of Chaves, Portugal from 10 to 12 March 1809, and the subsequent siege and recapture of the fort by Portuguese forces from 21 to 25 March 1809, during the second French invasion of Portugal in the Peninsular War.

==French invasions (1807-1811)==
Portugal suffered three invasions by French forces during the Peninsular War. The northern region of Trás-os-Montes, as all the country, had succumbed to the Napoleonic regency of Jean-Andoche Junot. As soon as news came of the disembarkation of the British in Portuguese Estremadura, the rebellion broke out. Bragança, and soon after Chaves, proclaimed liberation.

Napoleon, worried about what was happening in Spain and upset with the failure of the expedition of his forces, decided to come personally to the Peninsula, in whose submission he would eventually invest 300,000 men. The British, who had disembarked in 1807 in Galicia under the command of General John Moore, did not surpass 30,000 in number. Napoleon ordered Jean-de-Dieu Soult to pursue the British in Galicia. Moore&#x27;s army was defeated and hounded across the mountains of Lugo; the British general himself was killed during the final combats around the bay of Coruña, where the remnants of his forces re-embarked.

Several months later, Soult received orders to invade Portugal from the north and expel the British from Portuguese soil. The carrying out of order was, however, strongly impeded by the winter, which had made the Minho River almost impassable, and by the resistance of Portuguese forces located between Cerveira and Valença. Then General Soult decided to go around the mountainous border of the Upper Minho and cross the drywall of Trás-os-Montes. His forces numbered around 23,000 men (among them 4,000 on horse) and 50 artillery pieces. Some of these troops were experienced since they had participated in the battles of Friedland and Austerlitz. The border was crossed on 7 March 1809.

==Attack on Chaves==

The defense of the border of Trás-os-Montes was in the hands of brigadier Francisco Silveira, whose forces, numbering 2,800 regular troops, 2,500 militia, and only 50 cavalry, were concentrated around the stronghold of Chaves. The fortifications, which were in bad conditions, were protected by 50 pieces of artillery, but with only a few of them fit for service, they were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Pizarro. After initial skirmishes near the border, the Portuguese forces retreated to Chaves, and then Silveira ordered the stronghold to be abandoned.

This decision caused great unrest among the militias and the population. Prudently, the brigadier led his forces south, avoiding any risk against the superior forces. Pressured by the people and the militias, Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Pizarro disobeyed orders and accepted the command of the popular forces, preparing to resist the invading forces with 500 troops (1st line), 2,000 militia (2nd line) and 1,200 &quot;ordenanças&quot; (3rd line). Silveira tried to change his mind, even calling a war council to discuss the problem, but he couldn&#x27;t get a formal decision, especially since the French who arrived on the 10th of March were now preparing to attack the more northerly fort of São Neutel. Pizarro held his ground, and the future count left with his officers to join his forces, who had occupied the highlands south of Chaves.

Soult summoned Chaves&#x27;s stronghold to surrender, but no answer was given. But soon, it was evident in the fort that defense was useless. Although fire from the artillery and muskets persisted since the French arrival, the defenders ultimately recognized that Silveira&#x27;s retreat was the most sensible one. Soult sent a second message calling for the surrender of the stronghold, and it was accepted on 12 March. Chaves surrendered, and the French troops marched into the town on 13 March. Soult, with so many prisoners on his hands, released the civilians of the militias and &quot;ordenanças&quot;, under oath of not taking up arms against the French and tried to recruit 500 of the line troops, who soon deserted. These actions by Marshal Soult were strongly criticized by several of his officers, especially those who had participated in the first French invasion of Portugal of the previous year under Junot, as they preferred that the stronghold had been taken by assault and the garrison put to the sword. This wise and gentle proceeding was much blamed by some of his officers, especially those who had served under Junot. They desired that Chaves might be assaulted and the garrison put to the sword, for they were embued with a personal hatred of the Portuguese and, being adverse to serve in the present expedition, endeavored, as it would appear, to thwart their general (...). (Napier, 1828.)

==Portuguese counterattack==

Meanwhile, the Portuguese forces had left their positions near Vidago and retreated farther south to a low pass between Vila Pouca and Vila Real. Soult, though, had decided to make his way south by way of the Barroso, due west instead of south. He left a small garrison of a few hundred men in Chaves under the command of Major Messenger, and the hospital he had transferred from Monterey, Galicia, with many wounded or sick. As soon as Silveira knew that the main French army had gone away, he decided to attack Chaves. For some days, a French detachment had approached Vila Pouca to force the entrenched Portuguese forces to retreat. But soon, it was discovered that these forces had gone to Boticas to join up with the main French army already on its way west. Soult&#x27;s army went on to win the First Battle of Porto.

Once again, Silveira entered the Tâmega River valley and attacked the Chaves stronghold on 21 March. The small French garrison tried to resist, but the Portuguese knew the town well and could penetrate the walls through the &quot;Opening of the Butchershops.&quot; There was hand-to-hand combat in the streets, and the French, leaving almost 300 dead, retreated into the São Francisco Fort. Some 200 French fell prisoners into the hands of the Portuguese. The Portuguese, having no artillery, blockaded the French for four days. On the fifth day, when all was ready for the final assault to be carried out by escalating the fort, Silveira gave Messenger an ultimatum, under which he should surrender without conditions. Messenger then requested an hour of truce to take a decision. After the time given had ended, and still without a response, Silveira issued a final request, warning Messenger that if he did not surrender in five minutes, he would give orders to storm the fort. The French commander immediately surrendered without conditions. 25 officers, 23 civilians and surgeons, and about 1,300 soldiers were captured and escorted to Vila Real. The 114 Spanish left in Chaves as prisoners by Soult were restored to liberty.

This skillful maneuver by Silveira seriously upset Soult&#x27;s plans, obliging him to wait, for lack of supply lines, between the Douro and the Vouga. After the Second Battle of Porto, the French army was obliged by Wellesley to retreat quickly to its starting point, the city of Ourense in Galicia, Spain. In the final phase of this retreat, Silveira could almost intercept the French troops near Montealegre. Some of his detachments even saw the rearguard crossing the border near the rugged mountains of Larouco. Beresford had come up to Chaves and let the opportunity to destroy the French slip away. Once the danger had passed, Beresford, under the insistence of Silveira, called a court martial for Francisco Pizarro. This War Council occurred in Lisbon in 1809 and found the reckless lieutenant colonel innocent of the charges.

This successful defeat of the French by the poorly equipped Portuguese army gave the town of Chaves an essential place in Portuguese history. It, together with the defeat of pro-Royalist forces in 1912, gave Chaves the deserved title of the Heroic City of Chaves (Cidade Heróica de Chaves), the name of many streets and avenues in Portugal.

<text>The grey plover or black-bellied plover (Pluvialis squatarola) is a large plover breeding in Arctic regions. It is a long-distance migrant, with a nearly worldwide coastal distribution when not breeding.

==Taxonomy==
The grey plover was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tringa squatarola&quot;. It is now placed with three other plovers in the genus &quot;Pluvialis&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The genus name is Latin and means relating to rain, from &quot;pluvia&quot;, &quot;rain&quot;. It was believed that they flocked when rain was imminent. The species name &quot;squatarola&quot; is a Latinised version of &quot;Sgatarola&quot;, a Venetian name for some kind of plover.

The English common name used for this species differs in different parts of the world. It is generally known as &quot;grey plover&quot; in the Old World and &quot;black-bellied plover&quot; in the New World.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. s. squatarola&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – breeds in north Eurasia and Alaska; non-breeding in west, south Europe, Africa, south, east Asia and Australasia and west Americas
* &quot;P. s. tomkovichi&quot; Engelmoer &amp; Roselaar, 1998 – breeds on Wrangel Island (northeast Siberia) 
* &quot;P. s. cynosurae&quot; (Thayer &amp; Bangs, 1914) – breeds north Canada; non-breeding along coastal North and South America

==Description==
The grey plover is long with a wingspan of and a weight of (up to in preparation for migration). In spring and summer (late April or May to August), adults are spotted black and white on the back and wings. The face and neck are black with a white border; they have a black breast and belly and a white rump. The tail is white with black barring. The bill and legs are black. They moult to winter plumage in mid August to early September and retain this until April; this being a fairly plain grey above, with a grey-speckled breast and white belly. The juvenile and first-winter plumages, held by young birds from fledging until about one year old, are similar to the adult winter plumage but with the back feathers blacker with creamy white edging. In all plumages, the inner flanks and axillary feathers at the base of the underwing are black, a feature which readily distinguishes it from the other three &quot;Pluvialis&quot; species in flight. On the ground, it can also be told from the other &quot;Pluvialis&quot; species by its larger (), heavier bill.

==Breeding and migration==
Their breeding habitat is Arctic islands and coastal areas across the northern coasts of Alaska, Canada, and Russia. They nest on the ground in a dry open tundra with good visibility; the nest is a shallow gravel scrape. Four eggs (sometimes only three) are laid in early June, with an incubation period of 26–27 days; the chicks fledge when 35–45 days old.

They migrate to winter in coastal areas throughout the world. In the New World they winter from southwest British Columbia and Massachusetts south to Argentina and Chile, in the western Old World from Ireland and southwestern Norway south throughout coastal Africa to South Africa, and in the eastern Old World, from southern Japan south throughout coastal southern Asia and Australia, with a few reaching New Zealand. Most of the migrants to Australia are female. It makes regular non-stop transcontinental flights over Asia, Europe, and North America, but is mostly a rare vagrant on the ground in the interior of continents, only landing occasionally if forced down by severe weather, or to feed on the coast-like shores of very large lakes such as the Great Lakes, where it is a common passage migrant.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Young birds do not breed until two years old; they typically remain on the wintering grounds until their second summer.

===Food and feeding===
They forage for food on beaches and tidal flats, usually by sight. The food consists of small molluscs, polychaete worms, crustaceans, and insects. It is less gregarious than the other &quot;Pluvialis&quot; species, not forming dense feeding flocks, instead feeding widely dispersed over beaches, with birds well spaced apart. They will however form dense flocks on high tide roosts.

==Status==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has judged that the threat to the grey plover is of &quot;Vulnerable&quot;. It is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>Jacqueline Harpman (5 July 1929 – 24 May 2012) was a Belgian writer who wrote in French.

== Biography ==
Jacqueline Harpman was born on 5 July 1929, in Etterbeek, Belgium, to Jeanne Honorez and Andries Harpman, exporters of Belgian fabrics and lace to North African colonies. She was the second daughter born to the couple after her sister Andrée, nine years her senior. Her father being a Dutch-born Jew, Harpman&#x27;s family fled to Casablanca, Morocco when the Nazis invaded during World War II and they did not return to Belgium until the war had ended in 1945. A large part of her paternal family was killed at Auschwitz.

After studying French literature, Harpman began training to become a doctor but could not complete her studies as she contracted tuberculosis. She began writing in 1954 and her first work, &quot;L&#x27;Amour et l&#x27;acacia&quot;, was published in 1958. In 1980, she qualified as a psychoanalyst. &quot;I Who Have Never Known Men&quot; was her first book to be published in English, and was originally published with the title &quot;The Mistress of Silence&quot;.

Harpman continued to write and work as a psychoanalyst until her death. She died on 24 May 2012, in Brussels, Belgium, after having been severely ill for a long time. She was 82.

Upon her death, her archives were given to the Archives et Musée de la Littérature in Brussels, where archivists rebuilt her writing desk.

== Personal life ==
Harpman was married to Belgian filmmaker Émile Degelin from 1953 to 1962. She had two daughters, Marianne and Toinon, and four grandchildren.

==Honors==

* In 2019, an avenue in Brussels was named after her in acknowledgement of her works.

<text>Mystras or Mistras (), also known in the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; as Myzethras or Myzithras (Μυζηθρᾶς), is a fortified town and a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Situated on Mt. Taygetus, above ancient Sparta, and below a Frankish castle, it served as the capital of the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea in the 14th and 15th centuries, experiencing a period of prosperity and cultural flowering during the Palaeologan Renaissance, including the teachings of Gemistos Plethon. The city also attracted artists and architects of the highest quality.

Mystras remained inhabited throughout the Ottoman period, when Western travellers mistook it for ancient Sparta. In the 1830s, it was abandoned and the new town of Sparta was built, approximately eight kilometres to the east. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the Sparta municipality. As an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Byzantine city and because of its testimony to the development of Late Byzantine and Post-byzantine art, Mystras was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1989.

==Description==
Mystras is situated on the slopes of Taygetos Mountain. The archaeological site stands above the modern village of Mystras and the city of Sparta. The greenery surrounding the area is composed mainly by pine trees and cypresses. Some small rivers and lakes are found in the region. The city&#x27;s architecture was influenced by the &quot;Helladic&quot; school of Byzantine architecture, and many structures were informed by the architecture of Constantinople. Its overall urban planning though was shaped by the steeply sloping topography, with a distinct upper and lower city zone. Because of the slope making wheeled vehicles impractical, many of the streets are best characterized as footpaths. The main use of a terrace is for the Palace of the Despots (#8 on the plan below), and markets seem to have been located outside of the city walls. The Palace of the Despots expanded over the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and was constituted by several independent, adjoining units. The final main building follows the form of the Tekfur saray in Constantinople/Istanbul: three stories with the topmost devoted to a large audience hall, and the lower levels used for apartments and storerooms.

During the  Palaeologan Renaissance, the churches of Mystras were covered in elaborate frescoes and were well known for their libraries. Some of these decorations can still be seen in the Hagia Sophia church in the archeological site.

In addition to the Palace of the Despots and its famed late Byzantine churches, Mystras also has remains of several houses set on its hillside, such as the Frangopoulos House and the Laskaris House, both of which are early fifteenth-century buildings that use vaulted substructures for cisterns and stables to create a platform for the main residence. That consisted of a large room fronted by a balcony and with a fireplace in the rear.

==History==
===Foundation and Frankish rule===

In late 1248, William II of Villehardouin, ruler of the Frankish Principality of Achaea, captured Monemvasia, the last remaining Byzantine outpost on the Morea. This success was soon followed by the submission of the restive Tsakones on Mount Parnon, the Slavic Melingoi tribe of Mount Taygetos, and the inhabitants of the Mani peninsula, thereby extending his sway over all of Laconia and completing the conquest of the peninsula, which had begun in 1205, in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade. Laconia was incorporated into the princely domain, and the young prince passed the winter of 1248–49 there, touring the country and selecting sites for new fortifications such as Grand Magne and Leuktron; finally, near his residence of Lacedaemon (ancient Sparta), on a spur of Mount Taygetos, he built the fortress that came to be known as Mystras.

===Byzantine restoration===
In September 1259, William of Villehardouin was defeated and captured, along with many of his nobles, at the Battle of Pelagonia, by the forces of the Nicaean emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. Two years later, the Nicaeans recaptured Constantinople, putting an end to the Latin Empire and restoring the Byzantine Empire. At this point, the emperor concluded an agreement with the captive prince: William and his men would be set free in exchange for an oath of fealty, and for the cession of Monemvasia, Grand Magne, and Mystras. The handover was effected in 1262, and henceforth Mystras was the seat of the governor of the Byzantine territories in the Morea. Initially this governor (&quot;kephale&quot;) was changed every year, but after 1308 they started being appointed for longer terms. Almost immediately on his return to the Morea, William of Villehardouin renounced his oath to the emperor, and warfare broke out between Byzantines and Franks. The first Byzantine attempts to subdue the Principality of Achaea were beaten back in the battles of Prinitsa and Makryplagi, but the Byzantines were firmly ensconced in Laconia. Warfare became endemic, and the Byzantines slowly pushed the Franks back. The insecurity engendered by the raids and counter-raids caused the inhabitants of Lacedaemon to abandon their exposed city and settle at Mystras, in a new town built under the shadow of the fortress.

While Mystras served as the provincial capital from this time, it became a royal capital in 1349 CE, when the first despot was appointed to rule over the Morea. The Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos, reorganized the territory in 1349 to establish it as an appanage for his son, the Despot Manuel Kantakouzenos. From 1349 until its surrender to the Ottoman Turks on 31 May 1460, Mystras was the residence of a Despot who ruled over the Byzantine Morea, known as the &quot;Despotate of the Morea&quot;. For the larger portion of his reign, Manuel maintained peaceful relations with his Latin neighbors and secured a long period of prosperity for the area. Greco-Latin cooperation included an alliance to contain the raids of the Ottoman Sultan Murad I into Morea in the 1360s. The rival Palaiologos dynasty seized the Morea after Manuel&#x27;s death in 1380, with Theodore I Palaiologos becoming despot in 1383. Theodore ruled until 1407, consolidating Byzantine rule and coming to terms with his more powerful neighbours—particularly the expansionist Ottoman Empire, whose suzerainty he recognised. 

This was the city&#x27;s golden age; according to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium&quot;, Mystras &quot;witnessed a remarkable cultural renaissance, including the teaching of Plethon, and attracted artists and architects of the highest quality&quot;

====Centre of learning and culture====
Mystras was the last centre of Byzantine learning and culture; the famous Neoplatonist philosopher Gemistos Plethon lived there until he died in 1452. While there, Plethon served as a tutor and advisor to the young despot Theodore II until his death in 1452. He and other scholars based in Mystras influenced the Italian Renaissance, especially after he accompanied the emperor John VIII Palaiologos to Florence in 1439.

===Ottoman and Venetian years===
The last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos, was despot at Mystras before he came to the throne. Demetrios Palaiologos, the last despot of Morea, surrendered the city to Sultan Mehmed II in 30 May 1460. Under Ottoman rule it became part of the Sanjak of Mezistre. The Venetians occupied it from 1687 to 1715, but otherwise the Ottomans held it until 1821. The city joined the Orlov revolt in 1770. It was looted by Ottoman Albanians and the metropolitan bishop Ananias executed, despite having saved several Albanian lives in the uprising. A great number of local Greeks were also killed by the Albanian groups, while several children were sold into slavery. Mystras was left in ruins and this event was a significant factor leading up to its abandonment.

===Modern years===
The final straw to Mystras came in 1825 during the Greek war of Independence when Egyptians under the rule of Ibrahim massacred the local population and destroyed the local area. The town was rebuilt 9 km away under the name Sparta in 1831. Most families moved to Sparta, but a few decided to move instead to New Mystras, a small village in the countryside. This process of relocation was completed in 1953 when the remaining properties were confiscated by the municipality. In 1989 the ruins, including the fortress, palace, churches, and monasteries, were named a UNESCO World Heritage Site and features a museum and the partially restored ruins of the city. The only inhabitants today are a group of nuns who reside in the Pantanassa Monastery. The majority of the most important churches are still standing, including St. Demetrios, the Hagia Sophia, St. George, and the Monastery of Peribleptos. The Palace of the Despots has undergone substantial restorations in the past decade, making it a significant attraction. Visitors can reach the ruins via the modern city of Sparta, which is only a few miles from Mystras.

In the legendary account of the founding of the city, a lion came out of the forest when the site was chosen; hence the city was called &quot;Ban Singh Tha&quot; (), Home (of) Imposing Lion. At the bottom of the seal is a lotus flower (&quot;Nymphaea lotus&quot;), as the lotus is both the provincial flower of the province and of Ubon Ratchathani province, of which Yasothon was part until 1972. The provincial tree is &quot;Anisoptera costata&quot;. The provincial aquatic life is the sheatfish &quot;Ompok bimaculatus&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into nine districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). The districts are further subdivided into 78 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 885 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Yasothon Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 24 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Yasothon has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 23 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 63 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

== Transport ==
Yasothon city is about from Bangkok at the intersection of Routes 23 and 202, and the south end of Route 2169. Several bus lines connect the province at frequent intervals to Bangkok&#x27;s Northern Bus Terminal (, ), as well as all bus terminals in the north and northeast. Ubon Ratchathani province is 100 kilometres east on Route 23.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at the provincial level using the Human Achievement Index (HAI), a composite index covering eight key areas of human development. The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<text>Zellig Sabbettai Harris (; October 23, 1909 – May 22, 1992) was an influential American linguist, mathematical syntactician, and methodologist of science. Originally a Semiticist, he is best known for his work in structural linguistics and discourse analysis and for the discovery of transformational structure in language. These developments from the first 10 years of his career were published within the first 25. His contributions in the subsequent 35 years of his career include transfer grammar, string analysis (adjunction grammar), elementary sentence-differences (and decomposition lattices), algebraic structures in language, operator grammar, sublanguage grammar, a theory of linguistic information, and a principled account of the nature and origin of language.

==Biography==
Harris was born on October 23, 1909, in Balta, in the Podolia Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine). He was Jewish. In 1913 when he was four years old his family immigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At age 13, at his request, he was sent to live in Palestine, where he worked to support himself, and for the rest of his life he returned frequently to live on a socialist kibbutz in Israel. His brother, Dr Tzvi N. Harris, with his wife Shoshana, played a pivotal role in the understanding of the immune system and the development of modern immunology. His sister, Anna H. Live, was Director of the English Institute (for ESL students) at the University of Pennsylvania (now named the English Language Program). In 1941, he married the physicist Bruria Kaufman, who was Einstein&#x27;s assistant in the 1950s at Princeton. In the 1960s the couple established residence in kibbutz Mishmar Ha&#x27;Emek, in Israel, where they adopted their daughter, Tamar. From 1949 until his death, Harris maintained a close relationship with Naomi Sager, director of the Linguistic String Project at New York University. Their daughter, Eva Harris, is a professor of Infectious Diseases at the University of California, Berkeley.

Harris died in his sleep after a routine working day at the age of 82 on May 22, 1992, in New York.

==Linguistics==
From the outset of his early work in the 1930s, Harris was concerned with establishing the mathematical and empirical foundations of the science of language then emerging. He saw that one could not &#x27;explain&#x27; language (Saussure&#x27;s &quot;parole&quot;) by appeal to a priori principles or competencies (&quot;langue&quot;) for which language itself provides the sole evidence. &quot;The danger of using such undefined and intuitive criteria as pattern, symbol, and logical a prioris, is that linguistics is precisely the one empirical field which may enable us to derive definitions of these intuitive fundamental relationships out of correlations of observable phenomena.&quot;

===Early career and influences===
Harris received his bachelor&#x27;s (1930), master&#x27;s (1932), and doctoral (1934) degrees in the Oriental Studies department of the University of Pennsylvania. Although his first direction was as a Semiticist, with publications on Ugaritic, Phoenician, and Canaanite, and on the origins of the alphabet; and later on Hebrew, both classical and modern, he began teaching linguistic analysis at Penn in 1931. His increasingly comprehensive approach saw practical application as part of the war effort in the 1940s. In 19461947 he formally established what is said to be the first modern linguistics department in the United States.

Harris&#x27;s early publications brought him to the attention of Edward Sapir, who strongly influenced him and who came to regard him as his intellectual heir. Harris also greatly admired Leonard Bloomfield for his work and as a person. He did not formally study with either.

===Relation to &quot;Bloomfieldian&quot; structuralism===

It is widely believed that Harris carried Bloomfieldian ideas of linguistic description to their extreme development: the investigation of discovery procedures for phonemes and morphemes, based on the distributional properties of these units and of antecedent phonetic elements. His &quot;Methods in Structural Linguistics&quot; (1951) is the definitive formulation of descriptive structural work as he had developed it up to about 1945. This book made him famous, but generativists have sometimes interpreted it as a synthesis of a &quot;neo-Bloomfieldian school&quot; of structuralism.

Rather, Harris viewed his work as articulating methods for verifying that results, however reached, are validly derived from the data of language. This was in line with virtually all serious views of science at the time; Harris&#x27;s methods corresponded to what Hans Reichenbach called &quot;the context of justification,&quot; as distinct from &quot;the context of discovery.&quot; He had no sympathy for the view that to be scientific a linguistic analyst must progress by stepwise discovery from phonetics, to phonemics, to morphology, and so on, without &quot;mixing levels.&quot;

Fundamental to this approach, and, indeed, making it possible, is Harris&#x27;s recognition that phonemic contrast cannot be derived from distributional analysis of phonetic notations but rather that the fundamental data of linguistics are speakers&#x27; judgments of phonemic contrast. He developed and clarified methods of controlled experiment employing substitution tests, such as the pair test (Harris 1951:32) in which informants distinguish repetition from contrast. It is probably accurate to say that phonetic data are regarded as fundamental in all other approaches to linguistics. For example, Chomsky (1964:78) &quot;assume[s] that each utterance of any language can be uniquely represented as a sequence of phones, each of which can be regarded as an abbreviation for a set of features&quot;. Recognizing the primacy of speaker perceptions of contrast enabled remarkable flexibility and creativity in Harris&#x27;s linguistic analyses which others - without that improved foundation - labelled &quot;game playing&quot; and &quot;hocus-pocus.&quot;

Henry Hoenigswald tells us that in the
late 1940s and the 1950s Harris was viewed by his colleagues as a person exploring the consequences of pushing methodological principles right to the edge. As a close co-worker put it

Zellig Harris&#x27;s work in linguistics placed great emphasis on methods of analysis. His theoretical results were the product of prodigious amounts of work on the data of language, in which the economy of description was a major criterion. He kept the introduction of constructs to the minimum necessary to bring together the elements of description into a system. His own role, he said, was simply to be the agent in bringing data in relation to data. ... But it was not false modesty that made Harris downplay his particular role in bringing about results, so much as a fundamental belief in the objectivity of the methods employed. Language could only be described in terms of the placings of words next to words. There was nothing else, no external metalanguage. The question was how these placings worked themselves into a vehicle for carrying the &#x27;semantic burden&#x27; of language. ... His commitment to methods was such that it would be fair to say that the methods were the leader and he the follower. His genius was to see at various crucial points where the methods were leading and to do the analytic work that was necessary to bring them to a new result.
This, then, is an extension and refinement of the distributional methodology pioneered by Sapir and Bloomfield, investigating which elements of a language can co-occur and which cannot. Given a representation in which contrasting utterances (non-repetitions) are written differently, even a conventional alphabetic orthography, stochastic procedures amenable to statistical learning theory identify the boundaries of words and morphemes.

 In practice, of course, linguists identify words and morphemes by a variety of intuitive and heuristic means. These again are substitution tests. Given words and morphemes, the general method is experimental as follows: substitute one element in a string of such elements, the others in its context being held constant, and then test the acceptability of the new combination, either by finding it in a corpus or by testing its acceptability by users of the language.

Harris&#x27;s experimental distributional methodology is thus grounded in the subjective judgments of language users: judgments as to repetition vs. imitation, yielding the fundamental data of phonemic contrast, and judgments as to acceptability. Substitution tests using these judgments as criteria identify the &quot;departures from randomness&quot; that enable language to carry information. This is in contrast to the commonly held view that Harris, like Bloomfield, rejected mentalism and espoused behaviorism.

===Major contributions in the 1940s===
Harris&#x27;s contributions to linguistics as of about 1945 as summarized in &quot;Methods in Structural Linguistics&quot; (Harris 1951) include componential analysis of long components in phonology, componential analysis of morphology, discontinuous morphemes, and a substitution-grammar of word- and phrase-expansions that is related to immediate-constituent analysis, but without its limitations. With its manuscript date of January 1946, the book has been recognized as including the first formulation of the notion of a generative grammar.

The overriding aim of the book, and the import of the word &quot;methods&quot; in its original title, is a detailed specification of validation criteria for linguistic analysis. These criteria lend themselves to differing forms of presentation that have sometimes been taken as competing. Harris showed how they are complementary. (An analogy may be drawn to intersecting parameters in optimality theory.) &quot;It is not that grammar is one or another of these analyses, but that sentences exhibit simultaneously all of these properties.&quot; Harris&#x27;s treatment of these as tools of analysis rather than theories of language, and his way of using them to work toward an optimal presentation for this purpose or that, contributed to the perception that he was engaged in &quot;hocus-pocus&quot; with no expectation that there was any absolute truth to the matter.

Harris&#x27;s central methodological concern beginning with his earliest publications was to avoid obscuring the essential characteristics of language behind unacknowledged presuppositions, such as are inherent in conventions of notation or presentation. In this vein, among his most illuminating works in the 1940s are restatements of analyses by other linguists, done with the intention of displaying properties of the linguistic phenomena which are invariant across diverse representations This anticipates later work on linguistic universals. Also very relevant here is his work on transfer grammar, which presents the intersection of the grammars of two languages, clarifying precisely those features in which they differ and the relation between corresponding such features. This has obvious benefits for machine translation.

===Metalanguage and notational systems===

The basis of this methodological concern was that unacknowledged presuppositions, such as are inherent in conventions of notation or presentation, are dependent upon prior knowledge of and use of language. Since the object of investigation is language itself, properties of language cannot be presupposed without question-begging. &quot;We cannot describe the structure of natural language in some other kind of system, for any system in which we could identify the elements and meanings of a given language would have to have already the same essential structure of words and sentences as the language to be described.&quot; &quot;[W]e cannot in general impose our own categories of information upon language. ... We cannot determine in an &#x27;a priori&#x27; way the &#x27;logical form&#x27; of all sentences ... &quot;, etc.

Natural language demonstrably contains its own metalanguages, in which we talk about language itself. Any other means for talking about language, such as logical notations, depends upon our prior shared &#x27;common parlance&#x27; for our learning and interpreting it. To describe language, or to write a grammar, we cannot rely upon metalinguistic resources outside of the intrinsic metalinguistic resources within language, &quot;for any system in which we could identify the elements and meanings of a given language would have to have already the same essential structure of words and sentences as the language to be described.&quot; &quot;There is no way to define or describe the language and its occurrences except in such statements said in that same language or in another natural language. Even if the grammar of a language is stated largely in symbols, those symbols will have to be defined ultimately in a natural language.&quot;

From this observation there followed Harris&#x27;s conclusion that a science that aims to determine the nature of language is limited to investigation of the relationships of the elements of language to one another (their distribution). Indeed, beginning with the fundamental data of linguistics, the phonemic contrasts, all the elements are defined relative to one another.

Any metalinguistic notions, representations, or notational conventions that are not stateable in metalanguage assertions of the language itself import complexity that is not intrinsic to language, obscuring its true character. Because of this, Harris strove for a &#x27;least grammar&#x27;. &quot;The reason for this demand is that every entity and rule, and every complexity and restriction of domains of a rule, states a departure from randomness in the language being described. Since what we have to describe is the restriction on combinations in the language, the description should not add restrictions of its own.&quot;

The hypothesis of Universal Grammar (UG) amounts to the contrary proposal that (some) metalinguistic resources for language are in fact &quot;a priori&quot;, prior to and external to language, as part of the genetic inheritance of humans. Insofar as the only evidence for properties of UG are in language itself, Harris&#x27;s view was that such properties cannot be presupposed, but they may be sought once a principled theory of language is established on a purely linguistic basis.

===Linguistics as applied mathematics===
Deriving from this insight, Harris&#x27;s aim was to apply the tools of mathematics to the data of language and establish the foundations of a science of language. &quot;[The] problem of &quot;the foundations of mathematics&quot; was more topical than ever just at the time when Harris took charge of the &#x27;homologous&#x27; enterprise of establishing linguistics on a clear basis.&quot; &quot;We see here then nearly fifty years during which, to realize the program that he established very early, Zellig Harris searched and found in mathematics some of his supports. This merits closer attention, and it is doubtless advisable to consider it without shutting it into the reductive box of &#x27;possible applications of mathematics to linguistics.&#x27; Is not the question rather &#x27;how could a little mathematics transmute itself into linguistics?&#x27;&quot; He contrasted this with attempts by others to project the properties of language from formal language-like systems. &quot;The interest ... is not in investigating a mathematically definable system which has some relation to language, as being a generalization or a subset of it, but in formulating as a mathematical system all the properties and relations necessary and sufficient for the whole of natural language.&quot;

===Transformational structure in language===
As early as 1939, Harris began teaching his students about linguistic transformations. They had immediate utility to enhance the regularity of repetition patterns in texts (discourse analysis). By 1946 he had already done extensive transformational analysis in diverse languages such as Kota, Hidatsa, and Cherokee, and Hebrew (ancient and modern) as well as English, but he did not feel this was ready for publication until his &quot;Culture and Style&quot; and &quot;Discourse Analysis&quot; papers in 1952. A later series of papers beginning with &quot;Co-occurrence and Transformations in Linguistic Structure&quot; (1957) developed a more general theory of syntax.

Harris argued, following Sapir and Bloomfield, that semantics is included in grammar, not separate from it, form and information being two faces of the same coin. A particular application of the concern about presuppositions and metalanguage, noted above, is that any specification of semantics other than that which is immanent in language can only be stated in a metalanguage external to language (which would call for its own syntactic description and semantic interpretation).

Prior to Harris&#x27;s discovery of transformations, grammar as so far developed could not yet address individual word combinations, but only word classes. A sequence or &quot;n&quot;tuple of word classes (plus invariant morphemes, termed &quot;constants&quot;) specifies a subset of sentences that are formally alike. Harris investigated mappings from one such subset to another in the set of sentences. In linear algebra, a mapping that preserves a specified property is called a transformation, and that is the sense in which Harris introduced the term into linguistics. Harris&#x27;s transformational analysis refined the word classes found in the 1946 &quot;From Morpheme to Utterance&quot; grammar of expansions. By recursively defining semantically more and more specific subclasses according to the combinatorial privileges of words, one may progressively approximate a grammar of individual word combinations.

One form in which this is exemplified is in the lexicon-grammar work of Maurice Gross and his colleagues 

This relation of progressive refinement was subsequently shown in a more direct and straightforward way in a grammar of substring combinability resulting from string analysis (Harris 1962).

Noam Chomsky was Harris&#x27;s student, beginning as an undergraduate in 1946. Rather than taking transformations in the algebraic sense of mappings from subset to subset, preserving inter-word restrictions, Chomsky adapted the notion of &quot;rules of transformation&quot; vs. &quot;rules of formation&quot; from mathematical logic. The terms originated with Rudolf Carnap. He was also introduced to the symbol-rewriting rules of Post production systems invented some years earlier by Emil Post. Their capacity to generate language-like formal systems was beginning to be employed in the design of computing machines, such as ENIAC, which was announced at Penn with great fanfare as a &quot;giant brain&quot; in 1946. Chomsky employed rewrite rules as a notation for presentation of immediate-constituent analysis. He called this phrase structure grammar (PSG). He set about to restate Harris&#x27;s transformations as operations mapping one phrase-structure tree to another. In his conception, PSG provided the rules of formation which were &#x27;enriched′ by his rules of transformation. This led later to his redefinition of transformations as operations mapping an abstract deep structure into a surface structure. This very different notion of transformation creates a complex hierarchy of abstract structure which under Harris&#x27;s original definition was neither necessary nor desirable. Inter-word dependencies suffice to determine transformations (mappings in the set of sentences), and many generalizations that seem of importance in the various theories employing abstract syntax trees, such as island phenomena, fall out naturally from Harris&#x27;s analysis with no special explanation needed.

&quot;In practice, linguists take unnumbered short cuts and intuitive or heuristic guess, and keep many problems about a particular language before them at the same time&quot;. Early work on transformations used paraphrase as a heuristic, but in keeping with the methodological principles noted above in the section on metalanguage issues and earlier, there is also a formal criterion for transformational analysis. In the 1957 &quot;Co-Occurrence and Transformation&quot; paper this criterion was that inter-word co-occurrence restrictions should be preserved under the mapping; that is, if two sentence-forms are transforms, then acceptable word choices for one also obtain for the other. Even while the 1957 publication was in press it was clear that preservation of word co-occurrence could not resolve certain problems, and in the 1965 &quot;Transformational Theory&quot; this criterion was refined, so that if a difference of acceptability is found between a pair of sentences that satisfy one sentence-form, the corresponding satisfiers of the other sentence-form are likewise differentiated (though in some contexts, e.g. under &quot;I imagined&quot; or &quot;I dreamt&quot;, acceptability-differences may be collapsed). These acceptability gradings may also be expressed as ranges of contexts in which the word choices are fully acceptable, a formulation which leads naturally to sublanguage grammar (below).

===Operator grammar===
Harris factored the set of transformations into elementary sentence-differences, which could then be employed as operations in generative processes for decomposing or synthesizing sentences. These are of two kinds, the incremental operations which add words, and the paraphrastic operations which change the phonemic shapes of words. The latter, Harris termed &quot;extended morphophonemics&quot;. This led to a partition of the set of sentences into two sublanguages: an informationally complete sublanguage with neither ambiguity nor paraphrase, vs. the set of its more conventional and usable paraphrases (&quot;The Two Systems of Grammar: Report and Paraphrase&quot; 1969). In the paraphrastic set, morphemes may be present in reduced form, even reduced to zero; their fully explicit forms are recoverable by undoing deformations and reductions of phonemic shape.

Thence, in a parallel to the generalization of linear algebra to operator theory in mathematics, he developed Operator Grammar. Here at last is a grammar of the entry of individual words into the construction of a sentence. When the entry of an operator word on its argument places words in the relationship to one another that a given reduction requires, it may be carried out. (The reductions are rarely obligatory). Operator entry is trivial to formalize. It resembles predicate calculus, and has affinities with Categorial Grammar, but these are findings after the fact which did not guide its development or the research that led to it. Recent work by Stephen Johnson on formalization of operator grammar adapts the &quot;lexicon grammar&quot; of Maurice Gross for the complex detail of the reductions.

===Sublanguage and linguistic information===
In his work on sublanguage analysis, Harris showed how the sublanguage for a restricted domain can have a pre-existent external metalanguage, expressed in sentences in the language but outside of the sublanguage, something that is not available to language as a whole. In the language as a whole, restrictions on operator-argument combinability can only be specified in terms of relative acceptability, and it is difficult to rule out any satisfier of an attested sentence-form as nonsense, but in technical domains, especially in sublanguages of science, metalanguage definitions of terms and relations restrict word combinability, and the correlation of form with meaning becomes quite sharp. It is perhaps of interest that the test and exemplification of this in &quot;The Form of Information in Science&quot; (1989) vindicates in some degree the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. It also expresses Harris&#x27;s lifelong interest in the further evolution or refinement of language in context of problems of social amelioration (e.g., &quot;A Language for International Cooperation&quot; [1962], &quot;Scientific Sublanguages and the Prospects for a Global Language of Science&quot; [1988]), and in possible future developments of language beyond its present capacities.

Harris&#x27;s linguistic work culminated in the companion books &quot;A Grammar of English on Mathematical Principles&quot; (1982) and &quot;A Theory of Language and Information&quot; (1991). Mathematical information theory concerns only quantity of information, or, more exactly, the efficiency of communication channels; here for the first time is a theory of information content. In the latter work, also, Harris ventured to propose at last what might be the &quot;truth of the matter&quot; about the nature of language, what is required to learn it, its origin, and its possible future development. His discoveries vindicate Sapir&#x27;s recognition, long disregarded, that language is pre-eminently a social artifact, the users of which collectively create and re-create it in the course of using it.

=== Honors ===
For his work, Harris was an elected member of the American Philosophical Society (1962), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1965), and the United States National Academy of Sciences (1973).

===Legacy===
The influence of Harris&#x27;s work is pervasive in linguistics, often invisibly. Diverse lines of research that Harris opened continue to be developed by others, as indicated by contributions to (Nevin 2002a, 2002b). The Medical Language Processor developed by Naomi Sager and others in the Linguistic String Program in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (NYU) has been made available on SourceForge. Richard Kittredge and his colleagues have developed systems for automatic generation of text from data, which are used for weather radio broadcasts and for production of reportage of stock market activity, sports results, and the like. Work on information retrieval has been influential in development of the Lexis-Nexis systems and elsewhere.

Recent work on Statistical semantics, in particular Distributional semantics and Large language models, is based on the Distributional hypothesis, and explicitly acknowledges the influence of Harris&#x27;s work on distributional structure.

Harris&#x27;s students in linguistics include, among many others, Joseph Applegate, Ernest Bender, Noam Chomsky, William Evan, Lila R. Gleitman, Michael Gottfried, Maurice Gross, James Higginbotham, Stephen B. Johnson, Aravind Joshi, Michael Kac, Edward Keenan, Daythal Kendall, Richard Kittredge, James A. Loriot/Lauriault, Leigh Lisker, Fred Lukoff, Paul Mattick Jr., James Munz, Bruce E. Nevin, Jean-Pierre Paillet, Thomas Pynchon, Ellen Prince, John R. Ross, Naomi Sager, Morris Salkoff, Thomas A. Ryckman, and William C. Watt.

==Politics==
Harris was also influential with many students and colleagues, though in a less public way, in work on the amelioration of social and political arrangements. He was committed all his life to radical transformation of society, but from the ground up rather than by revolution directed from the top down. His last book — &quot;The Transformation of Capitalist Society&quot; — summarizing his beliefs, was published posthumously. In it, he claims that capitalism abandons those personal and social needs which are unprofitable, that cooperative arrangements arise for meeting those needs, that participants in these niches gain experience in forms of mutual aid which are crucial to survival in &#x27;primitive&#x27; societies but which have been suppressed where they are inconvenient for the requirements of capitalist and that these should be fostered as seed points from which a more humane successor to capitalism can arise. He states that these are unnoticed and disregarded by functionaries of capitalism, much as capitalism developed from mercantilism in the midst of feudalism. This book, whose manuscript Harris had titled &quot;Directing Social Change,’’ was brought to publication in 1997 by Seymour Melman, Murray Eden, and Bill Evan. Some of Harris’s unpublished writings on politics are in a collection at the Van Pelt Library of the University of Pennsylvania and a collection at the American Philosophical Society (call number Mss.Ms.Coll.183).

From his undergraduate days he was active in a student left-Zionist organization called Avukah (Hebrew &quot;Torch&quot;). He resigned as its national President in 1936, the year he obtained the Ph.D., but continued in a leadership advisory role until, like many other student organizations in the war years, it fell apart in 1943. From the early 1940s he and an informal group of fellow scientists in diverse fields collaborated on an extensive project called &quot;A Frame of Reference for Social Change.&quot; They developed new concepts and vocabulary on grounds that the existing ones of economics and sociology presuppose and thereby covertly perpetuate capitalist constructs, and that it is necessary to &#x27;unfool&#x27; oneself before proceeding. This was submitted to Victor Gollancz, a notoriously interventionist editor, who demanded a complete rewrite in more familiar terms.

<doc id="300100" wikidata="Q7375105" url="?curid=300100" title="Royalist attack on Chaves">
<text>The attack on Chaves, which occurred on 8 July, 1912, was a military action performed by supporters of the monarchy of Portugal in opposition to the Portuguese First Republic, which had been proclaimed two years prior.

The attack was led by Henrique Paiva Couceiro, who had campaigned in Africa and who became the leader of the royalists. The royalists were discreetly armed by the Spanish king, Alfonso XIII, and concentrated their forces in Galicia, Spain.

The attack ended with a defeat for the royalist forces.

==First incursion (3 October 1911)==
Couceiro undertook the first incursion in 1911 with about 1,000 men, who formed groups of 60-70 men. They left the town of Verín, 12 kilometers from the northern border with Spain, and marched towards the border. Most of the men were from the region of Trás-os-Montes and were from a diverse array of social classes and skills. There were more than 100 priests in the group. In terms of military equipment, there were only 400 ancient rifles, a few Winchester rifles, and Mauser Pocket Pistols adapted to rifles, to which were added a score of semi-automatic pistols, daggers, and swords. The 1,000 men crossed the border after a long march in the mountainous region between Bragança and Vinhais, near the present-day Montesinhos National Park.

The republican garrison in Bragança waited for an attack that never came. 
This is because the royalists changed their plans and now marched on Vinhais, which had a smaller garrison of men— only eighty infantry, cavalry, and border guards.

These forces from Vinhais left the small town and concentrated on a hill nearby. Negotiations were begun but the military commander of Vinhais refused to join or to surrender. He gave Paiva Couceiro two hours to abandon Portuguese territory.
Meanwhile, the Vinhais commander sent messengers to Chaves and Bragança asking for reinforcements. When daylight came and he saw the large group of royalists camped nearby, he knew that he would have to retreat and he did so. The royalists then occupied Vinhais. They hoisted the white-and-blue flag of the monarchy and proclaimed the end of the Republic. Priests of neighboring villages and a band of villagers cheered them on and used the Republican flag for target practice.

However, the royalists, who were expecting a general uprising, did not receive the support they were expecting. On the nearby mountain, Republican troops remained and at any moment Republican reinforcements were expected to arrive from Chaves. Thus, the royalists abandoned Vinhais, and headed for the border. The republican garrison from Vinhais meanwhile retreated towards Chaves, where they met the troops coming in their support. When they arrived in Vinhais the royalists had already left. Crossing the rugged mountains north of Vinhais, and reduced to about 600 men after desertions, the rebels made their way back into Spain. The companies that still remained formed nine groups, some staying near Xinzo de Limia and Ourense, but the bulk of the column concentrated nearer the border in Verín.

==The attack on Chaves (8 July 1912)==

After a hard winter in exile, the refugees were eager to fight again. In February Paiva Couceiro joined them in Galicia. It was hoped that the towns in the north, now more than ever, would come over to their side. They now had more men and materials. The original plan was to cross the mountains of the Barroso, west of Chaves, and link up with followers of a pro-monarchist priest in Cabeceiras de Basto.

The army was divided into three groups. One tried to capture the fortress of Valença do Minho across from Spanish Tui. This endeavor ended in a resounding defeat and retreat back into Galicia. The second group, of 200 men, was to enter Portugal via Vila Verde da Raia and create a diversion for Couceiro’s larger plan.

The third group, composed of 450 men was the main column, commanded by Paiva Couceiro. This larger group crossed the border near a small village called Sendin, north of Montalegre. 23 soldiers and some customs police defended the town. Alerting Chaves to the danger, these men from Sendin retreated to a nearby hill south of the town. Chaves was convinced that Couceiro would attack Montalegre and head south towards Cabeceiras de Basto.

The rebels raised camp at dawn and moved east towards Chaves. In Padornelos a few people came out to greet them and offer their allegiance to the king and to the Catholic Church. Vilar de Perdizes was the next village, where the priest knelt to kiss Paiva Couceiro’s feet.

Meanwhile, the military commander in Chaves, Augusto Ribeiro de Carvalho, not knowing of Paiva Couceiro’s move across the north, had decided to send the main part of his forces with machine guns towards Montalegre to stop the royalists’ passage to the south. Another group of 100 men was sent to the border to resist a possible incursion from the small group of Royalists that were in Feces, across from Vila Verde.

On the morning of July 8, the rebels appeared just outside Chaves. No one had expected this attack, since the last news had the rebels just outside Montalegre. The people of Chaves had not even paid attention to the warnings brought by the customs guards who had fled the northern villages.

Chaves then came under attack. Augusto Ribeiro de Carvalho hurried to recall the troops that he had sent out a day earlier; however, he also had local support from the townspeople. 150 civilian volunteers from Chaves, trained briefly months earlier, hurried to help the authorities against the royalists. The regular soldiers numbered around 100. The battle was one of scattered firing with small arms and casualties were light. The rebels could not penetrate the defenses, nor could the garrison venture out to attack them.

Meanwhile, the rebel group on the border, in Feces, had remained in its position, until they could hear the sounds of gunfire coming from Chaves. They crossed the border and managed to raise the royalist flag over the customs house. The small detachment of regular troops meanwhile moved south to take up a better position. This group of rebels, nevertheless, never made it past the border.

After a lull in the fighting, the royalists opened fire on the town with their two artillery pieces. The town’s guns had been taken away to defend the road to Montalegre. However, the Chaves forces were supplemented by reinforcing regular forces, who set up their artillery on a hill called Alto da Forca, south of the town, from which they could fire at will on the royalists.

==Royalist defeat==
The royalists were unable to return fire, and this defeat resulted in a general celebration in Chaves. The streets filled with people, who were crying and laughing in each other’s arms. Paiva Couceiro’s forces suffered 30 dead. It is said that, near the border, a rebel soldier, not hiding his tears and rage, responded to someone who offered him a glass of wine: “Why do I want wine? What I only wanted was the Monarchy in Portugal.”

After the final dispersion of his men to Spain, Paiva Couceiro published a manifesto explaining his reasons for the defeat and proclaiming that his struggle was over.

==Tributes==
In honor of the republican victory, in Lisbon a street was given the name “Defenders of Chaves”, and in Porto another street was given the name “Heroes of Chaves.”

<text>Trajan&#x27;s Bridge () is a Roman bridge in the civil parish of Santa Maria Maior, in the municipality of Chaves in the Portuguese northern subregion of Terras de Trás-os-Montes.

==History==

The bridge was constructed at the end of the 1st century or beginning of the 2nd century, by engineers under the emperor Trajan. A commemorative column was erected in 104, referring to the bridge&#x27;s construction by Flavian locals, at their cost. the column, now known as the &quot;Padrão dos Povos&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Standard&quot;) was erected and dedicated by 10 &quot;civitas&quot; towards the Roman emperors Vespasian, Titus, the emperor&#x27;s Legatus Augusti and the procurator of the 7th Legion &quot;Gemina Felix&quot;.

The bridge was first depicted in the book of Duarte d&#x27;Armas in the 16th century, as seen from the eastern bank, showing 14 arches, interlinked by &quot;talhamares&quot; with guards, and on the northern bank some watermills. On 7 December 1514, the first foral (&quot;charter&quot;) was issued by King D. Manuel and included a representation of the bridge in its coat-of-arms.

In 1548, Spanish Cardinal Luís de Castro, while travelling to Santiago de Compostela, passed through Chaves. While there he copied the inscription on the column that he found in the vegetable gardens of Simão Guedes. Similarly, in 1572, Ambróis de Morales while traveling between the Spanish kingdoms encountered a column opposite the bridge, at the home of João Guedes (likely son or grandson of Simão Guedes), and also copied the inscription of the column.

From the end of the 16th century and 17th century, the standard was implanted in the north end of the bridge, then re-planted (after it fell), resulting in the break in the inscription. In 1711 or 1723, a study by Távora was completed, and the inscription copied and published in his &quot;Notícias&quot;. In 1738, Rodrigo de Sande Vasconcellos, an artillery lieutenant-colonel, ordered the columns removed, placing one in the military square and another as a marker, inscribing some letters that over time became less perceptible (from the reference in the 1758 &quot;Memórias Paroquiais&quot;).

As Antonio Rodríguez Colmenero indicated, Rodrigo de Sande had ordered not only the decorating of the existing columns, but also ordered the construction of two new twin columns, to be placed on the town-side of the bridge.

The 1 November 1755 earthquake caused minimal damage to the site. According to a report by António Manuel de Novais Mendonça (prior of Chaves) in the &quot;Memórias Paroquiais&quot;, dated 27 March 1758, the bridge included 12 arches (while at one time there were 18 arches) and &quot;large and excellent&quot; stone blocks. This marked the suburbs of Madalena up to Couraças and the bridge was 92 geometric steps long, 3 feet wide. A 1762 drawing of the bridge showed it with 12 arches in 1762, without any decoration and its two columns on the city side of the river.

In the 19th century, the column was located in the central part of the bridge, in front of the commemorative marker. On 6 December 1878, the king suggested an enlargement of the bridge. There is an 1880 inscription in the oval cartouche, quoting the last time it was remodelled, the pillar construction and the placement of the commemorative marker. It was likely at this point that there stone guards for grates in iron.

At the time of the establishment of the Portuguese Republic, the two end columns were decorated, one with the Portuguese royal coat-of-arms and crown, and the other with fleuron, later placed in the Museum of Chaves. In September 1913, João Francisco Alves Carneiro de Lamadarcos was given permission to construct a metallic passageway over the bridge and the first floor of his house, part of the Hotel Comércio.

On 26 February 1914, the District Director of Public Works deliberated on the repair of the bridge&#x27;s staircase, which was in an advanced state of ruin. Approval was granted on 16 March to proceed with repairs.

During the 1940s, the city council constructed a long, narrow wall along the right margin of the river, resulting in the suffocating of four more arches, in addition to four already covered on the right and two others on the left margin, buried under premises. These four arches were already cut, following the earthenworks completed by the &quot;Junta Autónoma de Hidráulica Agrícola&quot;, while the other four were occupied by warehouses, which by 1942 were being used for local commercial establishments.

In 1956, a desilting project was begun along the length of the Tâmega River by the &quot;Direcção Hidráulica&quot; (&quot;Hydraulic Directorate&quot;) at a cost of 249.989$00, which included the construction of new accesses to the bridge. The &quot;Direcção-Geral dos Serviços Hidráulicos&quot; (&quot;Directorate-General for Hydraulic Services&quot;) on 22 August 1959 referred to the need to desilt the river and of expanding the width of the river. Following from this analysis, a commission was created to study the matter further by the DGSU, with representation by various institutions and municipal bodies. A new project was devised to enlarge the river, thereby alleviating three arches and desilting the river banks, while also allowing for improvement of the weir of Poldras, protection of the riverbank and burying the old mouth of the Rivelas river. The project was approved on 4 July 1961, by the ministry.

A project to improve the riverbank along the Tâmega River was initiated in 1962, in a phased approach, concluding in 1964. During the course of this project, various excavations were undertaken along the river, unearthing damage to the footings of 7 pillars of the 8 arches. The excavations also unearthed vestiges of the old stonework that had existed on the bridge before the construction of the lane way between Braga and Astorga.

In 1967, work to the footings was undertaken by the &quot;Comissão Regional de Turismo de Chaves&quot; (&quot;Chaves Regional Commission of Tourism&quot;), along with clearing of vegetation along the riverbanks and painting of the iron grating.

In the summer of 1980, during the dredging of the river, workers discovered a bulk of the bridge nearby and a cylindrical column, similar to the &quot;Padrão dos Povos&quot;. The epigraphic differences in the column and the wear made reading the complete text difficult, owing to the erosion caused by being submerged in the water.

On 1 June 1992, the bridge was placed under the responsibility of the &quot;Instituto Português do Património Arquitetónico&quot; (&quot;Portuguese Institute of Architectural Patrimony&quot;), by Decree 106F/92 (Diário da República, Série 1A, 126).

In 2001, of Roman pavement stone was discovered in the riverbank of the local neighborhood of Madalena. These large slabs served as an oblique ramp. This path was used in the dry season, at the beginning of the 20th century, by farmers crossing the river to cool their animals and wagon wheels.

The bridge was illuminated from 1970. A study that included the protection zones for the walls, keep tower, bastion, Fort of &quot;São Francisco&quot; and Trajan bridge was begun in 1972. The &quot;Comissão Administrativa da Câmara&quot; (&quot;Administrative Commission&quot;) requested intervention to desilt the river in 1974. During the sequence of this petition, the &quot;Direcção-Geral dos Serviços Hidráulicos&quot; proposed unobstructing the river, resulting in a project to remodel the drainage system and sewage treatment station. It was at this time that the municipal government began working on the bridge, without the approval or intervention of the IPPC or DGEMN. Between 1981 and 1982, there were works to consolidate the talhamares and removal of their slabs. The IPPAR began clearing the cracks and improving the illumination.

In 2001, the Chaves city council began archeological prospecting during the remodelling work in the historic centre of Chaves.

Under the &quot;Polis&quot; program, in 2008, there was work to repair and improve the bridge, along with improving the riverbanks near the bridge.

==Architecture==
The bridge is situated over the Tâmega River, integrated into the urban space, addorsed on the left margin along the barrio of Madalena. On the right margin, are 4 arches on the riverbank, constructed in the middle of the 20th century, with western staircase. Over the four arches is a metallic laneway between the buildings constructed in the east.

The flattop bridge is long, with face of regular padding over 16 visible arches and cushioned staves.

The two arches are on the left margin, next to the barrio of Madalena, are higher than the others and four on the right bank are covered by warehouses, torn by slatted rectangular openings. Upstream, the bridge is enhanced by eight slightly-staggered prismatic talhamares, of substantially different size and height. Each structure, its ashlar stones serve as the fulcrum arches, while others appear only to addorse the bridge structure.

Halfway between the sixth and seventh arch there are (both on the upstream and downstream) an advanced semicircular pillar structure (oval masonry cartouche), inscribed with the date 1880. On the floor is a limited cornice, on which stand two cylindrical, monolithic landmarks, designated amount &quot;Padrão dos Povos&quot;, that celebrates the construction of the bridge. Between the fourth and fifth arches, instead of a talhamare, there is another semicircular pillar composed of two staggered bodies, both finished in cornice. Meanwhile, in the sixth talhamare is another pillar of the same size. The bridge flattop is covered in parallel slabs of granite, with lateral laneways in cement. Outwardly the bridge structure is marked by stone cornice and with regular intervals there are semi-circular gargoyles to drain water, in regular intervals. The feature also includes an iron grate.

The &quot;Padrão dos Povos&quot; has the following inscription:
: IMP(eratori) CAES(ari) VE[SP(asiano) AVG(vsto) PONT(ifici)] / MAX(imo) TRIB(unicia) POT(estate) [XX P(atri) P(atriae) CO(n)S(uli) IX] / IMP(eratori) VESP(asiano) CAES(ari) AV[G(usti) F(ilio) PONT(ifici) TRIB(unicia) POT(estate)] / VIII IMP(eratori) XIIII CO(n)[S(uli) VI / [...] / C(aio) CALPETANO RA[NTIO QVIRINALI] / VAL(erio) FESTO LEG(ato) A[VG(usti) PR(o) PR(aetore)] / D(ecio) CORNELIO MA[ECIANO LEG(ato) AVG(usti)] / L(ucio) ARRVNTIO MAX[IMO PROC(uratori) AVG(usti)] / LEG(ioni) VII GEM(inae) [FEL(ici)] / CIVITATES [X] AQVIFLAVIEN[SES AOBRIGENS(es)] / BIBALI COEL[ERNI EQVAESI] / INTERAMIC[I LIMICI NAEBISOCI] / QVARQVE[R]NI TA[MAGANI]

Father of the fatherland, Consul nine times and son of Emperor Vespasian Caesar Augustus, Pontifex, exercising the Tribunal Power eight times, Emperor 14 times, Consul six... legatus Augusti pro praetore Gaius Calpetanus Rantius Quirinalis Valerius Festus, legatus Augusti Decius Cornelius Mecianus, procurator Augusti of the Legion VII Gemina Felix Lucius Arruntius Maximus, along with ten more nations, the Aquaflaviensis, Aobrigenses, Biballi, Coelerni, Equaesi, Interamici, Limici, Naebisoci, Quaquerni, Tamagani.

The commemorative column has the following inscription: 
: IMP(eratori) CAES(ari) NERVA / TRAIANO AVG(usto) GER(manico) / DACICO PONT(ifici) MAX(imo) / TRIB(unitia) POT(estate) CO(n)S(ule) V P(atri) P(atriae) / AQVIFLAVIENSES / PONTEM LAPIDEVM / DE SVO F(aciendum) C(uravit)

: Emperor Cesar Nerva Trajan Augustus Germanicus, Dacicus, Pontifex maximus, with tribunicia potestas, consul 15 times, father of the fatherland; the people of Aquae Flaviae raised this bridge at their own cost.

<text>The ancient Romans were the first civilization to build large, permanent bridges. Early Roman bridges used techniques introduced by Etruscan immigrants, but the Romans improved those skills, developing and enhancing methods such as arches and keystones. There were three major types of Roman bridge: wooden, pontoon, and stone. Early Roman bridges were wooden, but by the 2nd century BC stone was being used. Stone bridges used the arch as their basic structure, and most used concrete, the first use of this material in bridge-building.

== History ==

Following the conquests of Tarquinius Priscus, Etruscan engineers migrated to Rome, bringing with them their knowledge of bridge-building techniques. The oldest bridge in ancient Rome was the Pons Sublicius. It was built in the 6th century BC by Ancus Marcius over the Tiber River. The Romans improved on Etruscan architectural techniques. They developed the voussoir, stronger keystones, vaults, and superior arched bridges. Roman arched bridges were capable of withstanding more stress by dispersing forces across bridges. Many Roman bridges had semicircular arches, but a few were segmental, i.e. with an arc of less than 180 degrees. 
By the 2nd century BC, the Romans had further refined their bridge-building techniques, using stronger materials such as volcanic ash, lime and gypsum. Also, they began to use iron clamps to hold together bridges, constructing midstream arches, and pentagonal stones to allow for wider vaults. According to Canadian classicist John Peter Oleson, no known stone bridges existed in Italy before the 2nd century BC. This view is not supported unanimously: Spanish engineer Leonardo Fernández Troyano suggested that stone bridges have existed since Pre-Roman Italy. 

Between 150 and 50 BC, many stone Roman bridges were built, the Pons Aemilius being the first. Engineers began to use stone instead of wood to exemplify the &quot;Pax Romana&quot; and to construct longer-lasting bridges. These were the first large-scale bridges ever constructed. Bridges were constructed by the Roman government to serve the needs of the military and the empire&#x27;s administration. Sometimes roads and bridges were used for commercial purposes, but this was rare as boats better served the needs of the Roman economy.

By the 2nd century Roman techniques had declined, and they had been mostly lost by the 4th century. Some Roman bridges are still used today, such as the Pons Fabricius, and even after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, engineers copied their bridges. Roman bridge-building techniques persisted until the 18th century: for example, the prevalence of arches in bridges can be attributed to the Romans.

== Construction ==
=== Measurements ===

Roman bridges were much larger than the bridges of other civilizations. They could be anywhere from long. By the time of Augustus around the turn of the 1st millennium the maximum span of Roman bridges increased from around in 142 BC to . The Ponte Sant&#x27;Angelo, built during the reign of Hadrian, has five arches each with a span of . A bridge in Alcántara has piers wide, high, and arches with a span of . Another bridge over the Bibey River in Galicia has a pier wide, arches with a span, side arches, and an arch spanning . Wider spans increase the bridge&#x27;s drainage, reduce water pressure on the spandrels, and reduced the bridge&#x27;s weight. Trajan&#x27;s Bridge over the Danube featured open-spandrel segmental arches made of wood (standing on high concrete piers). This was to be the longest arch bridge for a thousand years both in terms of overall and individual span length. The longest extant Roman bridge is the Puente Romano at Mérida.

=== Stone bridges ===
Roman engineers would begin by laying a foundation for building bridges across moving bodies of water. At first, they used heavy timbers as pilings in the riverbed, but a later technique involved using watertight walls to redirect the water and then laying a stone foundation in the area. Work was exclusively done during the dry season to aid in constructing a foundation. This ensured as many piers as possible were accessible. There is some evidence that to construct bridges rivers were diverted. Trajan might have performed such a practice when constructing his Danube bridge. Roman engineers might have diverted rivers using rudimentary methods and tools. Sometimes dirt was added to the foundation. A bridge&#x27;s foundation could be built above or below water level. Building the bridge above water level resulted in a need for a wider span. Bridge&#x27;s tunnels and spandrels were designed to decrease the weight of the bridge and function as flood arches.
The Pons Aemilius probably had stone piers with wooden roadbeds and arches. They were rebuilt in stone in 142 BC and either extended from the abutments to the piers or vice versa. Throughout Roman history, brick or stone arches supported bridges&#x27; weight. Roman engineers built bridges with one long arch instead of several smaller ones. This practice made construction easier, as they only needed to build one arch on land, instead of many in water. Roman arches were semi-circular and used voussoirs with equal dimensions and conic sections with equal circumference. Later in Roman history arches started to become semi-circular. Sometimes arches were segmented, or not semicircular. The Romans invented this technique. Segmented arches allowed greater amounts of flood water to pass, preventing the bridge from being swept away and allowing it to be lighter. The Bridge near Limyra in southwestern Turkey has 26 segmental arches with an average span-to-rise ratio of 5.3:1, giving the bridge an unusually flat profile unsurpassed for more than a millennium. The late Roman Karamagara Bridge in Cappadocia in eastern Turkey may represent the earliest surviving bridge featuring a pointed arch. However, it is now submerged by the Keban Dam. Roman arches were unable to fit into the arch springings properly, forcing the base of the arches upwards. 

In the 2nd century, arches became thinner, and spandrels became flat and pierced with holes. They were constructed using a wooden frame to hold wedge-shaped blocks in place. Afterwards, the wooden frame was removed, but the weight of the keystone, the last block to be put in place, held it together. Bridges had abutments at each end and piers in the middle, these two design features carrying most of the bridge&#x27;s weight. Abutments could be constructed in the many arches of a bridge, allowing each to be built separately. Piers were usually twenty-six feet thick and framed with starlings. The Karamagara Bridge represents an early example of the use of pointed arches.

Roman piers were thick enough to support the pressure of an arch. Stone arches allowed bridges to have much longer spans. Usually, iron clamps covered in lead were used to build piers. Because of poor performance underwater, Roman piers were often destroyed over time. Bridges that survived to the modern day were often furnished with cut waters on the upstream side and a flat downstream face, though some bridges, such as a bridge in Chester, are exceptions.

Two niches carrying cornices were inserted between pilasters. They were then put above the framed starlings. Roman bridges had spandrels, between which images of dolphins were often inserted. They rarely had wide spans and thick piers with bow-shaped piers that used small openings to allow for the flow of water. During construction, cranes were used to move materials and lift heavy objects. Some bridges had aprons. They were used to surround piers. Usually, the aprons covered the area of the stream bed near the bridge.

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa used ashlar and bricks to cover the outside of bridges and concrete for footings and water channels. Ashlar was used because large amounts of wood were needed to cast the concrete. Travertine limestone and tuff were used to build Roman bridges, or they could be made of dry rubble or concrete. Often the building materials varied in smoothness, or rustication. Other bridges were made of bossed limestone combined with cornices, voussoirs and slabs. Sometimes bedrock, buttresses, and vaults were used to construct bridges. Bridges built in Iberia tended to have cylindrical vault geometry. In the first half of the 2nd century BC, blocks of stone held together with iron clamps were used to aid in the construction of bridges.

=== Brick bridges ===
Although Roman bricks were used to build many bridges, they were far more commonly used to build aqueducts. Bridges built from bricks were rare as bricks often failed to survive erosion. The brick bridges that were built were generally used by the military, and they used construction techniques called &quot;opus vittatum&quot; and &quot;opus mixtum&quot;, the latter alternating rows of bricks in &quot;opus reticulatum&quot;. Examples are bridges in Carmona, Palomas, Extremadura, and the Ponte della Chianche in Italy. One brick bridge in Ticino, Switzerland, has stone arches and brick spandrels. Bricks were sometimes used to create parts of bridges, such as vaults, piers with welding joints, and brick and mortar rubble.

=== Wooden bridges ===

Early Roman bridges were wooden, including one constructed by Apollodorus and the Pons Sublicius, the oldest bridge in ancient Rome, and they were probably common across northern Europe and the Tyrrhenian coast; however, because of their lack of durability few have survived to the modern day. These bridges were supported by wooden trestles spanned by horizontal timbers and reinforced with struts, and they were possibly cantilevered. In order to simplify the process of cutting trees, multiple shorter timbers were used. Wooden poles were driven into the ground, and flat pieces of timber laid across them to create a flat surface. 

Other early techniques used to build wooden bridges involved barges, sometimes they were moored side by side. Workmen would raise weights, sometimes by rope, then it would fall down onto the piles. This method of construction, called pile driving, was necessary for wooden bridges to properly function. Because this technique created cofferdams, which are enclosures build to pump water out of an area. The base for the foundation of the bridge would be put in this area. Cofferdams were constructed of many piles held together. It is possible the piles were interconnected, likely to improve positioning, waterproofness, or both. Cofferdams would have been sealed with packed clay. The cofferdams also needed to be consistently dry. In order to achieve this, engineers would use tools such as buckets to drain the water. Wooden bridges could be burned to stop an attacker, or dismantled quickly. For example, according to Livy, during a battle against the Sabines the Romans set one of their wooden bridges on fire, driving the enemy back. Other early wooden bridges used post and lintel construction.
=== Pontoon bridges ===

Pontoon bridges were built by laying boats from side to side across a river. During Julius Caesar&#x27;s campaign in Germany, he built bridges by driving wooden piles into the stream bed from floating platforms and fixing beams at right angles across them to create trestles. Trajan built another bridge supported by stone during the Dacian Wars. Roman engineers gradually developed new techniques to build bridges, such as oval-shaped bases and pierced bases to facilitate the movement of water. Many bridges would have marble reliefs or carvings, but these bridges were likely used exclusively by government officials because of the difficulty and expense of carving marble artwork.

== Typology ==

There were three major types of Roman bridges. These were wooden, pontoon, and stone bridges. A list of Roman bridges compiled by the engineer Colin O&#x27;Connor features 330 stone bridges for traffic, 34 timber bridges and 54 aqueduct bridges, a substantial number still standing and even used to carry vehicles. A more complete survey by the Italian scholar Vittorio Galliazzo found 931 Roman bridges, mostly of stone, in as many as 26 different countries (including former Yugoslavia; see right table). A segmental arch is an arch that is less than a semicircle. The Romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple-arch aqueducts, such as the Pont du Gard and Segovia Aqueduct. Their bridges often had flood openings in the piers, e.g. in the Pons Fabricius in Rome (62 BC), one of the world&#x27;s oldest major bridges still standing.

There were two main types of wooden bridge in Britain. Small timber bridges with girders, and large ones made of stone and wood. Throughout the rest of the Roman world, except for northern Europe, arched bridges made of stone were common. This was likely due to the climate and rivers of the regions. Rivers were much calmer and water levels were lower in the southern parts of the Empire. This ensured foundations were easy to construct. While in the northern parts it was much harder to lay down foundations due to the high water level, muddy water, and substantial waterflow.

== Location ==
== &quot;Opus pontis&quot; ==

The costs of building and repairing bridges, known as &quot;opus pontis&quot; (&quot;bridge work&quot;), were the responsibility of multiple local municipalities. Their shared costs prove Roman bridges belonged to the region overall, and not to any one town (or two, if on a border). The Alcántara Bridge in Lusitania, for example, was built at the expense of 12 local municipalities, whose names were added on an inscription. Later, in the Roman Empire, the local lords of the land had to pay tithes to the empire for &quot;opus pontis&quot;. The Anglo-Saxons continued this practice with &quot;bricg-geworc&quot;, a literal translation of &quot;opus pontis&quot;.

== Examples ==
Built in 142 BC, the Pons Aemilius, later named Ponte Rotto (broken bridge), is the oldest Roman stone bridge in Rome, with only one surviving arch and pier. However, evidence suggests only the abutment is original to the 2nd century BC while the arch and pier perhaps date to a reconstruction during the reign of Augustus (27 BC – 14 AD). The Pons Fabricius, built in 62 BC during the late Republic, is the oldest Roman bridge that is still intact and in use. The largest Roman bridge was Trajan&#x27;s Bridge over the lower Danube, constructed by Apollodorus of Damascus, which remained for over a millennium the longest bridge to have been built both in terms of overall and span length.

=== Large river bridging ===
Roman engineers built stone arch or stone pillar bridges over all major rivers of the Empire save two: the Euphrates, which lay at the frontier in the Roman–Persian Wars, and the Nile, the longest river in the world, which was bridged as late as 1902 by the British Old Aswan Dam. The largest rivers to be spanned by solid bridges by the Romans were the Danube and the Rhine, the two largest European rivers west of the Eurasian Steppe. The lower Danube was crossed by least two (Trajan&#x27;s Bridge, Constantine&#x27;s Bridge) and the middle and lower Rhine by four different bridges (the Roman Bridge at Mainz, Caesar&#x27;s Rhine bridges, the Roman Bridge at Koblenz, the Roman Bridge at Cologne). For rivers with strong currents and to allow swift army movements, pontoon bridges were also routinely employed. Judging by the distinct lack of records of pre-modern solid bridges spanning larger rivers, the Roman feat appears to be unsurpassed anywhere in the world until into the 19th century.

<text>Murray Seafield St George Head (born 5 March 1946) is an English actor and singer. Head has appeared in a number of films, including a starring role as the character Bob Elkin in the BAFTA award winning and Oscar-nominated 1971 film &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;. As a musician, he is most recognised for his international hit songs &quot;Superstar&quot; (from the 1970 rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;) and &quot;One Night in Bangkok&quot; (the 1984 single from the musical &quot;Chess&quot;, which topped the charts in various countries). He has been involved in several projects since the 1960s and continues to record music, perform concerts, and make appearances on television either as himself or as a character actor.

==Early life and education==
Head was born in London to Seafield Laurence Stewart Murray Head (20 August 1919 – 22 March 2009) and Helen Shingler (29 August 1919 − 8 October 2019). Head&#x27;s father was a documentary filmmaker for Verity Films. Head&#x27;s mother played Mme Maigret alongside Rupert Davies in the BBC 1960s television adaptation of the &quot;Maigret&quot; novels written by Georges Simenon. Head&#x27;s younger brother Anthony Head is also an actor, best known for playing Rupert Giles in the TV series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

Head was educated at the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle in South Kensington, London and Hampton School in Hampton, Middlesex. He attended Chiswick Polytechnic (A level college) in the early 1960s.

==Career==
Head began writing songs as a child, and by the mid-1960s he had a London-based recording contract. He briefly appeared as one of the hosts of the Bristol-based television pop show &quot;Now!&quot; alongside Michael Palin. He had limited success, until asked by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber to play Judas Iscariot on the original concept album version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;; at the time, he had been appearing in the West End production of the musical &quot;Hair&quot;. With the Trinidad Singers, the song &quot;Superstar&quot; peaked at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1971.

He made his film debut in &quot;The Family Way&quot; (1966), which featured Hayley Mills, Hywel Bennett and John Mills in the leading roles. Head won a leading role in the Oscar-nominated film &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (1971), alongside Peter Finch and Glenda Jackson. Despite these successes, he received little public attention in the next ten years (except for his single release, &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So, Joe&quot; in 1975, which has been covered by the Who&#x27;s lead vocalist, Roger Daltrey, among others, including both Gary Brooker of Procol Harum fame and the Hollies, who also covered his song &#x27;When I&#x27;m Yours&#x27; in 1979). &quot;Never Even Thought&quot; has been covered by both Colin Blunstone and Cliff Richard.
In 1973, he appeared in a radio drama, &quot;The Fourth Tower of Inverness&quot;. In 1979, Head appeared in the miniseries &quot;Prince Regent&quot; and the final episode of the ITV program &quot;Return of the Saint&quot;.

Head reappeared in the spotlight in 1984 as the American on the concept album for the musical &quot;Chess&quot;. The song &quot;One Night in Bangkok&quot; featured Head on lead vocals, affecting a New York accent. It became the last significant Broadway/West End number to be a hit single on American and German radio until &quot;No Matter What&quot; by Boyzone in 1996. &quot;One Night in Bangkok&quot; was a success in both Europe and North America. Head performed the role of world chess champion Frederick &quot;Freddie&quot; Trumper in the London West End stage production of &quot;Chess&quot; that premiered on 14 May 1986. The show ran in London until 8 April 1989; during its run, Head departed with vocal strain.

After that, Head had little recording success in the UK or the United States. This fact would later be underscored in a radio segment featured on &quot;The Kevin and Bean Show&quot; on KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, in which the hosts would phone Head in the morning to find out &quot;What&#x27;s Up with Murray Head?&quot; Fluent in French, he has released a number of albums in that language. A duet with Marie Carmen, &quot;Une femme un homme&quot;, was released in 1993 and was a hit in French-speaking Canada.

In 1999, Head co-wrote the screenplay to &quot;Les Enfants du Siècle&quot;.

He has appeared on television in the UK on &quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;North Square&quot; and &quot;Judge John Deed&quot;. He also played artist Jack Hollins, love interest of Gina Ward, on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeat&quot; from 2005 to 2006. On 15 March 2010 he appeared in the BBC drama &quot;Doctors&quot; playing a pop singer, Pete Perry, trying to make a comeback, in which Head sang Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Love in Vain&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Doctors&quot; again on 18 April 2019 as a different character, a drummer named Brian &#x27;Sticky&#x27; Burns. In Canada, he was part of the cast of the 2002 television mini-series &quot;Music-Hall&quot;, which played on the Radio-Canada network. In 2011 he appeared in the first episode of the series &quot;Vera&quot; (episode &quot;Hidden Depths&quot;) as Peter Calvert.

Head&#x27;s picture, from a still of &quot;The Family Way&quot;, appeared on the 1987 cover of the British band the Smiths single &quot;Stop Me If You Think You&#x27;ve Heard This One Before&quot; and the album cover of the band&#x27;s 1988 compilation album &quot;Stop Me&quot;.

==Personal life==
Head married Susan Ellis Jones in 1972; they divorced in 1992. He has two daughters, Katherine and Sophie. Sophie sometimes sings with her father, for example on songs such as &quot;Seras-tu là?&quot; on the album &quot;Tête à tête&quot; and &quot;Make It Easy&quot; from the &quot;Emotions&quot; album. Head married Lindy Ross (née Newton) on 14 February 2019.

<text>The American golden plover (Pluvialis dominica) is a medium-sized plover. The genus name is Latin and means relating to rain, from &quot;pluvia&quot;, &quot;rain&quot;. It was believed that golden plovers flocked when rain was imminent. The species name &quot;dominica&quot; refers to Santo Domingo, now Hispaniola, in the West Indies.

==Description==
Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

The breeding adult American golden plover has a black face, neck, breast, and belly, with a white crown and nape that extends to the side of the breast. The back is mottled black and white with pale, gold spots. The breeding female is similar, but with less black. When in , both sexes have grey-brown upperparts, pale grey-brown underparts, and a whitish eyebrow. The head is small, along with the bill.

It is similar to two other golden plovers, European and Pacific. The American golden plover is smaller, slimmer and relatively longer-legged than European golden plover (&quot;Pluvialis apricaria&quot;) which also has white axillary (armpit) feathers. It is more similar to Pacific golden plover (&quot;Pluvialis fulva&quot;) with which it shares grey axillary feathers; it was once considered conspecific under the name &quot;lesser golden plover&quot;. The Pacific golden plover is slimmer than the American species, has a shorter primary projection, and longer legs, and is usually yellower on the back. In breeding plumage, the American golden plover has a solid black lower belly and undertail, while the Pacific and European golden plovers have at least some to extensive white on the flanks and undertail. However, first-summer immature birds often gain only partial summer plumage with incomplete black and can be confused more easily. Another useful distinction is that in fall, the post-breeding moult is a month or more later in American golden plover (September to October, on the wintering grounds) than in Pacific golden plover (August).

==Distribution==
The breeding habitat of American golden plover is Arctic tundra in northern Canada (Baffin Island west to Yukon and northernmost British Columbia) and Alaska. They nest on the ground in a dry open area. They are migratory and winter in southern South America. They follow an elliptical migration path; northbound birds pass through Central America from January to April and stage in great numbers in places like Illinois before their final push north. In fall, they take a more easterly route, flying mostly over the western Atlantic and Caribbean Sea to the wintering grounds in Patagonia. The bird has one of the longest known migratory routes of over . Of this, is over open ocean where it cannot stop to feed or drink. It does this from body fat stores that it stocks up on prior to the flight. 

It is a regular though scarce fall migrant in western Europe, with typically 20–25 sightings annually in Great Britain; spring records are much rarer.

A comparison of dates and migratory patterns leads to the conclusion that Eskimo curlews and American golden plovers were the most likely shore birds to have attracted the attention of Christopher Columbus to the nearby Americas in early October 1492, after 65 days at sea out of sight of land.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
This bird uses scrape nests, lining them with lichens, grass, and leaves. At its breeding grounds, it is very territorial, displaying aggressively to neighbours. Some American golden plovers are also territorial in their wintering grounds.

The American golden plover lays a clutch of four white to buff eggs that are heavily blotched with both black and brown spots. The eggs generally measure around . These eggs are incubated for a period of 26 to 27 days, with the male incubating during the day and the female during the night. The chicks are on hatching, leaving the nest within hours and feeding themselves within a day.

===Diet===
These birds forage for food on tundra, fields, beaches and tidal flats, usually by sight. They eat terrestrial earthworms, terrestrial snails, insects, insect larvae, crustaceans, fish, berries and seeds.

==Status==
Large numbers were shot in the late 19th century and the population has never fully recovered.
