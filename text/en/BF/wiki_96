<text>Angel Maturino Reséndiz (August 1, 1959 – June 27, 2006), known as The Railroad Killer, was a Mexican serial killer suspected in as many as 23 murders across the United States and Mexico during the 1990s, some of which involved sexual assault. He had become known as &quot;The Railroad Killer&quot;, as most of his crimes were committed near railroads, where he had jumped off the trains which he was using to travel around.

On June 21, 1999, he briefly became the 457th fugitive listed by the FBI on its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, before he surrendered to the Texas authorities on July 13, 1999. He was convicted of capital murder in Texas, and executed by lethal injection in 2006.

==Personal life==
Ángel Leoncio Reyes Recendiz was born in Izúcar de Matamoros, Puebla, Mexico, but he had taken his mother&#x27;s and stepfather&#x27;s surnames calling himself Ángel Maturino Reséndiz.

==Murders and methodology==

By illegally jumping on and off trains within and across Mexico, Canada, and the United States, generally crossing borders illegally, Reséndiz was able to evade authorities for a considerable time. He used many aliases, but was chiefly known and sought after as &quot;Rafael Resendez-Ramirez&quot;. His birth name was Ángel Leoncio Reyes Recendis. United States government records show that he had been deported to Mexico at least four times since first entering the U.S. in 1973.

Reséndiz killed at least 15 people with rocks, a pickaxe, and other blunt objects, mainly in their homes. He was sometimes referred to as &quot;The Railway Killer&quot; or &quot;The Railcar Killer&quot;. After each murder, he would linger in the homes for a while, mainly to eat. Reséndiz took sentimental items, and also laid out the victims&#x27; driver&#x27;s licenses to learn about their lives. He stole jewelry and other items, and gave them to his wife and mother, who lived in Rodeo, Durango, Mexico. Much of the jewelry was sold or melted down. After Reséndiz&#x27;s surrender, some of the stolen items that had been removed from his victims&#x27; homes were returned by his wife and mother. Money was sometimes left at the scene. He raped some of his female victims; however, rape was probably a secondary intent. As Reséndiz himself was of small stature, he did not attack large victims, who could have overpowered him. Most of his victims were found covered with a blanket, or otherwise obscured from immediate view.

==Victims==
Reséndiz was tried and sentenced to death for the Benton murder.

==Arrest and trial==
Prior to surrendering at the El Paso bridge, the U.S. Border Patrol had arrested Reséndiz and deported him back to Mexico. Reséndiz&#x27;s sister, Manuela, had seen her brother&#x27;s FBI&#x27;s Most Wanted Poster and feared that her brother might kill someone else, or be killed by Mexican bounty hunters, so she contacted the police. On July 12, 1999, a Texas Ranger, Drew Carter, accompanied by Kimberley Barkhausen (FBI), Manuela and a spiritual guide, met up with Reséndiz on a bridge connecting El Paso, Texas with Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. Reséndiz surrendered to Carter.

During a court appearance, Reséndiz accused Carter of lying under oath because Reséndiz&#x27;s family was under the impression that he would be spared the death penalty. Reséndiz&#x27;s ultimate fate, however, was decided by a jury, not Carter. In 1999, former Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, wary of the controversy miring the many confessions and recantations by serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, remarked of Reséndiz, &quot;I hope they don&#x27;t start pinning on him every crime that happens near a railroad track.&quot;

===Mexican government response===
Reséndiz&#x27;s defense attorney along with the assistance of Mexican consul-general in Houston Rodulfo Figueroa Aramoni (consul general, 1998–1999) and other Mexican government officials combined efforts to negotiate with the state of Texas for an extradition to Mexico in hopes to spare Reséndiz&#x27;s life from the death penalty.

In 2006, Mexican presidential spokesman Ruben Aguilar said at a press conference that Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Luis Ernesto Derbez had contacted then Texas Governor Rick Perry to ask for clemency for Maturino Reséndiz.

&quot;We will continue fighting (for the condemned man) because we believe that the death penalty does not solve absolutely anything,&quot; Mexican presidential spokesman Ruben Aguilar said.

He was sentenced to death on May 22, 2000, by a Texas court.

==Mental health==
On June 21, 2006, a Houston judge ruled that Reséndiz was mentally competent to be executed. Upon hearing the judge&#x27;s ruling, Reséndiz said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in death. I know the body is going to go to waste. But me, as a person, I&#x27;m eternal. I&#x27;m going to be alive forever.&quot; He also described himself as half-man and half-angel and told psychiatrists he could not be executed because he did not believe he could die. These and similar statements led Dr. Pablo Stewart, a bilingual psychiatrist who evaluated Reséndiz on two occasions in 2006, to conclude that Reséndiz was not then competent to be executed as &quot;...delusions had completely taken over [Reséndiz&#x27;s] thought processes...&quot;

==Execution==
Despite an appeal pending with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Reséndiz&#x27;s death warrant was signed for the murder of Claudia Benton. He was housed in the Polunsky Unit in West Livingston, Texas awaiting execution. He was executed in the Huntsville Unit in Huntsville, Texas, on June 27, 2006, by lethal injection.

In his final statement, Reséndiz said, &quot;I want to ask if it is in your heart to forgive me. You don&#x27;t have to. I know I allowed the Devil to rule my life. I just ask you to forgive me and ask the Lord to forgive me for allowing the devil to deceive me. I thank God for having patience in me. I don&#x27;t deserve to cause you pain. You do not deserve this. I deserve what I am getting.&quot; Reséndiz was pronounced dead at 8:05 p.m. CDT (01:05 UTC) on June 27, 2006. Claudia Benton&#x27;s husband, George, was present at the execution and said Reséndiz was &quot;evil contained in human form, a creature without a soul, no conscience, no sense of remorse, no regard for the sanctity of human life.&quot;

<text>The Kataeb Party (), officially the Kataeb Party – Lebanese Social Democratic Party ( &#x27;), also known as thePhalangist Party, is a right-wing Christian political party in Lebanon founded by Pierre Gemayel in 1936.

The party and its paramilitary wings played a major role in the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990), opposing Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon as well as collaborating with Israel. The Phalangists were responsible for the Black Saturday massacre, the Tel al-Zaatar massacre, Ehden massacre, and the Karantina massacre. Many in response to massacres committed by the PLO and LNM, such as: Damour Massacre, Ain Ebel Massacre and the Chekka Massacre. In 1982, Pierre&#x27;s youngest son Bachir, the leader of the party&#x27;s militia, was elected President, but was assassinated before he could take office. This led to Phalangist militiamen committing the infamous Sabra and Shatilla massacre during the 1982 war, with support from the IDF. Bachir was succeeded by his older brother Amine, who led the party through much of the war. In decline in the late 1980s and 1990s, the party slowly re-emerged in the early 2000s and is currently part of the Lebanese opposition. The party currently holds 4 out of the 128 seats in the Lebanese Parliament.

==Names==
The Lebanese Phalanges Party is also known as &#x27; in French and either &quot;Kataeb&quot; ( &#x27;) or &quot;Phalangist Party&quot; ( &quot;&quot;) in Arabic. &quot;Kataeb&quot; is the plural of &quot;Katiba&quot; which is a translation into Arabic of the Greek word phalanx (&quot;battalion&quot;) which is also the origin of the Spanish term &quot;Falange&quot;. In 2021, the party changed its official name to &quot;The Kataeb Party – Lebanese Social Democratic Party&quot; (, &quot;Hiẓb al-Katā&#x27;ib al-Lubnāniyya – Hiẓb al-dīmūqrāṭī al-ijtimāʿī al-lubnānī&quot;).

==Origins==
The Kataeb party was established on November 5, 1936 as a Maronite paramilitary youth organization by Pierre Gemayel who modeled the party after the Nazi Party, the Spanish Falange, and Italian Fascist parties, all of which he had encountered as an Olympic athlete during the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, then Nazi Germany. The movement&#x27;s uniforms originally included brown shirts, and its members used the Fascist salute.

In an interview by Robert Fisk, Gemayel stated about Nazism and the Berlin Olympics:

I was the captain of the Lebanese football team and the president of the Lebanese Football Federation. We went to the Olympic Games of 1936 in Berlin. And I saw then this discipline and order. And I said to myself: &quot;Why can&#x27;t we do the same thing in Lebanon?&quot; So when we came back to Lebanon, we created this youth movement. When I was in Berlin then, Nazism did not have the reputation that it has now. Nazism? In every system in the world, you can find something good. But Nazism was not Nazism at all. The word came afterwards. In their system, I saw discipline. And we in the Middle East, we need discipline more than anything else.

Pierre founded the party along with four other young Lebanese: Charles Helou, who later became a President of Lebanon, Chafic Nassif, Emile Yared, and Georges Naccache. Gemayel was chosen to lead the organization, in part because he was not a political figure at that time.

During the first years of the Kataeb Party, the Party was strongly opposed to having any group dominate Lebanon. They opposed the pan-Arabists who tried to take over Lebanon and also the French, whom they saw as trying to infiltrate their culture and impose themselves within Lebanon. Gemayel and the Kataeb Party advocated for an independent and sovereign Lebanon free of all foreign influence. They actively took part in the struggle against the French Mandate, until Lebanese independence was proclaimed in November 1943. The party motto was &quot;God, Nation and Family.&quot;

In the 1950s, the Phalanges, deliberately emphasized French personalist thinking in their ideological framework, particularly influenced by the works of French Christian Existentialist philosopher Emmanuel Mounier (1905–1950). Mounier&#x27;s ideas, which gained prominence among Catholic students in France during the 1930s, were integral in shaping the party&#x27;s philosophical underpinnings. In the Kataeb&#x27;s first party program, presented at their inaugural congress in 1956, the party clearly reflected Mounier&#x27;s personalist principles, which advocated for a society of citizens rather than mere collective nationalism. This approach starkly contrasted with the ideology of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), which emphasized the primacy of the nation over the intrinsic value of the individual. The adoption of these ideas marked a significant shift within the party and was particularly popularized by young Phalangist intellectuals who had encountered Mounier&#x27;s thought during their university studies in France.

The influence of the Phalangists was very limited in the early years of Lebanon&#x27;s independence but came to prominence as a strong ally of the government in the 1958 crisis. In the aftermath of the crisis, Gemayel was appointed to the cabinet, and two years later, was elected to the National Assembly.

In 1968, the party joined the Helf Alliance formed with the two other big mainly Christian parties in Lebanon: the National Liberal Party of former President Camille Chamoun, and National Bloc of Raymond Eddé, and won 9 seats of 99 in the 1968 parliamentary elections, making it one of the largest groupings in Lebanon&#x27;s notoriously fractured political system. By the end of the decade, the party created its own militia, the Kataeb Regulatory Forces (KRF) and soon clashes began with the rising Palestinian militant guerrillas.

By the 1970s, the party had become a political giant in Lebanon, with an estimated membership of 60,000 to 70,000. The vast majority (85%) of members were Maronites, but some were members of minority Christian communities, Shiites, Druze, and Jews.

==Kataeb Regulatory Forces==
The Phalange party&#x27;s militia was not only the largest and best organized political paramilitary force in Lebanon but also the oldest. It was founded in 1937 as the &quot;Militants&#x27; organization&quot; by the President of the Party Pierre Gemayel and William Hawi, a Lebanese-American glass industrialist, who led them during the 1958 civil war. Fighting alongside the pro-government forces, the Phalangists defended the Metn region.

Disbanded in January 1961 by order of the Kataeb Party&#x27;s Political Bureau, Hawi created in their place the Kataeb Regulatory Forces. In order to coordinate the activities of all Phalange paramilitary forces, the Political Bureau set up the Kataeb War Council (Arabic: &quot;Majliss al-Harbi&quot;) in 1970, with William Hawi being appointed as head. The seat of the Council was allocated at the Kataeb Party&#x27;s Headquarters at the heart of Ashrafieh quarter in East Beirut and a quiet expansion of KRF units followed suit, complemented by the development of a training infrastructure.

Two company-sized Special Forces units, the &quot;1st Commando&quot; and the &quot;2nd Commando&quot; were created in 1963, soon followed by the &quot;Pierre Gemayel&quot; squad (later a company) and a VIP protection squad. To this was added in 1973 another commando platoon (Arabic: &quot;Maghaweer&quot;) and a &quot;Combat School&quot; was secretly opened at Tabrieh, near Bsharri in the Keserwan District. Another special unit, the &quot;Bashir Gemayel brigade&quot; – named after Pierre Gemayel&#x27;s youngest son, Bashir – was formed in 1964, absorbing the old &quot;PG&quot; company in the process.

Considered by many analysts as the best organized of all militia &quot;fiefs&quot; in the whole of Lebanon under the leadership of &quot;chef&quot; Boutros Khawand, it was administered by a network of Phalangist-controlled business corporations headed by the GAMMA Group &quot;brain-trust&quot;, backed by the DELTA computer company, and the SONAPORT holding. The latter had run since 1975 the legal commercial ports of Jounieh and Beirut, including the infamous clandestine &quot;Dock Five&quot; – &quot;Cinquième basin&quot; in French – from which the Phalange extracted additional revenues by levying illegal taxes and carried out arms-smuggling operations. The KRF was served by a clandestine-built airstrip, the Pierre Gemayel International Airport, opened in 1976 at Hamat, north of Batroun, and had its own radio station &quot;The Voice of Lebanon&quot; (Arabic: &quot;Iza&#x27;at Sawt Loubnan&quot;) or &quot;La Voix du Liban&quot; (VDL) in French set up in 1976.

In July–August of that same year, the Phalangists headed alongside its allies, the Army of Free Lebanon, Al-Tanzim, NLP Tigers Militia, Guardians of the Cedars (GoC), the Tyous Team of Commandos (TTC) and the Lebanese Youth Movement (LYM) in the sieges – and subsequent massacres – of Karantina, al-Masklah and Tel al-Zaatar Massacres at the Muslim-populated slum districts and adjacent Palestinian refugee camps of East Beirut, and at the town of Dbayeh in the Metn.

During the 1975–76 phase of the Lebanese Civil War, the Kataeb Regulatory Forces&#x27; own mobilization and street action skills allowed the Kataeb to become the primary and most fearsome fighting force in the Christian-conservative camp.

At Beirut and elsewhere, Phalange militia sections were heavily committed in several battles against Lebanese National Movement (LNM) leftist militias and suffered considerable casualties, notably at the Battle of the Hotels in October 1975 where they fought the al-Murabitoun and the Nasserite Correctionist Movement (NCM), and later at the &#x27;Spring Offensive&#x27; held against Mount Lebanon in March 1976.

==Main events==
===1936–1943===
In 1943, the Kataeb played an instrumental role in attaining Lebanon&#x27;s first independence from the French mandate. During this period, Kataeb led many social struggles to consolidate national cohesion and promote individual liberties and social welfare. The Kataeb elaborated the first Lebanese &quot;labour charter&quot; in 1937. It was a pioneering initiative as it called for a minimum wage, a limitation of working hours, and paid leaves. The Kataeb was one of the first Lebanese parties to have a solid avant-garde economic program and organized social activism throughout Lebanon.

1941 saw the creation of the first women section in a Lebanese Party. It called openly for stopping any kind of discrimination towards women. Since 1939, the Party has issued &quot;Al Amal&quot;, a leading bilingual political publication.

===1943–1958===

The Kataeb Party entered the political and parliamentary scene during the late 1940s after a period in which it refrained from entering the political arena to focus mainly on the promotion of the youth and on social issues, away from the trivialities of post-mandate politics.

Kataeb struggled to preserve Lebanon&#x27;s independence facing the growing appetite of its neighbors. The Party expanded considerably its presence throughout the territory and attracted thousands of new members, undoubtedly forming one of the largest parties in the Middle East. Kataeb adopted a modern organization which made its fame and became its trademark. In 1958 the Kataeb was the key actor in confronting the coup influenced by pan-Arabists led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of the ephemeral United Arab Republic (Egypt, Syria, and Yemen), and succeeded in maintaining Lebanon&#x27;s independence and liberal identity.

===1958–1969===

After having succeeded in preserving the Lebanese formula, Kataeb Party ranks grew considerably and reached 70,000 members, out of a total population of 2.2 million. The Party achieved many electoral successes and became the main Christian component of successive governments. During the ministerial mandates held by its members, it made elementary education mandatory, and improved the public school infrastructure. On a social level, the Kataeb Party introduced &quot;labor laws&quot; and contributed decisively to social security law. The party played a key role in promoting modern institutions that are still today the pillars of the Lebanese administrative system, including the Civil Service Council, the Central Inspection Board, and many others.

Pierre Gemayel, leader of the party and minister of public works, gave Lebanon a large part of its modern infrastructure by completing 440 development projects during his term. Lebanon was at its peak and became a first-tier destination for world tourism. But what was labeled as the &quot;Switzerland of the Middle East&quot; was a shaky construction, with the influx of Palestinian refugees after 1949 setting the stage for an ominous future.

=== 1970–1982 ===
In the early 1970s, Christian leaders in Lebanon feared that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was increasingly operating in Lebanon as a state within a state. While it is contested whether the Palestinian presence was a cause of the Lebanese Civil War, Lebanon&#x27;s political balance had been fragile since 1958 and political tensions were already running high among the Lebanese.

The Lebanese Civil War erupted in 1975 following the Ain ar-Rummaneh Bus Massacre, which was carried out by Phalangist militants and regarded as the starting point of the Lebanese civil war. Following this development, and coupled with the disintegration of the state institutions and the army, the country became an open battlefield. Many foreign states were directly and militarily involved in the Lebanese conflict, especially Syria, which, under the banner of Arab solidarity, tried to impose its authority upon the country, and Israel, which invaded Lebanon in 1978. The Kataeb Party, along with other political parties, formed the Lebanese Forces and battled to preserve Lebanon and its independence and integrity. During the war, the Phalangists were responsible for several massacres, including the Tel al-Zaatar massacre, the Black Saturday massacre, the Karantina massacre, and the Sabra and Shatilla massacre.

The Kataeb Party succeeded in getting two of its leaders elected to the presidency. President-elect Bachir Gemayel, son of Pierre Gemayel and leader of the Lebanese Forces, was assassinated in 1982 when an explosion rocked the Party&#x27;s headquarters in the Achrafieh area of Beirut. The architect of the blast was a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. In the aftermath of the assassination, Amin Gemayel, the eldest son of Pierre Gemayel, was elected President of the Lebanese Republic. The Kataeb Party was heavily supported by Israel throughout the Civil War and, with the support of the IDF, committed the Sabra and Shatilla massacre in 1982, during which Phalangist members murdered thousands of Palestinian civilians, raped Palestinian women, and destroyed much of the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camp.

The 1982 Israeli Judicial inquiry into the Sabra and Shatila massacre estimated that when fully mobilized, the Phalange had 5,000 fighters, of whom 2,000 were full-time. From the start of the invasion, Israeli Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan told the Phalange not to engage in any fighting. In February 1983, the UN commission found that &quot;Israeli authorities or forces were involved, directly or indirectly in the [Sabra and Shatila] massacres&quot;.

===1982–1988===
Despite the turmoil caused by the civil strife in Lebanon and the raging wars that devastated the country, President Gemayel was able to accomplish many achievements during his presidential mandate. One of his first achievements was to rebuild the State&#x27;s institutions and to reorganize and resupply the Army in preparation for the struggle to recover sovereignty and provide security for Lebanon. The same efforts to liberate the country culminated in the Agreement on Security Arrangements of 17 May 1983, which was somewhat an affirmation of the Armistice Agreement of 1949 with Israel even though this agreement was never concluded because of the opposition of Syria and then Israel.

Amin Gemayel called for and chaired national dialogue conferences in Geneva and Lausanne and succeeded in creating a national accord and the formation of a fully representative government. He rebuilt the Lebanese University and laid its modern foundation, introduced many economic reforms, and started to rebuild Beirut&#x27;s central district. The war was still raging and Lebanon&#x27;s neighbors, mainly Syria and Israel, expanded their influence in Lebanon. On the other hand, the Kataeb Party suffered a great loss with the death of its founder, Cheikh Pierre Gemayel in 1984.

The Sabra and Shatila massacre was the slaughter of between 762 and 3,500 civilians, almost all Palestinians, by a Lebanese Christian militia in the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut, Lebanon from approximately 6:00 pm 16 September to 8:00 am 18 September 1982. The massacre was presented as retaliation for the assassination of the newly elected Lebanese president Bachir Gemayel, the leader of the Lebanese Kataeb Party. The Phalangist militia was led by the intelligence chief Elie Hobeika. Many of the victims were tortured before they were killed. Women were raped and some victims were skinned alive. Others had limbs chopped off with axes. In February 1983, the UN commission found that &quot;Israeli authorities or forces were involved, directly or indirectly in the [Sabra and Shatila] massacres&quot;.

===1989–2000===
In 1990, the Lebanese War came to a close when Syrian forces maintained their grip over the entire country leading to fifteen years of occupation during which President Amin Gemayel was exiled to France and the Kataeb Party fell under Syrian influence. Organized institutions that could endanger Syrian rule in Lebanon were systematically muzzled. Christian parties paid the highest price for their resistance to Syrian hegemony and their leaders were either eliminated, exiled, or imprisoned. Kataeb&#x27;s spirit was still strong between its members and sympathizers. This started to be visible in the late 1990s when Kataeb students participated actively in the student and intellectual resistance that started to be heard.

On September 15, 1992, at 9:15 AM, Boutros Khawand was heading to Kataeb headquarters in Beirut when his car, a red Opel, was intercepted by two BMW cars and one red van, 100m away from his home. Between eight and ten gunmen were in the attacking squad, they pulled him out of his car and forced him into the van.

===2000–2010===

The revival of Lebanon and the Party: Amin Gemayel returned to Lebanon in June 2000 and was welcomed by large crowds that filled the streets and squares of Bikfaya. Pierre Amin Gemayel was elected MP for Metn district, signalling the rebirth of the Kataeb Party. &quot;Kataeb opposition&quot; was structured and began its activities within the framework of the &quot;Kornet Shahwan Coalition&quot;, and then through the Bristol Gathering, which formed a platform for the joint Christian-Muslim opposition.

Eventually, all this led to the Independence Uprising in February 2005 and on 14 March 2005 more than a million Lebanese filled the streets of central Beirut to demand Syrian withdrawal and the restoration of sovereignty. The Kataeb Party extensively participated in the Cedar Revolution and MP Pierre Gemayel played a significant role in shaping this uprising which led to Lebanon&#x27;s second independence.

Syrian troops effectively left Lebanon on 26 April 2005. At the same time, the Kataeb Party reunited and retrieved its historical role. Pierre Amin Gemayel played a key role in reuniting the Party in 2006. Pierre Gemayel was assassinated on 21 November 2006, and in 2007, the Party was dealt another blow when MP Antoine Ghanem was assassinated as well. During the 2009 general elections, under the leadership of Amine Gemayel, they managed to receive 5 seats in parliament.

=== 2020–present ===
In 2020, Kataeb Secretary-General Nazar Najarian was killed in the 2020 Beirut explosions on 4 August 2020, after a series of explosions had occurred at the Port of Beirut, sending debris across the city. He suffered head trauma and succumbed to his injuries. He was buried on 8 August 2020.

During the Lebanese general elections, candidates were announced on the 20 February 2022 under the campaign slogan &quot;Ma minsawim&quot; (ما منساوم ). Kataeb leader Samy Gemayel insisted that the Kataeb party was the only one that has &quot;faced the fact of surrendering to Hezbollah&#x27;s will, electing Michel Aoun as president and isolating Lebanon from its surroundings. Samy Gemayel emphasized:

On 2 April Nadim Gemayel, a cousin of Samy, promoted his candidacy in a speech during a small event. Kataeb secured 4 seats for Salim Sayegh (3,477 votes), Nadim Gemayel (4,425 votes), Sami Gemayel (10,466 votes), and Elias Hankash (6,148 votes). A close ally of the party, Jean Talozian, also managed to wain a seat with 4,043 votes in Beirut I with Nadim.

In February 2025, Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam announced his government, which consists of 24 ministers; the Kataeb Party controls one portfolio: the Justice Ministry, headed by Adel Amin Nassar.

==War era and decline==
Throughout the 1975 Civil War, the Phalange Party was the most important force within the Christian camp, and its militia carried out most of the fighting as part of the Lebanese Front, the mostly Christian rightist coalition.

In April 1975, four persons, among them two men close to the Gemayel family, were killed during an attack on a church inauguration ceremony by unknown attackers in the Beirut suburb of Ain El Remmaneh. In retaliation Phalangist militias killed 28 passengers of a bus later that day, most of them Palestinian with some that were deemed to be armed and were coming back from a rally at camp Tel el-Zaatar, since they suspected Palestinians to be behind the church attack. The Bus Massacre is commonly considered as the spark that set off the Lebanese Civil War.

In the following days, the 8,000-strong party militia, the Kataeb Regulatory Forces, together with its allies, the Tigers militia, Al-Tanzim, Marada Brigade, Guardians of the Cedars, Lebanese Youth Movement, Tyous Team of Commandos and other formations, was heavily engaged in street fights against the Palestinian militias and their allies in the anti-government secular Lebanese National Movement.

During the Lebanese Civil War, many predominantly Christian militias were formed that gained support from the north of Lebanon. These militias were staunchly right-wing, nationalist, and anti-Palestinian with a majority of their members being Maronite. The Kataeb party was the most powerful of these militias at the time of the Lebanese Civil War. The party later went on to help found the right-wing Lebanese Forces militia in 1977 which played a large role in the Lebanese Civil War.

In September 1982, Bachir Gemayel was elected President of Lebanon by the National Assembly. He was assassinated less than a month later in an operation thought to have been arranged by Syrian intelligence and was succeeded by his brother, Amine Gemayel. Bachir was thought to have been radical in his approach and hinted at possible peace agreements with Israel while trying to expel all Palestinian refugees from Lebanon. In contrast, Amine was thought to have been much more moderate.

On 16 September 1982, Elie Hobeika led the massacre of between 762 and 3,500 Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, while the periphery of the camps was under the control of the Israeli Defense Forces.

After the death of Pierre Gemayel in 1984, his successors Elie Karamé and Amine Gemayel struggled to maintain influence over the actions of the Lebanese Army, which became virtually independent as Muslim recruits deserted and rebelled against the mostly Christian officer ranks. The Kataeb party began to decline, not playing a major role for the remainder of the war.

==Syrian occupation==
The party, lacking direction, broke down into several rival factions. Georges Saadeh took control of the Party from 1986 until his death in 1998. He took a moderate position toward the Syrian presence. Mounir Hajj became the president of the party in 1999, followed by Karim Pakradouni in 2002. Amine Gemayel left Lebanon in 1988 after his mandate had ended, mainly to avoid a clash with Samir Geagea&#x27;s Lebanese Forces and avoid more intra-Christian bloodshed. He returned in 2000 to oppose the Syrian role in Lebanon and to back his son Pierre&#x27;s parliamentary election campaign, which he won.

His sons Pierre and Samy, had returned in 1997 and had been working on reorganizing the popular base of the party. His return was not welcomed by the established leadership of the party who had become government puppets. To distinguish themselves from the official leadership, Gemayel&#x27;s supporters started referring to themselves as &quot;The Kataeb Base&quot; or &quot;The Kataeb Reform Movement&quot;. General consensus amongst Lebanese always recognized Gemayel as the legitimate Leader of the party, not because of lineage but because of most of the popular support.

==Cedar Revolution==
In March 2005 after the Rafik Hariri assassination, the Kataeb took part in an anti-Syrian presence demonstration, commonly known as the Cedar Revolution. It became a member of the March 14 Alliance, along with the Future Movement, Progressive Socialist Party, Lebanese Forces and other minor parties. The Kataeb won 4 seats in the June 2005 elections, 3 representing the Gemayel Leadership (Pierre Gemayel, Solange Gemayel, and Antoine Ghanem) and 1 representing the official leadership of the Party. They formed one parliamentary bloc after a reconciliation that took place in 2005.

This reconciliation was marketed as a gesture of goodwill from Pierre Amine Gemayel who deemed it was time to turn the page and give those who were unfaithful to the party principles a second chance. Practically, it was a way for Pakradouni and his men to leave the Party with as little humiliation as possible since the reconciliation deal stipulated the resignation of the entire political bureau after 2 years. This reconciliation saw Amine come back to the Party as Supreme President of the Party while Pakradouni stayed on as President.

Samy Gemayel, Amine&#x27;s second son, had formed his own political ideas and identity at the time, much closer in principle and in a manner to those of his uncle Bachir. He was very opposed to Pakradouni and his Syrian ties and thus was not a fan of this reconciliation. This drew Samy away from the party and prompted him to create a Think-Tank/Research-Center on Federalism named Loubnanouna, &quot;Our Lebanon&quot;.

==Siniora Government==
In July 2005, the party participated in the Fouad Siniora Government, with Pierre Amine Gemayel as the minister of industry. Pierre played an important role in the reorganization and development of the party. His assassination in November 2006 was a major blow to the party. Syrian intelligence and &quot;Fateh Al Islam&quot; have been accused of the assassination. With 14 March Alliance forces, the party supports the Lebanese government against Hezbollah.

In September 2007 another Kataeb MP, Antoine Ghanem was assassinated in a car bombing. Solange Gemayel remained the party&#x27;s only MP since Pierre Gemayel&#x27;s seat was lost to the Free Patriotic Movement of Michel Aoun in a special election in August 2007.

In 2007, Samy Gemayel and most of his Loubnanouna companions rejoined the Kataeb, prompting a renaissance in the party.

==2009 elections==
In the 2009 parliamentary elections the Kataeb Party managed to win 5 seats. 1 in the Metn Caza, 1 in the Beirut-1 Caza, 1 in Zahle, 1 in the Aley Caza and another in the Tripoli Caza. The victories in Beirut-1 and Zahle as well as not allowing the opposition&#x27;s list to win fully in Metn were major upsets to the General Aoun&#x27;s FPM who is an ally of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, although the opposition&#x27;s list was not 100% complete, leaving one Maronite seat vacant by purpose for the candidate of the Gemayel family.

These victories enabled Samy Gemayel, Nadim Gemayel (son of the assassinated President Bachir Gemayel), Elie Marouni, Fady el-Haber, and Samer Saade to join the Parliament.
In the first Government of PM Saad Hariri, the Kataeb were assigned the Social Affairs portfolio.

==March 14 and the breakup==
Disagreements between Kataeb and March 14 deepened in 2016 when the Lebanese Forces endorsed March 8 candidate Michel Aoun for presidency.

Kataeb left the government and, thus, the March 14 alliance in June 2016.

==The Kataeb Party today==
Since the end of Syria&#x27;s occupation of Lebanon in 2005, the Kataeb Party has been attracted once again to new generations and has regained its role as one of the major political actors in Lebanon. The Party has a large network in Lebanon and abroad and one cannot find a major city or town without a Kataeb presence.

The Party has an active parliamentary group and has MPs elected in nearly all major Christian constituencies such as Beirut, Metn, Zahlé, Aley, and the North. Kataeb Ministers have been particularly active in governments led by the 14 March coalition, namely in the Ministries of Industry, Social Affairs, and Tourism.

The Kataeb Party calls for an objective assessment of the Lebanese political system&#x27;s limitations in order to guarantee the required political stability, security, and economic prosperity. The series of political crises that Lebanon witnessed since its first independence in 1943 highlighted the shortcomings of the consensual and unitary system and its inadequacy with pluralistic countries such as Lebanon.

During the 2009 parliamentary elections that saw the victory of the Party and its allies, Kataeb presented a comprehensive program under the title of &quot;Pact of Stability&quot;. The vision of the Party revolves around the following main ideas:

* Adopting decentralization in order to be closer to the citizens and guarantee basic rights and freedoms, in order to manage constructively Lebanon&#x27;s cultural pluralism and to ensure development in all parts of the Lebanese territory.
* Proclaiming the neutrality of Lebanon towards all armed conflicts in the region in order to protect Lebanon from external meddling in its affairs, except for the Arab-Israeli conflict.
* Safeguarding the secular State in Lebanon and completing its legal framework to guarantee the freedom of the individual and the respect of his rights and integrity. 
* Ending the military status of several Lebanese and non-Lebanese groups such as Hezbollah, Palestinian armed militias, and other Islamist groups, and calling for their immediate disarmament.
* Committing to all relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, primarily 1559 (2004), 1680 (2006), 1701 (2006) and 1757 (2007).
* Rejecting any form of permanent settlement of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon at the expense of their right of return.
* Reforming the Lebanese Administration and adopting modern economic policies to stimulate the economy, ensure prosperity, and therefore stop emigration.

The Party is strongly concerned about the presence of Palestinian refugees with their regional and domestic ramifications. Notwithstanding that the Kataeb has recently attempted to improve the inhumane living conditions of refugees through Parliament, it remains concerned about latent or gradual attempts to force their permanent settlement in Lebanon.

On 11 March 2018, the Kataeb Party unveiled its 131-point platform, in which they expressed some progressive values such as decriminalizing homosexuality, abolishing capital punishment, removing censorship laws, and adopting a 30% female quota system in the parliament.

The secretary-general of the party, Nazar Najarian, was killed in the 2020 Port of Beirut explosions.

== 2022 elections ==

Kataeb leader Samy Gemayel insisted that the Kataeb party was the only one that has faced the fact of surrendering to Hezbollah&#x27;s will, electing Michel Aoun as president and isolating Lebanon from its surroundings. Samy Gemayel emphasized:On 2 April Nadim Gemayel, cousin of Samy, promoted his candidacy in a speech during a small event.

<text>A trial court or court of first instance is a court having original jurisdiction, in which trials take place. Appeals from the decisions of trial courts are usually heard by higher courts with the power of appellate review (appellate courts). Most appellate courts do not have the authority to hear testimony or take evidence, but instead rule solely on matters of law.

In the trial court, evidence and testimony are admitted under the rules of evidence established by applicable procedural law and determinations called &quot;findings of fact&quot; are made based on the evidence. The court, presided over by one or more judges, makes &quot;findings of law&quot; based upon the applicable law. In most common law jurisdictions, the trial court often sits with a jury and one judge; in such jury trials, the jury acts as trier of fact. In some cases, the judge or judges act as triers of both fact and law, by either statute, custom, or agreement of the parties; this is referred to as a bench trial.

== In the United States ==
In the United States, a trial court of general jurisdiction is authorized to hear some type of civil or criminal case that is not committed exclusively to another court. The United States district courts are the trial courts of general jurisdiction of the federal judiciary; each state has a system establishing trial courts of general jurisdiction, such as the circuit courts in Florida, the superior courts in California, and the New York Supreme Court in New York state. Most trial courts are courts of record, where the record of the presentation of evidence is created and must be maintained or transmitted to the appellate court. The record of the trial court is certified by the clerk of the trial court and transmitted to the appellate body.

Not all cases are heard in trial courts of general jurisdiction. A trial court of limited jurisdiction is authorized to hear only specified types of cases. Trial courts of limited jurisdiction may be limited in subject-matter jurisdiction (such as juvenile, probate, and family courts in many U.S. states, or the United States Tax Court in the federal judiciary) or by other means, such as small claims courts in many states for civil cases with a low amount in controversy. Other trials do not take place in courts at all, but in quasi-judicial bodies or in administrative agencies with adjudicatory power created by statute to make binding determinations with simplified procedural practices, such as arbitration. The United States Supreme Court is primarily an appellate court, but has original jurisdiction in cases involving a diplomatic official or a state.

Because different U.S. states apply different names to their courts, it is often not evident whether a court has general or limited jurisdiction or indeed is a trial court at all. For instance, the Maine District Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, but the Nevada District Courts are courts of general jurisdiction. Likewise, the Delaware Court of Common Pleas is a court of limited jurisdiction, but the Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas are courts of general jurisdiction. Similarly, the California Superior Courts are trial courts of general jurisdiction, but the Superior Court of Pennsylvania is an appellate court, and the New Jersey Superior Court is both.

<text>Archibald Scott Couper (; 31 March 1831 – 11 March 1892) was a Scottish chemist who proposed an early theory of chemical structure and bonding. He developed the concepts of tetravalent carbon atoms linking together to form large molecules, and that the bonding order of the atoms in a molecule can be determined from chemical evidence.

== Life and work ==
Couper was the only surviving son of a wealthy textile mill owner near Glasgow. He studied at the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh and intermittently in Germany during the years 1851-54. He began the formal study of chemistry at the University of Berlin in the autumn of 1854, then in 1856 entered Charles Adolphe Wurtz&#x27;s private laboratory at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris (now the University of Paris V: René Descartes).

Couper published his &quot;New Chemical Theory&quot; in French in a condensed form on 14 June 1858, then in detailed papers simultaneously in French and English in August 1858. Couper&#x27;s idea that carbon atoms can link to each other following valence regularities was independent of a paper by August Kekulé proposing the same concept. (Kekulé had already proposed the tetravalence of carbon in 1857.) However, through a misunderstanding with Wurtz, Kekulé&#x27;s paper appeared in print first, in May 1858, and so Kekulé captured the priority for the discovery of the self-linking of carbon atoms. When Couper angrily confronted Wurtz, Wurtz expelled him from the laboratory.

In December 1858, Couper received an offer of an assistantship from the University of Edinburgh. However, Couper&#x27;s health began to decline after his disappointment. In May 1859 he suffered a nervous breakdown, and entered an institution as a private patient. Released in July 1859, he almost immediately suffered a relapse—it was said to have been from sunstroke—and was treated again until November 1862. But his health was now broken, and he did no more serious work, spending the last 30 years of his life in the care of his mother.

Couper&#x27;s research differed from Kekulé&#x27;s in several ways. He was open to the idea of divalent carbon, which Kekulé was not. He provided many more resolved formulas in his paper than Kekulé had, and in two cases even suggested (hetero)cyclical formulas, which could have influenced Kekulé in his later suggestion of the benzene ring. Couper adopted the atomic weight of oxygen as 8 rather than 16, so there are twice as many oxygen atoms in Couper&#x27;s formulas as in those of Kekulé. Finally, Couper used dotted lines or dashes between the atoms in his formulas, approximating the appearance of later formula styles. In this respect, his work was probably influential on the early structural theorists Aleksandr Butlerov and Alexander Crum Brown.

<doc id="306971" wikidata="Q467879" url="?curid=306971" title="Elie Hobeika">
<text>Elie Hobeika (also transliterated as Hubayqa; ; 22 September 1956 – 24 January 2002) was a Lebanese militia commander in the Lebanese Forces militia during the Lebanese Civil War and one of Bachir Gemayel&#x27;s close confidants. He became infamous for his overseeing of the 1982 Sabra and Shatilla massacre. Hobeika initially supported the IDF during their invasion, but later switched sides and supported the Syrians. He became president of the Lebanese Forces political party until he was ousted in 1986. He then founded the Promise Party and was elected to serve two terms in the Parliament of Lebanon. In January 2002, he was assassinated in a car bombing at his house in Beirut, shortly before he was to testify about the Sabra and Shatila massacre in a Belgian court.

==Early life==
Hobeika was born in Qleiat in Keserwan District, Lebanon, to a Maronite family on 22 September 1956. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he was deeply influenced by the deaths of much of his family and his fiancée by Palestinian militiamen in the Damour massacre of 1976.

== Lebanese Civil War ==
Hobeika distinguished himself as a ruthless fighter in the Lebanese Civil War, gaining the nickname &quot;HK&quot; after the Heckler &amp; Koch machine gun he carried. In July 1977, Hobeika, then only known under the pseudonym &quot;Chef Edward&quot;, led a massacre against civilians and Palestinian people in the south Lebanese village of Yarin where about 80 people of which probably 20 to 30 were civilians were lined up in front of the school and shot.

He steadily became prominent in the Phalange, part of the pro-Christian Kataeb Party, which had defeated rival Christian militias by July 1980 and incorporated them into the Lebanese Forces (LF). In 1978, Hobeika became head of the LF&#x27;s security agency (&quot;Jihaz al-Amn&quot;). He also became a personal bodyguard of Bachir Gemayel. In the years that followed, he developed close ties with both the Israeli military and the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

During Israel&#x27;s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Hobeika was the liaison officer to Mossad. On 15 September, following the assassination of President-elect Bachir Gemayel the previous day, the Israeli army took over West Beirut. Minister of Defence Ariel Sharon and Chief of Staff General Raful Eitan had decided that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would not enter the Palestinian refugee camps but this task should be undertaken by Lebanese Christian militias. On the night of 16 September 1982, Hobeika, then 25, was on the top floor of the Israeli forward command post, when the first 150 militiamen entered the Sabra and Shatila camps, which had been evacuated by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) at the beginning of September. Two hours after the first Phalangist force entered Shatila, one of the militiamen radioed Hobeika asking what to do with 50 women and children they had taken prisoner. Hobeika&#x27;s response was overheard by an Israeli officer, who testified that Hobeika replied: &quot;This is the last time you&#x27;re going to ask me a question like that; you know exactly what to do.&quot; Other Phalangists on the roof started laughing. Brigadier General Amos Yaron asked Lieutenant Elul, Chef de Bureau of the Divisional Commander, what the laughter was about and Elul translated what Hobeika had said. Yaron then had a five-minute conversation, in English, with Hobeika. What was said is unknown. Over the next three days, the LF killed between 762 and 3,500 residents of the camp. Until 1985, Hobeika sided with Israel. However, then he began to support Syria&#x27;s presence in Lebanon.

Hobeika was involved in another incident in March 1985. The CIA reportedly paid Hobeika (through Lebanese army intelligence officers) to assassinate Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual leader of the militant Shi&#x27;ite group Hezbollah, because Fadlallah was considered by US officials to have taken part in planning the October 1983 bombing of the US marine barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 servicemen. However, the assassination attempt was unsuccessful in that the car bombing near Fadlallah&#x27;s residence killed around 80 bystanders, but left Fadlallah unscathed. The massacre led the CIA to terminate its relationship with Hobeika and gave Hezbollah a lasting grudge against him.

In December 1985, the various Christian militias, the Shiite Amal Movement and the Druze Progressive Socialist Party met in Damascus to reach an agreement on political reforms as well as special relations with Syria, called the Tripartite Accord, which would also end the civil war. Hobeika was there in his capacity as president of the LF. However, on 15 January 1986, President Amine Gemayel and Samir Geagea organised a coup against Hobeika, thus rendering the agreement null and void. Geagea was especially displeased that Hobeika had changed his allegiance to Syria.

After this event, Hobeika fled to Zahle and then to West Beirut. He established a political movement there, the Promise Party. In 1990, his forces fought with the Syrian forces against General Michael Aoun. After the civil war ended following the Taif Agreement, Hobeika benefited in 1991 from an amnesty for crimes committed during the war.

In June 2001, Chibli Mallat, a left-wing Maronite lawyer, filed a case against Ariel Sharon in Belgium under a law that allowed foreigners to be sued for crimes against humanity. Just before his death, Hobeika publicly declared his intention to testify against Sharon about his involvement in the Sabra and Shatila massacres in the Belgian court. Josy Dubié, a Belgian senator, was quoted as saying that Hobeika had told him several days before his death that he had &quot;revelations&quot; to disclose about the massacres and felt &quot;threatened&quot;. When Dubié had asked him why he did not reveal all the facts he knew immediately, Hobeika is reported to have said: &quot;I am saving them for the trial&quot;. At a news conference, he said, &quot;I am very interested that the [Belgian] trial starts because my innocence is a core issue.&quot;

==Political career==

As head of the Promise Party, Hobeika was elected to Parliament in 1992 and in 1996. During his term in the Parliament, he served in several ministerial positions: Minister of State for Emigrants&#x27; Affairs (May 1992-October 1992); Minister of State for Social Affairs and the Handicapped (October 1992-September 1994) and Minister of Water Resources and Electricity (June 1993-December 1998). When he was Minister of Water Resources and Electricity, massive power projects were constructed in Baddawi and Zahrani, Zouk and Baalbeck, and the size of the electrical grid was greatly increased, including the outlying areas still in turmoil with Israeli Forces in the south. However, progress was too slow compared to the massive increase the nation&#x27;s power consumption, as few electrical projects were completed over 18 years of civil unrest. In 2000, Hobeika lost his parliament seat.

==Personal life==
Hobeika married Gina Raymond Nachaty in 1981. They had a daughter, who died in infancy, and a son, Joseph.

== Assassination ==
Hobeika was killed on 24 January 2002 at the age of 45 when a car bomb detonated near his house in the Beirut suburb of Hazmiyeh. The explosion killed his three bodyguards as well, and wounded six more people.

===Perpetrators===
A group, Lebanese for a Free and Independent Lebanon, issued a statement after the assassination, claiming responsibility for the killing of Hobeika. The group announced that it killed Hobeika, since he was a &quot;Syrian agent&quot; and an &quot;effective tool&quot; in the hands of Ghazi Kenaan, the then head of Syrian military intelligence.

Lebanese and Arab commentators blamed Israel for the murder of Hobeika, with alleged Israeli motive that Hobeika would be &quot;apparently poised to testify before the Belgian court about Sharon&#x27;s role in the Sabra and Shatila massacre&quot;. Prior to his assassination, Elie Hobeika had stated: &quot;I am very interested that the [Belgian] trial starts because my innocence is a core issue.&quot;

Others have speculated that Syrian intelligence assassinated Hobeika, who had &quot;specifically stated that he did not plan to identify Sharon as being responsible for Sabra and Shatila&quot;, to prevent him from testifying on Syria&#x27;s involvement in the massacre.

===Condemnation===
President Emile Lahoud and Hezbollah condemned the assassination of Hobeika and blamed Israel.

<doc id="306977" wikidata="Q4148977" url="?curid=306977" title="Fungi from Yuggoth">
<text>Fungi from Yuggoth is a sequence of 36 sonnets by cosmic horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. Most of the sonnets were written between 27 December 1929 – 4 January 1930; thereafter individual sonnets appeared in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and other genre magazines. The sequence was published complete in &quot;Beyond the Wall of Sleep&quot; (Sauk City, Wisconsin: Arkham House, 1943, 395–407) and &quot;The Ancient Track: The Complete Poetical Works of H. P. Lovecraft&quot; (San Francisco: Night Shade Books, 2001, 64–79; expanded 2nd ed, NY Hippocampus Press, 2013). Ballantine Books’ mass paperback edition, &quot;Fungi From Yuggoth &amp; Other Poems&quot; (Random House, New York, 1971) included other poetic works.

The sequence has been printed in several different versions as standalone chapbooks. In June 1943, Bill Evans (Washington DC) issued a separate appearance which lacked the final three sonnets. In 1977 Necronomicon Press, (West Warwick, RI) issued the complete sequence as &quot;The Fungi from Yuggoth&quot; (475 numbered copies). This may have been the first time that the sequence was published in its corrected text. The same press went on to reissue it with new cover artwork by Jason Eckhardt in limited editions from 1982 onwards and other illustrated editions from different presses were to follow. In 2017 came a limited annotated edition of the sequence with illustrations by Jason Eckhardt for each poem (Hippocampus Press, New York).
Lovecraft is known chiefly as a writer of genre fiction, several themes from which are reflected in his sonnet sequence. But the restrained style of the verse there so distinguishes it from the prose work that, in the view of some commentators, it &quot;deserves to be more widely known and appreciated&quot; for its own poetic merits. The work later appealed to musicians and there have been several settings of poems from it in a variety of genres.

==Style==
&quot;Fungi from Yuggoth&quot; represents a marked departure from the mannered poems Lovecraft had been writing up to this point. Sending a copy of &quot;Recapture&quot; (which just predates the sequence but was later incorporated into it) the poet remarks that it is “illustrative of my efforts to practice what I preach regarding direct and unaffected diction”. He also describes it as “a sort of irregular semi-sonnet, based on an actual dream”. The sonnets that followed were hybrid in form insofar as they are partly based on the Petrarchan approach but invariably end with a rhyming couplet (as in the so-called Shakespearean sonnet) “contrived to provide an element of surprise in the final line”.

Varying opinions have been expressed in the critical literature on Lovecraft as to whether the poems form a continuous cycle which tells a story, or whether each individual sonnet is discrete. (See essays in Bibliography below by Boerem, Ellis, Schultz, Vaughan and Waugh). Phillip A. Ellis, in his essay &quot;Unity in Diversity: &quot;Fungi from Yuggoth&quot; as a Unified Setting&quot;, discusses this problem and suggests a solution. S. T. Joshi considers that apart from the first three sonnets, &quot;the remaining poems, which HPL considered suitable for publication independent of the introductory poems, are discontinuous vignettes concerning a variety of unrelated weird themes, told in the first person and (apparently) third person. The cumulative effect is that of a series of shifting dream images.&quot;

==Themes==
The first three poems in the sequence concern a person who obtains an ancient book of esoteric knowledge that seems to allow one to travel to parallel realities or strange parts of the universe. Later poems deal more with an atmosphere of cosmic horror, or create a mood of being shut out from former felicity, and do not have a strong narrative through-line except occasionally over a couple of sonnets (e.g. 17–18). In that the sequence starts by seeming to provide &#x27;the key&#x27; to the author&#x27;s &#x27;vague visions&#x27; (Sonnet 3) of other realities behind the everyday, it might be argued that the poems that follow, though disparate in themselves, detail a succession of such visions that a reading of the book releases. With one or two exceptions, the concluding poems from &quot;Expectancy&quot; (28) onward seek to explain the circumstances of the narrator&#x27;s sense of alienation within the present. Rather than visions themselves, these poems serve as a commentary on their source.

The sonnets see-saw between various themes in much the same way as do Lovecraft&#x27;s short stories. There are references to the author&#x27;s night terrors in &quot;Recognition&quot; (4), a potent source for his later fiction and carrying forward into dream poems related to his Dunsany manner; to intimations of an Elder Race on earth; and to nightmare beings from Beyond. That these themes often cross-fertilize each other is suggested by &quot;Star Winds&quot; (14), which taken purely by itself is an exercise in Dunsanian dream-lore. However, beginning in the month after finishing his sequence, Lovecraft set to work on his story &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; (1931) where Yuggoth is recreated as a planet of fungoid beings given the name of Mi-go. In the sonnet, the fungi sprout in a location called Yuggoth, not on an alien planet; and in its following line Nithon is described as a world with richly flowering continents rather than, as in the story, Yuggoth&#x27;s occulted moon. This is a good instance of how Lovecraft gave himself license to be self-contradictory and vary his matter according to the artistic need of the moment, of which the diversity of conflicting situations within the whole sequence of sonnets is itself an example. Or, as he himself puts it in &quot;Star Winds&quot;,

:::Yet for each dream these winds to us convey,
:::A dozen more of ours they sweep away!

In addition to &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot;, the cycle references other works by Lovecraft and introduces a number of ideas that he would expand upon in later works.
* The town of Innsmouth is mentioned in sonnets VIII (&quot;The Port&quot;) and XIX (&quot;The Bells&quot;)
* The story told in sonnet XII (&quot;The Howler&quot;) presages &quot;The Dreams in the Witch House&quot; (1932). Its description of the witch&#x27;s familiar, described as &quot;a four-pawed thing with human face,&quot; echoes the description of Brown Jenkin, a rat-like creature with a human face.
* Sonnet XV references the ancient city in his story &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; (1931) and hints at the Elder Things inhabiting it.
* Sonnet XX names both the Nightgaunts from &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot; and the Shoggoths from &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;.
* Sonnets XXI and XXII respectively are named for and concern the Outer Gods Nyarlathotep and Azathoth.
*Sonnet XXVI deals with events preceding those in &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; (1929).
*Sonnet XXVII references the Plateau of Leng, mentioned in many of Lovecraft&#x27;s works, and the masked Old One from Robert W. Chambers&#x27; &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;.

<doc id="306981" wikidata="Q950128" url="?curid=306981" title="Lee Trevino">
<text>Lee Buck Trevino (born December 1, 1939) is an American retired professional golfer who is regarded as one of the greatest players in golf history. He was inducted to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1981. Trevino won six major championships and 29 PGA Tour events over the course of his career. He is one of only four players to twice win the U.S. Open, The Open Championship and the PGA Championship. The Masters Tournament was the only major that eluded him. He is an icon for Mexican Americans, and is often referred to as &quot;the Merry Mex&quot; and &quot;Supermex,&quot; both affectionate nicknames given to him by other golfers.

==Early life==
Trevino was born in Garland, Texas, into a family of Mexican ancestry. He was raised by his mother, Juanita Trevino, and his grandfather, Joe Trevino, a gravedigger. Trevino never knew his father, Joseph Trevino, who left when his son was small. During his childhood, Trevino occasionally attended school and worked to earn money for the family. At age 5, he started working in the cotton fields.

Trevino was introduced to golf when his uncle gave him a few golf balls and an old golf club. He then spent his free time sneaking into nearby country clubs to practice and began as a caddie at the Dallas Athletic Club, near his home. He soon began caddying full-time. Trevino left school at age 14 to go to work. He earned $30 a week as a caddie and shoe shiner. He was also able to practice golf since the caddies had three short holes behind their shack. After work, he would hit at least 300 balls. Many of these practice shots were struck from the bare ground with very little grass (known locally as &#x27;Texas hardpan&#x27;) and often in very windy conditions. It is this that is widely believed to be the reason Trevino developed his extremely distinct, unique (many would say unorthodox), and compact swing method, which he went on to develop with tremendous effect. A very pronounced controlled &quot;fade&quot; was his signature shot, although he had many other shot types in his repertoire and he is, still to this day, remembered as one of the very finest shot-makers of all time.

When Trevino turned 17 in December 1956, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, and served four years as a machine gunner and was discharged in December 1960 as a corporal with the 3rd Marine Division. He spent part of his time playing golf with Marine Corps officers. He played successfully in Armed Forces golf events in Asia, where one rival was Orville Moody, who would follow Trevino to the PGA Tour in the late 1960s.

==Professional career==
After Trevino was discharged from the Marines, he went to work as a club professional in El Paso, Texas. He made extra money by gambling for stakes in head-to-head matches. He qualified for the U.S. Open in 1966, made the cut, and tied for 54th, earning $600. He qualified again in 1967 and shot 283 (+3), eight shots behind champion Jack Nicklaus, and only four behind runner-up Arnold Palmer. Trevino earned $6,000 for finishing fifth, which earned him Tour privileges for the rest of the 1967 season. He won $26,472 as a rookie, 45th on the PGA Tour money list, and was named &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; by &quot;Golf Digest&quot;. The fifth-place finish at the U.S. Open also earned him an exemption into the following year&#x27;s event.

In 1968, his second year on the circuit, Trevino won the U.S. Open at Oak Hill Country Club, in Rochester, New York, four strokes ahead of runner-up Nicklaus, the defending champion. His rounds of 69-68-69-69 was the first time 70 was broken in all 4 rounds of a U.S. Open. During his career, Trevino won 29 times on the PGA Tour, including six majors. He was at his best in the early 1970s, when he was Jack Nicklaus&#x27;s chief rival. He won the money list title in 1970, and had six wins in 1971 and four wins in 1972.

Trevino had a remarkable string of victories during a 20-day span in the summer of 1971. He defeated Nicklaus in an 18-hole playoff to win the 1971 U.S. Open. Two weeks later, he won the Canadian Open (the first of three), and the following week won The Open Championship (British Open), becoming the first player to win those three titles in the same year. Trevino was awarded the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of 1971. He also won &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; and was named ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; Athlete of the Year.

In 1972 at Muirfield in Scotland, Trevino became the first player to successfully defend The Open Championship since Arnold Palmer in 1962. In a remarkable third round at Muirfield, Trevino had five consecutive birdies from the 14th through the 18th, holing a bunker shot on the 16th and sinking a 30–foot chip on the 18th for a round of 66. In the final round, Trevino was tied for the lead on the 17th tee with Tony Jacklin. Trevino chipped in from rough on the back of the green for a par on the 17th. A shaken Jacklin three-putted the same hole from 15 feet for a bogey. Trevino parred the 18th hole for a final round of 71, winning him the Open by a stroke over Nicklaus, with Jacklin finishing third. Trevino holed out four times from off the greens during the tournament. Nicklaus had won the first two majors of the year (Masters, U.S. Open) and fell just short in the third leg of the grand slam. After holing his chip shot on the 17th in the final round, Trevino said: &quot;I&#x27;m the greatest chipper in the world.&quot;

In 1974, Trevino won the Greater New Orleans Open without scoring any bogeys, the only time it had happened in a PGA Tour individual event until J. T. Poston accomplished the feat at the 2019 Wyndham Championship. At the PGA Championship he won the fifth of his six major championships. He won the title by a stroke, again over Nicklaus, the fourth and final time Nicklaus was a runner-up in a major to Trevino. At the Western Open near Chicago in 1975, Trevino was struck by lightning, and suffered injuries to his spine. He underwent surgery to remove a damaged spinal disk, but back problems continued to hamper his play. Nevertheless, he was ranked second in McCormack&#x27;s World Golf Rankings in 1980 behind Tom Watson. Trevino had 3 PGA Tour wins in 1980 and finished runner-up to Tom Watson in the 1980 Open Championship. At the age of 44, Trevino won his sixth and final major at the PGA Championship in 1984, with a 15-under-par score of 273, becoming the first player to shoot all four rounds under 70 in the PGA Championship. He was the runner-up the following year in 1985, attempting to become the first repeat champion since Denny Shute in 1937.
In the early 1980s, Trevino was second on the PGA Tour&#x27;s career money list, behind only Nicklaus. From 1968 to 1981 inclusive, Trevino won at least one PGA Tour event a year, a streak of 14 seasons. He also won more than 20 international and unofficial professional tournaments. He was one of the charismatic stars who was instrumental in making the Senior PGA Tour (now the PGA Tour Champions) an early success. He claimed 29 senior wins, including four senior majors. He topped the seniors&#x27; money list in 1990 and 1992.

Like many American stars of the era, Trevino played a considerable amount overseas. Early in his career he played sporadically on the Australasian Tour. He finished runner-up in the 1969 and 1970 Dunlop International and ultimately won down under at the 1973 Chrysler Classic. He also won an event on the Japan Golf Tour, the Casio World Open in 1981. Trevino also had a great deal of success in Europe. Among his greatest triumphs were at the 1971 Open Championship and 1972 Open Championship. Trevino was also invited to play at the very prestigious (though unofficial) Piccadilly World Match Play Championship three times (1968, 1970, 1972). He reached the finals twice. His most notable performance probably came in 1970 when he defeated defending Masters champion Billy Casper in the quarterfinals and defending PGA champion Dave Stockton in the semifinals. He also won two regular European Tour events late in his career at 1978 Benson &amp; Hedges International Open and 1985 Dunhill British Masters. In fact, his last regular tour win was at the British Masters. Additionally, he finished runner-up at three European Tour events: the 1980 Bob Hope British Classic, 1980 Open Championship, and the 1986 Benson &amp; Hedges International Open.

From 1983 to 1989, he worked as a color analyst for PGA Tour coverage on NBC television. In 2014 Trevino was named &quot;Golf Professional Emeritus&quot; at The Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, a position previously held by Sam Snead and Tom Watson.

===Masters Tournament===
At the Masters Tournament in 1989, 49-year-old Trevino opened with a bogey-free five-under-par 67 to become the oldest to lead the field after a round in the tournament. It came despite Trevino&#x27;s words twenty years earlier, when he said after the 1969 edition: &quot;Don&#x27;t talk to me about the Masters. I&#x27;m never going to play there again. They can invite me all they want, but I&#x27;m not going back. It&#x27;s just not my type of course.&quot; Trevino said that he felt uncomfortable with the atmosphere at Augusta National and that he disliked the course because his style of play, where he liked to fade low shots left to right, was not suited to the course.

Trevino did not accept invitations to the Masters in 1970, 1971, and 1974. In 1972, after forgoing the previous two Masters tournaments, he stored his shoes and other items in the trunk of his car, rather than use the locker room facilities in the clubhouse. Trevino complained that had he not qualified as a player, the club would not have let him onto the grounds except through the kitchen. But he later described his boycott of the Masters as &quot;the greatest mistake I&#x27;ve made in my career&quot; and called Augusta National &quot;the eighth wonder of the world.&quot;

After his opening round 67 in 1989, Trevino tied for eighteenth; his best career result at the Masters was a tie for tenth (1975, 1985).

==Humor==
Throughout his career, Trevino was seen as approachable and humorous, and was frequently quoted by the press. Late in his career, he remarked, &quot;I played the tour in 1967 and told jokes and nobody laughed. Then I won the Open the next year, told the same jokes, and everybody laughed like hell.&quot;

At the beginning of Trevino&#x27;s 1971 U.S. Open playoff against Jack Nicklaus, he threw a rubber snake that his daughter had put in his bag as a joke at Nicklaus, who later admitted that he asked Trevino to throw it to him so he could see it. Trevino grabbed the rubbery object and playfully tossed it at Nicklaus, getting a scream from a nearby woman and a hearty laugh from Nicklaus. Trevino shot a 68 to defeat Nicklaus by three strokes.

During one tournament, Tony Jacklin, paired with Trevino, said: &quot;Lee, I don&#x27;t want to talk today.&quot; Trevino retorted: &quot;I don&#x27;t want you to talk. I just want you to listen.&quot;

Trevino made a notable cameo appearance in the comedy &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;, appearing in several scenes where he&#x27;s a witness to Happy&#x27;s anger outbursts, always shaking his head in shocked disapproval. His only spoken line is when the movie&#x27;s antagonist, Shooter McGavin, says to Happy in sarcasm, &quot;Yeah, right, and Grizzly Adams had a beard,&quot; to which an unexpected Trevino appears and says to McGavin, &quot;Grizzly Adams &quot;did&quot; have a beard.&quot; Trevino would later regret appearing in the film, due to the amount of swearing.

After he was struck by lightning at the 1975 Western Open, Trevino was asked by a reporter what he would do if he were out on the course and it began to storm again. Trevino answered he would take out his 1-iron and point it to the sky, &quot;because not even God can hit a 1-iron.&quot; Trevino said later in an interview with David Feherty that he must have tempted God the week before by staying outside during a lightning delay to entertain the crowds, saying &quot;I deserved to get hit...God can hit a 1-iron.&quot;

Trevino said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been hit by lightning and been in the Marine Corps for four years. I&#x27;ve traveled the world and been about everywhere you can imagine. There&#x27;s not anything I&#x27;m scared of except my wife.&quot;

<text>A lower court or inferior court is a court from which an appeal may be taken, usually referring to courts other than supreme court. In relation to an appeal from one court to another, the lower court is the court whose decision is being reviewed, which may be the original trial court or some of appellate court lower in rank than the supreme court which is hearing the appeal. In other words, lower courts are &#x27;lower&#x27; in hierarchical chain of appellate procedure than other higher appellate courts. Usually it is obligation of a lower court to follow the decision of higher appellate court, even in civil law countries where precedents have no binding power.

Some common law countries use term &quot;lower court&quot; or &quot;inferior court&quot; as antonym for &quot;superior court&quot;, meaning such lower courts have only limited jurisdiction according to importance of case (usually decided by monetary amount of claims). For information on this kind of courts, see Small claims court and superior court.

<doc id="306991" wikidata="Q527814" url="?curid=306991" title="Protestant Union">
<text>The Protestant Union (), also known as the Evangelical Union, Union of Auhausen, German Union or the Protestant Action Party, was a coalition of Protestant German states. It was formed on 14 May 1608 by Frederick IV, Elector Palatine in order to defend the rights, land and safety of each member. It included both Calvinist and Lutheran states, and dissolved in 1621.
==Formation==
The union was formed following two events. Firstly, the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II and Bavarian Duke Maximilian I reestablished Catholicism in Donauwörth in 1607. Secondly, by 1608, a majority of the Imperial Diet had decided that the renewal of the 1555 Peace of Augsburg should be conditional upon the restoration of all church land appropriated since 1552. The Protestant princes met in Auhausen, and formed a coalition of Protestant states under the leadership of Frederick IV on 14 May 1608. In response, the Catholic League organized the following year, headed by Duke Maximilian.
==Membership==
Members of the Protestant Union included the Palatinate, Neuburg, Württemberg, Baden-Durlach, Ansbach, Bayreuth, Anhalt, Zweibrücken, Oettingen, Hesse-Kassel, Brandenburg, and the free cities of Ulm, Strasbourg, Nuremberg, Rothenburg, Windsheim, Schweinfurt, Weissenburg, Nördlingen, Schwäbisch Hall, Heilbronn, Memmingen, Kempten, Landau, Worms, Speyer, Aalen and Giengen.
==Strife between Lutherans and Calvinists==
However, the Protestant Union was weakened from the start by the non-participation of several powerful German Protestant rulers, notably the Elector of Saxony. The Union was also beset by internal strife between its Lutheran and Calvinist members.
==Disbandment by order of Ferdinand II==
In 1619, Frederick V of the Palatinate accepted the crown of Bohemia in opposition to Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. On 3 July 1620 the Protestant Union signed the Treaty of Ulm (), declaring neutrality and declining to support Frederick V. In January 1621, Ferdinand II imposed an imperial ban upon Frederick V and moved his right to elect an emperor to Maximilian. Electoral Palatinate also lost the Upper Palatinate to Bavaria. The Protestant Union met in Heilbronn in February and formally protested Ferdinand&#x27;s actions. He ignored this complaint and ordered the Protestant Union to disband its army. The members of the union complied with Ferdinand&#x27;s demand under the Mainz accord in May, and on 14 May 1621 it was formally dissolved.
==Replacement by the Heilbronn League==
A new separate union without connection to this one emerged twelve years later, the Heilbronn League. It allied some Protestant states in western, central and southern Germany, and fought against the Holy Roman Emperor under the guidance of Sweden and France, which were at the same time parties to that league.

==Guidelines of the Protestant Union==

Intending to strengthen the security provided by the Peace of Augsburg, Protestants formed the union in 1608. Its leaders created guidelines and agreements to live by as follows:
#Each member shall keep in good faith with the order and their heirs, land and people, and no one shall enter into any other alliance.
#Each member of the union should keep a secret correspondence effectively to inform each other of all dangerous and offensive affairs which may threaten each other&#x27;s heirs, land and people, and to this purpose each will keep in good contact with one another.
#Whenever important matters arise that concern the well-being of the union, the members of the union will help each other with faithful advice in order to uphold each and every one as much as possible.
#The wish of the union in matters concerning the liberties and high jurisdictions of the German Electors and Estates should be presented and pressed at subsequent Imperial and Imperial Circle assemblies, and not merely left to secret correspondence with each other.
#The union shall not affect our disagreement on several points of religion, but that notwithstanding these, we have agreed to support each other. No member is to allow an attack on any other in books or through the pulpit, nor give cause for any breach of the peace, while at the same time leaving untouched the theologian&#x27;s rights of disputation to affirm the word of God.
#If one of the members of the union is attacked, the remaining members of the union shall immediately come to his aid with all the resources of the union.

==Timeline==
In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg was signed by Charles V and Lutheran princes. This treaty gave Roman Catholic and Lutheran princes the freedom to decide the religion which their respective state would be under, but gave no such protection to Calvinist princes. In 1608, Protestant princes formed the alliance known as Protestant Union. The next year, the Catholic League was created. In 1610, the Union intervened in the War of the Jülich Succession. In 1618, the Thirty Years&#x27; War began with the outbreak of the Bohemian Revolt. Frederick V, Elector Palatine, accepted the crown of Bohemia the following year. The Union declared its neutrality in the conflict between Frederick and the Catholic League in the 1620 Treaty of Ulm. The Union dissolved the next year.

<text>Uloboridae is a family of non-venomous spiders, known as cribellate orb weavers or hackled orb weavers. Their lack of venom glands is a secondarily evolved trait. Instead, they wrap their prey thoroughly in silk, cover it in regurgitated digestive enzymes, and then ingest the liquified body.

== Description ==
They are medium to large spiders, with three claws, which lack venomous glands. They build a spiral web using cribellate silk, which is quite fuzzy. They are usually dull in color, and are able to camouflage well into their surroundings. They typically have a humped opisthosoma, which is notoriously more humped than the carapace. Their rear eyes tend to curve, more so in some species than others. Most uloborid spiders have eight eyes, but the genus &quot;Miagrammopes&quot; has only four.

== Hunting ==
The hunting method of these spiders is quite unique among all animals in the kingdom. These spiders do not use an adhesive on their orb webs, but rather the very fine cribellate fibers on each strand of silk tend to ensnare prey. Since newly hatched uloborids lack the cribellum needed to produce cribellate sticky silk, their webs have a fundamentally different structure with a large number of fine radii, but no sticky spiral. Some spiders only build a single line web, while others make more complex webs. They lack venom glands, which is very rare among spiders. They first catch their prey, using their silk. They wrap their prey, and severely compress it, then they cover the prey with digestive fluid. Oddly enough, their mouthparts never touch the prey. The spider starts ingesting as soon as the prey has been covered. It is thought that robust hairs protect the spider from the digestive fluids. It is unknown how this behavior first evolved.

== Social behavior ==
Some species are able to form colonies like &quot;Philoponella republicana&quot;, which make large, messy, communal webs. Colonies may range from a couple of individuals to a couple hundred. These colonies may be nymph dominated or adult dominated, though a small colony dominated by adults could be a sign of the colony&#x27;s slow death. These colonies show signs of being female dominated, as one would expect, with males only being found in larger colonies. This could mean males search for larger colonies, or had died out in the smaller colonies.

==Distribution==
This family has an almost worldwide distribution. Only two species are known from Northern Europe: &quot;Uloborus walckenaerius&quot; and &quot;Hyptiotes paradoxus&quot;. The oldest known fossil species is &quot;Talbragaraneus&quot; from the Late Jurassic (Tithonian) Talbragar Fossil Bed of Australia.

<doc id="307004" wikidata="Q285418" url="?curid=307004" title="Flag of Michigan">
<text>The flag of the state of Michigan is a coat of arms set on a dark blue field, as set forth by Michigan state law. The governor has a variant of the flag with a white field instead of blue one. The state has an official flag month from June 14 through July 14.

==Design==

The state coat of arms depicts a blue shield, upon which the sun rises over a lake and peninsula, and a man with a raised hand, representing peace and holding a long gun, representing the fight for state and nation as a frontier state.

As supporters, the elk and moose are derived from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company coat of arms, and depict great animals of Michigan. The bald eagle represents the United States, which formed the state of Michigan from the Northwest Territory.

The design features three Latin mottos. From top-to-bottom they are:
#On red ribbon: (), a motto of the United States.
#On light blue shield: ()
#On white ribbon: (), the official state motto.

It is one of nine U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wyoming.

==History==
The present flag, adopted in 1911, is the fourth state flag. The first flag featured a portrait of Michigan&#x27;s first governor, Stevens T. Mason, on one side and the state coat of arms on the other. The first flag is completely lost, and no images of it exist, as far as anyone knows. The second flag, adopted in 1865, displayed the state coat of arms on one side and the United States coat of arms on the other. On August 4th, 1886 the third state flag was carried in a parade in San Fransisco by a group of Michiganders, it contained the state coat of arms.

The North American Vexillological Association, in its 2001 survey of U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags rated the current Michigan flag 59th out of 72 flags evaluated. The survey respondents gave an average score of just 3.46 out of a possible 10 points.

In November 2016, a bill was introduced in the Michigan state legislature by Senator Steven Bieda that would have provided for a flag commission to head up a public design contest to change the current state flag, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. Establishing a flag commission was proposed again in 2021, by Representative Andrea Schroeder. The measure was referred to committee, where no action was taken on it.

In 2023, representative Phil Skaggs proposed a bill to redesign the state flag. It was introduced as House Bill 6190, on November 26, 2024, read a first time and referred to the Committee on Government Operations. The Bill seeks to form a commission of 6 local university artists, 3 professional artists or state historians selected by the Michigan Historical Commission and 8 political appointees to establish a contest to receive public design submissions between January 26, 2025 and July 26, 2025. The flag commission would have selected a winner by September 26th 2025, and the winning submission would have replaced the current state flag on January 1, 2026. As no action was taken on HB 6190 before the end of the legislative session, this bill was also unsuccessful.

==Pledge==
Michigan&#x27;s pledge of allegiance to the state flag was written by Harold G. Coburn and was officially adopted in 1972.

<text>James Maritato (born March 12, 1972) is an American professional wrestler, best known for his work in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under the ring names Little Guido and Nunzio. A high-school football player and amateur wrestler, he trained under Billy Robinson, making his professional debut in the early nineties. He joined Eastern Championship Wrestling initially as an enhancement talent, as well as competing in the shoot style UWF International promotion. Maritato later returned to ECW (now Extreme Championship Wrestling), being given the gimmick of “Little Guido” as part of the comedy stable the Full Blooded Italians (F.B.I). He would stay with the promotion until its closure in January 2001.

After ECW closed its doors, Maritato worked on the independent circuit before he was signed to a contract by WWE in 2002. There he was part of the promotion’s cruiserweight division until its disbandment in 2007, as well as a new version of the F.B.I Stable. He would take part in the ECW One Night Stand events as well as the relaunch of the franchise as a third brand before leaving WWE and returning to the independent circuit.

== Early life ==
While attending Nanuet Senior High School (located in Rockland County, New York), Maritato competed in football (as part of the school&#x27;s 1989 team that went undefeated and unscored upon) and wrestling.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1991–1992) ===
Maritato was trained as a professional wrestler by Billy Robinson. He debuted in 1991, facing Parsippany Smith Fields in his first match. He competed for the Amarillo, Texas-based USWF promotion under the name James Stone.

=== Eastern Championship Wrestling (1992–1994) ===
Maritato joined Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) under the ring name &quot;Damien Stone&quot; on July 14, 1992, where he lost to Tommy Cairo. Over the next two years, he wrestled intermittently with ECW as a jobber. He also wrestled for International World Class Championship Wrestling and other promotions in the Northeastern United States.

=== UWF International (1995-1996) ===
Maritato took some time off from ECW in 1995 and went to Japan to compete in the shoot style UWF International promotion.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996–2001)===

Maritato returned to Eastern Championship Wrestling - by now known as Extreme Championship Wrestling - at the Big Ass Extreme Bash in March 1996. At Massacre on Queens Boulevard in April 1996, &quot;The Italian Stallion&quot; J.T. Smith announced that &quot;Damien Stone&quot; was in fact his Sicilian cousin, &quot;Little Guido&quot;. Smith and Little Guido formed the comedy stable Full Blooded Italians (F.B.I.), which grew to include multiple other members.

During 1999, he became a &quot;serious wrestler&quot;, although still accompanied by Sal E. Graziano and proclaiming himself to be an F.B.I. member (though only the two of them were left). After his turn he was involved in some intense singles matches until late 2000, when he formed a tag team with Tony Mamaluke. The duo won the World Tag Team Championship on August 26, 2000 and held them until December when they lost them to Danny Doring and Roadkill. They continued to wrestle together until ECW folded in January 2001.

=== Independent circuit (2001–2002) ===
When ECW closed, Maritato wrestled for several independent promotions, mostly in the New York Tri-State area; he often teamed with former partner Tony Mamaluke. They had a notable run in Ring of Honor before Maritato was signed by World Wrestling Entertainment in 2002.

=== World Wrestling Entertainment/ WWE (2002–2008, 2010–2011, 2024) ===
====Alliance with Jamie Noble; Full Blooded Italians (2002–2004)====

Maritato was introduced on WWE television as Nunzio (a possible reference to the mob/bodyguard characters Guido and Nunzio in the &quot;MythAdventures&quot; series of books by Robert Asprin). As the on-screen heel cousin of Jamie Noble, he attacked Crash Holly during a match with Noble on the December 12, 2002 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Nunzio began a feud with Holly after this, defeating him on several occasions before going on to face the likes of Tajiri, Shannon Moore, and Chuck Palumbo.

The team and cousin storyline of Nunzio and Noble soon faded. Nunzio reformed the Full Blooded Italians, this time with Johnny &quot;The Bull&quot; Stamboli and Chuck Palumbo, but the team found little success. After WrestleMania XX, Palumbo was drafted to &quot;Raw&quot;, and the F.B.I. was reduced to a tag team. After Stamboli was released, Nunzio began competing in the cruiserweight division.

====Cruiserweight Champion; alliance with Vito (2005–2006)====
In 2005, Maritato returned to his Little Guido persona for one night; he reunited with the original Full Blooded Italians to take on Super Crazy and Tajiri in a three-way match at the ECW reunion show One Night Stand.

As Nunzio, he continued to perform on SmackDown! B-show &quot;Velocity&quot; as both a fan favorite and a villain, forming a short-lived tag team with Funaki. On the August 6 (taped on August 2) edition of &quot;Velocity&quot;, Nunzio won the Cruiserweight Championship by defeating Paul London after a new villainous wrestler, Vito, made his debut by giving Nunzio a blackjack, which he used to knock London out. Nunzio joined forces with Vito, thus becoming a full-time villain.

The pair began feuding with The Mexicools and at No Mercy, Mexicool member Juventud defeated Nunzio with a Juvi Driver to take the Cruiserweight Championship. Nunzio regained the title on November 15 at a house show in Rome, Italy but lost it right back to Juventud on the November 25 &quot;SmackDown&quot;.

Nunzio and Vito would both briefly turn into fan favorites by briefly engaging in a feud against Gregory Helms. Vito and Nunzio would quickly go back to being villains, however, due to Vito&#x27;s new godfather gimmick.

In late-May 2006, Nunzio&#x27;s partnership with Vito began to crumble after it was revealed that, in storyline, Vito enjoyed cross-dressing, which made Nunzio feel betrayed and embarrassed. Nunzio ended his alliance with Vito, and moved to the ECW brand.

====Full Blooded Italians reunion; departure (2006–2008)====

In June when the ECW brand was launched, Nunzio left SmackDown to join other &quot;ECW originals&quot; on &quot;ECW&quot;, retaking his Little Guido name in the process. F.B.I. was revived again, this time with Little Guido as a face once again, alongside Tony Mamaluke and Trinity and for a short while, Big Guido. The F.B.I. were used for tag matches on &quot;ECW&quot; to either take on debuting tag teams or facing another tag team when a tag match was needed. At December to Dismember, they took on Elijah Burke and Sylvester Terkay in a losing effort. His partner Tony Mamaluke was released on January 18, leaving Guido and Trinity alone to carry on the stable.

After Mamaluke&#x27;s release, Little Guido vanished from television (he only appeared once on &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot; with the Little Guido name). After his hiatus, he later returned on the April 17, 2007 episode (in Italy, where he was well received by fans) using his old Nunzio name again but without Trinity, who had been released in June. After losses to the debuting Johnny Nitro and The Miz, Nunzio disappeared from television for a few months. He returned on the September 11 edition of &quot;ECW&quot;, in a losing effort to Matt Striker. Nunzio was used mainly as a jobber during this period, losing to Tommy Dreamer, Jamie Noble, Kevin Thorn, and Kenny Dykstra.

In 2008, Nunzio returned on January 15, in a losing effort against Shelton Benjamin, and on his next appearance, on April 8, he lost to Elijah Burke. He then engaged in a brief feud with Mark Henry, but came out on the losing end. After nearly 2 years, Nunzio finally won a broadcast match on May 5, as he was in a handicap match along with the rest of the ECW roster against Triple H and Mr. Kennedy.

On August 8, 2008, Nunzio was released from his WWE contract.

==== Referee (2010–2011) ====
Maritato appeared at a house show for WWE Raw, at Madison Square Garden on December 26, 2010, as a referee when the majority of referees could not make it to the arena due to blizzards and gale-force winds; this position expanded to televised events on February 1. On September 29, 2011, Maritato announced that he was no longer working for WWE.

==== NXT appearance (2024) ====
At &quot;NXT&quot; 2300 on November 6, 2024, Maritato, as Nunzio, returned to WWE to challenge Tony D&#x27;Angelo for the NXT North American Championship, where Nunzio lost the match.

=== Return to the independent circuit (2008–present) ===

Maritato wrestled for Jersey All Pro Wrestling on September 19. On November 15, he won the JAPW Tag Team Championship with Tracy Smothers. On January 16, 2009, Maritato was inducted into the ECPW Hall of Fame.

In February 2009, it was announced that Maritato would be a trainer for the &quot;Bodyslam U&quot; professional wrestling school in New Jersey, while still competing on the independent circuit. On March 13, 2009, Guido lost to Shane Douglas, who made his return to the National Wrestling Alliance for the first time since Douglas drops the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in nearly fifteen years. In June, Guido returned to Ring of Honor losing to Jay Briscoe at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City. In late 2009, Maritato began competing for the National Wrestling Alliance under the name Nunzio. He also performed for the NWA On Fire expansion based out of New England. Maritato reunited again on October 6, 2012 as F.B.I., being defeated by Danny Doring and Roadkill in the House of Hardcore&#x27;s first show. At House of Hardcore 2, now returning under his &quot;Little Guido&quot; ring name, faced Vik Dalishus in a losing effort. On June 6, 2014, at House of Hardcore 4, Maritato defeated Matt Striker. Maritato wrestled at House of Hardcore&#x27;s next event on June 7, 2014, in which he defeated Danny Doring.

At House of Hardcore 7, Maritato teamed up with Team Tremendous (Bil Carr and Dan Barry) to take on Anthony Greene, Ben Ortiz, and Vik Dalishus in a winning effort. He then took part in a ten-man tag team match at House of Hardcore 10, teaming up with Officer Colt Cabana, Bill Carr, Dan Barry, and F.B.I. member Tony Mamaluke, to successfully defeat Afa Jr., Jade, Lance Anoa&#x27;i, L.A. Smooth, and Vik Dalishus.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling / Impact Wrestling (2010, 2022) ===
On August 8, 2010, Maritato took part in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s ECW reunion show, Hardcore Justice, where he, Tony Mamaluke (billed as Tony Luke) and Tracy Smothers defeated Kid Kash, Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger in a six-man tag team match. On the following edition of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, the ECW alumni, known collectively as Extreme, Version 2.0 (EV 2.0), were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair&#x27;s stable, who thought they didn&#x27;t deserve to be in TNA. The following week TNA president Dixie Carter gave each member of EV 2.0 TNA contracts in order for them to settle their score with . On the August 26 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Guido and Luke were squashed by Roode and Storm in a tag team match. The match ended F.B.I.&#x27;s association with TNA. Maritato was announced as a part of the new Total Nonstop Action India based project Ring Ka King working under the name Tony Broadway teaming with Joey Hollywood. However Ring Ka King only lasted one season and ended the same year.

In 2022, Maritato made an appearance for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, then known as Impact Wrestling, on the April 21 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, challenging Matt Cardona for the Impact Digital Media Championship, where he was unsuccessful.

==Other media==
On March 6, 2006, Maritato was seen supporting his brother on the NBC game show &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; in which he won $25,000. In 1996 Maritato competed in a mixed martial arts fight in Texas against Steve Nelson, who was also his past opponent in UWFi. The fight appears on Nelson&#x27;s official MMA record as a win. Maritato competed under the name James Stone, which he also wrestled under during its stint in UWFi.

<text>The whooper swan ( &quot;hooper swan&quot;; Cygnus cygnus), also known as the common swan, is a large northern hemisphere swan. It is the Eurasian counterpart of the North American trumpeter swan, and the type species for the genus &quot;Cygnus&quot;. 

==Taxonomy==
Francis Willughby and John Ray&#x27;s &quot;Ornithology&quot; of 1676 referred to this swan as &quot;the Elk, Hooper, or wild Swan&quot;. It was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where it was given the binomial name of &quot;Anas cygnus&quot;. The species name is from &quot;cygnus&quot;, the Latin for &quot;swan&quot;.

==Description==

The whooper swan is similar in appearance to Bewick&#x27;s swan. It is larger, however, at a length of and a wingspan of . The weight is typically in the range of , with an average of for males and for females. The verified record mass was for a wintering male from Denmark. It is considered to be amongst the heaviest flying birds. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tarsus is and the bill is . It has a more angular head shape and a more variable bill pattern that always shows more yellow than black (Bewick&#x27;s swans have more black than yellow). Like their close relatives, whooper swans are vocal birds with a call similar to the trumpeter swan.
==Distribution and habitat==

Whooper swans require large areas of water to live in, especially when they are still growing because their body weight cannot be supported by their legs for extended periods. The whooper swan spends much of its time swimming, straining the water for food, or eating plants that grow on the bottom.

Whooper swans have a deep honking call that resembles geese and, despite their size, are powerful fliers. Whooper swans can migrate hundreds or even thousands of miles to their wintering sites in southern Europe and eastern Asia. They breed in the subarctic Eurosiberia, further south than Bewicks in the taiga zone. They are rare breeders in northern Scotland, particularly in Orkney, and no more than five pairs have bred there in recent years; a handful of pairs have also bred in Ireland in recent years. This bird is an occasional vagrant to the Indian Subcontinent and western North America. Icelandic breeders overwinter in the United Kingdom and Ireland, especially in the wildfowl nature reserves of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust.

Whooper swans pair for life, and their cygnets stay with them all winter; they are sometimes joined by offspring from previous years. Their preferred breeding habitat is wetland, but semi-domesticated birds will build a nest anywhere close to water. Both the male and female help build the nest, and the male will stand guard over the nest while the female incubates. The female will usually lay 4–7 eggs (exceptionally 12). The cygnets hatch after about 36 days and have a grey or brown plumage. The cygnets can fly at an age of 120 to 150 days.

When whooper swans prepare to go on a flight as a flock, they use a variety of signaling movements to communicate with each other. These movements include head bobs, head shakes, and wing flaps and influence whether the flock will take flight and if so, which individual will take the lead. Whooper swans that signaled with these movements in large groups were found to be able to convince their flock to follow them 61% of the time. In comparison, swans that did not signal were only able to create a following 35% of the time. In most cases, the whooper swan in the flock that makes the most movements (head bobs) is also the swan that initiates the flight of the flock – this initiator swan can be either male or female, but is more likely to be a parent than a cygnet. Additionally, this signaling method may be a way for paired mates to stay together in flight. Observational evidence indicates that a swan whose mate is paying attention to and participates in its partner&#x27;s signals will be more likely to follow through with the flight. Thus, if a whooper swan begins initiating flight signals, it will be less likely to actually carry through with the flight if its mate is not paying attention and is therefore less likely to join it.

They are very noisy; the calls are strident, similar to those of Bewick&#x27;s swan but more resonant and lower-pitched on average: &quot;kloo-kloo-kloo&quot; in groups of three or four.

==Influence==
Whooper swans are much admired in Europe. The whooper swan has been the national bird of Finland since 1981 and is featured on the Finnish 1 euro coin. The whooper swan is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. Musical utterances by whooper swans at the moment of death have been suggested as the origin of the swan song legend. The global spread of H5N1 reached the UK in April 2006 in the form of a dead whooper swan found in Scotland.

<text>Plaza Las Américas is a shopping mall in Hato Rey, San Juan, Puerto Rico, located at the intersection of Routes 18 and 22. &quot;Plaza&quot;, as it is known to many Puerto Ricans, was the first indoor shopping mall built in Puerto Rico. It is the largest shopping mall in the Caribbean and the second largest in Latin America. Anchor stores are JCPenney, Macy&#x27;s, Sears, Forever 21, Old Navy, Caribbean Cinemas and Marshalls. Previously, there was a Kmart store near the mall and a Sears Brand Central at the mall. The mall is home to the world&#x27;s largest Romano&#x27;s Macaroni Grill restaurant.

==History==

=== Origins ===
In 1918, siblings Jerónimo, Rosa, Gerardo, and Jaime Fonalledas acquired of land previously known as &quot;Las Monjas&quot;. This land was property of Don Pablo Ubarri Capetillo, the Count of Santurce. By 1920, little by little cane harvesting was eliminated with the intention of using the land for the creation of a milk company, eventually known as &quot;Vaquería Tres Monjitas&quot;. 

=== Development and opening: 1950s-1960s ===
In 1950, the metropolitan area of San Juan was growing rapidly. The planning board began to build the project and ordered the development of the lands. It is then that the Fonalledas brothers came up with the idea of establishing a regional shopping center in the &quot;Las Monjas&quot; property. The planning board in cluded a space of 15 acres of land for a shopping center in its development plan. 

On March 8, 1963, site preparation was to begin soon for the first regional shopping center in Puerto Rico, it had been reported by J. I. Kislak Inc., of Newark, N. J., named by the Fonalledas brothers of San Juan, developers of the project, to direct the planning, leasing, promotion, and financing of the first stage of the center. To be known as Plaza Las Américas, the retail facility would have approximately 900 feet of frontage on Franklin D. Roosevelt Avenue, directly opposite the city&#x27;s new $5 million municipal stadium. Initial plans called for construction of an $8 million first section, which would contain approximately 550,000 square feet of retail store space. This section would cover about 50 acres in the development. Parking space would be provided for 4,200 cars. The center had been planned to give the largest possible number of local merchants an opportunity to solve their needs for expansion, as well as their parking and traffic problems. One of two major department stores, including a local one, would form the hub of a 55 store development. According to the Kislak realty firm, merchants at the Plaza Las Américas shopping center would provide the widest variety of products and services ever assembled in Puerto Rico at one location. The shopping center was being designed by Lathrop Douglass, New York architect, in cooperation with Sacmag of Puerto Rico Inc., a leading architectural and engineering firm in San Juan at the time. Douglass and his associates had designed more than 40 large shopping centers throughout the United States.

On January 26, 1964, Macy&#x27;s, New York department store, was reported seriously considering opening a store in the Plaza Las Américas, which would be the largest shopping center on the island when completed. Construction had just started and it would be an estimated two years before completion. Representatives from Macy&#x27;s arrived on the island that week to confer with officials of the shopping center. If satisfactory leasing terms could be arranged there was a strong possibility Macy&#x27;s would open up there. This would be its first store outside of the continental United States.

On January 18, 1965, it was reported that the J. C. Penney Company, second largest department store chain in the United States at the time, had signed a lease for a major retail unit in Plaza Las Américas shopping center, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Announcement was made by the J. I. Kislak Organization which was representing the owners of the planning, leasing, financing, and promotion of the center. Slated for construction to start October, 1965, Plaza Las Américas would occupy a 120-acre site fronting approximately 1,000 feet on Franklin D. Roosevelt Avenue, directly opposite the Municipal Stadium, in the geographic center of the city. The new store would comprise 170,000 square feet of floor space, and would be the largest department store ever built in Puerto Rico, as well as one of the largest in the Penney chain In its first stage, Plaza Las Américas would have 550,006 square feet of floor space, and would feature a completely enclosed, air-conditioned, all weather mall, for the comfort and convenience of shoppers. Investment for the entire project is expected to reach $3 million, which would also include an area devoted to high-rise apartments. Lathrop Douglas was the architect, in, cooperation with Sagmag, of Puerto Rico. The Kislak firm reported that approximately 70 stores will be located in the center, and that negotiations were currently underway with a retailing chain for another major department store, which would complement the Penney unit. In addition, Kislak said, firm commitments had already been obtained from representative local concerns for a substantial number of stores in the retail hub. Owners of the property were Jeronimo and Jaime Fonalledas, of San Juan. They were represented at the signing by their local counsel, Jaime Saldana, and by Arthur Levin, of New York. The J. C. Penney Company was represented by Everett Moore, then vice-president, and by Elting Smith, the chain&#x27;s counsel. Negotiations for Penney were conducted by Ralph P. Betts. The 1,700-store at the time Penney chain, founded in 1902, expected to reported sales in excess of $2 billion this year.
On March 18, 1966, it was reported that A Newark based firm had provided mortgage financing for the largest regional shopping center in Latin America. The J. I. Kislak Organization reported that its Mortgage Division has arranged an $11,000,000 mortgage for 25 years with The Equitable Life Assurance Society on Plaza Las Américas, a 596,000 square foot retailing complex being built in the Hato Rey section of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Scheduled for completion in the fall of 1967, Plaza Las Américas covered a 55nacre tract at Franklin D. Roosevelt Avenue and Las Americas Express, opposite the municipal stadium. The Kislak Organization was the development consultant and leasing broker for the owners, the Fonalledas family, of San Juan. Major tenant of the new shopping hub would be the J. C. Penney Co., with. a 277,000 square foot department store, one of the largest in its nationwide chain at the time. The F. W. Woolworth Co. would also have a 48,000 square foot variety store. More than 30 stores by this point were leased. Among them were units of the Pueblo Supermarkets chain, First Federal Savings and Loan Association, Commonwealth Theatres, Thom McAn Shops, Singer Sewing Machine Co., and many other large San Juan retailers.

On July 15, 1967, it was reported that Plaza Las Américas, Inc. held its first meeting of tenants and architects that day at the site of the shopping center that was being built in Hato Rey. All tenants were invited. It was the first time that Plaza Las Américas had invited to see the progress of the construction. The huge shopping center, which would have space for approximately 75 tenants. The site was 50 acres of land with parking facilities for approximately 4,000 cars. Plaza Las Americas would have 750,000 square feet of air-conditioned retail space including the 3 J.C. Penney floors. One of the main aspects of Plaza Las Américas was its air-conditioned gallery. Approximately 14 acres of land would be occupied with buildings that would house the stores. J. I. Kislak Organization were the exclusive leasing agents for Plaza Las Américas. Peter Jacobson, the center&#x27;s project manager, said tenants were invited along with their architects and decorators to see how construction was going. According to Jacobson, Plaza Las Américas would be finished by the fall of 1968. The purpose of this meeting, according to Jim Vickers, manager at the time of J. I. Kislak, was to show tenants and their architects the many advantages of an enclosed gallery. This was a new business concept that had never been used in Puerto Rico. All the stores would be open to the gallery, offering the buyer absolute comfort and protection from inclement weather and traffic, and at the same time a pleasant atmosphere that invited shopping. Vickers said that Plaza Las Américas would have a Spanish motif in its architecture. Sacmag of P. R. were the architects for the project. In addition to J.C. Penney, the Kislak Organization was negotiating with other major local department stores to occupy approximately 10% of all leasable space. Among the tenants and officers who attended the meeting were Don Jerónimo and Jaime Fonalledas, main owners of Plaza Las Américas: representatives of J.C. Penney; Joseph Aramanda, Senior Vice President of the J.I. Kislak Organization; John Kelly, Kislak VP and executives of the 75 tenants that would occupy the site. Jacobson explained that Plaza Las Américas was employing 400 men in the construction work, but he expected that in the following 60 days the number would rise to 700. He reported that the gallery would have a park with water fountains and notably an area where children can play. &quot;This will be one of the largest and most modern shopping malls. Plaza Las Américas will have a wide variety of stores, from large department stores to a movie theater. It will be a city within a city,&quot; Jacobson said. Among the many local firms that would occupy Plaza Las Américas were: Pueblo, Lema, Velasco, Clubman, Tartak, La Favorita, Bird&#x27;s, Naveira, and the First Federal Savings and Loan Association.
On October 28, 1967, The J. I. Kislak Organization of Newark, N. J., announced that González Padín, Puerto Rico&#x27;s oldest and best known department store chain at the time, had signed a multi-million dollar lease for a 2-story, 76,500 square foot building in Plaza Las Américas, the air conditioned regional shopping center being built. The $35 million shopping hub, to be the largest on the island, was scheduled to open in fall of 1968. This was the second major department store brought by the Kislak realty firm, the center&#x27;s exclusive leasing broker, to Plaza Las Americas. Kislak had previously announced that the J. C. Penny Company would have a 3-story, 277,000 square foot store there.

On November 30, 1967, it was reported that it was expected that by August 1968 the gigantic commercial project that would bear the name of Plaza Las Américas would be inaugurated, in Hato Rey. The mall was being built at a cost of $35 million. This would be the most modern and complete shopping center in Latin America, and only comparable with some in the big cities of the United States, revealed the general manager of the project, Mr. Peter Jacobson. Construction, which was on track and expected to be completed according to plan, began in April that year. Plaza Las Américas already had 90 percent of its space, said Mr. Jacobson, with 72 commercial companies that have separate premises. These included two theaters owned by Commonwealth Theaters, the largest of the 80 spaces J.C. Penney, a Pueblo grocery store, a Velasco branch, another González Padín, Tartak, Petrie, Woolworth, and two banks: a branch of First Federal and another of First National City. The project had 800,000 square feet of floor space, said Mr. Jacobson, and free parking space for 4,000 vehicles. A few of the mall&#x27;s outstanding facilities were, gardens, fountains, benches, terrazzo floor and other facilities, through which you would be able to reach all the shops and establishments in the shopping mall. The only one comparable at the time to this promenade is one that joined a commercial sector in the city of Montreal, said Mr. Jacobson. The architects who planned the plaza tried to preserve the traditional Spanish structure in the arcades, vaulted ceilings and wooden beams in the low ceilings. Plaza Las Américas was of the type known as a &quot;regional shopping center&quot;. The owners were Puerto Ricans, the Fonalledas family. For the construction, the initial loan was granted by the First National City Bank and the long-term loan by the Equitable Life Insurance Co. It was being built by the company Sacmag. It had three accesses: one by the Las Américas Expressway and another by Roosevelt Avenue and the third by the side street that was being built together with the project. The idea of this shopping center, said Mr. Jacobson, was that the person upon entering it was able to find where to carry out all their errands, from recreation, restaurants, shops, beauty salons, banks, laundries, etc. All day the doors would be kept open, closing only at night, said Mr Jacobson, as access to the shops was by through the walk. It was 1,500 feet long and by 40 feet wide and consisted of three sections, one long and two more cross sections. The highest and most spectacular points of the covered promenade would be in front of González Padín and J. C. Penney stores, according to Mr. Jacob. He added that the inauguration of Plaza Las Américas was to be held in August.
On September 12, 1968, the Plaza las Américas shopping mall would officially inaugurate. The large complex of buildings, comprising a fully air-conditioned commercial space, occupies an area of 54 acres, with free parking facilities for 4,000 cars. And it was, definitively, a contribution of the Puerto Rican initiative to the growing social and economic development of the country at the time. With 850,000 square feet of construction, Plaza Las Américas, in its first stage, housed in its then modern structure that followed the harsh lines of colonial architecture in its exterior design, 79 establishments, including a branch of González Padín, Mueblerías Tartak, First Federal Savings, Joyería Naveira, Farmacias González, Velasco, Pueblo Supermarkets, and other important local firms, eighty percent of which were Puerto Rican. Likewise, in the Plaza Las Américas Shopping Center, which opened that day, J. C. Penney&#x27;s opened in Puerto Rico, a store with a space of 278,000 square feet, considered the largest establishment built by the chain in any of the markets where it operated. With the name of Plaza Theaters 1 and 2, the cinema opened as a two twin movie theater, in fact, the second of its kind in Puerto Rico at the time, in which they would present weekly premieres to the delight of the public. In Plaza Las Américas, the concept of providing the public with extensive facilities had been developed, not only so that they could benefit from an extensive selection of products and services, which could be purchased from a single stop in the center, but also so that they could enjoy the same throughout the day. These facilities included the Center Gallery, fully air-conditioned, magnificently decorated with tiled ropes ornamented with a profuse variety of tropical plants, seating areas, and the pleasant atmosphere that reigned throughout the establishment; nine establishments where food and refreshments were sold; the twin theaters with a capacity for 1,600 people, banking and savings facilities, pharmacies, and all kinds of &#x27;boutiques&#x27; were also featured in this massive shopping destination. Plaza Las Américas was considered the most spectacular shopping center in Latin America and Puerto Rico, standing out, both for its design and its facilities, among the most modern and attractive in the United States at the time. The following year, the architectural design of Plaza Las Américas would win the URBE Award for Best Commercial Architecture
On September 13, 1968, it was reported that on Inauguration day around 35,000 people arrived at the newly opened Plaza las Américas at the time.
On July 17, 1969, it was reported that during the month of August of that year, Plaza Las Américas would have another service that would increase the benefits enjoyed by the many consistent customers of the largest shopping center in Latin America at the time. This would be the Shell service center, which would be located on the center grounds and would sell gasoline, oil and car accessories. Diagnostics of a mechanical nature would also be offered.

On September 10, 1969, with a cocktail party attended by prominent figures of Puerto Rican commerce and banking, the first anniversary of the commercial complex of Plaza las Américas was celebrated. The event was attended by a large number of representatives of the 79 commercial establishments located in Plaza las Américas the at the time largest shopping center in Latin America. Miss Rosita Fonalledas, one of the founders of Plaza Las Américas lit the symbolic candle and cut the cake on the first anniversary of the shopping complex. Miss Rosita Fonalledas was accompanied at the event by her other three siblings: Geronimo, Jaime, and Gerardo. Mr. José Antonio Gorbea, administrador of the commercial complex said that &quot;Plaza Las Americas has been more successful than expected.&quot; He pointed out that none of those originally established in the shopping complex had suspended their operations. He further stated that the two banks that reside there have also had a good year of operations. For his part, Mr. Manuel Fernández. President of the Plaza Merchants Association stated that &quot;the Puerto Rican community has supported us in this first year of operations.&quot; He indicated that &quot;all the merchants have informed us that they have had higher sales than they expected in their first year of being here.&quot; Another who expressed his opinion, Mr. Gordon Peterson, General Manager of the store J.C. Penney at the time noted that &quot;we are extremely pleased with the operation of our establishment in Plaza Las Americas.&quot;

=== Expanding: 1970s-1980s ===
In March 1970, Woolworth&#x27;s would open its first Harvest House Grill in Puerto Rico at the mall, accompanying the Woolworth&#x27;s Restaurant which had been a staple at the mall up to that point.

On June 10, 1975, it was reported that the management of the Sears store chain had set the goal of opening two new stores in Puerto Rico for the year 1978, as was announced during a telephone interview by Robert B. Gibson, then President of Sears Roebuck de Puerto Rico, Inc. According to Gibson, Sears management at the time was in negotiations with the management of Plaza Las Américas, Inc., owners of the Plaza las Américas shopping complex, for the construction of a new Sears store in the shopping center. The store would be similar in size to the ones Sears that operated at the time in Hato Rey and Bayamón, and would be located in an extension of Plaza las Américas, towards the north side of the mall. The new store would be approximately 300,000 square feet of retail, office and warehouse space, covering approximately 135,000 square feet of retail space.

On December 7, 1975, one of the main corridors of Plaza Las Américas anchored by González Padín was decorated with Christmas motifs and decorations, reflecting the joy of the season. To the left, in the background, you could see the tall and colorful Christmas tree that was placed in the aforementioned corridor.

On November 26, 1976, a new Baskin Robbins Ice Cream store would open next to the Plaza Theatres.

On September 3, 1978, on Plaza las Américas 10th anniversary new plans for expansion would be announced. Plaza la Américas, had proposed to enlarge its image and grow to become the largest commercial Regional Center in Latin America. To do this, the following would be done step by step. The center expansion project, which had begun recently, entailed the ambitious plan to provide the people of Puerto Rico with the largest and best number of conveniences within a single area. Hence its impressive growth rate: from 840,000 to 1,400,000 square feet. To offer the most varied selection of merchandise, the number of stores would increase from 76 to 185; and among others, it would have the largest Sears store in Puerto Rico, in a 280,000 square foot building. Regarding the parking area, there will be a total of more than 5,500 parking spaces, including a parking building with space for eight hundred mobile cars. Parking in this building would be free. The building would have a panoramic elevator, interior stairs and covered bridges for pedestrians, which would connect directly with the central galleries of the expansion, on each of its levels. Two independent ramps would facilitate the entry and exit of cars to the parking building, which would be partitioned off by the parking area. J.C. Penney&#x27;s. In addition to the additional parking areas, the concept of the access roads to the center had to be completely changed, as well as the parking areas themselves. At the same time, the lighting in the parking lot was being remodeled, for which the existing light poles would be replaced by ones that were one hundred feet high, similar to those used on highways. This represented a significant advance, since in addition to projecting more effective lighting, it constituted a more efficient measure for the conservation of electrical energy. There would be a third level of 44,000 square feet, which would be dedicated exclusively to the sale of all kinds of food and entertainment. This area would remain open at night, so that everyone who attends the two theaters that will open there, as well as its amusement rooms, could fully enjoy the international food restaurants that would remain open every night of the week. A gigantic skylight would illuminate this entire area, which would also have various fast food service stands. Once the expansion was complete, it would not be possible to distinguish between the original central gallery and the new ones, since all the architectural elements used in the expansion would also be used in the existing areas. The roofs would have skylights at intervals, allowing light from outside to come in nicely. The floors, made of ceramic tiles in natural colors, would have shades that would vary by section to avoid monotony. There would be countless seating areas, with comfortable benches and attractive ornamental plants. Two ornamental fountains would be located, one in front of González Padín and the other at an intermediate point between J. C. Penny&#x27;s and Sears. A modern gazebo specially designed to make them look more attractive would be provided. The gazebo would be located in front of J. C. Penney&#x27;s, and would be raised two or three feet above ground level, so that it would be more visible to all.
On December 28, 1978, the president of Sears Roebuck de Puerto Rico, Inc. at the time, R. B. Gibson, announced the final closing of the Sears store in Hato Rey had already begun. Gibson said that all the merchandise in the Hato Rey store would be sold &quot;because we don&#x27;t want to move any merchandise to our new store in Plaza las Américas.&quot; The liquidation would include not only the merchandise, but also the shelves, office equipment and articles shop decorations. &quot;The decision to close Hato Rey and move to Plaza was a very difficult one to make, as our Hato Rey store has always been one of the most successful stores in the entire organization; however, the continued increase in sales of said store required moving to Plaza Las Américas, where we will be able to serve our customers with approximately fifty percent more sales space,&quot; added Gibson. The Hato Rey Sears store was inaugurated on November 2, 1962.

On February 11, 1978, it was reported that the honorable Mayor of San Juan, Dr. Hernán Padilla would be cutting the ribbon for the opening of the new Sears store at Plaza Las Américas during the ceremony that would take place on Monday, February 12 at 9:30 am.

On September 23, 1979, on Plaza las Américas 11th anniversary. Plaza las Américas would have 183 stores in total and an office building, after the expansions which would be completed the following year. The first step of the expansions was already a reality in the new stores integrated in an extension of the first level and in a second level. The expansion meant a total investment of $22 million for the center, which was added to the $15 million original investment. Of that $22 million, $2 million went toward redecorating the interiors of the entire mall to integrate with the expansions to create an integrated center in terms of appearance and unify the architectural theme. This included installing new flooring, new roofs, painting the complex, paving and redistributing the parking lot, removing poles and replacing them with a new, more efficient lighting system. New fountains designed and manufactured by Crystal Fountains were also being installed. One of them was the tallest in proportion to the confined space built by that renowned firm. Doing a bit of history, Mr. Joseph H. Martin, general manager of Plaza Las Américas, commented that the shopping complex was inaugurated on September 12, 1968, with 76 stores in 747,000 square feet on a 55-acre property. The expansions, which had since been envisioned, now utilize a 75-acre site and 1,228,000 square feet of space. Precisely for having planned expansions for the Plaza, the original building was located on the corner of the land. Another department store was expected to be added to the set of stores. Of vital importance that an expansion had to include was the integration of specialty stores to complement the general merchandise stores, so that gaps could be filled. For this reason, when granting space in the Plaza, a very careful selection was made, with the idea that the public manages to get all those peculiarities that are difficult to find in general stores. Another need that was seen as part of the expansion plan, according to Mr. Martin, was the reorganization of the sites for meals and entertainment. There was not enough variety, apart from the fact that they had to be placed where there could be easy access to them at times when the stores were not open. That&#x27;s where the idea of the third level came from. A food and entertainment center called &quot;La Terraza&quot;. It would be an area with tables and chairs around which there will be several fast food outlets. You could choose between Italian, Chinese food, sandwiches and other varieties. People would buy and go to the tables to enjoy it. Two additional cinemas, a game room, a fishmonger, a butcher and two restaurants would be located on the same floor. At the other extreme, the facilities that belonged to the Cervantes Restaurant would soon be available to turn that corner into another food and entertainment center. In terms of parking, Plaza increased its capacity from 4,000 to 5,900 spaces. Its new parking building also provided 1,050 spaces. The culmination of the Plaza&#x27;s expansion program would be the 11-story tower whose plans were complete and construction was to begin early the following year. &quot;An office tower on this shopping center provides a work climate that is difficult to duplicate in a conventional commercial sector. It has the unbeatable advantages of Express, parking, shops, food, and we are convinced of its success,&quot; said the general manager of Plaza las Américas. Since services could not be missing in an expansion plan of this magnitude, Plaza would now have a Care Center Daytime for children by Mrs. Annabel Ubarri. Mothers and fathers would be able to buy in peace after leaving the children in those facilities that had access through the second level of the shopping center. Two additional services that Plaza would offer would be, in the first instance, a photocopying center; and a Center for Government Agencies where customers can carry out simple transactions for the Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, the Telephone Company and the Fluvial Sources Authority. Finally, in the long term, this super regional shopping center plans to use six acres to its west to develop a small shopping center where a series of services difficult to find in Puerto Rico, but very necessary, which would be established. It was expected that the primary tenant at that facility would be a home care facility. The interior design of Plaza Las Américas would be the work of the architects Orval Sifontes and Nikita Zukov, while the construction works were in charge of Bird Construction, Pavarini Construction, Desarrollos Metropolitanos and ORM Construction.
On August 19, 1981, on the first floor of the mall being located in front of Velasco, Command Performance would inaugurate a salon in Plaza las Américas.

On January 27, 1983, La Terraza would be the focus of the plans for Plaza Las Américas that year, according to the mall&#x27;s then Marketing Director, Miss April Hough. She made known the interest of the administration of Plaza Las Américas in promoting La Terraza for the conveniences that its food facilities represent for the public, which were open from 8 am some and from 10 am others, until 10 pm seven days a week. That is why a year earlier they had animated the place with live music and this year they were organizing a varied series of activities. For March, in terms of activities in the mall, they were already working in coordination with the Women&#x27;s Affairs Commission to organize activities aimed at celebrating Women&#x27;s Week, from March 6 to 12. As for stores, others would soon open their doors in addition to two that opened in December, T. Shirt Place and Euromodas. On the other hand, Empresas Fonalledas owners of Plaza las Américas, had long-term plans. One was to open another mall in Ponce, under the name of Plaza del Caribe and they had also recently acquired the Arecibo Mall in Arecibo. Another plan, for eventual development, was the construction of an 11-story office tower on top of Plaza las Américas (which would be considered as a 7-story structure). Around the surrounding grounds, Miss Hough replied that they were receiving proposals of what could be done there. In Plaza Las Américas they were optimistic about the sales of 1983, judging by the month of January that &quot;it&#x27;s been very good.&quot;
On March 11, 1984, Plaza las Américas would be called an &quot;all-consuming passion&quot;. The 15-year-old operation at the time had been a huge financial success. Its $240 million in annual sales had put it among the top 2% of the 35,000 shopping centers around the world. J.C. Penney&#x27;s plaza store was the chain&#x27;s nationwide sales leader. Elderly retired men sat on the mall&#x27;s benches, reading and animatedly discussing teenagers parading around a large fountain that spurted to the ceiling; and families with tots in strollers often occupy most of the 960 tables on the huge third floor &quot;food court&quot;, where Burger King, Orange Julius and 17 other eateries vie for the fast-food dollar.
On November 21, 1985, amid immense hullabaloo, illuminations, and Christmas decorations, the seasonal decoration of Plaza Las Américas was lavishly inaugurated. To artistically celebrate such a great event, the management of the shopping center designed a program spectacular in which the orchestra of the Escuela Libre de Música, directed by Randolfo Juarbe, took part, as well as student choirs and the little violinists who studied at the Julio Sellés Solá school directed by the Professor Mario Rosa. The contagious notes of the traditional Christmas carols and Puerto Rican Christmas bonuses were heard in the Immense area of the Plaza, at about 7 at night forming a great choral mass, which was joined by the voices of many of the excited parishioners who watched spellbound events. The Plaza&#x27;s beautiful Christmas decorations were coordinated by Timi&#x27;s, and spanned all three levels of the enormous building. In front of the J.C. Penney, on the permanent dais where usually assembly is carried out exhibitions, the decorators created a snowy forest, in which tiny beings were found. The decoration in the galleries and corners of the shopping center, however, followed a different trend. In several sections there were trees on high platforms, surrounded by wooden gates, decorated with countless objects and garlands of multicolored lights. Numerous gift boxes, splendidly decorated with ribbons and festive paper, decorated the foot of each tree, which could be white or green. Through corridors and stairs, luminous spikes, multicolored bombs brightened the passage of concurrent. Each store collaborated by decorating their front of the store according to the merchandise that was sold, be it toys, clothing, dolls, porcelain, jewelry, crystals. The public thoroughly enjoyed the show, demonstrating it with the incessant applause that forced the orchestra to continue playing. Since the week earlier, Plaza Las Américas, aware of the number of people who flocked to said center, had started a very special valet service (at a cost of $2.00) to park your car and avoid the huge traffic jams that formed there. When requesting the service, they would give you a coupon that would allow you to claim your car when you had finished shopping.

On September 10, 1986, on the occasion of the celebration of the Eighteenth anniversary of Plaza Las Américas, the idea of designing an emblem that would reflect the theme of the celebrations arose. The emblem would be used on the different banners, posters and advertisements that would decorate the majestic shopping center. Thus, Abner Gutiérrez, creative director of Image Developers Group, was in charge of bringing this idea of the emblem to life at the time. He designed a stylized woman&#x27;s face, which highlighted the feminine style required for the theme. To achieve this, he used the parameters established by Plaza&#x27;s management: celebration of the 18th anniversary, theme News of fashion, with an emphasis on the feminine. &quot;Taking the parameters into account, I decided to develop a female face, which would represent a universal woman. I designed a face because fashion includes clothing, shoes, makeup, etc., and I did not want to tie the design to a specific fashion.&quot; Gutierrez explained. He added that the design was so universal that it managed to place women as the centerpiece of fashion, not fashion as something that governs women. Regarding the design style, Gutiérrez indicated that it is of the art-deco type, because that period (art-deco) had a great impact on the development of fashion at a popular level. In detail, the design was a stylization of a woman&#x27;s profile with thick lines. The lines are thick, he clarified, because the type of use that will be given to the emblem is prevented, for example, reproduction on posters and press advertisements. In view of this possibility, Gutiérrez explained, it was necessary to develop a simple but visually strong design that, regardless of the type of reproduction to which it was subjected, would maintain and reflect the theme of women. The colors of the design are pink and gunmetal gray. &quot;Pink because it is definitely a color associated with women and gunmetal because it is a neutral color that is very popular among fashion designers and creates a very nice combination with pink,&quot; explained Gutiérrez. Along with the design of the emblem, Gutiérrez prepared in his studio the art that would be used in the different pennants and posters that would adorn Plaza Las Américas in its great celebration.

On June 27, 1987, Plaza Las Américas was considered the commercial emporium of Puerto Rico, and even of the Caribbean, the shopping center would be greatly strengthened with the prompt construction of a super modern eleven-story office tower according to Roberto Trápaga, from Plaza Leasing, Inc., the developer of the project, which would be known as One Plaza Tower. The realization of this project responded to the visionary plans of the originators of Plaza Las Américas, who anticipated the growth and success of Plaza as a shopping center, and estimated that in the near future it would be necessary to expand the structural services of the complex. That future had arrived, and the answer to those needs of the dynamic Puerto Rican society was One Plaza Tower. &quot;The world of shopping centers is something more than the unification of several stores. For this purpose, the concept that a center should be characterized by its mixed uses has been developed. This concept has been successful. And also, it has not been conflictive regarding the use of entertainment facilities. and services&quot;, explained Trápaga. With the construction of One Plaza Tower, Plaza Las Américas would become a faithful example of the concept of mixed uses, according to Trápaga, since apart from including the current facilities, it would add a building that would house all kinds of community service offices. &quot;When you have such a continuous transit of people, the integration of different commercial aspects is more than necessary.&quot; he said. One Plaza Tower further complemented the evolution of Plaza Las Américas. &quot;We knew that in the future we would have to build an office tower. In this sense, and with a very accurate vision of the future, what is currently the square was built and integrated into the complex, so that in the future it would serve as a structural base for an office tower (One Plaza Tower)&quot;, he emphasized. One Plaza Tower would be an integral part of the Plaza, with access to all its facilities: shops, restaurants, banking institutions, travel agencies, post offices, etc. According to Trápaga, the tower would be a first-class building with the most conveniences, advanced location, 6,000 parking spaces (free), complete fire protection (smoke detectors, alarms, sprinkler system, smoke extractors) and capacity for a helicopter to land. The project which was to be finished by the end of 1988, had a cost of approximately $18 million dollars. As for the building, the entrance will be through the parking lot or the third level (La Terraza); the floors would be numbered from 4 to 14, not including 13, from floors 5 to 14 there would be 16,200 square feet for rent. Floors 4 and 15 would have approximately 15,265 rentable square feet.

On November 11, 1989, it was reported that Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, the largest toy store in the world at the time, was building its largest physical plant in the world on the grounds of Plaza las Américas, reported Guillermo Alvarez, director of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us in Puerto Rico. The store, the largest of 541 in the world, would be located in a 67,000 square foot building that was currently in the completion phase of its construction. &quot;Right now we are working on the finishes, as well as paving the parking lot that covers a space of 31 square meters,&quot; said engineer Edris Méndez, project manager for F &amp; R Construction, the general contractor firm that was in charge of the project. The area designated for the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us store would be shared in the future with a Pueblo Xtra supermarket. &quot;The format of this new store, which we will open on December 1, will be the same as 95% of the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores in the world,&quot; Alvarez said. What made it the biggest is that there would be a huge warehouse area with a total of 37,000 square feet. The remaining area would be conditioned for sales.

=== Expanding: 1990s-2000s ===
On July 22, 1990, it would be reported that a Maternity Exclusive store inaugurated its new facilities on the first level of Plaza Las Américas. Nereida and Gerardo Márquez, owners of Maternity Exclusive, gave the guests a rich reception, where prominent personalities from the Plaza Las Américas business, and from the artistic environment such as Charityn and her then husband Elín Ortiz were present.

On August 16, 1990, it was reported that Plaza las Américas would be expanded to accommodate new stores, exhibition areas, and five new cinemas, according to documents submitted to the Planning Board. This expansion was in addition to the proposed construction of an 11-story office tower on the third floor of Plaza las Américas, which was long planned by this point. The proposed project consisted of the construction of two additional floors above the Velasco store with an area of approximately 72,000 square feet. The second of the new levels would be used to house new shops and display areas. The new cinemas would be located on the third level, which would have a total capacity of 2,039 seats. The expansion of the Velasco building and the remodeling of the third level of the shopping center was being designed by the designers Méndez, Brunner &amp; Asociados. Despite several calls to the offices of the owners of Plaza las Américas, Las Empresas Fonalledas, it was not possible to know the total cost of this project or additional details of it. A source alleged to the project explained that the three cinemas that were currently located on the third level of the Plaza at the time would be eliminated and the space would be used to add fast food establishments in the La Terraza area. Likewise, in the space occupied by the Plaza III, Plaza IV and Plaza V cinemas, a community hall would be built for business meetings and public service. &quot;The Community Room will be used for public services such as blood donations, taxpayer orientation, etc,&quot; indicated the memorandum on the project submitted to the Planning Board. The project would also require an increase of 366 parking spaces. The project was in the permitting stage and precisely on the 7th of that month, the Planning Board held public hearings on the petition that was presented by representatives of Méndez, Brunner Asociados.

In 1992 to 1994, an expansion to Plaza las Américas would be done which included an extension of the food court La Terraza, of which the number of restaurants was increased from 19 to 24. The movie theater which was expanded from 5 to 10 screens, and the construction of La Torre de Plaza finally being completed at a cost of $15 million which added 146,000 square feet of rentable space to the retail complex.
On March 21, 1994, Burdines with undergoing negotiations at the time expected to start construction on its first Puerto Rico store, at Plaza Las Américas, in the following year. It would be the department store chain&#x27;s first foray outside of Florida and an initial step into Latin America, said Carey Watson, company spokesman for Burdines.

On October 25, 1995, Pier 1 Imports announced an agreement with Sears Roebuck de Puerto Rico to open six Pier 1 stores inside Sears department stores on the island. The new Pier 1 stores would have 2,000-3.000 square feet of sales space. The first two were scheduled to open in November of that year in the Sears store at Plaza las Américas, and in the Sears Homelife store at the Galerías Paseos shopping mall in San Juan.

On October 31, 1995, González Padín would announce the closure and liquidation of all its stores due to economic issues. The closure began on the 30th, with the closure of its main store, the one in Plaza las Américas, and the dismissal of the many employees who worked there. This would also include Velasco, which was owned by González Padín. The chain would completely close by December of that year.

In 1996, a 246 million dollar renovation was announced. Which consisted of the construction of a new 4-level (300,700 square foot) J. C. Penney. Which was being built on the west side of the existing store. And the repurposing the old Penney&#x27;s building once moved out as 3 levels of inline store and restaurant space.

In 1998, the J. C. Penney store at Plaza las Américas would re-inaugurate in a new building at the mall replacing the original at the time 30-year-old store, then becoming the largest store in the chain and being No. 1 in sales and profit that year.
On April 8, 1998, it was announced by company officials of the J. C. Penney store at Plaza las Américas, that a 70,000 square foot expansion would be opening, bringing the size of the store to 350,000 square feet. The four story expansion would be accessible by a tunnel from the existing store. J. C. Penney&#x27;s had higher average sales in Puerto Rico than in its stores in the United States that year. It had five stores in Puerto Rico and planned to open two more in 1999 in the towns of Caguas and Humacao.

On April 23, 1998, it would be reported that Kmart in November of that year would be inaugurating a store in Plaza Las Américas, which would be the largest store of the chain on the Island with 144,000 square feet.

On July 30, 1998, it was reported that Plaza las Américas, was about to grow even more. Over the next two years, the mall would add about 600,000 square feet to its current size at the time and about 100 new stores, including the first two-story Big Kmart in the United States and its territories, as well as the first Macy&#x27;s store to be established in the island. All this for nothing more than about $239 million. Upon completion it was estimated Plaza las Américas would have a total of 1.9 million square feet of retail space. The new establishments, according to the management of the center, would create at least 3,000 new jobs.

On August 18, 1998, it was reported that Federated Department Stores, Inc., said it had reached an agreement to build a Macy&#x27;s store in San Juan, Puerto Rico, making for the retailer&#x27;s first international store. The store, was to begin construction at Plaza Las Américas, later that year, would open in the early fall of 2000. It would occupy three stories and 260,000 square feet. The store would be part of Cincinnati based Federated&#x27;s Macy&#x27;s East division. The division operated 87 stores in 15 states in the eastern United States.

===2000s ===

On February 17, 2000, it was reported that Borders, the at the time $2.6 billion American bookstore chain, had chosen the Spanish-speaking U.S. Caribbean island of Puerto Rico for its first &quot;bilingual&quot; superstore. In its cavernous two-story 28,750 square foot space in San Juan&#x27;s Plaza Las Americas, Borders was building the prototype for a planned push into Latin America. It was a breath of fresh air for Puerto Rico&#x27;s readers of English, who in the absence of chain bookstores had made do with woefully inferior selections. An opening date was scheduled for February 19th.

On June 8, 2000, it was reported that on the south mall area of Plaza las Américas, where Borders was located, would also feature a two-level, 31,000 square foot Old Navy that summer, replacing part of the former space left by González Padín in 1995. Also opening in that summer would be a 13-screen multiplex. Plaza las Américas would also be adding a variety of restaurants on its first floor. Before the year&#x27;s end, the mall would feature about 10 restaurants on the south side of the mall, which would be a combination of popular priced local and stateside concepts. In that following year, the third floor of J. C. Penney&#x27;s previous site would be connected through a covered canopy to La Terraza. J. C. Penney&#x27;s third floor would also feature a 55,000 square foot entertainment and restaurant area.

On June 9, 2000, it was reported that Furniture and home accessories retailer The Bombay Co. would open its doors in Plaza Las Americas in November of that year, said Rodolfo Criscuolo, the company&#x27;s local licensee. The 2,750 square foot store was to be opened as part of the company&#x27;s first expansion outside the mainland U.S. it was expected to be among the chain&#x27;s five best-selling stores, according to a company spokesman.

On October 25, 2000, the first day of business at the first Macy&#x27;s department store outside the mainland United States had management beaming. Added Thousands of people strolled through the store on its opening day in San Juan&#x27;s premier mall, Plaza Las Americas. The party atmosphere at what was already a household name to many Puerto Ricans marked a milestone in the island&#x27;s highly desirable and fiercely competitive retail market. It was the newest of Macy&#x27;s 186 U.S. stores at the time and was molded to fit the tastes, weather and culture of the Caribbean. Macy&#x27;s chose Puerto Rico as the place for its overseas debut because so many of the residents were familiar with the chain, particularly its New York and South Florida stores, and because Plaza Las Américas had a reputation as one of the best retail malls in the northern hemisphere. The new Macy&#x27;s in San Juan had less to do with tourists and more to do with locals. The customers milling about the three-story, 260,000 square foot store found the designer labels and kitchen department they were accustomed to on the mainland, but also a mix of colors and fabrics they wouldn&#x27;t find in other Macy&#x27;s stores. Louder, vibrant colors displaced some of the grayer tones in women&#x27;s clothing, while the winter colors in men&#x27;s clothes came in short sleeves. Two local high-end department stores, Velasco and González Padín, had closed down some years ago by this point. J.C. Penney and Sears, long focused on fashion in Puerto Rico. Now Macy&#x27;s had joined them, filling in a void in the market.

On October 4, 2001, it was reported that in those next two months, Plaza las Américas would be adding seven new establishments to its roster. These were Zara, Margarita&#x27;s, Oriental Palace, The Sony Store, The Bombay Co., Ciao Mediterranean, and Constellations. According to Plaza las Américas parent Empresas Fonalledas Communications &amp; Public Relations director Lorraine Vissepo, Spain-based fashion store Zara would be the largest store of the seven new establishments at 16,000 square feet. It was expected to open in November. The Sony Store, would feature technological innovations unavailable elsewhere,&quot; Vissepo said, adding that it would occupy 2,369 square feet of the second floor and would open that month. The Bombay Co., a furniture &amp; home decoration store was slated to open in November and would occupy 2,792 square feet. Margarita&#x27;s, Oriental Palace, and Ciao Mediterranean were restaurants.

On December 6, 2001, Plaza Las Américas had recently inaugurated a new commercial hallway where the original J. C. Penney used to be. This hallway already featured at the time Margarita&#x27;s Restaurant, an art exhibit by local artists, and various temporary tenants. Among them were Supershine, Collector&#x27;s World, Kiosko SALO, Gone Fishing, Chateau Rouge, Mr. Pretzel&#x27;s, Candy World and Abracadabra.

On September 25, 2003, Lorraine Vissepo, communications director at Empress Fonalledas, the parent company of Plaza Las Américas, announced that new stores would be opening for business at the mall, with another under construction. She added that the shopping center&#x27;s performance in terms of sales and traffic remained positive. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of movement in the mall; sales have continued to be satisfactory,&quot; she said. The stores opening or expanding were Reinhold Jewelry, McDonald&#x27;s, Adolfo Dominguez, and Cohen&#x27;s Fashion Optical. Church&#x27;s Fried Chicken was under renovation, according to Vissepo.

On October 1, 2005, CV Entertainment Group, the owner company of CineVista Theatres, announced an investment of US$6 million to transform the closed movie theater at the food court of Plaza Las Américas into a multimedia entertainment center that as of April 2006, would be known as Galaxy Lanes. It would include a mega bowling alley with 32 lanes, two restaurant areas, two bars (seating 500 people), 16 giant projection screens in the bowling area, a 20&#x27;x20&#x27; mega screen in the mezzanine area, multiple plasma monitors, wireless Internet connection, a dance floor and a DJ; a stage for live performances, pool tables, VIP rooms for parties, and a cabin for live radio and TV broadcasts. &quot;We are talking about a 40,000 square-feet multimedia entertainment center,&quot; said CV Entertainment Group Marketing &amp; Operations VP Osvaldo Gonzalez.

On May 10, 2007, it was reported that Plaza las Américas, was in the midst of finalizing negotiations with New York based retailer Pottery Barn to open its first store on the island sometime in 2008.

On May 31, 2007, Maxine Clark, founder and chief executive bear of Build-a-Bear, announced the popular stuffed-animal chain had landed a coveted spot at Puerto Rico&#x27;s premier shopping center, Plaza Las Américas. The Build-a-Bear store, which was under construction, was expected to open sometime late June to early July of that year featuring its collection of Build-a-Bear customized stuffed animals plus some customized items for the local market for a local flair. The store would be located on the mall&#x27;s first floor, a couple of doors away from The Gap. In a market where there was practically no entertainment or educational activities for children, &#x27;tweens&#x27; (ages 12-16) and for parents and children, Build-a-Bear was poised to become a bare necessity. The Plaza store was the first one of three to four locations expected to open on the island, each with a minimum investment of nearly $1 million and 35-40 full-time and part-time employees. &quot;It was well worth the wait,&quot; said Clark during an exclusive interview, referring to the six-year wait to find the ideal location at Plaza Las Américas. &quot;I knew we wanted to be in the Puerto Rico market, but you have to start with the best location. Plaza Las Américas affords us the opportunity to truly showcase our concept and I&#x27;m confident our family-oriented concept will win over the people of Puerto Rico. Island customers are warm and friendly people, very congruent with the in-store experience at Build-a-Bear.&quot;

On April 10, 2008, it was reported that New York based West Elm was set to begin operations at its first Puerto Rico store in Plaza Las Américas. During an exclusive interview, Dave DeMattei, president of west elm, confirmed, if successful, the Plaza store could be the first of several to open around the island. The store would have 20,000 square feet with 10,000 of those for selling space.

On March 5, 2009, it was reported that European giant retail beauty chain Sephora, which had revolutionized the U.S. cosmetic market since 1998, was finally coming to Puerto Rico. Sephora representatives, who in the past had shown no interest in the local market, had been in conversations with Plaza Las Américas leasing management for awhile. The Puerto Rico store was part of the chain&#x27;s multimillion dollar 2009 expansion plan. In 2001, there was an initial approach from the Plaza Las Américas team to Sephora, but to no avail; it was still too early in Sephora&#x27;s mainland expansion plan. In 2008, during the annual ICSC (International Council of Shopping Centers) convention, it was confirmed Sephora had in fact accepted an invitation from Plaza Las Américas to explore a scenario whereby the company would come to Puerto Rico. Still, Plaza officials kept a tight lid on the matter. But the wait was over. Construction of the first Sephora store was underway in the lower level at Plaza Las Américas, near Radio Shack and West Elm. To accommodate the beauty retailer, Plaza Las Américas had to relocate the former fast food corridor in that area to make room for the new store. The arrival of Sephora on the island, a brand that was already known by many Puerto Rican customers who frequently traveled to the U.S. mainland, would certainly shake up the cosmetic and fragrance business category on the island, which was estimated to generate $100 million in annual sales.

On April 23, 2009, it was reported that Plaza Las Américas was preparing for the arrival of Los Angeles based Forever 21, which would occupy the former Galaxy Lanes space in the mall&#x27;s third level which had closed in 2008. The Puerto Rico store would be the chain&#x27;s first in Latin America. Slated to open that summer. The multi-level 40,000 square foot Forever 21 location at Plaza Las Américas, adjacent to Plaza&#x27;s La Terraza food court, was the latest flagship addition to the fashion chain with other international flagship operations in Canada, Korea, China and Singapore. It would generate 100 new jobs.

=== 2010s ===
On June 9, 2011, it was reported that San Francisco based furniture and home retailer Pottery Barn (PB) likely would be closing its Plaza Las Américas store before that year&#x27;s end. Pottery Barn&#x27;s exit, however, left space for the mall to relocate Foot Locker to PB&#x27;s 21,000 square foot location on the main level. Meanwhile, Foot Locker&#x27;s space would be transformed into a much sexier store to be occupied by Victoria&#x27;s Secret, according to Plaza Las Américas sources.

In addition, between July–August 2012, expansion began on the multistory parking, located in the southern area of the mall. The expansion extended the five floors of multistory to add over 300 parking spaces. All parking areas of the mall were also repaved while new landscape gardens designs where developed in front of the main entrance. 

On December 18, 2012, Plaza Las Américas confirmed that it signed an agreement for the establishment of The Cheesecake Factory in the shopping center.

Franklin Domenech, General Manager at the time of Plaza Las Américas, pointed out that &quot;the most visible remodeling works of Plaza las Américas concluded last year with the restoration of the skylight of the north fountain and the north panoramic elevator, the facade of La Terraza and the connecting corridor between The Terrace and the third level of the Central Atrium, where Walgreens is. Now we are remodeling the elevators of La Torre de PLAZA and soon the remodeling of the area in front of Banco Santander and Red Lobster will begin,&quot; he concluded. Rafael Ruiz-Comas, Director of Corporate Leasing added that &quot;this year the Tiffany and A&#x27;gaci stores have already opened and we expect more activity in new stores during the second half of 2016 to continue strengthening our commercial offer, starting with these four new stores that we are announcing today and that are owned by Puerto Rican businessmen and investors&quot;.

<doc id="307025" wikidata="Q2421465" url="?curid=307025" title="This American Life">
<text>This American Life (TAL) is a weekly hour-long American radio program produced in collaboration with Chicago Public Media and hosted by Ira Glass. It is broadcast on numerous public radio stations in the United States and internationally, and is also available as a free weekly podcast. Primarily a journalistic non-fiction program, it has also featured essays, memoirs, field recordings, short fiction, and found footage. The first episode aired on November 17, 1995, under the show&#x27;s original title, Your Radio Playhouse. The series was distributed by Public Radio International until June 2014, when the program became self-distributed with Public Radio Exchange delivering new episodes to public radio stations.

A television adaptation of the show ran for two seasons on the Showtime cable network between June 2007 and May 2008.

==Format==

Each week&#x27;s show has a theme, explored in several &quot;acts&quot;. On occasion, an entire program will consist of a single act. Each act is produced by a combination of staff and freelance contributors. Programs usually begin with a short program identification by host Ira Glass who then introduces a prologue related to the theme which precedes act one. This prologue will then lead into the presentation of the theme for that week&#x27;s show. After the introduction of the theme, Glass then introduces the first act of the program.

Content varies widely by episode. Stories are often told as first-person narratives. The mood of the show ranges from gloomy to ironic, from thought-provoking to humorous. The show often addresses current events, such as Hurricane Katrina in &quot;After the Flood&quot;. Often &quot;This American Life&quot; features stories which explore aspects of human nature, such as &quot;Kid Logic&quot;, which presented pieces on the reasoning of children. The majority of interviews with subjects never make it to the air, as many as 80 percent, because the team looks for interviewees who recount stories in a &quot;particular way&quot;.

The end credits of each show are read by Glass, and include a sound clip extracted out of context from some portion of that show, which Glass humorously attributes to previous WBEZ general manager Torey Malatia, who co-founded the show with Glass in 1995.

Glass has stated he is contractually obligated to mention station WBEZ (and previously, also former distributor PRI) three times in the course of the show.

==History==
In the early 1990s, Glass co-hosted, with Gary Covino, a Friday-night show in Chicago called &quot;The Wild Room.&quot; However, he was looking for new opportunities in radio, and had been sending grant proposals to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for two years when, in 1995, the MacArthur Foundation approached Torey Malatia, general manager of Chicago Public Radio. They offered him to make a show featuring local Chicago writers and performance artists. Malatia approached Glass with the idea, who countered that he wanted to do a weekly program, but with a different premise, a budget of , and sights on taking it national. In a 1998 article in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, Michael Miner quoted Covino as saying, &quot;The show [Glass] proposed was &quot;The Wild Room&quot;. He just didn&#x27;t call it &quot;The Wild Room&quot;.&quot; Glass, however, did not include his co-host in his plans and assured him that the deal was unlikely to happen. When the show went on without him, Covino says he felt &quot;betrayed&quot;. While Glass admits he wasn&#x27;t transparent about his plans, in that same article, he explained, &quot;Every week on &quot;The Wild Room&quot; we came to the show with two independent sensibilities. I love Gary. I loved Gary. But I didn&#x27;t want to keep doing that show...and the notion that everything I brought to &quot;The Wild Room&quot; I got from him I find completely infuriating...I didn&#x27;t want to do free-form radio anymore. I have no interest in improvisation. It might have been possible to design a show with him that he would have felt comfortable with and I would have felt comfortable with. But at that point—I was in my late 30s—I just wanted to do the thing I wanted to do.&quot;

The show debuted on WBEZ in Chicago as &quot;Your Radio Playhouse&quot; on November 17, 1995. Glass conceived a format where each segment of the show would be an &quot;act,&quot; and at the beginning of each episode, would explain that show consisted of &quot;documentaries, monologues, overheard conversations, found tapes, [and] anything we can think of.&quot; Glass also served as executive producer. The program&#x27;s name was changed beginning with the March 21, 1996, episode, and was picked up nationally by PRI the following June. Chicago Public Media (then called the WBEZ Alliance) produced. The program&#x27;s first year was produced on a budget that was tight even by US public-radio standards. A budget of $243,000 covered an outfitted studio, marketing costs, satellite time, four full-time staffers, and various freelance writers and reporters. The station was located at Chicago&#x27;s Navy Pier. Early on, Glass commissioned stories from artists, writers, theater people, and journalists. National syndication began in June 1996 when Public Radio International formed a distribution partnership with the program, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting awarded the show a three-year grant for $350,000, double what Glass applied for. As time went on, the staff was drawn more to journalistic stories that were, as Glass puts it, &quot;in a style where there were characters and scenes and plot and funny moments.&quot; The show is also carried on Sirius XM Satellite Radio over the Public Radio International block on the XM Public Radio channel. In the early 2010&#x27;s, the program consistently rated as the first- or second-most downloaded podcast on iTunes for each week.

Early response to the program was largely positive. In 1998, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine called it &quot;hip as well as intensely literary and surprisingly irreverent.&quot; Glass used a unique strategy to promote the show to stations by giving away pledge drive ads he developed himself. By the end of 1999, TAL aired on 325 public radio stations, and, around that time, Rhino Records released a &quot;greatest hits&quot; CD of &quot;TAL&quot; episodes.

In January 2011, the series was picked up by CBC Radio One in Canada. The program is shortened slightly for the Canadian broadcast to allow for a five-minute newscast at the top of the hour, although this is partly made up for by the removal of mid-program breaks, most of the production credits (apart from that of Malatia), and underwriting announcements (CBC&#x27;s radio services being fully commercial-free, except when contractually or legally required).

In January 2012, &quot;This American Life&quot; presented excerpts from a one-man theater show &quot;The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs&quot; by Mike Daisey as an exposé of conditions at a Foxconn factory in China. The episode was entitled &quot;Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory&quot; and became one of the show&#x27;s most popular episodes at that time, with 888,000 downloads and 206,000 streams. WBEZ planned to host a live showing and a Q+A of &quot;The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs&quot; in Chicago on April 7, 2012. On March 16, 2012, &quot;This American Life&quot; officially retracted the episode after learning that several events recounted both in the radio story and the monologue were fabrications. WBEZ canceled the planned live performance and refunded all ticket purchases. Airing that day, &quot;This American Life&quot; devoted the week&#x27;s show (titled &quot;Retraction&quot;) to detailing the inconsistencies in &quot;The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs&quot;. The show includes interviews between Rob Schmitz, the reporter who discovered the discrepancies, and Daisey&#x27;s translator in China, Cathy Lee, as well as an interview between host Glass and Daisey. Daisey apologized for presenting his work as journalism, saying &quot;It&#x27;s not journalism. It&#x27;s theater,&quot; but refused to acknowledge that he had lied—even in the face of obvious discrepancies. The podcast of this episode became the most downloaded until February 2013.

Two weeks later, the show also reiterated that they had previously removed three stories by Stephen Glass due to dubious content, namely episode 57, &quot;Delivery&quot;, episode 79, &quot; Stuck in the Wrong Decade&quot;, and episode 86, &quot;How to Take Money from Strangers.&quot; The episodes including the segments had inadvertently resurfaced in episode streams due to a website redesign. Though the segments were cut from podcast streams, the transcript of the contents have been kept accessible on the show&#x27;s official website.

In 2015, the show retracted a story about canvassers who tried to change people&#x27;s political opinions. The story was based on an article in &quot;Science&quot; that was also retracted.

In March 2014, the program announced that PRI would stop distributing the show in July, and that May, Glass announced that the staff would be distributing the show themselves, with Public Radio Exchange doing the technical legwork to deliver the audio to the radio stations.

On October 1, 2014, the show produced a spinoff, &quot;Serial&quot;, a season-long exploration delivered as a podcast series. In 2015, Glass became the sole owner of &quot;This American Life&quot;; WBEZ continued as a production partner on the show and on &quot;Serial&quot; with future shows to be independent. In 2017, &quot;This American Life&quot; launched the podcast &quot;S-Town&quot; through the spinoff company Serial Productions. Serial Productions was bought by The New York Times Company in 2020. The &quot;Times&quot; and Serial jointly produced the podcasts &quot;Nice White Parents&quot;, hosted by Chana Joffe-Walt, which debuted in July 2020; and &quot;The Improvement Association&quot;, hosted by Zoe Chace, which debuted in April 2021.

==Production==
In a 2014 interview, Glass revealed the software and equipment used to make the show. The staff records interviews using Marantz PMD661 digital recorders and Audio Technica AT835b shotgun microphones. After each recording session (whether a single interview or day of recording) he uses a story structuring technique he learned from print journalist Paul Tough. He jots or types all the most memorable moments from the tape, then has the recording transcribed and makes note of any quotes of potential value in the story. He then arranges those quotes into a structured narrative.

To edit each story, the reporter presents the show to other producers.

Guests on the show have included Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Paterniti, who would normally command tens of thousands of dollars for an article but have settled for as little as 200 per day to have a piece included on the show. The program helped launch the literary careers of many, including contributing editor Sarah Vowell and essayists David Rakoff and David Sedaris.

For live shows, which combine live and pre-recorded elements, Glass previously used a mixing console and CD players. With time, he switched to using an iPad Mini running TouchAble software, which in turn controls the Ableton Live software on his MacBook Air. He can plug the MacBook into the house sound system using the device&#x27;s headphone jack.

The show offers two, six-month fellowship positions annually for persons who have worked in the field of journalism, but who would like training in how to tell stories in the style of &quot;This American Life&quot;. Former fellows include: Emmanuel Dzotsi, co-host of &quot;Serial&quot; season 3; BA Parker, host of NPR’s Code Switch; Brian Reed, host of S-Town; Ari Saperstein, host of Blind Landing; Jessica Lussenhop, investigative reporter at ProPublica; and current staff members Dana Chivvis, Phia Bennin, Aviva DeKornfeld and Safiyah Riddle.

==Music==
Episodes of &quot;TAL&quot; are accompanied by music. Some songs are used between acts and are credited in the episode guide for the show. Other songs are used as thematic background music for stories and are not credited. Jonathan Menjivar is a producer and music supervisor at the show.

&quot;Over the years, we&#x27;ve used hundreds of songs under our stories—and in some stories, we use a number of different songs in different sections. We tried to answer these emails , but often it was impossible sometimes to pinpoint which song people were asking about...&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The show received positive reviews from the beginning. Marc Fisher with &quot;American Journalism Review&quot; drew attention to how the program&#x27;s production style elicits &quot;a sense of ease, informality and direct, unfiltered access&quot;, and &quot;the effect is liberating&quot;. After remarking that producing so many stories each episode is &quot;labor intensive,&quot; David Stewart with &quot;Current&quot; said it is &quot;remarkable that while a few stories were fatuous or trite, most were successful and some really memorable.&quot; He added, &quot;Whose American life is this? Clearly Ira&#x27;s: it is kinky, clever, at once disingenuous and innocent, fanciful, rarely too serious...Above all, it is compelling.&quot;

The program has received criticism as well. In 2020, author Andrew J Bottomley wrote that the show primarily represents the perspective of its &quot;predominantly white, upper-middle-class, educated audience.&quot; He also said the show is &quot;didactic ... extracting from the stories of others a lesson that is then instilled on the audience.&quot;

===Listenership===
In 1999, more than 800,000 people listened to &quot;This American Life&quot; each weekend on 332 public radio stations. By 2019, the show broadcast to 2.2 million listeners each week, with an additional podcast audience of 3.6 million.

===Awards===
WBEZ-FM received a Peabody Award in 1996 and again in 2006 for &quot;TAL&quot;, for a show which &quot;captures contemporary culture in fresh and inventive ways that mirror the diversity and eccentricities of its subjects&quot; and &quot;weav[es] original monologues, mini-dramas, original fiction, traditional radio documentaries and original radio dramas into an instructional and entertaining tapestry&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;This American Life&quot; became the first news program to win the Pulitzer Prize for Audio Reporting. The winning work was &quot;The Out Crowd&quot;, the 688th episode with &quot;revelatory, intimate journalism that illuminates the personal impact of the Trump Administration&#x27;s &#x27;Remain in Mexico&#x27; policy&quot;.

In March 2021, the May 9, 2008, episode, &quot;The Giant Pool of Money&quot;, was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry as one of 25 works added to the registry for 2020. It was the first podcast episode ever chosen for inclusion in the registry.


== Adaptations ==

===Television===

Discussions of a television adaptation of &quot;TAL&quot; date back to at least 1999. However, the show&#x27;s creative team was unsure of what the show would &quot;look like&quot; and, with so much money on the line, turned down offers. In January 2006, Showtime announced it had greenlit six episodes of a new series based on &quot;TAL&quot;. The announcement noted that each half-hour episode would &quot;be hosted by Ira Glass and [...] explore a single theme or topic through the unique juxtaposition of first-person storytelling and whimsical narrative.&quot;

For budgetary reasons, Glass and four of the radio show&#x27;s producers left Chicago for New York City, where Showtime is headquartered. In January 2007, it was announced that Glass had completed production on the show&#x27;s first season, with the first episode set to premiere on March 22. Originally the series had a contract for a total of 30 shows over the four years, but after two seasons Glass announced that he and the other creators of the show had &quot;asked to be taken off TV&quot;, largely in part to the difficult schedule required to produce a television program. He went on to state that the show is officially &quot;on hiatus&quot;, but would like to do a television special at some point in the future.

The episode &quot;The Anatomy of Doubt&quot; based on reporting by ProPublica and The Marshall Project was adapted into the Netflix series &quot;Unbelievable&quot;.

===Film===
Stories from &quot;TAL&quot; have been used as the basis of movie scripts. In 2002 the show signed a six-figure deal with Warner Bros. giving the studio two years of &quot;first-look&quot; rights to its hundreds of past and future stories. One film to have emerged from the deal is &quot;Unaccompanied Minors&quot;, a 2006 film directed by Paul Feig and based on &quot;In The Event of An Emergency, Put Your Sister in an Upright Position&quot; from &quot;Babysitting&quot;. Ira Glass and longtime &quot;TAL&quot; producer Julie Snyder were both executive producers on the film. In June 2008, Spike Lee bought the movie rights to Ronald Mallett&#x27;s memoir, whose story was featured in the episode &quot;My Brilliant Plan&quot;. Potential Warner Bros films from &quot;TAL&quot; episodes include &quot;Niagara&quot;, which explored the town of Niagara Falls, New York, after those who sought to exploit the tourism and hydroelectrical opportunities of the area left; &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (from the episode &quot;Superpowers&quot;), the story of an adolescent who took steps to become the superhero she dreamed of being, well into adulthood; and &quot;Act V&quot;, about the last act of &quot;Hamlet&quot; as staged by inmates from a maximum security prison as part of Prison Performing Arts Adult Theatre Projects. Paramount Pictures and Broadway Video are in production on &quot;Curly Oxide and Vic Thrill&quot;, a film based on the &quot;TAL&quot; story in the episode &quot;My Experimental Phase&quot;.

&quot;This American Life&quot;″s 168th episode, &quot;The Fix Is In&quot;, inspired screenwriter Scott Burns to adapt Kurt Eichenwald&#x27;s book about business executive and FBI informant Mark Whitacre, titled &quot;The Informant&quot;, into a major motion picture. The film was directed by Steven Soderbergh and stars Matt Damon. Glass has stated that the radio show has no financial stake in the film, but noted that he appreciated how well the movie stuck to the original facts.

&quot;This American Life&quot;″s 361st episode&#x27;s, &quot;Fear of Sleep&quot;, section &quot;Stranger in the Night&quot; featured an excerpt from Mike Birbiglia&#x27;s one-man show, &quot;Sleepwalk with Me&quot;. This inspired Glass to work with Birbiglia for two years on a movie based on this segment. The film version of &quot;Sleepwalk with Me&quot; screened at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2012, to favorable reviews, winning the &quot;Best of NEXT Audience Award&quot;.

In May 2011, Walt Disney Pictures announced it was adapting a movie from a 2009 episode titled &quot;The Girlfriend Equation&quot;.

The 2018 film &quot;Come Sunday&quot; was based on a 2005 &quot;TAL&quot; story called &quot;Heretics,&quot; about controversial Tulsa preacher Carlton Pearson.

In 2019, Lulu Wang adapted her autobiographical story called &quot;What You Don&#x27;t Know&quot; from the 2016 episode &quot;In Defense of Ignorance&quot; into &quot;The Farewell&quot;.

The 2019 film &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; was adapted from a &quot;TAL&quot; story by Chris Higgins called &quot;I&#x27;ve Fallen in Love and I Can&#x27;t Get Up.&quot;

===Live tours===
&quot;This American Life&quot; has taken the radio show on the road three times since 2000; material recorded on each of the three tours has been edited into an episode which aired on the radio shortly after the tour. Other episodes include segments recorded live.
* &quot;Music Lessons&quot;, recorded at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco during the 1998 Public Radio Conference in San Francisco. Performers include Sarah Vowell, David Sedaris and Anne Lamott.

In New York, Boston, Seattle, Chicago, and Minneapolis, Mates of State were the house band, while in Los Angeles, OK Go performed between acts.

===Digital cinema===
On May 1, 2008, &quot;This American Life&quot; was the first major public media program to use digital cinema, distributing a one-hour-long program titled &quot;This American Life – Live!&quot; to select cinemas. PRI originally conceived of the idea to serve stations around the country. &quot;This American Life Live!&quot; was presented exclusively in select theatres by National CineMedia&#x27;s (NCM) Fathom, in partnership with BY Experience and Chicago Public Radio, and in association with Public Radio International.

On April 23, 2009, &quot;This American Life&quot; broadcast a second theater event, titled &quot;This American Life – Live! Returning to the Scene of the Crime&quot;. Contributors included Mike Birbiglia, Starlee Kine, Dan Savage, David Rakoff, and Joss Whedon.

On May 10, 2012, &quot;This American Life&quot; broadcast a third theater event, titled &quot;Invisible Made Visible&quot;. Contributors included David Sedaris, David Rakoff, Tig Notaro, Ryan Knighton, and Mike Birbiglia, who made a short film with Terry Gross.

On June 7, 2014, &quot;This American Life&quot; recorded a fourth live event titled &quot;The Radio Drama Episode&quot;. Contributors included Carin Gilfry, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mike Birbiglia, Joshua Bearman, and Sasheer Zamata. The episode was broadcast on radio and the podcast on June 20, 2014.

===Podcast===
From 1998 to 2005, the program could be accessed online in two formats: a free RealAudio stream available from the official show website, and a DRM-encrypted download available through Audible.com, which charged $4 per episode. In early 2006, the program began to offer MP3 copies of each episode, which could be streamed from the show&#x27;s website using a proprietary Flash player. Aware that more people were listening through headphones and so could hear mistakes more clearly, the production sought to improve the mixing and editing.

Since October 2006, the program has offered a free podcast feed to the public. Under this arrangement, each show is made available to podcast feeds and aggregation programs Sunday evening at 8 p.m. ET, allowing radio stations a 43-hour window of exclusivity to carry the episode. After seven days, the link to the MP3 is removed from the podcast feed. Older shows can be streamed online via the show&#x27;s website, or purchased from Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store for $0.95 per episode.

Since the move to MP3 files in 2006, the show has relied on an extremely lightweight digital rights management system, based on security through obscurity and legal threats. While the show episodes are removed from the podcast RSS feed after a week, they remain on &quot;This American Life&quot;″s server, accessible to anyone who knows the location. On at least three occasions, Internet users have created their own unofficial podcast feeds, deep linking to the MP3 files located on the &quot;This American Life&quot; webserver. In all three instances, the podcast feeds were removed from the Internet once representatives from Public Radio International contacted the individuals responsible for creating the feeds.

, a typical podcast episode was downloaded 750,000 times.

===Mobile apps===
In February 2010, Public Radio Exchange launched a mobile app on Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store. This app contains MP3 audio of the podcast.

In October 2016, &quot;This American Life&quot; launched an app called Shortcut to allow listeners to share short audio clips on social media, similar to the way gifs allow social media users to share video clips. Stephanie Foo served as project lead, collaborating with developers Courtney Stanton and Darius Kazemi of Feel Train. In the app, listeners can select an audio clip of up to 30 seconds to post to social media, where the audio plays and displays a transcription of the clip. The app&#x27;s initial iteration operates on &quot;This American Life&quot;&#x27;s archives, but the project code will be released as open-source software, available for other audio projects to adopt.

===Other media===
Some of the show&#x27;s episodes are accompanied by multimedia downloads available on &quot;This American Life&quot;&#x27;s website. For example, a cover version of the Elton John song &quot;Rocket Man&quot; was produced for episode 223, &quot;Classifieds&quot;, and released as an MP3.

Four two-disc CD sets collecting some of the producers&#x27; favorite acts have been released: &quot;Lies, Sissies, and Fiascoes: The Best of This American Life&quot; was released on May 4, 1999; &quot;Crimebusters + Crossed Wires: Stories from This American Life&quot; was released on November 11, 2003; &quot;Davy Rothbart: This American Life&quot; was released in 2004; and &quot;Stories of Hope and Fear&quot; was released on November 7, 2006.

A 32-page comic book, &quot;Radio: An Illustrated Guide&quot; (), documents how an episode of &quot;TAL&quot; is put together. It was drawn by cartoonist Jessica Abel, written by Abel and Glass, and first published in 1999.

The cover of &quot;The Lives They Lived&quot; edition of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; published on December 25, 2011, read &quot;These American Lives&quot; after a special section of the magazine edited by Glass and other staff of the show.

==Cultural impact==
Marc Fisher with &quot;American Journalism Review&quot; wrote, in a 1999 article on the show, that &quot;in ways small but clear, as inspiration if not direct model, &quot;This American Life&quot; is at the vanguard of a shift in American journalism.&quot; In the book &quot;Sound Streams—A Cultural History of Radio-Internet Convergence&quot;, author Andrew Bottomley calls the show &quot;the archetype of the modern US feature-documentary mode.&quot;

&quot;This American Life&quot; was an early adopter to the podcast format and became a forerunner of the medium. Steph Harmon with &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked that the show is &quot;often credited for ushering in not only a public radio revolution, but the rise of storytelling as an industry and podcasting as a form.&quot;

===Depictions in the media===
Television shows and movies have made allusions to the program. &quot;This American Life&quot; was referenced in a 2018 episode of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;.

Summer Roberts, in &quot;The O.C.,&quot; asked of &quot;This American Life&quot;, &quot;Is that that show by those hipster know-it-alls who talk about how fascinating ordinary people are? Ekhh. God.&quot; Glass, a fan of the teen soap opera, played the line during an episode about &quot;TAL&quot;″s 2007 live tour. After hearing the line, he said, &quot;I literally stood up and went like—like did that just happen?

During a crowd interaction in Mike Birbiglia&#x27;s 2017 standup special &#x27;Thank God for Jokes&#x27;, a frustrated Birbiglia exclaims &quot;We don&#x27;t all have to be Ira Glass here!&quot; in response to the audience member.

The show has also been the subject of parodies. The satirical newspaper &quot;The Onion&quot; published a story on April 20, 2007, entitled &quot;&#x27;This American Life&#x27; Completes Documentation Of Liberal, Upper-Middle-Class Existence.&quot; In 2011, comedy writer Julian Joslin (with Michael Grinspan) released a parody of &quot;TAL&quot; entitled &quot;This American Laugh&quot; on YouTube, wherein a fictional Glass makes a sex tape with Fresh Air&#x27;s Terry Gross. The spoof was viewed over 100,000 times in one week. In response, Glass said, &quot;hearing his version of me, made what I do on the air seem kind of dumb. And the impersonation was so good ... I had to decide, &#x27;Do I want to see myself as kind of trite and dumb?&#x27; Seemed better to stop.&quot; Fred Armisen parodied Ira Glass for a skit on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s &quot;Weekend Update&quot; in 2011. The skit was cut from the show on the grounds that Ira Glass was &quot;not famous enough&quot; to be parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Glass then invited Armisen to impersonate him as a guest co-host for an episode of &quot;TAL&quot; in January 2013. In 2013, Stanley Chase III, Mickey Dwyer, Ken Fletcher, and Matt Gifford launched the parody podcast &quot;That American Life&quot; on iTunes, which is hosted by &quot;Ira Class&quot;. In two episodes of season one of &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;, Robert Stanton portrays radio personality Maury Kind, an NPR host of a show called &quot;Urban Tales&quot;. The show within a show is a fictional portrayal of &quot;TAL&quot;.

Glass has made appearances as himself in fictional works. In the 2014 film &quot;Veronica Mars,&quot; the character Stosh &quot;Piz&quot; Piznarski works at &quot;This American Life,&quot; and Glass and many &quot;TAL&quot; staffers appear in background roles. Glass also had a cameo appearance in the 22nd-season premiere of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, entitled &quot;Elementary School Musical&quot;. Lisa plays &quot;This American Life&quot; on her iPod and Glass introduces the theme of the day&#x27;s show, &quot;Today in Five Acts: Condiments&quot;. In the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode, &quot;Honey, I&#x27;m Homeland&quot;, Glass plays himself in a voice-only role. Members of an &quot;Occupy&quot; group kidnap Stan after he tries to infiltrate their group. While he&#x27;s in captivity, they try to brainwash him by playing an episode of &quot;This American Life&quot; in which Glass talks about a dog and his owner, who also happens to be a dog. Stan objects to Glass&#x27;s pauses between lines, questioning why they are necessary if he already has them written down in front of him. When Stan has been fully brainwashed and is released, he continues to listen to Glass as he touts the benefits of paying for radio. In a season 6 episode of &quot;30 Rock&quot; called &quot;St. Patrick&#x27;s Day,&quot; Glass&#x27;s voice appears on the radio, apparently presenting &quot;TAL&quot;, with his studio having been overrun by drunken thugs. In the 2014 episode of &quot;Bojack Horseman&quot;, called &quot;Live Fast, Diane Nguyen,&quot; Glass voices Diane&#x27;s ring tone during a meeting with Bojack and his publisher, thanking her for being a sustaining member of public radio. Much of the &quot;TAL&quot; staff made a cameo on the season four opener of the HBO show &quot;High Maintenance&quot;, in an episode that told the story of a fictional new reporter at the radio program.

<doc id="307028" wikidata="Q2577005" url="?curid=307028" title="Superior court">
<text>In common law systems, a superior court is a court of general jurisdiction over civil and criminal legal cases. A superior court is &quot;superior&quot; in relation to a court with limited jurisdiction (see small claims court), which is restricted to civil cases involving monetary amounts with a specific limit, or criminal cases involving offenses of a less serious nature. A superior court may hear appeals from lower courts (see court of appeal). For courts of general jurisdiction in civil law system, see ordinary court.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;superior court&quot; has its origins in the English court system. The royal courts were the highest courts in the country, with what would now be termed supervisory jurisdiction over baronial and local courts. Decisions of those courts could be reviewed by the royal courts, as part of the Crown&#x27;s role as the ultimate fountain of justice. The royal courts became known as the &quot;superior courts&quot;, and lower courts whose decisions could be reviewed by the royal courts became known as &quot;inferior courts&quot;. The decisions of the superior courts were not reviewable or appealable unless an appeal was created by statute.

==In particular jurisdictions==
===Canada===

Superior Courts in Canada exist at the federal, provincial and territorial levels.

The provincial and territorial superior courts of original jurisdiction are courts of general jurisdiction: all legal matters fall within their jurisdiction, unless assigned elsewhere by statute passed by the appropriate legislative authority. Their jurisdiction typically includes civil lawsuits involving contracts, torts, property, and family law. They also have jurisdiction over criminal prosecutions for indictable offences under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; of Canada. They also hear civil appeals from decisions of the provincial and territorial &quot;inferior&quot; courts, as well as appeals from those courts in summary conviction matters under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. They also have jurisdiction of judicial review over administrative decisions by provincial or territorial government entities such as labour boards, human rights tribunals and licensing authorities.

The superior courts of appeal hear appeals from the superior courts of original jurisdiction, as well as from the inferior courts and administrative tribunals. The jurisdiction of the superior courts of appeal are entirely statutory. The details of their jurisdiction will vary depending on the laws passed by the federal government and the particular province or territory.

All judges of the superior courts are appointed by the federal government. Judges of provincial superior courts are appointed under the authority of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, while judges of the territorial superior courts are appointed under the authority of their respective territorial acts passed by the federal Parliament. The judges of the Federal Courts are appointed by the federal government under the authority of the &quot;Federal Courts Act&quot;.

=== Hong Kong ===

In Hong Kong, the Court of Final Appeal, the Court of Appeal and the Court of First Instance (the latter two form the High Court of Hong Kong), are all superior courts of record.

===South Africa===

The general superior courts of South Africa are the High Courts, the Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court.

The High Courts are courts of first instance with general jurisdiction; they can hear all cases except those where exclusive jurisdiction is granted by law to another court. Most cases are, however, tried in the magistrates&#x27; courts or other lower courts, and appeals from these courts are heard by the High Court.

The Supreme Court of Appeal is solely an appellate court, hearing appeals from the High Courts. The Constitutional Court is primarily an appellate court, hearing appeals on constitutional matters from the Supreme Court of Appeal or in some cases directly from the High Courts. The Constitutional Court also occasionally acts as a court of first instance in certain cases involving the constitutionality of laws and government actions.

There are also specialist superior courts with exclusive jurisdiction over certain matters; these include the Labour Court, the Labour Appeal Court, the Electoral Court and the Land Claims Court.

===United Kingdom===

The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, the High Court of England and Wales, and the Crown Court of England and Wales are all superior courts of record.

===United States===

In a number of jurisdictions in the United States, the Superior Court is a state trial court of general jurisdiction with power to hear and decide any civil or criminal action which is not specially designated to be heard in some other courts. California, Connecticut, Washington, Maine, the District of Columbia, and Georgia are all examples of such jurisdictions. In other states, equivalent courts are also known as courts of common pleas (Pennsylvania, Ohio, and others), circuit courts (Illinois, Michigan, Oregon and others), district courts (Hawaii, Louisiana, Texas, Utah, and others) or, in the case of New York, the Supreme Court.

The term &quot;superior court&quot; raises the obvious question of superior to &quot;what&quot;. Formerly, many jurisdictions had inferior trial courts of limited jurisdiction such as municipal courts, traffic courts, and justice of the peace courts, so it was natural to call the next level of courts &quot;superior.&quot; However, some states, like California, have unified their court systems. In California, all lower courts were absorbed into the Superior Courts of California after 1998. The lower courts now exist only as mere administrative subdivisions of the superior courts. The superior courts are legally no longer superior to any other trial courts. Thus, the term &quot;superior court&quot; persists in California only as a matter of tradition. Similarly, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia is the sole local trial court, and what would be inferior courts are divisions of that court, but, as a trial court, may hear appeals from administrative agencies such as the appeals board of the Department of Motor Vehicles or of the Department of Public Works.

In Pennsylvania, the Superior Court is an appellate court, hearing appeals of criminal cases and private civil cases from the Pennsylvania courts of common pleas. In New Jersey, the Superior Court comprises the Law Division and Chancery Division (trial courts of general jurisdiction, hearing cases at law and in equity respectively, with cases assigned to different parts of each court by legislation and court rule), and an Appellate Division that hears appeals from the other two parts. The Criminal Part of the Law Division and the Family Party of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court also hear appeals from the New Jersey municipal courts, courts with limited jurisdiction to hear lower-order criminal cases and to grant temporary restraining orders in domestic-violence cases. In Maine, the Superior Court is both a trial court of general jurisdiction and an appellate court that considers appeals from the Maine District Court in certain types of cases, as well as appeals from most state and municipal agencies.

<text>The following is a list of lieutenant governors of Ontario and the lieutenant governors of the former colony of Upper Canada. The office of Lieutenant Governor of Ontario was created in 1867, when the Province of Ontario was created upon Confederation. The predecessor office, lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, was a British colonial officer, appointed by the British government to administer the government of the colony, from 1791 to 1841. (Prior to 1791, the territory which is now Ontario was part of the old Province of Quebec, which was administered by the colonial governors of the Province of Quebec.)

In 1841, the two provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada were abolished and merged into the new Province of Canada, with a single Parliament and Governor General. Upper Canada was known as Canada West, but did not have a separate government or lieutenant governor. It was simply an administrative division of the Province of Canada.

Prior to Confederation, the lieutenant governors of Upper Canada were either British colonial administrators or British Army officers. The first lieutenant governor of Ontario, General Sir Henry William Stisted, was the last British lieutenant governor. From 1868 onwards, only Canadians were appointed to the position.

<doc id="307034" wikidata="Q2104918" url="?curid=307034" title="Portable Sound Format">
<text>The Portable Sound Format (PSF) is a music file format ripped directly from video games from a variety of video game consoles. The format was originally used for PlayStation video games, but has since been adapted to support other systems.

The PSF format was publicly documented by Neill Corlett in 2003, who also wrote a Winamp plug-in named &quot;Highly Experimental&quot; that plays PSF1 and PSF2 files.

Generally, PSF files contain a number of samples and a music sequencer player program. This takes far less space than an equivalent streamed format of the same music (WAV, MP3) while still sounding high fidelity. Background music stored in PSF files can usually be looped forever, as the sequencer handles its own loop points.

Several PSF sub-formats also have a &quot;miniPSF/PSFlib&quot; capability, wherein data used by multiple tracks is stored only once in an accompanying &quot;PSFlib&quot; file. Further differences are stored in a &quot;miniPSF&quot; file, which can be compressed via zlib to further increase storage efficiency.

A PSF2 file is the PlayStation 2 equivalent of a PSF. PSF2 is internally structured as a file system, rather than PSF, which is a single PS executable. PSF&#x27;s native sample rate is 44,100 Hz, while PSF2&#x27;s is 48,000 Hz. Rates may vary from 8,000 Hz to 96,000 Hz.

Both PSF and PSF2 files contain a header which specifies the type of video game system the file contains data for, and an optional set of tags at the end which can give detailed information such as game name, artist and length.

== PSF sub-formats ==

PSF initially stood only for &quot;PlayStation Sound Format&quot;, but with the addition of the PSF2, SSF (Sega Saturn Sound Format), DSF (Dreamcast Sound Format), USF (Nintendo Ultra 64 Sound Format), QSF (Capcom Q-Sound Format), GSF (Game Boy Advance Sound Format), and 2SF (Nintendo DS Sound Format) sub-formats, the more generic backronym &quot;Portable Sound Format&quot; was developed. As a result, PSF and PSF1 interchangeably refer to PlayStation sound data files.

=== GSF ===
GBA Sound Format (GSF) is an emulated Game Boy Advance audio format developed by Caitsith2 and Zoopd. The basic GSF file structure is a sub-format of PSF.

GSF players emulate the files as sound-only Game Boy Advance ROMs, and as such can be processor intensive when compared to mainstream audio formats.

=== USF ===

Nintendo Ultra64 Sound Format (USF) is a file format by Adam Gashlin that contains the sound-generating code from a Nintendo 64 video game. The basic USF file structure is a sub-format of PSF.

<text>Sean Allen Morley (born March 6, 1971), better known by his ring name Val Venis, is a Canadian retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his tenure in World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (WWF/WWE) from 1998 to 2009. He has also worked for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. 

During his career in WWF/WWE, Venis held the Intercontinental Championship twice, the European Championship once, and the World Tag Team Championship once with Lance Storm. As the masked Steele, he was the youngest person to win the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Training and early career (1994–1998) ===
He began his wrestling training in the early 1990s under the tutelage of Jason and Dewey &quot;The Missing Link&quot; Robertson and debuted on the Canadian independent circuit before making his way to the international circuit, finding work with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in Japan, Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), Promo Azteca, International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) in Mexico, International Wrestling Association (IWA) and World Wrestling Council (WWC) in Puerto Rico where he was one half of a tag team known as the Canadian Glamour Boys with Shane Sewell they were two time WWC World Tag Team Champions. In Japan, he was known as Sean Morgan as the name Morley was difficult to pronounce due to the lack of phonetic differences between the L and R in Japanese. In Mexico, he adopted a robot-like mask and gimmick, changed his name to Steele, and won the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE (1998-2009)===
==== European Champion; Intercontinental Champion (1998–2000) ====
Morley was signed to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1998 and given the gimmick of an adult movie star named &quot;Val Venis&quot;. The night after WrestleMania XIV, on the March 30 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, vignettes started to air that showcased Venis&#x27; lifestyle on and off the set. The most notable of these aired on May 4 and featured Venis with prominent real-life porn star Jenna Jameson. During this time he worked in dark matches while building up for his debut. 

He debuted on the May 18, 1998 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Scorpio. Almost immediately, he was involved in an angle with the Kaientai stable, involving him having an affair with Yamaguchi-San&#x27;s kayfabe wife, Shian-Li Tsang. As a result, the members of Kaientai had a series of unsuccessful matches against him. Venis made his pay-per-view debut at Fully Loaded: In Your House, defeating Jeff Jarrett. On the August 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, his tag team partner Taka Michinoku would eventually betray him, which led to him and Kaientai tying Venis up backstage where Yamaguchi-San attempted to castrate him with a sword.

The next week, however, he reported that he was saved by &quot;a little shrinkage&quot; and help from his friend, John Wayne Bobbitt. He then challenged the four Japanese wrestlers to a match, which they accepted under the conditions that it must be a gauntlet match, meaning that Venis would have to fight all four of them individually in one match. The match ended with Michinoku executing the Michinoku Driver on Venis and getting the three-count, ending his undefeated streak. The feud ended a week later, after Venis fought Michinoku to a no contest.

After feuding with Kaientai, Venis got his first title shot in the WWF at SummerSlam 1998 against European Champion D&#x27;Lo Brown for his championship. Venis was disqualified and as a result, Brown retained the title. Venis got involved in a storyline where he slept with other people&#x27;s wives. He started a feud with Dustin Runnels, on the September 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when Venis showed Runnels his new porn movie, featuring Venis in bed with Dustin&#x27;s wife, Terri Runnels. She then became his on-screen girlfriend. This culminated in a match at , which Venis won. On the October 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Venis participated in a tournament for the Intercontinental Championship, defeating Marc Mero in the first round before losing in the semifinals to Ken Shamrock. On the same night, Runnels returned to his Goldust gimmick. Venis continued his feud with Goldust, with Goldust gaining a victory at Judgment Day: In Your House. The two faced each other again at Capital Carnage, and Val went on to win the match, to end the feud. When Terri said she was pregnant, Val dumped her.

At the end of the year, he formed a short lived tag team with The Godfather, unofficially dubbed &quot;Supply and Demand&quot;. They began teaming on the December 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; against The Acolytes. Their team only lasted a week, including a match against Mark Henry and D&#x27;Lo Brown at Rock Bottom: In Your House, and a match against the Brood. at Royal Rumble, Venis competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Triple H, On the February 1, 1999 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he started a feud with Intercontinental Champion Ken Shamrock after Venis made a film starring him and Shamrock&#x27;s kayfabe sister Ryan called &quot;Saving Ryan&#x27;s Privates&quot;. At St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre: In Your House, Venis defeated Shamrock with the help of special guest referee Billy Gunn to win the Intercontinental Championship. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Venis defended the title against Gunn and retained the title.

A few days later, he broke up with Ryan and eventually lost the Intercontinental Title to Road Dogg after only a one-month reign as champion. Venis began a feud with Road Dogg and made his WrestleMania debut at WrestleMania XV, where he challenged for the Intercontinental title in a Four Corners Elimination match which also included Ken Shamrock and Goldust. Venis failed to win the match. Throughout the rest of the year, he found himself having &quot;woman troubles&quot; with Nicole Bass, Chyna, and Debra. At Over the Edge, Venis and Nicole Bass defeated Jeff Jarrett and Debra, Venis reunited with the Godfather and they began challenging for the Tag Team titles. on the May 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Venis was defeated by The Rock in the main event. Venis then entered the 1999 King of the Ring tournament but was eliminated in the first round by Chyna. On the July 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Venis and The Godfather faced the Hardy Boyz for the titles, but the Hardy Boyz retained the titles by getting disqualified. Venis and the Godfather started a feud with Droz and Albert. The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Venis and Godfather, Droz and Albert, and the Acolytes challenged the Hardys to a fatal four-way elimination tag team match for the titles, where the Hardys went on to retain the titles.

He started a feud with Steve Blackman and defeated him at Unforgiven. His next feud was with Mark Henry, whom he beat at Rebellion. He engaged in feuds with several main eventers including The Rock, Mankind, and Steve Austin. on the October 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Venis faced Stone Cold Steve Austin in the main event where he lost. At No Mercy, Venis faced Mankind in a winning effort. In late 1999, Venis started a feud with European Champion The British Bulldog over the title. At Survivor Series, Venis teamed up with Mark Henry, Gangrel, and Steve Blackman to face the British Bulldog and the Mean Street Posse with his team winning the match. 
At Armageddon, Venis pinned the British Bulldog in a triple threat match with D-Lo Brown to win the WWF European Championship. on the January 10 episode of Raw, Venis defeated Edge to retain the title. At the Royal Rumble, Venis competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Kane. On the February 10, 2000 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he dropped the European Title to Kurt Angle, ending his two-month reign. Around this time, Morley largely disappeared from WWF television programming until mid-May, due to a legitimate neck injury which limited his mobility. 

At King of the Ring in 2000, Venis participated in the King of the Ring tournament where he defeated Eddie Guerrero in the Quarter-Finals but was defeated by Rikishi in the semi-finals. This culminated in a feud between Venis and Rikishi which led to Venis turning heel by aligning himself with Trish Stratus. On the July 6, 2000 episode of Smackdown, he defeated Rikishi to win his second Intercontinental Championship, and aligned himself with Test and Albert. Venis and Rikishi continued their rivalry as Venis defended the title in a rematch at Fully Loaded. The match was notable for seeing Venis take a splash from Rikishi from the top of a 15-foot high steel cage and still going on to defeat Rikishi to retain the title. Soon after, Venis began sporting a new look that included a haircut, white boots and trunks - and the near total disposal of the porn star gimmick. At SummerSlam, Stratus inadvertently lost Venis&#x27; Intercontinental title to Chyna in a mixed tag team match involving the pair against the team of Chyna and Eddie Guerrero.

====Right to Censor (2000–2001)====

Shortly after, Venis underwent a complete change in persona and became a member of the Right to Censor (RTC) stable. Venis joined RTC after being abducted by Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather. He became a censorship-based character, directly contrasting with his previously on-screen character. Of this change, Morley said in an interview that &quot;the porn star gimmick and storylines kind of overshadowed my work,&quot; and that he wanted a more serious persona to better highlight his in-ring abilities and move towards being one of the WWF&#x27;s top heels. Morley has gone on record saying, the RTC character was his least favorite character, since he lost the core of his previous character and it was hard to wrestle wearing a tie and t-shirt. RTC feuded with the Acolytes and the Dudley Boyz, culminating in an eight-man tag team match at Unforgiven, which RTC won. On the October 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Venis got a shot at the WWF Championship against The Rock but failed to win the title. At No Mercy, Venis teamed up with Steven Richards to face Chyna and Mr. Ass. After interference from Eddie Guerrero, RTC picked up the win. On the November 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Venis lost to The Undertaker. On the November 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Venis defeated K-Kwik. Venis started a feud with Chyna, culminating in a match at Armageddon which Venis won. At the Royal Rumble, Venis competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by The Undertaker.

At WrestleMania X-Seven, RTC faced Tazz and the APA in a six-man tag match which RTC lost. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, he faced Kane for the Hardcore Championship but lost the match. On the April 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, RTC faced The Undertaker in a 4 on 1 handicap match where the other members of the group walked out on Steven Richards. Venis stayed in RTC until they disbanded right before the Invasion storyline, feuding with Chyna and &quot;The One&quot; Billy Gunn during his tenure with the group. When RTC broke up in June and the Invasion began in July, Venis disappeared from WWF television while recovering from surgery on his hip to remove bone spurs from his motorcycle racing days. After recovering, he was kept off television along with several other wrestlers, for whom WWF bookers could not come up with any storylines. Instead, he worked in WWF&#x27;s developmental territory Heartland Wrestling Association in late 2001.

====The Big Valbowski (2002)====
Venis returned to action back in his old gimmick, at the 2002 Royal Rumble, where he entered at #20 in the Royal Rumble match but was shortly after eliminated by Steve Austin. On &quot;Raw&quot; he had two very short feuds with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Mr. Perfect before being drafted to SmackDown! during the brand extension.

On &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he began calling himself &quot;The Big Valbowski&quot; in reference to the 1998 film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, and aligned himself with babyfaces Edge, Randy Orton, Billy Kidman, and Hardcore Holly and feuded with Chris Jericho, Deacon Batista, and Reverend D-Von.

In June, Venis competed in the 2002 King of the Ring tournament. He defeated Christian in the first round, then lost to Chris Jericho in the quarterfinals.

Morley was sidelined with a legitimate neck injury and laceration in late July, after gym equipment fell on him in Canada. He returned to wrestling &quot;SmackDown!&quot; dark matches in September, and made his last televised appearance as Val Venis on October 26 at Rebellion, where he teamed with Chuck Palumbo in a loss to Reverend D-Von and Ron Simmons.

====Chief of Staff; World Tag Team Champion (2002–2003)====
He returned to television on the November 18 episode on &quot;Raw&quot; under his real name, Sean Morley. He was appointed Raw &quot;Chief of Staff&quot; by Raw General Manager, Eric Bischoff, turning heel once again by acting as Bischoff&#x27;s assistant and going by Chief Morley. Morley began a feud with the Dudley Boyz in March 2003. On the March 24, 2003 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he officially became one half of the World Tag Team Champions with Lance Storm after Storm&#x27;s partner, William Regal, was sidelined with an illness. Storm and Morley successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship on the episode of &quot;Heat&quot; prior to WrestleMania XIX at Safeco Field against Rob Van Dam and Kane with help from the Dudley Boyz, only to lose them to Kane and Van Dam the next night.

====Late WWE career (2003–2009)====
Morley was &quot;fired&quot; from his assistant job by Bischoff after he lost a match to Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler in which Jim Ross&#x27; job was on the line. He was quickly &quot;rehired&quot; by co-General Manager, Stone Cold Steve Austin. After returning as Val Venis, he participated in a battle royal at Judgment Day for the vacant Intercontinental Championship, won by Christian. Throughout mid-2003, 2004, and the first half of 2005, Venis became a face again, but did not get much in the way of a push. Venis began wrestling as a mid-carder on &quot;Heat&quot; and on the September 14, 2003 episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, he faced Christian in another match for the Intercontinental Championship, which Christian won.

He reformed his previous tag team with Lance Storm as faces, but the partnership faded and Venis became utilized mainly as a &quot;jobber to the stars&quot;. At Armageddon, Venis and Storm competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship which was won by Batista and Ric Flair. In 2005, he started shaving his head bald. He defeated Ring of Honor wrestler and future WWE Champion CM Punk in Punk&#x27;s first WWE tryout match on May 9, 2005, which led to CM Punk getting a contract and being sent to developmental. On the January 2 episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, Venis lost to Ric Flair in the main event of the night.

At WrestleMania 21, Venis competed in a 30-man Interpromotional battle royal which was won by Booker T. In the summer of 2005 he formed another team, V-Squared, with Viscera. While wrestling on &quot;Heat&quot;, they squashed a number of other tag teams including the World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch in a non-title match. On the December 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, V-Squared participated in a fatal four-way match for the World Tag Team Championship, including the champions Big Show and Kane, The Heart Throbs, and Snitsky and Tyson Tomko but were defeated. Venis and Viscera continued to team in 2006, getting another shot at Big Show and Kane&#x27;s titles, while occasionally having solo matches. In March 2006, Venis suffered a kayfabe injury at the hands of the Spirit Squad which allowed him to take time off for legitimate elbow surgery, during which about a dozen more bone spurs were removed, six others were shaved down, and a nerve was transplanted.

While he was out, Viscera began teaming with Charlie Haas, leaving Venis to team with Snitsky upon his return in a team that didn&#x27;t last long. Venis began a feud with Eugene on &quot;Heat&quot; when Eugene interrupted and attacked him during a &quot;Kiss Cam&quot; segment on December 4. On the following episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, Venis and Eugene had a match which Eugene won. On the December 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Val participated in a #1 contender&#x27;s battle royal, won by Edge. In February 2007, WWE.com launched a new broadband network giving fans an opportunity to access free videos, and Venis was given his own show called &quot;Sex-U&quot;. The show would see Venis and a special guest offering love tips to the viewing audience. &quot;Sex-U&quot; was the most popular show in the first three months of the new broadband network and its four episodes were streamed more than 800,000 times. No new episodes were made after this and the show was removed from WWE.com without reason shortly afterwards. On the March 19, 2007 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he participated in a Money in the Bank qualifying battle royal, won by Edge.

In late 2007, he began a feud with Santino Marella. During the feud, Marella gave Venis a sneak attack, causing him an injury. The two had a match on the October 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, which Marella won. On the February 18, 2008 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he lost to Mr. Kennedy in a Money in the Bank qualifying match. On the March 25 episode of &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot;, he participated in a twelve-on-twelve tag team match involving all the participants of the battle royal. At WrestleMania XXIV, he participated in a pre-show number one contender&#x27;s battle royal, with the winner facing ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero later that night. Kane went on to win the battle royal. On the April 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Venis fell to Umaga. On the April 14 tapings for &quot;Heat&quot;, he lost his last WWE match to Snitsky. Morley spent the rest of 2008 out of action due to an injury, during which WWE transitioned to the more family-friendly PG Era and his traditional porn star gimmick would no longer be appropriate for the company&#x27;s target demographics of children. On January 9, 2009, he was released from his WWE contract after over a decade of working for the company.

=== Independent circuit (2009–2010) ===
After his release from WWE, Morley toured in Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), losing to Hiroshi Tanahashi on March 22, 2009, and with Hulk Hogan&#x27;s tour of the world which started in Melbourne, Australia.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2010) ===
Morley made his debut for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on the January 4, 2010, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; in a backstage segment with The Beautiful People. On the January 14 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Morley had another segment, complete with revamped theme music, where he explained that he was no longer an adult film star, but rather an adult film producer. This led to Daniels coming to the ring and attacking him, setting up a match at the Genesis pay-per-view. At the pay-per-view Morley defeated Daniels in his first match for the company with his patented Money Shot. On the January 28 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Morley suffered his first loss in TNA, losing to Desmond Wolfe in an 8 Card Stud Tournament qualifying match. On the March 4, 2010, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Morley pinned Jeff Jarrett in an impromptu Falls Count Anywhere match by order of Eric Bischoff, turning heel for the first time in TNA. However, the next day Morley announced on his Facebook page that largely due to the move of &quot;Impact!&quot; to Monday nights, his original plan to wrestle for both TNA and CMLL had to change and therefore he was done with TNA.

=== Later career (2010–2019) ===
Morley worked with Elite Xtreme Wrestling now known as Future Stars of Wrestling as Val Venis where he was a former EXW Tag Team Champion with Dexter Verity. On April 16, 2011, Venis defeated Rhett Titus in Franklin, Pennsylvania for a special IWC Nights of Legends event. Three events later Venis challenged John McChesney for the IWC World Heavyweight Championship but was unsuccessful.

In late 2011, Morley returned to Canada wrestling for Championship Wrestling International, Venis defeated former World Tag Team Champion Sylvain Grenier in Lindsay, Ontario, Canada. The following day Venis defeated Chris Masters at CWI Fall Brawl 2 in Caledonia, Ontario, Canada.

On June 1, 2012, Morley lost to former WWE wrestler and tag partner Big Daddy V in New York City for ECPW Five Boros.

In 2013 Morley returned to Canada working in Manitoba&#x27;s Canadian Wrestling&#x27;s Elite and 2014 in British Columbia&#x27;s Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling and Invasion Championship Wrestling where he reunited with his former WWE tag partner The Godfather.

Morley toured in England for House of Pain: Evolution where he defeated Marty Scurll in Derby, England on June 19, 2015.

On April 5, 2019, Morley teamed with Joey Ryan and SeXXXy Eddy losing to Scarlett Bordeaux, Priscilla Kelly and Martina in a six tag intergender match at Wrestlecon Joey Ryan&#x27;s Penis Party in New York City.

==Personal life==
Morley speaks social Spanish, which he learned during the time he spent in Mexican lucha libre promotions. His sister, Alannah Morley, was married to Adam &quot;Edge&quot; Copeland between 2001 and 2004, after she had been in a relationship with Copeland since 1998.

Morley is an advocate for the legalisation of cannabis, and now works as a budtender at &quot;Health for Life&quot; marijuana dispensary in Mesa, Arizona.

===Controversy===
In February 2020, Morley came under fire from many wrestlers and wrestling fans after making several comments criticizing All Elite Wrestling (AEW)&#x27;s decision to put their women&#x27;s championship on a transgender wrestler, Nyla Rose. Morley commented on his Twitter and Facebook profiles, arguing that Rose was a biological man and saying only a &quot;real woman&quot; should be holding a women&#x27;s championship. Several professional wrestlers in many promotions immediately came to Rose&#x27;s defense, most notably Cody and Dustin Rhodes, and criticized Morley&#x27;s views. In February 2024, Morley would receive similar backlash for an edited image of a selfie involving Cody Rhodes and a transgender flag that a trans fan brought to a WWE live event, saying that the trans fan &quot;needs the power of Jesus to affirm their salvation instead of affirming a mental disorder.&quot; Mat Koon, a wrestling podcast host and musician, would later buy the valvenis.com domain and have it redirected to the National Center for Transgender Equality&#x27;s website.

Morley has been known to express libertarian political beliefs and to be a believer in QAnon conspiracy theories. On his YouTube channel, &quot;Top Shelf Anarchy,&quot; he advocates for anarchy and claims that &quot;the government&quot; is a &quot;criminal organization.&quot; His channel features several videos of Morley attempting to film in facilities that prohibit video recording, and the resulting confrontations with security and law enforcement officers, a practice described by practitioners as &quot;First Amendment audits&quot;. Morley has on multiple occasions posted COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on his social media pages. In January 2021, Morley was temporarily banned from Twitter for violating their child sexual exploitation policy after posting a photo which he claimed showed Hunter Biden having sex with Malia Obama.

<text>A Christian Science Reading Room is a facility operated as a public service by a Christian Science church in the community where that church exists. The local branches of The Mother Church (The First Church of Christ, Scientist) in Boston, Massachusetts, maintain these rooms as a place where one may study and contemplate the Bible and Christian Science literature in a quiet atmosphere, similar to a library.

Literature and other items related to the study of Christian Science may be borrowed or purchased. There are approximately 2,000 Christian Science Reading Rooms worldwide.

== Background and purpose ==
Reading Rooms were established in 1899 by a by-law in the &quot;Manual of The Mother Church&quot;, the book which governs the Christian Science church. They were created to provide both a quiet place for reading, study and prayer and a means for the public to come into contact with Christian Science. They also offer Christian Science books, periodicals, and other media for sale.

Eleven years before the &quot;Manual&quot; by-law, there was an earlier concept of reading room and a dispensary of literature and services for those unable to afford to pay for Christian Science treatment or transportation to a Christian Science church. In Boston, these efforts were halted in 1894 to concentrate on building the original Mother Church.

Both library and bookstore, it is a &quot;harbor of rest&quot; for quiet meditation and prayer, where one may study or purchase the Bible and the church&#x27;s denominational textbook, &quot;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&quot; written by Mary Baker Eddy, who is known as the Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science. Also available are the denomination&#x27;s other main books, the King James Version of the Bible and &quot;Prose Works&quot;, a volume of collected works also written by Eddy. Also available are the denomination’s religious periodicals: a monthly publication, &quot;The Christian Science Journal&quot;; the weekly &quot;Christian Science Sentinel&quot;; &quot;The Herald of Christian Science&quot;, published for speakers of languages other than English; and the &quot;Christian Science Quarterly&quot;, used worldwide to study the religion&#x27;s Bible &quot;lesson-sermons.&quot;

In addition, there are various religious pamphlets and audio recordings, as well as &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, an international newspaper. Reading rooms in countries that speak other languages often have a limited stock of English-language reading material; those in large cities in anglophone countries usually stock books and periodicals in one or more foreign languages.

Reading rooms are often storefronts in a busy part of a city, though some are situated within the local church&#x27;s building. Hours of business vary from reading room to reading room; some are open during regular retail business hours, others less frequently. The person working there is called a &quot;librarian&quot;, indicative of the atmosphere to be found. Reading rooms are staffed by members of the local Christian Science church.

Jointly-maintained reading rooms (operated jointly by several Christian Science churches) operate in a number of locations, for example a jointly maintained room in John Street, New York City, is maintained by the Christian Science branch churches of New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.

Reading Rooms may hold events, such as bible study groups, and may offer resources to help homeless populations in their city.

==Part of the American landscape==

In many parts of the U.S., Christian Science Reading Rooms are ubiquitous parts of the downtown landscape. A book by Kristin Hahn speaks of &quot;Breezing by the Christian Science Reading Rooms prominently centered on main streets all across America.&quot;

Novelists use them to characterize respectable-but-prosaic commercial districts. A mystery novel by Loren D. Estleman characterizes the location of a detective office by putting it among a beauty school, a plumbing supply store, &quot;a hearing-aid shop, [and] a Christian Science reading room next to a medical supply outlet.&quot; A fictional cop in a novel by Peter Plate steers a patrol car &quot;past Siegal&#x27;s Tuxedo Shop, Queen&#x27;s Shoes, Discoteca Latina, The Eggroll Express, The Christian Science Reading Room, and Duc Loi&#x27;s Meat and Fish Company.&quot; The Simpsons&#x27; fictional town of Springfield contains one.

<doc id="307039" wikidata="Q558404" url="?curid=307039" title="Alcoholic liver disease">
<text>Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), also called alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), is a term that encompasses the liver manifestations of alcohol overconsumption, including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and chronic hepatitis with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.
It is the major cause of liver disease in Western countries, and is the leading cause of death from excessive drinking. Although steatosis (fatty liver disease) will develop in any individual who consumes a large quantity of alcoholic beverages over a long period of time, this process is transient and reversible. More than 90% of all heavy drinkers develop fatty liver whilst about 25% develop the more severe alcoholic hepatitis, and 15% liver cirrhosis.

For patients with chronic hepatitis B, a strict adherence to abstinence is highly recommended.

==Presentation==

==Risk factors==
Risk factors known as of 2010 are:
* Quantity of alcohol taken: Consumption of 60–80 g per day (14 g is considered one standard drink in the US, e.g. hard liquor, wine, beer; drinking a six-pack of 5% ABV beer daily would be 84 g and just over the upper limit) for 20 years or more in men, or 20 g/day for women significantly increases the risk of hepatitis and fibrosis by 6% to 41%.
* Pattern of drinking: Drinking outside of meal times increases up to 3 times the risk of alcoholic liver disease.
* Sex: Women are twice as susceptible to alcohol-related liver disease, and may develop alcoholic liver disease with shorter durations and doses of chronic consumption. The lesser amount of alcohol dehydrogenase secreted in the gut, higher proportion of body fat in women, and changes in alcohol absorption due to the menstrual cycle may explain this phenomenon.
* Ethnicity: Higher rates of alcohol-related liver disease, unrelated to differences in amounts of alcohol consumed, are seen in African-American and Hispanic males compared to Caucasian males.
* Hepatitis C infection: A concomitant hepatitis C infection significantly accelerates the process of liver injury.
* Genetic factors: Genetic factors predispose both to alcoholism and to alcoholic liver disease. Both monozygotic twins are more likely to be alcoholics and to develop liver cirrhosis than both dizygotic twins. Polymorphisms in the enzymes involved in the metabolism of alcohol, such as ADH, ALDH, CYP4502E1, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytokine polymorphism may partly explain this genetic component. However, no specific polymorphisms have currently been firmly linked to alcoholic liver disease.
* Iron overload (hemochromatosis).
* Diet: Malnutrition, particularly vitamin A and E deficiencies, can worsen alcohol-induced liver damage by preventing regeneration of hepatocytes. This is particularly a concern as alcoholics are usually malnourished because of a poor diet, anorexia, and encephalopathy.

==Pathophysiology==

The mechanism of ALD is not completely understood. 80% of alcohol passes through the liver to be detoxified. Chronic consumption of alcohol results in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, interleukin 6 and interleukin 8), oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and acetaldehyde toxicity. These factors cause inflammation, apoptosis and eventually fibrosis of liver cells. Why this occurs in only a few individuals is still unclear. Additionally, the liver has tremendous capacity to regenerate and even when 75% of hepatocytes are dead, it continues to function as normal.

===Fatty change===

Fatty change, or steatosis, is the accumulation of fatty acids in liver cells. This can be seen as fatty globules under the microscope. Alcoholism causes development of large fatty globules (macro-vesicular steatosis) throughout the liver and can begin to occur after a few days of heavy drinking. Alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) into acetaldehyde, then further metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) into acetic acid, which is finally oxidized into carbon dioxide () and water (). This process generates NADH, and increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio. A higher NADH concentration induces fatty acid synthesis while a decreased NAD level results in decreased fatty acid oxidation. Subsequently, the higher levels of fatty acids signal the liver cells to compound it to glycerol to form triglycerides. These triglycerides accumulate, resulting in fatty liver.

===Alcoholic hepatitis===

Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by the inflammation of hepatocytes. Between 10% and 35% of heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis (NIAAA, 1993). While development of hepatitis is not directly related to the dose of alcohol, some people seem more prone to this reaction than others. This is called alcoholic steato-necrosis and the inflammation appears to predispose to liver fibrosis. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8) are thought to be essential in the initiation and perpetuation of liver injury and cytotoxic hepatomegaly by inducing apoptosis and severe hepatotoxicity. One possible mechanism for the increased activity of TNF-α is the increased intestinal permeability due to liver disease. This facilitates the absorption of the gut-produced endotoxin into the portal circulation. The Kupffer cells of the liver then phagocytose endotoxin, stimulating the release of TNF-α. TNF-α then triggers apoptotic pathways through the activation of caspases, resulting in cell death.

===Cirrhosis===

Cirrhosis is a late stage of serious liver disease marked by inflammation (swelling), fibrosis (cellular hardening) and damaged membranes preventing detoxification of chemicals in the body, ending in scarring and necrosis (cell death). Between 10% and 20% of heavy drinkers will develop cirrhosis of the liver (NIAAA, 1993). Acetaldehyde may be responsible for alcohol-induced fibrosis by stimulating collagen deposition by hepatic stellate cells. The production of oxidants derived from NADPH oxi- dase and/or cytochrome P-450 2E1 and the formation of acetaldehyde-protein adducts damage the cell membrane.
Symptoms include jaundice (yellowing), liver enlargement, and pain and tenderness from the structural changes in damaged liver architecture. Without total abstinence from alcohol use, cirrhosis will eventually lead to liver failure. Late complications of cirrhosis or liver failure include portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the portal vein due to the increased flow resistance through the damaged liver), coagulation disorders (due to impaired production of coagulation factors), ascites (heavy abdominal swelling due to buildup of fluids in the tissues) and other complications, including hepatic encephalopathy and the hepatorenal syndrome.
Cirrhosis can also result from other causes than hazardous alcohol use, such as viral hepatitis and heavy exposure to toxins other than alcohol. The late stages of cirrhosis may look similar medically, regardless of cause. This phenomenon is termed the &quot;final common pathway&quot; for the disease.
Fatty change and alcoholic hepatitis with abstinence can be reversible. The later stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis tend to be irreversible, but can usually be contained with abstinence for long periods of time.

==Diagnosis==
In the early stages, patients with ALD exhibit subtle and often no abnormal physical findings. It is usually not until development of advanced liver disease that stigmata of chronic liver disease become apparent. Early ALD is usually discovered during routine health examinations when liver enzyme levels are found to be elevated. These usually reflect alcoholic hepatic steatosis. Microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis with inflammation are seen in liver biopsy specimens. These histologic features of ALD are indistinguishable from those of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Steatosis usually resolves after discontinuation of alcohol use. Continuation of alcohol use will result in a higher risk of progression of liver disease and cirrhosis. In patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis, clinical manifestations include fever, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and possible hepatic decompensation with hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and ascites accumulation. Tender hepatomegaly may be present, but abdominal pain is unusual. Occasionally, the patient may be asymptomatic.

=== Laboratory findings ===
In people with alcoholic hepatitis, the serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio is greater than 2:1. AST and ALT levels are almost always less than 500. The elevated AST to ALT ratio is due to deficiency of pyridoxal phosphate, which is required in the ALT enzyme synthetic pathway. Furthermore, alcohol metabolite–induced injury of hepatic mitochondria results in AST isoenzyme release. Other laboratory findings include red blood cell macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume &gt; 100) and elevations of serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels. Folate level is reduced in alcoholic patients due to decreased intestinal absorption, increased bone marrow requirement for folate in the presence of alcohol, and increased urinary loss. The magnitude of leukocytopenia (white blood cell depletion) reflects severity of liver injury. Histologic features include Mallory bodies, giant mitochondria, hepatocyte necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration in the area around the veins. Mallory bodies, which are also present in other liver diseases, are condensations of cytokeratin components in the hepatocyte cytoplasm and do not contribute to liver injury. Up to 70% of patients with moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis already have cirrhosis identifiable on biopsy examination at the time of diagnosis.

==Treatment==
Not drinking further alcohol is the most important part of treatment. People with chronic HCV infection should abstain from any alcohol intake, due to the risk for rapid acceleration of liver disease.

=== Medications ===
A 2006 Cochrane review did not find evidence sufficient for the use of androgenic anabolic steroids. Corticosteroids are sometimes used; however, this is recommended only when severe liver inflammation is present.

Silymarin has been investigated as a possible treatment, with ambiguous results. One review claimed benefit for S-adenosyl methionine in disease models.

The effects of anti-tumor necrosis factor medications such as infliximab and etanercept are unclear and possibly harmful. Evidence is unclear for pentoxifylline. Propylthiouracil may result in harm.

Evidence does not support supplemental nutrition in liver disease.

=== Transplantation ===
Although in rare cases liver cirrhosis is reversible, the disease process remains mostly irreversible. Liver transplantation remains the only definitive therapy. Today, survival after liver transplantation is similar for people with ALD and non-ALD. The requirements for transplant listing are the same as those for other types of liver disease, except for a 6-month sobriety prerequisite along with psychiatric evaluation and rehabilitation assistance. Specific requirements vary among the transplant centers. Relapse to alcohol use after transplant listing results in delisting. Re-listing is possible in many institutions, but only after 3–6 months of sobriety. There are limited data on transplant survival in patients transplanted for acute alcoholic hepatitis, but it is believed to be similar to that in nonacute ALD, non-ALD, and alcoholic hepatitis with MDF less than 32.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for people with ALD depends on the liver histology as well as cofactors, such as concomitant chronic viral hepatitis. Among patients with alcoholic hepatitis, progression to liver cirrhosis occurs at 10–20% per year, and 70% will eventually develop cirrhosis. Despite cessation of alcohol use, only 10% will have normalization of histology and serum liver enzyme levels. As previously noted, the MDF has been used to predict short-term mortality (i.e., MDF ≥ 32 associated with spontaneous survival of 50–65% without corticosteroid therapy, and MDF &lt; 32 associated with spontaneous survival of 90%). The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has also been found to have similar predictive accuracy in 30-day (MELD &gt; 11) and 90-day (MELD &gt; 21) mortality. Liver cirrhosis develops in 6–14% of those who consume more than 60–80 g of alcohol daily for men and more than 20 g daily for women. Even in those who drink more than 120 g daily, only 13.5% will experience a serious alcohol-related liver injury. Nevertheless, alcohol-related mortality was the third leading cause of death in 2003 in the United States. Worldwide mortality is estimated to be 150,000 per year. Alcoholic liver disease can lead to the development of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

<text>Tesoro Corporation, known briefly as Andeavor, was a Fortune 100 and a &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500 company headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, with 2017 annual revenues of $35 billion, and over 14,000 employees worldwide. Based on 2017 revenue, the company ranked No. 90 in the 2018 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

Tesoro was an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, operating ten refineries in the Western United States with a combined rated crude oil capacity of approximately per day. Tesoro&#x27;s retail-marketing system included approx. 3,000 branded retail gas stations, of which more than 595 were company-operated under its own Tesoro brandname, as well as Shell, ExxonMobil, ARCO, and USA Gasoline brands.

Tesoro, known at the time as Andeavor, was acquired by Marathon Petroleum on October 1, 2018.

==History==
Tesoro was founded in 1968 by Dr. Robert Van Osdell West Jr (1921–2006), and was primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. Tesoro began operating its first refinery, near Kenai, Alaska, in 1969. Tesoro became the first Fortune 500 company to be headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. 
&quot;&quot; is the word for &quot;treasure&quot; (or &quot;treasury&quot;) in Italian and Spanish. 

Beginning in the late 1990s, Tesoro grew through a series of acquisitions and initiatives that created Tesoro Corporation, the company focusing on the core business of petroleum refining, marketing, maritime transportation and distribution. The first segment involved the operation of six petroleum refineries situated in California, Alaska, Washington, Hawaii, North Dakota, and Utah. For its marketing and distribution segment, Tesoro sold refined gas and fuel products in both bulk and wholesale markets. Acquisitions expanded refining capacity from to approximately .

Prior to its acquisition by Marathon Petroleum in 2018, Tesoro was the third-largest independent petroleum refining and marketing company in the United States. The merger between the two companies formed the largest American refiner by capacity and the fifth in the world. 

Milestones in Tesoro&#x27;s history are:

* 1998: acquires second refinery (after Nikiski) in Kapolei, Hawaii along with petroleum terminals and approximately 30 retail stations in Hawaii from BHP Americas — also acquires the former Shell refinery at Anacortes, Washington;
* 1999: sells exploration and production operations;
* 2001: purchases refineries in Mandan, North Dakota, and Salt Lake City, Utah from BP Amoco;
* 2002: acquires Golden Eagle Refinery in Martinez, California from Ultramar (Valero);
* 2003: sells Tesoro Marine Services to Martin Midstream: Tesoro Marine Services were operating fueling and supply terminals servicing US Gulf Coast oil and gas exploration — also made a series of refinery acquisitions that boosted the company&#x27;s capacity output and positioned it for future expansion in key growth markets throughout the Western United States;
* 2005: largest capital expansion program in Tesoro Corporation&#x27;s history and record earnings;
* 2007: announcement of purchase of Shell&#x27;s refinery at Los Angeles refinery and approximately 250 Southern California retail stations;
* 2007: Tesoro acquires USA Gasoline;
* 2009: Tesoro employees move into a newly completed corporate campus in July;
* 2011: Tesoro forms Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) as a master limited partnership;
* 2011: Tesoro acquires 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California;
* 2012: Tesoro changes the 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California to USA Gasoline;
* 2013: Tesoro purchases the Carson refinery and the ARCO brand from BP;
* 2013: Tesoro sells its Kapolei refinery to Par Petroleum (now Par Pacific Holdings);
* 2016: Tesoro purchases Dakota Prairie Refining in Dickinson, North Dakota from WBI Energy; construction of the refinery was completed in the spring of 2015; 
* 2016: Tesoro Corp agrees to buy Western Refining for $4.1 billion;
* 2016/17: Par Pacific Inc. rebrands its Tesoro and 76 gas stations as HELE;
*2017: Tesoro announces its change of name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining; On August 1, 2017, the company changed its ticker symbol to &quot;ANDV&quot; from &quot;TSO&quot;;
*2018: Andeavor announced its entering into a definitive merger agreement with Marathon Petroleum with Marathon Petroleum acquiring all of Andeavor&#x27;s outstanding shares; the merger was closed on October 1.

==Media controversy==

===Environmental record===
Having taken over BP installations, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute identified Tesoro as being the 24th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, releasing roughly of toxic chemicals annually. Major pollutants emitted annually by the corporation were estimated to include more than of sulfuric acid,
following which the Environmental Protection Agency named Tesoro a potentially responsible party for at least four superfund toxic waste sites.
Tesoro settled and/or closed each of the superfund sites where it was named as one of many responsible parties. Tesoro was listed as a &quot;de minimis&quot; contributor to a superfund site in Abbeville, LA, and the site has since been closed by the EPA.

Tesoro gave over $1 million in support of California Proposition 23, which aimed to suspend the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.

Defenders of the Amazon forest in South America cite Tesoro for sourcing some of their crude oil from the Amazon. Three of Tesoro&#x27;s refineries - Anacortes (WA), LA (CA) and Golden Eagle (CA), were known to process Amazonian crude oil.

===Explosion===
On April 2, 2010, an explosion at Tesoro&#x27;s refinery in Anacortes, Washington, killed seven workers.

===Hawaii refinery===
Tesoro bought Libyan crude oil, after the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, in early April 2011 from the Vitol Group to supply its then-Hawaiian refinery.

<text>The Continental Mark III is a personal luxury car marketed by Lincoln from the 1969–1971 model years. The namesake successor of the 1956–1957 Continental Mark II, the Mark III likewise served as the flagship vehicle of Ford Motor Company. Offered as a two-door hardtop coupe, the Mark III was noted for its hidden headlights, Continental spare recalling the Mark II and its Rolls-Royce styled grille. 

The Mark III was developed as a direct competitor to the Cadillac Eldorado, creating a three-decade market rivalry between it and the Continental Mark series.

To avoid the exceptionally high development and production costs of its largely hand-built, extremely low-volume predecessor, the Mark III shared its chassis with the four door Ford Thunderbird. Model-specific design elements, including its hidden headlamps and large chrome grille distinguished the two — while sharing the same roof structure and rear windows, retractable into the C pillar, of the two door Thunderbird. . In a first for an American car, the 1970 Mark III was fitted with Michelin &quot;X&quot; Radial Tires as standard equipment.

Ford manufactured the Mark III at its Wixom Assembly Plant facility in Michigan alongside the Thunderbird and the Lincoln Continental. For 1972, in alignment with a Thunderbird redesign, the Mark III was superseded by the Continental Mark IV.

== History ==

The Continental Mark III was the brainchild of Lee Iacocca, Ford&#x27;s vice-president, car and truck group in 1965, who directed Design Vice President, Gene Bordinat, to &quot;put a Rolls-Royce grille on a Thunderbird&quot; that September. Development was assigned by Iacocca to the new &quot;Strawberry Studio&quot;- a special development preproduction team led by Bordinat. The Mark III was based on the fourth generation Lincoln Continental (1961–1969) and the four-door fifth generation Thunderbird introduced for 1967. With the Thunderbird &quot;dying in the marketplace&quot; Iacocca wanted to put the company&#x27;s development investment to better use by expanding its platform over several models. The final design of the Mark III was introduced to a Lincoln-Mercury Focus Group in mid January 1966- receiving an overwhelmingly negative response from the group. Despite this feedback, both Iacocca and Henry Ford II loved the design and overruled objections. On March 24, 1966, the Mark III was given the green light for production.

The Mark III was intended to compete head-to-head with the top of the domestic personal luxury car market, Cadillac&#x27;s then rear wheel drive seventh generation Eldorado. This placed it above the second-tier premium personal luxury cars such as the Ford Thunderbird, Buick Riviera, Oldsmobile Toronado and Chrysler New Yorker coupe. As the Eldorado was built upon the Toronado frame, the Mark III was based on the Thunderbird&#x27;s. While the side-rail frame was identical to the Thunderbird&#x27;s, the Mark III bore almost more bodywork. Power was adequate from Lincoln&#x27;s Ford 385 engine-based &quot;gross horsepower&quot; V8.

The Mark III was unveiled at the 1968 running of the 12 Hours of Sebring on March 23, 1968, as an early 1969 model. The model was a significant financial success because it combined the high unit revenue of a luxury model with the low development costs and fixed cost–amortizing utility of platform-sharing with a less-expensive, downscale car, in a vehicle that was appealing enough to buyers that many units were sold. Iacocca said, &quot;We brought out the Mark III in April 1968, and in its very first year it outsold the Cadillac Eldorado, which had been our long-range goal. For the next five years [Marks III and IV] we had a field day, in part because the car had been developed on the cheap. We did the whole thing for $30 million, a bargain-basement price because we were able to use existing parts and designs.&quot; Iacocca explained that this transformed the Lincoln-Mercury Division from losing money on every luxury car (via low unit sales on high fixed costs) to a profit center, making the new Mark series as big a success as any he ever had in his career—a remarkable statement from an executive who led the programs for the original Ford Mustang and the Chrysler minivan family. Iacocca explained of the Mark series, &quot;The Mark is [in 1984] Ford&#x27;s biggest moneymaker, just as Cadillac is for General Motors. It&#x27;s the Alfred Sloan theory: you have to have something for everybody [...] you always need a poor man&#x27;s car [...] but then you need upscale cars, too, because you never know when the blue-collar guy is going to be laid off. It seems that in the United States the one thing you can count on is that even during a depression, the rich get richer. So you always have to have some goodies for them.&quot;

Even though it was fundamentally a stretched, upscaled Thunderbird, the 1969 Continental Mark III traded on being a spiritual successor to the limited-production, hand-built, ultra-luxurious Continental Mark II produced by the short-lived Continental Division of the Ford Motor Company between 1956 and 1957. As such, it was branded and marketed as a &quot;Continental&quot; within the Lincoln-Mercury Division structure - regardless that Lincoln was already selling a model called the &quot;Lincoln Continental&quot; - and the Lincoln name did not appear on the vehicle, VIN plate, factory paperwork, window sticker, nor official Ford Motor Company brochures and advertising. Moreover, the Continental Mark III designation had already been used on the 1958 &quot;Continental Mark III&quot;. 

Nevertheless, the new Lincoln-Mercury Division-produced Continental Mark III was sold alongside the separate but distinct Lincoln-Mercury Division-affiliated and produced Lincoln Continental line of sedans. This created branding confusion during the entire production run of the Continental Mark series until the 1986 model year, when Continental was dropped as the make and the Mark VII was rebranded as a Lincoln with VINs adjusted accordingly. 

The 1969 Mark III was built at the enlarged facility at the Wixom, Michigan assembly plant, home to the rest of the Mk III series and subsequent generations of the model. The listed retail price was US$6,741 ($ in dollars ) and 30,858 were manufactured.

== Production figures == 

== Equipment ==
Standard equipment included power steering, brakes, windows, vacuum-activated concealed headlamps, and split bench electrically adjustable front seats, with 2-way power standard and 6-way power with or without the optional passenger seat recliner as an option. Full instrumentation was standard, with simulated wood appliques in either English Oak or East-Indian Rosewood on the instrument panel and door trim panels on 1969 models. For 1970–71, genuine walnut was used for the interior wood accents. After a few months, a Cartier-branded clock became standard equipment. The upholstery was either the standard vinyl with cloth inserts or the optional leather [and over the years, both low back and high back front seats were available.]

A vinyl roof in cavalry twill pattern was optional on 1969 models, but examples without the vinyl roof were rare. One reason for the rarity of the plain-roofed version is the fact that the roof was made in two pieces and required extra preparation at the factory to conceal the seam; consequently, its availability was not widely advertised. Other options included the aforementioned leather interior, air conditioning, further power adjustments for the front seats, a variety of radios and 8-track tape players, tinted glass, and power locks. A limited-slip differential could be ordered, as could anti-lock brakes, called &quot;Sure Trak&quot;. From 1969 on an ASC sunroof, debuted on the 1968 Mercury Cougar, was optional. Cruise control and an headlamp control that automatically dimmed the headlights for oncoming cars were both optional.

== 1969 ==

Despite some critical reviews by the automotive press, the public took to the car, with some 7,000 built during the remainder of the 1968 model year, and another 23,858 for the 1969 model year, a respectable showing; Lincoln had always trailed Cadillac in production numbers, but the Mark III equalled the Eldorado, which tallied 23,333 for 1969. This was the start of a long, successful run for the Continental Mark Series. The listed retail price was US$6,741 ($ in dollars ).

Because of its early introduction and extended production year, the 1969 model had several running interior changes. All cars produced after December 31, 1968, were equipped with driver and front passenger head-rests as required by Federal mandate.
== 1970 ==
There were only small changes for 1970 and 21,432 were sold. The vinyl roof was made standard, windshield wipers were now concealed, and the wheel covers were redesigned. Michelin radial tires were standard equipment (a first for an American car), and a locking steering column/ignition switch replaced the dash-mounted switch per federal mandate. The metal horn ring used in &#x27;69 was deleted from the steering wheel, and replaced by a Rim Blow unit. Increasingly stringent Federal safety requirements mandated the addition of red reflectors to the rear bumper and yellow reflectors to the sides of the front parking lamp assemblies. Although horsepower remained unchanged at 365, Federal emissions requirements were met by the installation of &quot;Thermactor&quot; air injection pumps on the 460 CID engine. The interior wood appliques were upgraded to genuine Walnut. The door panels were redesigned and the power seat controls were moved from the seat edge to the door armrests. The pattern of the stitching on the seats was modified.

&quot;Motor Trend&quot;’s 1970 head-to-head review of the Eldorado vs. the Mark III gave the nod, barely, to the Mark III, beginning an annual &quot;King of the Hill&quot; series that ran for years.
== 1971 ==
1971 saw the Golden Anniversary for the Lincoln marque and the third and final year of Mark III production. Sales were better than ever at 27,091, almost equal to the Eldorado&#x27;s, a harbinger for the new decade.

Little changed from the 1970 model; tinted glass became standard, as did automatic climate-controlled air conditioning and Sure-Trak anti-lock brakes. High-back seats became standard until around December 1970 and then were switched back to the low-back style used in the early 1970 model year. Horsepower remained unchanged at 365, but the 460 CID V8 engine gained a more sophisticated thermostatic air cleaner assembly with its associated ductwork.

In its second annual King of the Hill contest, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; (July, 1971) again gave the Continental Mark III the nod by a wider margin than 1970 despite it being basically a warmed-over 1968 model while the Cadillac was all-new from the ground up. M/T noted that the Mark III&#x27;s leather interior was far more luxurious and better detailed than the test Eldorado&#x27;s nylon cloth and the Continental&#x27;s real wood dash trim was far more attractive than the Cadillac&#x27;s simulate.

1972 would see a new, even larger car, the Mark IV, replace the Mark III.

== In popular culture ==
Owners

Notable celebrity owners of Mark IIIs included musicians Elvis Presley, James Brown, and Glen Campbell. Golfers Arnold Palmer and Byron Nelson also served as brand ambassadors for the vehicle

In cinema

One of the most notable movie appearances of the Continental Mark III is the 1977 horror film &quot;The Car&quot; which featured a highly customized 1971 Lincoln Continental Mark III designed by famed Hollywood car customizer George Barris. There were four cars built for the film in six weeks. Three were used as stunt mules, the fourth for closeups. The stunt mules were destroyed during production, while the fourth is now in a private collection.

The car&#x27;s bodywork was painted in steel, pearl and charcoal coloring. The windows were laminated in two different shades, smoked on the inside and amber on the outside, so one could see out of it but not into it. In order to give &quot;the car&quot; a &quot;sinister&quot; look as requested by director Elliot Silverstein, Barris made the car&#x27;s roof three inches lower than usual and altered its side fenders that same length again both higher and longer. According to Silverstein, the distinctive sound the horn of The Car makes spells out the letter X in Morse code.

The Continental Mark III was also prominently featured in the 1971 crime action thriller film, &quot;The French Connection&quot;.

<text>Jana Novotná (; 2 October 1968 – 19 November 2017) was a Czech professional tennis player. She was ranked world No. 2 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) in 1997, and as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s doubles for 67 weeks. Novotná won the women&#x27;s singles title at Wimbledon in 1998, and was runner-up in three other singles majors. She also won twelve major women&#x27;s doubles titles (completing a double career Grand Slam), four major mixed doubles titles, and three Olympic medals. Novotná played a serve and volley game, an increasingly rare style of play among women during her career.

==Career==
Novotná turned professional in February 1987. She was known primarily for her success as a doubles player in the early years of her career. Novotná began to have success in singles in the early 1990s, once four-time Grand Slam singles champion Hana Mandlíková became her coach. Mandlíková coached her for nine years. Her earlier coach was Mike Estep.

===1990===
At the 1990 French Open, Novotná, seeded 11th, achieved her best results in Grand Slam singles play up until that point. Having reached the round of 16, she faced Argentinian Gabriela Sabatini (seeded fourth). In their four previous meetings Sabatini got the better of her three times, including two straight-set wins. This time proved to be different, as Novotná turned the tables on her. Although Novotná had disposed of Sabatini, she would have to face yet another difficult opponent in the quarterfinals, Katerina Maleeva (seeded eighth) from Bulgaria. In their two previous meetings Novotná had lost both times, and after Maleeva won the opening set, it appeared Novotná was about to lose to her for a third consecutive time; however, she recovered and eventually won. Despite her success, Novotná&#x27;s toughest test would be against top-seeded Steffi Graf of Germany in the semifinals. When Novotná had faced her three years earlier at the 1987 French Open, Graf won in straight sets. Now, Graf again defeated her without dropping a set. She qualified for the first time for the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships in which she was beaten in the first round by Sabatini. She finished the year ranked No. 13.

===1991===
Novotná enjoyed an excellent start to the 1991 season at the Australian Open, where she was seeded tenth and beat Zina Garrison-Jackson 7–6, 6–4 in the round of 16 to advance to the quarterfinal. The path to the final became considerably more difficult, as Novotná had to contend with top-seeded Steffi Graf in the quarterfinal encounter. In their ten previous meetings, Novotná had lost each time against Graf.

However, this time Novotná achieved the upset of her life by defeating Graf, the reigning champion of the last three years, 5–7, 6–4, 8–6. Now just one win away from her first-ever Grand Slam final, Novotná had to stop Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals to get there; this she did, setting up a showdown against Monica Seles in the final. Seles eventually won in three sets. At the end of the year Novotná was ranked No. 7.

===1993===
Two years later, at Wimbledon, Novotná&#x27;s game hit full stride, as she played some of her finest tennis ever. But for Novotná (seeded eighth) to capture the title, her path would have to go through Sabatini (seeded fourth), Martina Navratilova (seeded second) and top-seeded Steffi Graf. Going into her quarterfinal against Sabatini, Novotná had lost six consecutive matches against the Argentine. This time, she took Sabatini apart in straight sets, prevailing 6–4, 6–3. Novotná then set her sights on a semifinal clash against Martina Navratilova, who had won each of their previous five matches. However, Novotná defeated Navratilova, setting up the Championship match against Graf. After losing a tight first set, Novotná took the second set and then had a game point serving at 4–1 in the third set. With victory seemingly within her grasp, she lost her nerve, double-faulted, and allowed Graf to recover. Graf took the next five games and the title. During the prize presentation ceremony, a distraught Novotná burst into tears and cried on the Duchess of Kent&#x27;s shoulder. The Duchess comforted her. Novotná achieved a year-end ranking of No. 6.

===1994===
She began the 1994 season by reaching the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. In her quarterfinal match, she played Gabriela Sabatini, in what turned out to be their last head-to-head encounter. In their previous meeting, on the grasscourts at the 1993 Wimbledon Championships, Novotná beat Sabatini in a straight-set quarterfinal victory. This time, on the Australian hardcourts, Sabatini defeated Novotná in straight sets. At the French Open, Novotná was beaten in the first round by Anna Smashnova in straight sets. At Wimbledon, Novotná reached the quarterfinals where she again faced Martina Navratilova in a rematch from the previous year. Novotná lost in three sets. At the season&#x27;s final Grand Slam, the US Open, the seventh seeded Novotná worked her way to the semifinals where she played top-seeded Steffi Graf. Dating back to the 1992 French Open, Novotná had lost nine consecutive matches against Graf. This trend would continue as Graf defeated Novotná in straight sets.

===1997===
It took four years for Novotná to reach another Wimbledon final. In 1997, she faced top-seeded Martina Hingis, and lost in three sets. But to get back to the final, Novotná had to get past Mary Joe Fernández in the round of 16. She outlasted Fernandez then defeated Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia in the quarterfinals in straight sets. Now back in the semifinals of Wimbledon, her next opponent would be Arantxa Sánchez Vicario. She had prevailed against Novotná in seven of their nine previous contests, but the majority of those matches were played on clay and hard-courts, at which Sánchez Vicario excelled.

On grass, Novotná had a decided advantage, as she defeated Sánchez Vicario in straight sets. In the final against Hingis, she started out fast, taking the opening set 6–2. But Hingis found her stroke and won the second set 6–3 to even the match at one set apiece. The final set proved to be a mirror image of the second set, as Hingis prevailed 6–3, handing Novotná her second loss in a Wimbledon Championship match.

However, Novotná won the Tour Championships after a victory in the final over Mary Pierce and finished the year ranked a career-high world No. 2 in singles. In addition to winning the Tour Championships, Novotná captured three more WTA singles titles for the year.

===1998: Wimbledon victory===
Her moment of Wimbledon success finally arrived in 1998. After defeating Venus Williams in a close quarterfinal, Novotná avenged the previous year&#x27;s loss by ousting Martina Hingis in the semifinal in straight sets. She won the singles title by defeating veteran Nathalie Tauziat in the final in two sets. She became the oldest first-time Grand Slam singles winner in the Open Era at age 29 years and nine months. This record would be eclipsed by Francesca Schiavone in 2010 when she won the French Open at 29 years and eleven months and again by Flavia Pennetta when she won the US Open in 2015 at 33 years and six months.

Novotná won 12 Grand Slam women&#x27;s doubles titles (four at Wimbledon, three at the French Open, three at the US Open, and two at the Australian Open) and four mixed-doubles titles (two at the Australian Open, one at Wimbledon, and one at the US Open).

Novotná was a member of the Czechoslovakian team that won the Fed Cup in 1988. At the Olympic Games she was a women&#x27;s doubles silver medalist in 1988 and 1996, and a singles bronze medalist in 1996.

She won titles on all four surfaces and crossed the $10 million mark in career prize money in 1998, the fifth player to reach the milestone. She won more than 500 career singles matches, the 15th woman in the Open Era to accomplish the feat.

Novotná was named the 1998 WTA Tour Doubles Team of the Year with Martina Hingis, the 1997 International Tennis Federation Doubles Team of the Year with Lindsay Davenport, the 1996 WTA Tour Doubles Team of the Year with Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, with Gigi Fernández in 1991 and in 1989 and 1990 with Helena Suková.

==Later years and death==
Novotná retired from the professional tour in 1999. During her 14-year career, she won 104 titles (24 in singles, 76 in women&#x27;s doubles and 4 in mixed doubles). She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2005.

From 2000 to 2002, Novotná was a commentator for Wimbledon for the BBC. From 2006 onward, Novotná played the Ladies&#x27; Invitation Doubles tournament at Wimbledon; winning it in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2014. In 2010, her partner was Martina Navratilova. Also in 2010, she helped Navratilova through her treatment for breast cancer. She played invitational doubles in the other Grand Slams as well and also did charity events and exhibitions. She continued to coach players, including Grand Slam champion Barbora Krejčíková.

Novotná lived in Florida until 2010, when she returned to her native Czech Republic. She bought a house and property in the village of Omice, near her hometown of Brno, where she lived with her partner, former Polish tennis player Iwona Kuczyńska. She died of cancer on 19 November 2017 at the age of 49. She chose to keep her diagnosis of cancer private, only telling her closest friends and relatives.

<text>Wodehouse ( &quot;wood-house&quot;) is an English surname and barony.

The baronetcy was created in 1611, the barony in 1797. Since 1866 it has been held by the Earl of Kimberley, the current Baron Wodehouse being John Wodehouse, 5th Earl of Kimberley (born 1951).

==History==
The name &quot;de Wodehouse&quot; is attested as early as in the 11th century, of one Bertram, of Wodehouse-tower, Yorkshire, who lived at the time of the Norman conquest.

An elaborate pedigree of the Wodehouse family of Norfolk is on record beginning with Sir David Wodehouse (b.1053) Father of Sir Constantine de Wodehouse (b.1080) -who was married to Lady Isobel Botetourt (b.1085). John Wodehouse (died 1431) Member of Parliament for Norfolk and Suffolk, is the first of the family to be ~historically attested~ in Norfolk and arrived there as an outside administrator for the Duchy of Lancaster.

The augmented coat of arms of Wodehouse from this time has been blazoned &quot; sable a chevron or, gutte de sang, between three cinquefoils ermine&quot; with the crest &quot;on a wreath, an arm erect, holding a club in the hand&quot; and on a scroll the motto &quot;frappe forte^&quot;, i. e. &quot;strike strong&quot;, and at the bottom &quot;Agincourt&quot;, supported by two wild men. The native English term for &quot;wild man&quot;, &quot;woodwose&quot; (from a putative Old English &quot;*wude-wāsa&quot; &quot;wood-being&quot;), has been transformed to &quot;woodhouse&quot; by popular etymology due to their appearance as supporters in the Woodhouse coat of arms.

<doc id="307054" wikidata="Q1772052" url="?curid=307054" title="United States Merchant Marine">
<text>The United States Merchant Marine is an organization composed of United States civilian mariners and U.S. civilian and federally owned merchant vessels. Both the civilian mariners and the merchant vessels are managed by a combination of the government and private sectors, and engage in commerce or transportation of goods and services in and out of the navigable waters of the United States. The Merchant Marine primarily transports domestic and international cargo and passengers during peacetime, and operate and maintain deep-sea merchant ships, tugboats, towboats, ferries, dredges, excursion vessels, charter boats and other waterborne craft on the oceans, the Great Lakes, rivers, canals, harbors, and other waterways. In times of war, the Merchant Marine can be an auxiliary to the United States Navy, and can be called upon to deliver military personnel and materiel for the military.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, various laws fundamentally changed the course of American merchant shipping. These laws put an end to common practices such as flogging and shanghaiing, and increased shipboard safety and living standards. The United States Merchant Marine is also governed by more than 25 (as of February 17, 2017) international conventions to promote safety and prevent pollution.

In 2022, the United States merchant fleet had 178 privately owned, oceangoing, self-propelled vessels of 1,000 gross register tons and above. Nearly 800 American-owned ships are flagged in other nations.

The federal government maintains fleets of merchant ships managed by the United States Maritime Administration. In 2014, they employed approximately 6.5% of all American water transportation workers. Merchant Marine officers may also be commissioned as military officers by the Department of Defense. This is commonly achieved by commissioning unlimited tonnage Merchant Marine officers as Strategic Sealift Officers in the United States Navy Reserve.

During World War II, nearly 250,000 civilian merchant mariners served as part of the U.S. military, transporting supplies and personnel. Between 1939 and 1945, 9,521 merchant mariners died, a per capita casualty rate greater than those of each U.S. Armed Forces branch. The GI Bill Improvement Act Of 1977 P.L. 95-202, granted veteran status to Women Airforce Service Pilots and &quot;any person in any other similarly situated group&quot; with jurisdiction granted to the Secretary of Defense, and delegated to the Secretary of the Air Force. Merchant mariners who served in World War II were denied such veterans recognition until 1987 when a federal court ordered it. The Court held that the Secretary of the Air Force wrongfully denied active military service recognition to American merchant mariners who participated in World War II.

==Shipboard operations==

Captains, mates (officers), and pilots supervise ship operations on domestic waterways and the high seas. A captain (master) is in overall command of a vessel, and supervises the work of other officers and crew. A captain has the authority to take the conn from a mate or pilot at any time he or she feels the need. On smaller vessels the captain may be a regular watch-stander, similar to a mate, directly controlling the vessel&#x27;s position. Captains and department heads ensure that proper procedures and safety practices are followed, ensure that machinery is in good working order, and oversee the loading and discharging of cargo and passengers. Captains directly communicate with the company or command (MSC), and are overall responsible for cargo, various logs, ship&#x27;s documents, credentials, efforts at controlling pollution and passengers carried.

Mates direct a ship&#x27;s routine operation for the captain during work shifts, which are called watches. Mates stand watch for specified periods, usually in three duty sections, with four hours on watch and eight hours off. When on a navigational watch, mates direct a bridge team by conning, directing courses through the helmsman and speed through the lee helmsman (or directly in open ocean). When more than one mate is necessary aboard a ship, they typically are designated chief mate or first mate, second mate and third mate. In addition to watch standers, mates directly supervise the ship&#x27;s crew, and are assigned other tasks. The chief mate is usually in charge of cargo, stability and the deck crew, the second mate in charge of navigation plans and updates and the third mate as the safety officer. They also monitor and direct deck crew operations, such as directing line handlers during moorings, and anchorings, monitor cargo operations and supervise crew members engaged in maintenance and the vessel&#x27;s upkeep.

Harbor pilots guide ships in and out of confined waterways, such as harbors, where a familiarity with local conditions is of prime importance. Harbor pilots are generally independent contractors who accompany vessels while they enter or leave port, and may pilot many ships in a single day.

Engine officers, or engineers, operate, maintain, and repair engines, boilers, generators, pumps, and other machinery. Merchant marine vessels usually have four engine officers: a chief engineer and a first, second, and third assistant engineer. On many ships, Assistant Engineers stand periodic watches, overseeing the safe operation of engines and other machinery. However, most modern ships sailing today utilize unmanned machinery space (UMS) automation technology, and Assistant Engineers are dayworkers. At night and during meals and breaks, the engine room is unmanned and machinery alarms are answered by the Duty Engineer.
Marine oilers and more experienced qualified members of the engine department, or QMEDs, maintain the vessel in proper running order in the engine spaces below decks, under the direction of the ship&#x27;s engine officers. These workers lubricate gears, shafts, bearings, and other moving parts of engines and motors; read pressure and temperature gauges, record data and sometimes assist with repairs and adjust machinery. Wipers are the entry-level workers in the engine room, holding a position similar to that of ordinary seamen of the deck crew. They clean and paint the engine room and its equipment and assist the others in maintenance and repair work. With more experience, they become oilers and firemen.
Able seamen and ordinary seamen operate the vessel and its deck equipment under officer supervision and keep their assigned areas in good order. They watch for other vessels and obstructions in the ship&#x27;s path, as well as for navigational aids such as buoys and lighthouses. They also steer the ship, measure water depth in shallow water, and maintain and operate deck equipment such as lifeboats, anchors, and cargo-handling gear. On tankers, mariners designated as pumpmen hook up hoses, operate pumps, and clean tanks. When arriving at or leaving a dock, they handle the mooring lines. Seamen also perform routine maintenance chores, such as repairing lines, chipping rust, and painting and cleaning decks. On larger vessels, a boatswain—or head seaman—will supervise the work.

As of 2011, a typical deep-sea merchant ship has a captain, three mates, a chief engineer and three assistant engineers, plus six or more unlicensed seamen, such as able seamen, oilers, QMEDs, and cooks or food handlers known as stewards. Other unlicensed positions on a large ship may include electricians and machinery mechanics.

==History==
 The North American shipping industry developed as colonies grew and trade with Europe increased. As early as the 16th century, Europeans were shipping horses, cattle and hogs to the Americas.

Spanish colonies began to form as early as 1565 in places like St. Augustine, Florida, and later in Santa Fe, New Mexico; San Antonio, Tucson, San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco. English colonies like Jamestown began to form as early as 1607. The connection between the American colonies and Europe, with shipping as its only conduit, would continue to grow unhindered for almost two hundred years.

===Revolutionary War===

The first wartime role of an identifiable United States Merchant Marine took place on June 12, 1775, in and around Machias, Maine (then part of Massachusetts). A group of citizens, hearing the news from Concord and Lexington, captured the British schooner HMS &quot;Margaretta.&quot; The citizens, in need of critical supplies, were given an ultimatum: either load the ships with lumber to build British barracks in Boston, or go hungry. They chose to fight.

Word of this revolt reached Boston, where the Continental Congress and the various colonies issued Letters of Marque to privateers. The privateers interrupted the British supply chain all along the eastern seaboard of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. These actions by the privateers predate both the United States Coast Guard and the United States Navy, which were formed in 1790 and 1797, respectively.

===19th and 20th centuries===
The merchant marine was active in subsequent wars, from the Confederate commerce raiders of the American Civil War, to the assaults on Allied commerce in the First and in the Second World Wars. 3.1 million tons of merchant ships were lost in World War II. Mariners died at a rate of 1 in 26, which was the highest rate of casualties of any service. All told, 733 American cargo ships were lost and 8,651 of the 215,000 who served perished in troubled waters and off enemy shores.

During World War II ships with deck guns had United States Navy Armed Guard to man the guns. Some Armed Guard personnel also served as Radiomen and Signalmen. The Navy gun crews were assisted by ship&#x27;s crew, though the merchant mariner&#x27;s training in gunnery and combat role was ignored for years. Specific instructions as to merchant crew manning of guns and training they should receive was issued by the War Shipping Administration which operated all U.S. merchant ships either directly or through agents during the war. At wars end 144,857 men would serve in the Navy Armed Guard on 6,200 ships.
Merchant shipping also played its role in the wars in Vietnam and Korea. During the Korean War, under the operational control in theater of the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), the number of chartered ships grew from 6 to 255. In September 1950, when the U.S. Marine Corps went ashore at Incheon, 13 Navy cargo ships, 26 chartered American, and 34 Japanese-manned merchant ships of the MSTS participated.

During the Vietnam War, at least 172 National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) ships were activated, and together with other US-flagged merchant vessels crewed by civilian seamen, carried 95% of the supplies used by the American armed forces. Many of these ships sailed into combat zones under fire. The SS &quot;Mayaguez&quot; incident involved the capture of mariners from the American merchant ship SS &quot;Mayaguez&quot;.

During the first Gulf War, the merchant ships of the Military Sealift Command (MSC) delivered more than 12 million metric tons of vehicles, helicopters, ammunition, fuel and other supplies and equipment. At one point during the war, more than 230 government-owned and chartered ships were involved in the sealift.

As of January 2017, U.S. Government-owned merchant vessels from the National Defense Reserve Fleet have supported emergency shipping requirements in 10 wars and crises. During the Korean War, 540 vessels were activated to support military forces. A worldwide tonnage shortfall from 1951 to 1953 required over 600 ship activations to lift coal to Northern Europe and grain to India. The Department of Agriculture required 698 activated ships to store grain from 1955 through 1964. After the Suez Canal Crisis in 1956, the NDRF activated 223 cargo ships and 29 tankers. During the Berlin Wall Crisis of 1961, 18 NDRF vessels were activated, remaining in service until 1970. The Vietnam War required the activation of 172 vessels.

Since 1976, the Ready Reserve Fleet (RRF) has taken the brunt of the work previously handled by the National Defense Reserve Fleet. The RRF made a major contribution to the success of Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm from August 1990 through June 1992, when 79 vessels helped meet military sealift requirements by carrying 25% of the unit equipment and 45% of the ammunition needed.

Two RRF tankers, two Roll-on/Roll-off (RO/RO) ships and a troop transport ship were employed in Somalia for Operation Restore Hope in 1993 and 1994. During the Haitian crisis in 1994, 15 ships were activated for Operation Uphold Democracy operations. In 1995 and 1996, four RO/RO ships were used to deliver military cargo as part of US and UK support to NATO peace-keeping missions.

Four RRF ships were activated to provide humanitarian assistance for Central America following Hurricane Mitch in 1998.

===21st century===
In 2003, 40 RRF ships were used in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. This RRF contribution included sealifting into the combat theater equipment and supplies including combat support equipment for the Army, Navy Combat Logistics Force, and USMC Aviation Support equipment. By the beginning of May 2005, RRF cumulative support included 85 ship activations that logged almost 12,000 ship operating days, moving almost 25% of the equipment needed to support operations in Iraq.

The Military Sealift Command was also involved in the Iraq War, delivering of cargo and of fuel by the end of that year. Merchant mariners were recognized for their contributions in Iraq. For example, in late 2003, VADM David L. Brewer III, Military Sealift Command commander, awarded the crew of the Merchant Marine Expeditionary Medal.

The RRF was called upon to provide humanitarian assistance to gulf coast areas following Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita landfalls in September 2005. The Federal Emergency Management Agency requested a total of eight vessels to support relief efforts. Messing and berthing was provided for refinery workers, oil spill response teams and longshoremen. One vessel provided electrical power.

As of 2007, three RRF ships supported the U.S. Army&#x27;s Afloat Prepositioning Force (APF) with two specialized tankers and one dry cargo vessel capable of underway replenishment for the Navy&#x27;s Combat Logistics Force.

On October 22, 2015, a Military Sealift Command oiler and a United States civilian tanker refueled at sea during an exercise. This is not normally done as commercial fleet vessels are not normally geared for this type of exercise. This was done to increase operational readiness of MSC&#x27;s naval auxiliary assets and prove flexibility of operation.

In Fall 2021, news broke out that several midshipmen reported having been sexually assaulted either at the Academy or during Sea Year. The news resulted in a suspension of Sea Year, multiple investigations and lawsuits, and another promise by the U.S. Government to keep women safer while under their jurisdiction.

== Fleets ==

===Commercial fleet===
As of 31 December 2016, the United States merchant fleet had 175 privately owned, oceangoing, self-propelled vessels of 1,000 gross register tons and above that carry cargo from port to port. One hundred fourteen (114) were dry cargo ships, and 61 were tankers. Ninety seven (97) were Jones Act eligible, and 78 were non-Jones Act eligible. MARAD deemed 152 of the 175 vessels &quot;militarily useful&quot;.

In 2005, there were also 77 passenger ships. Of those American-flagged ships, 51 were foreign owned. Seven hundred ninety-four (794) American-owned ships are flagged in other nations.

2005 statistics from the United States Maritime Administration focused on the larger segment of the fleet: ships of and over. Two hundred forty-five (245) privately owned American-flagged ships are of this size, and 153 of those meet the Jones Act criteria.

The World War II era was the peak for the U.S. fleet. During the post-war year of 1950, for example, U.S. carriers represented about 43 percent of the world&#x27;s shipping trade. By 1995, the American market share had plunged to 4 percent, according to a 1997 report by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The report states, &quot;the number of U.S.-flag vessels has dropped precipitously — from more than 2,000 in the 1940s and 850 in 1970 to about 320 in 1996.&quot;

A diminishing U.S. fleet contrasted with the burgeoning of international sea trade. For example, worldwide demand for natural gas led to the growth of the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker fleet, which reached 370 vessels as of 2007. In 2007 the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) set uniform LNG training standards at U.S. maritime training facilities. While short-term imports are declining, longer term projections signal an eightfold increase in U.S. imported LNG by 2025, the worldwide LNG fleet does not include a single U.S. flagged vessel. Moreover, only five U.S. deepwater LNG ports were operational in 2007, although permits have been issued for four additional ports, according to MARAD.

The U.S. pool of qualified mariners declined with the fleet. In 2004, MARAD described the gap between sealift crewing needs and available unlicensed personnel as &quot;reaching critical proportions, and the long term outlook for sufficient personnel is also of serious concern&quot;.

Future seagoing jobs for U.S. mariners may be on other than U.S.-flagged ships. American-trained mariners are being sought after by international companies to operate foreign-flagged vessels, according to Julie A. Nelson, deputy maritime administrator of the U.S. Maritime Administration. For example, Shell International and Shipping Company Ltd. began recruiting U.S. seafarers to crew its growing fleet of tankers in 2008. In 2007, Overseas Shipholding Group and the Maritime Administration agreed to allow American maritime academy cadets to train aboard OSG&#x27;s international flag vessels. In 2015, the average salary of American mariners was $39,000.

===Federal fleet===

The Military Sealift Command (MSC), an arm of the Navy, serves the entire Department of Defense as the ocean carrier of materiel during peacetime and war. MSC transports equipment, fuel, ammunition, and other goods essential to United States armed forces worldwide. Up to 95% of all supplies needed to sustain the U.S. military can be moved by Military Sealift Command. As of February 2017, MSC operated approximately 120 ships with 100 more in reserve. More than 5,500 civil service or contract merchant mariners staff the ships.

MSC tankers and freighters have a long history of also serving as supply vessels in support of civilian research in the Arctic and Antarctic, including: McMurdo Station, Antarctica; and Greenland in the Arctic.

The National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) acts as a reserve of cargo ships for national emergencies and defense. As of 31 January 2017, the NDRF fleet numbered 99 ships, down from 2,277 ships at its peak in 1950. NDRF vessels are now staged at the James River (off Ft. Eustis, VA); Beaumont, TX; and Suisun Bay (off Benicia, CA) anchorages, and other designated locations.

A Ready Reserve Force component of the NDRF was established in 1976 to provide rapid global deployment of military equipment and forces. As of January 2017, the RRF consists of 46 vessels, down from a peak of 102 vessels in 1994. Two RRF ships are homeported at the NDRF anchorage in Beaumont, TX, while the remainder are assigned to various other homeports.

In 2014, the federal government reported directly employing approximately 5,100 seafarers, out of an industry total of over 78,000 water transportation workers in Occupation Code 53–5000, which represented about 6.5% of all water transportation workers, many of whom worked on Military Sealift Command supply ships. By 2016, MSC reported employing more than 5,500 federal civilian mariners.

== Training ==
Training and licensing are managed by the United States Coast Guard, guided by the United States Code of Federal Regulations Title 46, Chapter I, Subchapter B. Training requirements are also molded by the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (or STCW), which prescribes minimum standards that must be met.

=== Officers / Licensed (Unlimited Tonnage) ===
Unlimited tonnage deck officers (referred to as mates) and engine officers are trained at maritime academies, or by accumulating sea-time as a rating on an unlimited tonnage ship along with passing certain training courses. Officers hold senior leadership positions aboard vessels, and must train over several years to meet the minimum standards. At the culmination of training, potential deck officers must pass an extensive examination administered by the U.S. Coast Guard that spans five days. Upon meeting all requirements and passing the final license examination, new deck officers are credentialed as third mates or third assistant engineers. To advance in grade, such as to 2nd Mate or 2nd Engineer, sea time in the prior grade and additional endorsements and testing are required. The term &quot;unlimited&quot; indicates that there are no limits that the officer has in relation to the size and power of the vessel or geographic location of operation.

====United States Merchant Marine Academy====
The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (also known as USMMA or Kings Point) is one of the five United States service academies (the others are the United States Military Academy, Naval Academy, Coast Guard Academy, and Air Force Academy), and one of eleven United States maritime academies. It is charged with training officers for the United States Merchant Marine, branches of the military, and the transportation industry.

The academy operates on an $85 million annual budget funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation and is administered by the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD).
Joseph Banks Williams entered the academy in 1942 and was the first African-American to graduate in 1944. Admission requirements were further changed in 1974, when the USMMA became the first Federal service academy to enroll female students, two years before the other Federal service academies.

Freshmen, known as &quot;plebes,&quot; upon reporting in June or July of each year as the incoming class, begin a three-week indoctrination period, also known as &quot;Indoc&quot;. Indoc is functionally run by upperclass midshipmen, but is overseen by officers of the United States Maritime Service who are part of the Commandant of Midshipman&#x27;s staff. This high stress period involves physical training, marching, and an intensive introduction to regimental life at the academy. After the indoctrination period is completed, the academic year begins.

U.S. citizen candidates for admission must sign a service obligation contract as a condition of admittance to the USMMA; U.S. candidates who completed Indoc will execute the Oath of Office as a Midshipman in the Navy Reserve the day prior to Acceptance Day. Plebes officially become part of the USMMA Regiment of Midshipmen on Acceptance Day, which is now standardized at 2 weeks after Indoc ends. Until they are &quot;recognized&quot; later in the academic year, plebes must continue adhere to stringent rules affecting most aspects of their daily life. After earning it, the plebes are recognized, henceforth accorded privilege of the title Midshipman, which gives them more privileges, known as &quot;rates&quot;.

Academy students focus on one of two different ship transport areas of education: marine transportation or marine engineering. Transportation students learn about ship navigation, cargo handling, navigation rules, and maritime law. Engineering students learn about the function of the ship&#x27;s engines and its supporting systems. There are currently five different academic majors conferring a Bachelor of Science degree in the major field of study available to midshipmen:
* Two of them are referred to as &quot;Deck Majors&quot;: 
*# Marine Transportation
*# Logistics and Intermodal Transportation
&quot;Deck Majors&quot; sit for and, upon successfully completing the examination, are issued a Third Mate (Deck Officer) License of Steam or Motor Vessels, Unlimited Tonnage, Upon Oceans. 
* The other three available curricula are referred to as &quot;Engine Majors&quot;:
*# Marine Engineering
*# Marine Engineering Systems
*# Marine Engineering and Shipyard Management
&quot;Engine Majors&quot; sit for and, upon successfully completing the examination, are issued Third Assistant Engineer (3 A/E – Engineering Officer) Licenses Steam and Motor Vessels, Any Horsepower. Marine Engineering Systems and Marine Engineering Systems &amp; Shipyard Management graduates are also qualified to sit for the Engineer In Training (EIT) examination administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES).

For part of sophomore and junior year, known at the academy as third class and second class years, midshipmen work as cadets on American-flagged unlimited tonnage merchant ships. Midshipmen are typically paired two to a ship, one engine cadet and one deck cadet. Midshipmen work and function as part of the crew and gain an opportunity for generous amounts of hands-on experience as well as the opportunity to travel abroad to many different foreign ports. The average midshipman travels to 18 countries during this period, which totals a minimum of 300 days. Due to this absence from the academy, the remaining three academic years span from late July, through mid-June.

===== Military status of Midshipmen =====
Immediately upon taking the Oath of Office as U.S. Navy reservists, the first year students become members of the U.S. military, subject to various regulations and military discipline under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and are subject to mobilization policies in the event of war or national emergency.

USMMA graduates must maintain their merchant mariner licensing for 6 years following graduation, and must serve at least 5 years as either a merchant marine officer aboard a U.S.-flagged vessel or with a maritime-related profession, or 5 years of active duty service as a commissioned officer in any of the U.S. Uniformed Services (Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Coast Guard, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), or Public Health Service). All newly commissioned uniformed services officers, active or reserve component, will swear the Oath of Office and serve a minimum military service obligation of 8 years (any portion not served on active duty will be served in the reserve component).

Beginning in 1942, Merchant Marine Academy midshipmen were authorized to wear the Navy Reserve Merchant Marine Insignia and could automatically display this badge on U.S. Navy uniforms upon acceptance of a commission as a reserve naval officer. By the 1990s, especially in light of the somewhat rigorous training requirements for the Surface Warfare Badge, the badge had drawn a negative connotation and was often referred to as the &quot;Sea Chicken&quot;. The Surface Warfare Officers School (SWOS) prohibited display of the badge by its students in 1998 and in 2011 the Navy discontinued the badge altogether. Afterwards, a new badge known as the Strategic Sealift Officer Warfare Insignia was issued for merchant marine naval reserve officers, with this badge having qualification standards more identical with the standard surface warfare training pipeline.

==== State maritime academies ====
Like the Federal USMMA, the following six state maritime academies offer the same training and licensing opportunities for future United States Merchant Marine officers, with varying USCG-approved programs. Each academy operates their own training ship, which are owned by the U.S. Government and loaned to the academy. These ships act as training laboratories during the academic year, and are sailed on by the cadets during training cruises for months at a time. One example of a training ship is USTS &quot;Golden Bear&quot;, at the California Maritime Academy. 
* California Maritime Academy
* Maine Maritime Academy
* Massachusetts Maritime Academy
* State University of New York Maritime College
* Texas A&amp;M Maritime Academy
* The Great Lakes Maritime Academy
Unlike midshipmen from the USMMA, students at any of the state maritime academies are not automatically appointed as members of the Navy Reserve or any branch of the armed forces, nor are they guaranteed commissions as military officers.

Merchant mariner license program cadets at any of the state maritime academies may apply for commission as Strategic Sealift Officers in the Navy Reserve and are eligible to receive a $8,000 annual student incentive payment from MARAD. They must however, apply for and be accepted to a simultaneous-membership military service program consisting of both appointment as a midshipman in the Navy Reserve and reserve enlisted status. After receiving the student incentive payments for 2 years, uniformed service obligations commence upon either graduation or dismissal for any reason from the program. Graduates must comply with their state maritime academy enrollment agreements, and subsequent employment limitations, if any. Women were barred from all U.S. maritime academies until 1974, when the USMMA, State University of New York Maritime College, and the California Maritime Academy first admitted women cadets.

==== Hawsepiper ====
An informal maritime industry term used to refer to a merchant ship&#x27;s officer who began his or her career as an unlicensed merchant mariner and did not attend a traditional maritime college/academy to earn the officer&#x27;s license. This term is similar in use and definition to a U.S. naval services &quot;Mustang&quot; who went from enlisted to officer. A hawsepiper earns their officer&#x27;s license by attaining the required sea time as a rating, taking required training courses, and completing onboard assessments. When all requirements are met, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard&#x27;s National Maritime Center to take the license examination.

=== Ratings / Unlicensed ===
Unlicensed personnel (synonymous with ratings) are generally trained through several private programs funded by maritime unions, shipping companies, or by one&#x27;s own expense. An example training institution would be the Paul Hall Center for Maritime Training and Education, or better known as &quot;Piney Point&quot;. Generally the merchant mariner works their way up through the rates with sea time on the job. Entry level ratings would be ordinary seaman in the deck department and marine wiper in the engine department.

Unlicensed personnel must have sufficient sea time in a qualified rating and complete specified testing and training. These requirements are outlined in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), to advance in rate.

=== Limited-tonnage mariners ===
Limited tonnage licensed mariners hold senior positions aboard small ships, boats, and similar vessels, but are restricted to certain tonnages (under 1600 GRT), types of vessels, and geographic locations.

==Important laws==
Several laws shaped the development of the U.S. Merchant Marine. Chief among them are the &quot;Seamen&#x27;s Act of 1915,&quot; the &quot;Merchant Marine Act of 1920&quot; (commonly referred to as the &quot;Jones Act&quot;), and the &quot;Merchant Marine Act of 1936&quot;.

===The Seamen&#x27;s Act of 1915===
The Seaman&#x27;s Act significantly improved working conditions for American Merchant Marine seamen. The brainchild of International Seamen&#x27;s Union president Andrew Furuseth, the Act was sponsored in the Senate by Robert M. La Follette and received significant support from Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson.

Among other things, the Act:
#abolished the practice of imprisonment for seamen who deserted their ship;
#reduced the penalties for disobedience;
#regulated working hours both at sea and in port;
#established minimum food quality standards;
#regulated the payment of wages;
#required specific levels of safety, particularly the provision of lifeboats;
#required a minimum percentage of the seamen aboard a vessel to be qualified able seamen; and
#required a minimum of 75% of the seamen aboard a vessel to understand the language spoken by the officers.

The Act&#x27;s passage was attributed to labor union lobbying, increased labor tensions immediately before World War I, and elevated public consciousness of safety at sea due to the sinking of the RMS Titanic three years prior.

===The Jones Act===
The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly known as The Jones Act, requires U.S.-flagged vessels to be built in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and documented (&quot;flagged&quot;) under the laws of the United States. Documented means &quot;registered, enrolled, or licensed under the laws of the United States&quot;, according to The Shipping Act. The Jones Act also requires that all officers and 75% of the crew be U.S. citizens. Vessels satisfying these requirements comprised the Jones Act Fleet; only compliant vessels may practice cabotage, transporting passengers or cargo between two U.S. ports. It is more costly to document a vessel in the United States than it is in some countries with lower labor standards and wages.

Critics of the act claim it unfairly restricts the lucrative domestic shipping business. Another important aspect of the Act is that it allowed injured sailors to obtain compensation from their employers for the negligence of the owner, the captain, or fellow members of the crew.

===The Merchant Marine Act===

The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 was enacted &quot;to further the development and maintenance of an adequate and well-balanced American merchant marine, to promote the commerce of the United States, to aid in the national defense, to repeal certain former legislation, and for other purposes&quot;.

Specifically, the Act established the United States Maritime Commission and required a United States Merchant Marine that consisted of U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed, and U.S.-owned vessels capable of carrying all domestic and a substantial portion of foreign water-borne commerce which could serve as a naval auxiliary in time of war or national emergency.

The Act also established federal subsidies for the construction and operation of merchant ships. Two years after the Act was passed, the U.S. Merchant Marine Cadet Corps, the forerunner to the United States Merchant Marine Academy, was established.

===International regulations===
Federal law requires the Merchant Marine to adhere to a number of international conventions. The International Maritime Organization was either the source or a conduit for a number of these regulations.

As of 2007, the principal International Conventions were:
* SOLAS 74: International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea;
* MARPOL 73/78: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978;
* ICLL 66: International Convention on Load Lines, as revised in 1966;
* 72 COLREGS: International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea;
* STCW 95: International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW); and
* SAR 79: International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue.

<doc id="307060" wikidata="Q1517496" url="?curid=307060" title="Iowa people">
<text>The Iowa, also known as Ioway, and the Bah-Kho-Je or Báxoje (English: grey snow; Chiwere: Báxoje ich&#x27;é), are a Native American Siouan people. Today, they are enrolled in either of two federally recognized tribes, the [[Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma]] and the [[Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska]].

The Iowa, Missouria, and Otoe tribes were all once part of the Ho-Chunk people, and they are all Chiwere language-speaking peoples. They left their ancestral homelands in Southern Wisconsin for Eastern Iowa, a state that bears their name. In 1837, the Iowa were moved from Iowa to reservations in Brown County, Kansas, and Richardson County, Nebraska. Bands of Iowa moved to Indian Territory in the late 19th century and settled south of Perkins, Oklahoma, to become the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma.

==Etymology==
The Ioway tribe is also known as the Báxoje tribe. Their name has been said to come from the Sioux &quot;ayuhwa&quot; (&quot;sleepy ones.&quot;). Early European explorers often adopted the names of tribes from the ethnonyms which other tribes gave them, not understanding that these differed from what the peoples called themselves. Thus, &quot;ayuhwa&quot; is not an Ioway word. The word Ioway comes from Dakotan &quot;ayuxbe&quot; via French &quot;aiouez&quot;. Their autonym (their name for themselves) is Bah-Kho-Je, pronounced (alternate spellings: &quot;pahotcha&quot;, &quot;pahucha&quot;, &quot;báxoje&quot;), which translates to &quot;grey snow&quot;. &quot;Báxoje&quot; has been incorrectly translated as &quot;dusted faces&quot; or &quot;dusty nose&quot;.

The state of Iowa, where they once lived, was named after this tribe. Their name has been applied to other locations, such as Iowa County, Iowa City and the Iowa River.

== Population ==

Their estimated 1760 population of 1,100 dropped to 800 and by 1804, a decrease caused mainly by smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity. Their numbers were reduced to 500 by 1900. In 1960, 100 Iowa lived in Kansas and 100 in Oklahoma.

By 1980 their population had recovered to 1,000 (of which only 20 spoke Iowa). In 1990 there were 1,700 people. According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in 1995 there were 533 individuals living in the Iowa reservations of Kansas and 44 in Nebraska (Horton Agency), while 857 people lived in the Oklahoma Iowa Tribe (Shawnee Agency), amounting to a total of 2,934 people. According to the 2000 census, 1,451 people identified as full-blood Iowa, 76 were of mixed-Indian descent, 688 of mixed-race descent, and 43 of mixed-race and tribe descent, amounting to 2,258 people.

== Culture ==

The Iowa have had customs similar to those of the other Siouan-speaking tribes of the Great Plains, such as the Omaha, Ponca and Osage. They were a semi-nomadic people who had adopted horses for hunting, but they also had an agricultural lifestyle similar to the tribes inhabiting the Eastern woodlands. They planted maize and manufactured alum pipes, which they traded along with furs with the French colonizers.

Historically, their houses included bark lodges (&quot;chakiruthan&quot;), tipis, and at times, earth lodges—oven-shaped buildings covered with earth for protection from extremes of temperature and oriented to a cardinal direction. A smoke hole enabled ventilation from a central hearth. During the hunting season or in warfare, they used the portable tipi. Like the Osage or Kansa, Iowa men traditionally shaved their heads and decorated them with deer hide. Like Great Plains tribes, they valued three feats during a battle.

== History ==

In prehistoric times, the Iowa emigrated from the Great Lakes region to present-day Iowa. In the 16th century, they moved from the Mississippi River to the Great Plains, and possibly then separated from the Ho-Chunk tribe.

From the 15th to 18th centuries, they lived in the Red Pipestone Quarry region (Minnesota). In the early 19th century, the Iowa had reached the banks of the Platte River, where in 1804 Lewis and Clark visited their settlements. There they engaged in trading with the French and local tribes, thanks to their advantageous situation regarding the alum deposits.

Between 1820 and 1840, the Iowa ceded their Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri lands to the U.S. government. By 1837 most were relocated to a reservation along the Kansas-Nebraska border, led by their chief Chief Mahaska (&quot;Mew-hew-she-kaw&quot;, &quot;White Cloud&quot;; archaic Ioway &quot;Maxúshga&quot; pronounced ; contemporary &quot;Maxúhga&quot;). They surrendered the Little Platte territory in Missouri in 1836. Other Missouri lands had been ceded in 1824.

In 1837 they settled in a strip of land in Kansas, south of the Big Nemaha River, along with the Sauk and the Meskwaki, tribes with which they had long had friendly relations (though speaking unrelated Algonquian languages). Some 45 Iowa fought in the American Civil War in the Union Army, among them Chief James White Cloud, grandson of &quot;Mahaska&quot;.

In 1883 a number of Iowa moved to Indian Territory preferring to live in the older community village way of life. The new reservation was located in Lincoln, Payne and Logan counties in the Indian Territory. However, despite their efforts to block allotment, their lands were divided anyway. Today the Iowa Reservation in Nebraska and Kansas is approximately in size, and has more than 150 residents.

=== 21st-century ===
In 2007, a documentary film &quot;Lost Nation: The Ioway&quot; (2007; written and directed by Kelly Rundle and Tammy Rundle) was made, and followed by sequels 2 and 3.

The Ioway Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska operates the Casino White Cloud at White Cloud, Kansas, on the Ioway Reservation.

Jacob Keyes is the current tribal chairperson of the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma. The tribes operates the Cimarron Casino in Perkins, Oklahoma, and the Ioway Casino in Chandler, Oklahoma.

<doc id="307062" wikidata="Q5439996" url="?curid=307062" title="Federal Advisory Committee Act">
<text>The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (), is a United States federal law which governs the behavior of federal advisory committees. In particular, it has special emphasis on open meetings, chartering, public involvement, and reporting. It was codified in December 2022.

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) oversees the process.

==Overview==

===Advisory committees===
The Federal Advisory Committee Act defines &quot;advisory committee&quot; as &quot;any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group&quot; that dispenses &quot;advice or recommendations&quot; to the President of the United States, and excludes bodies that also exercise operational functions. They are provisional bodies and have the advantage of being able to circumvent bureaucracy and collect a range of opinions.

Committees composed of full-time officers or employees of the federal government do not count as &quot;advisory committees&quot; under FACA. Furthermore, the following organizations are also not governed by FACA: the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, the Commission on Government Procurement, the National Academy of Sciences, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Reserve, and the National Academy of Public Administration.

===Purpose===
In drafting FACA, legislators wanted to ensure that advice by the various advisory committees is &quot;objective and accessible to the public&quot; by formalizing the process for &quot;establishing, operating, overseeing, and terminating&quot; the committees. 
The Committee Management Secretariat at the GSA is charged with monitoring compliance.

In particular the Act restricts the formation of such committees to only those which are deemed essential, limits their powers to provision of advice to officers and agencies in the executive branch of the Federal Government, and limits the length of term during which any such committee may operate. Further, FACA was an attempt by Congress to curtail the rampant &quot;locker-room discussion&quot; that had become prevalent in administrative decisions. These &quot;locker-room discussion&quot; are masked under titles like &quot;task force&quot;, &quot;subcommittee&quot;, and &quot;working group&quot; meetings, which are less than full FACA meetings and so they do not have to be open to the public. FACA declared that all administrative procedures and hearings were to be public knowledge.

==Legal requirements==

===Public notice===
A committee must provide public notice in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; 15 days prior to the meeting. It must publish all information regarding the meeting, including committee name, the time, place, and purpose of the meeting, and a summary of the agenda. Additionally, if any part of the meeting is closed to the public, the notice must include the committee name; the time, place and purpose of the meeting; a summary of the agenda; and if any portion of the meeting is closed, the reason and exemption(s) in the Government in the Sunshine Act that apply. An advisory committee meeting can be closed to the public if the president or an agency head determines that any of the 10 exemptions to the Sunshine Act apply (see below).
The committee must provide access to materials provided to it, including reports, transcripts, minutes, working papers, agendas or other documents unless any of the nine FOIA exemptions would apply. The committees must also keep minutes of their meetings.

==Amendments==
In March, 2012 the Government Accountability Office issued a report on FACA groups in DOT and DOE. In this report, they state:

&quot;Advisory groups—those established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and other groups not subject to the act—can play an important role in the development of policy and government regulations. There are more than 1,000 FACA advisory groups and an unknown number of non-FACA advisory groups governmentwide. Non-FACA groups include intergovernmental groups. Section 21 of Pub. L. No. 111-139 requires GAO to conduct routine investigations to identify programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives with duplicative goals and activities. In that context, GAO reviewed (1) the extent to which the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) and Department of Energy’s (DOE) assessment process helps ensure advisory group efforts are not duplicative and what challenges, if any, exist in assessing potential duplication, and (2) to what extent DOT and DOE advisory groups are useful in assisting their respective agencies in carrying out their missions and how the groups’ usefulness could be enhanced.&quot; This review resulted in four recommendations geared toward preventing duplication of efforts among FACA groups.

==Criticism==
FACA has drawn criticism as an unconstitutional infringement upon &quot;long-recognized presidential powers&quot; reserved to the President under Article II of the U.S. Constitution. Critics maintain that FACA &quot;violates separation of powers by limiting the terms on which the President can acquire information from nongovernmental advisory committees&quot;.

<text>August Beer (; 31 July 1825 – 18 November 1863) was a German physicist, chemist, and mathematician of Jewish descent.

==Biography==
Beer was born in Trier, where he studied mathematics and natural sciences. Beer was educated at the technical school and gymnasium of his native town until 1845, when he went to Bonn to study mathematics and the sciences under the mathematician and physicist Julius Plücker, whose assistant he became later. In 1848 he won the prize for his essay, &quot;De Situ Axium Opticorum in Crystallis Biaxibus,&quot; and obtained the degree of Ph.D. Two years later he was appointed lecturer at the University of Bonn.

In 1852, Beer published a paper on the absorption of red light in coloured aqueous solutions of various salts. Beer makes use of the fact, derived from Bouguer&#x27;s and Lambert&#x27;s absorption laws, that the intensity of light transmitted through a solution at a given wavelength decreases exponentially with the path length d and the concentration c of the solute (the solvent is considered non-absorbing). The “Absorption Coëfficient” that Beer defined is actually the transmittance (or transmission ratio), T = I / I0. In Beer&#x27;s formulation: &quot;the transmittance of a concentrated solution can be derived from a measurement of the transmittance of a dilute solution.&quot;

The transmittance measured for any concentration and path length can be normalized to the corresponding transmittance for a standard concentration and path length. Beer conducted a number of experiments to confirm this empirical law, and to define a standard concentration of 10%, and a standard path length of 10 cm. The photometer, devised by Beer, is shown in the gallery below.

Beer continued to publish the results of his scientific labors, writing in 1854 &quot;Einleitung in die höhere Optik&quot; (Introduction to the Higher Optics). His findings, together with those of Johann Heinrich Lambert, make up the Beer–Lambert law. In 1855 he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Bonn. Beer also wrote &quot;Einheit in der Electrostatik,&quot; published two years after his death. He died in Bonn in 1863.

== Beer&#x27;s law==
Beer&#x27;s law, also called the Beer-Lambert law, in spectroscopy, is the physical law stating that the quantity of light absorbed by a substance dissolved in a nonabsorbing solvent is directly proportional to the concentration of the substance and the path length of the light through the solution. Beer&#x27;s law is commonly written in the form A = εcl, where A is the absorbance, c is the concentration in moles per liter, l is the path length in centimeters, and ε is a constant of proportionality known as the molar extinction coefficient. The law is accurate only for dilute solutions; deviations from the law occur in concentrated solutions because of interactions between molecules of the solute, the substance dissolved in the solvent.

<doc id="307065" wikidata="Q1540285" url="?curid=307065" title="Tissue engineering">
<text>Tissue engineering is a biomedical engineering discipline that uses a combination of cells, engineering, materials methods, and suitable biochemical and physicochemical factors to restore, maintain, improve, or replace different types of biological tissues. Tissue engineering often involves the use of cells placed on tissue scaffolds in the formation of new viable tissue for a medical purpose, but is not limited to applications involving cells and tissue scaffolds. While it was once categorized as a sub-field of biomaterials, having grown in scope and importance, it can be considered as a field of its own.

While most definitions of tissue engineering cover a broad range of applications, in practice, the term is closely associated with applications that repair or replace portions of or whole tissues (i.e. organs, bone, cartilage, blood vessels, bladder, skin, muscle etc.). Often, the tissues involved require certain mechanical and structural properties for proper functioning. The term has also been applied to efforts to perform specific biochemical functions using cells within an artificially-created support system (e.g. an artificial pancreas, or a bio artificial liver). The term &quot;regenerative medicine&quot; is often used synonymously with tissue engineering, although those involved in regenerative medicine place more emphasis on the use of stem cells or progenitor cells to produce tissues.

== Overview ==
A commonly applied definition of tissue engineering, as stated by Langer and Vacanti, is &quot;an interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and life sciences toward the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve [Biological tissue] function or a whole organ&quot;. In addition, Langer and Vacanti also state that there are three main types of tissue engineering: cells, tissue-inducing substances, and a cells + matrix approach (often referred to as a scaffold). Tissue engineering has also been defined as &quot;understanding the principles of tissue growth, and applying this to produce functional replacement tissue for clinical use&quot;. A further description goes on to say that an &quot;underlying supposition of tissue engineering is that the employment of natural biology of the system will allow for greater success in developing therapeutic strategies aimed at the replacement, repair, maintenance, or enhancement of tissue function&quot;.

Developments in the multidisciplinary field of tissue engineering have yielded a novel set of tissue replacement parts and implementation strategies. Scientific advances in biomaterials, stem cells, growth and differentiation factors, and biomimetic environments have created unique opportunities to fabricate or improve existing tissues in the laboratory from combinations of engineered extracellular matrices (&quot;scaffolds&quot;), cells, and biologically active molecules. Among the major challenges now facing tissue engineering is the need for more complex functionality, biomechanical stability, and vascularization in laboratory-grown tissues destined for transplantation.

== Etymology ==
The historical origin of the term is unclear as the definition of the word has changed throughout the past few decades. The term first appeared in a 1984 publication that described the organization of an endothelium-like membrane on the surface of a long-implanted, synthetic ophthalmic prosthesis.

The first modern use of the term as recognized today was in 1985 by the researcher, physiologist and bioengineer Yuan-Cheng Fung of the Engineering Research Center. He proposed the joining of the terms tissue (in reference to the fundamental relationship between cells and organs) and engineering (in reference to the field of modification of said tissues). The term was officially adopted in 1987.

== History ==
=== Ancient era (pre-17th century) ===
A rudimentary understanding of the inner workings of human tissues may date back further than most would expect. As early as the Neolithic period, sutures were being used to close wounds and aid in healing. Later on, societies such as ancient Egypt developed better materials for sewing up wounds such as linen sutures. Around 2500 BC in ancient India, skin grafts were developed by cutting skin from the buttock and suturing it to wound sites in the ear, nose, or lips. Ancient Egyptians often would graft skin from corpses onto living humans and even attempted to use honey as a type of antibiotic and grease as a protective barrier to prevent infection. In the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, Gallo-Romans developed wrought iron implants and dental implants could be found in ancient Mayans.

=== Enlightenment (17th century–19th century) ===
While these ancient societies had developed techniques that were way ahead of their time, they still lacked a mechanistic understanding of how the body was reacting to these procedures. This mechanistic approach came along in tandem with the development of the empirical method of science pioneered by René Descartes. Sir Isaac Newton began to describe the body as a &quot;physiochemical machine&quot; and postured that disease was a breakdown in the machine.

In the 17th century, Robert Hooke discovered the cell and a letter from Benedict de Spinoza brought forward the idea of the homeostasis between the dynamic processes in the body. Hydra experiments performed by Abraham Trembley in the 18th century began to delve into the regenerative capabilities of cells. During the 19th century, a better understanding of how different metals reacted with the body led to the development of better sutures and a shift towards screw and plate implants in bone fixation. Further, it was first hypothesized in the mid-1800s that cell-environment interactions and cell proliferation were vital for tissue regeneration.

=== Modern era (20th and 21st centuries) ===
As time progresses and technology advances, there is a constant need for change in the approach researchers take in their studies. Tissue engineering has continued to evolve over centuries. In the beginning people used to look at and use samples directly from human or animal cadavers. Now, tissue engineers have the ability to remake many of the tissues in the body through the use of modern techniques such as microfabrication and three-dimensional bioprinting in conjunction with native tissue cells/stem cells. These advances have allowed researchers to generate new tissues in a much more efficient manner. For example, these techniques allow for more personalization which allow for better biocompatibility, decreased immune response, cellular integration, and longevity. There is no doubt that these techniques will continue to evolve, as we have continued to see microfabrication and bioprinting evolve over the past decade.

In 1960, Wichterle and Lim were the first to publish experiments on hydrogels for biomedical applications by using them in contact lens construction. Work on the field developed slowly over the next two decades, but later found traction when hydrogels were repurposed for drug delivery. In 1984, Charles Hull developed bioprinting by converting a Hewlett-Packard inkjet printer into a device capable of depositing cells in 2-D. Three dimensional (3-D) printing is a type of additive manufacturing which has since found various applications in medical engineering, due to its high precision and efficiency. With biologist James Thompson&#x27;s development of first human stem cell lines in 1998 followed by transplantation of first laboratory-grown internal organs in 1999 and creation of the first bioprinter in 2003 by the University of Missouri when they printed spheroids without the need of scaffolds, 3-D bioprinting became more conventionally used in medical field than ever before. So far, scientists have been able to print mini organoids and organs-on-chips that have rendered practical insights into the functions of a human body. Pharmaceutical companies are using these models to test drugs before moving on to animal studies. However, a fully functional and structurally similar organ has not been printed yet. A team at University of Utah has reportedly printed ears and successfully transplanted those onto children born with defects that left their ears partially developed.

Today hydrogels are considered the preferred choice of bio-inks for 3-D bioprinting since they mimic cells&#x27; natural ECM while also containing strong mechanical properties capable of sustaining 3-D structures. Furthermore, hydrogels in conjunction with 3-D bioprinting allow researchers to produce different scaffolds which can be used to form new tissues or organs. 3-D printed tissues still face many challenges such as adding vasculature. Meanwhile, 3-D printing parts of tissues definitely will improve our understanding of the human body, thus accelerating both basic and clinical research.

== Examples ==

As defined by Langer and Vacanti, examples of tissue engineering fall into one or more of three categories: &quot;just cells,&quot; &quot;cells and scaffold,&quot; or &quot;tissue-inducing factors.&quot;
* In vitro meat: Edible artificial animal muscle tissue cultured &quot;in vitro&quot;.
* Bioartificial liver device, &quot;Temporary Liver&quot;, Extracorporeal Liver Assist Device (ELAD): The human hepatocyte cell line (C3A line) in a hollow fiber bioreactor can mimic the hepatic function of the liver for acute instances of liver failure. A fully capable ELAD would temporarily function as an individual&#x27;s liver, thus avoiding transplantation and allowing regeneration of their own liver.
* Artificial pancreas: Research involves using islet cells to regulate the body&#x27;s blood sugar, particularly in cases of diabetes . Biochemical factors may be used to cause human pluripotent stem cells to differentiate (turn into) cells that function similarly to beta cells, which are in an islet cell in charge of producing insulin.
* Artificial bladders: Anthony Atala (Wake Forest University) has successfully implanted artificial bladders, constructed of cultured cells seeded onto a bladder-shaped scaffold, into seven out of approximately 20 human test subjects as part of a long-term experiment.
* Cartilage: lab-grown cartilage, cultured &quot;in vitro&quot; on a scaffold, was successfully used as an autologous transplant to repair patients&#x27; knees.
* Scaffold-free cartilage: Cartilage generated without the use of exogenous scaffold material. In this methodology, all material in the construct is cellular produced directly by the cells.
* Bioartificial heart: Doris Taylor&#x27;s lab constructed a biocompatible rat heart by re-cellularising a de-cellularised rat heart. This scaffold and cells were placed in a bioreactor, where it matured to become a partially or fully transplantable organ. the work was called a &quot;landmark&quot;. The lab first stripped the cells away from a rat heart (a process called &quot;decellularization&quot;) and then injected rat stem cells into the decellularized rat heart.
* Tissue-engineered blood vessels: Blood vessels that have been grown in a lab and can be used to repair damaged blood vessels without eliciting an immune response. Tissue engineered blood vessels have been developed by many different approaches.  They could be implanted as pre-seeded cellularized blood vessels, as acellular vascular grafts made with decellularized vessels or synthetic vascular grafts.
* Artificial skin constructed from human skin cells embedded in a hydrogel, such as in the case of bio-printed constructs for battlefield burn repairs.
* Artificial bone marrow: Bone marrow cultured &quot;in vitro&quot; to be transplanted serves as a &quot;just cells&quot; approach to tissue engineering.
* Tissue engineered bone: A structural matrix can be composed of metals such as titanium, polymers of varying degradation rates, or certain types of ceramics. Materials are often chosen to recruit osteoblasts to aid in reforming the bone and returning biological function. Various types of cells can be added directly into the matrix to expedite the process.
* Laboratory-grown penis: Decellularized scaffolds of rabbit penises were recellularised with smooth muscle and endothelial cells. The organ was then transplanted to live rabbits and functioned comparably to the native organ, suggesting potential as treatment for genital trauma.
* Oral mucosa tissue engineering uses a cells and scaffold approach to replicate the 3 dimensional structure and function of oral mucosa.

== Cells as building blocks ==

Cells are one of the main components for the success of tissue engineering approaches. Tissue engineering uses cells as strategies for creation/replacement of new tissue. Examples include fibroblasts used for skin repair or renewal, chondrocytes used for cartilage repair (MACI–FDA approved product), and hepatocytes used in liver support systems

Cells can be used alone or with support matrices for tissue engineering applications. An adequate environment for promoting cell growth, differentiation, and integration with the existing tissue is a critical factor for cell-based building blocks. Manipulation of any of these cell processes create alternative avenues for the development of new tissue (e.g., cell reprogramming - somatic cells, vascularization).

=== Isolation ===

Techniques for cell isolation depend on the cell source. Centrifugation and apheresis are techniques used for extracting cells from biofluids (e.g., blood). Whereas digestion processes, typically using enzymes to remove the extracellular matrix (ECM), are required prior to centrifugation or apheresis techniques to extract cells from tissues/organs. Trypsin and collagenase are the most common enzymes used for tissue digestion. While trypsin is temperature dependent, collagenase is less sensitive to changes in temperature.

=== Cell sources ===
&quot;Primary cells&quot; are those directly isolated from host tissue. These cells provide an ex-vivo model of cell behavior without any genetic, epigenetic, or developmental changes; making them a closer replication of in-vivo conditions than cells derived from other methods. This constraint however, can also make studying them difficult. These are mature cells, often terminally differentiated, meaning that for many cell types proliferation is difficult or impossible. Additionally, the microenvironments these cells exist in are highly specialized, often making replication of these conditions difficult.

&quot;Secondary cells&quot; A portion of cells from a primary culture is moved to a new repository/vessel to continue being cultured. Medium from the primary culture is removed, the cells that are desired to be transferred are obtained, and then cultured in a new vessel with fresh growth medium. A secondary cell culture is useful in order to ensure that cells have both the room and nutrients that they require to grow. Secondary cultures are most notably used in any scenario in which a larger quantity of cells than can be found in the primary culture is desired. Secondary cells share the constraints of primary cells (see above) but have an added risk of contamination when transferring to a new vessel.

=== Genetic classifications of cells ===

Autologous: The donor and the recipient of the cells are the same individual. Cells are harvested, cultured or stored, and then reintroduced to the host. As a result of the host&#x27;s own cells being reintroduced, an antigenic response is not elicited. The body&#x27;s immune system recognizes these re-implanted cells as its own, and does not target them for attack. Autologous cell dependence on host cell health and donor site morbidity may be deterrents to their use. Adipose-derived and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are commonly autologous in nature, and can be used in a myriad of ways, from helping repair skeletal tissue to replenishing beta cells in diabetic patients.

Allogenic: Cells are obtained from the body of a donor of the same species as the recipient. While there are some ethical constraints to the use of human cells for in vitro studies (i.e. human brain tissue chimera development), the employment of dermal fibroblasts from human foreskin demonstrates an immunologically safe and thus a viable choice for allogenic tissue engineering of the skin.

Xenogenic: These cells are derived isolated cells from alternate species from the recipient. A notable example of xenogeneic tissue utilization is cardiovascular implant construction via animal cells. Chimeric human-animal farming raises ethical concerns around the potential for improved consciousness from implanting human organs in animals.

Syngeneic or isogenic: These cells describe those borne from identical genetic code. This imparts an immunologic benefit similar to autologous cell lines (see above). Autologous cells can be considered syngenic, but the classification also extends to non-autologously derived cells such as those from an identical twin, from genetically identical (cloned) research models, or induced stem cells (iSC) as related to the donor.

=== Stem cells ===

&quot;Stem cells&quot; are undifferentiated cells with the ability to divide in culture and give rise to different forms of specialized cells. Stem cells are divided into &quot;adult&quot; and &quot;embryonic&quot; stem cells according to their source. While there is still a large ethical debate related to the use of embryonic stem cells, it is thought that another alternative source – induced pluripotent stem cellsmay be useful for the repair of diseased or damaged tissues, or may be used to grow new organs.

&quot;Totipotent&quot; cells are stem cells which can divide into further stem cells or differentiate into any cell type in the body, including extra-embryonic tissue.

&quot;Pluripotent&quot; cells are stem cells which can differentiate into any cell type in the body except extra-embryonic tissue. induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are subclass of pluripotent stem cells resembling embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that have been derived from adult differentiated cells. iPSCs are created by altering the expression of transcriptional factors in adult cells until they become like embryonic stem cells.

&quot;Multipotent&quot; stem cells can be differentiated into any cell within the same class, such as blood or bone. A common example of multipotent cells is Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).

== Scaffolds ==

Scaffolds are materials that have been engineered to cause desirable cellular interactions to contribute to the formation of new functional tissues for medical purposes. Cells are often &#x27;seeded&#x27; into these structures capable of supporting three-dimensional tissue formation. Scaffolds mimic the extracellular matrix of the native tissue, recapitulating the &quot;in vivo&quot; milieu and allowing cells to influence their own microenvironments. They usually serve at least one of the following purposes: allowing cell attachment and migration, delivering and retaining cells and biochemical factors, enabling diffusion of vital cell nutrients and expressed products, and exerting certain mechanical and biological influences to modify the behaviour of the cell phase.

In 2009, an interdisciplinary team led by the thoracic surgeon Thorsten Walles implanted the first bioartificial transplant that provides an innate vascular network for post-transplant graft supply successfully into a patient awaiting tracheal reconstruction.

To achieve the goal of tissue reconstruction, scaffolds must meet some specific requirements. High porosity and adequate pore size are necessary to facilitate cell seeding and diffusion throughout the whole structure of both cells and nutrients. Biodegradability is often an essential factor since scaffolds should preferably be absorbed by the surrounding tissues without the necessity of surgical removal. The rate at which degradation occurs has to coincide as much as possible with the rate of tissue formation: this means that while cells are fabricating their own natural matrix structure around themselves, the scaffold is able to provide structural integrity within the body and eventually it will break down leaving the newly formed tissue which will take over the mechanical load. Injectability is also important for clinical uses.
Recent research on organ printing is showing how crucial a good control of the 3D environment is to ensure reproducibility of experiments and offer better results.

=== Materials ===
Material selection is an essential aspect of producing a scaffold.  The materials utilized can be natural or synthetic and can be biodegradable or non-biodegradable. Additionally, they must be biocompatible, meaning that they do not cause any adverse effects to cells. Silicone, for example, is a synthetic, non-biodegradable material commonly used as a drug delivery material, while gelatin is a biodegradable, natural material commonly used in cell-culture scaffolds

The material needed for each application is different, and dependent on the desired mechanical properties of the material. Tissue engineering of long bone defects for example, will require a rigid scaffold with a compressive strength similar to that of cortical bone (100-150 MPa), which is much higher compared to a scaffold for skin regeneration.

There are a few versatile synthetic materials used for many different scaffold applications. One of these commonly used materials is polylactic acid (PLA), a synthetic polymer. PLA – polylactic acid. This is a polyester which degrades within the human body to form lactic acid, a naturally occurring chemical which is easily removed from the body. Similar materials are polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL): their degradation mechanism is similar to that of PLA,  but PCL degrades slower and PGA degrades faster. PLA is commonly combined with PGA to create poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). This is especially useful because the degradation of PLGA can be tailored by altering the weight percentages of PLA and PGA: More PLA – slower degradation, more PGA – faster degradation. This tunability, along with its biocompatibility, makes it an extremely useful material for scaffold creation.

Scaffolds may also be constructed from natural materials: in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth. Protein based materials – such as collagen, or fibrin, and polysaccharidic materials- like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility. Among GAGs, hyaluronic acid, possibly in combination with cross linking agents (e.g. glutaraldehyde, water-soluble carbodiimide, etc.), is one of the possible choices as scaffold material. 
Due to the covalent attachment of thiol groups to these polymers, they can crosslink via disulfide bond formation. The use of thiolated polymers (thiomers) as scaffold material for tissue engineering was initially introduced at the 4th Central European Symposium on Pharmaceutical Technology in Vienna 2001. As thiomers are biocompatible, exhibit cellular mimicking properties and efficiently support proliferation and differentiation of various cell types, they are extensively used as scaffolds for tissue engineering. Furthermore thiomers such as thiolated hyaluronic acid and thiolated chitosan were shown to exhibit wound healing properties and are subject of numerous clinical trials. Additionally, a fragment of an extracellular matrix protein, such as the RGD peptide, can be coupled to a non-bioactive material to promote cell attachment. Another form of scaffold is decellularized tissue. This is a process where chemicals are used to extracts cells from tissues, leaving just the extracellular matrix. This has the benefit of a fully formed matrix specific to the desired tissue type. However, the decellurised scaffold may present immune problems with future introduced cells.

=== Synthesis ===

A number of different methods have been described in the literature for preparing porous structures to be employed as tissue engineering scaffolds. Each of these techniques presents its own advantages, but none are free of drawbacks.

====Nanofiber self-assembly====
Molecular self-assembly is one of the few methods for creating biomaterials with properties similar in scale and chemistry to that of the natural &quot;in vivo&quot; extracellular matrix (ECM), a crucial step toward tissue engineering of complex tissues. Moreover, these hydrogel scaffolds have shown superiority in in vivo toxicology and biocompatibility compared to traditional macro-scaffolds and animal-derived materials.

====Textile technologies====
These techniques include all the approaches that have been successfully employed for the preparation of non-woven meshes of different polymers. In particular, non-woven polyglycolide structures have been tested for tissue engineering applications: such fibrous structures have been found useful to grow different types of cells. The principal drawbacks are related to the difficulties in obtaining high porosity and regular pore size.

====Solvent casting and particulate leaching====
Solvent casting and particulate leaching (SCPL) allows for the preparation of structures with regular porosity, but with limited thickness. First, the polymer is dissolved into a suitable organic solvent (e.g. polylactic acid could be dissolved into dichloromethane), then the solution is cast into a mold filled with porogen particles. Such porogen can be an inorganic salt like sodium chloride, crystals of saccharose, gelatin spheres or paraffin spheres. The size of the porogen particles will affect the size of the scaffold pores, while the polymer to porogen ratio is directly correlated to the amount of porosity of the final structure. After the polymer solution has been cast the solvent is allowed to fully evaporate, then the composite structure in the mold is immersed in a bath of a liquid suitable for dissolving the porogen: water in the case of sodium chloride, saccharose and gelatin or an aliphatic solvent like hexane for use with paraffin. Once the porogen has been fully dissolved, a porous structure is obtained. Other than the small thickness range that can be obtained, another drawback of SCPL lies in its use of organic solvents which must be fully removed to avoid any possible damage to the cells seeded on the scaffold.

====Gas foaming====
To overcome the need to use organic solvents and solid porogens, a technique using gas as a porogen has been developed. First, disc-shaped structures made of the desired polymer are prepared by means of compression molding using a heated mold. The discs are then placed in a chamber where they are exposed to high pressure CO2 for several days. The pressure inside the chamber is gradually restored to atmospheric levels. During this procedure the pores are formed by the carbon dioxide molecules that abandon the polymer, resulting in a sponge-like structure. The main problems resulting from such a technique are caused by the excessive heat used during compression molding (which prohibits the incorporation of any temperature labile material into the polymer matrix) and by the fact that the pores do not form an interconnected structure.

====Emulsification freeze-drying====
This technique does not require the use of a solid porogen like SCPL. First, a synthetic polymer is dissolved into a suitable solvent (e.g. polylactic acid in dichloromethane) then water is added to the polymeric solution and the two liquids are mixed in order to obtain an emulsion. Before the two phases can separate, the emulsion is cast into a mold and quickly frozen by means of immersion into liquid nitrogen. The frozen emulsion is subsequently freeze-dried to remove the dispersed water and the solvent, thus leaving a solidified, porous polymeric structure. While emulsification and freeze-drying allow for a faster preparation when compared to SCPL (since it does not require a time-consuming leaching step), it still requires the use of solvents. Moreover, pore size is relatively small and porosity is often irregular. Freeze-drying by itself is also a commonly employed technique for the fabrication of scaffolds. In particular, it is used to prepare collagen sponges: collagen is dissolved into acidic solutions of acetic acid or hydrochloric acid that are cast into a mold, frozen with liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized.

====Thermally induced phase separation====
Similar to the previous technique, the TIPS phase separation procedure requires the use of a solvent with a low melting point that is easy to sublime. For example, dioxane could be used to dissolve polylactic acid, then phase separation is induced through the addition of a small quantity of water: a polymer-rich and a polymer-poor phase are formed. Following cooling below the solvent melting point and some days of vacuum-drying to sublime the solvent, a porous scaffold is obtained. Liquid-liquid phase separation presents the same drawbacks of emulsification/freeze-drying.

==== Electrospinning ====
Electrospinning is a highly versatile technique that can be used to produce continuous fibers ranging in diameter from a few microns to a few nanometers. In a typical electrospinning set-up, the desired scaffold material is dissolved within a solvent and placed within a syringe. This solution is fed through a needle and a high voltage is applied to the tip and to a conductive collection surface. The buildup of electrostatic forces within the solution causes it to eject a thin fibrous stream towards the oppositely charged or grounded collection surface. During this process the solvent evaporates, leaving solid fibers leaving a highly porous network. This technique is highly tunable, with variation to solvent, voltage, working distance (distance from the needle to collection surface), flow rate of solution, solute concentration, and collection surface. This allows for precise control of fiber morphology.

On a commercial level however, due to scalability reasons, there are 40 or sometimes 96 needles involved operating at once. The bottle-necks in such set-ups are: 1) Maintaining the aforementioned variables uniformly for all of the needles and 2) formation of &quot;beads&quot; in single fibers that we as engineers, want to be of a uniform diameter. By modifying variables such as the distance to collector, magnitude of applied voltage, or solution flow rateresearchers can dramatically change the overall scaffold architecture.

Historically, research on electrospun fibrous scaffolds dates back to at least the late 1980s when Simon showed that electrospinning could be used to produce nano- and submicron-scale fibrous scaffolds from polymer solutions specifically intended for use as &quot;in vitro&quot; cell and tissue substrates. This early use of electrospun lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types would adhere to and proliferate upon polycarbonate fibers. It was noted that as opposed to the flattened morphology typically seen in 2D culture, cells grown on the electrospun fibers exhibited a more rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally observed of tissues &quot;in vivo&quot;.

====CAD/CAM technologies====
Because most of the above techniques are limited when it comes to the control of porosity and pore size, computer assisted design and manufacturing techniques have been introduced to tissue engineering. First, a three-dimensional structure is designed using CAD software. The porosity can be tailored using algorithms within the software. The scaffold is then realized by using ink-jet printing of polymer powders or through Fused Deposition Modeling of a polymer melt.

A 2011 study by El-Ayoubi et al. investigated &quot;3D-plotting technique to produce (biocompatible and biodegradable) poly-L-Lactide macroporous scaffolds with two different pore sizes&quot; via solid free-form fabrication (SSF) with computer-aided-design (CAD), to explore therapeutic articular cartilage replacement as an &quot;alternative to conventional tissue repair&quot;. The study found the smaller the pore size paired with mechanical stress in a bioreactor (to induce in vivo-like conditions), the higher the cell viability in potential therapeutic functionality via decreasing recovery time and increasing transplant effectiveness.

====Laser-assisted bioprinting====
In a 2012 study, Koch et al. focused on whether Laser-assisted BioPrinting (LaBP) can be used to build multicellular 3D patterns in natural matrix, and whether the generated constructs are functioning and forming tissue. LaBP arranges small volumes of living cell suspensions in set high-resolution patterns. The investigation was successful, the researchers foresee that &quot;generated tissue constructs might be used for in vivo testing by implanting them into animal models&quot; (14). As of this study, only human skin tissue has been synthesized, though researchers project that &quot;by integrating further cell types (e.g. melanocytes, Schwann cells, hair follicle cells) into the printed cell construct, the behavior of these cells in a 3D in vitro microenvironment similar to their natural one can be analyzed&quot;, which is useful for drug discovery and toxicology studies.

====Self-assembled recombinant spider silk nanomembranes====
Gustafsson et al. demonstrated free‐standing, bioactive membranes of cm-sized area, but only 250 nm thin, that were formed by self‐assembly of spider silk at the interface of an aqueous solution. The membranes uniquely combine nanoscale thickness, biodegradability, ultrahigh strain and strength, permeability to proteins and promote rapid cell adherence and proliferation. They demonstrated growing a coherent layer of keratinocytes. These spider silk nanomembranes have also been used to create a static &quot;in-vitro&quot; model of a blood vessel.

==== Tissue engineering &quot;in situ&quot; ====
&quot;In situ&quot; tissue regeneration is defined as the implantation of biomaterials (alone or in combination with cells and/or biomolecules) into the tissue defect, using the surrounding microenvironment of the organism as a natural bioreactor. This approach has found application in bone regeneration, allowing the formation of cell-seeded constructs directly in the operating room.

== Assembly methods ==

A persistent problem within tissue engineering is mass transport limitations. Engineered tissues generally lack an initial blood supply, thus making it difficult for any implanted cells to obtain sufficient oxygen and nutrients to survive, or function properly.

===Self-assembly===
Self-assembly methods have been shown to be promising methods for tissue engineering. Self-assembly methods have the advantage of allowing tissues to develop their own extracellular matrix, resulting in tissue that better recapitulates biochemical and biomechanical properties of native tissue. Self-assembling engineered articular cartilage was introduced by Jerry Hu and Kyriacos A. Athanasiou in 2006 and applications of the process have resulted in engineered cartilage approaching the strength of native tissue. Self-assembly is a prime technology to get cells grown in a lab to assemble into three-dimensional shapes. To break down tissues into cells, researchers first have to dissolve the extracellular matrix that normally binds them together. Once cells are isolated, they must form the complex structures that make up our natural tissues.

===Liquid-based template assembly===
The air-liquid surface established by Faraday waves is explored as a template to assemble biological entities for bottom-up tissue engineering. This liquid-based template can be dynamically reconfigured in a few seconds, and the assembly on the template can be achieved in a scalable and parallel manner. Assembly of microscale hydrogels, cells, neuron-seeded micro-carrier beads, cell spheroids into various symmetrical and periodic structures was demonstrated with good cell viability. Formation of 3-D neural network was achieved after 14-day tissue culture.

===Additive manufacturing===

It might be possible to print organs, or possibly entire organisms using additive manufacturing techniques. A recent innovative method of construction uses an ink-jet mechanism to print precise layers of cells in a matrix of thermo-reversible gel. Endothelial cells, the cells that line blood vessels, have been printed in a set of stacked rings. When incubated, these fused into a tube. This technique has been referred to as &quot;bioprinting&quot; within the field as it involves the printing of biological components in a structure resembling the organ of focus.

The field of three-dimensional and highly accurate models of biological systems is pioneered by multiple projects and technologies including a rapid method for creating tissues and even whole organs involve a 3-D printer that can bio-print the scaffolding and cells layer by layer into a working tissue sample or organ. The device is presented in a TED talk by Dr. Anthony Atala, M.D. the Director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and the W.H. Boyce Professor and Chair of the Department of Urology at Wake Forest University, in which a kidney is printed on stage during the seminar and then presented to the crowd. It is anticipated that this technology will enable the production of livers in the future for transplantation and theoretically for toxicology and other biological studies as well.

In 2015 Multi-Photon Processing (MPP) was employed for in vivo experiments by engineering artificial cartilage constructs. An ex vivo histological examination showed that certain pore geometry and the pre-growing of chondrocytes (Cho) prior to implantation significantly improves the performance of the created 3-D scaffolds. The achieved biocompatibility was comparable to the commercially available collagen membranes. The successful outcome of this study supports the idea that hexagonal-pore-shaped hybrid organic-inorganic micro-structured scaffolds in combination with Cho seeding may be successfully implemented for cartilage tissue engineering.

Recently, tissue engineering has advanced with a focus on vascularization. Using Two-Photon Polymerization-based additive manufacturing, synthetic 3D microvessel networks are created from tubular hydrogel structures. These networks can perfuse tissues several cubic millimeters in size, enabling long-term viability and cell growth in vitro. This innovation marks a significant step forward in tissue engineering, facilitating the development of complex human tissue models.

===Scaffolding===
In 2013, using a 3-D scaffolding of Matrigel in various configurations, substantial pancreatic organoids was produced in vitro. Clusters of small numbers of cells proliferated into 40,000 cells within one week. The clusters transform into cells that make either digestive enzymes or hormones like insulin, self-organizing into branched pancreatic organoids that resemble the pancreas.

The cells are sensitive to the environment, such as gel stiffness and contact with other cells. Individual cells do not thrive; a minimum of four proximate cells was required for subsequent organoid development. Modifications to the medium composition produced either hollow spheres mainly composed of pancreatic progenitors, or complex organoids that spontaneously undergo pancreatic morphogenesis and differentiation. Maintenance and expansion of pancreatic progenitors require active Notch and FGF signaling, recapitulating in vivo niche signaling interactions.

The organoids were seen as potentially offering mini-organs for drug testing and for spare insulin-producing cells.

Aside from Matrigel 3-D scaffolds, other collagen gel systems have been developed. Collagen/hyaluronic acid scaffolds have been used for modeling the mammary gland In Vitro while co-coculturing epithelial and adipocyte cells. The HyStem kit is another 3-D platform containing ECM components and hyaluronic acid that has been used for cancer research. Additionally, hydrogel constituents can be chemically modified to assist in crosslinking and enhance their mechanical properties.

== Tissue culture ==

In many cases, creation of functional tissues and biological structures &quot;in vitro&quot; requires extensive culturing to promote survival, growth and inducement of functionality. In general, the basic requirements of cells must be maintained in culture, which include oxygen, pH, humidity, temperature, nutrients and osmotic pressure maintenance.

Tissue engineered cultures also present additional problems in maintaining culture conditions. In standard cell culture, diffusion is often the sole means of nutrient and metabolite transport. However, as a culture becomes larger and more complex, such as the case with engineered organs and whole tissues, other mechanisms must be employed to maintain the culture, such as the creation of capillary networks within the tissue.

Another issue with tissue culture is introducing the proper factors or stimuli required to induce functionality. In many cases, simple maintenance culture is not sufficient. Growth factors, hormones, specific metabolites or nutrients, chemical and physical stimuli are sometimes required. For example, certain cells respond to changes in oxygen tension as part of their normal development, such as chondrocytes, which must adapt to low oxygen conditions or hypoxia during skeletal development. Others, such as endothelial cells, respond to shear stress from fluid flow, which is encountered in blood vessels. Mechanical stimuli, such as pressure pulses seem to be beneficial to all kind of cardiovascular tissue such as heart valves, blood vessels or pericardium.

=== Bioreactors ===

In tissue engineering, a bioreactor is a device that attempts to simulate a physiological environment in order to promote cell or tissue growth in vitro. A physiological environment can consist of many different parameters such as temperature, pressure, oxygen or carbon dioxide concentration, or osmolality of fluid environment, and it can extend to all kinds of biological, chemical or mechanical stimuli. Therefore, there are systems that may include the application of forces such as electromagnetic forces, mechanical pressures, or fluid pressures to the tissue. These systems can be two- or three-dimensional setups. Bioreactors can be used in both academic and industry applications. General-use and application-specific bioreactors are also commercially available, which may provide static chemical stimulation or a combination of chemical and mechanical stimulation.

Cell proliferation and differentiation are largely influenced by mechanical and biochemical cues in the surrounding extracellular matrix environment. Bioreactors are typically developed to replicate the specific physiological environment of the tissue being grown (e.g., flex and fluid shearing for heart tissue growth). This can allow specialized cell lines to thrive in cultures replicating their native environments, but it also makes bioreactors attractive tools for culturing stem cells. A successful stem-cell-based bioreactor is effective at expanding stem cells with uniform properties and/or promoting controlled, reproducible differentiation into selected mature cell types.

There are a variety of bioreactors designed for 3D cell cultures. There are small plastic cylindrical chambers, as well as glass chambers, with regulated internal humidity and moisture specifically engineered for the purpose of growing cells in three dimensions. The bioreactor uses bioactive synthetic materials such as polyethylene terephthalate membranes to surround the spheroid cells in an environment that maintains high levels of nutrients. They are easy to open and close, so that cell spheroids can be removed for testing, yet the chamber is able to maintain 100% humidity throughout. This humidity is important to achieve maximum cell growth and function. The bioreactor chamber is part of a larger device that rotates to ensure equal cell growth in each direction across three dimensions.

QuinXell Technologies now under Quintech Life Sciences from Singapore has developed a bioreactor known as the TisXell Biaxial Bioreactor which is specially designed for the purpose of tissue engineering. It is the first bioreactor in the world to have a spherical glass chamber with biaxial rotation; specifically to mimic the rotation of the fetus in the womb; which provides a conducive environment for the growth of tissues.

Multiple forms of mechanical stimulation have also been combined into a single bioreactor. Using gene expression analysis, one academic study found that applying a combination of cyclic strain and ultrasound stimulation to pre-osteoblast cells in a bioreactor accelerated matrix maturation and differentiation. The technology of this combined stimulation bioreactor could be used to grow bone cells more quickly and effectively in future clinical stem cell therapies.

MC2 Biotek has also developed a bioreactor known as ProtoTissue that uses gas exchange to maintain high oxygen levels within the cell chamber; improving upon previous bioreactors, since the higher oxygen levels help the cell grow and undergo normal cell respiration.

Active areas of research on bioreactors includes increasing production scale and refining the physiological environment, both of which could improve the efficiency and efficacy of bioreactors in research or clinical use. Bioreactors are currently used to study, among other things, cell and tissue level therapies, cell and tissue response to specific physiological environment changes, and development of disease and injury.

=== Long fiber generation ===
In 2013, a group from the University of Tokyo developed cell laden fibers up to a meter in length and on the order of 100 μm in size. These fibers were created using a microfluidic device that forms a double coaxial laminar flow. Each &#x27;layer&#x27; of the microfluidic device (cells seeded in ECM, a hydrogel sheath, and finally a calcium chloride solution). The seeded cells culture within the hydrogel sheath for several days, and then the sheath is removed with viable cell fibers. Various cell types were inserted into the ECM core, including myocytes, endothelial cells, nerve cell fibers, and epithelial cell fibers. This group then showed that these fibers can be woven together to fabricate tissues or organs in a mechanism similar to textile weaving. Fibrous morphologies are advantageous in that they provide an alternative to traditional scaffold design, and many organs (such as muscle) are composed of fibrous cells.

===Bioartificial organs===
An artificial organ is an engineered device that can be extra corporeal or implanted to support impaired or failing organ systems. Bioartificial organs are typically created with the intent to restore critical biological functions like in the replacement of diseased hearts and lungs, or provide drastic quality of life improvements like in the use of engineered skin on burn victims. While some examples of bioartificial organs are still in the research stage of development due to the limitations involved with creating functional organs, others are currently being used in clinical settings experimentally and commercially.

==== Lung ====
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machines, otherwise known as heart and lung machines, are an adaptation of cardiopulmonary bypass techniques that provide heart and lung support. It is used primarily to support the lungs for a prolonged but still temporary timeframe (1–30 days) and allow for recovery from reversible diseases. Robert Bartlett is known as the father of ECMO and performed the first treatment of a newborn using an ECMO machine in 1975.

Skin

Tissue-engineered skin is a type of bioartificial organ that is often used to treat burns, diabetic foot ulcers, or other large wounds that cannot heal well on their own. Artificial skin can be made from autografts, allografts, and xenografts. Autografted skin comes from a patient&#x27;s own skin, which allows the dermis to have a faster healing rate, and the donor site can be re-harvested a few times. Allograft skin often comes from cadaver skin and is mostly used to treat burn victims. Lastly, xenografted skin comes from animals and provides a temporary healing structure for the skin. They assist in dermal regeneration, but cannot become part of the host skin. Tissue-engineered skin is now available in commercial products. Integra, originally used to only treat burns, consists of a collagen matrix and chondroitin sulfate that can be used as a skin replacement. The chondroitin sulfate functions as a component of proteoglycans, which helps to form the extracellular matrix. Integra can be repopulated and revascularized while maintaining its dermal collagen architecture, making it a bioartificial organ Dermagraft, another commercial-made tissue-engineered skin product, is made out of living fibroblasts. These fibroblasts proliferate and produce growth factors, collagen, and ECM proteins, that help build granulation tissue.

==== Heart ====

Since the number of patients awaiting a heart transplant is continuously increasing over time, and the number of patients on the waiting list surpasses the organ availability, artificial organs used as replacement therapy for terminal heart failure would help alleviate this difficulty. Artificial hearts are usually used to bridge the heart transplantation or can be applied as replacement therapy for terminal heart malfunction. The total artificial heart (TAH), first introduced by Dr. Vladimir P. Demikhov in 1937, emerged as an ideal alternative. Since then it has been developed and improved as a mechanical pump that provides long-term circulatory support and replaces diseased or damaged heart ventricles that cannot properly pump the blood, restoring thus the pulmonary and systemic flow. Some of the current TAHs include AbioCor, an FDA-approved device that comprises two artificial ventricles and their valves, and does not require subcutaneous connections, and is indicated for patients with biventricular heart failure. In 2010 SynCardia released the portable freedom driver that allows patients to have a portable device without being confined to the hospital.

==== Kidney ====
While kidney transplants are possible, renal failure is more often treated using an artificial kidney. The first artificial kidneys and the majority of those currently in use are extracorporeal, such as with hemodialysis, which filters blood directly, or peritoneal dialysis, which filters via a fluid in the abdomen. In order to contribute to the biological functions of a kidney such as producing metabolic factors or hormones, some artificial kidneys incorporate renal cells. There has been progress in the way of making these devices smaller and more transportable, or even implantable . One challenge still to be faced in these smaller devices is countering the limited volume and therefore limited filtering capabilities.

Bioscaffolds have also been introduced to provide a framework upon which normal kidney tissue can be regenerated. These scaffolds encompass natural scaffolds (e.g., decellularized kidneys, collagen hydrogel, or silk fibroin), synthetic scaffolds (e.g., poly[lactic-co-glycolic acid] or other polymers), or a combination of two or more natural and synthetic scaffolds. These scaffolds can be implanted into the body either without cell treatment or after a period of stem cell seeding and incubation. In vitro and In vivo studies are being conducted to compare and optimize the type of scaffold and to assess whether cell seeding prior to implantation adds to the viability, regeneration and effective function of the kidneys. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis compared the results of published animal studies and identified that improved outcomes are reported with the use of hybrid (mixed) scaffolds and cell seeding; however, the meta-analysis of these results were not in agreement with the evaluation of descriptive results from the review. Therefore, further studies involving larger animals and novel scaffolds, and more transparent reproduction of previous studies are advisable.

===Biomimetics===
Biomimetics is a field that aims to produce materials and systems that replicate those present in nature. In the context of tissue engineering, this is a common approach used by engineers to create materials for these applications that are comparable to native tissues in terms of their structure, properties, and biocompatibility. Material properties are largely dependent on physical, structural, and chemical characteristics of that material. Subsequently, a biomimetic approach to system design will become significant in material integration, and a sufficient understanding of biological processes and interactions will be necessary. Replication of biological systems and processes may also be used in the synthesis of bio-inspired materials to achieve conditions that produce the desired biological material. Therefore, if a material is synthesized having the same characteristics of biological tissues both structurally and chemically, then ideally the synthesized material will have similar properties. This technique has an extensive history originating from the idea of using natural phenomenon as design inspiration for solutions to human problems. Many modern advancements in technology have been inspired by nature and natural systems, including aircraft, automobiles, architecture, and even industrial systems. Advancements in nanotechnology initiated the application of this technique to micro- and nano-scale problems, including tissue engineering. This technique has been used to develop synthetic bone tissues, vascular technologies, scaffolding materials and integration techniques, and functionalized nanoparticles.

== Constructing neural networks in soft material ==
In 2018, scientists at Brandeis University reported their research on soft material embedded with chemical networks which can mimic the smooth and coordinated behavior of neural tissue. This research was funded by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. The researchers presented an experimental system of neural networks, theoretically modeled as reaction-diffusion systems. Within the networks was an array of patterned reactors, each performing the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. These reactors could function on a nanoliter scale.

The researchers state that the inspiration for their project was the movement of the blue ribbon eel. The eel&#x27;s movements are controlled by electrical impulses determined by a class of neural networks called the central pattern generator.  Central Pattern Generators function within the autonomic nervous system to control bodily functions such as respiration, movement, and peristalsis.

Qualities of the reactor that were designed were the network topology, boundary conditions, initial conditions, reactor volume, coupling strength, and the synaptic polarity of the reactor (whether its behavior is inhibitory or excitatory). A BZ emulsion system with a solid elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was designed. Both light and bromine permeable PDMS have been reported as viable methods to create a pacemaker for neural networks.

== Market ==
The history of the tissue engineering market can be divided into three major parts. The time before the crash of the biotech market in the early 2000s, the crash and the time afterward.

=== Beginning ===
Most early progress in tissue engineering research was done in the US. This is due to less strict regulations regarding stem cell research and more available funding than in other countries. This leads to the creation of academic startups many of them coming from Harvard or MIT. Examples are BioHybrid Technologies whose founder, Bill Chick, went to Harvard Medical School and focused on the creation of artificial pancreas. Another example would be Organogenesis Inc. whose founder went to MIT and worked on skin engineering products. Other companies with links to the MIT are TEI Biosciences, Therics and Guilford Pharmaceuticals. The renewed interest in biotechnologies in the 1980s leads to many private investors investing in these new technologies even though the business models of these early startups were often not very clear and did not present a path to long term profitability. Government sponsors were more restrained in their funding as tissue engineering was considered a high-risk investment.

In the UK the market got off to a slower start even though the regulations on stem cell research were not strict as well. This is mainly due to more investors being less willing to invest in these new technologies which were considered to be high-risk investments. Another problem faced by British companies was getting the NHS to pay for their products. This especially because the NHS runs a cost-effectiveness analysis on all supported products. Novel technologies often do not do well in this respect.

In Japan, the regulatory situation was quite different. First cell cultivation was only allowed in a hospital setting and second academic scientists employed by state-owned universities were not allowed outside employment until 1998. Moreover, the Japanese authorities took longer to approve new drugs and treatments than there US and European counterparts.

For these reasons in the early days of the Japanese market, the focus was mainly on getting products that were already approved elsewhere in Japan and selling them. Contrary to the US market the early actors in Japan were mainly big firms or sub-companies of such big firms, such as J-TEC, Menicon and Terumo, and not small startups. After regulatory changes in 2014, which allowed cell cultivation outside of a hospital setting, the speed of research in Japan increased and Japanese companies also started to develop their own products.

=== Crash ===
Soon after the big boom, the first problems started to appear. There were problems getting products approved by the FDA and if they got approved there were often difficulties in getting insurance providers to pay for the products and getting it accepted by health care providers.

For example, organogenesis ran into problems marketing its product and integrating its product in the health system. This partially due to the difficulties of handling living cells and the increased difficulties faced by physicians in using these products over conventional methods.

Another example would be Advanced Tissue Sciences Dermagraft skin product which could not create a high enough demand without reimbursements from insurance providers. Reasons for this were $4000 price-tag and the circumstance that Additionally Advanced Tissue Sciences struggled to get their product known by physicians.

The above examples demonstrate how companies struggled to make profit. This, in turn, lead investors to lose patience and stopping further funding. In consequence, several Tissue Engineering companies such as Organogenesis and Advanced Tissue Sciences filed for bankruptcy in the early 2000s. At this time, these were the only ones having commercial skin products on the market.

=== Reemergence ===
The technologies of the bankrupt or struggling companies were often bought by other companies which continued the development under more conservative business models. Examples of companies who sold their products after folding were Curis and Intercytex.

Many of the companies abandoned their long-term goals of developing fully functional organs in favor of products and technologies that could turn a profit in the short run. Examples of these kinds of products are products in the cosmetic and testing industry.

In other cases such as in the case of Advanced Tissue Sciences, the founders started new companies.

In the 2010s the regulatory framework also started to facilitate faster time to market especially in the US as new centres and pathways were created by the FDA specifically aimed at products coming from living cells such as the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

The first tissue engineering products started to get commercially profitable in the 2010s.

== Regulation ==

In Europe, regulation is currently split into three areas of regulation: medical devices, medicinal products, and biologics. Tissue engineering products are often of hybrid nature, as they are often composed of cells and a supporting structure. While some products can be approved as medicinal products, others need to gain approval as medical devices. Derksen explains in her thesis that tissue engineering researchers are sometimes confronted with regulation that does not fit the characteristics of tissue engineering.

New regulatory regimes have been observed in Europe that tackle these issues. An explanation for the difficulties in finding regulatory consensus in this matter is given by a survey conducted in the UK. The authors attribute these problems to the close relatedness and overlap with other technologies such as xenotransplantation. It can therefore not be handled separately by regulatory bodies. Regulation is further complicated by the ethical controversies associated with this and related fields of research (e.g. stem cells controversy, ethics of organ transplantation). The same survey as mentioned above shows on the example of autologous cartilage transplantation that a specific technology can be regarded as &#x27;pure&#x27; or &#x27;polluted&#x27; by the same social actor.

Two regulatory movements are most relevant to tissue engineering in the European Union. These are Directive 2004/23/EC on standards of quality and safety for the sourcing and processing of human tissues which was adopted by the European Parliament in 2004 and a proposed Human Tissue-Engineered Products regulation. The latter was developed under the auspices of the European Commission DG Enterprise and presented in Brussels in 2004.

<text>Eberswalde () is a major town and the administrative seat of the district Barnim in Brandenburg in north-eastern Germany, about northeast of Berlin. Population 42,144 (census in June 2005), geographical location . The town is often called Waldstadt (forest town), because of the large forests around it, including the Schorfheide-Chorin Biosphere Reserve. Despite this fact, Eberswalde was an important industrial center until the German Reunification.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The area around Eberswalde was already populated in Paleolithic. Before the establishment of the Margraviate of Brandenburg it was the place of a Slavic stockade. The Treasure of Eberswalde, the largest pre-Christian gold treasure from the area of today&#x27;s Germany was found here. Today the treasure is located in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow.

===Founding and development===
The town of &quot;Everswolde&quot; (&quot;forest of the boars&quot;) was established in 1254 by the Ascanian margrave Johann I. It was first mentioned in a document dated April 23, 1276 when margrave Albrecht III. resided there. In 1300 it received market rights. From the year 1317 the main trade route between Szczecin and Frankfurt (Oder) went through the town. In 1319, it was captured by Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg. From 1373 to 1415, it was part of the Lands of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown. A major fire struck the town in 1499.

After rebuilding the town, Eberswalde became the first industrial town of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, with huge metallurgy capacities. Some parts of the town are still named from their past function, like Kupferhammer (&quot;copper hammer&quot;). 1605 till 1620 the important waterway Finow Canal was built.

===Thirty Years&#x27; War===
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War Eberswalde was besieged and conquered several times by nearly every important faction of the war. The general of the Catholic League, Albrecht von Wallenstein, resided in the town, later Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, who did not survive the battle of Lützen, was embalmed in the town&#x27;s Maria Magdalena church. Both parties forced the town population to support their troops. After the end of the war only 33 of formerly 216 houses still stood and of an original population of 1200 only 168 survived, 28 of which had full citizen status. It took Eberswalde more than a century to recover from its losses.

===Rebirth and growth===
Between 1743 and 1755 120 families of metalworkers moved from Thuringia and the Rhineland to Eberswalde. The boilers of the first German steam engines were made here. From 1815 to 1947, Eberswalde was part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. During the 19th century large factories were built in the area of Eberswalde, especially along the Finow Canal. In 1830 it became the site of what is now the Hochschule für nachhaltige Entwicklung Eberswalde. On November 23, 1877 the first German telephone line was established in the town.

===20th century===
The world&#x27;s first radio concert was broadcast from Eberswalde in 1923. Werner Forssmann received his 1956 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his 1929 experiments with cardiac catheterization performed on his own heart, whilst resident in Eberswalde.

In the 1938 pogroms, Eberswalde&#x27;s synagogue was destroyed. During World War II, several factories employed forced labourers and inmates of the Ravensbrück concentration camp. At the end of the war, the town center was attacked by the German Luftwaffe, in an attempt to delay the Soviet advance. After learning that Soviet forces had taken Eberswalde without a fight, Adolf Hitler admitted defeat in his underground bunker and stated that suicide was his only recourse.

From 1947 to 1952, Eberswalde was part of the State of Brandenburg, from 1952 to 1990 of the Bezirk Frankfurt of East Germany and since 1990 again of Brandenburg.

In 1970 Eberswalde was merged with the settlement of Finow to create Eberswalde-Finow. In 1993 the name Eberswalde was restored.

== Demography ==


==Mayor==

On 3 April 2022 Götz Hermann (independent) was elected mayor of Eberswalde with 61.9% of the votes. He replaced Friedhelm Boginski (FDP), who was mayor since 2006 and left in 2021 due to his election as Member of Parliament.

The previous mayor Reinhard Schulz (independent) was unelected in July 2006 with 91,2 % of the votes.

==Transport==
Eberswalde has access to the federal highways (Bundesstraße) B 2 and B 167 and the highway (Autobahn) A 11-E28. Eberswalde station is located on the Berlin–Szczecin railway line that first connected Eberswalde and Berlin in 1842. It is the starting point of the railway lines to Templin and Frankfurt (Oder) and was terminus of the Eberswalde-Finowfurter-Eisenbahn (EFE) to Finowfurt until it was discontinued.

The town and its industrial areas are on the Oder Havel Canal and Finow Canal waterways. The airfield Flugplatz Finow is a former Soviet Air Force base that was handed over to civil use on May 11, 1993.

The town had a tram service until 1940, when the trams were replaced by the trolleybuses. Eberswalde is one of only three towns in Germany where trolleybuses are still in operation, along with Solingen and Esslingen.

==Economy==

While Eberswalde was renowned for its thriving heavy industry in the past, since the fall of the wall, it has fallen upon harder times. As the East German government fell, state support vanished, and factories had to suddenly compete with more efficient firms in the West. As a result, many factories in Eberswalde went under, and visitors can see the remnants of these abandoned plants across town. Like many former East German towns, Eberswalde has since struggled with unemployment, and many have left the region in search of work elsewhere. Consequently, many of the huge Soviet-Bloc style apartment complexes in Eberswalde (most notably the Brandenburgisches Viertel) are becoming empty, and are slowly being razed.

==Culture==

===Festivals===
Carnival
Compared to other towns of the region, Eberswalde has quite a huge Carnival society. It was brought to Eberswalde from Bavaria and from the Rhineland, both are standing for different Carnival traditions. That&#x27;s why Carnival is celebrated in two independent festivals at the same time, they are called &quot;Karneval&quot; and &quot;Fasching&quot;.

Rock me Magdalena

&quot;Rock me Magdalena&quot; is a rock concert in the Maria Magdalena church of Eberswalde, taking place every December 25.

Filmfest Eberswalde

Since 2004 there is the annual Eberswalde Movie Festival for Independent Film and Documentaries.

===Culinary traditions===
There are some foods that are associated with Eberswalde. The most important of them are &quot;Eberswalder Spritzkuchen&quot; (a special pastry that was invented in Eberswalde in 1832) and &quot;Eberswalder Würstchen&quot; (sausages).

===Language===
The tongue spoken in the region of Eberswalde is often called &quot;Eberswalder Kanaldeutsch&quot; (canal German). It is not an independent German dialect, but a very extreme mix of the Berlin Dialect and a bit of East Low German. Other forms of &quot;Kanaldeutsch&quot;, that are derived from the Eberswalde form, nearly developed back to the Berlin Dialect. That&#x27;s why &quot;Eberswalder Kanaldeutsch&quot; is the only one that is in fact sometimes considered as an independent German dialect.

===Gardens===
The Forstbotanischer Garten Eberswalde is a historic botanical garden and arboretum.

== Religion ==

=== Evangelical ===
The evangelical city parish of Eberswalde is part of the Evangelical Church Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO) and maintains three churches.

=== Catholic ===
Eberswalde is seat of a deanery since 1938.

<doc id="307072" wikidata="Q885677" url="?curid=307072" title="Blue Crush">
<text>Blue Crush is a 2002 American sports film directed by John Stockwell, written by Stockwell and Lizzy Weiss, and based on Susan Orlean&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Outside&quot; magazine article &quot;Life&#x27;s Swell&quot;. It stars Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, Sanoe Lake, and Mika Boorem. The film follows three friends, working at the hotel resort and surfing in Oahu, Hawaii.

==Plot==
Anne Marie, her fourteen-year-old sister Penny, and good friends Eden and Lena, live in a small house on the North Shore. They all have been helping raise Penny since her mother moved to Las Vegas with her boyfriend. While Penny is at school, Anne Marie, Eden, and Lena work as maids in a super-luxury resort hotel, and surfing in their spare time. As a child, Anne Marie had been a rising star in women&#x27;s surfing until a near-fatal wipeout left her with a paralyzing fear of a powerful condition. Although she rises every morning before dawn to train for her surfing comeback, this fear continues to hamper her progress. Her friends, especially Eden, encourage her to overcome her past trauma, conquer her fears of big waves, and become a professional surfer.

Anne Marie is invited to join the surfing competition at a famed North Shore surf spot, the very challenging Banzai Pipeline. If she can do well enough to gain the attention of a sponsor, it could lift her and her friends out of the near-poverty in which they live. As the Pipeline competition gets closer, Anne Marie struggles to keep Penny from running wild and deal with family issues.

Anne Marie meets Matt Tollman, a National Football League quarterback who is in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. He is obviously instantly attracted to the surfer especially after she boldly confronts another NFL Pro Bowler that had trashed his hotel room, leaving a mess for Anne Marie and her friends to clean. After a few encounters, Matt says he wants to learn to surf, and Anne Marie agrees to teach him and several of his teammates to surf for $150 per hour, with Lena, Eden, and Penny acting as coaches. Anne Marie sees Matt again while getting the money from the hotel room, but a call comes in for Matt from another woman. Anne Marie asks if it is Matt&#x27;s wife, but he explains it is his niece. Later, they sleep together.

Anne Marie&#x27;s acceptance of an outsider as her boyfriend causes friction between her and some young male surfers on the North Shore. Eden points out to Anne Marie that her current interest in Matt has weakened her commitment to training for the Pipeline contest. Anne Marie also overhears very demeaning comments about herself from some of the other football players&#x27; wives and girlfriends staying at the hotel.

Anne Marie confronts Matt about the situation and resolves to step up her game, fully committing herself to the Pipeline Masters. On the day of Pipeline, Anne Marie wipes out during her first heat, but she advances to the next one after narrowly beating pro surfer Kate Skarratt. She is shaken, but Matt tells her how he failed in his first game as an NFL quarterback, which helps her control her wavering confidence.

Determined, although still apprehensive, Anne Marie returns to the water. Competing in the same heat is Keala Kennelly, one of the first professional female surfers. While Keala surfs the first few sets of waves well, Anne Marie is still reluctant to try one, visions of her near-drowning incident holding her back. Keala finishes her turn, and paddles back out to take Anne Marie under her wing. Keala encourages her to ride the best wave of the day, and Anne Marie does it perfectly, scoring a perfect ten. Although Anne Marie cannot advance to the next heat, she regains her lost confidence and attracted the attention of sponsors, one of whom immediately offers to have her join the Billabong women&#x27;s surf team.

===Appearances by notable surfers===
==Production==
&quot;Blue Crush&quot; was the first film to use Hawaii&#x27;s Act 221, a progressive local tax incentive that called for a 100 percent state tax credit for high-tech investments meeting the requirements for qualified high-tech business, while also allowing local investors to receive tax credits for investments in film or television productions. Universal Studios used the legislation for the &quot;Blue Crush&quot; production, receiving approximately $16 million in a deal with local investors who, in exchange, received the film&#x27;s high-tech tax credits. The agreement also involved marketing rights for the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau whereby the studio would cross-promote the film and the State of Hawaii. Entertainment executive April Masini, who helped produce &quot;Baywatch: Hawaii&quot;, &quot;Pacific Blue&quot;, and the Miss Universe Pageant, brought the tax incentives to the attention of Universal Studios, and along with producer Adam Fields advised the state in its negotiation.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Roger Ebert, in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film three out of four stars and a thumbs up, summarizing: &quot;Looking at the posters for &quot;Blue Crush&quot;, which show Bosworth, Rodriguez and Lake posing with bikinis and surfboards, I expected another mindless surfing movie. &quot;Blue Crush&quot; is anything but.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Blue Crush&quot; made $14.2million during its opening weekend, ranking in third place behind &quot;XXX&quot; and &quot;Signs&quot;. It grossed $40.4million in the United States and Canada, and $11.4million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $51.8million, against a budget of $25million.

==Soundtrack==

The song Youth of the Nation by P.O.D appears in the film but is not included on the album.

==Legacy==
The film was followed by a straight-to-video standalone sequel, titled &quot;Blue Crush 2&quot; (2011).

In October 2017, NBC revealed that it was in the early stages of developing a possible television series based on the film. As of 2024, the series was never produced.

<text>The Government in the Sunshine Act (, ) is a U.S. law passed in 1976 that affects the operations of the federal government, Congress, federal commissions, and other legally constituted federal bodies. It is one of a number of Freedom of Information Acts, intended to create greater transparency in government.

==Effect==
&quot;The Sunshine Act provides, with ten specified exemptions, that &#x27;every portion of every meeting of an agency shall be open to public observation.&#x27; 5 U.S.C. 552b(b) It imposes procedural requirements to ensure, &quot;inter alia&quot; [among other things], that advance notice is given to the public before agency meetings take place. It also imposes procedural requirements an agency must follow before determining that one of the ten exemptions from the openness requirement applies. However, neither the openness requirement, nor the related procedural requirements, are triggered unless the governmental entity at issue is an &#x27;agency,&#x27; and unless the gathering in question is a &#x27;meeting&#x27; of the agency.&quot; &quot;Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission&quot;, 216 F.3d 1180, 1182 (D.C. Cir. 2000).

==Definitions and exceptions==
The statute defines a &quot;meeting&quot; as &quot;the deliberations of at least the number of individual agency members required to take action on behalf of the agency where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official agency business&quot;. 552b(a)(2).

The statute defines &quot;agency&quot; to include &quot;any agency ... headed by a collegial body composed of two or more individual members ... and any subdivision thereof authorized to act on behalf of the agency&quot;. 552b(a)(1).

The Sunshine Act enumerates ten specific exemptions for categories of information that need not be disclosed. In summary these are:
* information relating to national defense;
* related solely to internal personnel rules and practices;
* matters specifically protected by law;
* trade secrets or privileged/confidential commercial information;
* matters censuring or accusing a person of a crime;
* information where disclosure would constitute a breach of privacy;
* related to investigatory records where the information would harm the proceedings;
* information for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions;
* which would lead to financial speculation or endanger the stability of any financial institution; or
* related to the agency&#x27;s participation in legal proceedings.

==Purpose==
The legislative intent of the Act is as follows:
&quot;The basic premise of the sunshine legislation is that, in the words of federalist No. 49, &#x27;the people are the only legitimate foundation of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter ... is derived.&#x27; Government is and should be the servant of the people, and it should be fully accountable to them for the actions which it supposedly takes on their behalf.&quot; (U.S.C.C.A.N. 2183, 2186).

<doc id="307080" wikidata="Q139245" url="?curid=307080" title="La Bamba (film)">
<text>La Bamba is a 1987 American biographical drama film written and directed by Luis Valdez. The film follows the life and short-lived musical career of American Chicano rock and roll star Ritchie Valens. The film stars Lou Diamond Phillips as Valens, Esai Morales, Rosanna DeSoto, Elizabeth Peña, Danielle von Zerneck and Joe Pantoliano. The film also covers the effect that Valens&#x27; career had on the lives of his half-brother Bob Morales, his girlfriend Donna Ludwig, and the rest of his family. The film is titled after a traditional Mexican folk song of the same name, which Valens transformed into a rock and roll rendition in 1958.

In 2017, &quot;La Bamba&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the U.S. Library of Congress being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and recommended for preservation.

==Plot==
During the summer of 1957 in Southern California, Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Steven Valenzuela is a 16-year old Mexican-American boy who lives with his mother, Concepcion &quot;Connie&quot; Valenzuela and his younger brothers and sisters. His family is poor, and he works as a farmhand after school. He loves rock-and-roll music and dreams of becoming a rockstar. Richie suffers from aviophobia due to recurring nightmares about the mid-air collision that occurred directly over his school, in which his best friend was crushed to death by the fallen aircraft, an event he did not witness due to attending his grandfather&#x27;s funeral. One day, Richie&#x27;s troubled older half-brother Bob Morales arrives after being released from jail, surprising him and his mother. They all decide to leave the farm and move to a house in Southern California, along with Bob&#x27;s girlfriend, Rosie.

Three months later, Richie attends San Fernando High School where he falls in love with his classmate Donna Ludwig, and joins his friend Chino&#x27;s band, The Silhouettes. Bob becomes an alcoholic and starts to abuse Rosie, shouting at her and admittedly almost raping her. When he learns that Rosie is pregnant, he refuses to take responsibility and leaves. Richie invites Donna to a garage party where he and the Silhouettes are performing. At the party, Richie performs on his guitar, but he doesn&#x27;t get his turn to sing and Donna does not attend.

Richie decides to host another party and becomes The Silhouettes&#x27; new leader after they vote out their original leader. However, a drunken Bob crashes the party and starts a brawl among the attendees. The next day, Bob Keane, the owner and president of Del-Fi Records in Hollywood, auditions Richie after seeing him perform at the party and signs him to his label; Keane becomes his record producer and manager. Richie and Donna become a couple, despite Donna&#x27;s father disapproving of his daughter dating a Hispanic boy, and Richie starts recording songs like &quot;We Belong Together&quot; and &quot;Come On, Let&#x27;s Go&quot; at Gold Star Studios. Keane gives Richie his professional name of &quot;Ritchie Valens&quot;, which Richie initially dislikes, but eventually comes to accept. Ritchie starts releasing his songs on radio and becomes an overnight sensation.

Despite his increasing fame, Ritchie&#x27;s relationship with Donna suffers with her father refusing to let Ritchie see her. He then gets the inspiration to write the song &quot;Donna&quot;, as a tribute to her. One night, Bob meets up with Ritchie, and they go to Tijuana, Mexico. At a brothel, Ritchie sees a band performing a traditional Mexican folk song called &quot;La Bamba&quot;. He awakens the next day in a small village and is given a talisman by a local Curandero to protect him from his fear of flying. Ritchie and Bob return home to discover that Rosie gave birth to a girl in their absence. Ritchie soon decides to make a rock-and-roll rendition of &quot;La Bamba&quot; as a single to go along with &quot;Donna&quot; and convinces Keane to release it.

At first, Ritchie avoids flying to his concerts and appearances, but eventually conquers his fear when invited to perform his song &quot;Donna&quot; on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in Philadelphia. Keane helps him by giving him a little vodka to calm his nerves during the flight. Bob becomes envious of Ritchie&#x27;s success and drinks excessively while screaming and shouting at his family, wanting to see his daughter. Ritchie buys his family a brand new house and goes to New York City to perform at Alan Freed&#x27;s 1st Anniversary Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Show at the Brooklyn Paramount Theater, meeting musicians Eddie Cochran and Jackie Wilson backstage. He then goes onstage to perform &quot;La Bamba&quot; to the crowd&#x27;s adoration. Arriving home for Christmas, he is given a welcoming party by his family and friends, but Bob is resentful and later starts a fight with Ritchie, breaking his talisman in the process. Ritchie promises Donna that he will always love her and hopes that one day they will get married.

Ritchie joins the Winter Dance Party tour alongside Buddy Holly and The Big Bopper after &quot;La Bamba&quot; and &quot;Donna&quot; reach the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. While performing in Clear Lake, Iowa, at the Surf Ballroom, the tour bus&#x27; heating system breaks down, so Buddy charters an airplane to fly to their next stop in Moorhead, Minnesota. Ritchie, Buddy, and the Big Bopper take off in the airplane during a snowstorm on February 2, 1959. Before the flight, Ritchie makes a call to his brother, wherein they resolve their differences. He invites Bob to fly out to Chicago to join the tour for family support, which Bob accepts.

The next day, as Bob is fixing his mother&#x27;s car, he hears on his radio that Ritchie, Buddy and The Big Bopper&#x27;s airplane had crashed, killing everyone on board. Bob darts out of his driveway in an attempt to get to his mother before she hears the news, but is too late. The news hits the Valenzuela family, Bob Keane, and Donna very hard. After Ritchie&#x27;s funeral procession at the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Bob walks across a bridge and screams out Ritchie&#x27;s name, remembering all the good times they had together.

== Reception ==
 Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert liked the film and the screenplay, writing, &quot;This is a good small movie, sweet and sentimental, about a kid who never really got a chance to show his stuff. The best things in it are the most unexpected things: the portraits of everyday life, of a loving mother, of a brother who loves and resents him, of a kid growing up and tasting fame and leaving everyone standing around at his funeral shocked that his life ended just as it seemed to be beginning.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin said she was impressed with Lou Diamond Phillips&#x27; performance, and wrote, &quot;A film like this is quite naturally a showcase for its star, and as Valens, Lou Diamond Phillips has a sweetness and sincerity that in no way diminish the toughness of his onstage persona. The role is blandly written, but Mr. Phillips gives Valens backbone.&quot;

<text>Surigao Strait (Filipino: &quot;Kipot ng Surigaw&quot;) is a strait in the southern Philippines, between the Bohol Sea and Leyte Gulf of the Philippine Sea.

==Geography==
It is located between the regions of Visayas and Mindanao. It lies between northern Mindanao Island and Panaon Island, and between the Dinagat Islands and Leyte island.

The strait is deep but has a strong current, up to . The northern entrance of the Surigao Strait is marked by a navigation light on Suluan Island.

The Hibuson island lies at the north end of the Surigao Strait.

==Transport==
It is regularly crossed by numerous ferries that transport goods and people between Visayas and Mindanao. The ferries stop at Liloan, Southern Leyte and Surigao City in Surigao del Norte.

==Etymology==
According to legend, the strait was named after Solibao, a Negrito chieftain, who lived at the outlet of the Surigao River. Migrating Visayan fishermen gradually formed a settlement there, and when Spanish explorers visited the place, they probably misheard the name as Surigao instead of Solibao. A different theory explains that Surigao may be derived from the Spanish word &quot;surgir&quot;, meaning &quot;swift water&quot; or &quot;current&quot;.

==History==
In March 1521 during the first circumnavigation of the Earth, Ferdinand Magellan and his crew were the first Europeans to sail through the strait.

The Battle of Surigao Strait took place here on October 25, 1944. The American battleships of the U.S. 7th Fleet Support Force commanded by Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf were able to &quot;cross the T&quot; against Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura&#x27;s Southern Force; nearly all of which, including the battleships &quot;Yamashiro&quot; and &quot;Fusō&quot;, were sunk. All but one of these American battleships had been in Pearl Harbor during the Japanese sneak attack and either damaged or sunk and subsequently refloated and repaired.

<text>Stans () is the capital of the canton of Nidwalden (Nidwald) in Switzerland.

The official language of Stans is German (spoken there in the variety of Swiss Standard German), but the main language is the local variant of Alemannic Swiss German.

==History==

Stans is one of the oldest settlements in the entire Nidwalden valley. The first traces of human settlement date to the second century BC. During the Roman era there is little evidence of a settlement except for some Gallo-Roman &quot;Ustrinum&quot; or funeral pyres and the Latin root (&quot;stagnum&quot; meaning a pool or sump) of the name Stans.

During the seventh or eighth century, the Alamanni settled in the region. The Christian Alamanni built the first church in Stans around 750 AD. This pre-Carolingian church served as the parish church for the entire Engelberg Valley. The church was expanded numerous times until it was finally replaced in 1647 by the new church of St. Peter and Paul.

Stans was first mentioned in 1124. By 1291, when Unterwalden joined Uri and Schwyz in what became the Swiss Confederation, Stans was already the capital of the section known as &quot;Unterwalden nid dem Kernwald&quot; which would become the half canton of Nidwalden.

In 1386, during the Battle of Sempach, a soldier from Stans, Arnold von Winkelried, is claimed to have thrown himself on the pikes of the Habsburg army which led the Swiss to victory. However it is doubtful whether he existed or died in the battle as the first mention of his selfless act appears over 150 years after the battle and a man who may have been Arnold was party to a lawsuit in 1389. Regardless, the legend is firmly in place in Stans, with a monument and his house located in the town.

Following the Swiss victories in the Burgundian Wars the Old Swiss Confederation was nearly torn apart by internal conflict when the city cantons insisted on having the lion&#x27;s share of the proceeds since they had supplied the most troops. The country cantons resented this and the &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; or leadership of each of the cantons met in Stans in 1481 to resolve the issues. However, they were unable to resolve the issues and war seemed inevitable. A local hermit, Niklaus von der Flüe, was consulted on the situation. He requested that a message be passed on to the members of the &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; on his behalf. The details of the message have remained unknown to this day, however it did calm the tempers and led to the drawing up of the &quot;Stanser Verkommnis&quot;. As part of the &quot;Verkommnis&quot; Fribourg and Solothurn were admitted into the confederation.

During the Middle Ages, Stans was protected with seven towers. However, the town never built a wall to connect the towers and encircle it. 
In 1713 two-thirds of the town was destroyed in a fire. Following the fire, new regulations kept the village square (&quot;Dorfplatz&quot;) open and clear of construction. The large, open square surrounded by baroque houses and the town council house (&quot;Rathaus&quot;) owe their appearance to the fire and subsequent reconstruction.
In 1798 Stans was stormed by French troops, following the decision of Nidwalden not to adopt the constitution of the Helvetic Republic. Children orphaned by this event were gathered by the educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi for his first school. He converted the Convent of St. Klara (built in 1621–1625) into a school for the children. However, he only had the school until the following year when the French Army needed the building and the orphan&#x27;s school came to a sudden end. In 1814, following the collapse of the Napoleonic Act of Mediation, Nidwalden attempted to return to the &quot;Ancien Regime&quot; government, with subject lands belonging to the canton. Stans and the rest of Nidwalden only gave up their subject lands when Federal troops marched into the city. Stans and the rest of Nidwalden joined the Sonderbund in 1845 and were involved in the 1847 Sonderbund War.

In the 20th century, modern technology and transportation changed Stans. In 1893 Stans was connected to the rail network of Lucerne by steam ferry. In 1964 the Lucerne-Stans-Engelberg rail way was opened and in 1966 the A2 motorway (which is Switzerland&#x27;s main north–south axis from Basel to Chiasso) was constructed.

The open-air assembly (&quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;) was held in Stans annually until its abolition in 1997.

===Stanserhorn===

The local mountain, the &quot;Stanserhorn&quot; () is also a tourist resort. It is accessible via one of the oldest mountain railways in Switzerland, the &quot;Stanserhornbahn&quot; (1893), and by cable car. The &quot;Stanserhornbahn&quot; was originally built as a rack and pinion railway, with three separate sections. In 1970 the upper section was destroyed by a fire following a lightning strike. In 1975 the destroyed upper section and the middle section were replaced by an aerial cable car. At the peak of the Stanserhorn is the &quot;Rondorama&quot;, a revolving restaurant that was built in 2001. From the peak of the Stanserhorn, on a clear day the view stretches nearly and includes 10 Swiss lakes and the Black Forest of Germany. There is a short hiking trail around the peak of the Stanserhorn and a small population of Marmots are kept near the trail. 
===&quot;Dorfplatz&quot;===
Following the fire in 1713, the village square (&quot;Dorfplatz&quot;) was fully rebuilt, to its current unified appearance, in 1715 according to a plan by Josef Aebi and Ludwig Gassmann. The square now houses the &quot;Winkelried&quot; fountain and the sculpture &quot;Der Tod und das Mädchen&quot; (Death and the Maiden). The &quot;Winkelried&quot; monument was carved from Carrarain marble in Rome and then shipped by boat, rail and horse team to Stans in 1865. The monument is in a Gothic Revival style and was carved by Ferdinand Schlöth. Death and the Maiden was done by Rudolf Brem.

===Parish church===
The Parish church, &quot;St. Peter und Paul&quot; was built from 1641 until 1647 by the architect Jakob Berger. The church was constructed in an early-Baroque style, while the bell tower is an older Romanesque structure. The three nave Basilica was built south of the earlier church, though the older bell tower dates from this previous church. The interior is decorated in white, gold and black. The simple interior ornamentation comes from Lombardy while there altar figures were done by Georg Allhelg. Next to the church is a two-story chapel and ossuary for the nearby Capuchin monastery.

===Capuchin monastery===

A Capuchin monastery was established in Stans in 1583 by Melchior Lussy, who had been sent to the Council of Trent. Initially there was resistance to the poverty, simple habits and beards of this order of Counter-Reformation monks. In 1777 the monks opened a Latin school, which was suppressed from 1798 until 1803 under the Helvetic Republic. The &quot;Kollegium St. Fidelis&quot; was built by the monks in 1895 and purchased by the canton in 1988. The monastery church was built in 1683 and renovated in 1980. In 1956 a memorial tablet to Melchoir Lussy was placed near the gate of the monastery.

===Convent St. Klara===

The Convent St. Klara was founded by Katharina and Maria Gut in 1618. The buildings were built from 1621 to 1625. In 1799 Heinrich Pestalozzi established his orphanage and school in the convent buildings. The convent church (built in 1723) is a simple structure with an ornate altar by Johann Ritz and a mystical altar painting by Johannes Brandenburg. The church was renovated in 1980. From the convent cemetery a path leads to the nearby Capuchin monastery.

===&quot;Winkelriedhaus&quot;===

A portion of the &quot;Winkelriedhaus&quot; (Winkelried House) was once home to the Winkelried family, though Arnold von Winkelried (if he existed) did not live in it. The oldest part of the structure dates from the middle of the 15th century. The early house was an unusually tall and large half timbered (, ) building, which was known throughout much of central Switzerland. However, it was not owned by the Winkelrieds for very long; in 1541 the Lussy family purchased the house. Under Melchior Lussy the Gothic building was renovated over a period of 50 years into a much larger, Renaissance mansion. In 1766 the Landammann (Chief Magistrate) Jost Remigi Trachsler bought the house. During much of the second half of the 18th century he had the &quot;Winkelriedhaus&quot; renovated and added a number of rococo frescos on the walls of the house. In 1815, the Kayser family bought the house, which they held until 1974 when it was given to the canton. It was restored from 1983 until 1991 and since then has been the home of the &quot;Museum für Kultur und Brauchtum&quot;.

===&quot;Salzmagazin&quot;===
The &quot;Salzmagazin&quot; (lit. Salt storage house) was originally built to store grain and salt for the community in 1700. It has had many other uses since then including; a theater, a secondary school and finally a museum. The coat of arms of the builder and Landammann Nicolaus Keiser as well as two lions with the Nidwalden shield and two-header eagle are visible on the north gable.

===&quot;Statue of Deschwanden&quot;===
In the front garden of the former Nidwaldner Kantonalbank is a monument by the Swiss sculptor August Stanser Blaesi (1903–1979) that was erected in memory of the local artist Melchior Paul von Deschwanden (1811–1881) in the autumn of 1933. Deschwanden was one of the most influential and productive religious painters of his time, trained in the Nazarene-style in Munich, Germany, who sent paintings to hang in Roman Catholic churches as far as Annapolis, Maryland and Covington, Kentucky. Amongst his pupils were Adalbert Baggenstos (1863–1897) from Stans, and the Swiss-born American portrait painter Adolfo Müller-Ury, in whose arms he died in February 1881.

<doc id="307091" wikidata="Q86446" url="?curid=307091" title="Ninoy Aquino International Airport">
<text>Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA ; ; ), also known as Manila International Airport (MIA), is the main international airport serving Metro Manila in the Philippines. Located between the cities of Pasay and Parañaque, about south of Manila proper and southwest of Makati, it is the main gateway for travelers to the Philippines and serves as a hub for PAL Express and Philippine Airlines. It is also the main operating base for AirSWIFT, Cebgo, Cebu Pacific, and Philippines AirAsia.

Manila International Airport was officially renamed for former Philippine senator Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino Jr., who was assassinated at the airport on August 21, 1983. NAIA is managed by the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), an agency of the Department of Transportation (DOTr). It is currently operated by the New NAIA Infrastructure Corporation (NNIC), a subsidiary of San Miguel Corporation.

Both NAIA and Clark International Airport in Clark Freeport Zone, Pampanga, serve the Greater Manila Area. Clark caters mainly to low-cost carriers because its landing fees have been lower ever since former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo called for Clark to replace NAIA as the Philippines&#x27; primary airport. NAIA is operating beyond its designed capacity of 35 million passengers, clogging air traffic and delaying flights. As a result, it has consistently been cited as one of the world&#x27;s worst airports. In response, a private consortium has been overseeing the airport&#x27;s operation and rehabilitation since September 14, 2024. Two nearby construction projects meant to reduce congestion at NAIA are also underway: one being the New Manila International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan and the other being to upgrade Sangley Point Airport in Cavite City into an international airport.

In 2023, NAIA served 45.3 million passengers, forty-seven percent more than the previous year, making it the busiest airport in the Philippines, the 15th busiest in Asia, and the 38th busiest in the world.

==History==

===Early history===
Manila&#x27;s original airport, Grace Park Airfield (also known as Manila North) in Grace Park, Caloocan (then a municipality of Rizal), opened in 1935. It was the city&#x27;s first commercial airport and was used by the Philippine Aerial Taxi Company (later Philippine Airlines) for its first domestic routes.

In July 1937, Nielson Airport, located in the land in Makati, also then in Rizal, was inaugurated and served as the gateway to Manila; its runways now form Ayala Avenue and Paseo de Roxas. Following World War II and Philippine independence, Grace Park Airfield closed, while Nielson Airport continued to operate until it was decommissioned in 1948.

=== Move to Nichols Field site ===
Airport operations were moved to the current site, Nichols Field, due to the flatter terrain, expanse of greenfield land, and the existing USAF base runway (Runway 13/31), which could be used for the airport. The original one-story bungalow terminal was built adjacent to the runway and serves as the present-day Terminal 4.

In 1954, the airport&#x27;s longer international runway (Runway 06/24) and associated taxiways were built, and in 1956, construction was started on a control tower and an international terminal building. The new terminal was designed by Federico Ilustre and was built on the current site of Terminal 2. It was inaugurated on September 22, 1961. On January 22, 1972, a fire caused substantial damage to the terminal, resulting in six casualties.

A slightly smaller terminal was built the following year. This second terminal would serve as the country&#x27;s international terminal until 1981 when it was converted to a domestic terminal, upon the completion and opening of Terminal 1, a new, higher-capacity terminal. Another fire damaged the old international terminal in May 1985.

===Assassination of Ninoy Aquino===

On August 21, 1983, oppositionist politician Ninoy Aquino attempted to return to the Philippines from exile in the United States, hoping to convince president Ferdinand Marcos to let go of political power after having held his position for nearly two decades. Aquino was assassinated mere moments after exiting his plane at Terminal 1&#x27;s Gate 8 (now Gate 11) after returning to the Philippines from exile in the United States. Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM) personnel escorted Aquino out of the plane to the tarmac, where an agency van awaited. A single gunshot killed him. Several shots were fired, killing alleged assassin, Rolando Galman. Seconds later, gunfire erupted, causing chaos in the plane, the tarmac, and the terminal.

The incident triggered constant protests for the next three years, and along with the crash of the Philippine economy earlier in 1983, is credited as one of the key events which led to the February 1986 People Power Revolution which removed Marcos from power.

===Renaming===
Four years after the incident, during the presidency of Ninoy&#x27;s widow Corazon Aquino in 1987, &quot;Republic Act No. 6639&quot; was enacted without executive approval, renaming the airport in Ninoy&#x27;s honor. Presently, a body mark of Aquino&#x27;s assassination is on display at the departures area, while the spot at Gate 8 where he was killed has a memorial plaque. Due to this event, Terminal 1 is nicknamed the &quot;Ninoy Aquino Terminal.&quot;

===Construction of Terminals 2 and 3===
Plans for a new terminal were conceived in 1989 when the Department of Transportation commissioned the French company Aéroports de Paris to conduct a feasibility study to expand capacity, which recommended to build two new terminals. Construction of Terminal 2, originally designed as a domestic terminal, began in 1995 and opened in 1999. It served as the hub of Philippine Airlines until 2023. Meanwhile, the larger Terminal 3, which was beset by construction delays and legal issues, opened in 2008 and became fully operational in 2014, serving Cebu Pacific and most international airlines.

=== Extortion scam ===
In October 2015, reports of an extortion scam concerning bullets planted by airport security officials in airline passengers&#x27; luggage (dubbed by the local media the &quot;tanim-bala&quot; [literally plant-bullet] scam) spread, creating a scare among travelers. Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, then a presumptive presidential candidate in the 2016 Philippine presidential election, further alleged that a syndicate was behind the incidents. He said the operation had continued for more than two years. Malacañang Palace and the Philippine Senate investigated the incidents. In April 2016, a similar incident occurred.

===Terminal reassignments===

In February 2018, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) proposed the rationalization of flights to decongest the terminals of NAIA. The original plan called for Terminals 1 and 3 exclusively handling international flights, while Terminals 2 and 4 would facilitate domestic flights. This revision would deviate from the practice where Terminals 2 and 3 operate both domestic and international flights, contributing to the congestion of both terminals. Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade and House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez supported the initiative, with the latter proposing that airlines relocate some of their flights to Clark International Airport. However, Senator Grace Poe, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Public Services, voiced concerns that a hasty implementation might exacerbate existing issues, with Poe suggesting capacity expansion instead. She further highlighted Terminal 2&#x27;s limited capacity of handling 9 million passengers compared to the current demand of over 16 million domestic passengers.

Despite initial plans for implementation in August 2018, the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) announced its deferment a month prior due to &quot;unforeseen operational constraints&quot;. The plan continued to be under review with no official implementation date set; however, some Philippine Airlines (PAL) flights to North America were relocated to Terminal 1 from Terminal 2 in July to accommodate the latter&#x27;s rehabilitation. By October, four international airlines transferred operations to Terminal 3, freeing up space for United States flight operations at Terminal 1. Subsequently, more airlines from Terminal 1 were scheduled to relocate to Terminal 3.

On December 1, 2022, the MIAA officially implemented the Schedule and Terminal Assignment Rationalization (STAR) program, when PAL began gradually transferring its international flights from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1. Likewise, Philippines AirAsia transferred its two busiest flights (Boracay–Caticlan and Cebu)—from Terminal 4 to Terminal 3, to ease congestion at the former by transferring forty percent of AirAsia&#x27;s daily passenger volume to the larger terminal. From April to June 2023, eight foreign airlines moved to Terminal 3 to make space for PAL&#x27;s international operations at T1. These changes were designed to offer international passengers at Terminals 1 and 3 a wider selection of food and retail outlets, and additional time for duty-free shopping. After PAL completed moving all its international flights to T1 on June 16, 2023, Philippines AirAsia and Royal Air Philippines began operating from Terminal 2 on July 1, thereby reverting the terminal to its original domestic design. While T2 is being expanded, Cebu Pacific&#x27;s domestic and international operations remained at Terminal 3. Meanwhile, flights of AirSWIFT, SkyJet Airlines, Cebgo, and Sunlight Air remained at Terminal 4.

Ahead of the airport&#x27;s privatization, the New NAIA Infrastructure Corporation—a consortium led by San Miguel Corporation—planned another set of terminal reassignments in August 2024, with an initial target implementation date before the Allhallowtide season. It then announced in September the planned reassignments: Terminal 1 would exclusively serve Philippine Airlines flights, while Terminal 2 would maintain its current status as an all-domestic terminal, and Terminal 3 would be fully dedicated to international flights of Cebu Pacific, the AirAsia Group, and all foreign airlines. This would require the remaining airlines operating at Terminal 1 to transfer to Terminal 3, and Philippines AirAsia to temporarily move its domestic flights back to Terminal 4 from Terminal 2 to accommodate Cebu Pacific&#x27;s domestic flights until the latter&#x27;s expansion is completed.

===Turboprop reassignments===
Ahead of NAIA&#x27;s privatization, in July 2024, the Philippine government reportedly planned to reassign turboprop flights in Manila to secondary airports. At the time, the government had no official policy for the transfer, but Transportation Undersecretary Timothy John Batan encouraged airlines to move its turboprop flights to Clark International Airport.

On December 3, 2024, the Manila Slot Coordination Committee (MSCC), a public-private regulatory committee which regulates NAIA&#x27;s slots, issued a resolution to direct airlines to completely transfer its turboprop flights out of Manila to secondary airports by October 2025. The rationalization aims to maximize the use of airport slots in Manila, which would exclusively be dedicated to jet aircraft. It would be implemented in three phases: with the MSCC requiring scheduled domestic carriers to transfer thirty percent of its turboprop flights by March 2025, followed by all such flights by October, and finally, airlines with a turboprop fleet fewer than five planes would follow suit by March 2026.

The transfer also aims to maximize Clark International Airport&#x27;s capacity, as it had been underserved since the opening of its expanded terminal in 2022, designed to handle eight million passengers annually. Cebgo, the turboprop subsidiary of Cebu Pacific, then announced the transfer of its Masbate and Siargao flights to Clark.

===Privatization and rehabilitation===

On February 12, 2018, a consortium of seven conglomerates consisting of Aboitiz InfraCapital, AC Infrastructure Holdings, Alliance Global, Asia&#x27;s Emerging Dragon, Filinvest Development Corporation, JG Summit Holdings, and Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (which later pulled out in March 2020) submitted a , or , 35-year unsolicited proposal to rehabilitate, expand, operate, and maintain the airport. The consortium&#x27;s proposal was divided into two phases: the improvement and expansion of terminals in the current NAIA land area and the development of an additional runway, taxiways, passenger terminals, and associated support infrastructure. Changi Airport Consultants Pte. Ltd., was to provide technical support. Singapore&#x27;s Changi Airport Group eyed a 30-percent stake in this venture.

On March 1, 2018, Megawide Construction Corporation and its India-based consortium partner GMR Infrastructure (the consortium which revamped Mactan–Cebu International Airport), submitted a ₱150 billion, or US$3 billion, proposal to decongest and redevelop the airport. GMR-Megawide did not propose a new runway, claiming that it would not significantly boost capacity.

On July 7, 2020, the NAIA consortium&#x27;s proposal was rejected by the government, allowing GMR-Megawide to take over the project. On December 15, however, the MIAA revoked the original proponent status (OPS) of GMR-Megawide, who then filed a motion for reconsideration. The MIAA denied the motion for reconsideration. In August 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) announced plans to rebid the public–private partnership project within the year.

Following a major airspace closure on January 1, 2023, plans to privatize the airport were pitched again. Secretary of Finance Benjamin Diokno supported such plans, but maintained that it should be &quot;thoroughly studied&quot;. On April 27, the Manila International Airport Consortium (MIAC), composed of six organizations (Alliance Global, AC Infrastructure Holdings Corp [under Ayala Corporation], Infracorp Development, Filinvest Development Corporation, and JG Summit Infrastructure Holdings) submitted a ₱100 billion 25-year unsolicited proposal to rehabilitate the airport. This proposal was subsequently rejected by the administration of President Bongbong Marcos on July 19, which opted to go through a solicited bidding instead.

The solicited concession agreement is set for fifteen years, with a ten-year extension if needed in case the opening of New Manila International Airport in Bulacan and Sangley Point Airport in Cavite would be delayed. The bidding opened on August 23, 2023. Four consortia submitted bids on the December 27 deadline: MIAC, Asian Airports Consortium (consisting of Lucio Co&#x27;s Cosco Capital, Inc.; Asian Infrastructure and Management Corp., Philippine Skylanders International, Inc., and PT Angkasa Pura II), GMR Airports Consortium, and SMC SAP &amp; Co. Consortium, a consortium led by San Miguel Corporation (SMC) and Incheon International Airport Corporation—the operator of Incheon International Airport in South Korea, with RMM Asian Logistics Inc. and RLW Aviation Development Inc. The Asian Airports Consortium was disqualified in the bidding after it was deemed non-compliant.

On February 16, 2024, the DOTr awarded the contract to SMC SAP &amp; Co. Consortium, later renamed as New NAIA Infrastructure Corporation (NNIC). the contract was signed on March 18, witnessed by President Marcos. NNIC offered the biggest revenue share with the government at 82.16 percent—more than double the proposed revenue shares of GMR Airports Consortium (33.30 percent) and MIAC (25.91 percent). The consortium also made the initial payment to the government. With the privatization, the national government is expected to earn , or annually. On September 14, 2024, the Manila International Airport Authority turned over the operations and maintenance of the airport to NNIC. While SMC is constructing New Manila International Airport (NMIA) in Bulacan, it decided to instead prioritize the rehabilitation of NAIA over the construction of the NMIA.

The turnover was followed by a series of airport fee hikes. On October 1, NNIC increased parking fees. The overnight parking fees, which quadrupled from 300 to 1,200 pesos, drew criticism from motorists; however, both NNIC and the DOTr defended the move, as it is designed to deter the misuse of parking slots. According to NNIC, previous parking rates were used by non-passengers, which contributed to congestion. Nevertheless, NNIC is developing a area near Terminal 3 for a 2,500-slot parking space. On the same day, it increased takeoff and landing fees, causing Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, and Philippines AirAsia to propose a &quot;terminal enhancement fee&quot; to cover the higher fees, pending approval of the Civil Aeronautics Board. Additionally, passenger service charges are expected to increase in September 2025 — the first increase since 2000.

==Structures and facilities==
===Terminals===
Ninoy Aquino International Airport has four passenger terminals, with plans to build another terminal.

====Terminal 1====

Covering , Terminal 1 of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport was designed to handle six million passengers annually. It is often referred to as the Ninoy Aquino Terminal, as it was the site of the former senator&#x27;s assassination in 1983. The terminal, opened in 1982, is the airport&#x27;s second oldest and exclusively handles international flights.

The development of the Manila International Airport, which includes Terminal 1, was approved by Executive Order No. 381 immediately after the former airport was destroyed by a fire a month earlier. The project&#x27;s feasibility study and master plan were conducted by the Airways Engineering Corporation in 1973, supported by a US$29.6 million loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The detailed engineering design was created by Renardet-Sauti/Transplan/F.F. Cruz Consultant, and the architectural design was developed by Leandro Locsin&#x27;s L.V. Locsin and Associates. In 1974, the designs were approved by the Philippine government and the ADB. Construction began in the second quarter of 1978 on a site close to the original Manila Airport, within the jurisdiction of Parañaque, then a municipality of Metro Manila.
By 1991, Terminal 1 reached its capacity with a total passenger volume of 4.53 million. From that year, the terminal has been over capacity, recording an annual average growth rate of 11%. To accommodate this, improvements have been made, increasing its capacity to six million passengers. In the same year, an extension arrival area was constructed at the ground level to decongest the terminal&#x27;s original arrivals area. The main arrivals curbside was later designated for VIPs and passengers with special requests until 2025, where it was reopened to all passengers.

From 2011 to 2013, Terminal 1 was ranked among the worst airports in Asia by the travel website &quot;The Guide to Sleeping In Airports&quot;. As a result, plans were developed to rehabilitate the terminal, including expanding the arrival area, adding parking spaces, and enhancing facilities. Renovations began on January 23, 2014. Part of the project involved the installation of buckling restrained braces to enhance the building&#x27;s structural integrity.

Terminal 1 once served almost all foreign-based carriers (except All Nippon Airways). After the full completion of the larger Terminal 3 in 2014, eighteen airlines moved to the larger terminal to decongest Terminal 1. Since June 16, 2023, flag carrier Philippine Airlines uses Terminal 1 as its international hub. Low-cost carrier Royal Air Philippines also uses the terminal for its international flights. Other airlines operating at Terminal 1 include Air China, Air Niugini, Asiana Airlines, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, EVA Air, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Kuwait Airways, Malaysia Airlines, Oman Air, Royal Brunei Airlines, Saudia, Shenzhen Airlines, Vietnam Airlines, XiamenAir, and Zipair Tokyo.

====Terminal 2====

Terminal 2, situated at the end of the old MIA Road (now NAIA Road), covers an area of . Construction began in December 1995, and the terminal started operating in 1999. It received the name Centennial Terminal in commemoration of the centennial year of Philippine independence. French company Aéroports de Paris (ADP) initially designed the terminal for domestic use, but later modified the design to accommodate international flights. With 12 jet bridges, the terminal can accommodate 2.5 million passengers per year in its north wing and five million in its south wing, for a total of 7.5 million passengers per year. After its conversion to a domestic terminal in 2023, its capacity was increased to ten million.
The French government funded a study that led to the terminal&#x27;s construction and submitted the review to the Philippine government in 1990. In 1991, the French government provided a 30-million-franc soft loan to the Philippine government to fund the detailed architectural and engineering design. ADP finished the design in 1992. The Japanese government followed suit in 1994, providing an soft loan to the Philippine government to finance 75% of the construction costs and the entirety of the supervision costs. The construction of the terminal officially began on December 11, 1995, and the Philippine government took over the completed terminal on December 28, 1998. The terminal became fully operational in 1999.

In August 2014, authorities announced a plan to expand Terminal 2, incorporating a structure to interconnect Terminals 1 and 2. In order to do so, the plan called for demolishing the adjacent unused Philippine Village Hotel complex and relocating a fuel depot, as well as the international cargo complex. Rehabilitation of the terminal began in September 2018, and by February 16, 2021, the partially expanded Terminal 2 was inaugurated, adding to the terminal area. However, Terminal 2 has not been interconnected with Terminal 1 yet, nor have the adjacent complexes been demolished. In 2024, the New NAIA Infrastructure Corporation (NNIC) announced that it will interconnect the two terminals after demolishing the hotel and relocating the fuel farm and the cargo terminal as part of its rehabilitation plan. This plan will increase the terminal&#x27;s capacity by about 23 million passengers.

From 1999 to 2023, flag carrier Philippine Airlines and its domestic subsidiary PAL Express exclusively used Terminal 2. It facilitated both domestic and international flights for these airlines, notwithstanding the operation of select PAL Express flights from Terminal 3 from 2012 to 2018. On June 16, 2023, PAL moved its international flights to Terminal 1, leaving its domestic flights at Terminal 2. This allowed the entry of low-cost carriers and former Terminal 4 users Philippines AirAsia and Royal Air Philippines on July 1, thereby converting T2 to exclusively serve domestic flights.

====Terminal 3====
Terminal 3, the newest and largest terminal, covers and extends , occupying a site on Villamor Air Base. With construction beginning in 1997, the terminal partially opened on July 22, 2008, increasing the airport&#x27;s capacity by 13 million passengers. The terminal&#x27;s development, part of the 1989 expansion plan, commenced in 1997 but was beleaguered by legal battles, red tape, and arbitration cases in the United States and Singapore, as well as technical and safety issues including repeated incidents of collapsed ceilings that led to repeated delays. Japan-based Takenaka Corporation undertook the terminal&#x27;s rehabilitation, and it became fully operational on July 31, 2014.

The construction of a third terminal was proposed by Asia&#x27;s Emerging Dragon Corporation (AEDP). AEDP eventually lost the bid to PairCargo and its partner Fraport AG of Germany. Originally scheduled to open in 2002, a contract dispute between the government of the Philippines and the project&#x27;s main contractor, Philippine International Air Terminals Co. Inc. (Piatco), delayed its completion. While the original agreement allowed PairCargo and Fraport AG to operate the airport for several years after its construction, followed by a government handover, the government offered to buy out Fraport AG for US$400 million, to which Fraport agreed. However, before the terminal could be completed, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo called the contract &quot;onerous&quot; and formed a committee to evaluate the buyout agreement. The contracts were declared null and void by the Supreme Court in May 2003, the Philippine government took over the terminal in December 2004. Piatco sued the Philippine government before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), while Fraport separately sued the government at the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID decided in August 2007 in favor of the government, while in January 2012, the ICC case became final and executory in favor of the government. 

Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) designed the US$640 million terminal, which has 20 jet bridges and four remote gates served by apron buses. The terminal&#x27;s apron area spans and can service up to 32 aircraft simultaneously. It has the capacity to serve 33,000 passengers per day or 6,000 per hour. Since April 2017, a long indoor footbridge called Runway Manila has been connecting the terminal to Newport City.

Low-cost carrier Cebu Pacific was the first to operate at Terminal 3 on July 22, 2008. PAL Express (then Air Philippines and Airphil Express) followed suit, and used it until 2018. The first foreign carrier to operate out of Terminal 3 was All Nippon Airways on February 27, 2011. From August to October 2014, Delta Air Lines (later terminated in 2021), KLM, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, and Cathay Pacific moved to Terminal 3. Between 2018 and 2020, United Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, and Etihad Airways followed suit, as did Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Japan, Scoot, China Southern Airlines, Starlux Airlines (later terminated in March 2024), Jeju Air, Ethiopian Airlines, Thai Airways International, and Gulf Air in 2023. Other operators at Terminal 3 include new entrants Aero K, Air France, Greater Bay Airlines, and HK Express. Terminal 3 has also been used by the AirAsia Group for its international flights since September 15, 2014.

====Terminal 4====


Constructed in 1948, Terminal 4, also known as the Manila Domestic Passenger Terminal or the Old Domestic Terminal, is the first and original structure of the airport, as well as its oldest and smallest terminal. Positioned on the old Airport Road, the Domestic Terminal is located near the north end of Runway 13/31.

Philippines AirAsia was a primary user of Terminal 4 from 2013 to 2023. In December 2022, to decongest the terminal, it transferred its two busiest flights—to Cebu and Boracay (Caticlan)—to Terminal 3, while all other domestic flights remained at T4. It continued to operate under this scheme until all flights were transferred to Terminal 2 on July 1, 2023. However, Philippines AirAsia is reportedly moving back to Terminal 4 on March 1, 2025, as part of long-term terminal reassignments conducted by the NNIC.

Since then, T4 has been specifically assigned for turboprop aircraft, functioning exclusively with ground-loaded gates. This terminal, which accommodates up to three million passengers annually, primarily hosts domestic flights by regional airlines such as AirSWIFT, SkyJet Airlines, Cebgo, and Sunlight Air.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the airport authority closed Terminal 4 to minimize operating costs, while the remaining three terminals resumed operations in June 2020 upon the lifting of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon. During its temporary closure, the terminal was utilized as a vaccination site for airport employees. As such, AirAsia temporarily transferred its domestic operations to Terminal 3. After a two-year hiatus, Terminal 4 reopened on March 28, 2022.

Under NNIC&#x27;s management, Terminal 4 temporarily closed on November 6, 2024, to give way for major renovations until February 2025. As such, AirSWIFT, Cebgo, and Sunlight Air relocated to Terminal 2.

===Runways===

NAIA&#x27;s primary runway is long and wide, running at a true bearing of 060.3°/240.3° (designated as Runway 06/24). Its secondary runway is long and wide, running at 134.8°/314.8° (designated as Runway 13/31). The primary runway was oriented at 06/24 to harness the southeast and southwest winds. Of the 550 daily flights, 100 take the secondary runway. It mainly caters to private planes and narrowbody aircraft such as the ATR 72-500, Airbus A320, and Airbus A321, and acts as the main runway of the NAIA Terminal 4.

Runway 13/31 closed in 2020 for rehabilitation. The runway was reopened on February 16, 2021, along with a newly constructed taxiway.

====Third runway plan====
In 2014, Transportation and Communications Secretary Joseph Abaya proposed a new runway adjacent to the existing Runway 06/24. The proposed runway has a length of that could allow the landing of an Airbus A320 and increase capacity from 40 planes per hour to 60–70. A Dutch consultant hired by the government also suggested to build another terminal to cause less disruptions to the general public.

Previously, the Japan International Cooperation Agency proposed Sangley Point in Cavite as the site of an international airport serving the Greater Manila Area, meaning Sangley could serve as NAIA&#x27;s third runway.

===NAIA road===

The NAIA Road (Ninoy Aquino International Airport Road), formerly known and still commonly referred to as the MIA Road (Manila International Airport Road), is a short 8-10 lane divided highway connecting Roxas Boulevard and the Manila–Cavite Expressway (R-1) with NAIA. It is also a major local road that links the cities of Pasay and Parañaque running approximately underneath the elevated NAIA Expressway from R-1 in Tambo, Parañaque to NAIA Terminal 2 in Pasay. En route, it intersects, from west to east, Quirino Avenue, Domestic Road, and Ninoy Aquino Avenue. The road ends at the entrance of NAIA Terminal 2.

The road also houses a small strip of shops across from the former Coastal Mall, Tambo Elementary School at Quirino Avenue, Park &#x27;N Fly at Domestic Road, and the old Nayong Pilipino (site of the future NAIA Terminal 5) close to Terminal 2. The old NAIA Terminal 1 is accessible by turning south at Ninoy Aquino Avenue, which also leads to the Duty Free FiestaMall and continues on to Sucat as Dr. Santos Avenue. The new Terminal 3, on the other hand, is located on Andrews Avenue which can be accessed from Domestic Road. The road was originally named as MIA Road and was only renamed in 1987 when the airport was renamed in honor of the late Senator Ninoy Aquino, who was assassinated there in 1983.

===Maintenance===

Lufthansa Technik Philippines (LTP) (formerly PAL Technical Center) was founded in 2000 as a joint venture of German firm Lufthansa Technik (51%) and Philippine aviation service provider MacroAsia Corporation (49%). Lufthansa Technik Philippines offers customers aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services.

The company performs maintenance checks for the Airbus A320 family and A330/A340 aircraft. Seven hangar bays and workshops provide industry standard maintenance, major modifications, cabin reconfigurations, engine maintenance, and painting for the A320 family, A330/A340, as well as the Boeing 747-400 and 777 aircraft. A new widebody hangar was recently added to meet the increasing demand for A330/A340 maintenance.

The company also opened an Airbus A380 maintenance hangar to allow the aircraft to be repaired at the airport facility. It also provides technical and engineering support for the entire Philippine Airlines fleet and other international airline fleets.

Aviation Partnership (Philippines) Corporation is Cebu Pacific third-line maintenance. It was a former joint venture of SIA Engineering Company (51%) and Cebu Pacific Air (49%) until November 2020 when Cebu Pacific decide to take 100% ownership of the company. It provides line maintenance, light aircraft checks, technical ramp handling, and other services to Cebu Pacific Air and third-party airline customers.

=== Training ===
Philippine Airlines (PAL) operates the PAL Learning Center within the airport&#x27;s premises. The center includes training facilities for pilots and cabin crew, catering services, a data center, and an Airbus A320 flight simulator.

=== DHL ===
The airport is a gateway facility for DHL. On March 12, 2006, the company opened its first quality control center.

==Renaming proposals==
Repeated efforts to rename the airport have not succeeded. In May 2018, then lawyer Larry Gadon led an online petition at change.org aiming to restore the original name of the airport, &quot;Manila International Airport&quot; (MIA). Gadon said the renaming of MIA to NAIA in 1987 was &quot;well in advance of the 10-year prescription period for naming public sites after dead personalities&quot;.

In June 2020, House Deputy Speaker Paolo Duterte, citing the need of the airport to represent the Filipino people, filed a bill seeking to rename the airport to &quot;Paliparang Pandaigdig ng Pilipinas&quot; (). The bill was coauthored by Marinduque Representative Lord Allan Velasco and ACT-CIS Representative Eric Go Yap.

In August 2020, Gadon filed a petition before the Supreme Court questioning the validity of Republic Act No. 6639, the law that named it NAIA. Gadon asserted that Aquino was not among the &quot;pantheon&quot; of the country&#x27;s declared official heroes. A month later, the Supreme Court unanimously denied the petition to nullify the law for lack of merit.

In April 2022, Duterte Youth Representative Ducielle Cardema filed a bill returning the airport to its original name, claiming the name should not have been &quot;politicized in the first place&quot;. Cardema had the bill refiled in July 2022.

In June 2022, Negros Oriental 3rd district Representative Arnolfo Teves Jr. filed a bill renaming the airport to &quot;Ferdinand E. Marcos International Airport&quot; after former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., who authorized the airport&#x27;s rehabilitation and development through an executive order in 1972. Teves stressed that it is &quot;more appropriate to rename it to the person who has contributed to the idea and execution of the said noble project&quot;. The bill drew criticism from former senator Franklin Drilon, who said that the renaming would entail historical revisionism.

In February 2024, Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista said that renaming the airport was not included in the privatization proposals of the San Miguel Corporation-SAP and Company Consortium, which won the bid to operate and maintain the airport.

== Accidents and incidents ==

<doc id="307099" wikidata="Q1060160" url="?curid=307099" title="Lineman (gridiron football)">
<text>In gridiron football, a lineman is a player who specializes in play at the line of scrimmage. The linemen of the team currently in possession of the ball are the offensive line, while linemen on the opposing team are the defensive line. A number of NFL rules specifically address restrictions and requirements for the offensive line, whose job is to help protect the quarterback from getting sacked for a loss, or worse, fumbling. The defensive line is covered by the same rules that apply to all defensive players. Linemen are usually the largest players on the field in both height and weight, since their positions usually require less running and more strength than skill positions.

==Offensive line==
The offensive line consists of the center, who is responsible for snapping the ball into play, two guards who flank the center, and two offensive tackles flanking these guards. In addition, a full offensive line may also include a tight end outside one or both of the tackles.

An offensive lineman&#x27;s motion during a play is often limited to just a few quick steps (typically from a three-point stance) to establish position, followed by a wrestling match similar to sumo. Offensive linemen thus tend to be the largest and strongest players on the field with excellent agility and balance, but limited straight-line running speed and stamina.

On some running plays, an offensive lineman will &quot;pull&quot; by backing out of his initial position and running behind the other offensive linemen to engage a defensive player beyond the initial width of the offensive line; in modern games this duty usually falls to guards.

When an offensive lineman knocks a player down on a block, leaving the defensive player lying flat on his back, it is known as a pancake block.

When an offensive line has an equal number of men on either side of the center, it is known as a &quot;balanced line&quot;. The &quot;interior offensive line&quot; consists of the center and guards.

Besides the initial snap from center, offensive linemen are not eligible to handle the ball- with the exception of recovering fumbles- and are not allowed to advance more than two yards past the line of scrimmage at the time a pass is thrown, whether they are engaged with a defensive player or not.

===Run===
On running plays, the primary job of the offensive line is to create space for the ball carrier to run, either by pushing all defensive players backwards past the line of scrimmage, or by pushing defensive players to the side to allow the ball carrier to run past them.

===Pass===
On passing plays, the offensive line is tasked with stopping defensive players from tackling the quarterback before he has thrown the ball. Stopping these players indefinitely is practically not possible, so the main objective of the offensive line is to slow them down, providing the quarterback with enough time to identify an open, eligible receiver and throw him the ball.

==Defensive line==
The defensive line consists of one or two defensive tackles and two defensive ends who play outside the defensive tackles. The defensive line works with the linebackers to try to control the line of scrimmage. The 4-3 defense, most commonly used in the NFL, employs two defensive tackles (and a defensive line of four men, with three linebackers behind them), while the 3-4 defense uses just a single defensive tackle, called the nose tackle (and a defensive line of three men, with four linebackers behind them). Defensive ends in a typical 3-4 have responsibilities more similar to a 4-3 defensive tackle than 4-3 defensive ends.

On running plays, the goal is to tackle the ball carrier. The defensive line attempts to maintain their original formation (even spacing without holes), but also to prevent any members of the opposing offensive line from successfully engaging the linebackers, who chase down the ball carrier. The defensive tackles are usually the most skilled run defenders on the team.

On passing plays, the defensive line tries to reach the quarterback. Ideally, the defensive players are able to tackle the quarterback for a loss (a sack), but in practice the quarterback will usually manage to throw the ball before an actual tackle is made; the goal is thus to put pressure on the quarterback as quickly as possible to force him to throw the ball before he can find an open receiver. Defensive ends are usually the most skilled pass rushers on the team. In order to increase the pressure on the quarterback, teams will often have players other than the defensive line attempt to sack the quarterback; this is called a blitz.

Because the defense does not know whether the offense is attempting a passing play or a running play (or whether a quarterback will give up on an attempt to pass and instead run with the ball), they must balance passing and running strategies: running around offensive linemen and avoiding contact may allow faster pressure on a quarterback, but it also leaves a hole in the defensive line and frees an offensive lineman to engage a linebacker, enabling a big running play.

Defensive linemen, particularly defensive ends are typically lighter and faster than defensive tackles and offensive linemen. Defensive tackles weight averages between 260 and 310 lbs.

<text>Karl Friedrich Schinkel (13 March 1781 – 9 October 1841) was a Prussian architect, city planner and painter who also designed furniture and stage sets. Schinkel was one of the most prominent architects of Germany and designed both Neoclassical and neo-Gothic buildings. His most famous buildings are found in and around Berlin. Schinkel´s Bauakademie is considered one of the forerunners of modern architecture.

==Biography==

Schinkel was born in Neuruppin, Margraviate of Brandenburg. When he was six, his father died in the disastrous Neuruppin fire of 1787. He became a student of architect Friedrich Gilly (1772–1800) (the two became close friends) and his father, David Gilly, in Berlin. At that time, the architectural taste in Prussia was shaped in Neoclassical style, mainly by Carl Gotthard Langhans, the architect of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

After returning to Berlin from his first trip to Italy in 1805, he started to earn his living as a painter. When he saw Caspar David Friedrich&#x27;s painting &quot;Wanderer above the Sea of Fog&quot; at the 1810 Berlin art exhibition he decided that he would never reach such mastery of painting and turned to architecture. Working for the stage, in 1816 he created a star-spangled backdrop for the appearance of the &quot;Königin der Nacht&quot; in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, which is even quoted in modern productions of this perennial piece. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, Schinkel oversaw the Prussian Building Commission. In this position, he was not only responsible for reshaping the still relatively unspectacular city of Berlin into a representative capital for Prussia, but also oversaw projects in the expanded Prussian territories from the Rhineland in the west to Königsberg in the east, such as New Altstadt Church.

From 1808 to 1817 Schinkel renovated and reconstructed Schloss Rosenau, Coburg, in the Gothic Revival style. He also rebuilt the ruins of Chorin Abbey.

At age 60, on 9 October 1841, Schinkel died in Berlin, Province of Brandenburg.

==Commemoration==
His portrait appeared on the banknote issued by the Reichsbank from 1936 until 1945. Printing ceased in 1945 but the note remained in circulation until the issue of the Deutsche Mark on 21 June 1948.

==Style==

Schinkel&#x27;s style, in his most productive period, is defined by a turn to Greek rather than Imperial Roman architecture, an attempt to turn away from the style that was linked to the recent French occupiers. (Thus, he is a noted proponent of the Greek Revival.) He believed that in order to avoid sterility and have a soul, a building must contain elements of the poetic and the past, and have a discourse with them.

His most famous extant buildings are found in and around Berlin. These include the Neue Wache (1816–1818), the National Monument for the Liberation Wars (1818–1821), the Schauspielhaus (1819–1821) at the Gendarmenmarkt, which replaced the earlier theatre that was destroyed by fire in 1817, and the Altes Museum on Museum Island (1823–1830). He also carried out improvements to the Crown Prince&#x27;s Palace and to Schloss Charlottenburg. Schinkel was also responsible for the interior decoration of a number of private Berlin residences. Although the buildings themselves have long been destroyed, portions of a stairwell from the Weydinger House were able to be rescued and built into the Nicolaihaus on Brüderstr. and its formal dining hall into the Palais am Festungsgraben.

Schinkel was extensively patronised by the Prussian royal family, producing designs for Stolzenfels Castle and completing Charlottenhof Palace for King Frederick William IV and for his brothers, Babelsberg Palace and Glienicke Palace.

Between 1825 and 1827, he collaborated with Carl Theodor Ottmer on designs for the Berliner Singakademie for Sing-Akademie zu Berlin. Since 1952, it has been known as the Maxim Gorki Theatre.

Later, Schinkel moved away from classicism altogether, embracing the Neo-Gothic in his Friedrichswerder Church (1824–1831). Schinkel&#x27;s Bauakademie (1832–1836), his most innovative building, eschewed historicist conventions and seemed to point the way to a clean-lined &quot;modernist&quot; architecture that would become prominent in Germany only toward the beginning of the 20th century.

Schinkel, however, is noted as much for his theoretical work and his architectural drafts as for the relatively few buildings that were actually executed to his designs. Some of his merits are best shown in his unexecuted plans for the transformation of the Athenian Acropolis into a royal palace for the new Kingdom of Greece and for the erection of the Orianda Palace in the Crimea. These and other designs may be studied in his &quot;Sammlung architektonischer Entwürfe&quot; (1820–1837) and his &quot;Werke der höheren Baukunst&quot; (1840–1842; 1845–1846). He also designed the famed Iron Cross medal of Prussia and later Germany.
It has been speculated, however, that due to the difficult political circumstances – French occupation and the dependency on the Prussian king – and his relatively early death, which prevented him from seeing the explosive German industrialization in the second half of the 19th century, he was not able to live up to the true potential exhibited by his sketches.
