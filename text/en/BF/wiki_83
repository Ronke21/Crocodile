<text>Peter William Sutcliffe (2June 1946 – 13November 2020), also known as Peter Coonan, was an English serial killer who was convicted of murdering thirteen women and attempting to murder seven others between 1975 and 1980. He was dubbed in press reports as the Yorkshire Ripper, an allusion to the Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper. Sutcliffe was sentenced to twenty concurrent sentences of life imprisonment, which were converted to a whole life order in 2010. Two of his murders took place in Manchester; all the others took place in West Yorkshire. Criminal psychologist David Holmes characterised Sutcliffe as being an &quot;extremely callous, sexually sadistic serial killer.&quot;

Sutcliffe initially attacked women and girls in residential areas, but appears to have shifted his focus to red-light districts because he was attracted by the vulnerability of prostitutes and the perceived ambivalent attitude of police to prostitutes&#x27; safety. After his arrest in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police for driving with false number plates in January 1981, he was transferred to the custody of West Yorkshire Police, who questioned him about the killings. Sutcliffe confessed to being the perpetrator, saying that the voice of God had sent him on a mission to kill prostitutes. At his trial he pleaded not guilty to murder on grounds of diminished responsibility, but was convicted of murder on a majority verdict. Following his conviction, Sutcliffe began using his mother&#x27;s maiden name of Coonan.

The search for Sutcliffe was one of the largest and most expensive manhunts in British history. West Yorkshire Police faced heavy and sustained criticism for their failure to catch Sutcliffe despite having interviewed him nine times in the course of their five-year investigation. Owing to the sensational nature of the case, investigators handled an exceptional amount of information, some of it misleading including hoax correspondence purporting to be from the &quot;Ripper.&quot; Following Sutcliffe&#x27;s conviction, the government ordered a review of the Ripper investigation, conducted by the Inspector of Constabulary Lawrence Byford, known as the &quot;Byford Report.&quot; The findings were made fully public in 2006, and confirmed the validity of the criticism of the force. The report led to changes to investigative procedures that were adopted across British police forces. Since his conviction, Sutcliffe has been linked to a number of other unsolved crimes.

Sutcliffe was transferred from prison to Broadmoor Hospital in March 1984 after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. The High Court dismissed an appeal by Sutcliffe in 2010, confirming that he would serve a whole life order and never be released from custody. In August 2016, it was ruled that Sutcliffe was mentally fit to be returned to prison, and he was transferred that month to HM Prison Frankland. Sutcliffe died in hospital from diabetes-related complications while in prison custody in 2020.

==Early life==
Peter William Sutcliffe was born in Shipley, West Riding of Yorkshire, on 2June 1946, to a working-class family who lived in Bingley. His parents were John William Sutcliffe (1922–2004) and his Irish wife, Kathleen Frances Coonan (1919–1978), a native of Connemara. Sutcliffe&#x27;s mother was Catholic while his father was a member of the choir at the local Anglican church of St Wilfred&#x27;s; their children were raised in their mother&#x27;s Catholic faith, and Sutcliffe briefly served as an altar boy. Sutcliffe&#x27;s mother was the victim of domestic abuse by his father, making it likely she struggled through her pregnancy under great emotional stress. Sutcliffe was born prematurely, having to spend two weeks in hospital.

Sutcliffe&#x27;s father was a heavy drinker who once smashed a beer glass over Sutcliffe&#x27;s head for sitting in his chair at Christmas dinner. He also hated Sutcliffe&#x27;s mother: &quot;She was a bitch and the least said about her, the better.&quot; Sutcliffe&#x27;s father would frequently dismiss his slightly built son as &quot;a wimp, always hanging from his mother&#x27;s apron, a mummy&#x27;s boy.&quot; Sutcliffe&#x27;s mother often lavished attention on her son and was to become seen by Sutcliffe as &quot;perfect.&quot; Sutcliffe&#x27;s father habitually whipped his children with a belt as a form of punishment. Sutcliffe&#x27;s siblings later described their father as &quot;a monster&quot; and, according to Sutcliffe&#x27;s younger brother, &quot;The atmosphere in our house would change as soon as he [John] walked in. His life revolved around playing football, cricket, singing in a choir—and womanising.&quot;

In 1970, Sutcliffe&#x27;s father posed as his wife&#x27;s lover in order to lure her to a local hotel, taking along Sutcliffe and two of his siblings to witness him expose her infidelity. When Sutcliffe&#x27;s mother arrived, his father pulled out a negligee from her purse as her children watched. In his late-adolescence, Sutcliffe developed a growing obsession with voyeurism and spent much time spying on prostitutes and their male clients. Reportedly a loner, he left school at the age of 15 and had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a gravedigger at Bingley Cemetery in the 1960s. Because of this occupation, Sutcliffe developed a macabre sense of co-workers reported that Sutcliffe enjoyed his work too much and would even volunteer to do overtime washing corpses. Between November 1971 and April 1973, Sutcliffe worked at the Baird Television factory on a packaging line. He left this position when he was asked to go on the road as a salesman.

After leaving Baird Television, Sutcliffe worked night shifts at the Britannia Works of Anderton International from April 1973. In February 1975, he took redundancy and used half of the £400 pay-off to train as a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driver. On 5March 1976, Sutcliffe was dismissed from this employment for the theft of used tyres. He was unemployed until October 1976, when he found a job as an HGV driver for T. &amp; W.H. Clark Holdings Ltd. on the Canal Road Industrial Estate in Bradford. 

Sutcliffe reportedly hired prostitutes as a young man, and it has been speculated that he had a bad experience during which he was conned out of money by a prostitute and her pimp. Other analyses of Sutcliffe&#x27;s actions have not found evidence that he actually sought the services of prostitutes but note that he nonetheless developed an obsession with them, including &quot;watching them soliciting on the streets of Leeds and Bradford.&quot;

On 14 February 1967, Sutcliffe met 16-year-old Sonia Szurma, the daughter of Ukrainian and Polish refugees from Czechoslovakia, at the Royal Standard pub on Manningham Lane in Bradford&#x27;s red-light district; they married on 10August 1974. Sonia was studying to become a teacher when she was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Her relationship with Sutcliffe was later characterised by the writer Gordon Burn as domineering, with Sonia willing to slap down her husband &quot;like a naughty schoolboy,&quot; while Sutcliffe even had to occasionally &quot;contain her physically by pinning her arms to her side&quot; during her common &quot;unprovoked outbursts of rage.&quot; Barbara Jones, a journalist who had many conversations with Sonia, described her as &quot;the most irritating, strangest and coldest person I&#x27;ve ever met. She&#x27;s so incredibly prickly and demanding.&quot; 

Sonia had several miscarriages after marrying Sutcliffe, and the couple were informed that she would not be able to have children. Sonia eventually resumed her teacher training course, during which time she had an affair with an ice-cream van driver. When she completed the course in 1977 and began teaching, she and Sutcliffe used her salary to buy a house at 6 Garden Lane in Heaton, into which they moved on 26September 1977, and where they were living at the time of Sutcliffe&#x27;s arrest in 1980.

==Attacks and murders==
===1969===
Sutcliffe&#x27;s first documented assault was of a female prostitute, who he had met while searching for another woman who had tricked him out of money. Sutcliffe left his friend Trevor Birdsall&#x27;s minivan and walked up St. Paul&#x27;s Road in Bradford until he was out of sight. When he returned, Sutcliffe was out of breath, as if he had been running; he told Birdsall to drive off quickly. Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock. Police visited Sutcliffe&#x27;s home the next day, as the woman he had attacked had noted Birdsall&#x27;s vehicle registration plate. Sutcliffe admitted he had hit her, but claimed it was with his hand. Officers told Sutcliffe he was &quot;very lucky,&quot; as the woman did not want to press charges.

===1975===
Sutcliffe committed his second assault in Keighley on the night of 5July 1975. He attacked 36-year-old Anna Rogulskyj, who was walking alone, striking her unconscious with a hammer and slashing her stomach with a knife. Disturbed by a neighbour, Sutcliffe left the scene without killing her. Rogulskyj survived after brain surgery but was psychologically traumatised by the attack. She later said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been afraid to go out much because I feel people are staring and pointing at me. The whole thing is making my life a misery. I sometimes wish I had died in the attack.&quot;

On the night of 15August, Sutcliffe attacked 46-year-old Olive Smelt in Halifax. Employing the same &quot;modus operandi&quot;, he briefly engaged Smelt with a commonplace pleasantry about the weather before striking hammer blows to her skull from behind. He then disarranged Smelt&#x27;s clothing and slashed her lower back with a knife. Again Sutcliffe was interrupted and left his victim badly injured but alive. Like Rogulskyj, Smelt subsequently suffered severe emotional and mental trauma. She later told Detective Superintendent Dick Holland that her attacker had a Yorkshire accent, but this information was ignored, as was the fact that neither she nor Rogulskyj were in towns with a red-light area.

On 27August, Sutcliffe targeted 14-year-old Tracy Browne in Silsden, attacking her from behind and hitting her on the head five times while she was walking along a country lane. He ran off when he saw the lights of a passing car, leaving his victim requiring brain surgery. Sutcliffe was not convicted of the attack but confessed in 1992. Browne later said that she had been charmed by Sutcliffe at first: &quot;We had walked together for almost a mile – for about 30 minutes and I never once felt intimidated or in danger.&quot;

The first victim Sutcliffe killed was 28-year-old Wilma Mary McCann, a mother of four from Scott Hall, on 30October. McCann was last seen alive at 7:30 p.m. when she left her council house on Scott Hall Avenue, in the Chapeltown area of Leeds, walking past the nearby Prince Philip Playing Fields. Like with the earlier attacks, Sutcliffe approached her from behind and struck the back of her skull twice with a hammer. An extensive inquiry, involving 150 officers of the West Yorkshire Police and 11,000 interviews, failed to identify Sutcliffe.

===1976===
Sutcliffe committed his next murder in Leeds on 20January 1976, when he stabbed 42-year-old Emily Monica Jackson fifty-two times. In dire financial straits, Jackson had been persuaded by her husband to engage in prostitution, using the van of their family roofing business. Sutcliffe picked up Jackson, who was soliciting outside the Gaiety pub on Roundhay Road, then drove about half a mile to some derelict buildings on Enfield Terrace in the Manor Industrial Estate. Sutcliffe hit Jackson on the head with a hammer, dragged her body into a rubbish-strewn yard, then used a sharpened screwdriver to stab her in the neck, chest and abdomen. He stamped on her thigh, leaving behind an impression of his boot.

Sutcliffe attacked 20-year-old Marcella Claxton in Roundhay Park on 9May. Walking home from a party, Claxton accepted an offer of a lift from Sutcliffe. When she got out of the car to urinate, he hit her from behind with a hammer. Claxton survived and testified against Sutcliffe at his trial. At the time of this attack, Claxton had been four months pregnant and subsequently miscarried her baby. She required multiple, extensive brain operations and suffered from intermittent blackouts and chronic depression.

===1977===
On 5February, Sutcliffe attacked 28-year-old Irene Richardson, a Chapeltown prostitute, in Roundhay Park. Richardson was last seen at 11:15 p.m. leaving a rooming house on Cowper Street, saying she was going to Tiffany&#x27;s, a pub and disco in the centre of Leeds. Richardson was bludgeoned to death with a hammer, and stabbed in the neck and throat and three times in the stomach. Once she was dead, Sutcliffe mutilated her corpse with a knife and then arranged her body by neatly placing her knee-length boots over the back of her thighs. Tyre tracks left near the murder scene resulted in a long list of possible suspect vehicles.

Two months later, on 23April, Sutcliffe killed 32-year-old prostitute Patricia &quot;Tina&quot; Atkinson-Mitra in her Bradford flat, where police found a bootprint on the bedclothes. According to Sutcliffe, he picked Atkinson up in Manningham before driving to her residence. There he hit her on the back of the head four times to incapacitate her, then pulled down her jeans and pants and exposed her breasts. Sutcliffe then stabbed her six times in the stomach with a knife.

On 25June 1977, 16-year-old Jayne Michelle MacDonald went to meet friends at the Hofbrauhaus, a German-style bierkeller in Leeds. She missed the last bus home and went back to a friend&#x27;s house to wait for his sister to bring her home. After approximately forty-five minutes, MacDonald decided to walk home. During the journey she was attacked by Sutcliffe in Reginald Street at around 2:00a.m. MacDonald&#x27;s body was discovered the following morning at 9:45a.m. by children in the playground between Reginald Terrace and Reginald Street in Chapeltown. A post mortem was carried out by the Home Office pathologist Professor David Gee. The extent of her injuries was not revealed at the time by police, although it was subsequently revealed she had been hit on the head three times with a hammer and had been stabbed in the chest and back; a broken bottle was found embedded in her chest.

The following month, on 10July 1977, Sutcliffe assaulted 43-year-old Maureen Long in Bradford. Long was leaving a nightclub when Sutcliffe offered her a lift home. Long stopped to urinate and Sutcliffe struck her on the head, knocking her out. Long was suffering from hypothermia when found and was hospitalized for nine weeks. A witness misidentified the make of Sutcliffe&#x27;s car, resulting in more than 300 police officers checking thousands of cars without success.

On 1October 1977, Sutcliffe murdered 20-year-old Jean Bernadette Jordan, a prostitute and mother of two from Manchester known to friends as &quot;Scottish Jean.&quot; Shortly after 9:00p.m., Sutcliffe was cruising the area of Moss Side when he picked up Jordan. After they arrived in Princess Road near Southern Cemetery, he hit her once in the head before proceeding to hit her ten more times. In a later confession, Sutcliffe admitted he had realised the new five-pound note he had given to Jordan was traceable. After hosting a family party at his home, he returned to the wasteland behind Southern Cemetery, where he had left the body, but was unable to find the note.

On 9October, Jordan&#x27;s body was discovered by local dairy worker and future actor Bruce Jones, who had an allotment on land adjoining the site and was searching for house bricks when he made the discovery. The five-pound note, hidden in a secret compartment in Jordan&#x27;s handbag, was traced to branches of the Midland Bank in Bingley and Shipley. Police analysis of bank operations allowed them to narrow their field of inquiry to 8,000 employees who could have received it in their wage packet. Over three months, the police interviewed 5,000 men, including Sutcliffe. The police found that Sutcliffe&#x27;s alibi, the family party, was credible. Weeks of intense investigations pertaining to the origins of the note led to nothing, leaving investigators frustrated that they collected an important clue but had been unable to trace the actual firm to which or whom the note had been issued.

On 14December, Sutcliffe attacked Marilyn Moore, a 25-year-old prostitute, in the back of his car on wasteland in Scott Hall. Sutcliffe lost his balance whilst delivering a blow to Moore with a hammer, allowing Moore to escape with severe head injuries. Tyre tracks found at the scene matched those from an earlier attack. The resulting photofit bore a strong resemblance to Sutcliffe, as had those from other survivors, and Moore provided a good description of Sutcliffe&#x27;s black Sunbeam Rapier, which had been seen in red-light areas. Sutcliffe was interviewed on this issue.

===1978===
Police discontinued the search for the person who received the five-pound note in January 1978. Although Sutcliffe was interviewed about the matter, he was not investigated further and was contacted and disregarded by the Ripper investigation on several further occasions. That month, Sutcliffe killed Yvonne Ann Pearson, a 21-year-old prostitute from Bradford, on 21January 1978. He repeatedly bludgeoned her about the head with a ball-peen hammer, then jumped on her chest before stuffing horsehair into her mouth from a discarded sofa, under which he hid her body near Lumb Lane.

Ten days later, on 31 January, Sutcliffe killed Elena &quot;Helen&quot; Rytka, an 18-year-old prostitute from Huddersfield, striking her on the head five times as she exited his vehicle at Garrards timber yard before stripping most of her clothes, although her bra and polo-neck jumper were positioned above her breasts. Rytka was then sexually assaulted as she lay on the ground. Rytka was the sole victim that Sutcliffe had raped. After Rytka staggered to her feet, Sutcliffe again struck her on the back of the head with his hammer a number of times before retrieving a knife from his car and stabbing her several times through the heart and lungs. Rytka&#x27;s body was found three days later behind a stack of timber, placed under a sheet of asbestos, beneath the railway arches of the timber yard. Sutcliffe said of Rytka while in police custody in 1981: &quot;I had the urge to kill any woman. The urge inside me to kill girls was now practically uncontrollable.&quot;

Vera Evelyn Millward was a 40-year-old prostitute and mother of seven who left her council flat in Hulme at 10:00 p.m. on 16 May 1978, telling her boyfriend that she was going out to buy cigarettes. Sutcliffe picked up Millward and drove her to the parking compound of the Manchester Royal Infirmary in Chorlton-on-Medlock. After she got out of his car, Sutcliffe attacked Millward with a hammer. She was also slashed across the stomach and stabbed repeatedly with a screwdriver through the same wound in her back. After she died, Sutcliffe dragged Millward&#x27;s body against a fence and stabbed her repeatedly with a knife.

===1979===
On the evening of 2March 1979, 22-year-old Irish student Ann Rooney was attacked from behind at Horsforth College in Horsforth. She was struck three times on the head, probably with a hammer, according to Professor David Gee, who examined her at Leeds General Infirmary. Rooney&#x27;s description of her attacker and his car closely matched that of Sutcliffe and his Sunbeam Rapier, which had been flagged by police numerous times in red-light areas in both Leeds and Bradford. In 1992, Sutcliffe confessed to the attack on Rooney, as well as the 1975 attack on Browne. Barbara Mills, QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, decided at the time that it wasn&#x27;t in the public&#x27;s interest to add any additional charges against Sutcliffe for the attacks on Browne and Rooney.

At 11:55 p.m. on 4 April 1979, Sutcliffe killed Josephine Anne Whitaker, a 19-year-old clerk, as she was walking home on Savile Park Moor in Halifax. Sutcliffe hit Whitaker from behind with his ball-peen hammer and hit her again as she lay on the ground. He then proceeded to stab her with a screwdriver twenty-one times in the chest and stomach and six times in the right leg before also thrusting the screwdriver into her vagina. Whitaker&#x27;s skull was fractured from ear to ear.

Despite forensic evidence, police efforts were diverted for several months following the receipt of a taped message purporting to be from the murderer, taunting Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield of the West Yorkshire Police, who was leading the Yorkshire Ripper investigation. The tape contained a man&#x27;s voice saying, &quot;I&#x27;m Jack. I see you&#x27;re having no luck catching me. I have the greatest respect for you, George, but Lord, you&#x27;re no nearer catching me now than four years ago when I started.&quot; Based on the recorded message, police began searching for a man with a Wearside accent, which linguists narrowed down to the Castletown area of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. The hoaxer, dubbed &quot;Wearside Jack&quot;, sent two letters to police and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in March 1978 boasting of his crimes. The letters, signed &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, claimed responsibility for the November 1975 murder of 26-year-old Joan Harrison in Preston.
The hoaxer case was re-opened in 2005, and DNA taken from envelopes was entered into the national database. The DNA matched that of John Samuel Humble, an unemployed alcoholic and longtime resident of the Ford Estate in a few miles from whose DNA had been taken following a drunk and disorderly offence in 2001. On 20October 2005, Humble was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice for sending the hoax letters and tape. He was remanded in custody and on 21March 2006 was convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison. Humble died on 30July 2019, aged 63.

At approximately 1:00 a.m. on 1 September, Sutcliffe murdered 20-year-old Barbara Janine Leach, a Bradford University social psychology student who had earlier left a pub. Leach was attacked with a hammer after walking past Sutcliffe. He dragged her to the backyard of 13 Back Ash Grove, behind a low wall into an area where dustbins were kept, before pulling up her shirt and bra to expose her breasts and unfastening her jeans and partially pulling them down. He then stabbed her with the same screwdriver that he had used to kill Whitaker. Sutcliffe covered Leach&#x27;s body with an old piece of carpet and placed stones on top of it. The murder of another woman who was not a prostitute alarmed the public and prompted an expensive publicity campaign emphasising the Wearside connection. Despite the false lead, Sutcliffe was interviewed on at least two other occasions in 1979. Despite matching several forensic clues and being on the list of 300 names in connection with the five-pound note, he was not strongly suspected.

===1980===
On 26 June, Sutcliffe was stopped while driving, tested positive for drink driving and was arrested. Whilst awaiting trial for this, due in mid-January 1981, he killed 47-year-old civil servant Marguerite Walls on the night of 20August. Walls left her office between 9:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. to walk to her home in Farsley. Sutcliffe incapacitated her with a hammer blow to the back of her head as he continued to strike her while yelling &quot;filthy prostitute&quot; beside a driveway. In order to move her twenty yards from the place of the attack up the driveway and into a high-walled garden, Sutcliffe first tied a length of rope around Walls&#x27; neck and tightened it. There he suffocated her and removed almost every piece of clothing save for her tights. He partially covered the body with grass and leaves before he left.

On 24September, a 34-year-old doctor from Singapore, Upadhya Bandara, was walking home from meeting friends when Sutcliffe followed her into an alley in Headingley. He struck her on the head, rendering her unconscious, then, when he was startled, dragged her along the street with a rope around her neck and fled.

Maureen Lea, a 21-year-old art student at Leeds University, was attacked by Sutcliffe on 25October. Lea had finished visiting a pub with friends in Chapeltown when she was attacked as she hurried down a dark street to catch the bus home. She suffered from significant wounds, including a puncture hole to the back of her skull, a fractured skull, a fractured cheekbone, a broken jaw and numerous scratches and bruises.

Theresa Sykes, aged 16, was attacked in Huddersfield on the night of 5November. Sykes was going to a shop in Oakes when Sutcliffe hit her from behind. Her boyfriend heard her screams and ran out, scaring off Sutcliffe. Sykes was recovering from brain surgery when Sutcliffe was arrested. Jacqueline Hill, a 20-year-old student at Leeds University, was murdered on the night of 17November. Hill was returning home to her students&#x27; hall of residence in Headingley when Sutcliffe delivered a blow to her head before removing her clothes and stabbing her repeatedly in the chest and once in the eye with a screwdriver.

On 25November, Trevor Birdsall, Sutcliffe&#x27;s friend and the unwitting getaway driver in his first documented assault in 1969, reported him to the police as a suspect. In total, Sutcliffe had been questioned by the police on nine separate occasions in connection with the Ripper enquiry before his eventual arrest and conviction.

==Arrest==

On 2January 1981, Sutcliffe was stopped by police with 24-year-old prostitute Olivia Reivers in the driveway of Light Trades House on Melbourne Avenue, Broomhill, Sheffield, South Yorkshire. A police check by Probationary Constable Robert Hydes revealed that Sutcliffe&#x27;s car had false number plates; he was arrested and transferred to Dewsbury police station in West Yorkshire. There, Sutcliffe was questioned in relation to the Ripper case as he matched many of the known physical characteristics. 

The next day, Sergeant Robert Ring decided on a &quot;hunch&quot; to return to the scene of Sutcliffe&#x27;s arrest, where he discovered a knife, hammer and rope that Sutcliffe had discarded behind an oil storage tank when he briefly slipped away after telling police he was &quot;bursting for a pee.&quot; Sutcliffe hid a second knife in the toilet cistern at Dewsbury police station when he was permitted to use the toilet. Police obtained a search warrant for his home in Heaton and brought his wife in for questioning.

When Sutcliffe was stripped at Dewsbury police station, he was found to be wearing an inverted V-necked jumper under his trousers. The sleeves had been pulled over his legs, and the V-neck exposed his genital area. The fronts of the elbows were padded to protect his knees as, presumably, he knelt over his victims&#x27; corpses. The sexual implications of this outfit were considered obvious, but it was not known to the public until being published in 2003. 

After two days of intensive questioning, on the afternoon of 4January, Sutcliffe suddenly admitted that he was the Yorkshire Ripper. Over the next day, he calmly described his many attacks. Several weeks later he claimed God had told him to murder his victims. &quot;The women I killed were filth,&quot; he told police. &quot;Bastard prostitutes who were littering the streets. I was just cleaning up the place a bit.&quot; Sutcliffe displayed regret only when talking of his youngest murder victim, Jayne MacDonald, and showed emotion when questioned about the killing of Joan Harrison, which he vehemently denied having carried out. Harrison&#x27;s murder had been linked to the Ripper killings by &quot;Wearside Jack,&quot; but in 2011 DNA evidence revealed the crime had actually been committed by convicted sex offender Christopher Smith, who had died in 2008.

==Trial and conviction==
Sutcliffe was charged on 5January 1981. At his trial that May, he pleaded not guilty to thirteen charges of murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The basis of his defence was that he claimed to be the tool of God&#x27;s will. Sutcliffe said he had heard voices that ordered him to kill prostitutes while working as a gravedigger, which he claimed originated from the headstone of a Polish man, Bronisław Zapolski, and that the voices were that of God.

Sutcliffe pleaded guilty to seven charges of attempted murder. The prosecution intended to accept his plea after four psychiatrists diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia, but the trial judge, Justice Sir Leslie Boreham, demanded an unusually detailed explanation of the prosecution&#x27;s reasoning. After a two-hour representation by the Attorney-General, Sir Michael Havers, a ninety-minute lunch break and another forty minutes of legal discussion, Justice Boreham rejected the diminished responsibility plea and the expert testimonies of the psychiatrists, insisting that the case should be dealt with by a jury. The trial proper was set to commence on 5May 1981.

Sutcliffe&#x27;s trial lasted two weeks, and despite the efforts of his counsel, James Chadwin QC, Sutcliffe was found guilty of murder on all counts and was sentenced to twenty concurrent sentences of life imprisonment. The jury rejected the evidence of four psychiatrists who gave testimony that Sutcliffe had paranoid schizophrenia, possibly influenced by the evidence of a prison officer who heard him say to his wife that if he convinced people he was mad, he might get ten years in a &quot;loony bin.&quot;

Justice Boreham stated that Sutcliffe was beyond redemption and hoped he would never leave prison. He recommended a minimum term of thirty years to be served before parole could be considered, meaning Sutcliffe would have been unlikely to be freed until at least 2011. On 16July 2010, the High Court issued Sutcliffe with a whole life tariff, meaning he was never to be released. After his trial, Sutcliffe admitted to two other attacks although he was not prosecuted for the offences.

==Criticism of authorities==
===West Yorkshire Police===
West Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork, it was difficult for investigators to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system.

Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information, which generated thousands more documents. The 1982 Byford Report into the investigation concluded: &quot;The ineffectiveness of the major incident room was a serious handicap to the Ripper investigation. While it should have been the effective nerve centre of the whole police operation, the backlog of unprocessed information resulted in the failure to connect vital pieces of related information. This serious fault in the central index system allowed Peter Sutcliffe to continually slip through the net.&quot;

The choice by Chief Constable Ronald Gregory of Oldfield to lead the inquiry was criticised by Byford: &quot;The temptation to appoint a &#x27;senior man&#x27; on age or service grounds should be resisted. What is needed is an officer of sound professional competence who will inspire confidence and loyalty&quot;. Byford found Oldfield&#x27;s focus on the hoax tape wanting, and that Oldfield had ignored advice from survivors of Sutcliffe&#x27;s attacks, from several eminent specialists, from the FBI in the United States and from dialect analysts Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, that &quot;Wearside Jack&quot; was a hoaxer. Indeed, the investigation had used the hoax tape as a point of elimination, rather than as a line of enquiry, allowing Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as that which Sutcliffe had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. Humble, the hoaxer, appeared to know details of the murders that supposedly had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and from pub gossip.

In response to the police reaction to the murders, the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group organised a number of &#x27;Reclaim the Night&#x27; marches. The group and other feminists had criticised police for victim-blaming, especially for the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12November 1977, making the points that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men&#x27;s violence.

In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe&#x27;s last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during an action for damages on behalf of Hill&#x27;s estate, argued in the case &quot;Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire&quot; in the High Court that West Yorkshire Police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending Sutcliffe. The House of Lords held that the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire did not owe a duty of care to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failed on the second limb of the &quot;Caparo&quot; test. After Sutcliffe&#x27;s death in November 2020, West Yorkshire Police issued an apology for the &quot;language, tone, and terminology&quot; used by the force at the time of the original investigation, nine months after a victim&#x27;s son wrote on behalf of several of the victims&#x27; families.

===Attitude towards prostitutes===
The attitude in West Yorkshire Police at the time was one of misogyny and sexist beliefs, according to multiple sources. Jim Hobson, a senior West Yorkshire detective, told a press conference in October 1979 the perpetrator: Joan Smith wrote in &quot;Misogynies&quot;, that &quot;even Sutcliffe, at his trial, did not go quite this far; he did at least claim he was demented at the time.&quot; At Sutcliffe&#x27;s trial in 1981, Havers said of Sutcliffe&#x27;s victims in his opening statement: &quot;Some were prostitutes, but perhaps the saddest part of the case is that some were not. The last six attacks were on totally respectable women.&quot; This drew condemnation from the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP), who protested outside the Old Bailey. Nina Lopez, who was one of the ECP protestors in 1981, told &quot;The Independent&quot; forty years later that Havers&#x27; comments were &quot;an indictment of the whole way in which the police and the establishment were dealing with the Yorkshire Ripper case.&quot;

==Byford Report==
The Inspector of Constabulary Lawrence Byford&#x27;s 1981 report of an official inquiry into the Ripper case was not released by the Home Office until 1June 2006. The sections &quot;Description of suspects, photofits and other assaults&quot; and parts of the section on Sutcliffe&#x27;s &quot;immediate associates&quot; were not disclosed by the Home Office. The Byford Report&#x27;s major findings were contained in a summary published by the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, disclosing for the first time precise details of the bungled investigation. Byford described delays in following up vital tip-offs from Birdsall, who on 25November 1980 sent an anonymous letter to police, the text of which ran as follows: Birdsall&#x27;s letter was marked &quot;Priority No.1&quot;. An index card was created on the basis of the letter and a policewoman found Sutcliffe already had three existing index cards in the records. But &quot;for some inexplicable reason,&quot; said the Byford Report, the papers remained in a filing tray in the incident room until Sutcliffe&#x27;s arrest on 2January 1981, several weeks later.

Birdsall visited Bradford police station the day after sending his letter to repeat his suspicion about Sutcliffe. He stated that he was with Sutcliffe when he got out of a car to pursue a woman with whom he had had an argument at a bar in Halifax on 15August the date and place of the Olive Smelt attack. A report compiled on the visit was lost, despite a &quot;comprehensive search&quot; that took place after Sutcliffe&#x27;s arrest, according to the Byford Report. Byford said: 

==Possible victims==
===Byford Report===
Amongst other things, the Byford Report asserted that there was a high likelihood of Sutcliffe having claimed more victims both during and before his known killing spree. Police identified a number of attacks that matched Sutcliffe&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; and tried to question the killer, but he was never charged with other crimes. Referring to the period between 1969, when Sutcliffe first came to the attention of police, and 1975, the year of his first documented murder, the report states, &quot;There is a curious and unexplained lull in Sutcliffe&#x27;s criminal activities,&quot; and &quot;it is my firm conclusion that between 1969 and 1980 Sutcliffe was probably responsible for many attacks on unaccompanied women, which he has not yet admitted, not only in the West Yorkshire and Manchester areas, but also in other parts of the country.&quot;

In 1969, Sutcliffe, described in the Byford Report as an &quot;otherwise unremarkable young man,&quot; came to the notice of police on two occasions over incidents with prostitutes. Later that year, in September, he was arrested in Bradford&#x27;s red-light area for being in possession of a hammer, an offensive weapon, but he was charged with &quot;going equipped for stealing&quot; as it was assumed he was a potential burglar. The report said that it was clear Sutcliffe had on at least one occasion attacked a Bradford prostitute with a cosh. Byford states:
===Carol Wilkinson case===

Only days after his conviction in 1981, crime writer David Yallop asserted that Sutcliffe may have been responsible for the murder of 20-year-old Carol Wilkinson, who was randomly bludgeoned over the head with a stone in Bradford on 10October 1977, nine days after his killing of Jean Jordan. Wilkinson&#x27;s murder had initially been considered as a possible &quot;Ripper&quot; killing, but this was quickly ruled out as she was not a prostitute. Police eventually admitted in 1979 that the Ripper did not solely attack prostitutes, but by this time a local man, Anthony Steel, had already been convicted of Wilkinson&#x27;s murder. Yallop highlighted that Steel had always protested his innocence and been convicted on weak evidence. He had confessed to the murder under intense questioning, having been told that he would be allowed to see a solicitor if he did so. Even though his confession failed to include any details of the murder, and Hobson testified at trial that he did not find the confession credible, Steel was narrowly convicted.

Around the time of Wilkinson&#x27;s murder it was widely reported that Professor David Gee, the Home Office pathologist who conducted all the post-mortem examinations on the Ripper victims, noted similarities between the Wilkinson murder and the killing of Ripper victim Yvonne Pearson three months later. Like Wilkinson, Pearson was bludgeoned with a heavy stone and was not stabbed, and was initially ruled out as a &quot;Ripper&quot; victim. Pearson&#x27;s murder was re-classified as a Ripper killing in 1979 while Wilkinson&#x27;s murder was not reviewed. Sutcliffe did not confess to Wilkinson&#x27;s murder at his trial, and Steel was already serving time for the murder. During his imprisonment, Sutcliffe was noted to show &quot;particular anxiety&quot; at mentions of Wilkinson due to the possible unsoundness of Steel&#x27;s conviction.

Sutcliffe was known to have been acquainted with Wilkinson and to have argued violently with her stepfather over his advances towards her. He was familiar with the council estate where she was murdered and regularly frequented the area. In February 1977, only months before the murder, Sutcliffe was reported to police for acting suspiciously on the street where Wilkinson lived. Furthermore, earlier on the day of the murder, Sutcliffe had gone back to mutilate Jordan&#x27;s body before returning to Bradford, showing he had already gone out to attack victims that day and would have been in Bradford to attack Wilkinson after he returned from mutilating Jordan. The location where Wilkinson was killed was also very close to Sutcliffe&#x27;s place of employment, where he would have clocked in for work that afternoon.

In 2003, Steel&#x27;s conviction was quashed after it was found that his low IQ and mental capabilities made him a vulnerable interviewee, discrediting his supposed &quot;confession&quot; and confirming Yallop&#x27;s long-standing suspicions that he had been wrongfully convicted. Yallop continued to put forth the theory that Sutcliffe was the real killer. In 2015, former detective Chris Clark and investigative journalist Tim Tate published a book, &quot;Yorkshire Ripper: The Secret Murders&quot;, which supported the theory that Sutcliffe had murdered Wilkinson, pointing out that her body had been posed and partially stripped in a manner similar to the Ripper&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot;.

===Keith Hellawell investigations===
In 1982, West Yorkshire Police appointed detective Keith Hellawell to lead a secret investigation into possible additional victims of Sutcliffe. A list was compiled of around sixty murders and attempted murders not just in Yorkshire but around the country that West Yorkshire Police and other forces thought could possibly be linked to Sutcliffe. Detectives were able to eliminate him from forty of these cases with reference to his lorry driver&#x27;s logs which showed which part of the country he was in when he was working, leaving twenty-two unsolved crimes with hallmarks of a Sutcliffe attack which were investigated further. Twelve of these occurred within West Yorkshire while the others took place in other parts of the country. Hellawell had also listed the attacks on Tracey Browne in 1975 and Ann Rooney in 1979 as possible Sutcliffe attacks, and it was to Hellawell that Sutcliffe confessed to these crimes in 1992, confirming police suspicions that he was responsible for more attacks than those he confessed to.

* On 22April 1966, shortly after 11:30 a.m., Fred Craven, aged 66, was murdered with a blunt instrument in his betting office above an antique shop in Wellington Street, Bingley. Craven&#x27;s wallet, which was believed to have contained £200 in cash, had been stolen by his murderer. Sutcliffe&#x27;s brother, Michael, aged 16, was held for questioning but was eventually released and was ruled out as having any involvement in the crime. Sutcliffe, then aged 20, knew Craven, who lived at 23 Cornwall Road, and the Sutcliffe family home where Sutcliffe lived was less than one hundred yards away at 57 Cornwall Road. Sutcliffe had also asked Craven&#x27;s daughter to go out with him several times and had been turned down.
* On 22March 1967, taxi driver John Tomey, aged 27, picked up a passenger in Leeds who wanted to be driven to Bingley; near Bingley he stopped and the passenger in the back then assaulted him with a hammer, hitting him in the head. When he regained consciousness, Tomey was able to drive off and get help at a nearby cottage. He had suffered a fractured skull with multiple lacerations as well as a fractured thumb. In 1981, several weeks after Sutcliffe&#x27;s arrest in the Ripper case, Detective Sergeant Des O&#x27;Boyle questioned Tomey and showed him photographs of different men, including one taken of Sutcliffe after his arrest for going equipped for theft in 1969. Tomey identified Sutcliffe his attacker.
* On 11November 1974, while walking across a school playing field in Bradford between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m., Gloria Wood, aged 28, met a man who offered to carry her bags. He then used what appeared to be a claw hammer to hit her in the head. She sustained serious wounds, including a depressed skull fracture with a crescent-shaped wound that later required surgery for the removal of bone shards from her brain. Wood was discovered drenched in blood after the attack was stopped by several nearby youths. While she could not provide a photofit of her attacker, she described him as tall with black hair and a beard, which fit Sutcliffe&#x27;s description.
* Debra Marie Schlesinger, aged 18, was stabbed through the heart as she walked down the garden path of her home in Hawksworth after a night out with friends on 21April 1977. After being stabbed, Schlesinger was pursued before she collapsed and died in a doorway. Witnesses recalled seeing a dark, bearded man near the scene, and there was no clear motive for her murder. Although a hammer was not used, Sutcliffe also often used a knife to stab his victims. Most notably, Sutcliffe&#x27;s work record also showed that he was delivering to an engineering plant 100 yards from Schlesinger&#x27;s home on the day she was killed. The murder took place only two days before Sutcliffe&#x27;s known killing of Patricia Atkinson in Bradford. At the time, detectives did not believe her murder was a &quot;Ripper&quot; killing as she was not a prostitute. However, by 2002, West Yorkshire Police publicly announced they were ready to bring charges against Sutcliffe for Schlesinger&#x27;s murder although no further action was taken.
* Yvonne Mysliwiec, a 21-year-old journalist, was attacked from behind after crossing a footbridge at Ilkley railway station on 11October 1979 and suffered a severe head injury. The attack was interrupted by a rail passenger. Her attacker was described as being in his thirties, dark, swarthy, square faced and with crinkly hair, which fit Sutcliffe&#x27;s description. After Sutcliffe&#x27;s trial, West Yorkshire Police announced that he would be questioned about the Mysliwiec attack.

===Additional investigations===
In 2017, West Yorkshire Police launched Operation Painthall to determine if Sutcliffe was guilty of unsolved crimes dating back to 1964. In December 2017 the force, in response to a Freedom of Information request, neither confirmed nor denied that Operation Painthall existed.
* After his conviction in 1981, South Yorkshire Police interviewed Sutcliffe on the murder of 29-year-old Doncaster prostitute Barbara Young, who had been hit over the head by a &quot;tall, dark haired man&quot; in an alleyway on the evening of 22March 1977. A post-mortem revealed that Young had died from a massive haemorrhage caused by a fractured skull. However, several aspects of the attack did not fit Sutcliffe&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi,&quot; particularly as she had been hit from the front and had been the victim of a robbery.
* On 28August 1979, 32-year-old prostitute Wendy Jenkins was killed in Bristol; she had been stabbed and beaten to death and was found partially buried in a building site sandpit. Avon and Somerset Police liaised with West Yorkshire Police as to whether there were any potential links to the Yorkshire Ripper. Hobson visited the site of the murder in Bristol, but there were a number of differences from Sutcliffe&#x27;s known &quot;modus operandi.&quot; Jenkins&#x27; murder remains unsolved.
* Links were investigated in 2016 between Sutcliffe and the unsolved murders of two Swedish prostitutes in 1980. Gertie Jensen, aged 31, was found on a Gothenburg building site on 12August 1980. On 30August, Teresa Thörling, aged 26, was found dead in the entrance to a building in Malmö with severe head wounds. Bo Lundqvist, a police cold-case investigator, stated that the murders bore Sutcliffe&#x27;s signature in terms of their &quot;sexually charged brutality.&quot; Sutcliffe&#x27;s name appeared on the manifest of a ferry between Malmö and Dragor across the Oresund Strait a day before the second murder. However, West Yorkshire Police later stated that they were &quot;absolutely certain&quot; that Sutcliffe had never been in Sweden.

===&quot;Yorkshire Ripper: The Secret Murders&quot;===
In 2015, authors Chris Clark and Tim Tate published a book claiming links between Sutcliffe and more unsolved murders, titled &quot;Yorkshire Ripper: The Secret Murders&quot;. They alleged that between 1966 and 1980, Sutcliffe was responsible for at least twenty-two more murders than he was convicted of. The book was later adapted into a two-part ITV documentary series of the same name, which featured both Clark and Tate.
* Mary Judge, a 43-year-old prostitute, was found naked and battered to death on waste ground near the Leeds Parish Church on 22February 1968. She was last seen outside Regent Hotel in the city centre. Rail passengers from Kingston upon Hull are believed to have seen some of the attack as their train passed the church at Kirkgate at 10:18 p.m. A small boy on the train, which passed within fifty yards of the murder scene, was the main witness. He saw a tall, slim man with long dark hair beating Judge to the ground.
* Lucy Tinslop, aged 21, was attacked after leaving her birthday party at 11:30 p.m. at St Mary&#x27;s Rest Garden in Bath Street, Nottingham, on 4August 1969. She was raped and strangled; her abdomen had been ripped open and her vagina had been stabbed over twenty times which was consistent with Sutcliffe&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi.&quot;
* Gloria Booth, aged 29, was found strangled and partially nude in Stonefield Park in Ruislip, West London, on 13June 1971. Police believe she was attacked as she walked home from work. Sutcliffe was in the area at the time as his girlfriend was living in Alperton.
* Judith Roberts, aged 14, was murdered on 7June 1972 after leaving home to ride her bike in Wigginton, Staffordshire. She was found partially hidden beneath hedge clippings and plastic fertiliser bags face down later that day after going missing in a field north of Tamworth; she had nineteen head wounds and had been battered to death. Andrew Evans, aged 17, was wrongfully convicted for the murder and served twenty-five years in jail before his conviction was quashed in 1997. On the evening of Roberts&#x27; death, Sutcliffe was driving to visit his fiancée at a hospital in Bexleyheath. He would then have had to return to Bingley, where he worked nightshifts, which would have taken him within a short distance of the murder scene at Comberford Lane. Sutcliffe also drove a grey Ford Escort at the time of Roberts&#x27; murder, which is identical to a vehicle that four eyewitnesses observed trailing Roberts as she made her way to local shops before her disappearance.
* Wendy Sewell, a 32-year-old legal secretary, was attacked in Bakewell Cemetery at lunchtime on 12September 1973. She was beaten around the head seven times with the handle of a pickaxe, which had caused severe head injuries and fractures to her skull. She had also been sexually assaulted. Clark and Tate claimed to have unearthed a pathology report which allegedly indicated that the originally convicted Stephen Downing could not have committed the crime. The Home Office responded by stating that it would send any new evidence to the police. Derbyshire Constabulary dismissed the theory, noting a re-investigation in 2002 had found only that Downing could not be ruled out of the investigation and responded by stating that there was no evidence linking Sutcliffe to the crime.
* Rosina Hilliard, a 24-year-old prostitute, was found on 22February 1974 at a building site near Humberstone Road, Leicester. She had been hit by a car and suffered extensive head injuries and fractures to her spine and collar bone. A post-mortem confirmed someone had also attempted to strangle her. Records show Sutcliffe was delivering goods to and from the area at the time. 
* One murder that was linked to Sutcliffe in the book, 25-year-old trainee teacher Alison Morris in Ramsey, Essex, on 1September 1979, took place only six and a half hours before his known killing of Barbara Leach in Bradford, over away. Morris was stabbed multiple times as she walked down a footpath along the Stour Brook, 250 yards from her home in Wrabness Road. Clark and Tate claimed that Sutcliffe could have been in Essex and still had enough time to drive back to Bradford to kill Leach later. Morris&#x27; case remains unsolved.
* Sally Shepherd, aged 24, was making her way home to Friary Road late at night after getting off a bus in Peckham, South London, on 1December 1979 when she was clubbed unconscious, sexually assaulted and beaten to death. Her killer then dragged her body through a wire fence and left her at the back of Peckham police station in Staffordshire Street. Sally&#x27;s murder and Sutcliffe&#x27;s killing of Yvonne Pearson in January 1978 bore many similarities. Sutcliffe&#x27;s wife, Sonia, also did a teacher training course in nearby Deptford at the time, and Sutcliffe used to frequently visit her.

==Incarceration==
===Prison and Broadmoor Hospital===
Following his conviction and incarceration, Sutcliffe chose to use the name Coonan, his mother&#x27;s maiden name. He began his sentence at HM Prison Parkhurst on 22May 1981. Despite being found sane at his trial, Sutcliffe was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Attempts to send him to a secure psychiatric unit were blocked. While at Parkhurst he was seriously assaulted by James Costello, a 35-year-old career criminal with several convictions for violence; on 10January 1983, he followed Sutcliffe into a recess of F2, the hospital wing at Parkhurst, and plunged a broken coffee jar twice into the left side of Sutcliffe&#x27;s face, creating four wounds requiring thirty stitches. In March 1984, Sutcliffe was sent to Broadmoor Hospital under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983.

Sutcliffe&#x27;s wife obtained a separation around 1989 and a divorce in July 1994. On 23February 1996, Sutcliffe was attacked in his room in Broadmoor&#x27;s Henley Ward; Paul Wilson, a convicted robber, asked to borrow a videotape before attempting to strangle Sutcliffe with the cable from a pair of stereo headphones. After an attack with a pen by fellow inmate Ian Kay on 10March 1997, Sutcliffe lost the vision in his left eye, and his right eye was severely damaged. Kay admitted trying to kill Sutcliffe and was ordered to be detained in a secure mental hospital without limit of time. In 2003, it was reported that Sutcliffe had developed diabetes.

Sutcliffe&#x27;s father died in 2004 and was cremated. On 17January 2005 he was allowed to visit Arnside where the ashes had been scattered. The decision to allow the temporary release was initiated by David Blunkett and ratified by Charles Clarke when he became Home Secretary. Sutcliffe was accompanied by four members of the hospital staff. The visit led to front-page tabloid headlines. On 22December 2007, a fourth attack on Sutcliffe was made by fellow inmate Patrick Sureda, who lunged at him with a metal cutlery knife while shouting, &quot;You fucking raping, murdering bastard, I&#x27;ll blind your fucking other one!&quot; Sutcliffe flung himself backwards and the blade missed his right eye, stabbing him in the cheek.

On 17February 2009, it was reported that Sutcliffe was &quot;fit to leave Broadmoor.&quot; On 23March 2010, the Secretary of State for Justice, Jack Straw, was questioned by Julie Kirkbride, Conservative MP for Bromsgrove, in the House of Commons seeking reassurance for a constituent, a victim of Sutcliffe, that he would remain in prison. Straw responded that whilst the matter of Sutcliffe&#x27;s release was a parole board matter, &quot;that all the evidence that I have seen on this case, and it&#x27;s a great deal, suggests to me that there are no circumstances in which this man will be released.&quot;

===Appeal===
An application by Sutcliffe for a minimum term to be set, offering the possibility of parole after that date if it were thought safe to release him, was heard by the High Court on 16July 2010. The court decided that Sutcliffe would never be released. Mitting stated:
Psychological reports describing Sutcliffe&#x27;s mental state were taken into consideration, as was the severity of his crimes. Sutcliffe spent the rest of his life in custody. On 4August 2010, a spokeswoman for the Judicial Communications Office confirmed that Sutcliffe had initiated an appeal against the decision. The hearing for Sutcliffe&#x27;s appeal began on 30November 2010, at the Court of Appeal. The appeal was rejected on 14January 2011. On 9March 2011, the Court of Appeal rejected Sutcliffe&#x27;s application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. In December 2015, Sutcliffe was assessed as being &quot;no longer mentally ill.&quot; In August 2016, a medical tribunal ruled that he no longer required clinical treatment for his mental condition, and could be returned to prison. Sutcliffe was reported to have been transferred from Broadmoor to HM Prison Frankland in August 2016.

===Death===
Peter Sutcliffe died at University Hospital of North Durham, at the age of 74, on 13 November 2020, from COVID-19 and diabetes-related complications, after having previously returned to HM Prison Frankland following treatment for a suspected heart attack at the same hospital two weeks prior. He had a number of underlying health problems, including obesity. A private funeral ceremony was held, and Sutcliffe&#x27;s body was cremated.

==Media==
The song &quot;Night Shift&quot; by English post-punk band Siouxsie and the Banshees on their 1981 album &quot;Juju&quot; is about Sutcliffe.

On 6April 1991, Sutcliffe&#x27;s father, John, talked about his son on the television discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;.

&quot;This Is Personal: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper&quot;, a British television crime drama miniseries, first shown on ITV from 26January to 2February 2000, is a dramatisation of the real-life investigation into the murders, showing the effect that it had on the health and career of Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield (Alun Armstrong). The series also starred Richard Ridings and James Laurenson as DSI Dick Holland and Chief Constable Ronald Gregory, respectively. Although broadcast over two weeks, two episodes were shown consecutively each week. The series was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Serial at the 2001 awards.

In 2009, the three TV films &quot;Red Riding&quot;, also called The Yorkshire Ripper trilogy, depicted some of Sutcliffe&#x27;s deeds. The third book (and second episodic television adaptation) in David Peace&#x27;s &quot;Red Riding&quot; series is set against the backdrop of the Ripper investigation. In that episode, Sutcliffe is played by Joseph Mawle. The 13May 2013 episode of &quot;Crimes That Shook Britain&quot; focused on the case.

On 26August 2016, the police investigation was the subject of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Reunion&quot;. Sue MacGregor discussed the investigation with John Domaille, who subsequently served as assistant chief constable in the West Yorkshire Police; Andy Laptew, a young detective who conducted interviews with Sutcliffe; Elaine Benson, a detective who was part of the investigative team; David Zackrisson, who worked on the false leads, the &quot;Wearside Jack&quot; tape and the Sunderland letters; and Christa Ackroyd, a local journalist.

A three-part series of one-hour episodes, &quot;The Yorkshire Ripper Files: A Very British Crime Story&quot;, by filmmaker Liza Williams aired on BBC Four in March 2019. This included interviews with some of the victims, their families, police and journalists who covered the case. In the series she questions whether the attitude towards women on the part of both the police and society prevented Sutcliffe from being caught sooner. On 31July 2020, the series won the BAFTA prize for Specialist Factual TV programming.

A play written by Olivia Hirst and David Byrne, &quot;The Incident Room&quot;, premiered at Pleasance as part of the 2019 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The play focuses on the police force hunting Sutcliffe. The play was produced by New Diorama.

In December 2020, &quot;Netflix&quot; released a four-part documentary entitled &quot;The Ripper&quot;, which recounts the police investigation into the murders with interviews from living victims, family members of victims and police officers involved in the investigation. 

In November 2021, American heavy metal band Slipknot released a song titled &quot;The Chapeltown Rag&quot;, which is inspired by media reporting on the murders.

In February 2022, Channel 5 released a 60-minute documentary entitled &quot;The Ripper Speaks: The Lost Tapes&quot;, which recounts interviews, and Sutcliffe speaking about life in prison and in Broadmoor Hospital, as well as crimes he had committed but that had not been seen or treated as &quot;a Ripper killing&quot;.

In 2023, the ITV1 drama &quot;The Long Shadow&quot; focused on Sutcliffe&#x27;s crimes.

<text>North Sheen is an area of London, England in the former Municipal Borough of Richmond (Surrey). It was incorporated into Kew in 1965 when the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames was created.

Although North Sheen no longer officially exists as a place name, it survives as the name of a station. Being south of the A316 road, the station is in Richmond rather than Kew, and so was not actually in North Sheen. Kew also has North Sheen Bowling Club, North Sheen Cemetery and North Sheen Recreation Ground.

==History==

North Sheen, whose etymology is shared with East Sheen, formed a civil parish from 1894 to 1965. Historically, it formed part of the Mortlake parish and became part of the expanded Municipal Borough of Richmond in 1892. Under the Local Government Act 1894, a new North Sheen parish was created from part of Mortlake, with the remainder of Mortlake then forming part of Barnes Urban District. The North Sheen parish covered an area of . In 1901 the population was 2,807 and in 1951 it was 7,429.

North Sheen was first marked on maps from 1904. At that time it was mostly undeveloped, but by 1920 residential building was underway.

==In fiction==

A major section of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; takes place at Sheen, depicting with considerable detail the destruction caused there by Wells&#x27; Martian invaders.

<text>East Sheen, also known as Sheen, is a suburb in south-west London in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

Its long high street has shops, offices, restaurants, cafés, pubs and suburban supermarkets and is also the economic hub for Mortlake of which East Sheen was once a manor. This commercial thoroughfare, well served by public transport, is the Upper Richmond Road West which connects Richmond to Putney. Central to this street is &quot;The Triangle&quot;, a traffic island with a war memorial and an old milestone dating from 1751, marking the distance to Cornhill in the City of London.

The main railway station serving the area, Mortlake, is centred north of this. Sheen has a mixture of low-rise and mid-rise buildings and it has parks and open spaces including its share of Richmond Park, accessed via Sheen Gate; Palewell Common, which has a playground, playing fields, tennis courts and a pitch and putt course; and East Sheen Common which is owned by the National Trust and leads into Bog Gate, another gate of Richmond Park.

Sheen Lane runs south from the junction of Mortlake High Street and Lower Richmond Road, over the level crossing at Mortlake station and the crossroads at Upper Richmond Road West, and up the hill to East Sheen Gate.

==Etymology==
The earliest recorded use of the name is c. 950 as &quot;Sceon&quot; and means &quot;shed or shelters&quot;. The area was designated separately from Sheen (an earlier name for Richmond) from the 13th century, as the southern manor of Mortlake.

==Local politics==
East Sheen is in the Richmond Park constituency. The Member of Parliament is Sarah Olney of the Liberal Democrats.

Every four years, residents elect three councillors to Richmond upon Thames Council. East Sheen was traditionally a safe Conservative ward, but in the 2022 elections three Liberal Democrats were elected.

East Sheen Ward borders the railway at Mortlake station, and includes a large slice of Richmond Park, extending south to Robin Hood Gate by the A3 road.

== History ==

=== Manor and hamlet status ===
East Sheen was a hamlet in the parish of Mortlake:
Earliest references specifically to the present area of land, rather than references to parts of Mortlake, emerge in the 13th century, generally under its early name of Westhall. Originally one carucate, it was sold in 1473 by Michael Gaynsford and Margaret his wife in the right of Margaret to William Welbeck, citizen and haberdasher, of London. The Welbecks held it until selling in 1587. Later owners of what remained, the Whitfields, Juxons and Taylors were equally not titled, as with Mortlake&#x27;s manorial owners, nor had an above average size or lavish manor house.

=== Development of the Temple Grove, Palmerston country estate ===

The southern estate of Temple Grove, East Sheen, first belonged to Sir Abraham Cullen, who was created a baronet in 1661. He died in 1668, and his first son Sir John in 1677. His second son Sir Rushout Cullen seems to have sold the estate shortly afterwards to Sir John Temple, attorney-general of Ireland, brother to Sir William Temple, diplomat and author, who was earlier of adjoining West Sheen, giving the home his name. It belonged to the Temples until Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, who later would serve as Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister, sold it soon after coming of age in 1805. It was bought by Sir Thomas Bernard, who rebuilt the Jacobean style front of the house shown in a drawing hung in the house of 1611. Sir Thomas sold it about 1811 to Rev. William Pearson who founded the Temple Grove Preparatory School for boys. The school moved in 1907 to Eastbourne and the estate was given over to house and apartment builders.

===Administration===
East Sheen was included in the Metropolitan Police District in 1840. Before 1900, Mortlake developed a secular vestry to help administer poor relief, maintain roads, ditches and other affairs. From 1892 to 1894 Mortlake (including East Sheen) formed part of the expanded Municipal Borough of Richmond. In 1894, nearby North Sheen was created as a civil parish, being split off from Mortlake and remaining in the Municipal Borough of Richmond. The remainder of Mortlake (including East Sheen) was instead transferred to the Barnes Urban District, which became the Municipal Borough of Barnes in 1932.

In 1965 North Sheen was incorporated into Kew which, with the rest of the Municipal Borough of Richmond, joined the Municipal Borough of Twickenham and the Municipal Borough of Barnes to form the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

==Economy==
East Sheen concentrates its commercial area to the main through street: its long high street has transport/furniture/hardware shops, convenience services, offices, restaurants, cafés, pubs and suburban supermarkets and is also the economic hub for Mortlake of which East Sheen was once a manor. This wide-footpath street is the Upper Richmond Road West which connects Richmond to Putney. Central to this street is &quot;The Triangle&quot;, a tree-lined traffic island with a war memorial and an old milestone at the intersection of Upper Richmond Road West with Sheen Lane. The main railway station serving the area, Mortlake, is centred 300m north of this.

==Churches==
East Sheen lies in the ecclesiastical parish of Mortlake with East Sheen. In addition to the Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin the district has two daughter churches: Christ Church, and All Saints. Christ Church, situated near the crossroads of Christchurch Road and West Temple Sheen, was built by Arthur Blomfield on land formerly part of a farm at the entrance to Sheen Common in the 1860s. It was originally planned to be opened in April 1863; however, the tower collapsed shortly before completion and had to be rebuilt. The church was finally completed and consecrated nine months later, on 13 January 1864.

All Saints was built on land bequeathed under the will of Major Shepherd-Cross, MP for Bolton who lived at nearby Palewell Lodge from 1896 until his death in 1913. The church was consecrated on All Saints&#x27; Day 1929, a year and two days after the foundation stone was laid by Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother).

East Sheen has two other churches: East Sheen Baptist Church and Parkside Christian Centre.

East Sheen has no separate Roman Catholic church; the church of St Mary Magdalen Mortlake and Our Lady Queen of Peace Church, Richmond also serve East Sheen.

==Other notable features==
There is a Grade II-listed air raid shelter, dating from before the Second World War, at St Leonard&#x27;s Court, a block of flats on St Leonard&#x27;s Road, near Mortlake railway station.

Schools in the area include: Richmond Park Academy; Tower House Boys&#x27; Preparatory School, a small independent prep-school for boys aged 4–13; East Sheen Primary School, a state school on Upper Richmond Road West; Sheen Mount School, a state primary school on West Temple; and Thomson House School, located on Vernon Road.

==Transport==
The area is served by Mortlake railway station, which is 300m north of &quot;The Triangle&quot; and can be accessed from Sheen Lane.
Transport for London bus routes are 33, 337 and 493 which serve Upper Richmond Road West.

==Demography and housing==

==East Sheen in art==
The Triangle in East Sheen is the subject of a painting, &quot;The Triangle, Sheen Lane, East Sheen, Surrey&quot; by James Isaiah Lewis (1861–1934), which is in the Richmond upon Thames Borough Art Collection and is held at Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham.

<doc id="305100" wikidata="Q1851985" url="?curid=305100" title="Telerobotics">
<text>Telerobotics is the area of robotics concerned with the control of semi-autonomous robots from a distance, chiefly using television, wireless networks (like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the Deep Space Network) or tethered connections. It is a combination of two major subfields, which are teleoperation and telepresence.

== Teleoperation ==
Teleoperation indicates operation of a machine at a distance. It is similar in meaning to the phrase &quot;remote control&quot; but is usually encountered in research, academic and technical environments. It is most commonly associated with robotics and mobile robots but can be applied to a whole range of circumstances in which a device or machine is operated by a person from a distance.

Teleoperation is the most standard term, used both in research and technical communities, for referring to operation at a distance. This is opposed to &quot;telepresence&quot;, which refers to the subset of telerobotic systems configured with an immersive interface such that the operator feels present in the remote environment, projecting their presence through the remote robot. One of the first telepresence systems that enabled operators to feel present in a remote environment through all of the primary senses (sight, sound, and touch) was the Virtual Fixtures system developed at US Air Force Research Laboratories in the early 1990s. The system enabled operators to perform dexterous tasks (inserting pegs into holes) remotely such that the operator would feel as if he or she was inserting the pegs when in fact it was a robot remotely performing the task.

A telemanipulator (or teleoperator) is a device that is controlled remotely by a human operator. In simple cases the controlling operator&#x27;s command actions correspond directly to actions in the device controlled, as for example in a radio-controlled model aircraft or a tethered deep submergence vehicle. Where communications delays make direct control impractical (such as a remote planetary rover), or it is desired to reduce operator workload (as in a remotely controlled spy or attack aircraft), the device will not be controlled directly, instead being commanded to follow a specified path. At increasing levels of sophistication the device may operate somewhat independently in matters such as obstacle avoidance, also commonly employed in planetary rovers.

Devices designed to allow the operator to control a robot at a distance are sometimes called telecheric robotics.

Two major components of telerobotics and telepresence are the visual and control applications. A remote camera provides a visual representation of the view from the robot. Placing the robotic camera in a perspective that allows intuitive control is a recent technique that although based in Science Fiction (Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1942 short story &quot;Waldo&quot;) has not been fruitful as the speed, resolution and bandwidth have only recently been adequate to the task of being able to control the robot camera in a meaningful way. Using a head mounted display, the control of the camera can be facilitated by tracking the head as shown in the figure below.

This only works if the user feels comfortable with the latency of the system, the lag in the response to movements, the visual representation. Any issues such as, inadequate resolution, latency of the video image, lag in the mechanical and computer processing of the movement and response, and optical distortion due to camera lens and head mounted display lenses, can cause the user &#x27;simulator sickness&#x27; that is exacerbated by the lack of vestibular stimulation with visual representation of motion.

Mismatch between the users motions such as registration errors, lag in movement response due to overfiltering, inadequate resolution for small movements, and slow speed can contribute to these problems.

The same technology can control the robot, but then the eye–hand coordination issues become even more pervasive through the system, and user tension or frustration can make the system difficult to use.

The tendency to build robots has been to minimize the degrees of freedom because that reduces the control problems. Recent improvements in computers has shifted the emphasis to more degrees of freedom, allowing robotic devices that seem more intelligent and more human in their motions. This also allows more direct teleoperation as the user can control the robot with their own motions.

== Interfaces ==

A telerobotic interface can be as simple as a common MMK (monitor-mouse-keyboard) interface. While this is not immersive, it is inexpensive. Telerobotics driven by internet connections are often of this type. A valuable modification to MMK is a joystick, which provides a more intuitive navigation scheme for the planar robot movement.

Dedicated telepresence setups utilize a head-mounted display with either single or dual eye display, and an ergonomically matched interface with joystick and related button, slider, trigger controls.

Other interfaces merge fully immersive virtual reality interfaces and real-time video instead of computer-generated images. Another example would be to use an omnidirectional treadmill with an immersive display system so that the robot is driven by the person walking or running. Additional modifications may include merged data displays such as Infrared thermal imaging, real-time threat assessment, or device schematics.

== Applications ==

===Space===
With the exception of the Apollo program, most space exploration has been conducted with telerobotic space probes. Most space-based astronomy, for example, has been conducted with telerobotic telescopes. The Russian Lunokhod-1 mission, for example, put a remotely driven rover on the Moon, which was driven in real time (with a 2.5-second lightspeed time delay) by human operators on the ground. Robotic planetary exploration programs use spacecraft that are programmed by humans at ground stations, essentially achieving a long-time-delay form of telerobotic operation. Recent noteworthy examples include the Mars exploration rovers (MER) and the &quot;Curiosity rover. In the case of the MER mission, the spacecraft and the rover operated on stored programs, with the rover drivers on the ground programming each day&#x27;s operation. The International Space Station (ISS) uses a two-armed telemanipulator called Dextre. More recently, a humanoid robot Robonaut has been added to the space station for telerobotic experiments.

NASA has proposed use of highly capable telerobotic systems for future planetary exploration using human exploration from orbit. In a concept for Mars Exploration proposed by Landis, a precursor mission to Mars could be done in which the human vehicle brings a crew to Mars, but remains in orbit rather than landing on the surface, while a highly capable remote robot is operated in real time on the surface. Such a system would go beyond the simple long time delay robotics and move to a regime of virtual telepresence on the planet. One study of this concept, the Human Exploration using Real-time Robotic Operations (HERRO) concept, suggested that such a mission could be used to explore a wide variety of planetary destinations.

===Telepresence and videoconferencing===
The prevalence of high quality video conferencing using mobile devices, tablets and portable computers has enabled a drastic growth in telepresence robots to help give a better sense of remote physical presence for communication and collaboration in the office, home, school, etc. when one cannot be there in person. The robot avatar can move or look around at the command of the remote person.

There have been two primary approaches that both utilize videoconferencing on a display.
* Desktop telepresence robots typically mount a phone or tablet on a motorized desktop stand to enable the remote person to look around a remote environment by panning and tilting the display.
* Drivable telepresence robots typically contain a display (integrated or separate phone or tablet) mounted on a roaming base. More modern roaming telepresence robots may include an ability to operate autonomously. The robots can map out the space and be able to avoid obstacles while driving themselves between rooms and their docking stations.

Traditional videoconferencing systems and telepresence rooms generally offer pan-tilt-zoom cameras with far end control. The ability for the remote user to turn the device&#x27;s head and look around naturally during a meeting is often seen as the strongest feature of a telepresence robot. For this reason, the developers have emerged in the new category of desktop telepresence robots that concentrate on this strongest feature to create a much lower cost robot. The desktop telepresence robots, also called &quot;head-and-neck robots&quot; allow users to look around during a meeting and are small enough to be carried from location to location, eliminating the need for remote navigation.

Some telepresence robots are highly helpful for some children with long-term illnesses, who were unable to attend school regularly. Latest innovative technologies can bring people together, and it allows them to stay connected to each other, which significantly help them to overcome loneliness.

===Marine applications===
Marine remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are widely used to work in water too deep or too dangerous for divers. They repair offshore oil platforms and attach cables to sunken ships to hoist them. They are usually attached by a tether to a control center on a surface ship. The wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot; was explored by an ROV, as well as by a crew-operated vessel.

===Telemedicine===

Additionally, a lot of telerobotic research is being done in the field of medical devices, and minimally invasive surgical systems. With a robotic surgery system, a surgeon can work inside the body through tiny holes just big enough for the manipulator, with no need to open up the chest cavity to allow hands inside.

===Emergency Response and law enforcement robots===
NIST maintains a set of test standards used for Emergency Response and law enforcement telerobotic systems.

===Other applications===
Remote manipulators are used to handle radioactive materials.

Telerobotics has been used in installation art pieces; Telegarden is an example of a project where a robot was operated by users through the Web.

<doc id="305104" wikidata="Q2332420" url="?curid=305104" title="Super Socket 7">
<text>Super Socket 7, also referred to as Super 7, is a hardware-level extension of the Socket 7 ZIF socket specification for x86 processors. It was released in May 1998. Compatible motherboards and chipsets use a standard Socket 7 connection for the CPU, while adding certain features including a maximum 100 MHz front-side bus and support for AGP graphics cards.

Super Socket 7 was used by AMD K6-2 and K6-III processors, some of the final Cyrix M-II processors, some of the final IDT WinChip 2 processors, and Rise mP6 processors. It is backward compatible with Socket 7 CPUs, meaning a Socket 7 CPU can be used with a Super Socket 7 motherboard, but a Super Socket 7 CPU cannot operate at full speed in a Socket 7 motherboard. Socket 5 CPUs are pin-compatible with Super Socket 7, but not all motherboards designed for Super Socket 7 supported the voltages or bus speeds needed for Socket 5 CPUs.

While AMD had previously always used Intel sockets for their processors, Socket 7 was the last one for which AMD retained legal rights. Intel had hoped by discontinuing Socket 7 development and moving to Slot 1 that AMD would be left with an outdated platform, making their processors non-competitive. By extending the FSB from 66 to 100 MHz, Super Socket 7 gave AMD the stopgap solution they needed while developing their own independent motherboard infrastructure, Slot A.

While the architecture was cheap, and served the intended purpose, many of the third party chipsets provided by VIA, SiS, ALi, and others, were of low quality, especially with regard to the AGP implementations. The reputation AMD gained for buggy, incompatible motherboards lingered, and though an internal program by VIA to raise standards for their chipsets had begun to show results in the K6-III and Pentium III era, AMD put in place a quality assurance program for the Athlon processor.

<doc id="305106" wikidata="Q4561066" url="?curid=305106" title="1921 in Afghanistan">
<text>The following events happened during 1921 in Afghanistan.

==Incumbents==
* Monarch – Amanullah Khan

==Early January 1921==
Henry Dobbs arrives in Kabul to continue the conversations which were begun at Mussoorie in the previous year.

==Early 1921==
A mission of five members, headed by Gen. Mohammad Daoud Khan, leaves Afghanistan for Europe in order to examine the possibility of entering into political and commercial relations with European states. The mission visits Moscow, where in March it signs a Turco-Afghan treaty providing for mutual assistance between the two countries in case of attack by a third party. From Moscow it goes to Riga, and thence to Angora, in order to explain the treaty to the Turkish headquarters. The head of the mission there makes bitter Anglophobe speeches, and in an interview states that it is the duty of the entire Muslim world to help the Turkish nationalists.

==February 28, 1921==
A treaty between the Bolshevik government of Russia and the &quot;amir&quot; is signed. British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon states on one occasion that the Soviet government has offered the Afghans a subsidy of £100,000 a year.

==May 31, 1921==
Lord Chelmsford says in the House of Lords that he is confident the discussions at Kabul will have a salutary effect and produce valuable results. For a long time, however, they continue to hang fire. This is due to the leanings of the &quot;amir&quot; towards Russia and Turkey.

==June 5, 1921==
A son and heir is born to the &quot;amir&quot;.

==June 18, 1921==
The &quot;amir&quot; announces the completion of a code of criminal procedure with the effect, in his own words, of &quot;making Afghanistan truly free and independent&quot;.

==November 17, 1921==
The Afghan envoy at Angora gives a banquet in honour of Fakhri Pasha, who is leaving for Kabul, at which speeches extolling Islamic union are made.

==November 22, 1921==
A treaty (amending the Treaty of Rawalpindi agreed originally in August 1919) between the Britain and Afghanistan is signed at Kabul, on the Afghan government giving written assurances that no Russian consulates will be permitted in the areas adjoining the Indian frontier. The treaty reaffirms Britain&#x27;s recognition of Afghanistan&#x27;s complete independence, and restores to the Afghans the privilege of importing munitions through India. A small area near the head of the Khyber Pass is transferred to Afghanistan, and Sir Henry Dobbs carries out the realignment of the frontier on crossing over to India on December 4. King George V sends a message of congratulation to the &quot;amir&quot;, who telegraphs a reply expressing deep appreciation of His Majesty&#x27;s message, and hoping relations between the countries will grow closer.

<doc id="305107" wikidata="Q2002204" url="?curid=305107" title="White ribbon">
<text>The white ribbon is an awareness ribbon sometimes used by political movements to signify or spread their beliefs. It is usually worn on garments or represented in information sources such as posters, leaflets, etc.

The White Ribbon has been the badge of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union founded by Frances Willard since its founding in 1873. The WCTU claims to be the oldest continuing non-sectarian women&#x27;s organization worldwide. The white ribbon bow was selected to symbolize purity. The WCTU traditionally uses the bow rather than the more modern &quot;remembrance&quot; loop.

One of the most notable usages of the white ribbon in recent times is as the symbol of anti-violence against women, safe motherhood, and other related causes.

It also has a long tradition in state fairs and similar farming and horticultural competitions in the United States and Canada as a third-place ribbon.

==Anti-violence against women and gender justice movement==

After the École Polytechnique massacre on December 6, 1989, where 14 women were killed by an anti-feminist, a movement formed in Canada involving men wearing the white ribbon to signify opposition to violence against women.

The White Ribbon Campaign (WRC) appeared in 1991 in relation to this movement and became one of the largest men&#x27;s anti-violence programs in the world. Started by activists such as Michael Kaufman and Toronto politicians like the late New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton, it has now spread to over 57 countries around the world. It is now an international effort of men and boys working to end violence against women. Its basic principle is the importance of men and boys speaking out against all forms of violence against women. For that purpose, members of the WRC offer a variety of presentations and workshops on violence. In Canada, the campaign is run from November 25 (the International Day for the Eradication of Violence Against Women) until December 6, Canada&#x27;s National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. Other countries support 16 Days of Activism from November 25 until December 10, but campaigns can occur at any time of the year.

In 2014, A Voice for Men launched whiteribbon.org as a counter to the White Ribbon campaign. Accused of &quot;hijacking&quot; White Ribbon, the site was harshly criticized by Todd Minerson, executive director of The White Ribbon Campaign, who described it as &quot;a copycat campaign articulating their archaic views and denials about the realities of gender-based violence&quot;. According to the site, its purpose is to present the view that domestic violence is &quot;not a gendered problem&quot;. According to Cosmopolitan magazine, the site is used to display &quot;anti-feminist propaganda&quot;.

==Quebec peace movement==
In the beginning of 2003, a custom, largely influenced by the Échec à la guerre collective, emerged in Quebec of wearing the white ribbon to show a belief in the need for peace (mostly in opposition to the then-impending war in Iraq). The roots of the choice of the white ribbon are probably the traditional association of white with peace and the White Ribbon Campaign.

Premier Bernard Landry took to wearing the white ribbon and the other two main party leaders in Quebec, Jean Charest and Mario Dumont, followed suit.

==U.S. county and state fairs==
At county and state fairs in the United States, a white ribbon often denotes a third-place finish in a contest.

==2011–2013 Russian protests==
During the 2011–2013 Russian protests, the white ribbon emerged as a symbol of opposition and since the elections has picked up momentum. Many Russians have been tying it to their clothing, cars, and other objects, and the motif has appeared on runet and on Twitter. By 10 December, the TV Rain channel was showing a white ribbon by its on-screen logo. The station&#x27;s owner, Natalya Sindeyeva, explained this as being a sign of &quot;sincerity&quot;, rather than &quot;propaganda&quot;, and an attempt to be &quot;mediators&quot; instead of simply journalists. NTV described 10 December as the day of &quot;white ribbons&quot;. Vladimir Putin compared the white ribbons to condoms being used as a symbol of the fight against AIDS.

==Other uses/combined with other colors==
At the Streamy Awards of 2010, white ribbons were worn in support of net neutrality.

It also means friendship.

White ribbons are used to signify support for self-harmers (from people who are not self-harmers themselves), while white and orange ribbons represent self-harmers who are trying to quit or have succeeded in doing so already.

White ribbons are used for teen pregnancy prevention awareness.

White ribbons have also been used to protest child pornography. The white is supposed to signify the protection of innocence and purity.

White ribbons are used to promote awareness for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and SCID Newborn screening. Since 2001, when many SCID families met face-to-face for the first time, the white ribbon was used as a way to identify themselves to one another. White was the chosen color because it would honor all the SCID angels lost to this horrific disease. White ribbons continue to honor all those SCID angels and remind the world that SCID Newborn Screening is their legacy.

In 2019, the government of Catalonia changed a yellow ribbon on a banner on its headquarters building in Barcelona to a white ribbon in response to a ban by the national government of Spain on yellow ribbons on public buildings due to it being viewed as a political symbol (it is used there to call for release of political prisoners).

<doc id="305109" wikidata="Q203117" url="?curid=305109" title="Northeast Passage">
<text>The Northeast Passage (abbreviated as NEP; , ) is the shipping route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, along the Arctic coasts of Norway and Russia. The western route through the islands of Canada is accordingly called the Northwest Passage (NWP).

The NEP traverses (from west to east) the Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, East Siberian Sea, and Chukchi Sea, and it includes the Northern Sea Route (NSR). The Northern Sea Route is a portion of the NEP. It is defined in Russian law and does not include the Barents Sea and therefore does not reach the Atlantic Ocean. However, since the NSR has a significant overlap over the majority of the NEP, the NSR term is often used to refer to the entirety of the Northeast Passage. This practice injects confusion in understanding the specifics of both navigational procedures and jurisdiction.

The Northeast Passage is one of several Arctic maritime routes, the others being the Northwest Passage (going through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and the coast of Alaska) and the Transpolar Route (going across the North Pole).

The first confirmed complete passage, from west to east, was made by the Finland-Swedish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, with the Swedish ship &quot;Vega&quot; 1878–79 backed by the royal funding of king Oscar II of Sweden. Nordenskiöld was forced to winter just a few days&#x27; sailing distance from the Bering Strait, due to pack ice.

==History==

===11th to 17th centuries===
The motivation to navigate the Northeast passage was initially economic. In Russia, the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans was first proposed by the diplomat Gerasimov in 1525. However, Russian settlers and traders on the coast of the White Sea, the Pomors, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.

During a sail across the Barents Sea in search of the Northeast Passage in 1553, English explorer Hugh Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called Willoughby&#x27;s Land were shown on maps published by Plancius and Mercator in the 1590s, and they continued to appear on maps by Jan Janssonius and Willem Blaeu into the 1640s.

By the 17th century, traders had established a continuous sea route from Arkhangelsk to the Yamal Peninsula, where they portaged to the Gulf of Ob. This route, known as the &quot;Mangazeya seaway&quot;, after its eastern terminus, the trade depot of Mangazeya, was an early precursor to the Northern Sea Route.

East of the Yamal, the route north of the Taimyr Peninsula proved impossible or impractical. East of the Taimyr, from the 1630s, Russians began to sail the Arctic coast from the mouth of the Lena River to a point beyond the mouth of the Kolyma River. Both Vitus Bering (in 1728) and James Cook (in 1778) entered the Bering Strait from the south and sailed some distance northwest, but from 1648 (Semyon Dezhnev) to 1879 (Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld) no one is recorded as having sailed eastward between the Kolyma and Bering Strait.
The western parts of the passage were explored by northern European countries such as England, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway, looking for an alternative seaway to China and India; had it proved practicable, such a seaway would have had enormous economic and military importance. Although these expeditions failed, new coasts and islands were discovered. The most notable was the 1596 expedition led by Dutch navigator Willem Barentsz, who discovered Spitsbergen and Bear Island, and rounded the north end of Novaya Zemlya.

Fearing English and Dutch penetration into Siberia, Russia closed the Mangazeya seaway in 1619. Pomor activity in Northern Asia declined and most Arctic exploration in the 17th century was carried out by Siberian Cossacks, sailing from one river mouth to another in their Arctic-worthy &quot;kochs&quot;. In 1648, the most famous of these expeditions, led by Fedot Alekseev and Semyon Dezhnev, sailed east from the mouth of the Kolyma River to the Pacific Ocean, and rounded the Chukchi Peninsula, thus proving that no land connection existed between Asia and North America.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Eighty years after Dezhnev, in 1728, another Russian explorer, Danish-born Vitus Bering on &quot;Svyatoy Gavriil&quot; (Saint Gabriel) made a similar voyage in reverse, starting in Kamchatka and going north to the passage that now bears his name; the Bering Strait. It was Bering who named the Diomede Islands, which Dezhnev had vaguely mentioned.

Bering&#x27;s explorations of 1725–30 were part of a larger scheme of Peter the Great, known as the &quot;Great Northern Expedition&quot;.

The &quot;Second Kamchatka Expedition&quot; took place in 1735–42, with two ships, &quot;Svyatoy Pyotr&quot; (Saint Peter) and &quot;Svyatoy Pavel&quot; (Saint Paul), the latter commanded by Bering&#x27;s deputy in the first expedition, Captain Aleksey Chirikov. During the Second Expedition Bering became the first Westerner to sight the coast of northwestern North America, and Chirikov was the first Westerner to land there (a storm had separated the two ships earlier). On his return leg, Bering discovered the Aleutian Islands but fell ill, and &quot;Svyatoy Pyotr&quot; had to take shelter on an island off Kamchatka, where Bering died (Bering Island).

Independent of Bering and Chirikov, other Russian Imperial Navy parties took part in the Second Great Northern Expedition. One of these, led by Semyon Chelyuskin, in May 1742 reached Cape Chelyuskin, the northernmost point of both the Northeast Passage and the Eurasian continent.

Later expeditions to explore the Northeast Passage took place in the 1760s (Vasiliy Chichagov), 1785–95 (Joseph Billings and Gavril Sarychev), the 1820s and 1830s (Baron Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel, Pyotr Fyodorovich Anjou, Count Fyodor Litke and others). The possibility of navigating the length of the passage was proven by the mid-19th century.

However, it was only in 1878-79 that Fenno-Swedish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld (born in Finland but exiled to Sweden many years before the expedition) made the first complete passage of the Northeast Passage, leading the Vega expedition from west to east. The ship&#x27;s captain on this expedition was Lieutenant Louis Palander of the Swedish Royal Navy.

One year before Nordenskiöld&#x27;s voyage, commercial exploitation of a section of the route started with the so-called &quot;Kara expeditions&quot;, exporting Siberian agricultural produce via the Kara Sea. Of 122 convoys between 1877 and 1919 only 75 succeeded, transporting as little as 55 tons of cargo. From 1911 the Kolyma River steamboats ran from Vladivostok to the Kolyma once a year.
In 1912, two Russian expeditions set out; Captain Georgy Brusilov and the Brusilov Expedition in the &quot;Santa Anna&quot;, and Captain Alexander Kuchin with Vladimir Rusanov in the &quot;Gerkules&quot; (Hercules); each with a woman on board. Both expeditions were hastily arranged, and both disappeared. The German Arctic Expedition of 1912, led by Herbert Schröder-Stranz, ended disastrously with only 7 of 15 crew members surviving the preliminary expedition to Nordaustlandet.

In 1913 Jonas Lied organized a successful expedition through the Kara Sea to the Yenisei. Explorer and scientist Fridtjof Nansen and Siberian industrialist Stephan Vostrotin were prominent passengers. Lied had founded The Siberian company with the purpose of exporting and importing goods through the great Siberian rivers and the Kara Sea. The 1913 trip is recorded in Nansen&#x27;s &quot;Through Siberia&quot;.

In 1915, a Russian expedition led by Boris Vilkitskiy made the passage from east to west with the icebreakers &quot;Taymyr&quot; and &quot;Vaygach&quot;.

Nordenskiöld, Nansen, Amundsen, DeLong, Makarov and others also led expeditions, mainly for scientific and cartographic purposes.

===After the Russian Revolution===
The introduction of radio, steamboats, and icebreakers made running the Northern Sea Route viable. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was isolated from the western powers, which made it imperative to use this route. Besides being the shortest seaway between the western and far eastern USSR, it was the only one that lay completely inside Soviet internal waters and did not impinge on waters of opposing countries.

In 1932, a Soviet expedition on the icebreaker &quot;A. Sibiryakov&quot; led by Professor Otto Yulievich Schmidt was the first to sail all the way from Arkhangelsk to the Bering Strait in the same summer without wintering en route. After trial runs in 1933 and 1934, the &quot;Northern Sea Route&quot; was officially defined and open and commercial exploitation began in 1935. The next year, part of the Baltic Fleet made the passage to the Pacific where armed conflict with Japan was looming.

A special governing body &quot;Glavsevmorput&quot; (Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route) was set up in 1932, with Otto Schmidt as its director. It supervised navigation and built Arctic ports.

During the early part of World War II, the Soviets allowed the German auxiliary cruiser &quot;Komet&quot; to use the Northern Sea Route in the summer of 1940 to evade the British Royal Navy and break out into the Pacific Ocean. &quot;Komet&quot; was escorted by Soviet icebreakers during her journey. After the start of the Soviet-German War, the Soviets transferred several destroyers from the Pacific Fleet to the Northern Fleet via the Arctic. The Soviets also used the Northern Sea Route to transfer materials from the Soviet Far East to European Russia, and the Germans launched Operation Wunderland to interdict this traffic.

A convoy of seven brand-new merchant vessels (900 DWT to 5500 DWT) built for the People&#x27;s Republic of China but sailing under the Polish flag from Gdynia, reached the port of Pevek (via the Kara, Vilkitsky, Dmitry Laptev and Sannikov Straits), two days of navigation before the Bering Strait in 1956. 

In July 1965, USCGC &quot;Northwind&quot; (WAGB-282), commanded by Captain Kingdrel N. Ayers USCG, conducted an oceanographic survey between Greenland, Iceland, and Scotland and was the first western vessel to operate in the Kara Sea of the Soviet Union, for which she received the Coast Guard Unit Commendation with Operational Distinguishing Device. The real (then-classified) mission of &quot;Northwind&quot; was to attempt a transit of the &quot;Northeast Passage&quot;. The effort was not successful due to diplomatic reasons and caused an international incident between the U.S.S.R. and U.S.A.

===After the Soviet Union===
After the Soviet Union dissolved in the early 1990s, commercial navigation in the Siberian Arctic went into decline. Regular shipping is found only from Murmansk to Dudinka in the west and between Vladivostok and Pevek in the east. Ports between Dudinka and Pevek see virtually no shipping. Logashkino and Nordvik were abandoned and are now ghost towns.

Renewed interest led to several demonstration voyages in 1997 including the passage of the Finnish product tanker &quot;Uikku&quot;.

A January 2013 &quot;Reuters News&quot; report on expanding Russian arctic natural gas shipments to Asia, stated that while shipping traffic on the NSR surged in 2012 to around 1 million tons of various kinds of cargoes, &quot;it pales by comparison with the 1987 peak of 6.6 million tons.&quot; It also reported that the Finnish crude oil tanker &quot;Uikku&quot; was the first non-Russian energy vessel to brave the NSR in 1997.

Now the NSR is developing rapidly. In 2021 85 ships with around 2.75m tons of cargo made their way along the NSR, only 12 of which were under the Russian flag.

==Northern Sea Route==

A similar route to the NEP is the Northern Sea Route (NSR). The NSR is a shipping route that administratively begins at the boundary between the Barents and Kara Seas (the Kara Strait) and ends in the Bering Strait (Cape Dezhnev). The length of the Northern Sea Route from the Kara Gates to Provideniya Bay is about 5600 km. The distance from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok through the NSR is over 14 thousand km (for comparison, the same distance through the Suez Canal is over 23 thousand km). The Northern Sea Route serves the Arctic ports and major rivers of Siberia by importing fuel, equipment, food and exporting timber and minerals. The Suez or Panama Canal are the alternatives to the Northern Sea Route. However, if the distance from the port of Murmansk (Russia) to the port of Yokohama (Japan) through the Suez Canal is 12,840 nautical miles, the same itinerary along the Northern Sea Route equals only 5,770 nautical miles. 

Therefore, the NEP encompasses all the East Arctic seas, and the NSR all the seas except the Barents Sea. Since the NSR constitutes the majority of the NEP, sometimes the term NSR has been used to refer to the entirety of the NEP.

==Governance==
The governance of the NEP has developed considerably in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The main sources of governance are the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Arctic Council (AC), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the domestic legislation of the Russian Federation. In combination, they cover territorial claims, economic exploitation, technical shipping requirements, environmental protection, and search and rescue responsibilities.

For example, Rosatom assumes the possibility and functions of the NSR. Rosatom is a state corporation that organizes the navigation of vessels in the waters of the NSR in accordance with the Merchant Shipping Code, manages a fleet of powerful nuclear icebreakers, ensures the safety and uninterrupted operation of navigation, provides port services for gas tankers in case of unfavorable weather conditions. Rosatom also provides navigation and hydrographic support in the waters of the Northern Sea Route, develops the infrastructure of sea harbors, and manages the state property of these ports. For this purpose, the Directorate of the Northern Sea Route was formed, that now manages three subordinate organizations &quot;Atomflot&quot; (ROSATOMFLOT), &quot;Hydrographic Enterprise&quot; and &quot;ChukotAtomEnergo&quot;.

Recently, the &quot;Main Directorate of the Northern Sea Route&quot; (&quot;Glavsevmorput&quot;) was established on the basis of the Naval Operations Headquarters of FSUE “Atomflot”. The main purpose of the creation of the Glavsevmorput is to organize the navigation of vessels in the waters of the Northern Sea Route. Glavsevmorput Federal State Budgetary Institution solves the following tasks: ensuring the organization of icebreaking vessels taking into account the hydrometeorological, ice, and navigation conditions in the waters of the NSR; vessels navigation in the waters of the NSR; issuance, suspension, renewal, and termination of permits for sailing vessels in the waters of the NSR. To solve these tasks, the department arranges icebreaker fleet vessels in the waters of the NSR, monitors the traffic in the NSR water area, provides information on hydrometeorological, ice, and navigation conditions, and processes information from vessels located in the NSR water area. Rosatom is a Legacy Member of the Arctic Economic Council, that’s why all the operations are aimed to establish economic well-being, environmental neutrality, and human capital development.

==Pacific-Atlantic distances==
The Northeast Passage is a shorter route to connect Northeast Asia with Western Europe, compared to the existing routes through the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, or around the Cape of Good Hope. The table below shows the sailing distances between the major East Asia sea ports, and Rotterdam in Europe (these distances assume no route diversions owing to ice conditions).

===Commercial value===
A usable Northern Sea Route between northern Europe and North Pacific ports would cut time at sea (and resultant fuel consumption) by more than half. For the corporate players in bulk shipping of relative low-value raw materials, cost savings for fuel may appear as a driver to explore the Northern Sea Route for commercial transits, and not necessarily reduced lead time. The Northern Sea Route allows economies of scale compared to coastal route alternatives, with vessel draught and beam limitation. Environmental demands faced by the maritime shipping industry may emerge as a driver for developing the Northern Sea Route. Increased awareness of environmental benefits and costs for both the Northern Sea Route and Suez routes will probably be important factors in this respect.

In 2011, four ships sailed the length of the Northern Sea Route and Northeast Passage, from the Atlantic to Pacific Oceans. In 2012, 46 ships sailed the NSR.

In August 2012, Russian media reported that 85% of vessels transiting the Northern Sea Route in 2011 were carrying gas or oil, and 80% were high-capacity tankers.

As the Northern Sea Route is a strategically important transport artery, it can already be called economically profitable in comparison, for example, with the Suez Canal due to a number of reasons:
*Fuel savings due to reduced distance;
*The shorter distance reduces the cost of staff labor and chartering vessels;
*The Northern Sea Route does not charge payments for the passage (unlike, for example, the Suez Canal);
*There are no queues (unlike, for example, the Suez Canal);
*There is no risk of a pirate attack.

===Environmental concerns===
In September 2012, Inuit Circumpolar Conference Chair Jimmy Stotts was reported as saying there is concern that increased shipping could adversely affect indigenous hunting of marine mammals. Also concerning is the lack of infrastructure on the Western Alaska coast to deal with a spill or a wrecked vessel.

However, a polar opinion also does exist. The Northern Sea route is considerably shorter than the existing sea routes from Asia to Europe, which makes it more ecological due to less consumption of . A usable Northern Sea Route between northern Europe and North Pacific ports would cut time at sea (and, accordingly, fuel consumption) by more than half. For the corporate players in bulk shipping of relative low-value raw materials, cost savings for fuel may appear as a driver to explore the Northern Sea Route for commercial transits, and not necessarily reduced lead time. The Northern Sea Route allows economies of scale compared to coastal route alternatives, with vessel draught and beam limitation. Environmental demands faced by the maritime shipping industry may emerge as a driver for developing the Northern Sea Route.

According to the Fourth IMO GHG Study 2020, sea cargo transportation is responsible for 2.9% of global emissions. More than that, in the next 20 years the trading maritime volume is expected to double, which may cause even worse consequences for the environment. Now marine transport produces about 1 gigaton of carbon dioxide () emissions per year and has been struggling for many years to reduce its environmental impact. For example, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has obliged sea carriers to reduce emissions by 50% by 2050. It may seem very realistic, but achieving this result may become a tough challenge. Firstly, marine transport generates 14% of all transport emissions, and, secondly, effective techniques that could replace marine engines powered by fossil fuels do not exist yet. Due to its shorter length, navigation on the NSR contributes to reducing the carbon footprint of maritime transport thus contributing to the achievement of the Paris Agreement goals.

==Ice conditions==

Unlike the similar latitudes in Alaska and Canada (along the Northwest Passage), parts of the NEP remain ice-free year-round. This is mostly the case of the Barents Sea, by the northern coast of Norway and Northwestern coast of Russia. The Barents sea is affected by the currents of warm water from the Gulf Stream, feeding into the North Atlantic.

Other parts of the NEP (mostly the NSR part), freeze in winter and partially melt in the summer months, especially along the coasts. Since the early 2000s the summer melting has been stronger, and the winter freezing has been weaker, opening the waters to the possibility of more non-ice breaking ships taking advantage of the route for longer periods of time.

===Ice-free ports===

Only one Russian seaport in the Barents Sea along the officially defined Northern Sea Route (which begins at the Kara Gates Strait) is ice-free year-round, Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula. Other Arctic ports are generally usable from July to October, or, such as Dudinka, are served by nuclear-powered icebreakers. Beyond the Bering Strait, the end of the Northern Sea Route, and south along Russia&#x27;s Pacific seaboard Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka, Vanino, Nakhodka, and Vladivostok are accessible year-round.

The development of the icebreaking fleet is the most important condition for constant navigation in Arctic waters. Since 2008, the structure of Rosatom includes the Russian nuclear icebreaker fleet, which is the largest in the world with a container ship, four service vessels and seven nuclear-powered icebreakers (“Yamal”, &quot;50 Let Pobedy&quot;, &quot;Taymyr&quot;, &quot;Vaygach&quot;, &quot;Arctic&quot;, &quot;Siberia&quot; and Ural). The last three are the latest universal icebreakers of the 22220 project, and the world&#x27;s only transport vessel with the Sevmorput nuclear power plant in operation.

==Transit shipping activity==
Due to its harsh climatic conditions and the low population density, the NEP has had relatively little activity. The NSR portion of the NEP experienced its highest levels of activity during the Soviet era. The NSR greatly developed as a heavily subsidized domestic route, with traffic peaking in 1987 with 6.58 million tons of cargo carried by 331 ships over 1306 voyages. With the end of the Soviet Union and its subsidies, the NSR traffic collapsed to 1.5–2 M tons of cargo.

Since the early 2000s, the thickness and area extent of the Arctic sea ice has experienced significant reduction, compared to the recorded averages. This has led to an increase in transit shipping. In 2011, four ships sailed the entire length of the NEP, 46 in 2012, and 19 in 2013. The number of trips is still very small compared to the thousands of ships each year through the Suez Canal. Mainstream container shipping is expected to continue to overwhelmingly use the Suez route, while niche activities like bulk shipping is expected to grow, driven by the mining industries of the Arctic.

Nevertheless, the cargo traffic is steadily growing every year. The research shows that the NSR-SCR combined shipping scheme can be more competitive than the use of the Suez Canal Route only. If the shipping company provides sufficient loading on the NSR, uses a reliable ice-class vessel for navigation and the price of crude oil is high, the economic advantage of the NSR-SCR combined shipping scheme is obvious. Ice thickness directly affects the shipping cost. Now, when the Arctic ice is slowly melting due to weather conditions, the cost of icebreaking service is expected to reduce. Also, vessels of some ice classes can sail on the NSR independently. That is why the NSR icebreaker escort fee may be several times lower than the SCR toll.

State Corporation Rosatom assumes the possibility and functions of the NSR and ensures the safety of navigation on the high technological level. Besides organizing the navigation along the NSR and the icebreaking services with the world&#x27;s only nuclear icebreaker fleet, Rosatom is planning to implement the Arctic Ice Regime Shipping System (AIRSS) methodology. This system will represent a digital space that will provide various services to cargo carriers, shipowners, captains, insurers, and other participants in the logistics market on the NSR. In particular, it involves issuing permits for the passage of vessels, monitoring, dispatching, and managing the work of the fleet. The single digital platform will collect information from all the available sources, for example, hydrometeorological data, the location of ships and icebreakers, port congestion. As a result, users will receive an advanced &quot;ice navigator&quot; that will allow to plot a precise route in view of the changing ice conditions of the NSR. In other words, the study of Sibul et al. proposed a path-finding algorithm for the NSR strategic assessment. It uses real weather as input and find the optimal shipping route. 

===Ice-free navigation===

The term &quot;ice free&quot; generally refers to the absence of fast ice, i.e. continuously frozen surface ice sheet cover. Under common usage &quot;ice free&quot; does not mean that there is no Arctic sea ice. &quot;Ice free&quot; regions can contain broken ice cover of varying density, often still requiring appropriately strengthened hulls or icebreaker support for safe passage.

French sailor Eric Brossier made the first passage by sailboat in only one season in the summer of 2002. He returned to Europe the following summer through the Northwest Passage.

The same year Arved Fuchs and its crew sailed the Northeast Passage with the &quot;Dagmar Aaen&quot;.

The Northern Sea Route was opened by receding ice in 2005 but was closed by 2007. The amount of polar ice had receded to 2005 levels in August 2008. In late August 2008, it was reported that images from the NASA Aqua satellite had revealed that the last ice blockage of the Northern Sea Route in the Laptev Sea had melted. This would have been the first time since satellite records began that both the Northwest Passage and Northern Sea Route had been open simultaneously. However, other scientists suggested that the satellite images may have been misread and that the sea route was not yet passable.

In 2009, the Bremen-based Beluga Group claimed they were the first Western company to attempt to cross the Northern Sea Route for shipping without assistance from icebreakers, cutting 4000 nautical miles off the journey between Ulsan, Korea and Rotterdam. The voyage was widely covered and sometimes incorrectly said to be the first time that non-Russian ships made the transit. In 1997, a Finnish oil tanker, &quot;Uikku&quot;, sailed the length of the Northern Sea Route from Murmansk to the Bering Strait, becoming the first Western ship to complete the voyage.

However, the new (2008) ice-strengthened heavy lift vessels &quot;Beluga Fraternity&quot; and &quot;Beluga Foresight&quot; commenced an East-to-West passage of the Northern Sea Route in August 2009
as part of a small convoy escorted by the Russian nuclear icebreaker &quot;NS 50 Let Pobedy&quot;, westward through the Bering, Sannikov, and Vilkitskiy Straits. The two vessels embarked Russian ice pilots for the voyage to the western Siberian port of Novyy, in the Yamburg region in the delta of the Ob River. The ships arrived at Novyy on 7 September, discharged their cargo to barges and departed on 12 September, bound for the Kara Gates and Rotterdam. They were the first non-Russian commercial vessels to complete this journey, but not without Russian assistance. The captain of the &quot;Beluga Foresight&quot;, Valeriy Durov, described the achievement as &quot;...great news for our industry.&quot; The president of Beluga Shipping claimed the voyage saved each vessel about 300,000 euros, compared to the normal Korea-to-Rotterdam route by way of the Suez Canal. The company did not disclose how much they paid for the escort service and the Russian pilots. An 18 September 2009 press release stated that the company was planning for six vessels to make Arctic deliveries in 2010. It is not clear that this plan was followed up on.

In 2009, the first two international commercial cargo vessels traveled north of Russia between Europe and Asia. In 2011, 18 ships made the now mostly ice-free transit. During 2011, 34 ships made the transit up from a total of 6 ships in 2010. In 2012, 46 commercial ships made the transit. Petroleum products constituted the largest cargo group. In 2013 71 commercial ships made the transit.

On 28 July 2009, the sailing yacht RX II (36-foot length), with expedition leader Trond Aasvoll and crew Hans Fredrik Haukland and Finn Andreassen left Vardø in Norway on a quest to circumnavigate the North Pole. The northern sea route proved ice free and the three Norwegians sailed into the Bering Strait on 24 September. But Russian bureaucracy managed to do what the arctic waters didn&#x27;t – to stop their effort to sail around in one season. The boat over-wintered in Nome, and finished the trip through the Northwest passage the following summer.

Also in 2009, Ola Skinnarmo and his crew sailed the Northeast Passage aboard &quot;Explorer of Sweden&quot;, becoming the second Swedish sailboat to transit the Northeast Passage, after Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld.

In September 2010, two yachts circumnavigated the Arctic: Børge Ousland&#x27;s team aboard &quot;The Northern Passage&quot;, and Sergei Murzayev&#x27;s team in the &quot;Peter I&quot;. These were the first recorded instances of the circumnavigation of the Arctic by sailing yachts in one season.

The largest ship as of 2011 is the 117,000 tonne SCF Baltica loaded with natural-gas condensate.

In 2012, the LNG carrier &quot;Ob River&quot; became the first ship of its kind to transit the Northern Sea Route. The vessel completed the westbound voyage in ballast in only six days and planned to sail back to Asia in November with a full load of liquified natural gas. The growth in traffic has been startling. 46 ships sailed the entire length from Europe to East Asia during 2012. By July 2013, the administrators of the Northern Sea Route had granted permission to 204 ships to sail during the season. By that time, Arctic sea ice had declined substantial especially on the Atlantic side of the Arctic. &quot;On July 15 extent came within 540,000 square kilometers (208,000 square miles) of that seen in 2012 on the same date... (Compared to the 1981 to 2010 average, ice extent on July 15, 2013 was 1.06 million square kilometers (409,000 square miles) below average.)&quot; (Summer 2012 Arctic sea ice volume reached a record low.)

During early September 2013 the Russian battlecruiser &quot;Petr Velikiy&quot; led a flotilla of Russian navy ships with icebreaker support along the Northern Sea Route to the New Siberian Islands. About 400 ships were expected to transit the Russian portion of the route during the 2013 season, up from about 40 during 2012.

On 15 September 2015, the Chinese trimaran &quot;Qingdao China&quot; set a speed record by sailing from Murmansk to the Bering Strait in 13 days.

On 3 October 2019 Nanni Acquarone became the first Italian skipper with the Italian cutter &quot;Best Explorer&quot; to sail both Northwest Passage in 2012 and Northeast Passage with a sailboat clockwise. Best Explorer started 1 June 2012 from Tromsø (Norway) sailing the Northwest Passage (first Italian boat and Italian skipper) and after several years of sailing in the Pacific got the permission to follow the Northeast Passage without assistance and without a Russian on board with a crew of 5, including Salvatore Magri who sailed the Northwest Passage with Nanni. In 2019 Best Explorer left Petropavlovsk Kamchatski on 3 August and crossed the Bering Strait on 19 August reaching Murmansk on 22 September.

==Commemoration==
In 2007, Finland issued a €10 Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld and Northeast Passage commemorative coin to celebrate the 175th anniversary of Nordenskiöld&#x27;s birth and his discovery of the northern sea route. The obverse features an abstract portrait of Nordenskiöld at the helm of his ship. The reverse is dominated by a pattern resembling the labyrinth formed by adjacent ice floes. The coin is one of the Europa Coins 2007 series, which celebrates European achievements in history.

<doc id="305113" wikidata="Q163138" url="?curid=305113" title="The Creation (Haydn)">
<text>The Creation () is an oratorio written in 1797 and 1798 by Joseph Haydn (Hob. XXI:2), and considered by many to be one of his masterpieces. The oratorio depicts and celebrates the creation of the world as narrated in the Book of Genesis.

The libretto was written by Gottfried van Swieten. The work is structured in three parts and scored for soprano, tenor and bass soloists, chorus and a symphonic orchestra. In parts I and II, depicting the creation, the soloists represent the archangels Raphael (bass), Uriel (tenor) and Gabriel (soprano). In part III, the bass and soprano represent Adam and Eve.

The first public performance was held in Vienna at the old Burgtheater on 19 March 1799. The oratorio was published with the text in German and English in 1800.

== Inspiration ==

Haydn was inspired to write a large oratorio during his visits to England in 1791–1792 and 1794–1795 when, alongside his close friend English music historian Charles Burney, he heard oratorios of George Frideric Handel performed by large forces. It is likely that Haydn wanted to try to achieve results of comparable weight, using the musical language of the mature classical style. Among the Handel works Haydn heard was &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot;, which includes various episodes of tone painting, perhaps an inspiration to Haydn&#x27;s own pervasive use of this device in &quot;The Creation&quot;.

== Libretto ==
The text of &quot;The Creation&quot; has a long history. The three sources are Genesis, the Biblical book of Psalms, and John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. In 1795, when Haydn was leaving England, the impresario Johann Peter Salomon (1745–1815) who had arranged his concerts there handed him a new poem entitled &quot;The Creation of the World&quot;. This original had been offered to Handel, but the old master had not worked on it, as its wordiness meant that it would have been four hours in length when set to music. The libretto was probably passed on to Salomon by Thomas Linley Sr. (1733–1795), a Drury Lane oratorio concert director. Linley (sometimes called Lidley or Liddel) himself could have written this original English libretto, but scholarship by Edward Olleson, A. Peter Brown (who prepared a particularly fine &quot;authentic&quot; score) and H. C. Robbins Landon, tells us that the original writer remains anonymous.
When Haydn returned to Vienna, he turned this libretto over to Baron Gottfried van Swieten, who led a multifaceted career as diplomat, director of the Imperial Library, amateur musician, and patron of musicians including Mozart and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. He had already collaborated with Haydn as librettist, editing the text for the oratorio version of &quot;The Seven Last Words of Christ&quot;, premiered in Vienna in 1786. Swieten recast the English libretto of &quot;The Creation&quot; in a German translation (&quot;Die Schöpfung&quot;) that Haydn could use to compose. He also made suggestions to Haydn regarding the setting of individual numbers. The work was published bilingually (1800) and is still performed in both languages.

For the quotations from the Bible, Swieten chose to adhere very closely to the English King James Version. According to Nicholas Temperley, &quot;the German text corresponds to no known German Bible translation. Instead, it is so constructed that the word order, syllabification, and stress patterns are as close as possible to the English. Haydn and Swieten must have realized that English audiences would not easily accept changes in the hallowed text of their Bible; and there were the formidable precedents of &quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot; to bear in mind.&quot;

In the final form of the oratorio, the text is structured as recitative passages of the text of Genesis, often set to minimal accompaniment, interspersed with choral and solo passages setting Swieten&#x27;s original poetry to music. Swieten incorporated excerpts from Psalms for choral movements.
Van Swieten was evidently not a fully fluent speaker of English, and the metrically matched English version of the libretto suffers from awkward phrasing that fails to fit idiomatic English text onto Haydn&#x27;s music. For example, one passage describing the freshly minted Adam&#x27;s forehead ended up, &quot;The large and arched front sublime/of wisdom deep declares the seat&quot;. Since publication, numerous attempts at improvement have been made, but many performances in English-speaking countries avoid the problem by performing in the original German. The discussion below quotes the German text as representing van Swieten&#x27;s best efforts, with fairly literal renderings of the German into English; for the full versions of both texts see the links at the end of this article.

== Premiere and reception history ==
The first performances in 1798 were mounted by the Gesellschaft der Associierten, a group of music-loving noblemen organized by van Swieten to sponsor concerts of serious music; the Gesellschaft paid the composer handsomely for the right to stage the premiere (Salomon briefly threatened to sue, on grounds that the English libretto had been translated illegally). The performance was delayed until late April—the parts were not finished until Good Friday—but the completed work was rehearsed before a full audience on April 29.

The first performance the next day was a private affair, but hundreds of people crowded into the street around the old Schwarzenberg Palace at the New Market to hear this eagerly anticipated work. Admission was by invitation only. Those invited included wealthy patrons of the arts, high government officials, prominent composers and musicians, and a sprinkling of the nobility of several countries; the common folk, who would have to wait for later occasions to hear the new work, so crowded the streets near the palace that some 30 special police were needed to keep order. Many of those lucky enough to be inside wrote glowing accounts of the piece. In a letter to the &quot;Neue teutsche Merkur&quot;, one audience member wrote, &quot;Already three days have passed since that happy evening, and it still sounds in my ears and heart, and my breast is constricted by many emotions even thinking of it.&quot;

The first public performance at Vienna&#x27;s old Burgtheater at the Michaelerplatz on 19 March 1799 was sold out far in advance, and &quot;Die Schöpfung&quot; was performed nearly forty more times in the city during Haydn&#x27;s life. The work became a favourite of the Tonkünstler-Societät, a charitable organization for the support of widows and orphans of musicians, for which Haydn frequently conducted the work, often with very large ensembles, throughout the remainder of his career. &quot;The Creation&quot; had its London premiere in 1800, using its English text, at Covent Garden. Napoleon an avid admirer of the composer, attended its Paris premiere on 24 December 1800; on the way there, he narrowly escaped a bomb intended to assassinate the then First Consul.
The last performance Haydn attended was on March 27, 1808, just a year before he died: the aged and ill Haydn was carried in with great honour on an armchair. According to one account, the audience broke into spontaneous applause at the coming of &quot;light&quot; and Haydn, in a typical gesture, weakly pointed upwards and said: &quot;Not from me—everything comes from up there!&quot;

&quot;The Creation&quot; was also performed more than forty times outside Vienna during his life: elsewhere in Austria and Germany, throughout England, and in Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Russia and the United States. Despite the eclipse in Haydn&#x27;s reputation as a composer in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the work never left the repertoire during this time, and today it is frequently performed by both professional and amateur ensembles. There are many recordings.

A typical performance lasts about one hour and 45 minutes.

== Music ==
=== Musical forces ===

The oratorio is scored for three vocal soloists (soprano, tenor, and bass; there is also an incidental solo for alto in the finale), four-part chorus (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), and a large Classical orchestra consisting of the following:

* Flute I II (a third flute in no. 29)
* Oboe I II
* Clarinet I II (in C &amp; B-flat)
* Bassoon I II
* Contrabassoon
* Horn I II (in B-flat basso &amp; alto, C, D, E-flat, E, F, A)
* Trumpet I II (in D, C &amp; B-flat)
* Trombone I II III
* Timpani
* Violin I II
* Viola
* Violoncello
* Bass
* Continuo

There seems little doubt that Haydn wanted a big sound (by the standard of his day) for his work. Between the private premieres for nobles and the public premiere in 1799, Haydn added extra instrumental parts to the work. The forces for the public premiere numbered about 120 instrumentalists and 60 singers.

In Parts I and II of the work, the three soloists represent angels who narrate and comment on the successive six days of creation: Gabriel (soprano), Uriel (tenor), and Raphael (bass). Part III introduces as characters the first man and first woman of the Bible, Adam and Eve, during the time they spent in the Garden of Eden before the Fall. Adam, a bass role, is usually sung by the same soloist that sings Raphael, and the soprano role of Eve is usually sung by the same soloist who sings Gabriel. This was the practice Haydn followed, but some conductors prefer to cast each of the five roles with a different soloist.

The choral singers are employed in a series of monumental choruses, several of them celebrating the end of one particular day of creation.

The orchestra often plays alone, notably in the episodes of tone painting: the appearance of the Sun, the creation of various beasts, and above all in the overture, the famous depiction of the Chaos before the creation.

=== Structure ===
The oratorio is structured in three parts. The first deals with the creation of light, of heaven and Earth, of the Sun and Moon, of the land and water, and of plants. The second treats the creation of the animals, and of man and woman. The final part describes Adam and Eve during their happy time in the Garden of Eden, portraying an idealized love in harmony with the &quot;new world&quot;.

The oratorio is described below, for each part by both a table of the movements and description of individual movements. As in other oratorios, the larger musical numbers (arias and choruses) are often prefaced with a brief recitative; here, the recitative gives the actual words of Genesis, while the following number elaborates the bare Biblical narrative in verse. Choral movements are highlighted in a different background colour.

=== Part I ===

Part I celebrates the creation of the primal light, the Earth, the heavenly bodies, bodies of water, weather, and plant life.

. Die Vorstellung des Chaos (The Representation of Chaos)
One of the most famous numbers in the work, an overture in C minor in slow tempo, written in sonata form. Haydn depicts Chaos by withholding musical cadences from the ends of phrases.

No. 1. Im Anfange schuf Gott Himmel und Erde (In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth)

This movement relates the words of Genesis 1:1–4. It begins with a recitative for bass solo in C minor, followed by choral presentation of the creation of light. The latter is depicted first with a soft pizzicato note from the strings, followed by a sudden surprise fortissimo C major chord on the word &quot;Licht&quot; (Light).

This moment created a sensation when the work was first played in public. According to a friend of the composer/:
At that moment when light broke out for the first time, one would have said that rays darted from the composer&#x27;s burning eyes. The enchantment of the electrified Viennese was so general that the orchestra could not proceed for some minutes.
Following the appearance of light is a brief tenor recitative on the words &quot;and God saw the light, that it was good&quot;, leading into:
No. 2. Nun schwanden vor dem heiligen Strahle
(Now vanished by the holy beams)

Aria for tenor with chorus in A major, portraying the defeat of Satan&#x27;s host, from &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

&quot;End of the first day.&quot;
No. 3. Und Gott machte das Firmament

Long recitative for bass in C major. The bass part first gives the words of Genesis 1:6–7, then follows orchestral tone painting, describing the division of the waters from the land and the first storms.
No. 4. Mit Staunen sieht das Wunderwerk
(The marv&#x27;lous work beholds amazed/The glorious hierarchy of heav&#x27;n)

Soprano solo with chorus, in C major. The heavenly hosts praise God and the work of the second day.

&quot;End of the second day.&quot;
No. 5. Und Gott sprach: Es sammle sich das Wasser
(And God said let the waters)

Brief recitative for bass (Genesis 1:9–10), leading into:
No. 6. Rollend in schäumenden Wellen
(Rolling in foaming billows)

Aria in D minor for bass, narrating the creation of seas, mountains, rivers, and (a coda in D major) brooks. As John Mangum points out, &quot;it owes much to the rage arias common to the operas of the day&quot;.
No. 7. Und Gott sprach: Es bringe die Erde Gras hervor
(And God said, Let all the earth bring forth grass)

Brief recitative for soprano (Genesis 1:11), leading into:

No. 8. Nun beut die Flur das frische Grün
(Now robed in cool refreshing green)

Solo aria in B-flat major for soprano, in siciliana rhythm, celebrating the creation of plants.
No. 9. Und die himmlischen Heerscharen verkündigten
(And the Heavenly host proclaimed the third day)

Brief recitative for tenor, leading into:
No. 10. Stimmt an die Saiten
(Awake the harp)

Chorus celebrating the third day, with four-part fugue on the words &quot;For the heavens and earth/He has clothed in stately dress&quot;.

&quot;End of the third day.&quot;
No. 11. Und Gott sprach: Es sei&#x27;n Lichter an der Feste des Himmels
(And God said : Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven)
Recitative for tenor, with portions of Genesis 1:14–16.
No. 12. In vollem Glanze steiget jetzt die Sonne
(In splendour bright is rising now/the sun)

With tenor narration, the orchestra portrays a brilliant sunrise, then a languid moonrise. The tune of the sunrise is simply ten notes of the D major scale, variously harmonized; the Moon rises in the subdominant key of G, also with a rising scale passage. The end of recitative briefly alludes to the new-created stars, then introduces:
No. 13. Die Himmel erzählen die Ehre Gottes
(The heavens are telling the glory of God)

The text is based on Psalm 19:1–3, which had been set by Bach as the opening chorus of his cantata &quot;&quot;Die Himmel erzählen die Ehre Gottes&quot;, BWV 76&quot;.

Haydn&#x27;s century, following on the discoveries of Newton, had the view that an orderly universe—particularly the mathematically governed motion of the heavenly bodies—attests to divine wisdom. Haydn, a naturally curious man, may have had an amateur interest in astronomy, as while in England he took the trouble to visit William Herschel, ex-composer and discoverer of Uranus, in his observatory in Slough.

&quot;Die Himmel erzählen&quot; is in the tonic major key of Part I; Part I then starts in C minor and ends in C major, showing the triumph of light over dark. It begins with alternation between celebratory choral passages and more meditative sequences from the three vocal soloists, followed by a choral fugue on the words &quot;Und seiner Hände Werk zeigt an das Firmament&quot;, then a final homophonic section. (&quot;The wonder of his works displays the firmament&quot; is the English text here, with word-order calqued from the German, but somewhat awkward compared to the Authorized Version&#x27;s &quot;And the firmament sheweth the handywork of God&quot;.)
The unusual intensity of the ending may be the result of Haydn&#x27;s piling of coda upon coda, each occurring at a point where the music seems about to end.

&quot;End of the fourth day.&quot;

=== Part II ===

Part II celebrates the creation of sea creatures, birds, animals, and lastly, man.
No. 14. Und Gott sprach: Es bringe das Wasser in der Fülle hervor
(And God said : Let the waters bring forth in plenty)

Recitative for soprano (Genesis 1:20), leading into:
No. 15. Auf starkem Fittiche schwinget sich der Adler stolz
(On mighty wings the eagle proudly soars aloft)
Aria for soprano in F major, celebrating the creation of birds. The species mentioned are the eagle, the lark, the dove and the nightingale. The lyrics include the conceit that, at the time just after the Creation, the nightingale&#x27;s song was not yet melancholy.
No. 16. Und Gott schuf große Walfische
(And God created great whales.)

For bass solo, in D minor. While labeled a recitative in the score, it is more appropriately described as a recitative (from Genesis 1:21–22) followed by a very brief aria, the latter a verse paraphrase on the biblical words (Gen. 1:22) &quot;Be fruitful and multiply.&quot; The bass sings in the voice of the Almighty, as quoted by the Archangel Raphael. The somber accompaniment uses no violins, but only the lower strings, with divided violas and cellos. For discussion of how this section was composed, see Gottfried van Swieten.
No. 17. Und die Engel rührten ihr&#x27; unsterblichen Harfen
(And the angels struck their immortal harps.)

Brief recitative for bass, which by a skilled player may be realized with harp imitations in the accompaniment, leading into:
No. 18. In holder Anmut stehn
(In fairest raiment)

Haydn breaks the regularity of the pattern &quot;Recitative–Elaboration for solo–Celebratory chorus&quot; with a meditative work in A major for the trio of vocalists, contemplating the beauty and immensity of the newly created world.
This leads without a break to:
No. 19. Der Herr ist groß in seiner Macht (The Lord is great in his might)

Chorus with all three soloists, in A major, celebrating the fifth day. The line &quot;...und ewig bleibt sein Ruhm&quot; is, appropriately, repeated, seemingly without end.

&quot;End of the fifth day&quot;
No. 20. Und Gott sprach: Es bringe die Erde hervor lebende Geschöpfe
(And God said : Let earth bring forth the living creature)
Recitative for bass (Genesis 1:24), leading into:
No. 21. Gleich öffnet sich der Erde Schoß
(At once Earth opens her womb)

A movement of tone painting with bass narration. Haydn&#x27;s gentle sense of humor is indulged here as the newly created creatures appear, each with musical illustration: lion, tiger, stag, horse, cattle, sheep, insects, and worms. As always in Haydn&#x27;s oratorio tone painting, the sung verbal explanation comes after the orchestral portrayal.

The transition from glamorous animals (the first four) to prosaic ones (the last four) is marked with an unprepared modulation from D-flat to A major. The farm animals are portrayed (as in No. 8) with siciliana rhythm, which plainly had bucolic associations for Haydn. Basses who can sing a low D (D) are often tempted to use it on the final note &quot;Wurm&quot;, instead of the D an octave higher as written by Haydn.
No. 22. Nun scheint in vollem Glanze der Himmel
(Now shines heaven in the brightest glory)

Aria for bass in D major, in 3/4 time. The theme is
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Doch war noch alles nicht vollbracht
Dem Ganzen fehlte das Geschöpf
Das Gottes Werke dankbar seh&#x27;n
Des Herren Güte preisen soll.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Yet not all was complete,
The whole lacked a being
Who would behold God&#x27;s work with thanks
And praise the Lord&#x27;s goodness.&lt;/poem&gt;

Thus the movement is preparatory to the creation of man.

The first part of the movement contains another brief but notable bit of tone painting: a fortissimo bottom B-flat (sounding in octaves) for bassoons and contrabassoon accompanying the last word of the line, &quot;By heavy beasts the ground is trod.&quot;
No. 23. Und Gott schuf den Menschen
(And God created Man)
Tenor recitative (Genesis 1:27, 2:7), leading to:
No. 24. Mit Würd&#x27; und Hoheit angetan
(In native worth and honor clad)

A prized aria for tenor, in C major, celebrating the creation of man, then woman. Often sung outside the context of &quot;The Creation&quot;. Although the aria relates a Biblical story, the virtues attributed to Adam (and not Eve) clearly reflect the values of the Enlightenment.

This was almost certainly the last music from &quot;The Creation&quot; that Haydn ever heard: it was sung for him several days before his death in 1809 as a gesture of respect by a French military officer, a member of Napoleon&#x27;s invading army.
No. 25. Und Gott sah jedes Ding
(And God saw every thing)

Brief recitative for bass (text amplifying Genesis 1:31), leading to:
No. 26. Vollendet ist das große Werk
(The great work is complete)

A celebration for chorus alone, in B-flat, of the sixth day. In the Biblical story (Genesis 2:1-3) this day was the end of Creation, since God rested on the seventh day, the first Sabbath.
No. 27. Zu dir, o Herr, blickt alles auf
(All look up to thee, O Lord)

Another meditation for the three angels (compare No. 18), in E-flat major, on God&#x27;s omnipotence and mercy, quoting Psalm 145:15–16. The bass solo line &quot;Du wendest ab dein Angesicht&quot; requires the singer to terrify the audience with barely-audible &quot;pianissimo&quot;. The end of the trio is followed without pause by...
No. 28. Vollendet ist das große Werk
(Fulfilled at last the great work)

This chorus begins with the same music and words as No. 26, and is in the same key of B-flat. It quickly moves into large double fugue on the words &quot;Alles lobe seinen Namen, denn er allein ist hoch erhaben&quot; (&quot;Let all praise his name, for he alone is sublime&quot;). As appropriate to the finale of Part II, this repeat chorus is longer and ends more intensely than the first.

The pattern of the last three numbers of Part II, with two celebratory movements on the same theme flanking a slower meditative movement, echoes countless settings of the Latin Mass, where similar or identical choruses on Hosanna in excelsis flank a meditative section on Benedictus.

=== Part III ===

Part III takes place in the Garden of Eden, and narrates the happy first hours of Adam and Eve.
No. 29. Aus Rosenwolken bricht
(In rosy mantle appears)

Orchestral prelude in slow tempo depicting dawn in the Garden of Eden, followed by recitative for tenor representing Uriel.
Adam and Eve are seen walking hand in hand.

The key is E major, very remote from the flat-side keys that have dominated the work so far. Various commentators suggest that this was meant by Haydn to convey the remoteness of Earth from Heaven, or to contrast the sinfulness of people with the perfection of angels.
No. 30. Von deiner Güt&#x27;, o Herr und Gott
(By thy goodness, O bounteous Lord)

Adam and Eve offer a prayer of thanks in C major, accompanied by a chorus of angels.

This movement, the longest in &quot;The Creation&quot;, has three parts. In the first, marked adagio, Adam and Eve sing their prayer, with the chorus singing underneath them accompanied by soft timpani rolls. In the second section, the tempo picks up, and Adam, Eve, and the angels praise the newly created world. The final section is for chorus and orchestra alone, a celebration on the words &quot;Wir preisen dich in Ewigkeit&quot; (&quot;We praise thee eternally&quot;).
No. 31. Nun ist die erste Pflicht erfüllt
(Our first duty we have now performed)

Recitative for Adam and Eve, leading to:

No. 32. Holde Gattin, dir zur Seite
(Sweet companion, at thy side)

Love duet for Adam and Eve in E-flat major. There is a slow initial section, followed by an Allegro. The style is clearly influenced by comic opera, a genre in which Haydn had extensive experience. For some commentators the music evokes the blissful comic duet sung by Papageno and Papagena near the end of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;.
No. 33. O glücklich Paar, und glücklich immerfort
(O happy pair, and ever happy henceforth)

Uriel briefly explains to the pair that they will be happy always if they will refrain from wanting to have, or wishing to know, more than they should. This is the only reference to the fall of humanity.
No. 34. Singt dem Herren alle Stimmen!
(Sing the Lord, ye voices all)

Final chorus in B-flat major. There is a slow introduction, followed by a double fugue on the words &quot;Des Herren Ruhm, er bleibt in Ewigkeit&quot; (&quot;The praise of the Lord will endure forever&quot;), with passages for the vocal soloists and a final homophonic section.

== Recordings ==










The 2009 recording was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2011 for Best Choral Performance and was the top pick by pianist Iain Burnside on the 2013 broadcast of BBC 3&#x27;S CD Review – Building a Library.

== Sources ==
Haydn&#x27;s original autograph score has been lost since 1803. A Viennese published score dated 1800 forms the basis of most performances today. The score used for performances by the Tonkünstler-Societät in 1799, with notes in the composer&#x27;s hand, is kept in the Vienna State Library. There are various other copyist scores such as the &quot;Estate&quot;, as well as hybrid editions prepared by scholars during the last two centuries.

<text>Sodium tallowate is made from sodium hydroxide (a.k.a., caustic soda, or, lye); steam; and, animal (often, cattle) fat (i.e., tallow). This process, called saponification, breaks down the triglyceride (fat); frees the glycerol within; and, results in a sodium salt, sodium tallowate. It is usually combined with sodium cocoate, the sodium salt of coconut oil. Together, they are—with sodium palmate—major constituents of bar soap.

<doc id="305117" wikidata="Q5244263" url="?curid=305117" title="Tetris Worlds">
<text>Tetris Worlds is a version of the video game &quot;Tetris&quot;. Originally released in 2001 for Microsoft Windows and Game Boy Advance, it was later released for Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation 2 in 2002. In 2003, an Xbox Live version titled &quot;Tetris Worlds Online&quot; and a single-disc compilation version (bundled alongside &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;) were released for the Xbox. The latter was bundled with Xbox systems.

The platform-specific versions of &quot;Tetris Worlds&quot; were developed by three different companies. Blue Planet Software developed the PC and PlayStation 2 versions, Radical Entertainment developed the GameCube and Xbox versions, and 3d6 Games developed the Game Boy Advance version. All versions were published by THQ under license from The Tetris Company. &quot;Tetris Worlds&quot; was THQ&#x27;s first &quot;Tetris&quot; game. The company later published &quot;Tetris Advance&quot; also for the Game Boy Advance, &quot;Tetris Elements&quot; for Windows and Mac OS X, and &quot;Tetris Evolution&quot; for the Xbox 360. Every version except for Game Boy Advance features a distinctly whispering female voice (Kimberly Unger, credited as eKim) as the announcer. The game has been translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay consists of normal &quot;Tetris&quot; games. However, there are several game modes, tweaking the way the game works.

===Story mode===
The goal is to evacuate the homeworld of the Minos before their solar system&#x27;s sun Hadar goes supernova.

The player can send their Mino Tetrinaut to six different worlds, then play the Tetris variant of that world. When the player plays enough of that world, more Minos are rescued. The better the player does, the more Minos rescued. They will then work to create the world into a home for Minos.

===Arcade mode===

This mode is where the player plays two-minute &quot;Tetris&quot; games of any variant. This is also where multiplayer games are played. The Arcade mode variants are listed as follows:
*Tetris: &quot;Go for a Tetris&quot;. A normal &quot;Tetris&quot; game, where the player plays until they lose. Losses occur when the Tetriminos reach the top.
*Square Tetris: While the player plays &quot;Tetris&quot;, they must also try to combine Tetriminos into squares. Lines cleared containing 4x4 Tetriminos cause large bonuses. This variant originated from &quot;The New Tetris&quot;.
*Cascade Tetris: &quot;Go for a Cascade&quot;. The player must try to clear lines that cause Cascades. Cascades occur when a cleared line cause other Blocks to fall and clear another line.
*Sticky Tetris: &quot;Clear the Bottom Line&quot;. Players must try to clear the bottom line of &quot;Garbage Blocks&quot;. Same-colored Blocks stick together in this mode, hence the name. If 25 same-colored blocks connect, a Critical Mass is formed and are cleared from the Matrix. This variant originated from &quot;The Next Tetris&quot;.
*Hot-Line Tetris: &quot;Go for a Hot-Line&quot;. In this mode, there are six &quot;Hot-Lines&quot; in the Matrix. The player must try to clear lines that are on the Hot-Line. Lines cleared anywhere else earn no points.
*Fusion Tetris: &quot;Activate the Atom Blocks&quot;. In this mode, there is a &quot;Fusion Block&quot; at the bottom of the Matrix. Players must try to connect falling &quot;Atom Blocks&quot; to the Fusion Blocks. Atom and Fusion Blocks are not cleared in line clears, and clearing a line containing an Atom or Fusion Block causes a Cascade. 
*Popular Tetris (GBA Version Only): In this hidden mode the game is set up like the original &quot;Tetris&quot; game. The player clears lines to score points and after every 10 lines the level goes up. Scoring increases on higher levels and there is no time limit; however, this mode stops keeping score once a player reaches 1 million (which is more than 999999, the maximum score on the Game Boy version).

==Development==
The game had a marketing budget of $2 million.

== Reception ==
The Game Boy Advance and Xbox versions received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews, while the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions received &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the GBA version was ported and published by Success on April 26, 2002, followed by the Xbox version on November 14, and the GameCube version on December 20, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of one six, one four, and two sixes for a total of 22 out of 40 for the GBA version, and 24 out of 40 for the Xbox version. &quot;Tetris Worlds&quot;″ Game Boy Advance version was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Worst Game&quot; award among console games, which went to &quot;Kabuki Warriors&quot;.

In the PS2, PC, and GBA versions, gameplay contained one major difference from a normal Tetris game. In classic Tetris, when a Tetrimino touches the bottom of the screen, it locks in place. However, in these versions, Tetriminos do not lock until players make them lock (e.g., by using Hard Drop to lock them immediately), allowing players to rotate and move the pieces indefinitely until they are satisfied. Critics said that this made the game too easy (although the countdown clock still runs while the player is using unlimited move and rotate) and &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that it &quot;broke Tetris&quot;. However, the GBA version features a hidden version of classic Tetris (titled &quot;Popular&quot; Tetris) that plays without this feature. It is accessed by holding the L button and pressing select on the &quot;Marathon&quot; game select menu. However, since it is not part of the &quot;Default&quot; presentation, many reviews did not factor in this mode.

In the GameCube and Xbox versions, the &quot;Easy Spin&quot; feature was made optional. However, they still received mostly mixed reviews.

In the United States, &quot;Tetris Worlds&quot;″ Game Boy Advance version sold 960,000 copies and earned $26 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 20th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country.

By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Tetris Worlds&quot; had sold 850,000 copies and earned $18 million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 71st highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country.

<doc id="305121" wikidata="Q1067812" url="?curid=305121" title="Nick Menza">
<text>Nicholas Menza (July 23, 1964 – May 21, 2016) was an American musician who was the drummer of the thrash metal band Megadeth from 1989 to 1998. He recorded drums on four of Megadeth&#x27;s albums: &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; (1990), &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; (1992), &quot;Youthanasia&quot; (1994), and &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; (1997).

== Early life ==
Menza was born in Munich, Germany, where his father, jazz musician Don Menza, had been stationed with the U.S. Army. He began playing drums at the age of two, at which age he performed at his first public concert when during the intermission someone sat him down on Jack DeJohnette&#x27;s drums and he proceeded to play. Menza&#x27;s influences stem from being nurtured around the tutelage of such notables as Buddy Rich, Steve Gadd, Nick Ceroli, Jeff Porcaro, and Louie Bellson.

== Career ==
===1986–1989: Rhoads,The Green, Von Skeletor, Cold Fire===
Beginning his professional musical career at the age of 18, drumming in the band Rhoads featuring singer Kelle Rhoads, brother of the late Randy Rhoads, Menza released his first record with Rhoads, titled &quot;Into the Future&quot;, in Europe in 1986.

Following Rhoads, Menza was part of a succession of Los Angeles metal bands, including The Green (with Rhoads bandmates John Goodwin on guitar and Darwin Ballard on bass), Von Skeletor (another collaboration with Goodwin and Michael Guillory on guitars, Cam Daigneault on drums, and Menza handling lead vocals on the band&#x27;s demo and self-released album, &quot;Injection of Death&quot;), and Cold Fire (also featuring Warrior guitarist Joe Floyd) before joining Megadeth.

===1989–1998: Megadeth===
Moving on to session playing including styles ranging from R&amp;B to gospel, funk and heavy metal, recording with the likes of John Fogerty, Menza caught the attention of then Megadeth drummer Chuck Behler and became his tech. When Megadeth needed a drummer in 1989, Menza was asked by Dave Mustaine to join the band. This prior experience and personal relationship led to the invitation to join Megadeth for the 1990 recording &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;.

For the next ten years, Menza became associated with Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; period and also his Greg Voelker Rack System. This included a double-bass drum kit with the tom-toms mounted on a lower chrome rack and all cymbal crashes mounted on a higher rack, which was supported by two chrome bars behind the drummer. This was later adopted by Megadeth on 2004&#x27;s Blackmail the Universe tour, which featured a similar rack system.

During his tenure in Megadeth, Menza also played drums on his bandmate Marty Friedman&#x27;s three solo albums, &quot;Scenes&quot; (1992), &quot;Introduction&quot; (1994) and &quot;True Obsessions&quot; (1996).

By the summer of 1998, while the band was still touring in support of &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;, Menza was having knee problems and sought medical advice. He was informed he had a tumor, which was later found to be benign, and had it removed. Rather than cancel any dates, Megadeth hired Jimmy DeGrasso as a temporary replacement. When the time came to record a follow-up album, Menza was not asked back and DeGrasso became the band&#x27;s official drummer. Menza has said in several interviews that, while in the hospital recovering from knee surgery, he received a phone call from Mustaine that simply said &quot;Your services are not needed anymore&quot;. 

===1998-2015: Post-Megadeth===
After his departure, he began work on &quot;Menza: Life After Deth&quot; with guitarist Anthony Gallo, bassist Jason Levin, and guitarist Ty Longley. The album was initially intended to have a 2002 release date and tour to follow; however, on the tour in 2003 with the reformed Great White, Longley was among the 100 people killed in The Station nightclub fire in Rhode Island and a year later Jason Levin died of heart failure, Menza and Gallo were devastated and the &quot;Life After Deth&quot; tour was never announced. Guest guitarist Christian Nesmith, son of The Monkees&#x27; Michael Nesmith, did some leads and Menza hired producer Max Norman (Ozzy Osbourne, Megadeth).

Following the reissue of the entire Megadeth catalog, Menza reunited with Megadeth in July of 2004. Months later, Menza was fired after rehearsals and replaced with Shawn Drover. Mustaine said that this was because Menza &quot;just wasn&#x27;t prepared&quot; for a full-scale U.S. tour, physically.

In April 2006, Menza joined the Los Angeles–based metal band Orphaned to Hatred. The group describe their sound as &quot;a continuation of the heavy style of 1990s Pantera&quot;. He left the band in late 2010.

Menza nearly suffered the loss of an arm in 2007, after having an accident with a power saw. He required reconstructive surgery and metal plates in his arm and a lengthy rehabilitation, but later recovered. Menza later auctioned off the blood-stained saw blade and an original copy of an X-ray from the incident.

In March 2011, Menza appeared in a music video for Mindstreem&#x27;s &quot;We Up Next&quot;, a song originally written by SIN 34 guitarist Anthony Gallo featuring Tony Lanza and Daniel Wayne, Jr. on vocals. The actual recording is Menza (drums), Gallo (guitars), Gregg Babuccio (bass), and Tony Lanza and Daniel Wayne Jr. (vocals).

Also in March 2011, Menza&#x27;s band Deltanaut posted a video for the song &quot;Sacrifice&quot; in conjunction with the release of their Roy Z produced digital-only five-song EP. The lineup consisted of Menza, his old Rhoads and The Green bandmate, bassist Darwin Ballard, guitarists Christopher Grady and Colin Reid, and lead vocalist Brian Williams. Menza&#x27;s father Don plays saxophone on the song &quot;The King&quot;; other guests include Roy Z on guitar and Ed Roth on keyboards.

In 2014, Menza played on the demo version of the song Babylonian Ships.

In 2015, Menza contributed drum tracks to the song &quot;Are We Alone?&quot; on the album &quot;Warless Society (The Global Invasion)&quot; by Ci2i, with John Goodwin and Darwin Ballard on guitar and bass, respectively. In 2015, he also began working with Los Angeles band Sweet Eve on their follow up album &quot;The Immortal Machine&quot; as producer and drummer.

== Death ==
On May 21, 2016, Menza was performing with his band OHM at The Baked Potato jazz club in Studio City, Los Angeles. Only three songs into the set, Menza collapsed onstage. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. An autopsy later showed the cause of death to be atherosclerotic, hypertensive-induced congestive heart failure. Menza was 51.

The vast majority of the area in the visual field is included in the notion of peripheral vision. &quot;Far peripheral&quot; vision refers to the area at the edges of the visual field, &quot;mid-peripheral&quot; vision refers to medium eccentricities, and &quot;near-peripheral&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;para-central&quot; vision, exists adjacent to the center of gaze.

==Boundaries==

===Inner boundaries===
The inner boundaries of peripheral vision can be defined in any of several ways depending on the context. In everyday language the term &quot;peripheral vision&quot; is often used to refer to what in technical usage would be called &quot;far peripheral vision.&quot; This is vision outside of the range of stereoscopic vision. It can be conceived as bounded at the center by a circle 60° in radius or 120° in diameter, centered around the fixation point, i.e., the point at which one&#x27;s gaze is directed. However, in common usage, peripheral vision may also refer to the area outside a circle 30° in radius or 60° in diameter. In vision-related fields such as physiology, ophthalmology, optometry, or vision science in general, the inner boundaries of peripheral vision are defined more narrowly in terms of one of several anatomical regions of the central retina, in particular the fovea and the macula.

The fovea is a cone-shaped depression in the central retina measuring 1.5 mm in diameter, corresponding to 5° of the visual field. The outer boundaries of the fovea are visible under a microscope, or with microscopic imaging technology such as OCT or microscopic MRI. When viewed through the pupil, as in an eye exam (using an ophthalmoscope or retinal photography), only the central portion of the fovea may be visible. Anatomists refer to this as the clinical fovea, and say that it corresponds to the anatomical foveola, a structure with a diameter of 0.35 mm corresponding to 1 degree of the visual field. In clinical usage the central part of the fovea is typically referred to simply as the fovea.

In terms of visual acuity, &quot;foveal vision&quot; may be defined as vision using the part of the retina in which a visual acuity of at least 20/20 (6/6 metric or 0.0 LogMAR; internationally 1.0) is attained. This corresponds to using the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) with a diameter of 0.5 mm representing 1.5° of the visual field (although often idealized as perfect circles, the central structures of the retina tend to be irregular ovals). Thus, foveal vision may also be defined as the central 1.5–2° of the visual field. Vision within the fovea is generally called central vision, while vision outside of the fovea, or even outside the foveola, is called peripheral, or indirect vision.

A ring-shaped region surrounding the fovea, known as the parafovea, is sometimes taken to represent an intermediate form of vision called paracentral vision. The parafovea has an outer diameter of 2.5 mm representing 8° of the visual field.

The macula, the next larger region of the retina, is defined as having at least two layers of ganglia (bundles of nerves and neurons) and is sometimes taken as defining the boundaries of central vs. peripheral vision (but this is controversial). Estimates of the macula’s size differ, its diameter estimated at 6° – 10° (corresponding to 1.7 – 2.9 mm), up to 17° of the visual field (5.5 mm). The term is familiar in the general public through the widespread macular degeneration (AMD) at older age, where central vision is lost.
When viewed from the pupil, as in an eye exam, only the central portion of the macula may be visible. Known to anatomists as the clinical macula (and in clinical setting as simply the macula) this inner region is thought to correspond to the anatomical fovea.

A dividing line between near and mid peripheral vision at 30° radius can be based on several features of visual performance.
Visual acuity declines systematically up to 30° eccentricity: At 2°, acuity is half the foveal value, at 4° one-third, at 6° one-fourth etc. At 30°, it is one-sixteenth the foveal value. From thereon the decline is steeper. (Note that it would be wrong to say, the value were halved &quot;every&quot; 2°, as said in some textbooks or in previous versions of this article.) 
Color perception is strong at 20° but weak at 40°. In dark-adapted vision, light sensitivity corresponds to rod density, which peaks just at 18°. From 18° towards the center, rod density declines rapidly. From 18° away from the center, rod density declines more gradually, in a curve with distinct inflection points resulting in two humps. The outer edge of the second hump is at about 30°, and corresponds to the outer edge of good night vision.

===Outer boundaries===

The outer boundaries of peripheral vision correspond to the boundaries of the visual field as a whole. For a single eye, the extent of the visual field can be (roughly) defined in terms of four angles, each measured from the fixation point, i.e., the point at which one&#x27;s gaze is directed. These angles, representing four cardinal directions, are 60° upwards, 60° nasally (towards the nose), 70–75° downwards, and 100–110° temporally (away from the nose and towards the temple). For both eyes the combined visual field is 130–135° vertically and 200–220° horizontally.

==Characteristics==
The loss of peripheral vision while retaining central vision is known as tunnel vision, and the loss of central vision while retaining peripheral vision is known as central scotoma.

Peripheral vision is weak in humans, especially at distinguishing detail, color, and shape. This is because the density of receptor and ganglion cells in the retina is greater at the center and lowest at the edges, and, moreover, the representation in the visual cortex is much smaller than that of the fovea (see visual system for an explanation of these concepts). The distribution of receptor cells across the retina is different between the two main types, rod cells and cone cells. Rod cells are unable to distinguish color and peak in density in the near periphery (at 18° eccentricity), while cone cell density is highest in the very center, the fovea. Note that this does not mean that there is a lack of cones representing in the periphery; colors can be distinguished in peripheral vision.

Flicker fusion thresholds decline towards the periphery, but do that at a lower rate than other visual functions; so the periphery has a relative advantage at noticing flicker. Peripheral vision is also relatively good at detecting motion (a feature of Magno cells).

Central vision is relatively weak in the dark (scotopic vision) since cone cells lack sensitivity at low light levels. Rod cells, which are concentrated further away from the fovea, operate better than cone cells in low light. This makes peripheral vision useful for detecting faint light sources at night (like faint stars). Because of this, pilots are taught to use peripheral vision to scan for aircraft at night. 

The distinctions between foveal (sometimes also called central) and peripheral vision are reflected in subtle physiological and anatomical differences in the visual cortex. Different visual areas contribute to the processing of visual information coming from different parts of the visual field, and a complex of visual areas located along the banks of the interhemispheric fissure (a deep groove that separates the two brain hemispheres) has been linked to peripheral vision. It has been suggested that these areas are important for fast reactions to visual stimuli in the periphery, and monitoring body position relative to gravity.

==Functions==
The main functions of peripheral vision are:
* recognition of well-known structures and forms with no need to focus by the foveal line of sight
* identification of similar forms and movements (Gestalt psychology laws)
* delivery of sensations which form the background of detailed visual perception

==Extreme peripheral vision==

When viewed at large angles, the iris and pupil appear to be rotated toward the viewer due to the optical refraction in the cornea. As a result, the pupil may still be visible at angles greater than 90°.

===Cone-rich rim of the retina===
The rim of the retina contains a large concentration of cone cells. The retina extends farthest in the superior-nasal 45° quadrant (in the direction from the pupil to the bridge of the nose) with the greatest extent of the visual field in the opposite direction, the inferior temporal 45° quadrant (from the pupil of either eye towards the bottom of the nearest ear). Vision at this extreme part of the visual field is thought to be possibly concerned with threat detection, measuring optical flow, color constancy, or circadian rhythm.

<text>The field of view (FOV) is the angular extent of the observable world that is seen at any given moment. In the case of optical instruments or sensors, it is a solid angle through which a detector is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation. It is further relevant in &quot;photography&quot;.

== Humans and animals ==
In the context of human and primate vision, the term &quot;field of view&quot; is typically only used in the sense of a restriction to what is visible by external apparatus, like when wearing spectacles or virtual reality goggles. Note that eye movements are allowed in the definition but do not change the field of view when understood this way.

If the analogy of the eye&#x27;s retina working as a sensor is drawn upon, the corresponding concept in human (and much of animal vision) is the visual field. It is defined as &quot;the number of degrees of visual angle during stable fixation of the eyes&quot;. Note that eye movements are excluded in the visual field&#x27;s definition. Humans have a slightly over 210-degree forward-facing horizontal arc of their visual field (i.e. without eye movements), (with eye movements included it is slightly larger, as you can try for yourself by wiggling a finger on the side), while some birds have a complete or nearly complete 360-degree visual field. The vertical range of the visual field in humans is around 150 degrees.

The range of visual abilities is not uniform across the visual field, and by implication the FoV, and varies between species. For example, binocular vision, which is the basis for stereopsis and is important for depth perception, covers 114 degrees (horizontally) of the visual field in humans; the remaining peripheral ~50 degrees on each side have no binocular vision (because only one eye can see those parts of the visual field). Some birds have a scant 10 to 20 degrees of binocular vision.

Similarly, color vision and the ability to perceive shape and motion vary across the visual field; in humans color vision and form perception are concentrated in the center of the visual field, while motion perception is only slightly reduced in the periphery and thus has a relative advantage there. The physiological basis for that is the much higher concentration of color-sensitive cone cells and color-sensitive parvocellular retinal ganglion cells in the fovea – the central region of the retina, together with a larger representation in the visual cortex – in comparison to the higher concentration of color-insensitive rod cells and motion-sensitive magnocellular retinal ganglion cells in the visual periphery, and smaller cortical representation. Since rod cells require considerably less light to be activated, the result of this distribution is further that peripheral vision is much more sensitive at night relative to foveal vision (sensitivity is highest at around 20 deg eccentricity).

== Conversions ==
Many optical instruments, particularly binoculars or spotting scopes, are advertised with their field of view specified in one of two ways: angular field of view, and linear field of view. Angular field of view is typically specified in degrees, while linear field of view is a ratio of lengths. For example, binoculars with a 5.8 degree (angular) field of view might be advertised as having a (linear) field of view of 102 mm per meter. As long as the FOV is less than about 10 degrees or so, the following approximation formulas allow one to convert between linear and angular field of view. Let formula_1 be the angular field of view in degrees. Let formula_2 be the linear field of view in millimeters per meter. Then, using the small-angle approximation:

:formula_3
:formula_4

== Machine vision ==
In machine vision the lens focal length and image sensor size sets up the fixed relationship between the field of view and the working distance. Field of view is the area of the inspection captured on the camera’s imager. The size of the field of view and the size of the camera’s imager directly affect the image resolution (one determining factor in accuracy). Working distance is the distance between the back of the lens and the target object.

== Tomography ==

In tomography, the field of view is the area of each tomogram. In for example computed tomography, a volume of voxels can be created from such tomograms by merging multiple slices along the scan range.

== Remote sensing ==
In remote sensing, the solid angle through which a detector element (a pixel sensor) is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation at any one time, is called &quot;instantaneous field of view&quot; or IFOV. A measure of the spatial resolution of a remote sensing imaging system, it is often expressed as dimensions of visible ground area, for some known sensor altitude. Single pixel IFOV is closely related to concept of &quot;resolved pixel size&quot;, ground resolved distance, ground sample distance and modulation transfer function.

==Astronomy==
In astronomy, the field of view is usually expressed as an angular area viewed by the instrument, in square degrees, or for higher magnification instruments, in square arc-minutes. For reference the Wide Field Channel on the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope has a field of view of 10 sq. arc-minutes, and the High Resolution Channel of the same instrument has a field of view of 0.15 sq. arc-minutes. Ground-based survey telescopes have much wider fields of view. The photographic plates used by the UK Schmidt Telescope had a field of view of 30 sq. degrees. The 1.8 m (71 in) Pan-STARRS telescope, with the most advanced digital camera to date has a field of view of 7 sq. degrees. In the near infra-red WFCAM on UKIRT has a field of view of 0.2 sq. degrees and the VISTA telescope has a field of view of 0.6 sq. degrees. Until recently digital cameras could only cover a small field of view compared to photographic plates, although they beat photographic plates in quantum efficiency, linearity and dynamic range, as well as being much easier to process.

== Photography ==
In photography, the field of view is that part of the world that is visible through the camera at a particular position and orientation in space; objects outside the FOV when the picture is taken are not recorded in the photograph. It is most often expressed as the angular size of the view cone, as an angle of view. For a normal lens focused at infinity, the diagonal (or horizontal or vertical) field of view can be calculated as:
:formula_5
where formula_6 is the focal length, here the sensor size and formula_6 are in the same unit of length, FOV is in radians.

== Microscopy ==

In microscopy, the field of view in high power (usually a 400-fold magnification when referenced in scientific papers) is called a high-power field, and is used as a reference point for various classification schemes.

For an objective with magnification formula_8, the FOV is related to the Field Number (FN) by
:formula_9
if other magnifying lenses are used in the system (in addition to the objective), the total formula_8 for the projection is used.

== Video games ==
The field of view in video games refers to the field of view of the camera looking at the game world, which is dependent on the scaling method used.

<text>A waistcoat (UK and Commonwealth, or ; colloquially called a ) or vest (US and Canada) is a sleeveless upper-body garment. It is usually worn over a dress shirt and necktie and below a coat as a part of most men&#x27;s formal wear. It is also sported as the third piece in the traditional three-piece male suit. Any given waistcoat can be simple or ornate, or for leisure or luxury. Historically, the waistcoat can be worn either in the place of, or underneath, a larger coat, dependent upon the weather, wearer, and setting.

Daytime formal wear and semi-formal wear commonly comprises a contrastingly coloured waistcoat, such as in buff or dove gray, still seen in morning dress and black lounge suit. For white tie and black tie, it is traditionally white or black, respectively.

== Names ==
The term &quot;waistcoat&quot; is used in the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth countries. The term &quot;vest&quot; is used widely in the United States and Canada, and is often worn as part of formal attire or as the third piece of a lounge suit in addition to a jacket and trousers. The term &quot;vest&quot; derives from the French language &quot;jacket, sport coat&quot;, the term for a vest-waistcoat in French today being , the Italian language &quot;robe, gown&quot;, and the Latin language . The term &quot;vest&quot; in European countries refers to the A-shirt, a type of athletic vest. The banyan, a garment of India, is commonly called a vest in Indian English.

Diarist Samuel Pepys records &quot;vest&quot; in 1666 as the original English term for the garment; the word &quot;waistcoat&quot; derives from the cutting of the coat at waist-level, since at the time of the coining, tailors cut men&#x27;s formal coats well below the waist (as with dress coats). An alternative theory is that, as material was left over from the tailoring of a two-piece suit, it was fashioned into a &quot;waste-coat&quot; to avoid that material being wasted, although recent academic debate has cast doubt on this theory. During the 17th century, troops of the regular army – and to some degree also local militia – wore waistcoats which were the reverse colour of their overcoats. It is believed that these were made by turning old worn-out standard issue overcoats inside-out (so that the lining colour appeared on the outside) and removing the sleeves. The term &quot;waistcoat&quot; might therefore also be derived from the wastage of the old coat.

==Characteristics and use==

A waistcoat has a full vertical opening in the front, which fastens with buttons or snaps. Both single-breasted and double-breasted waistcoats exist, regardless of the formality of dress, but single-breasted ones are more common. In a three piece suit, the cloth used matches the jacket and trousers. Waistcoats can also have lapels or revers depending on the style.

Before wristwatches became popular, gentlemen kept their pocket watches in the front waistcoat pocket, with the watch on a watch chain threaded through a buttonhole. Sometimes an extra hole was made in line with the pockets for this use. A bar on the end of the chain held it in place to catch the chain if it were dropped or pulled.

Wearing a belt with a waistcoat, and indeed any suit, is not traditional. To give a more comfortable hang to the trousers, the waistcoat instead covers a pair of braces underneath it.

A custom still sometimes practised is to leave the bottom button undone. Several explanations are popularly given for the origin of this practice. One often-cited one claims that the custom was started by King Edward VII (then the Prince of Wales), whose expanding waistline required it. Variations on this include that he forgot to fasten the lower button when dressing and this was copied. 

It has also been suggested that the practice originated to prevent the waistcoat riding up when on horseback. Undoing the bottom button avoids stress to the bottom button when sitting down; when it is fastened, the bottom of the waistcoat pulls sideways causing wrinkling and bulging, since modern waistcoats are cut lower than old ones. This convention only applies to single-breasted day waistcoats and not double breasted, evening, straight-hem or livery waistcoats that are all fully buttoned.

===Daywear===

Waistcoats worn with lounge suits (now principally single-breasted) normally match the suit in cloth, and have four to six buttons. Double-breasted waistcoats are rare compared to single but are more commonly seen in morning dress. These may either match the colour of the morning coat or be in a contrasting colour, commonly buff, dove gray, or powder blue.

===Evening wear===
The waistcoats worn with white- and black- tie are different from standard daytime single-breasted waistcoats, being much lower in cut (with three buttons or four buttons, where all are fastened). The much larger expanse of shirt compared to a daytime waistcoat allows more variety of form, with &quot;U&quot; or &quot;V&quot; shapes possible, and there is large choice of outlines for the tips, ranging from pointed to flat or rounded. The colour normally matches the tie, so only black barathea wool, grosgrain or satin and white marcella, grosgrain or satin are worn, although white waistcoats used to be worn with black tie in early forms of the dress.

Waiters, sometimes also waitresses, and other people working at white-tie events, to distinguish themselves from guests, sometimes wear gray tie, which consists of the dress coat of white tie (a squarely cut away tailcoat) with the black waistcoat and tie of black tie. 

===Clergy===
The variant of the clergy cassock may be cut as a vest. It differs in style from other waistcoats in that the garment buttons to the neck and has an opening that displays the clerical collar.

Sometime around 1830, a new Church of England clerical waistcoat was given the epithet &quot;M.B. Waistcoat&quot; when the garment was introduced by High Church clergy: &quot;M.B.&quot; was intended to be a pejorative or jocular reference to the &quot;Mark of the Beast&quot;, applied by non-High Church Anglicans.
===Scouting===
In the Girl Scouts of the USA, vests are used as an alternative to the sash for the display of badges.

===Sport===
Waistcoats, alongside bowties, are commonly worn by billiard players during a tournament. It is usually worn in snooker and blackball tournaments in the United Kingdom.

==History==

The predecessors to the waistcoat are the Middle Age-era doublet and gambeson.

Various types of waistcoats may have been worn in theatrical manners such as performances and masquerades prior to what is said to be the early origins of the vest.

The brightly coloured silk waistcoats popularised in France and England from the 17th centuryinfluenced by the exotic Indian and other &quot;Eastern&quot; attire of returning English travellersbecame an element of the ensemble that presaged the development of the three-piece lounge suit, together with the cravat, derived from a scarf worn by Croatian mercenaries fighting for King Louis XIII of France, and the justacorps, a coat influenced by the long zupans worn in Poland and Ukraine. 

===17th–18th centuries===
In France, from the mid-17th century, the &quot;&quot; was worn to mid-thigh or knee-length, beneath a justacorps. The garment was sleeved. Both and justacorp were worn in court circles in highly ornate styles.

In October 1666, King Charles II of England launched a new fashion in men&#x27;s wear for the English. The item was a long piece donned beneath the coat that was meant to be seen. Scholar Diana De Marly suggests that the formation of such a mode of dress acted as a response to French fashion being so dominant in the time period. While in the 17th and 18th centuries, waistcoats were often elaborate and brightly coloured, changing fashions in the nineteenth century narrowed this to a more restricted palette, leading to the matching waistcoats worn with lounge suits. 

The garmentand Charles II&#x27;s championing of itis mentioned in a diary entry of October 8, 1666 by Samuel Pepys, the diarist and civil servant. He noted that &quot;the King hath yesterday in council declared his resolution of setting a fashion for clothes which he will never alter. It will be a vest, I know not well how; but it is to teach the nobility thrift.&quot; This royal decree provided the first mention of the vest or waistcoat.

John Evelyn wrote about waistcoats on October 18, 1666: &quot;To Court, it being the first time his Majesty put himself solemnly into the Eastern fashion of vest, changing doublet, stiff collar, bands and cloak, into a comely dress after the Persian mode, with girdles or straps, and shoestrings and garters into buckles... resolving never to alter it, and to leave the French mode&quot;. While Evelyn designated the costume Persian, it was more directly influenced by the Turkish.

The general layout of the vest at its introduction by Charles II was: buttons very closely sewn together, arranged in two rows, lining the front body of the vest, visible underneath a wide-open coat face. The vest was only popular for about seven years after its introduction by Charles; the king soon reverted to French styles. While the vest died out in elite city spaces, it lingered on in the provinces. In 1678 it was reintroduced throughout Europe, attaining high-fashion status again.

===19th century===
After the French Revolution of 1789, anti-aristocratic sentiment in France (and elsewhere in Europe) influenced the wardrobes of both men and women, and waistcoats followed, becoming much less elaborate. After about 1810 the fit of the waistcoat became shorter and tighter, becoming much more secondary to the frock coat and almost counting as an undergarment, although its popularity was larger than ever. With the new dandyism of the early 19th century, the waistcoat started to change roles, moving away from its function as the centrepiece of the visual aspect of male clothing, towards serving as a foundation garment, often with figure-enhancing abilities.

From the 1820s onwards, elite gentlemen—at least those among the more fashionable circles, especially the younger set and the military—wore corsets. The waistcoat served to emphasise the new popularity of the cinched-in waist for males, and became skin-tight, with the overcoat cut to emphasise the figure: broader shoulders, a pouting chest, and a nipped-in waist. Without a corset, a man&#x27;s waistcoat often had whalebone stiffeners and were laced in the back, with reinforced buttons up the front, so that one could pull the lacings in tight to mould the waist into the fashionable silhouette. Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, had a reputation for his tight corsets and tiny waist; and although he lacked popularity during his early reign, men followed his style, and waistcoats became even more restrictive.

This fashion remained throughout the 19th century, although after about 1850 the style changed from that of a corseted look to a straighter line, with less restriction at the waist, so that the waistcoat followed a straighter line up the torso. Toward the end of the century, the Edwardian look made a larger physique more popular—King Edward VII having a large figure.

===20th–21st centuries===
Waistcoats are popular within the indie and steampunk subcultures in the United States. Vests are often worn both open or closed, over dress shirts and even t-shirts.

Non-formal types of waistcoat have been used in workers uniforms, such as at Walmart prior to 2007, and as high-visibility clothing (usually the bright &quot;safety orange&quot; colour).

During the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the manager of the England football team, Gareth Southgate, was often seen wearing a waistcoat. British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer, the official suit provider for the national team, reported a 35% increase in waistcoat sales during England&#x27;s first five games at the tournament. Fashion search platform Lyst also reported that online waistcoat searches increased by over 41% during the course of the World Cup. Part-way through the tournament, the Museum of London announced that it hoped to acquire Gareth Southgate&#x27;s waistcoat in order to display it as part of its permanent collection of historic clothing. In the run up to England&#x27;s semi-final match against Croatia, the blood cancer charity, Bloodwise, encouraged fans to take part in &#x27;Waistcoat Wednesday&#x27; to help raise funds for the charity, while also supporting the England team.

==Preliminary timeline and evolution==

=== England ===

==== Circa 1660–1700 ====

King Charles II inaugurated the &quot;vest&quot; (waistcoat) along with the modern ideal of the three-piece suit. The waistcoats of these three-piece ensembles were the same length as the coat worn over it, most likely knee length, and could be worn for either warmth or display.

==== Circa 1700–1750 ====

The coat, waistcoat, and breeches were crafted from the same fabric. Around the turn of the century, the waistcoat became shorter, ending just below the waistline, allowing the breeches to stick out. When the weather was cold men often would wear more than one waistcoat to stay warm. As time went on, the vest that matched the coat and trousers was worn for formal wear while a vest of different type or fabric acted as a more casual mode of contrasting dress.

==== Circa 1750–1770 ====

Nearly halfway through the century, waistcoats became longer and overlapped with the breeches. Stylistically waistcoats and the rest of the suit began to change in that they matched less. Instead of consisting of the same, highly decorative fabric, it became popular to wear a waistcoat that complemented the coat and breeches instead of matching it perfectly. For instance, men would mix solids and patterns within the waistcoat, coat, and breeches to create a different look.

==== Circa 1770–1800 ====

Waistcoats became shorter, ended at the waist, and were constructed similarly to the coat. This way of styling the vest also was popular in the 19th century throughout the advent of the modern Three-Piece Suit. In order to let the shirt show through, the neck of the vest was left undone. By the turn of the 19th century, it became popular to utilise embroidery and brocade material.

==Transition from &quot;waistcoat&quot; to &quot;vest&quot; in the United States ==

=== Circa 1750–1850 ===
The waistcoat in the United States originated as formal wear to be worn underneath a coat. Waistcoats became more ornate including colour and decor.

=== Circa late 1800 ===
Waistcoats were styled with new and patterned fabrics but just on the front. Around this time it became popular to use less expensive, contrasting fabric on the back of the waistcoat design, allowing the owner to not spend as much money on the waistcoat as a whole. The fabrics utilised in the creation of these plain, unseen back panels were linen, cotton, or any other type of fabric used to line clothing items.

=== Circa 1870 ===
Waistcoat collars became longer and visible outside of the coat worn over it. These collars were stiffened and would peak out over the coat&#x27;s lapel. For both warmth against cold weather or to show off special weaves and contrasting colours, men often would layer their waistcoats.

=== Circa 1890 ===
The term vest completely replaced the British term waistcoat in American common vernacular. Waistcoat style followed the guidelines of 1700s England using the same fabric for the three-pieces, and sometimes used patterns of plaid or checks for contrast purposes.

===Circa 1900 ===
Around the turn of the 20th century, men were still wearing waistcoats for luxurious occasions. Waistcoats sometimes even included embroidery or hand-painted designs. At the same time, men began wearing the waistcoat apart from the totality of the three-piece suit and more casually with a variety of bottoms beyond the suit pant (khaki or jean). Waistcoats can be double-breasted with buttons set in a horseshoe pattern. The lower and top buttons may be left undone although not for riding or hunting. Beyond this, some waistcoats were made of certain durable fabrics to withstand being worn for outdoor sport such as fishing or hunting.

=== Circa 1970 ===
In the 1970s women began wearing waistcoats as part of their work attire. By the late 1990s and early 2000s it became fashionable for women to wear waistcoats as part of their casual wear.

==Typology==
Today, there are many types of vests. Some types of vests include but are not limited to:
* Biker (motorcycle) vest: The cut-off is a type of vest typically made from a denim or leather jacket with sleeves removed. Popular among bikers in North America and Europe, they are often decorated with patches of logos or pictures of biker related subjects.
* Fishing vest: carries a profusion of external pockets for carrying fishing tackle.
* Billiards or pool competitions: vests-waistcoats are worn as formal attire by competitors. 
* Army: many regiments especially cavalry have their own regimental waistcoats to be worn with formal outfits.
* Fringed vest: hippie movement of the 1960s inspired this folk style.
* Hunting vest: padded sleeveless jacket.
* Sweater vest: (American and Canadian English) This may also be called a slipover, sleeveless sweater, or, in British English, a tank top or wooly weskit. In Australia, this may be colloquially referred to as a baldwin.
* Puffer vest, body warmer, or gilet: a sleeveless jacket padded with down.
* Bar vest: A leather vest that worn primarily by gay leathermen as a fetish garment. Usually it has no buttons on the front.
* Robotic tech vest: a vest to ward off robots

<text>Voivod is a Canadian heavy metal band from Jonquière (now part of Saguenay) Quebec. The original line-up consisted of vocalist Denis &quot;Snake&quot; Bélanger, guitarist Denis &quot;Piggy&quot; D&#x27;Amour, drummer Michel &quot;Away&quot; Langevin and bassist Jean-Yves &quot;Blacky&quot; Thériault. The band has had numerous members changes throughout its -year career, with Langevin as the only consistent member. Their current line-up includes Langevin, Bélanger, Daniel &quot;Chewy&quot; Mongrain (guitar) and Dominic &quot;Rocky&quot; Laroche (bass).

Voivod&#x27;s musical style has changed several times since its inception. Starting out as a speed metal band, they have added a mix of progressive and thrash metal to create their own unique metal style, and have been credited as progenitors of the &quot;technical thrash metal&quot; sound along with Coroner, Watchtower, Dark Angel, Mekong Delta, Anacrusis and Blind Illusion, among others.

To date, Voivod have released sixteen studio albums, as well as one EP, one live album, two compilations, seven demos and one DVD featuring a live concert. They have been grouped with Sacrifice, Razor and Annihilator in the &quot;Big Four&quot; of Canadian thrash metal. The band found mainstream success in the late 1980s with their fifth studio album &quot;Nothingface&quot; (1989), which is Voivod&#x27;s only album to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, peaking at number 114. The band won the &quot;Visionary&quot; award at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards. In 2019, Voivod&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;The Wake&quot;, won the Juno Award for Metal/Hard Music Album of the Year. Voivod&#x27;s most recent studio album &quot;Morgöth Tales&quot;, a collection of re-recorded songs, was released in July 2023.

==History==
===Early career (1982–1990)===
Voivod was formed in 1982 in Jonquière, Quebec. Influenced equally by the new wave of British heavy metal, the burgeoning hardcore punk scene and 1970s progressive rock, Voivod forged a distinctive brand of heavy music that often relied on lyrical themes such as Reagan-era Cold War politics, post-apocalyptic literature and science fiction. &quot;Killing Technology&quot; (1987) began the band&#x27;s evolution in earnest, with the character from Voivod&#x27;s album covers (drawn by drummer Away and named &quot;Korgull&quot; on 1986&#x27;s &quot;Rrröööaaarrr&quot;) significantly being depicted in a spaceship. Drawing more heavily on hardcore punk than metal influences by this point, Voivod began evolving without the aid of increasing speed and storytelling on the following &quot;Dimension Hatross&quot;. Voivod was one of the first thrash bands from Canada to gain popularity outside of their country&#x27;s borders, reaching the peak of their global popularity with the 1989 album &quot;Nothingface&quot;, which featured a cover version of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;. Other covers include Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Nile Song&quot; on their 1993 album &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; and &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; by King Crimson on &quot;Phobos&quot;. Much of the band&#x27;s sound comes from guitarist Piggy&#x27;s use of dissonant chords, usually played in the high register of the guitar, combined with Blacky&#x27;s bass tone and chords as well, used extensively on &quot;Nothingface&quot;. Albums like &quot;Dimension Hatröss&quot; are dominated by unexpected time signatures and both Piggy and Blacky&#x27;s liberal use of dissonant, unconventional minor chords.

===Departures of Blacky and Snake, and Eric Forrest-era (1991–2000)===
Two of the four founding members (bassist Jean-Yves Thériault and vocalist Denis Bélanger) left Voivod in the early 1990s. Jean-Yves co-founded The Holy Body Tattoo, an avant-garde modern dance company based in Vancouver BC and also wrote extensively all the music for it, as well as other electronic music projects, while Denis Bélanger isolated himself and eventually started a new project, Union Made. Meanwhile, the band recorded four albums as a trio in the mid-to-late 1990s with new member Eric Forrest, nicknamed &quot;E-Force&quot;, handling both vocals and bass guitar. Forrest was seriously injured in a car accident in Germany in 1998, and that incarnation of Voivod never regained the momentum they lost during his rehabilitation. After Eric Forrest left the band, his insurance company attempted to sue the band for the injuries he sustained in the crash, as he was in the care of the band at the time.

===Reunion with Snake, arrival of Jasonic, and death of Piggy (2001–2006)===
Voivod briefly disbanded in 2001 before Bélanger returned to the band. The next incarnation of Voivod featured three of the four founding members: Denis Bélanger (a.k.a. &quot;Snake&quot;; vocals), Denis D&#x27;Amour (&quot;Piggy&quot;; guitars), and Michel Langevin (&quot;Away&quot;; drums) along with Jason Newsted (&quot;Jasonic&quot;, formerly of Metallica) on bass guitar. The album &quot;Voivod&quot; was released in 2003. Guitarist Denis D&#x27;Amour died at the age of 45 on August 26, 2005 due to complications from colon cancer. In July 2006 they released &quot;Katorz&quot;, based around riffs found on the laptop of D&#x27;Amour. Just prior to his death, he left instructions for his bandmates on how to use them. In November 2006, the song &quot;X-Stream&quot; was featured on &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot;.

===&quot;Infini&quot;, return of Blacky, and &quot;Target Earth&quot; (2007–2013)===

Voivod were planning to work on what was to be their final studio album in late 2007, which contained tracks recorded with D&#x27;Amour before his death. Voivod was part of the Heavy MTL show that was held in Montreal on June 22, 2008. Voivod also performed at the Monsters of Rock Festival in Calgary, Alberta, on July 26, 2008, and supported Judas Priest at the Bell Centre in Montreal, on August 12, 2008. Voivod also played a full set at Thrash Domination in Kawasaki, Japan, September 20–21, 2008, along with the bands Testament and Forbidden. The band consisted of Bélanger, Langevin, a returning &quot;Blacky&quot; Thériault, and Dan Mongrain on guitar.

In early January 2009, Voivod announced that they were putting the finishing touches on their new album and expected to release it in the spring of that year. The album, now known as &quot;Infini&quot;, was released on June 23, 2009.

By July 2010, Voivod had been writing and recording new music (including Dan Mongrain on guitar). On July 4, 2012, Voivod announced the title of their thirteenth studio album, &quot;Target Earth&quot;, which was released on January 22, 2013. &quot;Target Earth&quot; has a more progressive sound than some of their last few albums, and is a return to a more &quot;classic&quot; Voivod sound that can be heard on &quot;Dimension Hatross&quot; and &quot;Nothingface&quot;. All the music was written by Blacky and Chewy, while Snake focused on lyrics, and Away took care of the artwork.

===Second departure of Blacky and arrival of Dominic &quot;Rocky&quot; Laroche (2014–present)===
On July 10, 2014, it was reported that Blacky had left Voivod again. It was announced that he was forced out of the band. In late January 2015 the band released the new single &quot;We Are Connected&quot; which is the lead track from the 7-inch split vinyl disc with the band At the Gates. It is the first music to feature new bassist Dominic &quot;Rocky&quot; Laroche. They also released a new, five-track EP, entitled &quot;Post Society&quot;, featuring two new tracks and a cover of Hawkwind&#x27;s &quot;Silver Machine&quot;, on February 26, 2016.

As early as February 2015, Voivod began work on their fourteenth studio album, which was to be released in 2016 but later pushed back to 2017. The band was expected to begin recording the album in August 2017. In June 2017, Langevin told Rock Sverige that the songwriting was almost completed with an estimated release for early 2018. He also said that the album would probably be a double-album on vinyl due to the songs being &quot;really long and progressive&quot;, describing them as &quot;seven or eight minutes long songs&quot; and with it being a concept album as well. In November 2017, the members of Voivod began recording their next studio album, titled &quot;The Wake&quot;, which was released in September 2018.

In 2019, it was revealed that the master tapes for Voivod&#x27;s MCA-era albums were destroyed in the 2008 Universal Studios fire.

Voivod&#x27;s fifteenth studio album, &quot;Synchro Anarchy&quot;, was released on February 11, 2022. The band released &quot;Morgöth Tales&quot;, a collection of re-recorded songs, on July 21, 2023. The band also is currently writing new music for their next record.

==Musical style, influences, and legacy==
Voivod&#x27;s style has been classified as progressive metal, thrash metal, technical thrash metal, and avant-garde metal. Their earlier albums have been labeled speed metal, while &quot;Angel Rat&quot; has been labelled alternative metal.

The band has been praised for their unique approach, or cited as an influence, by other bands and artists such as Pantera, Meshuggah, Fear Factory, Jason Newsted (Voivod&#x27;s bassist for their 2000s albums), and Dave Grohl.

<text>The visual system is the physiological basis of visual perception (the ability to detect and process light). The system detects, transduces and interprets information concerning light within the visible range to construct an image and build a mental model of the surrounding environment. The visual system is associated with the eye and functionally divided into the optical system (including cornea and lens) and the neural system (including the retina and visual cortex).

The visual system performs a number of complex tasks based on the &quot;image forming&quot; functionality of the eye, including the formation of monocular images, the neural mechanisms underlying stereopsis and assessment of distances to (depth perception) and between objects, motion perception, pattern recognition, accurate motor coordination under visual guidance, and colour vision. Together, these facilitate higher order tasks, such as object identification. The neuropsychological side of visual information processing is known as visual perception, an abnormality of which is called visual impairment, and a complete absence of which is called blindness. The visual system also has several non-image forming visual functions, independent of visual perception, including the pupillary light reflex and circadian photoentrainment.

This article describes the human visual system, which is representative of mammalian vision, and to a lesser extent the vertebrate visual system.

== System overview ==

=== Optical ===
Together, the cornea and lens refract light into a small image and shine it on the retina. The retina transduces this image into electrical pulses using rods and cones. The optic nerve then carries these pulses through the optic canal. Upon reaching the optic chiasm the nerve fibers decussate (left becomes right). The fibers then branch and terminate in three places.

=== Neural ===
Most of the optic nerve fibers end in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Before the LGN forwards the pulses to V1 of the visual cortex (primary) it gauges the range of objects and tags every major object with a velocity tag. These tags predict object movement.

The LGN also sends some fibers to V2 and V3.

V1 performs edge-detection to understand spatial organization (initially, 40 milliseconds in, focusing on even small spatial and color changes. Then, 100 milliseconds in, upon receiving the translated LGN, V2, and V3 info, also begins focusing on global organization). V1 also creates a bottom-up saliency map to guide attention or gaze shift.

V2 both forwards (direct and via pulvinar) pulses to V1 and receives them. Pulvinar is responsible for saccade and visual attention. V2 serves much the same function as V1, however, it also handles illusory contours, determining depth by comparing left and right pulses (2D images), and foreground distinguishment. V2 connects to V1 - V5.

V3 helps process &#x27;global motion&#x27; (direction and speed) of objects. V3 connects to V1 (weak), V2, and the inferior temporal cortex.

V4 recognizes simple shapes, and gets input from V1 (strong), V2, V3, LGN, and pulvinar. V5&#x27;s outputs include V4 and its surrounding area, and eye-movement motor cortices (frontal eye-field and lateral intraparietal area).

V5&#x27;s functionality is similar to that of the other V&#x27;s, however, it integrates local object motion into global motion on a complex level. V6 works in conjunction with V5 on motion analysis. V5 analyzes self-motion, whereas V6 analyzes motion of objects relative to the background. V6&#x27;s primary input is V1, with V5 additions. V6 houses the topographical map for vision. V6 outputs to the region directly around it (V6A). V6A has direct connections to arm-moving cortices, including the premotor cortex.

The inferior temporal gyrus recognizes complex shapes, objects, and faces or, in conjunction with the hippocampus, creates new memories. The pretectal area is seven unique nuclei. Anterior, posterior and medial pretectal nuclei inhibit pain (indirectly), aid in REM, and aid the accommodation reflex, respectively. The Edinger-Westphal nucleus moderates pupil dilation and aids (since it provides parasympathetic fibers) in convergence of the eyes and lens adjustment. Nuclei of the optic tract are involved in smooth pursuit eye movement and the accommodation reflex, as well as REM.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus is the region of the hypothalamus that halts production of melatonin (indirectly) at first light.

==Structure==

* The eye, especially the retina
* The optic nerve
* The optic chiasma
* The optic tract
* The lateral geniculate body
* The optic radiation
* The visual cortex
* The visual association cortex.

These are components of the visual pathway, also called the optic pathway, that can be divided into anterior and posterior visual pathways. The anterior visual pathway refers to structures involved in vision before the lateral geniculate nucleus. The posterior visual pathway refers to structures after this point.

===Eye===

Light entering the eye is refracted as it passes through the cornea. It then passes through the pupil (controlled by the iris) and is further refracted by the lens. The cornea and lens act together as a compound lens to project an inverted image onto the retina.
====Retina====

The retina consists of many photoreceptor cells which contain particular protein molecules called opsins. In humans, two types of opsins are involved in conscious vision: rod opsins and cone opsins. (A third type, melanopsin in some retinal ganglion cells (RGC), part of the body clock mechanism, is probably not involved in conscious vision, as these RGC do not project to the lateral geniculate nucleus but to the pretectal olivary nucleus.) An opsin absorbs a photon (a particle of light) and transmits a signal to the cell through a signal transduction pathway, resulting in hyper-polarization of the photoreceptor.

Rods and cones differ in function. Rods are found primarily in the periphery of the retina and are used to see at low levels of light. Each human eye contains 120 million rods. Cones are found primarily in the center (or fovea) of the retina. There are three types of cones that differ in the wavelengths of light they absorb; they are usually called short or blue, middle or green, and long or red. Cones mediate day vision and can distinguish color and other features of the visual world at medium and high light levels. Cones are larger and much less numerous than rods (there are 6-7 million of them in each human eye).

In the retina, the photoreceptors synapse directly onto bipolar cells, which in turn synapse onto ganglion cells of the outermost layer, which then conduct action potentials to the brain. A significant amount of visual processing arises from the patterns of communication between neurons in the retina. About 130 million photo-receptors absorb light, yet roughly 1.2 million axons of ganglion cells transmit information from the retina to the brain. The processing in the retina includes the formation of center-surround receptive fields of bipolar and ganglion cells in the retina, as well as convergence and divergence from photoreceptor to bipolar cell. In addition, other neurons in the retina, particularly horizontal and amacrine cells, transmit information laterally (from a neuron in one layer to an adjacent neuron in the same layer), resulting in more complex receptive fields that can be either indifferent to color and sensitive to motion or sensitive to color and indifferent to motion.

===== Mechanism of generating visual signals =====
The retina adapts to change in light through the use of the rods. In the dark, the chromophore retinal has a bent shape called cis-retinal (referring to a &quot;cis&quot; conformation in one of the double bonds). When light interacts with the retinal, it changes conformation to a straight form called trans-retinal and breaks away from the opsin. This is called bleaching because the purified rhodopsin changes from violet to colorless in the light. At baseline in the dark, the rhodopsin absorbs no light and releases glutamate, which inhibits the bipolar cell. This inhibits the release of neurotransmitters from the bipolar cells to the ganglion cell. When there is light present, glutamate secretion ceases, thus no longer inhibiting the bipolar cell from releasing neurotransmitters to the ganglion cell and therefore an image can be detected.

The final result of all this processing is five different populations of ganglion cells that send visual (image-forming and non-image-forming) information to the brain:
#M cells, with large center-surround receptive fields that are sensitive to depth, indifferent to color, and rapidly adapt to a stimulus;
#P cells, with smaller center-surround receptive fields that are sensitive to color and shape;
#K cells, with very large center-only receptive fields that are sensitive to color and indifferent to shape or depth;
#another population that is intrinsically photosensitive; and
#a final population that is used for eye movements.

A 2006 University of Pennsylvania study calculated the approximate bandwidth of human retinas to be about 8,960 kilobits per second, whereas guinea pig retinas transfer at about 875 kilobits.

In 2007 Zaidi and co-researchers on both sides of the Atlantic studying patients without rods and cones, discovered that the novel photoreceptive ganglion cell in humans also has a role in conscious and unconscious visual perception. The peak spectral sensitivity was 481 nm. This shows that there are two pathways for vision in the retina – one based on classic photoreceptors (rods and cones) and the other, newly discovered, based on photo-receptive ganglion cells which act as rudimentary visual brightness detectors.

====Photochemistry====

The functioning of a camera is often compared with the workings of the eye, mostly since both focus light from external objects in the field of view onto a light-sensitive medium. In the case of the camera, this medium is film or an electronic sensor; in the case of the eye, it is an array of visual receptors. With this simple geometrical similarity, based on the laws of optics, the eye functions as a transducer, as does a CCD camera.

In the visual system, retinal, technically called &quot;retinene&quot;1 or &quot;retinaldehyde&quot;, is a light-sensitive molecule found in the rods and cones of the retina. Retinal is the fundamental structure involved in the transduction of light into visual signals, i.e. nerve impulses in the ocular system of the central nervous system. In the presence of light, the retinal molecule changes configuration and as a result, a nerve impulse is generated.

===Optic nerve===
The information about the image via the eye is transmitted to the brain along the optic nerve. Different populations of ganglion cells in the retina send information to the brain through the optic nerve. About 90% of the axons in the optic nerve go to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus. These axons originate from the M, P, and K ganglion cells in the retina, see above. This parallel processing is important for reconstructing the visual world; each type of information will go through a different route to perception. Another population sends information to the superior colliculus in the midbrain, which assists in controlling eye movements (saccades) as well as other motor responses.

A final population of photosensitive ganglion cells, containing melanopsin for photosensitivity, sends information via the retinohypothalamic tract to the pretectum (pupillary reflex), to several structures involved in the control of circadian rhythms and sleep such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (the biological clock), and to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (a region involved in sleep regulation). A recently discovered role for photoreceptive ganglion cells is that they mediate conscious and unconscious vision – acting as rudimentary visual brightness detectors as shown in rodless coneless eyes.

===Optic chiasm===

The optic nerves from both eyes meet and cross at the optic chiasm, at the base of the hypothalamus of the brain. At this point, the information coming from both eyes is combined and then splits according to the visual field. The corresponding halves of the field of view (right and left) are sent to the left and right halves of the brain, respectively, to be processed. That is, the right side of primary visual cortex deals with the left half of the &quot;field of view&quot; from both eyes, and similarly for the left brain. A small region in the center of the field of view is processed redundantly by both halves of the brain.

===Optic tract===

Information from the right &quot;visual field&quot; (now on the left side of the brain) travels in the left optic tract. Information from the left &quot;visual field&quot; travels in the right optic tract. Each optic tract terminates in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the thalamus.
===Lateral geniculate nucleus===

The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is a sensory relay nucleus in the thalamus of the brain. The LGN consists of six layers in humans and other primates starting from catarrhines, including cercopithecidae and apes. Layers 1, 4, and 6 correspond to information from the contralateral (crossed) fibers of the nasal retina (temporal visual field); layers 2, 3, and 5 correspond to information from the ipsilateral (uncrossed) fibers of the temporal retina (nasal visual field).

Layer one contains M cells, which correspond to the M (magnocellular) cells of the optic nerve of the opposite eye and are concerned with depth or motion. Layers four and six of the LGN also connect to the opposite eye, but to the P cells (color and edges) of the optic nerve. By contrast, layers two, three and five of the LGN connect to the M cells and P (parvocellular) cells of the optic nerve for the same side of the brain as its respective LGN.

Spread out, the six layers of the LGN are the area of a credit card and about three times its thickness. The LGN is rolled up into two ellipsoids about the size and shape of two small birds&#x27; eggs. In between the six layers are smaller cells that receive information from the K cells (color) in the retina. The neurons of the LGN then relay the visual image to the primary visual cortex (V1) which is located at the back of the brain (posterior end) in the occipital lobe in and close to the calcarine sulcus. The LGN is not just a simple relay station, but it is also a center for processing; it receives reciprocal input from the cortical and subcortical layers and reciprocal innervation from the visual cortex.

===Optic radiation===
The optic radiations, one on each side of the brain, carry information from the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus to layer 4 of the visual cortex. The P layer neurons of the LGN relay to V1 layer 4C β. The M layer neurons relay to V1 layer 4C α. The K layer neurons in the LGN relay to large neurons called blobs in layers 2 and 3 of V1.

There is a direct correspondence from an angular position in the visual field of the eye, all the way through the optic tract to a nerve position in V1 up to V4, i.e. the primary visual areas. After that, the visual pathway is roughly separated into a ventral and dorsal pathway.

===Visual cortex===
The visual cortex is responsible for processing the visual image. It lies at the rear of the brain (highlighted in the image), above the cerebellum. The region that receives information directly from the LGN is called the primary visual cortex (also called V1 and striate cortex). It creates a bottom-up saliency map of the visual field to guide attention or eye gaze to salient visual locations. Hence selection of visual input information by attention starts at V1 along the visual pathway.

Visual information then flows through a cortical hierarchy. These areas include V2, V3, V4 and area V5/MT. (The exact connectivity depends on the species of the animal.) These secondary visual areas (collectively termed the extrastriate visual cortex) process a wide variety of visual primitives. Neurons in V1 and V2 respond selectively to bars of specific orientations, or combinations of bars. These are believed to support edge and corner detection. Similarly, basic information about color and motion is processed here.

Heider, et al. (2002) found that neurons involving V1, V2, and V3 can detect stereoscopic illusory contours; they found that stereoscopic stimuli subtending up to 8° can activate these neurons.

===Visual association cortex===

As visual information passes forward through the visual hierarchy, the complexity of the neural representations increases. Whereas a V1 neuron may respond selectively to a line segment of a particular orientation in a particular retinotopic location, neurons in the lateral occipital complex respond selectively to a complete object (e.g., a figure drawing), and neurons in the visual association cortex may respond selectively to human faces, or to a particular object.

Along with this increasing complexity of neural representation may come a level of specialization of processing into two distinct pathways: the dorsal stream and the ventral stream (the Two Streams hypothesis, first proposed by Ungerleider and Mishkin in 1982). The dorsal stream, commonly referred to as the &quot;where&quot; stream, is involved in spatial attention (covert and overt), and communicates with regions that control eye movements and hand movements. More recently, this area has been called the &quot;how&quot; stream to emphasize its role in guiding behaviors to spatial locations. The ventral stream, commonly referred to as the &quot;what&quot; stream, is involved in the recognition, identification and categorization of visual stimuli.

However, there is still much debate about the degree of specialization within these two pathways, since they are in fact heavily interconnected.

Horace Barlow proposed the &quot;efficient coding hypothesis&quot; in 1961 as a theoretical model of sensory coding in the brain. Limitations in the applicability of this theory in the primary visual cortex (V1) motivated the V1 Saliency Hypothesis that V1 creates a bottom-up saliency map to guide attention exogenously. With attentional selection as a center stage, vision is seen as composed of encoding, selection, and decoding stages.

The default mode network is a network of brain regions that are active when an individual is awake and at rest. The visual system&#x27;s default mode can be monitored during resting state fMRI:
Fox, et al. (2005) found that &quot;the human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anticorrelated functional networks&quot;, in which the visual system switches from resting state to attention.

In the parietal lobe, the lateral and ventral intraparietal cortex are involved in visual attention and saccadic eye movements. These regions are in the intraparietal sulcus (marked in red in the adjacent image).

==Development==

===Infancy===

Newborn infants have limited color perception. One study found that 74% of newborns can distinguish red, 36% green, 25% yellow, and 14% blue. After one month, performance &quot;improved somewhat.&quot; Infant&#x27;s eyes do not have the ability to accommodate. Pediatricians are able to perform non-verbal testing to assess visual acuity of a newborn, detect nearsightedness and astigmatism, and evaluate the eye teaming and alignment. Visual acuity improves from about 20/400 at birth to approximately 20/25 at 6 months of age. This happens because the nerve cells in the retina and brain that control vision are not fully developed.

===Childhood and adolescence===

Depth perception, focus, tracking and other aspects of vision continue to develop throughout early and middle childhood. From recent studies in the United States and Australia there is some evidence that the amount of time school aged children spend outdoors, in natural light, may have some impact on whether they develop myopia. The condition tends to get somewhat worse through childhood and adolescence, but stabilizes in adulthood. More prominent myopia (nearsightedness) and astigmatism are thought to be inherited. Children with this condition may need to wear glasses.

===Adulthood===

Vision is often one of the first senses affected by aging. A number of changes occur with aging:
* Over time, the lens becomes yellowed and may eventually become brown, a condition known as brunescence or brunescent cataract. Although many factors contribute to yellowing, lifetime exposure to ultraviolet light and aging are two main causes.
* The lens becomes less flexible, diminishing the ability to accommodate (presbyopia).
* While a healthy adult pupil typically has a size range of 2–8 mm, with age the range gets smaller, trending towards a moderately small diameter.
* On average tear production declines with age. However, there are a number of age-related conditions that can cause excessive tearing.

==Other functions==

===Balance===
Along with proprioception and vestibular function, the visual system plays an important role in the ability of an individual to control balance and maintain an upright posture. When these three conditions are isolated and balance is tested, it has been found that vision is the most significant contributor to balance, playing a bigger role than either of the two other intrinsic mechanisms. The clarity with which an individual can see his environment, as well as the size of the visual field, the susceptibility of the individual to light and glare, and poor depth perception play important roles in providing a feedback loop to the brain on the body&#x27;s movement through the environment. Anything that affects any of these variables can have a negative effect on balance and maintaining posture. This effect has been seen in research involving elderly subjects when compared to young controls, in glaucoma patients compared to age matched controls, cataract patients pre and post surgery, and even something as simple as wearing safety goggles. Monocular vision (one eyed vision) has also been shown to negatively impact balance, which was seen in the previously referenced cataract and glaucoma studies, as well as in healthy children and adults.

According to Pollock et al. (2010) stroke is the main cause of specific visual impairment, most frequently visual field loss (homonymous hemianopia, a visual field defect). Nevertheless, evidence for the efficacy of cost-effective interventions aimed at these visual field defects is still inconsistent.

==Clinical significance==

Proper function of the visual system is required for sensing, processing, and understanding the surrounding environment. Difficulty in sensing, processing and understanding light input has the potential to adversely impact an individual&#x27;s ability to communicate, learn and effectively complete routine tasks on a daily basis.

In children, early diagnosis and treatment of impaired visual system function is an important factor in ensuring that key social, academic and speech/language developmental milestones are met.

Cataract is clouding of the lens, which in turn affects vision. Although it may be accompanied by yellowing, clouding and yellowing can occur separately. This is typically a result of ageing, disease, or drug use.

Presbyopia is a visual condition that causes farsightedness. The eye&#x27;s lens becomes too inflexible to accommodate to normal reading distance, focus tending to remain fixed at long distance.

Glaucoma is a type of blindness that begins at the edge of the visual field and progresses inward. It may result in tunnel vision. This typically involves the outer layers of the optic nerve, sometimes as a result of buildup of fluid and excessive pressure in the eye.

Scotoma is a type of blindness that produces a small blind spot in the visual field typically caused by injury in the primary visual cortex.

Homonymous hemianopia is a type of blindness that destroys one entire side of the visual field typically caused by injury in the primary visual cortex.

Quadrantanopia is a type of blindness that destroys only a part of the visual field typically caused by partial injury in the primary visual cortex. This is very similar to homonymous hemianopia, but to a lesser degree.

Prosopagnosia, or face blindness, is a brain disorder that produces an inability to recognize faces. This disorder often arises after damage to the fusiform face area.

Visual agnosia, or visual-form agnosia, is a brain disorder that produces an inability to recognize objects. This disorder often arises after damage to the ventral stream.

==Other animals==

Different species are able to see different parts of the light spectrum; for example, bees can see into the ultraviolet, while pit vipers can accurately target prey with their pit organs, which are sensitive to infrared radiation. The mantis shrimp possesses arguably the most complex visual system of any species. The eye of the mantis shrimp holds 16 color receptive cones, whereas humans only have three. The variety of cones enables them to perceive an enhanced array of colors as a mechanism for mate selection, avoidance of predators, and detection of prey. Swordfish also possess an impressive visual system. The eye of a swordfish can generate heat to better cope with detecting their prey at depths of 2000 feet. Certain one-celled microorganisms, the warnowiid dinoflagellates have eye-like ocelloids, with analogous structures for the lens and retina of the multi-cellular eye. The armored shell of the chiton &quot;Acanthopleura granulata&quot; is also covered with hundreds of aragonite crystalline eyes, named ocelli, which can form images.

Many fan worms, such as &quot;Acromegalomma interruptum&quot; which live in tubes on the sea floor of the Great Barrier Reef, have evolved compound eyes on their tentacles, which they use to detect encroaching movement. If movement is detected, the fan worms will rapidly withdraw their tentacles. Bok, et al., have discovered opsins and G proteins in the fan worm&#x27;s eyes, which were previously only seen in simple ciliary photoreceptors in the brains of some invertebrates, as opposed to the rhabdomeric receptors in the eyes of most invertebrates.

Only higher primate Old World (African) monkeys and apes (macaques, apes, orangutans) have the same kind of three-cone photoreceptor color vision humans have, while lower primate New World (South American) monkeys (spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys, cebus monkeys) have a two-cone photoreceptor kind of color vision.

Biologists have determined that humans have extremely good vision compared to the overwhelming majority of animals, particularly in daylight, surpassed only by a few large species of predatory birds. Other animals such as dogs are thought to rely more on senses other than vision, which in turn may be better developed than in humans.

==History==
In the second half of the 19th century, many motifs of the nervous system were identified such as the neuron doctrine and brain localization, which related to the neuron being the basic unit of the nervous system and functional localisation in the brain, respectively. These would become tenets of the fledgling neuroscience and would support further understanding of the visual system.

The notion that the cerebral cortex is divided into functionally distinct cortices now known to be responsible for capacities such as touch (somatosensory cortex), movement (motor cortex), and vision (visual cortex), was first proposed by Franz Joseph Gall in 1810. Evidence for functionally distinct areas of the brain (and, specifically, of the cerebral cortex) mounted throughout the 19th century with discoveries by Paul Broca of the language center (1861), and Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig of the motor cortex (1871). Based on selective damage to parts of the brain and the functional effects of the resulting lesions, David Ferrier proposed that visual function was localized to the parietal lobe of the brain in 1876. In 1881, Hermann Munk more accurately located vision in the occipital lobe, where the primary visual cortex is now known to be.

In 2014, a textbook &quot;Understanding vision: theory, models, and data&quot; illustrates how to link neurobiological data and visual behavior/psychological data through theoretical principles and computational models.

<doc id="305145" wikidata="Q579705" url="?curid=305145" title="Hubcap">
<text>A hubcap or hub cap is a decorative disk on an automobile wheel that covers at minimum the central portion of the wheel, called the hub. An automobile hubcap is used to cover the wheel hub and the wheel fasteners to reduce the accumulation of dirt and moisture. It also has the function of decorating the car.

A hubcap is technically a small cover over the center of the wheel, while a wheel cover is a decorative metal or plastic disk that snaps or bolts onto and covers the entire face of the wheel.

Cars with stamped steel wheels often use a full-wheel cover that conceals the entire wheel. Cars with alloy wheels or styled steel wheels generally use smaller hubcaps, sometimes called center caps.

Alternatively, a wheel cover or spare tire cover can be an accessory that covers an external rear-mounted spare tire found on some automobiles.

==History==
Hubcaps were first used on the Newton Reaction Carriage in 1680. The first hubcaps were more commonly known as dust or grease caps. These caps are threaded onto the center hub on the wood, steel, or wire wheel. These were made from the beginning of car manufacturing to 1932. Pre-1915 hubcaps were all mostly made of brass that was nickel-plated. The 1920s hubcaps were mostly aluminum. Grease caps of the wire wheel brands such as Houk, Hayes, Frayer, Dayton, Buffalo, House, Phelps, Pasco, Rudge Whitworth, Budd, and Stewart are some of the hardest to find. When a customer went to buy the wire wheels, the make of the vehicle would be stamped in the center. During 1927 and 1928, the first snap-on center caps were being made on the wire wheels. After 1932, almost every car had a snap-on style center cap on the middle of their wire, steel, or wood wheels. Wire wheel center caps in the 1930s had a spring-loaded retention clip system that has been used on many hubcaps and center caps on every style of car and truck to the present day.

Steel wheels in the 1930s had retention clips mounted to the wheel that snapped into a lip in the back of the cap. Wood wheels were a special option. The caps on these had a large chrome base that mushroomed up to another smaller chrome base that would have the emblem on the face. The &quot;stem&quot; up to the second base was usually painted black to make it look as if the top base was floating. These caps were usually made of brass, steel, or aluminum. During the mid-1930s the first full wheel covers were introduced to fit over the entire wheel, except for a small portion of the rim closest to the rubber tire.

Cord and Hudson were the early adopters. Cord made a plain chrome wheel cover that had a smooth top and holes in the side. The Hudson wheel cover was flat with a lip halfway to the middle and the center would say &quot;Hudson&quot;, &quot;Hudson Eight&quot;, or &quot;Terraplane&quot;. This configuration differs from the &quot;knock-off&quot; spinners found on some racing cars and cars equipped with true wire wheels. While the knock-off spinner resembles an early hubcap, its threads also retain the wheel itself, in lieu of lug nuts.

When pressed steel wheels became common by the 1940s, these were often painted the same color as the car body. Hubcaps expanded in size to cover the lug nuts that were used to mount these steel wheels. They then serve to protect the lug nuts or wheel bolts from rust and corrosion that could make them hard to remove when it was necessary to change the wheel to repair a tire.

An option on some cars was a chrome-plated trim ring that clipped onto the outer rim of the wheel, in addition to the center hubcap. The full wheel cover became popular that covered the entire wheel. These became increasingly decorative in style and were typically made from chrome-plated or stainless steel. Basic automobiles came standard with simple, unadorned, and inexpensive hubcaps called &quot;poverty caps&quot; or &quot;dog dish caps&quot; due to their size and shape. Various optional full wheel covers of various designs were optional or were standard equipment on higher trim models. Metal hubcaps also offer an audible warning should a wheel nut work its way off. During the 1960s and 1970s, automakers also offered stainless steel spoke full wheel covers that simulated the look of traditional, and more costly, wire-spoke wheels.

Specialty wheels of magnesium or aluminum alloy had come onto the market, and wheel covers were a cheap means of imitating their styling. Plastic wheel covers (known in the UK as wheel trims) appeared in the 1970s and became mainstream in the 1980s. The first domestic automobile to use a full plastic wheel cover was the Chevy Monza which featured a &quot;wind blade&quot; design and came in several colors.

The variety and number of hubcaps available as original equipment have increased. Plastic has now largely replaced steel as the primary material for manufacturing hubcaps and trims, and where steel wheels are still used, the wheels are now generally painted black so the wheel is less visible through cutouts in the wheel trim. On modern automobiles, full-wheel hubcaps are most commonly seen on budget models and base trim levels, while upscale and performance-oriented models use alloy wheels. Even modern aluminum alloy wheels generally use small removable center caps, similar in size to the earliest hubcaps. The variety of wheel trims on any particular car has expanded significantly, for example, a 2003 BMW Z3 had 23 different wheel options.

==Characteristics and design==
Often a hubcap will bear the trademark or symbol of the maker of the automobile or the maker of the hubcap. Early hubcaps were often chrome-plated, and many had decorative, non-functional spokes. Hubcaps were immortalized in the Art Deco styling near the top of one rung of setbacks (ornamental frieze) incorporates a band of hubcaps on the Chrysler Building in midtown Manhattan.

Part of the lore of hubcaps is that on bad roads they have a tendency of falling off due to hitting a bump. Center caps, however, fall off less frequently than older full wheel covers, which were often quite heavy. In some parts of the U.S. and in Mexico there are automotive garages whose walls were decorated with various hubcaps that had fallen off in the vicinity; they were often for sale.

This problem persists even with different retention systems that have been engineered. Hubcaps generally use either clip-on retention, where some type of spring steel clip (or plastic clip in the case of plastic hubcaps) engages a groove in the wheel, or bolt-on retention, where a threaded fastener retains the hubcap, or a plastic washer attached to the lugnut itself holds the hubcap on. Clip-on hubcaps tend to pop off suddenly when the wheel impacts a pothole or curbstone, while bolt-on hubcaps are more likely to vibrate loose over time, and tend to rattle and squeak.

To prevent the loss, owners attach plastic wheel trims to the wheel itself using an electrical zip tie, which are sold in silver color for this purpose. A kit consisting of spare zip ties, a pair of cutting pliers, and latex gloves allow a trim thus secured to be removed easily in the event of a tire puncture.

In the U.S., during the age of custom cars (the 1950s–early 1960s), decorating one&#x27;s car with the wheel covers from another was common. Two very desirable wheel covers were those of the 1950 Cadillac (called the &quot;Sombrero&quot;) and that of the 1953 to 1955 Oldsmobile, which resembled a huge, three-tined spinner. Aftermarket suppliers included the &quot;Mooneyes&quot; brand (named after the firm&#x27;s founder Dean Moon) hubcaps and wheel covers that were some of the first independently offered for hot rods and custom cars.

=== Motorsport use ===
Another variant of the wheel cover, known also as &quot;wheel shrouds&quot;, &quot;rim blanking&quot; or &quot;turbofans&quot;, is associated with the German wheelmaking brand BBS since the 1970s. These are attached to the wheel first, then bolted on as if the driver or mechanic is bolting the wheel to his car in the manner of changing their wheel. Commonly made from aluminum, they are designed to distribute airflow to the brakes, thereby generating downforce depending on the shape. Thus, these wheel covers are functional rather than merely decorative.

From 2006, to get around FIA technical regulations that &quot;all wheels must be made from an homogeneous metallic material&quot;, a carbon fiber variant found its way into Formula One when it was used by Scuderia Ferrari whom BBS supply its wheels to. At the Turkish Grand Prix, the rear shrouds were also adopted by Toyota and Toro Rosso and thus their use became widespread for all teams. Prior to being banned from the 1994 PPG Indy Car World Series, wheel shrouds were popular on superspeedways until Team Penske revealed that those covers could reduce drag by 2.5%.

Another type of wheel cover, the &quot;static wheel fairing&quot;, was introduced by BBS for Ferrari at the British Grand Prix to act as a brake cooling aid for front wheels while remaining stationary the wheel itself with one part being cut out at a 27° angle to enable hot air to escape and thus became adopted by every team. The wheel covers were banned from use in F1 from the 2010 season after incidents where they broke loose in races. To get around the ban, Ferrari used a detachable integral aero device made from the same magnesium material as the wheel itself, which consisted of double concentric rings of different diameters. As parts of cars now have to be homologated, its rivals were unable to copy this device. Its use became eliminated when the FIA revised the regulations for 2011 season to prohibit wheel materials in certain exclusion zones.

===Non-rotating hubcap===
A non-rotating hubcap retains the same orientation even when a vehicle is in motion. An example is the Rolls-Royce whose hubcap centers are weighted and mounted to revolve independently of the wheel rotation, thus the RR logo can be read while the vehicle is in motion.

This design also allows for messages or advertising to be placed on the hubcap and be read while the vehicle is moving. Non-rotating hubcaps with advertisements may be found on race cars, taxis, commercial vehicles, industrial machinery, buses, and golf carts.

==Nave plate==
A nave plate is a British name for a hubcap. These chromed disks were decorative embellishments on British cars, such as those made by Triumph.

These plates can also cover the entire wheel. Nave plates were used in the 1920s and 1930s to cover wire wheels (which are lighter and truer running than more conventional pressed steel wheels) to make them appear modern and streamlined as well as to make it easier to keep them clean.

<text>The steelpan (also known as a pan or steel drum) is a musical instrument originating in Trinidad and Tobago. Steelpan musicians are called pannists.

In 1992, the steelpan was declared Trinidad and Tobago’s national instrument by Prime Minister Patrick Manning. This helped turn the steelpan into a source of national pride and cultural identity, recognized both locally and internationally.

In 2023, the United Nations General Assembly declared August 11 as World Steelpan Day. The following year, the Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago officially recognised the steelpan as the country&#x27;s national instrument.

==Description==
The modern pan is a chromatically pitched percussion instrument made from 200-litre industrial drums.

&quot;Drum&quot; refers to the steel drum containers from which the pans are made; the steel drum is more correctly called a &quot;steel pan&quot; or &quot;pan&quot; as it falls into the idiophone family of instruments, and so is not a drum (which is a membranophone). Some steelpans are made to play in the Pythagorean musical cycle of fourths and fifths.

A pan is played using a pair of straight sticks tipped with rubber; the size and type of rubber tip varies according to the class of pan being played. Some musicians use four pansticks, holding two in each hand. This grew out of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s early 20th-century Carnival percussion groups known as tamboo bamboo.

The pan is the national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago and will soon appear on the country&#x27;s redrawn coat of arms.

==Origin==
Steelpans developed in the early to mid 1900s, but with roots going back much earlier, including the talking drums of West African cultures. The hourglass-shaped drums were used for communicating messages at a distance with drum language. For example, the rhythm and pitch could indicate the location, time, and even type of dancing during an upcoming ceremony.

In the 18th century, people from West Africa were exchanged for goods from African traders and transported to the Americas including Trinidad. Persons of the same tribes and languages were deliberately separated and sold to different enslavers in an attempt to eradicate their traditions. In most cases, enslavers did not allow them to speak in their native tongues, forcing them to give up tradition and learn the enslaver&#x27;s own language.

In the 1780s, French colonists arrived in Trinidad and Tobago and brought street festival traditions. In 1785, plantation owners held the first Carnival in Trinidad. Many white plantation owners masqueraded as slaves (presumably in blackface) and marched down the streets mocking African slave dress, singing, and dance customs, including banging on talking drums. Though they were mimicked, enslaved Africans were not allowed to join the festivities. In response, the Africans organized underground Carnivals of their own, taking place in cabins and backyards. Inspired by ancient traditions, Africans incorporated masks, feathers, beads, and drumming.

In 1789, Spanish governor of Trinidad José María Chacón issued a directive that all Africans (the majority of the population) would observe Roman Catholic religion and all Christian holy days. The purpose was to further erase West African culture and religious beliefs. However, the enslaved Africans were able to preserve their traditions by camouflaging them within Christian holidays. For example, on Sundays, enslaved people would &quot;put on their best clothes and go to drum dances held in different yards or on the land away from the plantation where they were allowed to grow their own crops...[They] would dance to the music and rhythms of the skin drums and gourd rattles.&quot;

In 1834, slaves were emancipated in Trinidad and Tobago following the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, but segregation and indentured servitude continued. After emancipation, Africans annually celebrated Canboulay, a harvest festival involving calypso drumming. In 1881, the Canboulay riots occurred, which were a series of revolts during the festival. After this, stick-fighting and African percussion music were banned throughout the 1880s. They were replaced by bamboo sticks beaten together, which were themselves banned in turn. 

In 1937 they reappeared in Laventille, transformed as an orchestra of frying pans, dustbin lids, and oil drums. These steelpans are now a major part of the Trinidadian music scene and are a popular section of the Canboulay music contests. In 1941, the U.S. Navy established a presence in Trinidad. The pannists, who were associated with lawlessness and violence, helped to popularise steelpan music among the soldiers, which began its international popularisation. At the time of the steelpan&#x27;s popularity in Trinidad it was seen as being associated with a violent or derelict crowd. It was unacceptable for women to be involved in such activities. Culturally the stigma was focused on the idea that women belonged in the home or with the children and not out in the street with the pan players. As the instrument became more mainstream women were allowed to join and the stigma that went along with playing the instrument subsided.

The first instruments developed in the evolution of steelpan were tamboo bamboos, tunable sticks made of bamboo wood. These were hit onto the ground and with other sticks in order to produce sound. Tamboo bamboo bands included percussion of a (gin) bottle and spoon. By the mid-1930s, bits of metal percussion were being used in the tamboo bamboo bands, the first probably being either the automobile brake hub &quot;iron&quot; or the biscuit drum &quot;boom&quot;. The former replaced the gin bottle-and-spoon, and the latter the &quot;bass&quot; bamboo that was pounded on the ground. In 1939 the first all-steel band, Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band, emerged, and by 1940 it had become the preferred carnival accompaniment of young underprivileged men.

The 55-gallon oil drum was used to make steelpans from around 1947. The Trinidad All-Steel Pan Percussion Orchestra (TASPO), formed to attend the Festival of Britain in 1951, was the first steelband whose instruments were all made from oil drums. They performed July 26, thus introducing the steelpan and a new music genre to the world. 2022 Google Doodle commemorated the event. Members of TASPO included Ellie Mannette and Winston &quot;Spree&quot; Simon. Hugh Borde led the National Steel Band of Trinidad &amp; Tobago at the Commonwealth Arts Festival in England, as well as the Esso Tripoli Steel Band, which played at the World&#x27;s Fair in Montreal, Canada, and later toured with Liberace. They were featured on an album with him.

Three steel pans were used onstage in the 1954 Broadway musical House of Flowers. When Trinidadian-born dancer Geoffrey Holder was hired for its cast, he suggested the incorporation of three drummers from his dance company, Michael Alexander (who made the instruments), Roderick Clavery, and Alphonso Marshall; the three doubled as dancers in the show.

===Evolution and developments===

Anthony Williams designed the &quot;fourths and fifths&quot; arrangement of notes, known as the circle of fifths. This has become the standard form of note placement for lead pans. Other important developments include the tuning of harmonic overtones in individual notes, developed simultaneously and independently by Bertie Marshall and Alan Gervais.

In the United States, steelpan instruments were marketed as early as 1961.

The Caribbean Research Institute CARIRI investigated possibilities to mass-produce raw forms with the use of pressing machines in the 1970s. Much of this project took place in Sweden in collaboration with the Saab Company. Although first results were promising, the project has been abandoned due to lack of finances and support by local pan tuners in Trinidad. Another method of shaping the pan was attempted: by spinning. The pan was spun on a lathe-like device, and a roller on the end of a bar was used to sink the pan. While this did create pre-sunk pans, a problem was that there would often be scratches and grooves in the steel.

A Swiss steelpan manufacturer (PANArt) researched the field of fine-grain sheet steel and developed a deep-drawn raw form which was additionally hardened by nitriding. This process, and the new instruments they called &quot;pang&quot;, were presented at the International Conference of Steel pan and Science in Port-of-Spain in 2000.

Electronic steelpans have also been developed. One such version is the E-Pan, invented by Salmon Cupid, who holds utility patents for it. Another is the Percussive Harmonic Instrument (PHI).

==Construction==

The note&#x27;s size corresponds to the pitch—the larger the oval, the lower the tone.

The size of the instrument varies from one pan to another. It may have almost all of the &quot;skirt&quot; (the cylindrical part of the oil drum) cut off and around 30 soprano-range notes. It may use the entire drum with only three bass notes per pan, in which case one person may play six such pans. The length of the skirt generally corresponds to the &quot;tessitura&quot; (high or low range) of the drum. The pans are usually either painted or chrome plated. Other processes such as nickel plating, powdercoating, or hardening can also be applied as a finish.

Despite being a relatively new member of the percussion family, steelpan tuning techniques have advanced rapidly. Strobe tuners are ideally suited for the task. The need to see the first few overtones further makes a strobe tuner a necessity for steelpan tuning. Steelpan makers have used strobe tuners since it was discovered that, by adjusting the overtones (first (fundamental), second, and third partial), the pan&#x27;s sound seemed to sparkle in a way that it did not previously.

There are several ways in which a steelpan may become out of tune (most commonly this is caused by playing the steelpan with excessive force and incorrect handling) and it is quite common that steelbands arrange to have their instruments tuned once or twice a year. A tuner must have great skill in their work to manage to make the notes sound both good and at the correct pitch. Much of the tuning work is performed using hammers.

==Classification==
In the beginning of the steelband movement, players would play a single pan only, now commonly called &quot;around the neck&quot; instruments. Later on, some steelpans became chromatic by using multiple pans, particularly for the bass registers, which have fewer notes per pan owing to the larger sizes of the lower note areas. Following are some of the most popular instruments:

==Music and competitions==
The repertoire of the steelband is extensive. Steelbands in Trinidad have a tradition of re-interpreting the current year&#x27;s calypsos for carnival performance; rarely will a calypso from a previous year be heard at carnival or the Panorama music competition. Bands that perform all year round (both in Trinidad and world-wide) have long prided themselves on being able to perform many types of music, particularly Latin and jazz numbers, film music and other popular tunes. Pannists also have a tradition of performing classical music which dates back to 1946, both in calypso tempo (known as &quot;The Bomb&quot;) and straight (generally in concert or music festival contexts). In these contexts, accuracy and faithfulness to the original are highly prized.

An international festival, the World Steelband Music Festival, has been held intermittently in Trinidad since 1964, where steelbands perform a test piece (sometimes specially composed, or a selected calypso); a piece of choice (very often a &quot;classic&quot; or European art-music work); and calypso of choice, in a concert-style venue. Panorama, the largest steelband contest in the world, occurs during Carnival celebrations in Trinidad. In 2020, the world&#x27;s first online steelpan competition, PanoGrama, was launched by Nevin Roach. Since 1978 a national Panorama competition has been held in the United Kingdom as part of the annual Notting Hill Carnival celebration. Brooklyn, NY, home to a large West Indian population, has hosted an annual Steelband Panorama since 1972 as part of its annual Labor Day Carnival festivities.

Steelpans were introduced to the genre of jazz fusion by players such as Dave Samuels and Othello Molineaux in the 1970s, and Jonathan Scales in the 2000s. They are featured in the early fusion album &quot;Morning Dance&quot; by Spyro Gyra.

==Pannists==

A pannist (sometimes &quot;panist&quot; or &quot;panman&quot;), is a person who plays the steelpan. A professional pannist may perform solo, play with a steel band, or accompany singers or solo instrumentalists.

Pannists may play with their respective bands in large competitions, and generally memorize everything that they perform.

The pannist&#x27;s top position in a Panorama steelband is that of the captain. These large ensembles often include section leaders: accomplished pannists that monitor the various voices in the band.

Influential pannists include Ellie Mannette, the &quot;Father of the Modern Steel Drum&quot; and an accomplished panman, and Winston &quot;Spree&quot; Simon, the inventor and a skilled player of the &quot;Ping Pong&quot; pan.

<text>A railroad worm is a larva or larviform female adult of a beetle of the genus Phrixothrix in the family Phengodidae, characterized by the possession of two different colors of bioluminescence. It has the appearance of a caterpillar. The eleven pairs of luminescent organs on their second thoracic segment through their ninth abdominal segment can glow yellowish-green, while the pair on their head can glow red; this is due to different luciferases in their bodies, as the reaction substrate, called luciferin, is the same.

The &quot;railroad worm&quot; name arises because these glowing spots along the body resemble the windows of train cars internally illuminated in the night. The light emissions are believed to be a warning signal to nocturnal predators of their unpalatability or a defense function as they can suddenly be turned on, spooking predators with a sudden flash. When handled, the larva may eject a possibly distasteful and corrosive reddish liquid.

The term &quot;railroad worm&quot; is also sometimes applied to the apple maggot.

<doc id="305151" wikidata="Q5016070" url="?curid=305151" title="Cacophony Society">
<text>The Cacophony Society is a US-based organization that consists of individuals &quot;united in the pursuit of experiences beyond the pale of mainstream society.&quot; In 1986, the organization was created by the surviving members of the defunct Suicide Club of San Francisco.

Cacophony events, which may be sponsored by any member, often involve wearing costumes, performing pranks in public places, and urban exploring. 

== Chapters ==

=== San Francisco Chapter ===
Formed in 1986, some members became organizers of the annual Burning Man event. The move came after Cacophony member Michael Mikel attended the event&#x27;s previous iteration, the unnamed Memorial Day beach party to raise and burn the Man on Baker Beach, in 1988 and publicized the 1989 event in the Cacophony Society newsletter. 

In 1990, Carrie Galbraith and Kevin Evans conceived of Zone Trip #4 and organized it with John Law and Michael Mikel. They publicized the event in the Society newsletter as &quot;A Bad Day at Black Rock&quot;. Larry Harvey and Jerry James, who had previously run the Baker Beach party, co-founded the Burning Man festival when they were invited to bring their effigy along for the new Labor Day weekend art festival after they had been blocked from burning it on the beach by law enforcement. 

The Society was also involved in such events as the Atomic Café, the Chinese New Year Treasure Hunt, the picnic on the Golden Gate Bridge, driving an earthquake-damaged car on the closed Embarcadero Freeway to commemorate the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Brides of March, Urban Iditarod, and the Sewer Walk. 

After a lull in activity in the San Francisco chapter in the late 1990s and the cessation of the chapter&#x27;s monthly newsletter, &quot;Rough Draft&quot;, a group of subscribers to the defunct society&#x27;s email discussion list became active under the Cacophony Society aegis. This resurgence followed a mock Pigeon Roast organized by a fictitious group called &quot;Bay Area Rotisserie Friends&quot; in San Francisco&#x27;s Union Square in 2000, proposed by Drunken Consumptive Panda.

In 2013, Kevin Evans, Carrie Galbraith and John Law co-authored &quot;Tales of the San Francisco Cacophony Society&quot;, a book published by Last Gasp.

In 2013, a digitized collection of the San Francisco chapter&#x27;s &quot;Rough Draft&quot; newsletters was uploaded to the Internet Archive.

=== Los Angeles Chapter ===
Originating in 1991, the Los Angeles chapter listed events in their monthly newsletter &quot;Tales from the Zone&quot;. After mailing out physical monthly newsletters for several years, they switched to an online newsletter format. The events produced by the Los Angeles branch often centered on public pranking with several historical events, including &quot;Cement Cuddles&quot; where they filled a dozen teddy bears with cement and put them on toy store shelves complete with bar-coded labels.

The Los Angeles group splintered in late 2000 when longtime leader, Al &quot;Reverend Al&quot; Ridenour, pranked the society itself and declared a &quot;bold new direction&quot; for the branch by allegedly joining an Orthodox Christian community out of guilt over the deaths of two young members who reportedly died in a drunken post-event car accident. However, one of the men eventually turned out to be completely fictitious and the other, Peter &quot;Mr. Outer Space&quot; Geiberger, was discovered to be alive. In Spring 2001, Ridenour stepped down as leader of the chapter. 
In 2005, Reverend Al resurfaced as Dr. A.P. Ridenour, leader of a safety consciousness organization, The Art of Bleeding, along with several members of the Los Angeles chapter.

In 2008, the Los Angeles chapter was revived by San Francisco members Heathervescent and Rev. Borfo with Michael Mikel&#x27;s blessing. They have since continued to sponsor events.

=== Seattle Chapter ===
In December 1993, the Seattle Chapter held a protest event called &quot;Uncan the Cranberries&quot; at a shopping mall, where Cacophony members asked the public to &quot;save the free-range cranberry&quot;. Another Cacophony member asked the &quot;adult children of parents&quot; to avoid &quot;dysfunction and substance abuse&quot; by staying home and avoiding family gatherings.

=== Portland Chapter ===
By the mid-1990s, the Cacophony Society had expanded to Portland, Oregon. In 1996, Portland Cacophony organized the first Santa Rampage outside of San Francisco. The arrival of the members dressed like Santa, who flew in by plane, was met by Portland police in riot gear, following a tip-off from the San Francisco Police Department. However, the activities resulted in only two arrests, which involved a gift wrapped in a Playboy centerfold being given to a recipient without verifying that they were over 18.

For several years, Portland Cacophony was responsible for the Disgruntled Postal Workers, a group of armed individuals in postal uniforms who occasionally delivered newspapers and other forms of &quot;mail&quot; at the annual Burning Man festival. Eventually, the Burning Man organizers banned their guns. The Black Rock City Post Office (BRCPO), which sends US postal mail from the Burning Man festival with a unique BRCPO postmark arranged with the US Postmaster, is still managed by PDX Cacophony associates.

One of the most widely known Cacophony members is novelist Chuck Palahniuk, who has mentioned his experiences with the Society in his writings, particularly in the book &quot;Fugitives and Refugees: A Walk in Portland, Oregon&quot;. Palahniuk used the Society as the inspiration for the fictional organization Project Mayhem in his novel &quot;Fight Club&quot;. Palahniuk himself was pranked by a group of members disguised as waiters at one of his book readings in San Francisco.

=== Other Chapters ===
Cacophony chapters are or have been active in about two dozen American cities and at least a half dozen other countries. Between 2003 and 2006, and in 2008, &quot;Sant&#x27; Arctica&quot; was held at McMurdo Station, Antarctica.

==Other events, affiliations==
Many activities have been inspired by the Society, such as Pee-wee Herman Day (commemorating Actor Paul Reubens&#x27; arrest in a pornographic theater). 

Flash mob activities have been influenced by the Society, as well as groups like Improv Everywhere. The Society also has links to the Church of the SubGenius and the annual Saint Stupid&#x27;s Day Parade held on April 1st in San Francisco. Urban explorers also have taken some inspiration from early Society events such as the Sewer Walks.

<doc id="305152" wikidata="Q130201" url="?curid=305152" title="Papaver rhoeas">
<text>Papaver rhoeas, with common names including common poppy, corn poppy, corn rose, field poppy, Flanders poppy, red poppy, and Odai, is an annual herbaceous species of flowering plant in the poppy family Papaveraceae. It is native to north Africa and temperate Eurasia and is introduced into temperate areas on all other continents except Antarctica.

It is regarded as an agricultural weed (hence the common names including &quot;corn&quot; and &quot;field&quot;). As the plant thrives in areas of disturbed soil, it was often abundant in agricultural fields before the advent of herbicides. Flushes of poppies may still appear in fields where herbicides are not used, as well as those in fallow. The corn poppy and its cultivars such as the Shirley poppy are widely grown in gardens, and are frequently found in packets of seed labelled &quot;wildflower mixes&quot;. Since World War I, it has been used in the Commonwealth as a symbol of remembrance for fallen soldiers because it commonly grew in fields disturbed by war.

==Description==
&quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot; is a variable, erect annual, forming a long-lived soil seed bank that can germinate when the soil is disturbed. In the Northern Hemisphere it generally flowers in late spring (between May and October in the UK) but if the weather is warm enough other flowers frequently appear at the beginning of autumn. It grows up to about in height. The stems hold single flowers, which are large and showy, across, with four petals that are vivid red, most commonly with a black spot at their base. The petals slightly overlap each other. The plant can produce up to 400 flowers in a warm season, that last only one day. The flower stem is usually covered with coarse hairs that are held at right angles to the surface, helping to distinguish it from &quot;P. dubium&quot; in which the hairs are more usually appressed (&quot;i.e.&quot; held close to the stem). The capsules are hairless, obovoid (egg-shaped), less than twice as tall as they are wide, with a stigma at least as wide as the capsule. Like many other species of &quot;Papaver&quot;, the plant exudes white to yellowish latex when the tissues are broken.

Not all corn poppies that are available commercially have red flowers. Selective breeding has resulted in cultivars in yellow, orange, pink, and white. The Shirley poppy is a well-known cultivar. A very pale speckled variety, derived from the Shirley, is also available.

A nearly black-flowering hybrid, known as &#x27;Evelina&#x27;, was bred in Italy in the late 1990s, with &quot;P. dubium&quot;, but does not appear to be available commercially.

=== Phytochemistry ===
&quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot; contains the alkaloid called rhoeadine, which is a mild sedative. Rhoeadic acid, papaveric acid and rhoeagenine are also found in this plant.

==Taxonomy==
It was formally described by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in his seminal publication &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753. &quot;Papaver&quot; is the Latin word for poppy and &quot;rhoeas&quot; means the corn poppy in Greek.

=== Natural history ===

Its origin is not known for certain. As with many such plants, the area of origin is often ascribed by Americans to Europe, and by northern Europeans to southern Europe. It is known to have been associated with agriculture in the Old World since early times and has had an old symbolism and association with agricultural fertility. It has most of the characteristics of a successful weed of agriculture. These include an annual lifecycle that fits into that of most cereals, a tolerance of simple weed control methods, the ability to flower and seed itself before the crop is harvested, and the ability to form a long-lived seed bank. The leaves and latex have an acrid taste and are mildly poisonous to grazing animals.

A sterile hybrid with &quot;P. dubium&quot; is known, &quot;P.&quot; × &quot;hungaricum&quot;, that is intermediate in all characteristics with &quot;P. rhoeas&quot;.

&quot;P. rhoeas&quot; topped the list in a UK study of meadow pollen production, on a per flower basis, with its rate of 13.3 ± 2.8 μl. The California poppy placed second with a rate of 8.3 ± 1.1 μl. The pollen production of &quot;P.rhoeas&quot;, on a per flower basis, was very high in comparison with the other plants tested, at almost triple the amount of the top-ranked perennial (a mallow). When sampled at the level of the entire capitulum, however, it was outranked by the ox-eye daisy, &quot;Leucanthemum vulgare&quot;, with its 15.9 ± 2 μl measurement. It tied with &quot;Cosmos bipinnatus&quot;. Neither poppy produced a significant quantity of nectar, making their role in meadow ecology specific to pollen-gathering/consuming insects. As poppies are not wind-pollinated, their pollen poses no allergy risk via inhalation.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is found within Africa, in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Madeira Islands, and the Canary Islands. Within temperate Asia, it is found in the Caucasus regions of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ciscaucasia.
In Western Asia, it is found in Afghanistan, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. Within tropical Asia, it is found in Pakistan and India. Within Europe, it is found in Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Ukraine, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, Denmark, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, France, Portugal, and Spain.

It grows in fields, beside roads, and on grasslands.
It is hardy to between USDA Zone 8 and Zone 10, or down to 10 °F (−12 °C).

== Uses ==
The commonly grown garden decorative Shirley poppy is a cultivar of this plant.

The black seeds are edible and can be eaten either on their own or as an ingredient in bread, though the majority of poppy seeds harvested for culinary use are from the related species &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;. In many Eastern European countries, poppy seeds are boiled in water or milk, and then ground together with honey or sugar to achieve a sweet, soft paste, often used generously in pastries. Oil made from the seed is highly regarded in France.

The petals contain a red dye which is used in some medicines and wines; also the dried petals are occasionally used to give colour to potpourris.

In traditional folk medicine, it was used for gout, aches, and pains. The petals were used to create a syrup that was fed to children to help them sleep.

== In culture ==
Due to the extent of ground disturbance in warfare during World War I, corn poppies bloomed between the trench lines and no man&#x27;s lands on the Western front. Poppies are a prominent feature of &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; by Canadian Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae, one of the most frequently quoted English-language poems composed during the First World War. During the 20th century, the wearing of a poppy at and before Remembrance Day (sometimes known informally as Poppy Day) each year became an established custom in English-speaking western countries. It is also used at some other dates in some countries, such as at appeals for Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand.

This poppy appears on a number of postage stamps, coins, banknotes, and national flags, including:

*Two hundred lei (Romanian banknote)
*Canadian twenty-dollar note (2012) and Canadian ten-dollar note (2001)

The common or corn poppy was voted the county flower of Essex and Norfolk in 2002 following a poll by the wild plant conservation charity Plantlife.

===China===
In China, &quot;P. rhoeas&quot; is known as &quot;yumeiren&quot; (虞美人, meaning &quot;Yu the Beauty&quot;), after Consort Yu, the concubine of the warlord Xiang Yu. In 202 BC, when they were besieged in the Battle of Gaixia by the force of Liu Bang (founder of the Han dynasty), Consort Yu committed suicide; according to folklore, poppies grew out of the ground where Consort Yu fell, and &quot;P. rhoeas&quot; thus became a symbol of loyalty unto death.

In 2010, &quot;P. rhoeas&quot; was at the centre of a diplomatic controversy between China and the United Kingdom; during an official visit to China, British Prime Minister David Cameron and his entourage rejected a demand from China to not wear the remembrance poppy, which the Chinese government had mistaken for the opium poppy, a plant that carries connotations of the Opium Wars in China.

===Persian literature===
In Persian literature, red poppies, especially red corn poppy flowers, are considered the flower of love. They are often called the eternal lover flower.
In classic and modern Persian poems, the poppy is a symbol of people who died for love (Persian: راه عشق).

Many poems interchange &quot;poppy&quot; and &quot;tulip&quot; (Persian: لاله).

&lt;poem&gt;[I] was asking the wind in the field of tulips during the sunrise: whose martyrs are these bloody shrouded?

[The wind] replied: Hafez, you and I are not capable of this secret, sing about red wine and sweet lips.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Urdu literature===

In Urdu literature, red poppies, or &quot;Gul-e-Lalah&quot;, are often a symbol of martyrdom, and sometimes of love.

<text>The Battle of Aachen was a battle of World War II, fought by American and German forces in and around Aachen, Germany, between 12 September and 21 October 1944. The city had been incorporated into the Siegfried Line, the main defensive network on Germany&#x27;s western border; the Allies had hoped to capture it quickly and advance into the industrialized Ruhr basin. Although most of Aachen&#x27;s civilian population was evacuated before the battle began, much of the city was destroyed and both sides suffered heavy losses.

It was one of the largest urban battles fought by U.S. forces in World War II, and is considered one of the toughest urban encounters in the entire war. As a result, Aachen became the first city on internationally recognized German soil to be captured by the Allies. Despite the battle ending with a German surrender, their tenacious defense significantly disrupted Allied plans for the advance into Germany.

==Background==
By September 1944, the Western Allies had reached Germany&#x27;s western border, which was protected by the extensive Siegfried Line. On 17 September, British, American, and Polish forces launched Operation Market Garden, an ambitious attempt to bypass the Siegfried Line by crossing the Lower Rhine River in the Netherlands. The failure of this operation, and an acute supply problem brought about by the long distances involved in the rapid drive through France, brought an end to the headlong Allied race toward Berlin. German casualties in France had been highField Marshal Walter Model estimated that his 74 divisions had the actual strength of just 25but the Western Allies&#x27; logistical problems gave the Germans a respite, which they used to begin rebuilding their strength. In September, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; high command&#x27;s reinforcement of the Siegfried Line brought total troop strength up to an estimated 230,000 soldiers, including 100,000 fresh personnel. At the start of the month, the Germans had had about 100 tanks in the West; by the end, they had roughly 500. As men and equipment continued to flow into the Siegfried Line they were able to establish an average defensive depth of .

Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, set their sights on the occupation of the Ruhr, Germany&#x27;s industrial heartland. General George S. Patton&#x27;s Third Army was given the task of occupying the French region of Lorraine, while General Courtney Hodges&#x27;s First Army was ordered to break through the front near Aachen. Hodges had initially hoped to bypass the city itself, believing it to be held only by a small garrison, which would presumably surrender once isolated.

The ancient, picturesque city of Aachen had little military value in itself, as it was not a major center of war production. Its population of around 165,000 had not been subject to heavy bombing by the Allies. It was, however, an important symbol to both the Nazi regime and the German people; not only was it the first German city threatened by an enemy during World War II, it was also the historic capital of Charlemagne, founder of the Holy Roman Empire. Historical propaganda produced under Nazi Germany had portrayed Charlemagne as the founder of Germany&#x27;s &quot;first&quot; empire and whose legacy the Nazis claimed; as such, it was of immense psychological value. The mindset of the city&#x27;s defenders was further altered by the different attitude the local population had toward them as they fought on home soil for the first time; one German officer commented, &quot;Suddenly we were no longer the Nazis, we were German soldiers.&quot;

Aachen and its sector of the front were protected by the Siegfried Line, consisting of several belts of inter-connected pillboxes, forts, and bunkers protected by extensive minefields, &quot;dragon&#x27;s teeth&quot; anti-tank obstacles, and barbed wire entanglements. In several areas, German defenses were over deep. Learning from their experiences on the Eastern Front, the Germans ran their main line of resistance down the center of towns located in the defensive wall, taking advantage of narrow streets to limit the mobility of enemy armored vehicles. Despite the low quality of many of the troops manning them, the fortifications protecting Aachen and the Ruhr were a formidable obstacle to the progress of American forces, who saw a breakthrough in this sector as crucial, as the terrain behind Aachen was generally flat, and therefore highly favorable to the motorized Allied armies.

Fighting around Aachen began as early as the second week of September, in a period known to the Germans as the &quot;First Battle of Aachen&quot;. At this time, the city was defended by the 116th Panzer Division, under the command of General Gerhard von Schwerin. The proximity of Allied forces had caused the majority of the city&#x27;s government officials to flee before the evacuation of its citizens was complete. (For this, Hitler had all Nazi officials who had fled stripped of rank and sent to the Eastern front as privates.) Instead of continuing the evacuation, von Schwerin opted to surrender the city to Allied forces; however, on 13 September, before he could deliver a letter of capitulation he had written, von Schwerin was ordered to launch a counterattack against American forces penetrating southwest of Aachen, which he did, using elements of his forces. The German general&#x27;s attempt to surrender the city would soon become irrelevant, as his letter was never delivered; instead, it fell into the hands of Adolf Hitler, who ordered the general&#x27;s immediate arrest. He was replaced by Colonel Gerhard Wilck. (Von Schwerin was ultimately only reprimanded, and later served on the Italian front.) The United States&#x27; VII Corps continued to probe German defenses, despite the resistance encountered on 12–13 September. Between 14 and 16 September the US 1st Infantry Division continued its advance in the face of strong defenses and repeated counterattacks, ultimately creating a half-moon arc around the city. This slow advance came to a halt in late September, due to the supply problem, and the diversion of existing stocks of fuel and ammunition for Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands.

===German defenders in Aachen===
The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; took advantage of the brief respite on the front by pulling the 1st, 2nd, and 12th SS Panzer Divisions, as well as the 9th and 116th Panzer Divisions, off the line. In October, responsibility for the Aachen sector&#x27;s defense was given to General Friedrich Köchling&#x27;s LXXXI Corps, which included the 183rd and 246th Volksgrenadier Divisions, as well as the 12th and 49th Infantry Divisions. These forces, along with the attached 506th Tank Battalion and 108th Tank Brigade, numbered roughly 20,000 men and 11 tanks. Köchling was also promised a reformed 116th Panzer Division and the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division, numbering a total of some 24,000 personnel. The 246th Volksgrenadier Division replaced the 116th Panzer Division in Aachen proper, the 183rd Volksgrenadier Division and 49th Infantry Division defended the northern approaches, and the 12th Infantry Division was positioned to the south. On 7 October, elements of the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler were released to reinforce the defense of Aachen.

Although reinforcements continued to arrive, LXXXI Corps&#x27; units suffered heavily; the 12th Infantry Division had lost half its combat strength between 16 and 23 September, and the 49th and 275th Infantry Divisions had had to be pulled off the line to recuperate. While German infantry divisions generally had a strength of 15,000–17,000 soldiers at the start of World War II, this had gradually been reduced to an official (table of organization) size of 12,500, and by November 1944, the average actual strength of a &quot;Heer&quot; division was 8,761 men. In an attempt to cope with the manpower shortages plaguing the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, the Volksgrenadier divisions were created in 1944. Their average total strength was just over 10,000 men per division. Although about of these were experienced veterans, half were fresh conscripts and convalescents, while the remainder were transferees from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. These divisions often received the newest small-arms, but were deficient in artillery and motorization, severely limiting their tactical usefulness. In the case of LXXXI Corps, the 183rd Volksgrenadier Division, though overstrength by 643 men, had only been activated in September, meaning that the division had not had time to train as a unit. The 246th Volksgrenadier Division was in a similar state, many of its personnel having received fewer than ten days of infantry training. All of these deficiencies of personnel were offset somewhat by the inherent strength of the well-planned, well-constructed fortifications surrounding Aachen.

===American forces===

The task of taking Aachen fell to General Charles H. Corlett&#x27;s XIX Corps&#x27; 30th Infantry Division (along with the attached 743rd Tank Battalion) and Joseph Collins&#x27; VII Corps&#x27; 1st Infantry Division. General Leland Hobbs&#x27; 30th Infantry Division would be assisted by the 2nd Armored Division, which would exploit the 30th Division&#x27;s penetration of the Siegfried Line, while their flanks were protected by the 29th Infantry Division. In the south, the 1st Infantry Division was supported by the 9th Infantry Division and the 3rd Armored Division. These divisions had used the brief respite in the fighting during the last two weeks of September to rest and refit, taking in a large number of replacements. By 1 October, over 70% of the men of General Clarence Huebner&#x27;s 1st Infantry Division were replacements, and the last two weeks of September were spent giving these men village-fighting and weapons training. The impending offensive&#x27;s plan called for both infantry divisions to avoid street fighting in Aachen; instead, the two divisions would link up and encircle the city, assigning a relatively small force to capture it while the bulk of US forces continued pushing east.

Although American units were usually able to replenish their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without having so much as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured that the majority of fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit&#x27;s replacements to become casualties within the first few days of combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.

These forces were supported by the Ninth Air Force, which had pin-pointed 75% of the pillboxes along the frontlines and planned an opening bombardment including 360 bombers and 72 fighters; fresh aircraft would be used for a second aerial wave, which included the use of napalm. With the Germans having few anti-aircraft batteries and severely limited support from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, Allied dominance of the sky over Aachen was near total.

==Battle==
On September 12, the American 1st Infantry Division penetrated the lightly held defenses on Aachen’s south side. For six days prior to the beginning of the American offensive, Allied heavy artillery targeted German defenses around Aachen. Although the heavy bombardment forced the German LXXXI Corps to halt all daylight personnel and supply movements, it had little effect on the pillboxes and strongpoints. The opening aerial bombardment on 2 October also caused little damage to German defensive positions; the 450 aircraft which took part in the first wave failed to register a single direct hit on any German pillbox. Their targets had been largely obscured by thick smoke from the Allied artillery barrage. As the aircraft finished their assault, the artillery resumed bombarding the front lines, firing 18,696 shells from 372 gun tubes within a couple of hours. It was the first time since the 1939 Saar Offensive that Allied troops stepped into pre-1938 German territory.

===Advance from the north: 2–8 October===
The 30th Infantry Division began its advance on 2 October, using divisional heavy artillery to target German pillboxes; even then it took, on average, thirty minutes to capture a single pillbox. The Americans found that if they failed to immediately press on to the next pillbox, the Germans were sure to counterattack. Heavy resistance had not been expected, and one company lost 87 combatants in an hour; another lost 93 out of 120 soldiers to a German artillery strike. The attackers were slowly able to cross the Wurm River and engage German pillboxes with flamethrowers and explosive charges. By the afternoon of 2 October, elements of the 30th Infantry Division had breached German defenses and reached the town of Palenberg. Here, GIs advanced house-to-house and fought a number of gruesome hand grenade duels. (Private Harold G. Kiner would be awarded the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on a German grenade near Palenberg, thus saving the lives of two fellow soldiers.) Fighting in the town of Rimburg was equally terrible; American armor had not been able to get across the Wurm River, and therefore could not provide fire support to infantrymen who were attempting to storm a medieval castle being used as a fort by the Germans. The 30th Infantry Division subdued roughly 50 German pillboxes on the first day of the advance, often having to envelop the structure and attack from the rear. The division&#x27;s effort was aided by the 29th Infantry Division&#x27;s diversionary attacks on their flank, leading the Germans to believe that that was the Americans&#x27; main attack. On the night of 2 October, the German 902nd Assault Gun Battalion was ordered to launch a counterattack against the 30th Infantry Division, but Allied artillery delayed the start of the raid, and ultimately the attempt failed.

Although American armor became available to support the advance on 3 October, the attacking forces were brought to an abrupt halt after a number of German counterattacks. The town of Rimburg was taken on the second day of the offensive, but fighting through German defenses remained slow as M4 Sherman tanks and M12 Gun Motor Carriage artillery guns were brought up to blast pillboxes at point blank range. Fighting had also begun to develop for the town of Übach, where American tanks rushed in to take the town, only to be pinned down by German artillery. Fierce counterattacks followed, with American artillery fire narrowly preventing the Germans from retaking it. By the end of the day, the forcing of the Wurm River and the creation of a bridgehead had cost the 30th Infantry Division around 300 dead and wounded.

German forces continued their counterattacks on Übach, suffering heavy casualties to American artillery and infantry fire. Although the inability to retake Übach persuaded German commanders that they had insufficient forces to properly defend the approaches to Aachen, the counterattacks did tie down American troops which could have otherwise continued the advance. On 4 October, the Allied advance was limited, with only the towns of Hoverdor and Beggendorf taken, the Americans having lost roughly 1,800 soldiers in the past three days of combat. Better progress was made on 5 October, as the 119th Regiment of the 30th Infantry Division captured Merkstein-Herbach. The following day the Germans launched another counterattack against Übach, again failing to dislodge the Americans. German armor was unable to cope with the overwhelming numerical superiority of the American tanks, and as a last-ditch effort to halt the advance the Germans began concentrated attacks on American positions with what artillery and aircraft they could muster. They found themselves severely hamstrung by lack of reserves, although General Koechling was able to deploy a Tiger detachment to the town of Alsdorf in an attempt to plug the American penetration of Aachen&#x27;s northern defenses.

A counterattack developed on 8 October, composed of an infantry regiment, the 1st Assault Battalion, a battle group of the 108th Panzer Brigade, and some 40 armored fighting vehicles scavenged from available units. Although hindered by American artillery, the left wing of the attack managed to cut off an American platoon, while the right wing reached a road junction north of the town of Alsdorf. A platoon of Shermans supporting an attack on the town of Mariadorf suddenly found themselves being attacked from the rear, and were able to repel the Germans only after heavy fighting. Two German Sturmgeschütz IV self-propelled assault guns and a squad of infantry entered Alsdorf, where they were heavily counterattacked. Although the two lumbering vehicles somehow eluded American tanks, they were finally engaged by American infantry and forced back to their starting point. With casualties mounting and the Americans drawing closer, the German high command transferred the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division to Aachen, followed by the I SS Panzer Corps, which included the 116th Panzer Division and SS Heavy Panzer Battalion 101, an element of the 1st SS Panzer Division.

===Advance from the south: 8–11 October===
In the south, the 1st Infantry Division began its offensive on 8 October, aiming to capture the town of Verlautenheide and Hill 231 (dubbed &quot;Crucifix Hill&quot;) near the town of Ravelsberg. Their attack was preceded by a massive artillery barrage, which helped them seize their objectives quickly. On Crucifix Hill, Captain Bobbie E. Brown, commander of C Company, 18th Infantry, personally silenced three pillboxes with pole charges and, despite being wounded, continued to lead his men into the attack, earning the Medal of Honor. By 10 October, the 1st Infantry Division was at its designated position for link-up with the 30th Infantry Division. This success was met with a German counterattack toward Hill 231, which was the scene of an intense firefight; the battle ended with the Germans leaving over 40 dead and 35 prisoners. Despite repeated German counterattacks slowing its advance, the 1st Infantry Division was able to capture the high ground surrounding the city.

On 10 October, General Huebner delivered an ultimatum to German forces in Aachen, threatening to bomb the city into submission if the garrison did not surrender. The German commander categorically refused. In response, American artillery began to pound the city on 11 October, firing an estimated 5,000 shells, or over of explosives; it was also subjected to intense bombardment by American aircraft.

===Link up: 11–16 October===

American casualties were climbing, both from frequent German counterattacks and the cost of storming pillboxes. The Germans had spent the night of 10 October turning cellars of houses in the town of Bardenberg into fortified pillboxes; American attackers were forced to withdraw and instead shell the town into submission. On 12 October, the Germans launched a major counterattack against the American 30th Infantry Division. It was disrupted by heavy artillery fire and well-placed anti-tank defenses. At the village of Birk, a three-hour fight broke out between German tanks and a single American Sherman; the Sherman managed to knock out an enemy Panzer IV and force another one to withdraw, but was soon attacked by others. This lone tank was eventually joined by elements of the 2nd Armored Division, and the Germans were driven from the town. The 30th Infantry Division soon found itself in defensive positions all along its front; nevertheless, it was ordered to continue pushing south for its intended link-up with the 1st Infantry Division. To accomplish this, two infantry battalions from the 29th Infantry Division were attached to the hard-pressed 30th.

The same day (12 October), to the south, two German infantry regiments attempted to retake Crucifix Hill from GIs of the 1st Infantry Division. In fierce fighting, the Germans temporarily took control of the hill but were dislodged by the end of the day, with both regiments virtually destroyed. From 11 to 13 October, Allied aircraft bombarded Aachen, selecting targets closest to American lines; on 14 October, the 26th Infantry Regiment was ordered to clear an industrial zone on the edge of Aachen in preparation for the attack on the city itself. On 15 October, in an effort to widen the gap between the two American pincers, the Germans again counterattacked the 1st Infantry Division; although a number of heavy tanks managed to break through American lines, the bulk of the German forces were destroyed by artillery and air support. On the next day, the Germans attempted to mount local counterattacks with the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division, but, after sustaining heavy losses, were forced to suspend further offensive action.

The 30th Infantry Division, with elements of the 29th Infantry and 2nd Armored divisions, continued its push southwards between 13 and 16 October, in the sector of the village of Würselen; however, even with heavy air support, they were unsuccessful in breaking through German defenses and linking up with allied forces to the south. The Germans took advantage of the narrow front to pound advancing attackers with artillery, and progress remained slow as German tanks used houses as bunkers to surprise and overwhelm American foot soldiers. General Hobbs, commander of the 30th Infantry Division, then attempted to outflank the German defenses by attacking along another sector with two infantry battalions. The attack was a success, allowing the 30th and 1st Infantry Divisions to link up on 16 October. The fighting had so far cost the American XIX Corps over 400 dead and 2,000 wounded, with 72% of those from the 30th Infantry Division. The Germans had not fared any better, as up to 14 October around 630 of their soldiers had been killed and 4,400 wounded; another 600 were lost in the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division&#x27;s counterattack on the US 1st Infantry Division on 16 October.

===Fight for the city: 13–21 October===


Needing most of its manpower to stave off German counterattacks and secure the area around Aachen, the 1st Infantry Division was able to earmark only a single regiment for the job of taking the city. The task fell to the 26th Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel John F. R. Seitz, which had only two of its three battalions on hand. Armed with machine guns and flamethrowers, the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Battalions would at first be aided only by a few tanks and a single howitzer. The city was defended by roughly 5,000 German troops, including converted navy, air force and city police personnel. For the most part, these soldiers were inexperienced and untrained, and were only supported by a handful of tanks and assault guns. However, Aachen&#x27;s defenders could make use of the maze of streets which occupied its historical center.

The 26th Infantry&#x27;s initial attack on 13 October provided important insight on the nature of the fighting; American infantry had been ambushed by German defenders using sewers and cellars, forcing the advancing American infantry to clear each opening before continuing down streets, while Sherman tanks found it impossible to maneuver to suppress enemy fire. German civilians were cleared as the 26th Infantry advanced; no Germans were allowed to remain in the Americans&#x27; rear. Success in Aachen was measured by the number of houses captured, as the advance proved to be sluggish; in order to cope with the thick walls of the older buildings in the city, the 26th Infantry Regiment used its howitzer at point blank range to destroy German fortifications. The howitzer created passageways that allowed infantrymen to advance from building to building without having to enter the city&#x27;s streets, where they could be pinned down by enemy fire. Sherman tanks were ambushed, as they entered intersections, by concealed German anti-tank guns. Soon thereafter, American tanks and other armored vehicles would advance cautiously, often shooting buildings ahead of the accompanying infantry to clear them of possible defenders. Pinned on the surface by Allied aircraft, German infantrymen would use sewers to deploy behind American formations to attack them from the rear. German resistance was fierce, as they launched small counterattacks and used armor to halt American movements.

Additional American armor was needed to break the German resistance. General Huebner requested a tank battalion which was detached from the 3rd Armored Division. The 3rd Battalion, 33rd Armored Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Samuel M Hogan, was attached to the 1st Infantry Division. Their mission was to assault in the north, protecting the flank of the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Infantry while seizing the heights that dominated the central part of Aachen overlooking the German command posts located at the Hotel Quellenhof. Once the Lousberg heights were captured, Task Force Hogan would proceed down the reverse slope in order to cut off the Aachen-Laurensberg highway, thus preventing a German counterattack from the Northeast.

On 18 October, the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment prepared to assault the Hotel Quellenhof, which was one of the last areas of resistance in the city. American tanks and other guns were firing on the hotel, which was the city&#x27;s defense headquarters, at point blank range. That night, 300 soldiers of the 1st SS Battalion were able to reinforce the hotel and defeat several attacks on the building. A furious German counterattack managed to overrun a number of American infantry positions outside of the hotel, and temporarily released pressure on the Quellenhof before being beaten off by concerted American mortar fire.

Two events then aided the final advance. First, to lessen frontline infantry casualties, it was decided to barrage remaining German strongpoints with 155 mm guns. Secondly, to assist the 1st Infantry Division, a battalion of the 110th Infantry Regiment, US 28th Infantry Division, had been moved up from the V Corps sector on 18 October to close a gap between forward 26th Infantry Regiment elements within the city. The defensive mission of this new battalion was changed on 19–20 October to closely support the urban assault, participating as the depleted regiment&#x27;s missing third battalion. On 21 October, soldiers of the 26th Infantry Regiment, supported by the reinforced battalion of the 110th Infantry Regiment finally conquered central Aachen; that day also marked the surrender of the last German garrison, in the Hotel Quellenhof, ending the battle for the city.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Aachen had cost both the Americans and Germans dearly; the former suffered over 7,000 casualties, while the latter lost over 5,000 casualties and 5,600 taken prisoner. Since 2 October 1944, the 30th Infantry Division suffered roughly 3,000 men killed and wounded, while the 1st Infantry Division took at least 1,350 casualties (150 killed and 1,200 wounded). The Germans lost another 5,100 casualties during the fighting in Aachen itself, including 3,473 prisoners. In the process of the battle, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; lost two complete divisions and had another eight severely depleted, including three fresh infantry divisions and a single refitted armored division; this was largely attributed to how they fought, as although an equivalent of 20 infantry battalions had been used during various counterattacks against the 30th Infantry Division alone, on average each separate attack only involved two infantry regiments. During the conflict, the Germans also developed a respect for the fighting ability of American forces, noting their capability to fire indiscriminately with overwhelming amounts of artillery fire support and armored forces. Both the 30th Infantry and 1st Infantry divisions received distinguished unit citations for their actions at Aachen.

However, German resistance in Aachen upset Allied plans to continue their eastward advance. Following the end of fighting in Aachen, the Western Allies&#x27; First Army was tasked with the capture of a series of dams behind the Hürtgen Forest, which could be used by the Germans to flood the valleys which opened the road to Berlin. This would lead to the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, which was to prove more difficult than the Battle of Aachen.

Franz Oppenhoff was appointed Mayor of Aachen by the Allies on 31 October, but after his identity was leaked, he was assassinated on Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s orders in &quot;Unternehmen Karneval&quot; (Operation Carnival) on 25 March 1945.

<doc id="305157" wikidata="Q1789035" url="?curid=305157" title="River Sheaf">
<text>The River Sheaf in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, flows northwards, past Dore, through Abbeydale and north of Heeley. It then passes into a culvert, through which it flows under the centre of Sheffield before joining the River Don. This lower section of the River Sheaf, together with the Don between the Blonk Street and Lady&#x27;s Bridges, formed two sides of the boundary of Sheffield Castle.

The main tributaries of the Sheaf are the Porter Brook, which joins it beneath Sheffield Midland station, and the Meers Brook. The river has been polluted upstream through centuries of industrial activity, including iron and steel working, and is only slowly recovering. The river used to provide the power for metal works such as the Grade I-listed Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet.

A River Sheaf Walk has been developed which follows the river from Granville Square out to Millhouses Park and beyond to the Peak District.

==Name==
Until the 17th century the name &quot;Sheaf&quot; was written as &quot;Scheth&quot; or &quot;Sheath&quot;. Sidney Oldall Addy equates the origins of this word with the Old English &quot;shed&quot; (as in &quot;water-shed&quot;) or &quot;sheth&quot;, which mean to divide, or separate. Historically, the Sheaf—along with its tributaries the Meers Brook and the Limb Brook—formed part of the border separating the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria; it remained on the border between Yorkshire and Derbyshire into the 20th century. The city of Sheffield derives its name from the Sheaf.

==Course==

The waters which form the River Sheaf rise as a series of streams on a ridge of gritstone between to the south west of the main city centre. The Blacka Dike, Needhams Dike and Redcar Brook combine to form Old Hay Brook, while Totley Brook is joined by Rodmoor Brook, and itself joins Old Hay Brook between Totley and Dore, after which the combined flow forms the Sheaf. Immediately below the junction, the river is crossed by the Hope Valley railway line, which then joins the Midland Main Line, and both cross back over to reach Dore &amp; Totley railway station, which was built on the site of Walk Mill in 1872. The river shares its valley with the railway, and there are a further five crossings before both reach Sheffield station.

From the junction of the Redcar Brook and the Old Hay Brook to the city centre, the river descends by around , and this fall has resulted in it being harnessed to provide water power for a number of industries from at least the 16th century.

The river valley is broad, cutting through the underlying coal measures with its sandstones and clays, and the location of harder rock has been a major factor in where weirs and dams (a local word for the ponds used to hold water rather than the structure that creates the pond) have been located. There are some 28 sites which have well-documented and long standing mills associated with them, and a further seven were located on some of the smaller tributaries, or were more transitory in nature. The Sheaf supplied a greater variety of industry than the other Sheffield rivers, partly because of its close proximity to Derbyshire, with its mineral reserves of lead. The lead ore was brought to the area around Dore, Totley and Norton, which was then in Derbyshire. There were at least ten mills where the ore was smelted in ore hearths, which used kiln-dried wood as the heat producing agent, and water-powered bellows to produce the temperatures required. As well as the lead smelting mills, there were a variety of corn and paper mills along the river, some of which were adapted in the 18th century to service the metal trades as they grew and expanded.

Walk Mill was one of the earliest known mills on the Sheaf, having been built around 1280 by the Canons of Beauchief Abbey as a fulling mill. After the abbey was dissolved in the reign of Henry VIII, it was used as a cutlers wheel. By 1746, John Tyzack was using it for grinding scythes, in 1797 Thomas Biggin was making knives for cutting hay and straw, and it was being used as a sickle mill in 1805. After a brief spell as a paper mill around 1826, it was occupied by Thomas Tyzack and Sons, who made saws. The site was sold to the Midland Railway by the Duke of Devonshire in 1871 to enable the construction of Dore and Totley station, and the last mill buildings were taken down in 1890.

Below Walk Mill, the Limb Brook flows in from the west. Whirlow Wheel was situated on the brook, and was used for milling corn between about 1586 until 1803, when a grinding wheel was added. With the building decaying, the site was sold to Sheffield Corporation in 1935. The roof of the building collapsed in 2006, but although there were calls to demolish it, the Friends of Whirlow Wheel campaigned for it to be retained until a use could be found for the site.

Abbeydale Works is located just below the Limb Brook and was powered by two water wheels. In 1855, these were supplemented by a steam engine, but the site declined after 1900. It was given to Sheffield Corporation in 1935 as an industrial museum, and only an active campaign by members of a local history group prevented its demolition. Restoration eventually began in 1964, and in 1970 it was opened as a museum, known as Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet. The Abbey Brook then joins the river from the east, below which the river is bordered by Millhouses Park. In order to reduce flooding and pollution of the river when the sewerage system is overloaded by heavy rainfall, Yorkshire Water excavated the park in 2004/5 to construct a tank capable of holding of storm water. The decision to build a tank rather than a vertical shaft was made after test boreholes found hard rock and high groundwater pressure in the area. The project cost £7.5 million, and included three more conventional shafts further down the river, which provide an additional of storage.

Little London wheel was used for the cutlery trade from the earliest known records in 1720. By 1814 it was described as a grinding and plating forge, and later was used for the production of scythes. When the railway was constructed, it crossed part of the dam, which was reduced in size by one eighth. By 1912, the water wheels had been modernised and there were two tilt hammers in operation. The owners moved their scythe production from Abbeydale Works to Little London on 1935, and the tilt hammers continued to be water-powered until the mid-1950s. Some of the equipment was dismantled in the 1970s and taken to Beamish Museum to be restored.

The next tributary is the Meers Brook, culverted for its last section under the suburban district of Meersbrook. Just below the junction is Heeley Station, built on the site of Heeley Wheel. The mill was demolished and the river was diverted by the railway company. Other sections of the river were also re-aligned in the 1860s to make way for the railway, and the weir at the site of Cooper Wheel, which can be seen from Havelock bridge, was probably built by the Midland Railway, as its orientation changed around that time.

From Granville Square to the Don, the river is almost entirely in culverts. The Midland Railway bought the water rights to allow them to build their station over the river. The site of Pond Tilt is now occupied by the station forecourt, and the goods yard covered its dam. The owners of Pond Forge vacated their site soon after the station was built, but attempted to get compensation for loss of water power as a result of the work.

At Granville Square, a large screen prevents debris from entering the culverts. Serious flooding in 1990 led to the construction of the first screen, and it was then refurbished in 2010, so that it could be continuously monitored by the Environment Agency. The Sheaf Screen was replaced by a larger, automated version in 2020.

The river continues below ground to the edge of the station, where it is joined underground by the Porter Brook, which emerges from its own culvert to flow beside the station car park before passing under the station from the west. The two rivers meet under platform 5a, currently under a wooden access cover but the Sheaf &amp; Porter Rivers Trust intend to replace this with a lightwell and information signs.

The river surfaces briefly by Pond Hill, before passing under the Ponds Forge district. It flows through a series of huge tunnels. A decaying concrete section of culvert follows until the Sheaf joins the Don under Castlegate bridge, opposite Blonk Street bridge, named after Benjamin Blonk, who was the tenant of Castle Orchards Wheel from the 1750s to the 1770s.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Sheaf was as follows in 2019:

The river is only rated moderate for ecological status due to the fact that the channel has been heavily modified by human activity. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

== Planned flood defence scheme ==
In September 2014 Sheffield City Council announced plans for flood defences on the River Sheaf and its tributaries costing £12 million.

==Points of interest==




==Sheaf &amp; Porter Rivers Trust==

In early 2019, the Sheaf &amp; Porter Rivers Trust was set up to encourage the regeneration and improvement of the River Sheaf &amp; Porter Brook.
Aims and Objectives of the Organisation

# Deculverting – the first priority is likely seizing the immediate opportunity at the Castle Market site where a  100-metre section of culvert is in an advanced state of decay and requires repair or removal.  Other possible opportunities may arise from the master planning of the lower Sheaf Valley around the accommodation of High Speed Rail 2 at Midland Station – for instance the section of culverted river which runs between Ponds Forge leisure centre and Sheaf Street
# Daylighting – whilst removal of the culverts under the railway tracks of Midland Station is probably unrealistic the potential of sinking light‐pipes into the dark tunnels to allow fish and animal passage could be considered as part of the environmental mitigation of the scheme c) Improved public access to existing open channel sections and newly deculverted ones including access for fishing, kayaking and stewardship e.g. Pond Hill, Sheaf Gardens, Cutlers Walk, the Primrose etc.
# Marking, celebrating the concealed course of the river where it remains hidden for now, using public art, trails etc. and guided visits using trained guides
# Interpretation of the river&#x27;s history, wildlife and environmental functions and engagement with its neighbouring communities
# Promotion of good practice by riparian owners
# More sustainable urban drainage in the Sheaf corridor following the example of Grey to Green

==River Sheaf Walk==

Although some key gaps remain missing, the River Sheaf Walk is fully signposted and contains 10 &#x27;Sheaf Wheels&#x27;.

River Sheaf Walk link


== Future ==
Sheffield City Council, the Environment Agency and Sheaf &amp; Porter Rivers Trust are currently working on a vision for the former Castle Market site. This involves removing the structurally decaying concrete culvert at the end of the River Sheaf, daylighting the section and replacing it with a new city centre park. The Sheaf &amp; Porter Rivers Trust are also campaigning for improvements to the River Sheaf Walk and Cycleway. This follows the course of the river for much of its length, but there are some significant gaps, and the Trust is working to ensure that the routes for the missing links are protected in the planning process.

<doc id="305160" wikidata="Q248745" url="?curid=305160" title="Rainbow Six (novel)">
<text>Rainbow Six is a techno-thriller novel written by Tom Clancy and released on August 3, 1998. It is the second book to primarily focus on John Clark, one of the recurring characters in the &quot;Ryanverse&quot;, after &quot;Without Remorse&quot; (1993); it also features his son-in-law, Domingo &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; follows &quot;Rainbow&quot;, a secret international counterterrorist organization headed by Clark (codenamed &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;), and the complex apocalyptic conspiracy they unravel after handling multiple seemingly random terrorist attacks.

The novel debuted at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action scenes and suspense but criticized the writing of some characters and its unrealistic plot. It also received some backlash from the environmental movement for its negative depiction of radical environmentalism. The novel&#x27;s sequel, &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot;, was released in 2000.

&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; was adapted into a video game, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot;, which was developed by Red Storm Entertainment in tandem with the novel and released later that August to critical and commercial success, spawning a highly successful series of video games currently owned by Ubisoft. A film adaptation, set to be the sequel to the 2021 film adaptation of &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, was announced in 2017 and was confirmed to be directed by Chad Stahelski in 2023, with an unannounced release date.

==Plot==
Formerly state-sponsored terrorist groups go rogue after the end of the Cold War, while international terrorism in general begins to rise. To combat this, CIA operative John Clark forms a top-secret international counterterrorist organization known as Rainbow. Based in Hereford, England, Rainbow consists of two operational squad-sized teams of elite special forces soldiers from NATO countries, supplemented by intelligence and technology experts from the FBI, MI6, and Mossad. Clark serves as Rainbow&#x27;s commanding officer (callsign &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;), SAS officer Alistair Stanley serves as their second-in-command, and Clark&#x27;s son-in-law Domingo Chavez leads Team-2.

In their first deployment, Team-2 rescues hostages during a bank robbery in Bern, Switzerland. Several weeks later, they are deployed to Austria, where German left-wing terrorists have taken over the schloss of a wealthy Austrian businessman to obtain (nonexistent) &quot;special access codes&quot; to the international trading markets. They are later deployed to the Worldpark amusement park in Spain, where terrorists, including Basque revolutionaries, have taken a group of children hostage, killing one to demonstrate their ruthless determination. They demand that various prisoners, including Carlos the Jackal, be released. Team-2 eliminates all the terrorists without losing any more hostages.
Clark and his colleagues become suspicious about three terrorist attacks occurring within a few weeks. Unbeknownst to them, the attacks are part of an intricate plan to wipe out nearly all of humanity, codenamed &quot;the Project&quot;. Dr. John Brightling, a staunch radical environmentalist who heads a biotechnology firm called the Horizon Corporation, ordered the attacks through ex-KGB officer Dmitriy Popov to raise concerns of terrorism, allowing co-conspirator Bill Henriksen&#x27;s security firm to land a key contract for the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. Henriksen would then ensure the release of &quot;Shiva&quot;—a manmade Ebola biological agent more deadly than the one that spread a year prior, developed by Horizon and tested on kidnapped human test subjects—through the fog-cooling system of Stadium Australia, infecting everyone present, who would spread Shiva when they return to their home countries. The resulting pandemic would kill countless people, during which Horizon would distribute a &quot;vaccine&quot;—actually a slow-acting version of Shiva—ensuring the deaths of the rest of the world&#x27;s population. Brightling&#x27;s &quot;chosen few&quot;, having been innoculated with the real vaccine, would then inherit the emptied world, justifying their genocidal actions as &quot;saving the world&quot; from environmentally destructive humanity.

Popov discovers the existence of Rainbow when he reviews videos of the &quot;police tactical teams&quot; (actually Rainbow in disguise) that thwarted his attacks, and brings it to Brightling&#x27;s attention. Brightling and Henriksen order Popov to orchestrate an attack on Rainbow to prevent them from being deployed to the Sydney Olympics. Popov persuades a Provisional Irish Republican Army splinter group to seize a hospital near Rainbow&#x27;s base and capture Clark&#x27;s wife Sandra and Chavez&#x27;s pregnant wife Patricia, who work there as a nurse and a doctor, respectively. When Rainbow arrives, militants hiding in trucks ambush them, killing two Team-1 troopers and injuring several others, including Stanley. Despite sustaining their first-ever losses, Rainbow manages to retake the hospital without further casualties, and kill or capture the militants. From interrogation of the survivors, Clark and Chavez learn of Popov&#x27;s involvement, while Brightling evacuates Popov to Horizon&#x27;s OLYMPUS facility in Kansas. Hours after the attack is thwarted, Patricia delivers Chavez&#x27;s son.

However, at OLYMPUS, one of the personnel stationed there inadvertently tells Popov of the Project&#x27;s details. Popov, who was not aware of the genocidal plan, is appalled by what he had unknowingly assisted, and kills him, escapes, and contacts Clark to inform him of Horizon&#x27;s plan. Popov&#x27;s warning comes just in time for Chavez and Team-2, who were deployed to the Olympics to evaluate the security measures, to thwart Shiva&#x27;s release at the last minute. 
Their plans in shambles, Brightling orders all incriminating material and files destroyed, and he and all Project members who know the full plan flee to a smaller Horizon base in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. Clark personally leads both Rainbow teams to the base. Brightling sends some of his armed but mostly untrained men out to ambush them, but they are easily killed. Brightling surrenders, confident his lawyers can get him off since there is no real evidence against him and his people. However, Clark orders the survivors to strip naked, has their clothes confiscated and facilities demolished, and leaves them to fend for themselves in the middle of the Amazon jungle, taunting them to &quot;reconnect with nature&quot;.

Six months later, Chavez reads a news article about Popov (who was not prosecuted, instead being pardoned for all involvement due to his knowledge) discovering a rich gold deposit on a Project member&#x27;s former property he had purchased, and Horizon&#x27;s revolutionary medical breakthroughs under new management. Chavez asks if the Project members survived; Clark informs him that no human activity has been detected in the area since. Chavez gives the killers no further thought, continuing to fight with Rainbow and raising his son. Clark muses that while humanity does what it can to protect the natural environment, nature does not distinguish between friends and enemies; he surmises that humanity is its own worst enemy.

==Themes==
&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; explores the issue of radical environmentalism. According to Marc Cerasini&#x27;s essay on the novel, the philosophy of the antagonists are considered as an extreme form of naturalism, based on Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s view that society&#x27;s functions corrupt mankind and that &quot;a natural or primitive state is actually morally superior to civilization&quot;. The novel shares elements found in James Bond movies: a biological weapon being used to end or rather cull the human race, mad scientists plotting world domination, and high-tech secret bases hidden from civilization. Clancy makes the plot relevant and morally ambiguous by incorporating motivations similar to those of real-life radical ecocentric environmentalists and deep ecologists, such as Pentti Linkola and Paul R. Ehrlich, rather than blanket hunger for power and brash misanthropic resentment. In several regards, critics have noted similarities in the population control regard to the later-released &quot;&quot; and Dan Brown&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, as well as those of Thanos in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

== Development ==
The concept of &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; was conceived from a discussion between Clancy and Doug Littlejohns, a former Royal Navy submarine commander and CEO of Red Storm Entertainment, a video game development company co-founded by Clancy in 1996. Their discussion occurred during a Red Storm company outing in Colonial Williamsburg, when Littlejohns suggested a strategy shooter game based on the FBI Hostage Rescue Team. When Clancy mentioned that he was writing a novel about a hostage rescue team, their conversation led to Littlejohns noting the protracted diplomatic delays in authorizing a foreign counterterrorist unit&#x27;s deployment overseas, and he suggested the concept of a permanent counterterrorist unit that already had authorization to deploy internationally. The name &quot;Rainbow&quot; came from the term &quot;Rainbow nation&quot;, a term coined by Desmond Tutu to describe post-apartheid South Africa under Nelson Mandela&#x27;s presidency. &quot;Six&quot; came from the American rank code for captain (O-6); though Clark would more accurately be described as a major general (O-8) in the novel, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; read better than &quot;Rainbow Eight&quot;. The strategy shooter game Littlejohns suggested was eventually developed into &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot;.

==Reception==
The book received mixed reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the novel&#x27;s &quot;sprawling, Bondesque plot&quot; as well as its action scenes that are &quot;vivid and cinematic—and notably lacking in the clichés and B-movie tone of his dialogue&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly &quot; also hailed the scenes as &quot;immensely suspenseful, breathtaking combos of expertly detailed combat and primal emotion&quot;.

Criticism focused on flat characters and the implausibility of the plot. A review from &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; stated: &quot;Clancy may have crossed the line into the realm of the unbelievable...I suspect even some of his most rabid fans will shake their heads at parts of this novel.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also noted that &quot;some of [Clancy&#x27;s] secondary characters have a flat, dime-novel feel&quot;. Canadian environmentalist Paul Watson condemned the book as &quot;a vicious defamation of the Environmentalist Movement, embodying, amplifying and packaging all the worst stereotypes and prejudices.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===Video game===

&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; was released on August 21, 1998, about two weeks after the release of the novel. It was developed alongside the novel and bases its plot on an early manuscript of the story. The game was developed by Red Storm Entertainment (which was co-founded by Clancy in 1996) based on their preexisting concept of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team in an international setting. &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; was a commercial success for Red Storm and spawned a number of sequels, now developed by Ubisoft. It revolutionized the first-person shooter genre by forcing the player to think tactically and realistically in every mission, unlike the arcade-style shooters of the time.

===Film adaptation===
The film rights to the novel were brought to Paramount Pictures by Michael Ovitz through his Artists Management Group in March 1999, with writer Jonathan Hensleigh in talks to pen the screenplay adaptation, and Ovitz attached as producer. Other screenwriters including Michael Schiffer, Bill Wisher, Art Monterastelli, Frank Cappello, and John Enbom had all worked on the script at various stages. Directors such as John Woo and Zack Snyder had previously been attached to direct.

In July 2017, Paramount Pictures announced plans to make a film adaptation of the novel with Akiva Goldsman as producer, and a new draft penned by Josh Appelbaum &amp; André Nemec. Ryan Reynolds was reported to be in early talks to play John Clark. In September 2018, Michael B. Jordan was announced to be playing John Clark in a two-part film series, with &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; as the intended sequel to &quot;Without Remorse&quot;. In January 2023, the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; film was confirmed to be directed by Chad Stahelski, with Michael B. Jordan reprising his role as Clark., and writers Daniel Fajemisin-Duncan and Marlon Smith tapped to write the screenplay.

<text>The Reinheitsgebot (; ) is a series of regulations limiting the ingredients in beer in Germany and the states of the former Holy Roman Empire. The best known version of the law was adopted in Bavaria in 1516 (by William IV), but similar regulations predate the Bavarian order, and modern regulations also significantly differ from the 1516 Bavarian version. Although today the Reinheitsgebot is mentioned in various texts about the history of beer, historically it was only applied in the duchy, electorate, then Kingdom of Bavaria and from 1906 in Germany as a whole, and it had little or no effect in other countries or regions.

==1516 Bavarian law==
The most influential predecessor of the modern &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; was a law first adopted in the Duchy of Bavaria-Munich in 1487. After Bavaria was reunited, the Munich law was adopted across the entirety of Bavaria on 23 April 1516. As Germany unified, Bavaria pushed for adoption of this law on a national basis (see &quot;Broader adoption&quot;).

=== Ingredients permitted ===

According to the 1516 Bavarian law, the only ingredients that could be used in the production of beer were water, barley and hops. The text does not mention yeast as an ingredient, although yeast was at the time knowingly used in the brewing process. It is likely that brewers of the time preferred to see yeast as a fixture of the brewing process. Yeast produced in one batch was commonly transferred to a subsequent batch, thus giving yeast a more permanent character in the brewing process. A full understanding of the chemical basis of yeast and the fermentation process did not come until much later.

=== Other regulations ===
The 1516 Bavarian law set the price of beer (depending on the time of year and type of beer), limited the profits made by innkeepers, and made confiscation the penalty for making impure beer.

=== Text ===
The text (translated) of the 1516 Bavarian law is as follows:

== Purpose, significance, and effect ==

=== Purpose ===
The Bavarian order of 1516 was introduced in part to prevent price competition with bakers for wheat and rye. The restriction of grains to barley was meant to ensure the availability of affordable bread, as wheat and rye were reserved for use by bakers. The rule may have also had a protectionist role, as beers from Northern Germany often contained additives that could not be grown in Bavaria.

Religious conservatism may have also played a role in adoption of the rule in Bavaria, to suppress the use of plants that were allegedly used in pagan rituals, such as gruit, henbane, belladonna, or wormwood. The rule also excluded problematic methods of preserving beer, such as soot, stinging nettle and henbane.

=== Significance and continuity ===
While some sources refer to the Bavarian law of 1516 as the first law regulating food safety, this is inaccurate, as earlier food safety regulations can be traced back as far as ancient Rome. Similarly, some sources claim that the law has been essentially unchanged since its adoption, but as early as the mid-1500s Bavaria began to allow ingredients such as coriander, bay leaf, and wheat. Yeast was also added to modern versions of the law after the discovery of its role in fermentation.

The &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; remains the most famous law that regulates the brewing of beer, and continues to influence brewing not only in Germany, but around the world.

=== Effect on beer diversity in Germany ===
Modern versions of the law have contained significant exceptions for different types of beer (such as top-fermented beers), for export beers, and for different regions. The basic law now declares that only malted Barley/Wheat/Rye, hops, water and yeast are permitted. Reinheitsgebot strictly forbids the use of extenders such as rice, corn, sorghum and other grains favored by American brewers to give a lighter taste as well as being less expensive to brew.

In response to the growth of craft breweries globally, some commentators, German brewers, and even German politicians have argued that the &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; has slowed Germany&#x27;s adoption of beer trends popular in the rest of the world, such as Belgian lambics and American craft styles. In late 2015, Bavarian brewers voted in favor of a revision to the beer laws to allow other natural ingredients. Many brewers still follow the original 1516 purity law as it is considered to be a part of the national identity.

==History==
Until the mid-20th century, the &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; was relatively unknown and applied unevenly across Germany. In the mid-20th century, Bavarian brewers rallied around the &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; to protect themselves against competition amid European market integration.

=== Predecessors ===
The earliest documented mention of beer by a German nobleman is the granting of a brewing licence by Emperor Otto II to the church at Liege (now Belgium), awarded in 974. A variety of other beer regulations also existed in Germany during the late Middle Ages, including in Nuremberg in 1293, Erfurt in 1351, and Weißensee in 1434.

=== Broader adoption ===
The Bavarian order of 1516 formed the basis of rules that spread slowly throughout Germany. Bavaria insisted on its application throughout Germany as a precondition of German unification in 1871. The move encountered strong resistance from brewers outside Bavaria, and imperial law of 1873 taxed the use of other ingredients (rather than banning them) when used by Northern German brewers. It was not until 1906 that the law was applied consistently across all of Germany, and it was not formally referred to as &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; until the Weimar Republic.

In 1952, the basic regulations of the &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; were incorporated into the West German &quot;Biersteuergesetz&quot; (Beer Taxation Law). Bavarian law remained stricter than that of the rest of the country, leading to legal conflict during the 1950s and early 1960s. The law initially applied only to bottom-fermented (&quot;lager&quot;) beers, but brewers of other types of beer soon accepted the law as well.

Outside of Germany, the &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; was formally incorporated in Greek law by the first Greek king, Otto (originally a Bavarian prince). German brewers at the Tsingtao Brewery in the German colony in Qingdao, China also followed the law voluntarily.

=== Modern changes ===
In March 1987 French brewers sued and, in the case of &quot;Commission v Germany (C-178/84)&quot;, the European Court of Justice found that the &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; was protectionist, and therefore in violation of Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome. This ruling concerned only imported beer, so Germany chose to continue to apply the law to beer brewed in Germany. (Greece&#x27;s version of the &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; was struck down around the same time.) General food safety and labeling laws may also apply.

After German reunification in 1990 the Neuzeller Kloster Brewery, a former monastery brewery in the East German town of Neuzelle, Brandenburg, was warned to stop selling its black beer as it contained sugar. After some negotiations the brewery was allowed to sell it under the name &quot;Schwarzer Abt&quot; (&quot;Black Abbot&quot;) but could not label it &quot;Bier&quot;. This decision was repealed by the Federal Administrative Court of Germany through a special permit, and after legal disputes lasting ten years (known as the &quot;Brandenburg Beer War&quot;) Neuzeller Kloster Brewery gained the right to call &quot;Schwarzer Abt&quot; &quot;Bier&quot; again.

The revised &quot;Vorläufiges Biergesetz&quot; (Provisional Beer Law) of 1993, which replaced the earlier regulations, is a slightly expanded version of the &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot;, stipulating that only water, malted barley, hops and yeast be used for any bottom-fermented beer brewed in Germany. In addition, the law allows the use of powdered or ground hops and hop extracts, as well as stabilization and fining agents such as PVPP. Top-fermented beer is subject to the same rules, with the addition that a wider variety of malted grains can be used, as well as pure sugars for flavor and coloring.

The law&#x27;s applicability was further limited by a court ruling in 2005, which allowed the sale of beer with different ingredients as long as it was not labeled &quot;beer&quot;. The law thus became a labeling standard.

Exceptions to the current rules can be sought, and have been granted to allow gluten-free beer to be labeled as beer despite the use of different ingredients.

== Use in beer marketing ==
Because of strong German consumer preferences, labeling beer as being compliant with &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; is believed to be a valuable marketing tool in Germany. German brewers have used the law to market German beer internationally, including a failed attempt to have the law added to the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritages. Breweries in Norway often follow the same rules as in the Reinheitsgebot. Some breweries outside Germany also claim to be compliant to the &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; as part of their marketing, such as:
* Bierstadt Lagerhaus in Denver, Colorado
* WEST Brewery in Glasgow, Scotland
* Kloud in Korea
* Gordon Biersch in California
* Red Oak Brewery in Whitsett, North Carolina
* Olde Mecklenburg Brewery in Charlotte, North Carolina
* Schulz Bräu in Knoxville, Tennessee
* Namibia Breweries in Windhoek, Namibia
* Rosenstadt Brewery in Portland, Oregon;
* Penn Brewery in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
* Bitte Schön Brauhaus in New Hamburg, Ontario
* Steam Whistle Brewing in Toronto, Ontario
* Okanagan Spring Brewery in Vernon, British Columbia
* New Glarus Brewing Company in New Glarus, Wisconsin
* Bohemian Brewery in Salt Lake City, Utah
* Chinggis Beer in Mongolia
* Eisenbahn in Brazil
* Brewery Becker in Brighton, Michigan
* Bierkeller Brewing Company in Columbia, South Carolina

For some vegans the &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot; can be seen as a strong indication that the beer marked as such is vegan. This is in absence of legislation in the UK and elsewhere which require beers to be labelled with all their ingredients and nutritional information.

<text>Dunsfold is a village in the borough of Waverley, Surrey, England, south of Guildford. It lies in the Weald and reaches in the north the southern escarpment of the Greensand Ridge. It includes the Wey and Arun Canal, and just under half of Dunsfold Aerodrome, which is shared with Alfold.

==History==

===Norman English (Middle Ages) building and records===
The village&#x27;s name was recorded as &quot;Duntesfaude&quot; in 1259, &quot;Duntesfaud&quot; in 1272 and &quot;Duntesfalde&quot; in 1291, apparently meaning &quot;Dunt&#x27;s fold&quot;. Alternatively it may be derived from the Old English (and Celtic) &quot;dun&quot; (hill i.e. down) and &quot;fold&quot; (enclosure). Either way folding means enclosing with fences, a way of moving sheep around the land to graze off the remains of previously harvested crops. It still emulated in modern sheep farming with and without pens around the village. There are some prize-winning Aberdeen Angus cattle farmed here but the last dairy herd has now closed.

St Mary &amp; All Saints&#x27; Church is a Norman building, containing the oldest pews in England. The nearby Holy Well was a site of pilgrimage – its waters were thought to cure diseases of the eye. It would be consistent with the topography of the site that the well be a pre-Christian site and the church itself be constructed on a man-made hill of pre-Christian origin.

===Manors===
Three manors were here, all had more cultivated fields, in order of size: Burningfold, Field Place and Graffham Grange.

;Burningfold
Anthony Browne, 6th Viscount Montagu (d. 1767) held this largest estate from a purchase from a Mr Tanner in 1751 until 1756 and his son sold it to Edmund Woods jun. in 1790. Owner Charlotte Woods built and endowed the first school, on the Green in 1850.

;Field Place
Held by Emery Cranley, it briefly split by moiety title between Quenell and Stoughton sisters (both born Cranley), was reunited by Peter Quenell then sold 1651 (to William Yalden) and 1677 (to William Sadler). In 1850 of James Sadler of Chiddingfold held it, by which time its main economy legacy was Field Place, a small manor house, with &quot;a most delightful collection&quot; of roofs of many of pitches and dispositions.

;Graffham Grange
In the early 13th century Walter Giffard, Abbot of Waverley, (1236–51), granted all the rights of the abbey in Graffham to Walter de Graffham for a rent of 16s. a year, rent paid to Markwick, a former possession of Waverley Abbey as late as 1808. Mr. J. C. McAndrew was an owner of what was left of it towards the end of 19th century followed by Mr. F. A. Shepherd.

===Other buildings and industries===
Common House is a late medieval hall which dates from circa 1500, of lowest listing category, Grade II architectural importance. The village has many other houses of architectural interest e.g. &quot;Lark&#x27;s Rise&quot;, &quot;Yonder Lye&quot; and &quot;The Sun Inn&quot; public house, set back from the common, parts of which are clearly ancient particularly the rear bar.

The village was a site of iron smelting from local ironstone (see Bargate stone) and iron-smithery in the Middle Ages. Later, Dunsfold has hosted the construction of the Wey and Arun Canal which is being gradually reopened, and Dunsfold Aerodrome which is used primarily in connection with automobiles of many times, hosting a major television programme on the subject.

==Amenities==
The village has a cricket club with matches usually on Sunday afternoons.

Dunsfold has a small Post Office and shop in the middle of the village.

==Dunsfold Park==

The airstrip was built by the Canadian Army during World War II . After the war the airfield was used to repatriate prisoners of war. Dunsfold was declared inactive in 1946 but was used again in 1948 and 1949 as part of the Berlin Airlift. In 1950 The Hawker Aircraft Company acquired the lease of the site.

In October 1960 the then Hawker Siddeley flight tested its Hawker P. 1127 prototype, the development aircraft that led to the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first VTOL jet fighter bomber. Final assembly of the Harrier and the Hawk trainer aircraft was at Dunsfold. Hawker Siddeley became part of British Aerospace in 1977. On 2 July 1986 British Aerospace&#x27;s deputy chief test pilot Jim Hawkins was killed at Dunsfold when his developmental Hawk 200 crashed. On 24 June 1999 British Aerospace announced the closure of Dunsfold as part of a restructuring; Hawk final assembly had been transferred to Warton in 1988 and Harrier production finished in 1998.

===Post-British Aerospace===
In 2002, BAE Systems (British Aerospace&#x27;s successor) sold Dunsfold Park to The Rutland Group and The Royal Bank of Scotland forming Dunsfold Park Ltd with the intention of developing the site as Britain&#x27; s most sustainable village with 2500 homes. Since 2002, the BBC motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot; has been recorded at the park using the former paint shop as a studio and parts of the runways and taxiways of the aerodrome as a test track.

===The Young Drivers Track===

Some of the track (The Young Drivers Track) is now used by many driving schools and instructors to enable under seventeen-year-olds to learn to drive.

Dunsfold Park is the home to Wings and Wheels, an air and motor show that has been running for many years now and typically held in late August. Currently run by the site owners, Dunsfold Park Ltd, it will continue until the park is redeveloped.

==Demography and housing==
The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

===Eco-town expansion plan===
In 2006, the owners of Dunsfold Park proposed the construction of a new town with 2,600 homes on the site, a school, health services, public transport and road links to the A281, and an expanded business district. One of the largest construction projects in Surrey, it would result in the closure and replacement of the aerodrome. A project of this kind and size is controversial, resulting in the formation of the &quot;STOP Dunsfold Park New Town&quot; campaign.

In late 2007, Dunsfold Park Ltd. applied to have their plans for the new town selected as one of the Brown Ministry&#x27;s proposed &quot;eco-towns&quot;. On 3 April 2008 Dunsfold Park was denied Eco-town status by Housing Minister, Caroline Flint. According to the Government&#x27;s press release over 40 applications including Dunsfold Park were rejected &quot;for being undeliverable or not ambitious enough to meet the high environmental and affordability standards set by Government.&quot;

An appeal in 2009 was rejected by the then Secretary of State John Denham. Inquiry conclusions included remarks on the sustainability of the site including at paragraph 37 of the report dated 24 September 2009 &quot;The Secretary of State has concluded that the development would generate a considerable amount of additional road traffic and he considers that this would have a severe and unacceptable impact on an overstretched local road network, and that the scheme would be unsustainable in transport terms.&quot;

<text>The Harrier, informally referred to as the Harrier jump jet, is a family of jet-powered attack aircraft capable of vertical/short takeoff and landing operations (V/STOL). Named after the bird of prey, it was originally developed by British manufacturer Hawker Siddeley in the 1960s. The Harrier emerged as the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many attempted during that era. It was conceived to operate from improvised bases, such as car parks or forest clearings, without requiring large and vulnerable air bases. Later, the design was adapted for use from aircraft carriers.

There are two generations and four main variants of the Harrier family, developed by both UK and US manufacturers:

* Hawker Siddeley Harrier (first generation)
** British Aerospace Sea Harrier
* McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II (second generation)
** British Aerospace Harrier II
The Hawker Siddeley Harrier is the first generation-version and is also known as the AV-8A or AV-8C Harrier; it was used by multiple air forces, including the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The Sea Harrier is a naval strike/air defence fighter derived from the Hawker Siddeley Harrier; it was operated by both the Royal Navy and the Indian Navy. During the 1980s, a second generation Harrier emerged, manufactured in the United States as the AV-8B and in Britain as the British Aerospace Harrier II respectively. By the start of the 21st century, the majority of the first generation Harriers had been withdrawn, many operators having chosen to procure the second generation as a replacement. In the long term, several operators have announced their intention to supplement or replace their Harrier fleets with the STOVL variant of the F-35 Lightning II, designated as the F-35B.

==Development==
===Background===
Throughout the 1950s, particularly in the years following the Korean War, a number of aircraft companies in both Europe and America separately decided to investigate the prospective capabilities and viability of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, which would eliminate the requirement for vulnerable runways by taking off and landing vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach. In addition to military applications, the prospect of applying such technology to commercial airliners was also viewed with considerable interest by the mid-1950s, thus the value of developing viable vertical take-off systems was judged to be substantial. However, during this era, few companies envisioned that a VTOL aircraft could also be compatible with the characteristics of high performance military aircraft.
During 1957, following an approach by the British aero engine manufacturer Bristol Engine Company, who were designing an innovative vectored thrust engine, British aviation conglomerate Hawker Aircraft developed their design for an aeroplane that could meet an existing NATO specification calling for a &quot;Light Tactical Support Fighter&quot;. Bristol&#x27;s projected vectored thrust engine, which received the name &quot;Pegasus&quot;, harnessed rotatable &quot;cold&quot; jets which were positioned on either side of the compressor along with a &quot;hot&quot; jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe; this concept had originated from Michel Wibault, a French aviation consultant. Throughout much of the early development work, there was no financial support for the project from HM Treasury; however, support for the engine development portion of the effort was sourced via NATO&#x27;s Mutual Weapon Development Program (MWDP).

Senior project engineer Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft to take advantage of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. During March 1959, the newly merged Hawker Siddeley decided to privately fund a pair of prototypes of the design, which had received the internal company designation of P.1127, to demonstrate the design&#x27;s capabilities. During the 1960s, the P.1127 attracted the attention of the RAF; this would eventually result in the development and issuing of Requirement ASR 384, which sought a V/STOL aircraft for ground attack operations. During late 1965, the RAF placed an order for six pre-production &quot;P.1127 (RAF)&quot; aircraft.

===Requirements and emergence===
Around the same time as the RAF&#x27;s interest in the concept, NATO proceeded to develop their own specification, NBMR-3, which called for a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft; specific requirements included the expectation for the performance of such an aircraft to be equivalent to the conventional McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter. Specifications called for a supersonic V/STOL strike fighter with a combat radius of , a cruise speed of Mach 0.92, and a dash speed of Mach 1.5. During the early 1960s, Hawker commenced work upon developing a supersonic version of the P.1127, designated the &quot;P.1150&quot;, culminating in the abortive Hawker P.1154. NBMR.3 also attracted ten other contenders, among which was P.1154&#x27;s principal competitor, the Dassault Mirage IIIV. The P.1154 was ultimately selected to meet NBMR-3; however, this did not lead to orders being placed.

On 6 December 1961, prior to the design being submitted to NATO, it was decided that the P.1154 would be developed with the requirements for use by both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy (RN). Following the cancellation of the NBMR-3 requirement, HSA focused all its attention on the British joint requirement. Accordingly, development of the type continued for some time; however, by October 1963, the Ministry of Aviation was concerned with the project&#x27;s progress, and noted that the effort to combine a strike aircraft and a fighter in a single aircraft, and trying to fit that same airframe to both of the services, was &quot;unsound&quot;. On 2 February 1965, work on the P.1154 was cancelled by the new British government on grounds of cost at the point of prototype construction.

Irrespective of work on the P.1154 programme, development had continued on the subsonic P.1127 evaluation aircraft. A total of nine aircraft, known as the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel, was ordered and manufactured for testing. During 1964, the first of these had commenced flight operations; the Kestrel was assessed by the multinational &quot;Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron&quot;, which consisted of British, US and German pilots, to determine how VTOL aircraft could be operated; the evaluations were finalised in November 1965. During 1966, following the cancellation of the P.1154, the RAF opted to proceed with ordering a modified derivative of the P.1127/Kestrel for service, which was designated the Harrier GR.1.

===First-generation Harriers===
The &quot;Hawker Siddeley Harrier GR.1/GR.3&quot; and the &quot;AV-8A Harrier&quot; were the first generation of the Harrier series, the first operational close-support and reconnaissance attack aircraft with vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) capabilities. These were developed directly from the Hawker P.1127 prototype and the Kestrel evaluation aircraft. On 18 April 1969, the Harrier GR.1 officially entered service with the RAF when the Harrier Conversion Unit at RAF Wittering received its first aircraft. The United States Marine Corps (USMC) also chose to procure the type, receiving 102 AV-8A and 8 TAV-8A Harriers between 1971 and 1976.

The British Aerospace Sea Harrier is a naval V/STOL jet fighter, reconnaissance and attack aircraft; it was a navalised development of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. The first version entered service with the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm in April 1980 as the &quot;Sea Harrier FRS.1&quot;, and was informally known as the &quot;Shar&quot;. Sea Harriers played a high-profile role in the Falklands War of 1982, flying from the aircraft carriers HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; and HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;. Wartime experiences led to the production of an improved model in the form of the upgraded &quot;Sea Harrier FA2&quot;; this version entered operational service on 2 April 1993. The Sea Harrier was also procured by the Indian Navy, where the first Indian Sea Harriers entered squadron service during December 1983.

===Second-generation Harriers===

As early as 1973, Hawker Siddeley and American aviation manufacturer McDonnell Douglas were jointly working on development of a more capable version of the Harrier. Early efforts concentrated on the development of an improved Pegasus engine, designated the &quot;Pegasus 15&quot;, which was being tested by Bristol Siddeley. During August 1981, the program received a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK&#x27;s re-entry into the program. The Harrier was extensively redeveloped by McDonnell Douglas, and later joined by British Aerospace (now parts of Boeing and BAE Systems, respectively), leading to the family of second-generation V/STOL jet multi-role aircraft. The American designation for this was the &quot;AV-8B Harrier II&quot;.

On 12 December 1983, the first production AV-8B was delivered to the USMC. The AV-8B is primarily used for attack or multi-role tasks, typically operated from small aircraft carriers. The RAF also chose to procure the second generation of the British Aerospace-built (with McDonnell Douglas as subcontractor) Harrier II GR5/GR7/GR9, which entered service in the mid-1980s. This model was also operated by several other NATO countries, including Spain and Italy. In December 1989, the first RAF squadron to be equipped with the Harrier II was declared operational. The British Harrier II was used by the RAF and later by the Royal Navy up to 2010, at which point the Harrier II and the Joint Force Harrier operational unit was disbanded as a cost-saving measure.

Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harriers of all types were delivered. While the manufacture of new Harriers concluded in 1997, the last remanufactured aircraft (Harrier II Plus configuration) was delivered in December 2003, ending the Harrier production line.

==Operation==

The Harrier jump jet, though capable of taking off vertically, can do so only at less than its maximum loaded weight. In most cases a short take off is needed to lift the required amount of fuel and weapons needed for a training sortie/mission, using forward speed to supplement the jet lift with aerodynamic lift. A short takeoff also uses less fuel than a vertical take off. On some aircraft carriers, a ski-jump ramp is used at the bow of the carrier to help the aircraft become airborne. Landings are not usually done in a conventional manner because the range of speeds at which this is advisable is narrow due to the relatively vulnerable outrigger undercarriage. Operationally, a near-vertical landing with some forward speed is preferred; this technique is called shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL). Rotating the vectored thrust nozzles to some angle other than rearwards during normal flight (to a maximum of 8-degree forward of vertical, i.e. 98 deg.) is called vectoring in forward flight, or &quot;VIFFing&quot;. This is a dog-fighting tactic, allowing for more sudden braking and higher turn rates. Braking could cause a chasing aircraft to overshoot and present itself as a target for the Harrier, a technique formally developed by the USMC for the Harrier in the early 1970s. This technique was much discussed in the media before the Falklands War in 1982, but ultimately not used by British pilots in that conflict. However, the ability to rotate the nozzles slightly forwards did allow the aircraft to fly slowly backwards in the hover, which was widely used in British and American airshows.

The wind direction is critical during VTOL manoeuvres because unless it enters the intake from straight ahead it will push the nose sideways as it turns to enter the intake (known as intake momentum drag). If not corrected immediately, the aircraft will roll out of control. The pilot has a wind vane in front of the windscreen to help keep pointing into the wind. The procedure for vertical takeoff involves facing the aircraft into the wind. The swivelling nozzles are pointed vertically downwards (thrust vector 90°) and the throttle is pushed to its maximum stop, at which point the aircraft leaves the ground. The throttle is adjusted until hovering is achieved at the desired altitude. The short-takeoff procedure involves proceeding with a normal takeoff and then rotating the nozzles partially downwards (a thrust vector less than 90°) at a speed below the normal takeoff speed; usually this is done at about . For a shorter takeoff run the thrust vector is greater for more jet lift. The reaction control system uses thrusters at the aircraft extremities, nose, tail and wingtips. Thrust from the engine can be temporarily syphoned to control the aircraft&#x27;s pitch, roll and yaw before it is going fast enough for the elevators, rudder and ailerons to become effective.

The Harrier has been described by pilots as &quot;unforgiving&quot; to fly. The aircraft is capable of forward flight (where it behaves like a fixed-wing aircraft above its stall speed) and VTOL (where the conventional lift and control surfaces are ineffective) along with STOL. Accelerating and decelerating transitions between hovering and conventional flight required considerable skill and concentration on the part of the pilot, especially in crosswind conditions. Pilots for the combined UK/US/Germany trials on the Kestrel were first given several hours of helicopter tuition Royal Air Force pilots destined for Harrier squadrons were usually selected from those with single-seat fast-jet experience. On two occasions the Royal Air Force explored whether experienced helicopter pilots, with their ability to hover and transition to forward flight, would be a better source for Harrier squadrons. In both cases the pilots were completely out of their depth with conventional flight, navigation, orientation and weapons delivery at the high speeds of a fast jet. With the introduction of two-seat Harriers, less experienced pilots were introduced. The United States Marine Corps also started with very experienced pilots, who were mostly test pilots. In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling the direction of the four vectoring nozzles. Pilots were impressed that to control the aircraft&#x27;s vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downward.

During 2010, it was announced that the RAF and RN would retire their remaining Harriers by 2011, and in December 2010 the RAF&#x27;s Harrier GR9s made their last operational flights. In June 2011, the MoD denied press reports that the aircraft were to be sold to the US Marine Corps for spares to support their AV-8B fleet. However, at the end of November 2011, Defence Minister Peter Luff announced the sale of the final 72 Harriers to the US Marine Corps, with the aircraft to be used as sources of spare parts for the Marine Corps&#x27;s airworthy fleet.

, the STOVL variant of the F-35 Lightning II, designated the F-35B, has replaced the AV-8B Harrier II in service with the US Marine Corps The RAF and Royal Navy introduced the F-35B in June 2018 with their first F-35 unit, 617 Squadron.

As of March 2021, Italian Navy AV-8Bs had been replaced by F-35Bs, on the Italian aircraft carrier &quot;Cavour&quot;.

In 2016, the Indian Navy retired the last of their remaining 11 Sea Harriers, which had been operating from in favour of the conventional Mikoyan MiG-29K.

Starting in 2007, Spain was looking to replace its Harrier IIs – with the likely option being the F-35B. However, in May 2014, the Spanish government announced that it had decided to extend the aircraft&#x27;s service life to beyond 2025 due to a lack of funds for a replacement aircraft.

==Specifications==
An unusual feature of the Harrier family of aircraft is their use of two types of flight control to provide pitch, roll and yaw control: conventional control surfaces for wingborne flight, and a system of reaction control valves directing jets of bleed air from the high-pressure compressor of the engine out through the extremities of the nose, tail, and at the wingtips during vectored thrust–borne flight and hover modes. The two systems are fully interlinked but air is not supplied to the reaction control valves during conventional wingborne flight.

<doc id="305173" wikidata="Q1424668" url="?curid=305173" title="Pneumatology">
<text>Pneumatology refers to a particular discipline within Christian theology that focuses on the study of the Holy Spirit. The term is derived from the Greek word &quot;Pneuma&quot; (), which designates &quot;breath&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; and metaphorically describes a non-material being or influence. The English term &quot;pneumatology&quot; comes from two Greek words: πνεῦμα (&quot;pneuma&quot;, spirit) and λόγος (&quot;logos&quot;, teaching about). Pneumatology includes study of the person of the Holy Spirit, and the works of the Holy Spirit. This latter category also includes Christian teachings on new birth, spiritual gifts (charismata), Spirit-baptism, sanctification, the inspiration of prophets, and the indwelling of the Holy Trinity (which in itself covers many different aspects). Different Christian denominations have different theological approaches on various pneumatological questions.
==Development==
History of Christian theology is traditionally divided into four main stages, representing also the main periods in historical development of Christian pneumatology:

#Patristic period. The early Church engaged in a debate over the divinity of Jesus, with Arius asserting that the Son is a &quot;creature&quot; or &quot;angel&quot; and Athanasius countering that the Son possesses divine attributes (such as immutability, transcendence, ability to sanctify, and involvement in creation). Although the debate was not pneumatological in nature, it led to a very similar debate between the &quot;Pneumatomachians&quot; and the Cappadocian Fathers.
#Medieval period. In this period ensued a debate regarding the relationship between Christ and the Holy Spirit. The Eastern Church asserted that the Holy Spirit &quot;proceeds&quot; from the Father alone (as stated in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed), while Augustine of Hippo and the medieval Catholic Church added the &quot;filioque&quot; clause to the Creed (the Spirit proceeds from the Father &quot;and the Son&quot;).
#Reformation and Counter-Reformation. Here the relationship between the Spirit and the Scriptures is re-examined. Martin Luther and John Calvin hold that the Spirit has a certain &quot;interpretive authority&quot; to &quot;illuminate&quot; scripture, while Counter-Reformation theologians respond that the Spirit has authorized the Church to serve as authoritative interpreter of Scripture.
#Contemporary era. The contemporary church understands a distinctive relationship between the Spirit and the Church community. Various contemporary theologians grant the Spirit as authority to govern the church, to liberate oppressed communities, and to create experiences associated with faith. Contemporary pneumatology is often marked by the Pentecostal Movement.

<doc id="305174" wikidata="Q4636219" url="?curid=305174" title="3B series computers">
<text>The 3B series computers are a line of minicomputers made between the late 1970s and 1993 by AT&amp;T Computer Systems&#x27; Western Electric subsidiary, for use with the company&#x27;s UNIX operating system. The line primarily consists of the models 3B20, 3B5, 3B15, 3B2, and 3B4000. The series is notable for controlling a series of electronic switching systems for telecommunications, for general computing purposes, and for serving as the historical software porting base for commercial UNIX.

==History==
The first 3B20D was installed in Fresno, California at Pacific Bell in 1981. Within two years, several hundred were in place throughout the Bell System. Some of the units came with &quot;small, slow hard disks&quot;.

The general purpose family of 3B computer systems includes the 3B2, 3B5, 3B15, 3B20S, and 3B4000. They run the AT&amp;T UNIX operating system and were named after the successful 3B20D High Availability processor.

In 1984, after regulatory constraints were lifted, AT&amp;T introduced the 3B20D, 3B20S, 3B5, and 3B2 to the general computer market, a move that some commentators saw as an attempt to compete with IBM. In Europe, the 3B computers were distributed by Italian firm Olivetti, in which AT&amp;T had a minority shareholding. After AT&amp;T bought NCR Corporation, effective January 1992, the computers were marketed through NCR sales channels.

Having produced 70,000 units, the AT&amp;T Oklahoma City plant stopped manufacturing 3B machines at the end of 1993, with the 3B20D to be the last units manufactured.

==3B high-availability processors==
The original series of 3B computers includes the models 3B20C, 3B20D, 3B21D, and 3B21E.

These systems are 32-bit microprogrammed duplex (redundant) high availability processor units running a real-time operating system. They were first produced in the late 1970s at the Western Electric factory in Lisle, Illinois, for telecommunications applications including the 4ESS and 5ESS systems.

They use the Duplex Multi Environment Real Time (DMERT) operating system which was renamed UNIX-RTR (Real Time Reliable) in 1982. The Data Manipulation Unit (DMU) provides arithmetic and logic operations on 32-bit words using eight AMD 2901 4-bit-slice ALUs. The first 3B20D is called the Model 1. Each processor&#x27;s control unit consists of two frames of circuit packs. The whole duplex system requires seven-foot frames of circuit packs plus at least one tape drive frame (most telephone companies at that time wrote billing data on magnetic tapes), and many washing machine-sized disk drives. For training and lab purposes, a 3B20D can be divided into two &quot;half-duplex&quot; systems. A 3B20S consists of most of the same hardware as a half-duplex but uses a completely different operating system.

The 3B20C was briefly available as a high-availability fault tolerant multiprocessing general-purpose computer in the commercial market in 1984. The 3B20E was created to provide a cost-reduced 3B20D for small offices that did not expect such high availability. It consists of a virtual &quot;emulated&quot; 3B20D environment running on a stand-alone general purpose computer; the system was ported to many computers, but primarily runs on the Sun Microsystems Solaris environment.

There were improvements to the 3B20D UNIX-RTR system in both software and hardware in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. Innovations included disk independent operation (DIOP: the ability to continue essential software processing such as telecommunications after duplex failure of redundant essential disks); off-line boot (the ability to split in half and boot the out-of-service half, typically on a new software release) and switch forward (switch processing to the previously out-of-service half); upgrading the disks to solid-state drive (SSD) ; and upgrading the tape unit to CompactFlash.

The processor was re-engineered and renamed in 1992 as the 3B21D. It is still in use as a component of Nokia products such as the 2STP signal transfer point and the 4ESS and 5ESS switches, which Nokia inherited from AT&amp;T spin-off Lucent Technologies.

==Minicomputers==
===3B20S===
The 3B20S (simplex) was developed at Bell Labs and produced by Western Electric in 1982 for general purpose internal Bell System use. The 3B20S has hardware similar to the 3B20D, but one unit instead of two. The machine is approximately the size of a large refrigerator, requiring a minimum of 170 square feet floor space. It was in use at the 1984 Summer Olympics, where around twelve 3B20S served the email requirements of the &quot;Electronic Messaging System&quot;, which was built to replace the man-based messaging system of earlier Olympiads. The system connected around 1800 user terminals and 200 printers. The 3B20A is an enhanced version of the 3B20S, adding in a second processing unit working in parallel as a multiprocessor unit.

===3B5===
The 3B5 is built with the older Western Electric WE 32000 32-bit microprocessor. The initial versions have discrete memory management unit hardware using gate arrays, and support segment-based memory translation. I/O is programmed using memory-mapped techniques. The machine is approximately the size of a dishwasher, though adding the reel-to-reel tape drive increases its size. These computers use SMD hard drives.

===3B15===
The 3B15, introduced in 1985, uses the WE 32100 and is the faster follow-on to the 3B5 with similar large form factor.

===3B4000===
The 3B4000 is a high availability server introduced in 1987 and based on a &#x27;snugly-coupled&#x27; architecture using the WE series 32x00 32-bit processor. Known internally as &#x27;Apache&#x27;, the 3B4000 is a follow-on to the 3B15 and initial revisions use a 3B15 as a master processor. Developed in the mid-1980&#x27;s at the Lisle Indian Hill West facility by the High Performance Computer Development Lab, the system consists of multiple high performance (at the time) processor boards – adjunct processing elements (APEs) and adjunct communication elements (ACEs). These adjunct processors run a customized UNIX kernel with drivers for SCSI (APEs) and serial boards (ACEs). The processing boards are interconnected by a redundant low latency parallel bus (ABUS) running at 20 MB/s. The UNIX kernels running on the adjunct processors are modified to allow the fork/exec of processes across processing units. The system calls and peripheral drivers are also extended to allow processes to access remote resources across the ABUS. Since the ABUS is hot-swappable, processors can be added or replaced without shutting down the system. If one of the adjunct processors fails during operation, the system can detect and restart programs that were running on the failed element.

The 3B4000 is capable of significant expansion; one test system (including storage) occupies 17 mid-height cabinets. Generally, the performance of the system increases linearly with additional processing elements, however the lack of a true shared memory capability requires rewriting applications that rely heavily on this feature to avoid a severe performance penalty.

==Microcomputers==
===3B2===

The 3B2 was introduced in 1984 using the WE 32000 32-bit microprocessor at 8 MHz with memory management chips that supports demand paging. Uses include the Switching Control Center System. The 3B2 Model 300, which can support up to 18 users, is approximately high and the 3B2 Model 400 is approximately high.

The 300 was soon supplanted by the 3B2/310 running at 10 MHz, which features the WE 32100 CPU as do later models. The Model 400, introduced in 1985, allows more peripheral slots and more memory, and has a built-in 23 MB QIC tape drive managed by a floppy disk controller (nicknamed the &quot;floppy tape&quot;). These three models use standard MFM &quot; hard disk drives.

There are also Model 100 and Model 200 3B2 systems.

The 3B2/600, running at 18 MHz, offers an improvement in performance and capacity: it features a SCSI controller for the 60 MB QIC tape and two internal full-height disk drives. The 600 is approximately twice as tall as a 400, and is oriented with the tape and floppy disk drives opposite the backplane (instead of at a right angle to it as on the 3xx, 4xx and later 500 models). Early models use an internal Emulex card to interface the SCSI controller with ESDI disks, with later models using SCSI drives directly.

The 3B2/500 was the next model to appear, essentially a 3B2/600 with enough components removed to fit into a 400 case; one internal disk drive and several backplane slots are sacrificed in this conversion. Unlike the 600, which because of its two large fans is loud, the 500 is tolerable in an office environment, like the 400.

The 3B2/700 is an uprated version of the 600 featuring a slightly faster processor (WE 32200 at 22 MHz), and the 3B2/1000 is an additional step in this direction (WE 32200 at 24 MHz).

===3B1 desktop workstation===
Officially named the &quot;AT&amp;T UNIX PC&quot;, AT&amp;T introduced a desktop computer in 1985 that is often dubbed the &quot;3B1&quot;. However, this workstation is unrelated in hardware to the 3B line, and is based on the Motorola 68010 microprocessor. It runs a derivative of Unix System V Release 2 by Convergent Technologies. The system, which is also known as the &quot;PC-7300&quot;, is tailored for use as a productivity tool in office environments and as an electronic communication center.

<doc id="305175" wikidata="Q880905" url="?curid=305175" title="Blackpool Tower">
<text>Blackpool Tower is a tourist attraction in Blackpool, Lancashire, England, which was opened to the public on 14 May 1894. When it opened, Blackpool Tower was the tallest man-made structure in the British Empire. Inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, it is tall and is the 125th-tallest freestanding tower in the world. Blackpool Tower is also the common name for the Tower Buildings, an entertainment complex in a red-brick three-storey block that comprises the tower, Tower Circus, the Tower Ballroom, and roof gardens, which was designated a Grade I listed building in 1973.

==Background==
The Blackpool Tower Company was founded by London-based Standard Contract &amp; Debenture Corporation in 1890; it bought an aquarium on Central Promenade with the intention of building a replica Eiffel Tower on the site. John Bickerstaffe, a former mayor of Blackpool, was asked to become chairman of the new company, and its shares went on sale in July 1891. The Standard Corporation kept 30,000 £1 shares and offered £150,000 worth of shares to the public; initially only two-thirds were taken up, forcing the company to ask for more cash contributions from its existing shareholders, but the poor financial situation of the company, exacerbated by the falling share price, rendered it unable to pay. Bickerstaffe, to avoid the potential collapse of the venture, bought any available shares until his original holding of £500 amounted to £20,000. He also released the Standard Corporation from its share commitments. When the Tower opened in 1894, its success justified the investment of nearly £300,000, and the company made a £30,000 profit in 1896.

Two Lancashire architects, James Maxwell and Charles Tuke, designed the tower and oversaw the laying of its foundation stone on 29 September 1891. By the time the Tower finally opened on 14 May 1894, both men had died. Heenan &amp; Froude, then of Manchester, were appointed structural engineers, supplying and constructing both the tower, the electric lighting and the steel front pieces for the aquariums. A new system of hydraulic riveting was used, based on the technology of Fielding &amp; Platt of Gloucester.

The total cost for the design and construction of the tower and buildings was about £290,000. Five million Accrington bricks, of steel and of cast iron were used to construct the tower and base. Its base is hidden by the building that houses Blackpool Tower Circus. The building occupies a total of . At the summit of the tower there is a flagpole where the height at the top measures from the ground. A time capsule was buried under the foundation stone on 25 September 1891.

The tower&#x27;s design was ahead of its time. As a writer for the BBC noted: &quot;In heavy winds the building will gently sway, what a magnificent Victorian engineering masterpiece.&quot;

==History==
When the Tower opened, 3,000 customers took the first rides to the top. Tourists paid sixpence for admission, sixpence more for a ride in the lifts to the top, and a further sixpence for the circus. The first members of the public to ascend the tower had been local journalists in September 1893, using constructors&#x27; ladders. The top of the Tower caught fire in 1897, and the platform was seen on fire from up to away.

The Tower was not painted properly during its first thirty years and became corroded, leading to discussions about demolishing it. However, it was decided to rebuild it instead, and all the steelwork in the structure was replaced and renewed between 1920 and 1924. On 22 December 1894, Norwegian ship &quot;Abana&quot; was sailing from Liverpool to Savannah, Georgia, but was caught up in a storm, and mistook the recently built Blackpool Tower for a lighthouse. &quot;Abana&quot; was first seen off North Pier, and later drifted to Little Bispham where she was wrecked, and can still be seen at low tide. The ship&#x27;s bell still hangs in St Andrews Church in Cleveleys.

In 1940, during the Second World War, the crow&#x27;s nest was removed to allow the structure to be used as a Royal Air Force radar station known as &#x27;RAF Tower&#x27;, which proved unsuccessful.

A post box was opened at the top of the tower in 1949. The hydraulic lifts to the top of the tower were replaced in 1956–57 and the winding-gear was converted to use an electric motor.

The top of the tower was painted silver in 1977 as part of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Silver Jubilee celebrations. A giant model of King Kong was placed on the side of the tower in 1984. In 1985, escapologist Karl Bartoni and his bride were married suspended in a cage from the tower.

The lifts and winding gear were again replaced in 1992. The same year, the tower complex was renamed Tower World, and was opened by Diana, Princess of Wales. The tower is usually painted in dark red, except for its centenary year in 1994 when it was painted gold by abseiling painters. In 1998, a &quot;Walk of Faith&quot; glass floor panel was opened at the top of the tower. Made up of two sheets of laminated glass, it weighs half a tonne and is two inches thick. In October 2007, a laser beam installed on the Tower for the duration of the annual Illuminations was criticised by astronomer Sir Patrick Moore, presenter of television programme &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;, who said: &quot;Light pollution is a huge problem. I am not saying we should turn all the lights out, that is not practical, but there are some things which are very unnecessary. The Blackpool Tower light is certainly something I do not think we should be doing. I very much oppose it.&quot; The beam could be seen away; Moore called for it to be stopped. The centre for Astrophysics at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston said the laser has added to a spiralling problem affecting astronomy.

The tower has transmitters for local FM station Radio Wave 96.5 and some non-broadcast services.

The tower continued to be owned by the Bickerstaffe family until 1964, when the Blackpool Tower Company was sold to EMI. Since then it has been owned by Trust House Forte, First Leisure Corporation, and Leisure Parcs Ltd, owned by Trevor Hemmings. In March 2010, it was announced that Blackpool Council had bought Blackpool Tower, and that the Merlin Entertainment Group would manage it and add various attractions, including a new Dungeon attraction, and a new observation deck called Blackpool Tower Eye would operate at the top of the tower. The company was also to manage the Blackpool Louis Tussauds waxwork museum, to be rebranded as Madame Tussauds.

On 12 December 2021, the tower was evacuated after reports of smoke. Fire services found it was caused by an electrical fault in a neighbouring property. 

On 28 December 2023, at around 14:15 GMT, flames were reported close to the top of the tower. Lancashire Fire &amp; Rescue responded with six fire engines, a drone team and rope rescue. In addition to this, LFRS were also supported by a helicopter from the National Police Air Service. Later that day, at around 16:30 GMT, it was revealed that the &#x27;flames&#x27; were in fact orange netting that was blowing in the wind.

The top of the tower is currently known as the Blackpool Tower Eye. At a height of , the Eye is the highest observation deck in North West England. It was previously known simply as the Tower Top, until it reopened in September 2011. Reopening after a major renovation, new owner Blackpool Council brought in Merlin Entertainments to manage the attractions, with Merlin deciding to incorporate the tower into its range of &quot;Eye&quot; branded attractions.

==Tower Ballroom==

The original ballroom, the Tower Pavilion, opened in August 1894. It was smaller than the present ballroom, and occupied the front of the tower complex. The Tower Ballroom was built between 1897 and 1898 to the designs of Frank Matcham, who also designed Blackpool Grand Theatre, and it opened in 1899. It was commissioned by the Tower company in response to the opening of the Empress Ballroom in the Winter Gardens. The sprung ballroom floor is and is made up of 30,602 blocks of mahogany, oak and walnut. Above the stage is the inscription &quot;Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear&quot;, from the poem &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; by William Shakespeare. Each crystal chandelier in the ballroom can be lowered to the floor to be cleaned, which takes over a week.

From 1930 until his retirement in 1970, the resident organist was Reginald Dixon, known affectionately worldwide as &quot;Mr. Blackpool&quot;. The first Wurlitzer organ was installed in 1929, but it was replaced in 1935 by one designed by Dixon. Ernest Broadbent took over as resident organist in 1970, retiring due to ill-health in 1977. The current resident organist is Phil Kelsall who has been playing the organ at the Tower since 1975, when he started in the circus. Kelsall became resident in the ballroom in 1977, and he was awarded an MBE like Dixon in 2010 for services to music.

The ballroom was damaged by fire in December 1956; the dance floor was destroyed, along with the restaurant underneath the ballroom. Restoration took two years and cost £500,000, with many of the former designers and builders coming out of retirement to assist; the restaurant then became the Tower Lounge.

The BBC series &quot;Come Dancing&quot; was televised from the Tower Ballroom for many years; it has also hosted editions of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, including the grand finals of the second and ninth series, on 11 December 2004 and 17 December 2011 respectively.

The Blackpool Junior Dance Festival (&quot;Open to the World&quot;) has been held each year in the ballroom since 1964.
Also, the World Modern Jive Championships are held annually.

Dancing was not originally allowed on Sundays; instead, sacred music was played. The ballroom also originally had very strict rules, including:

*&quot;Gentlemen may not dance unless with a Lady&quot; and
*&quot;Disorderly conduct means immediate expulsion&quot;.

The ballroom has had a number of resident dance bands including Bertini and his band, and Charlie Barlow. Other smaller dance bands have also appeared as residents, including the Eric Delaney Band and the Mike James Band.

Under the management of Leisure Parcs, and the direction of bandleader Greg Francis, the Blackpool Tower Big Band was reformed in 2001 after an absence of 25 years. The New Squadronaires, the Memphis Belle Swing Orchestra and the Glenn Miller Tribute Orchestra also performed. Themed nights were also introduced along with the sixteen-piece orchestra, with resident singers including Tony Benedict, Lynn Kennedy, Robert Young and Mark Porter. The Empress Orchestra became resident in the ballroom in 2005, alongside the specially created and smaller Empress Dance Band.

The Tower&#x27;s orchestrion is now in the collection of Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum. The ballroom, together with the Tower, Circus and Roof Garden, were designated a Grade I listed building in 1973.

==Tower Circus==
The Tower Circus is positioned at the base of the tower, between its four legs. The circus first opened to the public on 14 May 1894, when admission was from 6d, and, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, has not missed a season since.

The present interior was designed by Frank Matcham and was completed in 1900.

The circus ring can be lowered into a pool of water and holds at a depth of up to , which allows for Grand Finales with Dancing Fountains. The Tower Circus is one of four left in the world that can do this.

The clown Charlie Cairoli appeared at the tower for 39 years. Britain&#x27;s best-known ringmaster Norman Barrett worked the ring for 25 years, while Henry Lytton Jr. was Ringmaster here from 1954 to 1965.

Animals appeared in the circus until 1990. It was planned to close the circus at the end of the 1990 season and replace it with an animatronic attraction. Public opinion and the fact the animatronics were not ready meant that the circus continued.

Today, the circus is produced and directed by Hungarian Laci Endresz, who is married to Maureen, one of the Roberts family who have a long association with the Tower Circus. A live band (sometimes accompanied by Mooky the Clown) provides all the music for the show, often dynamically syncing with the performers&#x27; movements. The circus band play a variety of different songs, usually Latin for the acts. In winter, the circus stages a pantomime instead of the regular show.

==Menagerie and aquarium==
Dr. Cocker&#x27;s Aquarium, Aviary and Menagerie had existed on the site since 1873. It was kept open to earn revenue while the Tower building went up around it, and then became one of the Tower&#x27;s major attractions. The aquarium was modelled on the limestone caverns in Derbyshire. It housed 57 different species of fresh water and salt water fish, and the largest tank held of salt water. The menagerie and aviary were regarded as one of the finest collections in the country, and included lions, tigers, and polar bears.

The menagerie continued until 1973, when it was closed following the opening of Blackpool Zoo near Stanley Park. Due to the Tower being run by Merlin Entertainments, which also runs the nearby Sea Life Centre, the aquarium closed in 2010, and was remodelled to make way for a new &quot;Dungeons&quot; attraction.

==Other attractions==

Jungle Jim&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Indoor Play was a large indoor children&#x27;s adventure playground situated within the Tower. It featured a £3 million interactive play scheme, based on a notional lost city, covering over . Children could tackle a series of adventures in search of hidden treasure. A new attraction &quot;The Fifth Floor&quot; which is a brand new multi-functional free family entertainment and events area opened in September 2019 as well as a VR roller coaster ride and a circus themed arcade.

The Tower Lounge Bar was a large pub with a capacity of 1,700, but staff usually limited occupancy to 1,400 for a more relaxed atmosphere. It closed down in 2014, and has since reopened as a Harry Ramsden&#x27;s fish and chip restaurant.

The Blackpool Tower Dungeon is part of an international chain of Dungeon experiences operated by Merlin Entertainments. Opened in 2011, it incorporates elements of history with fear, and shows based on gallows humour. It also features &quot;Drop Dead&quot;, a drop tower that simulates being executed by hanging. As an addition to the Dungeon brand Merlin introduced the first ever Dungeon themed Escape Room in 2017.

Merlin Entertainments launched Dino Mini Golf, an indoor crazy golf course with &quot;9 holes of prehistoric fun&quot;, in March 2018. It has been described by Aaron Edgar, the Blackpool Tower Operations manager, as &quot;65 million years in the making&quot;.

Visible through the glass floor of the Tower Eye on the promenade some below, is Blackpool&#x27;s famous &quot;Comedy Carpet&quot;. In front of the tower, the &quot;Comedy Carpet&quot; by Gordon Young is a celebration of the resort&#x27;s long comedic history in the form of a visual pavement of jokes and catchphrases, embedded into the surface of the revamped promenade. From above, it is easy to read the eternal catchphrase of the late Sir Bruce Forsyth, &quot;Nice to see you - to see you... nice!&quot;.

==Tower maintenance==
Painting the Tower structure takes seven years to complete, and the workers who maintain the structure are known as &quot;Stick Men&quot;. There are 563 steps from the roof of the Tower building to the top of the Tower, which the maintenance teams use for the structure&#x27;s upkeep. If the wind speed exceeds , the top of the Tower is closed as a safety precaution; if the wind reaches the tower top sways by an inch. of cables are used to feed the 10,000 light bulbs which are used to illuminate the Tower. In April 2002, the Tower maintenance team was featured in the BBC One programme &quot;Britain&#x27;s Toughest Jobs&quot;.

<doc id="305180" wikidata="Q1053648" url="?curid=305180" title="Centipede (video game)">
<text>Centipede is a 1981 fixed shooter video game developed and published by Atari for arcades. Designed by Dona Bailey and Ed Logg, it was one of the most commercially successful games from the golden age of arcade video games and one of the first with a significant female player base. The primary objective is to shoot all the segments of a centipede that winds down the playing field. An arcade sequel, &quot;Millipede&quot;, followed in 1982.

&quot;Centipede&quot; was ported to Atari&#x27;s own Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, and Atari 8-bit computers. Under the Atarisoft label, the game was sold for the Apple II, Commodore 64, ColecoVision, VIC-20, IBM PC (as a self-booting disk), Intellivision, and TI-99/4A. Superior Software published the port for the BBC Micro. Versions for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color were also produced, as well as a version for the short-lived Game.com developed by Handheld Games and published by Tiger Electronics.

==Gameplay==

The player controls the small insect-like creature called the &quot;Bug Blaster&quot;. It is moved around the bottom area of the screen with a trackball and fires small darts at a segmented centipede advancing from the top of the screen through a field of mushrooms. Each segment of the centipede becomes a mushroom when shot; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the screen, with the rear piece sprouting its own head. If the centipede head is destroyed, the segment behind it becomes the next head. Shooting the head is worth 100 points while the other segments are 10. The centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right. When it touches a mushroom or reaches the edge of the screen, it descends one level and reverses direction. The player can destroy mushrooms (a point each) by shooting them, but each takes four shots to destroy. At higher levels, the screen can become increasingly crowded with mushrooms due to player/enemy actions, causing the centipede to descend more rapidly.

Once the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it stays within the player area and one-segment &quot;head&quot; centipedes will periodically appear from the side. This continues until the player has eliminated both the original centipede and all heads. When all the centipede&#x27;s segments are destroyed, another one enters from the top of the screen. The initial centipede is 10 or 12 segments long, including the head; each successive centipede is one segment shorter and accompanied by one detached, faster-moving head. This pattern continues until all segments are separate heads, after which it repeats with a single full-length centipede.

The player also encounters other creatures besides the centipedes. Fleas drop vertically and disappear upon touching the bottom of the screen, occasionally leaving a trail of mushrooms in their path when only a few mushrooms are in the player movement area; they are worth 200 points each and take two shots to destroy. Spiders move across the player area in a zig-zag pattern and eat some of the mushrooms; they are worth 300, 600, or 900 points depending on the range they are shot from. Scorpions move horizontally across the screen, turning every mushroom they touch into poison mushrooms. Scorpions are also worth the most points of all enemies with 1,000 points each. A centipede touching a poison mushroom will attack straight down toward the bottom, then return to normal behavior upon reaching it. This &quot;poisoned&quot; centipede can be both beneficial and detrimental to the player; the player can destroy them rapidly as it descends down, while at the same time, they can be very challenging to avoid, especially if already split into multiple segments.

The Bug Blaster is destroyed when hit by any enemy, after which any poisonous or partially damaged mushrooms revert to normal. 5 points are awarded for each regenerated mushroom. An extra life is awarded every 12,000 points.

==Development==
Dona Bailey and Ed Logg developed &quot;Centipede&quot; for Atari. Logg, a supervisor, said that he did the design, while Bailey did about half of the programming. Bailey was one of the few female game programmers in the industry. Logg believed that its design was not biased by sex, unlike a fighting or sports game. Bailey said: &quot;I really like pastels ... I really wanted it to look different, to be visually arresting&quot;. Bailey had only recently discovered video games when she heard the song &quot;Space Invader&quot; (1979) by The Pretenders and then played &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978), but she was one of the few American women at the time with experience in assembly language programming.

==Reception==
&quot;Centipede&quot; was one of the top four highest-grossing arcade games of 1982 in the United States, along with &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. The Atari VCS port of &quot;Centipede&quot; sold 1,475,240 cartridges during 1982 to 1983, becoming the 11th-best-selling Atari game.

It was also one of the first coin-operated arcade video games to have a significant female player base. &quot;How to Win Video Games&quot; (1982) estimated that half of its players and 60% of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;″s were women, while 95% of &quot;Defender&quot; players were men.

In 1983, &quot;Softline&quot; readers named &quot;Centipede&quot; ninth on the magazine&#x27;s Top Thirty list of Atari 8-bit programs by popularity. The game received the award for &quot;1984 Best Computer Action Game&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards where the judges described it as &quot;pack[ing] a real roundhouse punch&quot;, and suggested that some &quot;insist that [the &quot;Centipede&quot;] Atari cartridge is the best home-arcade edition you can buy&quot;. David H. Ahl of &quot;Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games&quot; said that the Atari 5200 version was &quot;delightful fun&quot;.

In a 1984 &quot;Video&quot; review of the Apple II version of the game, Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz commented that &quot;the graphic limits of the Apple crimp the style&quot; and expressed disappointment in the game&#x27;s &quot;sluggish&quot; interfacing with trackball controllers.

In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked the arcade version 15th on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the arcade version as number 84 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, praising the cool concept, trackball control, and that it is accessible enough that &quot;any human on the planet can play it well enough to enjoy it&quot; yet &quot;hard enough that even excellent gamers find it challenging&quot;.

In 2020, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Centipede&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

===Sequels and remakes===

&quot;Centipede&quot; was followed by &quot;Millipede&quot; in 1982.

In 1992, Atari Games developed a prototype of an arcade game called &quot;Arcade Classics&quot; for their 20th anniversary, which includes &quot;Missile Command 2&quot; and &quot;Super Centipede&quot; with co-op 2-player mode.

A 3D fantasy role-playing game based on the original game was being developed by Dark Science for the Atari Jaguar CD under the working title &quot;Centipede 2000&quot;. The source code of the project no longer exists and the only remaining proof of its existence is a short video clip from the developer.

In 1998, after acquiring the intellectual property of Atari from then-owner JT Storage, Hasbro Interactive released a new version of the game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Dreamcast, and Mac OS. It is very different from the original: 3D graphics, free movement around the map, and a campaign which can be played in single-player or multiplayer mode.

In 2011, Atari, SA released &quot;&quot; for Nintendo 3DS and Wii.

In 2019, ICE created a remaster of &quot;Centipede&quot; known as &quot;Centipede Chaos&quot; for arcades.

In 2020, GameTaco released &quot;Centipede: Cash Blast&quot; for iOS.

A revamped version of the game, titled &quot;Centipede: Recharged&quot;, was released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Google Stadia, and Atari VCS with exclusive content in September 2021 as part of the company&#x27;s &quot;Atari Recharged&quot; series.

<text>The Umm al Samim () (also known as the Umm as Samim) is a quicksand area on the eastern edge of the Rub al&#x27;khali desert largely within Oman&#x27;s borders. The waters, such as they are, drain into this brackish low-lying closed basin area off the Omani mountains and the wadis of the Rub al&#x27;khali. The Al Samim (known locally as the &#x27;Mother of Poisons&#x27; or the &#x27;Mother of Worries&#x27;) is a salt marsh with a solid-looking crust, but can be very treacherous when broken through. There is little vegetation.

Sir Wilfred Thesiger was the first European to see the area in the late 1940s after his travels from Salalah in Oman.

<text>In some operating systems, the null device is a device file that discards all data written to it but reports that the write operation succeeded. This device is called codice_1 on Unix and Unix-like systems, codice_2 (see TOPS-20) or codice_3 on CP/M and DOS (internally codice_4), codice_5 on OS/2 and newer Windows systems (internally codice_6 on Windows NT), codice_7 on Amiga operating systems, and codice_8 on OpenVMS. In Windows Powershell, the equivalent is codice_9. It provides no data to any process that reads from it, yielding EOF immediately. In IBM operating systems DOS/360 and successors and also in OS/360 and successors such files would be assigned in JCL to codice_10.

In programmer jargon, especially Unix jargon, it may also be called the bit bucket or black hole.

==History==
 is described as an empty regular file in Version 4 Unix.

The Version 5 Unix manual describes a device with modern semantics.

==Usage==
The null device is typically used for disposing of unwanted output streams of a process, or as a convenient empty file for input streams. This is usually done by redirection. For example, codice_11 can be used to dry-run the TAR file archiving utility to see if any errors would occur but without writing any file.

The codice_1 device is a special file, not a directory, so one cannot move a whole file or directory into it with the Unix codice_13 command.

== References in computer culture ==
This entity is a common inspiration for technical jargon expressions and metaphors by Unix programmers, e.g. &quot;please send complaints to codice_1&quot;, &quot;my mail got archived in codice_1&quot;, and &quot;redirect to codice_1&quot;—being jocular ways of saying, respectively: &quot;don&#x27;t bother sending complaints&quot;, &quot;my mail was deleted&quot;, and &quot;go away&quot;. The iPhone Dev Team commonly uses the phrase &quot;send donations to codice_1&quot;, meaning they do not accept donations. The fictitious person name &quot;Dave (or Devin) Null&quot; is sometimes similarly used (e.g., &quot;send complaints to Dave Null&quot;). In 1996, Dev Null was an animated virtual reality character created by Leo Laporte for MSNBC&#x27;s computer and technology TV series &quot;The Site&quot;. Dev/null is also the name of a vampire hacker in the computer game . A 2002 advertisement for the Titanium PowerBook G4 reads &quot;Sends other UNIX boxes to /dev/null.&quot;

The null device is also a favorite subject of technical jokes, such as warning users that the system&#x27;s codice_1 is already 98% full. The 1995 April Fool&#x27;s issue of the German magazine &quot;c&#x27;t&quot; reported on an enhanced codice_1 chip that would efficiently dispose of the incoming data by converting it to a flicker on an internal glowing LED.

Dev/Null is also the name of an electronic dance music producer and jungle DJ.

<doc id="305185" wikidata="Q1368170" url="?curid=305185" title="Third baseman">
<text>A third baseman, abbreviated 3B, is the player in baseball or softball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base — the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.

Third base is known as the &quot;hot corner&quot;, because the third baseman is often the infielder who stands closest to the batter—roughly 90–120 feet away, but even closer if a bunt is expected. Most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction. A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions to catch batted balls whose speed can exceed .

The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm, as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base or quick ones to second base to start a double play. As with middle infielders, right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base. Mike Squires, who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983, is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty. Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast.

The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territories.

Expectations of how well a third baseman should be able to hit have risen over time; in the early years of the sport, these expectations were similar to those for shortstops, the third baseman being merely the less skilled defensive player. Players who could hit with more ability often were not suited for third base, either because they were left-handed or because they were not mobile enough for the position. However, the beginning of the live-ball era in the 1920s created a greater demand for more offense, and third basemen have since been expected to hit either for a high average (.290 or better) or with moderate to substantial power. Since the 1950s the position has become more of a power position with sluggers such as Eddie Mathews, Mike Schmidt and Ron Santo becoming stars.

There are fewer third basemen in the Baseball Hall of Fame than there are Hall of Famers of any other position. Few third basemen have gone on to have successful managing careers; exceptions include John McGraw, Bobby Cox, Jimmy Dykes, and Negro leaguer Dave Malarcher.

<text>St. Moritz ( , , ; ; ; ; ) is a high Alpine resort town in the Engadine in Switzerland, at an elevation of about above sea level. It is Upper Engadine&#x27;s major town and a municipality in the administrative region of Maloja in the Swiss canton of the Grisons.

St. Moritz lies on the southern slopes of the Albula Alps below the Piz Nair () overlooking the flat and wide glaciated valley of the Upper Engadine and eponymous lake: Lake St. Moritz. It hosted the Winter Olympics in 1928 and 1948.

==History==

Votive offerings, swords, and needles from the Bronze Age found at the base of the springs in St. Moritz indicate that the Celts had already discovered them. St. Moritz is first mentioned around 1137–39 as &quot;ad sanctum Mauricium&quot;. The village was named after Saint Maurice, an early Christian saint from southern Egypt said to have been martyred in the 3rd century by Maximian in Switzerland while serving as leader of the Theban Legion.

Pilgrims traveled to Saint Mauritius, often to the church of the springs, where they drank from the blessed, bubbling waters of the Mauritius springs in the hopes of being healed. In 1519, the Medici pope Leo X promised full absolution to anyone making a pilgrimage to the church of the springs. In the 16th century, the first scientific treatises about the St. Moritz mineral springs were written. In 1535, Paracelsus, the great practitioner of natural remedies, spent some time in St. Moritz.
Although it received some visitors during the summer, the origins of the winter resort only date back to September 1864, when St. Moritz hotel pioneer Caspar Badrutt made a wager with four British summer guests: they should return in winter and, if the village was not to their liking, then he would reimburse their travel costs. If they were to find St. Moritz attractive in winter, then he would invite them to stay as his guests for as long as they wished. This marked not only the start of winter tourism in St. Moritz but also the start of winter tourism in the whole of the Alps. The first tourist office in Switzerland was established the same year in the village. St. Moritz developed rapidly in the late nineteenth century; the first electric light in Switzerland was installed in 1878 at the Kulm Hotel, and the first curling tournament on the continent was held in 1880. The first European Ice-Skating Championships were held at St. Moritz in 1882 and first golf tournament in the Alps held in 1889. The first bob run and bob race was held in 1890. By 1896, St. Moritz became the first village in the Alps to install electric trams and opened the Palace Hotel. A horse race was held on snow in 1906, and on the frozen lake the following year. The first ski school in Switzerland was established in St. Moritz in 1929.

St. Moritz hosted the 1928 Winter Olympics—the stadium still stands today—and again in 1948. It has hosted over 20 FIBT World Championships, four FIS Alpine World Ski Championships (1934/1974/2003/2017) and over 40 Engadin Skimarathons since 1969. It has also hosted many other events since, including some unlikely ones on the frozen lake in the 1970s and 1980s such as a golf tournament, (1979), a snow polo tournament (held every year in January since 1985) and Cricket on Ice (1989). St. Moritz has also been the venue for many Sailing and Windsurfing World Championships.

Since the early 1980s St. Moritz is also promoted and known as &quot;Top of the World&quot;. The expression was registered as a trademark by the tourist office in 1987.

==Sport==

St. Moritz has been a resort for winter sport vacations since the 19th century. Students from Oxford and Cambridge went there to play each other; the predecessor of the recurring Ice Hockey Varsity Match was a bandy match played in St. Moritz in 1885. St. Moritz was the host city for the Winter Olympic Games in 1928 and 1948, one of three cities to host twice, along with Innsbruck, Austria, and Lake Placid in the United States. It also hosted the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships in 1934, 1974, 2003, and 2017.

Additionally, St. Moritz has hosted the FIBT World Championships (bobsleigh and skeleton racing) a record 21 times. Since 1985, it has hosted Snow Polo St. Moritz, a tournament featuring many of the world&#x27;s finest team and played on a specially marked field on the frozen lake.

St. Moritz is extremely popular in the summer months as an altitude training base for distance athletes, particularly cyclists, runners, and race walkers. Its popularity extends to the altitude, weather, world class athletics track, and availability of paths and trails in the area.

In 1904, the oldest and world&#x27;s last remaining natural bob run was opened. The ice channel – also known as the world&#x27;s biggest is built every winter from the ground up with only snow and water. The bob run hosted numerous world championships and was used in both Olympic Winter Games. In the early 1930s, some members of the bob club started taking guests along for taxi rides; today they run with slightly modified racing bobs.

For the 1928 games, the cross-country skiing and the cross-country skiing part of the Nordic combined events took place around the hills of St. Moritz. Twenty years later, once again the cross-country skiing, the cross-country skiing part of the Nordic combined, and the ice hockey events took place in St. Moritz.

In addition to the above sports, St. Moritz is also well known as a destination for sailing. It is the host venue for the annual St. Moritz Match Race held on lake St. Moritz. The St. Moritz Match Race event is part of the prestigious World Match Racing Tour which covers three continents. The identical supplied (BLU-26) boats are raced two at a time in an on the water dogfight which tests the sailors and skippers to the limits of their physical abilities. Points accrued count towards the World Match Racing Tour and a place in the final event, with the overall winner taking the title ISAF World Match Racing Tour Champion.

<text>Devnull is a computer worm for the Linux operating system that was named after , Unix&#x27;s null device. This worm was found on 30 September 2002.

This worm, once the host has been compromised, downloads and executes a shell script from a web server. This script downloads a gzipped executable file named from the same address, and then decompresses and runs the file.

This downloaded file appears to be an IRC client. It connects to different channels and waits for commands to process on the infected host. 

Then the worm checks for presence of the GCC compiler on the local system and, if found, creates a directory called . Next, it downloads a compressed file called . After decompressing, two files are created: an ELF binary file called and a source script file called . The latter gets compiled into the ELF binary .

The executable will scan for vulnerable hosts and use the compiled program to exploit a known OpenSSL vulnerability.

<text>Kraggenburg is a settlement in the Noordoostpolder area of the Netherlands.. The village is situated south east of the regional town Emmeloord.

Kraggenburg was established in 1948. and received her name from a former lighthouse that is named &quot;Oud Kraggenburg&quot;. It belongs to the oldest buildings of the reclaimed land area called Noordoostpolder, see also Schokland.

==19th century Kraggenburg==
In the middle of the 19th century a group of rich trading partners formed a company that built dams into the Zuiderzee to enable ships to reach the town of Zwolle and enhance shipping goods to the province of Overijssel.

To build dams into the water of the Zuiderzee they used so called &#x27;kraggen&#x27;: floating clusters of water plants and sheer. These &#x27;kraggen&#x27; were cheap and could be found in the neighbourhood near villages like Wanneperveen, Dwarsgracht and Giethoorn.

At the end of the western dam a little wooden shed was placed to house the lightkeeper. Those who erected it nicknamed it the Kraggenburght (translated: Kraggenburrow). Which explains the present name of Kraggenburg.

==Kraggenburg after reclaiming land from the sea==
After pumping the polder dry, Kraggenburg and the lands surrounding it were made into an agricultural area with a focus on growing fruits. A large part of the area contained so-called stone clay which makes it virtually impossible to grow anything there. They turned it into a production forest in order to make some profit.

==Future==
Kraggenburg will focus on recreational aspects in the near future. It features a hotel, two group accommodations, three camp sites and a small yacht harbour. The forest accommodates hiking, Nordic walking and such. You can swim, sail, ride bikes and fish in the area.

==Public transportation==

There is no railway station in Kraggenburg, but the nearest stations are in Kampen and Meppel.

<text>, properly called , is training armour used primarily in the Japanese martial art of kendo, with variants used for jūkendō, tankendo, and naginata.

==History==
During the Edo period (1603-1868) the use of real swords for training purposes was discouraged due to injuries, with wooden practice swords in the form of and were often used instead. To further reduce injuries, practice armour based on traditional samurai armor was developed, with this practice armour being the basis for the modern .

==Description and use==
The word consists of two parts: , meaning &quot;protect&quot; or &quot;defend,&quot; and , meaning &quot;equipment&quot; or &quot;tool.&quot; A set of has four components:

* : combined face mask and shoulder protectors (helmet);
* : hand and forearm protectors (gauntlets);
* : torso protector (breastplate);
* : groin and leg protectors (faulds).

A fifth component, (shin protectors, or greaves), are worn by naginatajutsu practitioners.

The protects the face, neck, and shoulders. It consists of a facemask with several horizontal metal bars running the entire width of the face, from the chin to the top of the head. To this is attached a long rectangular thick cloth padding that curves over the top of the head and extends to cover the shoulders. A throat protector is attached to the bottom of the facemask. The is held in place with a pair of woven cords that wrap around the head and are tied at the back. The back of the is left open for ventilation and the back of the head is unprotected. The target areas of the are the centre top, and upper left and right sides for cutting strikes and the centre of the throat protector for a thrust.

The are mitten-like gloves. They were designed expressly for kendo. While appearing to be cumbersome, enough mobility is allowed to grip the in a comfortable, powerful, and firm way. for naginatajutsu practitioners have a singulated index finger and thumb to better facilitate the rapid shifting of the hands along the length of the &#x27;s shaft. have a little less padding than those used for kendo. In the past, were often made with fully articulated fingers. This is rarely seen today as there can be a safety issue with snagged fingers. A special heavily padded design known as are used by some , most notably Itto-ryu. The target area is the wrist portion of each .

The main component of the is the gently-curving stomach and chest protector. The modern form has a pronounced bulge to help direct the force of strikes away from the soft areas in the middle of the torso. Lacquered bamboo is traditionally used although lacquered paper &#x27;fibre&#x27; (frequently misidentified as fiberglass) or moulded plastic are used for less expensive . The is supported from the shoulders by two diagonal ties and is restrained at the small of the back with another set of ties. The target areas of the are the two lower sides for a slashing cut to the stomach. The top half of the is a valid target for a thrust in naginata. In the past, this was also a valid target for a thrust in Kendo.

The is a thick cloth belt that wraps around the waist and ties under the front flap in front of the groin. Sturdy cloth covered flaps hang from the belt to protect the upper legs and groin. The flaps run along half of the belt&#x27;s length, which should be positioned over the front half of the body. The centre flap is usually covered with a name tag— or —that identifies the name of the wearer and the or country they represent. There is no target point on , it is for protection against off-target and accidental strikes.

<text>The secretary of the Air Force, sometimes referred to as the secretary of the Department of the Air Force, (SecAF, or SAF/OS) is the head of the Department of the Air Force and the service secretary for the United States Air Force and United States Space Force. The secretary of the Air Force is a civilian appointed by the president, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The secretary reports to the secretary of defense and/or the deputy secretary of defense, and is by statute responsible for and has the authority to conduct all the affairs of the Department of the Air Force.

The secretary works closely with their civilian deputy, the under secretary of the Air Force; and their military deputies, the chief of staff of the Air Force and the chief of space operations.

The first secretary of the Air Force, Stuart Symington, was sworn in on September 18, 1947, upon the split and re-organization of the Department of War and Army Air Forces into an air military department and a military service of its own, with the enactment of the National Security Act.

On July 26, 2021 the United States Senate confirmed Frank Kendall III as the next secretary of the Air Force. On July 28, 2021, Kendall was sworn in as the 26th secretary of the Air Force.

==Responsibilities==

The secretary is the head of the Department of the Air Force. The Department of the Air Force is defined as a &quot;Military Department&quot;. It is not limited to the Washington headquarters staffs, rather it is an entity which includes all the components of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force, including their reserve components:

The exclusive responsibilities of the secretary of the Air Force are enumerated in of the United States Code. They include, but are not limited to:

By direction of the secretary of defense, the secretary of the Air Force assigns military units of the Air Force and Space Force, other than those who carry out the functions listed in , to the Unified and Specified Combatant Commands to perform missions assigned to those commands. Air Force and Space Force units while assigned to Combatant Commands may only be reassigned by authority of the secretary of defense.

However, the chain of command for Air Force and Space Force units for other purposes than the operational direction goes from the &quot;president&quot; to the &quot;secretary of defense&quot; to the &quot;secretary of the Air Force&quot; to the &quot;commanders of Air Force and Space Force Commands&quot;. Air Force and Space Force officers have to report on any matter to the secretary, or the secretary&#x27;s designate, when requested. The secretary has the authority to detail, prescribe the duties, and to assign Air Force and Space Force service members and civilian employees, and may also change the title of any activity not statutorily designated. The secretary has several responsibilities under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) with respect to Air Force and Space Force service members, including the authority to convene general courts martial and to commute sentences.

The secretary of the Air Force may also be assigned additional responsibilities by the president or the secretary of defense, e.g. the secretary is designated as the &quot;DoD Executive Agent for Space&quot;, and as such:

==Office of the Secretary of the Air Force==

The secretary of the Air Force&#x27;s principal staff element, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, has responsibility for acquisition and auditing, comptroller issues (including financial management), inspector general matters, legislative affairs, and public affairs within the Department of the Air Force. The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force is one of the Department of the Air Force&#x27;s three headquarter staffs at the seat of government, with the others being the Air Staff and the Office of the Chief of Space Operations.

<doc id="305223" wikidata="Q653242" url="?curid=305223" title="QR decomposition">
<text>In linear algebra, a QR decomposition, also known as a QR factorization or QU factorization, is a decomposition of a matrix &quot;A&quot; into a product &quot;A&quot; = &quot;QR&quot; of an orthonormal matrix &quot;Q&quot; and an upper triangular matrix &quot;R&quot;. QR decomposition is often used to solve the linear least squares (LLS) problem and is the basis for a particular eigenvalue algorithm, the QR algorithm.

==Cases and definitions==

===Square matrix===
Any real square matrix &quot;A&quot; may be decomposed as
: formula_1

where &quot;Q&quot; is an orthogonal matrix (its columns are orthogonal unit vectors meaning and &quot;R&quot; is an upper triangular matrix (also called right triangular matrix). If &quot;A&quot; is invertible, then the factorization is unique if we require the diagonal elements of &quot;R&quot; to be positive.

If instead &quot;A&quot; is a complex square matrix, then there is a decomposition &quot;A&quot; = &quot;QR&quot; where &quot;Q&quot; is a unitary matrix (so the conjugate transpose 

If &quot;A&quot; has &quot;n&quot; linearly independent columns, then the first &quot;n&quot; columns of &quot;Q&quot; form an orthonormal basis for the column space of &quot;A&quot;. More generally, the first &quot;k&quot; columns of &quot;Q&quot; form an orthonormal basis for the span of the first &quot;k&quot; columns of &quot;A&quot; for any . The fact that any column &quot;k&quot; of &quot;A&quot; only depends on the first &quot;k&quot; columns of &quot;Q&quot; corresponds to the triangular form of &quot;R&quot;.

===Rectangular matrix===
More generally, we can factor a complex &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot;, with , as the product of an &quot;m&quot;×&quot;m&quot; unitary matrix &quot;Q&quot; and an &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; upper triangular matrix &quot;R&quot;. As the bottom (&quot;m&quot;−&quot;n&quot;) rows of an &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; upper triangular matrix consist entirely of zeroes, it is often useful to partition &quot;R&quot;, or both &quot;R&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;:
:formula_2

where &quot;R&quot;1 is an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; upper triangular matrix, 0 is an zero matrix, &quot;Q&quot;1 is &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;2 is , and &quot;Q&quot;1 and &quot;Q&quot;2 both have orthogonal columns.

 call &quot;Q&quot;1&quot;R&quot;1 the &quot;thin QR factorization&quot; of &quot;A&quot;; Trefethen and Bau call this the &quot;reduced QR factorization&quot;. If &quot;A&quot; is of full rank &quot;n&quot; and we require that the diagonal elements of &quot;R&quot;1 are positive then &quot;R&quot;1 and &quot;Q&quot;1 are unique, but in general &quot;Q&quot;2 is not. &quot;R&quot;1 is then equal to the upper triangular factor of the Cholesky decomposition of &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; (= &quot;A&quot;T&quot;A&quot; if &quot;A&quot; is real).

===QL, RQ and LQ decompositions===
Analogously, we can define QL, RQ, and LQ decompositions, with &quot;L&quot; being a &quot;lower&quot; triangular matrix.

==Computing the QR decomposition==
There are several methods for actually computing the QR decomposition, such as the Gram–Schmidt process, Householder transformations, or Givens rotations. Each has a number of advantages and disadvantages.

===Using the Gram–Schmidt process===

Consider the Gram–Schmidt process applied to the columns of the full column rank matrix with inner product formula_3 (or formula_4 for the complex case).

Define the projection:
:formula_5

then:
:formula_6

We can now express the formula_7s over our newly computed orthonormal basis:
:formula_8

where This can be written in matrix form:
:formula_9

where:
:formula_10

and
:formula_11

====Example====
Consider the decomposition of
: formula_12

Recall that an orthonormal matrix formula_13 has the property 

Then, we can calculate formula_13 by means of Gram–Schmidt as follows:
: formula_15

Thus, we have
: formula_16

====Relation to RQ decomposition====
The RQ decomposition transforms a matrix &quot;A&quot; into the product of an upper triangular matrix &quot;R&quot; (also known as right-triangular) and an orthogonal matrix &quot;Q&quot;. The only difference from QR decomposition is the order of these matrices.

QR decomposition is Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization of columns of &quot;A&quot;, started from the first column.

RQ decomposition is Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization of rows of &quot;A&quot;, started from the last row.

====Advantages and disadvantages====

The Gram-Schmidt process is inherently numerically unstable. While the application of the projections has an appealing geometric analogy to orthogonalization, the orthogonalization itself is prone to numerical error. A significant advantage is the ease of implementation.

===Using Householder reflections===

A Householder reflection (or &quot;Householder transformation&quot;) is a transformation that takes a vector and reflects it about some plane or hyperplane. We can use this operation to calculate the &quot;QR&quot; factorization of an &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix formula_17 with .

&quot;Q&quot; can be used to reflect a vector in such a way that all coordinates but one disappear.

Let formula_18 be an arbitrary real &quot;m&quot;-dimensional column vector of formula_17 such that formula_20 for a scalar &quot;α&quot;. If the algorithm is implemented using floating-point arithmetic, then &quot;α&quot; should get the opposite sign as the &quot;k&quot;-th coordinate of where formula_21 is to be the pivot coordinate after which all entries are 0 in matrix &quot;A&quot;″s final upper triangular form, to avoid loss of significance. In the complex case, set
:formula_22
and substitute transposition by conjugate transposition in the construction of &quot;Q&quot; below.

Then, where formula_23 is the vector , is the Euclidean norm and formula_24 is an identity matrix, set
: formula_25

Or, if formula_17 is complex
: formula_27

formula_13 is an &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;m&quot; Householder matrix, which is both symmetric and orthogonal (Hermitian and unitary in the complex case), and
: formula_29

This can be used to gradually transform an &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; to upper triangular form. First, we multiply &quot;A&quot; with the Householder matrix &quot;Q&quot;1 we obtain when we choose the first matrix column for x. This results in a matrix &quot;Q&quot;1&quot;A&quot; with zeros in the left column (except for the first row).
: formula_30

This can be repeated for &quot;A&quot;′ (obtained from &quot;Q&quot;1&quot;A&quot; by deleting the first row and first column), resulting in a Householder matrix &quot;Q&quot;′2. Note that &quot;Q&quot;′2 is smaller than &quot;Q&quot;1. Since we want it really to operate on &quot;Q&quot;1&quot;A&quot; instead of &quot;A&quot;′ we need to expand it to the upper left, filling in a 1, or in general:
:formula_31

After formula_32 iterations of this process, 
:formula_33

is an upper triangular matrix. So, with
:formula_34

formula_9 is a QR decomposition of formula_17.

This method has greater numerical stability than the Gram–Schmidt method above.

The following table gives the number of operations in the &quot;k&quot;-th step of the QR-decomposition by the Householder transformation, assuming a square matrix with size &quot;n&quot;.
Summing these numbers over the steps (for a square matrix of size &quot;n&quot;), the complexity of the algorithm (in terms of floating point multiplications) is given by
:formula_37

====Example====
Let us calculate the decomposition of
: formula_12

First, we need to find a reflection that transforms the first column of matrix &quot;A&quot;, vector into 

Now,
: formula_39

and
: formula_40

Here,
: formula_41 and formula_42

Therefore
: formula_43 and \begin{bmatrix} -1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2 \end{bmatrix}^\textsf{T}&lt;/math&gt;,}} and then
: formula_44

Now observe:
:formula_45

so we already have almost a triangular matrix. We only need to zero the (3, 2) entry.

Take the (1, 1) minor, and then apply the process again to
:formula_46

By the same method as above, we obtain the matrix of the Householder transformation
:formula_47

after performing a direct sum with 1 to make sure the next step in the process works properly.

Now, we find
:formula_48

Or, to four decimal digits,
:formula_49

The matrix &quot;Q&quot; is orthogonal and &quot;R&quot; is upper triangular, so is the required QR decomposition.

====Advantages and disadvantages====

The use of Householder transformations is inherently the most simple of the numerically stable QR decomposition algorithms due to the use of reflections as the mechanism for producing zeroes in the &quot;R&quot; matrix. However, the Householder reflection algorithm is bandwidth heavy and difficult to parallelize, as every reflection that produces a new zero element changes the entirety of both &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;R&quot; matrices.

====Parallel implementation of Householder QR====

The Householder QR method can be implemented in parallel with algorithms such as the TSQR algorithm (which stands for &quot;Tall Skinny QR&quot;). This algorithm can be applied in the case when the matrix &quot;A&quot; has &quot;m » n&quot;. This algorithm uses a binary reduction tree to compute local householder QR decomposition at each node in the forward pass, and re-constitute the Q matrix in the backward pass. The binary tree structure aims at decreasing the amount of communication between processor to increase performance.

===Using Givens rotations===
QR decompositions can also be computed with a series of Givens rotations. Each rotation zeroes an element in the subdiagonal of the matrix, forming the &quot;R&quot; matrix. The concatenation of all the Givens rotations forms the orthogonal &quot;Q&quot; matrix.

In practice, Givens rotations are not actually performed by building a whole matrix and doing a matrix multiplication. A Givens rotation procedure is used instead which does the equivalent of the sparse Givens matrix multiplication, without the extra work of handling the sparse elements. The Givens rotation procedure is useful in situations where only relatively few off-diagonal elements need to be zeroed, and is more easily parallelized than Householder transformations.

====Example====
Let us calculate the decomposition of
: formula_12

First, we need to form a rotation matrix that will zero the lowermost left element, We form this matrix using the Givens rotation method, and call the matrix formula_51. We will first rotate the vector to point along the &quot;X&quot; axis. This vector has an angle We create the orthogonal Givens rotation matrix, formula_51:

:formula_53

And the result of formula_54 now has a zero in the formula_55 element.
:formula_56

We can similarly form Givens matrices formula_57 and which will zero the sub-diagonal elements formula_58 and forming a triangular matrix The orthogonal matrix formula_59 is formed from the product of all the Givens matrices Thus, we have and the &quot;QR&quot; decomposition is 

====Advantages and disadvantages====

The QR decomposition via Givens rotations is the most involved to implement, as the ordering of the rows required to fully exploit the algorithm is not trivial to determine. However, it has a significant advantage in that each new zero element formula_60 affects only the row with the element to be zeroed (&quot;i&quot;) and a row above (&quot;j&quot;). This makes the Givens rotation algorithm more bandwidth efficient and parallelizable than the Householder reflection technique.

==Connection to a determinant or a product of eigenvalues==
We can use QR decomposition to find the determinant of a square matrix. Suppose a matrix is decomposed as formula_9. Then we have
formula_62

formula_13 can be chosen such that formula_64. Thus,
formula_65

where the formula_66 are the entries on the diagonal of formula_67. Furthermore, because the determinant equals the product of the eigenvalues, we have
formula_68

where the formula_69 are eigenvalues of formula_17.

We can extend the above properties to a non-square complex matrix formula_17 by introducing the definition of QR decomposition for non-square complex matrices and replacing eigenvalues with singular values.

Start with a QR decomposition for a non-square matrix &quot;A&quot;:
: formula_72

where formula_73 denotes the zero matrix and formula_13 is a unitary matrix.

From the properties of the singular value decomposition (SVD) and the determinant of a matrix, we have
:formula_75

where the formula_76 are the singular values of 

Note that the singular values of formula_17 and formula_67 are identical, although their complex eigenvalues may be different. However, if &quot;A&quot; is square, then
:formula_79

It follows that the QR decomposition can be used to efficiently calculate the product of the eigenvalues or singular values of a matrix.

==Column pivoting==
Pivoted QR differs from ordinary Gram-Schmidt in that it takes the largest remaining column at the beginning of each new step—column pivoting— and thus introduces a permutation matrix &quot;P&quot;:
:formula_80

Column pivoting is useful when &quot;A&quot; is (nearly) rank deficient, or is suspected of being so. It can also improve numerical accuracy. &quot;P&quot; is usually chosen so that the diagonal elements of &quot;R&quot; are non-increasing: formula_81. This can be used to find the (numerical) rank of &quot;A&quot; at lower computational cost than a singular value decomposition, forming the basis of so-called rank-revealing QR algorithms.

==Using for solution to linear inverse problems==
Compared to the direct matrix inverse, inverse solutions using QR decomposition are more numerically stable as evidenced by their reduced condition numbers.

To solve the underdetermined linear problem formula_82 where the matrix formula_17 has dimensions formula_84 and rank first find the QR factorization of the transpose of where &quot;Q&quot; is an orthogonal matrix (i.e. and &quot;R&quot; has a special form: formula_85. Here formula_86 is a square formula_87 right triangular matrix, and the zero matrix has dimension After some algebra, it can be shown that a solution to the inverse problem can be expressed as: formula_88 where one may either find formula_89 by Gaussian elimination or compute formula_90 directly by forward substitution. The latter technique enjoys greater numerical accuracy and lower computations.

To find a solution formula_91 to the overdetermined problem formula_82 which minimizes the norm - \mathbf{b}\right\|&lt;/math&gt;,}} first find the QR factorization of The solution can then be expressed as where formula_93 is an formula_84 matrix containing the first formula_95 columns of the full orthonormal basis formula_13 and where formula_86 is as before. Equivalent to the underdetermined case, back substitution can be used to quickly and accurately find this formula_98 without explicitly inverting (formula_93 and formula_86 are often provided by numerical libraries as an &quot;economic&quot; QR decomposition.)

==Generalizations==
Iwasawa decomposition generalizes QR decomposition to semi-simple Lie groups.

<text>Quality assurance (QA) is the term used in both manufacturing and service industries to describe the systematic efforts taken to assure that the product(s) delivered to customer(s) meet with the contractual and other agreed upon performance, design, reliability, and maintainability expectations of that customer. The core purpose of Quality Assurance is to prevent mistakes and defects in the development and production of both manufactured products, such as automobiles and shoes, and delivered services, such as automotive repair and athletic shoe design. Assuring quality and therefore avoiding problems and delays when delivering products or services to customers is what ISO 9000 defines as that &quot;part of quality management focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled&quot;. This defect prevention aspect of quality assurance differs from the defect detection aspect of quality control and has been referred to as a &quot;shift left&quot; since it focuses on quality efforts earlier in product development and production (i.e., a shift to the left of a linear process diagram reading left to right) and on avoiding defects in the first place rather than correcting them after the fact.

The terms &quot;quality assurance&quot; and &quot;quality control&quot; are often used interchangeably to refer to ways of ensuring the quality of a service or product. For instance, the term &quot;assurance&quot; is often used in a context such as: &quot;Implementation of inspection and structured testing as a measure of quality assurance in a television set software project at Philips Semiconductors is described.&quot; where &quot;inspection and structured testing&quot; are the measurement phase of a quality assurance strategy referred to as the DMAIC model (define, measure, analyze, improve, control). DMAIC is a data-driven quality strategy used to &quot;improve&quot; processes. The term &quot;control&quot; is the fifth phase of this strategy.

Quality assurance comprises administrative and procedural activities implemented in a quality system so that requirements and goals for a product, service or activity will be accomplished. It is the systematic measurement, comparison with a standard, and monitoring of processes in an associated feedback loop that confers error prevention. This can be contrasted with quality control, which is focused on process output.

Quality assurance includes two principles: &quot;fit for purpose&quot; (the product should be suitable for the intended purpose); and &quot;right first time&quot; (mistakes should be eliminated). QA includes management of the quality of raw materials, assemblies, products and components, services related to production, and management, production and inspection processes. The two principles also manifest before the background of developing (engineering) a novel technical product: The task of engineering is to make it work once, while the task of quality assurance is to make it work all the time.

Historically, defining what suitable product or service quality means has been a more difficult process, determined in many ways, from the subjective user-based approach that contains &quot;the different weights that individuals normally attach to quality characteristics,&quot; to the value-based approach which finds consumers linking quality to price and making overall conclusions of quality based on such a relationship.

== History ==
=== Initial efforts to control the quality of production ===
During the Middle Ages, guilds adopted responsibility for the quality of goods and services offered by their members, setting and maintaining certain standards for guild membership.

Royal governments purchasing material were interested in quality control as customers. For this reason, King John of England appointed William de Wrotham to report about the construction and repair of ships. Centuries later, Samuel Pepys, Secretary to the British Admiralty, appointed multiple such overseers to standardize sea rations and naval training.

Prior to the extensive division of labor and mechanization resulting from the Industrial Revolution, it was possible for workers to control the quality of their own products. The Industrial Revolution led to a system in which large groups of people performing a specialized type of work were grouped together under the supervision of a foreman who was appointed to control the quality of work manufactured.

=== Wartime production ===
During the time of the First World War, manufacturing processes typically became more complex, with larger numbers of workers being supervised. This period saw the widespread introduction of mass production and piece work, which created problems as workmen could now earn more money by the production of extra products, which in turn occasionally led to poor quality workmanship being passed on to the assembly lines. Pioneers such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford recognized the limitations of the methods being used in mass production at the time and the subsequent varying quality of output. Taylor, utilizing the concept of scientific management, helped separate production tasks into many simple steps (the assembly line) and limited quality control to a few specific individuals, limiting complexity. Ford emphasized standardization of design and component standards to ensure a standard product was produced, while quality was the responsibility of machine inspectors, &quot;placed in each department to cover all operations ... at frequent intervals, so that no faulty operation shall proceed for any great length of time.&quot;

Out of this also came statistical process control (SPC), which was pioneered by Walter A. Shewhart at Bell Laboratories in the early 1920s. Shewhart developed the control chart in 1924 and the concept of a state of statistical control. Statistical control is equivalent to the concept of exchangeability developed by logician William Ernest Johnson, also in 1924, in his book &quot;Logic, Part III: The Logical Foundations of Science&quot;. Along with a team at AT&amp;T that included Harold Dodge and Harry Romig, he worked to put sampling inspection on a rational statistical basis as well. Shewhart consulted with Colonel Leslie E. Simon in the application of control charts to munitions manufacture at the Army&#x27;s Picatinny Arsenal in 1934. That successful application helped convince Army Ordnance to engage AT&amp;T&#x27;s George Edwards to consult on the use of statistical quality control among its divisions and contractors at the outbreak of World War II.

=== Postwar ===
After World War II, many countries&#x27; manufacturing capabilities that had been destroyed during the war were rebuilt. General Douglas MacArthur oversaw the rebuilding of Japan. He involved two key people in the development of modern quality concepts: W. Edwards Deming and Joseph Juran. They and others promoted the collaborative concepts of quality to Japanese business and technical groups, and these groups used these concepts in the redevelopment of the Japanese economy.

Although there were many people trying to lead United States industries toward a more comprehensive approach to quality, the US continued to apply the Quality Control (QC) concepts of inspection and sampling to remove defective products from production lines, essentially unaware of or ignoring advances in QA for decades.

== Approaches ==
=== Failure testing ===
It is valuable to failure test or stress test a complete consumer product. In mechanical terms this is the operation of a product until it fails, often under stresses such as increasing vibration, temperature, and humidity. This may expose many unanticipated weaknesses in the product, and the data is used to drive engineering and manufacturing process improvements. Often quite simple changes can dramatically improve product service, such as changing to mold-resistant paint or adding lock-washer placement to the training for new assembly personnel.

=== Statistical control ===
Statistical control is based on analyses of objective and subjective data. Many organizations use statistical process control as a tool in any quality improvement effort to track quality data. Product quality data is statistically charted to distinguish between common cause variation or special cause variation.

Walter Shewart of Bell Telephone Laboratories recognized that when a product is made, data can be taken from scrutinized areas of a sample lot of the part and statistical variances are then analyzed and charted. Control can then be implemented on the part in the form of rework or scrap, or control can be implemented on the process that made the part, ideally eliminating the defect before more parts can be made like it.

=== Total quality management ===
The quality of products is dependent upon that of the participating constituents, some of which are sustainable and effectively controlled while others are not. The process(es) which are managed with QA pertain to Total quality management.

If the specification does not reflect the true quality requirements, the product&#x27;s quality cannot be guaranteed. For instance, the parameters for a pressure vessel should cover not only the material and dimensions but operating, environmental, safety, reliability and maintainability requirements.

=== Models and standards ===
ISO 17025 is an international standard that specifies the general requirements for the competence to carry out tests and or calibrations. There are 15 management requirements and 10 technical requirements. These requirements outline what a laboratory must do to become accredited.
Management system refers to the organization&#x27;s structure for managing its processes or activities that transform inputs of resources into a product or service which meets
the organization&#x27;s objectives, such as satisfying the customer&#x27;s quality requirements, complying with regulations, or meeting environmental objectives. WHO has developed several tools and offers training courses for quality assurance in public health laboratories.

The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) model is widely used to implement Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA) in an organization. The CMMI maturity levels can be divided into 5 steps, which a company can achieve by performing specific activities within the organization.

=== Company quality ===
During the 1980s, the concept of &quot;company quality&quot; with the focus on management and people came to the fore in the U.S. It was considered that, if all departments approached quality with an open mind, success was possible if management led the quality improvement process.

The company-wide quality approach places an emphasis on four aspects (enshrined in standards such as ISO 9001):

# Elements such as controls, job management, adequate processes, performance and integrity criteria, and identification of records
# Competence such as knowledge, skills, experiences, qualifications
# Soft elements, such as personnel integrity, confidence, organizational culture, motivation, team spirit and quality relationships
# Infrastructure (as it enhances or limits functionality)

The quality of the outputs is at risk if any of these aspects is deficient.

The importance of actually measuring Quality Culture throughout the organization is illustrated by a survey that was done by &quot;Forbes Insights&quot; in partnership with the American Society for Quality. 75% of senior or C-suite titles believed that their organization exhibits &quot;a comprehensive, group-wide culture of quality.&quot; But agreement with that response dropped to less than half among those with quality job titles. In other words, the further from the C-suite, the less favorable the view of the culture of quality. A survey of more than 60 multinational companies found that those companies whose employees rated as having a low quality culture had increased costs of $67 million/year for every 5000 employees compared to those rated as having a high quality culture.

QA is not limited to manufacturing, and can be applied to any business or non-business activity, including: design, consulting, banking, insurance, computer software development, retailing, investment, transportation, education, and translation.

It comprises a quality improvement process, which is generic in the sense that it can be applied to any of these activities and it establishes a quality culture, which supports the achievement of quality.

This in turn is supported by quality management practices which can include a number of business systems and which are usually specific to the activities of the business unit concerned.

In manufacturing and construction activities, these business practices can be equated to the models for quality assurance defined by the International Standards contained in the ISO 9000 series and the specified specifications for quality systems.

In the system of Company Quality, the work being carried out was shop floor inspection which did not reveal the major quality problems. This led to quality assurance or total quality control, which has come into being recently.

== In practice ==

=== Medical industry ===

QA is very important in the medical field because it helps to identify the standards of medical equipment and services. Hospitals and laboratories make use of external agencies in order to ensure standards for equipment such as X-ray machines, Diagnostic Radiology and AERB. QA is particularly applicable throughout the development and introduction of new medicines and medical devices. The Research Quality Association (RQA) supports and promotes the quality of research in life sciences, through its members and regulatory bodies.

=== Aerospace industry ===

The term product assurance (PA) is often used instead of quality assurance and is, alongside project management and engineering, one of the three primary project functions. Quality assurance is seen as one part of product assurance. Due to the sometimes catastrophic consequences a single failure can have for human lives, the environment, a device, or a mission, product assurance plays a particularly important role here. It has organizational, budgetary and product developmental independence meaning that it reports to highest management only, has its own budget, and does not expend labor to help build a product. Product assurance stands on an equal footing with project management but embraces the customer&#x27;s point of view.

=== Software development ===
Software quality assurance refers to monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used to ensure quality. Various methods or frameworks are employed for this, such as ensuring conformance to one or more standards, e.g. ISO 25010 (which supersede ISO/IEC 9126) or process models such as CMMI, or SPICE. In addition, enterprise quality management software is used to correct issues such as supply chain disaggregation and to ensure regulatory compliance; these are vital for medical device manufacturers.

=== Using contractors or consultants ===

Consultants and contractors are sometimes employed when introducing new quality practices and methods, particularly where the relevant skills and expertise and resources are not available within the organization. Consultants and contractors will often employ Quality Management Systems (QMS), auditing and procedural documentation writing CMMI, Six Sigma, Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA), Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Advance Product Quality Planning (APQP).

<text>Manganese dioxide is the inorganic compound with the formula . This blackish or brown solid occurs naturally as the mineral pyrolusite, which is the main ore of manganese and a component of manganese nodules. The principal use for is for dry-cell batteries, such as the alkaline battery and the zinc–carbon battery, although it is also used for other battery chemistries such as aqueous zinc-ion batteries. is also used as a pigment and as a precursor to other manganese compounds, such as . It is used as a reagent in organic synthesis, for example, for the oxidation of allylic alcohols. has an α-polymorph that can incorporate a variety of atoms (as well as water molecules) in the &quot;tunnels&quot; or &quot;channels&quot; between the manganese oxide octahedra. There is considerable interest in as a possible cathode for lithium-ion batteries.

==Structure==
Several polymorphs of are claimed, as well as a hydrated form. Like many other dioxides, crystallizes in the rutile crystal structure (this polymorph is called pyrolusite or ), with three-coordinate oxide anions and octahedral metal centres. is characteristically nonstoichiometric, being deficient in oxygen. The complicated solid-state chemistry of this material is relevant to the lore of &quot;freshly prepared&quot; in organic synthesis. The α-polymorph of has a very open structure with &quot;channels&quot;, which can accommodate metal ions such as silver or barium. is often called hollandite, after a closely related mineral. Two other polymorphs, Todorokite and Romanechite , have a similar structure to but with larger channels. exhibits a layered structure more akin to that of graphite.

==Production==
Naturally occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities and a considerable amount of manganese(III) oxide. Production of batteries and ferrite (two of the primary uses of manganese dioxide) requires high purity manganese dioxide. Batteries require &quot;electrolytic manganese dioxide&quot; while ferrites require &quot;chemical manganese dioxide&quot;.

===Chemical manganese dioxide===
One method starts with natural manganese dioxide and converts it using dinitrogen tetroxide and water to a manganese(II) nitrate solution. Evaporation of the water leaves the crystalline nitrate salt. At temperatures of 400 °C, the salt decomposes, releasing and leaving a residue of purified manganese dioxide. These two steps can be summarized as:

In another process, manganese dioxide is carbothermically reduced to manganese(II) oxide which is dissolved in sulfuric acid. The filtered solution is treated with ammonium carbonate to precipitate . The carbonate is calcined in air to give a mixture of manganese(II) and manganese(IV) oxides. To complete the process, a suspension of this material in sulfuric acid is treated with sodium chlorate. Chloric acid, which forms in situ, converts any Mn(III) and Mn(II) oxides to the dioxide, releasing chlorine as a by-product.

Lastly, the action of potassium permanganate over manganese sulfate crystals produces the desired oxide.
:2 + 3 + 2 → 5 + + 2 

===Electrolytic manganese dioxide===
Electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) is used in zinc–carbon batteries together with zinc chloride and ammonium chloride. EMD is commonly used in zinc manganese dioxide rechargeable alkaline (Zn RAM) cells also. For these applications, purity is extremely important. EMD is produced in a similar fashion as electrolytic tough pitch (ETP) copper: The manganese dioxide is dissolved in sulfuric acid (sometimes mixed with manganese sulfate) and subjected to a current between two electrodes. The MnO2 dissolves, enters solution as the sulfate, and is deposited on the anode.

==Reactions==
The important reactions of are associated with its redox, both oxidation and reduction.

===Reduction===
 is the principal precursor to ferromanganese and related alloys, which are widely used in the steel industry. The conversions involve carbothermal reduction using coke:
: + 2 C → Mn + 2 CO

The key redox reactions of in batteries is the one-electron reduction:
: + e− + → MnO(OH)

 catalyses several reactions that form . In a classical laboratory demonstration, heating a mixture of potassium chlorate and manganese dioxide produces oxygen gas. Manganese dioxide also catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water:
:2 → 2 + 

Manganese dioxide decomposes above about 530 °C to manganese(III) oxide and oxygen. At temperatures close to 1000 °C, the mixed-valence compound forms. Higher temperatures give MnO, which is reduced only with difficulty.

Hot concentrated sulfuric acid reduces to manganese(II) sulfate:
:2 + 2 → 2 + + 2 
The reaction of hydrogen chloride with was used by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in the original isolation of chlorine gas in 1774:
: + 4 HCl → + + 2 
As a source of hydrogen chloride, Scheele treated sodium chloride with concentrated sulfuric acid.
::&quot;E&quot;o ((s) + 4  + 2 e− Mn2+ + 2 ) = +1.23 V
::&quot;E&quot;o ((g) + 2 e− 2 Cl−) = +1.36 V
The reaction would not be expected to proceed, based on the standard electrode potentials, but is favoured by the extremely high acidity and the evolution (and removal) of gaseous chlorine.

This reaction is also a convenient way to remove the manganese dioxide precipitate from the ground glass joints after running a reaction (for example, an oxidation with potassium permanganate).

===Oxidation===
Heating a mixture of KOH and in air gives green potassium manganate:
:2 + 4 KOH + → 2 + 2 
Potassium manganate is the precursor to potassium permanganate, a common oxidant.

==Occurrence and applications==
=== Prehistory ===
Excavations at the Pech-de-l&#x27;Azé cave site in southwestern France have yielded blocks of manganese dioxide writing tools, which date back 50,000 years and have been attributed to Neanderthals . Scientists have conjectured that Neanderthals used this mineral for body decoration, but there are many other readily available minerals that are more suitable for that purpose. Heyes et al. (in 2016) determined that the manganese dioxide lowers the combustion temperatures for wood from above 350°C (662°F) to 250°C (482°F), making fire making much easier and this is likely to be the purpose of the blocks.

===Batteries===
The predominant application of is as a component of dry cell batteries: alkaline batteries and so called Leclanché cell, or zinc–carbon batteries. Approximately 500,000 tonnes are consumed for this application annually. 

δ- has also been researched as the primary cathode material for aqueous zinc-ion battery systems. Such cathodes often contain additives to address structural, kinetic, and conductivity-based issues. These carbon additives can include reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanotubes, among others. 

===Organic synthesis===
A specialized use of manganese dioxide is as oxidant in organic synthesis. The effectiveness of the reagent depends on the method of preparation, a problem that is typical for other heterogeneous reagents where surface area, among other variables, is a significant factor. The mineral pyrolusite makes a poor reagent. Usually, however, the reagent is generated in situ by treatment of an aqueous solution with a Mn(II) salt, typically the sulfate. oxidizes allylic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones:

::cis-RCH= + → cis-RCH=CHCHO + MnO + 

The configuration of the double bond is conserved in the reaction. The corresponding acetylenic alcohols are also suitable substrates, although the resulting propargylic aldehydes can be quite reactive. Benzylic and even unactivated alcohols are also good substrates. 1,2-Diols are cleaved by to dialdehydes or diketones. Otherwise, the applications of are numerous, being applicable to many kinds of reactions including amine oxidation, aromatization, oxidative coupling, and thiol oxidation.

===Other potential applications===
In &quot;Geobacteraceae&quot; sp., MnO2 functions as an electron acceptor coupled to the oxidation of organic compounds. This theme has possible implications for bioremediation within the field of microbiology.

 is used as an inorganic pigment in ceramics and in glassmaking.

<text>The River Tone is a river in the English county of Somerset. The river is about long. Its source is at Beverton Pond near Huish Champflower in the Brendon Hills, and is dammed at Clatworthy Reservoir. The reservoir outfall continues through Taunton and Curry and Hay Moors, which are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Finally, it flows into the River Parrett at Burrowbridge.
An act of Parliament granted in 1699, the  (10 Will. 3. c. 8) authorised work that made the river navigable as far as Taunton. The act specified that profits should be used to benefit the poor of Taunton, but the proprietors succeeded in avoiding their obligation until 1843, when they used the proceeds from the sale of the navigation to fund a wing of the Taunton and Somerset Hospital, and to aid the Taunton Market Trust.

The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal opened in 1827, which provided an easier route than the river, and protracted legal battles followed over ownership of the river and water rights for the canal. These were not finally resolved until 1832, when the canal company formally took over the river navigation. The ability to navigate the river gradually deteriorated, not helped by the abandonment of the River Parrett as a navigation in 1878. Following flooding in Taunton in 1960, much of the river between there and its mouth was straightened, and the navigation locks were removed. That at Ham was blown up by the Territorial Army. Navigation rights were repealed in 1967.

== Course ==

The river is about long. Its source is at Beverton Pond. Over its first it follows a south-easterly course and drops around before discharging into Clatworthy Reservoir, which also impounds the waters of 5 other streams.

The river continues as the outflow from the main dam of the reservoir, passing to the west of the village of Clatworthy before following a southerly course which passes to the east of Huish Champflower. The river enters a steeply wooded section at Washbattle bridge. The B3227 road from Wiveliscombe crosses from the east to the west side of the valley at Waterrow bridge. By the time it reaches Stawley bridge and turns south-east, it has lost another and is just above sea level. At Greenham, the river turns to run generally north-east. The river passes to the north of Wellington, and a mile further on the course of the derelict Grand Western Canal crosses the Tone on an aqueduct which now carries a footpath.

The river passes over weirs at Greenham, Tone and Nynehead, after which it is crossed by the Bristol and Exeter Railway. A disused bridge, constructed in 1817, spans the river at Nynehead. The river turns to the north-east near Bradford on Tone, with its two listed bridges, including the Bradford Bridge which was originally built by the 15th century, and then to the east near Upcott bridge, where there were two mills. At Roughmoor its course is crossed by Silk Mills Road. There is a scheme to make the river navigable from here to the town centre as a way of encouraging transport with less environmental impact.
The French weir in Taunton is the head of navigation as boats can not be taken upstream of this point. As it makes its way through the town centre to Firepool weir and the junction with the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, it passes under the North Bridge, which was constructed in 1895, and Priory Bridge Road. Firepool weir was reconstructed in 1967 as part of the plans to straighten the river through the town centre and down to Bathpool in order to provide better flood defences. These works swept away the remains of the original navigation. Firepool Pumping Station was built the 1840s, on the site of medieval lime kilns, and later adapted for use as a pumping station supplying water to the steam trains of the Bristol and Exeter Railway. 

The Brewhouse Theatre &amp; Arts Centre, is close to the riverside., as is the County Ground, home of Somerset County Cricket Club. Next comes the A358 Obridge viaduct, the A38 Bathpool Bridge and the M5 motorway bridge. There is a disused five-arched railway bridge built in 1863 at Creech St Michael. Nearby is the aqueduct that carried the Chard Canal over the river from 1842 until 1866. Ham weir stands as a reminder of the location of the lock there. After Knapp bridge, the sluice at Newbridge marks the upper tidal limit of the river. Curry and Hay Moors, an area of low-lying fenland close to the river, are a Site of Special Scientific Interest. A railway bridge carries the Taunton to Castle Cary railway line over the river, after which is the Curry Moor pumping station. Two more road bridges at Athelney and Stanmoor cross the river before it joins the River Parrett at Burrowbridge, where the junction is overshadowed by Burrow Mump.

== Geography and geology ==

The catchment area of the river is approximately and the average daily flow for the entire catchment is estimated to be . Water from tributaries such as Hillfarrance Brook, Halse Water, Haywards Water, Three Bridges Stream, Sherford Stream and Broughton Brook feed the river but are supplemented by controlled releases from Clatworthy and Luxhay Reservoirs during dry periods. The tributaries flowing into the Tone from the south bring water from the Blackdown Hills.

The rivers source is in the Brendon Hills which fall within the Exmoor National Park. The hills are quite heavily cultivated unlike their neighbouring upland areas of Exmoor and the Quantock Hills. The Brendon Hills are largely formed from the Morte Slates, a thick faulted and folded sequence of Devonian age sedimentary rocks. It then flows through an alluvial floodplain underlain by sub-alluvial gravels, underlain by rocks of the Mercia Mudstone Group. The floodplain is between and above the ordnance datum (mean sea level). The surrounding land is dominated by wet meadow and wooded areas including willow trees.

Water quality in the river can be affected by dredging work.

== Hydrology and water quality ==

The Environment Agency is responsible for monitoring water quality on the river and its tributaries, which have been divided into seventeen separate water bodies. In 2013, seven water bodies were assessed as having good quality and ten as being moderate. The reasons for not achieving good status included pollution from waste water, pollution from agriculture and physical modifications. The physical modifications include dredging work on the lower reaches, near the junction with the Parrett to increase the channel flow to reduce flooding. The use and storage of the dredged material in bank restoration may also have an impact. In 1998 improvements were sought to treatment works and surface water outfalls to improve water quality. A vegetable washing plant on the Chelston stream at Wellington was also identified as a source of pollution. The waters of the Upper Tone have been classified as having good ecological status, whereas the section from Wellington to Taunton and downstream of Taunton are rated as moderate.

Water quality of the River Tone in 2019:

Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

There are three monitoring stations on the river tracking the water levels. At Greenham the normal level of the river in average weather conditions is between and with the highest recorded being on 7 December 2000. At Bishops Hull the normal range is to and the high on 30 October 2000. At Taunton market the normal range is to with a high of on 24 December 2013.

The flow in two tributaries and two points on the river is also monitored, primarily to act as an early flood warning system for Taunton. On Halsewater the mean flow is while at Milverton on the Hillfarrance Brook it is and at Greenham on the river itself it is . At Clatworthy Reservoir near the source the flow rate is .

== History ==

The river has a long history of improvements to facilitate navigation from Bridgwater to Taunton, and has also been used to power mills along its length. These two objectives are often antagonistic, and this has been the case on the River Tone.

The earliest known record of improvements to the river is recorded in a document of 1325 from the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral, where it was proposed to widen the river between Ham Mill and a new mill which was to be built at Knapp. The Dean and Chapter owned the river as far as Athelney weir, which was presumably a fish weir, as the river was an important source of fish for the local population. Records from 1494 record the intent to build a new mill at North Curry, which was operational in 1504, and caused flooding in 1505, resulting in the Bishop of Winchester having to complain to the Dean and Chapter of Wells. There is also mention of boats using the river at this time, as their use was restricted by the construction of the new mill at Ham.

=== River improvements ===
Navigation on the first from Burrowbridge to Ham Mill was much easier than on the final stretch to Taunton, and in 1638, John Mallett, the Sheriff of Somerset and member of parliament for Bath, obtained a Commission under the Great Seal from King Charles II. This granted him and his heirs sole navigation rights from Bridgwater to Ham Mills, and allowed him to improve the river at his own expense. He saw this as a philanthropic action, as it reduced the price of coal to the poor people of Taunton, as well as improving the transport infrastructure.

With the death of Mallett and later his son, work on the maintenance of the river ceased, and its condition declined. By 1697, trade was threatened, and a group of 34 merchants and traders petitioned parliament for powers to take over the navigation. The River Tone Navigation Act 1698 (10 Will. 3. c. 8), dated 24 March 1699, created the &quot;Conservators of the River Tone&quot;, giving them powers &quot;for making and keeping the River Tone navigable from Bridgewater to Taunton, in the county of Somerset&quot;, which included the purchase of the navigation rights from Bridgwater to Ham Mills from the Mallett estate, for which a price of £330 was agreed.
The conservators applied for a second act of parliament, the , as they needed a further £3,800 to finance projects including the building of a half-lock and the removal of a shoal just below Knapp Bridge. Boats carrying 15 tons of cargo could reach Taunton by 1717. The navigation included a lock and two or more half-locks, consisting of a pair of gates to hold back the water, and an agreement to build a towpath between Ham Mills and Taunton was reached in 1724.

The number of locks on the navigation varied over the years, and by 1804 there were four full or pound locks, situated at Ham, Creech St Michael, Bathpool and Obridge. In addition, there were at least four half locks. Curry Moor gates were the lowest on the river, which were followed by a second half lock further upstream, just below Newbridge. A third gate was located below Ham lock, and the fourth one was just below the lock at Bathpool.

=== Profits ===

The 1699 act of parliament had stipulated that the Conservators could receive dividends of six per cent on the money they had invested into the undertaking, until the capital was repaid, and that after that the tolls were to be reduced, while profits were to be used for &quot;the benefit and advantage of the poor of Taunton&quot;, particularly by the building of hospitals. Local landowners complained about rights of access across their land and increased flooding in a petition of 1707, however in 1708 another act was passed to allow the completion of the navigation to Taunton.

Because the receipts were initially insufficient to cover the six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. This state of affairs was challenged in 1735, when it was decreed that the original capital had been repaid, and the poor should now benefit, but the decision was overturned in 1738 on appeal.
Profits for the undertaking showed a steady rise, due in part to the low maintenance costs of the river. Income from tolls rose from £321 in 1712 to £1,137 by 1802. By this time, traffic consisted of about 11,500 tons of coal carried from Bridgwater upstream out of a total tonnage of 14,000 tons. Dividends for 1797 were 11.5%, but the capital debt had risen to £85,466 by 1800, when the auditors refused to examine the accounts, because the likelihood of the poor ever benefitting from the navigation was receding. After much negotiation, the capital debt was reduced to £13,000. The (44 Geo. 3. c. lxxxiii) enshrined this position, and ensured that interest was limited to six percent, with profits being used to reduce the debt. By 1828, the amount owing had reduced to £4,426.

=== Canal Company Takeover ===

The building of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, which opened in 1827, directly affected the River Tone Navigation, as it provided a more direct route between Taunton and Bridgwater. The Conservators attempted to limit the supply of water from the river to the canal, while the canal company breached the river bank near Firepool lock, in order to ensure that boats could reach Taunton Bridge wharf from the canal. In order to compete with the canal, they chose to reduce the tolls, although they were unsure of the legality of this action while they had outstanding debts. The canal company challenged their right to reduce the tolls in court, but the action was defeated, and the tolls remained at the lower level.

On 28 August 1827, the canal company announced that they were taking over the River Tone Navigation, under the terms of their acts of parliament of 1811 and 1824. This they did in November, when William Goodland, the river superintendent, was evicted from his cottage, the tolls were raised again, and maintenance ceased. This action was ruled to be illegal by the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, as the canal company had not complied with the time limits enshrined in the act, but the canal company held on to the river despite the order to give it back to the conservators. Both sides took their case to the High Court, which ruled that the Conservators should have the river in February 1830. A further series of legal actions followed, after which the canal company attempted to obtain a new act of parliament to obtain the Tone by compulsory purchase. The Conservators then decided to negotiate, and an act of parliament passed in July 1832 authorised the takeover.

Under the terms of the act, the canal company inherited the debts of the Conservators, and paid them an additional £2,000. They were required to rebuild part of the North Town Bridge in Taunton, and to return the Tone Navigation to good order. The Conservators were empowered to carry out an annual inspection, and to re-possess the river if the canal was not properly maintained. The £2,000 was held by the Conservators until 1838, when they applied for an order to dispose of it, but it was not until 1843 that the order was granted. £1,000 was used to build a new wing for the Taunton and Somerset Hospital, and £1,000 was invested in the Taunton Market Trust, in line with the intentions of the 1699 act.

=== Decline ===

Traffic on the river in 1823 was 39,516 tons, which generated tolls of £2,194. After the construction of the canal, traffic steadily declined, until income was insufficient to cover maintenance by the early 1860s. The canal company used a similar accounting practice to manage the Tone debt, inflating it at six per cent each year, to ensure that they could demonstrate that the river was unprofitable.

Navigation was further affected by the passing of the Somersetshire Drainage Act 1878 on 1 July 1878, which resulted in the River Parrett being taken over by the drainage commissioners, and abandoned as a navigation. Limited traffic continued to use the lower reaches of the Tone, with the last barge using the Burrowbridge to Ham Mills section in 1929. In 1967 the Somerset River Authority applied to the Ministry of Agriculture for permission to remove the navigation rights, and the original acts of Parliament were repealed under section 41 of the Land Drainage Act 1930. This allowed the river through Taunton to be straightened, and a weir to be constructed at Firepool, to improve the flood defences for Taunton. Above the weir, the river is still navigable as far as French Weir.

=== Watermills ===
Ham Mills was a site of milling activity from mediaeval times until about 1914. The mill was situated on an island in the middle of the river, with a weir and bypass channel to the north and the lock channel to the south. The Conservators were required to light the area after a boatman fell into the river and drowned while attempting to use the lock after dark in March 1826. The coroner who instructed that the lighting should be installed noted that &quot;boats were passing at all hours of the night.&quot; Water levels in the river fell as more water was extracted further upstream, and by the 1890s the waterwheels were assisted by a steam-driven turbine which the miller installed. Milling ceased in 1914, when the boiler which supplied the steam was removed by the War Department, so that it could be fitted into a minesweeper. A surviving mill house which dates from the early 19th century has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.

There had been a mill at Bathpool for several centuries, which had been rebuilt or adapted as required. In March 1812, the structure was burnt down by a fire, caused, according to the &quot;Taunton Courier&quot;, by &quot;the excessive friction excited in the stones used in the process of shelling clover seeds&quot;. Stocks of flour, grain and flax valued at £2,500 were destroyed. The mill was rebuilt and later owned by Captain George Beadon. The mill was purchased by Thomas Redler in 1889 on the death of Beadon, but another fire damaged much of it two years later. Redler rebuilt it with safety in mind, and as at Ham, installed a steam-driven turbine as water levels were often inadequate to power the wheels. Two more turbines followed, and the water wheels were removed. Steam from the turbines was also used to heat bread ovens, which were amongst the first in the country to be heated in this way. In September 1915, another fire gutted the building, which was not rebuilt, and the ruins were demolished in the 1920s.

There were originally mills at Firepool and Obridge as well. Because of the difficulties of navigating past the mill pools, the Conservators of the River Tone decided to buy the mill at Firepool in December 1793 with a view to demolishing it &quot;for the benefit of the navigation&quot;, and they obtained it for just £32. In 1797, they decided to follow the same course with Obridge Mill. The mill at Creech St Michael was the subject of a court action at the King&#x27;s Bench. In October 1830, while replacing the mill stones, the millers had opened the flood gates for 16 days, and built a dam across the river, thus preventing navigation. The case was heard in 1831, and the judgement was that both parties were obligated to use the water in a way that did not cause injury to the other party.

== Flood defences ==

The first Curry Moor pumping station was built in 1864, to house a steam engine and pump. A cottage for the operator was built next to it at the same time. This installation lasted until 1955, when a new pumphouse was constructed to house two diesel pumps. The steam engine was retained for historical reasons, and is located in part of the new building. The diesel pumps were supplemented by an electric pump in 1983, and a programme of refurbishment was carried out in 2008, which included the construction of a new outfall into the river.

In 1951, very heavy rainfall resulted in large portions of the Tone valley below Taunton flooding. Analysis of what had happened indicated that the channel was of insufficient size to carry the volume of water, which fell on the hills to the west and then flowed down the river. The easy solution of widening the channel was not available, as there were houses built along the south-eastern bank for around above the junction with the River Parrett. The flooding revealed that although these properties were not normally affected by floods, there was significant seepage through the banks. There was no likelihood of sufficient money being available to buy all the houses to demolish them, and so a program of constructing concrete cores in the centre of the banks began in 1956 and continued until 1964.

Rainfall in October 1960 was even heavier, when fell on the Somerset Levels, representing 249% of the normal levels. Again the valley flooded, and large areas of Taunton were under water to a depth of . Plans for a flood relief channel centred at first on the Bridgwater to Taunton Canal, which follows a slightly higher course to the west, and does not run through peat, but the estimated cost of £1.7 million was prohibitive, and so a scheme to upgrade the river costing around one third of that was implemented. This involved straightening of the river where it meandered, widening the bridge openings, and the demolition of navigation locks and weirs.

A new sluice was constructed at Newbridge, incorporating tidal gates, which effectively prevent tides from passing further up the river. The removal of the navigation works at Ham proved particularly difficult, and acted as a training exercise for the Territorial Royal Engineers. Men from the &quot;205 (Wessex) Field Squadron RE (TA)&quot; used of explosives to blow up the half-lock and a mud-filled barge which could not be moved. The river banks were raised to give more protection to the villages of Creech St Michael, Ham and Ruishton, but the channel was still only capable of discharging , whereas the channels through Taunton were designed to handle , and were unlikely to overflow until discharges reached . Curry Moor is therefore used as a washland, and excess water floods over it, to be pumped out at a later date by the Curry Moor pumping station, situated on the banks of the river below the railway bridge. The programme began in 1965 and was completed in 1967.

During the winter flooding of 2013–14 on the Somerset Levels, the River Tone overflowed at new year, during the rain and storms from Storm Dirk, with many residents asking for the Environment Agency to resume river dredging. On 24 January 2014, in light of the continued flooded extent of the Somerset Moors and forecast new rainfall as part of the winter storms of 2013–14 in the United Kingdom, both Somerset County Council and Sedgemoor District Council declared a major incident, as defined under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. As a result of the extensive flooding dredging work was carried out. In addition plans were developed for a flood storage area or &quot;Superpond&quot; with a capacity of , on the Tone at Taunton. Studies of the potential impact on the hydromorphology were carried out.





==Ecology==

Clatworthy Reservoir is an important wildlife habitat managed by Wessex Water, and offers facilities for fishing and walking. The river and its tributaries support populations of European water vole (&quot;Arvicola amphibius&quot;). There may also be populations of white-clawed crayfish (&quot;Austropotamobius pallipes&quot;) and northern crested newts (&quot;Triturus cristatus&quot;). The fish species in the river include: chub, carp, grayling, roach, tench, rudd, perch and pike.

Curry and Hay Moors is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest adjacent to the Tone. This part of the Somerset Levels and Moors is low-lying and flooding from the River Tone occurs in winter each year. The soil is Altcar series peats over which the river has lain alluvial clays. The range of flora and fauna which this soil and the ditches and rhyne support has led to its designation as an SSSI. Frogbit (&quot;Hydrocharis morsus-ranae&quot;), flowering rush (&quot;Butomus umbellatus&quot;), wood club-rush (&quot;Scirpus sylvaticus&quot;) and lesser water-plantain (&quot;Baldellia ranunculoides&quot;) are among the aquatic and bankside vascular plants which have been identified. The nationally rare soldier fly, (&quot;Odontomyia ornata&quot;) and nationally scarce species including the water beetles &quot;Agabus uliginosus&quot;, &quot;Hydaticus transversalis&quot; and &quot;Helophorus nanus&quot; are among the aquatic invertebrates living in the ditches. Significant numbers of waterfowl with several thousand northern lapwing, hundreds of snipe and some golden plover and dunlin can be found on the flooded fields in winter. The site is also of international importance for Bewick&#x27;s swans. Raptor species such as Short-eared owls, merlins and peregrines are among raptors which use the site as a hunting ground in winter. Barred grass snake and common frogs along with Otters have been identified on the moor.

Southlake Moor is another biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, this one covering near the junction of the Tone and Parrett at Burrow Mump and Burrowbridge. Southlake Moor is another SSSI. The marshes and ditches provide grazing. At certain times of the year sluice gates can be opended to flood the moor. Greater water-parsnip (&quot;Sium latifolium&quot;) is among the 96 aquatic and vascular plant species on the moor. Numerous wildfowl visit the flooded moor; up to 22,000 wigeon (&quot;Anas penelope&quot;), 250 Bewick&#x27;s swan (&quot;Cygnus bewickii&quot;) and significant populations of pochard (&quot;Aythya ferina&quot;), teal (&quot;Anas crecca&quot;) and tufted duck (&quot;Aythya fuligula&quot;). Signs of European otters (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;) have also been seen on the river banks. Palmate newts (&quot;Triturus helveticus&quot;) have been found in surrounding ditches.

<text>The River Stour is an English river that rises in the county of Oxfordshire and largely flows through Warwickshire. It is a tributary of the Avon, which it joins just south west of Stratford-upon-Avon. It gives its name to the town of Shipston-on-Stour.

The source of the River Stour is a spring near Highways Farm, just south of Swalcliffe. Some to the west, it crosses the Oxfordshire/Warwickshire border near Traitor&#x27;s Ford. The first settlement that the river flows through is the village of Stourton. The River Stour then turns to the north and passes through the town of Shipston-on-Stour. The A3400 road roughly follows the course of the river to Stratford-upon-Avon, through the villages of Tredington Halford, Alderminster, Newbold-on-Stour, Atherstone-on-Stour and Clifford Chambers.

<text>The River Leam () is a river in England which rises at Hellidon Hill in Northamptonshire then flows through Warwickshire, including the town of Leamington Spa, named after it. It then flows into the River Avon near Warwick, which flows into the River Severn.

==Toponymy==
The name is first recorded in 956 as &quot;Limenan&quot;, and derives from British &quot;Lemanā&quot;, meaning &quot;elm-tree river&quot;.

== Tributaries ==
Its major tributaries are Rains Brook, River Itchen, River Stowe and Radford Brook.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measures the water quality of the river systems in England.

<doc id="305233" wikidata="Q261603" url="?curid=305233" title="River Arun">
<text>The River Arun () is a river in the English county of West Sussex. At long, it is the longest river entirely in Sussex and one of the longest starting in Sussex after the River Medway, River Wey and River Mole. From the series of small streams that form its source in the area of St Leonard&#x27;s Forest in the Weald, the Arun flows westwards through Horsham to Nowhurst where it is joined by the North River. Turning to the south, it is joined by its main tributary, the western River Rother, and continues through a gap in the South Downs to Arundel to join the English Channel at Littlehampton. It is one of the faster flowing rivers in England, and is tidal as far inland as Pallingham Quay, upstream from the sea at Littlehampton. The Arun gives its name to the Arun local government district of West Sussex.

The first major improvements to the river were made between the 1540s and the 1570s, when Arundel became a port, and navigation up to Pallingham was improved, but barges had difficulty negotiating the flash locks that were installed. The work was carried out by Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel, who made the upper section toll-free. Harbour commissioners managed the lower river from Arundel to the sea from 1732, and major improvements to keep the estuary free from silt were sanctioned by an act of Parliament obtained in 1793. With the coming of the railways and changes in coastal shipping, Littlehampton superseded Arundel as the port of the Arun, and the Littlehampton harbour commissioners are still responsible for the river up to Arundel, collecting tolls for its use.

The river above Arundel was improved after 1785. As the main channel was toll-free, the proprietors of the scheme built two major cuts. One, which included three locks and passed through Hardham Tunnel, was built to avoid a large bend near Pulborough. The other was near the upper terminus, where a cut with three locks and a flood lock crossed the original channel by an aqueduct to reach wharves at Newbridge. Further improvements were made when the Wey and Arun Canal opened in 1816, joining the Arun Navigation at Newbridge, and after the completion of the Portsmouth and Arundel Canal, which opened soon afterwards. These two canals were an attempt to provide an inland route between London and Portsmouth, but were not as successful as the proprietors hoped. Traffic declined rapidly when the railways offered competition, and the navigation ceased to be maintained from 1888, though some traffic continued on the lower sections. The Wey and Arun Canal is currently being restored, and restoration will eventually include the cut and locks below Newbridge.

==History==
When Ptolemy wrote his &quot;Geography&quot; around 150 AD, the Arun was called the &quot;Trisantonis&quot;, with later accounts using the same name. Trisantonis is thought to be a Brythonic word for &#x27;the trespasser&#x27;, indicating the river&#x27;s tendency to flood land near to the river. &quot;Trisanto&quot; translates directly as &#x27;one who goes across&#x27;. There is also a theory that the Arun may have been known as the &quot;Trisantonis&quot; in its lower reaches close to the sea, but known as the &quot;Arnus&quot; (from the Brythonic &#x27;Arno&#x27; meaning run, go, or flow) in its upper reaches. It is possible that the town of Arundel may mean Arno-dell, or dell of the flowing river. By the Middle Ages the river was known as the river of Arundel, the Arundel river, or the high stream of Arundel. An alternative name, the Tarrant (derived from &quot;Trisantona&quot;), is, however, attested in 725 and 1270, and is reflected in the road name Tarrant Street, one of the main roads running through the town roughly parallel to the river. The first use of the modern name was recorded in 1577, but the alternative names of Arundel river or great river continued to be used for many years.

A further possible etymology derived from the Domesday spelling &quot;Harundel&quot; for Arundel comes from the Anglo Saxon &quot;hærn dell&quot; meaning &quot;tidal valley&quot;, which this would mean that the name of the river probably also derives from &quot;tidal&quot;. Other local rivers such as the Rother deriving from the Anglo Saxon &quot;róðer&quot;, which means &quot;rower&quot; (as in a long river), are also descriptive of the river and its surrounds.

The mouth of the river has not always been at Littlehampton. Until the later fifteenth century it joined the River Adur at Lancing some ten miles to the east before entering the sea. This estuary became blocked with shingle by the eastward drift of the tides, pushing the Adur towards Shoreham-by-Sea, while the Arun broke out at Worthing, Goring and Ferring at various times, until it formed its present estuary at Littlehampton between 1500 and 1530.

===Improvements===
The lower portion of the river, from the sea to Ford, was navigable in the eleventh century at the time of the Norman conquest. In the sixteenth century, Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel built wharves at Ford, and improved the river channel below there, so that the town became a port. Over the 30 years from 1544, he also improved the river as far upstream as Pallingham Quay. Although the work involved a number of flash locks, which were not very successful, no tolls were charged for its use, and vessels of around 15 tons were used to carry timber. Attempts to make the river navigable up to Newbridge in the early sixteenth century were not successful.

An act of Parliament was obtained in 1732, the main emphasis of which was the improvement of &quot;the harbour of Littlehampton, called Arundel Port&quot;, but improvements to the first of the river, from the sea to Arundel, were also authorised. Commissioners were appointed, with powers to erect piers and to cut a new channel to the sea through a sand bar. The act allowed them to charge tolls for use of the facilities, and once the initial costs had been repaid, one half of the tolls were to be used to maintain the harbour and the river channel up to Arundel. Although most ships were of 30 or 40 tons, ships of up to 100 tons could reach Arundel as a result of the work, and trade improved.
The next act, the (25 Geo. 3 c. 100) to affect the river was obtained by a group of local men in 1785. Under the act, the proprietors were empowered to make the river navigable for 30-ton barges up to Newbridge. They had no jurisdiction over the river from Arundel to Houghton bridge, and could not charge tolls for use of the river up to Pallingham. There were 31 members of the proprietors, who could raise £10,000 by issuing 100 shares worth £100 each. Day-to-day oversight of the affairs of the navigation were managed by three proprietors, with a half-yearly meeting of the larger group. The purpose of the navigation was to carry coal, chalk and lime upstream, and agricultural produce in the other direction. Rather than improve the river channel, the navigation upstream of Pallingham consisted of a separate channel, containing three locks, and an aqueduct which carried the navigation over the river at Orfold. The journey below Pallingham was made shorter by cutting a new channel between Coldwaltham and Hardham. This involved the construction of three more locks and a tunnel. The Pallingham to Newbridge section opened on 1 August 1787, while the Hardham cut was completed in mid-1790. The cost of the work was around £16,000.

There were two proposals to extend the navigation at this time. The first was for a canal to North Chapel, to the north of Petworth, in 1791, and the second was for a canal to Horsham in the following year. The route was surveyed by John Rennie, who estimated that it would cost £18,133 to build, but negotiations with the existing proprietors failed, and the scheme was dropped in 1794. Meanwhile, a second act of Parliament was obtained by the harbour commissioners in 1793, as there was serious silting of the estuary. Groynes were constructed and the existing piers were made longer. In addition, a towpath was built from the mouth of the river up to Arundel. The act stated that the capital borrowed to finance the harbour under the previous act had been repaid, and that tolls would all be used for maintenance of the harbour and river up to Arundel, once further borrowings had been repaid. Because the inhabitants of Arundel had spent £28,300 on the harbour, boats which belonged to the port of Arundel did not have to pay any tolls. As a result of the works, the port of Arundel enjoyed its most prosperous period for the next thirty years, with ships of 200 and 300 tons able to reach the town on spring tides. Facilities improved, and there were four docks by 1840.

===Operation===

Payment of dividends to shareholders began in 1792, and over the next five years, tolls raised an average of £893 per year and the dividend was 3.1 per cent. At this time, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont was buying shares and having obtained one third of them, he became chairman of the company. He then stopped the payment of dividends so that the borrowed capital could be paid off more quickly. Apart from an interim payment in 1821, dividends were not reinstated until 1830. In the 1790s Wyndham was responsible for the canalisation of the River Rother which joins the Arun at Stopham, and he also promoted the Wey and Arun Canal, which was seen as part of a larger scheme to link London to Portsmouth, an idea which had been contemplated several times since 1641. He chaired a meeting held at Guildford on 1 June 1811, at which it was decided to press ahead with the canal, and put up £20,000 of the initial £90,500 estimated cost. The canal opened in September 1816, but the estimated 100,000 tons of traffic passing between London and the dockyards at Portsmouth, and the 30,000 tons of local traffic, were far too optimistic, with actual traffic averaging around 15,000 tons per year throughout its life.

The London to Portsmouth route was to be completed by the Portsmouth and Arundel Canal, in which Wyndham and the Cutfields, who also held many shares in the Arun Navigation, were both significant subscribers. This was authorised by act of Parliament in 1817, and an agreement was reached that the Arun would be improved to aid through traffic. Nevertheless, no work commenced on the Arun until the proprietors were sure that the Ford section of the new canal would actually be built. Once they were convinced, they obtained an act of Parliament in May 1821, and the engineer James Hollingworth oversaw the improvements, which were completed in mid-1823. The work involved improving the depth and width of the channel, and some alterations to bridges and locks to make their size more uniform. The company borrowed £3000 to finance the work, which cost around £5000 in total. The loans had been repaid by 1831, and the work allowed barge sizes to be increased from 30 tons to 40 tons, with the result that business improved.

Traffic increased, as shown by the number of boats belonging to residents of Arundel. There were 13 in 1801, which had increased to 15 by 1803, with a total tonnage of 266. A timber merchant called John Boxold owned barges in 1815 and 1832, while in 1820, a company began running regular freight services to London, using three barges based near the town quay. By 1823 they had ten barges, which had reduced to seven by 1830, and barges ran twice-weekly to Chichester, London, Midhurst, and Petworth. The company was variously called Seward and Co., The Arundel Barge Co., and several other names.

===Decline===
From the 1840s, use of the river declined, as a result of competition from the railways, and changes in coastal shipping. Littlehampton grew in importance as a port and after years of resistance by the people of Arundel, the customs house was moved there in 1864. The Mid-Sussex Railway opened their line from Horsham to Pulborough and Petworth in 1859, which was extended to Ford and Littlehampton in 1863. Receipts from tolls had peaked at £2044 for the five years from 1835 to 1840, when a dividend of 11.8 percent was paid, but dropped quickly, raising just £389 for years between 1870 and 1875, when the dividend was 1 percent.

By 1852, the barge service to London only ran once a week, and it had ceased altogether three years later. Most vessels reaching Arundel were coasters rather than barges by 1886, and just 20 ships used the facilities that year. The Wey and Arun Canal closed in 1871. The proprietors of the upper river ceased to maintain the navigation from 1 January 1888, and the last barge passed through Hardham Tunnel on 29 January 1889. The river was abandoned as a navigation by a warrant issued as part of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1888. The River Lark in Suffolk was the only other river navigation abandoned at that time. The Board of Trade issued a closing order in 1896, and after that, there was no navigation authority responsible for the upper river. However, traffic did not cease entirely.

Fifteen or twenty barges were still using the river in the 1880s, although the upper reaches were no longer accessible. Arundel docks silted up between 1875 and 1896. In 1898, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, who by this time were the owners of the railway from Horsham to Littlehampton, drilled down into the tunnel where the main line and the branch to Midhurst crossed its course, and poured tons of chalk into the tunnel to stabilise it. A trade in chalk and lime extracted from Amberley chalk pits continued into the early twentieth century. Some ships were towed to Arundel by paddle tugs, and imports of salt, timber and coal for the gasworks continued. Arundel was visited by its last steamer in 1914, and the last sailing vessel to reach the port did so three years later. Passage of larger craft upstream was hindered by the construction of a swing bridge at Littlehampton in 1908, and prevented by a fixed railway bridge at Ford built in 1938. As freight traffic disappeared from the river, Edward Slaughter, who later became part of the company of Buller and Slaughter, was hiring pleasure craft by 1903, and the company was still doing so in the 1990s.

===Present===
Authority for the river remains much as it was after 1896, with the Littlehampton Harbour Board responsible for the section from the mouth up to Arundel Bridge, and no navigation authority for the river above that, although the Environment Agency have responsibility for its drainage functions. There are nine bridges with a minimum navigable headroom of between and at high water. The river is tidal to Pallingham Quay, upstream from the sea at Littlehampton, and flows at , making it one of the fastest flowing rivers in the country. The tidal range at Littlehampton is at spring tides and at neap tides. High tide occurs 15 minutes later than high water at Dover, and high water at Pulborough is four hours later than at Littlehampton.

===Charitable organisations===
The &quot;Arun &amp; Rother Rivers Trust&quot; (ARRT) is a charity set up in 2011 with objectives around education, fisheries, biodiversity, access and pollution amongst other issues.

The Wey and Arun Canal is being restored by the &quot;Wey and Arun Canal Trust&quot;, which was set up in the 1970s. The Wey and Arun Canal technically ended at Newbridge, but the restoration will include the Arun Navigation section down to Pallingham to reach the River Arun. For many years, the Solent and Arun Branch of the Inland Waterways Association organised an annual cruise on the river to ensure that the navigation rights were maintained. Responsibility for its organisation has now been passed to the Wey and Arun Canal Trust.

==Route==
At from its source to the sea, the Arun is the longest of the rivers flowing entirely within Sussex. It rises as a series of streams, known locally as &quot;ghylls&quot; or &quot;gills&quot;, to the east of Horsham, in St Leonard&#x27;s Forest. It flows westwards, along the southern boundary of Horsham and turns briefly to the north to skirt Broadbridge Heath. Continuing westwards, it is joined at Nowhurst by the North River, with its headstreams in the heights of Leith Hill and Holmbury Hill in Surrey. and whose feeder streams include the River Oke, Holden Brook and Standon Brook. After the junction, the Arun passes under the A29 road, which follows the route of the Roman Stane Street at this point, and timber piles of a Roman bridge have been found in the riverbed. The earthworks from a Roman station are close by. To the south of Rudgwick it is crossed by a disused railway line, and at this point it crosses the contour. Its course is marked by winding meanders as it turns towards the south, and the county boundary briefly follows its course, the River Lox / Loxwood Stream joins the Arun at Drungewick just before it is joined by the partially restored Wey and Arun Canal. Its former course to the west of the canal can be clearly seen, and is followed by the boundary, but the main flow of the river follows a new straight cut just to the east of the canal. Once the boundary crosses back over the canal, the river resumes its meandering course on the eastern side of the canal.

A little further to the south is another straight cut, with the old course still visible on the other side of the canal. Soon it reaches Newbridge on the A272 road near Wisborough Green. The location of the wharf which was the northern terminus of the Arun Navigation was just to the south of the bridge. Wharf Farm was nearby, and the modern 1:2500 Ordnance Survey map shows buildings named &quot;The Old Wharf&quot;. Brockhurst Brook joins from the east before the river turns briefly westwards. Soon it is crossed by Orfold Aqueduct, which carried the Arun Navigation over the river channel. The River Kird joins it, flowing from the north, and it turns southwards again. At Pallingham the remains of Pallingham Manor are on the north bank, next to Pallingham Manor Farm, a 17th-century timber-framed farmhouse, which is Grade II listed. Pallingham Quay Farmhouse, another Grade II listed building dating from the 18th century, is on the west bank of the river just before its junction with the Arun Navigation cut. Below the junction, the river is tidal.

Continuing southwards, the river passes the gallops which are part of Coombelands Racing Stables, situated on the eastern bank, and Park Mount, a motte and bailey dating from the time of the Norman conquest. It is one of the best-preserved monuments of this type in south east England. The river is crossed by Stopham Bridge, a fine medieval stone bridge built in 1422–23. The centre arch was raised as part of the improvements made to the navigation in 1822. It is a Grade I listed structure, and also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It was damaged by army lorries in the Second World War, but has been repaired, and the heavy traffic on the A283 road was diverted onto a new bridge just upstream of it in the 1980s.

Below the bridge is a small island, after which an artificial cut built to avoid the circuitous route of the River Rother Navigation heads westwards. The river now discharges over a weir at the site of the former Hardham corn mill to join the Arun a little further downstream, and the junction is followed by another small island. Hardham lock was necessary because of the drop in levels caused by the mill, and the branch through Hardham tunnel headed due south a little further up the Rother. Exploration of the tunnel was described by an article in &quot;Sussex County Magazine&quot; in 1953, when both ends were accessible, and again in 2012, when only the southern end was explored. A waterworks has been built over the bed of the canal at the northern end, and the tunnel mouth is within the site. The river continues in a large loop to the east. The Arun Valley railway line crosses it to reach Pulborough railway station. There is another island, with the A29 road crossing both channels. Pulborough Brooks nature reserve is to the east of the loop, and the course then meanders westwards to Greatham Bridge. The bridge consists of eight low elliptical arches, two taller arches, a cast iron span over the navigable channel, and a solid ramp to the east. Although its construction suggests that it is medieval, most of the arches were erected in 1827.

On the west bank of the river below the bridge is Waltham Brooks nature reserve. Coldwaltham lock, on the branch through the Hardham Tunnel, is still marked on modern maps, and the section from the lock to the river still holds water. Just to the north of Amberley, the river is crossed by the Arun Valley line again at Timberley Bridge. At the village of Bury, the West Sussex Literary Trail joins the western bank and another footpath joins the eastern bank. The next bridge is Houghton Bridge, close to Amberley railway station. The river splits into two channels here, and the bridge spans both. Similar to Greatham Bridge, it looks medieval, but was built in 1875. There is a solid section on the island between the channels, with a single arch over the eastern channel and four arches over the main river. The chalk pits which provided trade to the navigation are now the location of Amberley Museum &amp; Heritage Centre, a site with many items of industrial heritage on display.

The river follows an S-shaped course, the northern loop encircling the village of North Stoke and the south one encircling South Stoke. Immediately to the south, the old course passes under the railway line, but a new channel was cut to the west of the railway. On the west bank is the hamlet of Offham and Arundel Wetland Centre, a haven for birds which is run by the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust. The market town of Arundel is to the west of the river. It has a castle build on a motte, the construction of which was started in 1068. It is owned by the Duke and Duchess of Norfolk. The present building consists of many different components, dating from the late eleventh century through to the nineteenth, and is Grade I listed. Two bridges span the river here, the first on the original road through the town, while the second carries the A284 Arundel Bypass. The final section is crossed by a railway bridge, built in 1908, and the A259 road bridge, which carries the road into Littlehampton on the east bank. It discharges into the English Channel between the East and West Piers.

Littlehampton and its harbour were guarded from naval attack by Littlehampton Redoubt on the western bank at the mouth of the river, completed in 1854, which is now screened from the open sea by Climping sand dunes. This fort replaced a seven-gun battery on the east bank, which was built in 1764.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Arun system was as follows in 2019.
The reasons for the quality being less than good include sewage discharge affecting most of the river, physical modification of the channel, and run-off of nutrients from agriculture and land management. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>The Adur ( or ) is a river in Sussex, England; it gives its name to the Adur district of West Sussex. The river, which is long, was once navigable for large vessels up as far as Steyning, where there was a large Saxon port, but by the 11th century the lower river became silted up and the port moved down to the deeper waters at the mouth of the river in Shoreham-by-Sea.

==Course of river==
The Adur begins as two separate branches, the western Adur and the eastern Adur, which meet west of Henfield.

The western Adur rises at Slinfold, from where it flows around Coolham and then through Shipley, where Hammer Pond and Lancing Brook join it on the right bank. On the left bank, it is joined by the outflow of Knepphill Pond, which forms part of the Knepp Castle pleasure grounds laid out by John Nash in 1806–13. He designed the present castellated mansion known as Knepp Castle for Sir Charles Merrick Burrell, but the grounds include the remains of an 11th-century castle, known by the same name, which was demolished in 1726. The pond was constructed as a hammer pond for the iron industry in the 16th century by the Duke of Norfolk. At Bay Bridge it is crossed by the A24 road, is joined by another tributary on the left bank, and flows on to West Grinstead, passing through the remains of a lock. It is joined by Blakes Gill just above Hatterell Bridge, where it passes through a large weir structure. There are the remains of another lock at Lock Bridge, Partridge Green, and Honeybridge Stream joins it on the right bank. Near Bines Green, Bines Bridge carries the B2135 road over the river, and the river is tidal below this point. Soon afterwards, it joins the eastern Adur near Henfield.

The eastern Adur rises at Ditchling Common, in East Sussex, from where it crosses into West Sussex and passes between Haywards Heath to the north and Burgess Hill to the south. It is crossed by the Brighton Main Line to the north of Wivelsfield railway station, the A273 road and the A23 road at Rice Bridge. To the west of Twineham () the Herrings Stream joins on the left bank. At Shermanbury, the eastern Adur is fed by the Cowfold Stream. The normal tidal limit is just below this at the footbridge near Shermanbury Church. The tidal section is crossed by the A281 road at Mock Bridge, and by the Downs Link, a long-distance footpath which follows the track of two railways, at Betley Bridge. Below Betley Bridge, a public towpath runs along the left bank of the river. There is a weir just above the confluence with the Western Adur, which means that only the highest tides reach Shermanbury. Up to the early 1800s boats could navigate to Mock Bridge, where the A281 crosses the Adur.

The combined flow continues southwards, to a footbridge near Eatons Farm, below which there is a towpath on both sides of the river. Bineham Bridge carries another footpath over the river, and the river then enters Henfield Levels, an important wetland site which supports large populations of birds. A former railway bridge carries the Downs Link over the river at Stretham Manor. There are a number of salterns to the east of the river, which were on the floodplain before the river was embanked in the post-medieval period. The land was periodically flooded by incoming tides, and water trapped in pools was then evaporated to extract salt. The industry operated from Anglo-Saxon times until the early 17th century, when it was unable to compete with sources of rock salt, mined in other parts of the country. Many of the middens were levelled in the 1960s, as the land was used for agriculture, but two important groups remain: one to the west of the river near Bramber, and the other to the east of the river near Upper Beeding. They are scheduled monuments, and those to the east are on land originally owned by Sele Priory, while those to the west were given to Durford Abbey around 1160, by William de Braose, who owned Bramber Castle.

Beeding Bridge carries a minor road from Upper Beeding to Bramber over the river, while a little further south, the A283 Steyning By-pass crosses. A footbridge carries the Downs Link over the river, as the former railway bridge near Coombes has been demolished. The river continues through a gap in the South Downs near Lancing College where the Adur is fed by the Ladywell Stream, and is then crossed by the A27 Shoreham By-pass. Further downstream is Old Shoreham Bridge, a Grade II* listed structure originally built in 1791. It is long, with 27 spans, and although it was largely reconstructed in the early 20th century, it is still of great interest, because it is probably the only one of its type which still exists. The towpaths end at Old Shoreham Bridge, and the river becomes part of Shoreham Harbour. The West Coastway Line railway bridge and the A259 Norfolk Bridge cross the river before it turns to the east, to flow parallel to the English Channel at Shoreham-by-Sea. A new swing footbridge was constructed in 2013, linking Shoreham to Shoreham Beach. Replacing a previous structure which was beyond economic repair, it cost £10 million and was opened by the Duke of Gloucester. It was named the Adur Ferry Bridge after a public vote was held. The river enters the English Channel at Shoreham. The mouth of the Adur is now two miles (3 km) from the town centre of Shoreham due to longshore drift. Previously, the river mouth was further east, in Portslade, but an opening to the sea was made which allowed the creation of Southwick Ship Canal.

The Baybridge Canal uses part of the Adur&#x27;s watercourse.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Adur&quot; is a relatively recent (probably 1612s) invention, based on the name of the Roman fort Portus Adurni which was mistakenly believed to be at Shoreham. The river had previously been known as the &quot;Bramber&quot;, and was also recorded as the &quot;Sore&quot; in the sixteenth century, the latter probably a back-formation by William Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Description of England&quot; (1577) from Shoreham (often &quot;Sorham&quot; in early sources).

A further possible translation derived from the Anglo Saxon &quot;ǣdr&quot; meaning &quot;vein or artery&quot;. Other local rivers such as the &quot;Rother&quot; deriving from the Anglo Saxon &quot;rōðer&quot; which means Rower (as in a long river) and the &quot;Arun&quot; derived from &quot;hærn&quot; meaning &quot;tidal&quot; also appear to describe the river and its surrounds.

==History==
From Norman times the county of Sussex was divided into sections known as &quot;rapes&quot;. Each rape was typically centred on a river and river port and was guarded by a castle. Bramber rape was centred on the port of Bramber and the river Adur, with Bramber Castle located close to the river. At various times in the medieval period, Bramber, Steyning and New Shoreham were all major ports on the river. The western Adur also flows close to Knepp Castle, near Shipley.

The river has a long history of use for navigation, and Shoreham is known to have been used as a port since Roman times. During the Middle Ages, it was especially active, as it was the location of a Royal Arsenal, and later became a centre for ship building. During the 11th and 12th centuries, the river was tidal as far upstream as Bramber Bridge, and Bramber was a busy port. When Defoe visited in the 1720s, he noted that Shoreham was a seafaring town, with many of the inhabitants being ship&#x27;s carpenters, chandlers or otherwise involved in trades connected with shipbuilding. At the time, the hinterland was able to supply large quantities of cheap timber, and although larger ships could not navigate up the river, it was used to float large rafts of timber from Bramber, Steyning and beyond down to the ship yards. This trade gradually declined as the forests were felled.
One problem that the shipbuilders faced was the blocking of the mouth of the river with shingle, which was moved along the coast by the tides. Harbour Commissioners were appointed in 1760 to resolve the issue, and two attempts to create a new mouth were made, but neither was particularly successful. However, in 1816 a new channel was cut through the shingle, and the original course of the river became the Southwick Ship Canal as development work took place over the next forty years. Water levels in the canal are maintained by locks at its entrance.

Following the success of improvements to a number of rivers along the south coast, an Act of Parliament was obtained on 13 August 1807 to allow the river to be improved up to Bines Bridge on the western Adur and to Mock Bridge on the eastern Adur. The Act also authorised the drainage of the lowland levels above Breeding Bridge to be improved. Seventy-nine trustees were appointed by the Act to carry out the work, assisted by the Commissioners of Sewers for the Rape of Bramber. Finance for the scheme would come from rates levied on owners of land which would benefit from the new drainage scheme. The river channel was dredged, the banks were raised, and a towpath was constructed. The river was to be made suitable for barges drawing of water, and tolls for the use of the river as specified by the Act were very low, but the work was completed, and a navigable depth of was achieved.

A further extension to the navigable river was made in 1825, when seven promoters raised £5,250 and obtained an Act of Parliament to construct the Baybridge Canal, although in practice they widened the river channel and straightened out a few of the bends, rather than constructing a separate channel. The canal ran from Bines Bridge to Baybridge at West Grinstead, and included two pound locks, each with a rise of . Although the 1807 Act had not authorised the construction of any locks, at some point three flash locks were constructed, one on the eastern Adur at Betley Lock, just above the junction with the western Adur, and two on the western branch.

The river was never a commercial success. Tolls in 1812 amounted to £523, but then declined fairly quickly, and were only £258 in 1839. The Brighton Railway arrived in the area in 1861, when a branch from Shoreham to Horsham was constructed, which was in direct competition to the river. The Adur trustees could no longer afford to repay their loans from 1865, while the Baybridge Canal was virtually unused from 1861, and officially closed on 1 September 1875. Some traffic continued to use the Adur, and in 1905 a tug with barges conveyed 12,989 tons of material from Shoreham to a cement works at Beeding. This trade continued until 1929.

The lower reaches of the river, from its mouth to Old Shoreham Bridge, are managed by the Port of Shoreham Harbour Office. Above the bridge, the river is the responsibility of the Environment Agency. There is a Common Law right of navigation up to Shermanbury; small boats can reach there on the eastern branch, and can also reach the lower lock of the Baybridge Canal at Partridge Green on the western branch. Careful timing is required, as the river drains down to a narrow channel at low tide, and Beeding Bridge has extremely limited headroom on spring tides.

==Railway engine==
The South Eastern and Chatham Railway named one of their K class 2-6-4T tank engines no. A791 (later no. 1791 and 31791) &quot;River Adur&quot; after this river.

<text>Xinzo de Limia is a town and municipality in the province of Ourense, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain. It belongs to the comarca of A Limia. It lies on the important Autovia das Rias Baixas in the fertile valley of Antela, approximately 33 km from Verín and 43 km from Ourense. The Límia (Lima in Portuguese) river passes through the town on its way south towards the Portuguese border.

Xinzo is a town of services and an important stopping point on the main Vigo-Madrid highway. There are several small industries, including a glass factory, and many pig, cow and dairy farms in the surrounding area. The drained lakebed of Antela, once Spain&#x27;s largest freshwater lake until the 1950s, produces cereals, hay, and especially potatoes. Xinzo is in fact one of Spain&#x27;s largest producers of potatoes.

There is a legend connected to Xinzo. Several classical authors of antiquity reproduce the myth of the loss of memory connected to crossing the Límia River, referred by them as Lethes or Oblivionis (compare the river Lethe of Greek mythology). In 138 BC the Roman chieftain Decimus Junius Brutus put an end to the myth told by the Galicians when, on crossing the river, he began to call each one of his legionnaires by their names from the opposite bank. That historical fact has been now represented in an historical party called Festa do Esquecemento. Seeing the Límia today it is difficult to imagine this tiny river provoking such a fear.

Xinzo has few monuments but is famous for hosting one of Galicia&#x27;s most typical carnivals. The characteristic figure is the &quot;pantalla&quot;, which symbolizes the devil. The &quot;pantalla&quot; is the guardian of the carnival, and runs through the streets in groups of two or three with two swollen pig bladders in the hands making huge noise. If the pantallas finds a male relative or neighbour of Xinzo de Limia not dressed with carnival clothes, they will take him into a bar, to pay the fee for not been dressed properly, which is a glass of wine.

<doc id="305241" wikidata="Q216846" url="?curid=305241" title="Geysir">
<text>Geysir (), sometimes known as The Great Geysir, is a geyser in south-western Iceland, that geological studies suggest started forming about 1150 CE. The English word &quot;&quot; (a periodically spouting hot spring) derives from Geysir. The name &quot;Geysir&quot; itself is derived from the Icelandic verb &quot;&quot; (&quot;to go quickly forward&quot;). Geysir lies in the Haukadalur valley on the slopes of Laugarfjall lava dome, which is also the home to Strokkur geyser about to the south. The Strokkur geyser may be confused with it, and the geothermal field it is in is known usually as either, Geysir or Haukadalur.

Eruptions at Geysir can typically hurl boiling water up to in the air. However, eruptions are nowadays infrequent, and have in the past stopped altogether for many years at a time.

==History==
A geyser at the general site is described in a written source by Saxo Grammaticus, as a mention in Gesta Danorum, his work finished about 1206 which was printed in 1514 as Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae. However the oldest definitive accounts of the hot springs at Haukadalur in their present form, date back to 1294, in the chronicle “Oddaverjaannáll”, when earthquakes in the area caused significant changes in local neighbouring landscape, creating several new hot springs. Changes in the activity of Geysir and the surrounding geysers are strongly related to earthquake activity. In records dated 1630, the geysers erupted so violently that the valley around them trembled. The name &quot;Geysir&quot; was first mentioned in written sources in 1647; as unusual natural phenomena were of great interest during the Age of Enlightenment, the term became popular and has been used for similar hydrothermal features worldwide since then.

In 1809 and 1810 the eruptions were about every 30 hours and up to high. In 1811 George Mackenzie, a geologist, first proposed that expansion of steam in a subsurface cavity explained Geysir&#x27;s activity. In 1845, it reached a height of . In 1846, research on Geysir, and Iceland sponsored by the Danish Crown, by amongst others, the German chemist Robert Bunsen, resulted in a better general explanation of the mechanism of geyser activity which contributed significantly to the more refined models used today. Measurements by Professor Bunsen in that year showed that Geysir was erupting high.

In 1882 an account of the first accurate survey (previous attempts were associated with instrument problems), noted that a booming sound warned or Geysir&#x27;s eruptions, eruptions were about 6 hourly but often of only .

The records of recent centuries show that earthquakes have tended to revive the activity of Geysir, which then subsided again in the following years. Before 1896, Geysir was almost dormant. In that year an earthquake caused eruptions to begin again, occurring several times a day, lasting up to an hour and causing spouts of up to in height. In 1910, it was active every 30 minutes; by 1915, the time between the eruptions was as much as six hours, and in 1916, the eruptions all but ceased. In 1935, a man-made channel was dug through the silica rim around the edge of the geyser vent. This ditch caused a lowering of the water table and a revival in activity. Gradually this channel also became clogged with silica and eruptions again became rare.

In 1981, the ditch was cleared again and eruptions could be stimulated, on special occasions, by the addition of soap. Due to environmental concerns, soap was seldom added during the 1990s. During that time, Geysir seldom erupted. When it did erupt, it was spectacular, sending boiling water sometimes up to into the air. On the Icelandic National Day, authorized government geologists would force an eruption. Further earthquakes in 2000 revived the geyser, and it reached 122 meters for two days., thus becoming one of the highest known geysers in history. Waimangu Geyser in New Zealand typically erupted higher than this, up to high, but it stopped all activity around 1908. Initially, Geysir eruptions were taking place on average eight times a day. By July 2003, this activity had again decreased to around three times per day. Large eruptions after this became so rare that one in 2016 was considered newsworthy.

==Geology==
A current geological definition of a hot water geyser is &quot;…a hot spring characterized by intermittent discharge of water ejected turbulently and accompanied by a vapor phase&quot; which is a technical correction on historic definitions that mentions steam and a column in air. Geysir is technically a hot water pool geyser rather than a cone geyser so much heat is lost to the atmosphere explaining why the maximum temperature in its conduit is several meters below the top of the water column rather than at the top like is the case with Old Faithful. Geysir&#x27;s funnel like surface conduit has a diameter of between and until a narrow constriction a depth of about . In the conduit above the geyser has a temperature between and reaches higher temperatures of about below this. The conduit in this higher temperature region is more constricted and irregular than earlier studies could ascertain, and fracture related with potential for the boiling temperature to be reached. Below the conduit has several branches and cavities. As it is closer to sea level than most of the world&#x27;s 1000 odd geysers the actual erupted water temperature is higher than most.

The in area Haukadalur volcanic system, that provides the heat, is mainly to the west of Geysir but has not been active volcanically for over 10,000 years. Geysir is on the eastern slopes of the rhyolitic Laugarfjall lava dome, but the hyaloclastite nature of the rock that the water erupts through, may be important in its fracture network. It is now known that the areas of thermal activity of the geothermal field align along microfractures that became seismologically active after the 2000 Iceland earthquakes.

The geothermal water source may be the southern Langjökull ice sheet, about to the north.

Research on the deposits of sinter, formed from the dissolved minerals in the hot water, shows that hot springs at the Geysir location have been active for approximately 10,000 years. However before Geysir became active as a definitive geyser the previous deposits were covered with tephra from Katla and Hekla and little sinter was deposited for about 2000 years. Once Geysir became active, precipitation of opal from the geothermal water lead to a siliceous sinter apron around the geyser. This has allowed formation of the modern geyser to be dated to about 1150 CE which accords with the history of written mention above.

==Nearby Geysers==

The nearby geyser Strokkur erupts much more frequently than Geysir, erupting to heights of up to every few minutes. Strokkur was first described in 1789. There is contrast in its lack of warning of eruption with the case of Geysir and evidence that the plumbing might not be totally independent. Strokkur&#x27;s conduit has also been mapped in detail and is pipe shaped to , where it narrows before expanding into a cavity at about before narrowing again into a fracture configuration at about where temperatures become close to the boiling point. Strokkur&#x27;s activity has also been affected by earthquakes, although to a lesser extent than the Great Geysir. Due to its eruption frequency, online photos and videos of Strokkur are regularly mislabelled as depicting Geysir. There are around thirty much smaller geysers and hot pools in the area, including one called Litli Geysir (&#x27;Little Geysir&#x27;). Detailed thermal mapping of the geothermal field has revealed 364 distinct hot areas.

Descriptions of the Great Geysir and Strokkur have been given in many travel guides to Iceland published from the 18th century onwards. Together with Þingvellir and the Gullfoss waterfall, they are part of the &quot;Golden Circle&quot;, the most famous tourist route in the country.

Geysir was officially protected by the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources on 17 June 2020.

==Ownership of the area==
Until 1894, the Geysir area was owned by local farmers. In that year the area was sold to James Craig (later Lord Craigavon), a whiskey distiller from Ulster and a future Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Initially, he erected large fences around the site and an entrance fee was charged for visitors wishing to view the geysers. The following year, he gave the area as a present to a friend, E. Craig, who dropped the entrance fees. Later Craig&#x27;s nephew Hugh Rogers inherited the site. In 1935, he sold the site to film director Sigurður Jónasson who subsequently donated it to the Icelandic people in perpetuity, although full public ownership of all routes of access did not take place until 2017.

<text>Strokkur (Icelandic , &quot;churn&quot;) is a fountain-type geyser located in a geothermal area beside the Hvítá River in Iceland in the southwest part of the country, east of Reykjavík. It typically erupts every 6–10 minutes. Its usual height is , although it can sometimes erupt up to high.

==Location==
Strokkur belongs to the Haukadalur valley area, where various other geothermal feature such as mud pools, fumaroles and other geysers are located around it, such as the famous Geysir geyser, which lies only to the north.

==History==
Strokkur was first mentioned in 1789, after an earthquake helped to unblock the conduit of the geyser. Its activity fluctuated throughout the 19th century; in 1815 its height was estimated to have been as much as . It continued to erupt until the turn of the 20th century, when another earthquake blocked the conduit again. In 1963, upon the advice of the Geysir Committee, locals cleaned out the blocked conduit through the bottom of the basin, and the geyser has been regularly erupting ever since.

==Tourism==
Strokkur and its surrounding areas regularly attract tourists hoping to see the geyser erupt, as it is one of a very few natural geysers to erupt frequently and reliably.

==Evolution of the eruption==
