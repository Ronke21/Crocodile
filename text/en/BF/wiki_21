<text>In electronics, a common-base (also known as grounded-base) amplifier is one of three basic single-stage bipolar junction transistor (BJT) amplifier topologies, typically used as a current buffer or voltage amplifier.

In this circuit the emitter terminal of the transistor serves as the input, the collector as the output, and the base is connected to ground, or &quot;common&quot;, hence its name. The analogous field-effect transistor circuit is the common-gate amplifier.

== Applications ==
This arrangement is not very common in low-frequency discrete circuits, where it is usually employed for amplifiers that require an unusually low input impedance, for example to act as a preamplifier for moving-coil microphones.
However, it is popular in integrated circuits and in high-frequency amplifiers, for example for VHF and UHF, because its input capacitance does not suffer from the Miller effect, which degrades the bandwidth of the common-emitter configuration, and because of the relatively high isolation between the input and output. This high isolation means that there is little feedback from the output back to the input, leading to high stability.

This configuration is also useful as a current buffer, since it has a current gain of approximately unity (see formulae below). Often a common base is used in this manner, preceded by a common-emitter stage. The combination of these two form the cascode configuration, which possesses several of the benefits of each configuration, such as high input impedance and isolation.

== Low-frequency characteristics ==
At low frequencies and under small-signal conditions, the circuit in Figure 1 can be represented by that in Figure 2, where the hybrid-pi model for the BJT has been employed. The input signal is represented by a Thévenin voltage source &quot;v&quot;s with a series resistance &quot;R&quot;s and the load is a resistor &quot;R&quot;L.
This circuit can be used to derive the following characteristics of the common base amplifier.

: Note: Parallel lines (||) indicate components in parallel.

In general, the overall voltage/current gain may be substantially less than the open/short-circuit gains listed above (depending on the source and load resistances) due to the loading effect.

=== Active loads ===

For voltage amplification, the range of allowed output voltage swing in this amplifier is tied to voltage gain when a resistor load &quot;R&quot;C is employed, as in Figure 1. That is, large voltage gain requires large &quot;R&quot;C, and that in turn implies a large DC voltage drop across &quot;R&quot;C. For a given supply voltage, the larger this drop, the smaller the transistor &quot;V&quot;CB and the less output swing is allowed before saturation of the transistor occurs, with resultant distortion of the output signal. To avoid this situation, an active load can be used, for example, a current mirror. If this choice is made, the value of &quot;R&quot;C in the table above is replaced by the small-signal output resistance of the active load, which is generally at least as large as the &quot;r&quot;O of the active transistor in Figure 1. On the other hand, the DC voltage drop across the active load has a fixed low value (the compliance voltage of the active load), much less than the DC voltage drop incurred for comparable gain using a resistor &quot;RC&quot;. That is, an active load imposes less restriction on the output voltage swing. Notice that active load or not, large AC gain still is coupled to large AC output resistance, which leads to poor voltage division at the output except for large loads &quot;R&quot;L ≫ &quot;R&quot;out.

For use as a current buffer, gain is not affected by &quot;R&quot;C, but output resistance is. Because of the current division at the output, it is desirable to have an output resistance for the buffer much larger than the load &quot;R&quot;L being driven, so large signal currents can be delivered to a load. If a resistor &quot;R&quot;C is used, as in Figure 1, a large output resistance is coupled to a large &quot;R&quot;C, again limiting the signal swing at the output. (Even though current is delivered to the load, usually a large current signal into the load implies a large voltage swing across the load as well.) An active load provides high AC output resistance with much less serious impact upon the amplitude of output signal swing.

== Overview of characteristics ==

Several example applications are described in detail below. A brief overview follows.
* The amplifier input impedance &quot;R&quot;in looking into the emitter node is very low, given approximately by
*: formula_1
: where &quot;V&quot;T is the thermal voltage, and &quot;I&quot;E is the DC emitter current.
: For example, for &quot;V&quot;T = 26 mV and &quot;I&quot;E = 10 mA, rather typical values, &quot;R&quot;in = 2.6 Ω. If &quot;I&quot;E is reduced to increase &quot;R&quot;in, there are other consequences like lower transconductance, higher output resistance and lower &quot;β&quot; that also must be considered. A practical solution to this low-input-impedance problem is to place a common-emitter stage at the input to form a cascode amplifier.
* Because the input impedance is so low, most signal sources have larger source impedance than the common-base amplifier &quot;R&quot;in. The consequence is that the source delivers a &quot;current&quot; to the input rather than a voltage, even if it is a voltage source. (According to Norton&#x27;s theorem, this current is approximately &quot;i&quot;in = &quot;v&quot;S / &quot;R&quot;S). If the output signal also is a current, the amplifier is a current buffer and delivers the same current as is input. If the output is taken as a voltage, the amplifier is a transresistance amplifier and delivers a voltage dependent on the load impedance, for example &quot;v&quot;out = &quot;i&quot;in &quot;R&quot;L for a resistor load &quot;R&quot;L much smaller in value than the amplifier output resistance &quot;R&quot;out. That is, the voltage gain in this case (explained in more detail below) is
*: formula_2
: Note that for source impedances such that &quot;R&quot;S ≫ &quot;r&quot;E the output impedance approaches &quot;R&quot;out = &quot;R&quot;C || [&quot;g&quot;m (&quot;r&quot;π || &quot;R&quot;S) &quot;r&quot;O].
* For the special case of very low-impedance sources, the common-base amplifier does work as a voltage amplifier, one of the examples discussed below. In this case (explained in more detail below), when &quot;R&quot;S ≪ &quot;r&quot;E and &quot;R&quot;L ≪ &quot;R&quot;out, the voltage gain becomes
*: formula_3
: where &quot;g&quot;m = &quot;I&quot;C / &quot;V&quot;T is the transconductance. Notice that for low source impedance, &quot;R&quot;out = &quot;r&quot;O || &quot;R&quot;C.
* The inclusion of &quot;r&quot;O in the hybrid-pi model predicts reverse transmission from the amplifiers output to its input, that is the amplifier is bilateral. One consequence of this is that the input/output impedance is affected by the load/source termination impedance, hence, for example, the output resistance &quot;R&quot;out may vary over the range &quot;r&quot;O || &quot;R&quot;C ≤ &quot;R&quot;out ≤ (&quot;β&quot; + 1) &quot;r&quot;O || &quot;R&quot;C, depending on the source resistance &quot;R&quot;S. The amplifier can be approximated as unilateral when neglect of &quot;r&quot;O is accurate (valid for low gains and low to moderate load resistances), simplifying the analysis. This approximation often is made in discrete designs, but may be less accurate in RF circuits, and in integrated-circuit designs, where active loads normally are used.

=== Voltage amplifier ===
For the case when the common-base circuit is used as a voltage amplifier, the circuit is shown in Figure 2.

The output resistance is large, at least &quot;R&quot;C || &quot;r&quot;O, the value which arises with low source impedance (&quot;R&quot;S ≪ &quot;r&quot;E). A large output resistance is undesirable in a voltage amplifier, as it leads to poor voltage division at the output. Nonetheless, the voltage gain is appreciable even for small loads: according to the table, with &quot;R&quot;S = &quot;r&quot;E the gain is &quot;A&quot;v = &quot;g&quot;m &quot;R&quot;L / 2. For larger source impedances, the gain is determined by the resistor ratio &quot;R&quot;L / &quot;R&quot;S, and not by the transistor properties, which can be an advantage where insensitivity to temperature or transistor variations is important.

An alternative to the use of the hybrid-pi model for these calculations is a general technique based upon two-port networks. For example, in an application like this one where voltage is the output, a g-equivalent two-port could be selected for simplicity, as it uses a voltage amplifier in the output port.

For &quot;R&quot;S values in the vicinity of &quot;r&quot;E the amplifier is transitional between voltage amplifier and current buffer. For &quot;R&quot;S ≫ &quot;r&quot;E the driver representation as a Thévenin source should be replaced by representation with a Norton source. The common base circuit stops behaving like a voltage amplifier and behaves like a current follower, as discussed next.

=== Current follower ===
Figure 3 shows the common base amplifier used as a current follower. The circuit signal is provided by an AC Norton source (current &quot;I&quot;S, Norton resistance &quot;R&quot;S) at the input, and the circuit has a resistor load &quot;R&quot;L at the output.

As mentioned earlier, this amplifier is bilateral as a consequence of the output resistance &quot;r&quot;O, which connects the output to the input. In this case the output resistance is large even in the worst case (it is at least &quot;r&quot;O || &quot;R&quot;C and can become (&quot;β&quot; + 1) &quot;r&quot;O || &quot;R&quot;C for large &quot;R&quot;S). Large output resistance is a desirable attribute of a current source because favorable current division sends most of the current to the load. The current gain is very nearly unity as long as &quot;R&quot;S ≫ &quot;r&quot;E.

An alternative analysis technique is based upon two-port networks. For example, in an application like this one where current is the output, an h-equivalent two-port is selected because it uses a current amplifier in the output port.

<doc id="295717" wikidata="Q213346" url="?curid=295717" title="John Stockton">
<text>John Houston Stockton (born March 26, 1962) is an American former professional basketball player. Regarded as one of the greatest point guards of all time, he spent his entire NBA career (1984–2003) with the Utah Jazz, and the team made the playoffs in all of his 19 seasons. In 1997 and 1998, together with his longtime teammate Karl Malone, Stockton led the Jazz to the franchise&#x27;s only two NBA Finals appearances, both of which were losses to the Chicago Bulls.

Stockton was a ten-time NBA All-Star and holds the NBA records for most career assists and steals by wide margins. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as a member of the 1992 United States Olympic basketball team. In 1996, he was named one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history. In October 2021, Stockton was again honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

==Early years==
Stockton was born in Spokane, Washington, to Clementine () and Jack Stockton. He attended grade school at St. Aloysius and moved on to high school at Gonzaga Prep and graduated in 1980, after breaking the city record for points scored in a single basketball season.

==College career==
After considering offers from Don Monson at Idaho and Mike Montgomery at Montana (both in the Big Sky Conference), Stockton decided to stay in Spokane and play college basketball for Dan Fitzgerald at Gonzaga University. He became the third generation in his family at GU; grandfather Houston Stockton was a well-known football player for the Bulldogs in the 1920s. Fitzgerald was also the athletic director; he stepped away from coaching for four years after Stockton&#x27;s freshman year and promoted assistant Jay Hillock to head coach.

During his senior year for the Bulldogs in 1984, Stockton averaged 20.9 points per game shooting 57% from the field. The Zags posted a 17–11 record, their best in 17 years, and Stockton led the West Coast Athletic Conference in scoring, assists, and steals. For his performance, he was named WCAC Player of the Year, the first-ever Gonzaga player to earn the award.

He was one of 74 college players invited to the spring tryouts for the 1984 U.S. Olympic team coached by Bob Knight. Stockton made the initial cut in April to the final 20, but was one of four released in May (with Charles Barkley, Terry Porter, and Maurice Martin) in the penultimate cut to 16 players. Though not selected, the experience led him to meet his future teammate and friend, Karl Malone.

==Professional career==

=== Utah Jazz (1984–2003) ===
In June 1984, Stockton was selected by the Utah Jazz in the first round of the 1984 NBA draft as the 16th overall pick. Though he was relatively unknown during his college career, his stock rose significantly in the months before the NBA draft. Nevertheless, the announcement of his selection to the thousands of Jazz fans gathered at the Salt Palace on draft day was met with a stunned silence. On November 10, 1984, Stockton had his highest scoring game as a rookie, with 19 points in only 19 minutes of playing time, during a loss against the Denver Nuggets.

Stockton became the starting point guard for the Jazz in the 1987–88 season. That season, despite eventually finishing tenth in MVP voting and being named to the All-NBA Second Team after averaging 14.7 points, 13.8 assists, and 3 steals a game, Stockton was not selected to play in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game. In 1988–89, he played in his first All-Star Game, and led the NBA in assists per game for the first of nine consecutive seasons.

On January 15, 1991, Stockton scored 20 points and dished out a career-high and franchise-record 28 assists in a 124–102 home win against the San Antonio Spurs. On February 12, Stockton nearly recorded a triple-double after putting up 19 points, 11 assists, and 9 steals in a 113–92 win over the Houston Rockets.

In 1992, Stockton and the Jazz reached the Western Conference Finals for the first time; however, they were defeated by the Portland Trail Blazers in six games. Along with Malone, Stockton was named co-MVP of the All-Star Game in 1993 and the game was held in Salt Lake City.

During the 1994–95 season, Stockton achieved many milestones. On February 1, 1995, he passed Magic Johnson (who had 9,921 assists) as the NBA&#x27;s all-time leader in assists as he dished out 16 assists in a 129–98 victory over the visiting Denver Nuggets. His 16 assists gave him 9,937 assists for his career at that time. Magic Johnson, in an interview, said to Stockton, &quot;John, from one assist man to another, you are the greatest team leader I have ever played against.&quot; Seventeen days later, Stockton dished out 15 assists in a 108–98 victory over the Boston Celtics. His 15 assists gave him a career total of 10,008 assists, the first-ever player to have dished out 10,000 assists in his career. On March 25, Stockton just became the second player in NBA history to have recorded 2,000 steals after recording 6 steals in a 117–110 loss to the Dallas Mavericks.

Stockton and the Jazz reached the Conference Finals again in 1994 and 1996, but lost to the Houston Rockets and the Seattle SuperSonics, respectively.
Utah set a franchise record and led the Western Conference with 64 wins in the 1996–97 season. The team again reached the Western Conference Finals. In Game Six of the Conference Finals, Stockton scored 25 points, dished out 13 assists, and made a buzzer-beating, game-winning three-point shot over the Rockets&#x27; Charles Barkley to send the Jazz to the first of two consecutive NBA Finals appearances. Stockton&#x27;s game-winner became known as &quot;The Shot&quot;. In Game 3 of the 1997 NBA Finals, Stockton recorded 17 points, 7 rebounds, and 12 assists in their first Finals&#x27; win in franchise history. The Jazz were defeated by the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in six games in the Finals.

Stockton missed the first 18 games of the 1997–98 season with a knee injury, but the Jazz returned to the NBA Finals and again faced the Bulls. In Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals, Stockton made a three-pointer with 41.9 seconds left to give the Jazz a lead, but Bulls guard Michael Jordan made two field goals to put his team ahead 87–86. Stockton missed a three-point attempt with 5.2 seconds left and said in a post-game interview that he felt confident the shot would go in. The Bulls again defeated the Jazz in six games.

The Jazz made the NBA playoffs every season during Stockton&#x27;s 19-year NBA career.

===Retirement===

On May 2, 2003, Stockton announced his retirement with a released statement instead of the customary news conference. The Jazz later held a retirement ceremony for him, in which Salt Lake City renamed the street in front of the venue known as Delta Center, where the Jazz play, John Stockton Drive. Stockton would later declare that despite being still content with the game and how well he was playing, his growing family made him feel that &quot;sitting in the hotel room waiting for games wasn&#x27;t making up for what I was missing at home.&quot;

Stockton&#x27;s number 12 jersey was retired by the Jazz during a game on November 22, 2004. A statue of Stockton can be seen in front of the Delta Center; an accompanying statue of Karl Malone was placed nearby on March 23, 2006. The Malone and Stockton statues stand on a bronze plaque commemorating their achievements together. Stockton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009. Stockton was also inducted into the Hall of Fame along with the rest of the 1992 United States men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team in 2010.

==Player profile==
Stockton was notable for his durability, missing only 22 games in his 19-season career and playing every game of 17 seasons. In his first 13 seasons, he missed only four games (all in the 1989–90 season) until he missed the first 18 games of the 1997–98 season due to an injured MCL in his left knee sustained in the preseason. That was the only major injury in his career, and he never missed another game after returning from that injury. Stockton earned the &quot;old school&quot; tag for his physical play; surveys of athletes and fans alike often judged him among the toughest players in the NBA, usually just behind teammate Karl Malone. Stockton&#x27;s tenacity also earned him a reputation among some in the league as being a dirty player, as suggested by a poll &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; conducted in 1997 where he was voted as the second dirtiest player in the league behind Dennis Rodman. His patented &quot;short shorts&quot; became known as &quot;Stocktons&quot;—since he continued to wear the style long after the rest of the league had adopted a baggier look.

Stockton&#x27;s career is also notable for its consistency and longevity. He remained a starting NBA player until his retirement at age 41. Stockton avoided most endorsements and stayed loyal to Utah despite being offered more money by other teams. In 1996, he agreed to a deal that made salary-cap space available so the team could improve, but in exchange, he insisted on guaranteed Delta Center ice time for his son&#x27;s hockey team.

For many years, Karl Malone and Stockton were the Jazz&#x27;s one-two punch. The two played a record 1,412 regular season games together as teammates. Many of Stockton&#x27;s assists resulted from passes to Malone. Stockton and Malone have been described as the greatest pick-and-roll combination of all time. Stockton and Malone are also considered two of the best players who never won an NBA championship.

Stockton holds a commanding lead for the NBA record for career assists with 15,806. He was the first player to reach the 10,000 through 15,000 career assist milestones. Stockton also holds the record for assists-per-game average over one season (14.5 in 1990) and is one of three players who have logged more than 1,000 assists in one season, joining Kevin Porter (1,099 in 1979) and Isiah Thomas (1,123 in 1985) in the exclusive list. Stockton did this seven times, with season totals of 1,164, 1,134, 1,128, 1,126, 1,118, 1,031 and 1,011 assists.

On defense, Stockton holds the NBA record for career steals with 3,265. Stockton was also a capable scorer (13.1 points per game career average and a 51.5 career shooting percentage) with a reliable three-point shot (38.4% lifetime average). As of February 2023, he is 55th on the all-time NBA scoring list with 19,711 career points.
Stockton was selected to the All-NBA First Team twice, the All-NBA Second Team six times, the All-NBA Third Team three times, and the NBA All-Defensive Second Team five times. He was selected to 10 All-Star Games. He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA history in 1996. On May 11, 2006, ESPN.com named Stockton the fourth best point guard of all time. In October 2021, Stockton was again honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team In 1999, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Stockton as the best athlete to come out of the state of Washington in the 20th century. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Stockton as the 25th greatest player in NBA history.

==Awards and achievements==

==International play==
Stockton, along with other NBA stars, played on the basketball team in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. The 1992 team was the first U.S. Olympic squad to feature NBA players. The team became known as the Dream Team; the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame called it &quot;the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet&quot;. Stockton also played on the 1996 U.S. men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team. Stockton won gold medals with both the 1992 and 1996 teams.

==Post-retirement activities==
Following his retirement, Stockton moved back to his hometown Spokane. He started coaching in youth teams, being &quot;an assistant on seven or eight teams at once&quot; in 2003. The Jazz also invited Stockton to train both Deron Williams and Trey Burke. Stockton also became involved in various businesses including construction projects.

In 2013, Stockton released an autobiography entitled &quot;Assisted&quot;. The book was written with the assistance of his junior high school coach, Kerry L. Pickett. Karl Malone wrote the foreword. Stockton was on the Jazz&#x27;s long list of coaching candidates to replace Tyrone Corbin before the selection of Quin Snyder.

On October 28, 2015, Stockton joined Montana State University&#x27;s women&#x27;s basketball program as an assistant coach to replace Kellee Barney. Barney left the program to pursue a career in business, and Stockton had previously coached four of the players on the MSU women&#x27;s team when they played for teams in Amateur Athletic Union leagues.

In 2021, Stockton appeared in a video series titled &quot;V-Revealed, COVID Edition,&quot; raising doubt about the COVID-19 pandemic and warning against vaccines. Stockton said he had done a &quot;significant amount of research&quot; and determined, &quot;This isn&#x27;t a virus cheating us of these opportunities. It&#x27;s the guys making decisions saying, &#x27;No, no, we&#x27;re too scared. We&#x27;re going to shut everything down. He made the claim that &quot;hundreds&quot; of athletes had died due to receiving a COVID vaccine, which was found by PolitiFact to be a false statement. In January 2022, Gonzaga suspended his season tickets because of his refusal to comply with the university&#x27;s mask mandate.

==Personal life==

Hust Stockton, Stockton&#x27;s grandfather (born John Houston Stockton) played professional football for the Frankford Yellow Jackets in the nascent National Football League in the 1920s; Stockton was a member of the Yellow Jackets&#x27; 1926 NFL Championship team.

Stockton and his wife, the former Nada Stepovich (the daughter of Matilda Stepovich and Mike Stepovich, the last territorial governor of Alaska) reside in Spokane. They have two daughters (Lindsay and Laura) and four sons (Houston, Michael, David, and Samuel). Stockton and his family are Catholics.

Houston Stockton played college football as a defensive back for the Montana Grizzlies. In 2011, Michael Stockton, who played basketball at Salt Lake City&#x27;s Westminster College, signed with BG Karlsruhe in Germany&#x27;s second basketball division. In 2017, Michael signed with BG Göttingen in Germany&#x27;s first basketball division, the Basketball Bundesliga. David Stockton completed his college basketball career at Gonzaga in 2014 and, after playing for the Reno Bighorns in the NBA&#x27;s Development League, played for the NBA&#x27;s Sacramento Kings and Utah Jazz. Daughter Lindsay Stockton played basketball for Montana State University and daughter Laura Stockton played basketball at Gonzaga.

Laura signed her first professional contract to play for Herner TC in Germany in 2020. In 2022, she signed a contract with the TK Hannover Luchse (&quot;Lynxes&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany, where she soon became a fan favorite thanks to her powerful, aggressive playing style. In that season, Laura Stockton and the Lynxes won the German Cup and reached the championship finals, gaining home advantage as top seeded team after the regular season. After forward and scoring leader Angel Rizor suffered a broken hand in game 1, they lost 0–3 against the new champions, the Keltern Stars.

Stockton has a brother and three nephews who have played college basketball. Steve Stockton, his brother, played for the University of Washington. Steve Stockton&#x27;s oldest son Steve Stockton Jr. played at Whitworth College; another son, Shawn Stockton finished his college basketball career at the University of Montana in the 2011–12 season; and Steve&#x27;s youngest son, Riley played for Seattle Pacific.

Stockton has appeared in television commercials for Foot Locker, State Farm Insurance, and Diet Pepsi.

In 2022, Stockton appeared in a documentary and expressed anti-vaccine views and his belief in COVID-19 conspiracies. Stockton later unsuccessfully sued the Washington attorney general and the executive director of the Washington Medical Commission, challenging the discipline of doctors who spread COVID-19 conspiracy theories as unconstitutional.

==In popular culture==
In 2024, Stockton was referenced in Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s Grammy Award-winning diss track &quot;Not Like Us&quot;, which targeted Canadian rapper Drake. The reference alluded to Stockton&#x27;s skill as a passer and past paternity claims made against his teammate, Karl Malone.

<text>The &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; was an ice hockey game during the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. It was played between the hosting United States and the Soviet Union on February 22, 1980, during the medal round of the men&#x27;s ice hockey tournament. Although the Soviet Union was a four-time defending gold medalist and heavily favored, the United States achieved an upset victory, winning 4–3.

The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and they were the favorites to win once more in Lake Placid. The Soviet team consisted of professional players with significant experience in international play. By contrast, the United States team, led by head coach Herb Brooks, was composed mostly of amateur players, with only four players with minimal minor-league experience. In addition, the United States had the youngest team in the tournament and in U.S. national team history.

In the group stage, both the Soviet and American teams were undefeated; the U.S. achieved several surprising results, including a 2–2 draw against Sweden, and a 7–3 upset victory over second-place favorite Czechoslovakia.

For the first game in the medal round, the Americans played the Soviets. Finishing the first period tied at 2–2, and the Soviets leading 3–2 following the second, the U.S. team scored two more goals to take their first lead midway in the third and final period, then held out to win by a score of 4–3. Two days later, the U.S. secured the gold medal by defeating Finland 4–2 in their final game, while the Soviet Union claimed the silver medal with a dominant 9–2 victory over Sweden.

The victory became one of the most iconic moments of the Games and in U.S. sports. Equally well-known was the television call of the final seconds of the game by Al Michaels for ABC, in which he declared: &quot;Do you believe in miracles? Yes!&quot; In 1999, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; the top sports moment of the 20th century. As part of its centennial celebration in 2008, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) named the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; as the top international ice hockey story of the past 100 years.

==History==
===The Soviet and American teams===

The Soviet Union entered the Lake Placid games as the heavy favorite, having won four consecutive gold medals dating back to the 1964 games. In the four Olympics following their 1960 bronze-medal finish at Squaw Valley, Soviet teams had gone 27–1–1 (wins-losses-ties) and outscored their opponents 175–44. In head-to-head matchups against the United States, the cumulative score over that period was 28–7. The Soviet team had not lost a game in Olympic play since 1968.

The Soviets were led by legendary players in world ice hockey, such as Boris Mikhailov (a top line right winger and team captain), Vladislav Tretiak (the consensus best goaltender in the world at the time), the speedy and skilled Valeri Kharlamov, and talented, dynamic players such as defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov and forwards Vladimir Krutov and Sergei Makarov. From that team, Tretiak, Kharlamov, Makarov, and Fetisov were eventually enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame. Many of the Soviet players had gained attention in the Summit Series eight years before and, in contrast to the American players, were &quot;de facto&quot; professionals with long histories of international play, employed by industrial firms or military organizations for the sole purpose of playing hockey on their organization&#x27;s team. Western nations protested the Soviet Union&#x27;s use of full-time athletes, as they were forced to use amateur (mainly college) players due to the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s (IOC) amateur-only policy. The situation even led to Canadian withdrawal from the 1972 and 1976 Olympics, but the IOC did not change the rules until the late 1980s.

U.S. head coach Herb Brooks held tryouts in Colorado Springs in the summer of 1979. Of the 20 players who eventually made the final Olympic roster, Buzz Schneider was the only one returning from the 1976 Olympic team. Nine players had played under Brooks at the University of Minnesota (including Rob McClanahan, Mike Ramsey, and Phil Verchota), while four more were from Boston University (Dave Silk, Jack O&#x27;Callahan, goaltender Jim Craig, and team captain Mike Eruzione). As Boston University and Minnesota were perennial rivals in college hockey (for instance, they had faced off in a bitter NCAA national semifinal in 1976), Brooks&#x27; selection process was a 300-question psychological test that would give him insight on how every player would react under stress; anyone who refused to take the test would automatically fail. Brooks had to select from 68 players who started the tryout.

The average age of the U.S. team was 21 years, making it the youngest team in U.S. history to play in the Olympics (in addition to being the youngest team in the 1980 Olympic tournament), but Brooks knew the limits of every player. As forward John Harrington said, &quot;He knew exactly where to quit. He&#x27;d push you right to the limit where you were ready to say, &#x27;I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;m throwing it in&#x27; — and then he&#x27;d back off.&quot; Brooks continued the organization by campaigning for the players&#x27; selection of Eruzione as the captain, and Craig had been the goalie for him in the 1979 World Championship tournament. Assistant coach Craig Patrick had played with Brooks on the 1967 U.S. national team.

The Soviet and American teams were natural rivals due to the decades-old Cold War. In addition, U.S. President Jimmy Carter was considering boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics, which were to be held in Moscow, in protest of the December 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. On February 9, the same day the American and Soviet teams met in an exhibition game in New York City, U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance denounced the impending Moscow Games at an IOC meeting. President Carter eventually decided in favor of the boycott.

===Exhibitions===
In exhibitions that year, Soviet club teams went 5–3–1 against National Hockey League (NHL) teams and, a year earlier, the Soviet national team had defeated a team of NHL All-Stars two games to one (by scores of 2–4, 5–4, and 6–0) to win the Challenge Cup. In 1979–80, virtually all the top North American players were Canadians, although the number of U.S.-born professional players had been on the rise throughout the 1970s. The 1980 U.S. Olympic team featured several young players who were regarded as highly promising, and some had signed contracts to play in the NHL immediately after the tournament.

In September 1979, before the Olympics, the American team started exhibition play. They played a total of 61 games in five months against teams from Europe and the United States. Through these games, Brooks instilled a European style of play in his team, emphasizing wide-open play with sufficient body contact. He believed it would be the only way for the Americans to compete with the Soviets. From the start of the exhibition matches, he conducted the team through skating wind sprints consisting of end line to blue line and back, then end line to red line and back, then end line to far blue line and back, and finally end line all the way down and back. Some of the players took to calling these &quot;Herbies&quot;. On September 17, the team played to a 3–3 tie in Norway. Believing the team wasn&#x27;t putting up sufficient effort, an angry Brooks had them skate Herbies after the game and, after a while, arena custodians turned the lights off and the Herbies continued in the dark. Brooks skated the team for over an hour. The two teams played again the next night, with the U.S. winning handily 9–0. Near the end of the exhibition season, Brooks, because of subpar play, threatened to cut Eruzione (the captain) from the team and replace Craig with Steve Janaszak as the starting goaltender, although he had supported them throughout.

In their last exhibition game, against the Soviets at Madison Square Garden on Saturday, February 9, the Americans were crushed 10–3. Soviet head coach Viktor Tikhonov later said that this victory &quot;turned out to be a very big problem&quot; by causing the Soviets to underestimate the American team. The game was also costly for the Americans off-ice, as defenseman Jack O&#x27;Callahan pulled a ligament in his knee; however, Brooks kept O&#x27;Callahan on the roster, which meant the U.S. was virtually playing with only 19 players throughout the tournament. O&#x27;Callahan eventually returned for the game against the Soviets, playing limited minutes.

===Olympic group play===

In Olympic group play, the Americans surprised many observers with their physical, cohesive play. In their first game, on February 12 against favored Sweden, Team USA earned a dramatic 2–2 draw by scoring with 27 seconds left after pulling goalie Jim Craig for an extra attacker. Then came a stunning 7–3 victory over Czechoslovakia, who were a favorite for the silver medal. With its two toughest games in the group phase out of the way, the U.S. team reeled off three more wins, beating Norway 5–1, Romania 7–2, and West Germany 4–2 to go 4–0–1 and advance to the medal round from its group, along with Sweden.

In the other group, the Soviets stormed through their opposition undefeated, often by grossly lopsided scores. They defeated Japan 16–0, the Netherlands 17–4, Poland 8–1, Finland 4–2, and Canada 6–4 to easily qualify for the next round, although both the Finns and the Canadians gave the Soviets tough games for two periods. In the end, the Soviet Union and Finland advanced from their group.

==Game summary==
Prior to the Friday game, ABC requested that it be rescheduled from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST, so that it could be broadcast live in primetime. However, the IIHF declined the request after the Soviets complained that it would cause the game to air at 4 a.m. Moscow Time, as opposed to 1 a.m. As a result, ABC decided not to broadcast the game live for the U.S. audience and tape delayed it for broadcast during its primetime block of Olympics coverage. Before the game aired, ABC&#x27;s Olympics host Jim McKay openly stated that the game had already occurred, but that they had promised not to spoil its results. In order to accommodate coverage of the men&#x27;s slalom competition, portions of the game were also edited for time. ABC&#x27;s 8 to 8:30 p.m. timeslot was instead devoted to the animated special &quot;The Pink Panther in: Olym-Pinks&quot;. To this day, some who watched the game on television in the United States still believe that it was live.

With a capacity of 8,500, the arena was packed. Before the game, Brooks read his players a statement he had written out on a piece of paper, telling them that &quot;You were born to be a player. You were meant to be here. This moment is yours.&quot; Brooks believed they could win and later said, &quot;The Russians were ready to cut their own throats. But we had to get to the point to be ready to pick up the knife and hand it to them. So the morning of the game I called the team together and told them, &#x27;It&#x27;s meant to be. This is your moment and it&#x27;s going to happen.&#x27; It&#x27;s kind of corny and I could see them thinking, &#x27;Here goes Herb again...&#x27; But I believed it.&quot;

Brooks wanted his team to play short shifts lasting 40 seconds or less to stay energized by the third period. He instructed team physician George Nagobads to track ice time for the players, who later joked that he never saw the game since he was focused on his stopwatch.

===First period===
As in several previous games, the U.S. team fell behind early. Vladimir Krutov deflected a slap shot by Alexei Kasatonov past U.S. goaltender Jim Craig at the 9:12 mark to give the Soviets a 1–0 lead. At the 14:03 mark, Buzz Schneider scored for the United States on a 50-foot shot from the left board to tie the game. The Soviets struck again when Sergei Makarov scored with 17:34 gone. With his team down 2–1, Craig improved his play, turning away many Soviet shots before the U.S. team had another shot on goal.

In the waning seconds of the first period, Dave Christian fired a slap shot on Tretiak from away. The Soviet goalie saved the shot but misplayed the rebound, which bounced out some in front of him. Mark Johnson sliced between the two defenders, found the loose puck, and fired it past a diving Tretiak to tie the score with one second left in the period. Confusion reigned immediately after as the game clock showed 0:00 since it could not be stopped in time after Johnson&#x27;s goal. Referee Karl-Gustav Kaisla ruled that one second would be put back on the clock and the usual center ice faceoff would take place before the first intermission could begin. A lengthy delay followed as most of the Soviet team had already proceeded down the tunnel to their locker room. Eventually, three Soviet skaters along with backup goaltender Myshkin took the ice for the final faceoff. The first period ended with the game tied 2–2.

===Second period===
Tikhonov replaced Tretiak with backup goaltender Vladimir Myshkin immediately after Johnson&#x27;s goal, a move that shocked players on both teams. Tikhonov later identified this as the &quot;turning point of the game&quot; and called it &quot;the biggest mistake of my career&quot;. Years later, when Johnson asked Viacheslav Fetisov, now an NHL teammate, about the move, Fetisov responded with &quot;Coach crazy.&quot; Myshkin allowed no goals in the second period. The Soviets dominated play in the second period, outshooting the Americans 12–2, but scored only once, on a power play goal by Aleksandr Maltsev 2:18 into play. After two periods the Soviet Union led, 3–2.

===Third period===
Vladimir Krutov was sent to the penalty box at the 6:47 mark of the third period for high-sticking. The Americans, who had managed only two shots on Myshkin in 27 minutes, had a power play and a rare offensive opportunity. Myshkin stopped a Mike Ramsey shot, then U.S. team captain Mike Eruzione fired a shot wide. Late in the power play, Dave Silk was advancing into the Soviet zone when Valeri Vasiliev knocked him to the ice. The puck slid to Mark Johnson. Johnson fired off a shot that went under Myshkin and into the net at the 8:39 mark, as the power play was ending, tying the game at 3. Only a couple of shifts later, Mark Pavelich passed to Eruzione, who was left undefended in the high slot. Eruzione, who had just come onto the ice, fired a shot past Myshkin, who was screened by Vasili Pervukhin. This goal gave Team USA a 4–3 lead, its first of the game, with exactly 10 minutes remaining to play.

In what many Americans considered &quot;the longest 10 minutes of their lives&quot;, the Soviets, trailing for the first time in the game, attacked ferociously. Moments after Eruzione&#x27;s goal, Maltsev fired a shot which ricocheted off the right goal post. As the minutes wound down, Brooks kept repeating to his players, &quot;Play your game. Play your game.&quot; Instead of going into a defensive crouch, the United States continued to play offense, even getting off a few more shots on goal. The Soviets began to shoot wildly, and Sergei Starikov admitted that &quot;we were panicking.&quot; As the clock ticked down below a minute, the Soviets got the puck back into the American zone, and Mikhailov passed to Vladimir Petrov, who shot wide. The Americans fully expected Tikhonov to pull the goalie in the waning seconds. To their surprise, Myshkin stayed in the game. Starikov later explained that &quot;We never did six-on-five,&quot; not even in practice, because &quot;Tikhonov just didn&#x27;t believe in it.&quot; Craig kicked away a Petrov slap shot with 33 seconds left. Kharlamov fired the puck back in as the clock ticked below 20 seconds. A wild scramble for the puck ensued, ending when Johnson found it and passed it to Ken Morrow. As the U.S. team tried to clear the zone (move the puck over the blue line, which they did with seven seconds remaining), the crowd began to count down the seconds left.

Sportscaster Al Michaels, who was calling the game on ABC along with former Montreal Canadiens goaltender Ken Dryden, picked up on the countdown in his broadcast, and delivered his famous call:

As his team ran all over the ice in celebration, Herb Brooks sprinted back to the locker room and cried. In the locker room afterwards, players spontaneously broke into a chorus of &quot;God Bless America&quot;.

==American aftermath==
===Gold medal===

The United States did not win the gold medal by defeating the USSR. In 1980, the medal round was a round-robin, not a single elimination format as it is today. Under Olympic rules at the time, the group game with Sweden was counted along with the medal round games versus the Soviet Union and Finland. It was mathematically possible for the United States to finish anywhere from first to fourth.
Needing to defeat Finland to secure the gold medal, Team USA faced a 2–1 deficit at the end of the second period. According to Mike Eruzione, coming into the dressing room for the second intermission, Brooks turned to his players, looked at them, and said, &quot;If you lose this game, you&#x27;ll take it to your fucking graves.&quot; He then walked towards the locker room door, paused, looked over his shoulder, and said to them again, &quot;Your fucking graves.&quot; Team USA came back in the third period to defeat Finland 4–2.

At the time, the players ascended a podium to receive their medals and then lined up on the ice for the playing of the national anthem, as the podium was only meant to accommodate one person. Only the team captains remained on the podium for the duration. After the completion of the anthem, Eruzione motioned for his teammates to join him on the podium. Today, podia are not used for ice hockey; the teams line up on their respective blue lines after the final game.

After the gold medal-securing victory over Finland, the players received a congratulatory phone call from President Jimmy Carter.

The cover of the March 3, 1980, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; was a photograph by Heinz Kluetmeier of the American players celebrating and waving an American flag; it did not feature any explanatory captions or headlines, because, as Kluetmeier put it, &quot;It didn&#x27;t need it. Everyone in America knew what happened.&quot; The U.S. team also received the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sportsmen of the Year&quot; award, and were also named Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. In 2004, ESPN, as part of its 25th anniversary, declared the Miracle on Ice to be the top sports headline moment and game of the period 1979–2004. The victory was voted the greatest sports moment of the 20th century by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

===After the 1980 Winter Olympics===
At the 1981 Canada Cup, the United States, with seven players from their 1980 Olympic team, again faced the Soviet Union. The Soviets took the opening round encounter 4–1 in Edmonton. At the 1982 World Championship in Finland, with Mike Ramsey, Mark Johnson, Buzz Schneider, and John Harrington, the Americans again met the Soviets, but once again the U.S. lost, 8–4.

===Later careers===
Of the 20 players on Team USA, 13 eventually played in the NHL. Five of them played over 500 NHL games, and three of them played over 1,000 NHL games.

*Neal Broten played one more season for the Golden Gophers before moving on to the NHL, and he appeared in 1,099 NHL games over 17 seasons—992 of them with the Minnesota North Stars/Dallas Stars franchise. He captained the Stars before being traded midway through the 1994–95 season to the New Jersey Devils. A two-time All-Star, he tallied 923 career points (289 goals, 634 assists), became the first American player to record 100 points in a season, and he won a Stanley Cup as a member of the Devils in 1995. Broten had already won the NCAA championship in 1979 at the University of Minnesota; this, combined with the Olympic gold medal in 1980 and the 1995 Cup win (Broten scored the Cup-winning goal in Game 4 as Viacheslav Fetisov, playing for the opposing Detroit Red Wings, fell down), made him the first player in the history of the sport to win a championship at the collegiate, professional, and Olympic levels. The Dallas Stars have since retired number 7 for Broten.
*Ken Morrow won the Stanley Cup in 1980 as a member of the New York Islanders, becoming the first hockey player to win an Olympic gold medal and the Cup in the same year. He played 550 NHL games and won three more Cups, all with the Islanders. Morrow later worked for the Islanders as Director of Pro Scouting.
*Mike Ramsey played in 1,070 games over 18 years. Fourteen of those years were spent with the Buffalo Sabres, with whom he played 911 games and was a five-time All-Star, captaining the team from 1990 to 1992. In 1995, he played in the Stanley Cup Finals with the Detroit Red Wings, but his team was swept by Neal Broten and the New Jersey Devils. In 2000, Ramsey became an assistant coach for the Minnesota Wild.
*Dave Christian spent 14 years in the NHL, the bulk of them for the original Winnipeg Jets (for whom he served as team captain) and Washington Capitals. In 1990, he played in the Stanley Cup Finals while with the Boston Bruins, but the Bruins lost in five games to the Edmonton Oilers. He ended his career with 783 points (340 goals, 443 assists) in 1,009 games and made the All-Star team in 1991.
*Mark Johnson played for several teams in the NHL before finding a home in New Jersey, tallying 508 career points (203 goals, 305 assists) in 669 games over 11 seasons. Like Christian, Ramsey, and Broten, he became an NHL All-Star (in 1984) and served as Hartford Whalers team captain. In 2002, Johnson became the coach of the University of Wisconsin–Madison women&#x27;s team, leading the Badgers to National Championships in 2006, 2007 (which the Badgers won in the same Lake Placid arena in which the Miracle took place), 2009, 2011, 2019, 2021 and 2023. Johnson also served as head coach of the women&#x27;s ice hockey team that won the silver medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics.
*Jack O&#x27;Callahan played 390 NHL regular season games between 1982 and 1989 for the Chicago Blackhawks and New Jersey Devils.
*Mark Pavelich played 355 NHL regular season games in the NHL for the New York Rangers, Minnesota North Stars, and San Jose Sharks between 1981 and 1992.
*Dave Silk played 249 NHL regular season games for the Boston Bruins, Winnipeg Jets, Detroit Red Wings, and New York Rangers between 1980 and 1985.

*Jim Craig appeared in 30 NHL games for the Atlanta Flames, Boston Bruins, and Minnesota North Stars between 1980 and 1984.
*Team captain Mike Eruzione did not play any high-level ice hockey after the 1980 Olympics, as he felt that he had accomplished all of his hockey goals with the gold medal win. He did work as a hockey television analyst in the 1980s and 1990s.
*Craig Patrick, Brooks&#x27; assistant coach and assistant general manager, both managed and coached the New York Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins. As a result of his success with the Penguins, who won two Stanley Cups while Patrick was general manager, he was enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2002. During that same year, he served as general manager of the Herb Brooks-coached 2002 U.S. hockey team that won the silver medal at the Salt Lake City games.
*Herb Brooks, the team coach, coached several NHL teams following the Olympics, with mixed results. He returned to the Olympics as coach of the French team in 1998, the first Olympics in which NHL players competed. Brooks then led Team USA to the silver medal in 2002, which included a 2–2 round-robin draw and a 3–2 semi-final victory over Russia (the successor to the Soviet Union), the semi-final match coming 22 years to the day after the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; game. Brooks died in a car crash near Forest Lake, Minnesota on August 11, 2003, at the age of 66. In 2005, the Olympic Center ice arena in Lake Placid where the Miracle on Ice took place was renamed in his honor. The following year, Brooks was posthumously enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame.
*Al Michaels got the job as play-by-play announcer for ice hockey at Lake Placid because he was the only member of ABC&#x27;s broadcasting team who had previously called the sport (at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan). Michaels was named &quot;Sportscaster of the Year&quot; in 1980 for his coverage of the event. Michaels spent 26 more years covering sports for ABC before moving to NBC to call &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; alongside John Madden and then Cris Collinsworth after Madden retired.

==Soviet aftermath==
===Silver medal===
In the Soviet locker room, Tikhonov singled out first-line players Tretiak, Kharlamov, Petrov, and Mikhailov, and told each of them, &quot;This is your loss!&quot; Two days after the Miracle on Ice, the Soviet team defeated Sweden 9–2, winning the silver medal. The Soviet players were so upset at their loss that they did not turn in their silver medals to get their names inscribed on them, as is customary. The result stunned the Soviet Union and its news media.

===After the 1980 Winter Olympics===
Despite the loss, the USSR remained the pre-eminent power in Olympic hockey until its dissolution in 1991. The Soviet team did not lose a World Championship game until 1985 and did not lose to the United States again until 1991. Throughout the 1980s, NHL teams continued to draft Soviet players in hopes of enticing them to eventually play in North America. Soviet emigrant Victor Nechayev made a brief appearance with the Los Angeles Kings in the 1982–83 season and, during the 1988–89 season, the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation agreed to let veteran Sergei Pryakhin join the Calgary Flames.

===NHL careers===

In the 1989-90 season, Soviet authorities permitted six more 1980 Olympians – Helmuts Balderis, Viacheslav Fetisov, Alexei Kasatonov, Vladimir Krutov, Sergei Makarov, and Sergei Starikov – to join NHL clubs, but only after they agreed to play in their final World Championship (where they won gold). Makarov won the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year in 1989–90, becoming the oldest player to win that award. Fetisov was a teammate of Mike Ramsey on the 1995 Detroit Red Wings team that lost the Stanley Cup Finals to Neal Broten and the New Jersey Devils. Fetisov completed his career by winning Cups with the Red Wings in 1997 and 1998; the first Cup win also made Fetisov a member of the Triple Gold Club, consisting of individuals who have won a Stanley Cup plus gold medals at the Olympics and World Championships.

==Notable rematches==
The U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Winter Olympics in 1988. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7–5 and won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.

The two teams met again at the 1992 Olympics in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5–2. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.

The U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by Viacheslav Fetisov, met twice in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, which included a 2–2 round-robin draw and a 3–2 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; game. The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.

The U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The game was tied 2–2 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with T. J. Oshie scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the &quot;Marathon on Ice&quot; due to its length. Both teams, however, failed to win a medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing to Canada in the semifinals), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).

==Support for other sports==
The players of the Miracle on Ice team have expressed strong support for bandy becoming a Winter Olympic sport.

==Popular culture==
A made-for-TV movie &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;, starring Karl Malden as Brooks, Steve Guttenberg as Craig, and Andrew Stevens as Eruzione aired on ABC television in 1981. It incorporated actual game footage and original commentary from the 1980 Winter Games.

The documentary film &quot;Do You Believe in Miracles?&quot;, narrated by Liev Schreiber, premiered on HBO in 2001 and was subsequently released on home video.

In 2004, Walt Disney Pictures released the film &quot;Miracle&quot;, directed by Gavin O&#x27;Connor and starring Kurt Russell as Brooks. Al Michaels recreated his commentary for most of the games. The final ten seconds, however, and his &quot;Do you believe in miracles? YES!&quot; call, were from the original broadcast and used in the film since the filmmakers felt that they could not ask him to recreate the emotion he felt at that moment. The film was dedicated to Brooks, who died shortly after principal photography completed.

The documentary &quot;Of Miracles And Men&quot;, which was directed by Jonathan Hock, premiered on ESPN in 2015 as part of the channel&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30&quot; series. The story of the 1980 matchup is told from the Soviet perspective.

In The X-Files (season 4, episode 7), Cigarette Smoking Man (aka Cancer Man) reveals that he rigged the game by injecting the goaltender with a small amount of novocaine, saying &quot;What&#x27;s the matter? Don&#x27;t you believe in miracles?&quot;

<text>John Gould Fletcher (January 3, 1886 – May 10, 1950) was an Imagist poet (the first Southern poet to win the Pulitzer Prize), author and authority on modern painting. He was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, to a socially prominent family. After attending Phillips Academy, Andover, Fletcher went on to Harvard University from 1903 to 1907, but dropped out shortly after his father&#x27;s death.

==Background==
Fletcher lived in England for a large portion of his life. While in Europe he associated with Amy Lowell, Ezra Pound, and other Imagist poets; he was one of the six Imagists who adopted the name and stuck to it until their aims were achieved. Fletcher resumed a liaison with Florence Emily &quot;Daisy&quot; Arbuthnot (née Goold) at her house in Kent. She had been married to Malcolm Arbuthnot and Fletcher&#x27;s adultery with her was the grounds for the divorce. The couple married on July 5, 1916. The marriage produced no children, but Arbuthnot&#x27;s son and daughter from her previous marriage lived with the couple, who later divorced.

On January 18, 1936, Fletcher married a noted author of children&#x27;s books, Charlie May Simon. The two of them built &quot;Johnswood&quot;, a residence on the bluffs of the Arkansas River, then outside Little Rock. They traveled frequently to New York for the intellectual stimulation, and to the American West and South for the climate, after Fletcher developed chronic arthritis.

Fletcher suffered from depression, and on May 10, 1950, died by suicide by drowning himself in a pond near his home in Little Rock, Arkansas. Fletcher is buried at historic Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock. A branch of the Central Arkansas Library System is named in his honor.

==Poetry==

In 1913 Ezra Pound in his &quot;New Freewoman&quot; review commended Fletcher for the individuality of rhythm in his first volume of poems. Those early works include &quot;Irradiations: Sand and Spray&quot; (1915), and &quot;Goblins and Pagodas&quot; (1916). Amy Lowell said of him, &quot;No one is more absolute master of the rhythm of verse libre&quot;. Fletcher invented the term &#x27;polyphonic prose&#x27; to describe some poetic experiments of Amy Lowell, a form he experimented with in &quot;Goblins &amp; Pagodas&quot;. In later poetic works Fletcher returned to more traditional forms. These include &quot;The Black Rock&quot; (1928), &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1938), for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1939, &quot;South Star&quot; published by Macmillan (1941), and &quot;The Burning Mountain&quot; (1946). Fletcher later moved back to Arkansas to reconnect with his roots. The subject of his works turned increasingly towards Southern issues and traditionalism.

In the late 1920s and 1930s Fletcher was active with a group of Southern writers and poets known as the Southern Agrarians. This group published the classic Agrarian manifesto &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand&quot;, a collection of essays rejecting Modernity and Industrialism. In 1937 he wrote his autobiography, &quot;Life is My Song&quot;, and in 1947 he published &quot;Arkansas&quot;, a history of his home state.

Johnswood, his Little Rock home, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Raymond Sydney Ginger (October 16, 1924 – January 3, 1975) was an American historian, author, and biographer of wide-ranging scholarship whose special focus was on labor history, economic history, and the epoch often called the Gilded Age. His biography of the American labor leader and socialist Eugene Victor Debs is widely considered definitive, and his account of the Scopes trial has also received high praise. Both titles are still in print, and both, along with many of his other works, have been widely used in college courses across the United States.

==Early life==
Ginger was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the fourth son and next-to-last child of an affluent Southern family that moved to Indiana (Debs&#x27; home state) while he was very young. The family soon plunged into abject poverty with the Great Depression. After four years &quot;squatting&quot; in a series of unoccupied houses in Greencastle while their eldest son attended DePauw college, the Ginger family settled in Indianapolis, still in extremely difficult circumstances. These experiences deeply influenced Ray Ginger&#x27;s political convictions and much of his historical work: in later life he frequently recounted his childhood humiliation when sent to collect the bag of flour that was the only form of public welfare available, and also the intense personal rage that dominated his youth.

==Education==
Despite his troubled childhood, and the resulting troubled personality, he was accepted to both Harvard College and the University of Chicago before his 17th birthday. He later joked that he chose Chicago in the belief that it would be easier to augment his scholarship with part-time employment &quot;in a big city like Chicago than in a small town like Cambridge.&quot; He didn&#x27;t think to look at a map, and wouldn&#x27;t have dreamed of asking for advice. At Chicago he soon took a step towards fulfilling his supreme ambition at that time—to become a sportswriter—by landing a post as a copyboy at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;—&quot;the only time my father was ever really proud of me.&quot; As the United States entered World War II, most of the reporters became foreign correspondents, and Ginger was promoted to a writing job in the city room.

His journalistic career was ended by the military draft, but the interruption to his academic education proved only temporary. Soon after basic training, Military Intelligence sent him to the University of Michigan for Japanese language training, where he met his first wife, later civil-liberties lawyer Ann Fagan Ginger. Ginger was next a code-breaker near Washington—work for which an education in statistical analysis would have been more appropriate than linguistic studies. There, in the closing days of the war, he joined the Communist Party, thinking the revolution was just around the corner.

His interest in Eugene Debs had already begun to crystallize into a determination to write a definitive biography, drawing on both archival sources and interviews with some of the many individuals then living who had known Debs well. Fortunately the recently enacted GI Bill provided an easy means of support for this enterprise. Ann Arbor, which was close to his wife&#x27;s family home and where he had already accumulated academic credits while studying Japanese, seemed the obvious place to begin; he completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree there, and then (the book not being finished) stayed for a master&#x27;s degree in economics. Still drawing on GI benefits in the cause of literature, he then entered a Ph.D program in American Studies at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio (now Case Western Reserve University), where he completed &quot;The Bending Cross&quot; (Rutgers University Press, 1949). This classic biography met great critical acclaim, including an assessment by the eminent American historian Henry Steele Commager as &quot;the best biography of Debs.&quot; It has almost never been out of print in the intervening years; Haymarket Books issued the most recent edition in 2006.

==Academic career and blacklisting==
After earning a Western Reserve Ph.D. in 1951 after having his published biography accepted as his dissertation, Ginger took up a post at Harvard Business School as editor of the &quot;Business History Review&quot;, with a little teaching on the side. Besides his editorial duties there, he wrote numerous scholarly articles in economics, labor history, and business history, researched a projected biography of Clarence Darrow, and enjoyed every prospect for a distinguished academic career.

The McCarthy Era ended his time at Harvard. When it seemed probable that both Ginger and his wife might be subpoenaed by the Massachusetts equivalent of the U.S. House Committee on Unamerican Activities, on June 16, 1954, Harvard University officials threatened him with immediate dismissal despite his three-year contract if he did not sign an oath declaring that he was not a member of the Communist Party. They required a similar oath from his wife, who had no connection to the university. When Ginger instead chose to resign, Harvard insisted that he leave the state immediately as a condition of receiving the two weeks salary remaining on his existing contract.

Ginger, his pregnant wife, and their small son went to New York on two days notice to stay with relatives they had never met. Ann Ginger gave birth as a charity patient, and the marriage came to a rancorous halt not long thereafter. Ginger worked in New York for the next six years, first in advertising and then as an editor at the book publishers Alfred A. Knopf and Henry Holt. He remarried in 1956 and published of two works of history, &quot;Altgeld&#x27;s America&quot; and &quot;Six Days or Forever?&quot;. He remained bitter for being ejected from the academic world and then apparently blacklisted.

==Later career==
In 1960, Brandeis University offered him an assistant professorship in the history department. He stayed there for six years, becoming a tenured full professor, chairing the Committee on American Civilization, writing several more books, coaching the tennis team, and evolving rare pedagogical gifts. This remarkable talent received tangible acknowledgment many years after his death, when a former student (William Friedman, Brandeis &#x27;65), raised $2.5 million to endow the Ray Ginger Professorship of History at the university.

After leaving Brandeis in 1966, Ginger taught briefly at Stanford University and moved on to tenured positions at Wayne State University in Detroit and the University of Calgary, in Alberta, Canada. He died in Boston in 1975 of complications from acute alcoholism, survived by his third wife and two sons from his first marriage. Most of his papers were presented to the Labor History Archives at Wayne State University, where they are available for scholarly consultation.

==Continuing controversy==
The details of Ginger&#x27;s dismissal from Harvard remain unclear.

In September 2000, Ann Fagan Ginger wrote a letter to the Harvard Board of Overseers demanding an apology for Harvard&#x27;s actions. She also made public FBI files that document Ginger&#x27;s account of being required to sign an oath. It was the first documented instance in which Harvard had made such a demand. Harvard had publicly announced it would remove members of the Communist Party but not those who refused to answer questions about party affiliation. Harvard replied a few months later, admitting that Ginger had been forced out but not apologizing. Board of Overseers President Sharon Gagnon wrote: &quot;I would not presume to ... second-guess the motives or judgments of individuals in that difficult time. It seems clear, however, that Harvard took an action in the case of Mr. Ginger that many thoughtful people today, looking back, would not find appropriate.&quot; Ann Ginger found the response insufficient and said Harvard needed a truth and reconciliation commission to make it face what it had done.

Francis Boyle, law professor at the University of Illinois, and a 1976 graduate of Harvard Law School, has led a national campaign to lobby Harvard to conduct a public inquiry, issue a meaningful apology, and endow a chair in the Gingers&#x27; name for the study of peace, justice, and human rights.

<text>Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport is one of two international airports serving Shanghai, China.

The airport is located near the town of Hongqiao in the outskirts of Changning and Minhang districts, west of downtown, and is closer to the city center than Shanghai–Pudong.

Hongqiao Airport is the corporate headquarters and a major hub for China Eastern Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, and Juneyao Air, as well as a major hub for Spring Airlines. In 2023, Hongqiao Airport handled 42,492,745 passengers, making it the 7th busiest airport in China and the 43rd busiest in the world. By the end of 2011, Hongqiao Airport hosted 22 airlines serving 82 scheduled passenger destinations. Shanghai Hongqiao Airport was also certified with the Skytrax 5-Star Airport Rating for facilities, terminal comfort and cleanliness, shopping, food &amp; beverages, and staff service in 2019.

Hongqiao Airport served as Shanghai&#x27;s primary airport until the completion of Pudong International Airport on 1 October 1999, when most international flights were gradually moved to Pudong.

== History ==

The construction of Hongqiao airport started in 1921. In May 1923, the airport opened for mixed civilian use. The Chinese Air Force deployed fighter-attack planes to Hongqiao in an operational response to the Shanghai Incident of 1932, and engaging Japanese carrier-based planes for the first time that day. In 1937, Hongqiao was the site of the so-called &#x27;Oyama Incident&#x27; in which a Japanese lieutenant was shot dead by Chinese Peace Preservation Corps soldiers in the lead-up to the Battle of Shanghai. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the airport was occupied by the Japanese and used as an air force base. Its military use continued after being handed over to the Republic of China government and, later, the People&#x27;s Republic of China government. From late 1963, it was rebuilt for civilian use, and was re-opened in April 1964. A major expansion took place from March to September 1984, and another from December 1988 to December 1991.

=== International era (1964–1999) ===
In 1964, the original Terminal 1 and the control tower opened to public. The terminal was entirely built by China itself and was advanced for its time, equipped with many modern facilities such as barbershops, bookstores, banks, cafes, telecommunication offices, canteens, and even a hotel. The first international charter flight to Hongqiao was Pakistan International Airlines Boeing 720 from Dhaka with a stopover from Guangzhou, making it one of the very few non-communist airlines to fly into China before the Cultural Revolution. In the mid-1960s, Air France and Lufthansa both began service directly from Phnom Penh; however they were both suspended not long after. In 1972, the airport was visited by U.S. President Richard Nixon using an Air Force One before flying to Peking during his visit to China.

In 1974, Japan Airlines began services from Haneda to Hongqiao. In 1979, CAAC Airlines began services from Hongqiao to Nagasaki using a Boeing 707 aircraft; by 1985, a Trident was used for just two flights a week. After China&#x27;s reform and opening up in 1978, it then evolved into one of the busiest airports in China, alongside Beijing-Capital, particularly due to increasing passenger demand. Since 1981, Hongqiao Airport became a popular stopover for many airlines flying from Beijing to many other countries such as Canada, Japan and United States in particular. In 1985, Airbus-built aircraft started having hubs in this airport, due to it being delivered to the CAAC&#x27;s Shanghai division (which would then become China Eastern Airlines). Additionally, at that same decade, many foreign airlines like Pan Am, United Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Cathay Pacific (Dragonair replaced the Hong Kong-Shanghai route sometime in the early 1990s), Canadian Pacific Air Lines (which then became Canadian Airlines International) began operating in Hongqiao around that time. During its international era, Hongqiao Airport was much different compared to today. It only had one runway at the time, Terminal 1 was its main terminal, and its former control tower was renovated sometime after Pudong Airport opened.

In the 1990s, many more foreign airlines began serving the airport compared to the previous decade. Examples are All Nippon Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Thai Airways International, Swissair, Air France, Malaysia Airlines, Korean Air, Garuda Indonesia, Air Macau, Royal Nepal Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Aeroflot, and Qantas.

=== Domestic era (2002–present) ===
The airport presently offers mainly domestic flights with the exception of the cities in Northeast China (except Shenyang (MU and FM fly once daily) and Harbin (MU flies once daily), Baotou, Tongren, Zhanjiang, Zhangjiajie and some smaller cities (which all are operating at Pudong Airport only), as well as five international routes to central Tokyo&#x27;s Haneda Airport, central Seoul&#x27;s Gimpo International Airport, central Taipei Songshan Airport, Hong Kong International Airport, and Macau&#x27;s Macau International Airport. Previously, there were flights to Huaian from the airport until all flights to Huai&#x27;an were moved to Pudong Airport in May 2018.

Since 1 January 2013, holders of valid passports issued by 45 countries have not needed a visa if transiting through Hongqiao Airport.

In preparation for the Shanghai Expo, on 16 March 2010, Hongqiao Airport completed a five-year 15.3-billion-yuan expansion project, which included a second runway and the new Terminal 2, boosting Hongqiao&#x27;s capacity to 40 million passengers a year. Terminal 2 is four times the size of Terminal 1 and houses almost 80% of domestic airlines at the airport (Terminal 1 is now used only for international flights, Spring Airlines, Hebei Airlines and XiamenAir). With the new runway, Shanghai became the first city in China to have five (now seven) runways for civilian use (Pudong and Hongqiao combined).

Starting from the end of 2014, Hongqiao Airport Terminal 1 underwent its biggest renovation since 1921. The entire project was scheduled for completion in 2017. On 26 March 2017, Building A of Terminal 1 was fully renovated and reopened to the public. The old Building B was closed for reconstruction, and it was expected to be revamped and open to the public in mid-2018.

International flights were suspended on 25 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From 25 March 2020, all flights from the airport were domestic to other cities in mainland China. International flights resumed from the airport on 26 March 2023.

== Other facilities ==

The airport has the head office of China Eastern Airlines, which is housed in the China Eastern Airlines Building, and was the head office of China Cargo Airlines.

== Accidents and incidents ==
*On 17 September 1982, Japan Airlines Flight 792, a Douglas DC-8-61 bearing registration JA8048 en route to Tokyo Narita Airport, made an emergency landing, overran the runway and crashed into a drainage ditch after the hydraulic system and airbrake pressure failed. Of the 223 passengers and crew on board, there were 39 injuries.
*On 15 August 1989, a China Eastern Airlines Antonov An-24, bearing the registration B-3417 and en route to Nanchang, crashed on takeoff due to an engine failure. Of the 40 occupants, 6 survived.
*On 10 September 1998, China Eastern Airlines Flight 586, an MD-11 bearing registration B-2173, made an emergency landing at the airport after the landing gear had not retracted properly while en route to Beijing. Of the 137 occupants on board, nobody was killed. The footage subsequently has been uploaded to YouTube.
*On 15 April 1999, Korean Air Lines Flight 6316, an MD-11F bearing registration HL7373, crashed shortly after takeoff from Hongqiao Airport to Seoul. After takeoff, the first officer contacted Shanghai Departure, which cleared the flight to climb to . When the aircraft climbed to in the corridor, the captain, after receiving two wrong affirmative answers from the first officer that the required altitude should be , thought that the aircraft was too high. The captain then pushed the control column abruptly and roughly forward causing the plane to enter a rapid descent. Both crew members tried to recover from the dive but were unable. All three occupants onboard and five people on the ground were killed.
*On 13 August 2011, Qatar Airways Flight 888, a Boeing 777-300ER en route from Doha International Airport to Shanghai&#x27;s other international airport, Shanghai Pudong International Airport declared a low-fuel emergency and elected to divert to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. Air traffic control at Hongqiao ordered Juneyao Airlines Flight 1112, en route from Shenzhen Bao&#x27;an International Airport to Hongqiao, to terminate its approach and allow the Qatar Airways Boeing 777-300ER to land. The pilot of Juneyao Air Flight 1112 ignored repeated orders to abort their landing and give Flight 888 priority, ultimately forcing the Qatar Airways flight to go-around. Both aircraft landed safely without injury or damage to the aircraft. The incident led to penalties to Juneyao Airlines and the crew of the Juneyao plane by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, including the permanent revocation of the pilot&#x27;s license in China.
*On 7 June 2013, China Eastern Airlines Flight 2947, an Embraer EMB-145LI flying from Huai&#x27;an Lianshui Airport to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport veered off of runway 18L at Hongqiao during landing. The plane came to a stop on an adjacent taxiway with its nose gear collapsed. No passengers or crew suffered any injuries, however, the plane received substantial damage.
*On 11 October 2016, China Eastern Airlines Flight 5643, an Airbus A320 (Registration B-2337), nearly collided with Flight MU5106 of the same airline, an Airbus A330, when the former was taking off on runway 36L while the latter was crossing the same runway under wrong instruction. The former performed a TOGA takeoff, managed to climb over the latter, and avoided a collision.

== Ground transportation ==

Terminal 2 of the Hongqiao Airport is immediately adjacent to Shanghai Hongqiao railway station, a major train hub served by the Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway, the Shanghai–Hangzhou High-Speed Railway and the Shanghai–Nanjing Intercity High-Speed Railway. The airport&#x27;s other terminal, Terminal 1, is across the airfield from Terminal 2.

The airport and the railway station are served by three stations of the metro network:

* Hongqiao Railway Station: Line 2, Line 10, Line 17
* Hongqiao Airport Terminal 2 station: Line 2, Line 10, Airport Link Line
* Hongqiao Airport Terminal 1 station: Line 10

The proposed extension of the Shanghai Maglev Train from Longyang Road through Shanghai South railway station to Hongqiao would connect the two airports. At top speed, the maglev would take only 15 minutes to travel the route. Original plans called for completing the extension by 2010, in time for the Expo 2010; however, the Hongqiao extension has been indefinitely postponed due to protests. Another connection to Shanghai Pudong Airport was established in December 2024 with the Airport Link Line.

<text>The Southern Agrarians were twelve American Southerners who wrote an agrarian literary manifesto in 1930. They and their essay collection, &quot;I’ll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition&quot;, contributed to the Southern Renaissance, the reinvigoration of Southern literature in the 1920s and 1930s. They were based at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. John Crowe Ransom was their unofficial leader, though Robert Penn Warren became their most prominent member. The membership overlaps with The Fugitives.

==Members==
The twelve authors of the Southern Agrarians manifesto, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand&quot;, were:
*Donald Davidson, poet, essayist, reviewer and historian
*John Gould Fletcher, poet and historian
*Henry Blue Kline
*Lyle H. Lanier
*Andrew Nelson Lytle, poet, novelist and essayist
*Herman Clarence Nixon
*Frank Lawrence Owsley, historian
*John Crowe Ransom, poet, professor, essayist
*Allen Tate, poet
*John Donald Wade, biographer and essayist
*Robert Penn Warren, poet, novelist, essayist and critic, later first poet laureate of the United States
*Stark Young, novelist, drama and literary critic, playwright

Other writers associated with the Agrarians include Richard M. Weaver, Caroline Gordon, Brainard Cheney and Herbert Agar.

==Background and general ideas==
The Agrarians evolved from a philosophical discussion group known as the &quot;Fugitives&quot; or &quot;Fugitive Poets&quot;. Many of the Southern Agrarians and Fugitive poets were connected to Vanderbilt University, either as students or as faculty members. Davidson, Lytle, Ransom, Tate, and Warren all attended the university; Davidson and Ransom later joined the faculty, along with Wade and Owsley. They were known also as &quot;Twelve Southerners&quot;, the &quot;Vanderbilt Agrarians&quot;, the &quot;Nashville Agrarians&quot;, the &quot;Tennessee Agrarians&quot;, and the &quot;Fugitive Agrarians&quot;.

They were offended by H. L. Mencken&#x27;s attacks on aspects of Southern culture that they valued, such as its agrarianism, conservatism, and religiosity. They sought to confront the widespread and rapidly increasing effects of modernity, urbanism, and industrialism on American (but especially Southern) culture and tradition. The Agrarians were influenced by the medievalism of Victorian writers Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin and William Morris, as well as the French right-wing tradition that began with Counter-Enlightenment philosopher Joseph de Maistre, which they accessed through the writings of contemporaries T. E. Hulme, T. S. Eliot and Charles Maurras. The informal leader of the Fugitives and the Agrarians was John Crowe Ransom, but in a 1945 essay, he announced that he no longer believed in either the possibility or the desirability of an Agrarian restoration, which he declared a &quot;fantasy&quot;.

=== &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand&quot; ===

&quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand&quot; was criticized at the time, and since, as a reactionary and romanticized defense of the Old South and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. It ignored slavery and denounced &quot;progress&quot;, for example, and some critics considered it to be moved by nostalgia.
A key quote from the &quot;Introduction: A Statement of Principles&quot; to their 1930 book &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition&quot;:

Though the book was reviewed widely, it only sold about 2000 copies as of 1940. It has been reprinted several times. The current edition was published by Louisiana State University Press in 2006 to mark the book&#x27;s 75th anniversary.

===Other publications===
Most of the Southern Agrarians contributed to a second collection of essays, &quot;Who Owns America?&quot; (1936), which also included writings from English distributists.

The Agrarians were the most prolific contributors to &quot;The American Review&quot;, edited by Seward Collins. Various Agrarians contributed as many as 70 articles, led by Donald Davidson with 21. Scholar Louis Menand has identified many of their contributions as influential in spreading the idea of New Criticism to the United States from Britain.

Collins eventually became a public supporter of fascism. Several of the Agrarians came to regret (and renounce) their relationship with Collins, however, after his political views became better known. Agrarian Allen Tate wrote a rebuttal of fascism for the liberal &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 1936. Nevertheless, Tate remained in contact with Collins and continued to publish in &quot;The American Review&quot; until its demise, in 1937.

==Chapel Hill Sociologists==

In the 1930s, the Agrarians were challenged by the modernizing social scientists (the &quot;Chapel Hill Sociologists&quot;) based at the University of North Carolina (in Chapel Hill) and led by Howard W. Odum, on issues of urbanism, social progress, and the very nature and definition of the South. The sociologists produced Rupert Vance&#x27;s &quot;The Human Geography of the South&quot; (1932), and Odum&#x27;s &quot;Southern Regions of the United States&quot; (1936), as well as numerous articles in the journal &quot;Social Forces.&quot; The sociologists argued that the problems in the South stemmed from traditionalism which ought to and could be cured by modernization, the opposite of the Agrarian viewpoint.

==Robert Penn Warren==

Robert Penn Warren emerged as the most accomplished of the Agrarians. He became a major American poet and novelist, winning the Pulitzer Prize for his 1946 &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;.

At a reunion of the Fugitive Poets in 1956, Warren confessed that for about a decade — from just before World War II to some years after — he had shut Agrarianism from his mind as irrelevant to the cataclysmic social and political events then playing out in the world. Now, however, he believed that, rather than being irrelevant, his old Agrarian enthusiasms were tied into the major problems of the age. In the modern world, the individual had been marginalized, stripped of any sense of responsibility, or of past or place. &quot;In this context,&quot; writes Paul V. Murphy, &quot;the Agrarian image of a better antebellum South came to represent for Warren a potential source of spiritual revitalization. The past recalled, not as a mythical &#x27;golden age&#x27; but &#x27;imaginatively conceived and historically conceived in the strictest readings of the researchers&#x27;, could be a &#x27;rebuke to the present&#x27;.&quot;

It was Warren&#x27;s concern with democracy, regionalism, personal liberty and individual responsibility that led him to support the civil rights movement, which he depicted in his nonfiction works &quot;Segregation&quot; (1956) and &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?&quot; (1965) as a struggle for identity and individualism. As Hugh Ruppersburg, among others, has argued, Warren&#x27;s support for the civil rights movement paradoxically stemmed from Agrarianism, which by the 1950s, meant for him something very different from the Agrarianism of &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand&quot;. As Warren&#x27;s political and social views evolved, his notion of Agrarianism evolved with them. He came to support more progressive ideas and racial integration and was a close friend of the eminent African-American author Ralph Ellison. While Donald Davidson took a leading role in the attempt to preserve the system of segregation, Warren took his stand against it. As Paul V. Murphy writes, &quot;Loyalty to the southern past and the ambiguous lessons of Agrarianism led both men in very different directions.&quot;

==Legacy==
Louis D. Rubin Jr. assessed the Agrarians in 1979:In retrospect the importance of &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand&quot; lay in its vigorous reaffirmation of religious humanism and its farseeing critique of the abuses of unchecked industrial exploitation. In certain crucial respects it is far closer in spirit and intent to works such as Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot;, Edward Bellamy&#x27;s &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, and T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; in its rebuke to an acquisitive business society. This, and not its topical prescriptions for the southern economy of the day, largely accounts for its continuing importance.In 1981, University of Georgia Press published &quot;Why the South Will Survive: Fifteen Southerners Look at Their Region a Half Century after&quot; I&#x27;ll Take My Stand, with contributions from Donald L. Anderson (1932–2004), M. E. Bradford, Cleanth Brooks, Thomas Fleming, Samuel T. Francis, George Garrett, William C. Havard, Hamilton C. Horton Jr., Thomas H. Landess, Marion Montgomery, John Shelton Reed, George C. Rogers Jr., David B. Sentelle, and Clyde N. Wilson, with an afterword by Lytle.

In recent decades, some American traditional conservatives such as Allan C. Carlson, Joseph Scotchie, and Eugene Genovese have praised the Agrarian themes in light of what they see as the failures of highly urbanized and industrialized modern societies.

Today, the Southern Agrarians are regularly lauded in neo-Confederate media such as the &quot;Southern Partisan&quot;. Some of their social, economic, and political ideas have been refined and updated by writers such as Allan C. Carlson and Wendell Berry. The Intercollegiate Studies Institute has published books which further explore the ideas of the Agrarians.

<doc id="295735" wikidata="Q520478" url="?curid=295735" title="Chibchan languages">
<text>The Chibchan languages (also known as Chibchano) make up a language family indigenous to the Isthmo-Colombian Area, which extends from eastern Honduras to northern Colombia and includes populations of these countries as well as Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. The name is derived from the name of an extinct language called &quot;Chibcha&quot; or &quot;Muisca&quot;, once spoken by the people who lived on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense of which the city of Bogotá was the southern capital at the time of the Spanish Conquista. However, genetic and linguistic data now indicate that the original heart of Chibchan languages and Chibchan-speaking peoples might not have been in Colombia, but in the area of the Costa Rica-Panama border, where the greatest variety of Chibchan languages has been identified.

==External relations==
A larger family called &quot;Macro-Chibchan&quot;, which would contain the Misumalpan languages, Xinca, and Lenca, was found convincing by Kaufman (1990).

Based primarily on evidence from grammatical morphemes, Pache (2018, 2023) suggests a distant relationship with the Macro-Jê languages.

==Language contact==
Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with the Andaki, Barbakoa, Choko, Duho, Paez, Sape, and Taruma language families due to contact.

==Classification==

The extinct languages of Antioquia, Old Catío and Nutabe have been shown to be Chibchan (Adelaar &amp; Muysken, 2004:49). The language of the Tairona is unattested, apart from a single word, but may well be one of the Arwako languages still spoken in the Santa Marta range. It is said to be used by the Kogi people as a shamanistic ritual language. The Zenú Sinú language of northern Colombia is also sometimes included, as are the Malibu languages, though without any factual basis.

Adolfo Constenla Umaña argues that Cueva, the extinct dominant language of Pre-Columbian Panama long assumed to be Chibchan based on a misinterpreted Kuna vocabulary, was actually Chocoan, but there is little evidence.

The Cofán language (Kofán, Kofane, A&#x27;i) of Ecuador and Colombia has been erroneously included in Chibchan due to borrowed vocabulary.

On the basis of shared grammatical innovations, Pache (2023) argues that Pech is most closely related to the Arhuacic languages of northern Colombia, forming a Pech-Arhuacic subgroup.

<text>Marguerite Vivian Young (August 26, 1908 – November 17, 1995) was an American novelist and academic. She is best known for her novel &quot;Miss MacIntosh, My Darling&quot;. In her later years, she was known for teaching creative writing and as a mentor to young authors. &quot;She was a respected literary figure as well as a cherished Greenwich Village eccentric.&quot; During her lifetime, Young wrote two books of poetry, two historical studies, one collection of short stories, one novel, and one collection of essays.

==Background==
Young was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. Through her father, Chester Ellis Young, she was a collateral descendant of Brigham Young, and by her mother, Fay Herron Knight, she was a direct descendant of John Knox.

Young&#x27;s parents separated when she was very young, and she and her sister, Naomi, were brought up by their maternal grandmother, Marguerite Herron Knight, who was convinced the child Marguerite was the reincarnation of her dead cousin, Little Harry. Her grandmother nurtured Young&#x27;s love of literature.

==Career==

===Education===

Young studied at Butler University in Indianapolis, receiving a BA in French and English. She then attended the University of Chicago, auditing Thornton Wilder&#x27;s writing class at his invitation. She also attended the University of Iowa.

In 1936, she earned her MA in the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period. She wrote her master’s thesis on &quot;Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit&quot; (1578) and &quot;Euphues and his England&quot; (1580) by John Lyly, which influenced her attitude towards nature, &quot;using birds and beasts for their symbolic value, their value as icons, as a way of saying things about people.&quot;

While attending the University of Chicago, Young had a part-time position reading Shakespeare to Minna K. Weissenbach. A patron of Edna St. Vincent Millay, Weissenbach was sometimes known as &quot;the opium lady of Hyde Park&quot; and she became the inspiration for the Opium Lady in Young&#x27;s &quot;Miss MacIntosh, My Darling.&quot; Drug-based flights of fantasy were to make their way into the novel.

Later, Young received a Ph.D. in philosophy and English from the University of Iowa, where she taught at the prestigious Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop.

===Teaching===

She briefly taught at Shortridge High School before embarking on a distinguished literary career. In New York she held a contract lectureship in English literature during the 1960s at Fordham University.

===Works===

Young&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;Prismatic Ground&quot;, was published in 1937, while she was teaching English at Shortridge High School in Indianapolis. In that same year, she visited the commune of New Harmony, Indiana, where her mother and stepfather resided.

After her MA, she taught at an Indianapolis high school and at the University of Iowa.

In 1943, she moved to New York, where she became known for her works &quot;Moderate Fable&quot; (1944) and &quot;Angel in the Forest&quot; (1945).

She relocated to New Harmony and spent seven years there, beginning work on &quot;Angel in the Forest&quot;, a study of utopian concepts and communities, at the same time producing &quot;Moderate Fable&quot; (1944), which won the poetry prize from the National Academy of Arts and Letters. &quot;Angel in the Forest&quot; appeared in 1945 and was well received, winning Guggenheim and Newberry Library awards.
Over the next fifty years, while maintaining an address in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, Young traveled extensively and was part of a wide literary circle that included Mari Sandoz, Richard Wright, Anaïs Nin, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Marianne Hauser and Allen Tate, with whom she had an affair. She also had a complex friendship with Carson McCullers and Truman Capote, with whom she published in the international literary magazine Botteghe Oscure, edited by Princess Marguerite Chapin Caetini. She wrote articles, poetry, and book reviews while also teaching creative writing at various venues, including the New School for Social Research, Fordham University, and the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop.In 1944, Scribners commissioned her to write a new work, ultimately published as the epic novel &quot;Miss MacIntosh, My Darling&quot; (1965). Although she had intended to take just two years, she did not finish her novel until 1963. Young described it as &quot;an exploration of the illusions, hallucinations, errors of judgment in individual lives, the central scene of the novel being an opium addict&#x27;s paradise.&quot; Anaïs Nin, in &quot;The Novel of the Future&quot;, calls it &quot;an epic American novel written in a poetic style.&quot; &quot;Miss MacIntosh, My Darling&quot; was not well received critically but developed a cult following.

Young&#x27;s next project was to be a biography of Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, the creator of &quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot;. Her experiences in joining the protests against the Vietnam War made her turn her focus to Riley&#x27;s friendship with Eugene V. Debs. The digression was to occupy the rest of her life, becoming an ambitious biography of Debs, the union organizer who evolved into the first Socialist candidate for President of the United States (1904, 1908, 1912, 1920). She projected a three-volume epic history of the people, through Debs&#x27;s battles for workers rights and the development of the Locomotive Firemen&#x27;s workers union. &quot;Harp Song for a Radical: The Life and Times of Eugene Victor Debs&quot; remained unfinished at the time of her death.

Part I, “Prelude in a Golden Key,” portrays Swiss agnostic Wilhelm Weitling’s cross-country tour of the pioneer utopian communities built during the settlement of the western United States. He visits the Mormon communities in Nauvoo, Illinois and Salt Lake City, Utah; the Shakers; the Amish communities in Pennsylvania; the Oneida community; the Icarians; the Rappites, and many other settlements in the wilderness. Through this perspective Young establishes that this nation was founded and settled on the principles of communal ownership and mutual assistance. In Part II of &quot;Harp Song for a Radical&quot;, Young establishes that Eugene Debs was the catalyst through which these principles became the basic tenets of the labor movement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

During Marguerite Young&#x27;s final illness, she was nursed by Marilyn Hamilton and Suzanne Oboler. Together, during this time, they compiled her unfinished manuscript and submitted it to her publisher. After her death, the manuscript was edited by Charles Ruas to include Young&#x27;s survey of utopian communities as well as her portraits of major historical figures encountered by Debs in his struggles as a labor organizer: the portraits of Mary Todd Lincoln, James Whitcomb Riley, Joe Hill, Sojourner Truth, Brigham Young, Joseph Smith and Susan B. Anthony. This edited version of &quot;Harp Song for a Radical&quot; was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1999. Also in her last illness, Marguerite Young returned to writing poetry.

&quot;Inviting the Muses,&quot; a collection of her stories, essays, and reviews, was published by Dalkey Archive Press in 1994. Her &quot;Collected Poems&quot; was published in 2022 by Chatwin Books/Sublunary Editions. Young’s papers are at the Beinecke Library, Yale University.

==Personal life and death==

When Marguerite Young became fully incapacitated, her niece, Daphne Nowling, came to New York from Indiana and took both Young and the contents of her Bleecker Street floor-through apartment—library, doll collection and all—to her own home in Indianapolis. There she recreated Young&#x27;s apartment, where she nursed her until the end. Young died on November 17, 1995, in Indianapolis, Indiana.

===Short fiction===
==Influences==
Starting in 1975, Charles Ruas produced for Pacifica radio station WBAI in New York a year-long series of readings from &quot;Miss MacIntosh, My Darling&quot; called The Reading Experiment. The readings were by Young&#x27;s contemporaries in the literary, theatre, and journalistic worlds, such as Leo Lerman, Wyatt Cooper, Osceola Archer, Marian Seldes, Ruth Ford, James Coco, Peggy Cass, and Earle Hyman. The artist Rob Wynne scored each program with concrete sound effects and atonal and harmonic music, as well as opera. The programs were distributed nationally through the Pacifica Radio Network. In 2014, David Weinstein, Director of the Clocktower Gallery, and Tennae Maki, restored the series and digitized it, making it available through Art International Radio&#x27;s Internet station &quot;Art on Air.&quot; Those recordings are now available on the Who Is Marguerite Young? website. Renewed interest in the book resulted in the publication in 1979 of a boxed two-volume paperback edition, with an Introduction by Anaïs Nin, by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, as well as a two-volume paperback edition in 1993 by Dalkey Archive. In 2024, Dalkey Archive Press published a new one-volume edition that, despite returning the novel to print after decades of unavailability, introduced numerous typographical errors into the text.

<text>Airdrie Savings Bank was a small commercial bank operation in the Lanarkshire area of Scotland. It ran nine branches throughout the area, with its head office in Airdrie at the time of the announcement of its closure. Total assets of the bank at 31 October 2013 were £158 million with a reported loss of £267,000. In January 2017, the bank announced it would begin closure proceedings on 28 April of that year.

==Corporate structure==
Airdrie Savings Bank was the only remaining independent savings bank in the UK. It operated on mutual principles, had no shareholders and was instead governed by a board of trustees, appointed to represent the interests of depositors and to ensure that the bank was managed properly.

In addition to Airdrie, there were branches in Bellshill and Coatbridge at the time of the announcement of its closure.

==History==

The first true savings bank was established by Rev. Henry Duncan in the Dumfriesshire village of Ruthwell in 1810. Duncan&#x27;s model was rapidly adopted across Scotland, the rest of the UK and continental Europe. In 1924 the world&#x27;s first International Thrift Congress was held in Milan and there were representatives there from 350 institutions around the world.

Airdrie Savings Bank was instituted in 1835 by the efforts of four “founding fathers” – Rev. John Carslaw (a local church minister and strong advocate of the temperance movement); Dr William Clark (a retired doctor and member of a wealthy old Airdrie family); Rev. Andrew Ferrier (another local minister); and James Knox (a local hat and cap manufacturer). The first board of directors included several weavers, a blacksmith, a schoolmaster, a stonemason, a tailor and a salesman. Indeed, the blacksmith was vice-president of the bank for over twenty years.

The first account was opened on 21 January 1835 with a deposit of £2 10s and by the end of 1835 a total of £355 had been deposited (over £ in ). The first branch was opened in the Session House of a local church but the church closed in 1841 and the bank moved to the shop premises of a tailor where it remained for twenty years before relocating to a hat shop. Finally, a purpose-built independent office was established in the town in 1883. By 1885 the bank total deposits had risen to £20,000 (£ million in ) and within a decade this figure increased ten-fold to £200,000 (£ million in ). At the same time the number of customers more than quadrupled from 1,100 to 4,600. Deposits continued to double every decade such that by 1916 they had reached the £1 million mark (£ million in ).
During the First World War the bank continued to expand, opening new branches in Coatbridge (1916) and Bellshill (1917). In 1925 the head office in Airdrie relocated to new premises at the bottom of Wellwynd in the town where it remains today. Further expansion in the 1930s resulted in new branches in Shotts and Muirhead (both 1931) and Ballieston (1936). A second Coatbridge branch, Whifflet followed in 1969, Motherwell in 1997 and Falkirk in 2011.

In August 2010 it was announced that a new branch would be opened after a cash injection of £10 million, from a group of Scottish entrepreneurs who support the bank&#x27;s mutual model. Sir Angus Grossart, Sir David Murray, Ann Gloag, Brian Souter, Sir Tom Farmer and Ewan Brown each provided £1 million. Soutar stated that &quot;Airdrie Savings Bank represents what Scottish banks once stood for – security of funds, a focus on savings and outstanding personal service&quot;. He went on to say that: &quot;We believe the mutual principle is fundamental to the integrity of the bank. We are doing this because so many Scots are dismayed at what has happened within the banking sector&quot;.

On 28 May 2015, the bank announced that the branches at Baillieston, Muirhead, Motherwell and Shotts would close on 28 August. The Falkirk branch closed in April 2016.

In January 2017, the board of trustees of Airdrie Savings Bank resolved that the bank should be wound up as a result of changing customer requirements and the increasing cost of regulation. The three remaining branches, including the head office, would close and customer deposits would be returned or transferred to other financial institutions. Mortgages and secured loans were to be transferred to TSB Bank plc, and any outstanding deposits were to be transferred to Wesleyan Bank.

== Resources for Scholars, Students, and Teachers ==

Beginning in 1944 with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Newberry began hosting researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds for both short- and long-term fellowships. These fellows form a close community during their time at the Newberry and continue to build their relationships with one another and with the library long after they leave. Researchers with long-term fellowships spend four to nine months at the Newberry. Researchers with short-term fellowships spend one to two months at the library. Newberry fellows often produce works that stems from their research at the library.

Examples of recent books by former Newberry fellows include:

*&quot;Only the Clothes on Her Back&quot; by Laura Edwards (Long-Term Fellow 2019-20) 
*&quot;Last Call at the Hotel Imperial&quot; by Deborah Cohen (Long-Term Fellow 2019-20) 
*&quot;Botanical Entanglements: Women, Natural Science, and the Arts in Eighteenth-Century England&quot; by Anna Katie Sagal (Long-Term Fellow 2017-18)

The library offers a series of content-based professional development seminars for teachers. Led by scholars and educators from the Chicagoland area and beyond, these humanities-focused seminars create space for teachers to connect with peers, explore the Newberry’s collection as scholars, and learn to use primary sources in the classroom.

The Newberry Library Undergraduate Seminar (NLUS) offers select students from DePaul University, Loyola University Chicago, Roosevelt University, and the University of Illinois Chicago the chance to participate in an intensive research seminar inspired by the Newberry’s collection. During their semester at the library, students attend seminar meetings and learn to conduct research. Students work closely with Newberry staff to form research questions before venturing into the archives on their own. The seminar culminates in a major research paper and presentation.

The Newberry is home to three research centers:

*Center for Renaissance Studies
*D’Arcy McNickle Center for American Indian and Indigenous Studies
*Hermon Dunlap Smith Center for the History of Cartography

==Early History==

The Newberry was established in 1887 as the result of a bequest by Walter Loomis Newberry, an early Chicago resident and business leader involved in banking, shipping, real estate, and other commercial ventures. Newberry died at sea in 1868, while on a trip to France. He included in his will a provision of funds for the creation of a &quot;free public library&quot; should his daughters die without heirs. They did, and so, following the death of Newberry&#x27;s widow, Julia Butler Newberry, in 1885, it was up to Newberry estate trustees William H. Bradley and Eliphalet W. Blatchford to bring the library to fruition.

Without much direction (Newberry did not leave behind many details regarding his vision for the library) and without its founder&#x27;s personal collection as a foundation (Newberry&#x27;s own collection of books perished in the Great Fire of 1871), the first officers and staff members were instrumental in forming the character of the Newberry.

The Newberry&#x27;s first librarian, William Frederick Poole, was a major figure in the library world when he came to the Newberry. Poole saw the Newberry as a blank canvas on which he could project his ideas, which included and perhaps found their most impassioned articulation in the design and construction of libraries. In 1887–88 it was located at 90 La Salle Street, in 1889–90 at 338 Ontario Street, and in 1890-93 at the northwest corner of State and Oak Streets. The present building, designed by Poole and architect Henry Ives Cobb (1859–1931), opened in 1893. It is located at 60 West Walton Street, across from Washington Square. It is a structure in the Spanish Romanesque architectural style, built of Connecticut granite.

Poole and Cobb feuded bitterly over their different visions for the library building. Poole favored a number of reading rooms with open shelving of materials that could be easily accessed by patrons; Cobb preferred the majestic grandiosity in vogue in Europe and the centralization of collection items. Poole&#x27;s influence with the library&#x27;s trustees coerced Cobb to temper the grand staircase he had envisioned and to accommodate open shelving. Over time, however, the open shelving would put too much strain on the Newberry&#x27;s staff and the security of its collections, and the library would convert to a centralized storage system.

Poole served as Newberry librarian until his death in 1894. Under his leadership, the library built broad reference collections that would be useful to many different Chicagoans, especially professionals and tradespeople. The Newberry&#x27;s medical department, created in 1890, is an example of this emphasis. Poole also steered the Newberry toward the acquisition of rare materials for use by professional scholars. Two &quot;en bloc&quot; acquisitions made during his tenure, the private collections of Henry Probasco and Count Pio Resse, yielded notable rarities in music and early printed specimens (incunables), as well as Shakespeare folios and editions of Homer, Dante, and Horace.

To focus its own collecting and to avoid the duplication of resources in Chicago at large, the Newberry entered into a cooperative agreement in 1896 with the Chicago Public Library and the John Crerar Library, by which each institution would specialize in certain fields of knowledge and areas of service. As a consequence, the Newberry came to specialize in the humanities, and the natural sciences became the province of the Crerar. The Newberry immediately transferred its holdings in this area, including its copy of Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Birds of America&quot;. The Newberry&#x27;s medical department was transferred to the Crerar in 1906.

== Newberry Library Award ==
In 1987, the Newberry established the Newberry Library Award in honor of its 100th anniversary. The Newberry Library Award is an honor bestowed to individuals, and in the case of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, organizations, who have made &quot;outstanding contributions to the humanities, particularly in fields of endeavor related to the Newberry’s collection.&quot; The award itself is a scale-sized model of the full-sized Virginio Ferrari sculpture created in 1987 called &quot;Umanitá&quot; that greets visitors as they enter the Newberry Library.

<text>SAP ASE (Adaptive Server Enterprise), originally known as Sybase SQL Server, and also commonly known as Sybase DB or Sybase ASE, is a relational model database server developed by Sybase Corporation, which later became part of SAP SE. ASE was developed for the Unix operating system, and is also available for Microsoft Windows.

In 1988, Sybase, Microsoft and Ashton-Tate began development of a version of SQL Server for OS/2, but Ashton-Tate later left the group and Microsoft went on to port the system to Windows NT. When the agreement expired in 1993, Microsoft purchased a license for the source code and began to sell this product as Microsoft SQL Server. MS SQL Server and Sybase SQL Server share many features and syntax peculiarities.

==History==
Bob Epstein left Britton Lee, Inc. to help found Sybase and carried a lot of the ideas from the hardware database with him, reasoning that standard hardware such as Intel, Motorola and Sun 32 and 64 bit processors running database software could advance much more rapidly than specialist hardware. 
Originally developed for Unix operating system platforms in 1987, Sybase Corporation&#x27;s primary relational database management system product was initially marketed under the name Sybase SQL Server. In 1988, SQL Server for OS/2 was co-developed for the PC by Sybase, Microsoft, and Ashton-Tate. Ashton-Tate divested its interest and Microsoft became the lead partner after porting SQL Server to Windows NT. Microsoft and Sybase sold and supported the product through version 4.2.1.

The key feature that made SQL Server attractive from the start was its high performance due to shared log writes, clustered indexes and a small memory footprint per user. As a result of these and other design features it performed well &quot;out of the box&quot;.

Sybase released SQL Server 4.2 in 1992. This release included internationalization and localization and support for symmetric multiprocessing systems.

In 1993, the co-development licensing agreement between Microsoft and Sybase ended, and the companies parted ways after an amicable solution was reached. Sybase wanted to develop on the Intel Unix platform and Microsoft wanted Windows specific solutions. As part of the agreement Sybase released the System 10 codeline to Microsoft and Microsoft gave up exclusive rights to Intel platforms. Both continuing to independently develop their respective versions of SQL Server. Sybase released Sybase SQL Server 10.0, which was part of the System 10 product family, which also included Back-up Server ( a very high performance parallel backup process), Replication Server ( to provide replicate sites), Navigation Server ( a shared nothing parallel server), Open Client/Server APIs, SQL Monitor, SA Companion and OmniSQL Gateway. Microsoft continued on with Microsoft SQL Server.

Sybase provides native low-level programming interfaces to its database server which uses a protocol called Tabular Data Stream. Prior to version 10, DBLIB (DataBase LIBrary) was used. Version 10 and onwards uses CTLIB (ClienT LIBrary).

In 1995, Sybase released SQL Server 11.0.
Starting with version 11.5 released in 1996, Sybase moved to differentiate its product from Microsoft SQL Server by renaming it to Adaptive Server Enterprise.
Sybase 11.5 added Asynchronous prefetch, case expression in sql, the optimizer can use a descending index to avoid the need for a worktable and a sort.
The Logical Process Manager was added to allow prioritization by assigning execution attributes and engine affinity.

In 1998, ASE 11.9.2 was rolled out with support for data pages locking, data rows (row-level locking), distributed joins and improved SMP performance. Indexes could now be 
created in descending order on a column, readpast concurrency option and repeatable read transaction isolation were added. A lock timeout option and task-to-engine affinity were added, 
query optimization is now delayed until a cursor is opened and the values of the variables are known.

In 1999, ASE 12.0 was released, providing support for Java, high availability and distributed transaction management. Merge joins were added, previous all joins were nested loop joins. In addition, cache partitions were added to improve performance.

In 2001, ASE 12.5 was released, providing features such as dynamic memory allocation, an EJB container, support for XML, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and LDAP. Also added was compressed backups, unichar UTF-16 support and multiple logical page sizes 2K, 4K, 8K, or 16K.

In 2005, Sybase released ASE 15.0. It included support for partitioning table rows in a database across individual disk devices, and &quot;virtual columns&quot; which are computed only when required. In ASE 15.0, many parameters that had been static (which required server reboot for the changes to take place) were made dynamic (changes take effect immediately). This improved performance and reduced downtime. For example, one parameter that was made dynamic was the &quot;tape retention in days&quot; (the number of days that the backup is kept on the tape media without overwriting the existing contents in the production environment).

On January 27, 2010, Sybase released ASE 15.5. It included support for in-memory and relaxed-durability databases, distributed transaction management in the shared-disk cluster, faster compression for backups as well as Backup Server Support for the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager. Deferred name resolution for user-defined stored procedures, FIPS 140-2 login password encryption, incremental data transfer, bigdatetime and bigtime datatypes and tempdb groups were also added.

In July 2010, Sybase became a wholly owned subsidiary of SAP America. On September 13, 2011, Sybase released ASE 15.7 at Techwave. It included support for: New Security features - Application Functionality Configuration Groups, a new threaded kernel, compression for large object (LOB) and regular data, End-to-End CIS Kerberos Authentication, Dual Control of Encryption Keys and Unattended Startup and extension for securing logins, roles, and password management, Login Profiles, ALTER... modify owner, External Passwords and Hidden Text, Abstract Plans in Cached Statements, Shrink Log Space, In-Row Off-Row LOB, using Large Object text, unitext, and image Datatypes in Stored Procedures, Using LOB Locators in Transact-SQL Statements, select for update to exclusively lock rows for subsequent updates within the same transaction, and for update-able cursors, Non-materialized, Non-null Columns with a default value, Fully Recoverable DDL (select into, alter table commands that require data movement, reorg rebuild), merge command, Expanded Variable-Length Rows, Allowing Unicode Noncharacters.

In April 2014, SAP released ASE 16. It included support for partition locking, CIS Support for HANA, Relaxed Query Limits, Query Plan Optimization with Star Joins, Dynamic Thread Assignment, Sort and Hash Join Operator improvements, Full-Text Auditing, Auditing for Authorization Checks Inside Stored Procedures, create or replace functionality, Query Plan and Execution Statistics in HTML, Index Compression, Full Database Encryption, Locking, Run-time locking, Metadata and Latch enhancements, Multiple Trigger support, Residual Data Removal, Configuration History Tracking, CRC checks for dump database and the ability to calculate the transaction log growth rate for a specified time period.
==Structure==
A single standalone installation of ASE typically comprises one &quot;dataserver&quot; and one corresponding &quot;backup server&quot;. In multi server installation many dataservers can share one backup server. A dataserver consists of system databases and user databases. Minimum system databases that are mandatory for normal working of dataserver are &#x27;master&#x27;, &#x27;tempdb&#x27;, &#x27;model&#x27;, &#x27;sybsystemdb&#x27; and &#x27;sybsystemprocs&#x27;. &#x27;master&#x27; database holds critical system related information that includes, logins, passwords, and dataserver configuration parameters. &#x27;tempdb&#x27; is used for storage of data that are required for intermediate processing of queries, and temporary data. &#x27;model&#x27; is used as a template for creating new databases. &#x27;sybsystemprocs&#x27; consists of system supplied stored procedures that queries system tables and manipulates data in them.

ASE is a single process multithreaded dataserver application.

==Editions==
SAP ASE currently has two &quot;editions&quot;, &quot;Enterprise edition&quot; and &quot;Platform edition&quot;. The &quot;Platform edition&quot; includes licenses enabling several unspecified features (probably the newer, in memory high performance options and the disaster recovery functionality (near synchronous replication to a hot spare)) 

The &quot;express edition&quot; (used to be free, but limited to four server engines and 50 GB of disk space per server) is no longer available after version 16.0 SP03. There was no public statement about this, but it is documented in SAP note 3231519. Instead of the express edition, a 90 day trial version of ASE is available

<text>Janine Louise Zwicky (born 10 May 1955) is a Canadian philosopher, poet, essayist, and musician. She was appointed to the Order of Canada in June 2022.

==Life and career==
Zwicky received her BA from the University of Calgary and earned her PhD at the University of Toronto in 1981 where her studies focussed on the philosophy of logic and science. She subsequently taught philosophy at Princeton University; philosophy and interdisciplinary humanities at the University of Waterloo; philosophy at the University of Western Ontario; philosophy, English, and creative writing at the University of New Brunswick; and philosophy at the University of Alberta.

Zwicky is Professor Emerita in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Victoria, where she taught both philosophy and interdisciplinary humanities courses from 1996 until 2009. She has served as a faculty member at the Banff Centre Writing Studio, has conducted numerous writing workshops, and served as an editor for Brick Books from 1985 to 2018. From 2017 through 2019, she was the series editor of Oskana Poetry and Poetics, an imprint of the University of Regina Press.

==Philosophy==

Zwicky&#x27;s philosophical work challenges the hegemonic status of logico-linguistic analysis in 20th and 21st century Anglo-American philosophy. She is a realist who aims to defeat analytic skepticism by exploring the relationship between philosophical and poetic thinking, and by developing the notions of &quot;resonance&quot; and &quot;lyric&quot; understanding in ontology and epistemology:

&quot;Lyric shares with the coherentists, pragmatists, and nihilists the view that foundationalism is intellectually bankrupt: that what analytic system cannot sustain is anything like the claim of naive realism. However, lyric shares with naive realism the view that skepticism is false. What it does not share is the view that it is demonstrably, within system, false.&quot; (&quot;Lyric Philosophy&quot; L264)

Her books, &quot;Lyric Philosophy&quot; and &quot;Wisdom &amp; Metaphor&quot;, discuss but also enact this idea of resonance. They consist of many voices that range across diverse disciplines, so that Zwicky&#x27;s aphoristic remarks on the left-hand pages are read with and against excerpts from the history of philosophy, musical scores, paintings, photographs, and poems on the right-hand pages. While Zwicky orders her remarks carefully and has a linear philosophical argument to make, each page is also designed to evoke remarks or images from other pages, prompting non-linear connections and directly demonstrating what she refers to as lyric structure, characterized by resonance.

Zwicky believes that Heraclitus, Plato, and Wittgenstein have purposefully constructed philosophical texts in this way before her. She cites Freud&#x27;s distinction between primary and secondary processes, as well as Max Wertheimer&#x27;s work in gestalt psychology, as support for the concepts she promotes. She references pieces of music, works of art, and natural eco-systems as objects that also exhibit lyric structure.

Zwicky presents logical analysis and lyric thinking as complementary and includes both in a broader, more total conception of reason. She believes that the Anglo-American notion of what constitutes good philosophy is excessively narrow, and criticizes Continental and poststructural views for their anti-realist vision of the world as nothing more than a projection of human thought and desire. Zwicky promotes balance, arguing that neglect of either logical or lyric thinking leads to our ontological, epistemological, ethical and environmental peril.

James O. Young, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Victoria has said: &quot;There&#x27;s a reasonable chance that people will be reading her work a century from now. This is something that one says about only a very small number of philosophers.&quot;

==Poetry==

Zwicky&#x27;s poetry is influenced by music in the classical European, blues, and jazz traditions. It also deals with the natural world, and has often been cited for its intense lyricism. &quot;Thirty-seven Small Songs and Thirteen Silences&quot; has appeared in Swedish (translated by Roy Isaakson; Palaver Press). Numerous individual poems have been translated into Czech, French, German, Serbian, Spanish and Italian.

Among her many accolades, both Zwicky&#x27;s &quot;Songs for Relinquishing the Earth&quot; and &quot;Robinson&#x27;s Crossing&quot; were shortlisted for Governor General&#x27;s Awards for Poetry. &quot;Songs for Relinquishing the Earth&quot; won the award in 1999. &quot;Robinson&#x27;s Crossing&quot; won the Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize in 2004.

Her 2011 book, &quot;Forge&quot;, was shortlisted for the 2012 Canadian Griffin Poetry Prize.

<doc id="295749" wikidata="Q1239798" url="?curid=295749" title="Donald Davidson (poet)">
<text>Donald Grady Davidson (August 8, 1893 – April 25, 1968) was an American poet, essayist, social and literary critic, and author. An English professor at Vanderbilt University from 1920 to 1965, he was a founding member of the Fugitives and the overlapping group Southern Agrarians, two literary groups based in Nashville, Tennessee. He was a supporter of segregation in the United States.

==Early life==
Davidson was born on August 8, 1893, in Campbellsville, Tennessee. His father, William Bluford Davidson, was &quot;a teacher and school administrator,&quot; and his mother, Elma Wells, was &quot;a music and elocution teacher.&quot; He had two brothers, John and William. Davidson received a classical education at Branham and Hughes Military Academy, a preparatory school in Spring Hill, Tennessee. He earned both his bachelor&#x27;s (1917) and master&#x27;s (1922) degrees at Vanderbilt University. He served as a lieutenant in the United States Army during World War I.

==Career==
Davidson was an English professor at Vanderbilt University from 1920 to 1965. While at Vanderbilt, Davidson became associated with the Fugitives, who met to read and criticize each other&#x27;s verse. Later, they founded a review of the same name, which launched the literary careers of the poets and critics John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren, the poet Laura Riding, and the poet and psychiatrist Merrill Moore. He enjoyed, for a time, a national reputation as a poet, in part due to the inclusion of his dramatic monologue, &quot;Lee in the Mountains&quot;, in early editions of the influential college literature textbook &quot;Understanding Poetry&quot;. Its editors were his former students Warren and Cleanth Brooks. From 1923 to 1930, Davidson reviewed books and edited the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot; book page, where he assessed more than 370 books.

Around 1930, Davidson began his association with the Southern Agrarians. He was chiefly responsible for the decision of the group to write essays, published as the Agrarian manifesto &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand&quot;. Davidson shared the Agrarians&#x27; distaste for industrial capitalism and its destructive effect on American culture. Davidson&#x27;s romantic outlook, however, led him to interpret Agrarianism as a straightforward politics of identity. &quot;American&quot; identity had become &quot;characterless and synthetic,&quot; he argued in 1933. He encouraged Americans to embrace their identities as &quot;Rebels, Yankees, Westerners, New Englanders or what you will, bound by ties more generous than abstract institutions can express, rather than citizens of an Americanized nowhere, without family, kin, or home.&quot; He was in favor of segregation.

In 1931, Davidson began a long association with Middlebury College&#x27;s Breadloaf School of English. He bought a house in Vermont where he did much of his later writing. He taught at the Breadloaf School every summer until his death. In 1939 his textbook, &quot;American Composition and Rhetoric&quot;, was published and widely adopted for English courses in American universities.

Perhaps most widely read of his writings today is Davidson&#x27;s two-volume history &quot;The Tennessee&quot; (1946 and 1948), in the &quot;Rivers of America&quot; series. The second volume is notable for its critique of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the impact of its dam-building and eminent domain land seizure on local society. Although originally a supporter of the New Deal, he was suspicious that the TVA was a plot of northern business interests to exploit and dominate the South. He denounced the TVA as an instrument of political collectivism, run by outsiders, designed to destroy the South&#x27;s traditions.

In 1952 his ballad opera, &quot;Singin&#x27; Billy&quot;, with music by Charles F. Bryan, was performed at the Vanderbilt Theater. His work as book page editor for the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot; was commemorated in 1963 with the publication of &quot;The Spyglass: Views and Reviews, 1924–1930&quot;. A comprehensive collection of his poetry, &quot;Poems: 1922–61&quot;, was published in 1966.

==Segregationist political activism==
Davidson was a proponent of racial segregation and racial inequality. In an essay defending segregation in &quot;The Sewanee Review&quot;, described by historian Paul V. Murphy as his major work on the topic, he wrote: &quot;The white South denies the Negro equal participation in society, not only because it does not consider him entitled to equality, but because it is certain that social mingling would lead to biological mingling, which it is determined to prevent, both for any given contemporary generation and for its posterity.&quot;

Davidson supported the 1948 presidential candidacy of Strom Thurmond, who was running as a Dixiecrat in opposition to President Harry Truman&#x27;s civil rights proposals. He joined the Tennessee States&#x27; Rights Committee in 1950, and became the chairman of the Tennessee Federation for Constitutional Government (TFCG), the local analogue of the White Citizens Councils, at its founding in 1955. Under his leadership, TFCG led the failed effort to oppose the desegregation of Nashville&#x27;s public schools. Davidson warned that if black students attended, &quot;The capital city of Tennessee would become an uneasy island of integration surrounded by a tumultuous ocean of protest and discontent.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Davidson married Theresa Sherrer, a legal scholar and artist, in June 1918. They had a daughter, who married Eric Bell, Jr. They resided at 410 Fairfax Avenue in Nashville. He died on April 25, 1968, at age 74, at his home. He was buried at the Calvary Cemetery in Nashville.

<text>Donald Herbert Davidson (March 6, 1917 – August 30, 2003) was an American philosopher. He served as Slusser Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1981 to 2003 after having also held teaching appointments at Stanford University, Rockefeller University, Princeton University, and the University of Chicago. Davidson was known for his charismatic personality and the depth and difficulty of his thought. His work exerted considerable influence in many areas of philosophy from the 1960s onward, particularly in philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and action theory. While Davidson was an analytic philosopher, with most of his influence lying in that tradition, his work has attracted attention in continental philosophy as well, particularly in literary theory and related areas.

==Personal life==
Davidson was married three times. His first wife was the artist Virginia Davidson, with whom he had his only child, a daughter, Elizabeth (Davidson) Boyer. Following his divorce from Virginia Davidson, he married for the second time to Nancy Hirschberg, Professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and later at Chicago Circle. She died in 1979. In 1984, Davidson married for the third and last time, to philosopher Marcia Cavell. He corresponded with Catholic nun, literary critic and poet M. Bernetta Quinn.

== Swampman ==
Swampman is the subject of a philosophical thought experiment introduced by Donald Davidson in his 1987 paper &quot;Knowing One&#x27;s Own Mind&quot;. In the experiment, Davidson is struck by lightning in a swamp and disintegrated; simultaneously, an exact copy of Davidson, the Swampman, is made from a nearby tree and proceeds through life exactly as Davidson would have, indistinguishable from Davidson. The experiment is used by Davidson to claim that thought and meaning cannot exist in a vacuum; they are dependent on their interconnections to the world. Therefore, despite being physically identical to himself, Davidson states that the Swampman does not have thoughts nor meaningful language, as it has no causal history to base them on.

The experiment runs as follows:

<doc id="295757" wikidata="Q1084074" url="?curid=295757" title="Mystery Men">
<text>Mystery Men is a 1999 American superhero comedy film directed by Kinka Usher (in his feature-length directorial debut), written by Neil Cuthbert, loosely based on Bob Burden&#x27;s &quot;Flaming Carrot Comics&quot;, starring Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, William H. Macy, Greg Kinnear, Claire Forlani, Kel Mitchell, Paul Reubens, Janeane Garofalo, Wes Studi, Geoffrey Rush, Lena Olin, Eddie Izzard, and Tom Waits. The film details the story of a team of lesser superheroes with unimpressive powers who are required to save the day from a criminal genius when Champion City&#x27;s resident superhero gets captured.

&quot;Mystery Men&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $33 million worldwide against a $68 million budget.

==Plot==
In Champion City, the amateur superhero team of Mr. Furious, the Shoveler and the Blue Raja attempt to make a name for themselves, but their inexperience, infighting, and dubious abilities generally result in defeat and frustration. While trying to stop a robbery in progress, they are upstaged by the city&#x27;s powerful and arrogant superhero, Captain Amazing.

However, Amazing&#x27;s crime fighting prowess has practically made his job obsolete. Without any worthy adversaries (most are either dead, in exile, or in jail), his corporate sponsors are beginning to withdraw support. To create a need for his services, Amazing uses his alter ego, billionaire lawyer Lance Hunt, to argue for the release of his nemesis, supervillain Casanova Frankenstein, from an insane asylum. However, the plan backfires; once released and reunited with his henchman Tony P and his Disco Boys, Casanova Frankenstein blows up the asylum, easily outwits and captures Amazing, and prepares to unleash the &quot;Psycho-frakulator&quot;, which lethally bends reality, on the city.

On a stakeout of Casanova Frankenstein&#x27;s mansion, Mr. Furious observes Amazing&#x27;s capture and informs his team. After an unsuccessful rescue attempt, the three realize that they need more allies. Through word-of-mouth and auditions they recruit Invisible Boy, the Spleen, and the Bowler. The emboldened team ambush Casanova&#x27;s limousine, but merely succeed in annoying him.

While drunk from celebrating their “victory,” the team is nearly killed in retaliation by Tony P and the Disco Boys. They are saved by the Sphinx, an enigmatic superhero who agrees to train them. The Sphinx&#x27;s unconventional team-building exercises and antimetabole rhetoric annoy Mr. Furious, who quits the group, but the others flourish under his tutelage. Knowing that they will still be outgunned, the group seek out Doc Heller, who specializes in non-lethal weaponry, to equip them for their battle. Furious, encouraged by his new girlfriend, Monica, rejoins the team.

The team break into Casanova&#x27;s mansion during a summit of several of the city&#x27;s gangs like the Disco Boys, the Furriers, the Frat Boys, the Not-So-Goody Mob, the Suits, and the Susies. While attempting to free Captain Amazing, they become confused by his instructions as well as agitated by his condescending attitude, and inadvertently set off the Psycho-frakulator; graphically killing him. Without Amazing, the team despairs of saving the city, but the Shoveler delivers a pep talk which inspires them to continue.

With new resolve, the team assaults the mansion again. This time, through a mix of surprise, teamwork, maximizing their quasi-superpowers, and use of Heller&#x27;s quirky weapons, they subdue Casanova Frankenstein&#x27;s henchmen. However, Casanova Frankenstein holds Monica hostage and activates the Psycho-frakulator, which begins to wreak havoc upon the city. While the team works to disable the device, Mr. Furious takes on Casanova Frankenstein, unleashes his inner rage and fights effectively for the first time.

Mr. Furious throws Casanova Frankenstein into the core of the Psycho-frakulator which kills him with its reality-bending powers. The rest of the team helps The Bowler to destroy the device and escape the mansion as it implodes.

The team is swarmed by reporters who want to know the group&#x27;s name. As they argue possible names among themselves, one reporter states, &quot;Well, whatever you may call them, Champion City will forever owe a debt of gratitude to these &#x27;Mystery Men&#x27;,&quot; but they are too busy arguing to hear it.

==Cast==
Additionally, Corbin Bleu and Philip Bolden respectively appear as Butch and Roland, the Shoveler and Lucille&#x27;s sons. Television personality Riki Rachtman and filmmaker Michael Bay appear as part of the evil Frat Boys. Composer Mark Mothersbaugh appears as the band leader at the beginning of the film while a then unknown Sung Kang has a brief appearance. During the superhero auditions, Dane Cook, Doug Jones, Vincent Bowman, and Dana Gould make cameo appearances as The Waffler, Pencilhead, Son of Pencilhead, and Squeegeeman.

==Production==

===Development===
In 1997, Mike Richardson, publisher of Dark Horse Comics, pitched the &quot;Mystery Men&quot; concept to producers Larry Gordon and Lloyd Levin at Universal. &quot;My first impression was just how relatable the characters are,&quot; Levin said &quot;Bob [Burden] has a real surrealistic sensibility, but at the core of his work is something that&#x27;s thematically so identifiable. I think there is an almost childlike persistence of all the characters. And they ultimately hold on to the conviction that with courage and sacrifice, they can become what they dream.&quot;

The film was announced in mid-1997 along with a raft of comic book adaptations including &quot;Blade, Virus, Superman Lives, X-Men, The Fantastic Four, The Hulk, Captain America, The Sub-Mariner, Iron Man, Daredevil and Silver Surfer, Hellboy, Concrete, Green Hornet&quot; and 26 other titles.

===Casting===
That fall, Danny DeVito was in talks for a $13-million deal to both star and direct, but negotiations broke down over who would produce the soundtrack. &quot;It was a big deal for me,&quot; DeVito said. &quot;I really wanted it, so I walked away from the project.&quot; Ben Stiller was then approached to rewrite the script and direct but eventually turned it down. &quot;I decided I didn&#x27;t want to do it,&quot; he explained, &quot;because it was just too much. It was a huge movie I&#x27;d be taking on.&quot;

Commercial director Kinka Usher was signed in April 1998 to direct. Usher had won awards for the &quot;Got Milk?&quot; and Taco Bell Chihuahua campaigns. Usher, who had been approached for other films, was discouraged when he saw the script for &quot;Mystery Men&quot;. &quot;I thought it was boring,&quot; he said. &quot;However, the premise was great.&quot; He continued, &quot;Most of the movies made by commercial directors are heavy on visuals and thin on content. I don&#x27;t want to be a part of that. I was very cognizant of showing that I know how to work with character.&quot;

Garofalo signed on and persuaded Stiller to appear in the film. &quot;I met Kinka and he was nice and funny and the money was good, so I decided to do it,&quot; she said. &quot;I had to twist Ben&#x27;s arm because he&#x27;s always so busy.&quot;

Stiller was originally offered the Blue Raja role, but was not interested in playing what he called a &quot;nerdy guy&quot; again. &quot;The minute you start doing the same thing in comedy, people go, &#x27;Oh, I&#x27;ve seen that,&#x27;&quot; he said. He took the role of Mr. Furious but explained, &quot;In the original script, he was just angry all the time, but I thought that would be boring, so one of the changes I made is that he has the least power. Like if we&#x27;re a band, I&#x27;m the guy who started the band but who&#x27;s also the least talented.&quot;

Geoffrey Rush was cast in what was his first Hollywood film in July, followed by Azaria, Reubens, Forlani and Macy. Lena Olin was added in August; Greg Kinnear in October; and Eddie Izzard in November. Others in consideration for roles included Ving Rhames and Vince Vaughn.

===Writing===
Reubens said, &quot;I liked the idea. I hadn&#x27;t seen it before. I loved the cast that was assembled by the time I came into it, and I thought the script was fun, smart and goofy all at the same time.&quot; Regarding his character, he said, &quot;I felt I was playing the character as kind of slow, but when I saw the movie it didn&#x27;t seem like that at all. I don&#x27;t know what that says.&quot;

According to Stiller, the script was fluid. &quot;The script was being reworked all the time by... everybody! Because everybody kind of wanted to personalize their part, and try to make it as funny as possible. So yeah, that was welcome. That was the idea we had going in, to just have everybody kind of get together and try to make it as funny as we could. Especially in the context of a big action, special effects type movie. You know, a lot of the time what gets lost is the specific character stuff, and the small moments that really have to work for the whole thing to work. So that&#x27;s what we were concentrating on as much as possible. And it&#x27;s good if everybody&#x27;s on board with that, you know what I mean? And I think Hank, myself and Paul and Janeane were probably most involved in that process, for our characters. We&#x27;re used to working that way.&quot;

Usher said, &quot;We did a lot of unscripted stuff. I let Ben and Janeane go. They were totally free.&quot; Usher said he wanted &quot;the film to look flat, like a comic book. I tried to capture that alternate reality but keep the edgy humor.&quot;

===Filming===
Shooting began on October 21, 1998, in Los Angeles, and was completed the following April. &quot;I thought it would be quick, but it ended up being this six month shoot,&quot; Stiller recalled.

Bob Burden was on the set for some of the shoot, answering questions that came up about his creations. &quot;There were times when we were kind of stumped in a scene and we asked him what he thought,&quot; Levin said. &quot;The great thing about him is that 10 minutes later, we&#x27;d get 30 pages in the fax machine with probably 29 pages filled with the lousiest ideas that you&#x27;ve ever read but that one page of pure genius.&quot;

The original ending was unpopular with test audiences, so Usher shot a new one with what he called &quot;a big-cheer finish.&quot;

==Music==
The musical score for &quot;Mystery Men&quot; was composed by Stephen Warbeck. Written within a 28-day time span, the score was recorded on the Sony Scoring Stage. &quot;I was quite liberal in the choice of instruments, because I&#x27;ve chosen a couple of Hungarian instruments, the tárogató and the cimbalom, and also a Greek instrument, the bouzouki,&quot; said Warbeck on the film&#x27;s range of sounds. &quot;And then Mike Fisher and the other percussionists have brought along an exciting range of stuff which are so interesting and varied that we keep picking bits of those and adding them in.&quot; After Warbeck&#x27;s contributions were completed, the film&#x27;s producers decided to alter various scenes. Because of this, composer Shirley Walker was brought in to create additional music and rearrange Warbeck&#x27;s score to fit the new running time.

A soundtrack album was released on July 6, 1999, by Interscope Records. the album spawned two singles, &quot;All Star&quot;, and &quot;Who Are Those Mystery Men&quot;.

The soundtrack album’s first single, the recently recorded &quot;All Star&quot; by the California rock band Smash Mouth (which was heard during the end credits of the movie) became a critically and massively successful international hit after their manager Robert Hayes licensed it for the film’s official soundtrack. And to promote it, a music video directed by McG was made featuring footage from the film. It became their signature song, peaking at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, nominated for the Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, and it was later licensed to be used in many films, TV shows, commercials and more.

Additional songs featured in the film include:
* &quot;Planet Claire&quot; – The B-52s
* &quot;O Mio Babbino Caro&quot; (Composed by Giacomo Puccini) – Miriam Gauci
* &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot; – Wild Cherry
* &quot;A Fifth of Beethoven&quot; - Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band

==Release==

===Box office===

Universal delayed the film&#x27;s release one week to avoid competing with the opening of &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. In its opening weekend, &quot;Mystery Men&quot; grossed $10,017,865, ranking number six at the domestic box office. By the end of its run, on October 14, the film had grossed $29,762,011 domestically and $3,699,000 internationally, for a worldwide total of $33,461,011. Given its $68 million budget, the film is a box office bomb.

===Critical response===

Review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 60% based on 105 reviews, with an average rating of 5.80/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Absurd characters and quirky gags are brought to life by a talented cast, providing this superhero spoof with lots of laughs.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a 65 out of 100 rating based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Godfrey Cheshire for &quot;Variety&quot; thought the film &quot;may contain more yuks than the summer&#x27;s other big pop sendup, the second &#x27;Austin Powers,&#x27; but it also spreads them over an ultimately tiresome two hours...Though pic boasts several action sequences that are expertly handled and laden with dazzling effects, its most engaging passages by far are the ones focusing on the central sextets&#x27; banter and interaction.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Watching &#x27;Mystery Men&#x27; is a bit like sitting next to a brilliant person at a dinner party who just won&#x27;t shut up. Because this film is so self-conscious and, like Mr. Furious and friends, has a tendency to try too hard, it&#x27;s an effort you end up admiring more than completely loving. Influenced by its betters, films such as &quot;Brazil&quot;, &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; and even &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, it&#x27;s destined to join them all in cult film heaven.&quot;

Jonathan Romney for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; said that it was &quot;a desperately hit-and-miss affair&quot;. Michael Dequina of &quot;The Movie Report&quot; said that it &quot;fails to come up with worthy gags and one-liners for the able cast.&quot; Steve Murray of &quot;Cox News Service&quot; gave it a negative review, saying &quot;&quot;Mystery Men&quot; is like its hapless heroes. It&#x27;s a wannabe that has the best intentions – including a pronounced anti-gun stance – but none of the knack it takes to save the day, or itself.&quot;

&quot;Newsday&quot; wrote, &quot;&#x27;Mystery Men&#x27; manages to exalt both the terminally weird and the frighteningly mundane with such flamboyant good spirits that you overlook its occasional dead zones and dull patches. Try as it might to prop up its static plot, the movie is more comic revue than action comedy. Viewed within these parameters, &#x27;Mystery Men&#x27; is as satisfying as a heaping helping of Abbott-and-Costello shorts. And much smarter than the average doofus blockbuster.&quot; British television channel Film4 gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying it was &quot;Hugely entertaining – especially for those with a thing for superheroes.&quot;

==Legacy==
While &quot;Mystery Men&quot; was not a hit during release, it has been acknowledged as a cult film. Cast members have generally expressed interest in returning to their roles for a sequel, while acknowledging the unlikelihood of such a sequel happening.

Janeane Garofalo kept her character&#x27;s skull bowling ball after filming, and enjoys using it as a Halloween decoration.

<text>Newsnight is the BBC&#x27;s news and current affairs programme, providing in-depth investigation and analysis of the stories behind the day&#x27;s headlines. It is broadcast weeknights at 22:30 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel; it is also available on BBC iPlayer.

==History==

&quot;Newsnight&quot; began on 28 January 1980 at 22:45, although a 15-minute news bulletin using the same title had run on BBC2 for a 13-month period from 1975 to 1976. Its planned September 1979 launch date was delayed by four months by the Association of Broadcasting Staff, at the time the main BBC trade union. &quot;Newsnight&quot; was the first programme to be made by means of a direct collaboration between BBC News, then at Television Centre, and the current affairs department, based a short distance away at the now defunct Lime Grove Studios. Staff feared job cuts. The newscast also served as a replacement for the current affairs programme &quot;Tonight&quot;.

Former presenters include Peter Snow, a regular for seventeen years, Donald MacCormick, Charles Wheeler, Adam Raphael and John Tusa, later boss of the BBC World Service. In the early days each edition had an &quot;auxiliary presenter&quot;, a phenomenon pejoratively known at the time as the &quot;Newsnight&#x27;s wife syndrome&quot;. Usually a woman, it was her job to read the news headlines and to introduce minor items. Olivia O&#x27;Leary in 1985 became the first principal female presenter; the programme has had a single presenter since 1987. &quot; &quot;The program is now wholly managed by BBC News.

Until 1988 the start time of &quot;Newsnight&quot; was flexible, enabling BBC2 to screen a full-length movie at 21:30 to dovetail with the end of the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on BBC1. However, BBC News and Current Affairs, then controlled by John Birt, wanted a fixed start time for &quot;Newsnight&quot; at 22:30 so that viewers would always know when it was on.The managing director of BBC Television, Bill Cotton, who was responsible for all TV scheduling, strongly opposed Birt&#x27;s campaign, fearing it would severely restrict his scheduling freedom. But Birt persuaded the BBC director general, Michael Checkland, to back the change - which Checkland then announced at a press conference without warning Cotton, who was in the audience. Cotton fought a fierce campaign inside and outside the BBC to reverse the decision - so fierce that one protagonist said it would &quot;destroy the BBC&quot;. But the move to a fixed start time took place on 31 October 1988 and is still in place.

Between 1999 and 2014 on BBC Two Scotland the offshoot, &quot;Newsnight Scotland&quot;, presented by Gordon Brewer, replaced the final twenty minutes of the UK programme from Monday to Friday. From May 2014, &quot;Newsnight&quot; has again been shown in full in Scotland, although delayed by half an hour to accommodate &quot;Newsnight Scotland&quot;&#x27;s replacement, &quot;Scotland 2014&quot;. In more recent years, Scottish viewers have seen the full edition of the show without a separate programme. The flagship news programmes for BBC Scotland are now shown on their separate channel.

&quot;Newsnight&quot; moved to new facilities at Broadcasting House on 15 October 2012.

In 2020, &quot;Newsnight&quot; won the Royal Television Society&#x27;s &quot;Daily News Programme of the Year&quot; award. It was succeeded in 2021 by the &quot;ITV News at Ten&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Newsnight&quot; reverted to a 22:45 start time from 30 March 2020. This was due to &quot;Newsnight&quot; temporarily sharing a studio with the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot; during the pandemic, to cut footfall in Broadcasting House and allow turnover in the studio, with the &quot;News at Ten&quot; not finishing until 22:35. Further, during the pandemic, some editions presented by Kirsty Wark were presented from BBC Scotland&#x27;s Pacific Quay headquarters in Glasgow. However, Wark still travelled to London during weeks she presented more episodes of the show (for example when main presenter Emily Maitlis was on holiday).

In October 2020 the show moved to a new studio, but continued to broadcast from 22:45. It returned to the 22:30 slot in May 2021.

&quot;Newsnight&quot;&#x27;s signature tune was composed by George Fenton. Various arrangements have been used over the years.

There has been much debate over the role and format of Newsnight. In 2018 a former Newsnight editor John Morrison, wrote in &quot;Radio Times&quot; that the gap Newsnight once filled (&quot;covering serious news including the arts and sciences in depth, and with probing interviews&quot;) had now largely been filled by other programmes earlier in the day. The BBC, he said, had failed to come up with a replacement. The Corporation&#x27;s plan now, he suggested, was simply to &quot;starve Newsnight of resources and eventually it will just fade away.&quot; To ensure its survival, he suggested, among other changes, cutting the programme length from 45 to 30 minutes and &quot;beefing up the interview booking desk.&quot; On 29 November 2023, it was announced that &quot;Newsnight&quot; would be revamped as a 30-minute &quot;interview, debate and discussion&quot; programme, ditching its special reporting team. Jobs within the programme were to be slashed by more than half, from 57 to 23. The new format was launched on 28 May 2024.

=== Viewing figures ===
The programme&#x27;s average audience in 2015 was 579,000, compared to 867,000 in 2008.

The average audience was 344,000 in September 2018 and by August 2020 around 300,000.

In January 2020 Victoria Derbyshire said &quot;Newsnight&quot;&#x27;s audience figures were 297,000.

==Notable interviews==
===Jeremy Paxman interviews Michael Howard===

In May 1997, Jeremy Paxman pressed former Home Secretary Michael Howard about a meeting with head of the Prison Service Derek Lewis about the possible dismissal of the governor of Parkhurst Prison. Faced with what he considered evasive answers, Paxman put the same question – &quot;Did you threaten to overrule him?&quot; (i.e. Lewis) – to Howard twelve times in succession.

This has become one of the programme&#x27;s best known interviews. Later, during the twentieth anniversary edition of &quot;Newsnight&quot;, Paxman told Howard that he had simply been trying to prolong the interview because the next item in the running order was not ready. In 2004, Paxman raised the subject again with Howard, by then leader of the Conservative Party to get a final answer. This time, Howard laughed it off, saying that he had not threatened to overrule the head of the Prison Service. During Paxman&#x27;s final show in June 2014, Howard briefly appeared in the studio once more, with Paxman simply asking &quot;Did you?&quot;, to which Howard replied &quot;No, Jeremy, I didn&#x27;t, but feel free to ask another 11 times.&quot;

===Emily Maitlis interviews Prince Andrew, Duke of York===

In November 2019, Emily Maitlis interviewed Prince Andrew, Duke of York about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in August 2019 whilst awaiting trial. The interview had taken months to prepare and Maitlis received approval only 48 hours before the scheduled airdate.

In the interview, the Duke of York denied having sex with Virginia Giuffre (then known by her maiden name Virginia Roberts) in March 2001, as she had accused, because he had been at home with his daughters, having taken his elder daughter, Beatrice, to a party at PizzaExpress in Woking. The Duke said that he had &quot;no recollection of ever meeting&quot; Giuffre and that he had &quot;absolutely no memory&quot; of a photograph taken of him with Giuffre at Ghislaine Maxwell&#x27;s house. He said he had investigations carried out to establish whether the photograph was faked, but they had been &quot;inconclusive&quot;.

Andrew&#x27;s responses in the interview received negative reactions from both the media and the public. Maitlis won the Network Presenter of the Year award at the RTS Television Journalism Awards in 2020, and the interview was given awards for Interview of the Year and Scoop of the Year.

The interview and events surrounding it have twice been dramatised. In 2024 Netflix released Scoop, and in the same year Prime Video released a three-part mini-series A Very Royal Scandal.

==Accusations of bias==
In April 2001, the BBC&#x27;s Board of Governors ruled that &quot;Newsnight&quot;&#x27;s coverage of Peter Mandelson&#x27;s resignation over the Hinduja affair had been politically biased. The governors criticised the programme for featuring only Labour Party supporters on the panel discussing the issue, and for not including opposition politicians in the coverage. The broadcast caused an outcry in the media. One critic described it as a &quot;whitewash worthy of a one-party state&quot;.

The BBC judged Emily Maitlis to have broken BBC rules on impartiality in the introduction to the 26 May 2020 edition, when she said &quot;the country can see&quot; that Dominic Cummings had &quot;broken the [COVID-19 lockdown] rules.&quot; As a result, she said, the public mood was &quot;one of fury, contempt and anguish.&quot; The BBC said that while the programme contained &quot;fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism&quot;, it was &quot;not made clear&quot; that the remarks referred to questions to be examined in the rest of the programme.

When Boris Johnson became prime minister in July 2019 his ministers generally refused invitations to appear on the programme. This resulted in &quot;Newsnight&quot; presenters stating on an almost nightly basis that the government had been asked to appear but that &quot;no one was available&quot; or that they had declined outright. On 12 January 2022, Jacob Rees-Mogg made a rare government appearance on the programme to defend the government&#x27;s position on &quot;lockdown parties&quot; at 10 Downing Street which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mogg referred to Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross as &quot;quite a lightweight figure&quot;.

==Coverage of sexual abuse scandals==

In the weeks after the ITV documentary &quot;Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile&quot; was broadcast on 3 October 2012, allegations were made that a &quot;Newsnight&quot; investigation into Savile by reporter Liz MacKean and producer Meirion Jones in December 2011 had been dropped shortly before transmission because it conflicted with tribute programmes prepared after Savile&#x27;s death. The BBC appointed Nick Pollard, a former Sky News executive, to examine why the investigation was dropped. On 23 October, the Director-General of the BBC, George Entwistle, appeared before the Parliamentary Culture, Media and Sport Committee, and stated that it had been a &quot;catastrophic mistake&quot; to cancel the &quot;Newsnight&quot; broadcast.

On 2 November 2012, &quot;Newsnight&quot; broadcast a report falsely accusing, but not naming, a prominent Conservative, Lord McAlpine of child abuse. The veracity of this story collapsed after &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported a case of mistaken identity on 8 November and the victim retracted the allegation after belatedly being shown a photograph of McAlpine in an item broadcast on the following day. The production team had not contacted McAlpine about the allegations. An apology about the story was made on 9 November during that evening&#x27;s broadcast of the programme. In an official statement, the BBC announced all ongoing &quot;Newsnight&quot; investigations were being suspended. The Director of BBC Scotland, Ken MacQuarrie, investigated the circumstances around the programme. His findings were published on 12 November and stated that: The BBC announced that Karen O&#x27;Connor would take on the role of Acting Editor of &quot;Newsnight&quot;.

The Pollard report was published on 19 December 2012. It concluded that the decision to drop the original &quot;Newsnight&quot; report on the allegations against Savile in December 2011 was &quot;flawed&quot;, but that it had not been done to protect the Savile tribute programmes. However, it criticised George Entwistle for apparently failing to read emails warning him of Savile&#x27;s &quot;dark side&quot;, and that, after the allegations against Savile eventually became public, the BBC fell into a &quot;level of chaos and confusion [that] was even greater than was apparent at the time&quot;. The BBC announced that &quot;Newsnight&quot; editor Peter Rippon and deputy editor Liz Gibbons would be replaced.

==Past elements==
===&quot;Newsnight Review&quot;===
From 2000 until December 2009, on Friday evenings &quot;Newsnight&quot; was followed at 23:00 by &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;, a 35-minute consumer survey of the week&#x27;s artistic and cultural highlights. Mark Lawson was the programme&#x27;s main presenter in its &quot;Late Review&quot; incarnation, which began life as a strand of &quot;The Late Show&quot;. He continued to chair the panel of guest reviewers when it was relaunched as &quot;Newsnight Review&quot; in 2000, up until December 2005. The programme was presented by Kirsty Wark, Martha Kearney, John Wilson, Tim Marlow, Kwame Kwei-Armah and Hardeep Singh Kohli. Regular reviewers included Mark Kermode, Tom Paulin, Ekow Eshun and Germaine Greer.

As part of the BBC&#x27;s commitment to moving programmes out of London, &quot;Newsnight Review&quot; finished on 18 December 2009 with a special hour-long edition. The programme was replaced by &quot;The Review Show&quot;, produced from Glasgow, which started on 22 January 2010. It had the same producer as &quot;Newsnight Review&quot; and was still presented by Kirsty Wark and Martha Kearney.

===Closing segments and frivolity===
Traditionally, there was a short stock market update at the end of each edition. In 2005, &quot;Newsnight&#x27;s&quot; then editor, Peter Barron, replaced it with a 30-second weather forecast, arguing that the market data was available on the internet and that a weather forecast would be &quot;more useful&quot;. The change provoked a flurry of complaints.

Paxman on one occasion adopted a sarcastic tone and announced: &quot;So finally and controversially, tomorrow&#x27;s weather forecast. It&#x27;s a veritable smorgasbord. Sun, rain, thunder, hail, snow, cold, wind. Almost worth going to work.&quot; On other occasions: &quot;It&#x27;s April, what do you expect?&quot; and &quot;Take an umbrella with you tomorrow.&quot; He claimed, nonetheless, that he was happy presenting the weather. Gavin Esler also joined in, announcing: &quot;As for the spring, you can forget about that until further notice.&quot; The programme conducted a telephone poll. Michael Fish, a former weather forecaster, was seen arguing in favour of the weather forecast, while Norman Lamont, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, argued for the market update. 62% of viewers voted in favour of the markets, and the update duly returned on Monday 18 April 2005.

Other stunts included, for a week at the end of January 2006, &quot;Newsnight&quot; playing the Radio 4 UK Theme, which was facing the axe, over its closing credits, while the edition of 24 April 2006 played out to the signature tune of the soon-to-be-axed BBC sports programme, &quot;Grandstand&quot;. In 2005, following a discussion about the return of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to television after a nine-year absence, the programme ended with the TARDIS dematerialisation sound, while presenter Jeremy Paxton faded from view as if dematerialising like the fictional ship.

Between January and June 2006 the programme included &quot;Gordaq&quot;, a spoof stock market index measuring the political performance of Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. The index started at 100 and moved up or down depending on Brown&#x27;s political situation, finishing at 101 on 30 June 2006.

In an early day motion of 3 November 2016, as a celebration of the &quot;Brexit&quot; vote for UK withdrawal from the European Union, Conservative Party MP Andrew Rosindell argued for a return to the broadcasting of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; at the end of BBC One transmissions each day. The practice was dropped in 1997 ostensibly due to BBC One adopting 24-hour broadcasting by simulcasting BBC News 24 overnight, rendering closedown obsolete. That evening, &quot;Newsnight&quot; ended its broadcast with host of that night Kirsty Wark saying that they were &quot;incredibly happy to oblige&quot; Rosindell&#x27;s request, before playing out to the video of the Sex Pistols&#x27; punk song of the same name, much to Rosindell&#x27;s discontent.

==Other media==
&quot;Newsnight&quot; is available in the UK on BBC iPlayer for up to thirty days after broadcast. A weekly digest version of &quot;Newsnight&quot; used to be screened on both the UK and international feeds BBC News, focusing on &quot;the best of the week&#x27;s films and discussions.&quot;

From August 2013, &quot;Newsnight&quot; had a dedicated YouTube channel on which excerpts of programmes could be found. However, the channel was updated for the final time in September 2020 and replaced with sections of the episodes being released on BBC News&#x27; main YouTube channel. KCET, an independent public television station in Los Angeles, broadcasts the weekly digest version.

Segments of &quot;Newsnight&quot; are also distributed via the independent YouTube channels of the programme&#x27;s guests. This includes a segment featuring Ash Sarkar in May 2023 which was reposted on the Novara Media channel as the video &quot;Ash Sarkar Bodies The Royals on BBC Newsnight,&quot; generating 122,463 views.

<doc id="295764" wikidata="Q582948" url="?curid=295764" title="Norse colonization of North America">
<text>The exploration of North America by Norsemen began in the late 10th century when they explored areas of the North Atlantic, colonized Greenland, and created a short-term settlement near the northern tip of Newfoundland. The remains of buildings were found at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in 1960 dating to approximately 1,000 years ago. This discovery helped reignite archaeological exploration for the Norse in the North Atlantic. This single settlement, located on the island of Newfoundland and not on the North American mainland, was abruptly abandoned.

The Norse settlements on Greenland lasted for almost 500 years. L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, the only confirmed Norse site in present-day Canada, was small and did not last as long. Other such Norse voyages are likely to have occurred for some time, but there is no evidence of any other Norse settlements in North America.

The Norse exploration has been subject to numerous controversies concerning the European exploration and settlement of North America. Pseudoscientific and pseudohistorical theories have emerged since the public acknowledgment of these Norse expeditions and settlements.

==Norse Greenland==

===Icelandic sagas===
The two Vinland sagas, the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot; and the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;, cover Norse explorations into the Western Atlantic within the genre of Icelandic sagas. They are heroic narratives originally shared orally and written down centuries later in Iceland during the 13th and 14th centuries. Written within the literary tradition of and according to the literary expectations for Icelandic sagas, they portray Greenland as a place at the edge of the world where people were exiled and tested. This limits their reliability as a historical record.

The earliest mention of Greenland in the sagas refers to a group of rocky islands in the Atlantic reported by Gunnbjörn Ulfsson when his ship was blown off course from Iceland in the early 900s. Named after him, &quot;Gunnbjarnarsker&quot; or &quot;Gunnbjörn&#x27;s skerries&quot;, were likely near modern-day Kulusuk just off the eastern coast of Greenland, but their exact location is unknown. According to the &quot;Landnámabók&quot;, Snæbjörn Galti led the earliest recorded intentional Norse voyage to Greenland and started a failed settlement on the eastern coast of Greenland. The colony struggled, Snæbjörn Galti was murdered, the settlement was abandoned, and only two colonists survived the return to Iceland. Ívar Bárðarson, a Catholic priest sent to Greenland in 1341, wrote that the skerries were about &quot;two days and two nights sailing due West&quot; from Iceland and the halfway point on trips to the later more successful colonies on the western coast. After the end of the Medieval Warm Period, the area began to freeze over and became hazardous to ships.

According to the sagas, Erik the Red (Old Norse: Eiríkr rauði) was banished from Iceland for manslaughter, and sailed westward to the lands reported by Gunnbjorn. His crew continued past the skerries, down the coast of Greenland, and settled on an island near Tunulliarfik Fjord; he named the fjord &quot;Eiriksfjord&quot; after himself. He remained for three years, explored the area, and decided to found a settlement. He named the area Greenland, and returned to Iceland to recruit settlers, promising tracts of land to his followers. Erik established his estate &quot;Brattahlíð&quot; along the inner reaches of &quot;Eiriksfjord&quot;.

===Life===
Norse Greenland consisted of two main settlements. The Eastern Settlement was at the southwestern tip of Greenland, while the Western Settlement was about 500 km up the west coast, near present-day Nuuk. A smaller settlement later founded near the Eastern Settlement is sometimes considered the Middle Settlement. The combined population peaked around 2,000–3,000. At least 400 farms have been identified by archaeologists.

Norse Greenlanders were limited to living along scattered fjords on the island that provided habitable land for their animals (such as cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, and cats) to be kept and farms to be established. In these fjords, the farms depended upon stables (&quot;byres&quot;) to host their livestock in the winter, and routinely culled their herds so that they could survive the season. With the coming of the warmer season livestock were taken from their byres to pastures, the most fertile being controlled by the most powerful farms and the church. What was produced by livestock and farming was supplemented with subsistence hunting of mainly seal and caribou as well as walrus for trade. The Norse mainly relied on the &quot;Nordrsetur&quot; hunt, a communal hunt of migratory harp seals in the spring.

There is evidence of Norse trade with the Thule, the ancestors of the Inuit, and the Beothuk, related to the Algonquin. The peoples were called the by the Norse. The Dorset people had withdrawn from Greenland before the Norse settlement of the island. Items such as comb fragments, pieces of iron cooking utensils and chisels, chess pieces, ship rivets, carpenter&#x27;s planes, and oaken ship fragments used in Inuit boats have been found far beyond the traditional range of Norse colonization. A small ivory figurine that appears to represent a Norseman has also been found among the ruins of an Inuit community house.

Trade was highly important to the Greenland Norse, who relied on imports of lumber due to the barrenness of the land. In turn they exported goods such as walrus ivory and hide, polar bear skins, and narwhal tusks. Ultimately these exchanges were vulnerable as they relied on migratory patterns affected by climate changes as well as on the viability of the few fjords on the island. A portion of the time the Greenland settlements existed was during the Little Ice Age and the climate was, overall, becoming cooler and more humid. A cooling climate and increasing humidity brought more storms, longer winters and shorter springs, and affected the migratory patterns of the harp seal. Pasture space began to dwindle and fodder yields for the winter became much smaller. This combined with regular herd culling made it hard to maintain livestock, especially for the poorest of the Greenland Norse. Closer to the Eastern Settlement, temperatures remained stable but a prolonged drought reduced fodder production. In spring, the voyages to where migratory harp seals could be found became more dangerous due to more frequent storms, and the lower population of harp seals meant that &quot;Nordrsetur&quot; hunts became less successful, making subsistence hunting extremely difficult. The strain on resources made trade difficult, and as time went on, Greenland exports lost value in the European market due to competing countries and the lack of interest in what was being traded. Trade in elephant ivory began competing with the trade in walrus tusks that provided income to Greenland, and there is evidence that walrus over-hunting, particularly of the males with larger tusks, led to walrus population declines.

In 1126, the population requested a bishop (headquartered at a bishopric established in Garðar), and in 1261, they accepted the overlordship of the Norwegian king. They continued to have their own law and became almost completely politically independent after 1349, the time of the Black Death. In 1380, the Kingdom of Norway entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark.

The settlements began to decline in the 14th century. The Western Settlement was abandoned around 1350, and the last bishop at Garðar died in 1377. After a marriage was recorded in 1408, no written records mention the settlers. It is probable that the Eastern Settlement was defunct by the late 15th century. The most recent radiocarbon date found in Norse settlements as of 2002 was 1430 (±15 years). Several theories have been advanced to explain the decline.

=== Climate and decline ===
The Little Ice Age of this period would have made travel between Greenland and Europe, as well as farming, more difficult. Although the hunting of seal and other animals provided a healthy diet, there was more prestige in cattle farming, and there was increased availability of farms in Scandinavian countries depopulated by famine and plague epidemics. In addition, Greenlandic ivory may have been supplanted in European markets by cheaper ivory from Africa. Despite the loss of contact with the Greenlanders, the Norwegian-Danish crown continued to consider Greenland a dependency.

Not knowing whether the old Norse civilization remained in Greenland or not—and worried that if it did, it would still be Catholic 200 years after the Scandinavian homelands had undergone the Reformation—a joint merchant-clerical expedition led by the Norwegian missionary Hans Egede was sent to Greenland in 1721. Though this expedition found no surviving Europeans, it marked the beginning of Denmark&#x27;s re-assertion of sovereignty over the island.

To some extent, it seemed that the Norse were unwilling to integrate with the Thule people of Greenland, through either marriage or culture. There is evidence of contact as seen through the Thule archaeological record, including ivory depictions of the Norse as well as bronze and steel artifacts. In the 20th century, there was little evidence for Thule artifacts among Norse habitations, however it is now known that Thule artifacts are found among Norse habitations, indicating that both groups acquired material goods from each other. The older research posited that it was not climate change alone that led to Norse decline, but also their unwillingness to adapt. For example, if the Norse had decided to focus their subsistence hunting on the ringed seal (which could be hunted year round, though individually), and decided to reduce or do away with their communal hunts, food would have been much less scarce during the winter season. Also, had Norse individuals used skins instead of wool for their clothing, they would have fared better nearer to the coast, and would not have been as confined to the fjords.

However, more recent research has shown that the Norse did try to adapt in their own ways. This included increased subsistence hunting. A significant number of bones of marine animals can be found at the settlements, suggesting increased hunting with the absence of farmed food. In addition, pollen records show that the Norse did not always devastate the small forests and foliage, as previously thought. Instead they ensured that overgrazed or overused sections were given time to regrow and moved to other areas. Norse farmers also attempted to adapt; with the increased need for winter fodder and smaller pastures, they would self-fertilize their lands to try to keep up with the new demands caused by the changing climate. However, even with these attempts, climate change was not the only thing putting pressure on the Greenland Norse. The economy was changing, and the exports they relied on were losing value. Current research suggests that the Norse were unable to maintain their settlements because of economic and climatic change happening at the same time.

A 2022 study indicates that gravitational effects from a readvance of the Southern Greenland Ice Sheet caused a relative sea level rise of &quot;up to ~3.3 m outside the glaciation zone during Viking settlement, producing shoreline retreat of hundreds of meters. Sea-level rise was progressive and encompassed the entire Eastern Settlement. Moreover, pervasive flooding would have forced abandonment of many coastal sites. These processes likely contributed to the suite of vulnerabilities that led to Viking abandonment of Greenland. Sea-level change thus represents an integral, missing element of the Viking story.&quot;

==Norse settlements in Canada==
Greenland lacked natural resources like forests and iron ore. The Greenlanders&#x27; oral history, recorded in the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot; and &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;, mentions several places to the south or west that could supplement what was available on Greenland, notably Markland, Helluland, and Vinland. There is generally believed to be a historical basis for Norse voyages to these places, despite some fantastical elements in the sagas such as Great Ireland and the uniped who kills Thorvald Asvaldsson in Vinland. In Adam of Bremen&#x27;s 11th-century chronicle &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot;, he briefly mentions Greenland and islands beyond Norway including one &quot;called Vinland&quot;.
 Icelandic annals record that, in 1347, a ship arrived from Greenland that had drifted off course while sailing to Markland for wood. A 13th-century Icelandic description of the world gives the rough order of the lands described in the sagas as Greenland, Helluland, Markland, and Vinland, which the author suspected was part of Africa. In Europe, several medieval works reproduced this general description in cities as far away as Milan, where Dominican chronicler Galvano Fiamma mentioned &quot;terra que dicitur Marckalada&quot; &#x27;the land called Markland&#x27; west of Greenland circa 1345. Where these places would correspond to in modern-day Canada is still debated. Greenland colonists used timber for their boats and homes, so they likely made many unrecorded trips south for wood. Microscopic analysis of the materials used at 5 Norse sites on Greenland, shows that many families relied on driftwood and the sparse local trees, while the larger farms sourced lumber from Europe and North America.

Bog iron was widely used and smelted in forges on Greenland, but because no ores were present near the Eastern or Western Settlements, the iron had to be shipped from Labrador, Newfoundland, Iceland, or Europe. One indicator that iron was being extracted from North America rather than imported from the east was the usage of porous iron and slag blooms. Iron shipped from the east would have likely been products (tools, nails, axes) or iron bars.

There is one confirmed Norse settlement in modern-day Canada, L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland. A ruined stone and sod building at Tanfield Valley on Baffin Island may have been a medieval Norse home. It contained whet stones that had been used to sharpen copper-alloy blades. The indigenous Dorset cold-hammered copper as well as meteoric iron, but did not smelt metals. Dating the Tanfield Valley site is complicated by it having been inhabited and abandoned multiple times. No settlements have been found in mainland Canada. No Norse materials have been recovered from excavations in mainland Labrador, which implies a lack of trading and a low likelihood for larger Norse sites south of Newfoundland. Surveys in the 1970s and 1980s could find no evidence of Norse settlements on the coasts of modern-day Quebec.

Historians have found that the Greenlanders had limited incentives and capabilities to expand south into a long-term colony in Canada. Population pressure was one of the factors that affected migrations out of Scandinavia and medieval Iceland, where as many as 70,000 Icelanders competed for limited resources. The same pressure never manifested in Greenland. The population gradually rose from a few hundred to a few thousand before populations declined across the North Atlantic due to climate change and plague.

===Newfoundland===
Evidence of the Norse west of Greenland came in the 1960s when archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad and author Helge Ingstad excavated a Norse site at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland. They found a bronze, ring-headed pin like those the Norse used to fasten their cloaks inside the cooking pit of one of the larger dwellings. A stone oil lamp and a small spindle whorl, used as the flywheel of a handheld spindle, were found inside another building. A fragment of a bone needle believed to have been used for knitting was discovered in the firepit of a third dwelling. A small, decorated brass fragment, once gilded, was also discovered. Much slag formed as a by-product from the smelting and working of iron was found on the site along with many iron boat nails or rivets.

The site is different from the colonies in Greenland; it was not a permanent continuous settlement. Archaeologists have found no burials, no farmland, no stables for livestock, and a near absence of soapstone, which was widely used by the Greenlanders for household tools.

Birgitta Wallace has said that location of the site and the type of buildings present &quot;suggests that seafaring was the most important function of the settlement.&quot; The buildings include several large living halls and specialized workshops including one for boat repair and construction. According to historian Eleanor Barraclough, one major purpose of the site was boat repair. The land is bare and open now, but it was forested during the time the Norse were active. The presence of wood and nuts from the &quot;Juglans cinerea&quot; walnut tree, which grows wild on the continental mainland but not Newfoundland itself, indicates that the site was used as a staging area for further voyages.

It&#x27;s unlikely that there were any permanent settlements on the scale of L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows on Newfoundland or in nearby areas of Canada. The sailing season from Greenland was short, the voyage was long, and Greenland had a limited population for further colonies. L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows itself may have drawn 10 to 20 percent of the total Greenland colonists; the communal living halls could hold from 30 to 160 people. Point Rosee was identified by archaeologist Sarah Parcak as a possible Norse settlement based on near-infrared satellite images and high-resolution aerial photographs, but archaeological excavations in 2015 and 2016 showed no signs of Norse occupation.

Trees at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows were felled by the Norse in 1021. Chunks of wood from the site were dated in 2021 using the 993–994 carbon-14 spike and tree rings. This provided the first certain date for the Norse presence at the site. Although not inhabited for long stretches of time, the site may have been used as late as 1145 AD. When they left, the Norse intentionally and deliberately abandoned the site, leaving behind no tools and mostly waste.

===Baffin Island===
By 2012, Canadian researchers identified possible signs of Norse outposts from several areas on and around Baffin Island, notably possible Norse artifacts at the Nanook site in Tanfield Valley. They also suspected yarn from Willows Island and Nunguvik (near Pond Inlet) to be Norse, but these were not corroborated by later dating methods. Despite early theories that the Norse introduced the practice of spinning thread to the native peoples, a 2018 study demonstrated an indigenous spinning tradition. The study employed a new dating technique to separate oils that could potentially contaminate the spun fibers and corrupt the results. On Willows Island, archaeological sites contained strands of Dorset yarn spun between 15 BC and 725 AD possibly from Arctic hare or muskox. This predates all known European arrivals. Unlike European cordage, the Dorset yarn was spun at a consistent diameter and was never woven into fabric.

A team led by archaeologist Patricia Sutherland excavated a ruined stone and sod building in Tanfield Valley and found a range of artifacts that indicate a possible Viking presence on the island. Moreau Maxwell had begun a dig in the 1960s and described the structure as &quot;very difficult to interpret&quot;. Due to the presence of artifacts on the island that have a possible Norse origin, Sutherland suspected the building itself was Norse. Spun cordage found on Baffin Island in the 1980s and stored at the Canadian Museum of Civilization led to a more comprehensive exploration of the Tanfield Valley archaeological site for points of contact between Norse Greenlanders and the indigenous Dorset people. At the site, Sutherland&#x27;s team found whet-stones used to sharpen blades. They analyzed the metal fragments still in the whet-stone and found bronze, an alloy used by the Norse but unknown to the native peoples. They also found stones cut in a European fashion, Old World rat fur, and whalebone shovels similar to those used on Greenland. While there are indicators of an early Viking presence, radiocarbon dating could not conclusively identify the site as it had been occupied and abandoned several times, with the earliest material culture dating to before the arrival of the Vikings.

A stone crucible was found at the Nanook site in 2014. The crucible used very high heat to melt down metal alloys like bronze. Indigenous North Americans did not practice this type of metal-working, but the Norse regularly did. Radiocarbon dating placed it between 754 BC and 1367 AD. Sutherland said, &quot;It may be the earliest evidence of high-temperature nonferrous metalworking in North America to the north of what is now Mexico.&quot;

===Labrador===
When Martin Frobisher explored Labrador in the 1570s, the native peoples had an oral history of people they called &quot;kablunat&quot; (&#x27;white men&#x27;) whose behaviors and customs resembled those of the Norse. The colonists in Greenland regularly used timber for houses and boats, and the most viable logging sites from Greenland were the heavily forested coasts of northern Labrador. Labrador also contained bog iron ore and nearby timber to supply charcoal as fuel for its smelting.

The Dorset culture extended down to the northern edge of Labrador. The Native Americans who inhabited the southern portion were the ancestors of the Innu; they would have spoken one of the Algonquian languages and were possibly related to the indigenous Beothuk of Newfoundland. Archaeologists refer to them as the &quot;Point Revenge&quot; culture. At the Sandnæs farmstead in Greenland, arrowheads were found that resembled nothing in Norse culture but matched the arrows used by the Point Revenge peoples.

On the Avayalik Islands, off the very northern tip of Labrador, Patricia Sutherland found yarn being excavated that was distinct from the sinew-based cordage typically used by indigenous arctic hunters. Later dating showed that it predated the Norse arrival. Analysis of the yarn showed evidence for the Dorset spinning their own cordage and trading in a network that included the Norse, but not for a Norse settlement on the island. Norse materials have not been found in Native American archaeological sites in mainland Labrador, which indicates a lack of trading and a low possibility that Norse sites as large as L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows will be found south of Newfoundland. Patrick Plumet led many coastal surveys west of Labrador in the Ungava Bay during the 1970s and 1980s but found no evidence of Norse settlements.

===Vinland sagas===

According to the Icelandic sagas&quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;, plus chapters of the &quot;Hauksbók&quot; and the &quot;Flatey Book&quot;the Norse started to explore lands to the west of Greenland only a few years after the Greenland settlements were established. In 985, while sailing from Iceland to Greenland with a migration fleet consisting of 400–700 settlers and 25 other ships (14 of which completed the journey), a merchant named Bjarni Herjólfsson was blown off course, and after three days&#x27; sailing he sighted land west of the fleet. Bjarni was interested only in finding his father&#x27;s farm, but he described his findings to Leif Erikson who explored the area in more detail and planted a small settlement fifteen years later.

The sagas describe three areas beyond Greenland: Helluland, &quot;land of the flat stones&quot;; Markland, &quot;the land of forests&quot;; and Vinland, either &quot;the land of wine&quot; or &quot;the land of meadows&quot;. Helluland is generally thought to correspond to Baffin Island but may include northern areas of Labrador. Markland is generally thought to be an area in Labrador. Vinland likely includes Newfoundland and possibly other areas around the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. There has long been debate about identifying any of the three &quot;lands&quot; to actual, known locations in North America. Vinland in particular has been the topic of widely divergent claims and theories.

In 2019 archaeologist Birgitta Wallace wrote:
==Historiography==

For centuries, it remained unclear whether the Icelandic stories represented real voyages by the Norse to North America. Although the idea of Norse voyages to, and a colony in, North America was discussed by Swiss scholar Paul Henri Mallet in his book &quot;Northern Antiquities&quot; (English translation 1770), the sagas first gained widespread attention in 1837 when the Danish antiquarian Carl Christian Rafn revived the idea of a Viking presence in North America. North America, by the name Winland, first appeared in written sources in a work by Adam of Bremen from approximately 1075. The most important works about North America and the early Norse activities there, namely the Sagas of Icelanders, were recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries. In 1420, some Inuit captives and their kayaks were taken to Scandinavia. The Norse sites were depicted in the Skálholt Map, made by an Icelandic teacher in 1570 and depicting part of northeastern North America and mentioning Helluland, Markland and Vinland.

==Pseudohistory==
Purported runestones have been found in North America, most famously the Kensington Runestone. These are generally considered forgeries or misinterpretations of Native American petroglyphs. There are many unsubstantiated claims of Norse colonization in New England.

Gordon Campbell&#x27;s book &quot;Norse America&quot;, published in 2021, develops his thesis that the &quot;fleeting and ill-documented&quot; idea that Vikings &quot;discovered America&quot; quickly seduced Americans of northern European Protestant descent, some of whom went on to deliberately manufacture evidence to support it. There is no physical evidence of a Norse presence in North America except for the far east of Canada. Other so-called discoveries, mostly in the United States, have been rejected by scholars. Supposed physical evidence has been found to be deliberately falsified or historically baseless, often to promote a political agenda. Literary critic Annette Kolodny criticized attempts to evoke what she termed &quot;plastic vikings&quot;. These were fictional characters treated as historical figures, but &quot;depicted variously as heroic warriors and empire builders, barbarous berserker invaders, fighters for freedom, courageous explorers, would-be colonists, seamen and merchants, poets and saga men, glorious ancestors, bloodthirsty pagan pirates, and civilized Christian converts&quot; depending on the speaker or author.

Monuments claimed to be Norse include:
* Stone Tower in Newport, Rhode Island
* Viking Altar Rock
* Spirit Pond runestones
* AVM Runestone
* Hammer of Thor (monument)
* Bourne stone
* Narragansett Runestone
* Maine penny
* Ulen sword
* Beardmore Relics
* Oklahoma runestones
* The petroglyphs on Dighton Rock, from the Taunton River in Massachusetts

=== Kensington Runestone ===
In late 1898, Swedish immigrant Olof Öhman stated that he found this runestone in Kensington, Minnesota, while clearing land he had recently acquired. He stated that the runestone was lying face down and tangled in various roots near the crest of a small knoll within an area of wetlands. After Olaus J. Breda (1853–1916), professor of Scandinavian Languages and Literature in the Scandinavian Department at the University of Minnesota analyzed the inscriptions, he declared the rune-stone to be a forgery and published a discrediting article in &quot;Symra&quot; in 1910. Breda also forwarded copies of the inscription to various contemporary Scandinavian linguists and historians, such as Oluf Rygh, Sophus Bugge, Gustav Storm, Magnus Olsen and Adolf Noreen. They &quot;unanimously pronounced the Kensington inscription a fraud and forgery of recent date&quot;.

===Horsford&#x27;s Norumbega===

The nineteenth-century Harvard chemist Eben Norton Horsford connected the Charles River Basin to places described in the Norse sagas and elsewhere, notably Norumbega. He published several books on the topic and had plaques, monuments, and statues erected in honor of the Norse. His work received little support from mainstream historians and archeologists at the time, and even less today.

Other nineteenth-century writers, such as Horsford&#x27;s friend Thomas Gold Appleton, in his &quot;A Sheaf of Papers&quot; (1875), and George Perkins Marsh, in his &quot;The Goths in New England&quot;, seized upon such false notions of Viking expansion history also to promote the superiority of white people (as well as to oppose the Catholic Church). Such misuse of Viking history and imagery reemerged in the twentieth century among some groups promoting white supremacy.

=== Vinland Map ===

During the mid-1960s, Yale University announced the acquisition of a map purportedly drawn around 1440 that showed Vinland and a legend concerning Norse voyages to the region. However certain experts doubted the authenticity of the map, based on linguistic and cartographic inconsistencies. Chemical analysis of the map&#x27;s ink later shed further doubts on its authenticity. Scientific debate continued until in 2021 the university finally acknowledged that the Vinland Map is a forgery.

=== Misattributed archeological findings ===
Archeological findings in 2015 at Point Rosee, on the southwest coast of Newfoundland, were originally thought to reveal evidence of a turf wall and the roasting of bog iron ore, and therefore a possible 10th century Norse settlement in Canada. Findings from the 2016 excavation suggest the turf wall and the roasted bog iron ore discovered in 2015 were the result of natural processes. The possible settlement was initially discovered through satellite imagery in 2014, and archaeologists excavated the area in 2015 and 2016. Birgitta Linderoth Wallace, one of the leading experts of Norse archaeology in North America and an expert on the Norse site at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, is unsure of the identification of Point Rosee as a Norse site. Archaeologist Karen Milek was a member of the 2016 Point Rosee excavation and is a Norse expert. She also expressed doubt that Point Rosee was a Norse site as there are no good landing sites for their boats and there are steep cliffs between the shoreline and the excavation site. In their 8 November 2017 report, Sarah Parcak and Gregory Mumford, co-directors of the excavation, wrote that they &quot;found no evidence whatsoever for either a Norse presence or human activity at Point Rosee prior to the historic period&quot; and that &quot;none of the team members, including the Norse specialists, deemed this area as having any traces of human activity.&quot;

==Duration of Norse contact==
Settlements in continental North America aimed to exploit natural resources such as furs and in particular lumber, which was in short supply in Greenland. It is unclear why the short-term settlements did not become permanent, though it was likely in part because of hostile relations with the indigenous peoples, referred to as the &quot;Skræling&quot; by the Norse. Nevertheless, it appears that sporadic voyages to Markland for forages, timber, and trade with the locals could have lasted as long as 400 years.

James Watson Curran writes:From 985 to 1410, Greenland was in touch with the world. Then silence. In 1492 the Vatican noted that no news of that country &quot;at the end of the world&quot; had been received for 80 years, and the bishopric of the colony was offered to a certain ecclesiastic if he would go and &quot;restore Christianity&quot; there. He didn&#x27;t go.

<text>Lego Technic (stylized as LEGO Technic) is a line of Lego interconnecting plastic rods and parts. The purpose of this series is to create advanced models of working vehicles and machines, compared to the simpler brick-building properties of normal Lego.

==Overview==
The theme was introduced either as &quot;Expert Builder&quot; or &quot;Technical Sets&quot; (depending on market) in 1977, and was renamed &quot;LEGO Technic&quot; in 1982.

Technic sets are characterized by their use of special pieces, such as gears, axles, and pins, which allow the construction of working mechanisms and mechanical structures. Other special pieces include beams and plates with holes in them, through which the axles could be installed. Some sets also come with pneumatic pieces or electric motors. In recent years, Technic pieces have begun filtering down into other Lego sets as well, including the BIONICLE sets (which were once sold as part of the Technic line), as well as a great many others.

The style of Lego Technic sets has been changing over time. Technic sets produced since the year 2000 use a different construction method, described as &quot;studless construction&quot;. (Studs are the small circular knobs which appear on traditional Lego bricks.) This method utilizes beams and pins rather than Technic bricks.

Mindstorms, a Lego line of robotic products, also uses many Technic pieces, although it is sold as a separate line of products. The latest generation of the Mindstorms range, the Robot Inventor (released October 2020), as well as its predecessors the Mindstorms EV3 (released September 2013) and the Mindstorms NXT (released August 2006), are based on the studless construction method.

In June 2023, The Lego Group built a life-size 1:1 replica of the PEUGEOT 9x8 24H Le Mans Hybrid Hypercar containing 626,392 Lego pieces.

==Lego Technic components==

The Lego Technic system expands on the normal Lego bricks with a whole range of new bricks that offer new functions and building styles. The most significant change from normal Lego is that single-stud wide bricks (&#x27;beams&#x27;) have circular holes through their vertical face. These holes can accommodate pins, which enable two beams to be held securely together side-by-side, or hinged at an angle. The holes also act as bearings for axles, on which gears and wheels can be attached to create complex mechanisms. 
Studless beams (&quot;studs&quot; are the bumps traditionally associated with Lego parts), referred to as &#x27;liftarms&#x27;, were first introduced in 1989 and through the 1990s and 2000s, an increasing number of liftarm designs have been introduced over time.

===Gears===
Gears have been included within Lego Technic sets since 1977 as a way of transferring rotary power and gearing up or down the speed. Gears come in several sizes: 8-tooth, 16-tooth, 24-tooth, and 40-tooth spur gears; 12-tooth, 20-tooth, 28-tooth, and 36-tooth double bevel gears; and 12-tooth and-20 tooth single bevel gears. The double bevel gears are cut so they can also be meshed as spur gears. There is also a 16-tooth spur clutch gear, a 20-tooth double bevel clutch gear, and a 24-tooth friction gear that slips when a certain amount of torque is put on it to prevent motors from damaging any parts or burning themselves out.

In addition to standard gears, some kits include a rack, a clutch, and even worm gears and differential gears. The original differential from 1980 had a 28 tooth bevel gear, designed to be meshed with the 14 tooth bevel gears (replaced by the 12 tooth gears) to give 2:1 reduction. They can also be meshed with the newer double bevel gears. It was replaced in 1994 by a newer design incorporating 16-tooth and 24-tooth gears on opposite sides of the casing. The casing holds three 12 tooth bevel gears inside. In 2008, an updated version of the original differential has been released, optimised for studless construction with a 28 tooth bevel gear on the outside and three 12 tooth gears on the inside. With the release of the &#x27;Top Gear Rally Car&#x27; (42109) in 2020, yet another differential was created with a 28 tooth double bevel gear and five 12 tooth gears on the inside so that the differential could be rotated with gears above and next to the differential.

Chain links were also introduced as an additional way of connecting gears. Tension (resulting from the correct number of chain-link parts used), along with the combination of gearwheel-sizes used, is critical to reliable operation. 8-tooth gears are not recommended for this purpose.

Volvo Construction Equipment used a Lego model to develop an electric wheel loader.

===Motors===
The Lego Technic system has always included a variety of different electric motors. Broadly, these divide into those powered by batteries (held in a connected battery box) or by mains electricity (via a transformer.) Battery-powered is the most common.

The very earliest motors (p/n x469b) were 4.5 volt, and consisted of a modified &quot;Electric Train Motor&quot; (p/n x469) and along with the 4 driven bushes for wheels added an axle hole enabling axles of different lengths to be used. While these were released in kits with Technic parts they were not sold as Technic motors.

The first dedicated Technic motor was a 4.5 volt rounded brick (p/n 6216m) released in 1977 as part of the Expert Builder Power Pack (960-1) and Supplementary Set (870-1), this output via a small protruding axle that would rotate when the motor was powered. The motor was not geared, resulting in high-RPM, low-torque output. Gearboxes and a square casing were available. A 12 volt motor of the same physical dimensions as the 4.5 volt motor was also available in set 880-1. The 12 volt version is visually distinguishable by being black, rather than grey. The 4.5V and 12V motors were also compatible with the battery boxes and mains transformers used within the Trains series of the 1980s

The 4.5 volt motor was replaced by a similar but square 9 volt motor in 1990, as part of the new generation &quot;Electric System&quot; which dispensed with the pinned plugs and replaced them with regular bricks that incorporated contacts within the stud interfaces. This system gave more reliable contacts over time, as the pinned plugs had a tendency to go slack over time, or for the wires to fracture or come detached.

The 8297 &#x27;Motor Set&#x27; released in 2006 was capable of extremely high speeds and relatively high torque at the time, up to 1700 rpm and 14 N.cm, and was advertised as an accessory to motorise Technic vehicles during the 9V System &#x27;era&#x27;.

Recent motors contain an axle hole enabling axles of different lengths to be used.

Starting with the release of 8275 &#x27;Technic Bulldozer&#x27;, Power Functions (which used infrared to remote control) was introduced as a new electric system and started introducing motors of different sizes, including the M, L, XL and steering (Servo) motor.

The current electric motor systems are Powered Up and Control+, introduced with sets 42099 &#x27;X-treme Off-roader&#x27; and 42100 &#x27;Liebherr R 9800 Excavator&#x27;. As a result of the L and XL motors being able to calibrate to become steering motors, there is no dedicated servo motor, as there is no need for one.

===Pneumatics===
Lego pneumatics is a variety of Lego bricks which use air pressure and specialised components to perform various actions using the principles of pneumatics. The LEGO pneumatics components were first introduced in 1984, and have featured in a variety of LEGO Technic and LEGO Educational (DACTA) products. Lego pneumatic components include air pumps, pneumatic cylinders, pneumatic tubing, three-way valves, and air tanks. As of 2024, 34 Lego Technic sets that contain pneumatics have been released.

===Technic Figures===
Technic Figures are figures that appeared in Technic sets, appearing sporadically but heavily featured in the CyberSlam/Competition line. They were first introduced in 1986 in the Arctic Action line, and were produced until 2001. They are much larger and have several more joints than the standard minifigure, including bendable elbow and knee-joints. Each figure comes already assembled and is not meant to come apart, but parts can be popped off by pulling too hard. They can connect to both standard Lego System bricks and on Technic parts, and Technic pegs can fit in their hands.
27 different kinds of Technic figures were created, some sets included the same figures but with different accessories and stickers.

=== Technic Action Figures ===
In 1999 Lego Technic Introduced Lego Slizers (known as Throwbots in the US) which were colorful action figures built with Lego Technic parts and branded under Lego Technic. The Slizer sets were released between 1999 and 2000 consisting of 10 main figures Torch, Ski, Turbo, Scuba, Jet, Amazon, Granite, and Electro, Flare, Spark, and 2 Titan figures Millennium and Blaster. Slizers was later replaced by Lego RoboRiders in 2000. RoboRiders were similar in concept to Slizers with Technic Built figures with 6 main figures Swamp, Lava, Frost, Onyx, Dust, Power 4 mini builds and The Boss (Known as Super RoboRider internationally). RoboRiders was later replaced by Bionicle in 2001 which later spun off into its own line and considered not part of Lego Technic by 2003.

=== &quot;Studded&quot; (Beams) versus &quot;Studless&quot; (Liftarms) ===

Although liftarms (studless beams) have been present in Technic sets since 1989, the change from primarily studded to primarily studless construction around the year 2000 represented a major paradigm shift and has been quite controversial. Initially liftarms were used primarily as styling parts, or to create smaller sub-assemblies which attached to a studded chassis. With an increasing number of liftarm designs introduced, a tipping point was reached around the year 2000 with models introduced primarily constructed from liftarms instead of traditional beams.

The primary advantage of studless construction is the addition of new construction methods that were previously unavailable. Liftarms are exactly 1 unit width high, in contrast to studded beams, which are a non-integer multiple of one unit. It can be awkward to use studded beams in vertical structures because it is necessary to insert plates between the studded beams in order to get the holes to line up. Studless beams allow greater flexibility when building in multiple dimensions, while remaining compatible with &quot;classic&quot; studded beams. Some builders also believe that models constructed with studless beams look nicer than their studded counterparts.

However, studless construction also introduces disadvantages. Studless construction is not immediately intuitive, requiring the builder to think five or six steps ahead. While studded construction follows the classic bottom-to-top building pattern, studless construction requires building inside-to-outside. Studless constructions are noted to often be more flexible than an equivalent studded construction. This is due to the amount of flex in the clip-based pins which are used to attach studdless parts together, whereas studs provide a more rigid friction fit.

As of 2005, Lego has begun to re-incorporate studded bricks back into the Technic line, which can be seen in sets such as 8421 Mobile Crane. However, studded bricks are used primarily as to mount front grills in vehicles while transparent plates are used for lights.

===Power Functions===
In late 2007, a new motor system was released called &quot;Power Functions&quot;; it was included within Lego set 8275 Motorized Bulldozer. It comprised a set of motors, two IR receivers, remote control and a battery box, thus resulting in a remote-control model.


With these sets it is possible to build or convert manually-operated mechanical movement to motorized using electric motors which are controlled via switches or IR remote control. Lego has already started to design and sell Lego Technic models (sets) which can be easily retrofitted with the Power Functions system or third-party alternatives. For example, models like the 8294 Excavator and 8295 Telescopic Handler are sold like classic Lego Technic models with manual motorization but are designed with free space for the Power Functions components with factory instructions on how to perform the conversion to an electrically operated model.

The Power Functions line-up also includes a Linear Actuator currently not sold separately, but already used in many models like the 8294 Excavator and the 8043 Motorised Excavator.

=== Powered Up (Control+, Power Functions v2) ===
In 2018, Lego announced a new system for motorizing sets, to replace the Power Functions system. Early in release several names were used including Control+. and Power Functions v2; by 2020 the line was unified under the Lego Theme `Powered Up`.

This new system is controlled via Bluetooth using a smartphone app rather than a physical controller and is not backwards compatible with Power Functions. Components can be bought individually or as packs to either be used with or independently of retail sets. Lego launched two flagship sets to display the new systems functionality: 42100 Liebherr R 9800 and 42099 4x4 X-Treme Off-Roader.

Physically and electrically, the Powered Up system components are compatible with all other lego systems using the same 6-pin plug. This includes WeDo 2.0, Boost, Spike Prime, Mindstorms v4 as of 2020. However, software support between the various apps varies.

There’s a reason why these beautifully engineered bikes are so universally loved by the biking community, and we are confident our LEGO Technic version is a winner like its real-life namesake.&quot; and continued, “The set has a truly authentic design, features functional yet intricate working parts, provides a challenging build and is visually stunning. It’s also the largest ever LEGO Technic bike set and we know the building experience will be just as addictive as the adrenaline rush from taking the real thing out on the track.” Head of Brand and Product at BMW Motorrad Ralf Rodepeter commented, “When BMW Motorrad’s management announced the first-ever M-developed motorcycle, the BMW M 1000 RR, everyone knew that the result was going to be something special. In the same way, the LEGO Technic team realised it would take something never-seen-before to pay true tribute to the M RR. The result is both a motorbike and a Technic model that are state-of-the-art within their respective fields.”

=== McLaren Formula 1 Race Car ===
McLaren Formula 1 Race Car (set number: 42141) was released on 1 March 2022. The set consists of 1432 pieces.

This has been made possible by an agile collaboration with the LEGO Group team, who have truly embraced the spirit of our brave and bold approach to design. The final product looks fantastic, and we cannot wait to make this available to our fans.” McLaren&#x27;s Director of Licensing Lindsey Eckhouse discussed about the development of this set and explained, &quot;It was really trying to bring that full-scale adult-focused LEGO Technic model to life, and doing that in a way that worked [with regards to] some of our challenges. We started working on this in August or September 2020, and we actually don’t sign off the Formula 1 car until really the January of that year. So we were bringing to life the 2021 livery through LEGO Technic, but also trying to embody the spirit of the 2022 regulation changes in the sport, and ensure we had brand consistency from the sponsors that appear on the livery.&quot; and continued, &quot;A lot of time and focus went into, ‘How do we actually bring all of that together?’, and the timelines that ultimately work for LEGO Technic, which I think was the exciting part of the challenge and why the collaboration is so successful, because it brought all that together quite nicely.&quot;

=== Ferrari Daytona SP3 ===

<doc id="295768" wikidata="Q392734" url="?curid=295768" title="Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565">
<text>The Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, is a composition for organ by, according to the oldest sources, German composer Johann Sebastian Bach and is one of the most widely recognisable works in the organ repertoire. Although the date of its origin is unknown, scholars have suggested between 1704 and the 1740s (if by Bach). The piece opens with a toccata section followed by a fugue that ends in a coda, and is largely typical of the north German organ school of the Baroque era.

Little was known about its early existence until the piece was discovered in an undated manuscript produced by Johannes Ringk. It was first published in 1833 during the early Bach Revival period through the efforts of composer Felix Mendelssohn, who also performed the piece in 1840. It was not until the 20th century that its popularity rose above that of other organ compositions by Bach, as exemplified by its inclusion in Walt Disney&#x27;s 1940 animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot; that featured Leopold Stokowski&#x27;s orchestral transcription from 1927.

The piece has been subject to a wide, and often conflicting, variety of analyses. It is often described as a type of program music depicting a storm, while its depiction in &quot;Fantasia&quot; is suggestive of non-representational or absolute music. Scholars such as Peter Williams and Rolf Dietrich Claus argued against its authenticity, while Christoph Wolff defended the attribution to Bach. Other commentators ignored the doubts over its authenticity, or considered the attribution issue undecided.

==History==
The only extant near-contemporary source for BWV 565 is an undated copy by Johannes Ringk. According to the description provided by the Berlin State Library, where the manuscript is kept, and similar bibliographic descriptions, e.g. in the RISM catalogue, Ringk created his copy between 1740 and 1760. As far as is known, Ringk produced his first copy of a Bach score in 1730 when he was 12. According to Dietrich Kilian, who edited BWV 565 for the New Bach Edition, Ringk made his copy of the Toccata and Fugue between 1730 and 1740. In his critical commentary for Breitkopf &amp; Härtel&#x27;s 21st-century revised edition of the score, Jean-Claude Zehnder narrows the time of origin of the manuscript down to around the middle of the first half of the 1730s, based on an analysis of the evolution of Ringk&#x27;s handwriting. At the time Ringk was a student of Bach&#x27;s former student Johann Peter Kellner at Gräfenroda, and probably faithfully copied what his teacher put before him. There are some errors in the score such as note values not adding up to fill a measure correctly. Such defects show a carelessness deemed typical of Kellner, who left over 60 copies of works by Bach.

The title page of Ringk&#x27;s manuscript writes the title of the work in Italian as &quot;Toccata con Fuga&quot;, names Johann Sebastian Bach as the composer of the piece, and indicates its tonality as &quot;ex. d. #.&quot;, which is usually seen as the key signature being D minor. However, in Ringk&#x27;s manuscript the staves have no symbol at the key (which would be the usual way to write down a piece in D minor). In this sense, in Ringk&#x27;s manuscript, the piece is written down in D Dorian mode. Another piece listed as Bach&#x27;s was also known as Toccata and Fugue in D minor, and was equally entitled to the &quot;Dorian&quot; qualification. It was that piece, BWV 538, that received the &quot;Dorian&quot; nickname, that qualifier being effectively used to distinguish it from BWV 565. Most score editions of BWV 565 use the D minor key signature, unlike Ringk&#x27;s manuscript.


Ringk&#x27;s manuscript does not use a separate staff for the pedal part, which was common in the 18th century (notes to be played on the pedal were indicated by &quot;p.&quot; being written at the start of the sequence). Printed editions of the BWV 565 organ score invariably write the pedal line on a separate staff. In Ringk&#x27;s manuscript the upper staff is written down using the soprano clef (as was common in the time when the manuscript originated), where printed editions use the treble clef.
All other extant manuscript copies of the score date from at least several decades later: some of these, written in the 19th century, are related with each other in that they have similar solutions to the defects in the Ringk manuscript. Whether these derive from an earlier manuscript independent from Ringk&#x27;s (possibly in the C. P. E. Bach/Johann Friedrich Agricola/Johann Kirnberger circle) is debated by scholars. These near-identical 19th-century copies, the version Felix Mendelssohn knew, use the treble clef and a separate staff for the pedal. In general, the later copies show a less excessive use of fermatas in the opening measures and are more correct in making the note values fit the measures, but that may as well be from polishing a defective source as from deriving from a cleaner earlier source. In the later copies the work is named for instance &quot;Adagio&quot; and &quot;Fuga&quot; (for the respective parts of the work), or &quot;Toccata&quot; for the work as a whole.
The name &quot;Toccata&quot; is most probably a later addition, similar to the title of Toccata, Adagio and Fugue, BWV 564, because in the Baroque era such organ pieces would most commonly be called simply &quot;Prelude&quot; (&quot;Praeludium&quot;, etc.) or &quot;Prelude and Fugue&quot;. Ringk&#x27;s copy abounds in Italian &quot;tempo&quot; markings, fermatas (a characteristic feature of Ringk&#x27;s copies) and staccato dots, all very unusual features for pre-1740 German music.

German organ schools are distinguished into north German (e.g. Dieterich Buxtehude) and south German (e.g. Johann Pachelbel). The composition has stylistic characteristics from both schools: the stylus phantasticus, and other north German characteristics are most apparent. However, the numerous recitative stretches are rarely found in the works of northern composers and may have been inspired by Johann Heinrich Buttstett, a pupil of Pachelbel, whose few surviving free works, particularly his Prelude and Capriccio in D minor, exhibit similar features. A passage in the fugue of BWV 565 is an exact copy of a phrase in one of Johann Pachelbel&#x27;s D minor fantasias, and the first half of the subject is based on this Pachelbel passage as well. At the time it was however common practice to create fugues on other composers&#x27; themes.

==Structure==
BWV 565 exhibits a typical simplified north German structure with a short, free opening (toccata), a longer fugal section (fugue), and a short free closing section which is not officially named by notation.

===Toccata===
The Toccata begins with a single-voice flourish in the upper ranges of the keyboard, doubled at the octave and ornamented with a lower mordent. It then spirals toward the bottom, where a diminished seventh chord appears (which actually implies a dominant chord with a minor 9th against a tonic pedal), built one note at a time. This resolves into a D major chord:

Three short passages follow, each reiterating a short motif and doubled at the octave. The section ends with a diminished seventh chord which resolved into the tonic, D minor, through a flourish. The second section of the Toccata is a number of loosely connected figurations and flourishes; the pedal switches to the dominant key, A minor. This section segues into the third and final section of the Toccata, which consists almost entirely of a passage doubled at the sixth and comprising reiterations of the same three-note figure, similar to doubled passages in the first section. After a brief pedal flourish, the piece ends with a D minor suspended chord which eventually resolves.

===Fugue===
The subject of the four-voice fugue is made up entirely of sixteenth notes, with an implied pedal point set against a brief melodic subject that first falls, then rises. Such violinistic figures are frequently encountered in Baroque music and that of Bach, both as fugue subjects and as material in non-imitative pieces. Unusually, the answer is in the subdominant key, rather than the traditional dominant. Although technically a four-part fugue, most of the time there are only three voices, and some of the interludes are in two, or even one voice (notated as two). Although only simple triadic harmony is employed throughout the fugue, there is an unexpected C minor subject entry, and furthermore, a solo pedal statement of the subject—a unique feature for a Baroque fugue. Immediately after the final subject entry, the fugue resolves to a sustained B major chord.

===Coda===
A multi-sectional coda follows, marked &quot;Recitativo&quot;. Although only 17 bars long, it progresses through five tempo changes. The last bars are played &quot;Molto adagio&quot;, and the piece ends with a minor plagal cadence.

==Performance==
The performance time of the piece is usually around nine minutes, but shorter performance times (e.g. 8:15) and execution times of over 10:30 exist. The first section of the piece, the Toccata, takes somewhat less than a third of the total performance time.

As was common practice for German music of the 17th century, the intended registration is not specified, and performers&#x27; choices vary from simple solutions such as &quot;organo pleno&quot; to exceedingly complex ones, like those described by Harvey Grace.

==Reception==
In the first century of its existence the entire reception history of the Toccata and Fugue in D minor consists of being saved from oblivion by maybe not more than a single manuscript copy. Then it took about a century from its first publication as a little-known organ composition by Johann Sebastian Bach to becoming one of the signature pieces of the composer. The composition&#x27;s third century took it from Bach&#x27;s most often recorded organ piece to a composition with an unclear origin. Despite Mendelssohn&#x27;s opinion that it was &quot;at the same time learned and something for the people&quot;, followed by a fairly successful piano transcription in the second half of the 19th century, it was not until the 20th century that it rose above the average notability of an organ piece by Bach. The work&#x27;s appearance (in an orchestral transcription by Leopold Stokowski) in the 1940 Walt Disney film &quot;Fantasia&quot; contributed to its popularity, around which time scholars started to seriously doubt its attribution to Bach.

The composition has been deemed both &quot;particularly suited to the organ&quot; and &quot;strikingly unorganistic&quot;. It has been seen as united by a single ground-thought, but also as containing &quot;passages which have no connection whatever with the chief idea&quot;. It has been called &quot;entirely a thing of virtuosity&quot; yet also described as being &quot;not so difficult as it sounds&quot;. It has been described as some sort of program music depicting a storm, but also as abstract music, quite the opposite of program music depicting a storm. It has been presented as an emanation of the galant style, yet too dramatic to be anything near that style. Its period of origin has been assumed to have been as early as around 1704, and as late as the 1750s. Its defining characteristics have been associated with extant compositions by Bach (BWV 531, 549a, 578, 911, 914, 922 and several of the solo violin sonatas and partitas), and by others (including Nicolaus Bruhns and Johann Heinrich Buttstett), as well as with untraceable earlier versions for other instruments and/or by other composers. It has been deemed too simplistic for it to have been written down by Bach, and too much a stroke of genius to have been composed by anyone else but Bach.

What remains is &quot;the most famous organ work in existence&quot;, that in its rise to fame was helped by various arrangements, including bombastic piano settings, versions for full symphonic orchestra, and alternative settings for more modest solo instruments.

===Score editions===
In 1833, BWV 565 was published for the first time, in the third of three bundles of &quot;little-known&quot; organ compositions by Bach. The edition was conceived and partly prepared by Felix Mendelssohn, who already had BWV 565 in his repertoire by 1830. In 1846, C. F. Peters published the &quot;Toccata con Fuga&quot; as No. 4 in their fourth volume of organ compositions by Bach. In 1867, the Bach Gesellschaft included it in Band 15 of its complete edition of Bach&#x27;s works. Novello published the work in 1886 as No. 1 in their sixth volume of Bach&#x27;s organ works.

In the early 1910s, Albert Schweitzer collaborated with Charles-Marie Widor to compile a complete edition of Bach&#x27;s organ compositions, published by Schirmer. In 1912, BWV 565 was published in the second volume, containing works of Bach&#x27;s &quot;first master period&quot;. Around the start of the First World War, Augener republished William Thomas Best&#x27;s late 19th-century edition of the work in volume 2 of their complete edition of Bach&#x27;s organ works.

After 1950, when the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis was published, it was no longer needed to indicate the Toccata and Fugue in D minor as &quot;Peters Vol. IV, No. 4&quot;, as &quot;BGA Volume XV p. 267&quot;, as &quot;Novello VI, 1&quot;, or without &quot;Dorian&quot;, to distinguish it from the Toccata and Fugue with the same key signature. From then on the work has been simply BWV 565, and the other, the so-called &quot;Dorian&quot;, has been BWV 538. In 1964, the New Bach Edition included BWV 565 in Series IV, Volume 6, with its critical commentary published in Volume 5 in 1979. Dietrich Kilian, the editor of these volumes, explains in the introduction to Vol. 6 that the New Bach Edition prefers to stay close to authoritative early sources for their score presentations. For BWV 565 that means staying close to the Ringk manuscript. Consequently, the name of the piece was again given in Italian as &quot;Toccata con Fuga&quot;, and the piece was again written down in D Dorian (i.e. without at the key). However, more modern conventions were maintained with regard to using the treble clef in the upper staff and using a separate staff for the pedal.

A facsimile of Ringk&#x27;s manuscript was published in 2000. In the 21st century, the facsimile became available online, as well as various downloadable files of previously printed editions. In 2010, Breitkopf &amp; Härtel initiated a new edition of Bach&#x27;s organ works, with BWV 565 appearing in its fourth volume.

===Performances and recordings===

The first major public performance was by Mendelssohn, on 6 August 1840, in Leipzig. The concert was very well received by the critics, among them Robert Schumann, who admired the work&#x27;s famous opening as an example of Bach&#x27;s sense of humor. Franz Liszt adopted the piece into his organ repertoire. He used the glockenspiel stop for the &quot;Prestissimo&quot; triplets in the opening section, and the quintadena stop for the repeated notes in bars 12–15.

The work was first recorded (in abridged form as &quot;Toccata and Finale&quot;) by John J. McClellan on the Salt Lake Tabernacle organ in Salt Lake City in late August or early September 1910 by the Columbia Graphophone Company, who released it in the US in 1911 on Columbia 10-inch disc A945 and in the UK on Columbia-Rena disc 1704, which is one of the first commercial pipe organ recordings. In 1926, the organ version of BWV 565 was recorded on 78 rpm discs. In a 1928 concert program, Schweitzer indicated BWV 565 as one of Bach&#x27;s &quot;best-known&quot; compositions, considering it to be a youth work. Schweitzer&#x27;s first recording of the piece was issued in 1935. In 1951, he recorded the work again.

In the 1950s, a recording of Helmut Walcha playing BWV 565 on organ was released. In that, and subsequent releases of Walcha&#x27;s recordings of BWV 565 on Deutsche Grammophon (DG), there is an obvious evolution of the work from &quot;one among many&quot; organ compositions by Bach to a definite signature piece by the composer. In early Archiv Produktion releases, the list on the sleeve contained the organ compositions in the order they appeared on the recording without distinction; in the 1960s, BWV 565 began to be listed first; by the 1980s, the font size for BWV 565 was larger than that of the other compositions; and in the 1990s, Walcha&#x27;s 1963 recording of the piece became the only piece by Bach included in DG&#x27;s &quot;Classic Mania&quot; CD set with popular tunes by various classical composers. Similarly, the album sleeves of Marie-Claire Alain&#x27;s recordings of BWV 565 in the 1960s listed the piece in the same font as the other recorded works, but by the 1980s it was in a larger font. US record companies seemed faster in putting BWV 565 forward as Bach&#x27;s best-known organ piece. In 1955, E. Power Biggs recorded the Toccata 14 times, played on different European organs, and Columbia issued those recordings on a single album.

Hans-Joachim Schulze describes the force of the piece on a record sleeve:Here is elemental and unbounded power, in impatiently ascending and descending runs and rolling masses of chords, that only with difficulty abates sufficiently to give place to the logic and balance of the fugue. With the reprise of the initial Toccata, the dramatic idea reaches its culmination amidst flying scales and with an ending of great sonority.

Organists recording BWV 565 more than once include Jean Guillou, Lionel Rogg and Wolfgang Rübsam. Some musicians, such as Karl Richter, who did not record organ performances very often, included BWV 565 in their anthologies. By the end of the century, hundreds of organists had recorded BWV 565. In the 21st century, several recordings of BWV 565 became available online, such as a recording included in James Kibbie&#x27;s Bach Organ Works project and John Scott Whiteley&#x27;s broadcast for BBC TV made in 2001.

===Piano arrangements===

Bach&#x27;s Toccata and Fugue was not performed on the organ exclusively. The title page of the first publication of the piece already indicated that performance on the piano by one or two players was possible. From 1868 to 1881, Karl Tausig&#x27;s piano transcription of the Toccata and Fugue in D minor was performed four times in the Gewandhaus in Leipzig. Many more piano transcriptions of BWV 565 were published, for instance by Louis Brassin, Ferruccio Busoni, Alfred Cortot, and by Max Reger in transcriptions for both piano two hands and four hands.

Tausig&#x27;s version of the work was recorded on piano rolls several times in the first decades of the 20th century. In the mid-1920s, Marie Novello recorded the Tausig piano version of BWV 565 on 78 rpm discs. Percy Grainger&#x27;s 1931 recording on the piano, based on the Tausig and Busoni transcriptions, was written out as a score by Leslie Howard, and then recorded by other artists. Ignaz Friedman recorded the piano version he had published in 1944. From the 1950s to the first decades of the 21st century, there were half a dozen recordings of Tausig&#x27;s piano version, and several dozen of Busoni&#x27;s.

===In Bach&#x27;s biographies===
In Johann Nikolaus Forkel&#x27;s early 19th-century biography of Bach, the work is left unmentioned. Forkel probably did not even know of the composition. In C. L. Hilgenfeldt&#x27;s biography it is merely listed among the published works. Hilgenfeldt considers the Toccata and Fugue in F major the most accomplished of Bach&#x27;s toccatas for organ. In Karl Hermann Bitter&#x27;s 1865 Bach biography, BWV 565 is only listed in an appendix.

In 1873, Philipp Spitta devoted somewhat less than a page to the work in the first volume of his Bach biography. He assumed the work was written in the first year of Bach&#x27;s second Weimar period (1708–1717). He saw more north German characteristics (Buxtehude&#x27;s restless style) in the form of the Toccata, rather than south German (Pachelbel&#x27;s simple and quiet approach). Spitta considered the fugue &quot;particularly suited to the organ, and more especially effective in the pedal part.&quot; His description of the piece refers to long sections that are surfeit: &quot;rocking passages which have no connection whatever with the chief idea&quot; and organ recitatives alternating with &quot;ponderous, roaring masses of chords&quot;. Spitta likened some phrases of the Toccata and Fugue to another early work, the Fugue in G minor, BWV 578.

Spitta also detects a rhythmic figure that appears briefly in the concluding part of the work (bar 137) which, extensively elaborated, reappears in the keyboard Prelude in A minor, BWV 922, a work he supposes to have been composed around 1710. In Reginald Lane Poole&#x27;s 1882 biography, the work is again merely listed. In the 1905 first version of his Bach biography, Albert Schweitzer leaves BWV 565 unmentioned in the chapter on the organ works. In André Pirro&#x27;s 1906 biography, Bach&#x27;s organ toccatas are only mentioned as a group. He considers none of them written before Bach&#x27;s later Weimar years (so closer to 1717 than to 1708).

Up to this point, none of the biographers seem to have given any special attention to BWV 565. If mentioned, it is listed or described along with other organ compositions, but is far from being considered the best or the most famous of Bach&#x27;s organ compositions, or even of his toccatas. However, that was about to change. In 1908, Schweitzer reworked his biography for its first German edition. In that edition he indicates the work as &quot;well known&quot;. After listing several organ works in which Bach showed himself a pupil of Buxtehude, Frescobaldi, and various contemporary Italian composers, Schweitzer describes the Toccata and Fugue in D minor as a work in which the composer rises to independent mastery:

In Hubert Parry&#x27;s 1909 Bach biography, the work is qualified as &quot;well known&quot; and &quot;one of the most effective of [Bach&#x27;s] works in every way&quot;. He calls the Toccata &quot;brilliantly rhapsodical&quot;, more or less follows Spitta in the description of the fugue, and is most impressed by the coda: &quot;It would be hard to find a concluding passage more imposing or more absolutely adapted to the requirements of the instrument than this coda.&quot; Apart from seeing Buxtehude&#x27;s influence, he likens the theme of the fugue to the theme of the fugue of Prelude and Fugue in B minor, BWV 544, which he considers a late work.

In the 1979 first volume of his Bach biography, Alberto Basso calls BWV 565 &quot;famosissimo&quot; (most famous) and &quot;celebratissima&quot; (most celebrated), maintaining that the popularity of these works hinges entirely on this composition. He sees it as a youth work, composed before 1708, that with its underdeveloped fugue is stylistically eclectic but unified without breaking continuity. He links it to the northern school, and mentions Tausig, Busoni and Stokowki as influencing its trajectory. Basso warns against seeing too much in the composition. He feels it may be within reach of everyone but is neither an incantation, nor ridden with symbolism and even less a sum of whatever.

In his 1999 Bach biography, devotes a few pages to the Toccata and Fugue. He considers it an early work, probably composed for testing the technical qualities of a new organ. He feels that the crescendo that develops through arpeggios, gradually building up to the use of hundreds of pipes at the same time, can show exactly at what point the wind system of the organ might become inadequate. In his view, some of the more unusual characteristics of the piece can be explained as resulting from Bach&#x27;s capacity as an organ tester.

Christoph Wolff, in his 2000 Bach biography, sees BWV 565 as an early work. In his view, it is &quot;as refreshingly imaginative, varied, and ebullient as it is structurally undisciplined and unmastered&quot;.

===In books on Bach&#x27;s organ works===
Before his 1906 Bach biography, André Pirro had already written a book on Bach&#x27;s organ works. In that book he devoted less than a page to BWV 565, and considers it some kind of program music depicting a tempest, including flashes of lightning and rumbling thunder. Pirro supposes Bach had success with this music in the smaller German courts he visited. All in all, he judges the music as superficial, not more than a stepping stone in Bach&#x27;s development.

In the early 1920s, Harvey Grace published a series of articles on Bach&#x27;s organ works. He considers that the notes of the piece are not too difficult to play, but that an organist performing the work is primarily challenged by interpretation. He gives tips on how to perform the work so that it does not sound like a &quot;meaningless scramble&quot;. He describes the fugue as slender and simple, but only a &quot;very sketchy example of the form&quot;. In his description of the piece, Grace refers to Pirro, elaborating Pirro&#x27;s &quot;storm&quot; analogy, and like Pirro, he seems convinced Bach went touring with the piece. His suggestions for the organ registration make comparisons with how the piece would be played by an orchestra.

In 1948, Hermann Keller wrote that the Toccata and Fugue was uncharacteristic for Bach, but nonetheless bore some of his distinguishing marks. His description of the piece echoes earlier storm analogies. Keller sees the opening bars&#x27; unison passages as &quot;descending like a lightning flash, the long roll of thunder of the broken chords of the full organ, and the stormy undulation of the triplets&quot;.

In 1980, Peter Williams wrote about BWV 565 in the first volume of his &quot;The Organ Music of J.S.Bach&quot;. The author warns against numerological over-interpretation like that of Volker Gwinner. Many parts of the composition are described as typical of Bach. Williams sees stylistic matches with Pachelbel, with the north German organ school, and with the Italian violin school, but sees various unusual features of the composition as well. Williams questions the authenticity of the piece, based on its various unusual features, and elaborates the idea that the piece may have a violin version ancestor. The reworked edition of this book, in one volume, appeared in 2003, and devotes more pages to discussing the authenticity and possible prior versions of BWV 565. In the meantime, Williams had written a 1981 article on the authenticity of BWV 565; this was followed by numerous publications by other scholars on the same topic.

&quot;J. S. Bach as Organist&quot;, a 1986 collection of essays edited by George Stauffer and Ernest May, discussed the registration Bach would have used for BWV 565.

===Arrangements for symphony orchestra===

Around the same time as Grace made comparisons with an orchestral version in his performance suggestions, Edward Elgar was producing orchestrations of two organ pieces by Bach, which did not include BWV 565. Elgar did not particularly like the work, nor Schweitzer&#x27;s glowing comments about it.

In 1927, Leopold Stokowski recorded his orchestration of BWV 565 with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Soon the idea was emulated by other musicians. An orchestration was performed in Carnegie Hall in 1928, Henry Wood (pseudonymously, as &quot;Paul Klenovsky&quot;) arranged his orchestration before the end of the decade. By the mid-1930s, Leonidas Leonardi had published his orchestration, and Alois Melichar&#x27;s orchestration was recorded in 1939.

In 1947, Eugene Ormandy recorded his orchestration of the piece with the Philadelphia Orchestra. The score of Stokowski&#x27;s arrangement was published in 1952. Other orchestrations of the piece were provided by Fabien Sevitzky, René Leibowitz (1958), Lucien Cailliet (1967) and Stanisław Skrowaczewski (1968).

===In film===

BWV 565 was used as film music well before the sound film era, becoming a cliché to illustrate horror and villainy. Its first uses in sound film included the 1931 film &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; and the 1934 film &quot;The Black Cat&quot;.

After 1936, another approach to using BWV 565 in film was under consideration. Oskar Fischinger had previously used Bach&#x27;s Third Brandenburg Concerto to accompany abstract animations and suggested to Stokowski that his orchestral version of BWV 565 could be used in the same way. Later in 1937, while in California, Stokowski and Disney discussed the idea of making a short animated film of &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; by Dukas for Disney Studios, the intention being to introduce classical music to a younger and broader audience. Similar in spirit to the popular series of &quot;Silly Symphonies,&quot; the short film proved costly to produce. However, starting with the Toccata and Fugue and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice, Stokowski, Disney and the music critic Deems Taylor chose other compositions to incorporate into their film project, known as &quot;The Concert Piece.&quot; By the time Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot; was released in 1940, the animations accompanying BWV 565 had been made semi-abstract, although Fischinger&#x27;s original idea that the performance of the music start with showing Stokowski directing his orchestra was preserved. Taylor begins his narrative with, &quot;What you’re going to see is the designs and pictures and stories of what music inspired in the minds and imaginations of a group of artists.&quot; The opening number, the &quot;Toccata and Fugue,&quot; will be absolute music—music that exists for its own sake—and will try to depict what might go on in the mind of the person listening to it. &quot;At first you are more or less conscious of the orchestra,&quot; Taylor explains, &quot;so our picture opens with a series of impressions of the conductor and the players. Then the music begins to suggest other things to your imagination—oh, just masses of color, or cloud forms, or vague shadows, or geometrical objects floating in space.&quot; In the 1942 cinema release of the film by RKO, the Toccata and Fugue was cut entirely, only to return in a 1946 re-release. &quot;Fantasia&quot; contributed significantly to the popularity of the Toccata and Fugue.

The 1950 film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; used BWV 565 as a joking reference to the horror genre. The piece has appeared in many other films, including &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), in which it is played by Captain Nemo on the organ of the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, before the submarine&#x27;s pitiless and apparently unmotivated attack on a ship. BWV 565 also appeared in Fellini&#x27;s 1960 &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;. The 1962 film adaptation of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; used BWV 565 in the suspense and horror sense. It is used &quot;without irony and in an apocalyptic spirit updated from its earlier Gothic implications&quot; at the beginning and end of the 1975 dystopian science fiction film &quot;Rollerball&quot;. Shortened to two minutes in length, BWV 565 was used as the introductory theme for the French animation &quot;Once Upon a Time... Man&quot;, in 26 episodes between 1978 and 1981.

Ennio Morricone took inspiration from the score BWV 565/1 for the 1965 film &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; of Sergio Leone. Morricone used the trumpet musical theme &quot;La resa dei conti&quot; (&quot;Sixty Seconds to What?&quot;) for the opening baroque mordent of J. S. Bach&#x27;s Toccata. The cowboy shootout with Gian Maria Volonté takes place in a deconsecrated church, turned into a pigsty, where the theme is heard on the organ at full blast. According to , &quot;It is [...] hard to establish what led the composer to quote Bach—perhaps the shared key of D minor led to the idea of the organ, whereas the small church might have at most accommodated nothing more than a run-down harmonium. In any case, for a classically trained musician such a glaring reference to one of the most hackneyed commonplaces of Western art music—certainly the most hackneyed within Bach&#x27;s output (although its authorship has long been disputed)—clashes with the alleged intention of paying homage to the Eisenach maestro.&quot; In his autobiographical book written with , Morricone wrote that, &quot;The death ritual carried out in a church convinced me to use the Bach quotation and the organ. Volonté&#x27;s gestures in that sequence reminded me of some paintings of Rembrandt and Vermeer that Leone was fond of. Those artists lived in an epoch close to Bach, and with my music I decided to look at that kind of past.&quot;

===Authenticity research and reconstructions===
A certain uneasiness regarding the authorship of BWV 565 had been around long before the 1980s. From Hilgenfeldt in 1850, to Elgar in the 1920s, to Basso in the late 1970s, the extraordinary popularity of the piece seems to have taken scholars and musicians by surprise. Of Mendelssohn&#x27;s prophecy that it was something for both the erudite and the masses, only the latter part had been fulfilled. Some scholars who analysed the composition&#x27;s counterpoint felt it was substandard. They said it was stylistically too close to the galant style of the later 18th century to be an early 18th-century composition. Its presumed time of composition shifted around. Some felt the composition was too modern to have been composed by a young Bach, or too simplistic to have been composed by a middle-aged Bach. Although many commentators have invoked Bach&#x27;s genius to explain the dislocated modernity in an immature composition, an increasing number of scholars felt unsatisfied with such an intangible explanation.

In a 1981 article, Peter Williams reiterated the speculations, from which he saw a way out of the conundrum, already featured in his 1980 book on Bach&#x27;s organ compositions:
* The piece was originally composed for violin, not necessarily by Bach (that would explain its &quot;simplicity&quot;);
* It was later transcribed for the organ, not necessarily by Bach (that would explain its &quot;modernity&quot;).

The analysis of the material sources for the piece, its oldest surviving manuscripts, although insufficiently pursued according to some scholars, was seen as too limited to give a conclusive answer to these questions. What was available from that branch of the research could be explained in opposite ways. Likewise, whether the more elaborate stylistic evidence was considered conclusive or merely circumstantial, depended on who was trying to prove what.

In 1982, David Humphreys suggested that BWV 565 may have been composed and/or arranged by Kellner, or by someone from the circle around Kellner. Despite many stylistic similarities, however, Kellner was ruled out a quarter of a century later: &quot;in comparison with the style of Kellner, BWV 565 more resembles the style of J. S. Bach&quot;; &quot;many of Kellner&#x27;s keyboard pieces revealed that his style boasts pronounced &quot;galant&quot; elements ... this clearly stands in strong contrast to the dramatic style of the Toccata BWV 565&quot;.

A violin composition by Bach&#x27;s eldest son Wilhelm Friedemann, transcribed for the organ by Ringk, was named as another possible source. However, according to 21st-century statistical analysis, Wilhelm Friedemann was even less likely to have been the composer of the Fugue than Kellner. The same research indicated that large portions of the Fugue were consistent with the style of Johann Ludwig Krebs, but with more than half of the Fugue more likely composed by J. S. Bach. After initially confirming Williams&#x27;s doubts about the authorship of BWV 565, by the second decade of the 21st century, statistical analysis left the attribution issue undecided. No-one had found a composer more compatible with the style of its fugue than Bach himself. In the words of Jean-Claude Zehnder, who was sympathetic towards the violin version reconstruction: &quot;The matter still remains open, despite the scholarly discourse that began in 1981. Until proof of the contrary, BWV 565 should be considered as a work by Johann Sebastian Bach.&quot; No edition of the Bach Werke Verzeichnis has listed BWV 565 among the works seen as spurious or doubtful, nor does the work&#x27;s entry on the website of the Bach Archiv Leipzig mention any doubts.

====Attribution question====
In 1961, Antony Davies remarked that the Toccata was void of counterpoint. Half a decade later, BWV 565 was further questioned. Walter Emery advocated that scepticism was a necessary condition to approaching the history of Bach&#x27;s organ compositions, and Friedrich Blume saw problems with the traditional historiography of Bach&#x27;s youth. Roger Bullivant thought the fugue too simple for Bach and saw characteristics that were incompatible with his style:
* Conclusion of the piece on a minor plagal cadence
* A pedal statement of the subject, unaccompanied by other voices
* Trill in bars 86 to 90
These doubts about the authorship of BWV 565 were elaborated by Peter Williams in a 1981 article. Hypotheses proposed by Williams in that article included that BWV 565 may have been composed after 1750 and may have been based on an earlier composition for another instrument, supposedly violin. Williams added more stylistic problems to the ones already mentioned by Bullivant, among others the parallel octaves throughout the opening of the toccata, the true subdominant answers in the fugue, and the primitive harmonies throughout the piece, with countersubjects in the fugue frequently moving through thirds and sixths only. All of these characteristics are either unique or extremely rare in organ music of the first half of the 18th century.

In 1995, Rolf Dietrich Claus decided against the authenticity of BWV 565, mainly based on the stylistic characteristics of the piece. He named another problem—in its first measure the composition contains a C, a note organs in Bach&#x27;s time rarely had, and which Bach almost never used in his organ compositions. In his book on BWV 565, which he expanded in 1998 to counter some of the criticisms it received, Claus also dismisses the prior-version options suggested by Williams, noting that the toccata was an unknown genre for violin solo compositions of the time. Several essays in John Butt&#x27;s Cambridge Companion on Bach discuss the attribution problems of BWV 565. Other biographers and scholars have left these attribution and prior-version theories unmentioned, or explained the atypical characteristics of the composition by indicating it was a very early composition by Bach, probably written during his stay in Arnstadt (1703–1706).

At the end of the 20th century, Hans Fagius wrote:

The authorship debate has continued in the 21st century. Wolff calls it a pseudo-problem. Williams suggested that the piece may have been created by another composer who must have been born in the beginning of the 18th century, since details of style (such as triadic harmony, spread chords, and the use of solo pedal) may indicate post-1730, or even post-1750 idioms. Statistical analysis conducted by Peter van Kranenburg in 2006 confirmed the fugue was atypical for Bach, but failed to find a composer more likely to have composed it than Bach. David Schulenberg feels that the attribution of BWV 565 to Bach is doubtful. Richard Douglas Jones takes no position with regard to the composition&#x27;s authenticity. In 2009, Reinmar Emans wrote that Claus and Wolff had diametrically opposed views on the reliability of Ringk as a copyist, inspired by their respective positions in the authenticity debate, and thinks that sort of speculation unhelpful.

====Anterior version hypothesis and reconstructions====
The other hypothesis elaborated by Williams is that BWV 565 may have been a transcription of a lost solo violin piece. Parallel octaves and the preponderance of thirds and sixths may be explained by a transcriber&#x27;s attempt to fill in harmony which, if preserved as is, would be inadequately thin on a pipe organ. This is corroborated by the fact that the subject of the fugue, and certain passages (such as bars 12–15), are evidently inspired by string music. Bach is known to have transcribed solo violin works for organ at least twice: the first movement of the Partita in E major for solo violin, BWV 1006, was converted by Bach into the solo organ part of the opening movement of the cantata &quot;Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir&quot;, BWV 29. Bach also transcribed the Fugue movement of Sonata in G minor for solo violin, BWV 1001, as the second half of Prelude and Fugue in D minor for organ, BWV 539.

This notion inspired a new theory of adaptation: the reconstruction. Reconstructions have been applied to several other works by Bach, with variable success. A reconstruction for violin has been played by Jaap Schröder and Simon Standage. The violinist Andrew Manze produced his own reconstruction, also in A minor, which he has performed and recorded. In 2000, Mark Argent proposed a scordatura five-stringed cello instead. Williams proposed a violoncello piccolo or a five-stringed cello as alternative possibilities in 2003. A new violin version was created by scholar Bruce Fox-Lefriche in 2004. In 2005, Eric Lewin Altschuler wrote that if the first version of BWV 565 was written for a stringed instrument the most likely candidate would have been a lute. Yet another violin version was created by Chad Kelly and performed by Rachel Podger on her 2022 album &quot;Tutta Sola&quot;.

In 1997, Bernhard Billeter proposed a harpsichord toccata original, which was deemed unlikely by Williams. However, Billeter&#x27;s argument makes authorship by Bach more likely: Bach&#x27;s harpsichord toccatas (most of them early works) have simplistic elements and quirks similar to BWV 565. Bach&#x27;s early keyboard works, especially the free ones like Preludes and Toccatas, cannot always be clearly separated into organ pieces and harpsichord pieces. Spitta had already remarked on the similarity between a passage in BWV 565 and one in the harpsichord Prelude BWV 921; Robert Marshall compares the continuation patterns and sequences of the harpsichord Toccata BWV 911, and the Fugue theme of the harpsichord Toccata BWV 914, with the same of BWV 565.

===Other media===
In 1935, Hermann Hesse wrote a poem about the piece, (&quot;On a toccata by Bach&quot;), which contributed to its fame.

Recordings of BWV 565 that have appeared on popular music charts include Sky&#x27;s 1980 rock-inspired recording (#83 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, #5 on UK Singles Chart) and Vanessa-Mae&#x27;s 1994 violin recording (#24 on the Billboard charts). In 1993, Salvatore Sciarrino made an arrangement for solo flute, recorded by Mario Caroli. A version for solo horn was arranged by Zsolt Nagy and has been performed by Frank Lloyd. Another version for solo viola was arranged and recorded by Marco Misciagna. In the mid-1990s, Fred Mills, then trumpet player for Canadian Brass, created an adaptation for brass quintet that became a worldwide standard for brass ensembles. 2 Unlimited&#x27;s 1994 hit &quot;The Real Thing&quot; uses BWV 565 and, in a list published by Classic FM and PRS for Music, was revealed to be among the best-selling pop singles to incorporate classical music.

In 2020, rapper Playboi Carti sampled this song in the song &quot;Vamp Anthem&quot;.

<text>The epact (, from () = added days) used to be described by medieval computists as the age of a phase of the Moon in days on 22 March; in the newer Gregorian calendar, however, the epact is reckoned as the age of the ecclesiastical moon on 1 January. Its principal use is in determining the date of Easter by computistical methods. It varies (usually by 11 days) from year to year, because of the difference between the solar year of 365366 days and the lunar year of 354355 days.

==Lunar calendar==

Epacts can also be used to relate dates in the lunar calendar to dates in the common solar calendar.

===Solar and lunar years===

A solar calendar year has 365 days (366 days in leap years). A lunar calendar year has 12 lunar months which alternate between 30 and 29 days for a total of 354 days (in leap years, one of the lunar months has a day added; since a lunar year lasts a little over  days, a leap year arises every second or third year rather than every fourth.)

If a solar and lunar year start on the same day, then after one year the start of the solar year is 11 days after the start of the lunar year. These excess days are epacts, and have to be added to the lunar year to complete the solar year; or from the complementary perspective they are added to the day of the solar year to determine the day in the lunar year.

After two years the difference is 22 days, and after 3 years, 33 days. Whenever the epact reaches or exceeds 30 days, an extra (embolismic or intercalary) lunar month is inserted into the lunar calendar, and the epact is reduced by 30 days.

Leap days extend both the solar and lunar year, so they do not affect epact calculations for any other dates.

===19-year cycle===
The solar calendar year is slightly shorter than days, while the synodic month, on average, is slightly longer than days meaning both are non-integers. This gets corrected in the following way. Nineteen tropical years are deemed to be as long as 235 synodic months (Metonic cycle). A cycle can last 6939 or 6940 full days, depending on whether there are 4 or 5 leap days in this 19-year period.

After 19 years the lunations should fall the same way in the solar years, so the epact should repeat after 19 years. However, and this is not an integer multiple of the full cycle of 30 epact numbers ( not 0). So after 19 years the epact must be corrected by +1 in order for the cycle to repeat over 19 years. This is the (&quot;leap of the moon&quot;). The sequence number of the year in the 19-year cycle is called the golden number. The extra 209 days fill 7 embolismic months, for a total of 

===Lilian (Gregorian) epacts===
When the Gregorian calendar reform was instituted in 1582, the lunar cycle previously used with the Julian calendar to complete the calculation of Easter dates was adjusted also, in accordance with a (modification of the) scheme devised by Aloysius Lilius.
There were two adjustments to the old lunar cycle:
* a &quot;solar equation&quot;, decrementing the epact by 1, whenever the Gregorian calendar drops a leap day (3 times in 400 calendar years), and
* a &quot;lunar equation&quot;, incrementing the epact by 1, 8 times in 2500 calendar years (7 times after an interval of 300 years, and the 8th time after an interval of 400 years).

The revised &quot;solar equation&quot; was intended to adjust for the Gregorian change in the solar calendar, if they were applied at 1 January of the Julian calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar as the reformers implemented it; moreover the corrections to the solar calendar are leap days, whereas there are 30 epact values for a mean lunar month of and a bit: Therefore changing the epact by 1 day does not exactly compensate for a dropped leap day. The &quot;lunar equation&quot; only approximately adjusts for what had (by 1582) been seen after many centuries of recording, that the Moon moves a little faster than the expectation of the rate used for it in the old lunar cycle. By 1582 it was noted (for example, in the text of the bull &quot;Inter gravissimas&quot; itself) that the new and full moons were at that point occurring &quot;four days and something more&quot; sooner than the old lunar cycle indicated.

== History ==
The discovery of the epact for computing the date of Easter has been attributed to Patriarch Demetrius I of Alexandria, who held office from 189–232 . In the year 214 he used the epact to produce an Easter calendar, which has not survived, which used an eight-year luni-solar cycle.
A subsequent application of the epact to an Easter calendar, using a sixteen-year cycle, is found in the Paschal Table of Hippolytus, a 112 year list of Easter dates beginning in the year 222 which is inscribed on the side of a statue found in Rome. Augustalis, whose dates had been disputed from the third to the fifth century,
computed a (&quot;little tablet&quot;) of Easter dates. As reconstructed, it uses epacts (here the age of the moon on 1 January) and an 84 year luni-solar cycle to compute the dates of Easter using a base date of 213 . If we accept Augustalis&#x27;s earlier dates, his &quot;laterculus&quot; extends from 213–312  and Augustalis originated the use of epacts to compute the date of Easter.

As early as the fourth century we see Easter computus using the epact and the nineteen-year Metonic cycle in Alexandria, and subsequent computistical tables were influenced by the structure of the Alexandrian calendar. The epact was taken as the age of the Moon on 26 Phamenoth (22 March in the Julian calendar) but that value of the epact also corresponded to the age of the Moon on the last epagomenal day of the preceding year. Thus the epact can be seen as having been established at the beginning of the current year. Subsequent Easter tables, such as those of Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria, which covered 100 years beginning in 380 , and of his successor Bishop Cyril, which covered 95 years beginning in 437  discussed the computation of the epact in their introductory texts. Under the influence of Dionysius Exiguus and later, of Bede, the &quot;Alexandrian Easter Tables&quot; were adopted throughout Europe where they established the convention that the epact was the age of the Moon on 22 March. This Dionysian epact fell into disuse after the introduction of a perpetual calendar based on the golden number, which made the calculation of epacts unnecessary for ordinary computistical calculations.

Two factors led to the creation of three new forms of the epact in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The first was the increasing error of computistical techniques, which led to the introduction of a new Julian epact around 1478 , to be used for practical computations of the phase of the Moon for medical or astrological purposes. With the Gregorian reform of the calendar in 1582, two additional epacts came into use. The first was the Lilian epact, developed by Aloisius Lilius as an element of the ecclesiastical computations using the Gregorian calendar. The Lilian epact included corrections for the motions of the Sun and the Moon that broke the fixed relationship between the epact and the golden number. The second new epact was a simple adjustment of the practical Julian epact to account for the ten-day change produced by the Gregorian Calendar.

<text>The University District (commonly the U District) is a neighborhood and a major district in central northeastern Seattle, Washington, comprising several distinct neighborhoods. The main campus of the University of Washington (UW) is located in the district, lending its name to both the district as well as University Way NE (commonly The Ave). The neighborhood lies north of Portage Bay and the Lake Washington Ship Canal and generally east of Interstate 5.

The area, originally a Duwamish settlement, was surveyed by the territorial government in 1855 and opened to settlement in 1867. Real estate developers created the Brooklyn neighborhood on the west side of the district in the 1890s, which was followed by the relocation of the UW campus to the east side of the district in 1895. The name Brooklyn faded from use in favor of &quot;University District&quot;, which was adopted after a public contest in 1919.

== Location ==
Like all Seattle neighborhoods, the boundaries of the University District are informal; by common usage, the University District is bounded on the west by Interstate 5; on the east by University Village and Union Bay; on the south by Portage Bay and the Lake Washington Ship Canal; and on the north by NE Ravenna Boulevard.

== History ==

The area north of Portage Bay and west of Lake Washington has been inhabited since the end of the Vashon Glaciation approximately 16,000 years before present. The most recent Native American settlement in the area were the Duwamish villages of the Lushootseed-speaking Coast Salish peoples. The Duwamish had several prominent villages in and around the University District, including &quot;sluʔwiɫ&quot; and &quot;wəq̓iq̓əb&quot; (&quot;place of frogs&quot;) on Portage Bay. Other identified placenames include &quot;SWAH-tsoo-gweel&quot; (&quot;portage&quot;) and &quot;hehs-KWEE-kweel&quot; (&quot;skate&quot;) on Union Bay. The Duwamish peoples living in this area were known as &quot;xacuabš&quot; (&quot;people of the big lake&quot;).

The Duwamish also had trails through the areas that connected the village sites with waterways and fire-managed (burned) areas. These areas were cleared by fire for hunting purposes and to promote good crop growth. Blackberries, salmonberries, and root crops were plentiful, along with game including wolves, cougar, bear, deer and elk. One trail found by early non-native surveyors of the area extended from Portage Bay to Lake Washington and connected two native encampments, one on Portage Bay near the foot of Brooklyn Ave and one on Union Bay. No remnants of the Native American use of the area are extant in the University District today. The area now occupied by University Village was at that time a much larger Union Bay prior to the artificial lowering of Lake Washington.

The district was first surveyed in 1855; surveyors noted the presence of an existing trail used by indigenous communities as well as large Douglas fir and red cedar trees that impeded their path. The first white settlers in the area, Christian and Harriet Brownfield, established their homestead claim west of modern-day 15th Avenue Northeast in 1867. A portion of the surveyed land had already been reserved for public education use under territorial laws, either for a facility or to be sold to raise funds.

In 1890, the district began to enter a growth phase, and the portion due west of the present University of Washington campus was laid out as the Brooklyn Addition. This land was owned by real estate developer James A. Moore, his wife, and the Clise Investment Company and included much of the original Brownfield homestead. This central area was called Brooklyn, which gave the current Brooklyn Avenue in the neighborhood its name. Brooklyn was slower to develop than areas to the north and west such as Ravenna and Latona, due to those areas being more gently sloped and located closer to the central lakes (Union and Green Lakes). Materials for land/street development and improvements were hauled in by horse-drawn wagons. One year later (in 1891) much of the land north of the Ship Canal, including the future University District, was annexed by the City of Seattle.

In the early 1870s, coal was discovered east of Seattle in the Newcastle area near Bellevue. The coal was transported across Lake Washington to Union Bay, and initially was portaged across Montlake to eventually reach Elliott Bay. After around 1888, the Seattle Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built and ran along tracks which now form the Burke–Gilman Trail, a major bike commuting and recreation path across North Seattle.

Below, an 1894 report describes a train wreck just west of the current University District in the Latona neighborhood (now located west of I-5).

August 20, 1894. Wreck on [the] Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern just west of Latone [now Latona Avenue]. Freight train from Gilman [now Snoqualmie] hit a cow. [Trainload was a] [m]ixer freight train, 10 co[a]l cars, logs and box cars. Train had slowed down at Brooklyn [Avenue] for cows. Engineer saw cows on a bank beyond Latona looking (?) one another[!]. One cow was tossed over [the] bank and hit the track just as [the] engine came by. [The] [e]ngine was raised off the track[,] and when it came down [the] wheels went off the rails. Engineer reversed but [it] was too late. [The] [c]oal tender shot ahead[,] tearing part of [the engine] car [(cab)] off and decapitating [the] fireman and killing [the] brakeman. Engineer and coal passer [were] unhurt. Steam and dust enveloped the derailed cars. Engineer ran to Fremont to telegraph to stop [the] evening passenger train[;] also [illegible] Engineer claimed train going 20 miles per hr.

Electric streetcar tracks had been laid up Columbus Avenue (later known as 14th Avenue, and later still University Way) either in 1891 or 1892, and the neighborhood soon began to be called &quot;University Station&quot; after the heated waiting house at the corner of what is now NE 42nd Street. The streetcars eventually came to be operated by the Seattle Municipal Street Railway, which ceased operations in 1941. The University of Washington relocated to the east side of 15th Avenue in 1895, leaving its previous location in the Metropolitan Tract in downtown Seattle. Much of the neighborhood was still clear cut forest or stump farmland at the time.

The original name of &quot;Brooklyn&quot; had already faded in use after the university&#x27;s move in 1895, and several existing social organizations had renamed themselves to variants of &quot;University&quot; by 1903. The Latona post office moved to University Station in 1902 and was followed by the establishment of a public library three years later. The Lake Washington Ship Canal was constructed in the 1910s and included the Montlake Cut, which connects Portage Bay on Lake Union to Union Bay on Lake Washington. The University Bridge opened on July 1, 1919, and carried automobile and streetcar traffic over the Lake Washington Ship Canal to Eastlake. To prepare for the opening of the bridge, the University Commercial Club held a contest to rename 14th Avenue, with &quot;University Way&quot; chosen as the winner. The club also led a campaign to rename the neighborhood to the &quot;University District&quot;, which was officially adopted by the city council on May 23, 1919. An alternative proposal was to rename the area &quot;UniverCity&quot;, in recognition of the urban character of the district and the major commercial presence along its main streets.

The University District underwent a period of major growth in the 1920s as the university campus underwent renovations led by architect Carl F. Gould to replace the former venues of the 1909 Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition with modern buildings. The university adopted the Collegiate Gothic style for its new buildings and suggested that off-campus follow suit. The neighborhood had at least 20 new residential buildings constructed, along with two movie theaters, and major commercial buildings—among them various department stores and the University Book Store. The Greek Row emerged by the late 1930s as fraternity and sorority houses were constructed on 17th Avenue Northeast; by 1941, there were 41 fraternity and sorority houses on Greek Row. During the Great Depression, commercial development slowed but federal New Deal programs provided funding to replace the University District&#x27;s post office and improve local bridges.

UW&#x27;s enrollment grew after the end of World War II and into the 1950s, necessitating the expansion of the university campus beyond 15th Avenue Northeast. The South Campus expansion began in 1960 and was completed a decade later after of industrial land along the north side of Portage Bay had been redeveloped. The opening of Northgate Mall and University Village during the 1950s drew away major retailers from the University District, which would also see the construction of Interstate 5 and the Ship Canal Bridge in the next decade.

== Neighborhoods ==
The City of Seattle does not publish an official neighborhood map, and many neighborhood boundaries in Seattle are somewhat informal.

Neighborhoods within the district include:
* University Park (east from 15th to 25th Avenues NE, north from NE 50th Street to NE Ravenna Boulevard)
* Greek Row (NE 45th to NE 50th Streets, 15th to 22nd Avenues NE)
* University Heights (north of NE 45th Street and west of 15th Avenue NE)
* Brooklyn Addition (west of 15th Avenue NE and south of NE 45th Street)
* University Village (east of 25th Avenue NE)
* Main, West, and South campuses of the University of Washington, including the University of Washington Medical Center

== Infrastructure ==
The district&#x27;s skyline was formerly defined primarily by the UW campus, UW Tower, and the art deco style Graduate Hotel Seattle (originally the Meany Hotel). The 22-story UW Tower opened in 1975 as the headquarters of the Safeco Corporation and was acquired by the university in 2006.

The city council approved changes to the neighborhood&#x27;s zoning code in 2017 to prepare for the opening of the U District light rail station. The new zoning designation allows for buildings up of to between Interstate 5 and 15th Avenue Northeast, with the exception of The Ave. The University District subsequently entered a new period of growth with the construction of several high-rise residential towers that are primarily for student residents.

=== Public transit ===
The district is served by two Link light rail stations: University of Washington station near Husky Stadium opened in 2016 as part of the University Link Extension; and U District on Brooklyn Avenue near NE 45th Street which opened in October 2021 as part of the Northgate Link Extension. Light rail service connects the U District to Capitol Hill and Downtown Seattle to the south, and Roosevelt and Northgate to the north.

=== Streets ===
The neighborhood&#x27;s north-south arterials are (from west to east) Roosevelt Way NE (southbound only), 11th Avenue NE (northbound only), Brooklyn Avenue NE, University Way NE, and 15th Avenue NE. East-west arterials include NE Pacific Street, NE 45th Street, and part of NE 50th Streets. NE Campus Parkway is a minor east-west arterial, running only west of the campus.

== Culture ==
The annual U District Street Fair is held over a weekend in May, primarily on The Ave, and is among the longest-running street fairs in the United States. It was first held in 1970 with 300 vendors and organized by local merchant and peace activist Andy Shiga; it grew to 600 vendors and 100,000 visitors later in the decade. The fair was paused in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic and returned in 2022; it now attracts over 50,000 visitors and has 250 vendors. The neighborhood also has a weekly outdoor farmers&#x27; market that was founded in 1993 as one of the first in Seattle.

The Blue Moon Tavern has become an unofficial cultural landmark and was founded in 1934. The neighborhood was also home to historic coffeehouses that contributed to the city&#x27;s coffee culture, beginning with Cafe Encore in 1958 and followed by Café Allegro, the oldest still-operating coffeehouse, in 1975. The oldest newsstand in Seattle, Bulldog News, was established in 1983.

The neighborhood was home to several long-running movie theaters and performing arts venues. The Neptune Theatre opened as a movie theater in 1921 and was converted into a performing arts venue in 2011 under the ownership of Seattle Theatre Group. The final movie theater in the neighborhood closed in February 2025. The independent Grand Illusion Cinema was founded in a renovated dental&#x27;s office in 1970 by Randy Finley and was run by the nonprofit Northwest Film Forum. Finley also founded the Seven Gables Theatre at a converted American Legion building in 1976. It was an arthouse theater that operated until 2017; the building was destroyed by a fire in December 2020. The locally-owned Scarecrow Video, the largest video rental store on the West Coast, was founded in 1988 and is the last of its kind in the city. It has 140,000 titles and is operated by a nonprofit organization.

<doc id="295777" wikidata="Q3339834" url="?curid=295777" title="Nickerson Field">
<text>Nickerson Field is an outdoor athletic stadium in the Northeastern United States, on the campus of Boston University (BU) in Boston, Massachusetts. The stadium is owned by BU, and is the home field for some Boston University Terriers athletics programs, including soccer and lacrosse. It was also the home of the Boston University Terriers football team until the program was discontinued following the 1997 season.

The stadium is located on the site of Braves Field, the former home ballpark of the Boston Braves, a major league baseball team in the National League; the franchise relocated to Milwaukee in March 1953, and relocated again in 1966, becoming the Atlanta Braves. Parts of Braves Field, such as the entry gate and right field pavilion, remain as portions of the current stadium. The old Braves Field ticket office at Harry Agganis Way also remains, now used by the Boston University Police Department as headquarters complete with a cellblock. The stadium has been the home of BU teams longer (50-plus years) than it was the home of the Braves (parts of 38 seasons).

The field is named for William Emery Nickerson (1853–1930), a partner of King C. Gillette during the early years of the Gillette Safety Razor Company.

==History==

The university&#x27;s previous athletic field was in the town of Weston. That field had been named for Nickerson, a member of the BU board of trustees who had donated funds for the facilities in Weston in 1926. Nickerson &quot;was an MIT graduate who was the principal inventor of the machinery used to manufacture the first Gillette safety razor.&quot; The first Nickerson Field was dedicated on October 6, 1928, with a game against the New Hampshire Wildcats.

BU purchased the former home of the Boston Braves on July 30, 1953, and in April 1954 renamed it &quot;Boston University Field&quot;. In 1955, the left field pavilion and the &quot;Jury Box&quot; were demolished and in November, 1959, the grandstand was taken down to make room for three high rise dormitories that were completed in 1964. The existing right field pavilion was squared off on the west side and filled in on the east side where a section had been removed to accommodate the Braves Field right field foul pole and bullpens. The three dormitories overlooking the field coincidentally suggest the outline of the original main grandstand section.

In February 1956, BU was awarded $391,000 for the Weston field, which had been taken by eminent domain for construction of Massachusetts Route 128. BU used the proceeds, in part, to renovate the former baseball park, and on September 28, 1963, renamed it &quot;Nickerson Field&quot;, inheriting the name of the prior field in Weston.

In 1968, the field underwent a renovation. The four Braves Field light towers were dismantled. That year, BU became the second college in the United States to install AstroTurf. The following year, not only did the BU football team practice on that field, so did the Boston College Eagles football team and the Boston Patriots. Both used the field to prepare for away games they would play on AstroTurf fields.

During the 1983 season, Nickerson Field was the home field of the Boston Breakers of the United States Football League. From the mid-1980s to 1995, the stadium hosted the New England Scholastic Band Association&#x27;s marching band field show championships. In 1989, to accommodate commencement speakers U.S. President George H. W. Bush and French President François Mitterrand, a large platform was constructed to Secret Service specifications on one side of the field. In 2001, the antiquated turf was replaced with a newer, more player-friendly artificial surface (FieldTurf) as part of a deal with the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association to host the Boston Breakers games. With a professional soccer team playing at Nickerson the football lines, which had remained on the field even though BU no longer had a football program, were not repainted. The platform built for Bush and Mitterrand was removed during the summer of 2008, when the field was expanded and resurfaced.

In the summer of 2015, the field received a new artificial turf, GreenFields MX Trimension; the new surface was installed over a period of five weeks, covering .

===Use by professional sports===
Since its reconfiguration in the 1950s, multiple professional sports franchises have used the stadium:

<doc id="295780" wikidata="Q7774442" url="?curid=295780" title="The Whispering Vault">
<text>The Whispering Vault is a horror-themed role-playing game originally published in 1993. Players take on the role of &quot;Stalkers&quot;, persons who have risen above their own mortality to act as servants of the guardians of Reality, tracking down and apprehending rogue gods who have invaded Reality and returning them to the realm of the Unseen where they are cast into The Whispering Vault.

==History==
In 1993, at Gen Con 26, Mike Nystul sold a 88-page spiral-bound, pre-publication version (referred to as the &quot;black book&quot;) of his self-published horror RPG called &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot;. Buoyed by positive comments, Nystul formed Pariah Press the following year to publish an expanded and professionally printed edition. 

Shannon Applecline, in the book &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, highlighted the horror-themed art and evocative background material. Applecline also mentioned the &quot;brutal and quick&quot; combat system and the simple task resolution system that reduced dice-rolling to a minimum and brought the adventure storyline to the fore. 

The following year, Nystul published two supplements: the &quot;Dangerous Prey&quot; sourcebook (1995) and a three-panel gamemaster&#x27;s screen (1995). 

In 1996, Chris Pramas acquired rights to &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; from Mike Nystul and founded the company Ronin Publishing with his brother, Jason Pramas, along with their mutual friend, Neal Darcy. The first publication from Green Ronin was &quot;The Book of Hunts&quot; (1997), a book containing a series of adventures; Ronin Publishing created a second supplement called &quot;Mortal Magic&quot;, but it was left unpublished when Ronin folded in 1998. 

Pharos Press acquired the rights for &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; in 2000, but did not publish anything. In 2003, Ronin Arts acquired the rights, and released &quot;Mortal Magic&quot;, the unpublished work by Ronin Publishing; Ronin Arts then quickly published seven more PDFs that year, before discontinuing the line.

==Description==
Characters within &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; used to be human, but after a life dedicated to protecting humanity against supernatural beings they have been recruited into the ranks of the Stalkers, the main heroes of the game. Now armed with supernatural powers and able to summon ghostly servitors, their mission is to hunt down the Unbidden: rebellious gods who have escaped into the Realm of Flesh — what humanity calls &quot;Reality&quot;.

The Stalkers have other enemies:
*The Shadows are creatures who were denied existence and live in the Rift between the Realms of Flesh and Essence. Sometimes they manage to awaken into the Dream by themselves, sometimes the Unbidden bind them as Minions.
*Mortals may also be dangerous: the use of Magic may endanger the Dream, too.

The Hunts of the Stalkers can happen in any era, and Stalkers may come from any period of History as time flows differently in the Realm of Essence and the Realm of Flesh.

==Gameplay==
===Character creation===
The player divides 22 points among four attributes. The number of points assigned to each attribute determines how many six-sided dice the player will roll for task and combat resolution.

===Combat and task resolution===
For both combat and task resolution, players try to achieve success by rolling a number of dice equal to their relevant skill level. As in Yahtzee, players try to roll matched sets or special combinations. Players can spend a point of kharma to reroll any number of the dice in search of better dice combinations. In combat, resulting damage is divided by the target&#x27;s Fortitude. When fighting supernatural creatures, mortals must ignore any sixes that are rolled, making combat against these creatures much more difficult.

==Reception==
Sam Chupp reviewed &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #40 (1994), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;&quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; will appeal to you if you like horror- or superhero-style games, but I think you&#x27;ll enjoy the elegance, uniqueness and atmosphere of the game even if you don&#x27;t play those games. I heartily recommend &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot;, prototype that it is.&quot;

William Spencer-Hale reviewed &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #44 (June, 1994), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;To sum it all up, &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; is a game that no fan of horror roleplaying should ignore.&quot;

In the August 1994 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #208), Lester Smith reviewed the &quot;pre-release&quot; version of the game that had been sold at Gen Con, and admired the &quot;powerful new mythology&quot; and &quot;strong atmosphere of brooding horror&quot; that Mike Nystul was able to evoke in such a slim volume. Smith also liked the new mechanics for combat and task resolution, which he found &quot;works surprisingly well&quot;. However, he did find several important elements missing, including &quot;the keys of humanity&quot;, which apparently were supposed to explain the motivation for the player&#x27;s characters. (Allen noted that this missing material would be included in the Pariah Press version that was being prepared for publication at the time the review was printed.) Allen concluded by giving &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; a rating of 4 out of 6, saying &quot;I definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes heroic horror. It is one of the most inventive treatments of the subject I have yet encountered.&quot;

Six months later, in the May 1995 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #217), Lester Smith again reviewed the game, this time looking at the official first edition of the game, and called the book&#x27;s presentation &quot;excellent, nearly flawless.&quot; He found designer Mike Nystul&#x27;s &quot;unique vision both shockingly strange and yet universal in scope.&quot; Smith concluded by giving the game a perfect rating of 6 out of 6, saying, &quot;This product is pure, distilled horror, with some of the most concise yet effective mechanics ever published; its relative slimness simply means that you’ll digest the game more quickly initially, and reference it more easily during play.&quot;

In the following edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #218 – June 1995), Rick Swan called &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; &quot;Only one of the smartest, spookiest horror RPGs that ever clawed its way from a crypt.&quot;
In the November 1994 edition of &quot;Pyramid&quot; (Issue #10), William Spencer-Hale recommended the game, saying, &quot;All in all, &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; is a game worthy of the attention of any fan of horror roleplaying. This game is a welcome addition to any library and, out of all the roleplaying materials that I own, this is one that I will actually enjoy playing.&quot;

<text>Errenteria (, ) is a town located in the province of Gipuzkoa in the Basque Autonomous Community, in the north of Spain, near the French border. The river Oiartzun cuts its way through the town, one that has undergone severe pollution up to recent times on its lower stage.

== History ==
The town was founded in 1320, during the reign of Alfonso XI of Castile, with the name of &quot;Villanueva de Oiarso&quot; or &quot;Oyarço&quot;. It soon started to be known as &quot;La Rentería&quot; because it hosted the office where iron export taxes were collected (taxes were called &quot;rentas reales&quot; i.e. royal rents in medieval Castile). 

The Basque form &quot;Errenteria&quot; (also &quot;Errenteri&quot; or &quot;Errenderi&quot;) started to appear towards the end of the 16th century. In 1998, the town hall decided to use &quot;Errenteria&quot; as the only official name. 

In September 1982, Rentería was the scene of the bloodiest ETA attack of that year.

<text>Stark Young (October 11, 1881 – January 6, 1963) was an American teacher, playwright, novelist, painter, literary critic, translator, and essayist.

==Early life==
Young was born on October 11, 1881, in Como, Mississippi. His father, Alfred Alexander Young, was a physician. His mother, Mary Clark Starks, was a direct descendant of the McGehees, an old planter family; she died when he was nine years old. Shortly after her death, Young was sent to live at the McGehee Plantation in Senatobia, Mississippi.

Young entered the University of Mississippi at the age of 15 and graduated from that institution in 1901. He completed his Master&#x27;s Degree at Columbia University in New York in 1902.

==Career==
Young taught at the University of Mississippi in 1905-1907, and then moved to the University of Texas at Austin. There he established the &quot;Texas Review&quot; and became involved with theater. In 1915 he moved to Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he taught English until 1921.

He resigned to pursue other interests and moved to New York City. In New York, he was appointed as an editor of &quot;Theatre Arts Magazine&quot; and as drama critic for &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Young worked at &quot;The New Republic&quot; until his retirement in 1947. During this period he was also professionally involved with the theater in New York and wrote several plays. Young&#x27;s plays include: &quot;Guenevere&quot;, &quot;Addio, Madretta&quot;, &quot;At The Shrine&quot;, &quot;The Star In The Trees&quot;, &quot;Twilight Saint&quot;, &quot;The Dead Poet&quot;, &quot;The Seven Kings and the Wind&quot;, and &quot;The Queen of Sheba&quot;, to name a few.

In 1926 Stark Young wrote his first novel &quot;Heaven Trees&quot;. In 1930, Young contributed to the agrarian manifesto, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand.&quot; He was one of 12 Southern writers, a group including Allen Tate, known as the Southern Agrarians. Young drew on the traditions of his Southern upbringing for inspiration. He wrote essays, journalistic articles, and collections of stories that drew on these sources. He also published four novels dealing with Southern themes.

&quot;So Red the Rose&quot; (1934), perhaps Young&#x27;s finest novel, had a brief period of popularity as the archetype of the Southern Civil War novel and dealt with the aftermath of the war. In 1935, his novel was adapted as a film of the same name directed by King Vidor and starring Margaret Sullavan. Described by its author as a novel of the affections, the book is still in print. The phenomenal successes of Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (1936) and its film adaptation of 1939 pushed Young&#x27;s book into the background.

Young translated a number of plays by Anton Chekhov, including &quot;The Sea Gull&quot;, &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;, and &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, all of which were published in 1956 by The Modern Library as &quot;Best Plays by Chekhov&quot;.

In the 1940s Young, a self-taught artist, began painting. He had two one-man exhibitions in New York. His paintings were shown in four important venues, including the Art Institute of Chicago, which purchased one of his works for its permanent collection.

In 1951 Young published his memoir, &quot;The Pavilion&quot;, dedicated to his friend Allen Tate.

Young was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame, as well as the New York University Hall of Fame. He was the recipient of Creative Arts Medallion from Brandeis University and the Southeastern Theatre Conference&#x27;s Distinguished Career Award. Additionally, he received the Order of the Crown of Italy for a series of lectures on American theater. He gave them in Italian as a Westinghouse Lecturer in Italy. He served on the board of New York University and was a theater critic for the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

==Death==
Young suffered a stroke in May 1959 and died four years later. He was buried in Friendship Cemetery in Como, Mississippi.

<doc id="295796" wikidata="Q57369" url="?curid=295796" title="Nicolaus Bruhns">
<text>Nicolaus Bruhns (also &quot;Nikolaus&quot;, &quot;Nicholas&quot;; late 1665 – in Husum) was a Danish-German organist, violinist, and composer. He was one of the most prominent organists and composers of his generation.

==Biography==
Bruhns was born in Schwabstedt (Danish: &quot;Svavsted&quot;), a small settlement near Husum. He came from a family of musicians and composers. His grandfather, Paul Jakob Bruhns (died 1655), worked as lutenist in Lübeck. His three sons all chose musical careers; Bruhns&#x27; father, also named Paul (1640–c. 1689), became organist at Schwabstedt, possibly after studying with Franz Tunder. Nicolaus was apparently a child prodigy: according to Ernst Ludwig Gerber, he could play the organ and compose competent works for keyboard and voice already at an early age. He probably received his first music lessons from his father.
At age sixteen, Bruhns, together with his younger brother Georg (1666-1742), was sent to Lübeck to live with their uncle Peter, who would teach Bruhns the violin and the viola da gamba. The two brothers also studied the organ and composition; Georg under Bernhard Olffen, organist of St. Aegidien, and Nicolaus under Dieterich Buxtehude. The latter, one of the best composers of his time, was so impressed with Bruhns&#x27; talents and progress that he considered him his best pupil and eventually recommended him for Copenhagen. There Bruhns worked as organist and violinist. On 29 March 1689 he competed for the position of organist of the Stadtkirche in Husum and was unanimously accepted. In a few months he was offered a position at Kiel, but declined when the authorities at Husum increased his salary. Bruhns remained in Husum until his untimely death in 1697, at the age of 31. His only son, Johan Paul, chose a career in theology. Bruhns was succeeded in Husum by his brother Georg.
==Works==
Bruhns&#x27; surviving oeuvre is unfortunately small: only 12 vocal and 5 organ pieces are extant. The vocal works include four sacred concertos that established a new level of virtuosity in the genre, and three sacred madrigal cantatas that represent a direct link with the next century and the work of Johann Sebastian Bach. Although the instrumental writing in most of these works suggests that Bruhns could only rely on musicians of average skill, there are movements, such as the opening sonatina of the solo cantata &quot;Mein Herz ist bereit&quot;, that feature highly developed, virtuosic textures. Bruhns almost certainly wrote chamber music, which may have been of the same high quality, but none of these works survive.

The organ works comprise four praeludia and a chorale fantasia on the hymn &quot;Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland&quot;. The most significant of these pieces is the larger of the two E minor praeludia, which is usually cited as one of the greatest works of the North German organ tradition. Although Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach claimed that his father admired and studied Bruhns&#x27; work, no direct influence has been traced by scholars.

<text>Jeb Stuart Magruder (November 5, 1934May 11, 2014) was an American businessman and high-level political operative in the Republican Party who served time in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal. 

He served President Richard Nixon in various capacities, including acting as special assistant to the President for domestic policy development, and later as deputy director of the president&#x27;s 1972 re-election campaign, Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP). In August 1973, Magruder pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to wiretap, obstruct justice and defraud the United States. He served seven months in federal prison.

Magruder later attended Princeton Theological Seminary and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. He spoke publicly about ethics and his role in the Watergate scandal. In the 1990s and early 2000s, he gave interviews in which he changed his accounts of actions by various participants in the Watergate coverup, including claiming that Nixon ordered the break-ins.

==Early life==
Jeb Stuart Magruder was born and grew up on Staten Island, New York. His father, a Civil War buff, named him for Confederate general J.E.B. Stuart. His great-grandfather smuggled shoes for the Civil War Confederate States of America. His grandfather was convicted of bank fraud related to the construction of WWI cargo ships. He was an honor student at Curtis High School. Magruder was an excellent junior tennis player and swimmer, among the best in the greater New York area.

After two years at Williams College, he served in the U.S. Army, but was kicked out of Officer Candidate School of the United States Army, only weeks before graduation, for going AWOL by not going to class so as to take the daughter of a colonel out in a new Chevrolet.
 He was then stationed in South Korea. He later earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1958 from Williams College, where he competed on the varsity swimming team and set several regional records.

Magruder started at IBM after college, but dropped out of its training program after only a few days. He went to California and married a Berkeley student, Gail Barnes Nicholas, then took a job with the Crown Zellerbach, selling paper goods in Kansas City. Later, he started his own consumer products company. Later, he earned a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Chicago.

==Marriage and family==
He married Gail Barnes Nicholas on October 17, 1959, in Brentwood, California. The couple had four children.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1973/01/20/magruder&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They were divorced in 1984.

Magruder married Patricia Newton on February 28, 1987, in Columbus, Ohio. They were divorced in May 2003.

==Business career and politics==
In the late 1950s, Magruder moved to Kansas City with Jewel Tea, in a transfer for work. He became involved there as a campaign manager for the Republican Party during the 1960 election campaign, working as chairman of an urban ward.

Magruder moved to Chicago for his MBA studies. Afterward he shifted from IBM to the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. 

In Chicago, he again, was involved with the Republican Party. Magruder was a ward chairman, for Donald Rumsfeld″s 1962 Illinois&#x27;s 13th congressional district United States House of Representatives Republican primary campaign. Rumsfeld won the primary and the seat in Congress.

In 1962 Magruder moved from Booz Allen Hamilton to Jewel, a regional grocery firm. During his nearly four years with them, he was promoted to merchandise manager.

Magruder became involved with the Illinois organization of the Barry Goldwater presidential campaign in late 1963, but became disillusioned with Goldwater&#x27;s political views. He worked briefly as campaign manager for Richard Ogilvie&#x27;s 1966 campaign for president of the Cook County Board of Supervisors. The political workload, combined with work pressures, caused Magruder to end employment with Jewel.

In mid-1966, he returned to California, to begin a job with the Broadway Stores. In mid-1967, he served as Southern California coordinator for the Richard Nixon presidential campaign. He left early in 1968 due to internal organizational problems.

Magruder entered partnership during early 1969 with two other entrepreneurs to start two new businesses, and became president and chief executive officer of these firms.

==Joins White House staff==
Magruder was appointed to the White House staff in 1969, as special assistant to the president, and moved with his family to Washington, D.C. He worked for Nixon operatives H.R. Haldeman and Herbert G. Klein, communications director for the Executive Branch. Magruder&#x27;s formal title was deputy director of White House Communications. 
===Committee to Re-elect the President===

Magruder served in the White House until the spring of 1971, when he left to manage the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP, also known as CREEP), first as director. By early 1972 in the election year, Attorney General John N. Mitchell took over as director of CREEP and Magruder acted as his deputy. As Mitchell became preoccupied with a scandal involving the ITT Corporation and by his efforts to restrain his outspoken wife Martha, Magruder took on more of the management of the CREEP.

The 1972 campaign to re-elect the President won 49 of 50 states. Nixon lost only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia to Democrat George McGovern. The final tally of Nixon&#x27;s victory was 520 to 17 electoral votes, the second largest Electoral College (United States) margin in history up until then, after Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s 1936 victory over Alf Landon, (523 to 8).

===Manages 1973 Inaugural===
Magruder worked as inaugural director from October 1972 to arrange Nixon&#x27;s United States presidential inauguration ceremony and celebration in January 1973. In March 1973, he began a job as director of policy planning with the United States Department of Commerce. He resigned soon afterward, as the Watergate scandal began to heat up and become scrutinized again by media following James McCord&#x27;s disclosures of perjury during the original Watergate trial of the five burglars; the former Watergate burglar wrote about this to the &quot;Washington Star.&quot; 

==Watergate scandal==
Magruder, in his role with CRP, was involved with the Watergate matters from an early stage, including its planning, execution, and cover-up.

===Liddy plan===
Magruder met with White House Counsel John Dean and John Mitchell on January 27 and February 4, 1972, to review preliminary plans by G. Gordon Liddy (Counsel to CRP) for intelligence gathering ideas for the 1972 campaign. The Watergate burglaries would evolve from those meetings. From the day they met in December 1971, Magruder and Liddy (who had been hired by Mitchell and Dean) had a conflicted personal relationship.

===Cooperates with prosecutors===
During April 1973, Magruder began cooperating with federal prosecutors. In exchange, Magruder was allowed to plead guilty in August 1973 to a one-count indictment of conspiracy to obstruct justice, to defraud the United States, and to illegally eavesdrop on the Democratic Party&#x27;s national headquarters at the Watergate Hotel and Office Building. During this time, Magruder also engaged in a speaking tour on college campuses and in other public spaces, inspiring some critics to suggest he had profited from the scandal and his decision to turn state&#x27;s evidence. On May 21, 1974, Magruder was sentenced by Judge John Sirica to ten months to four years for his role in the failed burglary of Watergate and the following cover-up. After his sentencing, Magruder said, &quot;I am confident that this country will survive its Watergates and its Jeb Magruders.&quot; In the end, he served three months of his sentence at a Federal minimum security prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, and was moved for the remaining four months (before Sirica&#x27;s pardon) to a &quot;safe house prison&quot; at the Fort Holabird Base in Baltimore Harbor, along with Chuck Colson, John Dean and Herb Kalmbach, due to threats on the four by inmates at Allenwood.

Magruder originally testified that he knew nothing to indicate that President Nixon had any prior knowledge of the Watergate burglary.

In his book, &quot;An American Life: One Man&#x27;s Road to Watergate&quot; (1974), he wrote, 
I know nothing to indicate that Nixon was aware in advance of the plan to break into the Democratic headquarters. It is possible that Mitchell or Haldeman told him in advance, but I think it&#x27;s likelier that they would not have mentioned it unless the operation had produced some results of interest to him. This book was published before Magruder&#x27;s sentencing on May 21, and before Nixon resigned as the president.

Magruder had testified that he thought that he was helping establish a legal intelligence-gathering operation. In his book Magruder wrote about former attorney general John Mitchell and Fred LaRue meeting in late March 1972 in Key Biscayne, Florida. He wrote that Mitchell approved the plan to eavesdrop on the Watergate complex soon after this meeting.

==After Watergate==
After his prison term, Magruder published a Christian-oriented memoir, &quot;From Power to Peace&quot; in 1976. He earned a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) degree from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1981 and became ordained as a Presbyterian minister. He served as associate minister at the First Presbyterian Church in Burlingame, California and First Community Church of Columbus, Ohio. (While there, Magruder chaired that city&#x27;s Commission on Ethics and Values for a time.) In May 1983, President Ronald Reagan denied a request from Magruder for a presidential pardon.

In 1990 Magruder was called as senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky. In 1995, Kentucky Governor Brereton Jones reinstated Magruder&#x27;s right to vote, and campaign for public office in the state.

===Continued controversy===
In 1990 Magruder consented to interviews with authors Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin while the two were conducting research for their 1991 book &quot;Silent Coup: The Removal of a President&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press). Magruder admitted that he had lied to prosecutors, to the Senate&#x27;s Watergate Committee, and in his 1974 book &quot;An American Life: One Man&#x27;s Road to Watergate&quot;, concerning aspects of the early cover-up.

To Colodny and Gettlin, he said that he had called John Dean several hours after the (second) Watergate break-in was discovered, and that Dean set in motion several cover-up strategies. This version of events tallied closely with that of Liddy, as set out in his 1980 book &quot;Will&quot;. Books published earlier by others, however, such as Magruder&#x27;s in 1974 and Dean&#x27;s &quot;Blind Ambition&quot; (1976), had become the accepted &#x27;truth&#x27; of the cover-up. These versions had very profound and damaging effects on the reputations of senior figures such as Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Mitchell.

To Colodny and Gettlin, Magruder admitted specifically instructing Liddy on the second Watergate break-in, something which he had earlier denied. At the time these interviews were conducted, Magruder was a Presbyterian minister in Columbus, Ohio.

In 2003 Magruder was interviewed again, by PBS researchers and the Associated Press. According to his account in a PBS documentary, &quot;Watergate Plus 30: Shadow of History&quot;, and in an interview with the Associated Press, he asserted that Nixon knew about the Watergate burglary early in the process, and well before the scandal broke. During the 2003 interviews, Magruder said that he had attended a meeting with Mitchell on March 30, 1972, at which he heard Nixon tell Mitchell by telephone to begin the Watergate plan. This account, however, has been contested by Fred LaRue. LaRue, who was the only other person present at the meeting in which the alleged telephone call from Nixon to Mitchell occurred, has said that no telephone call from Nixon to Mitchell took place during this meeting. Magruder is the only direct participant of the scandal to claim that Nixon had specific prior knowledge of the Watergate burglary, and that Nixon directed Mitchell to proceed with the burglary. These statements contradict Magruder&#x27;s earlier accounts that the cover-up had reached no higher in the Administration than Mitchell.

In his 1974 book, Magruder had said that the only telephone call from the White House during this meeting came from H.R. Haldeman&#x27;s aide, Gordon C. Strachan. Sixteen years later, in the August 7, 1990 interview with Colodny and Gettlin, Magruder changed his account, claiming that the telephone call from the White House came from Haldeman himself. In 2003, Magruder changed his account again, saying that President Nixon had telephoned Mitchell at the Key Biscayne meeting.

==Later years==
Magruder retired first to Colorado Springs and later to the Short North area of Columbus, Ohio. On July 23, 2007, Magruder was hospitalized after crashing his car into a motorcycle and a truck on State Route 315 in Columbus. It was reported that Magruder had suffered a stroke while driving. He was charged with failure to maintain an assured clear distance and failure to stop after an accident or collision. Magruder pleaded guilty in January 2008 to a charge of reckless operation stemming from the crashes with two vehicles in July. His license was suspended and he was fined $300.

===Death===
Magruder moved to be near family in Danbury, Connecticut in 2012, and died at age 79 on May 11, 2014, due to complications from a stroke.

* 1960: J. Bjerknes and Erik Palmén for their pioneering and distinguished research contributions in atmospheric dynamics and synoptic aerology, which have given a unified picture of the general circulation of the atmosphere.
* 1961: Victor P. Starr for his more than a decade of outstanding fundamental research leading to a better understanding of the general circulation of the atmosphere.
* 1962: Bernhard Haurwitz for the substantial advances due to his research in dynamic meteorology over a wide range of subjects, including among many the long waves in the westerlies, the circulation of the high atmosphere, local and diurnal effects, and hurricanes.
* 1963: Harry Wexler (posthumously) for his contributions to knowledge of the atmosphere heat balance and dynamic anticyclogenesis, for his interdisciplinary studies in meteorology, oceanography, and glaciology, and for his outstanding leadership in international programs in the atmospheric sciences.
* 1964: Jule G. Charney for his long and distinguished record of outstanding contributions to theoretical meteorology and related atmospheric sciences. Apart from acting as a strong scientific stimulus to the development of dynamical weather prediction, Professor Charney&#x27;s research has led the way to a more fundamental understanding of the atmosphere&#x27;s general circulation, hydrodynamical instability, the structure of hurricanes, the dynamics of ocean currents, the propagation of wave energy, and many other aspects of geophysical fluid mechanics. In its scientific depth and breadth, Professor Charney&#x27;s work has contributed significantly to the study of meteorology as an exact science.
* 1965: Arnt Eliassen for his many important contributions to dynamical meteorology, through which he has brought a new elegance and clarity into the subject. Noteworthy among these are his research on free and thermally driven circulations, on numerical weather prediction, on frontogenesis, and on shear and gravitational–acoustic wave propagation in stratified media.

<doc id="295828" wikidata="Q918887" url="?curid=295828" title="Twelve-inch single">
<text>The twelve-inch single (often written as 12-inch or 12) is a type of vinyl (polyvinyl chloride or PVC) gramophone record that has wider groove spacing and shorter playing time with a &quot;single&quot; or a few related sound tracks on each surface, compared to LPs (long play) which have several songs on each side. It is named for its diameter that was intended for LPs. This technical adaptation allows for louder levels to be cut on the disc by the mastering engineer, which in turn gives a wider dynamic range, and thus better sound quality. This record type, which is claimed to have been accidentally discovered by Tom Moulton, is commonly used in disco and dance music genres, where DJs use them to play in clubs. They are played at either or 45 . The conventional 7-inch single usually holds three or four minutes of music at full volume. The 12-inch LP sacrifices volume for extended playing time.

==Technical features==
Twelve-inch singles typically have much shorter playing time than full-length LPs, and thus require fewer grooves per inch. This extra space permits a broader dynamic range or louder recording level as the grooves&#x27; excursions (i.e., the width of the groove waves and distance traveled from side to side by the turntable stylus) can be much greater in amplitude, especially in the bass frequencies important for dance music. Many record companies in the 1970s began producing 12-inch (30 cm) singles at  rpm, although 45 rpm gives better treble response.

==History==
=== Pre-vinyl period ===

Gramophone records had been introduced in the latter portion of the 19th century, with several pioneers involved in sound reproduction development such as Thomas Edison and Emilie Berliner. Berliner along with Eldridge R. Johnson merged their efforts within the industry to form the Victor Talking Machine Company in New Jersey, USA and perfected the use of 5 and 7-inch rotating shellac discs for sound replay from 1889, with 10-inch records appearing in 1901. In 1903 12-inch discs were introduced by Victor, on their Deluxe label, these able to play for up to four minutes, so increasing what were non-achievable times of the length of a song or speech on the earlier formats. These first twelve-inch releases were all by the Victor Grand Concert Band, led by Frederick W. Hager. During the 1910s discs became the standard sound reproduction format, although the speeds used could vary between manufacturers until 78 rpm became the norm from around 1925. An album would consist of several of these single discs packaged together. These brittle shellac discs remained a popular medium through the first attempt to introduce vinyl records in 1931, the subsequent move towards microgroove formats from 1948, and would survive until the early 1960s.

=== Vinyl and microgroove formats ===

In August 1931, RCA Victor launched the first commercially available vinyl long-playing record, marketed under their Program Transcription series. These revolutionary discs were designed for playback at 331⁄3 rpm (the speed first used on 16‑inch Vitaphone soundtrack discs from 1926) and pressed on ten and twelve-inch diameter flexible Victrolac discs, using a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compound called vinylite which was licensed from Union Carbide. It was marketed initially as being more robust than shellac, with a duration of up to twenty minutes playing time per side. The first twelve-inch LP (containing only one track per side), was Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 5 In C Minor&quot; by the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. RCA&#x27;s early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable, reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the Great Depression. Because of financial hardships that plagued the recording industry during that period (and RCA&#x27;s own parched revenues), Victor&#x27;s long-playing records were discontinued for public sale by early 1933.

However, vinyl continued to be used, notably with broadcasters, on larger 16‑inch radio transcription discs, and later with the V-Disc program that sent records overseas to US troops during World War II to help boost morale. Vinyl as a material for records sold to the public was reintroduced after World War II, first for 78s in 1945 (the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra and Chorus&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot; a 12‑inch 5-record set from Asch Recordings catalog number M-800), with 12‑inch 331⁄3 rpm LPs (with a narrower &quot;microgroove&quot;) and 7‑inch 45 rpm singles being marketed by Columbia Records and RCA Victor respectively in 1948 and 1949. Intriguingly, although there is a scientific basis behind 45 rpm being an ideal speed for sound quality which was touted by RCA, conveniently the 45 rpm number can also be derived by subtracting 33 from 78.

Longer tracks could be accommodated on each side of the 12‑inch disc, or shorter but more numerous tracks per side. Indeed, the first 12‑inch vinyl album in 1948, &quot;Mendelssohn&#x27;s Concerto in E Minor&quot;, featured only three tracks (the 11-minute first movement on side one, and the second and third movements on side two, together adding another 14 minutes) and was extended play (EP) in appearance, rather than a typical album with multiple tracks each being on average 2–4 minutes such as the first 10‑inch vinyl album, a reissue of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Voice of Frank Sinatra&quot;. While one to two short playing songs being sold to the public were more suited for the seven‑inch 45 rpm record, the LP could be anything from 1 track per side, and if in that simplistic configuration it technically could be classed as a twelve‑inch single. Over the ensuing years some works, particularly in the classical and jazz genres, and the relatively few tracks on an occasional album could blur the boundaries of what would become considered a twelve‑inch single, an EP and an album, with the price, catalogue number, any stylistic aims of the performing artist, marketing by the record label, as well as record industry sales charts rules regulating the differences between formats.

===Jamaican roots===

The gramophone records cut especially for dance-floor DJs came into existence with the advent of recorded Jamaican mento music in the 1950s. By at least 1956 it was already standard practice by Jamaican sound systems owners to give their &quot;selecter&quot; DJs acetate or flexi disc dubs of exclusive mento and Jamaican rhythm and blues recordings before they were issued commercially.

=== Pre-disco ===
In March 1970, Cycle/Ampex Records test-marketed a twelve-inch single by jazz-pop guitarist Buddy Fite, featuring &quot;Glad Rag Doll&quot; backed with &quot;For Once in My Life&quot;, both from his self-titled debut album issued in 1969. Subtitled &#x27;The world&#x27;s first 12-inch single!&#x27;, the experiment aimed to energize the struggling singles market, offering a new option for consumers who had stopped buying traditional singles. The record was pressed at 33 rpm, with identical run times to the seven-inch 45 rpm pressing of the single and album, but with a large runoff area. Several hundred copies were made available for sale for 98 cents each at two Tower Records stores in California.

Shelter Records evidently liked the format enough to use it a few times to promote artists in the US and Australia - they serviced a test pressing of Leon Russell&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s A Hard Rain&#x27;s Gonna Fall&quot; backed with &quot;Me And Baby Jane&quot; to radio stations in July 1971, the first track from his &quot;Leon Russell and the Shelter People&quot; album, with the flip side from his &quot;Carney&quot; album. Shelter later issued another promotional single &quot;Lowdown in Lodi&quot;/&quot;Me and My Guitar&quot; by Freddie King in 1972 with the tracks taken from his &quot;Texas Cannonball&quot; LP.

Another early twelve-inch single was released in 1973 by soul/R&amp;B musician/songwriter/producer Jerry Williams, Jr. a.k.a. Swamp Dogg. Twelve-inch promotional copies of &quot;Straight From My Heart&quot; were released on his own Swamp Dogg Presents label (Swamp Dogg Presents #501/SDP-SD01, 33+1⁄3 r.p.m.), with distribution by Jamie/Guyden Distribution Corporation. It was manufactured by Jamie Record Co. of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The B-side of the record is blank.

=== Disco era ===
The disco twelve-inch record came into being from several key developments:

* using the instrumental or backing track with the vocal version to create an extended version, and later on combining outtakes, adlibs and other unused material;
* creating a segued mix of different tracks, the length of which was less suited to a 7-inch record;
* using physically larger and audibly &quot;hotter&quot; records;
* progressively increasing the awareness and availability of the format through trade publications, record shops and DJ record pools;

Notably, Tom Moulton, and Scepter Records along with its production chief Mel Cheren (later co-founder of dance label West End Records) were involved in several of these pioneering steps due to their artists and heavy bass-range and strong uptempo song material, forward-thinking company executives and innovative remixing.

==== First instrumental side ====
This was released by Scepter to the flip side of the Ultra High Frequency &quot;We&#x27;re on the Right Track&quot; seven-inch single in 1973. This issuing of the backing track enabled DJ&#x27;s to use two turntables and mix between the vocal and instrumental versions of popular dance records, segueing them so that dancing patrons could enjoy the overall song for longer. A key reason of the time was that few varispeed turntables existed, so DJ&#x27;s would only blend into a track with the same drum tempo or BPM, which the instrumental naturally was. This was in comparison to the then occasionally found &#x27;Part 2&#x27; B-side of a record, while similar, tended to be the latter half of a lengthy album track, split for seven-inch release, but in many cases this wasn&#x27;t the full instrumental, so could be more awkward to use. Scepter, from this single onward began to regularly add a non-vocal side, helping to make it an industry standard practice, with several other labels following suit particularly for dance records, and DJs embracing these as a useful tool during their sets.

==== First extended edit ====
While not his first production work (his first mixing effort was the northern soul track by the Carstairs &quot;It Really Hurts Me Girl&quot; in 1973), in early 1974, during his quest to adapt songs beyond the radio-friendly three-minute mark for his mixtapes, soon-to-be famed disco mixer Tom Moulton went to record labels for material. At Scepter Records, Cheren recalls playing Tom a previously released Scepter single by singer Don Downing called &quot;Dream World&quot;. He had an extra copy of the master tape and let Moulton take it home to experiment. When Moulton brought it back a few days later, Cheren writes, &quot;We were amazed: a so-so record was suddenly snappy, upbeat, and ten times better&quot;. But the biggest surprise, Cheren continues, was something &quot;so radical I could hardly believe my ears&quot;. Moulton had stretched the original track, not even three minutes long, to almost double its time, and in the process debuted what would become known as the disco break. This innovation would eventually be issued on the song&#x27;s re-release on a 7-inch 45 in July 1974, and earn Scepter a Billboard &quot;Trendsetter of the Year&quot; award in December 1974 for &#x27;being the first label to make specialized mixes for discotheques&#x27;.

==== First segued mixes ====
The first genre-themed set was created by Spring Records, as a commercial compilation of various artists licensed from a number of labels called &quot;Disco Par-r-r-ty&quot;, released in October 1974. Tom Moulton created one for the A side of the Gloria Gaynor &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot; album, in January 1975 on MGM Records. As a development from his mixtapes, three songs (Honey Bee/Never Can Say Goodbye/Reach Out, I&#x27;ll Be There) were not presented as separate pieces of music, but as an uninterrupted, 18-minute-plus, side-long composition optimised for dancing. There were previous albums that had side-long tracks or suites, and medleys which were usually cover versions or re-recordings, but here was a new piece of music composed out of already recorded pieces of music (albeit containing two cover songs), making it the first &quot;DJ mix&quot; committed to vinyl, with Moulton admitting it was conceived as a tool for dancefloors. A followup was the Motown compilation &quot;Disc-O-Tech&quot; series released mid May 1975, which put together some of the label&#x27;s most danceable hits onto a number of albums. &quot;Disc-O-Tech #2&quot; however, specifically focused on blending a number of their disco releases into a non-stop medley.

==== Early acetates 10-inch and 12-inch ====
The first large-format single made specifically for discotheque DJs was a ten-inch acetate used by a mix engineer (José Rodríguez) in need of a Friday-night test copy for a remix created by Tom Moulton in 1974. The song was &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Holding On&quot; by Al Downing, brother of Don Downing. As no 7-inch (18 cm) acetates could be found, a 10-inch (25 cm) blank was used. Upon completion, Moulton found that such a large disc with only a couple of inches worth of grooves on it made him feel silly wasting all that space. He asked Rodríguez to re-cut it so that the grooves looked more spread out and ran to the normal center of the disc. Rodriguez told him that for it to be viable, the level would have to be increased considerably. Because of the wider spacing of the grooves, not only was a louder sound possible but also a wider overall dynamic range (distinction between loud and soft) as well. This was immediately noticed by them to give a more favorable, &#x27;hotter&#x27; sound which would appeal to discothèque play. It also meant that these extended versions being created by Moulton could be given to fellow DJs and tested within a nightclub environment to see how well it worked the dancefloor, with adjustments subsequently made to the remix.

Moulton&#x27;s position as the premiere mixer and &quot;fix it man&quot; for pop singles ensured that this fortunate accident would instantly become industry practice. This would perhaps have been a natural evolution: as dance tracks became much longer than had been the average for a pop song, and as the DJ in the club wanted sufficient dynamic range, the format would likely have enlarged from the seven-inch single eventually. Ironically, Moulton&#x27;s mix of Downing would be eventually released by Chess Records for sale to the general public, but only on a standard-issue 7-inch record for sale in October 1974. Further 10-inch acetates featuring the extended versions would be created by Moulton and Rodriguez from late 1974 such as Moment of Truth&#x27;s &quot;Your Love&quot; on Roulette in October and the aforementioned Don Downing &quot;Dream World&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ll be Holding On&quot; would eventually be cut onto a twelve-inch acetate, as chronicled by its usage on the music compilation album &quot;A Tom Moulton Mix.&quot;

An acetate twelve-inch test pressing single hailed as being a first by Moulton was South Shore Commission &quot;Free Man&quot;. Again, it was a disco mix prepared by Moulton, pressed by Rodríguez, with only a handful (around 10) cut and handed out to local DJs. These would have plain white labels, or very sparse printing or typed text. In many cases there would be no logos, and many contained handwritten text only. Test pressings being tried out at discos were reported on in Moulton&#x27;s weekly column in Billboard during early April 1975. Moulton&#x27;s effort was eventually issued for commercial release by Scepter in June 1975, but on seven-inch vinyl as a 5:35 min mix. Moulton subsequently created a lengthier 7:15 min mix for the album which appeared in late October.

Another record remixed by Moulton was the Philly Devotions &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Make It Without You&quot; on Columbia. Mentioned in his Billboard column in mid April as being &#x27;out soon&#x27;, a known 10-inch acetate had a date of 8 May 1975, with twelve-inch acetates and promos also appearing at some stage. It eventually was issued commercially in August on seven-inch 45 only. A sometimes mentioned candidate among these first acetates is Moment of Truth &quot;So Much For Love&quot;, but this effort was commercially released a year later, the band having been signed to Salsoul Records in June 1976, and the song only appearing in disco charts at the end of July of that year.

==== Promotion through media and DJs ====
Many of the above disco era timelines were driven by the DJ necessity to give a better nightclub dancefloor experience to patrons, and as the scene grew, it began to be chronicled in trade press publications such as &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot;. Tom Moulton began to write for the former from 26 October 1974 in the &quot;Disco Action&quot; column (which changed name as time went on), while Vince Aletti wrote &quot;Disco File&quot; in the latter from November 1974. The DJs would increasingly be expected to report back, much like with radio, with what songs worked on their dancefloors to the record company and mixers such as Moulton and others so that a strategic decision would be made whether to further fine tune or remix the music to enhance the reaction, typically a new edit would be repeatedly created, pressed on acetates and supplied until a good response was had from nightclubs, so creating a buzz which would drive the eventual commercial sales. To better feed those reactions back record pools were established, the first in New York in June 1975 for better distribution of pre-release records to bona fide DJs as record labels began to appreciate their role in breaking and selling records. A further development began to see the labels tailor the records specifically towards DJs as a result, with for example Scepter Records publicly announcing via both publications that they were to start servicing &#x27;12-inch 45s&#x27; to DJs in pools and their national promotional mailouts from June 1975. promoting the format earlier in distributor roadshows they hosted in late May, citing a key benefit of high volume levels being maintained with lengthier tracks. Billboard magazine reported that Atlantic Records were the first major label to issue 12-inch 33 rpm vinyl promos to DJs in July, under the watchful eye of a DJ as their promotions director Doug Riddick, who took up the post in May 1975.

==== Early vinyl test pressings 12-inch ====
An early test pressing was Bobby Moore &quot;(Call Me Your) Anything Man&quot;, on Scepter. Twelve-inch acetates for this single were pressed in April 1975, and was subsequently produced as twelve-inch vinyl promotional singles with typed labels in June. Moulton, now a regular in-house remixer for the label, was again given label credit for the remix. This was released commercially on 7-inch in May 1975.

==== First wide scale promotional 12-inch ====
A very early disco prototype vinyl 12-inch pressing was a Midland International promo distributed by RCA - this was a Carol Douglas one sided EP with 4 tracks from &quot;The Carol Douglas Album.&quot; This was issued in mid February 1975 and was subtitled &#x27;Specially Prepared For Disco Use&#x27;, but it held same length versions of the selected album tracks.

The first wide-scale record company promotional twelve-inch single according to Moulton (considering his then position with Billboard at the time as disco product reviewer, and that most of the very limited 12-inch records up to this point involved his own remixes), was Frankie Valli &quot;Swearin&#x27; To God&quot;, issued by Private Stock Records in June 1975 with a 10:32 min running time. Bob Crewe, co-writer and producer, personally presented 10-inch test pressings to DJs in April 1975 after high pre-release demand. It was then issued commercially as a 7-inch at the end of April/start of May 1975.

Barrabas &quot;Mellow Blow&quot; became the first 33 rpm Atlantic promo to be released in July, but eventually commercially only on an 7&quot; in September. Warner-Spector&#x27;s Calhoon &quot;(Do You Wanna) Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; had a 10-inch acetate from May, given out as a one sided 10-inch vinyl promo in the same month, and as a 12-inch promo in July 1975.

At first, these special remixed or extended versions were only available as promotional copies to DJs, either given directly to them or issued by record pools who obtained these from record companies&#x27; A&amp;R departments. Examples of these promos, released from spring/summer 1975, include:
==== First 12-inch retail singles ====

===== Motivation for public sale =====
As time went on, a growing number of record labels became aware of the 12-inch format as a useful promotional tool, the benefits it gave for sound fidelity, and started to issue product in response. However, into early 1976 none considered them at first as suitable for sale to the general public. Companies came to appreciate the place of the nightclub and how they helped to break a record, but still considered an extended remix to ultimately facilitate sales of the original 7-inch single version or the artist&#x27;s album, and not as a sale item in its own right. Pop orientated labels began to use the format to promote commercial artists with dance elements to their music, but not necessarily lengthening their tracks, concentrating instead on its novel aspects. The costs for the format were also still prohibitive; one label reported 12-inch singles cost more than it did to press an album.

However, demand was being driven by record shops, particularly those serving disco product, with feedback from buyers. It was particularly noticed that many of the previously released promotional 12-inch singles were attracting a premium in the resellers marketplace, with them in some cases changing hands for the price of an album. Along with research done by labels to get a feel of the interest for the proposed format, a push was finally made by a self-proclaimed &#x27;pioneer&#x27; label of the disco business.

===== Releases =====
The first song found on a twelve-inch single commercially issued for public purchase from the disco era onwards was &quot;Ten Percent&quot; by Double Exposure on Salsoul Records in mid May 1976. This was due to the label co-owner Ken Cayre&#x27;s decision to release the Walter Gibbons remix for dancers who would hear that version in nightclubs but not be satisfied with the shorter versions sold on the 7-inch vinyl or the album. The seven-inch edit had been released a month earlier but sales of this were slow. With renewed interest and high sales weeks after the release, Salsoul were presented with Billboard awards at the 1976 Disco Forum event for disco disk sales to consumers and best record label as a result of the push into the marketplace with the new format. The issue did not contain the 3 min 5 secs 7-inch edit or the 6 mins 51 mins album version; the A side contained the Gibbons 9 min 43 secs remix, while Cayre himself created an extended 7 min 31 secs mix for the B side.

The second twelve-inch release was the double artist single Jesse Green &quot;Nice And Slow&quot; / Sweet Music &quot;I Get Lifted&quot; on Scepter/Wand in mid June 1976. Third was a disc containing two George Benson sides &quot;Summertime 2001&quot; / &quot;Theme From Good King Bad&quot; in late June 1976 on CTI Records. Salsoul&#x27;s second 12-inch record for retail was by Moment of Truth &quot;So Much For Love&quot; / &quot;Helplessly&quot; released in early July 1976. Amherst Records released a double headed single by the Chicago Gangsters &quot;Gangster Love&quot; / &quot;Feel Like Making Love&quot; in early July 1976 on their Gold Plate subsidiary. A clutch of releases including Jakki &quot;Sun... Sun... Sun&quot; and Four Below Zero &quot;My Baby&#x27;s Got E.S.P.&quot;, amongst others on Pyramid/Roulette Records was sold from mid July 1976.

=== Australia ===
Two twelve-inch promotional vinyl issues for rock/folk Shelter Records artists were serviced to radio stations in April 1972 by local distributor Tempo Records:

=== France ===
Early titles first appeared in 1976 on the Pathe Marconi EMI and Disques Vogue imprints, these included pop releases such as Paul McCartney&#x27;s first ever extended single internationally, credited as Wings &quot;Let &#x27;Em In&quot;

=== Jamaican discomixes ===

Although as previously mentioned regarding the Jamaican dub influence on the use of 10-inch acetates, the 12-inch single was only born once imports of US disco singles were established from 1976 onwards. The issued twelve-inch-single trend spread to Jamaica quickly, where hundreds of reggae singles were pressed in this format, and commercially issued as &quot;discomixes&quot; to catch on the disco hype. An early 12-inch pressing, reputedly the first was by the Jayes &quot;Truly&quot; in 1977 on the Channel One label, which was run by the Hoo Kim brothers from their Channel One Studios.

=== United Kingdom ===
The Jamaican reggae and US disco trend also hit London, reggae being popular along with uptempo forms of music such as Motown and northern soul, the seven-inch record being the primary medium in the early 1970s for this material, with the UK following up a little later than the US with 12-inch singles. The reasons were different, the UK jocks did not have the same need to extend records like the US pioneers who wanted longer records for the dancefloor. Although the use of larger temporary singles (primarily 10-inch) started from the Jamaican influence and before (such as the pre-Beatles band the Quarrymen with the one-off &quot;In Spite of All the Danger&quot; in 1958), acetates were also used by the record labels to quality control the eventual product, and not for servicing single songs or exclusive remixes, and then not in the 12-inch format. The usage of the 12-inch vinyl as a medium followed the US promos introduction but was initially seen as a marketing tool to help promote an artist more uniquely. Another emphasis with the new format was the louder sound and better audio quality afforded to the release. It therefore was not exclusively used for disco songs but included pop artists, however it eventually came into its own in the later 1970s with the lengthened versions of US disco songs being promoted in the UK.

==== Promo UK 12-inch releases ====
Atlantic Records was an early front runner with two 12-inch promo singles: Ben E. King &quot;Supernatural Thing&quot; backed with Osiris &quot;Warsaw Concerto&quot;, along with Herbie Mann &quot;Hijack&quot; b/w Jimmy Castor Bunch &quot;The Bertha Butt Boogie&quot;, both at 33 rpm and issued in approximately June 1975 (based on the catalogue numbers used), but rumoured to be as late as October. Robert Palmer &quot;Which of Us Is the Fool&quot; was released by Island Records also in October 1975. Virgin started a line of 12-inch promos in November 1975, with the first being Ruan O&#x27;Lochlainn &quot;Another Street Gang&quot;. Disco singles started to appear in earnest months later, Brass Construction &quot;Changin&#x27;&quot; was promoted around March 1976 by United Artists. A later 12-inch promo issue was a double sider the Moments &quot;Nine Times&quot; / the Rimshots &quot;Do What You Feel&quot; on All Platinum Records via Phonogram in the middle of April 1976, however both were released commercially and individually on seven-inch 45s only, in April 1976. Candi Staton followed with &quot;Young Hearts Run Free&quot; in the middle of May from Warner Bros. These early issues usually containing the original 7-inch edit, It took a little later for lengthened versions to begin appearing, with 1970s UK club DJ Greg Wilson recalling promotional 12-inch product being mailed out from August 1976, Lalo Schifrin &quot;Jaws&quot; being his first one, which was in extended form. This was followed by disco acts such as James Wells, the Originals, Ultrafunk, Mass Production, Deodato and the Undisputed Truth, however some of these were not UK pressed vinyl but US promos sent over to the UK and distributed through club promotions businesses and record company A&amp;R departments.

==== First UK 12-inch retail singles ====
The first commercially released twelve-inch vinyl was Ernie Bush &quot;Breakaway&quot; / Banzaii &quot;Chinese Kung Fu&quot; both as Tom Moulton mixes, along with another disc containing the Armada Orchestra &quot;For the Love of Money&quot; / Ultrafunk &quot;Sting Your Jaws (Part 1)&quot;. Bush and the latter two acts had Gerry Shury production involvement, and these two releases were issued by John Abbey&#x27;s Contempo Records from 8 October 1976, these songs having been previously released in either 7-inch format or as album tracks. Abbey likely had the nod from Scepter Records about the use of the twelve-inch single format, as both had released all these titles on their labels and Contempo had cross-licensed the tracks with Moulton mixes. This was closely followed with a single containing re-issues of the Who&#x27;s &quot;Substitute&quot; with &quot;I&#x27;m A Boy&quot; / &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot; on the flip, all originally from 1966 and 1967 by Polydor Records on 22 October 1976.

==Later developments==

=== Core sales period ===
Notable 1970s and 1980s releases making use of the new length opportunities of the format included Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot; (16 min 50 seconds), &quot;I Feel Love&quot; (15:45), and Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; (15:00). The broad visual spacing of the grooves on the twelve-inch records made it easy for the DJ in locating the approximate area of the &quot;breaks&quot; on the disc&#x27;s surface in dim club light (without having to listen while dropping and re-dropping the stylus to find the right point). A quick study of any DJs favorite discs will reveal mild wear in the &quot;break points&quot; on the discs&#x27; surfaces that can clearly be seen by the naked eye, which further eases the &quot;cueing&quot; task (a club DJs tone-arm cartridge will be heavily weighted and mild wear will seldom spoil the sound quality). Many DJ-only remix services, such as Ultimix and Hot Tracks, issued sets with deliberately visualised groove separations (i.e., the record was cut with narrow and wider spacings that could be seen on the surface, marking the mix points on the often multi-song discs). Motown were one of the first to &quot;eye cue&quot; their 12-inch disco discs, giving DJs the track&#x27;s BPM and info on the exact length of the various sections of the song - one of the earliest examples of a record company recognising how important the DJ was to become by making their product more user-friendly.

Following the lead of the US club DJs, using 12-inch extended versions in the UK as a mixing tool was advocated particularly by James Hamilton of the Record Mirror music weekly paper, with him notably indicating the approximate BPM of late 1970s disco tracks onwards. Increasingly in the 1980s, many pop and even rock artists released twelve-inch singles that included longer, extended, or remixed versions of the actual track being promoted by the single. These versions were frequently labeled with the parenthetical designation &quot;12-inch version&quot;, &quot;12-inch mix&quot;, &quot;extended remix&quot;, &quot;dance mix&quot;, or &quot;club mix&quot;, before its usage becoming commonplace in the early/mid 1980s developing alongside turntabalism in use for the electro and hip-hop genres, but was regularised with the advent of the late 1980s house music scene. Later musical styles took advantage of this new format and recording levels on vinyl twelve-inch &quot;maxi-singles&quot; have steadily increased, culminating in the extremely loud (or &quot;hot&quot;) cuts of drum and bass records of the 1990s and early 2000s.

Many record labels produced mainly twelve-inch singles (in addition to albums) during the 1980s, lots being mostly regular A and B-sides, not remixes. Certain labels such as Factory Records, only ever released a handful of seven-inch singles. One of Factory&#x27;s resident artists, alternative rock/dance quartet New Order, produced the biggest-selling twelve-inch record ever in the United Kingdom, &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, selling about 800,000 copies on the format and over a million copies in total (not counting later remixes). It was somewhat helped by the fact that Factory did not release a seven-inch version of the single until 1988, five years after the single was originally released as a twelve-inch-only release. Besides, the seven-inch version that was released was not the original 1983 version released on twelve-inch, but a re-recording called &quot;Blue Monday 1988&quot;.

=== Decline and ongoing interest ===

Singles in general have followed wider gramophone record sales, withstanding competition from the 1960s and 70s reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette formats. The widespread popularity of Sony&#x27;s Walkman was a key factor that contributed to fewer record sales in the 1980s. In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity in the U.S. between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles. Record companies also deleted many record titles from production and distribution, or simply did not make 12-inch singles for many pop artists, further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format&#x27;s decline in popularity, and was seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs which were at the time more profitable for the record companies, and more latterly, streaming.

Twelve-inch singles production continued for dance acts or for dance remixes of commercial artists as there was a continued high regard of the format from DJs into the 2000s and 2010s. A growing number of DJs eventually began to use CDJs for their convenience, and later along with a crossover period where turntables could be combined with laptops and used with encoded 12 inch discs and DJ software, which could manipulate MP3 or WAV music files but still allow for a turntablism experience. DJ controller all-in-one decks have in later times become the norm which take up less space than a pair of turntables, reducing DJs dependence on the physical format even further. There is however, a dedicated DJ sub-community that has maintained their usage of the format, with retro styled &quot;vinyl only&quot; nights being a unique selling point. In addition, there have been some new titles being pressed on the format and available at physical record shops alongside an ongoing cultural vinyl revival, although many sales take place online. There is also a notable second-hand trade business on online sale and auction marketplaces for collectors, of which some titles are still in demand and can be of some value.

<doc id="295829" wikidata="Q426221" url="?curid=295829" title="Reflection (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, a reflection (also spelled reflexion) is a mapping from a Euclidean space to itself that is an isometry with a hyperplane as the set of fixed points; this set is called the axis (in dimension 2) or plane (in dimension 3) of reflection. The image of a figure by a reflection is its mirror image in the axis or plane of reflection. For example the mirror image of the small Latin letter p for a reflection with respect to a vertical axis (a &quot;vertical reflection&quot;) would look like q. Its image by reflection in a horizontal axis (a &quot;horizontal reflection&quot;) would look like b. A reflection is an involution: when applied twice in succession, every point returns to its original location, and every geometrical object is restored to its original state.

The term &quot;reflection&quot; is sometimes used for a larger class of mappings from a Euclidean space to itself, namely the non-identity isometries that are involutions. The set of fixed points (the &quot;mirror&quot;) of such an isometry is an affine subspace, but is possibly smaller than a hyperplane. For instance a reflection through a point is an involutive isometry with just one fixed point; the image of the letter p under it
would look like a d. This operation is also known as a central inversion , and exhibits Euclidean space as a symmetric space. In a Euclidean vector space, the reflection in the point situated at the origin is the same as vector negation. Other examples include reflections in a line in three-dimensional space. Typically, however, unqualified use of the term &quot;reflection&quot; means reflection in a hyperplane.

Some mathematicians use &quot;flip&quot; as a synonym for &quot;reflection&quot;.

==Construction==
In a plane (or, respectively, 3-dimensional) geometry, to find the reflection of a point drop a perpendicular from the point to the line (plane) used for reflection, and extend it the same distance on the other side. To find the reflection of a figure, reflect each point in the figure.

To reflect point through the line using compass and straightedge, proceed as follows (see figure):

* Step 1 (red): construct a circle with center at and some fixed radius to create points and on the line , which will be equidistant from .
* Step 2 (green): construct circles centered at and having radius . and will be the points of intersection of these two circles.

Point is then the reflection of point through line .

==Properties==

The matrix for a reflection is orthogonal with determinant −1 and eigenvalues −1, 1, 1, ..., 1. The product of two such matrices is a special orthogonal matrix that represents a rotation. Every rotation is the result of reflecting in an even number of reflections in hyperplanes through the origin, and every improper rotation is the result of reflecting in an odd number. Thus reflections generate the orthogonal group, and this result is known as the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem.

Similarly the Euclidean group, which consists of all isometries of Euclidean space, is generated by reflections in affine hyperplanes. In general, a group generated by reflections in affine hyperplanes is known as a reflection group. The finite groups generated in this way are examples of Coxeter groups.

==Reflection across a line in the plane==

Reflection across an arbitrary line through the origin in two dimensions can be described by the following formula
:formula_1

where formula_2 denotes the vector being reflected, formula_3 denotes any vector in the line across which the reflection is performed, and formula_4 denotes the dot product of formula_2 with formula_3. Note the formula above can also be written as
:formula_7
saying that a reflection of formula_2 across formula_3 is equal to 2 times the projection of formula_2 on formula_3, minus the vector formula_2. Reflections in a line have the eigenvalues of 1, and −1.

==Reflection through a hyperplane in &quot;n&quot; dimensions==
Given a vector formula_2 in Euclidean space formula_14, the formula for the reflection in the hyperplane through the origin, orthogonal to formula_15, is given by

:formula_16

where formula_17 denotes the dot product of formula_2 with formula_15. Note that the second term in the above equation is just twice the vector projection of formula_2 onto formula_15. One can easily check that
*, if formula_2 is parallel to formula_15, and
*, if formula_2 is perpendicular to .

Using the geometric product, the formula is

:formula_25

Since these reflections are isometries of Euclidean space fixing the origin they may be represented by orthogonal matrices. The orthogonal matrix corresponding to the above reflection is the matrix

:formula_26

where formula_27 denotes the formula_28 identity matrix and formula_29 is the transpose of a. Its entries are

:formula_30

where is the Kronecker delta.

The formula for the reflection in the affine hyperplane formula_31 not through the origin is
:formula_32

<doc id="295830" wikidata="Q3240512" url="?curid=295830" title="Young Communist League USA">
<text>The Young Communist League USA (YCLUSA) is a communist youth organization in the United States. The stated aim of the League is the development of its members into Communists, through studying socialism and through active participation in the struggles of the American working class. The YCL recognizes the Communist Party USA as the party for socialism in the United States and operates as the Party&#x27;s youth wing. Although the name of the group changed a number of times during its existence, its origins trace back to 1920, shortly after the establishment of the first communist parties in the United States.

On November 14, 2015, the CPUSA&#x27;s National Committee voted to suspend funding to the Young Communist League and the organization was subsequently dissolved.

In 2019, at the 31st party convention, the organization was re-established.

== History ==

=== The underground period ===
As early as 1920, a skeleton of a &quot;Young People&#x27;s Communist League&quot; was in existence. This minuscule, largely paper organization sent a fraternal delegate to the 2nd Convention of the United Communist Party, held at Kingston, New York from December 24, 1920, to January 2, 1921. A report was delivered by this delegate on the youth situation in America and the convention at this time first decided to establish a serious youth section, to be called the Young Communist League. The resolution passed by the convention pledged the UCP would provide its youth section assistance by helping to produce and distribute its literature, by helping to gain control of existing units of the Independent YPSL and organizing them into communist groups, by helping to organize new units, by providing it financial assistance, by lending it speakers and teachers, and by allotting it space in the official party periodicals.

This did not mean that there was no national convention of the organization. The founding convention of the YCL was held early in May 1922, apparently in Bethel, Connecticut. It was a small and low key gathering, including just fourteen delegates from four of the Communist Party&#x27;s twelve national districts. The gathering heard a report from Max Bedacht of the adult party dealing with the discussions and decisions of the 3rd World Congress of the Communist International and its February 1922 special conference. The convention adopted a constitution and a program for the YCL, as well as a resolution delineating the relationship of the youth league with the adult party. A governing National Executive Committee of five members was elected. The initiation fee to join the YCL was 50 cents and dues were 25 cents per month, receipted with stamps issued by the National Office. The basic unit of organization was the &quot;group&quot; consisting, ideally, of from five to ten members and meeting at least every other week. Groups elected their own captains to coordinate their activities with the center. Multiple groups were parts of a &quot;section&quot; of up to five groups; multiple sections were part of a &quot;sub-district,&quot; which was in turn a subdivision of the regular geographic &quot;districts&quot; of the Communist Party.

=== Establishment of the &quot;overground&quot; organization ===
As a YWL leader, Nat Ganley (then still using his birth name Nat Kaplan) summarized the difference between his communist group and others by stating: &quot;Let us remember that is it mainly on this point that we differ from the old form of child organization – the worker&#x27;s Sunday schools. We are not only preparing the child for future participation in class struggle–we are leading the child in the class struggle now!&quot;

The founding convention of the YWL was held in Brooklyn, New York from May 13 to 15, 1922, held appropriately enough at Finnish Socialist Hall. Oliver Carlson delivered the keynote speech to the thirty regular and five fraternal delegates. Carlson claimed a presence for the nascent YWL in forty-six cities and a membership of &quot;at the very least,&quot; 2,200.

The basic unit of organization of the YWL was the &quot;branch,&quot; consisting of at least five but no more than one hundred and fifty members. Two or more branches in a single large city were to form a &quot;City Central Committee&quot; to coordinate their activities, and all units were to be part of the regular array of districts used by the adult party. The initiation fee was 25 cents and dues 25 cents per month, with all initiation fees and 10 cents of every month&#x27;s dues going to support the National Office.

===The depression decade and after===
On October 17, 1943, the YCL convened in national convention in New York City, passed a resolution dissolving itself, and immediately reconvened under a new organizational name, the American Youth for Democracy (AYD). This predated a similar move transforming the adult Communist Party, USA into the &quot;Communist Political Association&quot; by seven months. The change of names proved to be strictly semantic, as all important positions within the &quot;new&quot; AYD were held by former members of the YCL. National Executive Secretary of the AYD at the time of its October 1943 launch was Carl Ross, the former head of the YCL for a period of more than five years.

The CPUSA reestablished a youth organization in 1949 as the Labor Youth League, which dissolved in the dissension following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the 20th Congress of the CPSU. In 1965, after a period of mainly local activity, the DuBois Clubs were formed and later renamed the Young Workers Liberation League before reaffirming the original name Young Communist League in 1984.

=== Re-establishment ===
In 2019, a resolution at the 31st National Convention of the CPUSA was passed which called to re-establish the Young Communist League.

<text>In psychology, alogia (; from Greek ἀ-, &quot;without&quot;, and λόγος, &quot;speech&quot; + New Latin -ia) is poor thinking inferred from speech and language usage.
There may be a general lack of additional, unprompted content seen in normal speech, so replies to questions may be brief and concrete, with less spontaneous speech. This is termed poverty of speech
or [[Laconic phrase|laconic]] speech. 
The amount of speech may be normal but conveys little information because it is vague, empty, stereotyped, overconcrete, overabstract, or repetitive. 
This is termed poverty of content 
or poverty of content of speech.
Under Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms used in clinical research, thought blocking is considered a part of alogia, and so is increased latency in response.

This condition is associated with schizophrenia, dementia, severe depression, and autism.
As a symptom, it is commonly seen in patients with schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder, and is traditionally considered a negative symptom. It can complicate psychotherapy severely because of the considerable difficulty in holding a fluent conversation.

The alternative meaning of alogia is inability to speak because of dysfunction in the central nervous system, 
found in mental deficiency and dementia.
In this sense, the word is synonymous with aphasia, 
and in less severe form, it is sometimes called dyslogia.

== Characteristics ==
Alogia may be on a continuum with normal behaviors. People without mental illness may have it occasionally including when fatigued or disinhibited, when writers use language creatively, when people in certain disciplinessuch as politicians, administrators, philosophers, ministers, and scientistsuse language pedantically. 
Hence, deciding if an individual has alogia depends on contextual clues. Is the person in control? Can the person moderate the effect if asked to be specific or concise? Is it better with another topic? Are there other significant symptoms?

Alogia is characterized by a lack of speech, often caused by a disruption in the thought process. Usually, an injury to the left side of the brain may cause alogia to appear in an individual. While in conversation, alogic patients will reply very sparsely and their answers to questions will lack spontaneous content; sometimes, they will even fail to answer at all. Their responses will be brief, generally only appearing as a response to a question or prompt.

Apart from the lack of content in a reply, the manner in which the person delivers the reply is affected as well. Patients affected by alogia will often slur their responses, and not pronounce the consonants as clearly as usual. The few words spoken usually trail off into a whisper, or are just ended by the second syllable. Studies have shown a correlation between alogic ratings in individuals and the amount and duration of pauses in their speech when responding to a series of questions posed by the researcher.
The inability to speak stems from a deeper mental inability that causes alogic patients to have difficulty grasping the right words mentally, as well as formulating their thoughts. A study investigating alogiacs and their results on the category fluency task showed that people with schizophrenia who exhibit alogia display a more disorganized semantic memory than controls. While both groups produced the same number of words, the words produced by people with schizophrenia were much more disorderly and the results of cluster analysis revealed bizarre coherence in the alogiac group.

If the condition is assessed using a language other than the individual&#x27;s primary language, the medical professional needs to make sure that the problem is not from language barriers.

This condition is associated with schizophrenia, dementia, and severe depression.

==Example==
The following table shows an example of &quot;poverty of speech&quot; which shows replies to questions that are brief and concrete, with a reduction in spontaneous speech:
The following example of &quot;poverty of content of speech&quot; is a response from a patient when asked why he was in a hospital. Speech is vague, conveys little information, but is not grossly incoherent and the amount of speech is not reduced. &quot;I often contemplate—it is a general stance of the world—it is a tendency which varies from time to time—it defines things more than others—it is in the nature of habit—this is what I would like to say to explain everything.&quot;

==Causes==
Alogia can be brought on by frontostriatal dysfunction which causes degradation of the semantic store, the center located in the temporal lobe that processes meaning in language. A subgroup of chronic schizophrenia patients in a word generation experiment generated fewer words than the unaffected subjects and had limited lexicons, evidence of the weakening of the semantic store. Another study found that when given the task of naming items in a category, schizophrenia patients displayed a great struggle but improved significantly when experimenters employed a second stimulus to guide behavior unconsciously. This conclusion was similar to results produced from patients with Huntington&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s disease, ailments which also involve frontostriatal dysfunction.

==Treatment==
Medical studies conclude that certain adjunctive drugs effectively palliate the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, mainly alogia. In one study, Maprotiline produced the greatest reduction in alogia symptoms with severity reduction in 50% of patients (out of 10). Of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, alogia had the second best responsiveness to the drugs, surpassed only by attention deficiency. D-amphetamine is another drug that has been tested on people with schizophrenia and found success in alleviating negative symptoms. This treatment, however, has not been developed greatly as it seems to have adverse effects on other aspects of schizophrenia such as increasing the severity of positive symptoms.

==Relation to schizophrenia==
Although alogia is found as a symptom in a variety of health disorders, it is most commonly found as a negative symptom of schizophrenia.

Previous studies and analyses conclude that at least three factors are needed to cover both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; the three are: psychotic, disorganization, and negative symptom factors. Studies suggest that an inappropriate affect is strongly associated with bizarre behavior and positive formal thought disorder on a disorganization factor; attention impairment correlates significantly with psychotic, disorganization, and negative symptom factors. Alogia contains both positive and negative symptoms, with the poverty of content of speech as the disorganization factor, and poverty of speech, response latency, and thought blocking as the negative symptom factors.

Alogia is a major diagnostic sign of schizophrenia, when organic mental disorders have been excluded.

In schizophrenia, negative symptoms including flattening of affect, avolition, and alogia are responsible for the considerable morbidity of the disease compared with other psychotic disorders.
Negative symptoms are common in the prodromal and residual phases of the disease and can be severe.
During the first year, negative symptoms can progress, especially alogia, which may start off from a relatively low rate. Within 2 years, up to 25% of patients will have significant negative symptoms.
Psychotic symptoms tend to diminish as the individuals age, but negative symptoms tend to persist.
Prominent negative symptoms at disease onset, including alogia, are good predictors of worse outcomes.

Negative symptoms can arise in the presence of other psychiatric symptoms. Positive symptoms are a common cause of apathy, social withdrawal, and alogia. Secondary causes of negative symptoms, such as depression and demoralization, often remit within a year, which helps distinguishing them from primary negative symptoms. Symptoms that don&#x27;t diminish over a year with medications should be reconsidered as possible primary negative symptoms.

<text>Mount Holly Cemetery is a historic cemetery located in the Quapaw Quarter area of downtown Little Rock in the U.S. state of Arkansas, and is the burial place for numerous Arkansans of note. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and has been nicknamed &quot;The Westminster Abbey of Arkansas&quot;.

==Major events==

===&quot;Tales of the Crypt&quot;===
Every year in October several drama students from Parkview Arts and Science Magnet High School are each given a person buried in the cemetery to research. They then prepare short monologues or dialogues, complete with period costumes, to be performed in front of the researched person&#x27;s grave. Audiences are led through the cemetery from grave to grave by guides with candles. The event is called &quot;Tales of the Crypt&quot;. Although it takes place around the same time as the American holiday Halloween, the event is meant to be historic rather than spooky.

===2016 vandalism===
The cemetery experienced heavy vandalism in the overnight hours of April 20, 2016. Numerous headstones were toppled and smashed, including the well-known statues of a mourner next to statues of two little girls.

==Notable burials==
The cemetery is the burial place for ten former Arkansas governors, seven United States senators, 14 Arkansas Supreme Court justices, 21 Little Rock mayors, numerous Arkansas literary figures, Confederate generals, and other worthies.

<text>The Norwegian Student Choral Society () is a Norwegian male voice choir, founded in 1845 by Johan Diederich Behrens. It is the second oldest choir in Norway and the official choir of the University of Oslo.

Premiering a number of well known pieces, including Norway&#x27;s national anthem &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot;, the choir is most commonly known for their yearly outdoor concert at University Square on 17 May, the Norwegian Constitution Day. The concert is broadcast live on NRK Radio.

The choirs&#x27; first official performance was at Henrik Wergeland&#x27;s funeral.

Commonly referred to as &quot;DnS&quot; by members and friends, the choir holds regular concerts, both independently and in collaboration with other artists, choirs and orchestras.

==Present day choir==

As of 2016, the choir has around 60 active singers, who are conducted by Marit Tøndel Bodsberg.

It consists of the so-called &quot;Concert Choir&quot;, containing the most active members, and a number of older members, with their own conductor, who go by the name &quot;DnX&quot;.

DnS have competed in a number of international competitions. In the World Choir Games of 2006, in Xiamen, China, it won first place in the male voice choir category and third place in sacred choral music

== Excerpts from DnS&#x27; history ==

===Johan Diederich Behrens===

Founder of The Norwegian Student Choral Society was Johan Diederich Behrens; and the &quot;Johan Behrens Quartet&quot;, a male voice ensemble founded in 1843, formed the core of the first choir. The initial reason for the formation of the choir was a wish, in the summer of 1845, to participate at the Nordic student meeting in Lund and Copenhagen. The students contacted Behrens a short time before their departure to Copenhagen. Behrens, at first, declined to assist in the formation of choir due to the limited amount of time they had left to rehearse. He was eventually persuaded and accepted on the condition that &quot;he&quot; had the final word on which songs were rehearsed well enough for performance. On July 10, 1845, the society&#x27;s laws were signed. However, Behrens, wanting to focus on his studies, did not wish to continue as conductor; and passed on the job to Halfdan Kjerulf.

<doc id="295842" wikidata="Q608772" url="?curid=295842" title="Arnulf of Chocques">
<text>Arnulf of Chocques (died 1118) was a leading member of the clergy during the First Crusade, being made Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem in 1099 and again from 1112 to 1118. Sometimes referred to as Arnulf of Rœulx, presumably after the village of Rœulx some 70km from his home village of Chocques, he was given the nickname Malecorne, meaning badly tonsured.

==Biography==
Arnulf was the illegitimate son of a Flemish priest, and studied under Lanfranc at Caen. In the 1070s he was a tutor to Cecilia, daughter of William I of England. He also taught Ralph of Caen, one of the later chroniclers of the First Crusade. He was also close to Odo of Bayeux, who he accompanied on the Crusade. He was the chaplain of the Norman crusader army led by Robert of Normandy, Cecilia&#x27;s brother and William&#x27;s son. He was most likely appointed a papal legate, under the authority of the overall legate Adhemar of Le Puy, and after Adhemar&#x27;s death in 1098 he shared control of the clergy with fellow legate Peter of Narbonne. Some of the non-Norman knights in the other crusader armies believed he was corrupt, and they apparently sang vulgar songs about him, but most crusaders respected him as an eloquent preacher.

He was one of the chief skeptics about Peter Bartholomew&#x27;s claims to have discovered the Holy Lance in Antioch, and because of Arnulf&#x27;s opposition Peter volunteered to undergo an ordeal by fire. Arnulf&#x27;s opposition to Peter brought him into conflict with Raymond of St. Gilles, who believed Peter&#x27;s story. To help ease the crisis among the crusaders over the issue, and also to lift spirits after Peter&#x27;s death during the ordeal, Arnulf helped make a statue of Christ which was placed on one of the siege engines during the siege of Jerusalem. After the capture of Jerusalem he discovered the True Cross in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This discovery was not as controversial as the discovery of the Lance, although it was just as suspicious. Arnulf may have been trying to make up for the problems he caused disproving the authenticity of the Lance, and the True Cross became the most sacred relic of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

After Raymond left Jerusalem on 1 August 1099, Arnulf was elected Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. He was supported by Godfrey of Bouillon, the first ruler of Jerusalem, and in turn he supported Godfrey&#x27;s decision to make Jerusalem a secular kingdom rather than one ruled by the clergy. He accompanied Godfrey in the Battle of Ascalon, with a relic of the True Cross. Arnulf enforced the Latin rite among the crusaders, banning all others thus further alienating the disaffected Greeks. However, his election was soon subject to doubts concerning its canonicity, as he was not yet a deacon. Before he could be ordained, he was replaced in December by Dagobert of Pisa, whom Pope Paschal II had appointed legate. Arnulf was instead appointed archdeacon of Jerusalem.

In 1112 he officially became Patriarch, though many of the other clerics distrusted him and found him unnecessarily harsh. He was especially unpopular with the Orthodox and Syriac Christians when he prohibited non-Latin masses at the Holy Sepulchre. He was accused of various crimes: sexual relations with a Muslim woman, simony, and most importantly condoning the bigamous marriage of King Baldwin I to Adelaide del Vasto while his first wife Arda of Armenia was still alive. He was briefly deposed by a papal legate in 1115, but appealed to Pope Paschal II and was reinstated in 1116, provided that he annul Baldwin and Adelaide&#x27;s marriage.

He remained Patriarch until his death in 1118.

Arnulf married his niece Emma, also called Emelota, to Eustace Garnier, the Latin seigneur of Caesarea and Sidon. After his death, Emma married Hugh II of Le Puiset.

<text>In geometry, inversive geometry is the study of &quot;inversion&quot;, a transformation of the Euclidean plane that maps circles or lines to other circles or lines and that preserves the angles between crossing curves. Many difficult problems in geometry become much more tractable when an inversion is applied. Inversion seems to have been discovered by a number of people contemporaneously, including Steiner (1824), Quetelet (1825), Bellavitis (1836), Stubbs and Ingram (1842–3) and Kelvin (1845).

The concept of inversion can be generalized to higher-dimensional spaces.

== Inversion in a circle ==

=== Inverse of a point ===

To invert a number in arithmetic usually means to take its reciprocal. A closely related idea in geometry is that of &quot;inverting&quot; a point. In the plane, the inverse of a point &quot;P&quot; with respect to a &quot;reference circle (Ø)&quot; with center &quot;O&quot; and radius &quot;r&quot; is a point &quot;P&quot;″, lying on the ray from &quot;O&quot; through &quot;P&quot; such that

:formula_1

This is called circle inversion or plane inversion. The inversion taking any point &quot;P&quot; (other than &quot;O&quot;) to its image &quot;P&quot;″ also takes &quot;P&quot;″ back to &quot;P&quot;, so the result of applying the same inversion twice is the identity transformation which makes it a self-inversion (i.e. an involution). To make the inversion a total function that is also defined for &quot;O&quot;, it is necessary to introduce a point at infinity, a single point placed on all the lines, and extend the inversion, by definition, to interchange the center &quot;O&quot; and this point at infinity.

It follows from the definition that the inversion of any point inside the reference circle must lie outside it, and vice versa, with the center and the point at infinity changing positions, whilst any point on the circle is unaffected (is &quot;invariant&quot; under inversion). In summary, for a point inside the circle, the nearer the point to the center, the further away its transformation. While for any point (inside or outside the circle), the nearer the point to the circle, the closer its transformation.

==== Compass and straightedge construction ====
===== Point outside circle =====
To construct the inverse &quot;P″&quot; of a point &quot;P&quot; outside a circle &quot;Ø&quot;:
* Draw the segment from &quot;O&quot; (center of circle &quot;Ø&quot;) to &quot;P&quot;.
* Let &quot;M&quot; be the midpoint of &quot;OP&quot;. (Not shown)
* Draw the circle &quot;c&quot; with center &quot;M&quot; going through &quot;P&quot;. (Not labeled. It&#x27;s the blue circle)
* Let &quot;N&quot; and &quot;N″&quot; be the points where &quot;Ø&quot; and &quot;c&quot; intersect.
* Draw segment &quot;NN″&quot;.
* &quot;P″&quot; is where &quot;OP&quot; and &quot;NN″&quot; intersect.

===== Point inside circle =====
To construct the inverse &quot;P&quot; of a point &quot;P″&quot; inside a circle &quot;Ø&quot;:
* Draw ray &quot;r&quot; from &quot;O&quot; (center of circle &quot;Ø&quot;) through &quot;P″&quot;. (Not labeled, it&#x27;s the horizontal line)
* Draw line &quot;s&quot; through &quot;P″&quot; perpendicular to &quot;r&quot;. (Not labeled. It&#x27;s the vertical line)
* Let &quot;N&quot; be one of the points where &quot;Ø&quot; and &quot;s&quot; intersect.
* Draw the segment &quot;ON&quot;.
* Draw line &quot;t&quot; through &quot;N&quot; perpendicular to &quot;ON&quot;.
* &quot;P&quot; is where ray &quot;r&quot; and line &quot;t&quot; intersect.

=== Dutta&#x27;s construction ===
There is a construction of the inverse point to &quot;A&quot; with respect to a circle &quot;P&quot; that is &quot;independent&quot; of whether &quot;A&quot; is inside or outside &quot;P&quot;.

Consider a circle &quot;P&quot; with center &quot;O&quot; and a point &quot;A&quot; which may lie inside or outside the circle &quot;P&quot;.
* Take the intersection point &quot;C&quot; of the ray &quot;OA&quot; with the circle &quot;P&quot;.
* Connect the point &quot;C&quot; with an arbitrary point &quot;B&quot; on the circle &quot;P&quot; (different from &quot;C&quot; and from the point on &quot;P&quot; antipodal to &quot;C&quot;)
* Let &quot;h&quot; be the reflection of ray &quot;BA&quot; in line &quot;BC&quot;. Then &quot;h&quot; cuts ray &quot;OC&quot; in a point &quot;A″&quot;. &quot;A″&quot; is the inverse point of &quot;A&quot; with respect to circle &quot;P&quot;.

=== Properties ===
The inversion of a set of points in the plane with respect to a circle is the set of inverses of these points. The following properties make circle inversion useful.
*A circle that passes through the center &quot;O&quot; of the reference circle inverts to a line not passing through &quot;O&quot;, but parallel to the tangent to the original circle at &quot;O&quot;, and vice versa; whereas a line passing through &quot;O&quot; is inverted into itself (but not pointwise invariant).
*A circle not passing through &quot;O&quot; inverts to a circle not passing through &quot;O&quot;. If the circle meets the reference circle, these invariant points of intersection are also on the inverse circle. A circle (or line) is unchanged by inversion if and only if it is orthogonal to the reference circle at the points of intersection.

Additional properties include:
*If a circle &quot;q&quot; passes through two distinct points A and A&#x27; which are inverses with respect to a circle &quot;k&quot;, then the circles &quot;k&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are orthogonal.
*If the circles &quot;k&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are orthogonal, then a straight line passing through the center O of &quot;k&quot; and intersecting &quot;q&quot;, does so at inverse points with respect to &quot;k&quot;.
*Given a triangle OAB in which O is the center of a circle &quot;k&quot;, and points A&#x27; and B&#x27; inverses of A and B with respect to &quot;k&quot;, then
:: formula_2
*The points of intersection of two circles &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; orthogonal to a circle &quot;k&quot;, are inverses with respect to &quot;k&quot;.
*If M and M&#x27; are inverse points with respect to a circle &quot;k&quot; on two curves m and m&#x27;, also inverses with respect to &quot;k&quot;, then the tangents to m and m&#x27; at the points M and M&#x27; are either perpendicular to the straight line MM&#x27; or form with this line an isosceles triangle with base MM&#x27;.
*Inversion leaves the measure of angles unaltered, but reverses the orientation of oriented angles.

=== Examples in two dimensions ===

* Inversion of a line is a circle containing the center of inversion; or it is the line itself if it contains the center
* Inversion of a circle is another circle; or it is a line if the original circle contains the center 
* Inversion of a parabola is a cardioid
* Inversion of hyperbola is a lemniscate of Bernoulli

=== Application ===
For a circle not passing through the center of inversion, the center of the circle being inverted and the center of its image under inversion are collinear with the center of the reference circle. This fact can be used to prove that the Euler line of the intouch triangle of a triangle coincides with its OI line. The proof roughly goes as below:

Invert with respect to the incircle of triangle &quot;ABC&quot;. The medial triangle of the intouch triangle is inverted into triangle &quot;ABC&quot;, meaning the circumcenter of the medial triangle, that is, the nine-point center of the intouch triangle, the incenter and circumcenter of triangle &quot;ABC&quot; are collinear.

Any two non-intersecting circles may be inverted into concentric circles. Then the inversive distance (usually denoted δ) is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the radii of the two concentric circles.

In addition, any two non-intersecting circles may be inverted into congruent circles, using circle of inversion centered at a point on the circle of antisimilitude.

The Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage is a mechanical implementation of inversion in a circle. It provides an exact solution to the important problem of converting between linear and circular motion.

==== Pole and polar ====

If point &quot;R&quot; is the inverse of point &quot;P&quot; then the lines perpendicular to the line &quot;PR&quot; through one of the points is the polar of the other point (the pole).

Poles and polars have several useful properties:

* If a point P lies on a line &quot;l&quot;, then the pole L of the line &quot;l&quot; lies on the polar &quot;p&quot; of point P.
* If a point P moves along a line &quot;l&quot;, its polar &quot;p&quot; rotates about the pole L of the line &quot;l&quot;.
* If two tangent lines can be drawn from a pole to the circle, then its polar passes through both tangent points.
* If a point lies on the circle, its polar is the tangent through this point.
* If a point P lies on its own polar line, then P is on the circle.
* Each line has exactly one pole.

== In three dimensions ==


Circle inversion is generalizable to sphere inversion in three dimensions. The inversion of a point &quot;P&quot; in 3D with respect to a reference sphere centered at a point &quot;O&quot; with radius &quot;R&quot; is a point &quot;P&quot; &#x27; on the ray with direction &quot;OP&quot; such that formula_3. As with the 2D version, a sphere inverts to a sphere, except that if a sphere passes through the center &quot;O&quot; of the reference sphere, then it inverts to a plane. Any plane passing through &quot;O&quot;, inverts to a sphere touching at &quot;O&quot;. A circle, that is, the intersection of a sphere with a secant plane, inverts into a circle, except that if the circle passes through &quot;O&quot; it inverts into a line. This reduces to the 2D case when the secant plane passes through &quot;O&quot;, but is a true 3D phenomenon if the secant plane does not pass through &quot;O&quot;.

=== Examples in three dimensions ===

==== Sphere ====
The simplest surface (besides a plane) is the sphere. The first picture shows a non trivial inversion (the center of the sphere is not the center of inversion) of a sphere together with two orthogonal intersecting pencils of circles.

==== Cylinder, cone, torus ====
The inversion of a cylinder, cone, or torus results in a Dupin cyclide.

==== Spheroid ====
A spheroid is a surface of revolution and contains a pencil of circles which is mapped onto a pencil of circles (see picture). The inverse image of a spheroid is a surface of degree 4.

==== Hyperboloid of one sheet ====
A hyperboloid of one sheet, which is a surface of revolution contains a pencil of circles which is mapped onto a pencil of circles. A hyperboloid of one sheet contains additional two pencils of lines, which are mapped onto pencils of circles. The picture shows one such line (blue) and its inversion.

=== Stereographic projection as the inversion of a sphere ===

A stereographic projection usually projects a sphere from a point formula_4 (north pole) of the sphere onto the tangent plane at the opposite point formula_5 (south pole). This mapping can be performed by an inversion of the sphere onto its tangent plane. If the sphere (to be projected) has the equation formula_6 (alternately written formula_7; center formula_8, radius formula_9, green in the picture), then it will be mapped by the inversion at the unit sphere (red) onto the tangent plane at point formula_10. The lines through the center of inversion (point formula_4) are mapped onto themselves. They are the projection lines of the stereographic projection.

=== 6-sphere coordinates ===
The 6-sphere coordinates are a coordinate system for three-dimensional space obtained by inverting the Cartesian coordinates.

== Axiomatics and generalization ==
One of the first to consider foundations of inversive geometry was Mario Pieri in 1911 and 1912. Edward Kasner wrote his thesis on &quot;Invariant theory of the inversion group&quot;.

More recently the mathematical structure of inversive geometry has been interpreted as an incidence structure where the generalized circles are called &quot;blocks&quot;: In incidence geometry, any affine plane together with a single point at infinity forms a Möbius plane, also known as an &quot;inversive plane&quot;. The point at infinity is added to all the lines. These Möbius planes can be described axiomatically and exist in both finite and infinite versions.

A model for the Möbius plane that comes from the Euclidean plane is the Riemann sphere.

== Invariant ==
The cross-ratio between 4 points formula_12 is invariant under an inversion. In particular if O is the centre of the inversion and formula_13 and formula_14 are distances to the ends of a line L, then length of the line formula_15 will become formula_16 under an inversion with radius 1. The invariant is:

:formula_17

== Relation to Erlangen program ==
According to Coxeter, the transformation by inversion in circle was invented by L. I. Magnus in 1831. Since then this mapping has become an avenue to higher mathematics. Through some steps of application of the circle inversion map, a student of transformation geometry soon appreciates the significance of Felix Klein&#x27;s Erlangen program, an outgrowth of certain models of hyperbolic geometry.

=== Dilation ===
The combination of two inversions in concentric circles results in a similarity, homothetic transformation, or dilation characterized by the ratio of the circle radii.

:formula_18.

When formula_19 the equation for formula_20 becomes

: formula_21

=== Higher geometry ===
As mentioned above, zero, the origin, requires special consideration in the circle inversion mapping. The approach is to adjoin a point at infinity designated ∞ or 1/0 . In the complex number approach, where reciprocation is the apparent operation, this procedure leads to the complex projective line, often called the Riemann sphere. It was subspaces and subgroups of this space and group of mappings that were applied to produce early models of hyperbolic geometry by Beltrami, Cayley, and Klein. Thus inversive geometry includes the ideas originated by Lobachevsky and Bolyai in their plane geometry. Furthermore, Felix Klein was so overcome by this facility of mappings to identify geometrical phenomena that he delivered a manifesto, the Erlangen program, in 1872. Since then many mathematicians reserve the term &quot;geometry&quot; for a space together with a group of mappings of that space. The significant properties of figures in the geometry are those that are invariant under this group.

For example, Smogorzhevsky develops several theorems of inversive geometry before beginning Lobachevskian geometry.

== In higher dimensions ==
In a real &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space, an inversion in the sphere of radius centered at the point formula_22 is a map of an arbitrary point formula_23 found by inverting the length of the displacement vector formula_24 and multiplying by 

:formula_25

The transformation by inversion in hyperplanes or hyperspheres in E&quot;n&quot; can be used to generate dilations, translations, or rotations. Indeed, two concentric hyperspheres, used to produce successive inversions, result in a dilation or homothety about the hyperspheres&#x27; center.

When two parallel hyperplanes are used to produce successive reflections, the result is a translation. When two hyperplanes intersect in an (&quot;n&quot;–2)-flat, successive reflections produce a rotation where every point of the (&quot;n&quot;–2)-flat is a fixed point of each reflection and thus of the composition.

Any combination of reflections, translations, and rotations is called an isometry. Any combination of reflections, dilations, translations, and rotations is a similarity.

All of these are conformal maps, and in fact, where the space has three or more dimensions, the mappings generated by inversion are the only conformal mappings. Liouville&#x27;s theorem is a classical theorem of conformal geometry.

The addition of a point at infinity to the space obviates the distinction between hyperplane and hypersphere; higher dimensional inversive geometry is frequently studied then in the presumed context of an &quot;n&quot;-sphere as the base space. The transformations of inversive geometry are often referred to as Möbius transformations. Inversive geometry has been applied to the study of colorings, or partitionings, of an &quot;n&quot;-sphere.

== Anticonformal mapping property ==
The circle inversion map is anticonformal, which means that at every point it preserves angles and reverses orientation (a map is called conformal if it preserves &quot;oriented&quot; angles). Algebraically, a map is anticonformal if at every point the Jacobian is a scalar times an orthogonal matrix with negative determinant: in two dimensions the Jacobian must be a scalar times a reflection at every point. This means that if &quot;J&quot; is the Jacobian, then formula_26 and formula_27 Computing the Jacobian in the case , where gives , with , and additionally det(&quot;J&quot;) is negative; hence the inversive map is anticonformal.

In the complex plane, the most obvious circle inversion map (i.e., using the unit circle centered at the origin) is the complex conjugate of the complex inverse map taking &quot;z&quot; to 1/&quot;z&quot;. The complex analytic inverse map is conformal and its conjugate, circle inversion, is anticonformal.
In this case a homography is conformal while an anti-homography is anticonformal.

== Inversive geometry and hyperbolic geometry ==
The (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-sphere with equation

:formula_28

will have a positive radius if &quot;a&quot;12 + ... + &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;2 is greater than &quot;c&quot;, and on inversion gives the sphere

:formula_29

Hence, it will be invariant under inversion if and only if &quot;c&quot; = 1. But this is the condition of being orthogonal to the unit sphere. Hence we are led to consider the (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-spheres with equation

:formula_30

which are invariant under inversion, orthogonal to the unit sphere, and have centers outside of the sphere. These together with the subspace hyperplanes separating hemispheres are the hypersurfaces of the Poincaré disc model of hyperbolic geometry.

Since inversion in the unit sphere leaves the spheres orthogonal to it invariant, the inversion maps the points inside the unit sphere to the outside and vice versa. This is therefore true in general of orthogonal spheres, and in particular inversion in one of the spheres orthogonal to the unit sphere maps the unit sphere to itself. It also maps the interior of the unit sphere to itself, with points outside the orthogonal sphere mapping inside, and vice versa; this defines the reflections of the Poincaré disc model if we also include with them the reflections through the diameters separating hemispheres of the unit sphere. These reflections generate the group of isometries of the model, which tells us that the isometries are conformal. Hence, the angle between two curves in the model is the same as the angle between two curves in the hyperbolic space.

<text>Paul Keres (; 7 January 1916 – 5 June 1975) was an Estonian chess grandmaster and chess writer. He was among the world&#x27;s top players from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s, and narrowly missed a chance at a World Chess Championship match on five occasions. As Estonia was repeatedly invaded and occupied during World War II, Keres was forced by the circumstances to represent the Soviet Union (1940–41, 1944–75) and Nazi Germany (1941–44) in international tournaments.

Keres won the AVRO 1938 chess tournament, which led to negotiations for a title match against the reigning World Champion Alexander Alekhine, but the match never took place due to the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Keres was runner-up in the Candidates Tournament on four consecutive occasions in 1953–1962. Due to these and other strong results, many chess historians consider Keres one of the greatest &quot;Super grandmasters&quot; in history, and, along with Viktor Korchnoi, the strongest player never to become world champion.

Widely considered an Estonian national hero, he was nicknamed &quot;Paul the Second&quot;, &quot;The Eternal Second&quot;, and &quot;The Crown Prince of Chess&quot;.

==Early life==
Keres was born in the town of Narva (now in Estonia), then Petrograd Governorate of the Russian Empire to parents Peeter and Marie Keres (&quot;née&quot; Lämmergas). He was two years old when Estonia became an independent country in 1918. 

Keres grew up in Pärnu, Estonia. He first learned about chess from his father and his elder brother Harald (afterwards a prominent physicist, who later told friendly jokes to his students: &quot;I am not Paul&#x27;s brother; Paul is my brother&quot;). With the scarcity of chess literature in his home town, he learned about chess notation from the chess puzzles in the daily newspaper, and compiled a handwritten collection of almost 1000 games. In his early days, he was known for a brilliant and sharp attacking style.

==In independent Estonia==
Keres was a three-time schoolboy champion of the country, in 1930, 1932, and 1933. His playing matured after playing correspondence chess extensively while in high school. He probably played about 500 correspondence games, and at one stage had 150 correspondence games going simultaneously. In 1935, he won the Internationaler Fernschachbund (IFSB) international correspondence chess championship. From 1937 to 1941 he studied mathematics at the University of Tartu, and competed in several interuniversity matches.
Keres achieved a very good result at the age of 17 in a Master tournament in Tallinn 1933 with 5/7 (+5−2=0), tied 3rd–4th, half a point behind joint winners Paul Felix Schmidt and V. Kappe. Keres became champion of Estonia for the first time in 1935. He tied for first (+5−2=1) with Gunnar Friedemann in the tournament, then defeated him (+2−1=0) in the playoff match. In April 1935, Keres defeated Feliks Kibbermann, one of Tartu&#x27;s leading masters, in a training match, by (+3−1=0).

Keres played on for Estonia in the 6th Chess Olympiad at Warsaw 1935, and was regarded as the new star, admired for his dashing style. His success there gave him the confidence to venture onto the international circuit.

At Helsinki 1935, he placed 2nd behind Paulin Frydman with 6½/8 (+6−1=1). He won in Tallinn 1936 with 9/10 (+8−0=2). Keres&#x27; first major international success against top-level competition came at Bad Nauheim 1936, where he tied for first with Alexander Alekhine at 6½/9 (+4−0=5). He struggled at Dresden 1936, placing only 8–9th with (+2−4=3), but wrote that he learned an important lesson from this setback. Keres recovered at Zandvoort 1936 with a shared 3rd–4th place (+5−3=3). He then defended his Estonian title in 1936 by drawing a challenge match against Paul Felix Schmidt with (+3−3=1).

Keres had a series of successes in 1937. He won in Tallinn with 7½/9 (+6−0=3), then shared 1st–2nd at Margate with Reuben Fine at 7½/9 (+6−0=3), 1½ points ahead of Alekhine. In Ostend, he tied 1st–3rd places with Fine and Henry Grob at 6/9 (+5−2=2). Keres dominated in Prague to claim first with 10/11 (+9−0=2). He then won a theme tournament in Vienna with 4½/6 (+4−1=1); the tournament saw all games commence with the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 Ne4, known as the Döry Defence. He tied for 4–5th places at Kemeri with 11½/17 (+8−2=7), as Salo Flohr, Vladimirs Petrovs and Samuel Reshevsky won. Then he tied 2nd–4th in Pärnu with 4½/7 (+3−1=3).

This successful string earned him an invitation to the tournament at Semmering–Baden 1937, which he won with 9/14 (+6−2=6), ahead of Fine, José Raúl Capablanca, Reshevsky, and Erich Eliskases. Keres, in his autobiographical games collection, refers to this major event as a &#x27;Candidates&#x27; Tournament&#x27;, and claimed that he was recognized as a Grandmaster after winning it, although its parallel connection with later FIDE-organized Candidates&#x27; tournaments (from 1950 onwards) is not exact, and the Grandmaster title was not formalized by FIDE until 1950.

Keres tied for second at Hastings 1937–38 with 6½/9 (+4−0=5) (half a point behind Reshevsky), and at Noordwijk 1938 (behind Eliskases) with 6½/9 (+4−0=5). Keres drew an exhibition match at Stockholm 1938 with Gideon Ståhlberg on 4–4 (+2−2=4).

He continued to represent Estonia with success in Olympiad play. His detailed results for Estonia follow. Of note was the team bronze medal attained by Estonia in 1939; this was exceptional for a country with a population of less than two million people.
* Warsaw 1935, Estonia board 1, 12½/19 (+11−5=3);
* Munich 1936 (unofficial Olympiad), Estonia board 1, 15½/20 (+12−1=7), board gold medal;
* Stockholm 1937, Estonia board 1, 11/15 (+9−2=4), board silver medal;
* Buenos Aires 1939, Estonia board 1, 14½/19 (+12−2=5), team bronze medal.

==World Championship match denied==

In 1938, he tied with Fine for first, with 8½/14, in the all-star AVRO tournament, held in various cities in the Netherlands, ahead of chess legends Mikhail Botvinnik, Max Euwe, Reshevsky, Alekhine, Capablanca and Flohr. AVRO was one of the strongest tournaments in history; some chess historians believe it the strongest ever staged. Keres won on tiebreak because he beat Fine 1½–½ in their individual two games.

It was expected that the winner of this tournament would be the challenger for the World Chess Championship, in a match against World Champion Alexander Alekhine, but the outbreak of the Second World War, especially because of the first occupation of Estonia by the Soviet Union in 1940–41, brought negotiations with Alekhine to an end. Keres had begun his university studies in 1937, and this also played a role in the failure to set up a match.

Keres struggled at Leningrad–Moscow 1939 with a shared 12–13th place; he wrote that he had not had enough time to prepare for this very strong event, where he faced many Soviet top players for the first time. But he recovered with more preparation time, and won Margate 1939 with 7½/9 (+6−0=3), ahead of Capablanca and Flohr.
==World War II==
During World War II, the previously independent nation of Estonia was invaded and occupied by the Stalinist Soviet Union in June 1940. This lasted until the 1941 invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany, which in turn lasted until the Soviet Union reoccupied Estonia in 1944. The country remained under Soviet control for the rest of Keres&#x27; life. The 1944 Soviet reconquest of Estonia was a particularly dangerous time for Keres.

At the outbreak of WWII in 1939, Keres was in Buenos Aires, Argentina for the Olympiad. He stayed on to play in a Buenos Aires international tournament after the Olympiad, and tied for first place with Miguel Najdorf with 8½/11 (+7−1=3).

His next event was a 14-game match with former World Champion Max Euwe in the Netherlands, held from December 1939 – January 1940. Keres won a hard-fought struggle by 7½–6½ (+6−5=3). This was a superb achievement, because not only was Euwe a former World Champion, but he had enormous experience at match play, far more than Keres.

===First Soviet occupation (1940–41)===
Estonia was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Red Army in June 1940, and formally annexed by the USSR in August 1940. Keres played in his first Soviet Championship at Moscow 1940 (URS-ch12), placing fourth (+9−4=6) in an exceptionally strong field, placing him ahead of the defending champion Mikhail Botvinnik, among others. The USSR Chess Federation organized the &quot;Absolute Championship of the USSR&quot; in 1941, with the top six finishers from the 1940 championship meeting each other four times; it was split between Leningrad and Moscow. Botvinnik won the event, one of the strongest ever organized, with 13½/20, and Keres placed second with 11, ahead of Vasily Smyslov, Isaac Boleslavsky, Andor Lilienthal, and Igor Bondarevsky.

In 1941, Keres graduated from the University of Tartu and the same year, married fellow student Maria Riives. The couple had two children; a son, Peeter (born in 1941), and a daughter, Kadrin (born in 1943). Both children were born while Estonia was under occupation.

===German occupation (1941–44)===
After Nazi Germany had invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Estonia came under German control a few weeks later. During 1942 and 1943, Keres and Alekhine both played in four tournaments organized by Ehrhardt Post, President of the &quot;Grossdeutscher Schachbund&quot;. Alekhine won at the Salzburg 1942 chess tournament (Six Grandmasters&#x27; Tournament) in June 1942, at Munich (European Individual Chess Championship) in September 1942, and at Prague (International Tournament) in April 1943, always ahead of Keres, who placed second in all three of those tournaments. They tied for first at Salzburg (Six Grandmasters&#x27; Tournament) in June 1943, with 7½/10.

During World War II, Keres played in several more chess tournaments. He won all 15 games at Tallinn 1942 (Estonian championship), and swept all five games at Posen 1943. He also won the Estonian title event held at Tallinn 1943, and Madrid 1944 (13/14, +12−0=2). He was second, behind Stig Lundholm, at Lidköping 1944 (playing hors concours in the Swedish Championship). Keres won a match with Folke Ekström at Stockholm in 1944 by 5–1 (+4−0=2).

As resident of German-occupied Estonia (then part of &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot;) in 1941–1944, Keres was able to travel across the European continent and participate in a number of international tournaments, held both in neutral countries (1944 Madrid, Lidköping, Stockholm) and in countries under Nazi German control (1942 Tallinn, Salzburg, Munich; 1943 Prague, Posen, Salzburg, Tallinn).

===Second Soviet occupation (after 1944)===
Before the Soviet Union reoccupied Estonia, in the autumn of 1944 Keres made an unsuccessful attempt to escape from the country over the sea to the west. A 1942 newspaper interview with Keres was later used by the Nazis for anti-Soviet propaganda. As a consequence, he was suspected of collaboration with the Nazis and questioned by the Soviet authorities. Keres managed to avoid deportation or any worse fate (e.g., that of Vladimirs Petrovs); however, he may have been held in detention; precise details are difficult to ascertain.

But his return to the international chess scene was delayed, in spite of his excellent form; he won at Riga 1944/45 (Baltic Championship) (10½/11). Presumably for political reasons, he was excluded from the ten-player Soviet team for the 1945 radio match against the US, and he did not participate in the first great post-war tournament at the 1946 Groningen tournament which was won by Botvinnik, just ahead of Euwe and Smyslov.

He won the Estonian Championship at Tallinn 1945 with 13/15 (+11−0=4), ahead of several strong visiting Soviets, including Alexander Kotov, Alexander Tolush, Lilienthal, and Flohr. He then won at Tbilisi 1946 (hors concours in the Georgian Championship) with a near-perfect score of 18/19, ahead of Vladas Mikėnas and a 16-year-old Tigran Petrosian.

Keres returned to international play in 1946 in the Soviet radio match against Great Britain, and continued his excellent playing form that year and the next year.

==World Championship Candidate (1948–1965)==
Although Keres participated in the 1948 World Championship tournament, arranged to determine the world champion after Alekhine&#x27;s death in 1946, his performance was far from his best. Held jointly in The Hague and Moscow, the tournament was limited to five participants: Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov, Paul Keres, Samuel Reshevsky, and Max Euwe. (Reuben Fine had also been invited but declined.) The event was played as a quintuple round-robin. Keres finished joint third, with 10½ out of 20 points. In his individual match with the winner, Botvinnik, he lost four of five games, winning only in the last round when the tournament&#x27;s result was already determined.

Since Keres lost his first four games against Botvinnik in the 1948 tournament, suspicions have sometimes been raised that Keres was forced to &quot;throw&quot; games to allow Botvinnik to win the championship. Chess historian Taylor Kingston investigated the available evidence and arguments, concluded that Soviet chess officials had given Keres &quot;strong hints&quot; that he should not hinder Botvinnik&#x27;s attempt to win the World Championship, and that Botvinnik only discovered this about halfway through the tournament and reportedly protested so strongly that he angered Soviet officials; and that Keres, in Kingston&#x27;s assessment, probably did not deliberately lose games to Botvinnik or anyone else in the tournament.

Keres finished second or equal second in four straight Candidates&#x27; tournaments (1953, 1956, 1959, 1962), making him the player with the most runner-up finishes in that event. (He was therefore occasionally nicknamed &quot;Paul II&quot;.) Keres participated in a total of six Candidates&#x27; Tournaments:
* Budapest 1950, 4th, behind David Bronstein and Isaac Boleslavsky, with 9½/18 (+3−2=13).
* Zürich 1953, tied 2nd–4th, along with David Bronstein and Reshevsky, two points behind Smyslov, with 16/28 (+8−4=16).
* Amsterdam 1956, 2nd, 1½ points behind Smyslov, with 10/18 (+3−1=14).
* Yugoslavia 1959, 2nd, 1½ points behind Mikhail Tal, with 18½/28 (+15−6=7). He had positive or equal scores against all the competitors, including 3–1 against Tal, but this was not enough, since Tal scored 14½/16 against the bottom four finishers.
* Curaçao 1962, tied 2nd–3rd, with Efim Geller, half a point behind Tigran Petrosian, with 17/27 (+9−2=16). This event is discussed further at World Chess Championship 1963. Keres won a match at Moscow 1962 against Geller, for an exempt place in the 1965 Candidates, by 4½–3½ (+2−1=5).
* Riga 1965, lost his quarter-final match to eventual Candidates&#x27; winner Boris Spassky by 6–4 (+2−4=4). This was the only match loss of Keres&#x27; long career.

Keres&#x27; run of four successive second places in Candidates&#x27; tournaments (1953, 1956, 1959, 1962) has prompted suspicions that he was under orders not to win these events. Taylor Kingston concludes that: there was probably no pressure from Soviet officials, since from 1954 onwards, Keres was rehabilitated and Botvinnik was no longer in favour with officials. At Curaçao 1962, there was an &quot;unofficial&quot; conspiracy by Petrosian, Geller and Keres, and this worked out to Keres&#x27; disadvantage, since he may have been slightly stronger than both Petrosian and Geller at this stage.
Bronstein, in his final book, published just after his death in late 2006, wrote that the Soviet chess leadership favoured Smyslov to win Zurich 1953, and pressured several of the other top Soviets to arrange this outcome, which did in fact occur. Bronstein wrote that Keres was ordered to draw his second cycle game with Smyslov, to conserve Smyslov&#x27;s fading physical strength; Keres, who still had his own hopes of winning the event, tried as White to win an attacking game, but instead lost because of Smyslov&#x27;s excellent play.

==Three-time champion of USSR==

In several other post-war events, however, Keres dominated the field. He won the exceptionally strong USSR Chess Championship three times. In 1947, he won at Leningrad, URS-ch15, with 14/19 (+10−1=8); the field included every top Soviet player except Botvinnik. In 1950, he won at Moscow, URS-ch18, with 11½/17 (+8−2=7) against a field which was only slightly weaker than in 1947. Then in 1951, he triumphed again at Moscow, URS-ch19, with 12/17 (+9−2=6), against a super-class field which included Efim Geller, Petrosian, Smyslov, Botvinnik, Yuri Averbakh, David Bronstein, Mark Taimanov, Lev Aronin, Salo Flohr, Igor Bondarevsky, and Alexander Kotov.

Keres won Pärnu 1947 with 9½/13 (+7−1=5), Szczawno-Zdrój 1950 with 14½/19 (+11−1=7), and Budapest 1952 with 12½/17 (+10−2=5), the latter ahead of world champion Botvinnik and an all-star field which included Geller, Smyslov, Gideon Ståhlberg, László Szabo, and Petrosian. The Budapest victory, which capped a stretch of four first-class wins over a two-year span, may represent the peak of his career. The Hungarian master and writer Egon Varnusz, in his books on Keres, states that at this time, &quot;The best player in the world was Paul Keres&quot;.

==International team successes==
Keres represented the Soviet Union in seven consecutive Olympiads, winning seven consecutive team gold medals, five board gold medals, and one bronze board medal. Of note was his appearance on for the USSR in 1952, when the Soviets entered the event for the first time; Keres was the only Soviet team member with Olympiad experience (from his previous appearances for Estonia), and world champion Mikhail Botvinnik was not on the Soviet team. His four straight board gold medals from 1954–1960 is an Olympiad record. Although not selected after 1964, Keres served successfully as a team trainer with Soviet international teams for the next decade. Altogether, in 11 Olympiads, playing for both the USSR and Estonia (counting the unofficial Munich 1936 event), and in 161 games, Keres accumulated a brilliant total of (+97−13=51), for 76.1%. His detailed 1952–1964 Olympiad results are:

Keres also represented the USSR in many international team matches, in Europe and the Americas, with great success. He represented Estonia on top board with distinction in Soviet team championships, contested between regions.

==Later career==

Beginning with the Pärnu 1947 tournament, Keres made some significant contributions as a chess organizer in Estonia; this is an often overlooked aspect of his career.

Keres continued to play exceptionally well on the international circuit. He tied 1st–2nd at Hastings 1954–55 with Smyslov on 7/9 (+6−1=2). He dominated an internal Soviet training tournament at Pärnu 1955 with 9½/10. Keres placed 2nd at the 1955 Gothenburg Interzonal, behind David Bronstein, with 13½/20. Keres defeated Wolfgang Unzicker in a 1956 exhibition match at Hamburg by 6–2 (+4−0=4). He tied 2nd–3rd in the USSR Championship, Moscow 1957 (URS-ch24) with 13½/21 (+8−2=11), along with Bronstein, behind Mikhail Tal. Keres won Mar del Plata 1957 (15/17, ahead of Miguel Najdorf), and Santiago 1957 with 6/7, ahead of Alexander Kotov. He won Hastings 1957–58 (7½/9, ahead of Svetozar Gligorić). He was tied 3rd–4th at Zurich 1959, at 10½/15, along with Bobby Fischer, behind Tal and Gligorić. He placed tied 7–8th in the USSR Championship, Tbilisi 1959 (URS-ch26) with 10½/19, as Petrosian won. Keres was third at Stockholm 1959–60 with 7/9. He won at Pärnu 1960 with 12/15. He was the champion at Zurich 1961 (9/11, ahead of Petrosian). At the elite Bled 1961 event, Keres shared 3rd–5th places, on 12½/19 (+7−1=11), behind Mikhail Tal and Bobby Fischer. In the USSR Championship, Baku 1961 (URS-ch29), Keres scored 11/20 for a shared 8–11th place, as Boris Spassky won. Keres shared first with World Champion Tigran Petrosian at the very strong 1963 Piatigorsky Cup in Los Angeles with 8½/14.

Further tournament championships followed. He won Beverwijk 1964, with 11½/15, tied with Iivo Nei. He shared first place with World Champion Tigran Petrosian at Buenos Aires 1964, with 12½/17.
He won at Hastings 1964–65 with 8/9. He shared 1st–2nd places at Mariánské Lázně 1965 on 11/15 with Vlastimil Hort. In the USSR Championship at Tallinn 1965 (URS-ch33), he scored 11/19 for 6th place, as Leonid Stein won. He won at Stockholm 1966–67 with 7/9. At Winnipeg 1967, he shared 3rd–4th places on 5½/9 as Bent Larsen and Klaus Darga won.

At Bamberg 1968, he won with 12/15, two points ahead of World Champion Tigran Petrosian. He was 2nd at Luhacovice 1969 with 10½/15, behind Viktor Korchnoi. At Tallinn 1969, he shared 2nd–3rd places on 9/13 as Stein won. At Wijk aan Zee 1969, he shared 3rd–4th places on 10½/15, as Geller and Botvinnik won. He won Budapest 1970 with 10/15, ahead of Laszlo Szabo. Also in 1970, Keres&#x27;s 3:1 win over Ivkov on the tenth board gave victory to the Soviet team in the match vs Rest of the World. He shared 1st–2nd at Tallinn 1971 with Mikhail Tal on 11½/15. He shared 2nd–3rd at Pärnu 1971, on 9½/13, as Stein won. He shared 2nd–4th at Amsterdam 1971 with 9/13, as Smyslov won. He shared 3rd–5th places at Sarajevo 1972 on 9½/15, as Szabo won. He placed 5th at San Antonio 1972 on 9½/15, as Petrosian, Lajos Portisch, and Anatoly Karpov won.

At Tallinn 1973, he shared 3rd–6th places on 9/15, as Mikhail Tal won. His last Interzonal was Petropolis 1973, where he scored 8/17 for a shared 12–13th place, as Henrique Mecking won. That same year, he made his last Soviet Championship appearance, at Moscow for URS-ch41, scoring 8/17 for a shared 9–12th place, as Spassky won.

==Death==

Keres&#x27; health declined the next year, and he did not play any major events in 1974. His last major tournament win was Tallinn 1975, ahead of Spassky and Friðrik Ólafsson, just a few months before his death.

Keres died of a heart attack in Helsinki, Finland, at the age of 59 (it is often erroneously reported that he died on the same date in Vancouver, Canada). His death occurred while returning to Estonia from a tournament in Vancouver, which he had won. He was buried at Metsakalmistu cemetery in Tallinn. The Paul Keres Memorial Tournaments have been held annually mainly in Vancouver and Tallinn ever since.

Over 100,000 were in attendance at Keres&#x27; funeral in Tallinn, Estonia; and FIDE President Max Euwe, his old friend and rival, was also present.

==Memory and memorials==

A statue honouring him is located in Tõnismägi, Tallinn. A bronze statue of Keres was unveiled on his 100th birthday in his hometown Narva on 7 January 2016. Streets in Nõmme, a district of Tallinn, in Narva and Pärnu are named after him.

An annual international chess tournament has been held in Tallinn every other year since 1969. Keres won this tournament in 1971 and 1975. Starting in 1976 after Keres&#x27; death, it has been called the Paul Keres Memorial Tournament. There are also the annual Keres Memorial tournament held in
Vancouver and a number of chess clubs and festivals named after him.

In 2000, Keres was elected the Estonian Sportsman of the Century.

The World Chess Federation named 2016 as &quot;The Year of Paul Keres&quot;.

==Legacy and writings==
The unofficial Chessmetrics system places Keres in the top 10 players in the world between approximately 1936 and 1965, and overall he had one of the highest winning percentages of all grandmasters in history. He has the seventh highest Chessmetrics 20-year average, from 1944 to 1963, behind five World Champions and Victor Korchnoi.
He was one of few players to have plus records against Capablanca, Euwe and Tal, and he also had equal records against Smyslov, Petrosian and Anatoly Karpov. In his long career, he played 10 world champions. He won at least one game against all from Capablanca to Bobby Fischer (his two games with Karpov were drawn), making him one of only three players to beat nine undisputed world champions (the other two are Victor Korchnoi and Alexander Beliavsky). Other notable grandmasters against whom he had plus records include Fine, Flohr, Viktor Korchnoi, Efim Geller, Savielly Tartakower, Mark Taimanov, Milan Vidmar, Svetozar Gligorić, Isaac Boleslavsky, Efim Bogoljubov and Bent Larsen.

He wrote chess books that included a well-regarded, deeply annotated collection of his best games, &quot;Grandmaster of Chess&quot; , &quot;The Art of the Middle Game&quot; (with Alexander Kotov) , and &quot;Practical Chess Endings&quot; . All three books are still considered among the best of their kind for aspiring masters and experts. He also wrote several tournament books, including an account of the 1948 World Championship Match Tournament. He authored several openings treatises, often in German: &quot;Spanisch bis Französisch&quot;, &quot;Dreispringer bis Königsgambit&quot; , and &quot;Vierspringer bis Spanisch&quot;. He contributed to the first volume, &#x27;C&#x27;, of the first edition of the Yugoslav-published &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; (&quot;ECO&quot;), which appeared in 1974. Keres also co-founded the Riga magazine &quot;Shakhmaty&quot;.

Keres made many important contributions to opening theory. Perhaps best-known is the Keres Attack against the Scheveningen Variation of the Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.g4), which was successfully introduced against Efim Bogolyubov at Salzburg 1943, and remains an important line. An original system on the Black side of the Closed Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 Na5 10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 Nd7) was introduced by Keres at the 1962 Candidates&#x27; tournament, and was popular for several years. He also popularized the Keres Defence (1.d4 e6 2.c4 Bb4+) and a system on the Black side of the English Opening that runs 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.g3 c6.

Keres published 180 problems and 30 studies, including a rook ending that won a first prize in 1947.&quot;

Keres won top-class tournaments from the mid-1930s into the mid-1970s, a span of 40 years, and won major events in western Europe, eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, South America, and North America. Botvinnik, by contrast, never competed in the Americas during his career.

His rival Samuel Reshevsky said that Keres failed to become world champion because he lacked a killer instinct and &quot;was too mild a person to give his all in order to defeat his opponents. He took everything, including his chess, philosophically. Keres is one of the nicest people that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. With his friendly and sincere smile, he makes friends easily. He is goodnatured and kind. Yes, he loves chess, but being a human being is his first consideration. In addition to chess, Keres was interested in tennis, ping-pong, swimming, and bridge.&quot;

==Notable games==
*Keres vs. Alexander Alekhine, Margate 1937, Ruy Lopez, Modern Steinitz Defence (C71), . Here Keres outplayed Alekhine already in the first 15 moves. The game is crowned by two small combinations.
*Keres vs. José Raúl Capablanca, AVRO Amsterdam 1938, French Defence, Tarrasch Variation (C09), 1–0. Almost unpredictable jumps of the white knight slowly destroy Black&#x27;s position. A beautiful game.
*Max Euwe vs. Keres, Amsterdam 1940 (match), Queen&#x27;s Indian Defence, Old main line (E19), . Black reveals a series of brilliant tactical surprise moves, concluding elegantly against the former world champion.
*Keres vs. Jaroslav Šajtar, Amsterdam 1954 (ol), Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation (B94), 1–0. A typical Sicilian sacrifice on e6 leads to swift .
*Keres vs. Mikhail Botvinnik, Moscow 1956 (Alekhine Memorial), Sicilian Defence, Classical Variation, Richter–Rauzer Attack (B63), 1–0. Keres had a minus score against Botvinnik, but here he defeats the world champion in convincing style.
*Keres vs. Edgar Walther, Tel Aviv 1964, King&#x27;s Indian Defence, Petrosian Variation, Keres Variation (E93), 1–0. The game in which Keres introduced a new plan against the King&#x27;s Indian: Bg5, h4, Nh2 and a sacrifice on g4.

<text>The All Species Foundation (stylized as ALL Species Foundation) was an organization aiming to catalog all species on Earth by 2025 through their All Species Inventory initiative. The project was launched in 2000 by Kevin Kelly, Stewart Brand and Ryan Phelan. Along with other similar efforts, the All Species Foundation was promoted as an important step forward in expanding, modernizing and digitizing the field of taxonomy. The Foundation started with a large grant from the Schlinger Foundation but had difficulty finding continued funding. In 2007 the project ceased activity and &quot;[handed] off [its] mission to the Encyclopedia of Life&quot;.

The All Species Foundation received some critique for its approach to defining and identifying species. An open letter expressed concern over the species problem, a fundamental issue in taxonomy of what exactly defines a species. The letter argued that failing to acknowledge and account for this fundamental issue could undermine the use of the database for conservation and biodiversity preservation.

<text>Sangir Besar, commonly called Sangir Island (with the spelling variants &quot;Sangihe&quot;, &quot;Sanghir&quot; or &quot;Sangi&quot;), is an island in the Sangir Islands group. Its Indonesian name literally means &quot;Great Sangir&quot;, in reference to the fact that it is the archipelago&#x27;s main island. It is part of the North Sulawesi province. The main language is the Sangir language.

It was the scene of the violent eruption of Gunung Awu volcano on 2 March 1856. The existing mountain was reshaped by the eruption, and flooding was extensive. The death toll was estimated to exceed two thousand, possibly as high as 6,000. Other major eruptions occurred in 1966 and 2004.

The critically endangered cerulean flycatcher and Sangihe whistler are endemic to Sangir Island as is the endangered Elegant Sunbird .

<text>A catechism (; from , &quot;to teach orally&quot;) is a summary or exposition of doctrine and serves as a learning introduction to the Sacraments traditionally used in catechesis, or Christian religious teaching of children and adult converts. Catechisms are doctrinal manuals – often in the form of questions followed by answers to be memorised – a format that has been used in non-religious or secular contexts as well. 

The term &quot;catechumen&quot; refers to the designated recipient of the catechetical work or instruction. In the Catholic Church, catechumens are those who are preparing to receive the Sacrament of Baptism. Traditionally, they would be placed separately during Holy Mass from those who had been baptized, and would be dismissed from the liturgical assembly before the Profession of Faith (Nicene Creed) and General Intercessions (Prayers of the Faithful).

Catechisms are characteristic of Western Christianity but are also present in Eastern Christianity. In 1973, &quot;The Common Catechism&quot;, the first joint catechism of Catholics and Protestants, was published by theologians of the major Western Christian traditions, as a result of extensive ecumenical dialogue.

==Format==
Before the Protestant Reformation, Christian catechesis took the form of instruction in and memorization of the prayers and texts needed to participate in Christian liturgies: the Apostles&#x27; Creed, Lord&#x27;s Prayer, Hail Mary and a fundamental understanding of the sacraments and of Faith, Hope and Charity. Catholic religious education was often directed to encouraging discipleship, such as the Acts of Bodily Mercy and of Spiritual Mercy, etc. more than being a detailed treatment of doctrine.

There were also more comprehensive documents that outlined the theology of the Christian faith, such as the Catechetical Lectures of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, &quot;The Morals&quot; of St. Basil of Caesarea, and the Enchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love by St. Augustine of Hippo. The earliest known catechism is the Didache, which was written between 60 and 85 AD. The word &quot;catechism&quot; for a manual for this instruction appeared in the Late Middle Ages. 

The question-and-answer format calls upon two parties to participate, a master and a student (traditionally termed a &quot;scholar&quot;), or a parent and a child. The Westminster Shorter Catechism (1647) is an example:

Q. What is the chief end of man?&lt;br&gt;
A. To glorify God and enjoy Him forever!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Q. What rule hath God given to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy Him?&lt;br&gt;
A. The word of God which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments is the only rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him.

==Catholic catechisms==

There are thousands of catechisms in the Catholic tradition, with texts already appearing in print for the instruction of lay people by the early medieval period.

Only two &quot;universal&quot; catechisms have been promulgated by the popes of the Catholic Church: The &quot;Catechism of the Council of Trent&quot; (1566), written chiefly for priests, and the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; (1992), written chiefly for bishops&quot;.&quot; These remain among the most widespread among Catholics today, although the latter has been met with some controversy since its first appearance.

For Catholics, all the canonical books of the Bible (including the Deuterocanonical books), the tradition of the Church and the interpretation of these by the living Magisterium (which may be accomplished in a catechism or other mode of teaching) constitute the entire means whereby God&#x27;s revelation to mankind may be accessed. Catholics believe that sacred scripture and sacred tradition preserved and interpreted by the Magisterium are both necessary for attaining to the fullest understanding of all of God&#x27;s revelation.

The term &quot;catechist&quot; is most frequently used in Catholicism, often to describe a &quot;lay catechist&quot;, a layperson with catechetical training who engages in such teaching and evangelization. This can be in both parish church and mission contexts.

=== Notable catechisms in history ===
===Other historical catechisms===

Disputatio Puerorum Per Interrogationes Et Responsiones

Catechism by Alcuin contains questions and answers. The question is asked by a student and the teacher answers him.

Weißenburger Katechismus

Written at the end of 8th century, intended for priests in Old High German. Created in Weissenburg Abbey in Alsace. The book contains: Lord&#x27;s Prayer, form of confession, seven deadly sins, Apostles&#x27; Creed, Athanasian Creed and Gloria in excelsis Deo hymn. This catechism was created in the wake of canons prescribed by Admonitio generalis.

Elucidarium

Encyclopedic work about medieval Christian theology, originally written in the late 11th century by Honorius Augustodunensis. It was intended as a handbook for the lower and less educated clergy.

De quinque septenis seu septenariis by Hugh of Saint Victor

Work about seven deadly sins, seven petitions of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, seven virtues, and Beatitudes.

====&quot;Ignorantia sacerdotum&quot;====
&quot;Ignorantia Sacerdotum&quot; are the first words and the better-known title of &quot;De Informatione Simplicium&quot;, a catechetical manual drafted by Archbishop Pecham&#x27;s provincial Council of Lambeth in 1281. It called for the memorisation of the Apostles&#x27; Creed, the Ten Commandments, and the two-fold injunction to &quot;love the Lord thy God with all thy heart... and thy neighbour as thyself.&quot;.

It also emphasised the Seven Virtues, the Seven Deadly Sins, the Seven Sacraments, and the Seven Works of Mercy.

A 1357 translation into English is often called the Lay-Folk&#x27;s Catechism.

====The Catechetical Instructions of St. Thomas Aquinas====
The catechetical instructions of Saint Thomas Aquinas were used generally throughout the 13th and 14th centuries as manuals and textbooks for priests and teachers of religion. &quot;The Explanations of St. Thomas,&quot; wrote Spirago, &quot;are remarkable for their conciseness and their simplicity of language; they are especially noteworthy because the main parts of the catechetical course of instruction are brought into connection with one another so that they appear as one harmonious whole.&quot; The influence of these works is especially prominent in the &quot;Roman Catechism&quot; which the Council of Trent ordered written for parish priests and for all teachers of religion. Many of the explanatory passages in both works are almost identical.

====Catechism of Christian Doctrine (or &quot;Penny Catechism&quot;)====
A question-and-answer format catechism that was the standard catechetical text in Great Britain in the earlier part of the 20th century. Popularly called the &quot;Penny Catechism&quot;, as the original version only cost one penny. Various editions of the &quot;Penny Catechism&quot; were issued through the century and changes were made to the text.

==== Catechism for Filipino Catholics ====
The Catechism for Filipino Catholics (CFC) is a contextualised and inculturated Filipino Catholic catechism prepared by the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines and approved by the Holy See. The draft was produced by the Conference&#x27;s &quot;Episcopal Commission on Catechesis and Catholic Education,&quot; and is an update of the late 16th century &quot;Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espanola Y Tagala&quot;, which was a Hispano-Tagalog version of the earlier Hispano-Chinese &quot;Doctrina&quot; that was the First book of the Spanish Philippines|first book printed in the Philippines using moveable type.

The &quot;Doctrina Cristiana&quot; was written in Tagalog (both in a hispanised Latin script and the then-common indigenous Baybayin script), as well as Spanish. Amongst the contents of the &quot;Doctrina&quot; are the Spanish alphabet and phonics, basic prayers shown in both languages – in the case of the Tagalog, using archaic words and both scripts – and a brief catechism in question-and-answer format.

====&quot;Enchiridion symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum&quot;====
The &quot;Enchiridion symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum&quot;, also known as &quot;Enchiridion&quot; or &quot;Denzinger&quot;, is a compendium of all basic texts of Catholic dogma and morality since the apostles. Commissioned by Pope Pius IX, it has been in use since 1854, and has been updated periodically. It is a compendium of faith, like a catechism. By including all relevant teachings throughout history, it is at the same time, more than a catechism. It is a search instrument for theologians, historians and anybody interested in Christian religion. The latest updates of the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; extend to the teachings of Pope John Paul II.

The Archbishop of Baltimore Cardinal James Gibbons is quoted in earlier versions of the Enchiridion, that every theologian should have always two books at hand, the Holy Bible and this &quot;Enchiridion&quot;.

=== Tradivox catechism series ===
The &quot;Tradivox Catholic Catechism Index&quot; is a twenty-volume book series developed by Tradivox and published by Sophia Institute Press, consisting of reprints of more than thirty historical Catholic catechisms. When complete, it will consist of twenty cross-indexed hardcover volumes. The project has received several endorsements from prominent members of the Catholic clergy &amp; public, including Cardinal Burke, Cardinal Müller, Cardinal Pell, Bishop Strickland, Bishop Schneider, and theologian Peter Kwasniewski. As the episcopal advisor of the project, Bishop Schneider has written a foreword for each of the hardcover volumes in the series.

====Contents====
== Orthodox catechisms ==
Unlike the Catholic Church, there is no teaching Magisterium in the Orthodox world. Most catechumens are instructed orally by a deacon or priest at the church. There is emphasis on being taught by simply being in church, and listening to the services.

Most Orthodox would refer back to the original writings of the Church Fathers, including the Catechetical Lectures of St. Cyril of Jerusalem and The Ladder of Divine Ascent. New catechumens would generally be encouraged to read &quot;The Orthodox Church&quot; by Kallistos Ware to get an overview of the Christian faith from an Orthodox perspective before being given more advanced readings.

In recent times, perhaps under influence from the West, a number of catechisms have emerged in the Eastern Orthodox Church such as the Philaret Catechism, which is entitled, &quot;The Longer Catechism of The Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church,&quot; by Rev. George Mastrantonis, and the more modern &quot;The Orthodox Faith&quot; by Protopresbyter Thomas Hopko. However, presently such catechisms are not widely used.

The Oriental Orthodox Churches rely heavily on the Didascalia Apostolorum. The Ethiopic version is known as the &quot;Ethiopic Didascalia.&quot; It is included in the Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon, and is read from on Sundays. The faith of the Coptic Orthodox Church has historically been evidenced in the lives and sayings of the early desert monks, which was recorded in &quot;The paradise of the holy fathers,&quot; and . Recently the Coptic church has used Fr. Tadros Malaty&#x27;s books, along with Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria&#x27;s many books, to help lay people better understand their Coptic faith. However, like the Eastern Orthodox church, the faith is mostly expounded in the lives of the saints

and the material recited during the services.

==Protestant catechisms==

The catechism&#x27;s question-and-answer format, with a view toward the instruction of children, was a form adopted by the various Protestant confessions almost from the beginning of the Reformation.

Among the first projects of the Reformation was the production of catechisms self-consciously modelled after the older traditions of Cyril of Jerusalem and Augustine. These catechisms showed special admiration for Chrysostom&#x27;s view of the family as a &quot;little church&quot;, and placed strong responsibility on every father to teach his children, to prevent them from coming to baptism or the Lord&#x27;s table ignorant of the doctrine under which they are expected to live as Christians.

===Anglican catechisms===

The Anglican Book of Common Prayer includes a catechism. In older editions it is a brief manual for the instruction of those preparing to be brought before the bishop for confirmation: the baptised first professes his baptism, and then rehearses the principal elements of the faith into which he has been baptised: the Apostles&#x27; Creed, Ten Commandments, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, and the sacraments.

Catechist: What is your Name?
Answer: N. or M. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Catechist: Who gave you this Name? &lt;br&gt;
Answer: My Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptism; wherein I was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.
The &quot;N. or M.&quot; stands for the Latin, &quot;nomen vel nomina&quot;, meaning &quot;name or names&quot;. It is an accident of typography that &quot;nomina&quot; (nn.) came to be represented by &quot;m&quot;.

The catechism was published in 1604 as a stand-alone document. It was later bound up with the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. This edition holds authority across the Anglican Communion.

====United Kingdom====
====United States====
The Episcopal Church&#x27;s 1928 prayer book included a catechism with offices of instruction, based upon the catechism of the Church of England&#x27;s 1662 prayer book.

The Episcopal Church&#x27;s 1979 prayer book includes a catechism newly written for the prayer book, intended as &quot;an outline of instruction&quot; and &quot;a brief summary of the Church&#x27;s teaching&quot;.

&quot;To Be A Christian: An Anglican Catechism&quot; was published in 2020 by Anglican House Media Ministries, the publishing house of the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA).

===Baptist catechisms===

Keach&#x27;s Catechism is utilized in many Particular Baptist congregations. Nondenominational Reformed Baptist preacher John Piper wrote a commentary on this catechism, publishing it in 1986.

===Lutheran catechisms===
Luther&#x27;s Large Catechism (1529) typifies the emphasis which the churches of the Augsburg Confession placed on the importance of knowledge and understanding of the articles of the Christian faith. Primarily intended as instruction to teachers, especially to parents, the catechism consists of a series of exhortations on the importance of each topic of the catechism. It is meant for those who have the capacity to understand, and is meant to be memorized and then repeatedly reviewed so that the Small Catechism could be taught with understanding. For example, the author stipulates in the preface:

Luther adds:
Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism, in contrast, is written to accommodate the understanding of a child or an uneducated person. It begins:

===Methodist catechisms===
&quot;The Probationer&#x27;s Catechism&quot; was authored by Methodist divine S. Olin Garrison for probationary members of the Methodist Episcopal Church seeking full membership in the connexion; it has been one of the most widely used catechisms in Methodist history. &quot;A Catechism on the Christian Religion: The Doctrines of Christianity with Special Emphasis on Wesleyan Concepts&quot; by Mel-Thomas and Helen Rothwell is another popular catechism used to explicate Wesleyan-Arminian theology. More recent publications are &quot;A Catechism Prepared Especially for the Members of the Evangelical Wesleyan Church&quot; (printed in the United States), &quot;A Larger Catechism: For Members of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church&quot; (printed in the United States), and &quot;A Catechism for the Use of the People Called Methodists&quot; (printed in Great Britain).

===Pentecostal catechisms===

While the Pentecostal movement has no one official catechism or confession, nevertheless Pentecostal authors have produced catechetical works. William Seymour, founder of the Azusa Street revival, included a catechism in the Doctrines and Disciplines of the Azusa Street Apostolic Faith Mission. Assemblies of God minister Warren D. Combs produced a catechism in the 1960s. In 2016 Henry Volk the host of the Theology in Perspective podcast authored a resource entitled, A Pentecostal Catechism.

===Quaker catechisms===
A prominent catechism of the Religious Society of Friends is &quot;A Catechism and Confession of Faith&quot; (1673), published by Robert Barclay.

===Reformed catechisms===
Calvin&#x27;s 1545 preface to the Genevan Catechism begins with an acknowledgement that the several traditions and cultures which were joined in the Reformed movement would produce their own form of instruction in each place. While Calvin argues that no effort should be expended on preventing this, he adds:

The scandal of diverse instruction is that it produces diverse baptisms and diverse communions, and diverse faith. However, forms may vary without introducing substantial differences, according to the Reformed view of doctrine.

====Genevan Catechism====

John Calvin produced a catechism while at Geneva (1541), which underwent two major revisions (1545 and 1560). Calvin&#x27;s aim in writing the catechism of 1545 was to set a basic pattern of doctrine, meant to be imitated by other catechists, which would not affirm local distinctions or dwell on controversial issues, but would serve as a pattern for what was expected to be taught by Christian fathers and other teachers of children in the church. The catechism is organized on the topics of faith, law, prayer and sacraments.

====Heidelberg Catechism====
After Protestantism entered into the Palatinate, in 1546 the controversy between Lutherans and Calvinists broke out, and especially while the region was under the elector Otto Heinrich (1556–1559), this conflict in Saxony, particularly in Heidelberg, became increasingly bitter and turned violent.

When Frederick III, Elector Palatine, came into power in 1559 he put his authority behind the Calvinistic view on the Lord&#x27;s Supper, which denied the local presence of the body of Jesus Christ in the elements of the sacrament. He turned Sapienz College into a school of divinity, and in 1562 he placed over it a pupil and friend of Luther&#x27;s colleague, Philipp Melanchthon, named Zacharias Ursinus. In an attempt to resolve the religious disputes in his domain, Frederick called upon Ursinus and his colleague Caspar Olevianus (preacher to Frederick&#x27;s court) to produce a catechism. The two collaborators referred to existing catechetical literature, and especially relied on the catechisms of Calvin and of John Lasco. To prepare the catechism, they adopted the method of sketching drafts independently, and then bringing together the work to combine their efforts. &quot;The final preparation was the work of both theologians, with the constant co-operation of Frederick III. Ursinus has always been regarded as the principal author, as he was afterwards the chief defender and interpreter of the Catechism; still, it would appear that the nervous German style, the division into three parts (as distinguished from the five parts in the Catechism of Calvin and the previous draft of Ursinus), and the genial warmth and unction of the whole work, are chiefly due to Olevianus.&quot; (Schaff, in. Am. Presb. Rev. July 1863, p. 379). The structure of the Heidelberg Catechism is spelled out in the second question; and the three-part structure seen there is based on the belief that the single work of salvation brings forward the three persons of the Trinity in turn, to make God fully and intimately known by his work of salvation, referring to the Apostles&#x27; Creed as an epitome of Christian faith. Assurance of salvation is the unifying theme throughout this catechism: assurance obtained by the work of Christ, applied through the sacraments, and resulting in grateful obedience to the commandments and persistence in prayer.

The Heidelberg Catechism is the most widely used of the Catechisms of the Reformed churches.

====Westminster Catechisms====


Together with the Westminster Confession of Faith (1647), the Westminster Assembly also produced two catechisms, a Larger and a Shorter, which were intended for use in Christian families and in churches. These documents have served as the doctrinal standards, subordinate to the Bible, for Presbyterians and other Reformed churches around the world. The Shorter Catechism shows the Assembly&#x27;s reliance upon the previous work of Calvin, Lasco, and the theologians of Heidelberg. It comprises two main sections summarizing what the Scriptures principally teach: the doctrine of God, and the duty required of men. Questions and answers cover the usual elements: faith, the Ten Commandments, the sacraments, and prayer.

====Other Reformed catechisms====

Oecolampadius composed the &quot;Basel Catechism&quot; in 1526, Leo Juda (1534) followed by Bullinger (1555) published catechisms in Zurich. The French Reformed used Calvin&#x27;s Genevan catechism, as well as works published by Louis Cappel (1619), and Charles Drelincourt (1642).

&quot;Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes&quot;, written by the Puritan minister John Cotton and published in 1656, was the first known children&#x27;s book published in the United States.

==Non-Christian catechisms==
According to Norman DeWitt, the early Christians appropriated the practice of compiling catecisms from the Epicureans, a school whose founder Epicurus had instructed to keep summaries of the teachings for easy learning. 
===Abrahamic religions===

Judaism does not have a formal catechism. While there have been several attempts to formulate Jewish principles of faith, and some of these have achieved wide acceptance, none can be described as being in the form of a catechism. The most widely recited formulation, Yigdal, is in the form of a hymn based on Maimonides&#x27; 13 Articles of Faith.

Besides the manuals of instruction that were published by the Christians for use in their families and churches, there were other works produced by heretical sectarian groups intended as a compact refutation of Christian orthodoxy.

For example, Socinians in Poland published the &quot;Racovian Catechism&quot; in 1605, using the question and answer format of a catechism for the orderly presentation of their arguments against the Trinity and the doctrine of Hell, as these were understood by the Reformed churches from which they were forced to separate.

Islam teaches children and new Muslims the matters of faith, worship, and ethics in the form of a concise manual. They are popular in Turkish as &quot;&quot; (from the Arabic &quot;Ilm ul-Hal&quot;, Situation Science). It is also advised for every Muslim to have a basic knowledge of such matters of religion. The first chapter is the book of cleanliness and first to be taught are subjects such as: which are clean, what is clean and what is not clean, what people need to be cleansed from, how they should clean, and which water should they use to clean. There is a well-known book of catechism that is studied in Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia called &quot;Safinatun Najah&quot;, which talks about of matters of faith, worship and jurisprudence.

===Indian religions===

Bhaktivinoda Thakur&#x27;s book &quot;Jaiva Dharma&quot; is an example of Gaudiya Vaishnava catechism. It follows the usual question-answer format.

In the Pali Canon of Theravada Buddhism a small bit of catechism appears as the fourth section of the Khuddakapatha, as well as the forty-third and forty-fourth suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya. Henry Steel Olcott introduced his own form of Buddhist Catechism, appropriated from Christianity, to Ceylon when setting up his Buddhist education system during the late 19th century Buddhist revival on the island.

===Other religious traditions===

In Zoroastrianism there is the &quot;ČĪDAG ANDARZ Ī PŌRYŌTKĒŠĀN&quot; also known as &quot;Pand-nāmag ī Zardušt&quot; (Book of the counsels of Zoroaster), which is a post-Sasanian compendium of apothegms intended to instruct every Zoroastrian male, upon his attaining the age of fifteen years, in fundamental religious and ethical principles, as well as in the daily duties incumbent upon him. In Robert Charles Zaehner&#x27;s words, it &quot;sums up succinctly the whole of Zoroastrian doctrine: it is what every boy and girl of fifteen must know before he or she is invested with the sacred girdle {kusti}.&quot;

Epicurean catechesis may have originated from the practice of writing outlines of Epicurean doctrines for easy memorization. Epicurus&#x27; Letter to Herodotus is known as the &quot;Little Epitome&quot; which young students are instructed to memorize, and in antiquity they would move on to more advanced teachings with the &quot;Large Epitome&quot;. The 40 Principal Doctrines also serve the role of a catechism. The philosopher Philodemus of Gadara instructed his students to keep an outline of the doctrines on wealth and economics, so that there are additional doctrines that advanced students may focus on.

Schools of esoteric learning have used a catechetical style of instruction, as this Zodiac catechism shows:

Q. &quot;Where is the animal, O Lanoo? and where the Man?&lt;br&gt;
A. Fused into one, O Master of my Life. The two are one. But both have disappeared and naught remains but the deep fire of my desire.
==Secular catechisms==
By the late 18th century, &quot;catechism&quot; was adopted for secular uses, especially in political contexts. These &quot;political catechisms&quot; often utilized the question-and-answer format to succinctly present political ideologies.

The term has also been used by atheist and non-Christian philosophers, such as:
* Saint-Simon (Catechism of Industrialists)
* Auguste Comte (Positivist Catechism)

Catechisms were also written to rehearse the basic knowledge of a non-religious subject. Examples include numerous political catechisms published from the 18th to the 20th century in Europe as well as in North and South America. See also the &quot;Catechism of the History of Newfoundland&quot; (c1856), the &quot;Coal Catechism&quot; (1898), and &quot;A Catechism of the Steam Engine&quot; (1856).
&quot;Elementary catechism on the Constitution of the United States&quot; Arthur J. Stansbury (1828), &quot;Catechism of the Constitution of the United States&quot; Lewis Cruger (1863) and &quot;A Catechism of the Constitution of the United States of America&quot; John V. Overall. Friedrich Engels&#x27; 1847 work &quot;Principles of Communism&quot; was written as a catechism: Engels subsequently decided that the format was not suited to the addition of historical material which he felt was necessary, and he and Karl Marx restructured the material and used it as the nucleus of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;.

Some literary works have also taken the form of a catechism. The 17th episode of James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, known as &quot;Ithaca&quot;, is written in the form of a catechism, as is Ted Hughes&#x27; poem &quot;Examination at the Womb Door&quot;, from the collection &quot;Crow&quot;. In Henry IV, Part 1: Act V, Scene I, Line 141 Falstaff refers to his monologue as a catechism, explaining his view of the virtue of honor.

<text>Makian (also Machian), known to local people as Mount Kie Besi, is a volcanic island, one of the Maluku Islands within the province of North Maluku in Indonesia. It lies near the southern end of a chain of volcanic islands off the western coast of the province&#x27;s major island, Halmahera, and lies between the islands of Moti and Tidore to the north and Kayoa and the Bacan Group to the south. The island, which forms two districts (&quot;Pulau Makian&quot; and &quot;Makian Barat&quot;) within South Halmahera Regency of North Maluku Province, covers an area of 91.04 sq.km, and had a population of 12,394 at the 2010 Census, which rose to 14,000 at the 2020 Census. The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 12,525.

Makian Island District (&quot;Kecamatan Pulau Makian&quot;) occupies the eastern 61% of the island and consists of the 15 villages (&quot;desa&quot;) of Dalam, Dauri, Gitang, Gorup, Gurua, Kyowor, Matentengin, Ploili, Rabutdaiyo, Sangapati, Suma, Waigitang, Wailoa, Walo and Waykion. West Makian District (&quot;Kecamatan Makian Barat&quot;) covers the 7 villages (&quot;desa&quot;) of Bobawae, Malapat, Mateketen, Ombawa, Sebelei, Talapaon and Tegono.

The island is wide, and its high summit consists of a large wide crater, with a small lake on its Northeast side. There are four parasitic cones on the western slopes of Makian. Makian volcano is also known as Mount Kiebesi (or Kie Besi).

==Volcanic history==
Makian volcano has had infrequent, but violent eruptions that destroyed villages on the island.

Its first recorded eruption was in the 1550s. The eruptions of July 19, 1646, September 22, 1760 and December 28, 1861 are rated 4 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. Since the first known eruption in the 1550s, it has erupted seven times, four of which caused fatalities.

The 1760 eruption of the volcano killed about three thousand inhabitants. It erupted in 1890, and was then dormant until July 1988, when a series of eruptions forced the temporary evacuation of the island&#x27;s entire population, then about fifteen thousand people.

== Languages ==
There are 2 unrelated languages spoken in this island, Taba and West Makian languages. Taba or East Makian belongs to the Austronesian language family, while West Makian belongs to the West Papuan language family.

<doc id="295859" wikidata="Q4729913" url="?curid=295859" title="All You Zombies (song)">
<text>&quot;All You Zombies&quot; is a song by American rock band The Hooters, written by the band&#x27;s founding members Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman. It was first recorded live and released as a single in 1982. It was subsequently included on the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Amore&quot; (1983) and an extended version of the song was included on their second album &quot;Nervous Night&quot; (1985). This version was released as a single in 1985 and reached No. 58 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also charted within the top 20 in Germany and New Zealand, but was most successful in Australia, where it reached Number 8 on the charts in 1985.

==Background==
Influenced by reggae music, co-writer Eric Bazilian said the band was working on a different song when the idea &quot;just came to us, like a vision.&quot; The band members dropped their work on the other song and finished &quot;All You Zombies&quot; that night. Writing partner Rob Hyman believed the song to be the fastest they had written &quot;that was of any quality.&quot;

The Hooters first released a version of &quot;All You Zombies&quot; recorded live at the Emerald City nightclub in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, on 11 April 1981. The single was released in 1982 by Eighty Percent Records. A different version of the song later appeared on the &quot;Amore&quot; album, released independently in 1983. Hyman and Bazilian had worked with Cyndi Lauper on her album &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;, which led to Columbia Records offering the band a contract. They re-released &quot;All You Zombies&quot; with additional instrumental sections, making the song almost six minutes long. It became a minor hit in the US, reaching the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and a top 10 success in Australia, where it peaked at No. 8 for two weeks in September 1985. The single also reached the top 20 in New Zealand and Germany.

Eric Bazilian told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1985 that he didn&#x27;t know the meaning of the song despite having written it. &quot;People ask us what it&#x27;s about ... the weird thing is we didn&#x27;t consciously put [the heavy stuff] there.&quot; Hyman later told Songfacts that the biblical images, including Moses and Noah, were not part of any agenda, though some radio stations refused to play it. &quot;I love songs like that, you just listen and every time you hear it you kind of wonder what&#x27;s going on.&quot;

<doc id="295860" wikidata="Q152824" url="?curid=295860" title="Susan Sontag">
<text>Susan Lee Sontag (; January 16, 1933 – December 28, 2004) was an American writer, critic, and public intellectual. She mostly wrote essays, but also published novels; she published her first major work, the essay &quot;Notes on &#x27;Camp&#x27;&quot;, in 1964. Her best-known works include the critical works &quot;Against Interpretation&quot; (1966), &quot;On Photography&quot; (1977), &quot;Illness as Metaphor&quot; (1978) and &quot;Regarding the Pain of Others&quot; (2003), as well as the fictional works &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot; (1986), &quot;The Volcano Lover&quot; (1992), and &quot;In America&quot; (1999).

Sontag was active in writing and speaking about, or traveling to, areas of conflict, including during the Vietnam War and the Siege of Sarajevo. She wrote extensively about literature, photography and media, culture, AIDS and illness, war, human rights, and left-wing politics. Her essays and speeches drew backlash and controversy, and she has been called &quot;one of the most influential critics of her generation&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Sontag was born Susan Rosenblatt in New York City, the daughter of Mildred (née Jacobson) and Jack Rosenblatt, both Jews of Lithuanian and Polish descent. Her father managed a fur trading business in China, where he died of tuberculosis in 1939, when Susan was five years old. Seven years later, Sontag&#x27;s mother married US Army Captain Nathan Sontag. Susan and her sister, Judith, took their stepfather&#x27;s surname, although he did not adopt them formally. Sontag did not have a religious upbringing and said she had not entered a synagogue until her mid-20s.

Remembering an unhappy childhood, with a cold, alcoholic, distant mother who was &quot;always away&quot;, Sontag lived on Long Island, New York, then in Tucson, Arizona, and later in the San Fernando Valley in southern California, where she took refuge in books and graduated from North Hollywood High School at the age of 15. She began her undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley but transferred to the University of Chicago in admiration of its prominent core curriculum. At Chicago, she undertook studies in philosophy, ancient history, and literature alongside her other requirements. Leo Strauss, Joseph Schwab, Christian Mackauer, Richard McKeon, Peter von Blanckenhagen, and Kenneth Burke were among her lecturers. She graduated at age 18 with an A.B. and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. While at Chicago, she became best friends with fellow student Mike Nichols. In 1951, her work appeared in print for the first time in the winter issue of the &quot;Chicago Review&quot;.

At 17, Sontag married writer Philip Rieff, a sociology instructor at the University of Chicago, after a 10-day courtship; their marriage lasted eight years. While studying at Chicago, Sontag attended a summer school taught by the sociologist who became a friend and subsequently influenced her study of German thinkers. Upon completing her Chicago degree, Sontag taught freshman English at the University of Connecticut for the 1952–53 academic year. She attended Harvard University for graduate school, initially studying literature with Perry Miller and Harry Levin before moving into philosophy and theology under Paul Tillich, Jacob Taubes, Raphael Demos, and Morton White.

After completing her Master of Arts in philosophy, Sontag began doctoral research in metaphysics, ethics, Greek philosophy, Continental philosophy, and theology at Harvard. The philosopher Herbert Marcuse lived with Sontag and Rieff for a year while working on his 1955 book &quot;Eros and Civilization&quot;. Sontag researched for Rieff&#x27;s 1959 study &quot;&quot; before their divorce in 1958, and contributed to the book to such an extent that she has been considered an unofficial co-author. The couple had a son, David Rieff, who went on to be his mother&#x27;s editor at Farrar, Straus and Giroux, as well as a writer in his own right. According to Sontag&#x27;s Benjamin Moser, Sontag was the true author of the text on Freud, which she wrote after David&#x27;s birth, and in the separation the latter was the subject of an exchange: she handed over the authorship of the book to Rieff, he gave her their son.

Sontag was awarded an American Association of University Women&#x27;s fellowship for the 1957–58 academic year to St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she traveled without her husband and son. There, she had classes with Iris Murdoch, Stuart Hampshire, A. J. Ayer, and H. L. A. Hart while also attending the B. Phil seminars of J. L. Austin and the lectures of Isaiah Berlin. But Oxford did not appeal to her, and she transferred after Michaelmas term of 1957 to the University of Paris (the Sorbonne). In Paris, Sontag socialized with expatriate artists and academics including Allan Bloom, Jean Wahl, Alfred Chester, Harriet Sohmers, and María Irene Fornés. She remarked that her time in Paris was perhaps the most important period of her life. It certainly provided the basis of her long intellectual and artistic association with the culture of France. She moved to New York in 1959 to live with Fornés for the next seven years, regaining custody of her son and teaching at several universities, including the City College of New York, while her literary reputation grew.

==Career==
===Fiction===

While working on her stories, Sontag taught philosophy at Sarah Lawrence College and City University of New York and the philosophy of religion with Jacob Taubes, Susan Taubes, Theodor Gaster, and Hans Jonas, in the religion department at Columbia University from 1960 to 1964. She held a writing fellowship at Rutgers University in 1964–65 before ending her relationship with academia in favor of full-time freelance writing.

At age 30, Sontag published an experimental novel called &quot;The Benefactor&quot; (1963), following it four years later with &quot;Death Kit&quot; (1967). Despite a relatively small output, Sontag thought of herself principally as a novelist and writer of fiction. Her short story &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot; was published to great acclaim on November 24, 1986, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Written in an experimental narrative style, it remains a significant text on the AIDS epidemic. She achieved late popular success as a best-selling novelist with &quot;The Volcano Lover&quot; (1992). At age 67, Sontag published her final novel, &quot;In America&quot; (2000). The last two novels were set in the past, which Sontag said gave her greater freedom to write in the polyphonic voice:
She wrote and directed four films and also wrote several plays, the most successful of which were &quot;Alice in Bed&quot; and &quot;Lady from the Sea&quot;.

===Nonfiction===
====High and low in mass culture====
It was through her essays that Sontag gained early fame and notoriety. She frequently wrote about the intersection of high and low art and expanded the dichotomy concept of form and art in every medium. She elevated camp to the status of recognition with her widely read 1964 essay &quot;Notes on &#x27;Camp&#x27;&quot;, which accepted art as including common, absurd, and burlesque themes.

====The concept of photography image====
In 1977, Sontag published the series of essays &quot;On Photography&quot;. These essays are an exploration of photographs as a collection of the world, mainly by travelers or tourists, and the way we experience it. In the essays, she outlined her theory of taking pictures as you travel:

The method especially appeals to people handicapped by a ruthless work ethic—Germans, Japanese and Americans. Using a camera appeases the anxiety which the work driven feel about not working when they are on vacation and supposed to be having fun. They have something to do that is like a friendly imitation of work: they can take pictures. (p. 10)
Sontag writes that the convenience of modern photography has created an overabundance of visual material, and &quot;just about everything has been photographed&quot;. This has altered our expectations of what we have the right to view, want to view, or should view. 

====Ethic and the problem of norms====
Ethical intentions are key points for Sontag. In her book &quot;On Photography&quot; she writes of the connection of the photography with the idea of norm. Discussing photographs of Diane Arbus, Sontag writes on borders and landmarks of the photo program of beauty. Beauty is the ground of the photography program and at the same time one of the biggest conceptual questions of photography. The problem of identification of beauty and ugliness forms one more question—the idea of norm.

&quot;In teaching us a new visual code, photographs alter and enlarge our notion of what is worth looking at and what we have the right to observe&quot; and has changed our &quot;viewing ethics&quot;. 

====Photography: reality and truth====
According to Sontag, photographs have increased our access to knowledge and experiences of history and faraway places, but the images may replace direct experience and limit reality; photography desensitizes its audience to horrific human experiences, and children are exposed to experiences before they are ready for them.

Sontag continued to theorize about the role of photography in life in her essay &quot;Looking at War: Photography&#x27;s View of Devastation and Death&quot;, which appeared in the December 9, 2002, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. There she concludes that the problem of our reliance on images and especially photographic images is not that &quot;people remember through photographs but that they remember only the photographs ... that the photographic image eclipses other forms of understanding—and remembering. ... To remember is, more and more, not to recall a story but to be able to call up a picture&quot; (p. 94).

She became a role model for many feminists and aspiring female writers during the 1960s and 1970s.

==Criticism==

===White civilization as a cancer===
Sontag drew acclaim and criticism for writing in 1967 in &quot;Partisan Review&quot;:

According to journalist Mark M. Goldblatt, Sontag later made a &quot;sarcastic retraction, saying the line slanders cancer patients&quot;. Patrick J. Buchanan said: &quot;Rewrite that sentence with &#x27;Jewish race&#x27; in place of &#x27;white race&#x27; and the passage would fit nicely into &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;&quot;. According to Eliot Weinberger, &quot;She came to regret that last phrase, and wrote a whole book against the use of illness as metaphor&quot;. But, he wrote, this did not lead to any &quot;public curiosity about those who are not cancerously white&quot;, and &quot;She may well have been the last unashamed Eurocentrist&quot;.

===Allegations of plagiarism===
Ellen Lee accused Sontag of plagiarism after discovering at least 12 passages in &quot;In America&quot; that were similar to or copied from passages in four other books about Helena Modjeska without attribution. Sontag said of the passages, &quot;All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain. I&#x27;ve used these sources and I&#x27;ve completely transformed them. There&#x27;s a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.&quot;

In a 2007 letter to the editor of the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, John Lavagnino identified an unattributed citation from Roland Barthes&#x27;s 1970 essay &quot;S/Z&quot; in Sontag&#x27;s 2004 speech &quot;At the Same Time: The Novelist and Moral Reasoning&quot;, delivered as the Nadine Gordimer Lecture in March 2004. Further research led Lavagnino to identify several passages that appeared to have been taken without attribution from an essay on hypertext fiction by Laura Miller published in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; six years earlier&quot;.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Observer&quot;, Michael Calderone interviewed Sontag&#x27;s publisher, who said, &quot;This was a speech, not a formal essay&quot;, and that &quot;Susan herself never prepared it for publication&quot;.

===On Communism===
At a New York pro-Solidarity rally in 1982, Sontag said that &quot;people on the left&quot;, like herself, &quot;have willingly or unwillingly told a lot of lies&quot;. She added that they:

Sontag&#x27;s speech reportedly &quot;drew boos and shouts from the audience&quot;. &quot;The Nation&quot; published her speech, excluding the passage contrasting the magazine with &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Responses to her statement were varied. Some said that Sontag&#x27;s sentiments had been held by many on the left for years, while others accused her of betraying &quot;radical ideas&quot;.

===On the September 11 attacks===
Sontag was angrily criticized for what she wrote in the September 24, 2001, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; about the immediate aftermath of 9/11. She called the attacks a &quot;monstrous dose of reality&quot; and criticized U.S. public officials and media commentators for trying to convince the American public that &quot;everything is O.K.&quot; Specifically, she opposed the idea that the perpetrators were &quot;cowards&quot;, a comment George W. Bush had made. Rather, she argued the country should see the terrorists&#x27; actions not as &quot;a &#x27;cowardly&#x27; attack on &#x27;civilization&#x27; or &#x27;liberty&#x27; or &#x27;humanity&#x27; or &#x27;the free world&#x27; but an attack on the world&#x27;s self-proclaimed superpower, undertaken as a consequence of specific American alliances and actions.&quot;

===Criticism from other writers===
In a 2000 article for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;&#x27;s that was later included in his book &quot;Hooking Up&quot;, Tom Wolfe called Sontag &quot;just another scribbler who spent her life signing up for protest meetings and lumbering to the podium encumbered by her prose style, which had a handicapped parking sticker valid at &quot;Partisan Review&quot;.&quot;

In &quot;Sontag, Bloody Sontag&quot;, an essay in her 1994 book &quot;Vamps &amp; Tramps&quot;, critic Camille Paglia describes her initial admiration of and subsequent disillusionment with Sontag. She makes several criticisms, including Harold Bloom&#x27;s comment &quot;Mere Sontagisme!&quot; on Paglia&#x27;s doctoral dissertation, and says that Sontag &quot;had become synonymous with a shallow kind of hip posturing&quot;. Paglia also recounts a visit by Sontag to Bennington College, in which she arrived hours late and ignored the agreed-upon topic of the event.

Seemingly unaware of Sontag&#x27;s choice to live in Sarajevo during the siege, in his book &quot;Skin in the Game&quot;, Nassim Nicholas Taleb criticizes Sontag and other people with extravagant lifestyles who nevertheless declare themselves &quot;against the market system&quot;. Taleb assesses Sontag&#x27;s shared New York mansion at $28 million, and writes that &quot;it is immoral to be in opposition to the market system and not live (somewhere in Vermont or Northwestern Afghanistan) in a hut or cave isolated from it&quot; and that it is even worse to &quot;claim virtue without fully living with its direct consequences&quot;.

==Activism==
Sontag became politically active in the 1960s, opposing the Vietnam War. In January 1968, she signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse to pay a proposed 10% Vietnam War surtax. In May 1968, she visited Hanoi; afterward, she wrote favorably about North Vietnamese society in her essay &quot;Trip to Hanoi&quot;.
During 1989 Sontag was the President of PEN American Center, the main U.S. branch of the International PEN writers&#x27; organization. After Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a &quot;fatwa&quot; death sentence against writer Salman Rushdie for blasphemy after the publication of his novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; that year, Sontag&#x27;s uncompromising support of Rushdie was crucial in rallying American writers to his cause.

A few years later, during the Siege of Sarajevo, Sontag gained attention for directing a production of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in a candlelit theater in the Bosnian capital, cut off from its electricity supply for three and a half years. The reaction of Sarajevo&#x27;s besieged residents was noted:To the people of Sarajevo, Ms. Sontag has become a symbol, interviewed frequently by the local newspapers and television, invited to speak at gatherings everywhere, asked for autographs on the street. After the opening performance of the play, the city&#x27;s Mayor, Muhamed Kreševljaković, came onstage to declare her an honorary citizen, the only foreigner other than the recently departed United Nations commander, Lieut. Gen. Phillippe Morillon, to be so named. &quot;It is for your bravery, in coming here, living here, and working with us,&quot; he said.

==Personal life==
Sontag&#x27;s mother died of lung cancer in Hawaii in 1986.

Sontag died in New York City on December 28, 2004, aged 71, from complications of myelodysplastic syndrome which had evolved into acute myelogenous leukemia. She is buried in Paris at Cimetière du Montparnasse. Her final illness has been chronicled by her son, David Rieff.

===Sexuality and relationships===

Sontag became aware of her bisexuality during her early teens. At 15, she wrote in her diary, &quot;I feel I have lesbian tendencies (how reluctantly I write this).&quot; At 16, she had a sexual encounter with a woman: &quot;Perhaps I was drunk, after all, because it was so beautiful when H began making love to me... It had been 4:00 before we had gotten to bed... I became fully conscious that I desired her, she knew it, too.&quot;

Sontag lived with &#x27;H&#x27;, the writer and model Harriet Sohmers Zwerling, whom she first met at U. C. Berkeley from 1958 to 1959. Later, Sontag was the partner of María Irene Fornés, a Cuban-American avant garde playwright and director. Upon splitting with Fornés, she was involved with an Italian aristocrat, Carlotta Del Pezzo, and the German academic Eva Kollisch. Sontag was romantically involved with the American artists Jasper Johns and Paul Thek. During the early 1970s, she lived with Nicole Stéphane, a Rothschild banking heiress turned movie actress, and, later, the choreographer Lucinda Childs. Sontag also had a relationship with the writer Joseph Brodsky, who deepened her appreciation of the anti-communism of the writers persecuted by the Soviet regime, whom she had read and in some cases even known, without really understanding them. 

With photographer Annie Leibovitz, Sontag maintained a close romantic relationship stretching from the later 1980s until her final years. Sontag and Leibovitz met in 1989, when both had already established notability in their careers. Leibovitz has suggested that Sontag mentored her and constructively criticized her work. During Sontag&#x27;s lifetime, neither woman publicly disclosed whether the relationship was a friendship or romantic. &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 2006 made reference to Leibovitz&#x27;s decade-plus relationship with Sontag: &quot;The two first met in the late &#x27;80s, when Leibovitz photographed her for a book jacket. They never lived together, though they each had an apartment within view of the other&#x27;s.&quot;

When interviewed for her 2006 book &quot;A Photographer&#x27;s Life: 1990–2005&quot;, Leibovitz said the book told a number of stories, and that &quot;with Susan, it was a love story.&quot; While &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2009 referred to Sontag as Leibovitz&#x27;s &quot;companion&quot;, Leibovitz wrote in &quot;A Photographer&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Words like &#x27;companion&#x27; and &#x27;partner&#x27; were not in our vocabulary. We were two people who helped each other through our lives. The closest word is still &#x27;friend. The same year, Leibovitz said the descriptor &quot;lover&quot; was accurate. She later reiterated, &quot;Call us &#x27;lovers.&#x27; I like &#x27;lovers.&#x27; You know, &#x27;lovers&#x27; sounds romantic. I mean, I want to be perfectly clear. I love Susan.&quot;

In an interview in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2000, Sontag was open about bisexuality:
Many of Sontag&#x27;s obituaries failed to mention her significant same-sex relationships, most notably that with Leibovitz. Daniel Okrent, public editor of &quot;The New York Times,&quot; defended the newspaper&#x27;s obituary, saying that at the time of Sontag&#x27;s death, a reporter could make no independent verification of her romantic relationship with Leibovitz (despite attempts to do so). After Sontag&#x27;s death, &quot;Newsweek&quot; published an article about Leibovitz that made clear references to her relationship with Sontag.

Sontag was quoted by editor-in-chief Brendan Lemon of &quot;Out&quot; magazine as saying &quot;I grew up in a time when the modus operandi was the &#x27;open secret.&#x27; I&#x27;m used to that, and quite OK with it. Intellectually, I know why I haven&#x27;t spoken more about my sexuality, but I do wonder if I haven&#x27;t repressed something there to my detriment. Maybe I could have given comfort to some people if I had dealt with the subject of my private sexuality more, but it&#x27;s never been my prime mission to give comfort, unless somebody&#x27;s in drastic need. I&#x27;d rather give pleasure, or shake things up.&quot;

==Legacy==
Following Sontag&#x27;s death, Steve Wasserman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called her &quot;one of America&#x27;s most influential intellectuals, internationally renowned for the passionate engagement and breadth of her critical intelligence and her ardent activism in the cause of human rights.&quot; Eric Homberger of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called Sontag &quot;the &#x27;Dark Lady&#x27; of American cultural life for over four decades.&quot; He observed that &quot;despite a brimming and tartly phrased political sensibility, she was fundamentally an aesthete [who] offered a reorientation of American cultural horizons.&quot;

Of &quot;Against Interpretation&quot;, Brandon Robshaw of &quot;The Independent&quot; later wrote that &quot;Sontag was remarkably prescient; her project of analysing popular culture as well as high culture, the Doors as well as Dostoevsky, is now common practice throughout the educated world.&quot; In &quot;Critique and Postcritique&quot; (2017), Rita Felski and Elizabeth S. Anker argue that the title essay from the aforementioned collection played an important role in the field of postcritique, a movement within literary criticism and cultural studies that attempts to find new forms of reading and interpretation that go beyond the methods of critique, critical theory, and ideological criticism.

Reviewing Sontag&#x27;s &quot;On Photography&quot; in 1998, Michael Starenko wrote that it &quot;has become so deeply absorbed into this discourse that Sontag&#x27;s claims about photography, as well as her mode of argument, have become part of the rhetorical &#x27;tool kit&#x27; that photography theorists and critics carry around in their heads.&quot;

==Digital archive==
A digital archive of 17,198 of Sontag&#x27;s emails is kept by the UCLA Department of Special Collections at the Charles E. Young Research Library. Her archive—and the efforts to make it publicly available while protecting it from bit rot—are the subject of the article &quot;On Excess: Susan Sontag&#x27;s Born-Digital Archive&quot;, by Jeremy Schmidt and Jacquelyn Ardam.

==Biographical play, documentary, and biopic film ==
&quot;Sontag: Reborn&quot; is a play dramatizing Sontag&#x27;s life as recorded in her early journals (which were later edited and published as the book &quot;Reborn&quot;). Described as &quot;a spellbinding X-ray of a writer’s psyche&quot;, &quot;Sontag: Reborn&quot; traces Sontag&#x27;s private life from age 14 to her emergence as a renowned author and activist. The young Sontag wrestles with her emerging sexuality and precocious intelligence. The refuge of her diary became integral to her development as a writer. The play was adapted from Sontag&#x27;s journals by theatre artist Moe Angelos, who also plays Sontag in the production, directed by Marianne Weems, and produced by The Builders Association. &quot;Sontag: Reborn&quot; was first staged at the Under the Radar Festival in 2012, moved to off-Broadway at New York Theatre Workshop in 2013, and was staged into 2014. 

A documentary about Sontag directed by Nancy Kates, &quot;Regarding Susan Sontag&quot;, was released in 2014. It received the Special Jury Mention for Best Documentary Feature at the 2014 Tribeca Festival.

In February 2023, &quot;Screen&quot; reported that Brouhaha Entertainment was producing a biographical film directed by Kirsten Johnson and featuring Kristen Stewart as Sontag. It is based on Benjamin Moser&#x27;s biography &quot;&quot;.
