<text>Advaita Vedanta (; , ) is a Hindu tradition of textual exegesis and philosophy that states that &quot;jivatman&quot;, the individual experiencing self, is ultimately pure awareness mistakenly identified with body and the senses, and non-different (&quot;na aparah&quot;) from &quot;Ātman/Brahman&quot;, the highest Self or Reality. The term &quot;Advaita&quot; literally means &quot;non-secondness&quot;, but is usually rendered as &quot;nonduality&quot;, referring to the Oneness of Brahman, the only real Existent, and often equated with monism. 

Advaita Vedanta is a Hindu sādhanā, a path of spiritual discipline and experience, and states that &quot;moksha&quot; (liberation from &#x27;suffering&#x27; and rebirth) is attained through knowledge of Brahman, recognizing the illusoriness of the phenomenal world and disidentification from the body-mind complex and the notion of &#x27;doership&#x27;, and acquiring &quot;vidyā&quot; (knowledge) of one&#x27;s true identity as &quot;Atman/Brahman&quot;, self-luminous (&quot;svayam prakāśa&quot;) awareness or Witness-consciousness. This knowledge is acquired through Upanishadic statements such as &quot;tat tvam asi&quot;, &quot;that[&#x27;s how] you are,&quot; which destroy the ignorance (&quot;avidyā&quot;) regarding one&#x27;s true identity by revealing that &quot;(jiv)Ātman&quot; is non-different from immortal &quot;Brahman&quot;.

The Advaita vedanta tradition modifies the Samkhya-dualism between &quot;Purusha&quot; (pure awareness or consciousness) and &quot;Prakriti&quot; (&#x27;nature&#x27;, which includes matter but also cognition and emotion) as the two equal basic principles of existence, proposing instead that &quot;Atman/Brahman&quot; (awareness, &quot;purusha&quot;) alone is ultimately real, and, though unchanging, the cause and origin of the transient phenomenal world (&quot;prakriti&quot;). In this view, the &quot;jivatman&quot; or individual self is a mere reflection or limitation of singular &quot;Ātman&quot; in a multitude of apparent individual bodies. It regards the material world as an illusory appearance (&quot;maya&quot;) or &quot;an unreal manifestation (&quot;vivarta&quot;) of Brahman,&quot; the latter as proposed by the 13th century scholar Prakasatman of the Vivarana school.

Advaita Vedanta is often presented as an elite scholarly tradition belonging to the orthodox Hindu Vedānta tradition, emphasizing scholarly works written in Sanskrit; as such, it is an &quot;iconic representation of Hindu religion and culture.&quot; Yet contemporary Advaita Vedanta is yogic Advaita, a medieval and modern syncretic tradition incorporating Yoga and other traditions, and producing works in vernacular. The earliest Advaita writings are the Sannyasa Upanishads (first centuries CE), the &quot;Vākyapadīya&quot;, written by Bhartṛhari (second half 5th century,) and the &quot;Māndūkya-kārikā&quot; written by Gauḍapāda (7th century). Gaudapada adapted philosophical concepts from Buddhism, giving them a Vedantic basis and interpretation. The Buddhist concepts were further Vedanticised by Adi Shankara (8th c. CE), who is generally regarded as the most prominent exponent of the Advaita Vedānta tradition, though some of the most prominent Advaita-propositions come from other Advaitins, and his early influence has been questioned. Adi Shankara emphasized that, since Brahman is ever-present, Brahman-knowledge is immediate and requires no &#x27;action&#x27; or &#x27;doership&#x27;, that is, striving (to attain) and effort. Nevertheless, the Advaita tradition, as represented by Mandana Misra and the &quot;Bhamati&quot; school, also prescribes elaborate preparatory practice, including contemplation of the mahavakyas, posing a paradox of two opposing approaches which is also recognized in other spiritual disciplines and traditions.

Shankara&#x27;s prominence as the exemplary defender of traditional Hindu-values and spirituality started to take shape only centuries later, in the 14th century, with the ascent of Sringeri matha and its &quot;jagadguru&quot; Vidyaranya (Madhava, 14th cent.) in the Vijayanagara Empire, While Adi Shankara did not embrace &quot;Yoga&quot;, the Advaita-tradition by then had accepted yogic samadhi as a means to still the mind and attain knowledge, explicitly incorporating elements from the yogic tradition and texts like the &quot;Yoga Vasistha&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, culminating in Swami Vivekananda&#x27;s full embrace and propagation of Yogic samadhi as an Advaita means of knowledge and liberation. In the 19th century, due to the influence of Vidyaranya&#x27;s &quot;Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha&quot;, the importance of Advaita Vedānta was overemphasized by Western scholarship, and Advaita Vedānta came to be regarded as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality, despite the numerical dominance of theistic Bhakti-oriented religiosity. In modern times, Advaita views appear in various Neo-Vedānta movements.

==Etymology and nomenclature==

===Etymology===
The word Advaita is a composite of two Sanskrit words:
* Prefix &quot;a-&quot; (अ), meaning &quot;non-&quot;
* &quot;Dvaita&quot; (द्वैत), which means &#x27;duality&#x27; or &#x27;dualism&#x27;.

&quot;Advaita&quot; is often translated as &quot;non-duality,&quot; but a more apt translation is &quot;non-secondness.&quot; &quot;Advaita&quot; refers to the Oneness of Brahman, sometimes interpreted as monism: there is no other reality than &quot;Brahman&quot;, that &quot;Reality is not constituted by parts,&quot; that is, ever-changing &#x27;things&#x27; have no existence of their own, but are appearances of the one Existent, Brahman; and that there is in reality no duality between the &quot;experiencing self&quot; (&quot;jiva&quot;) and &quot;Brahman&quot;, the Ground of Being.

It is also used to refer to nondual awareness, the illusinoriness of a distinction between perceiving subject and perceived object As Gaudapada states, when a distinction is made between subject and object, people grasp to objects, which is &quot;samsara&quot;. By realizing one&#x27;s true identity as &quot;Brahman&quot;, there is no more grasping, and the mind comes to rest.

In a popular sense, advaita is often expressed as the famous diction that Atman is Brahman, meaning that &quot;jivatman&quot;, the individual experiencing self, is ultimately pure awareness mistakenly identified with body and the senses, and non-different (&quot;na aparah&quot;) from &quot;Ātman/Brahman&quot;, the highest Self or Reality;; the knowledge of this true identity is liberating.

The word &quot;Vedānta&quot; is a composition of two Sanskrit words: The word Veda refers to the whole corpus of vedic texts, and the word &quot;anta&quot; means &#x27;end&#x27;. From this, one meaning of &quot;Vedānta&quot; is &quot;the end of the Vedas&quot; or &quot;the ultimate knowledge of the Vedas&quot;. &quot;Veda&quot; can also mean &quot;knowledge&quot; in general, so &quot;Vedānta&quot; can be taken to mean &quot;the end, conclusion or finality of knowledge&quot;. Vedānta is one of six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy.

===Advaita Vedanta===
While &quot;a preferred terminology&quot; for Upanisadic philosophy &quot;in the early periods, before the time of Shankara&quot; was &quot;Puruṣavāda&quot;, the Advaita Vedānta school has historically been referred to by various names, such as &quot;Advaita-vada&quot; (speaker of Advaita), &quot;Abheda-darshana&quot; (view of non-difference), &quot;Dvaita-vada-pratisedha&quot; (denial of dual distinctions), and &quot;Kevala-dvaita&quot; (non-dualism of the isolated). It is also called &quot;māyāvāda&quot; by Vaishnava opponents, akin to Madhyamaka Buddhism, due to their insistence that phenomena ultimately lack an inherent essence or reality,

According to Richard King, a professor of Buddhist and Asian studies, the term &quot;Advaita&quot; first occurs in a recognizably Vedantic context in the prose of Mandukya Upanishad.

According to Frits Staal, a professor of philosophy specializing in Sanskrit and Vedic studies, the word &quot;Advaita&quot; itself is from the Vedic era, and the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya (8th or 7th-century BCE) is credited to be the one who coined it. Stephen Phillips, a professor of philosophy and Asian studies, translates the &quot;Advaita&quot; containing verse excerpt in &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;, as &quot;An ocean, a single seer without duality becomes he whose world is Brahman.&quot;

===Advaita tradition===
While the term &quot;Advaita Vedanta&quot; in a strict sense may refer to the scholastic tradition of textual exegesis established by Shankara, &quot;advaita&quot; in a broader sense may refer to a broad current of advaitic thought, which incorporates advaitic elements with yogic thought and practice and other strands of Indian religiosity, such as Kashmir Shaivism and the Nath tradition. The first connotation has also been called &quot;Classical Advaita&quot; and &quot;doctrinal Advaita,&quot; and its presentation as such is due to mediaeval doxographies, the influence of Orientalist Indologists like Paul Deussen, and the Indian response to colonial influences, dubbed neo-Vedanta by Paul Hacker, who regarded it as a deviation from &quot;traditional&quot; Advaita Vedanta. Yet, post-Shankara Advaita Vedanta incorporated yogic elements, such as the Yoga Vasistha, and influenced other Indian traditions, and neo-Vedanta is based on this broader strand of Indian thought. This broader current of thought and practice has also been called &quot;greater Advaita Vedanta,&quot; &quot;vernacular advaita,&quot; and &quot;experiential Advaita.&quot; It is this broader advaitic tradition which is commonly presented as &quot;Advaita Vedanta,&quot; though the term &quot;advaitic&quot; may be more apt.

===Monism===
The nondualism of Advaita Vedānta is often regarded as an idealist monism. According to King, Advaita Vedānta developed &quot;to its ultimate extreme&quot; the monistic ideas already present in the Upanishads. In contrast, states Milne, it is misleading to call Advaita Vedānta &quot;monistic,&quot; since this confuses the &quot;negation of difference&quot; with &quot;conflation into one.&quot; &quot;Advaita&quot; is a negative term (a-dvaita), states Milne, which denotes the &quot;negation of a difference,&quot; between subject and object, or between perceiver and perceived.

According to Deutsch, Advaita Vedānta teaches monistic oneness, however without the multiplicity premise of alternate monism theories. According to Jacqueline Suthren Hirst, Adi Shankara positively emphasizes &quot;oneness&quot; premise in his Brahma-sutra Bhasya 2.1.20, attributing it to all the Upanishads.

Nicholson states Advaita Vedānta contains realistic strands of thought, both in its oldest origins and in Shankara&#x27;s writings.

==Soteriology: moksha – liberating knowledge of Brahman==

===Knowledge is liberating===

The soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge as being in essence (Atman), awareness or witness-consciousness, and complete understanding of the identity of &quot;jivan-ātman&quot; and Brahman. Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is the attainment of &quot;Brahman&quot;, immortality, and leads to &quot;moksha&quot; (liberation) from suffering and &quot;samsara&quot;, the cycle of rebirth This is stated by Shankara as follows:
According to Advaita Vedānta, liberation can be achieved while living, and is called &quot;Jivanmukti&quot;. in contrast to &quot;Videhamukti&quot; (moksha from samsara after death) in theistic sub-schools of Vedānta. The Atman-knowledge, that is the knowledge of true Self and its relationship to Brahman is central to this liberation in Advaita thought. Atman-knowledge, to Advaitins, is full awareness that everything is Brahman.

According to Anantanand Rambachan, in Advaita, this state of liberating self-knowledge includes and leads to the understanding that &quot;the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self.&quot;

===Attaining &quot;vidyā&quot; (knowledge)===
Advaita Vedānta regards the liberated state of being &quot;Atman/Brahman&quot; as one&#x27;s true identity and inherent to being human. According to Shankara and the Vivarana-school, no human action can &#x27;produce&#x27; this liberated state, as it is what one already is. As Swami Vivekananda stated:
According to Shankara, taking a subitist position, &quot;moksha&quot; is attained at once when the &quot;mahavakyas&quot;, articulating the identity of &quot;Atman&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot;, are understood.

Yet, the Advaita-tradition also emphasizes human effort, a path of Jnana Yoga with a progression of study and training to realize one&#x27;s true identity as &quot;Atman/Brahman&quot; and attain moksha. According to the contemporary Advaita tradition, knowledge of Atman/Brahman is obtained gradually, by &quot;svādhyāya&quot;, study of the self and of the Vedic texts, which consists of four stages of &quot;samanyasa&quot;: &quot;virāga&quot; (&#x27;renunciation&#x27;), &quot;sravana&quot; (&#x27;listening to the teachings of the sages&#x27;), &quot;manana&quot; (&#x27;reflection on the teachings&#x27;) and &quot;nididhyāsana&quot;, introspection and profound and repeated meditation on the mahavakyas, selected Upanishadic statements such as &quot;tat tvam asi&quot; (&#x27;that art thou&#x27; or &#x27;you are That&#x27;) which are taken literal, and form the &quot;srutic&quot; evidence for the identity of &quot;jivanatman&quot; and Atman/Brahman. This meditation negates the misconceptions, false knowledge, and false ego-identity, rooted in &quot;maya&quot;, which obfuscate the ultimate truth of the oneness of Brahman, and one&#x27;s true identity as &quot;Atman/Brahman.&quot; This culminates in what Adi Shankara refers to as &quot;anubhava&quot;, immediate intuition, a direct awareness which is construction-free, and not construction-filled. It is not an awareness &quot;of&quot; Brahman, but instead an awareness that &quot;is&quot; Brahman. Although the threefold practice is broadly accepted in the Advaita tradition, and affirmed by Mandana Misra, it is at odds with Shankara, who took a subitist position.

&quot;Sruti&quot; (scriptures), proper reasoning and meditation are the main sources of knowledge (&quot;vidya&quot;) for the Advaita Vedānta tradition. It teaches that correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is achievable by &quot;svādhyāya&quot;, study of the self and of the Vedic texts, and three stages of practice: &quot;sravana&quot; (perception, hearing), &quot;manana&quot; (thinking) and &quot;nididhyasana&quot; (meditation), a three-step methodology that is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;.

According to critics of neo-Advaita, which also emphasizes direct insight, traditional Advaita Vedanta entails more than self-inquiry or bare insight into one&#x27;s real nature, but also includes self-restraint, textual studies and ethical perfection. It is described in classical Advaita books like Shankara&#x27;s Upadesasahasri and the Vivekachudamani, which is also attributed to Shankara.

==== Preparation: the fourfold qualities ====
The Advaita student has to develop the fourfold qualities, or behavioral qualifications (&quot;Samanyasa&quot;, &quot;Sampattis&quot;, &quot;sādhana-catustaya&quot;): A student in Advaita Vedānta tradition is required to develop these four qualities:
# &quot;&quot; (नित्यानित्य वस्तु विवेकम्) – Viveka is the ability to correctly discriminate between the real and eternal (&quot;nitya&quot;) and the substance that is apparently real, illusory, changing and transitory (&quot;anitya&quot;).
# &quot;&quot; (इहाऽमुत्रार्थ फल भोगविरागम्) – The renunciation (&quot;virāga&quot;) of all desires of the mind (bhoga) for sense pleasures, in this world (iha) and other worlds. Willing to give up everything that is an obstacle to the pursuit of truth and self-knowledge.
# &quot;&quot; (शमादि षट्क सम्पत्ति) – the sixfold virtues or qualities -
## &quot;Śama&quot; - mental tranquility, ability to focus the mind.
## &quot;Dama&quot; - self-restraint, the virtue of temperance. restraining the senses.
## &quot;Uparati&quot; - dispassion, lack of desire for worldly pleasures, ability to be quiet and disassociated from everything; discontinuation of all religious duties and ceremonies
## &quot;Titikṣa&quot; - endurance, perseverance, putting up with pairs of opposites (like heat and cold, pleasure and pain), ability to be patient during demanding circumstances
## &quot;Śraddhā&quot; - having faith in teacher and the Sruti scriptural texts
## &quot;Samādhāna&quot; - contentedness, satisfaction of mind in all conditions, attention, intentness of mind
# &quot;&quot; (मुमुक्षुत्वम्) – An intense longing for freedom, liberation and wisdom, driven to the quest of knowledge and understanding. Having moksha as the primary goal of life

==== The threefold practice: &quot;sravana&quot; (hearing), &quot;manana&quot; (thinking) and &quot;nididhyasana&quot; (meditation)====
The Advaita tradition teaches that correct knowledge, which destroys &quot;avidya&quot;, psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman, is obtained in &quot;jnanayoga&quot; through three stages of practice, &quot;sravana&quot; (hearing), &quot;manana&quot; (thinking) and &quot;nididhyasana&quot; (meditation). This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;:
* &quot;Sravana&quot;, which literally means hearing. The student listens and discusses the ideas, concepts, questions and answers. of the sages on the Upanishads and Advaita Vedānta, studying the Vedantic texts, such as the Brahma Sutras, aided by discussions with the guru (teacher, counsellor).
* &quot;Manana&quot; refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on &quot;svadhyaya&quot; and &quot;sravana&quot;. It is the stage of reflection on the teachings;
* &quot;Nididhyāsana&quot;, the stage of meditation and introspection. This stage of practice aims at realization and consequent conviction of the truths, non-duality and a state where there is a fusion of thought and action, knowing and being.

Although the threefold practice is broadly accepted in the Advaita tradition, Shankara&#x27;s works show an ambivalence toward it: while accepting its authenticity and merits, as it is based in the scriptures, he also takes a subitist position, arguing that &quot;moksha&quot; is attained at once when the &quot;mahavakyas&quot;, articulating the identity of &quot;Atman&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot;, are understood. According to Rambachan, &quot;it is not possible to reconcile Sankara&#x27;s views with this seemingly well-ordered system.&quot;

Mandana Misra, on the other hand, explicitly affirms the threefold practice as the means to acquire knowledge of Brahman, referring to meditation as &quot;dhyana&quot;. He states that these practices, though conceptual, &#x27;can eliminate both ignorance and coneptuality at the same time, leaving only the &quot;pure, transparent nature&quot; of self-awareness&#x27;.

Bilimoria states that these three stages of Advaita practice can be viewed as &quot;sadhana&quot; practice that unifies &quot;Yoga&quot; and &quot;Karma&quot; (&quot;action,&quot; referring here to ritual) ideas, and was most likely derived from these older traditions.

====Guru====
Advaita Vedānta school has traditionally had a high reverence for a Guru (teacher), and recommends that a competent Guru be sought in one&#x27;s pursuit of spirituality, though this is not mandatory. Reading of Vedic literature and reflection is the most essential practice. Adi Shankara, states Comans, regularly employed compound words &quot;such as &quot;Sastracaryopadesa&quot; (instruction by way of the scriptures and the teacher) and &quot;Vedāntacaryopadesa&quot; (instruction by way of the Upanishads and the teacher) to emphasize the importance of Guru&quot;. According to Comans, this reflects the Advaita tradition which holds a competent teacher as important and essential to gaining correct knowledge, freeing oneself from false knowledge, and to self-realization. Nevertheless, in the Bhamati-school the guru has a less essential role, as he can explain the teachings, but the student has to venture its further study.

A guru is someone more than a teacher, traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the &quot;guru&quot; serving as a &quot;counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student. The guru, states Joel Mlecko, is more than someone who teaches specific type of knowledge, and includes in its scope someone who is also a &quot;counselor, a sort of parent of mind and soul, who helps mold values and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life.&quot;

===&quot;Pramana&quot; (means of knowledge)===
In classical Indian thought, &quot;pramana&quot; (means of knowledge) concerns questions like how correct knowledge can be acquired; how one knows, how one doesn&#x27;t; and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired. In contrast to other schools of Indian philosophy, early Vedanta paid little attention to &quot;pramana&quot;. The &quot;Brahmasutras&quot; are not concerned with &quot;pramana&quot;, and &quot;pratyaksa&quot; (sense-perception) and &quot;anumana&quot; (inference) refer there to &quot;sruti&quot; and &quot;smriti&quot; respectively. Shankara recognized the means of knowledge, but his thematic focus was upon metaphysics and soteriology, and he took for granted the &quot;pramanas&quot;. For Shankara, &quot;sabda&quot; is the only means of knowledge for attaining &quot;Brahman-jnana&quot;. According to Sengaku Mayeda, &quot;in no place in his works [...] does he give any systematic account of them,&quot; taking &quot;Atman/Brahman&quot; to be self-evident (&quot;svapramanaka&quot;) and self-established (&quot;svatahsiddha&quot;), and &quot;an investigation of the means of knowledge is of no use for the attainment of final release.&quot;

Nevertheless, the Advaita tradition accepts altogether six kinds of . While Adi Shankara emphasized &quot;Śabda&quot; (शब्द), relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts with regard to religious insights, and also accepted &quot;pratyakṣa&quot; (प्रत्यक्षाय), perception; and &quot;anumāṇa&quot; (अनुमान), inference — Classical Advaita Vedānta, just like the Bhatta Purvamimamsaka school, also accepts &quot;upamāṇa&quot; (उपमान), comparison, analogy; &quot;arthāpatti&quot; (अर्थापत्ति), postulation, derivation from circumstances; and &quot;anupalabdhi&quot; (अनुपलब्धि), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof.

==== Samadhi ====
According to Dubois, Shankara&#x27;s Advaita emphasizes that, since Brahman is ever-present, Brahman-knowledge is immediate and requires no &#x27;action&#x27;, that is, striving and effort; yet, the contemporary Advaita tradition, which is a yogic Advaita synthesis which developed in the late mediaeval period, also prescribes elaborate preparatory practice, including yogic samadhi, posing a paradox which is also recognized in other spiritual disciplines and traditions.

Shankara regarded the &quot;srutis&quot; as the means of knowledge of Brahman, and he was ambivalent about yogic practices and meditation, which at best may prepare one for &quot;Brahma-jnana&quot;. According to Rambachan, criticising Vivekananda, Shankara states that the knowledge of Brahman can only be obtained from inquiry of the Shruti, and not by Yoga or samadhi, which at best can only silence the mind. The Bhamati school and the Vivarana school differed on the role of contemplation, but they both &quot;deny the possibility of perceiving supersensuous knowledge through popular yoga techniques.&quot; Later Advaita texts like the &quot;Dṛg-Dṛśya-Viveka&quot; (14th century) and &quot;Vedāntasara (of Sadananda)&quot; (15th century) added samādhi as a means to liberation, a theme that was also emphasized by Swami Vivekananda. The Vivekachudamani, traditionally attributed to Shankara but post-dating him, &quot;conceives of &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; as the premier method of Self-realization over and above the well-known vedantic discipline of listening, reflection and deep contemplation.&quot; Koller states that yogic concentration is an aid to gaining knowledge in Advaita.

==== &quot;Anubhava&quot; (&#x27;experience&#x27;) ====
The role of &quot;anubhava&quot;, &quot;anubhuti&quot; (&quot;experience,&quot; &quot;intuition&quot;) as &quot;experience&quot; in gaining &quot;Brahman-jnana&quot; is contested. While neo-Vedanta claims a central position for &quot;anubhava&quot; as &quot;experience,&quot; Shankara himself regarded reliance on textual authority as sufficient for gaining &quot;Brahman-jnana&quot;, &quot;the intuition of Brahman,&quot; and used &quot;anubhava&quot; interchangeably with &quot;pratipatta&quot;, &quot;understanding&quot;. Arvind Sharma argues that Shankara&#x27;s own &quot;direct experience of the ultimate truth&quot; guided him in selecting &quot;those passages of the scriptures that resonate with this experience and will select them as the key with which to open previously closed, even forbidden, doors.&quot;

The &quot;Vivekachudamani&quot; &quot;explicit[ly] declar[es] that experience (&quot;anubhuti&quot;) is a &quot;pramana&quot;, or means of knowing (VCM 59),&quot; and neo-Vedanta also accepts &quot;anubhava&quot; (&quot;personal experience&quot;) as a means of knowledge. Dalal and others state that &quot;anubhava&quot; does not center around some sort of &quot;mystical experience,&quot; but around the correct knowledge of Brahman. Nikhalananda concurs, stating that (knowledge of) &quot;Atman&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot; can only be reached by &quot;buddhi&quot;, &quot;reason,&quot; stating that mysticism is a kind of intuitive knowledge, while &quot;buddhi&quot; is the highest means of attaining knowledge.

====&quot;Adhyaropa Apavada&quot; - imposition and negation====
Since Gaudapada, who adopted the Buddhist four-cornered negation which negates any positive predicates of &#x27;the Absolute&#x27;, a central method in Advaita Vedanta to express the inexpressable is the method called &quot;Adhyaropa Apavada&quot;. In this method, which was highly estimated by Satchidanandendra Saraswati, a property is imposed (&quot;adhyaropa&quot;) on Atman to convince one of its existence, whereafter the imposition is removed (&quot;apavada&quot;) to reveal the true nature of Atman as nondual and undefinable. In this method, &quot;That which cannot be expressed is expressed through false attribution and subsequent denial.&quot; As Shankara writes, &quot;First let me bring them on the right path, and then I will gradually be able to bring them round to the final truth afterwards.&quot; For example, Atman, the real &quot;I,&quot; is described as witness, giving &quot;it&quot; an attribute to separate it from non-self. Since this implies a duality between observer and observed, next the notion of &quot;witness&quot; is dropped, by showing that the Self cannot be seen and is beyond qualifications, and only that what is remains, without using any words:
===The &quot;Mahavyakas&quot; - the identity of Ātman and Brahman ===
&quot;Moksha&quot;, liberation from suffering and rebirth and attaining immortality, is attained by disidentification from the body-mind complex and gaining self-knowledge as being in essence &quot;Atman&quot;, and attaining knowledge of the identity of &quot;Atman&quot; and Brahman. According to Shankara, the individual Ātman and Brahman seem different at the empirical level of reality, but this difference is only an illusion, and at the highest level of reality they are really identical. The real self is &quot;Sat&quot;, &quot;the Existent,&quot; that is, &quot;Atman/Brahman&quot;. Whereas the difference between Atman and non-Atman is deemed self-evident, knowledge of the identity of Atman and Brahman is revealed by the &quot;shruti&quot;, especially the Upanishadic statement &quot;tat tvam asi&quot;.

====&quot;Mahavakyas&quot;====
According to Shankara, a large number of Upanishadic statements reveal the identity of &quot;Atman&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot;. In the Advaita Vedanta tradition, four of those statements, the &quot;Mahavakyas&quot;, which are taken literal, in contrast to other statements, have a special importance in revealing this identity. They are:
* तत्त्वमसि, &quot;tat tvam asi&quot;, Chandogya VI.8.7. Traditionally rendered as &quot;That Thou Art&quot; (that you are), with &quot;tat&quot; in Ch.U.6.8.7 referring to &quot;sat&quot;, &quot;the Existent&quot;); correctly translated as &quot;That&#x27;s how [thus] you are,&quot; with &quot;tat&quot; in Ch.U.6.12.3, its original location from where it was copied to other verses, referring to &quot;the very nature of all existence as permeated by [the finest essence]&quot;
* अहं ब्रह्मास्मि, &quot;aham brahmāsmi&quot;, Brhadāranyaka I.4.10, &quot;I am Brahman,&quot; or &quot;I am Divine.&quot;
* प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म, &quot;prajñānam brahma&quot;, Aitareya V.3, &quot;&quot;Prajñānam&quot; &quot;is Brahman&quot;.&quot;
* अयमात्मा ब्रह्म, &quot;ayamātmā brahma&quot;, Mandukya II, &quot;This Atman is Brahman.&quot;

====&quot;That you are&quot;====
The longest chapter of Shankara&#x27;s &quot;Upadesasahasri&quot;, chapter 18, &quot;That Art Thou,&quot; is devoted to considerations on the insight &quot;I am ever-free, the existent&quot; (&quot;sat&quot;), and the identity expressed in Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7 in the &quot;mahavakya&quot; (great sentence) &quot;tat tvam asi&quot;, &quot;that thou art.&quot; In this statement, according to Shankara, &quot;tat&quot; refers to &quot;&#x27;Sat&quot;, &quot;the Existent&quot; Existence, Being, or Brahman, the Real, the &quot;Root of the world,&quot; the true essence or root or origin of everything that exists. &quot;Tvam&quot; refers to one&#x27;s real I, &quot;pratyagatman&quot; or inner Self, the &quot;direct Witness within everything,&quot; &quot;free from caste, family, and purifying ceremonies,&quot; the essence, &quot;Atman&quot;, which the individual at the core is. As Shankara states in the &quot;Upadesasahasri&quot;: 
The statement &quot;tat tvam asi&quot; sheds the false notion that &quot;Atman&quot; is different from &quot;Brahman&quot;. According toNakamura, the non-duality of &quot;atman&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot; &quot;is a famous characteristic of Sankara&#x27;s thought, but it was already taught by Sundarapandya&quot; (c.600 CE or earlier). Shankara cites Sundarapandya in his comments to &quot;Brahma Sutra&quot; verse I.1.4:
From this, and a large number of other accordances, Nakamura concludes that Shankar was not an original thinker, but &quot;a synthesizer of existing Advaita and the rejuvenator, as well as a defender, of ancient learning.&quot;

====Direct perception versus contemplation of the &quot;Mahavakyas&quot;====
In the &quot;Upadesasahasri Shankara&quot;, Shankara is ambivalent on the need for meditation on the Upanishadic &quot;mahavakya&quot;. He states that &quot;right knowledge arises at the moment of hearing,&quot; and rejects &quot;prasamcaksa&quot; or &quot;prasamkhyana&quot; meditation, that is, meditation on the meaning of the sentences, and in Up.II.3 recommends &quot;parisamkhyana&quot;, separating &quot;Atman&quot; from everything that is not &quot;Atman&quot;, that is, the sense-objects and sense-organs, and the pleasant and unpleasant things and merit and demerit connected with them. Yet, Shankara then concludes with declaring that only &quot;Atman&quot; exists, stating that &quot;all the sentences of the &quot;Upanishads&quot; concerning non-duality of &quot;Atman&quot; should be fully contemplated, should be contemplated.&quot; As Mayeda states, &quot;how they [&quot;prasamcaksa&quot; or &quot;prasamkhyana&quot; versus &quot;parisamkhyana&quot;] differ from each other in not known.&quot;

&quot;Prasamkhyana&quot; was advocated by Mandana Misra, the older contemporary of Shankara who was the most influential Advaitin until the 10th century. &quot;According to Mandana, the &quot;mahavakyas&quot; are incapable, by themselves, of bringing about &quot;brahmajnana&quot;. The &quot;Vedanta-vakyas&quot; convey an indirect knowledge which is made direct only by deep meditation (&quot;prasamkhyana&quot;). The latter is a continuous contemplation of the purport of the &quot;mahavakyas&quot;. Vācaspati Miśra, a student of Mandana Misra, agreed with Mandana Misra, and their stance is defended by the Bhamati-school, founded by Vācaspati Miśra. In contrast, the Vivarana school founded by Prakasatman (c. 1200–1300) follows Shankara closely, arguing that the &quot;mahavakyas&quot; are the direct cause of gaining knowledge.

Shankara&#x27;s insistence on direct knowledge as liberating also differs from the &quot;asparsa yoga&quot; described in Gaudapada&#x27;s &quot;Mandukyakarika&quot; III.39-46. In this practice of &#x27;non-contact&#x27; (&quot;a-sparśa&quot;), the mind is controlled and brought to rest, and does not create &quot;things&quot; (appearances) after which it grasps; it becomes non-dual, free from the subject-[grasping]-object dualism. Knowing that only &quot;Atman/Brahman&quot; is real, the creations of the mind are seen as false appearances (MK III.31-33). When the mind is brought to rest, it becomes or is &quot;Brahman&quot; (MK III.46).

====Renouncement of ritualism====
In the &quot;Upadesasahasri&quot; Shankara discourages ritual worship such as oblations to &quot;Deva&quot; (God), because that assumes the Self within is different from Brahman. The &quot;doctrine of difference&quot; is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, &quot;he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman&quot;. The false notion that &quot;Atman&quot; is different from &quot;Brahman&quot; is connected with the novice&#x27;s conviction that (&quot;Upadesasaharsi II.1.25&quot;)
Recognizing oneself as &quot;the Existent-&quot;Brahman&quot;,&quot; which is mediated by scriptural teachings, is contrasted with the notion of &quot;I act,&quot; which is mediated by relying on sense-perception and the like. According to Shankara, the statement &quot;Thou art That&quot; &quot;remove[s] the delusion of a hearer,&quot; &quot;so through sentences as &quot;Thou art That&quot; one knows one&#x27;s own &quot;Atman&quot;, the witness of all internal organs,&quot; and not from any actions. With this realization, the performance of rituals is prohibited, &quot;since [the use of] rituals and their requisites is contradictory to the realization of the identity [of &quot;Atman&quot;] with the highest &quot;Atman&quot;.&quot;

==Philosophy: Reality/truth (Brahman, sat) and the world==
Classical Advaita Vedānta states that all reality and everything in the experienced world has its root in Brahman, which is unchanging intelligent Consciousness. To Advaitins, there is no duality between a Creator and the created universe. All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness are somehow also this one fundamental reality Brahman. Yet, the knowing self has various experiences of reality during the waking, dream and dreamless states, and Advaita Vedānta acknowledges and admits that from the empirical perspective there are numerous distinctions. Advaita explains this by postulating different levels of reality, and by its theory of errors (&quot;anirvacaniya khyati&quot;).

===Darśana (view) – central concerns===

Vedānta is one of the six classical Hindu &quot;darśanas&quot;, the Indian traditions of religious philosophy and practice which accept the authority of the Vedas. The various schools of Vedanta aim to harmonise the diverging views presented in the &quot;Prasthantrayi&quot;, the Principal Upanishads, along with the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gitā, offering an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices which aim at the attainment of &quot;moksha&quot;, release or liberation from transmigratory existence. 

====Rejection of samkhya-dualism====

The Brahma Sutras, the constituting text of the Vedanta-tradition, rejects the &quot;purusha&quot;-&quot;prakriti&quot; dualism of the samkhya-tradition, and &quot;much of the &quot;Brahmasutra&quot; appears to have been written to refute the perspective of the Samkhya school.&quot; Samkhya postulates two independent primal principles, &quot;purusha&quot; (primal consciousness) and &quot;prakriti&quot; (nature, which includes both matter and cognition and emotions). In samkhya, &quot;prakriti&quot; consists of three qualities (&quot;Guṇas&quot;), which are in balance, until they come in contact with &quot;purusha&quot; and the equilibrium is disturbed. From this &quot;pradhana&quot; then evolves the material universe, distinct from &quot;purusha&quot;, thereby postulating &quot;purusha&quot; as the efficient cause of all existence, and &quot;prakriti&quot; as its material cause or origin.

While closely related to Samkhya, the Advaita Vedānta tradition rejects this dualism, instead stating that Reality cannot evolve from an inert, consciousness- and intelligence-less principle or essence. Brahman, which is intelligent and consciousness, is the sole Reality, &quot;that from which the origination, subsistence, and dissolution of this universe proceed,&quot; as stated in the second verse of the Brahman Sutras. In Samkhya, &quot;purusha&quot; is the efficient cause, and &quot;prakriti&quot; is the material cause: &quot;purusha&quot; causes &quot;prakriti&quot; to manifest as the natural world. Advaita, like all Vedanta schools, states that Brahman, consciousness, is both the efficient and the material cause, that from which the material universe evolves. Yet, in the Brahmasutras Brahma is a dynamic force, while the Advaita-tradition regards Brahman as an &quot;essentially unchanging and static reality,&quot; since Brahman changing into something else would mean that Brahman would not exist anymore, while a partial change would leave Brahman divided.

====Theoretical difficulties====
By accepting that Brahman is the sole, unchanging reality, various theoretical difficulties arise which are not answered by the Brahmasutras, which asserts that the Upanishadic views have to be accepted due to their scriptural authority, &quot;regardless of logical problems and philosophical inconsistencies.&quot; Advaita and other Vedānta traditions face several problems, for which they offer different solutions. According to Deutsch and Dalvi, &quot;The basic problem of Vedanta [is] the relation between the plural, complex, changing phenomenal world and the Brahman in which it substantially subsists.&quot; According to Mayeda, following the post-Shankara predicate &quot;sat-cit-ananda&quot;, three problems emerge. First, how did Brahman, which is &quot;sat&quot; (&#x27;existence&#x27;), without any distinction, become manifold material universe? Second, how did Brahman, which is &quot;cit&quot; (&#x27;consciousness&#x27;), create the material world? Third, if Brahman is &quot;ananda&quot; (&#x27;bliss&#x27;), why did the empirical world of sufferings arise? The Brahma Sutras do not answer these philosophical queries, and later Vedantins including Shankara had to resolve them.

To solve these questions, Shankara introduced the concept of &quot;Unevolved Name-and-Form,&quot; or primal matter corresponding to &quot;Prakriti&quot;, from which the world evolves, coming close to Samkhya dualism. Shankara&#x27;s notion of &quot;Unevolved Name-and-Form&quot; was not adopted by the later Advaita tradition; instead, the later tradition turned &quot;avidya&quot; into a metaphysical principle, namely &quot;mulavidya&quot; or &quot;root ignorance,&quot; a metaphysical substance which is the &quot;primal material cause of the universe (&quot;upadana&quot;).&quot; In this view, Brahman alone is real, and the phenomenal world is an appearance (&quot;maya&quot;) or &quot;an unreal manifestation (&quot;vivarta&quot;) of Brahman.&quot; Prakasatmans (13th c.) defense of &quot;vivarta&quot; to explain the origin of the world, which declared phenomenal reality to be an illusion, became the dominant explanation, with which the primacy of Atman/Brahman can be maintained.

====Relation between &quot;jivatman&quot; and Atman/Brahman====
A main question in all schools of Vedanta is the relation between the individual self (jiva) and &quot;Atman&quot;/&quot;Brahman&quot;. As Shankara and his followers regard Atman/Brahman to be the ultimate Real, &quot;jivanatman&quot; is &quot;ultimately [to be] of the nature of Atman/Brahman.&quot; This truth is established from a literal reading of selected parts of the oldest Principal Upanishads and Brahma Sutras, and is also found in parts of the Bhagavad Gitā and numerous other Hindu texts, and is regarded to be self-evident. Great effort is made to show the correctness of this reading, and its compatibility with reason and experience, by criticizing other systems of thought. &quot;Vidya&quot;, correct knowledge or understanding of the identity of jivan-ātman and Brahman, destroys or makes null &quot;avidya&quot; (&#x27;false knowledge&#x27;), and results in liberation.

===Three levels of Reality/truth===
Shankara proposes three levels of reality, using sublation as the ontological criterion:
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;paramartha&quot;, absolute), the Reality that is metaphysically true and ontologically accurate. It is the state of experiencing that &quot;which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved&quot;. This reality is the highest; it can&#x27;t be sublated (assimilated) by any other.
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;vyavahara&quot;), or &quot;samvriti-saya&quot;, consisting of the empirical or pragmatical reality. It is ever changing over time, thus empirically true at a given time and context but not metaphysically true. It is &quot;our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake&quot;. It is the level in which both &quot;jiva&quot; (living creatures or individual Selfs) and &quot;Iswara&quot; are true; here, the material world is also true but this is incomplete reality and is sublatable.
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;pratibhasika&quot;, apparent reality, unreality), &quot;reality based on imagination alone&quot;. It is the level of experience in which the mind constructs its own reality. Well-known examples of &quot;pratibhasika&quot; is the imaginary reality such as the &quot;roaring of a lion&quot; fabricated in dreams during one&#x27;s sleep, and the perception of a rope in the dark as being a snake.

Absolute and relative reality are valid and true in their respective contexts, but only from their respective particular perspectives. John Grimes explains this Advaita doctrine of absolute and relative truth with the example of light and darkness. From the sun&#x27;s perspective, it neither rises nor sets, there is no darkness, and &quot;all is light&quot;. From the perspective of a person on earth, sun does rise and set, there is both light and darkness, not &quot;all is light&quot;, there are relative shades of light and darkness. Both are valid realities and truths, given their perspectives. Yet, they are contradictory. What is true from one point of view, states Grimes, is not from another. To Advaita Vedānta, this does not mean there are two truths and two realities, but it only means that the same one Reality and one Truth is explained or experienced from two different perspectives.

As they developed these theories, Advaita Vedānta scholars were influenced by some ideas from the Nyaya, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy. These theories have not enjoyed universal consensus among Advaitins, and various competing ontological interpretations have flowered within the Advaita tradition.

===&quot;Pāramārthika&quot; - &quot;Sat&quot; (True Reality)===

====Ātman====

Ātman (IAST: ātman, Sanskrit: आत्मन्) is the &quot;real self&quot; or &quot;essence&quot; of the individual. It is &quot;caitanya&quot;, Pure Consciousness, a consciousness, states Sthaneshwar Timalsina, that is &quot;self-revealed, self-evident and self-aware (&quot;svaprakashata&quot;),&quot; and, states Payne, &quot;in some way permanent, eternal, absolute or unchanging.&quot; It is self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual. It is &quot;a stable subjectivity, or a unity of consciousness through all the specific states of individuated phenomenality.&quot; Ātman, states Eliot Deutsch, is the &quot;pure, undifferentiated, supreme power of awareness&quot;, it is more than thought, it is a state of being, that which is conscious and transcends subject-object divisions and momentariness. According to Ram-Prasad, &quot;it&quot; is not an object, but &quot;the irreducible essence of being [as] subjectivity, rather than an objective self with the quality of consciousness.&quot;

According to Shankara, it is self-evident and &quot;a matter not requiring any proof&quot; that Atman, the &#x27;I&#x27;, is &#x27;as different as light is from darkness&#x27; from non-Atman, the &#x27;you&#x27; or &#x27;that&#x27;, the material world whose characteristics are mistakenly superimposed on Atman, resulting in notions as &quot;I am this&quot; and &quot;This is mine.&quot; One&#x27;s real self is not the constantly changing body, not the desires, not the emotions, not the ego, nor the dualistic mind, but the introspective, inwardly self-conscious &quot;on-looker&quot; (&quot;saksi&quot;), which is in reality completely disconnected from the non-Atman.

The &quot;jivatman&quot; or individual self is a mere reflection of singular Atman in a multitude of apparent individual bodies. It is &quot;not an individual subject of consciousness,&quot; but the same in each person and identical to the universal eternal Brahman, a term used interchangeably with Atman.

&quot;Atman&quot; is often translated as soul, though the two concepts differ significantly, since &quot;soul&quot; includes mental activities, whereas &quot;Atman&quot; solely refers to detached witness-consciousness.

=====Three states of consciousness and Turiya=====
Advaita posits three states of consciousness, namely waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna), deep sleep (suṣupti), which are empirically experienced by human beings, and correspond to the Three Bodies Doctrine:
# The first state is the waking state, in which we are aware of our daily world. This is the gross body.
# The second state is the dreaming mind. This is the subtle body.
# The third state is the state of deep sleep. This is the causal body.

Advaita also posits &quot;the fourth,&quot; Turiya, which some describe as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness. Turiya is the state of liberation, where states Advaita school, one experiences the infinite (&quot;ananta&quot;) and non-different (&quot;advaita/abheda&quot;), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which ajativada, non-origination, is apprehended. According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all pervading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent in all things and transcendent. Those who have experienced the Turiya stage of self-consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with everyone and everything, for them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the &quot;Jivanmukta&quot;.

Advaita traces the foundation of this ontological theory in more ancient Sanskrit texts. For example, chapters 8.7 through 8.12 of Chandogya Upanishad discuss the &quot;four states of consciousness&quot; as awake, dream-filled sleep, deep sleep, and beyond deep sleep. One of the earliest mentions of &quot;Turiya&quot;, in the Hindu scriptures, occurs in verse 5.14.3 of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;. The idea is also discussed in other early Upanishads.

=====&quot;Svayam prakāśa&quot; (self-luminosity)=====


In the Advaita tradition, consciousness is svayam prakāśa, &quot;self-luminous,&quot; which means that &quot;self is pure awareness by nature.&quot; According to Dasgupta, it is &quot;the most fundamental concept of the Vedanta.&quot; According to T. R. V. Murti, the Vedanta concept is explained as follows:
According to Jonardon Ganeri, the concept was introduced by the Buddhist philosopher Dignāga (c.480–c.540 CE), and accepted by the Vedanta tradition; according to Zhihua Yao, the concept has older roots in the Mahasanghika school.

====Brahman====
According to Advaita Vedānta, Brahman is the true Self, consciousness, awareness, intelligent, possesed with will, and the only Reality (&quot;Sat&quot;). Brahman is &quot;Paramarthika Satyam&quot;, &quot;Absolute Truth&quot; or absolute Real. It is That which is unborn and unchanging, and immortal. Other than &quot;Brahman&quot;, everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya. Brahman is &quot;not sublatable&quot;, which means it cannot be superseded by a still higher reality:
In Advaita, Brahman is the substrate and cause of all changes. Refuting samkhya, which considers pradhana or prakriti the material cause (primal matter) and purusha the efficient cause, in Advaita Vedanta Brahman is considered to be the material cause and the efficient cause of all that exists. The Brahma Sutras I.1.2 state that Brahman is:
Advaita&#x27;s Upanishadic roots state Brahman&#x27;s qualities to be &quot;Sat-cit-ānanda&quot;, &quot;true being-consciousness-bliss,&quot; or &quot;Eternal Bliss Consciousness&quot;. A distinction is made between &quot;nirguna Brahman&quot;, formless Brahman, and &quot;saguna Brahman&quot;, Brahman with form, that is, &quot;Ishvara&quot;, God. &quot;Nirguna Brahman&quot; is undescribable, and the Upanishadic &quot;neti neti&quot; (&#x27;not this, not that&#x27; or &#x27;neither this, nor that&#x27;) negates all conceptualizations of Brahman.

===&quot;Vyāvahārika&quot; (conventional reality) – &quot;Avidya&quot; and &quot;&quot; ===

====&quot;Avidyā&quot; (ignorance)====
&quot;Avidyā&quot; is a central tenet of Shankara&#x27;s Advaita, and became the main target of Ramanuja&#x27;s criticism of Shankara. In Shankara&#x27;s view, avidyā is &quot;adhyasa&quot;, &quot;the superimposition of the qualities of one thing upon another.&quot; As Shankara explains in the &quot;Adhyasa-bhasya&quot;, the introduction to the &quot;Brahmasutrabhasya&quot;:
Due to &quot;avidya&quot;, we&#x27;re steeped in &quot;loka drsti&quot;, the empirical view. From the beginning we only perceive the empirical world of multiplicity, taking it to be the only and true reality. Due to avidyā there is ignorance, or nescience, of the real Self, &quot;Atman/Brahman&quot;, mistakenly identifying the Self with the body-mind complex. With &quot;parmartha drsti&quot; ignorance is removed and &quot;vidya&quot; is acquired, and the Real, distinctionless Brahman is perceived as the True reality.

The notion of avidyā and its relationship to Brahman creates a crucial philosophical issue within Advaita Vedānta thought: how can avidyā appear in Brahman, since Brahman is pure consciousness? For Shankara, &quot;avidya&quot; is a perceptual or psychological error. According to Satchidanandendra Saraswati, for Shankara &quot;&quot;avidya&quot; is only a technical name to denote the natural tendency of the human mind that is engaged in the act of superimposition.&quot; The later tradition diverged from Shankara by turning &quot;avidya&quot; into a metaphysical principle, namely &quot;mulavidya&quot; or &quot;root ignorance,&quot; a metaphysical substance which is the &quot;primal material cause of the universe (&quot;upadana&quot;),&quot; thereby setting aside Shankara&#x27;s &#x27;Unevolved Name-and-Form&#x27; as the explanation for the existence of materiality. According to Mayeda, &quot;[i]n order to save monism, they characterized &quot;avidya&quot; as indefinable as real or unreal (&quot;sadasadbhyam anirvacanya&quot;), belonging neither to the category of being nor to that of non-being.&quot; In the 20th century, this theory of &quot;mulavidya&quot; became a point of strong contention among Advaita Vedantins, with Satchidanandendra Saraswati arguing that Padmapada and Prakasatman had misconstrued Shanakara&#x27;s stance.

Shankara did not give a &#x27;location&#x27; of &quot;avidya&quot;, giving precedence to the removal of ignorance. Sengaku Mayeda writes, in his commentary and translation of Adi Shankara&#x27;s Upadesasahasri:
The later Advaita-tradition diverged from Shankara, trying to determinate a locus of &quot;avidya&quot;, with the Bhamati-school locating &quot;avidya&quot; in the &quot;jiva&quot; c.q. &quot;prakriti&quot;, while the Vivarana-school locates it in Brahman.

====&quot;&quot; (appearance)====
In Advaita Vedanta, the perceived empirical world, &quot;including people and other existence,&quot; is Māyā, &quot;appearance.&quot; Jiva, conditioned by the human mind, is subjected to experiences of a subjective nature, and misunderstands and interprets the physical, changing world as the sole and final reality. Due to &quot;avidya&quot;, we take the phenomenal world to be the final reality, while in Reality only &quot;Sat&quot; ( True Reality, Brahman) is Real and unchanging.

While Shankara took a realistic stance, and his explanations are &quot;remote from any connotation of illusion,&quot; the 13th century scholar Prakasatman, founder of the influential Vivarana school, introduced the notion that the world is illusory. According to Hacker, maya is not a prominent theme for Shankara, in contrast to the later Advaita tradition, and &quot;the word &quot;maya&quot; has for [Shankara] hardly any terminological weight.&quot;

====Five &quot;koshas&quot; (sheaths)====
Due to avidya, atman is covered by &quot;koshas&quot; (sheaths or bodies), which hide man&#x27;s true nature. According to the Taittiriya Upanishad, the Atman is covered by five koshas, usually rendered &quot;sheath&quot;. They are often visualized like the layers of an onion. From gross to fine the five sheaths are:
# Annamaya kosha, physical/food sheath
# Pranamaya kosha, life-force sheath
# Manomaya kosha, mental sheath
# Vijnanamaya kosha, discernment/wisdom sheath
# Anandamaya kosha, bliss sheath (&quot;Ananda&quot;)

===&quot;Parinamavada&quot; and &quot;vivartavada&quot; - causality and change ===
Cause and effect are an important topic in all schools of Vedanta. Two sorts of causes are recognised, namely , the efficient cause, that which causes the existence of the universe, and , the material cause, that from which the matery of this universe comes. All schools of Vedānta agree that Brahman is both the material and the efficient cause, and all subscribe to the theory of &quot;Satkāryavāda&quot;, which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause.

There are different views on the origination of the empirical world from Brahman. All commentators &quot;agree that Brahman is the cause of the world,&quot; but disagree on how exactly Brahman is the cause of the world. According to Nicholson, &quot;Mediaeval Vedantins distinguished two basic positions.&quot; &quot;Parinamavada&quot; is the idea that the world is a real transformation (&quot;parinama&quot;) of Brahman. &quot;Vivartavada&quot; is the idea that 


The &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, the ancient Vedantins, most sub-schools of Vedānta, as well as Samkhya argue for &quot;parinamavada&quot;. The &quot;most visible advocates of Vivartavada,&quot; states Nicholson, are the Advaitins, the followers of Shankara. &quot;Although the world can be described as conventionally real&quot;, adds Nicholson, &quot;the Advaitins claim that all of Brahman&#x27;s effects must ultimately be acknowledged as unreal before the individual self can be liberated&quot;.

Yet, Adi Shankara himself most likely explained causality through &quot;parinamavada&quot;. In Shankara&#x27;s works &quot;&quot;Brahman&quot; constitutes the basic essence (&quot;svabhava&quot;) of the universe (BS Bh 3.2.21) and as such the universe cannot be thought of as distinct from it (BS Bh 2.1.14).&quot; In Shankara&#x27;s view, then, &quot;The world is real, but only in so far as its existence is seen as totally dependent upon &quot;Brahman&quot;.&quot;

Shankara introduced the concept of &quot;Unevolved Name-and-Form,&quot; or primal matter corresponding to &quot;Prakriti&quot;, from which the world evolves, but this concept was not adopted by the later Advaita tradition. Vivartavada became the dominant explanation, with which the primacy of Atman/Brahman can be maintained. Scholars such as Hajime Nakamura and Paul Hacker already noted that Adi Shankara did not advocate &quot;Vivartavada&quot;, and his explanations are &quot;remote from any connotation of illusion&quot;.

It was the 13th century scholar Prakasatman, who founded the influential Vivarana school, who gave a definition to &quot;vivarta&quot;, introducing the notion that the world is illusory. It is Prakasatman&#x27;s theory that is sometimes misunderstood as Adi Shankara&#x27;s position. Andrew Nicholson concurs with Hacker and other scholars, adding that the &quot;vivarta-vada&quot; isn&#x27;t Shankara&#x27;s theory, that Shankara&#x27;s ideas appear closer to &quot;parinama-vada&quot;, and the &quot;vivarta&quot; explanation likely emerged gradually in Advaita subschool later.

==Ethics==
Some claim, states Deutsch, &quot;that Advaita turns its back on all theoretical and practical considerations of morality and, if not unethical, is at least &#x27;a-ethical&#x27; in character&quot;. However, Deutsch adds, ethics &quot;does&quot; have a firm place in this philosophy. Its ideology is permeated with ethics and value questions enter into every metaphysical and epistemological analysis, and it considers &quot;an independent, separate treatment of ethics are unnecessary&quot;. According to Advaita Vedānta, states Deutsch, there cannot be &quot;any absolute moral laws, principles or duties&quot;, instead in its axiological view Atman is &quot;beyond good and evil&quot;, and all values result from self-knowledge of the reality of &quot;distinctionless Oneness&quot; of one&#x27;s real self, every other being and all manifestations of Brahman. Advaitin ethics includes lack of craving, lack of dual distinctions between one&#x27;s own Self and another being&#x27;s, good and just Karma.

The values and ethics in Advaita Vedānta emanate from what it views as inherent in the state of liberating self-knowledge. This state, according to Rambachan, includes and leads to the understanding that &quot;the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self.&quot; Such knowledge and understanding of the indivisibility of one&#x27;s and other&#x27;s Atman, Advaitins believe leads to &quot;a deeper identity and affinity with all&quot;. It does not alienate or separate an Advaitin from his or her community, rather awakens &quot;the truth of life&#x27;s unity and interrelatedness&quot;. These ideas are exemplified in the Isha Upanishad – a &quot;sruti&quot; for Advaita, as follows:

Adi Shankara, in verse 1.25 to 1.26 of his &quot;Upadeśasāhasrī&quot;, asserts that the Self-knowledge is understood and realized when one&#x27;s mind is purified by the observation of Yamas (ethical precepts) such as Ahimsa (non-violence, abstinence from injuring others in body, mind and thoughts), Satya (truth, abstinence from falsehood), Asteya (abstinence from theft), Aparigraha (abstinence from possessiveness and craving) and a simple life of meditation and reflection. Rituals and rites can help focus and prepare the mind for the journey to Self-knowledge, but can be abandoned when moving on to &quot;hearing, reflection, and meditation on the Upanishads.&quot;

Elsewhere, in verses 1.26–1.28, the Advaita text Upadesasahasri states the ethical premise of equality of all beings. Any &quot;Bheda&quot; (discrimination), states Shankara, based on class or caste or parentage is a mark of inner error and lack of liberating knowledge. This text states that the fully liberated person understands and practices the ethics of non-difference.

==Texts==
The Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gitā and Brahma Sutras are the central texts of the Advaita Vedānta tradition, lending authority to the doctrines about the identity of &quot;Atman&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot; and their changeless nature.

Adi Shankara gave a nondualist interpretation of these texts in his commentaries. Adi Shankara&#x27;s &quot;Bhashya&quot; (commentaries) have become central texts in the Advaita Vedānta philosophy, but are one among many ancient and medieval manuscripts available or accepted in this tradition. The subsequent Advaita tradition has further elaborated on these sruti and commentaries. Adi Shankara is also credited for the famous text Nirvana Shatakam.

===&quot;Prasthanatrayi&quot;===
The &quot;Vedānta&quot; tradition provides exegeses of the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, and the &quot;Bhagavadgita&quot;, collectively called the &quot;Prasthanatrayi&quot;, literally, &quot;three sources&quot;.
# The &quot;Upanishads&quot;, or &quot;Śruti prasthāna&quot;; considered the &quot;&quot; (Vedic scriptures) foundation of &quot;Vedānta&quot;. Most scholars, states Eliot Deutsch, are convinced that the Śruti in general, and the Upanishads in particular, express &quot;a very rich diversity&quot; of ideas, with the early &quot;Upanishads&quot; such as &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; and &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot; being more readily amenable to &quot;Advaita Vedānta&quot; school&#x27;s interpretation than the middle or later &quot;Upanishads&quot;. In addition to the oldest &quot;Upanishads&quot;, states Williams, the &quot;Sannyasa Upanishads&quot; group composed in pre-&quot;Shankara&quot; times &quot;express a decidedly &quot;Advaita&quot; outlook&quot;.
# The &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, or &quot;Nyaya prasthana&quot; / &quot;Yukti prasthana&quot;; considered the reason-based foundation of &quot;Vedānta&quot;. The &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; attempted to synthesize the teachings of the &quot;Upanishads&quot;. The diversity in the teachings of the &quot;Upanishads&quot; necessitated the systematization of these teachings. The only extant version of this synthesis is the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; of &quot;Badarayana&quot;. Like the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; is also an aphoristic text, and can be interpreted as a non-theistic &quot;Advaita Vedānta&quot; text or as a theistic &quot;Dvaita Vedānta&quot; text. This has led, states Stephen Phillips, to its varying interpretations by scholars of various sub-schools of &quot;Vedānta&quot;. The &quot;Brahmasutra&quot; is considered by the Advaita school as the &quot;Nyaya Prasthana&quot; (canonical base for reasoning).
# The &quot;Bhagavad Gitā&quot;, or &quot;Smriti prasthāna&quot;; considered the &quot;Smriti&quot; (remembered tradition) foundation of &quot;Vedānta&quot;. It has been widely studied by &quot;Advaita&quot; scholars, including a commentary by &quot;Adi Shankara&quot;.

===Textual authority===
The Advaita Vedānta tradition considers the knowledge claims in the Vedas to be the crucial part of the Vedas, not its &quot;karma-kanda&quot; (ritual injunctions). The knowledge claims about self being identical to the nature of &quot;Atman/Brahman&quot; are found in the Upanishads, which Advaita Vedānta has regarded as &quot;errorless revealed truth.&quot; Nevertheless, states Koller, Advaita Vedantins did not entirely rely on revelation, but critically examined their teachings using reason and experience, and this led them to investigate and critique competing theories.

Advaita Vedānta, like all orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, accepts as an epistemic premise that Śruti (Vedic literature) is a reliable source of knowledge. The Śruti includes the four Vedas including its four layers of embedded texts – the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the early Upanishads. Of these, the Upanishads are the most referred to texts in the Advaita school.

The possibility of different interpretations of the Vedic literature, states Arvind Sharma, was recognized by ancient Indian scholars. The Brahmasutra (also called Vedānta Sutra, composed in 1st millennium BCE) accepted this in verse 1.1.4 and asserts the need for the Upanishadic teachings to be understood not in piecemeal cherrypicked basis, rather in a unified way wherein the ideas in the Vedic texts are harmonized with other means of knowledge such as perception, inference and remaining pramanas. This theme has been central to the Advaita school, making the Brahmasutra as a common reference and a consolidated textual authority for Advaita.

The Bhagavad Gitā, similarly in parts can be interpreted to be a monist Advaita text, and in other parts as theistic Dvaita text. It too has been widely studied by Advaita scholars, including a commentary by Adi Shankara.

===Other texts===
A large number of texts are attributed to Shankara; of these texts, the Brahma Sutra Bhasya (commentary on the Brahma Sutras), the commentaries on the principal Upanishads, and the Upadesasahasri are considered genuine and stand out.

Post-Shankara Advaita saw the composition of both scholarly commentaries and treatises, as well as, from late mediaeval times (14th century) on, popular works and compositions which incorporate Yoga ideas. These include notable texts mistakenly attributed to Shankara, such as the Vivekachudamani, Atma bodha, and Aparokshanubhuti; and other texts like Advaita Bodha Deepika and Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka. Texts which influenced the Advaita tradition include the Avadhuta Gita, the Yoga Vasistha, and the Yoga Yajnavalkya.

==Sampradaya and Smarta tradition==

===Monastic order - Mathas===

Advaita Vedānta is not just a philosophical system, but also a tradition of renunciation. Philosophy and renunciation are closely related:

According to tradition, around 740 AD Gaudapada founded Shri Gaudapadacharya Math, also known as . It is located in Kavale, Ponda, Goa, and is the oldest matha of the South Indian Saraswat Brahmins.

Shankara, himself considered to be an incarnation of Shiva, is credited with establishing the Dashanami Sampradaya, organizing a section of the Ekadandi monks under an umbrella grouping of ten names. Several Hindu monastic and Ekadandi traditions, however, remained outside the organisation of the Dasanāmis.

Sankara is said to have organised the Hindu monks of these ten sects or names under four (Sanskrit: ) (monasteries), called the &quot;Amnaya Mathas&quot;, with the headquarters at Dvārakā in the West, Jagannatha Puri in the East, Sringeri in the South and Badrikashrama in the North. According to tradition, each math was first headed by one of his four main disciples, and the tradition continues since then. Yet, according to Paul Hacker, no mention of the &quot;mathas&quot; can be found before the 14th century CE. Until the 15th century, the timespan of the directors of Sringeri Math are unrealistically long, spanning 60+ and even 105 years. After 1386, the timespans become much shorter. According to Hacker, these mathas may have originated as late as the 14th century, to propagate Shankara&#x27;s view of Advaita. According to another tradition in Kerala, after Sankara&#x27;s samadhi at Vadakkunnathan Temple, his disciples founded four mathas in Thrissur, namely Naduvil Madhom, Thekke Madhom, Idayil Madhom and Vadakke Madhom.

Monks of these ten orders differ in part in their beliefs and practices, and a section of them is not considered to be restricted to specific changes attributed to Shankara. While the dasanāmis associated with the Sankara maths follow the procedures attributed to Adi Śankara, some of these orders remained partly or fully independent in their belief and practices; and outside the official control of the Sankara maths. The advaita sampradaya is not a Saiva sect, despite the historical links with Shaivism. Nevertheless, contemporary Sankaracaryas have more influence among Saiva communities than among Vaisnava communities.

===Smarta Tradition===
The Smarta tradition of Hinduism is a synthesis of various strands of Indian religious thought and practice, which developed with the Hindu synthesis, dating back to the early first century CE. It is particularly found in south and west India, and revers all Hindu divinities as a step in their spiritual pursuit. Their worship practice is called &quot;Panchayatana puja&quot;. The worship symbolically consists of five deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Devi or Durga, Surya and an Ishta Devata or any personal god of devotee&#x27;s preference.

In the Smarta tradition, Advaita Vedānta ideas combined with bhakti are its foundation. Adi Shankara is regarded as the greatest teacher and reformer of the Smarta. According to Alf Hiltebeitel, Shankara&#x27;s Advaita Vedānta and practices became the doctrinal unifier of previously conflicting practices with the &quot;smarta&quot; tradition.

Philosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all images and statues (murti), or just five marks or any anicons on the ground, are visibly convenient icons of spirituality &quot;saguna Brahman&quot;. The multiple icons are seen as multiple representations of the same idea, rather than as distinct beings. These serve as a step and means to realizing the abstract Ultimate Reality called nirguna Brahman. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, then follow a philosophical and meditative path to understanding the oneness of Atman (Self) and Brahman – as &quot;That art Thou&quot;.

==Buddhist influences on Advaita Vedānta==

===Similarities with Buddhism===
Advaita Vedānta and other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology, doctrines, and dialectical techniques with Buddhism. According to a 1918 paper by the Buddhist scholar O. Rozenberg, &quot;a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw.&quot; T. R. V. Murti notices that &quot;the ultimate goal&quot; of Vedānta, Sāṃkhya, and Mahāyāna Buddhism is &quot;remarkably similar&quot;; while Advaita Vedānta postulates a &quot;foundational self&quot;, according to Murti &quot;Mahāyāna Buddhism implicitly affirms the existence of a deep underlying reality behind all empirical manifestations in its conception of &quot;śūnyatā&quot; (the indeterminate, the void), or &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot; (consciousness only), or &quot;tathātā&quot; (thatness), or &quot;dhārmata&quot; (noumenal reality).&quot; According to Frank Whaling, the similarities between Advaita Vedānta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, but also includes practice. The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita Vedānta are similar to those found in Buddhism.

===Mahāyāna philosophy===
The influence of Mahāyāna Buddhism on Advaita Vedānta has been significant. Sharma points out that the early commentators on the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; were all realists, or pantheist realists. He states that they were influenced by Buddhism, particularly during the 5th–6th centuries CE with the development of the Yogācāra school of Buddhist philosophy. Von Glasenapp states that there was a mutual influence between Vedānta and Buddhism. S. N. Dasgupta and Mohanta suggest that Buddhism and Advaita Vedānta represent &quot;different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Śaṅkara.&quot;

The influence of Buddhist doctrines on Gauḍapāda has been a vexed question. Modern scholarship generally accepts that Gauḍapāda was influenced by Buddhism, at least in terms of using Buddhist terminology to explain his ideas, but adds that Gauḍapāda was a Vedantin and not a Buddhist. Ādi Śaṅkara, states Natalia Isaeva, incorporated &quot;into his own system a Buddhist notion of &quot;māyā&quot; which had not been minutely elaborated in the Upanishads&quot;. According to Mudgal, Śaṅkara&#x27;s Advaita view and Nāgārjuna&#x27;s Mādhyamaka view of ultimate reality are compatible because they are both transcendental, indescribable, non-dual and only arrived at through a &quot;via negativa&quot; or &quot;neti neti&quot;. Mudgal concludes therefore that &quot;the difference between Śūnyavāda philosophy of Buddhism and Advaita philosophy of Hinduism may be a matter of emphasis, not of kind&quot;. Similarly, there are many points of contact between the Buddhist Yogācāra school and Śaṅkara&#x27;s Advaita tradition. According to S. N. Dasgupta,
===Differences from Buddhism===
The Advaita Vedānta tradition has historically rejected accusations of crypto-Buddhism highlighting their respective views on &quot;Ātman&quot;, &quot;Anattā&quot;, and &quot;Brahman&quot;. Yet, some early Buddhist texts (1st millennium CE), such as the Mahāyāna Buddhist scriptures &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtras&quot; suggest &quot;self-like&quot; concepts, variously called &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; or &quot;Buddha nature&quot;. In modern era studies, scholars such as Wayman state that these &quot;self-like&quot; concepts are neither self nor sentient being, nor individual soul, nor personality. Some scholars posit that the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtras&quot; were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.

The epistemological foundations of Buddhism and Advaita Vedānta are different. Buddhism accepts two valid means to reliable and correct knowledge—perception and inference, while Advaita Vedānta accepts six (described elsewhere in this article). However, some Buddhists in history, have argued that Buddhist scriptures are a reliable source of spiritual knowledge, corresponding to Advaita&#x27;s &quot;Śabda&quot; pramana, however Buddhists have treated their scriptures as a form of inference method.

Advaita Vedānta posits a substance ontology, an ontology which holds that underlying the change and impermanence of empirical reality is an unchanging and permanent absolute reality, like an eternal substance it calls &quot;Ātman/Brahman&quot;. In its substance ontology, as like other philosophies, there exist a universal, particulars, and specific properties, and it is the interaction of particulars that create events and processes. In contrast, Buddhism posits a process ontology, also called as &quot;event ontology&quot;. According to Buddhist philosophy, particularly after the rise of ancient Mahāyāna Buddhist scholarship, the concept of impermanence (&quot;anicca&quot;) is understood as one of the three marks of existence (&quot;trilakṣaṇa&quot;): there is neither empirical nor absolute permanent reality, because all phenomena are characterized by their lack of a solid and independent existence (&quot;svabhāva&quot;), and ontology can be explained as a process.

In Buddhist ontology, there is a system of dependent origination and interdependent phenomena (&quot;pratītya-samutpāda&quot;) but no stable persistent identities, neither eternal universals nor particulars. In Buddhism, thoughts and memories are mental constructions and fluid processes (&quot;skandhā&quot;) without a real observer, personal agent, or cognizer (&quot;anattā&quot;). By contrast, in Advaita Vedānta and the other orthodox schools of Hinduism, the eternal, unchanging ultimate self (&quot;ātman&quot;) identical with &quot;Brahman&quot; is understood as the real observer, personal agent, and cognizer. However, the historical Buddha considered this Brahmanical belief to be one of the six wrong views about the self; in fact, Buddha held that attachment to the appearance of a permanent self in this world of change is the cause of suffering (&quot;duḥkha&quot;), and the main obstacle to the attainment of spiritual liberation (&quot;mokṣa&quot;).

===Criticisms of concurring Hindu schools===
Some Hindu scholars have criticized Advaita Vedānta for its notion of &quot;māyā&quot; and non-theistic doctrinal similarities with Buddhism, sometimes referring to the Advaita tradition as &quot;Māyāvāda&quot;.

Bhāskara, a Hindu philosopher of the Bhedabheda Vedānta school (9th century CE), accused Śaṅkara&#x27;s Advaita tradition as &quot;this despicable broken down &quot;Māyāvāda&quot; that has been chanted by the Mahāyāna Buddhists&quot;, characterizing it as a school that is undermining the ritual duties set in Vedic orthodoxy.

Rāmāṉuja, a Hindu saint and founder of the Vishishtadvaita Vedānta school (12th century CE), similarly accused Ādi Śaṅkara of being a &quot;Prachanna Bauddha&quot;, that is, a &quot;crypto-Buddhist&quot;, and someone who was undermining the theistic Bhakti-oriented devotionalism.

==Relationship with other traditions==
The Advaita Vedānta ideas, particularly of 8th century Adi Shankara, were challenged by theistic Vedānta philosophies that emerged centuries later, such as the 11th-century Vishishtadvaita (qualified nondualism) of Ramanuja, and the 14th-century Dvaita (theistic dualism) of Madhvacharya. Their application of Vedanta philosophy to ground their faith turned Vedanta into a major factor in India&#x27;s religious landscape.

===Vishishtadvaita===
Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita school and Shankara&#x27;s Advaita school are both nondualism Vedānta schools, both are premised on the assumption that all Selfs can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya and his Dvaita subschool of Vedānta believed that some Selfs are eternally doomed and damned. Shankara&#x27;s theory posits that only Brahman and causes are metaphysical unchanging reality, while the empirical world (Maya) and observed effects are changing, illusive and of relative existence. Spiritual liberation to Shankara is the full comprehension and realization of oneness of one&#x27;s unchanging Atman (Self) as the same as Atman in everyone else as well as being identical to the &quot;nirguna&quot; Brahman. In contrast, Ramanuja&#x27;s theory posits both Brahman and the world of matter are two different absolutes, both metaphysically real, neither should be called false or illusive, and &quot;saguna&quot; Brahman with attributes is also real. God, like man, states Ramanuja, has both soul and body, and all of the world of matter is the glory of God&#x27;s body. The path to Brahman (Vishnu), asserted Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of personal god (&quot;saguna&quot; Brahman, Vishnu), one which ultimately leads one to the oneness with &quot;nirguna&quot; Brahman.

===Shuddhadvaita===
Vallabhacharya (1479–1531 CE), the proponent of the philosophy of Shuddhadvaita Brahmvad enunciates that Ishvara has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Maya (which itself is his power) and manifests Himself through the world. That is why shuddhadvaita is known as &#x27;Unmodified transformation&#x27; or &#x27;Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda&#x27;. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual Selfs and the world. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a &#x27;part&#x27; (but devoid of bliss).

===Dvaita===
Madhvacharya was also a critic of Advaita Vedānta. Advaita&#x27;s nondualism asserted that Atman (Self) and Brahman are identical (both in bondage and liberation), there is interconnected oneness of all Selfs and Brahman, and there are no pluralities. Madhva in contrast asserted that Atman (Self) and Brahman are different (both in bondage and liberation), only Vishnu is the Lord (Brahman), individual Selfs are also different and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities. Madhvacharya stated that both Advaita Vedānta and Mahayana Buddhism were a nihilistic school of thought. Madhvacharya wrote four major texts, including &quot;Upadhikhandana&quot; and &quot;Tattvadyota&quot;, primarily dedicated to criticizing Advaita.

Followers of ISKCON are highly critical of Advaita Vedānta, regarding it as &quot;māyāvāda&quot;, identical to Mahayana Buddhism.

===Influence on other traditions===
Within the ancient and medieval texts of Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, the ideas of Advaita Vedānta have had a major influence. Advaita Vedānta influenced Krishna Vaishnavism in the different parts of India. One of its most popular text, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, adopts and integrates in Advaita Vedānta philosophy. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; is generally accepted by scholars to have been composed in the second half of 1st millennium CE.

In the ancient and medieval literature of Shaivism, called the &quot;Āgamas&quot;, the influence of Advaita Vedānta is once again prominent. Of the 92 &quot;Āgamas&quot;, ten are &quot;Dvaita&quot; texts, eighteen are &quot;Bhedabheda&quot;, and sixty-four are &quot;Advaita&quot; texts. According to Natalia Isaeva, there is an evident and natural link between 6th-century Gaudapada&#x27;s Advaita Vedānta ideas and Kashmir Shaivism.

Shaktism, the Hindu tradition where a goddess is considered identical to Brahman, has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of Advaita Vedānta and dualism premises of Samkhya–Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as &quot;Shaktadavaitavada&quot; (literally, the path of nondualistic &quot;Shakti&quot;).

Other influential ancient and medieval classical texts of Hinduism such as the &quot;Yoga Yajnavalkya&quot;, &quot;Yoga Vashishta&quot;, &quot;Avadhuta Gitā&quot;, &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot; and &quot;Sannyasa Upanishads&quot; predominantly incorporate premises and ideas of Advaita Vedānta.

==History of Advaita Vedānta==

===Historiography===
The historiography of Advaita Vedanta is coloured by Orientalist notions, while modern formulations of Advaita Vedānta, which developed as a reaction to western Orientalism and Perennialism have &quot;become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought.&quot; According to Michael S. Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan, &quot;scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedānta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.&quot;

===Early Vedānta===
The Upanishads form the basic texts, of which Vedānta gives an interpretation. The Upanishads do not contain &quot;a rigorous philosophical inquiry identifying the doctrines and formulating the supporting arguments&quot;. This philosophical inquiry was performed by the darsanas, the various philosophical schools.

The Brahma Sutras of Bādarāyana, also called the &quot;Vedānta Sutra&quot;, were compiled in its present form around 400–450 CE, but &quot;the great part of the &quot;Sutra&quot; must have been in existence much earlier than that&quot;. Estimates of the date of Bādarāyana&#x27;s lifetime differ between 200 BCE and 200 CE. The Brahma Sutra is a critical study of the teachings of the Upanishads, possibly &quot;written from a Bhedābheda Vedāntic viewpoint.&quot; Bādarāyana was not the first person to systematise the teachings of the Upanishads. He refers to seven Vedantic teachers before him.

===Early Advaita Vedānta===
Two Advaita writings predating Maṇḍana Miśra and Shankara were known to scholars such as Nakamura in the first half of 20th-century, namely the &quot;Vākyapadīya&quot;, written by Bhartṛhari (second half 5th century), and the &quot;Māndūkya-kārikā&quot; written by Gauḍapāda (7th century). Later scholarship added the Sannyasa Upanishads (first centuries CE) to the earliest known corpus, some of which are of a sectarian nature, and have a strong Advaita Vedānta outlook.

According to Nakamura, &quot;there must have been an enormous number of other writings turned out in this period [between the Brahma Sutras and Shankara], but unfortunately all of them have been scattered or lost and have not come down to us today&quot;. In his commentaries, Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his Sampradaya. In the beginning of his commentary on the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad Shankara salutes the teachers of the Brahmavidya Sampradaya. Pre-Shankara doctrines and sayings can be traced in the works of the later schools, which does give insight into the development of early Vedānta philosophy.

==== Gauḍapāda and &quot;&quot; ====
According to tradition, Gauḍapāda (6th century) was the teacher of Govinda Bhagavatpada and the grandteacher of Shankara. Gauḍapāda wrote or compiled the &#x27;, also known as the &#x27; or the &#x27;. The &#x27; is a commentary in verse form on the &quot;Māṇḍūkya Upanishad&quot;, one of the shortest Upanishads consisting of just 13 prose sentences. Of the ancient literature related to Advaita Vedānta, the oldest surviving complete text is the &quot;Māṇḍukya Kārikā&quot;. The &quot;Māṇḍūkya Upanishad&quot; was considered to be a Śruti before the era of Adi Shankara, but not treated as particularly important. In later post-Shankara period its value became far more important, and regarded as expressing the essence of the Upanishad philosophy. The entire &quot;Karika&quot; became a key text for the Advaita school in this later era.

Gaudapada took over the Yogachara teaching of &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot;, &quot;representation-only,&quot; which states that the empirical reality that we experience is a fabrication of the mind, experienced by consciousness-an-sich, and the four-cornered negation, which negates any positive predicates of &#x27;the Absolute&#x27;. Gaudapada &quot;wove [both doctrines] into the philosophy of &quot;Mandukaya Upanisad&quot;, which was further developed by Shankara&quot;. In this view,
Gauḍapāda uses the concepts of Ajātivāda to explain that &#x27;the Absolute&#x27; is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is &quot;aja&quot;, the unborn eternal. The empirical world of appearances is considered unreal, and not absolutely existent.

===Early medieval period - Maṇḍana Miśra and Adi Shankara ===

====Maṇḍana Miśra====
Maṇḍana Miśra, an older contemporary of Shankara, was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of Kumarila, but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the &quot;Brahma-siddhi&quot;. According to Fiordalis, he was influenced by the Yoga-tradition, and with that indirectly by Buddhism, given the strong influence of Buddhism on the Yoga-tradition. For a couple of centuries he seems to have been regarded as &quot;the most important representative of the Advaita position,&quot; and the &quot;theory of error&quot; set forth in the &quot;Brahma-siddhi&quot; became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error.

====Adi Shankara====

Very little is known about Shankara. According to Dalal, &quot;Hagiographical accounts of his life, the &quot;Śaṅkaravijayas&quot; (&quot;Conquests of Śaṅkara&quot;), were composed several centuries after his death,&quot; in the 14th to 17th century, and established Shankara as a rallying symbol of values in a time when most of India was conquered by Muslims. He is often considered to be the founder of the Advaita Vedānta school, but was actually a systematizer, not a founder.

=====Systematizer of Advaita thought=====
Shankara was a scholar who synthesized and systematized &quot;Advaita-vāda&quot; thought which already existed at his lifetime. According to Nakamura, comparison of the known teachings of the early Vedantins and Shankara&#x27;s thought shows that most of the characteristics of Shankara&#x27;s thought &quot;were advocated by someone before Śankara&quot;. According to Nakamura, after the growing influence of Buddhism on Vedānta, culminating in the works of Gauḍapāda, Adi Shankara gave a Vedantic character to the Buddhistic elements in these works, synthesising and rejuvenating the doctrine of Advaita. According to Koller, using ideas in ancient Indian texts, Shankara systematized the foundation for Advaita Vedānta in the 8th century, reforming Badarayana&#x27;s Vedānta tradition. According to Mayeda, Shankara represents a turning point in the development of Vedānta, yet he also notices that it is only since Deussens&#x27;s praise that Shankara &quot;has usually been regarded as the greatest philosopher of India.&quot; Mayeda further notes that Shankara was primarily concerned with &quot;moksha&quot;, &quot;and not with the establishment of a complete system of philosophy or theology,&quot; following Potter, who qualifies Shankara as a &quot;speculative philosopher.&quot; Lipner notes that Shankara&#x27;s &quot;main literary approach was commentarial and hence perforce disjointed rather than procedurally systematic [...] though a systematic philosophy can be derived from Samkara&#x27;s thought.&quot;

=====Writings=====
Adi Shankara is best known for his reviews and commentaries (&quot;Bhasyas&quot;) on ancient Indian texts. His &quot;Brahmasutrabhasya&quot; (literally, commentary on Brahma Sutra) is a fundamental text of the Vedānta school of Hinduism. His commentaries on ten Mukhya (principal) Upanishads are also considered authentic by scholars. Other authentic works of Shankara include commentaries on the Bhagavad Gitā (part of his Prasthana Trayi Bhasya). He also authored Upadesasahasri, his most important original philosophical work. The authenticity of Shankara being the author of has been questioned, and &quot;modern scholars tend to reject its authenticity as a work by Shankara.&quot;

=====Influence of Shankara=====
While Shankara has an unparalleled status in the history of Advaita Vedanta, scholars have questioned the traditional narrative of Shankara&#x27;s early influence in India. Until the 10th century Shankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary Maṇḍana Miśra, who was considered to be the major representative of Advaita. Only when Vacaspati Misra, an influential student of Maṇḍana Miśra, harmonised the teachings of Shankara with those of Maṇḍana Miśra, Shankara&#x27;s teachings gained prominence. Some modern Advaitins argue that most of post-Shankara Advaita Vedanta actually deviates from Shankara, and that only his student Suresvara, who&#x27;s had little influence, represents Shankara correctly. In this view, Shankara&#x27;s influential student Padmapada misunderstood Shankara, while his views were manitained by the Suresvara school. According to Satchidanandendra Sarasvati, &quot;almost all the later Advaitins were influenced by Mandana Misra and Bhaskara.&quot; Until the 11th century, Vedanta itself was a peripheral school of thought; Vedanta became a major influence when Vedanta philosophy was utilized by various sects of Hinduism to ground their doctrines, such as Ramanuja (11th c.), who aligned bhakti, &quot;the major force in the religions of Hinduism,&quot; with philosophical thought, meanwhile rejecting Shankara&#x27;s views.

The cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedanta started only centuries later, in the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century, when Sringeri &quot;matha&quot; started to receive patronage from the kings of the Vijayanagara Empire and became a powerful institution. Vidyaranya, also known as Madhava, who was the Jagadguru of the Śringeri Śarada Pītham from ca. 1374–1380 to 1386 played a central role in this growing influence of Advaita Vedanta, and the deification of Shankara as a ruler-renunciate. From 1346 onwards Sringeri &quot;matha&quot; received patronage from the Vijayanagara kings, and its importance and influence grew rapidly in the second half of the 14th century. Vidyaranya and the Sringeri matha competed for royal patronage and converts with Srivaisnava &quot;Visistadvaita&quot;, which was dominant in territories conquered by the Vijayanagara Empire, and Madhava (the pre-ordination name of Vidyaranya) presented Shankara&#x27;s teachings as the summit of all &quot;darsanas&quot;, portraying the other &quot;darsanas&quot; as partial truths which converged in Shankara&#x27;s teachings. The subsequent &quot;Shankara Digvijayam&quot; genre, following the example of the earlier &quot;Madhva Digvijayam&quot;, presented Shankara as a ruler-renunciate, conquering the four quarters of India and bringing harmony. The genre created legends to turn Shankara into a &quot;divine folk-hero who spread his teaching through his &quot;digvijaya&quot; (&quot;universal conquest&quot;) all over India like a victorious conqueror.&quot;

Shankara&#x27;s position was further established in the 19th and 20th century, when neo-Vedantins and western Orientalists, following Vidyaranya, elevated Advaita Vedanta &quot;as the connecting theological thread that united Hinduism into a single religious tradition.&quot; Shankara became &quot;an iconic representation of Hindu religion and culture,&quot; despite the fact that most Hindus do not adhere to Advaita Vedanta.

====Advaita Vedanta sub-schools====
Two defunct schools are the &quot;Pancapadika&quot; and &quot;Istasiddhi&quot;, which were replaced by Prakasatman&#x27;s Vivarana school. The still existing Bhāmatī and Vivarana developed in the 11th-14th century. These schools worked out the logical implications of various Advaita doctrines. Two of the problems they encountered were the further interpretations of the concepts of māyā and avidya.

Padmapada (c. 800 CE), the founder of the defunct Pancapadika school, was a direct disciple of Shankara. He wrote the &quot;Pancapadika&quot;, a commentary on the &quot;Sankara-bhaya&quot;. Padmapada diverged from Shankara in his description of &quot;avidya&quot;, designating &quot;prakrti&quot; as &quot;avidya&quot; or &quot;ajnana&quot;.

Sureśvara (fl. 800–900 CE) was a contemporary of Shankara, and often (incorrectly) identified with Maṇḍana Miśra. Sureśvara has also been credited as the founder of a pre-Shankara branch of Advaita Vedānta.

Mandana Mishra&#x27;s student Vachaspati Miśra (9th/10th century CE), who is believed to have been an incarnation of Shankara to popularize the Advaita view, wrote the &quot;Bhamati&quot;, a commentary on Shankara&#x27;s &quot;Brahma Sutra Bhashya&quot;, and the &quot;Brahmatattva-samiksa&quot;, a commentary on Mandana Mishra&#x27;s &quot;Brahma-siddhi&quot;. His thought was mainly inspired by Mandana Miśra, and harmonises Shankara&#x27;s thought with that of Mandana Miśra. The Bhamati school takes an ontological approach. It sees the Jiva as the source of avidya. It sees contemplation as the main factor in the acquirement of liberation, while the study of the Vedas and reflection are additional factors.

Vimuktatman (c. 1200 CE) wrote the &quot;Ista-siddhi&quot;. It is one of the four traditional &quot;siddhi&quot;, together with Mandana&#x27;s &quot;Brahma-siddhi&quot;, Suresvara&#x27;s &quot;Naiskarmya-siddhi&quot;, and Madusudana&#x27;s &quot;Advaita-siddhi&quot;. According to Vimuktatman, absolute Reality is &quot;pure intuitive consciousness&quot;. His school of thought was eventually replaced by Prakasatman&#x27;s Vivarana school.

Prakasatman (c. 1200–1300) wrote the &quot;Pancapadika-Vivarana&quot;, a commentary on the &quot;Pancapadika&quot; by Padmapadacharya. The &quot;Vivarana&quot; lends its name to the subsequent school. According to Roodurmun, &quot;[H]is line of thought [...] became the leitmotif of all subsequent developments in the evolution of the Advaita tradition.&quot; The Vivarana school takes an epistemological approach. It is distinguished from the &quot;Bhamati&quot; school by its rejection of action and favouring Vedic study and &quot;a direct apprehension of Brahma.&quot; Prakasatman was the first to propound the theory of &quot;mulavidya&quot; or &quot;maya&quot; as being of &quot;positive beginningless nature&quot;, and sees Brahman as the source of avidya. Critics object that Brahman is pure consciousness, so it cannot be the source of avidya. Another problem is that contradictory qualities, namely knowledge and ignorance, are attributed to Brahman.

Another late figure which is widely associated with Advaita and was influential on late Advaita thought was Śrīharṣa.

===Late medieval India - yogic Advaita===
Michael S. Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan note that Shankara is very well-studied, but &quot;scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedānta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.&quot;

While indologists like Paul Hacker and Wilhelm Halbfass took Shankara&#x27;s system as the measure for an &quot;orthodox&quot; Advaita Vedānta, the living Advaita Vedānta tradition in medieval times was influenced by, and incorporated elements from, the yogic tradition and texts like the &quot;Yoga Vasistha&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;. Yoga and samkhya had become minor schools of thought since the time of Shankara, and no longer posed a thread for the sectarian identity of Advaita, in contrast to the Vaishnava traditions.

The &quot;Yoga Vasistha&quot; became an authoritative source text in the Advaita vedānta tradition in the 14th century, and the &quot;yogic Advaita&quot; of Vidyāraņya&#x27;s &quot;Jivanmuktiviveka&quot; (14th century) was influenced by the &quot;(Laghu-)Yoga-Vasistha&quot;, which in turn was influenced by Kashmir Shaivism. Vivekananda&#x27;s 19th century emphasis on &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; was preceded by medieval yogic influences on Advaita Vedānta. In the 16th and 17th centuries, some Nath and hatha yoga texts also came within the scope of the developing Advaita Vedānta tradition.

According to Andrew Nicholson, it was with the arrival of Islamic rule, first in the form of Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire, and the subsequent persecution of Indian religions, that Hindu scholars began a self-conscious attempts to define an identity and unity. Between the twelfth and the fourteenth century, this effort emerged with the &quot;astika and nastika&quot; schema of classifying Indian philosophy.

==== Vidyāraṇya ====
It is only during this period that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedanta was established. Advaita Vedanta&#x27;s position as most influential Hindu &quot;darsana&quot; took shape as Advaitins in the Vijayanagara Empire competed for patronage from the royal court, and tried to convert others to their sect. Sringeri &quot;matha&quot; started to receive patronage from the kings of the Vijayanagara Empire who shifted their allegiance from &quot;Advaitic&quot; Agamic Shaivism to Brahmanical Advaita orthodoxy.

Central in this repositioning was Vidyāraṇya, also known as Madhava, who was the Jagadguru of the Śringeri Śarada Pītham from 1380 to 1386 and a minister in the Vijayanagara Empire. He inspired the re-creation of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire of South India, in response to the devastation caused by the Islamic Delhi Sultanate, but his efforts were also targeted at Srivaisnava groups, especially &quot;Visistadvaita&quot;, which was dominant in territories conquered by the Vijayanagara Empire. Sects competed for patronage from the royal court, and tried to convert others to their own sectarian system, and Vidyaranya efforts were aimed at promoting Advaita Vedanta. Most of Shankara&#x27;s biographies were created and published from the 14th to the 17th century, such as the widely cited &quot;Śankara-vijaya&quot;, in which legends were created to turn Shankara into a &quot;divine folk-hero who spread his teaching through his &quot;digvijaya&quot; (&quot;universal conquest&quot;) all over India like a victorious conqueror.&quot;

Vidyaranya and his brothers wrote extensive Advaitic commentaries on the Vedas and Dharma to make &quot;the authoritative literature of the Aryan religion&quot; more accessible. In his doxography &quot;Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha&quot; (&quot;Summary of all views&quot;) Vidyaranya presented Shankara&#x27;s teachings as the summit of all &quot;darsanas&quot;, presenting the other &quot;darsanas&quot; as partial truths which converged in Shankara&#x27;s teachings, which was regarded to be the most inclusive system. The Vaishanava traditions of Dvaita and Visitadvaita were not classified as Vedanta, and placed just above Buddhism and Jainism, reflecting the threat they posed for Vidyaranya&#x27;s Advaita allegiance. Bhedabheda wasn&#x27;t mentioned at all, &quot;literally written out of the history of Indian philosophy.&quot; Vidyaranya became head of Sringeri &quot;matha&quot;, proclaiming that it was established by Shankara himself. Vidyaranya enjoyed royal support, and his sponsorship and methodical efforts helped establish Shankara as a rallying symbol of values, spread historical and cultural influence of Shankara&#x27;s Vedānta philosophies, and establish monasteries (&quot;mathas&quot;) to expand the cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedānta.

=== Modern Advaita ===

==== Niścaldās and &quot;Greater&quot; Advaita ====
Michael S. Allen has written on the influence and popularity of Advaita Vedanta in early modern north India, especially on the work of the Advaita Dādū-panthī monk Niścaldās (ca. 1791–1863), author of &quot;The Ocean of Inquiry&quot; (Hindi: Vichāra-sāgara), a vernacular compendium of Advaita. According to Allen, the work of Niścaldās &quot;was quite popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: it was translated into over eight languages and was once referred to by Vivekananda as having &#x27;more influence in India than any [book] that has been written in any language within the last three centuries.&#x27;&quot;

Allen highlights the widespread prominence in early modern India of what he calls &quot;Greater Advaita Vedānta&quot; which refers to popular Advaita works, including &quot;narratives and dramas, “eclectic” works blending Vedānta with other traditions, and vernacular works such as &quot;The Ocean of Inquiry&quot;.&quot; Allen refers to several popular late figures and texts which draw on Advaita Vedanta, such as the Maharashtrian sant Eknāth (16th c.), the popular &quot;Adhyātma-rāmāyaṇa&quot; (ca. late 15th c.), which synthesizes Rama bhakti and advaita metaphysics and the &quot;Tripurā-rahasya&quot; (a tantric text that adopts an advaita metaphysics). Other important vernacular Advaita figures include the Hindu authors Manohardās and Māṇakdās (who wrote the Ātma-bodh). Advaita literature was also written in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, and Oriya.

====Neo-Vedanta====

According to King, with the consolidation of the British imperialist rule the new rulers started to view Indians through the &quot;colonially crafted lenses&quot; of Orientalism. In response Hindu nationalism emerged, striving for socio-political independence and countering the influence of Christian missionaries. Among the colonial era intelligentsia the monistic Advaita Vedānta has been a major ideological force for Hindu nationalism, with Hindu intellectuals formulating a &quot;humanistic, inclusivist&quot; response, now called Neo-Vedānta, attempting to respond to this colonial stereotyping of &quot;Indian culture [as] backward, superstitious and inferior to the West.&quot;

Due to the influence of Vidyaranya&#x27;s &quot;Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha&quot;, early Indologists regarded Advaita Vedanta as the most accurate interpretation of the Upanishads. Vedānta came to be regarded, both by westerners as by Indian nationalists, as the essence of Hinduism, and Advaita Vedānta came to be regarded as &quot;then paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion&quot; and umbrella of &quot;inclusivism&quot;. Colonial era Indian thinkers, such as Vivekananda, presented Advaita Vedānta as an inclusive universal religion, a spirituality that in part helped organize a religiously infused identity. It also aided the rise of Hindu nationalism as a counter weight to Islam-infused Muslim communitarian organizations such as the Muslim League, to Christianity-infused colonial orientalism and to religious persecution of those belonging to Indian religions. Neo-Vedānta subsumed and incorporated Buddhist ideas thereby making the Buddha a part of the Vedānta tradition, all in an attempt to reposition the history of Indian culture. This view on Advaita Vedānta, according to King, &quot;provided an opportunity for the construction of a nationalist ideology that could unite Hindus in their struggle against colonial oppression&quot;.

Vivekananda discerned a universal religion, regarding all the apparent differences between various traditions as various manifestations of one truth. Vivekananda emphasised &quot;nirvikalpa&quot; samadhi as the spiritual goal of Vedānta, he equated it to the liberation in Yoga and encouraged Yoga practice which he called &quot;Raja yoga&quot;. With the efforts of Vivekananda, modern formulations of Advaita Vedānta have &quot;become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought&quot;, though Hindu beliefs and practices are diverse.

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, first a professor at Oxford University and later a President of India, further popularized Advaita Vedānta, presenting it as the essence of Hinduism. According to Michael Hawley, Radhakrishnan saw other religions, as well as &quot;what Radhakrishnan understands as lower forms of Hinduism,&quot; as interpretations of Advaita Vedānta, thereby &quot;in a sense Hindusizing all religions&quot;. Radhakrishnan metaphysics was grounded in Advaita Vedānta, but he reinterpreted Advaita Vedānta for contemporary needs and context.

Mahatma Gandhi declared his allegiance to Advaita Vedānta, and was another popularizing force for its ideas.

====Contemporary Advaita Vedānta====
Contemporary teachers are the orthodox Jagadguru of Sringeri Sharada Peetham; the more traditional teachers Sivananda Saraswati (1887–1963), Chinmayananda Saraswati (1916-1993), Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya) (1930-2015), Swami Paramarthananda, Swami Tattvavidananda Sarasvati, Carol Whitfield (Radha), Sri Vasudevacharya (previously Michael Comans) and less traditional teachers such as Narayana Guru. According to Sangeetha Menon, prominent names in 20th century Advaita tradition are Shri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswami, Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Swamigal, Sacchidānandendra Saraswati.

====Influence on new religious movements====
Advaita Vedānta has gained attention in western spirituality and New Age as nondualism, where various traditions are seen as driven by the same non-dual experience. Nonduality points to &quot;a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object&quot;. It is also used to refer to interconnectedness, &quot;the sense that all things are interconnected and not separate, while at the same time all things retain their individuality&quot;.

Neo-Advaita is a new religious movement based on a popularised, western interpretation of Advaita Vedānta and the teachings of Ramana Maharshi. Notable neo-advaita teachers are H. W. L. Poonja, his students Gangaji Andrew Cohen, and Eckhart Tolle.

<text>The ecological footprint measures human demand on natural capital, i.e. the quantity of nature it takes to support people and their economies. It tracks human demand on nature through an ecological accounting system. The accounts contrast the biologically productive area people use to satisfy their consumption to the biologically productive area available within a region, nation, or the world (biocapacity). Biocapacity is the productive area that can regenerate what people demand from nature. Therefore, the metric is a measure of human impact on the environment. As Ecological Footprint accounts measure to what extent human activities operate within the means of our planet, they are a central metric for sustainability.

The metric is promoted by the Global Footprint Network which has developed standards to make results comparable. FoDaFo, supported by Global Footprint Network and York University are now providing the national assessments of Footprints and biocapacity.

Footprint and biocapacity can be compared at the individual, regional, national or global scale. Both footprint and demands on biocapacity change every year with number of people, per person consumption, efficiency of production, and productivity of ecosystems. At a global scale, footprint assessments show how big humanity&#x27;s demand is compared to what Earth can renew. Global Footprint Network estimates that, as of 2022, humanity has been using natural capital 71% faster than Earth can renew it, which they describe as meaning humanity&#x27;s ecological footprint corresponds to 1.71 planet Earths. This overuse is called ecological overshoot.

Ecological footprint analysis is widely used around the world in support of sustainability assessments. It enables people to measure and manage the use of resources throughout the economy and explore the sustainability of individual lifestyles, goods and services, organizations, industry sectors, neighborhoods, cities, regions, and nations.

== Overview ==
The ecological footprint concept and calculation method was developed as the PhD dissertation of Mathis Wackernagel, in collaboration with his supervisor William Rees at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, from 1990 to 1994. The first academic publication about ecological footprints was written by William Rees in 1992. Originally, Wackernagel and Rees called the concept &quot;appropriated carrying capacity&quot;. To make the idea more accessible, Rees came up with the term &quot;ecological footprint&quot;, inspired by a computer technician who praised his new computer&#x27;s &quot;small footprint on the desk&quot;. In 1996, Wackernagel and Rees published the book &quot;Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing Human Impact on the Earth&quot;.

The simplest way to define an ecological footprint is the amount of environmental resources necessary to produce the goods and services that support an individual&#x27;s lifestyle, a nation&#x27;s prosperity, or the economic activity of humanity as a whole.
The model is a means of comparing lifestyles, per capita consumption, and population numbers, and checking these against biocapacity. The tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more (or less) than is available within its territory, or to what extent the nation&#x27;s lifestyle and population density would be replicable worldwide. The footprint can be a useful tool to educate people about overconsumption and overpopulation, with the aim of altering personal behavior or public policies. Ecological footprints may be used to argue that current lifestyles and human numbers are not sustainable. Country-by-country comparisons show the inequalities of resource use on this planet.

The touristic ecological footprint (TEF) is the ecological footprint of visitors to a particular destination, and depends on the tourists&#x27; behavior. Comparisons of TEFs can indicate the benefits of alternative destinations, modes of travel, food choices, types of lodging, and activities.

The carbon footprint is a component of the total ecological footprint. Often, when only the carbon footprint is reported, it is expressed in weight of  (or CO2e representing GHG warming potential (GGWP)), but it can also be expressed in land areas like ecological footprints. Both can be applied to products, people, or whole societies.

==Methodology==

Ecological footprint accounting is built on the recognition that regenerative resources are the physically most limiting resources of all. Even fossil fuel use is far more limited by the amount of sequestration the biosphere can provide rather than by the amounts left underground. The same is true for ores and minerals, where the limiting factor is how much damage to the biosphere we are willing to accept to extract and concentrate those materials, rather than by how much of them is still left underground. Therefore, the focus of ecological footprint accounting is human competition for regenerative resources.

The amount of the planet&#x27;s regeneration, including how many resources are renewed and how much waste it the planet can absorb, is dubbed biocapacity. Ecological footprints therefore track how much biocapacity is needed to provide for all the inputs that human activities demand. It can be calculated at any scale: for an activity, a person, a community, a city, a region, a nation, or humanity as a whole.

Footprints can be split into consumption categories: food, housing, and goods and services. Or it can be organized by are types occupied: cropland, pasture, forests for forest products, forests for carbon sequestration, marine areas, etc.

When this approach is applied to an activity such as the manufacturing of a product or driving a car, it uses data from life-cycle analysis. Such applications translate the consumption of energy, biomass (food, fiber), building material, water and other resources into normalized land areas called global hectares (gha) needed to provide these inputs.

Since the Global Footprint Network&#x27;s inception in 2003, it has calculated the ecological footprint from UN data sources for the world as a whole and for over 200 nations (known as the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts). This task has now been taken over by FoDaFo and York University. The total footprint number of Earths needed to sustain the world&#x27;s population at that level of consumption are also calculated. Every year the calculations are updated to the latest year with complete UN statistics. The time series are also recalculated with every update, since UN statistics sometimes correct historical data sets. Results are available on an open data platform.

Lin &quot;et al.&quot; (2018) find that the trends for countries and the world have stayed consistent despite data updates. In addition, a recent study by the Swiss Ministry of Environment independently recalculated the Swiss trends and reproduced them within 1–4% for the time period that they studied (1996–2015). Since 2006, a first set of ecological footprint standards exist that detail both communication and calculation procedures. The latest version are the updated standards from 2009.

The ecological footprint accounting method at the national level is described on the website of the Global Footprint Network or in greater detail in academic papers, including Borucke &quot;et al.&quot;

The National Accounts Review Committee has published a research agenda on how to improve the accounts.

==Footprint measurements==

For 2023 Global Footprint Network estimated humanity&#x27;s ecological footprint as 1.71 planet Earths. According to their calculations this means that humanity&#x27;s demands were 1.71 times more than what the planet&#x27;s ecosystems renewed.

If this rate of resource use is not reduced, persistent overshoot would suggest the occurrence of continued ecological deterioration and a potentially permanent decrease in Earth&#x27;s human carrying capacity.    

In 2022, the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately 1.6 global hectares (gha) per capita. The U.S. footprint per person was 7.5 gha, and that of Switzerland was 3.7 gha, that of China 3.6 gha, and that of India 1.0 gha. In its Living Planet Report 2022, the WWF documents a 69% decline in the world&#x27;s vertebrate populations between 1970 and the present, and links this decline to humanity greatly exceeding global biocapacity. Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the 6 billion people on Earth at that time was about 1.3 hectares per person, which is smaller than the 1.6 global hectares published for 2024, because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas.

According to the 2018 edition of the &quot;National footprint accounts&quot;, humanity&#x27;s total ecological footprint has exhibited an increasing trend since 1961, growing an average of 2.1% per year (SD= 1.9). Humanity&#x27;s ecological footprint was 7.0 billion gha in 1961 and increased to 20.6 billion gha in 2014, a function of higher per capita resource use and population increase. The world-average ecological footprint in 2014 was 2.8 global hectares per person. The carbon footprint is the fastest growing part of the ecological footprint and accounts currently for about 60% of humanity&#x27;s total ecological footprint.

The Earth&#x27;s biocapacity has not increased at the same rate as the ecological footprint. The increase of biocapacity averaged at only 0.5% per year (SD = 0.7). Because of agricultural intensification, biocapacity was at 9.6 billion gha in 1961 and grew to 12.2 billion gha in 2016.

However, this increased biocapacity for people came at the expense of other species. Agricultural intensification involved increased fertilizer use which led to eutrophication of streams and ponds; increased pesticide use which decimated pollinator populations; increased water withdrawals which decreased river health; and decreased land left wild or fallow which decreased wildlife populations on agricultural lands. This reminds us that ecological footprint calculations are anthropocentric, assuming that all Earth&#x27;s biocapacity is legitimately available to human beings. If we assume that some biocapacity should be left for other species, the level of ecological overshoot increases.  

According to Wackernagel and the organisation he has founded, the Earth has been in &quot;overshoot&quot;, where humanity is using more resources and generating waste at a pace that the ecosystem cannot renew, since the 1970s. According to the Global Footprint Network&#x27;s calculations, currently people use Earth&#x27;s resources at approximately 171% of capacity. This implies that humanity is well over Earth&#x27;s human carrying capacity at current levels of affluence. According to the GFN:In 2023, Earth Overshoot Day fell on August 2nd. Earth Overshoot Day marks the date when humanity has exhausted nature&#x27;s budget for the year. For the rest of the year, we are maintaining our ecological deficit by drawing down local resource stocks and accumulating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We are operating in overshoot. Currently, more than 85% of humanity lives in countries that run an ecological deficit. This means their citizens use more resources and generate more waste and pollution than can be sustained by the biocapacity found within their national boundaries. In some cases, countries are running an ecological deficit because their per capita ecological footprints are higher than the hectares of bioproductive land available on average globally (this was estimated at &lt;1.7 hectares per person in 2019). Examples include France, Germany and Saudi Arabia. In other cases, per capita resource use may be lower than the global available average, but countries are running an ecological deficit because their populations are high enough that they still use more bioproductive land than they have within their national borders. Examples include China, India and the Philippines. Finally, many countries run an ecological deficit because of both high per capita resource use and large populations; such countries tend to be way over their national available biocapacities. Examples include Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

According to William Rees, writing in 2011, &quot;the average world citizen has an eco-footprint of about 2.7 global average hectares while there are only 2.1 global hectare of bioproductive land and water per capita on earth. This means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 30% and now lives unsustainabily by depleting stocks of &#x27;natural capital&#x27;.&quot;

Since then, due to population growth and further refinements in the calculations, available biocapacity per person has decreased to &lt;1.7 hectares per person globally. More recently, Rees has written:The human enterprise is in potentially disastrous &#x27;overshoot&#x27;, exploiting the ecosphere beyond ecosystems&#x27; regenerative capacity and filling natural waste sinks to overflowing. Economic behavior that was once &#x27;rational&#x27; has become maladaptive. This situation is the inevitable outcome of humanity&#x27;s natural expansionist tendencies reinforced by ecologically vacuous growth-oriented &#x27;neoliberal&#x27; economic theory.Rees now believes that economic and demographic degrowth are necessary to create societies with small enough ecological footprints to remain sustainable and avoid civilizational collapse.

== Footprint by country ==

The world-average ecological footprint in 2013 was 2.8 global hectares per person. The average per country ranges from 14.3 (Qatar) to 0.5 (Yemen) global hectares per person. There is also a high variation within countries, based on individual lifestyles and wealth.

In 2022, countries with the top ten per capita ecological footprints were: Qatar (14.3 global hectares), Luxembourg (13.0), Cook Islands (8.3), Bahrain (8.2), United States (8.1), United Arab Emirates (8.1), Canada (8.1), Estonia (8.0), Kuwait (7.9) and Belize (7.9).
Total ecological footprint for a nation is found by multiplying its per capita ecological footprint by its total population. Total ecological footprint ranges from 5,540,000,000 global hectares used (China) to 145,000 (Cook Islands) global hectares used. In 2022, the top ten countries in total ecological footprint were: China (5.54 billion global hectares), United States (2.66 billion), India (1.64 billion), Russian Federation (774 million), Japan (586 million), Brazil (542 million), Indonesia (460 million), Germany (388 million), Republic of Korea (323 million) and Mexico (301 million). These were the ten nations putting the greatest strain on global ecosystem services.

The Western Australian government State of the Environment Report included an Ecological Footprint measure for the average Western Australian seven times the average footprint per person on the planet in 2007, a total of about 15 hectares.

The figure (right) examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN Human Development Index (a measure of standard of living). The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable. As always, population growth has a marked influence on total consumption and production, with larger populations becoming less sustainable. Most countries around the world continue to become more populous, although a few seem to have stabilized or are even beginning to shrink. The information generated by reports at the national, regional and city scales confirm the global trend towards societies becoming less sustainable over time.

===Studies in the United Kingdom===
The UK&#x27;s average ecological footprint is 5.45 global hectares per capita (gha) with variations between regions ranging from 4.80 gha (Wales) to 5.56 gha (East England).

BedZED, a 96-home mixed-income housing development in South London, was designed by Bill Dunster Architects and sustainability consultants BioRegional for the Peabody Trust. Despite being populated by relatively average people, BedZED was found to have a footprint of 3.20 gha per capita (not including visitors), due to on-site renewable energy production, energy-efficient architecture, and an extensive green lifestyles program that included London&#x27;s first carsharing club. Findhorn Ecovillage, a rural intentional community in Moray, Scotland, had a total footprint of 2.56 gha per capita, including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community. However, the residents alone had a footprint of 2.71 gha, a little over half the UK national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized world. Keveral Farm, an organic farming community in Cornwall, was found to have a footprint of 2.4 gha, though with substantial differences in footprints among community members.

==Ecological footprint at the individual level==
In a 2012 study of consumers acting &#x27;green&#x27; vs. &#x27;brown&#x27; (where green people are &quot;expected to have significantly lower ecological impact than &#x27;brown&#x27; consumers&quot;), &quot;the research found no significant difference between the carbon footprints of green and brown consumers&quot;. A 2013 study concluded the same.

==Reviews and critiques==
Early criticism was published by van den Bergh and Verbruggen in 1999, which was updated in 2014. Their colleague Fiala published similar criticism in 2008.

A comprehensive review commissioned by the Directorate-General for the Environment (European Commission) was published in June 2008. The European Commission&#x27;s review found the concept unique and useful for assessing progress on the EU&#x27;s Resource Strategy. They also recommended further improvements in data quality, methodologies and assumptions.

Blomqvist &quot;et al.&quot;. published a critical paper in 2013. It led to a reply from Rees and Wackernagel (2013), and a rejoinder by Blomqvist &quot;et al.&quot; (2013).

An additional strand of critique is from Giampietro and Saltelli (2014), with a reply from Goldfinger et al., 2014, and a rejoinder by Giampietro and Saltelli (2014). A joint paper authored by the critical researchers (Giampietro and Saltelli) and proponents (various Global Footprint Network researchers) summarized the terms of the controversy in a paper published by the journal Ecological Indicators. Additional comments were offered by van den Bergh and Grazi (2015).

A number of national government agencies have performed collaborative or independent research to test the reliability of the ecological footprint accounting method and its results. They have largely confirmed the accounts&#x27; results; those who reproduced the assessment generating near-identical results. Such reviews include those of Switzerland, Germany, France, Ireland, the United Arab Emirates and the European Commission.

Global Footprint Network has summarized methodological limitations and criticism in a comprehensive report available on its website.

Similarly, Newman (2006) has argued that the ecological footprint concept may have an anti-urban bias, as it does not consider the opportunities created by urban growth. He argues that calculating the ecological footprint for densely populated areas, such as a city or small country with a comparatively large population—e.g. New York and Singapore respectively—may lead to the perception of these populations as &quot;parasitic&quot;. But in reality, ecological footprints just document the resource dependence of cities on rural hinterlands. Critics argue that this is a dubious characterization, since farmers in developed nations may easily consume more resources than urban inhabitants, due to transportation requirements and the unavailability of economies of scale. Furthermore, such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for autarky. But this is similar to blaming a scale for the user&#x27;s dietary choices. Even if true, such criticisms do not negate the value of measuring different cities&#x27;, regions&#x27;, or nations&#x27; ecological footprints and comparing them. Such assessments can provide helpful insights into the success or failure of different environmental policies.

Since this metric tracks biocapacity, the replacement of original ecosystems with high-productivity agricultural monocultures can lead to attributing a higher biocapacity to such regions. For example, replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may therefore decrease the ecological footprint. Similarly if organic farming yields were lower than those of conventional methods, this could result in the former being &quot;penalized&quot; with a larger ecological footprint. Complementary biodiversity indicators attempt to address this. The WWF&#x27;s Living Planet Report combines the footprint calculations with the Living Planet Index of biodiversity. A modified ecological footprint that takes biodiversity into account has been created for use in Australia.

Ecological footprint for many years has been used by environmentalists as a way to quantify ecological degradation as it relates to an individual. Recently, there has been debate about the reliability of this method.

<text>Menno Simons (; ; 1496 – 31 January 1561) was a Roman Catholic priest from the Friesland region of the Low Countries who was excommunicated from the Catholic Church and became an influential Anabaptist religious leader. Simons was a contemporary of the Protestant Reformers and it is from his name that his followers became known as Mennonites.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Menno Simons was born in 1496 in Witmarsum, Friesland, Holy Roman Empire. Very little is known concerning his childhood and family except that he grew up in a poor peasant environment. His father&#x27;s name was Simon, Simons being a patronym, and he had a brother named Pieter.

Simons grew up in a disillusioned war-torn country. Friesland was ravaged by war in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Landsknecht soldiers haunted the Frisian lands in the 1490s to force the &#x27;Free&#x27; Frisians to accept the Duke of Saxony-Meissen as their head of state. The duke was the governor of the Netherlands for the Habsburg family. One of the archenemies of the Habsburgs, the Duke of Guelders, invaded Friesland in 1515 and conquered half of it. Saxony ceded the other half to the Habsburgs. The Frisians tried to regain their freedom but they were too weak and eventually accepted the imperial authority of the Habsburg emperor Charles V.

Simons learned Latin and some Greek, and he was taught about the Latin Church Fathers during his training to become a priest. He had never read the Bible, either before or during his training for the priesthood, out of fear that he would be adversely influenced by it. When he later reflected upon this period in his life, he called himself stupid.

===Priesthood and brother&#x27;s death===
He was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1515 or 1516 in Utrecht. He was then appointed chaplain in his father&#x27;s village Pingjum (1524).

Around 1526 or 1527, questions surrounding the doctrine of transubstantiation caused Menno Simons to begin a serious and in-depth search of the Holy Scriptures, which he confessed he had not previously studied, despite being a priest. Menno was not satisfied with the inconsistent answers which he got from Martin Luther, Martin Bucer and Heinrich Bullinger; he resolved to rely on Scripture alone, and from this time describes his preaching as &quot;evangelical&quot;, not &quot;sacramental&quot;.

Menno&#x27;s first knowledge of the concept of &quot;&quot;re&quot;baptism&quot;, which he said &quot;sounded very strange to me&quot;, came in 1531 after hearing of the beheading of Sicke Freerks Snijder at Leeuwarden for being &quot;rebaptized&quot; (&quot;Snijder&quot;, meaning &quot;tailor&quot;, was probably not the family name, since Freerks is the patronym form of Freerk and Sicke was, in fact, a tailor by trade). A renewed search of the scriptures left Menno Simons believing that infant baptism is not in the Bible. He discussed the issue with his pastor, searched the Church Fathers, and read the works of Martin Luther and Heinrich Bullinger. At some point, he also read some of Erasmus of Rotterdam&#x27;s writings, which affected his views of Christian life and church. While still pondering the issue, he was transferred to Witmarsum. Here he came into direct contact with Anabaptists, preaching and practicing &quot;believer&#x27;s baptism&quot;. Later, some of the Münsterite disciples came there as well. While he regarded them as misled and fanatical, he was drawn to their zeal and their views of the Bible, the Church, and discipleship. 

In 1535, his brother Pieter was among a group of Anabaptists killed near Bolsward because of his participation in the violent takeover of a Catholic monastery known as the Oldeklooster (or Bloemkamp Abbey). This monastery, near Bolsward in the Dutch province of Friesland, was seized on 30 March 1535 by about 300 Anabaptists of Friesland, both men and women, led by Jan van Geelen, an emissary of the Anabaptists of Münster. They thereby won a strong position and from here tried to conquer the entire province. The imperial stadholder Georg Schenck van Toutenburg was put in charge of capturing the old monastery from the Anabaptists. He supposed that he would be able to do so easily, but found himself compelled to conduct a regular siege. On 1 April he decided to bombard the monastery with heavy artillery and tried to storm it, leading his soldiers in four assaults. On the third they succeeded in taking several positions, although some of the fortifications and the church remained in Anabaptist possession. On 7 April the monastery was finally stormed after a severe battle. 300 Anabaptists were killed. Of the ones who did not lose their lives in the attack, 37 were then beheaded and 132, both men and women, taken to Leeuwarden, where another 55 were executed after a short trial. Jan van Geelen escaped. 

After the death of his brother Pieter, Menno experienced a spiritual and mental crisis. He said he &quot;prayed to God with sighs and tears that He would give to me, a sorrowing sinner, the gift of His grace, create within me a clean heart, and graciously through the merits of the crimson blood of Christ, He would graciously forgive my unclean walk and unprofitable life...&quot;

===Anabaptists===

Menno Simons rejected the Catholic Church and the priesthood on 12 January 1536, casting his lot with the Anabaptists. The exact date of his new baptism is unknown, but he was probably baptized not long after leaving Witmarsum in early 1536. By October 1536 his connection with Anabaptism was well known, because it was in that month that Herman and Gerryt Jansz were arrested, charged and beheaded for having lodged Simons. He was ordained around 1537 by Obbe Philips. Obbe and his brother, Dirk Philips, were among the peaceful disciples of Melchior Hoffman (the more radical of Hoffman&#x27;s followers having participated in the Münster Rebellion). It was Hoffman who introduced the first self-sustaining Anabaptist congregation in the Netherlands, when he taught and practiced believers&#x27; baptism in Emden in East Frisia. Menno Simons rejected the violence advocated by the Münster movement, believing it was not Scriptural. His theology was focused on separation from this world, and baptism by repentance symbolized this.

Menno evidently rose quickly to become a man of influence. Before 1540, David Joris, an Anabaptist of the &quot;inspirationist&quot; variety, had been the most influential leader in the Netherlands. By 1544, the term &quot;Mennonite&quot; or &quot;Mennist&quot; was used in a letter to refer to the Dutch Anabaptists.
Twenty-five years after his renunciation of Catholicism, Menno died on 31 January 1561 at Wüstenfelde, Holstein, and was buried in his garden. He was married to a woman named Gertrude, and they had at least three children, two daughters and a son. Only one daughter outlived him.

==Theology==
Menno Simons&#x27; influence on Anabaptism in the Low Countries was so great that Baptist historian William Estep suggested that their history be divided into three periods: &quot;before Menno, under Menno, and after Menno&quot;. Menno is especially significant because of his coming to the Anabaptist movement in the north in its most troublesome days, and helping not only to sustain it, but also to establish it as a viable Radical Reformation movement.

===Incarnation===

Menno believed that Jesus had a &quot;heavenly flesh&quot; instead of taking on human flesh and blood from Mary. He said that Christ was &quot;conceived not of her womb but in her womb&quot;. Menno appealed to scientific theory to bolster his arguments, although he lacked scientific training.

===Excommunication===
Girolimon (1995) compares the teachings of Menno Simons with those of Protestant reformer John Calvin (1509–64), focusing on the issue of excommunication. This theological analysis stresses sharp contrasts between the two leaders on four basic principles: on procedures leading to excommunication, on the severity of sanctions on the excommunicant, on the restoration of a repentant individual, and on civil punishment. Calvin and Menno, each a leader of distinct wings of the Reformation, both believed this extreme form of discipline to be essential to the function of the church in society, agreeing on the basic grounds for excommunication as expressed in the New Testament. Menno, however, envisioned the application of reprimand as a process administered by the entire church body against any sin; Calvin reserved excommunication for especially severe transgressions as identified by the Company of Pastors and the Consistory. Among other disagreements, Calvin approved civil punishment for certain forms of unorthodoxy while Menno advocated strict church/state separation. They differed most profoundly in their views on why church discipline was necessary. Simons saw human perfectability as attainable after conversion, while Calvin stressed an Augustinian theology of human depravity.

===Bride of Christ===
Menno Simons drew heavily from Biblical images of the bride of Christ when envisioning a new church. He found in the Biblical &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; a description of the relationship between a purified church and Christ that not only applied to a reformed church but also to the earthly marriage between man and woman. Like the bride in the songs, the woman must come in total love and devotion and will be cleansed of her natural evil by contact with her husband. He did not alter the conventional view of relations between men and women but idealized the woman&#x27;s subordinate and asexual status.

===Infant baptism===
The Anabaptists insisted on believer&#x27;s (normally adult) baptism. By contrast, Martin Luther defended infant baptism; his belief in it stemmed from his view of the church as ideally an inclusive reality in a Christian society. Menno Simons based his rejection of infant baptism on the concept of the church as a disciplined group of individuals who have voluntarily committed their lives to Christ. He viewed sanctification as a lifelong process that does not completely rid the presence of sin from one&#x27;s life.

===Peace===
Although some Anabaptists in Amsterdam and Münster in the 16th century engaged in violence and murder, Dutch Mennonites generally became pious and peaceful. In his 1539 &quot;Christian Baptism&quot; Menno Simons stated his reluctance to engage in disputes, which may have stemmed from his reluctance for years to announce his true convictions. Simons&#x27; relationships with the radical Münsterites and peaceful Melchiorites may offer additional clues.

===Asceticism===
Menno Simons rejected asceticism in terms of its traditional practices of social withdrawal, mortification, and self-denial. Historical theologian Richard Valantasis, however, has suggested that asceticism should not be defined as these physical practices but as a group of activities designed to re-establish social relations between the individual and the dominant social environment through a new subjectivity, different social relations, and an alternative symbolic universe. Simons&#x27; theology is ascetic by Valantasis&#x27;s definition since it used these methods to restructure Anabaptists&#x27; relationship with &#x27;worldly&#x27; society.

<text>In the calculus of variations, a field of mathematical analysis, the functional derivative (or variational derivative) relates a change in a functional (a functional in this sense is a function that acts on functions) to a change in a function on which the functional depends.

In the calculus of variations, functionals are usually expressed in terms of an integral of functions, their arguments, and their derivatives. In an integrand of a functional, if a function is varied by adding to it another function that is arbitrarily small, and the resulting integrand is expanded in powers of , the coefficient of in the first order term is called the functional derivative.

For example, consider the functional
formula_1
where . If is varied by adding to it a function , and the resulting integrand is expanded in powers of , then the change in the value of to first order in can be expressed as follows:
formula_2
where the variation in the derivative, was rewritten as the derivative of the variation , and integration by parts was used in these derivatives.

==Definition==

In this section, the functional differential (or variation or first variation) is defined. Then the functional derivative is defined in terms of the functional differential.

===Functional differential===

Suppose formula_3 is a Banach space and formula_4 is a functional defined on formula_3.
The differential of formula_4 at a point formula_7 is the linear functional formula_8 on formula_3 defined by the condition that, for all formula_10,
formula_11
where formula_12 is a real number that depends on formula_13 in such a way that formula_14 as formula_15. This means that formula_8 is the Fréchet derivative of formula_4 at formula_18.

However, this notion of functional differential is so strong it may not exist, and in those cases a weaker notion, like the Gateaux derivative is preferred. In many practical cases, the functional differential is defined as the directional derivative
formula_19
Note that this notion of the functional differential can even be defined without a norm.

===Functional derivative===

In many applications, the domain of the functional formula_4 is a space of differentiable functions formula_18 defined on some space formula_22 and formula_4 is of the form
formula_24
for some function formula_25 that may depend on formula_26, the value formula_27 and the derivative formula_28.
If this is the case and, moreover, formula_29 can be written as the integral of formula_30 times another function (denoted )
formula_31
then this function is called the functional derivative of at . If formula_4 is restricted to only certain functions formula_18 (for example, if there are some boundary conditions imposed) then formula_30 is restricted to functions such that formula_35 continues to satisfy these conditions.

Heuristically, formula_30 is the change in formula_18, so we &#x27;formally&#x27; have formula_38, and then this is similar in form to the total differential of a function formula_39,
formula_40
where formula_41 are independent variables.
Comparing the last two equations, the functional derivative formula_42 has a role similar to that of the partial derivative formula_43, where the variable of integration formula_26 is like a continuous version of the summation index formula_45. One thinks of as the gradient of at the point , so the value measures how much the functional will change if the function is changed at the point . Hence the formula
formula_46
is regarded as the directional derivative at point formula_18 in the direction of formula_30. This is analogous to vector calculus, where the inner product of a vector formula_49 with the gradient gives the directional derivative in the direction of formula_49.

==Properties==
Like the derivative of a function, the functional derivative satisfies the following properties, where and are functionals:
* Linearity: formula_51 where are constants.
* Product rule: formula_52
* Chain rules:
**If is a functional and another functional, then formula_53
**If is an ordinary differentiable function (local functional) , then this reduces to formula_54

==Determining functional derivatives==
A formula to determine functional derivatives for a common class of functionals can be written as the integral of a function and its derivatives. This is a generalization of the Euler–Lagrange equation: indeed, the functional derivative was introduced in physics within the derivation of the Lagrange equation of the second kind from the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics (18th century). The first three examples below are taken from density functional theory (20th century), the fourth from statistical mechanics (19th century).

===Formula===
Given a functional
formula_55
and a function formula_56 that vanishes on the boundary of the region of integration, from a previous section Definition,
formula_57

The second line is obtained using the total derivative, where is a derivative of a scalar with respect to a vector.

The third line was obtained by use of a product rule for divergence. The fourth line was obtained using the divergence theorem and the condition that formula_58 on the boundary of the region of integration. Since formula_30 is also an arbitrary function, applying the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations to the last line, the functional derivative is
formula_60

where and . This formula is for the case of the functional form given by at the beginning of this section. For other functional forms, the definition of the functional derivative can be used as the starting point for its determination. (See the example Coulomb potential energy functional.)

The above equation for the functional derivative can be generalized to the case that includes higher dimensions and higher order derivatives. The functional would be,
formula_61

where the vector , and is a tensor whose components are partial derivative operators of order ,
formula_62

An analogous application of the definition of the functional derivative yields
formula_63

In the last two equations, the components of the tensor formula_64 are partial derivatives of with respect to partial derivatives of &quot;ρ&quot;,
formula_65
where formula_66, and the tensor scalar product is,
formula_67 

===Examples===

====Thomas–Fermi kinetic energy functional====
The Thomas–Fermi model of 1927 used a kinetic energy functional for a noninteracting uniform electron gas in a first attempt of density-functional theory of electronic structure:
formula_68
Since the integrand of does not involve derivatives of , the functional derivative of is,
formula_69

====Coulomb potential energy functional====
The electron-nucleus potential energy is
formula_70

Applying the definition of functional derivative,
formula_71
So,
formula_72

The functional derivative of the classical part of the electron-electron interaction (often called Hartree energy) is 
formula_73
From the definition of the functional derivative,
formula_74
The first and second terms on the right hand side of the last equation are equal, since and in the second term can be interchanged without changing the value of the integral. Therefore,
formula_75
and the functional derivative of the electron-electron Coulomb potential energy functional [&quot;ρ&quot;] is,
formula_76

The second functional derivative is
formula_77

====von Weizsäcker kinetic energy functional====
In 1935 von Weizsäcker proposed to add a gradient correction to the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy functional to make it better suit a molecular electron cloud:
formula_78
where
formula_79
Using a previously derived formula for the functional derivative,
formula_80
and the result is,
formula_81

====Entropy====
The entropy of a discrete random variable is a functional of the probability mass function.

formula_82
Thus,
formula_83
Thus,
formula_84

==== Exponential ====

Let
formula_85

Using the delta function as a test function,
formula_86

Thus,
formula_87

This is particularly useful in calculating the correlation functions from the partition function in quantum field theory.

====Functional derivative of a function====
A function can be written in the form of an integral like a functional. For example,
formula_88
Since the integrand does not depend on derivatives of &quot;ρ&quot;, the functional derivative of &quot;ρ&quot; is,
formula_89

==== Functional derivative of iterated function====
The functional derivative of the iterated function formula_90 is given by:
formula_91
and
formula_92

In general:
formula_93

Putting in gives:
formula_94

==Using the delta function as a test function==
In physics, it is common to use the Dirac delta function formula_95 in place of a generic test function formula_96, for yielding the functional derivative at the point formula_97 (this is a point of the whole functional derivative as a partial derivative is a component of the gradient):
formula_98

This works in cases when formula_99 formally can be expanded as a series (or at least up to first order) in formula_12. The formula is however not mathematically rigorous, since formula_101 is usually not even defined.

The definition given in a previous section is based on a relationship that holds for all test functions formula_96, so one might think that it should hold also when formula_96 is chosen to be a specific function such as the delta function. However, the latter is not a valid test function (it is not even a proper function).

In the definition, the functional derivative describes how the functional formula_104 changes as a result of a small change in the entire function formula_27. The particular form of the change in formula_27 is not specified, but it should stretch over the whole interval on which formula_26 is defined. Employing the particular form of the perturbation given by the delta function has the meaning that formula_27 is varied only in the point formula_97. Except for this point, there is no variation in formula_27.

<doc id="301506" wikidata="Q332903" url="?curid=301506" title="Fork (software development)">
<text>In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community; as such, it is a form of schism. Grounds for forking are varying user preferences and stagnated or discontinued development of the original software.

Free and open-source software is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, and without violating copyright law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (&quot;e.g.&quot; Unix) also happen.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;fork&quot; has been used to mean &quot;to divide in branches, go separate ways&quot; as early as the 14th century. In the software environment, the word evokes the fork system call, which causes a running process to split itself into two (almost) identical copies that (typically) diverge to perform different tasks.

In the context of software development, &quot;fork&quot; was used in the sense of creating a revision control &quot;branch&quot; by Eric Allman as early as 1980, in the context of Source Code Control System:

The term was in use on Usenet by 1983 for the process of creating a subgroup to move topics of discussion to.

&quot;Fork&quot; is not known to have been used in the sense of a community schism during the origins of Lucid Emacs (now XEmacs) (1991) or the Berkeley Software Distributions (BSDs) (1993–1994); Russ Nelson used the term &quot;shattering&quot; for this sort of fork in 1993, attributing it to John Gilmore. However, &quot;fork&quot; was in use in the present sense by 1995 to describe the XEmacs split, and was an understood usage in the GNU Project by 1996.

==Forking of free and open-source software==
Free and open-source software may be legally forked without prior approval of those currently developing, managing, or distributing the software per both The Free Software Definition and The Open Source Definition:

In free software, forks often result from a schism over different goals or personality clashes. In a fork, both parties assume nearly identical code bases, but typically only the larger group, or whoever controls the web site, will retain the full original name and the associated user community. Thus, there is a reputation penalty associated with forking. The relationship between the different teams can be cordial or very bitter. On the other hand, a &quot;friendly fork&quot; or a &quot;soft fork&quot; is a fork that does not intend to compete, but wants to eventually merge with the original.

Eric S. Raymond, in his essay &quot;Homesteading the Noosphere&quot;, stated that &quot;The most important characteristic of a fork is that it spawns competing projects that cannot later exchange code, splitting the potential developer community&quot;. He notes in the Jargon File:

David A. Wheeler notes four possible outcomes of a fork, with examples:

# The death of the fork. This is by far the most common case. It is easy to declare a fork, but considerable effort to continue independent development and support.
# A re-merging of the fork (&quot;e.g.&quot;, egcs becoming &quot;blessed&quot; as the new version of GNU Compiler Collection.)
# The death of the original (&quot;e.g.&quot; the X.Org Server succeeding and XFree86 dying.)
# Successful branching, typically with differentiation (&quot;e.g.&quot;, OpenBSD and NetBSD.)

Distributed revision control (DVCS) tools have popularised a less emotive use of the term &quot;fork&quot;, blurring the distinction with &quot;branch&quot;. With a DVCS such as Mercurial or Git, the normal way to contribute to a project, is to first create a personal branch of the repository, independent of the main repository, and later seek to have your changes integrated with it. Sites such as GitHub, Bitbucket and Launchpad provide free DVCS hosting expressly supporting independent branches, such that the technical, social and financial barriers to forking a source code repository are massively reduced, and GitHub uses &quot;fork&quot; as its term for this method of contribution to a project.

Forks often restart version numbering from numbers typically used for initial versions of programs like 0.0.1, 0.1, or 1.0 even if the original software was at another version such as 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0. An exception is sometimes made when the forked software is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the original project, &quot;e.g.&quot; MariaDB for MySQL or LibreOffice for OpenOffice.org.

The BSD licenses permit forks to become proprietary software, and copyleft proponents say that commercial incentives thus make proprietisation almost inevitable. (Copyleft licenses can, however, be circumvented via dual-licensing with a proprietary grant in the form of a Contributor License Agreement.) Examples include macOS (based on the proprietary NeXTSTEP and the open source FreeBSD), Cedega and CrossOver (proprietary forks of Wine, though CrossOver tracks Wine and contributes considerably), EnterpriseDB (a fork of PostgreSQL, adding Oracle compatibility features), Supported PostgreSQL with their proprietary ESM storage system, and Netezza&#x27;s proprietary highly scalable derivative of PostgreSQL. Some of these vendors contribute back changes to the community project, while some keep their changes as their own competitive advantages.

==Forking proprietary software==
In proprietary software, the copyright is usually held by the employing entity, not by the individual software developers. Proprietary code is thus more commonly forked when the owner needs to develop two or more versions, such as a windowed version and a command line version, or versions for differing operating systems, such as a word processor for IBM PC compatible machines and Macintosh computers. Generally, such internal forks will concentrate on having the same look, feel, data format, and behavior between platforms so that a user familiar with one can also be productive or share documents generated on the other. This is almost always an economic decision to generate a greater market share and thus pay back the associated extra development costs created by the fork.

A notable proprietary fork not of this kind is the many varieties of proprietary Unix—almost all derived from AT&amp;T Unix under license and all called &quot;Unix&quot;, but increasingly mutually incompatible. &quot;See&quot; Unix wars.

<text>In computing, particularly in the context of the Unix operating system and its workalikes, fork is an operation whereby a process creates a copy of itself. It is an interface which is required for compliance with the POSIX and Single UNIX Specification standards. It is usually implemented as a C standard library wrapper to the fork, clone, or other system calls of the kernel. Fork is the primary method of process creation on Unix-like operating systems.

== Overview ==
In multitasking operating systems, processes (running programs) need a way to create new processes, e.g. to run other programs. Fork and its variants are typically the only way of doing so in Unix-like systems. For a process to start the execution of a different program, it first forks to create a copy of itself. Then, the copy, called the &quot;child process&quot;, calls the exec system call to overlay itself with the other program: it ceases execution of its former program in favor of the other.

The fork operation creates a separate address space for the child. The child process has an exact copy of all the memory segments of the parent process. In modern UNIX variants that follow the virtual memory model from SunOS-4.0, copy-on-write semantics are implemented and the physical memory need not be actually copied. Instead, virtual memory pages in both processes may refer to the same pages of physical memory until one of them writes to such a page: then it is copied. This optimization is important in the common case where fork is used in conjunction with exec to execute a new program: typically, the child process performs only a small set of actions before it ceases execution of its program in favour of the program to be started, and it requires very few, if any, of its parent&#x27;s data structures.

When a process calls fork, it is deemed the parent process and the newly created process is its child. After the fork, both processes not only run the same program, but they resume execution as though both had called the system call. They can then inspect the call&#x27;s return value to determine their status, child or parent, and act accordingly.

== History ==
One of the earliest references to a fork concept appeared in &quot;A Multiprocessor System Design&quot; by Melvin Conway, published in 1962. Conway&#x27;s paper motivated the implementation by L. Peter Deutsch of fork in the GENIE time-sharing system, where the concept was borrowed by Ken Thompson for its earliest appearance in Research Unix. Fork later became a standard interface in POSIX.

==Communication==
The child process starts off with a copy of its parent&#x27;s file descriptors. For interprocess communication, the parent process will often create one or several pipes, and then after forking the processes will close the ends of the pipes that they do not need.

==Variants==

===Vfork===
Vfork is a variant of fork with the same calling convention and much the same semantics, but only to be used in restricted situations. It originated in the 3BSD version of Unix, the first Unix to support virtual memory. It was standardized by POSIX, which permitted vfork to have exactly the same behavior as fork, but was marked obsolescent in the 2004 edition and was replaced by posix_spawn() (which is typically implemented via vfork) in subsequent editions.

When a vfork system call is issued, the parent process will be suspended until the child process has either completed execution or been replaced with a new executable image via one of the &quot;exec&quot; family of system calls. The child borrows the memory management unit setup from the parent and memory pages are shared among the parent and child process with no copying done, and in particular with no copy-on-write semantics; hence, if the child process makes a modification in any of the shared pages, no new page will be created and the modified pages are visible to the parent process too. Since there is absolutely no page copying involved (consuming additional memory), this technique is an optimization over plain fork in full-copy environments when used with exec. In POSIX, using vfork for any purpose except as a prelude to an immediate call to a function from the exec family (and a select few other operations) gives rise to undefined behavior. As with vfork, the child borrows data structures rather than copying them. vfork is still faster than a fork that uses copy on write semantics.

System V did not support this function call before System VR4 was introduced, because the memory sharing that it causes is error-prone:

Similarly, the Linux man page for vfork strongly discourages its use:
Other problems with include deadlocks that might occur in multithreaded programs due to interactions with dynamic linking. As a replacement for the interface, POSIX introduced the family of functions that combine the actions of fork and exec. These functions may be implemented as library routines in terms of , as is done in Linux, or in terms of for better performance, as is done in Solaris, but the POSIX specification notes that they were &quot;designed as kernel operations&quot;, especially for operating systems running on constrained hardware and real-time systems.

While the 4.4BSD implementation got rid of the vfork implementation, causing vfork to have the same behavior as fork, it was later reinstated in the NetBSD operating system for performance reasons.

Some embedded operating systems such as uClinux omit fork and only implement vfork, because they need to operate on devices where copy-on-write is impossible to implement due to lack of a memory management unit.

===Rfork===
The Plan 9 operating system, created by the designers of Unix, includes fork but also a variant called &quot;rfork&quot; that permits fine-grained sharing of resources between parent and child processes, including the address space (except for a stack segment, which is unique to each process), environment variables and the filesystem namespace; this makes it a unified interface for the creation of both processes and threads within them. Both FreeBSD and IRIX adopted the rfork system call from Plan 9, the latter renaming it &quot;sproc&quot;.

===Clone===
codice_1 is a system call in the Linux kernel that creates a child process that may share parts of its execution context with the parent. Like FreeBSD&#x27;s rfork and IRIX&#x27;s sproc, Linux&#x27;s clone was inspired by Plan 9&#x27;s rfork and can be used to implement threads (though application programmers will typically use a higher-level interface such as pthreads, implemented on top of clone). The &quot;separate stacks&quot; feature from Plan 9 and IRIX has been omitted because (according to Linus Torvalds) it causes too much overhead.

==Forking in other operating systems==

In the original design of the VMS operating system (1977), a copy operation with subsequent mutation of the content of a few specific addresses for the new process as in forking was considered risky. Errors in the current process state may be copied to a child process. Here, the metaphor of process spawning is used: each component of the memory layout of the new process is newly constructed from scratch. The spawn metaphor was later adopted in Microsoft operating systems (1993).

The POSIX-compatibility component of VM/CMS (OpenExtensions) provides a very limited implementation of fork, in which the parent is suspended while the child executes, and the child and the parent share the same address space. This is essentially a &quot;vfork&quot; labelled as a &quot;fork&quot;. (This applies to the CMS guest operating system only; other VM guest operating systems, such as Linux, provide standard fork functionality.)

==Application usage==

The following variant of the &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program demonstrates the mechanics of the system call in the C programming language. The program forks into two processes, each deciding what functionality they perform based on the return value of the fork system call. Boilerplate code such as header inclusions has been omitted.
int main(void)
 pid_t pid = fork();

 if (pid == -1) {
 perror(&quot;fork failed&quot;);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 else if (pid == 0) {
 printf(&quot;Hello from the child process!\n&quot;);
 _exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
 else {
 int status;
 (void)waitpid(pid, &amp;status, 0);
 return EXIT_SUCCESS;


What follows is a dissection of this program.
 pid_t pid = fork();
The first statement in calls the system call to split execution into two processes. The return value of is recorded in a variable of type , which is the POSIX type for process identifiers (PIDs).
 if (pid == -1) {
 perror(&quot;fork failed&quot;);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);


Minus one indicates an error in : no new process was created, so an error message is printed.

If was successful, then there are now two processes, both executing the function from the point where has returned. To make the processes perform different tasks, the program must branch on the return value of to determine whether it is executing as the &quot;child&quot; process or the &quot;parent&quot; process.
 else if (pid == 0) {
 printf(&quot;Hello from the child process!\n&quot;);
 _exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);


In the child process, the return value appears as zero (which is an invalid process identifier). The child process prints the desired greeting message, then exits. (For technical reasons, the POSIX function must be used here instead of the C standard function.)
 else {
 int status;
 (void)waitpid(pid, &amp;status, 0);


The other process, the parent, receives from the process identifier of the child, which is always a positive number. The parent process passes this identifier to the system call to suspend execution until the child has exited. When this has happened, the parent resumes execution and exits by means of the statement.

<text>Zee TV is an Indian Hindi language general entertainment pay television channel owned by Zee Entertainment Enterprises. It was launched on 1 October 1992 as the oldest privately owned Television channel in India. 

== History ==

In 1991, Li Ka-shing started his STAR satellite television network. At the end of the year, Subhash Chandra of the Essel Group finished a round of negotiations with HutchVision, after a series of rejections, and the condition that Chandra would pay US$5 million a year for the satellite transponder. Li signed the deal in India a few months later and approached interested companies, but nobody was interested in paying the transponder fees. Chandra was the last possible man to sign the contract, by gathering money from his non-resident Indian friends and in the creation of a holding company for the channel, Asia Today.

Zee TV was launched on 2 October 1992, as the flagship channel of the Zee Telefilms Ltd. The channel initially broadcast three hours a day, with its output consisting mainly of old Hindi movies and reruns of Doordarshan serials. The channel&#x27;s initial manager was a Doordarshan news reporter who was on leave from his employer. Three months later, the airtime had doubled to six hours.

Within less than a month after its launch, Zee TV was being criticised for its programming lineup; a cynic reviewed the network giving &quot;A for effort&quot; and &quot;Z(ee) for quality&quot;, while others within the network called it an &quot;upbeat clone of Doordarshan&quot;. To offset such negative criticism, Zee TV began producing more original content, opting to create its own pool of producers to reduce reliance on Doordarshan staff.

Zee TV rejected a 1993 bid to broadcast Sun TV during the afternoons, forcing Sun TV to negotiate with competitor ATN instead.

It began full-day broadcasts in 1993. After Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s buyout of Star TV, Zee TV faced some uncertainties about its future; nonetheless, Zee TV had gained rural audiences by November 1993. On 22 December 1993, Murdoch was planning to buy a 49.9% equity stake in the channel&#x27;s owner, Hong Kong–based, British Virgin Islands-registered Asia Today. By year-end 1995, Zee TV already had three channels, the other two being Zee Cinema, a Bollywood channel, and EL TV, which broadcast in English and regional languages. Numerous competitors had also emerged around this time. 11 million households were receiving the channel.

Zee TV lost its leadership to Star Plus, which took over its role after Murdoch sold his stake in Asia Today.

On 10 January 2007, Zee Telefilms Ltd was renamed into the Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL.).

In 2013, Zee TV, along with its sister channels, underwent a branding overhaul.

On 15 October 2017, coinciding with Zee&#x27;s 25-year silver jubilee, all of its channels were rebranded, with the main channel adopting its current slogan, &quot;Aaj Likhenge Kal&quot;.

On 30 May 2021, Zee TV planned to revamp its look and air four new television series, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, the idea was postponed and thereafter scrapped.

The European version of Zee TV traces its origins to TV Asia, which was set up by non-resident Indian and Pakistani immigrants in the United Kingdom and started broadcasting in July 1992. It was the first channel in Europe targeting Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi immigrants. By 1994, the channel was facing financial difficulties, forcing Zee TV to take over the channel in March 1995. The channel also had local community programming as well as content targeting viewers of different religions (Hinduism, Sikhism, and Islam).

The network produced special programmes for the 1997 United Kingdom general election, the first with candidates of South Asian origin.

Three of its sister channels were removed from linear television in the UK and Ireland on 1 June 2019, as part of a decision taken to implement the ZEE5 platform in Europe, leaving only Zee TV and Zee Cinema.

<doc id="301515" wikidata="Q76346" url="?curid=301515" title="Mileva Marić">
<text>Mileva Marić (, ; 19 December 1875 – 4 August 1948), sometimes called Mileva Marić-Einstein (), was a Serbian physicist and mathematician. She showed intellectual aptitude from a young age and studied at Zürich Polytechnic in a highly male dominated field, after having studied medicine for one semester at Zürich University. Her studies included differential and integral calculus, descriptive and projective geometry, mechanics, theoretical physics, applied physics, experimental physics, and astronomy. One of her study colleagues at university was her future husband Albert Einstein, to whose early work Marić is thought by some to have contributed (in particular the Annus Mirabilis papers). 

==Biography==
On 19 December 1875, Mileva Marić was born into a wealthy family in Titel in Austria-Hungary (today Serbia) as the eldest of three children of Miloš Marić (1846–1922) and Marija Ružić-Marić (1847–1935). 

She began her secondary education in 1886 at a high school for girls in Újvidék (today Novi Sad, Serbia), but changed the following year to the Mitrovica Gymnasium in Szávaszentdemeter (today Sremska Mitrovica). Beginning in 1890, Marić attended the Royal Serbian Grammar School in Šabac. In 1891, her father obtained special permission to enroll Marić as a private student at the all-male Royal Classical High School in Zagreb. Her mathematics teacher was Vladimir Varićak. She passed the entrance exam and entered the tenth grade in 1892. She won special permission to attend physics lectures in February 1894 and passed the final exams in September 1894. Her highest grades were in mathematics and physics, both &quot;very good&quot;, one grade below the highest &quot;excellent&quot;. That year she fell seriously ill and decided to move to Switzerland, where on 14 November, she started at the &quot;Girls High School&quot; in Zurich. In 1896, she passed her Matura-Exam, and started studying medicine at the University of Zurich for one semester.

In the fall of 1896, Marić switched to the Zurich Polytechnic (later Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH), having passed the mathematics entrance examination with an average grade of 4.25 (scale 1–6). She enrolled for the diploma course to teach physics and mathematics in secondary schools (section VIA) at the same time as Albert Einstein. She was the only woman in her group of six students, and the fifth woman to enter that section. Marić and Einstein became close friends quite soon. In October, Marić went to Heidelberg to study at Heidelberg University for the winter semester 1897/98, attending physics and mathematics lectures as an auditor. She rejoined the Zurich Polytechnic in April 1898, where her studies included the following courses: differential and integral calculus, descriptive and projective geometry, mechanics, theoretical physics, applied physics, experimental physics, and astronomy.

She sat for the intermediate diploma examinations in 1899, one year later than the other students in her group. Her grade average of 5.05 (scale 1–6) placed her fifth out of the six students taking the examinations that year. Marić&#x27;s grade in physics was 5.5 (the same as Einstein&#x27;s). In 1900, she failed the final teaching diploma examinations with a grade average of 4.00, having obtained only grade 2.5 in the mathematics component (theory of functions).

Marić&#x27;s academic career was disrupted in May 1901 on a short holiday in Italy when she became pregnant by Einstein. When three months pregnant, she resat the diploma examination, but failed for the second time without improving her grade. She discontinued work on her diploma dissertation that she had hoped to develop into a PhD thesis under the supervision of the physics professor Heinrich Weber.

She went to Újvidék, where her daughter was born in 1902, probably in January. The girl was referred to in correspondence between the couple as Hansel before she was born and Lieserl after. At the age of one year, Lieserl suffered from scarlet fever from which she retained permanent damage. Some sources say Lieserl died soon after in 1903, but others suggest she was put up for adoption in Serbia. 
==Debate over collaboration with Einstein==
The question whether (and if so, to what extent) Marić contributed to Albert Einstein&#x27;s early work, and to the &quot;Annus Mirabilis Papers&quot; in particular, is a subject of debate. Many historians of physics argue that she made no significant scientific contribution, while others suggest that she was a supportive companion in science and may have helped him materially in his research, and there is also a possibility of them developing the scientific concepts together when they were still students. 

=== Debate over co-authorship ===
Debate over whether Marić was a co-author of some of Einstein&#x27;s early work, putatively culminating in the 1905 papers, is based on a passage from Russian physicist Abram Joffe&#x27;s personal memoirs:

Proponents claim that Joffe was erroneously attributing the addition of the name Marity, Marić&#x27;s official name, to a &quot;non-existent&quot; Swiss custom. Others have argued that it is unlikely Joffe saw the papers before they were published, and also unlikely he would have remembered the exact name on the papers if he did.

Mileva told a Serbian friend, referring to 1905, that &quot;we finished some important work that will make my husband world famous.&quot; Historians Highfield and Carter G. Woodson argue that this statement is &quot;hometown folklore.&quot;

=== Debate over collaboration ===
Some of the debate over whether Marić collaborated with Einstein is based on their letters:
*John Stachel argues that letters in which Einstein referred to &quot;our&quot; theory and &quot;our&quot; work were written in their student days, at least four years before the 1905 papers. Stachel also suggests that some of the instances in which Einstein used &quot;our&quot; in relation to scientific work referred to their diploma dissertations, for which they had each chosen the same topic (experimental studies of heat conduction). Stachel argues that Einstein used &quot;our&quot; in general statements, while he invariably used &quot;I&quot; and &quot;my&quot; when he recounted &quot;specific&quot; ideas he was working on: &quot;the letters to Marić show Einstein referring to &#x27;his&#x27; studies, &#x27;his&#x27; work on the electrodynamics of moving bodies over a dozen times... as compared to &#x27;one&#x27; reference to &#x27;our&#x27; work on the problem of relative motion.&quot;
*Stachel also suggests that in two cases where letters from Marić survive that directly respond to those from Einstein in which he had recounted his latest ideas, she gives no response at all. Her letters, in contrast to Einstein&#x27;s, contain only personal matters, or comments related to her Polytechnic coursework. Stachel writes: &quot;In her case, we have &quot;no&quot; published papers, &quot;no&quot; letters with a serious scientific content, either to Einstein nor to anyone else; nor any &quot;objective&quot; evidence of her supposed creative talents. We do not even have hearsay accounts of conversations she had with anyone else that have a specific, scientific content, let alone claiming to report her ideas.&quot; 
Thus, while some scholars have argued that there is not enough evidence to support the idea that Marić helped Einstein to develop his theories, others have argued that their letters suggest a collaboration between them, at least through 1901 before their children were born.

Some of the debate over whether Marić collaborated with Einstein is based on their interactions:
*Marić&#x27;s brother and other relatives reported eyewitness accounts of Marić and Albert discussing physics together when they were married.
*The couple&#x27;s first son, Hans Albert (born 1904), said that when his mother married Einstein in 1903, she gave up her scientific ambitions. But he also said how his parents&#x27; &quot;scientific collaboration continued into their marriage, and that he remembered seeing [them] work together in the evenings at the same table.&quot;

==Family and personal relationships==
In 1901, Marić was pregnant with her and Einstein&#x27;s first child. She managed to hide the pregnancy and travelled to her home town to give birth in order to avoid the scandal. Letters to Einstein have documented that their daughter was born in Novi Sad, in January 1902. No further information is available about what happened to the little girl.

In 1903, Marić and Einstein married in Bern, Switzerland, where Einstein had found a job at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property. In 1904, their first son Hans Albert, was born. In the following years, Marić and her husband moved several times, because of his changing teaching positions. They lived in Bern until 1909, and moved to Zürich. In 1910, their second son Eduard was born. In 1911, they moved to Prague, where Einstein held a teaching position at Charles University. A year later, they returned to Zurich, as Einstein had accepted a professorship at his alma mater.

In July 1913, Marić was distressed because of her husbands relocation to Berlin. In August, the family planned a walking holiday with their sons and Marie Curie and her two daughters. Marić was delayed temporarily due to Eduard being ill, but then joined the party. In September 1913, the Einsteins visited Marić&#x27;s parents near Novi Sad, and on the day they were to leave for Vienna, Marić had her sons baptised as Orthodox Christians. After Vienna, Marić returned to Zurich, while Einstein visited relatives in Germany. After Christmas, she traveled to Berlin to stay with Fritz Haber, who helped her look for accommodation for the Einsteins&#x27; impending move in April 1914. The couple both left Zurich for Berlin in late March. On the way, Marić took a swimming holiday with the children in Locarno, arriving in Berlin in mid-April.

The marriage had been strained since 1912. Marić, who had never wanted to go to Berlin, became increasingly unhappy in the city. In mid-July 1914, after settling in Berlin, her husband insisted on harsh terms if she were to remain with him. Although initially accepting the terms, she reconsidered and on 29 July 1914, the day after World War I started, she left Germany and took the boys back to Zürich, a separation that was to become permanent. Einstein made a legal commitment to send her an annual maintenance of 5600 Reichsmark in quarterly instalments, just under half of his salary, a commitment to which he largely adhered. After the required five years of separation, the couple divorced on 14 February 1919.

They had negotiated a settlement whereby the Nobel Prize money that Einstein anticipated he would soon receive was to be placed in trust for their two boys. Einstein would receive the prize for his work, and she would receive the money. Marić could draw on the interest, but had no authority over the capital without her ex-husband&#x27;s permission.

In 1922, Mileva Marić received the Nobel Prize money that she was promised in her divorce agreement with her ex-husband Einstein to support their sons; Under the terms of the agreement, the money was to be held in trust for their two boys, while she was able to draw on the interest. Based on newly released letters [sealed by Einstein&#x27;s step-daughter (Elsa&#x27;s daughter), Margot Einstein, until 20 years after her death], Walter Isaacson reported that Marić eventually invested the Nobel Prize money in three apartment buildings in Zurich to produce income. Marić lived in one, a five-story house at Huttenstrasse 62; the other two were investments.

In 1930, at around age 20, her son Eduard had a breakdown and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. By the late 1930s, the costs of his care at the University of Zürich&#x27;s psychiatric clinic &quot;Burghölzli&quot; overwhelmed Marić. She sold the two houses to raise funds for his care and maintenance. In 1939, Marić agreed to transfer ownership of the Huttenstrasse house where she was living to Einstein to prevent its loss, with Marić retaining power of attorney.

==Death==
Mileva Marić suffered a severe stroke and 
died at age 72 on 4 August 1948, in Zürich. She was interred there at Nordheim-Cemetery. Eduard Einstein was institutionalized until his death in 1965.

==Honours==
In 2005, Marić was honoured in Zürich by the ETH and the Gesellschaft zu Fraumünster. A memorial plaque was unveiled on her former residence in Zürich, the house Huttenstrasse 62, in her memory. In the same year, a bust was placed in her high-school town, Sremska Mitrovica. Another bust is located on the campus of the University of Novi Sad. A high school in her birthplace of Titel is named after her. Sixty years after her death, a memorial plate was placed on the house of the former clinic in Zürich where she died. In June 2009, a memorial gravestone was dedicated to her at the Nordheim-Cemetery in Zürich where she rests.

In 1995, &quot;Narodna knjiga&quot; in Belgrade published (in Serbian) &quot;Mileva Marić Ajnštajn&quot; by Dragana Bukumirović, a journalist with &quot;Politika&quot;.

Three years later, in 1998, Vida Ognjenović produced a drama, &quot;Mileva Ajnštajn&quot;, which was translated into English in 2002. Ognjenović later adapted the play into a libretto for the opera &quot;Mileva&quot;, composed by Aleksandra Vrebalov, which premiered in 2011 in the Serbian National Theatre in Novi Sad.

==Popular culture==
* In her novel &quot;The Other Einstein&quot; (2016), Marie Benedict gives a fictionalized account of the relationship between Mileva Marić and Albert Einstein.
* In 2017, her life was depicted in the first season of the television series &quot;Genius&quot;, which focuses on Einstein&#x27;s life. She was played by Nikki Hahn, Samantha Colley and Sally Dexter.
*A fictionalized depiction of Mileva Marić (portrayed by Christina Jastrzembska) and her potential contributions to Einstein&#x27;s work is depicted in the first episode of the second season of the time-travelling superhero television series, DC&#x27;s &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;. 
* In 2019, physicist and writer Gabriella Greison applied for the posthumous award of a degree to Mileva Maric at the ETH Zurich. After 4 months of discussions, the university denied the degree.
* Mileva Marić is a major character in Margaret Peterson Haddix&#x27;s 2012 young-adult science-fiction novel &quot;Caught&quot;, part of &quot;The Missing&quot; series.
* In 2022 novel &quot;Lessons in Chemistry&quot; by Bonnie Garmus, Mileva Marić is twice mentioned as an example of a pioneering woman scientist whose work was subsumed under that of her famous scientist husband.

<doc id="301517" wikidata="Q2293837" url="?curid=301517" title="Damsel in distress">
<text>The damsel in distress is a narrative device in which one or more men must rescue a woman who has been kidnapped or placed in other peril. The &quot;damsel&quot; is often portrayed as beautiful, popular and of high social status; they are usually depicted as princesses in works with fantasy or fairy tale settings. Kinship, love, lust or a combination of those motivate the male protagonist to initiate the narrative.

Critics have linked the helplessness of these women to societal views that women as a group need to be taken care of by men and treated nicely. Throughout the history of the trope, the role of the woman as the victim in need of a male savior has remained constant, but her attackers have changed to suit the tastes and collective fears of the period: &quot;monsters, mad scientists, Nazis, hippies, bikers, aliens...&quot;

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;damsel&quot; derives from the French &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;young lady&quot;, and the term &quot;damsel in distress&quot; in turn is a translation of the French &quot;demoiselle en détresse&quot;. It is an archaic term not used in modern English except for effect or in expressions such as this. It can be traced back to the knight-errant of Medieval songs and tales, who regarded protection of women as an essential part of the chivalric code, which includes a notion of honour and nobility. The English term &quot;damsel in distress&quot; itself first seems to have appeared in Richard Ames&#x27; 1692 poem &quot;Sylvia’s Complaint of Her Sexes Unhappiness.&quot;

== History ==

=== Ancient history ===
The damsel in distress theme featured in the stories of the ancient Greeks. Greek mythology, while featuring a large retinue of competent goddesses, also contains helpless maidens threatened with human sacrifice. For example, Andromeda&#x27;s mother offended the Nereids and Poseidon, who sent a beast to ravage the land. To appease him Andromeda&#x27;s parents fastened her to a rock in the sea. The hero Perseus slew the beast, saving Andromeda. Andromeda in her plight, chained naked to a rock, became a favorite theme of later painters. This theme of the princess and dragon is also pursued in the myth of Saint George. The homosexual variant is also present in the stories of Cleostratus and Alcyoneus, youths who are to be sacrificed to man-eating serpentine monsters before they are saved by their love interests Menestratus and Eurybarus respectively.

=== Post-classical history ===
European fairy tales frequently feature damsels in distress. Evil witches trapped Rapunzel in a tower, cursed Snow White to die in &quot;Snow White&quot;, and put the princess into a magical sleep in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. In all of these, a valorous prince comes to the maiden&#x27;s aid, saves her, and marries her (though Rapunzel is not directly saved by the prince, but instead saves him from blindness after her exile).

The damsel in distress was an archetypal character of medieval romances, where typically she was rescued from imprisonment in a tower of a castle by a knight-errant. Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Clerk&#x27;s Tale&quot; of the repeated trials and bizarre torments of patient Griselda was drawn from Petrarch. The Emprise de l&#x27;Escu vert à la Dame Blanche (founded 1399) was a chivalric order with the express purpose of protecting oppressed ladies.
The theme also entered the official hagiography of the Catholic Churchmost famously in the story of Saint George who saved a princess from being devoured by a dragon. A late addition to the official account of this Saint&#x27;s life, not attested in the several first centuries when he was venerated, it is nowadays the main act for which Saint George is remembered.

Obscure outside Norway is Hallvard Vebjørnsson, the Patron Saint of Oslo, recognised as a martyr after being killed while valiantly trying to defend a womanmost likely a slavefrom three men accusing her of theft.

===Modern history===

====17th century====
In the 17th century English ballad &quot;The Spanish Lady&quot; (one of several English and Irish songs with that name), a Spanish lady captured by an English captain falls in love with her captor and begs him not to set her free but to take her with him to England, and in this appeal describes herself as &quot;A lady in distress&quot;.

====18th century====
The damsel in distress makes her debut in the modern novel as the title character of Samuel Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Clarissa&quot; (1748), where she is menaced by the wicked seducer Lovelace. The phrase &quot;damsel in distress&quot; is found in Richardson&#x27;s &quot;The History of Sir Charles Grandison&quot; (1753): 

Reprising her medieval role, the damsel in distress is a staple character of Gothic literature, where she is typically incarcerated in a castle or monastery and menaced by a sadistic nobleman, or members of the religious orders. Early examples in this genre include Matilda in Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, Emily in Ann Radcliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot;, and Antonia in Matthew Lewis&#x27; &quot;The Monk&quot;.

The perils faced by this Gothic heroine were taken to an extreme by the Marquis de Sade in &quot;Justine&quot;, who exposed the erotic subtext which lay beneath the damsel-in-distress scenario.
One exploration of the theme of the persecuted maiden is the fate of Gretchen in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. According to the philosopher Schopenhauer:

&quot;The great Goethe has given us a distinct and visible description of this denial of the will, brought about by great misfortune and by the despair of all deliverance, in his immortal masterpiece Faust, in the story of the sufferings of Gretchen. I know of no other description in poetry. It is a perfect specimen of the second path, which leads to the denial of the will not, like the first, through the mere knowledge of the suffering of the whole world which one acquires voluntarily, but through the excessive pain felt in one&#x27;s own person. It is true that many tragedies bring their violently willing heroes ultimately to this point of complete resignation, and then the will-to-live and its phenomenon usually end at the same time. But no description known to me brings to us the essential point of that conversion so distinctly and so free from everything extraneous as the one mentioned in Faust&quot; (&quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, Vol. I, §68)

====19th century====
The misadventures of the damsel in distress of the Gothic novel continued in a somewhat caricatured form in Victorian melodrama. According to Michael Booth in his classic study &quot;English Melodrama&quot;, the Victorian stage melodrama featured a limited number of stock characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an old man, an old woman, a comic man and a comic woman engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. Often the good but not very clever hero is duped by a scheming villain, who has eyes on the damsel in distress until fate intervenes to ensure the triumph of good over evil.

Such melodrama influenced the fledgling film industry and led to damsels in distress being the subject of many early silent films, especially those that were made as multi-episode serials. Early examples include &quot;The Adventures of Kathlyn&quot; in 1913 and &quot;The Hazards of Helen&quot;, which ran from 1914 to 1917. The silent film heroines frequently faced new perils provided by the Industrial Revolution and catering to the new medium&#x27;s need for visual spectacle. Here we find the heroine tied to a railway track, burning buildings, and explosions. Sawmills were another stereotypical danger of the Industrial age, as recorded in a popular song from a later era:
====20th century====


During the First World War, the imagery of a Damsel in Distress was extensively used in Allied propaganda (see illustrations). Particularly, the Imperial German conquest and occupation of Belgium was commonly referred to as The Rape of Belgium - effectively transforming Allied soldiers into knights bent on saving that rape victim. This was expressed explicitly in the lyrics of &quot;Keep the Home Fires Burning&quot; mentioning the &quot;boys&quot; as having gone to help a &quot;Nation in Distress&quot;.

A form of entertainment in which the damsel-in-distress emerged as a stereotype at this time was stage magic. Restraining attractive female assistants and imperiling them with blades and spikes became a staple of 20th century magicians&#x27; acts. Noted illusion designer and historian Jim Steinmeyer identifies the beginning of this phenomenon as coinciding with the introduction of the &quot;sawing a woman in half&quot; illusion. In 1921 magician P. T. Selbit became the first to present such an act to the public. Steinmeyer observes that: &quot;Before Selbit&#x27;s illusion, it was not a cliche that pretty ladies were teased and tortured by magicians. Since the days of Robert-Houdin, both men and women were used as the subjects for magic illusions&quot;. However, changes in fashion and great social upheavals during the first decades of the 20th century made Selbit&#x27;s choice of &quot;victim&quot; both practical and popular. The trauma of war had helped to desensitise the public to violence and the emancipation of women had changed attitudes to them. Audiences were tiring of older, more genteel forms of magic. It took something shocking, such as the horrific productions of the Grand Guignol theatre, to cause a sensation in this age. Steinmeyer concludes that: &quot;beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment&quot;.

The damsel-in-distress continued as a mainstay of the comics, film, and television industries throughout the 20th century. Imperiled heroines in need of rescue were a frequent occurrence in black-and-white film serials made by studios such as Columbia Pictures, Mascot Pictures, Republic Pictures, and Universal Studios in the 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s. These serials sometimes drew inspiration for their characters and plots from adventure novels and comic books. Notable examples include the character Nyoka the Jungle Girl, whom Edgar Rice Burroughs created for comic books and who was later adapted into a serial heroine in the Republic productions &quot;Jungle Girl&quot; (1941) and its sequel &quot;Perils of Nyoka&quot; (1942). Additional classic damsels in that mold were Jane Porter, in both the novel and movie versions of &quot;Tarzan&quot;, and Ann Darrow, as played by Fay Wray in the movie &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), in one of the most iconic instances. The notorious hoax documentary &quot;Ingagi&quot; (1930) also featured this idea, and Wray&#x27;s role was repeated by Jessica Lange and Naomi Watts in remakes. As journalist Andrew Erish has noted: &quot;Gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits&quot;. Small screen iconic portrayals, this time in children&#x27;s cartoons, are Underdog&#x27;s girlfriend, Sweet Polly Purebred and Nell Fenwick, who is often rescued by inept Mountie Dudley Do-Right. On the original &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; TV series, the television newswoman April O&#x27;Neil was repeatedly held captive by the evil Shredder and often needed to be rescued by the titular turtles.

The James Bond novels of Ian Fleming, originally published in the 1950s and 1960s, would sometimes feature the &quot;Bond girl&quot; tied up by a villain and needing to be rescued by Bond, and this theme continued into a number of the films, produced from the early 1960s onward, including &quot;Dr. No&quot;, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, &quot;Octopussy&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot;, all of which show Bond rescuing the female lead, who has been tied up. In some films, Bond and a female character are tied up together (for example, in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; and &quot;Moonraker&quot;). In other films, Bond is shown tied up and in peril (examples include &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Skyfall&quot;) and in some cases is rescued by the female lead (such as in &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot;).

The protagonists of the Disney Princess franchise are often depicted as damsels in distress, with the leads of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; requiring rescue by Prince love interest from a witch&#x27;s evil plan. Scholars have noted the emphasis on youth and femininity in these narratives: with the damsel princess being depicted as youthful and hyperfeminine, while their witch captors are older &quot;evil femme fatales or ugly hags&quot; embodying masculine traits. 

Frequently cited examples of a damsel in distress in comics include Lois Lane, who was eternally getting into trouble and needing to be rescued by Superman, and Olive Oyl, who was in a near-constant state of kidnap, requiring her to be saved by Popeye.

Coined by Gail Simone in 1999, &quot;women in refrigerators&quot; is a literary trope where female characters are injured, sexually assaulted, killed, or depowered (an event colloquially known as fridging), sometimes to stimulate &quot;protective&quot; traits, and often as a plot device intended to move a male character&#x27;s story arc forward. The phrase is used to analyze why such plot devices are used disproportionately on female characters. It refers to an incident in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; vol. 3 #54 (1994), written by Ron Marz, in which Kyle Rayner, the title hero, comes home to his apartment to find that the villain Major Force had killed his girlfriend, Alexandra DeWitt, and stuffed her in a refrigerator. Simone and a number of collaborators created the website Women in Refrigerators which hosts a list of works which they believe express the trope.
== Critical and theoretical responses ==

Damsels in distress have been cited as an example of differential treatment of genders in literature, film, and works of art. Feminist criticism of art, film, and literature has often examined gender-oriented characterisation and plot, including the common &quot;damsel in distress&quot; trope, as perpetrating regressive and patronizing myths about women. Many modern writers and directors, such as Anita Sarkeesian, Angela Carter and Jane Yolen, have revisited classic fairy tales and &quot;damsel in distress&quot; stories or collected and anthologised stories and folk tales that break the &quot;damsel in distress&quot; pattern.

==Empowered damsel==
Films featuring an empowered damsel date to the early days of filmmaking. One of the films most often associated with the stereotypical damsel in distress, &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; (1914), also provides at least a partial counterexample, in that Pauline, played by Pearl White, is a strong character who decides against early marriage in favour of seeking adventure and becoming an author. Despite common belief, the film does not feature scenes with Pauline tied to a railroad track and threatened by a buzzsaw, although such scenes were incorporated into later re-creations and were also featured in other films made in the period around 1914. Academic Ben Singer has contested the idea that these &quot;serial-queen melodramas&quot; were male fantasies and has observed that they were marketed heavily at women. The first motion picture serial made in the United States, &quot;What Happened to Mary?&quot; (1912), was released to coincide with a serial story of the same name published in McClure&#x27;s &quot;Ladies&#x27; World&quot; magazine.

Empowered damsels were a feature of the serials made in the 1930s and 1940s by studios such as Republic Pictures. The &quot;cliffhanger&quot; scenes at the end of episodes provide many examples of female heroines bound and helpless and facing fiendish death traps. But those heroines, played by actresses such as Linda Stirling and Kay Aldridge, were often strong, assertive women who ultimately played an active part in vanquishing the villains.

C. L. Moore&#x27;s short story &quot;Shambleau&quot; (1933) – generally acknowledged as epoch-making in the history of science fiction – begins in what seems a classical damsel in distress situation: the protagonist, space adventurer Northwest Smith, sees a &quot;sweetly-made girl&quot; pursued by a lynch mob intent on killing her and intervenes to save her, but finds her not a girl nor a human being at all, but a disguised alien creature, predatory and highly dangerous. Soon, Smith himself needs rescuing and barely escapes with his life.

These themes have received successive updates in modern-era characters, ranging from &#x27;spy girls&#x27; of the 1960s to current film and television heroines. In her book &quot;The Devil with James Bond&quot; (1967) Ann Boyd compared James Bond with an updating of the legend of Saint George and the &quot;princess and dragon&quot; genre, particularly with Dr. No&#x27;s dragon tank. The damsel in distress theme is also very prominent in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, where the story is told in the first person by the young woman Vivienne Michel, who is threatened with imminent rape by thugs when Bond kills them and claims her as his reward.

The female spy Emma Peel in the 1960s television series &quot;The Avengers&quot; was often seen in &quot;damsel in distress&quot; situations. The character and her reactions, portrayed by actress Diana Rigg, differentiated these scenes from other film and television scenarios where women were similarly imperiled as pure victims or pawns in the plot. A scene with Emma Peel bound and threatened with a death ray in the episode &quot;From Venus with Love&quot; is a direct parallel to James Bond&#x27;s confrontation with a laser in the film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. Both are examples of the classic hero&#x27;s ordeal as described by Campbell and Vogler. The serial heroines and Emma Peel are cited as providing inspiration for the creators of strong heroines in more recent times, ranging from Joan Wilder in &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; and Princess Leia in &quot;Star Wars&quot; to &quot;post feminist&quot; icons such as Buffy Summers from &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, Xena and Gabrielle from &quot;&quot;, Sydney Bristow from &quot;Alias&quot;, Natasha Romanoff from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Kim Possible from the series of the same name, Sarah Connor from the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise, and Veronica Mars, also from the series of the same name.

Reflecting these changes, Daphne Blake of the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; cartoon series (who throughout the series is captured dozens of times, falls through trap doors, etc.) is portrayed in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; film as a wisecracking feminist heroine (quote: &quot;I&#x27;ve had it with this damsel in distress thing!&quot;). The film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009) includes a classical damsel in distress episode, where Irene Adler (played by Rachel McAdams) is helplessly bound to a conveyor belt in an industrial slaughterhouse, and is saved from being sawn in half by a chainsaw; yet in other episodes of the same film Adler is strong and assertive – for example, overcoming with contemptuous ease two thugs who sought to rob her (and robbing them instead). In the film&#x27;s climax, it is Adler who saves the day, dismantling at the last moment a device set to poison the entire membership of Parliament.

In the final scene of the Walt Disney Pictures film &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007) the traditional roles are reversed when male protagonist Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey) is captured by Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) in her dragon form. In a &quot;King Kong&quot;-like fashion, she carries him to the top of a New York skyscraper, until Robert&#x27;s beloved Giselle climbs it, sword in hand, to save him.

A similar role reversal is evident in Stieg Larsson&#x27;s &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;, in whose climactic scene the male protagonist is captured by a serial killer, locked in an underground torture room, chained, stripped naked, and humiliated when his female partner enters to save him and destroy the villain. Still another example is &quot;Foxglove Summer&quot;, part of Ben Aaronovitch&#x27;s &quot;Rivers of London&quot; series - where the protagonist Peter Grant is bound and taken captive by the Queen of the Faeries, and it is Grant&#x27;s girlfriend who comes to rescue him, riding a Steel Horse.

Another role reversal is in &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), written and directed by James Cameron. After Jack Dawson is handcuffed to a pipe in the master-at-arms&#x27; office to drown, Rose DeWitt Bukater leaves her family to rescue him and they head back to the upper deck.

In Robert J. Harris&#x27; WWII spy thriller &quot;The Thirty-One Kings&quot; (2017), the chivalrous protagonist Richard Hannay takes time off from his vital intelligence mission to help a beautiful young woman, harassed on a Paris street by two drunken men. She laughingly thanks him though saying she could have dealt with the men by herself. Hannay has no suspicion that she is herself the dangerous Nazi agent he had been sent to apprehend, and that she recognized him and knows his mission. Unsuspectingly he drinks the glass of brandy she offers him - whereupon he loses consciousness and wakes up securely bound. Gloating and jeering, the girl mocks Hannay for his sense of chivalry proving to be his undoing. Destined to an ignominious watery death, it is the would be rescuer who is in very big distress; fortunately, his friends show up in the nick of time to save him from the clutches of the femme fatale.

Conversely, Jo Nesbø revives a classical Damsel in distress trope in his 2007 crime novel &quot;The Snowman&quot;. Nesbø&#x27;s protagonist Harry Hole is faced with his beloved Rakel having been bound and forced to sit on a fast-melting seat of ice; once it has melted she would fall into an infernal device and be torn to pieces. Harry Hole manages to save her, though at the price of suffering some mutilation himself.

==In video games==

In computer and video games, female characters are often cast in the role of the damsel in distress, with their rescue being the objective of the game. An early example of the damsel archetype in video games is Pauline, a Nintendo character in the 1981 arcade game &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. The gameplay involves Mario rescuing her from the top of a construction site after she is kidnapped and held captive by a giant ape.

In the &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; game series, Princess Daphne, the beautiful daughter of King Aethelred, serves as the series&#x27; damsel in distress. The first &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; game, released in 1983, involves the hero Dirk the Daring facing a series of challenges to rescue Daphne from a dragon named Singe. Jon M. Gibson of GameSpy called her &quot;the epitome&quot; of the trope.

Princess Peach throughout much of the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise is also a example. She is repeatedly kidnapped across the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, beginning with her debut in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; in 1985. In most games in the series she is kidnapped and trapped in a castle by the villain Bowser and his minions in order for Mario to rescue her. Peach has been described as the &quot;quintessential damsel in distress&quot; and her repeated abductions as a running joke and pop culture reference by &quot;Time&quot;. 

Princess Zelda in the early &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series has been described by Gladys L. Knight in her book &quot;Female Action Heroes&quot; as &quot;perhaps one [of] the most well-known &#x27;damsel in distress&#x27; princesses in video game history&quot;. In most games in the series she is given the role of a &quot;princess in peril&quot;, requiring the hero, Link, to rescue her, although later games, such as &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, presented her as a more realised character.

In 1989, another Nintendo character, Princess Daisy, was cast in the role of damsel in distress in &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;. In &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, an imprisoned princess is the game&#x27;s objective, necessitating the player character to rescue her.

==Male version: Knight in distress==
Some modern works of fiction involve a woman rescuing a male figure such as a husband in distress.
Examples include:
* The husband (David Brooks) of the Strong female character (Avery Graves) in &quot;Canary Black&quot;
* Flynn Rider in &quot;Tangled&quot;
* Peeta Mellark in &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;

<doc id="301518" wikidata="Q5169205" url="?curid=301518" title="Copynorms">
<text>As used by copyright theorists, the term copynorm (or more frequently copynorms) is used to refer to a normalized social standard regarding the ethical issue of duplicating copyrighted material. 

Questions about the ethics of copying came to public attention as a result of peer-to-peer file sharing systems, such as Napster, Gnutella, KaZaA, BitTorrent and Direct Connect. Survey research indicates that most users of filesharing systems do not believe that it is wrong to download MP3 files of copyrighted music, even though such downloading may be unlawful. 

These questions are important to legal theory, because the ability of copyright law to control the copying of digital material may depend more on voluntary compliance than on hypothetical criminal or civil actions against individuals.

== Legal background ==
Copyright law is actually a collection of legal rules. Typically, copyright statutes confer a bundle of legal rights on the author or proprietor of a work (writing, a musical composition or an image), including the exclusive right to make copies of the work, subject to the fair use. Legal rules carry legal consequences. Violation of copyrights can give rise to civil and criminal liability. 

In the United States, the Constitution grants Congress power to secure exclusive rights of authors to their writings, and Congress has exercised that power in a comprehensive statutory scheme, codified in Title 17 of the United States Code. 

Each nation has its own copyright laws and international treaties set minimum standards for copyright legislation. This entry focuses on the laws of the United States as an example.

== Social rules ==
Copynorms are informal social rules. Social norms include rules of etiquette as well as moral norms (such as the moral prohibitions on theft or murder) and quasi-moral norms (such as the social rules that create zones of privacy in public places). Copynorms are simply the informal social norms that determine the social acceptability of copying works created by others. Social norms are enforced by informal social sanctions, ranging from simple expressions of disapproval (mild) to shunning or vandalism (severe).

Copyright law and copynorms are interrelated but distinct. Some copying that is not prohibited by copyright law violates copynorms—plagiarism of work in the public domain would be an example. More significant to copyright theory and policy, copying that is prohibited by law may be considered socially acceptable.

== Real life examples ==
=== P2P impact ===
In the late 1990s and early in the 2000s, peer-to-peer filesharing over the Internet became increasingly popular. The first P2P program to receive widespread attention in the media and popular consciousness was Napster. Napster was shut down by an injunction issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, which resulted in a variety of other P2P programs (Gnutella, Bearshare, Kazaa, etc.) gaining popularity. Another significant use of P2P programs is the distribution of MP3 files created by ripping copyrighted music from commercial CDs. The use of P2P to distribute digital copies of DVD has also grown in popularity.

There is considerable controversy over the application of the copyright laws to individual, noncommercial use of P2P programs to distribute MP3 files, but judicial opinion, so far, has sided with the music industry and held that an individual who copies and distributes an MP3 file containing copyrighted music violates federal copyright law. Nonetheless, the use of P2P to share and download copyrighted music is generally considered socially acceptable. Survey research supports this conclusion, as does the popularity of P2P programs.

=== Other cases ===
Although P2P has been the focal point in discussions of copynorms, the phenomenon is more general in scope. Some other contexts in which copynorms diverge from United States copyright law include the following:
*Videotape recording of copyrighted broadcast and cable television content for archival (as opposed to time shifting) use,
*Systematic photocopying of books and journal articles for academic and business use,
*Audiotape recording of live music concerts,
*The use of copyrighted digital images (PNG, JPEG, etc.) on personal websites.

To varying degrees, in each of these cases, copying that violates the law is socially acceptable. Anecdotal evidence suggests that illegal archiving of television programs is widely regarded as socially acceptable, and it is doubtful that many users of home Video Cassette Recorders (VCRs) are aware that this activity is unlawful in some countries.

== Causes of divergence ==

In the absence of social science research, theorizing about the causes of the divergence between copyright laws and copynorms is necessarily speculative. Several tentative hypotheses have been suggested. A simple rational choice model might suggest that illegal copying is accepted simply because it is in the self-interest of individuals who can obtain copyrighted materials for free with very little risk of getting caught.

Another possible factor is connected to technological change. Copying technology was relatively centralized and expensive until after the middle of the twentieth century. Until the advent of inexpensive audio tape recorders, the sharing of copyrighted recordings was very difficult and expensive. The transition from reel-to-reel to 8-track cartridge and later cassette tape recorders reduced costs substantially, but a significant investment of time was required to make each copy. Digital technology, the Internet, and specialized P2P software in turn substantially reduced the costs of file sharing. Social norms develop over time and necessarily emerge only with respect to conduct that is sufficiently feasible to become a social issue.

A third factor springs from the fact that most laypeople do not know the precise scope of the monopoly that a copyright grants to the author (or copyright holder). Especially the distinction between legally recording a broadcast from radio / TV on one hand and illegally downloading the very same content on the other hand is difficult to place. 

Next, anti-piracy campaigns could have backfired to some degree. Being called a pirate is not too bad, if you enjoyed the movies. And thieves are only evil, if they get caught - but since so many copyright-infringers get away scot-free, they righteously feel as master-thieves or Robin Hood.

A final factor concerns the perceived legitimacy or justice of copyright laws. Many individuals may believe that copyright laws are unjust:
* Most of your everyday expressions in writing or quick snapshots are worthless. Getting asked for it in itself is already an honor that lets people happily share their work. E.g. children grow up providing all family members with their paintings for free.
* Even if the average person knows some mediocre artists, they usually cannot make a living out of their copyrights. Only live-performances are rewarded with applause, a free meal or a compensation for expenses.
* The audience of copyrighted works outnumbers the authors by thousands or more, but copyright laws only protect very few monopolies.
* Many leaks and scandals prove how easily normal users are ripped off their personal data - Quid pro quo some might take other data back in exchange.
* Having bought an obsolete medium like a video cassette with a favorite movie, owners might feel entitled to get a free format conversion upgrade. Also being trapped in a vendor lock-in people might not find a legal way to port the content they thought they owned over to their preferred player, so they resort to dubious sources.
* Prices of blank media are only a tiny fraction of CD/DVD/Blu-ray with content.
* Incredible wealth of millionaires or even billionaires who live of the scarce pocket money of little children - insane revenues that are completely decoupled from the amount of work that went into the creation.
* Many users of P2P programs believe that large music companies rather than artists are the beneficiaries of the economic rents created by copyright laws.

All this increases the perception of injustice and at the same time lowers the moral sympathy of actually hurting someone you know. The most fervent advocates will engage in public civil disobedience of those parts of copyright law that they believe unjust, in hope of getting an eventual jury nullification or otherwise bringing the issues to public attention.

Although the empirical research on copynorms is limited, important survey research has been done by the Pew Center on Internet and Society.

== Implications ==
Implications of weak copynorms for copyright theory and policy are a large and complex question. 
The content of copyright law may affect the emergence of copynorms. For example, if copyright law is perceived as fair and legitimate, this may strengthen copynorms. Weak copynorms may prevent copyright law from achieving its policy goals. For example, the music industry has argued that P2P has reduced sales, and hence investments in the industry&#x27;s production of new music recordings.

Proposals for more vigorous enforcement of copyright laws against individual users may affect copynorms, although both the direction and magnitude are uncertain. On one hand, more enforcement might strengthen copynorms by expressing social disapproval of illegal copying. On the other hand, strict enforcement might cause a backlash, further weakening social support for the copyright laws.

<doc id="301521" wikidata="Q2450135" url="?curid=301521" title="Functional integration">
<text>Functional integration is a collection of results in mathematics and physics where the domain of an integral is no longer a region of space, but a space of functions. Functional integrals arise in probability, in the study of partial differential equations, and in the path integral approach to the quantum mechanics of particles and fields.

In an ordinary integral (in the sense of Lebesgue integration) there is a function to be integrated (the integrand) and a region of space over which to integrate the function (the domain of integration). The process of integration consists of adding up the values of the integrand for each point of the domain of integration. Making this procedure rigorous requires a limiting procedure, where the domain of integration is divided into smaller and smaller regions. For each small region, the value of the integrand cannot vary much, so it may be replaced by a single value. In a functional integral the domain of integration is a space of functions. For each function, the integrand returns a value to add up. Making this procedure rigorous poses challenges that continue to be topics of current research.

Functional integration was developed by Percy John Daniell in an article of 1919 and Norbert Wiener in a series of studies culminating in his articles of 1921 on Brownian motion. They developed a rigorous method (now known as the Wiener measure) for assigning a probability to a particle&#x27;s random path. Richard Feynman developed another functional integral, the path integral, useful for computing the quantum properties of systems. In Feynman&#x27;s path integral, the classical notion of a unique trajectory for a particle is replaced by an infinite sum of classical paths, each weighted differently according to its classical properties.

Functional integration is central to quantization techniques in theoretical physics. The algebraic properties of functional integrals are used to develop series used to calculate properties in quantum electrodynamics and the standard model of particle physics.

==Functional integration==
Whereas standard Riemann integration sums a function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) over a continuous range of values of &quot;x&quot;, functional integration sums a functional &quot;G&quot;[&quot;f&quot;], which can be thought of as a &quot;function of a function&quot; over a continuous range (or space) of functions &quot;f&quot;. Most functional integrals cannot be evaluated exactly but must be evaluated using perturbation methods. The formal definition of a functional integral is
formula_1

However, in most cases the functions &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) can be written in terms of an infinite series of orthogonal functions such as formula_2, and then the definition becomes
formula_3

which is slightly more understandable. The integral is shown to be a functional integral with a capital formula_4. Sometimes the argument is written in square brackets formula_5, to indicate the functional dependence of the function in the functional integration measure.

==Examples==
Most functional integrals are actually infinite, but often the limit of the quotient of two related functional integrals can still be finite. The functional integrals that can be evaluated exactly usually start with the following Gaussian integral:

:formula_6

in which formula_7. By functionally differentiating this with respect to &quot;J&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and then setting to 0 this becomes an exponential multiplied by a monomial in &quot;f&quot;. To see this, let&#x27;s use the following notation:

formula_8

With this notation the first equation can be written as:

formula_9

Now, taking functional derivatives to the definition of formula_10 and then evaluating in formula_11, one obtains:

formula_12

formula_13

formula_14

which is the result anticipated. More over, by using the first equation one arrives to the useful result:

:formula_15

Putting these results together and backing to the original notation we have:

formula_16

Another useful integral is the functional delta function:

:formula_17

which is useful to specify constraints. Functional integrals can also be done over Grassmann-valued functions formula_18, where formula_19, which is useful in quantum electrodynamics for calculations involving fermions.

==Approaches to path integrals==

Functional integrals where the space of integration consists of paths (&quot;ν&quot; = 1) can be defined in many different ways. The definitions fall in two different classes: the constructions derived from Wiener&#x27;s theory yield an integral based on a measure, whereas the constructions following Feynman&#x27;s path integral do not. Even within these two broad divisions, the integrals are not identical, that is, they are defined differently for different classes of functions.

===The Wiener integral===

In the Wiener integral, a probability is assigned to a class of Brownian motion paths. The class consists of the paths &quot;w&quot; that are known to go through a small region of space at a given time. The passage through different regions of space is assumed independent of each other, and the distance between any two points of the Brownian path is assumed to be Gaussian-distributed with a variance that depends on the time &quot;t&quot; and on a diffusion constant &quot;D&quot;:

:formula_20

The probability for the class of paths can be found by multiplying the probabilities of starting in one region and then being at the next. The Wiener measure can be developed by considering the limit of many small regions.

<text>John Eliot ( – 21 May 1690) was a Puritan missionary to the American Indians who some called &quot;the apostle to the Indians&quot; and the founder of Roxbury Latin School in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1645. In 1660 he completed the enormous task of translating the &quot;Eliot Indian Bible&quot; into the Massachusett Indian language, producing more than two thousand completed copies.

==Early life and education==

Eliot was born in Widford, Hertfordshire, England, and lived at Nazeing as a boy. He attended Jesus College, Cambridge. After college, he became assistant to Thomas Hooker at a private school in Little Baddow, Essex. After Hooker was forced to flee to the Netherlands, Eliot emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, arranging passage as chaplain on the ship &quot;Lyon&quot; and arriving on 3 November 1631. Eliot became minister and &quot;teaching elder&quot; at the First Church in Roxbury.

From 1637 to 1638 Eliot participated in both the civil and church trials of Anne Hutchinson during the Antinomian Controversy. Eliot disapproved of Hutchinson&#x27;s views and actions, and was one of the two ministers representing Roxbury in the proceedings which led to her excommunication and exile. In 1645, Eliot founded the Roxbury Latin School. He and fellow ministers Thomas Weld (also of Roxbury), Thomas Mayhew of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and Richard Mather of Dorchester, are credited with editing the Bay Psalm Book, the first book published in the British North American colonies (1640). From 1649 to 1674, Samuel Danforth assisted Eliot in his Roxbury ministry.

=== Roxbury and Dorchester, Massachusetts ===
There are many connections between the towns of Roxbury and Dorchester and John Eliot. After working for a short time as pastor in Boston as the temporary replacement for John Wilson at Boston&#x27;s first church society, John Eliot settled in Roxbury with other Puritans from Essex, England. He was the teacher at The First Church in Roxbury for sixty years and was their sole pastor for forty years.

For the first forty years in Roxbury, Eliot preached in the 20-foot by 30-foot meetinghouse with thatched roof and plastered walls that stood on Meetinghouse Hill. Eliot founded the Roxbury Grammar School and he worked hard to keep it prosperous and relevant. Eliot also preached at times in the Dorchester church, he was given land by Dorchester for use in his missionary efforts. And in 1649 he gave half of a donation he received from a man in London to the schoolmaster of Dorchester.

=== Use of the Massachusett language ===

The chief barrier to preaching to the American Indians was language. Gestures and pidgin English were used for trade but could not be used to convey a sermon. John Eliot began to study the Massachusett or Wampanoag language, which was the language of the local Indians. To help him with this task, Eliot relied on a young Indian named &quot;Cockenoe&quot;. Cockenoe had been captured in the Pequot War of 1637 and became a servant of an Englishman named Richard Collicott. John Eliot said, &quot;he was the first that I made use of to teach me words, and to be my interpreter.&quot; Cockenoe could not write but he could speak Massachusett and English. With his help, Eliot was able to translate the Ten Commandments, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and other scriptures and prayers.

In 1660 Eliot had also translated the Bible from English to the Massachusett Indian language, and had it printed by Marmaduke Johnson and Samuel Green on the press in Cambridge, Massachusetts. By 1663, Marmaduke and Green had printed 1,180 volumes of the Old and New Testaments translated from English to the Massachusett Indian language.

The first time Eliot attempted to preach to Indians (led by Cutshamekin) in 1646 at Dorchester Mills, he failed and said that they, &quot;gave no heed unto it, but were weary and despised what I said.&quot; The second time he preached to the Indians was at the wigwam of Waban near Watertown Mill which was later called Nonantum, now Newton, MA. John Eliot was not the first Puritan missionary to try to convert the Indians to Christianity but he was the first to produce printed publications for the Algonquian Indians in their own language.

This was important because the settlements of &quot;praying Indians&quot; could be provided with other preachers and teachers to continue the work John Eliot started. By translating sermons to the Massachusett language, John Eliot brought the Indians an understanding of Christianity but also an understanding of written language. They did not have an equivalent written &quot;alphabet&quot; of their own and relied mainly on spoken language and pictorial language.

==Missionary career==

An important part of Eliot&#x27;s ministry focused on the conversion of Massachusett and other Algonquian Indians. Accordingly, Eliot translated the Bible into the Massachusett language and published it in 1663 as &quot;Mamusse Wunneetupanatamwe Up-Biblum God&quot;. It was the first complete Bible printed in the Western hemisphere; Samuel Green and Marmaduke Johnson printed 1,000 copies on the first printing press in British American colonies. Indigenous people including the Nipmuc James Printer (Wowaus) engaged in the creation of this Bible.

In 1666, Eliot published &quot;The Indian Grammar Begun&quot;, again concerning the Massachusetts language. As a missionary, Eliot strove to consolidate the Algonquian Indians in planned towns, thereby encouraging them to recreate a Christian society. At one point, there were 14 towns of so-called &quot;Praying Indians&quot;, the best documented being at Natick, Massachusetts. Other praying Indian towns included: Littleton (Nashoba), Lowell (Wamesit, initially incorporated as part of Chelmsford), Grafton (Hassanamessit), Marlborough (Okommakamesit), a portion of Hopkinton that is now in the Town of Ashland (Makunkokoag), Canton (Punkapoag), and Mendon-Uxbridge (Wacentug). The &quot;Praying Towns&quot; were recorded by seventeenth-century settlers including Daniel Gookin.

In 1662, Eliot witnessed the signing of the deed for Mendon with Nipmuck Indians for &quot;Squinshepauk Plantation&quot;. Eliot&#x27;s better intentions can be seen in his involvement in the legal case, The Town of Dedham v. The Indians of Natick, which concerned a boundary dispute. Besides answering Dedham&#x27;s complaint point by point, Eliot stated that the colony&#x27;s purpose was to benefit the Algonquian people.

Praying Indian towns were also established by other missionaries, including the Presbyterian Samson Occom, himself of Mohegan descent. All praying Indian towns suffered disruption during King Philip&#x27;s War (1675), and for the most part lost their special status as Indian self-governing communities in the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, in some cases being paid to move to Wisconsin and other areas further West.

Eliot also wrote &quot;The Christian Commonwealth: or, The Civil Policy Of The Rising Kingdom of Jesus Christ&quot;, considered the first book on politics written by an American, as well as the first book to be banned by a North American governmental unit. Written in the late 1640s, and published in England in 1659, it proposed a new model of civil government based on the system Eliot instituted among the converted Indians, which was based in turn on the government Moses instituted among the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 18).

Eliot asserted that &quot;Christ is the only right Heir of the Crown of England,&quot; and called for an elected theocracy in England and throughout the world. The accession to the throne of Charles II of England made the book an embarrassment to the Massachusetts colony. In 1661 the General Court forced Eliot to issue a public retraction and apology, banned the book and ordered all copies destroyed.

In 1709 a special edition of the Massachusett Bible was co-authored by Experience Mayhew and Thomas Prince with the Indian words in one column and the English words in the opposite column. The 1709 Massachusett Bible text book is also referred to as the &quot;Massachusett Psalter&quot;. This 1709 edition is based on the Geneva Bible, like the Eliot Indian Bible.

==Family==

John Eliot married Hanna Mumford in September 1632, the first entry in the &quot;Marages of the Inhabitants of Roxbury&quot; record. They had six children, five sons and one daughter. Their daughter Hannah Eliot married Habbakuk Glover . Their son, John Eliot, Jr., was the first pastor of the First Church of Christ in Newton, Another son, Joseph Eliot, became a pastor in Guilford, Connecticut, and later fathered Jared Eliot, a noted agricultural writer and pastor. John Eliot&#x27;s sister, Mary Eliot, married Edward Payson, founder of the Payson family in America, and great-great-grandfather of the Rev. Edward Payson. He was also an ancestor of Lewis E. Stanton a United States attorney for the District of Connecticut. He is related to the Bacon family.

==Death==
Eliot died in 1690, aged 85, his last words being &quot;welcome joy!&quot; His descendants became one branch of a Boston Brahmin family. The historic cemetery in Roxbury, Massachusetts, was named Eliot Burying Ground.

==Legacy==

Natick remembers him with a monument on the grounds of the Bacon Free Library. The John Eliot Elementary School in Needham, Massachusetts, founded in 1956, is named after him. Puritan &quot;remembrancer&quot; Cotton Mather called his missionary career the epitome of the ideals of New England Puritanism. William Carey considered Eliot alongside the Apostle Paul and David Brainerd (1718–1747) as &quot;canonized heroes&quot; and &quot;enkindlers&quot; in his groundbreaking &quot;An Enquiry Into the Obligation of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathen&quot; (1792).

In 1689, he donated of land to support the Eliot School in what was then Roxbury&#x27;s Jamaica Plain district and now is a historic Boston neighborhood. Two other Puritans had donated land on which to build the school in 1676, but boarding students especially required support. Eliot&#x27;s donation required the school (renamed in his honor) to accept both Black and Native American students without prejudice, which was very unusual at the time. The school continues near its original location today, with continued admissions of all ethnicities, but now includes lifelong learning.

The city seal of Newton, MA depicts Eliot preaching to an indigenous audience. Present-day Newton is the site of Eliot’s first sermons to the Natives, which took place in Waban’s wigwam among what would be later called the Nonantum Indian community starting on October 28, 1646. A nineteenth-century monument commemorates the event on Eliot Memorial Road, Newton. 

The town of Eliot, Maine which was in Massachusetts during its incorporation was named after John Eliot.

Eliot appears in the alternate history &quot;1632 Series&quot; anthology collection &quot;1637: The Coast of Chaos.&quot; His wife is killed shortly after the birth of their first child by French soldiers invading the Thirteen Colonies. A group of time travelers bring a book about the world they come from that allows Eliot to read about how much of his works were undone by his fellow colonists, he then sets out to alter his missionary efforts in a manner that will prevent Native American converts from being vulnerable to the treachery they faced in the old timeline.

<text>A Coruña is a province in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain, that is divided into 93 municipalities. Spanish census, the province is the 12th largest by population, with inhabitants, and the 32nd largest by land area, spanning . Municipalities are the basic local political division in Spain and can only belong to one province. They enjoy a large degree of autonomy in their local administration, being in charge of tasks such as urban planning, water supply, lighting, roads, local police, and firefighting.

The organisation of municipalities in Spain is outlined in a local government law (; ) passed on 2 April 1985 and finalised by an 18 April 1986 royal decree. The Statute of Autonomy of A Coruña also contains provisions concerning the relations between the municipalities and the autonomous government of A Coruña. All citizens of Spain are required to register in the municipality in which they reside. Each municipality is a corporation with independent legal personhood: its governing body is called the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; (municipal council or corporation), a term often also used to refer to the municipal offices (city and town halls). The &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; is composed of the mayor (), the deputy mayors (&quot;tenientes de alcalde&quot;) and the plenary assembly (&quot;pleno&quot;) of councillors (&quot;concejales&quot;). Municipalities are categorised by population for the purpose of determining the number of councillors: three when the population is up to 100 inhabitants, five for 101250, seven for 2511,000, nine for 1,0012,000, eleven for 2,0015,000, thirteen for 5,00110,000, seventeen for 10,00120,000, twenty-one for 20,00150,000, and twenty-five for 50,001100,000.

The mayor and the deputy mayors are elected by the plenary assembly, which is itself elected by universal suffrage. Elections in municipalities with more than 250 inhabitants are carried out following a proportional representation system with closed lists, whilst those with a population lower than 250 use a block plurality voting system with open lists. The plenary assembly must meet periodically at the seat of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot;, with meetings occurring more or less frequently depending on the population of the municipality: monthly for those whose population is larger than 20,000, once every two months if it ranges between 5,001 and 20,000, and once every three months if it does not exceed 5,000. Many &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; also have a local governing board (), which is named by the mayor from amongst the councillors and is required for municipalities of more than 5,000 inhabitants. The board, whose role is to assist the mayor between meetings of the plenary assembly, may not include more than one third of the councillors. The Galician name is the sole official although older or informal texts may use the Spanish language forms or spellings.

The largest municipality by population in the province as of the 2023 Spanish census is A Coruña, its capital, with 249,964 residents, while the smallest is Vilarmaior, with 1231 residents.

<text>Percy Spencer (July 19, 1894 – September 8, 1970) was an American physicist, electrical engineer and inventor, known as the inventor of the microwave oven.

==Early life==
Jack was born in Howland, Maine. Eighteen months later, Spencer&#x27;s father died, and his mother soon left him in the care of his aunt and uncle. His uncle then died when Spencer was just seven years old. Spencer subsequently left grammar school to earn money to support himself and his aunt. From the ages of twelve to sixteen, he worked from sunrise to sunset at a spool mill. At the later age, he discovered that a local paper mill was soon to begin using electricity, a concept little known in his rural home region, and he began learning as much as possible about the phenomenon. When he applied to work at the mill, he was one of three people hired to install electricity in the plant, despite never having received any formal training in electrical engineering or even finishing grammar school.

At the age of 18, Spencer decided to join the U.S. Navy. He had become interested in wireless communications after learning about the wireless operators aboard the Titanic when it sank. In the Navy he made himself an expert on radio technology: &quot;I just got hold of a lot of textbooks and taught myself while I was standing watch at night.&quot; He also subsequently taught himself trigonometry, calculus, chemistry, physics, and metallurgy.

==Career==
By 1939, Percy became one of the world&#x27;s leading experts in radar tube design. Spencer worked at Raytheon, a contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense, as the chief of the power tube division. While working at Raytheon, Spencer developed a more efficient way to manufacture magnetrons, increasing production from 100 to 2600 magnetrons per day. With his reputation and expertise, Spencer helped Raytheon win a government contract to develop and produce combat radar equipment for M.I.T.’s Radiation Laboratory. This was of huge importance to the Allies of World War II and became the military&#x27;s second-highest priority project during World War II, behind the Manhattan Project. For his work, he was awarded the Distinguished Public Service Award by the U.S. Navy.

According to legend, one day while building magnetrons, Spencer was standing in front of an active radar set when he noticed the candy bar he had in his pocket melted. Spencer was not the first to notice this phenomenon, but he was the first to investigate it. He decided to experiment using food, including popcorn kernels, which became the world&#x27;s first microwaved popcorn. In another experiment, an egg was placed in a tea kettle, and the magnetron was placed directly above it. The result was the egg exploding in the face of one of his co-workers, who was looking in the kettle to observe. Spencer then created the first true microwave oven by attaching a high-density electromagnetic field generator to an enclosed metal box. The magnetron emitted microwaves into the metal box blocking any escape and allowing for controlled and safe experimentation. He then placed various food items in the box, while observing the effects and monitoring temperatures. There are no credible primary sources that verify this story. 

Raytheon filed a U.S. Patent application on October 8, 1945, for a microwave cooking oven. In 1947, the first commercially produced microwave oven was about 6 feet tall, weighed about 750 lbs, and cost about $5,000 (). In 1967 the first more affordable, $495 (), and reasonably sized (counter-top) Radarange brand microwave oven was made available for sale, produced by Amana (a division of Raytheon).

Spencer became Senior Vice President and a Senior Member of the Board of Directors at Raytheon. He received 300 patents during his career. Originally, a Raytheon facility in Burlington, Massachusetts involved in vacuum tube development and manufacturing was named Spencer Labs after Spencer. This facility was eventually closed. Later, a new building at the Raytheon Missile Defense Center in Woburn, Massachusetts, was named in his honor. Other achievements and awards, besides the Distinguished Public Service Award, included membership of the Institute of Radio Engineers, Fellowship in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and an Honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Massachusetts, despite having no formal education.

For his invention, Spencer received no royalties, but he was paid a one-time $2.00 gratuity from Raytheon, the same token payment the company made to all inventors on its payroll at that time for company patents.

==Personal life==
Spencer and his wife, Louise, had three children: John, James, and George. He counted Vannevar Bush, Omar Bradley, William Redington Hewlett and David Packard as friends. Later, he married Lillian Ottenheimer on November 18, 1960.

==Legacy==
Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, which deals extensively in radar systems, named a building after Spencer in the Woburn, Massachusetts facility. An early Radarange model sits in the lobby, across from the dining center.

The plenary assembly must meet periodically at the seat of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot;, with meetings occurring more or less frequently depending on the population of the municipality: monthly for those whose population is larger than 20,000, once every two months if it ranges between 5,001 and 20,000, and once every three months if it does not exceed 5,000. Many &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; also have a local governing board (), which is named by the mayor from amongst the councillors and is required for municipalities of more than 5,000 inhabitants. The board, whose role is to assist the mayor between meetings of the plenary assembly, may not include more than one third of the councillors.

The largest municipality by population in the province as of the 2023 Spanish census is Cuenca, its capital, with 53,630 residents, while the smallest is Abia de la Obispalía, with 61 residents. The largest municipality by area is also Cuenca, which spans 910.88 km2, while Casas de Guijarro is the smallest at 8.20 km2.

<text>HackMaster is a fantasy role-playing game produced by Kenzer &amp; Company. It began as a fictional game, a parody of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; played by the characters of the &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; comic strip by Jolly R. Blackburn. The characters in the comic began playing fictional &quot;HackMaster 3rd Edition&quot;, which was updated and published in 2001 as a numerously revised 4th edition. It has been hinted the name of the game was originally changed for copyright reasons.

The current 5th edition has removed most of the parody aspects, and contains game mechanics written from scratch in order to avoid any intellectual property problems.

==Publication history==
Kenzer &amp; Company received many requests from fans of the comic to produce an actual &quot;HackMaster&quot; game, but initially they thought that licensing &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; would be impossible. In 1999 the &quot;Dragon Magazine Archive&quot; software was published where Wizards of the Coast failed to get permission to reprint many of the original articles such as the &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; comic in the electronic media archive. A contract dispute was settled out of court, they reached an agreement about creating a derivative work, that led to K&amp;C&#x27;s publication of &quot;HackMaster 4th Edition&quot; in 2001. As a nod to the fictional version from the comic, this first edition of &quot;Hackmaster&quot; was published as the 4th Edition.

Since its release in 2001, &quot;HackMaster&quot; has evolved into a full-fledged role-playing game, spawning over forty add-ons, supplements and game aids. Most notable products include a 32-panel gamemaster&#x27;s shield, a 16-page character sheet and a 10-volume monster encyclopedia. The &quot;Hacklopedia of Beasts&quot;, the &quot;Hackmaster&quot; version of the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, was next released as eight separate volumes. These books were somewhat optional as creature statistics from the 1st and 2nd edition versions of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (AD&amp;D) were compatible with &quot;Hackmaster&quot;. K&amp;C later released the &quot;Hackmaster Field Manual&quot;, which contained the more popular &quot;Hackmaster&quot; creatures in a single volume.

Whereas Wizards of the Coast overhauled the rules for 3rd edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, Kenzer &amp; Company took the opposite action by revising the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; First and Second Edition rules (including various supplements such as 1st Edition &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; and &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; and the mid-1990s &quot;Skills &amp; Powers&quot; supplements) into a more coherent system and adding an element of parody. In part of that ability to use &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rules, K&amp;C was required to maintain a higher level of humor than in the &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; comic for products that are revised from previous &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; material. Completely original works for &quot;Hackmaster&quot; are not subject to this restriction imposed by Wizards of the Coast.

In 2002, &quot;HackMaster&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Game of the Year 2001&quot;.

The first rulebook for the new edition, HackMaster Basic, was sent out to preorderers on June 19, 2009. HackMaster Basic was created due to Kenzer&#x27;s licensing for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; running out. The title is a nod to the Dungeons and Dragons Basic Set, although HackMaster Basic was re-written so as to not contain any copyrighted material from Wizards of the Coast.

The game includes an official player&#x27;s handbook, an alternate campaign setting changed from Garweeze Wurld to Kingdoms of Kalamar, a comprehensive, one-volume bestiary called the Hacklopedia of Beasts, and a GM&#x27;s guide. Also provided are a pantheon of gods and attendant rituals and spells for the cleric class to choose from.

==Mechanics==
Some of the game rule changes include a count-up system, as opposed to a &quot;combat round&quot; type of in-game time-keeping method. Players plan their actions second-by-second, with little or no down time between actions. Player characters in combat actively defend as well as attack and various combat maneuvers are offered to create a more realistic feel to the hostile encounter.
The magic system has been overhauled to use spell points rather than a fixed number of spells. Clerics are no longer a single class, but are specific to the various deities within the pantheon.

==Setting==
In 4th edition, the official setting of Hackmaster was Garweeze Wurld, a giant continent on the planet Aldrazar based on the notes of Jolly Blackburn. This has been developed in the &quot;Garweeze Wurld Atlas&quot; and &quot;Garweeze Wurld Gazetteer&quot;. Garweeze Wurld is about eight thousand miles across, circling much of the northern hemisphere of its planet. The continent is mapped based on forty-eight &quot;sectors&quot;, each one thousand miles across. The continent reaches from the tropical band of Aldrazar to its Arctic Circle. The name Garweeze Wurld was a play on the name of the fictional creator of Hackmaster in &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot;, Gary Jackson, who is himself a parody of both &quot;D&amp;D&quot; co-creator Gary Gygax and Steve Jackson of Steve Jackson Games.

In the 5th edition of the game, the setting has been switched to Kenzerco&#x27;s &quot;Kingdoms of Kalamar&quot; (KoK) setting. KoK was originally developed as a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; setting, and has been detailed in several supplements and adventures. Developers for Kenzerco have stated on their forums that the world will not be significantly altered for HM 5th.

== Adventure modules ==
The following premade adventures were published for both 4th and 5th edition of the game. Most of the 4th edition adventures are parody and alteration of the TSR era &quot;D&amp;D&quot; modules.

<doc id="301562" wikidata="Q55339811" url="?curid=301562" title="Flip the Frog">
<text>Flip the Frog is an animated cartoon character created by American animator Ub Iwerks. He starred in a series of cartoons produced by Celebrity Pictures and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1930 to 1933. The series had many recurring characters, including Flip&#x27;s dog, the mule Orace, and a dizzy neighborhood spinster.

==History==
Ub Iwerks was an animator for the Walt Disney Studios and a personal friend of Walt Disney. In 1930, after a series of disputes between the two, Iwerks left Disney and went on to accept an offer from Pat Powers to open a cartoon studio of his own, Iwerks Studio, and receive a salary of $300 a week, an offer that Disney was unable to match at the time.

Iwerks was to produce new cartoons under Powers&#x27; Celebrity Pictures auspices and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The first series he was to produce was to feature a character called Tony the Frog, but Iwerks disliked the name and was subsequently changed to Flip.

Ub Iwerks planned to release the series in both color and black and white versions through Celebrity Productions, Inc. The series attracted public attention in England by being the first color sound cartoon series, in the two-color British Multicolor System. These shorts were exhibited in England in color, but not in the United States where they were made. After four shorts had been produced (&quot;Fiddlesticks&quot;, &quot;Flying Fists&quot;, &quot;Little Orphan Willie&quot; and &quot;Puddle Pranks&quot;) MGM picked up the series. They agreed to exhibit &quot;Fiddlesticks&quot; and &quot;Flying Fists&quot;. &quot;Little Orphan Willie&quot; and &quot;Puddle Pranks&quot; were never copyrighted and remain in the public domain. MGM decided to produce the series entirely in black and white, releasing the ones produced in color in black and white versions only. Some have speculated that &quot;Techno-Cracked&quot; (1933) may have been photographed in Cinecolor. The Cinecolor process was a new two-color process that came out in 1932, the year that Technicolor began phasing out its two-color system in favor of their new three-strip process. Iwerks would go on to make extensive use of Cinecolor with his ComiColor Cartoon series.

Iwerks&#x27; studio quickly began accumulating new talent, such as animators Fred Kopietz, Irv Spence, Grim Natwick, and Chuck Jones (who worked at the Iwerks studio as a cel-washer before going on to inbetweening and then animating at the Leon Schlesinger studio). After the first two cartoons, the appearance of Flip the Frog gradually became less froglike. This was done under the encouragement of MGM, who thought that the series would sell better if the character were more humanized. Flip&#x27;s major redesign is attributed to Grim Natwick, who made a name for himself at the Fleischer Studios with the creation of Betty Boop. Natwick also had a hand in changing Flip&#x27;s girlfriend. In earlier films, she was consistently a cat, but Natwick made Flip&#x27;s new girlfriend, Fifi, a human who shared distinct similarities with Betty (even down to her spit curls).

The frog&#x27;s personality also began to develop. As the series progressed, Flip became more of a down-and-out, Chaplin-esque character who always found himself in everyday conflicts surrounding the poverty-stricken atmosphere of the Great Depression. Owing to the influx of New York City animators to Iwerks&#x27; studio, such as Natwick, the shorts became increasingly risqué. In &quot;Room Runners&quot; (1932), Flip, out of cash and luck, attempts to sneak out of his hotel in order to avoid paying his past-due rent. Another gag has Flip watch a girl taking a shower through a keyhole. In &quot;The Office Boy&quot;, released the same year, Flip tries to secure a low-level office job and meets a shapely secretary. At one point in the short, a mischievous mouse that Flip tries to apprehend scoots up the secretary&#x27;s skirt. In &quot;A Chinaman&#x27;s Chance&quot; (1933), Flip and his dog track down the notorious Chinese criminal Chow Mein. While investigating in a Chinese laundry, Flip stumbles into an opium den, inhales the drug though an opium pipe he takes from a sleeping junkie, and begins hallucinating.

The character eventually wore out his welcome at MGM. His final short was &quot;Soda Squirt&quot;, released in August 1933. Subsequently, Iwerks replaced the series with a new one starring an imaginative child named Willie Whopper. Flip became largely forgotten by the public in the ensuing years, but the character would make a small comeback when animation enthusiasts and historians began digging up the old Iwerks shorts. All of the Flip cartoons are now available in the 2004 Region 2 &quot;Flip the Frog&quot; DVD set released by Mk2/Lobster in France. Most are available in Region 1, in particular on the &quot;Cartoons That Time Forgot&quot; series.

==Flip the Frog Annual==
In 1931, a &quot;Flip the Frog Annual&quot; was issued in England by Dean &amp; Son Ltd. Published &quot;by exclusive arrangement with Ub Iwerks, the originator of the film character, Flip The Frog&quot;, it was drawn by Wilfred Haughton, who also drew the early &quot;Mickey Mouse Annuals&quot; for Dean. The Annual only ran for one edition, based on Flip&#x27;s ending in 1933 and the lack of success with it. The earlier, more frog-like character was used rather than the later version. The book contains 11 full cartoon strip stories, 4 colour plates and other one-page items that are not derived from any of his cartoons. All the adventures take place outside, unlike the cartoons, and feature additional characters, including a mischievous boy fox (&quot;Freddie&quot;), a policeman (&quot;Robert&quot;), an Uncle Flop (mentioned only), and others not shown in the cartoon films. An additional cartoon co-star included is Flap, Flip&#x27;s frog girlfriend from &quot;Puddle Pranks&quot; (1930).

==Flip the Frog filmography==
===1930===

1 &quot;Little Orphan Willie&quot; and &quot;Puddle Pranks&quot; were both rejected by MGM and never copyrighted. They were released domestically by Celebrity Productions, Inc., which also released &quot;Fiddlesticks&quot; and &quot;Flying Fists&quot; before the series was picked up by MGM. They were also released in Europe by other distributors, including the UK&#x27;s Showman Films.&lt;br&gt;
2 First cartoon produced for MGM, though rejected and not released by them; variant nitrate elements exist that present it with MGM titles. The 2023 Thunderbean Blu-ray collection includes this version as an alternate.&lt;br&gt;

===1931===
===1932===

1 Retitled as &quot;Phoney Express&quot; when the cartoon was reissued by Pat Powers.

===1933===

1 Possibly filmed in color.

==Home media==
Thirty-seven of Flip&#x27;s cartoons were compiled on the French Mk2/Lobster Films 2004 2-disc DVD set &quot;Flip the Frog&quot;. Twenty-seven of Flip&#x27;s cartoons are included in the two DVD collections &quot;Cartoons That Time Forgot: The Ub Iwerks Collection,&quot; Vol. 1 and 2.

Another early Flip short, &quot;Little Orphan Willie&quot;, while not included on any of the above DVD releases, is included on the DVD collection &quot;Return of the 30s Characters&quot; from Thunderbean Animation.

All thirty-eight of Flip&#x27;s cartoons were released restored on Blu-ray in October 2023 by Thunderbean Animation. The Blu-ray has an introduction by documentary filmmaker and Ub Iwerks&#x27; granddaughter Leslie Iwerks.

==In popular culture==
A clip of the character tap-dancing on a turtle from &quot;Fiddlesticks&quot; is featured on a television set in the music video for Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, which a viewer laughs at.

Footage from &quot;Room Runners&quot; is featured during the intro sequence of the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Children of a Lesser Bog&quot;.

In the &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; episode &quot;The Great Muppet Cartoon Show&quot;, footage from &quot;Funny Face&quot; appears during the &quot;We Love Cartoons&quot; song.

<text>Protea () is a genus of South African flowering plants, also called sugarbushes (Afrikaans: &quot;suikerbos&quot;). It is the type genus of the Proteaceae family.

About 92% of the species occur only in the Cape Floristic Region, a narrow belt of mountainous coastal land from Clanwilliam to Grahamstown, South Africa. Most protea species are found south of the Limpopo River. &quot;Protea madiensis&quot; grows in Afromontane enclaves across tropical Africa, from Guinea to Sudan, Mozambique, and Angola. &quot;Protea afra&quot; ranges from the Cape region to Uganda and Kenya, including in the chaparral zone of Mount Kenya National Park. The extraordinary richness and diversity of species characteristic of the Cape flora are thought to be caused in part by the diverse landscape, where populations can become isolated from each other and in time develop into separate species.

== Etymology ==
The genus &quot;Protea&quot; was named in 1735 by Carl Linnaeus when he was examining male and female plants of a species now known as &quot;Leucadendron argenteum&quot; which are very different from each other; he misunderstood them to be two different species, and he compared those forms to the ability of Greek god Proteus who could change his form at will. Linnaeus&#x27;s genus was formed by merging several genera previously published by Herman Boerhaave, although precisely which of Boerhaave&#x27;s genera were included in Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Protea&quot; varied with each of Linnaeus&#x27;s publications.

== Taxonomy ==
The family Proteaceae to which &quot;Protea&quot; species belong is an ancient one among angiosperms. Evidence from pollen fossils suggests Proteaceae ancestors grew in Gondwana, in the Upper Cretaceous, 75–80 million years ago. The Proteaceae are divided into two subfamilies: the Proteoideae, best represented in southern Africa, and the Grevilleoideae, concentrated in Australia and South America and the other smaller segments of Gondwana that are now part of eastern Asia. Africa shares only one genus with Madagascar, whereas South America and Australia share many common genera – this indicates they separated from Africa before they separated from each other.

== Description ==
Proteas usually flower during spring. Protea flowers have large heads made of small florets packed on a woody receptacle, each floret is reddish or pinkish in color and measures between 28.4 and 53.8 millimeters. The carpel in the flower&#x27;s center is cream colored. The ovary is protected by the receptacle, and thus is not seen when looking at the flower, but the anthers are present at the top of the flower, which can then easily transfer the pollen to the vectors.

Proteas are pollinated by birds, insects, and wind. All the florets open big enough for small and medium beetles to land and feed on their nectar before flying to other heads pollinating them in the process. Some protea flower species, like the king protea flower, are self-pollinating flowers. Other protea species, however, such as &quot;P. cordata&quot;, &quot;P. decurrens&quot;, and &quot;P. scabra&quot; are self-incompatible, and thus rely on cross-pollination for successive seed sets. Some &quot;Protea&quot; species exhibit both self-pollination and cross-pollination as a method of reproduction. Cross-pollination is preferred, though, as a method of reproduction because it provides genetic diversity in the population. When cultivating proteas, breeders use hand pollination as a controlled method to transfer pollen from one flower to another. 

=== Genetics ===
The common Proteaceae plants, e.g. &quot;Protea&quot;, &quot;Leucospermum&quot;, and &quot;Leucadendron&quot; are diploid organisms, thus they can freely hybridize with closely related species to form new cultivars. Unusually, not all the genera within the family Proteaceae can hybridize freely; for example, &quot;Leucadendron&quot; species cannot be crossed with &quot;Leucospermum&quot; species because of the difference in their haploid chromosome number (13 and 12, respectively). This genetic incompatibility results in pollinated flowers that yield either no fruit, or seedless fruit, as the resulting plant embryos, from the incompatible pollen and ovum, fail to develop.
==Botanical history==
Proteas attracted the attention of botanists visiting the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th century. Many species were introduced to Europe in the 18th century, enjoying a unique popularity at the time amongst botanists.

== Cultivation ==
Proteas are currently cultivated in over 20 countries. Cultivation is restricted to Mediterranean and subtropical climates. Three categories of traits have to be considered before developing a new cultivar. The yield or production capacity of the cultivar must be considered. The ease of handling and packaging of the cut stems and the last category is to consider the perceived market value of the cultivar. The cultivation of a &quot;Protea &quot;plant is time-consuming, so good planning when developing the cross combinations and goals are of great importance of the breeding programme.

==Classification==
Within the huge family Proteaceae, they are a member of the subfamily Proteoideae, which has Southern African and Australian members.

<text>Guadalajara is a province in the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha, Spain, that is divided into 288 municipalities. Spanish census, the province is the 42nd largest by population, with inhabitants, and the 17th largest by land area, spanning . Municipalities are the basic local political division in Spain, and can only belong to one province. They enjoy a large degree of autonomy in their local administration, being in charge of tasks such as urban planning, water supply, lighting, roads, local police, and firefighting.

The organisation of municipalities in Spain is outlined in a local government law (; ) passed on 2 April 1985 and finalised by an 18 April 1986 royal decree. The Statute of Autonomy of Castilla–La Mancha also contains provisions concerning the relations between the municipalities and the autonomous government of Castilla–La Mancha. All citizens of Spain are required to register in the municipality in which they reside. Each municipality is a corporation with independent legal personhood: its governing body is called the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; (municipal council or corporation), a term often also used to refer to the municipal offices (city and town halls). The &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; is composed of the mayor (), the deputy mayors (&quot;tenientes de alcalde&quot;) and the plenary assembly (&quot;pleno&quot;) of councillors (&quot;concejales&quot;). Municipalities are categorised by population for the purpose of determining the number of councillors: three when the population is up to 100 inhabitants, five for 101250, seven for 2511,000, nine for 1,0012,000, eleven for 2,0015,000, thirteen for 5,00110,000, seventeen for 10,00120,000, twenty-one for 20,00150,000, and twenty-five for 50,001100,000.

The mayor and the deputy mayors are elected by the plenary assembly, which is itself elected by universal suffrage. Elections in municipalities with more than 250 inhabitants are carried out following a proportional representation system with closed lists, whilst those with a population lower than 250 use a block plurality voting system with open lists. The plenary assembly must meet periodically at the seat of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot;, with meetings occurring more or less frequently depending on the population of the municipality: monthly for those whose population is larger than 20,000, once every two months if it ranges between 5,001 and 20,000, and once every three months if it does not exceed 5,000. Many &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; also have a local governing board (), which is named by the mayor from amongst the councillors and is required for municipalities of more than 5,000 inhabitants. The board, whose role is to assist the mayor between meetings of the plenary assembly, may not include more than one third of the councillors.

The largest municipality by population in the province as of the 2023 Spanish census is Guadalajara, its capital, with 88,886 residents, while the smallest is Torremochuela, with 6 residents. The largest municipality by area is Sigüenza, which spans 386.87 km2, while Torre del Burgo is the smallest at 4.91 km2.

<doc id="301574" wikidata="Q190135" url="?curid=301574" title="The Little Mermaid (1989 film)">
<text>The Little Mermaid is a 1989 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation in association with Silver Screen Partners IV and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is loosely based on the 1837 Danish fairy tale &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen. The film was written and directed by John Musker and Ron Clements and produced by Musker and Howard Ashman, who also wrote the film&#x27;s songs with Alan Menken, who also composed the film&#x27;s score. Featuring the voices of René Auberjonois, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Jodi Benson, Pat Carroll, Paddi Edwards, Buddy Hackett, Jason Marin, Kenneth Mars, Ben Wright, and Samuel E. Wright, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; tells the story of a teenage mermaid princess named Ariel, who dreams of becoming human and falls in love with a human prince named Eric, which leads her to make a magic deal with the sea witch, Ursula, to become human and be with him.

Walt Disney planned to put the story in a proposed package film containing Andersen&#x27;s stories, but scrapped the project. In 1985, while working on &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986), Clements and Musker decided to adapt the fairy tale and proposed it to Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who initially declined due to its similarities to a proposed sequel to the 1984 film &quot;Splash&quot;, but ultimately approved of it. Ashman became involved and brought in Menken. With supervision from Katzenberg, they made a Broadway-style structure with musical numbers as the staff was working on &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988). Katzenberg warned that the film would earn less since it appealed to female viewers, but he eventually became convinced that it would be Disney&#x27;s first blockbuster hit.

&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was released in theaters on November 17, 1989, to critical acclaim, earning praise for the animation, music, and characters. It was also a commercial success, garnering $84 million at the domestic box office during its initial release, and in total lifetime gross worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1989. Along with the major success of both Disney&#x27;s 1986 animated film &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; and the 1988 Disney/Amblin live-action/animated film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is given credit for breathing life back into the art of Disney animated feature films after some films produced by Disney were struggling. It also marked the start of the era known as the Disney Renaissance. The film won two Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Best Original Song (&quot;Under the Sea&quot;).

The film&#x27;s success led to a media franchise. A direct-to-video sequel was released in 2000, focusing on Ariel&#x27;s daughter, Melody. A prequel followed in 2008. The first film was adapted into a stage musical with a book by Doug Wright and additional songs by Alan Menken and new lyricist Glenn Slater opened in Denver in July 2007 and began performances on Broadway January 10, 2008 starring Sierra Boggess. Other derived works and material inspired by the film, include a 2019 live musical presentation on ABC as part of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, and a 2023 live-action film adaptation directed by Rob Marshall and starring Halle Bailey. In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

Under the Atlantic Ocean, in the kingdom of Atlantica, Ariel, a mermaid dissatisfied with her life, is fascinated by the human world and collects human artifacts in her grotto. With her best friend Flounder, Ariel visits Scuttle, a seagull who gives inaccurate information about humans. However, her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, says contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden. One night, Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton&#x27;s adviser and court composer, travel to the surface to watch a birthday celebration for Prince Eric. Ariel falls in love with Eric at first sight. A storm wrecks the ship and knocks Eric overboard. Ariel rescues Eric and brings him to shore. She sings to him, but leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Discovering a change in Ariel&#x27;s behavior, Triton questions Sebastian and learns of her love for Eric. Outraged, Triton travels to Ariel&#x27;s grotto and destroys her collection of artifacts in a misguided attempt to protect her. After a remorseful Triton leaves, two eels named Flotsam and Jetsam convince Ariel to visit Ursula the sea witch.

Ursula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel&#x27;s voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. If Ariel receives a &quot;true love&#x27;s kiss&quot; within these three days, she will remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. After accepting, Ariel is given human legs and taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Furious at Ariel&#x27;s close success, Ursula disguises herself as a young woman named Vanessa and appears onshore singing with Ariel&#x27;s voice. Eric recognizes the song, and Ursula casts a hypnotic enchantment that makes him forget about Ariel.

The next day, Ariel discovers that Eric will be married to Vanessa. Scuttle discovers Vanessa&#x27;s true identity and informs Ariel, who pursues the wedding barge. Sebastian informs Triton, and Scuttle disrupts the wedding with the help of various sea animals. In the chaos, Ursula&#x27;s shell is destroyed, restoring Ariel&#x27;s voice and breaking the enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel is the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Turning back into her true form, Ursula kidnaps Ariel. Triton confronts Ursula and demands Ariel&#x27;s release, but the deal is inviolable. At Ursula&#x27;s urging, Triton agrees to take Ariel&#x27;s place as Ursula&#x27;s prisoner, giving up his trident. Ariel is released as Triton transforms into a polyp and loses his authority over Atlantica. Ursula declares herself the Queen of the Seven Seas, but before she can use the trident, Eric appears with a harpoon. Ursula attempts to kill Eric, but Ariel intervenes, causing Ursula to inadvertently kill Flotsam and Jetsam. Enraged, Ursula uses the trident to grow in size.

Ariel and Eric reunite on the surface just before a gigantic Ursula separates them. She then gains full control of the ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. Just as Ariel is about to be killed, Eric commandeers a wrecked ship and impales Ursula with its splintered bowsprit. With Ursula dead, Triton and the other polyps in her garden revert to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel truly loves Eric, Triton turns her into a human and approves her marriage to Eric. Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart, with all of Ariel&#x27;s friends and family watching them as well.

==Production==
===Writing===

&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was originally planned as part of one of Walt Disney&#x27;s earliest feature films, a proposed package film featuring vignettes of Hans Christian Andersen tales. Development started soon after &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; in the late 1930s, but was cancelled due to various circumstances.

In 1985, Ron Clements became interested in a film adaptation of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; while he was serving as a director on &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986) alongside John Musker. Clements discovered the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale while browsing through a bookstore. Believing the story provided an &quot;ideal basis&quot; for an animated feature film and keen on creating a film that took place underwater, Clements wrote and presented a two-page treatment of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; at Walt Disney Studios to chief Jeffrey Katzenberg at a &quot;gong show&quot; idea suggestion meeting. Katzenberg passed the project over, because at that time the studio was in development on a sequel to their live-action mermaid comedy &quot;Splash&quot; (1984) and felt &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; would be too similar a project. The next day, however, Katzenberg approved of the idea for possible development, along with &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;. While in production in the 1980s, the staff found, by chance, original story and visual development work done by Kay Nielsen for Disney&#x27;s proposed 1930s Andersen feature. Many of the changes made by the staff in the 1930s to Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s original story were coincidentally the same as the changes made by Disney writers in the 1980s.

That year, Clements and Musker expanded the two-page idea into a 20-page rough script, eliminating the role of the mermaid&#x27;s grandmother and expanding the roles of the Merman King and the sea witch. However, the film&#x27;s plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; as more immediate releases. In 1987, songwriter Howard Ashman became involved with the writing and development of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; after he was asked to contribute a song to &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this. At the same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film. Ashman and composer Alan Menken, both noted for their work as the writers of the successful Off-Broadway stage musical &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, teamed up to compose the entire song score. In 1988, with &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; out of the way, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was slated as the next major Disney release.

===Animation===
More money and resources were dedicated to &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; than any other Disney animated film in decades. Aside from its main animation facility in Glendale, California, Disney opened a satellite feature animation facility during the production of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; in Lake Buena Vista, Florida (near Orlando, Florida), within Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park at Walt Disney World. Opening in 1989, the Disney-MGM facility&#x27;s first projects were to produce an entire Roger Rabbit cartoon short, &quot;Roller Coaster Rabbit&quot;, and to contribute ink and paint support to &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Another first for recent years was the filming of live actors and actresses for motion reference material for the animators, a practice used frequently for many of the Disney animated features produced under Walt Disney&#x27;s supervision. Sherri Lynn Stoner, a former member of Los Angeles&#x27; Groundlings improvisation comedy group, and Joshua Finkel, a Broadway actor, performed key scenes as Ariel and Eric respectively. Jodi Benson had already been cast as Ariel&#x27;s voice actor by this time, and her recorded dialogue was used as playback to guide these live-action references. Before Benson was cast, Melissa Fahn was considered for the part.

&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; supervising animators included Glen Keane and Mark Henn on Ariel, Duncan Marjoribanks on Sebastian, Andreas Deja on King Triton, and Ruben Aquino on Ursula. Originally, Keane had been asked to work on Ursula, as he had established a reputation for drawing large, powerful figures, such as the bear in &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981) and Professor Ratigan in &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986). Keane, however, was assigned as one of the two lead artists on the petite Ariel and oversaw the &quot;Part of Your World&quot; musical number. He jokingly stated that his wife looks exactly like Ariel &quot;without the fins.&quot; The character&#x27;s body type and personality were based upon those of Alyssa Milano, then starring on TV&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; and the effect of her hair underwater was based on both footage of Sally Ride when she was in space, and scenes of Stoner in a pool for guidance in animating Ariel&#x27;s swimming. Many of Stoner&#x27;s mannerisms also became part of Ariel&#x27;s character, such as the way she bit her lip or the way she expressed through hand gestures.

The underwater setting required the most special effects animation for a Disney animated feature since &quot;Fantasia&quot; in 1940. Effects animation supervisor Mark Dindal estimated that over a million bubbles were drawn for this film, in addition to the use of other processes such as airbrushing, backlighting, superimposition, and some computer animation. The artistic manpower needed for &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; required Disney to farm out most of the underwater bubble effects animation in the film to Pacific Rim Productions, a China-based firm with production facilities in Beijing. An attempt to use Disney&#x27;s famed multiplane camera for the first time in years for quality &quot;depth&quot; shots failed because the machine was reputedly in dilapidated condition. The multiplane shots, three in total, were instead photographed at an outside animation camera facility.

&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is the last Walt Disney Animation Studios feature film to use the traditional hand-painted cel method of animation. Disney&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;, used a digital method of coloring and combining scanned drawings developed for Disney by Pixar called CAPS/ink &amp; paint (Computer Animation Production System), which would eliminate the need for cels, the multiplane camera, and many of the optical effects used for the last time in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Clements and Musker&#x27;s next film, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, also used digital coloring via CAPS. A CAPS/ink &amp; paint prototype was used experimentally on a few scenes in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, and one shot produced using CAPS/ink &amp; paint—the penultimate shot in the film, of Ariel and Eric&#x27;s wedding ship sailing away under a rainbow—appears in the finished film. Computer-generated imagery was used to create some of the wrecked ships in the final battle, a staircase behind a shot of Ariel in Eric&#x27;s castle, and the carriage Eric and Ariel are riding in when she bounces it over a ravine. These objects were animated using 3D wireframe models, which were plotted as line art to cels and painted traditionally. The film being both the only film of the Disney Renaissance and the last in the studio&#x27;s history overall to use the xerography technology used since 1961 with &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; made it somewhat of a transitional film between the two Disney eras.

===Casting===
The design of the villainous Ursula was based upon drag performer Divine. An additional early inspiration before Divine was Joan Collins in her role as Alexis Carrington in the television series &quot;Dynasty&quot;, due to a suggestion from Howard Ashman, who was a fan of the series. Pat Carroll was not Clements and Musker&#x27;s first choice to voice Ursula; the original script had been written with Bea Arthur of the Disney-owned TV series &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; in mind. After Arthur turned the part down, actresses such as Nancy Marchand, Nancy Wilson, Roseanne, Charlotte Rae, Jennifer Saunders and Elaine Stritch were considered for the part. Stritch was eventually cast as Ursula, but clashed with Howard Ashman&#x27;s style of music production and was replaced by Carroll. Various actors auditioned for additional roles in the film, including Jim Carrey for the role of Prince Eric, and comedians Bill Maher and Michael Richards for the role of Scuttle.

===Music===

&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was considered by some as &quot;the film that brought Broadway into cartoons&quot;. Alan Menken wrote the Oscar-winning score, and collaborated with Howard Ashman on the songs. One of the film&#x27;s most prominent songs, &quot;Part of Your World&quot;, was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with children, who became rowdy during the scene. This caused Jeffrey Katzenberg to feel that the song needed to be cut, an idea that was resisted by Musker, Clements and Keane. Both Musker and Clements cited the similar situation of the song &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; nearly being cut from 1939&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; when it was appealing to Katzenberg. Keane pushed for the song to remain until the film was in a more finalized state. During a second test screening, the scene, now colorized and further developed, tested well with a separate child audience, and the musical number was kept.

==Release==
The film was originally released on November 17, 1989, followed by a re-release on November 14, 1997. After the success of the 3D re-release of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, Disney announced a 3D re-release of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; scheduled for September 13, 2013, but this was cancelled on January 14, 2013, due to the under-performances of other Disney 3D re-releases until further notice. The 3D version was released on Blu-ray instead, but it did play a limited engagement at the El Capitan Theatre from September to October 2013. On September 20, 2013, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; began playing in select theaters where audiences could bring iPads and use an app called Second Screen Live. AMC Theatres screened the movie from September 6–12, 2019. The film was also screened out of competition at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.

===Home media===
In a then-atypical and controversial move for a new Disney animated film, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was released as part of the Walt Disney Classics line of VHS, LaserDisc, Betamax and Video 8 home media releases on May 18, 1990, six months after the release of the film. Before &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, only a select number of Disney&#x27;s catalog animated films had been released to home media, as the company was afraid of upsetting its profitable practice of theatrically reissuing each film every few years. &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; became that year&#x27;s top-selling title on home video, with over 10 million units sold (including 7 million in its first month) and 13 million units by October 1993. The home video release, along with box office and merchandise sales, contributed to &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; generating a total revenue of . This success led to future Disney animated films being released on home video soon after the end of their theatrical runs, rather than delayed for several years, making &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; the first Disney animated feature to be released on home video 1 year after its theatrical release.

Following &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;″s November 14, 1997 re-release in theaters, a new VHS version was released on March 31, 1998, as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection and included a bonus music video of Jodi Benson singing &quot;Part of Your World&quot; during the end credits, replacing &quot;Under the Sea&quot; as the end credits song. The VHS sold 13 million units and ranked as the third best-selling video of the year.

&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was released in a &quot;bare-bones&quot; Walt Disney Limited Issue DVD on December 7, 1999, with a standard video transfer. The film was re-released on DVD on October 3, 2006, as part of the Walt Disney Platinum Editions of features, alongside the music video for the cover version of &quot;Kiss The Girl&quot; performed by Ashley Tisdale. Deleted scenes and several in-depth documentaries were included, as well as an Academy Award-nominated short film intended for the shelved &quot;Fantasia 2006&quot;, &quot;The Little Matchgirl&quot;. The DVD sold 1.6 million units on its first day of release, and over 4 million units during its first week, making it the biggest animated DVD debut for October. By the year&#x27;s end, the DVD had sold about 7 million units and was one of the year&#x27;s top 10 selling DVDs. The Walt Disney Platinum Edition DVD was released as part of a &quot;&quot;Little Mermaid&quot; Trilogy&quot; boxed set on December 16, 2008. The Walt Disney Platinum Edition of the film, along with its sequels, went on moratorium in January 2009. The film was re-released on a 3-disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo, a 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo and 3D Blu-ray on October 1, 2013, as part of the Walt Disney Diamond Edition line. &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was re-released on HD and 4K digital download on February 12, 2019, with a physical media re-release on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray on February 26, 2019, as part of the &quot;Walt Disney Signature Collection&quot; of the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

===Live presentations===
In June 2016, Disney held special presentations of the film at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, titled &quot;The Little Mermaid in Concert&quot;. The performances combined a screening of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; with live accompaniment by guest musicians and celebrities, including Sara Bareilles (who performed as Ariel), Tituss Burgess (who performed as Sebastian as a reprisal of his role in the stage adaptation), Darren Criss (who performed as Prince Eric), Rebel Wilson (who performed as Ursula), Joshua Colley (who performed as Flounder), John Stamos (who performed as Chef Louis) and Norm Lewis (who performed as King Triton as a reprisal of his role in the stage adaptation). The four additional songs written for the stage adaptation were also incorporated into the presentation, accompanied by scenes of the film&#x27;s original concept art. During the third and final performance, Jodi Benson replaced Bareilles to reprise her original role as Ariel, while Brad Kane (the singing voice of the title character of &quot;Aladdin&quot;) and Susan Egan (who played Belle in the stage adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;) also made special appearances, singing songs from their respective films, and a duet of &quot;A Whole New World&quot;.

From May 17–18, 2019, the Hollywood Bowl hosted another live presentation, titled &quot;The Little Mermaid: An Immersive Live-to Film Concert Experience&quot;. These performances once again combined a screening of the film with live renditions of the film&#x27;s songs, this time starring Lea Michele as Ariel, Harvey Fierstein as Ursula, Cheech Marin as Chef Louis, Ken Page as Sebastian, Peter Gallagher as King Triton, Leo Gallo as Prince Eric, Joshua Turchin as Flounder, and an uncredited actor as Scuttle. This presentation utilized the some songs written for the screen adaptation and some from the stage adaptation, including Joshua Turchin singing &quot;She&#x27;s in Love&quot; from the Broadway adaptation, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Early in the production of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, Jeffrey Katzenberg cautioned Clements, Musker, and their staff, telling them that since &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was a &quot;girl&#x27;s film&quot;, it would make less money at the box office than &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;, which had been Disney&#x27;s biggest animated box office success in a decade. However, by the time the film was closer to completion, Katzenberg was convinced &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; would be a hit and the first animated feature to earn more than $100 million in its initial run and become a &quot;blockbuster&quot; film.

During its original 1989 theatrical release, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; made $6.1 million in its opening weekend, ranking in third place behind &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; and &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot;. In its second weekend, the film remained in third with $8.4 million behind &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; and &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;. Throughout the initinal run, it earned $84.4 million at the North American box office, falling short of Katzenberg&#x27;s expectations but earning 64% more than &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; and becoming the animated film with the highest gross from its initial run. The film was theatrically reissued on November 14, 1997, on the same day as &quot;Anastasia&quot;, a Don Bluth animated feature for Fox Animation Studios. For this release, it ranked in third place behind &quot;The Jackal&quot; and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, collecting $9.8 million during its first weekend. The reissue brought $27.2 million in additional gross. The film also drew in box office earnings outside the United States and Canada between both releases, resulting in a total international box office figure of .

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was released to widespread acclaim, receiving praise from film critics particularly for its music. Review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film has approval score based on reviews and an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads &quot;&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; ushered in a new golden era for Disney animation with warm and charming hand-drawn characters and catchy musical sequences.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; was enthusiastic about the film, writing, &quot;&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is a jolly and inventive animated fantasy—a movie that&#x27;s so creative and so much fun it deserves comparison with the best Disney work of the past.&quot; Ebert also commented positively on the character of Ariel, stating she &quot;is a fully realized female character who thinks and acts independently, even rebelliously, instead of hanging around passively while the fates decide her destiny.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;While the story won&#x27;t win any prizes from the women&#x27;s liberation movement, the animation is so full and colorful and the songs so beguiling that this is a case of where someone made one like they used to. The drawing of the evil octopus witch who is jealous of the mermaid&#x27;s singing voice is particularly outstanding.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film as a &quot;marvel of skillful animation, witty songwriting and smart planning. It is designed to delight filmgoers of every conceivable stripe... Adults will be charmed by the film&#x27;s bright, outstandingly pretty look and by its robust score. Small children will be enchanted by the film&#x27;s sunniness and by its perfect simplicity.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine praised the film for its cast of characters, Ursula in particular, as well as its animation, stating that the animation &quot;proves lush and fluid, augmented by the use of shadow and light as elements like fire, sun and water illuminate the characters.&quot; They also praised the musical collaboration between Howard Ashman and Alan Menken &quot;whose songs frequently begin slowly but build in cleverness and intensity.&quot; During the film&#x27;s 1997 re-release, Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote a mixed review, referring to it as a &quot;likably unspectacular adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen classic.&quot;

The staff of &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote a positive review, praising the film&#x27;s return to the traditional Disney musical as well as the film&#x27;s animation. Yet they also wrote that the film is detracted from by the juvenile humor and the human characters&#x27; eyes. While still giving a positive review, they stated that the film &quot;can&#x27;t compare to the real Disney classics (which appealed equally to both kids and adults).&quot; Todd Gilchrist of IGN wrote a positive review of the film, stating that the film is &quot;an almost perfect achievement&quot;. Gilchrist also praised how the film revived interest in animation as it was released at a time when interest in animation was at a lull. &quot;Empire&quot; gave a positive review of the film, stating that &quot;[&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is] a charmer of a movie, boasting all the ingredients that make a Disney experience something to treasure yet free of all the politically correct, formulaic elements that have bogged down the more recent productions.&quot;

In April 2008 – 19 years after the film&#x27;s initial release in 1989 – Yahoo! users voted &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; as No. 14 on the top 30 animated films of all time. In June, that same year, the film remained on the list but dropped six slots to end at #20. (Only three other traditionally animated Disney animated films - &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King&quot;, respectively - scored above it in the poll even after the update.) In 2011, Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine named it one of &quot;The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film earned three Academy Award nominations, making it the first Disney animated film to earn nominations since &quot;The Rescuers&quot; in 1977.

Bolstered by the film&#x27;s success and the soundtrack&#x27;s award wins, it was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in September 1990 for shipments of two million copies of the soundtrack album, an unheard of feat for an animated film at the time. To date, the soundtrack has been certified six times platinum.

==Legacy==
===Importance===
&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, which was Disney&#x27;s first animated fairy tale since &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959), is an important film in animation history for many reasons. It was instrumental in re-establishing feature-length animation as a profitable venture for the Walt Disney Company, as the company&#x27;s theme parks, television productions, and live-action features had overshadowed the animated output since the 1950s. &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was the second film, following &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;, produced after Disney began expanding its animated output following its successful live action/animated film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, and became Disney&#x27;s first animated major box office and critical hit since &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), 22 years earlier. Walt Disney Feature Animation was further expanded as a result of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and increasingly successful follow-ups – &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994). The staff increased from 300 members in 1988 to 2,200 in 1999 spread across three studios in Burbank, California, Lake Buena Vista, Florida, and Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France.

In addition, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; signaled the re-establishment of the musical film format as a standard for Disney animated films. The majority of Disney&#x27;s most popular animated films from the 1930s on had been musicals, though by the 1970s and 1980s the role of music had been de-emphasized in the films. 1988&#x27;s &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; had served as a test of sorts to the success of the musical format before Disney committed to the Broadway-style structure of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.

In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

===Theme parks===
Ariel is a meet-and-greet character appearing at Disney theme parks around the world, including in specific meet-and-greet locations such as Ariel&#x27;s Grotto. A dark ride based on the film, Ariel&#x27;s Undersea Adventure, opened at both Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort and Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Both attractions tell the story of the film by taking riders through scenes based on the film&#x27;s various musical numbers. Various live entertainment shows based on the film can be found at Disney theme parks worldwide, including Voyage of the Little Mermaid at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios and King Triton&#x27;s Concert at Tokyo DisneySea. The Mermaid Lagoon land at Tokyo DisneySea is also based on the film.

==Other media==
===Television series===
A prequel animated series based on the film premiered in late 1992 on the CBS television network, following Ariel&#x27;s adventures before the events of the film.

===Sequel and prequel===
A direct-to-video sequel, titled &quot;The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea&quot;, was released on September 19, 2000. The plot focuses on Ariel&#x27;s daughter, Melody, who longs to be a part of the ocean world. A direct-to-video prequel, titled &quot;The Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Beginning&quot;, was released in 2008. The story is set before the events of the original film, in which King Triton has banned music from Atlantica.

===&quot;The Little Mermaid Live!&quot;===

&quot;The Wonderful World of Disney: The Little Mermaid Live&quot; was set to air on October 3, 2017, and would have featured a broadcast of the film with a similar format to the Hollywood Bowl concerts. However, on August 3, 2017, it was announced that the special had been dropped due to budget issues. The project was revived to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the film&#x27;s original release, and was aired on November 5, 2019. Auliʻi Cravalho, Queen Latifah and Shaggy starred as Ariel, Ursula and Sebastian, respectively. Other cast members included John Stamos as Chef Louis and Graham Phillips as Prince Eric. The special featured performances of songs from the film and its Broadway adaptations in a themed &quot;dive-in theater&quot; setting at the Disney lot, accompanied by the film itself. It was produced by Done and Dusted, with director-executive producer Hamish Hamilton. In addition to marking the film&#x27;s anniversary, the special was also used as a pre-launch promotional push for the new Disney+ streaming service, which was launched on November 12, 2019.

===Live-action film adaptation===

In May 2016, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Disney was in early development for a live-action adaptation of the film directed by Rob Marshall, with a screenplay by David Magee and Jane Goldman, and a story written by Magee, Marshall and John DeLuca. Alan Menken returns as composer and penned new songs alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also serves as a co-producer alongside Marc Platt, Marshall and DeLuca. Halle Bailey stars as Ariel along with Jonah Hauer-King, Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy, with Daveed Diggs, Jacob Tremblay and Awkwafina in voice roles. Filming wrapped on July 11, 2021. and the film was released on May 26, 2023.

<text>Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport is a regional airport located on the Toronto Islands in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is often referred to as Toronto Island Airport and was previously known as &quot;Port George VI Island Airport&quot; and &quot;Toronto City Centre Airport&quot;. The airport&#x27;s name honours Billy Bishop, the Canadian World War I flying ace and World War II Air Marshal. It is used by civil aviation, air ambulances, and regional airlines using turboprop planes. In 2022, it was ranked Canada&#x27;s ninth-busiest airport. 

Conceived in the 1930s as the main airport for Toronto, the construction of the airport was completed in 1939 by the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC). At the same time, the THC built Malton Airport as an alternate. But nearby Malton (today Toronto Pearson International Airport) became Toronto&#x27;s main passenger airline hub instead, leaving the island airport for general aviation and military purposes. During the 1940s and 1950s, several political leaders proposed an expansion of the island airport to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the annual operating costs. Malton was sold in 1962 to the Government of Canada in exchange for an expansion and improvements to the island airport. After the expansion, civil flights increased to a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s. Although regional airlines were introduced in the 1970s, the annual number of flights went into decline and closure was discussed. In 1983, a 50-year tripartite agreement between the Government of Canada, the City of Toronto government and the Harbour Commission, which limited noise and banned jet use for scheduled airlines, allowed airport operations to continue. In the 1990s, in an era of government cost-cutting, questions about the airport&#x27;s future were raised again due to its annual deficit. At the same time, redevelopment was taking over north of the airport and several studies suggested that the airport was incompatible with development.

In 1999, the new Toronto Port Authority (TPA; renamed in 2015 as &quot;PortsToronto&quot;) replaced the THC. The TPA&#x27;s mandate was to make the port and airport self-sufficient and it determined that the airport needed to expand to end the annual subsidy. Although an expansion of the airport was and is politically controversial, the TPA has worked with new regional airline Porter Airlines since 2003 to increase scheduled carrier flights. Under the new financial model, carriers pay landing fees and departing passengers pay airport improvement fees to the TPA. Porter launched in 2006 and passenger volumes increased to the point that airport operations became self-sufficient by 2010. In 2010, Porter opened a new terminal. In 2015, a pedestrian tunnel to the airport was opened, after a previous plan to build a bridge was cancelled.

In 2013, Porter proposed expanding the airport further and modifying the operating agreement to allow it to use Bombardier CS100 jet planes at the airport. The proposal, estimated to cost  billion in public expenditure, went to PortsToronto for further study. In November 2015, after the 2015 Canadian federal election, the new government announced that it would not re-open the tripartite agreement to allow jets. Ports Toronto subsequently cancelled the expansion proposal studies. The airport is accessed via ferry or the pedestrian tunnel that connects to the mainland.

==Description==
The airport is located on the Toronto Islands, south-west of Downtown Toronto. The airport has one main east–west runway, a shorter runway 20 degrees off, and a seaplane base, Billy Bishop Toronto City Water Aerodrome. The airport is used for regional airline service and for general aviation, including medical evacuation flights (due to its proximity to downtown hospitals), small charter flights, and private aviation. Under its operating agreement, jet aircraft are banned from the airport, with the exception of MEDEVAC flights. There is one passenger terminal at the airport, built in 2010.

The airport is operated as a division of PortsToronto (formerly Toronto Port Authority (TPA)), a federal corporation, which also manages Toronto harbour. The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA officers at the airport can handle aircraft with up to 90 passengers. The airport does not have United States border preclearance, although this has been approved by both Canada and US governments. The airport&#x27;s hours of operation are 6:45 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., except for MEDEVAC flights. The airport&#x27;s hours are governed by the 2003 update of the Tripartite Agreement, which set the hours of operation. Airfield crash fire rescue and EMS are provided by the Billy Bishop Airport Emergency Response Service, backed up by Toronto Fire Services and Toronto EMS.
The airport is accessible from a pedestrian tunnel at the foot of Eireann Quay, which is free to use. From a pavilion on the mainland end, a pedestrian tunnel and a tunnel for sewage and water mains connect to the airport. The pedestrian tunnel has moving sidewalks, with elevators at both ends. On the island side, an escalator serves patrons. A consortium known as Forum Infrastructure Partners, composed of firms Arup, PCL and Technicore, designed, built, financed and maintains the tunnel.

A ferry operates between the same location and the airport every 15 minutes from 5:15 a.m. to midnight (the 5:15 ferry is for airport staff; airline passengers can begin crossing at 5:30). A free shuttle bus service operates between the intersection of York Street and Front Street and the airport. There is a taxi stand at the dock. Short-term and long-term parking is available at the dock and on the island. There is no curb-side parking. The 509 Harbourfront streetcar line, which connects to the subway, serves the intersection of Bathurst Street and Queens Quay, one block north of the ferry dock.

The airport imposes a airport improvement fee surcharge on each passenger boarding scheduled flights.

Since 2015, Billy Bishop has participated in customer surveys with the &quot;Airport Service Quality Survey&quot; of Airports Council International. In March 2017, the airport was named the &quot;Best Airport in North America&quot; in two categories based on 2016 surveys.

In 2019, the airport was ranked 124th in the world, and worst in Canada by AirHelp, which based its rankings on on-time performance, quality of service and food and shops. On-time performance was rated only 5.8/10, while the airport received 8.1/10 for service and 7.0/10 for food and service.

==History==

===1930s–1940s===
The first proposal to build an airport was made in June 1929 by the Toronto Harbour Commission. The Commission proposed a four-stage plan, starting with an &quot;air harbour&quot; for seaplanes, while the final stages proposed filling the then-regatta course lagoon between the sandbar and Hanlan&#x27;s Point. Toronto City Council at that time agreed to the &quot;air harbour&quot; but &quot;in no way—either by implication or suggestion—implies approval of the ultimate development of a combined air harbour and airport.&quot; In August 1935, Council reversed its position and approved the airport project by a vote of 15-7, against the opposition of Toronto mayor Sam McBride (who was serving as a Councillor at the time). City Council received approval from the Government of Canada to spend $976,000 ($ in dollars) on a tunnel under the Western Gap. That fall, after construction began, a federal election was held and William Lyon Mackenzie King was elected as prime minister. King&#x27;s government reversed the previous government&#x27;s decision and cancelled the tunnel.

Trans-Canada Air Lines was expected to begin operations in 1937, so in November 1936, City Council (without McBride, who died days earlier) formed an &quot;Advisory Airport Committee&quot; to advise on where to build a municipal airport. The committee proposed several locations and of these two were approved by the Government of Canada, which agreed to fund one-quarter of the project. The two sites were the Island and Malton, north-west of Toronto. A seaplane and land airport would be built at the island, and an auxiliary field was to be built at Malton. The project would fill in the regatta lagoon and extend the airport site on both the east and west sides. After two days of debate, City Council voted 14-7 to approve the construction of both airports.

The site of the airport had been home to Hanlan&#x27;s Point baseball stadium, numerous cottages, Hanlan&#x27;s Point Amusement Park and the regatta course. The 54 cottages and their cottagers were moved to today&#x27;s &quot;Algonquin Island&quot; (then named &quot;Sunfish Island&quot;). The seaplane base was first used in 1938. The paved runways and the terminal building were opened in 1939. In April 1939, Toronto Council voted to name the airport &quot;Port George VI Island Airport&quot; to commemorate an upcoming visit by King George VI in May 1939. The first commercial passenger flight to the airport was a charter flight carrying Tommy Dorsey and his swing band for a two-day engagement at the Canadian National Exhibition on September 8, 1939. It was also the first airliner from the United States to arrive in Toronto. A 48-person &quot;cable ferry&quot; service was inaugurated to the airport.
During World War II, the island airport became a military training base. From 1940 until 1943, the Royal Norwegian Air Force used the island airport as a training facility. Barracks were built nearby on the mainland at the foot of Bathurst Street. The nearby &#x27;Little Norway Park&#x27; is named in remembrance of the Norwegian community around the airport. For the duration of the war, the airport was used by the Royal Canadian Air Force for training pilots and as a waypoint for transporting planes. After the war, the airport returned to civilian uses. Flying clubs and several aviation companies set up at the airport, offering services such as aircraft rentals, air freight, charter flights, pilot training and sight-seeing flights.

===1950s–1960s===
By the end of 1952, the accumulated cost of running the island airport, and paying the interest on the debt of construction, totalled $752,000 ($ in dollars). Toronto Mayor Allan A. Lamport, one of the original supporters in 1937 of building the island airport, began a renewed effort, along with the Harbour Commission, to expand the airport, hoping to make it profitable. He pushed for a deal to turn over Malton Airport to the Government of Canada in exchange for improvements at the island. The Government of Canada was amenable to the deal and expanding the island airport, and installed an air traffic control system in 1953, but no comprehensive agreement was yet made. An agreement was reached in July 1955, but an impasse arose between the governments over the terms of the agreement. The impasse was settled in 1957. Runway construction began in 1959 and was finished in 1960.

By 1956, takeoffs and landings at the island reached 130,000 per year, many of them private flights to Muskoka and Haliburton. In July 1960, the airport recorded its millionth movement (take-off or landing) since air traffic control was installed in 1953. The Toronto Flying Club&#x27;s move to the island from Malton in 1960 caused a large increase in traffic. For 1961, the airport recorded 212,735 movements, of which 168,272 were for local traffic, including student flights. By number of movements, the airport was the busiest in Canada. The cost of operating at the island airport forced the Club to close and sell its 12 planes after less than a year, however.

The airport improvements, including a new hangar, the new main runway, and night-time landing lights, were completed in 1962. The new lights allowed the first use of the airport for night-time flights since World War II when Norwegian flyers practised night-time flights. Night-time flights began on April 15, 1963, and the airport extended its closing hour from one half-hour before sun-down to midnight. The Government of Canada spent $3,118,500 on the improvements ($ in dollars).

In January 1964, the cable ferry was retired, replaced by the Harbour Commission tugboat &quot;Thomas Langton&quot;. That year, interest by municipal government officials was renewed in a new link to the airport. Takeoffs and landings had declined from the 1961 peak to 189,000 in 1962 and 187,000 in 1963, despite the addition of night-time capability. The decline was attributed to two factors: the limited access and poor service the ferry provided and the opening of the Buttonville Municipal Airport north of Toronto in 1962. The City of Toronto, spurred by Lamport, wanted the Government of Canada to provide a better ferry or a lift bridge. The Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) planning department studied a proposal to build a bridge, although full automobile access was opposed by the Metro Commissioner of Parks, Tommy Thompson, whose department was converting the islands to parkland. The &quot;Maple City&quot;, capable of carrying vehicles and passengers, took over the ferry service in March 1965.

In 1967, the Harbour Commission initiated a study into converting the airport into one suitable for the passenger jets of the day, such as DC-8s. The island airport runways were too short for jets, so a new airport would have to be built on new land reclaimed from Lake Ontario. The commission developed this further into a full redevelopment of the islands, whereby a residential development, entitled &quot;Harbor City&quot;, would be built on the existing island airport lands, and a new airport with a runway long enough for jets would be built on a peninsula parallel to the south shore of the Toronto Islands. This plan also outlined the development of a new harbour, the Outer Harbour east of the Eastern Gap. The plan was later modified to situate the new island airport on the Outer Harbour headland, east of the islands, with road access available from the Gardiner Expressway south along Leslie Street. The Government of Canada ruled out the waterfront site for a major airport early in 1970, although Transport Minister Donald Jamieson suggested there would be some sort of expanded airport serving &quot;short-hop, inter-city&quot; flights created.

===1970s–1980s===
By 1970, the annual operating deficit (the cost of operating the airport minus revenues collected) of the airport had reached $200,000 ($ in dollars). Toronto mayor William Dennison warned that the airport could be closed as the Harbour Commission did not want to absorb the amount. At the time, the island airport site was to become the site of the &quot;Harbor City&quot; residential development, although a replacement for the island airport had not been agreed upon. A 1969 proposal to build a new airport by the new headland was met with opposition from local residents and Toronto City Councillors and was dropped. With plans uncertain, the Government of Canada requested that the Harbour Commission continue to operate the airport as is in the interim.

In 1972, the &quot;Harbor City&quot; project died when the governments of Canada and Ontario proposed to build a new major airport in Pickering, Ontario. At the same time, the Government of Canada initiated a feasibility study of converting the island airport to a major airport for Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) planes. Later that year, the Harbour Commission announced plans for an aquatic park on the Outer Harbour headland, the location in the 1968 plan for the relocated island airport.

In 1973, de Havilland Aircraft of Canada, makers of the new DHC-7 (Dash 7) STOL plane, proposed a network of STOL airports around Ontario, with the Island Airport as its hub, to the Government of Ontario cabinet ministers and the Government of Canada cabinet ministers. The first versions of the Dash 7 could support flights from the island to smaller centres, such as Sarnia, Kingston, Peterborough and Owen Sound, with a larger version able to support flights to larger centres such as London, North Bay, Ottawa and Windsor. The island airport, which operated under visual flight rules, would have to be upgraded to instrument flight rules to operate the service. De Havilland also proposed a bridge to the island airport over the Western Gap. The Government of Ontario was interested in the proposal, and asked the Canadian government to work towards development of STOL. Ontario Intergovernmental Affairs Minister John White characterized &quot;regional air service in southern Ontario as totally deficient.&quot;

By 1974, the annual operating deficit of running the airport had reached $300,000 per year ($ in dollars), $130,000 of it in operating the &quot;Maple City&quot; ferry. The City of Toronto decided to ask the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada to cover the deficit. After study by the Toronto, Metro, Ontario and Canadian governments, the Government of Canada agreed to grant an annual subsidy to the Harbour Commission to operate the airport, while the Government of Ontario agreed to pay for the costs of the airport ferry. The Government of Canada put a condition on the subsidy, that intergovernmental agreement needed to be reached on the future of the airport. Agreement on the future of the airport would take several years.

In January 1975, Otonabee Airways launched the first scheduled passenger service at the airport. Otonabee operated a three-times a day service between the island airport and Montreal&#x27;s international airport. 1975 was also the year that the island airport was used as the base for &quot;Olga&quot;, a Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane helicopter used to dismantle the crane of the new CN Tower under construction and hoist sections of its new antenna into place on top of its concrete tower.

In April 1978, Transport Minister Otto Lang announced a plan to provide daily scheduled airline service between the airport, Ottawa and Montreal, using de Havilland Dash 7 STOL planes. The Government of Canada would invest $5 million in improvements at the airport including a covered moving pedestrian sidewalk linking the airport with Lake Shore Boulevard. The plan was rejected by Toronto City Council, and the Canadian Transport Commission turned down the plan stating that the airport&#x27;s services were not satisfactory and required upgrading.

Art Eggleton was elected Toronto mayor and a compromise was reached in 1981, when the City of Toronto agreed to a limited level of commercial STOL passenger service, and the exclusion of jet airplanes. A memorandum of understanding was signed by the THC, the City and Transport Canada, and in 1982, the Canadian Transport Commission issued a licence to City Centre Airways to operate Dash 7 planes between the island, Ottawa and Montreal. In 1983, the City of Toronto, the THC, and the Government of Canada signed a tripartite agreement over operation of the airport. The agreement, in force until 2033, leases the land for the airport at a rate of $1 per year. The majority of the airport land is owned by the Government of Ontario with two small sections owned by the Government of Canada and a small section owned by Toronto. The agreement made provisions for a restricted list of aircraft allowed to use the airport due to noise levels, prohibitions on jet traffic except for MEDEVAC flights and prohibition against the construction of a fixed link between Toronto Island and the mainland. According to the Tassé report: &quot;The Tripartite Agreement does not directly set a maximum number of flights or passengers at the Island Airport; it does, however, establish noise exposure parameters that are not to be exceeded (NEF 25), thus effectively providing restrictions on the number of flights.&quot; The number and type of flights are to stay within the Noise Exposure Forecast (NEF) 25 exposure level to neighbours. The agreement was amended in 1985 to specifically allow the new de Havilland Dash 8, small 37–39 seat planes at the time, which are not considered STOL planes.

In 1984, Air Atonabee, (as Otonabee Airways had been renamed in 1980) was re-organized into a new regional airline known as City Express. From 1984 until 1991, City Express continued and expanded its operations at the airport, peaking at 400,000 passengers annually in the mid-1980s.

===1990s–2010s===

In 1990, Air Ontario (later to become Air Canada Jazz) started operating regional airline service to Ottawa and Montreal. That year, City Express folded in bankruptcy. In 1994, Jazz built a new terminal, moving out of trailers. That year, the airport was renamed the Toronto City Centre Airport.

The Toronto Harbour Commission made plans to expand the airport so as to achieve self-sufficiency, as it was dependent on subsidies from the City of Toronto and had transferred much of its land to the City in exchange for an ongoing subsidy. In 1992, the THC proposed to build a bridge to the airport for safety reasons and as an improvement, at a cost of . THC&#x27;s plans were initially opposed by Toronto City Council, but after the THC threatened to close the airport, an agreement was reached. Council agreed to a bridge on condition of continuing the &#x27;no jets&#x27; ban, and that it not be built with Toronto tax dollars. After the City of Toronto was amalgamated, the plan was re-opened and a tunnel proposed instead, but the new Toronto City Council approved a bridge in 1998.

In 1999, the THC was renamed the Toronto Port Authority (TPA). The Authority was expected to manage the port more like a business. A review of the airport operations concluded that the airport &quot;is not sustainable and will likely lead to continued financial losses.&quot; Passenger volumes had declined to 140,000 annually from a peak of 400,000 in 1987. The consultants concluded that if services were upgraded to include small jets, that possibly 900,000 passengers could be carried annually by 2020. The report proposed a bridge and in runway upgrades. A bridge was started but cancelled by Toronto City Council in 2003. By 2005, the airport recorded only 68,000 flights annually, down from a historic high of 800,000 in 1987. The only carrier operating at the airport was Air Canada affiliate Air Canada Jazz, operating flights between Toronto and Ottawa.

In 2006, Jazz was forced out of the airport by REGCO, the terminal owners, which announced a new &quot;Porter Airlines&quot; regional airline. Porter began regional airline service with flights to Ottawa in the fall of 2006 using Q400 series Dash 8 planes, 70-seat aircraft. Its entry into service was met by protesters who attempted to block passengers from the airport. Airport traffic increased to over 93,000 takeoffs and landings in 2008. To support Porter, the TPA launched the larger &quot;David Hornell&quot; ferry in 2006. The &quot;Maple City&quot; ferry became the back-up.

In January 2009, it was announced that the TPA would purchase a second, larger ferry to support Porter&#x27;s activities. The ferry was financed out of the &quot;airport improvement fee&quot; charged to passengers. The ferry had been proposed by Porter CEO Robert Deluce to the TPA&#x27;s Board of Directors over the period of March–June 2008. The decision to approve the ferry precipitated a conflict-of-interest investigation of TPA director Colin Watson, who is a self-described friend of Deluce&#x27;s, and who voted in a 5–4 decision to approve the ferry. Watson was cleared of the charge by the federal Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson in June 2009. The new ferry, named &quot;Marilyn Bell I&quot; (the name was chosen after a public naming contest), went into service on January 22, 2010.

At its annual meeting on September 3, 2009, the TPA announced that it would rename the airport after William Avery &quot;Billy&quot; Bishop, a Canadian First World War flying ace. The proposal drew criticism from TPA critics such as Adam Vaughan, charging &quot;the port authority is putting together a &quot;feel-good story&quot; to prevent people from asking tough questions about how the island airport is governed.&quot; On November 10, 2009, after approval from Transport Canada, the TPA officially renamed the airport to &quot;Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport&quot;. It is the second airport in Canada, after Owen Sound Billy Bishop Regional Airport, to be named for Bishop. The airport continued to be listed in aeronautical publications and weather reports as Toronto City Centre Airport, until February 11, 2010.

In the September 17, 2009, &quot;La Presse&quot; newspaper, Air Canada president and CEO Calin Rovinescu was quoted as saying that the term of exclusivity for Porter at the airport ends in 2010 and that Air Canada is considering a return to the airport in 2010, if acceptable terms can be arranged. Later in September, Jazz chief executive officer Joseph Randell reiterated the comments stating that it intended to restore service as early as April 2010.

Passenger traffic increased 46% from 2009 to 2010. In January 2010, the TPA announced that it would spend on upgrades to the airport. The upgrades included a new Equipment Maintenance Building, apron paving, equipment upgrades and a noise barrier to deflect plane maintenance noise out over the lake. The expense would be recouped from the Airport Improvement Fee charged to passengers. In February 2010, Air Canada filed suit against the TPA to get access to the airport, access it had lost when Porter had evicted Jazz in 2006. On March 29, 2010, the Federal Court ruled that Air Canada would have a hearing in July 2010 of its objections to the TPA process. On March 7, 2010, the first half of the Porter&#x27;s new terminal opened. The new terminal, estimated to cost , was completed in early 2011. The opening of the new terminal was met by new protests by Community Air activists protesting the proposed increase in flights.

In 2011, Air Canada Express (operated by Sky Regional) began flying again out of the island airport. In July 2011, an agreement was reached between the City and the Port Authority to enable construction of a pedestrian tunnel connecting the airport. Included in the agreement was the provision that the original 1939 airport terminal building could be relocated for future use. Dismantling of the building started in November 2011. By April 2012 the terminal building had been moved from its original location and was temporarily residing on the grass to the south of runway 24. In 2014, the TPA announced that it would move the terminal closer to Hanlan&#x27;s Point and turn the facility into a restaurant for the general aviation community at the airport.

In January 2015, Porter Airlines Holdings and City Centre Terminal sold the passenger terminal to a consortium known as Nieuport Aviation Infrastructure that includes InstarAGF Asset Management, an alternative-investment manager, Kilmer Van Nostrand Co, an investment firm controlled by Larry Tanenbaum, the chairman of Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment, Partners Group, a Swiss private equity firm, and institutional clients advised by J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The buyers did not disclose a price; Bloomberg, however, reported a possible sale price of more than . Public records indicated that Scotiabank held a mortgage of .

In June 2016, a three-year project to update the runways at the airport began and was completed in October 2018. The project repaved runways 06/24 and 08/26 and upgraded the electrical and lighting systems. The airport has now decommissioned runway 15/33, due to its lack of use and operational restrictions. It will be converted into a taxiway. In October 2016, PortsToronto approved a expansion of the terminal, including a new gate, and room for US Customs preclearance if it is approved in the future.

====Cancelled expansion plans====
In April 2013, Porter announced a conditional purchase of 12 Bombardier CS100 passenger jets, with an option to purchase 18 more. Porter president Robert Deluce announced that the airline would seek an extension of the main runway by , at either end, to accommodate the longer landing and takeoff requirements of the aircraft. The airline would also seek an exemption for the CS100 aircraft from the jet ban at the airport imposed in the 1983 Tripartite Agreement of the airport. The changes would require the agreement of the Government of Canada, the Toronto Port Authority and the City of Toronto. The TPA announced that it would await the direction of Toronto City Council on the potential expansion. A new community group &quot;NoJetsTO&quot; was formed to collect opposition to the plan to allow jets at the airport. The City of Toronto started consultations in September 2013, both online and at &quot;town hall&quot; sessions, to produce a report from staff for presentation to Council. As consultations began, Porter increased its request to extensions at each end of the runway. The Toronto Port Authority notified the City of Toronto that it was seeking an extension to the tripartite agreement beyond 2033 as a condition of the runway extension plan.

The staff report was released to the public on November 28, 2013 and staff recommended putting off consideration of the plan until 2015, due to incomplete information and the various unresolved issues, including the CS100 noise information, Transport Canada regulations, and Toronto Port Authority requirements. The report also noted that the airport does not have a &quot;Master Plan&quot; unlike other airports, and staff suggested is essential for consideration to extend the tripartite agreement. The plan is to be discussed by the City Council executive committee and full Council in December 2013. The board of Waterfront Toronto endorsed the report, stating &quot;serious transportation, road congestion, and community impact issues created by the airport&#x27;s current operations&quot; be addressed before any new plans are considered. Executive committee of Council agreed to defer its consideration of the proposal until January 2014.

In January 2014, the Toronto Port Authority announced that it would seek from the Government of Canada to expand infrastructure around the airport if the expansion plans and jets are approved for use at the airport.

In April 2014, Toronto City Council voted to defer approval of the plan, voting 44–0 to defer and wait for the Port Authority to produce plans for the airport. The Council refused to support spending any City money on the proposal. Council ordered the Port Authority to produce an environmental assessment (EA), preliminary runway design and updated airport master plan, as well as produce a figure for a proposed passenger cap on the facility. Council informed the TPA that it sought a maximum figure of 2.4 million, regardless of whether jets are implemented, while the TPA suggested an interim cap of 2.976 million, and deferred agreeing to a permanent cap figure. The TPA issued Requests For Proposals to private firms to conduct the EA and preliminary runway designs.

In April 2015, Air Canada, also a user of the airport, stated that it was opposed to the introduction of jets at the airport. &quot;Air Canada&#x27;s position on this matter is crystal clear. We do not support jets at Billy Bishop,&quot; said Derek Vanstone of the airline. Air Canada commissioned a study that concluded that the expansion would cost in public expenditure.

In March 2015, PortsToronto released preliminary information on the impact of jets as part of a Master Planning Exercise. The study envisioned that the runways would be extended by at either end (to a total length of ). The number of daily slots would increase to 242 from 202; the number of passengers would increase from two million to four million annually; aircraft movements would increase from 114,000 to 138,000; the marine exclusion zone around the runways would expand in width by to ; and the peak number of passengers at one time would grow from 944 to 1,761. The proposal would also include a jet blast barrier and a potential noise barrier. PortsToronto released the terms of reference for its environmental study in August 2015.

Under the tripartite management agreement, all three signatories must agree to re-open it; without one, the proposal cannot proceed. In November 2015, after the federal election that saw the Liberal Party of Canada return to power, the new transport minister Marc Garneau announced that the government would not re-open the tripartite agreement to allow the expansion. Porter Airlines and Ports Toronto had hoped that the government would not follow through on its promise and asked for the Government of Canada to wait until studies were complete. Pratt &amp; Whitney stated that the CS100 would have been quieter compared to the existing turboprop aircraft currently used at the airport. On December 8, Ports Toronto announced it would not complete the expansion proposal reports for Council, ending work after any current technical studies were complete.

====Construction of a pedestrian tunnel connection to the mainland====

In 2015, a pedestrian tunnel to the airport was opened, after a previous plan to build a bridge was cancelled.

A tunnel was first proposed to connect to the island airport in 1935. A tunnel was started, but cancelled and filled in. Since 1938, a car ferry has provided service to and from the airport.

In 1997, Toronto City Council approved a bridge to connect to the island airport. In 2003, Council cancelled the bridge after Toronto Mayor David Miller was elected on a platform to cancel the bridge. The Port Authority bought two new car ferries instead.

In 2009, the Toronto Port Authority (TPA), operator of the airport, first proposed to build a pedestrian tunnel connecting the airport with the mainland, at a cost of $38 million. The TPA proposed that the project be paid for primarily through federal and provincial economic stimulus funds. Critics such as federal MP Olivia Chow and Toronto City Councillor Adam Vaughan criticized the proposal as benefiting only a small number of privileged users, as well as being a subsidy to Porter Airlines&#x27; business. The project was not included on a City-approved list of projects submitted to the Government of Canada. In October 2009, the TPA, having not yet received approval for the tunnel project, announced that it was now too late to proceed if the project was to meet the March 2011 completion date condition for receiving federal infrastructure stimulus funds and withdrew the project.

In January 2010, the TPA announced that it was seeking a private-sector partner to build a pedestrian tunnel. The cost was now estimated at $45 million. This was to be financed through a $5/flight increase in the Airport Fee paid by passengers. On July 12, 2010, the TPA announced that it intended to begin construction of the tunnel as early as 2011, after conduction an environmental assessment. The tunnel would not be built on or over City of Toronto land, meaning City approval would not be required. The TPA also announced that an opinion poll conducted on behalf of the TPA suggested that &quot;a majority (56%) of Torontonians support a pedestrian tunnel to the island airport.&quot;

The TPA conducted a private environmental assessment of the project and decided to proceed in April 2011. The TPA then short-listed three companies to respond to a request for proposals to build the tunnel. The RFP ended in October 2011. In July 2011, an agreement was reached with the City of Toronto, exchanging lands with the Port Authority, enabling the Port Authority to proceed on the pedestrian tunnel. The agreement allows the Port Authority to expand their taxi and parking space for the airport. In exchange, the City of Toronto had a water main to serve the Islands included as part of the project. In January 2012, the TPA announced that ground-breaking would take place in February 2012, with construction to take approximately two years.

Ground-breaking began in March 2012. Initially, the tunnel was estimated at $38 million, but this was revised to a cost of $82.5 million. It was expected to take 25 months to complete but eventually took 40 to complete. Tunnelling contractor Technicore Underground, Inc. had to deal with left over metal pilings from the 1930s tunnel project and contaminated soil. The pilings themselves were not a surprise, their details being in the TPA archives, but the pilings had fractured much of the rock in the tunnel area, meaning that the strength of the rock around the tunnel area was weaker and needed extra shoring up. There was also a dispute over payments and Technicore filed a $10 million lien against the project alleging unpaid work. To deal with the delays, the contractor applied for an exemption from the city&#x27;s noise bylaw to work around the clock. Its application for round-the-clock work was denied, but it was allowed to work longer hours until 11 p.m. The Toronto Port Authority announced that the project would be complete during the winter of 2014/2015 and blamed the delay on the winter of 2013/2014 being colder than in previous years and ice build-up slowed progress. The agency announced a further delay to the late spring of 2015. The project finally opened on July 30, 2015.

===2020s: minor improvements and runway extensions===
In June 2023, the Government of Canada announced that it will be spending up to to build US border preclearance facility at the airport. It is expected to open by 2025 and will enable flights from the island airport to at least ten new US destinations. In June 2023, Air Canada opened a joint venture lounge under the Air Canada Cafe brand with Aspire, owned by Swissport, in the domestic zone of the terminal. This marked the first lounge at the airport.

In 2024, Ports Toronto presented a plan to conform to new safety requirements of Transport Canada to extend runways for run-off safety. The agency presented three proposals to conform, and add roadways and taxiways. In conjunction with this, the agency asked for an extension of the tripartite agreement of 40 years, which it argued was necessary to finance the runway extension. This was turned down by Toronto City Council which approved a minimum runway extension and a twelve-year extension to the tripartite agreement.

==Airlines and destinations==

==Disputes==
===City of Toronto taxes===
Canadian federal agencies such as the TPA make a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) for property they own that is not leased to third parties. Such entities pay property taxes on property leased to third parties. By 2009, the City estimated that the TPA owed $37 million in unpaid PILT for all its properties. The PILT was based on the assessed value as calculated by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation, which assesses all property for the province of Ontario. The City and the TPA presented their case before a federal dispute advisory panel. On January 26, 2009, the Dispute Advisory Panel recommended that TPA pay PILT for the airport on a per passenger basis of 80 cents per passenger. This amount was based on various considerations including similar payments made by other airports, which make the payments based on passenger numbers. At the time of the ruling, Pearson International Airport paid 94 cents per passenger. On February 10, 2009, the City applied for a judicial review to the Federal Court of Canada.

The Federal Court struck down the January 2009 DAP report, recommending a hearing before a new DAP, with TPA maintaining the right to appeal the court&#x27;s decision. In an attempt to settle outstanding legal issues between the parties, the TPA and the City entered into a settlement agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, TPA and the City agreed, among other things, to meet and work together to review and resolve issues regarding PILTs. Under the agreement, the City agreed to pay $11.4 million owing on payments related to previous land transfers and $380,559 owing on harbour user fees. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement the TPA agreed to pay the City $6.4 million on account for PILTs for tax years 1999–2008 on a without prejudice basis, with the parties maintaining their rights to request a new DAP or apply for judicial review. The agreement, which was ratified by Toronto City Council, was made in conjunction with the transfer of of land at Leslie Street and Lake Shore Boulevard for a proposed Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) light rail storage facility. As of February 28, 2013, the TPA had paid PILT of $11.66 million for the years 1999 to 2012, inclusive, which was a rate of 80 cents per passenger.

In April 2013, Toronto Council voted against adopting a tax agreement with the airport, under which the TPA would have paid PILTs for the airport on a per passenger basis at a rate of 94 cents per passenger, the same rate paid by Pearson Airport. In January 2014, the two sides agreed to the rate of 94 cents per passenger, settling the dispute over the airport. The settlement left other TPA properties on Cherry Street and the Outer Harbour Marina still in dispute. All outstanding PILT payments were settled in 2015 and a new payment structure was put in place for payments moving forward.

===Bridge proposal===
Since 1935, there have been repeated plans to construct either tunnels or a bridge to the airport. The airport continued to require public subsidies and various expansion plans, including jets and airport enlargement were seen as a way to increase its usage and make the airport self-sufficient. Meanwhile, during this time, the downtown area surrounding the airport was redeveloped. Whereas it was once port lands and industrial buildings, the area changed with the coming of Harbourfront Centre, which sparked condominium tower development along the waterfront near the airport and increasing the number of residents in the area.

Opposition to the airport was formalized into the Community AIR (Airport Impact Review) volunteer association in 2001, headed by activist and former councillor Allan Sparrow. It was formed by local residents to oppose expansion on the grounds of increased air and noise pollution, safety concerns and that the increase in air traffic will hamper recent government initiatives to rejuvenate the Toronto waterfront. In July 2001, at a news conference held with representatives of the Sierra Club, the David Suzuki Foundation and the Toronto Environmental Alliance, the group proposed converting the airport to parkland. Community AIR was and is supported by the City councillors of the area.

It emerged during 2002, that Robert Deluce, former executive with Canada 3000, proposed to fly regional turboprop planes from the island airport. Deluce&#x27;s proposal was initially conditional on the construction of a fixed link to the airport. In 2002, the TPA made plans to link the island to the mainland by a new bridge to serve expanded services.

At the same time, the TPA was pursuing a $1 billion lawsuit against the City of Toronto over some of port-lands it claimed were transferred improperly to the Toronto Economic Development Corporation by the TPA&#x27;s predecessor, the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC), in the early 1990s during the mayorship of June Rowlands The port-lands had been transferred under the direction of THC directors appointed by the City in exchange for a permanent subsidy of the THC under agreements made in 1991 and 1994. The lands had been earmarked for waterfront revitalization by the City after the Crombie Commission. The lawsuit would emerge as a factor in the TPA&#x27;s plans for expansion of the airport, and City Council support for the TPA&#x27;s plans for a new bridge became conditional upon the lawsuit being dropped.

The proposal to link the airport with a bridge had been previously approved by Toronto City Council in 1995 and 1998, with the proviso that a business plan would be presented for approval by the THC and later the TPA for operating the airport. In November 2002, City Council met to debate the competing proposals, that of closing the airport in favour of some parkland, or of approving the TPA&#x27;s plans and having uncontested title to the port lands. Despite pleas from former mayor David Crombie, urban planner/activist Jane Jacobs and Harbourfront residents, the TPA plan was supported by then-mayor Mel Lastman, who argued that the estimated $190 million of annual economic benefit the airport would create, was too good to pass up. On November 28, 2002, Council in a day-long debate, made two votes to settle the issue. First, Council voted 32–9 to accept a settlement to end the TPA port-lands lawsuit in exchange for an immediate payment of $5.5 million and an annual subsidy of $5.5 million to the TPA until 2012. Council then voted 29–11 to approve the amendment of the tripartite agreement to permit a fixed link and the construction of a lift bridge and the City, the Federal Government and the TPA signed and delivered such amending agreement dated June 26, 2003.

The next year, a municipal election year, saw public opinion change to oppose the bridge. In October 2003, a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; poll listed 53% of residents citywide opposed the airport bridge, while 36% supported it. Bridge supporter Mel Lastman was retiring. Councillor David Miller ran for Mayor on a platform to stop the building of the bridge, a position supported by Community AIR and other local community groups. Other mayoral candidates Barbara Hall and John Tory supported the bridge. Although the bridge was an election issue, and the bridge project still required two federal approvals, the TPA continued developing the project, progressing to the point that contracts were signed with major participants (including companies operating from the airport).

In November 2003, Mr. Miller was elected Mayor of Toronto with 44% of the vote. While construction workers prepared the construction site, Miller immediately started the process to cancel the bridge project, sparking threats of another lawsuit from the TPA. The incoming City Council voted 26–18 in December 2003 to withdraw its support of the bridge project and federal Transport Minister David Collenette announced that the Government of Canada would accept the Council&#x27;s position on the bridge and withdraw its support.

In January 2004, the Government of Canada would put approval of the project on hold, preventing its construction. Immediately, Deluce would file a $505 million lawsuit against the City of Toronto, claiming that Miller &quot;abused his powers&quot;, by threatening councillors, had Toronto Fire Services and Toronto Hydro &quot;interfere with the construction of a fixed link&quot; and lobbying the Government of Canada to &quot;withhold certain permits.&quot; The Government of Canada later transferred $35 million to the TPA in May 2005 to settle claims arising from the cancellation from Deluce, Aecon Construction and Stolport Corp. Compensation terms were not disclosed. TPA CEO (Lisa Raitt) commented &quot;You will never hear about the bridge again.&quot; and &quot;We have been working very hard since December of 2003 to deal with the request of the City of Toronto not to build a bridge, and we are very happy that the matter has been dealt with.&quot; New federal regulations were introduced to ban any future plans to build a fixed link to the airport.

===Late-night landings===
At the 2009 TPA annual meeting, concerns were raised about landings at the airport after the 23:00 closing time. Local residents had two concerns: the late-night noise and safety. Control tower staff are not present at Bishop after 23:00 (a practice that is very common at most smaller Canadian airports). In one specific incident in September 2008, a late Porter flight was advised by air traffic controllers to divert to Pearson, but instead landed at Bishop. For the landing, Porter was fined an undisclosed amount by the TPA. Under the airport&#x27;s curfew agreement, each commercial landing outside the airport&#x27;s curfew may be subject to a fine of $10,000.

===Increase in number of flights===
On October 19, 2009, the TPA published a press release indicating that other carriers were interested in using the airport and that it was accepting expressions of interest. The TPA noted that any increase in commercial traffic would be within the 1983 tripartite agreement governing usage and noise limits. In December 2009, the TPA announced that it would allow between 42 and 92 daily landings and takeoffs at the airport, beyond the current 120 per day &#x27;slots&#x27; allotted. The slots would be allocated by an International Air Transport Association (IATA)-accredited slot coordinator. These slots would become available after Porter&#x27;s new terminal building was complete.

In 2009, the Toronto Medical Officer of Health started studying the effects of the pollution from Toronto&#x27;s airports. The TPA initiated a study by the Jacobs Consultancy to examine the air pollution from the airport, as part of an environmental review of the airport&#x27;s activities. In January 2010, the Toronto Board of Health started holding hearings into the health effects of the island airport, including the proposed increased traffic.

In March 2010, the opening of Porter&#x27;s new terminal was met by new protests by Community Air activists protesting the increase in flights. The number of slots is contested by Community Air, which asserts that this contravenes maximums previously calculated:

* 97 by Transport Canada, in May 1998,
* 122 by the Sypher Mueller report to the TPA in 2001,
* 120 by the City of Toronto and the Tassé report, and
* 167 per airport consultant Pryde Schropp McComb in a 2005 study for Porter Airlines.
In April 2010, the TPA confirmed the final results from the capacity assessment study for the BBTCA conducted by a third-party consultant, Jacobs Consultancy. The study considered that existing BBTCA commercial carrier operations would utilize approximately 112 slots in the period leading up to the pending allocation of additional slots, and recommended that the maximum number of commercial slots available at the BBTCA be increased by 90, to 202, upon the completion of the new terminal.

Air Canada pursued a judicial review of TPA&#x27;s plans to open the airport to other airlines. The action was heard in Federal Court in July 2010, and the Court dismissed Air Canada&#x27;s claims against the TPA&#x27;s decisions of December 2009 and April 2010 with respect to the airport slot allocations. Continental Airlines had also been reported as having interest in setting up Canada-U.S. flights from the airport. In June 2010, the TPA announced that Air Canada and Continental Airlines had submitted responses that met the initial requirements outlined in the TPA&#x27;s formal RFP for additional commercial airline services at the Airport, and invited each to conclude a Commercial Carrier Operating Agreement with TPA, consistent with Porter&#x27;s. The Airport&#x27;s independent, IATA-accredited slot coordinator, Airport Coordination Limited had evaluated the RFP responses from Air Canada and Continental with regard to BBTCA slot requests, and recommended an allocation of 30 new slots to Air Canada and 16 new slots to Continental, subject to their entering into of a Commercial Carrier Operating Agreement with the TPA. The remaining 45 new slots were allocated to Porter in accordance with its Commercial Carrier Operating Agreement.

In March 2011, Air Canada and the TPA concluded a Commercial Carrier Operating Agreement with Air Canada. Air Canada Express began flying out of the airport on May 1, 2011. United Continental Holdings (the merged Continental Airlines and United Airlines), however, decided not to fly out of the airport. The 16 slots previously held by United Continental Holdings were awarded to Porter in September 2011.

==Accidents and incidents==
On June 20, 1941, two Norwegian pilots training at the Island Airport were killed. Their Northrop N-3PB seaplane was taking off from the harbour waters, when a ferry boat, travelling from the mainland to the Toronto Island, the &quot;Sam McBride&quot;, crossed their path. The plane crashed into the upper level of the ferry, then sank into Toronto Harbour (the &quot;Sam McBride&quot; was damaged, but remained afloat).

On February 22, 1943, a Norwegian flight instructor was killed when his Curtiss P-36 Hawk plane did not pull out of a dive and crashed at the airport. Witnesses did not see the plane make any moves to pull out of the dive. 2nd Lieutenant Conrad Mohr radioed the base that he would do a power dive. It was his last planned flight before leaving for England to rejoin his family, which had recently escaped Norway.

On August 23, 1952, a bi-plane piloted by Charles McKay and John Pretner took off from the island airport and crashed in the backyard of a home on Markham Street, near Dundas Street West in Toronto. Both men were killed in the crash and ensuing fire. The plane was used by owner Charles Catalano&#x27;s Aerial Advertising Service to pull signs behind it over the annual Canadian National Exhibition (CNE). It was not pulling a sign at the time of the crash. McKay was a pilot for Catalano and Pretner was his guest aboard the plane. According to Catalano, the plane had passed an airworthiness test two weeks previous. According to witnesses, the pilot appeared to lose control of the plane when it went down. According to Donald Saunders, the Ontario District Air Regulations supervisor at the time, it was the first plane crash within Toronto since the island airport opened in 1938.

On September 12, 1953, a blimp parked at the airport was destroyed by a violent wind storm. The blimp, which had been advertising the Loblaws grocery chain, while flying over the CNE, was toppled from its mooring mast and then cut to shreds. Its pilot, Robert Brown of Lakehurst, New Jersey, suffered back and head injuries while attempting to adjust its position. A crew attempting to deflate the blimp at the time was not injured.

In October 1954, Hurricane Hazel destroyed planes parked at the airport, including one of Charles Catalano&#x27;s Tiger Moth aerial advertising planes. The airport ferry had to be disconnected from its dock and floated in the middle of the channel to avoid its destruction, taking the ferry out of service.

On June 8, 1961, Henry Sharpe, a Peterborough, Ontario farmer, was killed when his plane crashed into Lake Ontario between four and eight miles east of the Island Airport. Sharpe had taken off from Peterborough at about 7:00 am that day, and encountered an electrical storm on his flight to Toronto for a milk producers&#x27; meeting.

On December 7, 1964, a Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft crashed 1,500 ft from the Island Airport runway. The pilot, Bruce MacRitchie of Toronto was saved when Toronto Harbour Police reached the aircraft about 30 seconds after the impact. The plane was returning to the Island from the Oshawa airport, when its engine failed and the plane impacted with the water.

On September 2, 1966, United States Navy Blue Angels pilot Lt. Cmdr. Dick Oliver was killed when he crashed his F-11 Tiger into a breakwater at the Island Airport, while performing in the Canadian International Air Show. The airplane was travelling west-to-east across the waterfront, lost altitude and crashed. Debris injured two bystanders at the Island airport.

On July 23, 1976, a Cessna 401 crashed and sank into Lake Ontario, one half-mile west of the airport. The pilot and two passengers, on a flight from Chicago&#x27;s Midway International Airport, perished in the crash. Donald Frankel of Chicago was the president and founder of the Flying Physicians Association, Inc. and was flying his plane to Toronto to attend the association&#x27;s meeting.

On January 12, 1987, a Trillium Air Britten-Norman BN-2A-20 Islander crashed into Lake Ontario. The two people on board the aircraft, the pilot and a passenger, were rescued after the accident, but the pilot later died as a result of hypothermia.

On January 12, 1992, Graham Sellers, the pilot and only occupant of a Piper Twin Comanche two-engine four-seater plane, died when both engines failed on his final approach to land at the airport. Sellars was test flying the aircraft after it had been serviced for engine problems. His plane clipped the treetops, crashed through the airport&#x27;s perimeter chain link fence and came to rest on the grass next to Runway 33.

On October 9, 1993, Nigel, Louise and Sarah Martin and Dennis Kaye died in the crash of a Beech Baron that had just taken off from the island airport. The plane crashed into Lake Ontario one mile west of Ontario Place, south of Sunnyside. The plane burst into flames upon impact and burned before sinking into of water. The pilot radioed that he had engine trouble and was going to return to the airport. The plane had engine work done the week before.

<text>The Battle of Pavia, fought on the morning of 24 February 1525, was the decisive engagement of the Italian War of 1521–1526 between the Kingdom of France and the Habsburg Empire of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor as well as ruler of Spain, Austria, the Low Countries, and the Two Sicilies.

The French army was led by King Francis I of France, who laid siege to the city of Pavia (then part of the Duchy of Milan within the Holy Roman Empire) in October 1524 with 26,200 troops. The French infantry consisted of 6,000 French foot soldiers and 17,000 foreign mercenaries: 8,000 Swiss, 5,000 Germans, and 4,000 Italians (Black Bands). The French cavalry consisted of 2,000 &quot;gendarmes&quot; and 1,200 lances fournies. Charles V, intending to break the siege, sent a relief force of 22,300 troops to Pavia (where the Imperial garrison stationed consisted of 5,000 Germans and 1,000 Spaniards) under the command of the Fleming Charles de Lannoy, Imperial lieutenant and viceroy of Naples, and of the French renegade and captain-general Charles III, Duke of Bourbon. Other major Imperial commanders were the Italian condottiero Fernando d&#x27;Avalos, the German military leader Georg Frundsberg, and the Spanish captain Antonio de Leyva, who was in charge of the Imperial garrison inside Pavia. The Habsburg infantry consisted of 12,000 Germans (Landsknechte), 5,000 Spaniards, and 3,000 Italians. Within the infantry, Imperial arquebusiers formed a part of the Spanish &quot;colunellas&quot; and of the German doppelsöldners. The Imperial cavalry consisted of 1,500 knights and 800 lances.

The battle was fought in the Visconti Park of Mirabello di Pavia, outside the city walls. In the four-hour battle, the French army was split and defeated in detail. Many of the chief nobles of France were killed, and others – including Francis I himself – were captured. The historian Francesco Guicciardini summarised the clash as follows:

Francis was imprisoned in the nearby tower of Pizzighettone and later transferred to Spain, where Charles V was residing for his upcoming marriage with Isabella of Portugal. Together they signed the Treaty of Madrid of 1526, by which Francis abandoned claims over the Imperial Duchy of Milan and ceded Burgundy to the House of Habsburg in exchange for his freedom. Francis, however, denounced the treaty after his liberation and soon re-opened hostilities over Burgundy and Milan.

== Prelude ==
The French, in possession of Lombardy at the start of the Italian War of 1521–26, had been forced to abandon it after their defeat at the Battle of Bicocca in 1522. Determined to regain it, Francis ordered an invasion of the region in late 1523, under the command of Guillaume Gouffier, Seigneur de Bonnivet; but Bonnivet was defeated by Imperial troops at the Battle of the Sesia and forced to withdraw to France.

Charles de Lannoy now launched an invasion of Provence under the command of Fernando d&#x27;Ávalos, Marquis of Pescara and Charles III, Duke of Bourbon (who had recently betrayed Francis and allied himself with the Emperor). While initially successful, the Imperial offensive lost valuable time during the Siege of Marseille and was forced to withdraw back to Italy by the arrival of Francis and the main French army at Avignon.

In mid-October 1524, Francis himself crossed the Alps and advanced on Milan at the head of an army numbering more than 40,000. Bourbon and Pescara, their troops not yet recovered from the campaign in Provence, were in no position to offer serious resistance. The French army moved in several columns, brushing aside Imperial attempts to hold its advance, but failed to bring the main body of Imperial troops to battle. Nevertheless, Charles de Lannoy, who had concentrated some 16,000 men to resist the 33,000 French troops closing on Milan, decided that the city could not be defended and withdrew to Lodi on 26 October. Having entered Milan and installed Louis II de la Trémoille as the governor, Francis (at the urging of Bonnivet and against the advice of his other senior commanders, who favoured a more vigorous pursuit of the retreating Lannoy) advanced on Pavia, where Antonio de Leyva remained with a sizable Imperial garrison of about 9,000.

The bulk of the French army arrived at Pavia in the last days of October. By 2 November, Anne de Montmorency had crossed the Ticino River and invested the city from the south, completing its encirclement. Inside were about 9,000 men, mainly mercenaries whom Antonio de Leyva was able to pay only by melting the church plate. A period of skirmishing and artillery bombardments followed, and several breaches had been made in the walls by mid-November. On 21 November, Francis attempted an assault on the city through two of the breaches but was beaten back with heavy casualties; hampered by rainy weather and a lack of gunpowder, the French decided to wait for the defenders to starve.

In early December, a Spanish force commanded by Hugo de Moncada landed near Genoa, intending to interfere in a conflict between pro-Valois and pro-Habsburg factions in the city. Francis dispatched a larger force under the Marquis of Saluzzo to intercept them. Confronted by the more numerous French and left without naval support by the arrival of a pro-Valois fleet commanded by Andrea Doria, the Spanish troops surrendered. Francis then signed a secret agreement with Pope Clement VII, who pledged not to assist Charles in exchange for Francis&#x27;s assistance with the conquest of Naples. Against the advice of his senior commanders, Francis detached a portion of his forces under the Duke of Albany and sent them south to aid the Pope. Lannoy attempted to intercept the expedition near Fiorenzuola, but suffered heavy casualties and was forced to return to Lodi by the intervention of the infamous Black Bands of Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, Italian mercenaries which had just entered French service. Medici then returned to Pavia with a supply train of gunpowder and shot gathered by the Duke of Ferrara; but the French position was simultaneously weakened by the departure of nearly 5,000 Grisons Swiss mercenaries, who returned to their cantons to defend them against marauding landsknechts.

In January 1525, Lannoy was reinforced by the arrival of Georg Frundsberg with 15,000 fresh landsknechts from Germany and renewed the offensive. Pescara captured the French outpost at Sant&#x27;Angelo Lomellina, cutting the lines of communication between Pavia and Milan, while a separate column of landsknechts advanced on Belgiojoso and, despite being briefly pushed back by a raid led by Medici and Bonnivet, occupied the town. By 2 February, Lannoy was only a few miles from Pavia. Francis had encamped the majority of his forces in the great walled Visconti Park of Mirabello outside the city walls, placing them between Leyva&#x27;s garrison and the approaching relief army. Skirmishing and sallies by the garrison continued through February. Medici was seriously wounded and withdrew to Piacenza to recuperate, forcing Francis to recall much of the Milan garrison to offset the departure of the Black Band; but the fighting had little overall effect. On 21 February, the Imperial commanders, running low on supplies and mistakenly believing that the French forces were more numerous than their own, decided to launch an attack on Mirabello Castle in order to save face and demoralize the French sufficiently to ensure a safe withdrawal.

The Imperial and Spanish armaments and soldiers for the battle were substantially financed by the Jakob Fugger German bank, and the Castilian bank Banca Palenzuela Levi Kahana. 

== Battle ==
:&quot;The times given here are taken from Konstam&#x27;s reconstruction of the battle&quot;.

=== Movements in the dark ===

On the evening of 23 February, Lannoy&#x27;s imperial troops, who had been encamped outside the east wall of the Visconti Park, began their march north along the walls. Although Konstam indicates that at the same time, the Imperial artillery began a bombardment of the French siege lines – which had become routine during the extended siege – to conceal Lannoy&#x27;s movement, Juan de Oznaya (a soldier who participated in the battle and wrote about it in 1544) indicates that at that moment, the Imperial troops set their tents on fire to mislead the French into believing that they were retreating. Meanwhile, Imperial engineers quickly worked to create a breach in the park walls, at the Porta Pescarina near the village of San Genesio, through which the Imperial army could enter. By 5:00 am, some 3,000 arquebusiers under the command of Alfonso d&#x27;Avalos, Marquis of Vasto had entered the park and were rapidly advancing on Mirabello Castle, where they believed the French headquarters to be; simultaneously, Imperial light cavalry spread out from the breach into the park, intending to intercept any French movements.

Meanwhile, a detachment of French cavalry under Charles Tiercelin encountered the Imperial cavalry and began a series of skirmishes with them. A mass of Swiss pikemen under Robert de la Marck, Seigneur de la Flourance moved up to assist them, overrunning a battery of Spanish artillery that had been dragged into the park. They missed Vasto&#x27;s &quot;arcabuceros&quot; – who had by 6:30 am emerged from the woods near the castle, and swiftly overrun it – and blundered into 6,000 of Georg Frundsberg&#x27;s landsknechts. By 7:00 am, a full-scale infantry battle had developed not far from the original breach.

=== Francis attacks ===

A third mass of troops – the German and Spanish heavy cavalry under Lannoy himself, as well as Pescara&#x27;s Spanish infantry – had meanwhile been moving through the woods to the west, closer to where Francis was encamped. The French did not realize the magnitude of the Imperial attack for some time; however, by about 7:20 am, Pescara&#x27;s advance had been spotted by a battery of French artillery, which commenced firing on the Spanish lines. This alerted Francis, who launched a charge against Lannoy&#x27;s outnumbered cavalry with the entire force of French gendarmes, scattering the Spanish by 7:40 am.

Francis&#x27;s precipitate advance, however, had not only masked the fire of the French artillery, but also pulled him away from the mass of French infantry, commanded by Richard de la Pole, and by Francois de Lorraine, who led the Black Band of renegade landsknecht pikemen (not to be confused with the Italian mercenary company of arquebusiers by the same name), which was 4,000 to 5,000 men strong. Pescara, left in command of the Spanish forces after Lannoy had followed the retreating cavalry, formed his men up at the edge of the woods and sent messengers to Bourbon, Frundsberg, and Vasto requesting assistance.

Frundsberg meanwhile mauled the heavily outnumbered Swiss infantry opposing him; Tiercelin and Flourance were unable to hold their troops together, and the French foot began to flee the field.

=== Endgame ===

By 8:00 am, a mass of Imperial pikemen and arquebusiers descended on the French cavalry from all sides. Lacking room to manoeuvre because of the surrounding woods, the French gendarmes were surrounded and systematically killed. Richard de la Pole and Lorraine, advancing to assist Francis, were met by Frundsberg&#x27;s arriving landsknechts; the French infantry was broken and routed, and de la Pole and Lorraine were both killed. In a particularly bitter contest between Imperial and freelance landsknechts, the Black Band was surrounded by Frundsberg&#x27;s pikemen and exterminated where it stood. The French king fought on as his horse was killed under him by Cesare Hercolani, an Italian Condottiero; surrounded by Spanish arquebusiers and German Landsknecht, he was taken prisoner and escorted from the field.

Meanwhile, Antonio de Leyva had sortied with the garrison, overrunning the 3,000 Swiss under Montmorency that had been manning the siege lines. The remnants of the Swiss – both Montmorency&#x27;s and Flourance&#x27;s – tried to flee across the river, suffering massive casualties as they did. The French rearguard, under the Duke of Alençon, had taken no part in the battle; when the Duke realized what had occurred in the park, he quickly began to retreat towards Milan. By 9:00 am, the battle was over.

==Francis&#x27; capture and consequences==
The exact nature of Francis&#x27;s surrender—in particular, who exactly had taken him prisoner—is uncertain, with a variety of candidates put forward by historians, including:

*Charles de Lannoy himself, who made King Francis his prisoner as the two exchanged their swords. According to an account, Lannoy kneeled in front of Francis out of respect.
*Three Spanish soldiers: namely Alonso Pita da Veiga, Juan de Urbieta and Diego Dávila.
*&quot;Some Germans&quot; who, according to an early report of the battle, found Francis on the ground and wanted to kill him but spared his life after he shouted that he was the king of France.
*Nicholas, Count of Salm, made a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece for the capture of King Francis.
*The Italian condottiero Cesare Hercolani, who was rewarded as a &quot;hero of Pavia&quot; by Charles V.
*Other individuals proposed in some accounts as crucial for the capture are Pedro de Valdivia, the future conqueror of Chile, who may have prevented another soldier from killing Francis by mistake and two French traitors, followers of Charles de Bourbon, who might have persuaded King Francis to surrender.

The fact of the matter is that the individuals mentioned above were all given credit for the capture of Francis I in various ways, and Charles V himself honoured different people for the achievement over the years. The decree granting a coat of arms to Alonso Pita da Veiga for his deeds at the Battle of Pavia, was archived at the General Archive of Simanca (Archivo general de Simancas, legajo 388, rotulado de &quot;Mercedes y Privilegios.&#x27;) and was issued by Emperor Charles V on 24 July 1529. In that decree, Charles V does not credit a single individual but, rather, a group of individuals that includes da Veiga: &quot; ... and in the same battle, you (Alonso Pita da Veiga) accomplished so much that you reached the person of said King (Francis I of France) and captured him, jointly with the other persons that captured him.&quot; (&quot; ... &quot;y en la misma batalla ficistes tanto que allegastes á la misma persona del dicho Rey, y fuistes en prenderle, juntamente con las otras personas que le prendieron&quot; ...&quot;) Finally, in his autobiography, Charles V claimed that &quot;the King was made prisoner by his principal captains&quot;, crediting the Duke of Bourbon, Charles de Lannoy, and the Marquis of Pescara.

===Aftermath===

The French defeat was decisive. Aside from Francis, a number of leading French nobles, including Montmorency and Flourance, had been captured; an even greater number – among them Bonnivet, La Tremoille, Thomas de Foix-Lescun, René of Savoy, La Palice, Richard de la Pole (the last Yorkist and pretender to the English crown) and Lorraine – had been killed in the fighting. Francis was taken to the fortress of Pizzighettone, where he wrote a letter to Louise of Savoy, his mother: 

Soon afterwards, he finally learned that the Duke of Albany had lost the larger part of his army to attrition and desertion, and had returned to France without ever having reached Naples. The broken remnants of the French forces, aside from a small garrison left to hold the Castel Sforzesco in Milan, retreated across the Alps under the nominal command of Charles IV of Alençon, reaching Lyon by March.

Charles de Lannoy kept Francis I in his custody and imprisoned him in a tower of Pizzighettone. The king was then brought to Genoa and from there he was taken to Spain. He remained jailed in a tower in Madrid until the Treaty of Madrid was signed. According to the treaty, Francis I abandoned his claims over Flanders, Milan and Burgundy. However, the peace treaty was broken in the same year and a new French-Imperial war lasted from 1526 to 1529.

==Art==
In Rome Cardinal Ippolito de&#x27; Medici, who acted as Florentine emissary to Charles V in 1535, expressed support for the Emperor&#x27;s victory by commissioning a rock crystal low relief in the manner of an Antique cameo, from the gem engraver Giovanni Bernardi. The classicizing treatment of the event lent it a timeless, mythic quality and reflected on the culture and taste of the patron.

An oil-on-panel &quot;Battle of Pavia&quot;, painted by an anonymous Flemish artist, depicts the military engagement between the armies of Charles V and Francis I. Because of its detail, the painting is considered an accurate visual record, probably based on eyewitness accounts. A suite of seven Brussels tapestries after cartoons by Bernard van Orley (above right) celebrate the Imperial–Spanish victory. A set is kept in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples; they were donated to Charles V in 1531 by the Estates General of the Spanish Netherlands.

== Battlefield today ==

Much of the battle took place within the immense hunting reserve of the Dukes of Milan, the Visconti Park, which extended for over 2,200 hectares. The Visconti Park no longer exists, most of its woods were cut between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to make room for the fields, however three natural reserves survive that can be considered the heirs of the park, they are the heronry of the Carola, that of Porta Chiossa and the Vernavola Park, which cover an area of 148 hectares. In particular, some of the most important episodes of the battle took place inside the Vernavola park, which extends southwest of the Mirabello Castle.
Near the park, in 2015, two cannonballs were found during some agricultural work, probably fired by French artillery. Although partially mutilated during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when it was transformed into a farm, the Mirabello Castle, once the seat of the ducal captain of the park, still stands today a short distance from Vernavola and preserves inside some curious decorative elements (fireplaces, frescoes and windows) not yet adequately restored and studied, in French late Gothic style, added to the structure of the Sforza period during the first French domination of the Duchy of Milan (1500- 1513). About two kilometres to the north, along the Cantone Tre Miglia road, is the Repentita farmhouse, where Francesco I was captured and, according to tradition, was housed. The complex still retains parts of the fifteenth-century masonry and an inscription placed on the external wall recalls the event.
In the nearby town of San Genesio ed Uniti in via Porta Pescarina there are some of the remains of the park gate where, in the night between 23 and 24 February 1525, the imperials made the three breaches that started the battle. Less evident are the traces of the battle in Pavia: the city walls, which defended the city during the siege, were replaced, around the middle of the sixteenth century, by robust bastions, partly preserved. Instead, in addition to the Visconti Castle (where the tombstone of Eitel Friedrich III, Count of Hohenzollern, captain of the Landsknechte is preserved), two gates of the medieval walls: Porta Nuova and Porta Calcinara.
The eastern outskirts of Pavia are home to some monasteries (almost all now deconsecrated) that hosted the Swiss and German mercenaries of Francis I, such as the monastery of Santi Spirito and Gallo, that of San Giacomo della Vernavola, that of San Pietro in Verzolo and the Church of San Lazzaro, while in the western one there is the church of San Lanfranco (where Francis I was based) and the basilica of Santissimo Salvatore. In the church of San Teodoro there is a large fresco depicting the city during the siege of 1522, in it, with a certain wealth of detail, Pavia and its surroundings are depicted, exactly as they must have appeared at the time of the battle.

<text>Canary Wharf is a London Underground station at Canary Wharf and is on the Jubilee line, between and stations. The station is located in Travelcard Zone 2 and was opened on 17 September 1999 as part of the Jubilee Line Extension. Over 40 million people pass through the station each year, making it second busiest on the London Underground outside Central London after Stratford, and also the busiest that serves only a single line.

==History==
Before the arrival of the Jubilee line, London&#x27;s Docklands had suffered from relatively poor public transport. Although the Docklands Light Railway station at Canary Wharf had been operating since 1987, by 1990 it was obvious that the DLR&#x27;s capacity would soon be reached. The Jubilee line&#x27;s routing through Canary Wharf was intended to relieve some of this pressure.

The tube station was intended from the start to be the showpiece of the Jubilee Line Extension, and the contract for its design was awarded in 1990 to the architect Sir Norman Foster. It was constructed, by a Tarmac Construction / Bachy UK Joint Venture, in a drained arm of the former dock, using a simple &quot;cut and cover&quot; method to excavate an enormous pit 24 metres (78 ft) deep and 265 metres (869 ft) long. The station was opened on 17 September 1999. In 2004, three additional entrances to the station were opened, increasing the station capacity.

The size of the interior has led to it being compared to a cathedral, and it has even been used to celebrate a wedding. Foster based the design upon previous work done for the Bilbao metro, colloquially named &quot;Fosteritos&quot;. However, the main reason for the station&#x27;s enormous dimensions was the great number of passengers predicted; as many as 50,000 daily. It remains the only tube station to accommodate rush hour demand. These predictions have been outgrown, with as many as 69,759 on weekdays recorded in 2006 and within a decade it had become the only station outside of Zone 1 to be ranked within the top-ten most used stations.

Canary Wharf station and the Jubilee line Extension itself were partly funded by the owners of the Canary Wharf complex, to make it more accessible to commuters. The Canary Wharf group had committed to £500 million of funding for the capital costs, over 24 years. They were, however, underwhelmed by the proposed service frequency. Only five years after the construction of the extension, capacity issues started becoming apparent and upgrades were required. The first step was the lengthening of the trains from 6 to 7 cars. This was done at the end of 2005. The second step was to replace the conventional Jubilee line signalling with the Thales S40 moving-block system. This was eventually introduced into service during 2011 after many delays and teething problems and allows a more intensive timetable to operate with 30 trains per hour running in the peaks.

In a 2013 poll conducted by YouGov, it was voted as the &quot;Most Loved&quot; tube station in London and &quot;despite its immense volume [it is] comfortable and inviting&quot;. Five years after opening, a study concluded that the new station had increased land values by £2 billion.

In January 2019, a person died after falling from an escalator; this led to the station being temporarily closed.

== Awards and accreditations ==
In the year 2000, Canary Wharf Tube Station received seven architecture awards:
* AIA UK Design Awards (2000) – Commendation 
* Civic Trust Award (2000)
* The National Lighting Design Awards (2000) – Distinction
* Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Architecture Award (2000)
* Royal Fine Art Commission Trust – Building of the Year Award (2000)
* Railway Forum/Modern Railways – Industry Innovation Award (2000)
* British Construction Industry Awards (BCIA) – Special Award (2000)
* World Architecture Awards (2001) – Best Transport/ Infrastructure Building

==The station today==

Above ground there is little sign of the vast interior: two curved glass canopies at the east and west ends of the station cover the entrances and allow daylight into the ticket hall below. The Jubilee Park, a public park is situated between the two canopies, above the station concourse. It had originally been intended that the infilled section of the dock would be reinstated above the station, but this proved impractical because of technical difficulties and the park was created instead.

As with the other below-ground stations on the Jubilee Line extension, both station platforms are equipped with platform screen doors. There are 20 escalators and 3 lifts serving the 2 platforms.

Canary Wharf station has become one of the busiest stations on the network, serving the ever-expanding Canary Wharf business district. Although it shares its name with the Docklands Light Railway station at Canary Wharf, the two are not directly integrated (in fact, Heron Quays DLR station is nearer at street level). Initially, a direct interchange between the DLR had been hoped for, but development in the intervening years had prevented this goal. All three stations are connected via shopping malls underneath Jubilee Park, Cabot Square and Canada Square. Out-of-station interchange within twenty minutes between any two of the stations entails no additional charge. On 24 May 2022, the Canary Wharf railway station on the Elizabeth Line was opened.

Canary Wharf can be used to reverse trains from both the east and the west. A scissors crossover west of the station allows trains from Stanmore to enter either the east- or west-bound platform at the station, and trains from Stratford enter the normal westbound platform and can use this scissors crossover to reverse back towards Stratford.

==Services and connections==
The station is located on the Jubilee line between Canada Water and North Greenwich in Travelcard Zone 2. The typical off-peak service, in trains per hour (tph) is:
*24tph eastbound to Stratford
*12tph westbound to Stanmore
*4tph westbound to Wembley Park
*4tph westbound to Willesden Green
*4tph westbound to West Hampstead

Night Tube services, running on Friday and Saturday nights, were introduced in October 2016. Trains run every 10 minutes on the entire line.
* 6 tph Stanmore – Stratford

==Future proposals==
Canary Wharf Group (CWG) has called for the Bakerloo line extension to Lewisham to be diverted to Surrey Quays and Canary Wharf from Old Kent Road, before running to Charlton, CWG suggest the current Jubilee Line not being able to cope with demand from the yet to be approved new Canada Water scheme.
CWG has also proposed a new underground line between Euston and Canary Wharf which is being considered by the government.

==In popular culture==

On 9 January 2013, the station appeared on a £1.28 British postage stamp as part of a set commemorating the 150th anniversary of the first London underground train journey. The stamp&#x27;s captions read &quot;Jubilee Line at Canary Wharf&quot; and &quot;1999&quot;. The Canary Wharf stamp represented the most modern phase of the Underground in the set of six stamps.

The station was used as a filming location for some scenes of Danny Boyle&#x27;s 2002 film 28 Days Later, and its 2007 sequel 28 Weeks Later. In April 2016, Canary Wharf station was used as a filming location for an Imperial base in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film &quot;Rogue One&quot;. The location shoot took place between midnight and 4 am, when the station was closed to the public, and was commented on by &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans using Twitter.

== Connections ==
London Buses routes 135, 277, D7 and night routes N277 and N550 serve the tube station.

<text>The Orteig Prize was a reward of $25,000 offered in 1919 by New York City hotel owner Raymond Orteig to the first Allied aviator, or aviators, to fly non-stop from New York City to Paris or vice versa. Several famous aviators made unsuccessful attempts at the New York–Paris flight before a relatively unknown American, Charles Lindbergh, won the prize in 1927 with his aircraft the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;.

A number of people died while competing to win the prize. Six people perished in three separate crashes, and another three were injured in a fourth crash. The Orteig Prize spurred considerable investment in aviation—sometimes far exceeding the value of the prize itself—and also advanced public interest in, and the development of, aviation technology.

==Background==
The Orteig Prize was a $25,000 reward () offered on May 22, 1919, by New York hotel owner Raymond Orteig to the first Allied aviator(s) to fly non-stop from New York City to Paris or vice versa. The offer was in the spirit of several similar aviation prize offers, and was made in a letter to Alan Ramsay Hawley, president of the Aero Club of America at the behest of Aero Club secretary Augustus Post.

Gentlemen: As a stimulus to the courageous aviators, I desire to offer, through the auspices and regulations of the Aero Club of America, a prize of $25,000 to the first aviator of any Allied Country crossing the Atlantic in one flight, from Paris to New York or New York to Paris, all other details in your care.

Yours very sincerely,

Raymond Orteig
The Aero Club replied on May 26 with Orteig confirming his offer three days later. His offer was accepted by the Aero Club and Augustus Post set up a formal structure to administer the competition.
Coincidentally, just a few weeks later Alcock and Brown successfully completed the first non-stop crossing of the Atlantic from Newfoundland to Ireland, winning an earlier prize offer, and in late June the British airship R34 made an east-west crossing from East Fortune, Scotland, to Long Island, New York, returning by the same route in early July.

On offer for five years, the goal of the prize seemed beyond the capacity of aircraft of the time and the prize attracted no competitors. After its original term had expired Orteig reissued the prize on June 1, 1925 by depositing $25,000 in negotiable securities at the Bryant Bank with the awarding put under the control of a seven-member board of trustees. By then the state of aviation technology had advanced to the point that numerous competitors vied for the prize.

==Attempts on the prize==

In 1926 the first serious attempt on the prize was made by a team led by French flying ace René Fonck, backed by Igor Sikorsky, the aircraft designer. Sikorsky, who put $100,000 towards the attempt, built an aircraft, the S-35, for the purpose, and in September that year Fonck, with three companions, made their flight. However the aircraft was hopelessly overloaded and crashed in flames attempting to take off. Fonck and his co-pilot, Curtin, survived, but his companions, Clavier and Islamoff, were killed.

By 1927 three groups in the United States and one in Europe were known to be preparing attempts on the prize.

From the US:
*polar explorer Richard E. Byrd, with Floyd Bennett and George Noville as crew, and backed by Rodman Wanamaker, had commissioned an aircraft, a trimotor named &quot;America&quot; from designer Anthony Fokker.
*aviators Clarence Chamberlin and Bert Acosta, backed by Charlie Levine, planned an attempt in a Bellanca aircraft named &quot;Columbia&quot;.
*a third team, Stanton Wooster and Noel Davis, prepared to try in a Keystone Pathfinder, named &quot;American Legion&quot; for their principal supporters,

Meanwhile, in France, Charles Nungesser and François Coli were preparing for an east-west crossing in a Levasseur aircraft, &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Blanc&quot;.

In April 1927 the various teams assembled and prepared for their attempts, but all suffered mishaps.

Chamberlin and Acosta undertook a series of flights, increasing &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; weight as they went to test the aircraft&#x27;s capability and to simulate the planned takeoff weight. They also simulated the duration of the flight, setting an endurance record in the process. However their attempt was riven with arguments, between Levine and the others, resulting in Acosta leaving the team for Byrd&#x27;s and his replacement, Lloyd Bertaud, taking legal action against Levine over a contract dispute.

Byrd&#x27;s team also made preparations. Wanamaker had the Roosevelt Field improved (Fonck&#x27;s crash had been caused in part by the aircraft hitting a sunken road running across the runway) while Byrd had a ramp built for &quot;America&quot; to roll down on takeoff, providing extra impetus. However, on 8 April Byrd&#x27;s team, in &quot;America&quot;, crashed during a test flight; Bennet was injured and unable to continue.

On 26 April Davis and Wooster, in &quot;American Legion&quot;, also crashed on a test flight; this time both were killed.

On 8 May Nungesser and Coli set off from Paris in &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Blanc&quot; to attempt an east-west crossing, a more difficult proposition given the prevailing winds; they were last seen off the coast of Ireland, but never arrived in New York and no trace of them was ever found, creating one of aviation&#x27;s great mysteries.

Meanwhile, a late challenge, by solo flyer Charles Lindbergh in Ryan aircraft &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, and backed by bankers in St. Louis, Missouri, was started in February, with Lindbergh arriving at Roosevelt Field in mid-May.

Lindbergh had chosen to fly solo, although this was not a requirement of the prize and required him to be at the controls for more than 30 hours. Following a period of bad weather, and before it had sufficiently cleared, Lindbergh took off for Paris, stealing a march on his rivals.

Lindbergh pursued a risky strategy for the competition; instead of using a tri-motor, as favored by most other groups, he decided on a single engined aircraft. The decision allowed him to save weight and carry extra fuel as a reserve for detours or emergencies. He also decided to fly the aircraft solo, so avoiding the personality conflicts that helped delay at least one group. To save weight which had contributed to the crashes of other contributors, Lindbergh also dispensed with non-essential equipment like radios, sextant, and a parachute, although he did take an inflatable raft. The final factor in his success was his decision to fly into weather conditions that were clearing but not clear enough for others to consider safe. Lindbergh was quoted as saying &quot;What kind of man would live where there is no danger? I don&#x27;t believe in taking foolish chances. But nothing can be accomplished by not taking a chance at all.&quot;

==Aftermath==
After Lindbergh&#x27;s success, the other teams had to re-evaluate their aims. 
Chamberlin decided to attempt a flight to Berlin, which his endurance flight had shown to be achievable, and for which the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce were offering a $15,000 prize. On 4 June Chamberlin (and, at the last minute, Levine) took off in &quot;Columbia&quot; for Berlin; they arrived over Germany after a flight of 42 hours but were unable to find their way to the city and landed, out of fuel, at Eisleben, 60 miles to the south-west. They finally arrived in Berlin on 7 June.

Byrd, meanwhile, announced his aim was not simply the prize, but “to demonstrate that the world was ready for safe, regular, multi-person flight across the Atlantic” and that he would head for Paris, as planned. He and his crew, Acosta, Noville and, as a late addition, Bernt Balchen (who actually did most of the flying) set off in &quot;America&quot; for Paris on 29 June. However, after a 40-hour flight they were unable to find the airfield at Le Bourget and turned back to ditch on the coast, landing at Ver-sur-Mer, Normandy, on 1 July.

Advancing public interest and aviation technology, the Prize occasioned investments many times the value of the prize. In addition, people died by men who were competing to win the prize. Six men died in three separate crashes. Another three men were injured in a fourth crash. During the spring and summer of 1927, 40 pilots attempted various long-distance over-ocean flights, leading to 21 deaths during the attempts. For example, seven people died in August 1927 in the Orteig Prize-inspired $25,000 Dole Air Race to fly from San Francisco to Hawaii.

1927 saw a number of aviation firsts and new records. The record for longest time in the air, longest flight distance, and longest overwater flight were set and all exceeded Lindbergh&#x27;s effort. However, no other flyer gained the fame that Lindbergh did for winning the Orteig Prize.

The Orteig Prize inspired the $10 million Ansari X Prize for repeated suborbital private spaceflights. Similar to the Orteig Prize, it was announced some eight years before it was won in 2004.

*April 25 - Clarence Chamberlin and Bert Acosta in the $25,000 Bellanca WB-2 monoplane, &quot;Columbia&quot;, set the world endurance record for airplanes, staying aloft circling New York City for 51 hours, 11 minutes, and 25 seconds and covering 4,100 miles, more than the 3,600 mile from New York to Paris
*April 26 - U.S Naval pilots, Lieut. Comdr. Noel Davis and Lieut. Stanton Hall Wooster, are killed when their Keystone Pathfinder, &quot;American Legion&quot;, fails to gain altitude during a test flight at Langley Field, Virginia, about a week before they expected to attempt the New York to Paris flight. 
*Early May - Both Chamberlain&#x27;s and Byrd&#x27;s group are at adjoining Curtiss and Roosevelt Fields in New York awaiting favorable flight conditions. The owner of Chamberlain&#x27;s aircraft, Charles Levine is feuding with co-pilot Lloyd W. Bertaud who obtains a legal injunction. Byrd&#x27;s group are still testing new equipment and instruments. 
*May 8 - Charles Nungesser and François Coli attempted a Paris to New York crossing in a Levasseur PL-8 biplane, &#x27; &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Blanc&quot; &quot;(The White Bird)&quot; &#x27; but were lost at sea, or possibly crashed in Maine.

<text>The Gods Themselves is a 1972 science fiction novel written by Isaac Asimov, and his first original work in the science fiction genre in fifteen years (not counting his 1966 novelization of &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;). It won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1972, and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1973.

The book is divided into three main parts, which were first published in &quot;Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Worlds of If&quot; as three consecutive stories.

==Overview==
The book is divided into three sections; the first set on the Earth, the second set on a planet in a parallel universe, and the third set on a lunar colony.

In the first section, the book opens at chapter six to give context to the other chapters, and alternates timelines. Thus, the flow is Chapter six overview of Chapter one, then Chapter one. Next, is Chapter six overview of Chapter two, then Chapter two. Following chapter three to five, chapter six then concludes, and the story proceeds with chapter seven.

The main plot-line is a project by those who inhabit a parallel universe (the para-Universe) with different physical laws from this one. By exchanging matter from their universe—para-Universe—with our universe, they seek to exploit the differences in physical laws. The exchange of matter provides an alternative source of energy to maintain their universe. However, the exchange will likely result in the collapse of the Earth&#x27;s Sun into a supernova, and possibly even turning a large part of the Milky Way into a quasar. There is hope among those in the para-Universe that the energy explosion does happen in our universe.

===Timeline===
In Part I, the novel specifically refers to the date October 3, 2070, as a date when the character Hallam entered the laboratory to work. Later in Part I, in chapter two, the book states that the character Peter Lamont had been two years old when Hallam performed the work set in 2070, and Lamont was 25 years old when he began working at the Pump Station. Accordingly, the bulk of the novel is set sometime around the year 2093. In Part III, the novel states that the Earth&#x27;s population has been reduced to two billion people following a &quot;Great Crisis&quot;. It caused significant ecological damage, with all apes except for gibbons extinct outside of zoos, and technological progress being viewed with suspicion – for example, genetic engineering research is banned outright. Part III of the novel takes place on a lunar colony with about 20,000 people, half of which were &quot;native Lunarites&quot;. The colony is stated to be the last leftover of pre-Crisis humanity, making it the leader in many sciences.

==Plot summary==

===First part: Against Stupidity===
The first part takes place on Earth, almost a century after the &quot;Great Crisis&quot;, where ecological and economic collapse reduced the world&#x27;s population from six billion to two billion. The timeline alternates between the events of the 2070s, outlining the discovery of the &quot;electron pump,&quot; and events twenty-three years later.

Radiochemist Frederick Hallam discovers that a container&#x27;s contents have been altered. He finds out that the sample, originally tungsten, has been transformed into plutonium 186—an isotope that cannot occur naturally in our universe. As this is investigated, Hallam gets the credit for suggesting that the matter has been exchanged by beings in a parallel universe; this leads to the development of a cheap, clean, and apparently endless source of energy: the &quot;Pump&quot;, which transfers matter between our universe (where plutonium 186 decays into tungsten 186) and a parallel one governed by different physical laws (where tungsten 186 turns into plutonium 186), yielding a nuclear reaction in the process. The development process grants Hallam high status in public opinion, winning him power, position, and a Nobel Prize.

Physicist Peter Lamont, while writing a history of the Pump about 25 years later, comes to believe that the impetus of the Pump was the effort of the extraterrestrial &quot;para-men&quot;. Lamont enlists the help of Myron &quot;Mike&quot; Bronowski, an archeologist and linguist known for translating ancient writings in the Etruscan language, to prove his claim by communicating with the parallel world. They inscribe symbols on strips of tungsten to establish a common written language as the strips are exchanged for ones made of plutonium-186. As Bronowski works, Lamont discovers that the Pump increases the strong nuclear force inside the sun, and thus threatens both universes by the explosion of Earth&#x27;s Sun and the cooling of that in the parallel universe. Bronowski receives an acknowledgment from the parallel universe that the Pump may be dangerous. Lamont attempts to demonstrate this to a politician and several members of the scientific community, but they refuse his request. Lamont decides to tell the para-men to stop the use of the Pump, but Bronowski reveals that they have been in contact not with the other side&#x27;s authorities, but with dissidents unable to stop the Pump on their side. The last message was them begging &quot;Earth&quot; to stop.

===Second part: The Gods Themselves===
The second part is set in the parallel universe in which, because the nuclear force is stronger, stars are smaller and burn out faster than in our universe. It takes place on a world orbiting a sun that is dying. Because atoms behave differently in this universe, substances can move through each other and appear to occupy the same space. This gives the intelligent beings unique abilities. Time itself appears to flow differently in this universe: the events take place in an apparently short space of time in the lives of the inhabitants, while more than 20 years pass in our universe, and a long feeding break of one of the characters translates into a two-week gap on Lamont&#x27;s side.

Like the first part of the novel, this section has an unusual chapter numbering. Each chapter except the last is in three parts, named e.g. &quot;1a&quot;, &quot;1b&quot;, and &quot;1c&quot;. Each reflects the viewpoint of one of the three members of the &quot;triad&quot; central to the story&#x27;s theme.

The inhabitants are of two types: the dominant &quot;hard ones,&quot; whose bodies are solid and of a fixed shape, and the more fluid &quot;soft ones&quot;, whose bodies are mutable. The latter have three sexes with fixed roles for each sex:
* Rationals (or &quot;lefts&quot;) are the logical and scientific sex; identified with masculine pronouns and producing a form of sperm. They have limited ability to pass through other bodies.
* Emotionals (or &quot;mids&quot;) are the intuitive sex; identified with the feminine pronouns and provide the energy needed for reproduction. Emotionals can thin themselves to pass in and out of solid material, including rock.
* Parentals (or &quot;rights&quot;) bear and raise the offspring, and are identified with masculine pronouns. Parentals have almost no ability to blend their bodies with others, except when helped by one or both of the other sexes.

All three &#x27;genders&#x27; are embedded in sexual and social norms of expected and acceptable behavior. All three live by photosynthesis; whereas sexual intercourse is accomplished by bodily collapse into a single pool (known as &#x27;melting&#x27;). Rationals and Parentals can do this independently, but in the presence of an Emotional, the &quot;melt&quot; becomes total, which causes orgasm and also results in a period of unconsciousness and memory loss. Only during such a total &quot;melt&quot; can the Rational &quot;impregnate&quot; the Parental, with the Emotional providing the energy. Normally, the triad produces three children; a Rational, a Parental and Emotional (in that order), after which they &quot;pass on&quot; and disappear forever. In the past, some triads have repeated the cycle of births (thus ensuring population growth), but the declining amount of solar radiation no longer allows that. &quot;Stone-rubbing&quot; is a practice of partially melting with solid objects like rocks, possible for Emotionals, but the other genders are only capable of it in a very limited form. It is an analogue of human masturbation and generally frowned upon. Dua, the Emotional who functions as protagonist of this section of the book, appears to be the only one who practices it while married.

The hard ones regulate much of soft one society, allocating one of each sex to a mating group called a &quot;triad,&quot; and acting as mentors to the Rationals. Little is shown of &quot;hard one&quot; society; whereas Dua suspects that the &quot;hard ones&quot; are a dying race, retaining the &quot;soft ones&quot; as a replacement for their absent children. This is dismissed by Odeen, the Rational of Dua&#x27;s triad. Having the most contact with the &quot;hard ones,&quot; Odeen has heard them speak of a new &quot;hard one&quot; called Estwald, accounted of exceptional intelligence and the creator of the Pump.

Dua is an oddball Emotional who exhibits traits normally associated with Rationals, resulting in the nickname &quot;left-em.&quot; While being taught by Odeen, she also discovers the supernova problem that Lamont uncovered in the first section. Outraged that the Pump is allowed to operate, she attempts to halt it but cannot persuade her own species to abandon the Pump. Given that their own sun and all the other stars in their universe can no longer provide the energy necessary for reproduction, they consider the possible destruction of Earth&#x27;s Sun worthwhile if it might provide a more reliable source of energy.

Driven by an innate desire to procreate, Tritt, the &quot;Parental&quot; of the triad, at first asks Odeen to persuade Dua to facilitate the production of their third child. When this fails, Tritt steals an energy-battery from the Pump and rigs it to feed Dua, which stimulates the triad into a total melt, resulting in conception. Dua discovers this betrayal and escapes to the caves of the hard ones, where she transmits the warning messages received by Lamont. This effort nearly exhausts her mortally before she is found by her triad. Here it is revealed that the hard ones are not a separate species, but the fully mature form that the triads eventually coalesce into permanently. Each melt briefly allows the triad to shift into its hard form during the period they can&#x27;t later remember. Odeen convinces Dua that the hard one they will become will have influence with the others to stop the Pump; but as their final metamorphosis (the true meaning of &quot;passing on&quot;) begins, Dua realizes (too late to prevent irreversible union) that her own triad&#x27;s &quot;hard&quot; form is the scientist Estwald.

===Third part: Contend in Vain?===
The third part of the novel takes place on the Moon. Lunar society is diverging radically from that of Earth. The lower gravity has produced people with a very different physique. Their food supply is manufactured from algae and distasteful to inhabitants of Earth. They enjoy low-gravity sports that would be impossible on Earth, such as an acrobatic game like &quot;tag&quot; performed in a huge cylinder (these sports are vital to them, since their metabolism is still that of Earthmen, and proper strenuous exercise must be maintained for it to function properly). Some Lunarites want to further adapt their bodies to life on the Moon, but Earth has outlawed genetic engineering decades ago. Lunarites are beginning to see themselves as a separate race, although procreation between them and Earth people is quite common. Sex, however, is problematic, since an Earthborn person is likely to injure his or her partner due to loss of control. (Because Earth&#x27;s gravity is six times higher than that of the Moon, Earthmen are much stronger than Lunarites, and Lunarites&#x27; bones are much frailer.) Sexual morals are loose by Earth standards, and nudity is not taboo.

The plot centers on a cynical middle-aged ex-physicist named Denison, briefly introduced in Part 1 as the colleague and rival of Hallam whose snide remark drove Hallam to investigate the change in his sample of tungsten and, eventually, develop the Pump. Finding his career blocked by Hallam, Denison leaves science and enters the business world, becoming a success.

Denison, independently of Lamont, had deduced the danger in the Electron Pump. He visits the Moon colony hoping to work outside of Hallam&#x27;s influence using technology that the Lunarites have developed. He is helped by a Lunarite tourist guide named Selene Lindstrom. She is secretly an Intuitionist (a genetically engineered human with superhuman intuition), who is working with her lover, Barron Neville. They are both part of a group of political agitators who want independence from Earth. The group particularly wants to be allowed to research ways to use the Electron Pump on the Moon. Although solar energy is plentiful enough to power their underground habitats, Neville wants to live entirely underground and never have to venture out on the surface. With the scientists&#x27; help, Denison gets access to the technology and proves that the strong force is indeed increasing, and will cause the Sun to explode.

Denison continues his work, tapping into a third parallel universe that is in a pre-Big Bang state (called &quot;cosmic egg&quot; or &quot;cosmeg&quot;), where physical laws are totally opposite to those of Dua&#x27;s universe. Matter from the cosmeg starts with very weak nuclear force, and then spontaneously fuses as our universe&#x27;s physical laws take over. The exchange with the second parallel universe both produces more energy at little or no cost, and balances the changes from the Electron Pump, resulting in a return to equilibrium. However, Selene clandestinely conducts another test showing that momentum can also be exchanged with the cosmeg. Denison catches her and forces her to admit her secret purpose: Neville thinks the momentum exchange can be used to move anything without using rockets, including the Moon itself; he wants to break away from Earth in the most complete way possible. Denison is appalled, although he sees the potential of the technology to make travel within the Solar System easier, and to the stars possible.

When Selene discusses Neville&#x27;s plan with the rest of the group, most of them agree that moving the entire Moon will be meaningless, and building self-sufficient sublight starships will be better. A later public vote goes against Neville as well. Hallam is ruined by Denison&#x27;s revelations. Selene and Denison become a couple. Having received permission to conceive a second child, Selene requests Denison to become its father. The novel ends with them deciding to try working around the sexual incompatibility problem.

==Asimov&#x27;s relationship to the story==

In a letter of February 12, 1982, Asimov identified this as his favorite science fiction novel. Asimov&#x27;s short story &quot;Gold&quot;, one of the last he wrote in his life, describes the efforts of fictional computer animators to create a &quot;compu-drama&quot; from the novel&#x27;s second section.

Asimov took the names of the immature aliens—Odeen, Dua, and Tritt—from the words One, Two, and Three in the language of his native Russia, i.e. &quot;odin&quot; (один), &quot;dva&quot; (два) and &quot;tri&quot; (три).

Asimov&#x27;s inspiration for the title of the book, and its three sections, was a quotation from the play &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot; by Friedrich Schiller: &quot;Mit der Dummheit kämpfen Götter selbst vergebens&quot;: &quot;Against stupidity the gods themselves contend in vain&quot; (quoted in the book itself).

Asimov describes a conversation in January 1971 when Robert Silverberg had to refer to an isotope—just an arbitrary one—as an example. Silverberg said &quot;plutonium-186&quot;. &quot;There is no such isotope&quot;, said Asimov, &quot;and such a one can&#x27;t exist either&quot;. Silverberg dared Asimov to write a story about it. Later Asimov figured out under what conditions plutonium-186 could exist, and what complications and consequences it might imply. Asimov reasoned that it must belong to another universe with other physical laws; specifically, different nuclear forces necessary to allow a Pu-186 nucleus to hold itself together. He wrote down these ideas, intending to write a short story, but his editor, Larry Ashmead, asked him to expand it into a full novel. As a result of that request, Asimov wrote the second and third parts of the book.

In his autobiography, Asimov stated that the novel, especially the second section, was the &quot;biggest and most effective over-my-head writing [that I] ever produced&quot;.

==References to science==
At the time of writing, quasars had been only recently discovered and were not well understood. In the story Lamont suggests that quasars are in fact parts of galaxies that have undergone sudden increase in the strength of the strong nuclear force, resulting in an explosion of fusion energy. It is not certain if Asimov took into account the nature of solar fusion, where the primary reaction rate is governed by the weak nuclear force, transforming protons into neutrons, while the strong force governs the amount of energy released during reactions.

The book mentions quarks, but confines its discussion of the strong force to pions, which are the carriers of the force that binds protons and neutrons together, while gluons bind quarks within protons and neutrons. At the time, gluons were only suspected to exist while particles thought to be quarks had been observed directly.

Similarly, the Etruscan language and particularly Etruscan writings had not yet been translated and were enigmatic. As of 2022, the language&#x27;s possible relation to any other known language remains unproven. The character Bronowski is imagined to have solved the puzzle by considering the Basque language, which is also unique in Europe, as a relative of ancient Etruscan. Bronowski decides to help Lamont when the president of the university refers to the language as &quot;Itascan&quot;, confusing it with Lake Itasca. He resolves to do something that &quot;even &quot;that&quot; knot-head will have to get straight.&quot;

<text>Erich Alfred Hartmann (19 April 1922 – 20 September 1993) was a German fighter pilot during World War II and the most successful fighter ace in the history of aerial warfare. He flew 1,404 combat missions and participated in aerial combat on 825 separate occasions. He was credited with shooting down a total of 352 Allied aircraft: 345 Soviet and 7 American while serving with the Luftwaffe. During his career, Hartmann was forced to crash-land his fighter 16 times after either mechanical failure or damage received from parts of enemy aircraft he had shot down; he was never shot down by direct enemy action.

Hartmann, a pre-war glider pilot, joined the Luftwaffe in 1940 and completed his fighter pilot training in 1942. He was posted to the veteran &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 52 (JG 52—52nd Fighter Wing) on the Eastern Front and placed under the supervision of some of the Luftwaffe″s most experienced fighter pilots. Under their guidance, Hartmann steadily developed his tactics.

On 29 October 1943, Hartmann was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross for destroying 148 enemy aircraft and the Oak Leaves to the Knight&#x27;s Cross for destroying 202 enemy aircraft on 2 March 1944. Exactly four months later, he received the Swords to the Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oak Leaves for shooting down 268 enemy aircraft. Ultimately, Hartmann earned the coveted Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds on 25 August 1944 for 301 aerial victories. At the time of its presentation to Hartmann, this was Germany&#x27;s highest military decoration.

Hartmann achieved his 352nd and last aerial victory at midday on 8 May 1945, hours before the German surrender. Along with the remainder of JG 52, he surrendered to United States Army forces and was turned over to the Red Army. In an attempt to pressure him into service with the Soviet-aligned East German National People&#x27;s Army, he was tried on war crimes charges and convicted. Hartmann was initially sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment, later increased to 25 years, and spent 10 years in Soviet prison camps and gulags until he was released in 1955. In 1997, the Russian Federation posthumously cleared him of all charges.

In 1956, Hartmann joined the newly established West German Air Force in the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, and became the first &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot; of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 71 &quot;Richthofen&quot;. He was forced into retirement in 1970 for his opposition to the procurement of the F-104 Starfighter over safety concerns. In his later years, after his military career had ended, he became a civilian flight instructor. Hartmann died on 20 September 1993 at age 71.

==Early life and career==
Erich Hartmann was born on 19 April 1922 in Weissach, Württemberg, to Doctor Alfred Erich Hartmann and his wife, Elisabeth Wilhelmine Machtholf. The economic depression that followed World War I in Germany prompted Doctor Hartmann to find work in China, and Erich spent his early childhood there. The family was forced to return to Germany in 1928, when the Chinese Civil War broke out. During World War II, Hartmann&#x27;s younger brother, Alfred, also joined the Luftwaffe, serving as a gunner on a Junkers Ju 87 in North Africa. Alfred Hartmann was captured by the British and spent four years as a prisoner of war.

Hartmann was educated at the &quot;Volksschule&quot; in Weil im Schönbuch (April 1928 – April 1932), the Gymnasium in Böblingen (April 1932 – April 1936), the National Political Institutes of Education (Nazi Secondary Education School) in Rottweil (April 1936 – April 1937), and the Gymnasium in Korntal (April 1937 – April 1940), from which he received his Abitur. It was at Korntal that he met his wife-to-be, Ursula &quot;Usch&quot; Paetsch.

Hartmann&#x27;s flying career began when he joined the glider training program of the fledgling Luftwaffe and was taught to fly by his mother, one of the first female glider pilots in Germany. The Hartmanns also owned a light aircraft but were forced to sell it in 1932 as the German economy collapsed. The rise to power of the Nazi Party in 1933 resulted in government support for gliding, and, in 1936, Elisabeth Hartmann established the glider club in Weil im Schönbuch for locals and served as instructor. The 14-year-old Hartmann became a gliding instructor in the Hitler Youth. In 1937, he gained his pilot&#x27;s license, allowing him to fly powered aircraft.

Hartmann began his military training on 1 October 1940 at the 10th Flying Regiment in Neukuhren. On 1 March 1941, he progressed to the &quot;Luftkriegsschule&quot; 2 (Air War School 2) in Berlin-Gatow, making his first flight with an instructor four days later, followed in just under three weeks by his first solo flight. He completed his basic flying training in October 1941 and began advanced flight training at pre-fighter school 2 in Lachen-Speyerdorf on 1 November 1941. There, Hartmann learned combat techniques and gunnery skills. His advanced pilot training was completed on 31 January 1942, and, between 1 March 1942 and 20 August 1942, he learned to fly the Messerschmitt Bf 109 at the &quot;Jagdfliegerschule&quot; 2 (Fighter Pilot School 2).

Hartmann&#x27;s time as a trainee pilot did not always go smoothly. On 31 March 1942, during a gunnery training flight, he ignored regulations and performed some aerobatics in his Bf 109 over the Zerbst airfield. His punishment was a week of confinement to quarters with the loss of two-thirds of his pay in fines. Hartmann later recalled that the incident saved his life:

That week confined to my room actually saved my life. I had been scheduled to go up on a gunnery flight the afternoon that I was confined. My roommate took the flight instead of me, in an aircraft I had been scheduled to fly. Shortly after he took off, while on his way to the gunnery range, he developed engine trouble and had to crash-land near the Hindenburg-Kattowitz railroad. He was killed in the crash.

Afterward, Hartmann practised diligently and adopted a new credo which he passed on to other young pilots: &quot;Fly with your head, not with your muscles.&quot; During a gunnery practice session in June 1942, he hit a target drogue with 24 of the allotted 50 rounds of machine-gun fire, a feat that was considered difficult to achieve. His training had qualified him to fly 17 different types of powered aircraft, and, following his graduation, he was posted on 21 August 1942 to &quot;Ergänzungs-Jagdgruppe Ost&quot; (Supplementary Fighter Group, East) in Kraków, where he remained until 10 October 1942.

==World War II==
In October 1942, Hartmann was assigned to fighter wing &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 52 (JG 52—52nd Fighter Wing), based at Maykop on the Eastern Front in the Soviet Union. The wing was equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 109G, but Hartmann and several other pilots were initially given the task of ferrying Junkers Ju 87 Stukas down to Mariupol. His first flight ended with brake failure, causing the Stuka to crash into and destroy the controller&#x27;s hut. Hartmann was assigned to III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of JG 52, led by &quot;Gruppenkommandeur&quot; (group commander) Major Hubertus von Bonin, and placed under the experienced &quot;Oberfeldwebel&quot; Edmund &quot;Paule&quot; Roßmann, although he also flew with such experienced pilots as Alfred Grislawski, Hans Dammers and Josef Zwernemann. After a few days of intensive mock combats and practice flights, Grislawski conceded that, although Hartmann had much to learn regarding combat tactics, he was a talented pilot.

Hartmann was placed as wingman to Paule Roßmann, who acted as his teacher, and one of the factors that enabled Hartmann&#x27;s success. Grislawski also gave Hartmann pointers on where to aim. Hartmann eventually adopted the tactic &quot;See – Decide – Attack – Break&quot;. The tactics were learned from Roßmann who had been injured in one arm and was not able to fly in physically demanding dogfights. Roßmann&#x27;s solution was to &quot;stand off&quot;, evaluate the situation, then select a target that was not taking evasive action and destroy it at close range.

===Early aerial combat===
On 19 September 1942, III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; had relocated to an airfield named Soldatskaja, located approximately halfway between Mozdok and Pyatigorsk. The &quot;Gruppe&quot; stayed at this airfield until 1 January 1943. During this period, the pilots occasionally also operated from airfields at Mozdok (15, 18, 19, 21, 22 and 23 October) and from Digora (5 to 17 November 1942), supporting Army Group A in the Battle of the Caucasus.

Hartmann flew his first combat mission on 14 October 1942 as Roßmann&#x27;s wingman. When they encountered 10 enemy aircraft below, an impatient Hartmann opened full throttle and separated from Roßmann. He engaged an enemy fighter, but failed to score any hits and nearly collided with it. He then ran for cover in low cloud, and his mission subsequently ended with a crash landing after his aircraft ran out of fuel. Hartmann had violated almost every rule of air-to-air combat, and von Bonin sentenced him to three days of working with the ground crew. According to Günther Rall, who later became Hartmann&#x27;s &quot;Gruppenkommandeur&quot;, Roßmann refused to fly with Hartmann again following this incident. Hartmann was then paired up with Grislawski as his wingman. Twenty-two days later, Hartmann claimed his first victory, an Ilyushin Il-2 &quot;Sturmovik&quot; of the 7th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment, but by the end of 1942, he had added only one more victory to his tally. As with many high-claiming aces, it took him some time to establish himself as a consistently successful fighter pilot. On 5 November 1942, debris from an Il-2 damaged his Bf 109 G-2 engine resulting in a forced landing at Digora.

His &quot;Gruppe&quot; was moved to the combat area of the Kuban bridgehead on 1 April 1943 where it was based at an airfield at Taman. Operating from Taman until 2 July, III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; also flew missions from Kerch on 12 May, from Sarabuz and Saky on 14 May, Zürichtal, present-day Solote Pole, a village near the urban settlement Kirovske on 23 May, and Yevpatoria on 25/26 June. Hartmann&#x27;s youthful appearance earned him the nickname &quot;Bubi&quot; (the hypocoristic form of &quot;young boy&quot; in the German language; roughly equivalent to &quot;Kid&quot;), and Walter Krupinski, to whom Hartmann was assigned as wingman, would constantly urge him: &quot;Hey, Bubi, get in closer&quot; or chastise him with &quot;What was that, Bubi?&quot; The danger of this method was evident on 25 May 1943 when he collided with a Soviet fighter instead of shooting it down. Nevertheless, Hartmann steadily improved. In Krupinski&#x27;s absence, from the third week of May to the first week of August, Hartmann&#x27;s number of claims rose from 17 to 60.

In preparation for Operation Citadel, III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; was relocated to the central sector of the eastern Front. The &quot;Gruppe&quot; first moved to Zaporizhzhia and then to Ugrim on 3 July. There, under the command of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4, they supported Army Group South fighting on the southern flank of the salient. On 5 July Hartmann claimed four victories during the large dogfights that took place during the Battle of Kursk. The day ended badly when Hartmann was unable to prevent Krupinski from being shot down and wounded over Ugrim airfield. Hartmann remarked; &quot;the departure of Krupinski was a severe strike against the &quot;Staffel&quot;, and particularly against me.&quot; According to authors Prien, Stemmer, Rodeike and Bock, Krupinski was injured when his aircraft flipped on its back during landing in an attempt to evade other Bf 109s taking off. During Krupinski&#x27;s convalescence, Hartmann served as temporary &quot;Staffelkapitän&quot; (squadron leader) of 7. &quot;Staffel&quot; until 12 August. Hartmann began to score successes regularly in a target rich environment. On 7 July, he for the first time became an &quot;ace-in-a-day&quot;, claiming seven aerial victories that day, three Il-2 ground attack aircraft and four Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov (LaGG) fighters. This figure includes two Il-2s from the 1 ShAK regiment claimed shot down on an early morning mission.

On 8 July, he claimed four aerial victories and three the next day. On the former date, Hartmann claimed two aircraft on each mission he flew. In the first, Soviet records show at least one La-5 was lost. Major Tokarev of the 40 IAP (Fighter Aviation Regiment—) was killed. In the afternoon, a two-man patrol with Rall resulted in two claims, and a third for Rall. A Soviet after-battle analysis mentioned this specific engagement;

&quot;Eight Yak-1s in the Provorot region observed two Me 109s off their flight path. Paying no attention to the enemy aircraft our fighters continued. Seizing a convenient moment, the German fighters attacked our aircraft and shot down three Yak-1s.&quot;

At the start of August 1943, his tally stood at 42, but Hartmann&#x27;s tally had more than doubled by the end. The Red Army began a counteroffensive in the region to contain the German operation and destroy its forces (Operation Kutuzov and Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev). JG 52 was engaged in defensive operations throughout the month. On 1 August 1943, Hartmann again became an &quot;ace-in-a day&quot; by claiming five victories over LaGG fighters. Another four followed on 3 August and five on 4 August. On 5 August, III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; was ordered to an airfield named Kharkov-Rogan, east of Kharkov where they fought against the Soviet Belgorod–Kharkov offensive operation. That day, he again claimed five aircraft destroyed, followed a single on 6 August, and a further five on 7 August. On 8 and 9 August he claimed another four Soviet fighters. Hartmann&#x27;s last claim of the month came on the 20th, when he accounted for an IL-2 for his 90th victory. The next month, on 2 September, he was appointed &quot;Staffelkapitän&quot; of 9./JG 52. He replaced &quot;Leutnant&quot; Berthold Korts in this capacity who had been reported missing in action on 29 August.

In his first year of operational service, Hartmann felt a distinct lack of respect towards Soviet pilots. Most Soviet fighters did not even have effective gunsights and their pilots, some cases in the early weeks, were forced to draw one on the windscreen by hand: &quot;In the early days, incredible as it may seem, there was no reason for you to feel fear if the Russian fighter was behind you. With their hand-painted gunsights they couldn&#x27;t pull the lead properly (deflection shooting) or hit you.&quot; Hartmann also considered the Bell P-39 Airacobra, the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, and the Hawker Hurricane to be inferior to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and Bf 109, although they did provide the Soviets with valuable gunsight technology.

Hartmann said the German pilots themselves still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf 109G-6s made them difficult to start in the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft&#x27;s oil sump would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the first try. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.

===Fighting techniques===

In contrast to Hans-Joachim Marseille, who was a marksman and expert in the art of deflection shooting, Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics, preferring to ambush and fire at close range rather than dogfight.

When the decorated British test pilot Captain Eric Brown asked Hartmann how he had accomplished his total, Hartmann remarked, that along with firing at close range, inadequate Soviet defensive armament and manoeuvre tactics allowed him to claim a victim in every attack.

His preferred method of attack was to hold fire until extremely close ( or less), then unleash a short burst at point-blank range—a technique he learned while flying as wingman of his former commander, Walter Krupinski, who favoured this approach. This technique, as opposed to long-range shooting, allowed him to:
* Reveal his position only at the last possible moment
* Compensate for the low muzzle velocity of the slower-firing 30 mm MK 108 equipping some of the later Bf 109 models (though most of his victories were claimed with Messerschmitts equipped with the high-velocity 20mm MG 151 cannon)
* Place his shots accurately with minimum waste of ammunition
* Prevent the adversary from taking evasive action
Hartmann&#x27;s guidance amplified the need to detect while remaining undetected. His approach was described by himself by the motto: &quot;See–Decide–Attack–Reverse&quot;; observe the enemy, decide how to proceed with the attack, make the attack, and then disengage to re-evaluate the situation. Hartmann&#x27;s instinct was to select an easy target or withdraw and seek a more favourable situation. Once the attack was over, the rule was to vacate the area; survival was paramount. Another attack could be executed if the pilot could re-enter the combat zone with the advantage.

If attacked in-kind Hartmann flew straight and used the rudder [yaw] to point the Bf 109 in a slightly different direction to mislead the attacker in the amount of deflection needed. Hartmann then forced the column into the corner of the cockpit beginning the outside rotation of an oblique loop. It was an emergency measure if ambushed and it saved his life several times.

These tactics inflated Hartmann&#x27;s successes over the summer of 1943. By 7 July he had claimed 21 Soviet aircraft destroyed and by 20 September he had claimed over 100.

===Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross===
The demands on fighter pilots increased after Kursk. In early August Hartmann flew 20 missions totalling 18 hours and 29 minutes in six days. By late August 1943, Hartmann had 90 aerial victories. On 20 August, in combat with Il-2s, his Bf 109 G-6 (&quot;Werknummer&quot; 20485—factory number) was damaged by debris, and he was forced to land behind Soviet lines at 06:20 in the vicinity of Artemivsk. Hartmann&#x27;s &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot;, Dietrich Hrabak, had given orders to Hartmann&#x27;s unit to support the dive bombers of &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot; 2, led by Hans-Ulrich Rudel in a counter-attack. The flight of eight German fighters engaged a mass of Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-5 fighter aircraft. Hartmann claimed two enemy aircraft before his fighter was hit by debris and he was forced to make an emergency landing.

In accordance with regulations, he attempted to recover the precision board clock. As he was doing so, Soviet soldiers approached. Realising that capture was unavoidable, he faked internal injuries. Hartmann&#x27;s acting so convinced the Soviets that they put him on a stretcher and placed him on a truck. When Hartmann&#x27;s Crew Chief, Heinz Mertens, heard what had happened, he took a rifle and went to search for Hartmann. Mertens was another important factor behind Hartmann&#x27;s success, ensuring the aircraft was reliable. Hartmann subsequently escaped, and returned to his unit on 23 August. At least one source suggests the cause of the crash-landing was enemy fire. Lieutenant P. Yevdokimov, flying an IL-2, from the 232 ShAP, may have hit Hartmann. This period was very successful; during five days of August 1943, Hartmann claimed 24 Soviet aircraft in 20 missions.
On 18 September, Hartmann downed two Yaks from the 812 IAP regiment for claims 92 and 93. On 20 September 1943, Hartmann was credited with his 100th aerial victory—he claimed four this day to end it on 101. He was the 54th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark. Nine days later, Hartmann downed the Soviet ace Major Vladimir Semenishin of the 104 GvIAP (Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment—&quot;Gvardeyskiy Istrebitelny Aviatsionny Polk&quot;) while protecting bombers from &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 27 for his 112th victory.

In October 1943, Hartmann claimed another 33 aerial victories. On 2 and 12 October he accounted for four victories and achieved a treble on 14, 15 and 20 October and double claims on 24, 25 and 29 October. On 29 October, he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross (), at which point his tally stood at 148. By the end of the year, this had risen to 159. On 14 November 1943, his Bf 109 G-6 (&quot;Werknummer&quot; 20499) suffered engine failure resulting in a forced landing at Kirovohrad airfield.

On 10 January 1944, III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; moved to an airfield at Novokrasne located approximately south-southwest of Novoukrainka. While based at Novokrasne, elements of the &quot;Gruppe&quot; also operated from Ivanhorod (11 to 13 January), at Velyka Lepetykha (3 to 22 February), and Mykolaiv (2 to 23 February). In the first two months of 1944, Hartmann claimed over 50 Soviet aircraft. On 22 February, he crashed another Bf 109 G-6 on a transfer flight to Uman. The successes included four on 17 January 1944 and on 26 February, a further 10 fighters were claimed shot down; all of them Soviet-flown P-39s to reach 202. His spectacular rate of success raised a few eyebrows even in the Luftwaffe High Command; his claims were double and triple-checked, and his performance closely monitored by an observer flying in his formation.
By this time, the Soviet pilots were familiar with Hartmann&#x27;s radio call sign of &quot;Karaya 1&quot;, and the Soviet Command had put a price of 10,000 rubles on the German pilot&#x27;s head. Hartmann was nicknamed the &quot;Cherniy Chort&quot; (&quot;Black Devil&quot;) because of his skill and paint scheme of his aircraft. This scheme was in the shape of a black tulip on the engine cowling; though this became synonymous with Hartmann in reality he flew with the insignia on only five or six occasions. Hartmann&#x27;s opponents were often reluctant to stay and fight if they noticed his personal design. As a result, this aircraft was often allocated to novices, who could fly it in relative safety. On 21 March, it was Hartmann who claimed JG 52″s 3,500th victory of the war. Adversely, the supposed reluctance of the Soviet airmen to fight caused Hartmann&#x27;s kill rate to drop. Hartmann then had the tulip design removed, and his aircraft painted just like the rest of his unit. Consequently, in the following two months, Hartmann claimed over 50 victories.

In March 1944, Hartmann, Gerhard Barkhorn, Walter Krupinski and Johannes Wiese were summoned to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Berghof&quot; in Berchtesgaden. Barkhorn was to be honoured with the Swords, while Hartmann, Krupinski and Wiese were to receive the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (). According to Hartmann, all four of them got drunk on cognac and champagne. On arrival at Berchtesgarden, Hartmann was reprimanded by Hitler&#x27;s adjutant for intoxication and for handling Hitler&#x27;s hat. Also present at the award ceremony on 4 April were Reinhard Seiler, Kurt Bühligen, Horst Ademeit, Hans-Joachim Jabs, Dr. Maximilian Otte, Bernhard Jope and Hansgeorg Bätcher from the bomber force, and the Flak officer Fritz Petersen, all destined to receive the Oak Leaves.
===Diamonds to the Knight&#x27;s Cross===
In April and May 1944, 9./JG 52 resisted the Soviet Crimean Offensive. In April Hartmann claimed five victories. In May, Hartmann filed claims number 208 to 231 which included six on 6 May. On 8 May 1944, JG 52 fled the region as the German defence collapsed. JG 52 subsequently took part in the fighting on the Romanian border.

III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; relocated to Roman on 18 May. Three days later, Hartmann engaged United States Army Air Forces aircraft in Defense of the Reich for the first time flying in defence of the Ploiești oilfields and engaging North American P-51 Mustang fighters for the first time over Romania. On 24 June, the United States Army Air Forces&#x27; (USAAF) Fifteenth Air Force attacked various targets in Romania with 377 bombers. A fraction of this attack force, consisting of 135 Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers and Lockheed P-38 Lightning and P-51 fighters, headed for the Ploiești oilfields. Defending against this attack, Hartmann claimed a P-51 shot down. Only one other claim against this type was made by Hartmann in 1945.

Later that month, P-51s ran his Messerschmitt out of fuel. During the intense manoeuvring, Hartmann ran out of ammunition. One of the P-51Bs flown by Lt. Robert J. Goebel of the 308th Squadron, 31st Fighter Group, broke away and headed straight for Hartmann while he hung in his parachute. Goebel was making a camera pass to record the bailout and banked away from him only at the last moment, waving at Hartmann as he went by.

On 15 August, III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; moved to Warzyn Pierwszy, Poland. The airfield was located approximately west of Jędrzejów. Two days later, Hartmann became the top scoring fighter ace, surpassing fellow JG 52 pilot Gerhard Barkhorn, with his 274th victory. On 23 August, Hartmann claimed eight victories in three combat missions, an &quot;ace-in-a-day&quot; achievement, bringing his score to 290 victories. He passed the 300-mark on 24 August 1944, a day on which he shot down 11 aircraft in two combat missions south of Radom-Lublin, representing his greatest ever victories-per-day ratio (a &quot;double-ace-in-a-day&quot;) and bringing the number of aerial victories to an unprecedented 301. Every aerial victory filed by a pilot of III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; on 23 and 24 August was claimed by Hartmann, earning him two named reference in the &quot;Wehrmachtbericht&quot; on 24 and 25 August respectively. The authors Prien, Stemmer, Balke and Bock speculate that the entire &quot;Gruppe&quot; may have flown fighter protection for Hartmann to make this achievement possible.

Hartmann became one of only 27 German soldiers in World War II to receive the Diamonds to his Knight&#x27;s Cross. Hartmann was summoned to the &quot;Führerhauptquartier Wolfsschanze&quot;, (the &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Lair&quot;) Adolf Hitler&#x27;s military headquarters near Rastenburg, to receive the coveted award from Hitler personally. Hartmann was asked to surrender his side arm – a security measure heightened by the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt on 20 July 1944. According to one account, Hartmann refused and threatened to decline the Diamonds if he were not trusted to carry his pistol. During Hartmann&#x27;s meeting with Hitler, Hartmann discussed at length the shortcomings of fighter pilot training. Allegedly, Hitler admitted to Hartmann that he believed that, &quot;militarily, the war is lost,&quot; and that he wished the Luftwaffe had &quot;more like him and Rudel.&quot;

The Diamonds to the Knight&#x27;s Cross also earned Hartmann a 10-day leave. On his way to his vacation, he was ordered by &quot;General der Jagdflieger&quot; Adolf Galland to attend a meeting in Berlin-Gatow. Galland wanted to transfer Hartmann to the Messerschmitt Me 262 test program but, at Hartmann&#x27;s request, the transfer was cancelled on the grounds of his professed attachment to JG 52. Hartmann argued to Göring that he best served the war effort on the Eastern Front. On 10 September, Hartmann married his long-time teenage love, Ursula &quot;Usch&quot; Paetsch. Witnesses to the wedding included his friends Gerhard Barkhorn and Wilhelm Batz.

On 25 May, II. &quot;Gruppe&quot; was ordered to transfer one &quot;Staffel&quot; to the west in Defense of the Reich. Barkhorn, the commander of II. &quot;Gruppe&quot;, selected &quot;Leutnant&quot; Hans Waldmann&#x27;s 4. &quot;Staffel&quot; which was officially assigned to the II. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 3 &quot;Udet&quot; (JG 3—3rd Fighter Wing). On 10 August, this squadron officially became the 8. &quot;Staffel&quot; of JG 3. In consequence, Hartmann was transferred on 30 September and tasked with creation and leadership of a new 4. &quot;Staffel&quot; of JG 52. Command of his former 9. &quot;Staffel&quot; was passed on to &quot;Leutnant&quot; Hans-Joachim Birkner. At the time, II. &quot;Gruppe&quot; was based in Nagyrábé, Hungary. Before flying further combat missions, Hartmann had to train the new inexperienced pilots. He led this squadron until 16 January 1945 when he was given command of I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of JG 52, thus succeeding &quot;Major&quot; Barkhorn in this capacity. Hartmann transferred command of 4. &quot;Staffel&quot; to &quot;Leutnant&quot; Friedrich Haas.

===Last combat missions===
On 31 January 1945, Hartmann transferred command of I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of JG 52 to &quot;Major&quot; Batz. From 1–14 February, he then briefly led I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 53 (JG 53—53rd Fighter Wing) as acting &quot;Gruppenkommandeur&quot; until he was replaced by &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Helmut Lipfert, substituting for &quot;Major&quot; Jürgen Harder who had been transferred. At the time, the &quot;Gruppe&quot; was based in Veszprém and was fighting in the siege of Budapest. He claimed his only aerial victory with JG 53 on 4 February when he shot down a Yak-9 fighter. In March 1945, Hartmann, his score now standing at 337 aerial victories, was asked a second time by General Adolf Galland to join the Me 262 units forming to fly the new jet fighter.

Hartmann attended the jet conversion program led by Heinrich Bär. Galland also intended Hartmann to fly with &quot;Jagdverband&quot; 44. Hartmann declined the offer, preferring to remain with JG 52. Some sources report that Hartmann&#x27;s decision to stay with his unit was due to a request via telegram made by &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; Hermann Graf.

On 1 February, Hartmann was appointed &quot;Gruppenkommandeur&quot; of I./JG 52, succeeding &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Adolf Borchers. Hartmann claimed his 350th aerial victory on 17 April, in the vicinity of Chrudim. The last wartime photograph of Hartmann known was taken in connection with this victory. Hartmann&#x27;s last aerial victory occurred over Brno, Czechoslovakia, on 8 May, the last day of the war in Europe. Early that morning, he was ordered to fly a reconnaissance mission and report the position of Soviet forces. Hartmann took off with his wingman at 08:30 and spotted the first Soviet units just away. Passing over the area, Hartmann saw a Yak-9, ambushed it from his vantage point at and shot it down.

When he landed, Hartmann learned that the Soviet forces were within artillery range of the airfield, so JG 52 destroyed &quot;Karaya One&quot;, 24 other Bf 109s, and large quantities of ammunition. Hartmann and Hermann Graf were ordered to fly to the British sector to avoid capture by Soviet forces while the remainder of JG 52 was ordered to surrender to the approaching Soviets. As &quot;Gruppenkommandeur&quot; of I./JG 52, Hartmann chose to surrender his unit to members of the US 90th Infantry Division.

==Prisoner of war==
After his capture, the U.S. Army handed Hartmann, his pilots, and ground crew over to the Soviet Union on 14 May, where he was imprisoned in accordance with the Yalta Agreements, which stated that airmen and soldiers fighting Soviet forces had to surrender directly to them. Hartmann and his unit were led by the Americans to a large open-air compound to await the transfer.

In Hartmann&#x27;s account, the Soviets attempted to convince him to cooperate with them. He was asked to spy on fellow officers, but refused and was given ten days&#x27; solitary confinement in a chamber. He slept on a concrete floor and was given only bread and water. On another occasion, according to Hartmann, the Soviets threatened to kidnap and murder his wife (the death of his son was kept from Hartmann). During similar interrogations about the Me 262, Hartmann was struck by a Soviet officer using a cane, prompting Hartmann to hit the assailant with a chair, knocking him out. Expecting to be shot, he was transferred back to the small bunker.

Hartmann, not ashamed of his war service, opted to go on a hunger strike and starve rather than fold to &quot;Soviet will&quot;, as he called it. The Soviets allowed the hunger strike to go on for four days before force-feeding him. More subtle efforts by the Soviet authorities to convert Hartmann to communism also failed. He was offered a post in the East German Air Force, which he refused:

If, after I am home in the West, you make me a normal contract offer, a business deal such as people sign every day all over the world, and I like your offer, then I will come back and work with you in accordance with the contract. But if you try to put me to work under coercion of any kind, then I will resist to my dying gasp.

===War crimes charges===
During captivity, Hartmann was first arrested on 24 December 1949, and three days later, sentenced to 20 years in prison. The sentence was carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Ivanovo district. The preliminary criminal investigation was carried out only formally. He was condemned for atrocities against Soviet citizens, the attack on military objects and destruction of Soviet aircraft and therefore significant damage to the Soviet economy. Hartmann protested multiple times against this judgment. In June 1951, he was charged for a second time as an alleged member of an anti-Soviet group. 
The second trial was carried out under military authority in the military district of Rostov-on-Don. Hartmann was charged with war crimes, specifically the &quot;deliberate shooting of 780 Soviet civilians&quot; in the village of Briansk, attacking a bread factory on 23 May 1943, and destroying 345 &quot;expensive&quot; Soviet aircraft. He refused to confess to these charges and conducted his own defence, which was, according to Hartmann, denounced by the presiding judge as a &quot;waste of time&quot;.
Sentenced to 25 years of hard labour, Hartmann refused to work, and was put into solitary confinement, which led to a riot by some of his fellow detainees, who overpowered the guards and temporarily freed him. He made a complaint to the &quot;Kommandant&quot;″s office, asking for a representative from Moscow and an international inspection, as well as a new trial hearing to overturn his sentence. This was refused, and he was transferred to a camp in Novocherkassk, where he spent five more months in solitary confinement. He was later put before a new tribunal, which upheld the original sentence. He was subsequently sent to another camp, this time at Diaterka in the Ural Mountains. In late 1955, Hartmann was released as a part of the last &quot;Heimkehrer&quot;.

In January 1997, over three years after his death, Hartmann&#x27;s case was reviewed by the Chief Military Prosecutor in Moscow, Russia, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and he was acquitted of all historical charges against him in Russian law. The government agency stated that he had been wrongly convicted.

==Post-war years==
During his long imprisonment, Hartmann&#x27;s son, Erich-Peter, was born in 1945 and died as a three-year-old in 1948, without his father ever having seen him. Hartmann later had a daughter, Ursula Isabel, born on 23 February 1957. When Hartmann returned to West Germany, he reentered military service in the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; and became an officer in the West German Air Force, where he commanded West Germany&#x27;s first all-jet unit from 6 June 1959 to 29 May 1962, &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 71 &quot;Richthofen&quot;. This unit was initially equipped with Canadair Sabres and later with Lockheed F-104 Starfighters.

Hartmann also made several trips to the United States, where he trained on U.S. Air Force equipment. In 1957, Hartmann began training with American instructors. He and other German pilots were trained at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. The Republic F-84 Thunderjet fighter course lasted 60 days and consisted of 33 hours of flight time in the Lockheed T-33 and 47
hours in the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak. Hartmann and the former Luftwaffe pilots needed only familiarisation training.
Hartmann considered the F-104 a fundamentally flawed and unsafe aircraft and strongly opposed its adoption by the German air force. Already in 1957, Hartmann had recommended to Kammhuber to first buy and evaluate a few new and unfamiliar aircraft before committing the air force to a new aircraft type. Although events subsequently validated his low opinion of the aircraft (269 crashes and 116 German pilots killed on the F-104 in non-combat missions, along with allegations of bribes culminating in the Lockheed scandal), Hartmann&#x27;s outspoken criticism proved unpopular with his superiors, and he was forced into early retirement in 1970. From 1971 to 1974, Hartmann worked as a flight instructor in Hangelar, near Bonn, and also flew in fly-ins with other wartime pilots.

Hartmann died on 20 September 1993, at the age of 71 in Weil im Schönbuch. In 2016, Hartmann&#x27;s former air force unit, JG 71, honoured him by applying his tulip colour scheme to their aircraft.

==Legacy and in popular culture==
Hartmann was the subject of a biography by the American authors Trevor J. Constable and Raymond F. Toliver, under the title &quot;The Blond Knight of Germany&quot;. Originally released in the United States in 1970, it was published in Germany the next year, as &quot;Holt Hartmann vom Himmel!&quot; (&quot;Shoot Hartmann down!&quot;).
&quot;The Blond Knight&quot; was a commercial success and enjoyed a wide readership among both the American and the German public. The book has been criticised by some as ahistorical and misleading in recent American and German historiography. Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies, in their work &quot;The Myth of the Eastern Front&quot;, describe it as one of the key works that promoted the Myth of the clean Wehrmacht.

Historian Jens Wehner notes that the German-language version of the book was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in its presentation of historical realities. These included uncritical borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the &quot;Fliegerasse&quot; (&quot;aces&quot;) and stereotypes about the Soviet Union. According to Wehner, the latter could be traced to prevailing attitudes during the Cold War. Furthermore, the political and social consequences of World War II were completely ignored.

==Summary of career==

===Aerial victory claims===

According to US historian David T. Zabecki, Hartmann was credited with 352 aerial victories. Spick also lists Hartmann with 352 aerial victories claimed in 1,425 combat missions, all of which on the Eastern Front. Mathews and Foreman, authors of &quot;Luftwaffe Aces – Biographies and Victory Claims&quot;, researched the German Federal Archives and found records for 352 aerial victory claims, plus two further unconfirmed claims. This number includes two claims over United States Army Air Forces flown P-51 Mustangs, and 350 Soviet Air Forces piloted aircraft on the Eastern Front. 

Owing to the loss of Erich Hartmann&#x27;s second logbook, the original biographers Trevor Constable and Raymond Toliver compiled Hartmann&#x27;s late-war claims from questionable sources. The Luftwaffe microfilm claims listings were not yet consulted resulting in a very unreliable late-war claims listing. As one example, the biographers Constable and Toliver state that Hartmann claimed a Soviet La-5 fighter on 21 November 1944. Research has shown that Hartmann&#x27;s unit did not even fly this day due to very poor weather conditions, moreover the Soviet 5th Air Army did not lose any aircraft. According to the authors Daniel and Gabor Horvath, comparison to Soviet enemy loss reports showed that the number of aircraft destroyed by Hartmann may actually be much lower than the 352 he claimed, regardless of enemy nationality.

Hartmann had kept the whereabouts of his Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross secret from his captors during his time as a prisoner of war, claiming that he had thrown it away. The hiding place was in a small stream. His comrade Hans &quot;Assi&quot; Hahn managed to hide the Knight&#x27;s Cross in a double bottom cigar box and smuggled it back to Germany when he was released from captivity.

===Dates of rank===
Hartmann joined the military service in &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; on 1 October 1940. His first station was Neukuhren in East Prussia, where he received his military basic training as a Luftwaffe recruit.

<text>Grand Central Terminal (GCT; also referred to as Grand Central Station or simply as Grand Central) is a commuter rail terminal located at 42nd Street and Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Grand Central is the southern terminus of the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem, Hudson and New Haven Lines, serving the northern parts of the New York metropolitan area. It also contains a connection to the Long Island Rail Road through the Grand Central Madison station, a rail terminal underneath the Metro-North station, built from 2007 to 2023. The terminal also connects to the New York City Subway at Grand Central–42nd Street station. The terminal is the third-busiest train station in North America, after New York Penn Station and Toronto Union Station.

The distinctive architecture and interior design of Grand Central Terminal&#x27;s station house have earned it several landmark designations, including as a National Historic Landmark. Its Beaux-Arts design incorporates numerous works of art. Grand Central Terminal is one of the world&#x27;s ten most-visited tourist attractions, with 21.6 million visitors in 2018, excluding train and subway passengers. The terminal&#x27;s Main Concourse is often used as a meeting place, and is especially featured in films and television. Grand Central Terminal contains a variety of stores and food vendors, including upscale restaurants and bars, a food hall, and a grocery marketplace. The building is also noted for its library, event hall, tennis club, control center and offices for the railroad, and sub-basement power station.

Grand Central Terminal was built by and named for the New York Central Railroad; it also served the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and, later, successors to the New York Central. Opened in 1913, the terminal was built on the site of two similarly named predecessor stations, the first of which dated to 1871. Grand Central Terminal served intercity trains until 1991, when Amtrak consolidated its New York operations at nearby Penn Station.

Grand Central covers and has 44 platforms, more than any other railroad station in the world. Its platforms, all below ground, serve 30 tracks on the upper level and 26 on the lower. In total, there are 67 tracks, including a rail yard and sidings; of these, 43 tracks are in use for passenger service, while the remaining two dozen are used to store trains.

== Name ==
Grand Central Terminal was named by and for the New York Central Railroad, which built the station and its two predecessors on the site. It has &quot;always been more colloquially and affectionately known as Grand Central Station&quot;, the name of its immediate predecessor that operated from 1900 to 1910. The name &quot;Grand Central Station&quot; is also shared with the nearby U.S. Post Office station at 450 Lexington Avenue and, colloquially, with the Grand Central–42nd Street subway station next to the terminal.

The station has been named &quot;Grand Central Terminal&quot; since before its completion in 1913; the full title is inscribed on its 42nd Street facade. According to 21st-century sources, it is designated a &quot;terminal&quot; because trains originate and terminate there. The CSX Corporation Railroad Dictionary also considers &quot;terminals&quot; as facilities &quot;for the breaking up, making up, forwarding, and servicing of trains&quot; or &quot;where one or more rail yards exist&quot;.

== Services ==
=== Commuter rail ===
Grand Central Terminal serves some 67 million passengers a year, more than any other Metro-North station. During morning rush hour, a train arrives at the terminal every 58 seconds.

Three of Metro-North&#x27;s five main lines terminate at Grand Central:

Through these lines, the terminal serves Metro-North commuters traveling to and from the Bronx in New York City; Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess counties in New York; and Fairfield and New Haven counties in Connecticut.

=== Connecting services ===
==== Long Island Rail Road ====
The MTA&#x27;s Long Island Rail Road operates commuter trains to the Grand Central Madison station beneath Grand Central, completed in 2023 in the East Side Access project. The project connects the terminal to all of the railroad&#x27;s branches via its Main Line, linking Grand Central Madison to almost every LIRR station. Partial service to Jamaica began on January 25, 2023.

====Local services====
The New York City Subway&#x27;s adjacent Grand Central–42nd Street station serves the following routes:

These MTA Regional Bus Operations buses stop near Grand Central:

=== Former services ===
The terminal and its predecessors were designed for intercity service, which operated from the first station building&#x27;s completion in 1871 until Amtrak ceased operations in the terminal in 1991. Through transfers, passengers could connect to all major lines in the United States, including the &quot;Canadian&quot;, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot;, the &quot;San Francisco Zephyr&quot;, the &quot;Southwest Limited&quot;, the &quot;Crescent&quot;, and the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; under Amtrak. Destinations included San Francisco, Los Angeles, Vancouver, New Orleans, Chicago, and Montreal. Another notable former train was New York Central&#x27;s &quot;20th Century Limited&quot;, a luxury service that operated to Chicago&#x27;s LaSalle Street Station between 1902 and 1967 and was among the most famous trains of its time.

From 1971 to 1991, all Amtrak trains using the intrastate Empire Corridor to Niagara Falls terminated at Grand Central; interstate Northeast Corridor trains used Penn Station. Notable Amtrak services at Grand Central included the &quot;Lake Shore&quot;, &quot;Empire Service&quot;, &quot;Adirondack&quot;, &quot;Niagara Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;, and &quot;Empire State Express&quot;.

Grand Central Terminal was designed and built with two main levels for passengers: an upper for intercity trains and a lower for commuter trains. This configuration, devised by New York Central vice president William J. Wilgus, separated intercity and commuter-rail passengers, smoothing the flow of people in and through the station.
The original plan for Grand Central&#x27;s interior was designed by Reed and Stem, with some work by Whitney Warren of Warren and Wetmore.

=== Main Concourse ===
The Main Concourse is located on the upper platform level of Grand Central, in the geographical center of the station building. The concourse leads directly to most of the terminal&#x27;s upper-level tracks, although some are accessed from passageways near the concourse. The Main Concourse is usually filled with bustling crowds and is often used as a meeting place. At the center of the concourse is an information booth topped with a four-sided brass clock, one of Grand Central&#x27;s most recognizable icons. The terminal&#x27;s main departure boards are located at the south end of the space. The boards have been replaced numerous times since their initial installation in 1967.

=== Passageways and ramps ===
In their design for the station&#x27;s interior, Reed &amp; Stem created a circulation system that allowed passengers alighting from trains to enter the Main Concourse, then leave through various passages that branch from it. Among these are the north–south 42nd Street Passage and Shuttle Passage, which run south to 42nd Street; and three east–west passageways—the Grand Central Market, the Graybar Passage, and the Lexington Passage—that run about east to Lexington Avenue by 43rd Street. Several passages run north of the terminal, including the north–south 45th Street Passage, which leads to 45th Street and Madison Avenue, and the network of tunnels in Grand Central North, which lead to exits at every street from 45th to 48th Street.

Each of the east–west passageways runs through a different building. The northernmost is the Graybar Passage, built on the first floor of the Graybar Building in 1926. Its walls and seven large transverse arches are made of coursed ashlar travertine, and the floor is terrazzo. The ceiling is composed of seven groin vaults, each of which has an ornamental bronze chandelier. The first two vaults, as viewed from leaving Grand Central, are painted with cumulus clouds, while the third contains a 1927 mural by Edward Trumbull depicting American transportation.

The middle passageway houses Grand Central Market, a cluster of food shops. The site was originally a segment of 43rd Street which became the terminal&#x27;s first service dock in 1913. In 1975, a Greenwich Savings Bank branch was built in the space, which was converted into the marketplace in 1998, and involved installing a new limestone façade on the building. The building&#x27;s second story, whose balcony overlooks the market and 43rd Street, was to house a restaurant, but is instead used for storage.

The southernmost of the three, the Lexington Passage, was originally known as the Commodore Passage after the Commodore Hotel, which it ran through. When the hotel was renamed the Grand Hyatt, the passage was likewise renamed. The passage acquired its current name during the terminal&#x27;s renovation in the 1990s.

The Shuttle Passage, on the west side of the terminal, connects the Main Concourse to Grand Central&#x27;s subway station. The terminal was originally configured with two parallel passages, later simplified into one wide passageway.
Ramps include the Vanderbilt Avenue ramp and the Oyster Bar ramps. The Vanderbilt Avenue or Kitty Kelly ramp leads from the corner of Vanderbilt Avenue and 42nd Street down into the Shuttle Passage. Most of the space above the ramp was built upon in the 20th century, becoming the Kitty Kelly women&#x27;s shoe store, and later operating as Federal Express. The ramp was returned to its original two-story volume during the terminal&#x27;s 1998 restoration.

The Oyster Bar ramps lead down from the Main Concourse to the Oyster Bar and Dining Concourse. They span a total of from east to west under an ceiling. A pedestrian bridge passes over the ramps, connecting Vanderbilt Hall and the Main Concourse. In 1927, the ramps were partially covered over by expanded main-floor ticket offices; these were removed in the 1998 renovation, which restored the ramps&#x27; original appearance with one minor change: the bridge now has a low balustrade, replacing an eight-foot-high solid wall that blocked views between the two levels. The underside of the bridge is covered with Guastavino tiling. The bridge&#x27;s arches create a whispering gallery in the landing beneath it: a person standing in one corner can hear another speaking softly in the diagonally opposite corner.

==== Grand Central North ====

Grand Central North is a network of four tunnels that allow people to walk between the station building (which sits between 42nd and 44th Street) and exits at 45th, 46th, 47th, and 48th Street. The Northwest Passage and Northeast Passage run parallel to the tracks on the upper level, while two shorter cross-passages run perpendicular to the tracks. The 47th Street cross-passage runs between the upper and lower tracks, below street level; it provides access to upper-level tracks. The 45th Street cross-passage runs under the lower tracks, below street level. Converted from a corridor built to transport luggage and mail, it provides access to lower-level tracks. The cross-passages are connected to the platforms via 37 stairs, six elevators, and five escalators.
The tunnels&#x27; street-level entrances, each enclosed by a freestanding glass structure, sit at the northeast corner of East 47th Street and Madison Avenue (Northwest Passage), the northeast corner of East 48th Street and Park Avenue (Northeast Passage), in the two pedestrian walkways underneath the Helmsley Building between 45th and 46th streets, and (since 2012) on the south side of 47th Street between Park and Lexington avenues. Pedestrians can also take an elevator to the 47th Street passage from the north side of East 47th Street, between Madison and Vanderbilt avenues; this entrance adjoined the former 270 Park Avenue.

Proposals for these tunnels had been discussed since at least the 1970s. The MTA approved preliminary plans in 1983, gave final approval in 1991, and began construction in 1994. Dubbed the North End Access Project, the work was to be completed in 1997 at a cost of $64.5 million, but it was slowed by the incomplete nature of the building&#x27;s original blueprints and by previously undiscovered groundwater beneath East 45th Street. During construction, MTA Arts &amp; Design mosaics were installed; each work was part of &quot;As Above, So Below&quot;, by Brooklyn artist Ellen Driscoll. The passageways opened on August 18, 1999, at a final cost of $75 million.

In spring 2000, construction began on a project to enclose the Northeast and Northwest passages with ceilings and walls. Work on each passage was expected to take 7.5 months, with the entire project wrapping up by summer 2001. As part of the project, the walls of the passages were covered with glazed terrazzo; the Northeast Passage&#x27;s walls have blue-green accents while the Northwest Passage&#x27;s walls have red ones. The ceilings are high; the cross-passages&#x27; ceilings are blue-green, the same color as the Main Concourse, and have recessed lights arranged to resemble the Main Concourse&#x27;s constellations. The passages were to be heated in winter and ventilated. Originally, Grand Central North had no restrooms or air-conditioning.

The entrances to Grand Central North were originally open from 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. During weekends and holidays, the 47th and 48th Street entrances were open from 9:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., while the two entrances to the Helmsley Building were closed. Five years after they opened, the passageways were used by about 30,000 people on a typical weekday. But they served only about 6,000 people on a typical weekend, so the MTA proposed to close them on weekends to save money as part of the 2005–2008 Financial Plan. Since summer 2006, Grand Central North has been closed on weekends.

As a precaution during the COVID-19 pandemic, Grand Central North closed on March 26, 2020. It reopened in September of that year with hours from 6:30 to 10 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m. In 2021, its original hours were restored. On November 1, 2021, the entrance to the northeastern corner of Madison Avenue and 47th Street was &quot;closed long-term to accommodate the construction of 270 Park Avenue&quot;. After Grand Central Madison begins full service, Grand Central North will be open from 5:30 a.m. until 2 a.m., seven days a week.

=== Other spaces on the main floor ===
====Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Foyer====
The main entrance into the terminal, underneath the Park Avenue Viaduct, opens into the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Foyer. The room is a short passage with a sloped floor and arched shop windows along its side walls. It is adorned with glass and bronze chandeliers, a classical cornice, and a decorative tympanum above the doors leading to Vanderbilt Hall. The tympanum has sculpted bronze garlands and a caduceus below an inscripted panel that reads: &quot;To all those with head, heart, and handToiled in the construction of this monument to the public serviceThis is inscribed.&quot; Above the panel is a clock framed by a pair of carved cornucopias. In 2014, the foyer was named for Onassis, former First Lady of the United States, who in the 1970s helped ward off the demolition of the Main Concourse and the construction of Grand Central Tower.

==== Vanderbilt Hall ====
Vanderbilt Hall is an event space on the south side of the terminal, between the main entrance and the Main Concourse to its north. The rectangular room measures . The north and south walls are divided into five bays, each with large rectangular windows, screened with heavy bronze grills. The room is lit by Beaux-Arts chandeliers, each with 132 bulbs on four tiers. Vanderbilt Hall was formerly the main waiting room for the terminal, used particularly by intercity travelers. The space featured double-sided oak benches and could seat 700 people. As long-distance passenger service waned, the space became favored by the homeless, who began regularly living there in the 1980s. In 1989, the room was boarded up in preparation for its restoration in 1991. During the process, a temporary waiting room was established on an upper level of the terminal.

Around 1998, the renovated hall was renamed in honor of the Vanderbilt family, which built and owned the station. It is used for the annual Christmas Market, as well as for special exhibitions and private events. From 2016 to 2020, the west half of the hall held the Great Northern Food Hall, an upscale Nordic-themed food court with five pavilions. The food hall was the first long-term tenant of the space; the terminal&#x27;s landmark status prevents permanent installations.

Since 1999, Vanderbilt Hall has hosted the annual Tournament of Champions squash championship. Each January, tournament officials construct a free-standing glass-enclosed squash court. Like a theatre in the round, spectators sit on three sides of the court.

A men&#x27;s smoking room and women&#x27;s waiting room were formerly located on the west and east sides of Vanderbilt Hall, respectively. In 2016, the men&#x27;s room was renovated into Agern, an 85-seat Nordic-themed fine dining and Michelin-starred restaurant operated by Noma co-founder Claus Meyer, who also ran the food hall. Both venues permanently closed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. City Winery signed a lease for both the food hall and the Agern space in 2022. The firm opened a wine bar, a quick-service restaurant named City Jams, and a farm-to-table restaurant named Cornelius in these spaces that November.

==== Biltmore Room ====

The Biltmore Room, originally known simply as the incoming train room, is a marble hall that serves as an entrance to tracks 39 through 42, and connects to Grand Central Madison. The hall is northwest of the Main Concourse and directly beneath 22 Vanderbilt, the former Biltmore Hotel building. The room was completed in 1915 as a waiting room for intercity trains, which led to its colloquial name of the &quot;Kissing Room&quot;, in reference to the greetings that would take place there.

As the station&#x27;s passenger traffic declined in mid-century, the room fell into neglect. In 1982 and 1983, the room was damaged during the construction that converted the Biltmore Hotel into the Bank of America Plaza. In 1985, Giorgio Cavaglieri was hired to restore the room, which at the time had cracked marble and makeshift lighting. During that era, a series of lockers was still located within the Biltmore Room. Later, the room held a newsstand, flower stand, and shoe shine booths. In 2015, the MTA awarded a contract to refurbish the Biltmore Room into an arrival area for Long Island Rail Road passengers as part of the East Side Access project. As part of the project, the room&#x27;s booths and stands were replaced by a pair of escalators and an elevator to Grand Central Madison&#x27;s deep-level concourse, which opened in May 2023.

The room&#x27;s blackboard displayed the arrival and departure times of New York Central trains until 1967, when a mechanical board was installed in the Main Concourse.

==== Station Master&#x27;s Office ====

The Station Master&#x27;s Office, located near Track 36, has Grand Central&#x27;s only dedicated waiting room. The space has benches, restrooms, and a floral mixed-media mural on three of its walls. The room&#x27;s benches were previously located in the former waiting room, now known as Vanderbilt Hall. Since 2008, the area has offered free Wi-Fi.

==== Former theatre ====

One of the retail areas of the Graybar Passage, currently occupied by wine-and-liquor store Central Cellars, was formerly the Grand Central Theatre or Terminal Newsreel Theatre. Opened in 1937 with 25-cent admission, the theater showed short films, cartoons, and newsreels from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Designed by Tony Sarg, it had 242 stadium-style seats and a standing-room section with armchairs. A small bar sat near the entrance. The theater&#x27;s interior had simple pine walls spaced out to eliminate echos, along with an inglenook, a fireplace, and an illuminated clock for the convenience of travelers. The walls of the lobby, dubbed the &quot;appointment lounge&quot;, were covered with world maps; the ceiling had an astronomical mural painted by Sarg. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported a cost of $125,000 for the theater&#x27;s construction, which was attributed to construction of an elevator between the theater and the suburban concourse as well as air conditioning and apparatuses for people hard of hearing.

The theater stopped showing newsreels by 1968 but continued operating until around 1979, when it was gutted for retail space. A renovation in the early 2000s removed a false ceiling, revealing the theater&#x27;s projection window and its astronomical mural, which proved similar in colors and style to the Main Concourse ceiling.

=== Dining Concourse ===

Access to the lower-level tracks is provided by the Dining Concourse, located below the Main Concourse and connected to it by numerous stairs, ramps, and escalators. For decades, it was called the Suburban Concourse because it handled commuter rail trains. Today, it has central seating and lounge areas, surrounded by restaurants and food vendors. The shared public seating in the concourse was designed resembling Pullman traincars. These areas are frequented by the homeless, and as a result, in the mid-2010s the MTA created two areas with private seating for dining customers.

The terminal&#x27;s late-1990s renovation added stands and restaurants to the concourse, and installed escalators to link it to the main concourse level. The MTA also spent $2.2 million to install two circular terrazzo designs by David Rockwell and Beyer Blinder Belle, each 45 feet in diameter, over the concourse&#x27;s original terrazzo floor. Since 2015, part of the Dining Concourse has been closed for the construction of stairways and escalators to the new LIRR terminal being built as part of East Side Access.

A small square-framed clock is installed in the ceiling near Tracks 108 and 109. It was manufactured at an unknown time by the Self Winding Clock Company, which made several others in the terminal. The clock hung inside the gate at Track 19 until 2011, when it was moved so it would not be blocked by lights added during upper-level platform improvements.

==== Lost-and-found bureau ====

Metro-North&#x27;s lost-and-found bureau sits near Track 100 at the far east end of the Dining Concourse. Incoming items are sorted according to function and date: for instance, there are separate bins for hats, gloves, belts, and ties. The sorting system was computerized in the 1990s. Lost items are kept for up to 90 days before being donated or auctioned off.

As early as 1920, the bureau received between 15,000 and 18,000 items a year. By 2002, the bureau was collecting &quot;3,000 coats and jackets; 2,500 cellphones; 2,000 sets of keys; 1,500 wallets, purses and ID&#x27;s ; and 1,100 umbrellas&quot; a year. By 2007, it was collecting 20,000 items a year, 60% of which were eventually claimed. In 2013, the bureau reported an 80% return rate, among the highest in the world for a transit agency.

Some of the more unusual items collected by the bureau include fake teeth, prosthetic body parts, legal documents, diamond pouches, live animals, and a $100,000 violin. One story has it that a woman purposely left her unfaithful husband&#x27;s ashes on a Metro-North train before collecting them three weeks later. In 1996, some of the lost-and-found items were displayed at an art exhibition.

=== Other food service and retail spaces ===

Grand Central Terminal contains restaurants such as the Grand Central Oyster Bar &amp; Restaurant and various fast food outlets surrounding the Dining Concourse. There are also delis, bakeries, a gourmet and fresh food market, and an annex of the New York Transit Museum. The 40-plus retail stores include newsstands and chain stores, including a Starbucks coffee shop, a Rite Aid pharmacy, and an Apple Store. The Oyster Bar, the oldest business in the terminal, sits next to the Dining Concourse and below Vanderbilt Hall.

An elegantly restored cocktail lounge, the Campbell, sits just south of the 43rd Street/Vanderbilt Avenue entrance. A mix of commuters and tourists access it from the street or the balcony level. The space was once the office of 1920s tycoon John W. Campbell, who decorated it to resemble the galleried hall of a 13th-century Florentine palace. In 1999, it opened as a bar, the Campbell Apartment; a new owner renovated and renamed it the Campbell in 2017.

=== Vanderbilt Tennis Club and former studios ===
From 1939 to 1964, CBS Television occupied a large portion of the terminal building, particularly in a third-floor space above Vanderbilt Hall. The CBS offices, called &quot;The Annex&quot;, contained two &quot;program control&quot; facilities (43 and 44); network master control; facilities for local station WCBS-TV; and, after World War II, two production studios (41 and 42). The total space measured . Broadcasts were transmitted from an antenna atop the nearby Chrysler Building installed by order of CBS chief executive William S. Paley, and were also shown on a large screen in the Main Concourse. In 1958, CBS opened the world&#x27;s first major videotape operations facility in Grand Central. Located in a former rehearsal room on the seventh floor, the facility used 14 Ampex VR-1000 videotape recorders.

&quot;Douglas Edwards with the News&quot; broadcast from Grand Central for several years, covering John Glenn&#x27;s 1962 Mercury-Atlas 6 space flight and other events. Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s &quot;See It Now&quot; originated there, including his famous broadcasts on Senator Joseph McCarthy, which were recreated in George Clooney&#x27;s movie &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot;, although the film incorrectly implies that CBS News and corporate offices were in the same building. The long-running panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; was first broadcast from Grand Central, as were &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; and &quot;Mama&quot;. CBS eventually moved its operations to the CBS Broadcast Center on 57th Street.

In 1966, the vacated studio space was converted into the Vanderbilt Athletic Club, a sports club named for the hall just below. Founded by Geza A. Gazdag, an athlete and Olympic coach who fled Hungary amid its 1956 revolution, its two tennis courts were once deemed the most expensive place to play the game—$58 an hour—until financial recessions forced the club to lower the hourly fee to $40. Club amenities included a nylon ski slope, a health club facility and sauna, and spaces for golf, fencing, gymnastics, and ballet practice. Gazdag&#x27;s business was evicted from Grand Central in 1976, amid a lease dispute. In 1984, the club was purchased by real estate magnate Donald Trump, who discovered it while renovating the terminal&#x27;s exterior. In 2009, the MTA planned a new conductor lounge in the space, and terminated Trump&#x27;s lease that year. It divided the space into three floors, with the lounge on the original third floor. A single tennis court was added on the new fourth floor in 2010, along with two practice alleys on the new fifth floor. Trump found the new space too small to release, and so the current Vanderbilt Tennis Club operates independent of Trump.

=== Basement spaces ===
Grand Central Terminal&#x27;s basements are among the largest in the city. Basement spaces include M42, which has AC-to-DC converters to power the track&#x27;s third rails, as well as Carey&#x27;s Hole, a former retail storage space and present-day employee lounge and dormitory.

==== Power and heating plants ====

Grand Central Terminal contains an underground sub-basement known as M42. Its electrical substation is divided into substation 1T, which provides for third-rail power, and substation 1L, which provides for other lighting and power. The substation—the world&#x27;s largest at the time—was built about under the Graybar Building at a cost of $3 million, and opened February 16, 1930. It occupies a four-story space with an area of .

====Carey&#x27;s Hole====

Another part of the basement is known as Carey&#x27;s Hole. The two-story section is directly beneath the Shuttle Passage and adjacent spaces. In 1913, when the terminal opened, J. P. Carey opened a barbershop adjacent to and one level below the terminal&#x27;s waiting room (now Vanderbilt Hall). Carey&#x27;s business expanded to include a laundry service, shoe store, and haberdashery. In 1921, Carey also ran a limousine service using Packard cars, and in the 1930s, he added regular car and bus service to the city&#x27;s airports as they opened. Carey would store his merchandise in an unfinished, underground area of the terminal, which railroad employees and maintenance staff began calling &quot;Carey&#x27;s Hole&quot;. The name has remained even as the space has been used for different purposes, including currently as a lounge and dormitory for railroad employees.

=== Platforms and tracks ===

The terminal holds the Guinness World Record for having the most platforms of any railroad station: 28, which support 44 platform numbers. All are island platforms except one side platform. Odd-numbered tracks are usually on the east side of the platform; even-numbered tracks on the west side. , there are 67 tracks, of which 43 are in regular passenger use, serving Metro-North. At its opening, the train shed contained 123 tracks, including duplicate track numbers and storage tracks, with a combined length of .

The tracks slope down as they exit the station to the north, to help departing trains accelerate and arriving ones slow down. Because of the size of the rail yards, Park Avenue and its side streets from 43rd to 59th Streets are raised on viaducts, and the surrounding blocks were covered over by various buildings.

At its busiest, the terminal is served by an arriving train every 58 seconds.

==== Track distribution ====

The upper Metro-North level has 42 numbered tracks. Twenty-nine serve passenger platforms; these are numbered 11 to 42, east to west. Tracks 12, 22, and 31 do not exist, and appear to have been removed. To the east of the upper platforms sits the East Yard: ten storage tracks numbered 1 through 10 from east to west. A balloon loop runs from Tracks 38–42 on the far west side of the station, around the other tracks, and back to storage Tracks 1–3 at the far east side of the station; this allows trains to turn around more easily.

North of the East Yard is the Lex Yard, a secondary storage yard under the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. The yard formerly served the power plant for Grand Central Terminal. Its twelve tracks are numbered 51 through 65 from east to west (track numbers 57, 58, and 62 do not exist). Two private loading platforms, which cannot be used for passenger service, sit between tracks 53 and 54 and between tracks 61 and 63. Track 61 is known for being a private track for United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt; part of the original design of the Waldorf Astoria, it was mentioned in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1929 and first used in 1938 by John J. Pershing, a top U.S. general during World War I. Roosevelt would travel into the city using his personal train, pull into Track 61, and take a specially designed elevator to the surface. It has been used occasionally since Roosevelt&#x27;s death. The upper level also contains 22 more storage sidings.
Track 63 held MNCW #002, a baggage car, for about 20 to 30 years. The railcar&#x27;s location near Roosevelt&#x27;s Track 61 led former tour guide Dan Brucker and others to falsely claim that this was the president&#x27;s personal train car used for transporting his limousine. The baggage car was moved to the Danbury Railway Museum in 2019.

The lower Metro-North level has 27 tracks numbered 100 to 126, east to west. Two were originally intended for mail trains and two were for baggage handling. Today, only Tracks 102–112 and 114–115 are used for passenger service. The lower-level balloon loop, whose curve was much sharper than that of the upper-level loop and could only handle electric multiple units used on commuter lines was removed at an unknown date. Tracks 116–125 were demolished to make room for the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) concourse constructed underneath the Metro-North station as part of the East Side Access project.

The upper and lower levels have different track layouts and, as such, are supported by different sets of columns. The upper level is supported by ultra-strong columns, some of which can carry over .

The LIRR terminal constructed as part of East Side Access has four platforms and eight tracks numbered 201–204 and 301–304 in two double-decked caverns below the Metro-North station. It has four tracks and two platforms in each of the two caverns, with each cavern containing two tracks and an island platform on each level. A mezzanine is located on a center level between the LIRR&#x27;s two track levels.

=== Office spaces and control center ===
Upper floors of the terminal primarily hold MTA offices. These spaces and most others in the terminal are not open to the public, requiring key cards to access. The fifth floor holds the office of the terminal&#x27;s director, overlooking the Main Concourse. The seventh floor contains Metro-North&#x27;s situation room (a board room for police and terminal directors to handle emergencies), as well as the offices of the Fleet Department.

Grand Central Terminal has an Operations Control Center on its sixth floor, where controllers monitor the track interlockings with computers. Completed in 1993, the center is operated by a crew of about 24 people. The terminal was originally built with five signal control centers, labeled A, B, C, F, and U, that collectively controlled all of the track interlockings around the terminal. The interlockings used to be of electro-mechanical type, supplied by General Railway Signal (GRS). Each switch was electrically controlled by a lever in one of the signal towers, where lights illuminated on track maps to show which switches were in use. As trains passed a given tower, the signal controllers reported the train&#x27;s engine and timetable numbers, direction, track number, and the exact time. In 1993, the original interlockings machines were replaced with 17 GRS VPI microprocessors.

Tower U controlled the interlocking between 48th and 58th streets; Tower C, the storage spurs; and Tower F, the turning loops. A four-story underground tower at 49th Street housed the largest of the signal towers: Tower A, which handled the upper-level interlockings via 400 levers, and Tower B, which handled the lower-level interlockings with 362 levers. The towers housed offices for the stationmaster, yardmaster, car-maintenance crew, electrical crew, and track-maintenance crew. There were also break rooms for conductors, train engineers, and engine men. After Tower B was destroyed in a fire in 1986, the signal towers were consolidated into the modern control center.

=== Hospital ===

During the terminal&#x27;s construction, an &quot;accident room&quot; was set up to treat worker injuries in a wrecking car in the terminal&#x27;s rail yard. Later on, a small hospital was established in the temporary station building on Lexington Avenue to care for injured workers. The arrangement was satisfactory, leading to the creation of a permanent hospital, the Grand Central Emergency Hospital, in Grand Central Terminal in 1911. The hospital was used for every employee injury as well as for passengers. In 1915, it had two physicians who treated a monthly average of 125 new cases per month and 450 dressings. The space had four rooms: Room A (the waiting room), Room B (the operating room), Room C (a private office), and Room D (for resting patients). The hospital was open at least until 1963; a &quot;Journal News&quot; article that year noted that the hospital treated minor to moderate ailments and was open every day between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.

=== Libraries ===
Located on an upper floor above the Apple Store, the Williamson Library is a meeting space and research center for the New York Railroad Enthusiasts. Upon its founding in 1937, the association was granted use of the space in perpetuity by Frederick Ely Williamson, once president of the New York Central Railroad as well as a rail enthusiast and member of the association. Today, it contains about 3,000 books, newspapers, films, photographs, and other documents about railroads, along with artifacts, including part of a &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; red carpet. The library is only accessible through secure areas, making it little known to the public and not included in tours of the terminal&#x27;s hidden attributes. The association holds monthly meetings in the space, open to new visitors for free, and allows research visits by appointment.

Another library, the Frank Julian Sprague Memorial Library of the Electric Railroaders Association, existed on the terminal&#x27;s fourth floor from 1979 to 2014. The library had about 500,000 publications and slides, focusing on electric rail and trolley lines. A large amount of these works were donated to the New York Transit Museum in 2013, or placed in storage. The now-8,000-volume library was relocated to the Shore Line Trolley Museum in Connecticut in 2014, where it could operate with more staff attention and public access.

== Architecture ==


Grand Central Terminal was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by Reed and Stem, which handled the overall design of the terminal, and Warren and Wetmore, which mainly made cosmetic alterations to the exterior and interior. Various elements inside the terminal were designed by French architects and artists Jules-Félix Coutan, Sylvain Salières, and Paul César Helleu. Grand Central has monumental spaces as well as meticulously crafted detail, especially on its facade, which is based on an overall exterior design by Whitney Warren.

The terminal is widely recognized and favorably viewed by the American public. In America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture, a 2006–07 public survey by the American Institute of Architects, respondents ranked it their 13th-favorite work of architecture in the country, and their fourth-favorite in the city and state after the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. In 2012, the American Society of Civil Engineers designated it a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark; one year later, historian David Cannadine described it as one of the most majestic buildings of the twentieth century.

As proposed in 1904, Grand Central Terminal was bounded by Vanderbilt Avenue to the west, Lexington Avenue to the east, 42nd Street to the south, and 45th Street to the north. It included a post office on its east side. The east side of the station house proper is an alley called Depew Place, which was built along with the Grand Central Depot annex in the 1880s and mostly decommissioned in the 1900s when the new terminal was built.

As first built, the station house measured about along Vanderbilt Avenue (120 feet longer than originally planned) and on 42nd Street. Floors above the first story are set back about 50 feet, making the rest of the station house originally measure 290 by 670 feet. The station is about tall.

===Structure and materials===
The station and its rail yard have steel frames. The building also uses large steel columns designed to hold the weight of a 20-story office building, which was to be built when additional room was required.

The facade and structure of the terminal building primarily use granite. Because granite emits radiation, people who work full-time in the station receive an average dose of 525 mrem/year, more than permitted in nuclear power facilities. The base of the exterior is Stony Creek granite, while the upper portion is of Indiana limestone, from Bedford, Indiana.

The interiors use several varieties of stone, including imitation Caen stone for the Main Concourse; cream-colored Botticino marble for the interior decorations; and pink Tennessee marble for the floors of the Main Concourse, Biltmore Room, and Vanderbilt Hall, as well as the two staircases in the Main Concourse. Real Caen stone was judged too expensive, so the builders mixed plaster, sand, lime, and Portland cement. Most of the remaining masonry is made from concrete. Guastavino tiling, a fireproof tile-and-cement vault pattern patented by Rafael Guastavino, is used in various spaces.

===Facade===

The terminal&#x27;s main facade is situated on the building&#x27;s southern side, facing 42nd Street. It includes a low first story supporting the main portion of the facade, which was key to the architects&#x27; vision of the building as a gateway to the city. Its trio of 60-by-30-foot arched windows are interspersed with ten fluted Doric columns that are partially attached to the granite walls behind them, though they are detached from one another. Each window bay is separated by a double pair of these columns, which are in turn separated by a smaller bay with narrow windows. The set of windows resembles an ancient Roman triumphal arch, while the column placement is reminiscent of the Louvre Colonnade. The facade was also designed to complement that of the New York Public Library Main Branch, another Beaux-Arts edifice on nearby Fifth Avenue.

The facade includes several large works of art. At the top of the south facade is an elaborate entablature featuring a clock set in the middle of a round broken pediment, flanked by overflowing cornucopias. Above the clock is the &quot;Glory of Commerce&quot; sculptural group, a work by Jules-Félix Coutan, which includes representations of Minerva, Hercules, and Mercury. At its unveiling in 1914, the work was considered the largest sculptural group in the world. Below these works, facing the Park Avenue Viaduct, is an 1869 statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt, longtime owner of New York Central. Sculpted by Ernst Plassmann, the bronze is the last remnant of a 150-foot bronze relief installed at the Hudson River Railroad depot at St. John&#x27;s Park; it was moved to Grand Central Terminal in 1929.

===Interior===
==== Main Concourse ====
The Main Concourse, on the terminal&#x27;s upper platform level, is located in the geographical center of the station building. The cavernous concourse measures long by wide by high; a total of about . Its vastness was meant to evoke the terminal&#x27;s &quot;grand&quot; status.

==== Iconography ====

Many parts of the terminal are adorned with sculpted oak leaves and acorns, nuts of the oak tree. Cornelius Vanderbilt chose the acorn as the symbol of the Vanderbilt family, and adopted the saying &quot;Great oaks from little acorns grow&quot; as the family motto. Among these decorations is a brass acorn finial atop the four-sided clock in the center of the Main Concourse. Other acorn or oak leaf decorations include carved wreaths under the Main Concourse&#x27;s west stairs; sculptures above the lunettes in the Main Concourse; metalwork above the elevators; reliefs above the train gates; and the electric chandeliers in the Main Waiting Room and Main Concourse. These decorations were designed by Salières.

The overlapping letters &quot;G&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;T&quot; are sculpted into multiple places in the terminal, including in friezes atop several windows above the terminal&#x27;s ticket office. The symbol was designed with the &quot;T&quot; resembling an upside-down anchor, intended as a reference to Cornelius Vanderbilt&#x27;s commercial beginnings in shipping and ferry businesses. In 2017, the MTA based its new logo for the terminal on the engraved design; MTA officials said its black and gold colors have long been associated with the terminal. The spur of the letter &quot;G&quot; has a depiction of a railroad spike. The 2017 logo succeeded one created by the firm Pentagram for the terminal&#x27;s centennial in 2013. It depicted the Main Concourse&#x27;s ball clock set to 7:13, or 19:13 using a 24-hour clock, referencing the terminal&#x27;s completion in 1913. Both logos omit the word &quot;terminal&quot; in its name, in recognition to how most people refer to the building.

=== Influence ===
Some of the buildings most closely modeled on Grand Central&#x27;s design were designed by its two architecture firms. Warren and Wetmore went on to design many notable train stations, including the Poughkeepsie station in Poughkeepsie, New York; Union Station in Winnipeg, Manitoba; the Yonkers station in Yonkers, New York; Union Station in Houston; and Michigan Central Station in Detroit (also co-designed by Reed &amp; Stem). Reed &amp; Stem&#x27;s successor firm Stem &amp; Fellheimer designed Union Station in Utica, New York, which also has resemblances to Grand Central Terminal.

== Related structures ==
=== Park Avenue Viaduct ===
The Park Avenue Viaduct is an elevated road that carries Park Avenue around the terminal building and the MetLife Building and through the Helmsley Building—three buildings that lie across the line of the avenue. The viaduct rises from street level on 40th Street south of Grand Central, splits into eastern (northbound) and western (southbound) legs above the terminal building&#x27;s main entrance, and continues north around the station building, directly above portions of its main level. The legs of the viaduct pass around the MetLife Building, into the Helmsley Building, and return to street level at 46th Street.

The viaduct was built to facilitate traffic along 42nd Street and along Park Avenue, which at the time was New York City&#x27;s only discontinuous major north–south avenue. When the western leg of the viaduct was completed in 1919, it served both directions of traffic, and also served as a second level for picking up and dropping off passengers. After an eastern leg for northbound traffic was added in 1928, the western leg was used for southbound traffic only. A sidewalk, accessible from the Grand Hyatt hotel, runs along the section of the viaduct that is parallel to 42nd Street.

=== Post office and baggage buildings ===

Grand Central Terminal has a post office at 450 Lexington Avenue. Built from 1906 to 1909, it was topped with a high-rise tower in 1992. The original architecture matches that of the terminal, which was designed by the same architects. In 1915, postal operations expanded into a second building, also built by Warren &amp; Wetmore, directly north of the original structure. This second building, erected as the Railroad Mail Service Building and today known as 237 Park Avenue, has been extensively renovated. Grand Central&#x27;s post office buildings were designed to handle massive volumes of mail, though they were not as large as the James A. Farley Building, the post office that was built with the original Penn Station.

The terminal complex also originally included a six-story building for baggage handling just north of the main station building. Departing passengers unloaded their luggage from taxis or personal vehicles on the Park Avenue Viaduct, and elevators brought it to the baggage passageways (now part of Grand Central North), where trucks brought the luggage to the platforms. The process was reversed for arriving passengers. Biltmore Hotel guests arriving at Grand Central could get baggage delivered to their rooms. The baggage building was later converted to an office building, and was demolished in 1961 to make way for the MetLife Building.

=== Subway station ===

The terminal&#x27;s subway station, Grand Central–42nd Street, serves three lines: the IRT Lexington Avenue Line (serving the ), the IRT Flushing Line (serving the ), and the IRT 42nd Street Shuttle to Times Square. Originally built by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), the lines are operated by the MTA as part of the New York City Subway.

The Main Concourse is connected to the subway platforms&#x27; mezzanine via the Shuttle Passage. The platforms can also be reached from the 42nd Street Passage via stairs, escalators, and an elevator to the fare control area for the Lexington Avenue and Flushing Lines.

The 42nd Street Shuttle platforms, located just below ground level, opened in 1904 as an express stop on the original IRT subway. The Lexington Avenue Line&#x27;s platforms, which were opened in 1918 when the original IRT subway platforms were converted to shuttle use, run underneath the southeastern corner of the station building at a 45-degree angle, to the east of and at a lower level than the shuttle platforms. The Flushing Line platform opened in 1915; it is deeper than the Lexington Avenue Line&#x27;s platforms because it is part of the Steinway Tunnel, a former streetcar tunnel that descends under the East River to the east of Grand Central. There was also a fourth line connected to Grand Central Terminal: a spur of the IRT Third Avenue elevated, which stopped at Grand Central starting in 1878; it was made obsolete by the subway&#x27;s opening, and closed in 1923.

During the terminal&#x27;s construction, there were proposals to allow commuter trains to pass through Grand Central and continue into the subway tracks. However, these plans were deemed impractical because commuter trains would have been too large to fit within the subway tunnels.

== History ==
Three buildings serving essentially the same function have stood on the current Grand Central Terminal&#x27;s site.

=== Predecessors ===

Grand Central Terminal arose from a need to build a central station for the Hudson River Railroad, the New York and Harlem Railroad, and the New York and New Haven Railroad in modern-day Midtown Manhattan. The Harlem Railroad originally ran as a steam railroad on street level along Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue), while the New Haven Railroad ran along the Harlem&#x27;s tracks in Manhattan per a trackage agreement. The business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt bought the Hudson River and New York Central Railroads in 1867, and merged them two years later. Vanderbilt developed a proposal to unite the three separate railroads at a single central station, replacing the separate and adjacent stations that created chaos in baggage transfer.

Vanderbilt commissioned John B. Snook to design his new station, dubbed Grand Central Depot, on the site of the 42nd Street depot. Construction ran from September 1, 1869, to October 1871. Designed in the Second Empire style, the station was considered the country&#x27;s first to measure up to those in Europe.

Expansions in 1895 and 1900—the latter coinciding with a renaming to Grand Central Station—could not keep up with the growth in passenger traffic, nor could they alleviate the problems of smoke and soot produced by steam locomotives in the Park Avenue Tunnel, the only approach to the station. After a deadly 1902 crash in the smoky tunnel, the New York state legislature enacted a ban on steam trains in Manhattan, to begin in 1908. William J. Wilgus, the New York Central&#x27;s vice president, proposed to tear down Grand Central Station and build a new, larger station with two levels of tracks, all electrified and underground. The railroad&#x27;s board of directors approved the $35 million project in June 1903.

=== Replacement ===

The new Grand Central Terminal was to be the biggest terminal in the world, both in the size of the building and in the number of tracks. It was meant to compete with Pennsylvania Station, a majestic electric-train hub being built on Manhattan&#x27;s west side for arch-rival Pennsylvania Railroad by McKim, Mead &amp; White. New York Central picked the firm of Reed and Stem to handle the overall design of the station, and Warren and Wetmore for the station&#x27;s Beaux-Arts exterior.
Construction on Grand Central Terminal started on June 19, 1903. and proceeded in phases to prevent railroad service from being interrupted. About of the ground were excavated at depths of up to 10 floors, with of debris being removed from the site daily. Over 10,000 workers were assigned to the project. The total cost of improvements, including electrification and the development of Park Avenue, was estimated at $180 million in 1910. The segments of all three lines running into Grand Central had been electrified by 1907. The last train left Grand Central Station at midnight on June 5, 1910, and the new terminal opened on February 2, 1913.

=== Heyday ===
The terminal spurred development in the surrounding area, particularly in Terminal City, a commercial and office district created above where the tracks were covered. The development of Terminal City also included the construction of the Park Avenue Viaduct, surrounding the station, in the 1920s. The new electric service led to increased development in New York City&#x27;s suburbs, and passenger traffic on the commuter lines into Grand Central more than doubled in the seven years following the terminal&#x27;s completion. Passenger traffic grew so rapidly that by 1918, New York Central proposed expanding Grand Central Terminal.

In 1923, the Grand Central Art Galleries opened in the terminal. A year after it opened, the galleries established the Grand Central School of Art, which occupied on the seventh floor of the east wing of the terminal. The Grand Central School of Art remained in the east wing until 1944, and it moved to the Biltmore Hotel in 1958.

=== Decline ===

In 1947, over 65 million people traveled through Grand Central, an all-time high. The station&#x27;s decline came soon afterward with the beginning of the Jet Age and the construction of the Interstate Highway System. There were multiple proposals to alter the terminal, including several replacing the station building with a skyscraper; none of the plans were carried out. Though the main building site was not redeveloped, the Pan Am Building (now the MetLife Building) was erected just to the north, opening in 1963.

In 1968, New York Central, facing bankruptcy, merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad to form the Penn Central Railroad. The new corporation proposed to demolish Grand Central Terminal and replace it with a skyscraper, as the Pennsylvania Railroad had done with the original Penn Station in 1963. However, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, which had designated Grand Central a city landmark in 1967, refused to consider the plans. The resulting lawsuit went to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled in favor of the city. After Penn Central went into bankruptcy in 1970, it retained title to Grand Central Terminal. When Penn Central reorganized as American Premier Underwriters (APU) in 1994, it retained ownership of Penn Central. In turn, APU was absorbed by American Financial Group.

Grand Central and the surrounding neighborhood became dilapidated during the 1970s, and the interior of Grand Central was dominated by huge advertisements, which included the Kodak Colorama photos and the Westclox &quot;Big Ben&quot; clock. In 1975, Donald Trump bought the Commodore Hotel to the east of the terminal for $10 million and then worked out a deal with Jay Pritzker to transform it into one of the first Grand Hyatt hotels. Grand Central Terminal was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and declared a National Historic Landmark in the following year. This period was marked by a bombing on September 10, 1976, when a group of Croatian nationalists planted a bomb in a coin locker at Grand Central Terminal and hijacked a plane; the bomb exploded while being disarmed and injured three NYPD officers and killed one bomb squad specialist.

The terminal was used for intercity transit until 1991. Amtrak, the national rail system formed in 1971, ran its last train from Grand Central on April 6, 1991, upon the completion of the Empire Connection on Manhattan&#x27;s West Side. The connection allowed trains using the Empire Corridor from Albany, Toronto, and Montreal to use Penn Station. However, some Amtrak trains used Grand Central during the summers of 2017 and 2018 due to maintenance at Penn Station.

=== Renovation and subsequent expansions ===

In 1988, the MTA commissioned a study of Grand Central Terminal, which concluded that parts of the terminal could be turned into a retail area.

In 1995, the agency began a $113.8 million renovation of the terminal&#x27;s interior. All advertisements were removed and the station was restored; for example, the Main Concourse ceiling was cleaned to reveal the painted skyscape and constellations. The East Stairs, a curved monumental staircase on the east side of the Main Concourse, was added to match the West Stairs. The project&#x27;s completion was marked with a re-dedication ceremony on October 1, 1998.

In December 2006, American Financial sold Grand Central Terminal to Midtown TDR Ventures, LLC, an investment group controlled by Argent Ventures, which renegotiated the lease with the MTA to last until 2274. In 2018, the MTA exercised its option to purchase the terminal, along with the Hudson and Harlem Lines. The agency took ownership of the terminal and rail lines in February 2020.
On February 1, 2013, numerous displays, performances, and events were held to celebrate the terminal&#x27;s centennial. The MTA awarded contracts to replace the display boards and public announcement systems and add security cameras at Grand Central Terminal in December 2017. The MTA also proposed to repair the Grand Central Terminal train shed&#x27;s concrete and steel as part of the 2020–2024 MTA Capital Program. In February 2019, it was announced that the Grand Hyatt New York hotel that abuts Grand Central Terminal to the east would be torn down and replaced with a larger mixed-use structure over the next several years. In September 2020, the skyscraper One Vanderbilt opened, along with a train hall at its base, a pedestrian plaza connecting it to the terminal, and an underground passage to the complex&#x27;s subway station. The plaza was built on a section of Vanderbilt Avenue, permanently closing the section to automobile traffic for the first time.

In January 2023, the MTA&#x27;s new Grand Central Madison station opened beneath Grand Central Terminal. The new station, serving the Long Island Rail Road, was under development since 2007. The project, officially titled East Side Access, cost $11.1 billion. LIRR trains arrive and depart from a bi-level, eight-track tunnel with four platforms more than below the Metro-North tracks. The station includes a new 350,000-square-foot retail and dining concourse and new entrances at 45th, 46th, and 48th streets.

== Innovations ==
=== Passenger improvements ===

At the time of its completion, Grand Central Terminal offered several innovations in transit-hub design. One was the use of ramps, rather than staircases, to conduct passengers and luggage through the facility. Two ramps connected the lower-level suburban concourse to the main concourse; several more led from the main concourse to entrances on 42nd Street. These ramps allowed all travelers to easily move between Grand Central&#x27;s two underground levels. There were also 15 passenger elevators and six freight-and-passenger elevators scattered around the station. The separation of commuter and intercity trains, as well as incoming and outgoing trains, ensured that most passengers on a given ramp would be traveling in the same direction. At its opening in 1913, the terminal was theoretically able to accommodate 100 million passengers a year.

The Park Avenue Viaduct, which wrapped around the terminal, allowed Park Avenue traffic to bypass the building without being diverted onto nearby streets, and reconnected the only north–south avenue in midtown Manhattan that had an interruption in it. The station building was also designed to accommodate the re-connection of both segments of 43rd Street by going through the concourse, if the City of New York had demanded it.

Designers of the new terminal tried to make it as comfortable as possible. Amenities included an oak-floored waiting room for women, attended to by maids; a shoeshine room, also for women; a room with telephones; a beauty salon with gender-separated portions; a dressing room, with maids available for a fee; and a men&#x27;s barbershop, containing a public area with barbers from many cultures, as well as a rentable private space. Grand Central was designed with two concourses, one on each level. The &quot;outbound&quot; concourse could handle 15,000 people; the &quot;inbound&quot; concourse, 8,000. A waiting room adjoining each concourse could fit another 5,000. Brochures advertised the new Grand Central Terminal as a tourist-friendly space where &quot;[t]imid travelers may ask questions with no fear of being rebuffed by hurrying trainmen, or imposed upon by hotel runners, chauffeurs or others in blue uniforms&quot;; a safe and welcoming place for people of all cultures, where &quot;special accommodations are to be provided for immigrants and gangs of laborers&quot;; and a general tourist attraction &quot;where one delights to loiter, admiring its beauty and symmetrical lines—a poem in stone&quot;. The waiting room by the Main Concourse, now Vanderbilt Hall, also had an advantage over many, including Penn Station&#x27;s: Grand Central&#x27;s waiting room was a tranquil place to wait, with all ticket booths, information desks, baggage areas, and meeting areas instead removed to the Main Concourse.
Every train at Grand Central Terminal departs one minute later than its posted departure time. The extra minute is intended to encourage passengers rushing to catch trains at the last minute to slow down.

All of the terminal&#x27;s light fixtures are bare light bulbs. At the time of the terminal&#x27;s construction, electricity was still a relatively new invention, and the inclusion of electric light bulbs showcased this innovation. In 2009, the incandescent light bulbs were replaced with energy- and money-saving fluorescent lamp fixtures.

When Grand Central Terminal opened, it hired two types of porters, marked with different-colored caps, to assist passengers. Porters with red caps served as bellhops, rolling luggage around Grand Central Terminal, and were rarely paid tips. There were more than 500 red-capped porters at one point. Porters with green caps, a position introduced in 1922, provided information services, sending out or receiving telegrams or phone messages for a fee. They later started dropping off and picking up packages as well. There were only twelve green-capped porters, as well as two messengers who brought messages to an exchange on the west side of the terminal.

=== Track improvements ===

Grand Central Terminal was built to handle 200 trains per hour, though actual traffic never came close to that. It had 46 tracks and 30 platforms, more than twice Penn Station&#x27;s 21 tracks and 11 platforms. Its rail yard could hold 1,149 cars, far more than the 366 in its predecessor station, and it dwarfed Penn Station&#x27;s yard.

As constructed, the upper level was for intercity trains, and the lower level for commuter trains. This allowed commuter and intercity passengers to board and exit trains without interfering with each other.

Balloon loops surrounding the station eliminated the need for complicated switching moves to bring the trains to the coach yards for service. At the time, passenger cars did not run on their own power, but were pulled by locomotives, and it was believed dangerous to perform locomotive shunting moves underground. Trains would drop passengers off at one side of the station, perhaps be stored or serviced in the rail yard, then use the turning loops and pick up passengers on the other side. The loops extended under Vanderbilt Avenue to the west and Lexington Avenue to the east.

=== Terminal City ===
Burying the terminal&#x27;s tracks and platforms also allowed the railroads to sell above-ground air rights for real-estate development. Grand Central&#x27;s construction thus produced several blocks of prime real estate in Manhattan, stretching from 42nd to 51st Streets between Madison and Lexington avenues. By the time the terminal opened in 1913, the blocks surrounding it were each valued at $2 million to $3 million. Terminal City soon became Manhattan&#x27;s most desirable commercial and office district. From 1904 to 1926, land values along Park Avenue doubled, and land values in the Terminal City area increased 244%.

The district came to include office buildings such as the Chrysler Building, Chanin Building, Bowery Savings Bank Building, and Pershing Square Building; luxury apartment houses along Park Avenue; an array of high-end hotels that included the Commodore, Biltmore, Roosevelt, Marguery, Chatham, Barclay, Park Lane, and Waldorf Astoria; the Grand Central Palace; and the Yale Club of New York City. The structures immediately around Grand Central Terminal were developed shortly after the terminal&#x27;s opening, while the structures along Park Avenue were constructed through the 1920s and 1930s.

The Graybar Building, completed in 1927, was one of the last projects of Terminal City. The building incorporates many of Grand Central&#x27;s train platforms, as well as the Graybar Passage, a hallway with vendors and train gates stretching from the terminal to Lexington Avenue. In 1929, New York Central built its headquarters in a 34-story building, later renamed the Helmsley Building, which straddled Park Avenue north of the terminal. Development slowed drastically during the Great Depression, and part of Terminal City was gradually demolished or reconstructed with steel-and-glass designs after World War II.

The area shares similar boundaries as the Grand Central Business Improvement District, a neighborhood with businesses collectively funding improvements and maintenance in the area. The district is well-funded; in 1990 it had the largest budget of any business improvement district in the United States. The district&#x27;s organization and operation is run by the Grand Central Partnership, which has given free tours of the station building. The partnership has also funded some restoration projects around the terminal, including installation of lamps to illuminate its facade and purchase of a streetlamp that used to stand on the Park Avenue Viaduct.

== Emergency services ==

The terminal is served by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department, whose Fifth District is headquartered in a station on the Dining Concourse. MTA officers patrol the terminal in specialized vehicles, including three-wheeled electric scooters from T3 Motion and utility vehicles by Global Electric Motorcars.

Various actions by MTA officers in the terminal have received media attention over the years. In 1988, seven officers were suspended for behaving inappropriately, including harassing a homeless man and patrolling unclothed. In the early 2000s, officers arrested two transgender people—Dean Spade in 2002 and Helena Stone in 2006—who were attempting to use restrooms aligning with their gender identities. Lawsuits forced the MTA to drop the charges and to thenceforth allow use of restrooms according to gender identity. In 2017, an officer assaulted and arrested a conductor who was removing a passenger from a train in the terminal.

Fire and medical emergency services are provided by the Metro-North Fire Brigade, a professional fire department whose members belong to the International Association of Fire Fighters union. The brigade handles 1,600 to 1,700 calls for service a year, mostly medical in nature. The brigade regularly trains the NYPD, FDNY, and MTA Police to navigate the terminal and its miles of tunnels, and trains other Metro-North employees in first aid and CPR. It also conducts fire drills and stations fire guards for special events in the terminal. Until 2007, the fire brigade was made up of volunteer Metro-North employees who received firefighting and emergency medical certification and would answer calls while on the clock for the railroad.

The brigade&#x27;s fleet, stored in a bay next to Track 14, includes three electric carts equipped with red lights: a white-painted ambulance no wider than a hospital bed that carries a stretcher, oxygen tanks, defibrillators, and other medical equipment; a red pumper that carries 200 gallons of water and 300 feet of fire hose; and a red rescue truck with air packs, forcible-entry tools, and turnout gear.

== Art installations and performances ==

Among the permanent works of public art in Grand Central are the celestial ceiling in the Main Concourse, the &quot;Glory of Commerce&quot; sculptural group and the statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt decorating the building&#x27;s south façade, and the two cast-iron eagle statues adorning sites around the station&#x27;s exterior. Temporary works, exhibitions, and events are regularly mounted in Vanderbilt Hall, while the Dining Concourse features temporary exhibits in a series of lightboxes. The terminal is also known for its performance and installation art, including flash mobs and other spontaneous events.

==Visitors==

Grand Central Terminal is one of the world&#x27;s ten most-visited tourist attractions, with 21.6 million visitors in 2018, excluding train and subway passengers. The high visitor traffic makes it one of the most-photographed places in New York City and the United States. A 2009 Cornell University study of geotagged photos indicated the station was the fourth-most-photographed place in New York City. Tourism to the station is not a new phenomenon; the 1900–1910 station was second to the U.S. Capitol Building in its visitor count.

In 2013, in conjunction with the terminal&#x27;s centennial celebration, the Municipal Art Society began providing daily live station tours, and audio tour producer Orpheo USA began providing pre-recorded tours with headsets Tours were suspended for two years during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since late 2022, daily docent-led tours of the station have been conducted by Walks, an international tour company, by arrangement with the MTA.

Transit passenger traffic makes the terminal the third-busiest train station in North America, after New York Penn Station and Toronto Union Station. , about 67.326 million riders entered and exited at Grand Central Terminal.

== In popular culture ==
Grand Central Terminal has been the subject, inspiration, or setting for literature, television and radio episodes, and films.

The MTA hosts about 25 large-scale and hundreds of smaller or amateur film and television productions every year. Grand Central has been a backdrop for romantic reunions between couples. After the terminal declined in the 1950s, it was more frequently used as a dark, dangerous place, even a metaphor for chaos and disorientation, featuring chase scenes, shootouts, homeless people, and the mentally ill. Almost every scene filmed in the terminal&#x27;s train shed was shot on Track 34, one of the few platforms without structural columns blocking views.

Grand Central Terminal&#x27;s architecture, including its Main Concourse clock, are depicted on the stage of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, a long-running NBC television show. The soundstage reconstruction of the terminal in Studio 8H was first installed in 2003.
Notable literature featuring the terminal includes J. D. Salinger&#x27;s novel &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; as well as &quot;Report on Grand Central Terminal&quot;, a short story written by nuclear physicist Leo Szilard in 1948. The infrastructure in Grand Central inspired the novel &quot;The Invention of Hugo Cabret&quot;, and in turn, the film &quot;Hugo&quot;.

<doc id="301615" wikidata="Q468554" url="?curid=301615" title="Maha Sarakham province">
<text>Maha Sarakham province, also written Maha Sarakham or Mahasarakham (, , , ), known locally and simply as Sarakham (, ), is one of the 76 provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand which lies in central northeastern Thailand, also called Isan. Its neighbouring provinces are (from north clockwise): Kalasin, Roi Et, Surin, Buriram, and Khon Kaen.

The town of Maha Sarakham is the provincial capital. It is the home of Mahasarakham University, one of the largest universities in northeast Thailand with 41,000 students (2017), and Rajabhat Mahasarakham University.

== Geography ==

The province is mostly a plain covered with rice fields. Only in the north and east are there small hills. The province is between 130 and 230 m above sea level. The main river is the Chi. The total forest area is or 3.8 percent of provincial area.

== History ==
From the 8th to 10th centuries, several Buddhist relics originated from the ancient town of Champasi which is now in Amphoe Na Dun. Such relics, such as the relic of The Buddha has led speculation of an kingdom being located in the province. During this time and after, the province continued as a Buddhist center in Isan.

Maha Sarakham was originally a satellite town of Roi Et, founded in 1865. The governor of Roi Et province sent 9,000 people to populate the new town, and one of his cousins as its governor. In 1868 the central government in Bangkok declared Maha Sarakham a province of its own under the supervision of Bangkok. One of the reasons was that this step weakened the power of Roi Et.

On April 3, 2023, provincial police arrested a 38-year-old man who they seized 322,000 methamphetamine tablets from him. He had been selling these in Ubon Ratchathani province and several other nearby provinces.

== Symbols ==
The provincial seal shows a tree in front of rice fields, symbolizing the richness of resources in the province.

The provincial flag shows the seal in the middle, in a brown horizontal strip. Above and below is a yellow strip. The brown color symbolizes the strength and the perseverance of the people in the province, who live in the rather dry climate; the yellow color symbolizes the robes of Buddhist monks as evidence of the faith of the people.

The provincial tree is the woman&#x27;s tongue tree (&quot;Albizia lebbeck&quot;). The tree symbol was assigned to the province in 1994 by Queen Sirikit. The provincial flower is the West Indian jasmine (&quot;Ixora&quot;). The provincial aquatic life is the endemic freshwater crab &quot;Thaipotamon chulabhorn&quot;.
== Administration ==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into 13 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further divided into 133 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 1,804 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Maha Sarakham Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 19 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Maha Sarakham has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 18 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 123 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="301616" wikidata="Q6738724" url="?curid=301616" title="Makapuʻu">
<text>Makapuu is the extreme eastern end of the Island of Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands, comprising the remnant of a ridge that rises 647 feet (197 m) above the sea. The cliff at Makapuu Point forms the eastern tip and is the site of a prominent lighthouse. The place name of this area, meaning &quot;bulging eye&quot; in Hawaiian, is thought to derive from the name of an image said to have been located in a cave here called &quot;Keanaokeakuapōloli&quot;. The entire area is quite scenic and a panoramic view is presented at the lookout on Kalanianaole Highway (State Rte. 72) where the roadway surmounts the cliff just before turning south towards leeward Oahu and Honolulu.

The Makapuu area is reached approximately east of Waimānalo Beach on Kalanianaole Highway (State Rte. 72) or from the Honolulu side (south shore; Hawaii Kai) travelling east along the same highway beyond Sandy Beach. The Makapuu Point State Wayside Park, a roadside park, is about midway up the draw on the right-hand side coming from Hawaii Kai.

Features of special interest in this area include:
* [[Sea Life Park Hawaii]] – A large commercial park and aquarium featuring displays and shows of Hawaiian marine life.

* [[Makapuu Point Light|Makapuu Point Lighthouse]] is a , active United States Coast Guard lighthouse established in 1909. Construction for the lighthouse was prompted by the grounding of the steamer &quot;Manchuria&quot; in the predawn hours on August 20, 1906 on the reefs off Waimānalo. The lighthouse was automated in 1974 and its keepers quarters demolished in 1987, but the remnants are still visible. The lighthouse contains a roughly French Fresnel hyper-radial lens, the largest lens in use in the United States. The lens is able to magnify and intensify the illumination of a single electrical 1,000-watt, 120-volt light bulb. It was damaged by a vandal firing a bullet at it, but the lens is still in service as it is no longer reproducible. A popular day hike along the access road to the lighthouse begins at a parking lot located south of the Makapuu lookout on Kalanianaole Highway. A second trail leads from the remnants of the keepers quarters to the lighthouse, but it is off limits to the public. The lighthouse itself is also off limits to the public and is protected by three locked gates.
* Makapuu Point State Wayside is part of the eastern end of Oahu encompassing Makapuu Head and the lighthouse at Makapuu Point. A paved road, open to the public for foot traffic only, leads out to the Makapuu Lighthouse. The trail is roughly long and rises mostly heading towards the south along the land-side of the ridge and curves around &quot;Puu o Kīpahulu&quot; (southern end of the ridge), then traverses the ridge bearing right towards the lighthouse, which is closed to the public. A trail leads up from the former Coast Guard residential area to a summit from which the islands of Molokai and Lanai may be seen across the Kaiwi Channel. On particularly clear days, the island of Maui can be visible. Of interest to hikers visiting the wayside park is the possibility of seeing Humpback whales in the waters offshore between the months of November and April. A telescope is available to the public at the summit lookout. There are so-called blowholes along the rocky shore below Makapuu Head which are sometimes active.
* [[Mānana]] Island is a offshore tuff cone known as Rabbit Island because of its resemblance to a large rabbit&#x27;s head rising out of the sea and because it was once inhabited by introduced rabbits after a rancher released them there. The island is now a protected bird sanctuary and thereby illegal to land there unless you have permission from the Hawaii Department of Land Natural Resources.
* Kāohikaipu – A low volcanic islet off Makapuu Beach Park; also a State Bird Sanctuary.

* Makapuu Beach Park and Kaupō Beach Park – All of the rocky shoreline and pocket beaches between the sea cliffs at Makapuu Point and the State Research Pier (Makai Pier) are beach parks open to the public. Wave conditions at Kaupō (western end) are more suited to young beach-goers and poor swimmers. Makapuu Beach is a popular body-surfing beach, but the shore break can be dangerous.
* Makai Pier – A long, concrete pier built by the State of Hawaii to support marine research efforts in the Hawaiian Islands. This pier houses several commercial marine engineering firms and HURL (Hawaii Underwater Research Laboratory).
* Ka Iwi State Scenic Shoreline - The coastal area that extends from Makapuu Point Wayside to Sandy&#x27;s Beach. Included in this section is Pele&#x27;s Chair rock formation and the beach/swimming spot that shares the same name.

<text>The Way series is a trilogy of science fiction novels and one short story by American author Greg Bear published from 1985 to 1999. The first novel was &quot;Eon&quot; (1985), followed by a sequel, &quot;Eternity&quot; and a prequel, &quot;Legacy&quot;. It also includes &quot;The Way of All Ghosts&quot;, a short story that falls between &quot;Legacy&quot; and &quot;Eon&quot;.

== Novels ==
===&quot;Eon&quot;===
&quot;Eon&quot; chronicles the appearance and discovery of the &quot;Thistledown&quot;, and its subsequent effect on humanity.

In the early 21st century, the United States and the USSR are on the verge of nuclear war. In that tense political climate, an asteroid appears out of near space after an unusual supernova and settles into an extremely elliptical orbit near Earth orbit. The two nations each try to claim this mysterious object, which appears to be a virtual duplicate of Juno. It is hollow and contains seven vast terraformed chambers. Two of the chambers contain cities long abandoned by human beings who seemed to come from Earth&#x27;s future. The asteroid is called the &quot;Thistledown&quot; by its builders. A startling discovery is that it is bigger inside than outside. The seventh chamber appears to stretch into infinity.

The human inhabitants of the Thistledown come from an alternate timeline, approximately 1000 years in the future. In their timeline, human civilization was nearly destroyed by the &quot;Death&quot;, a calamitous World War involving nuclear weapons. The Death occurred at approximately the same time as the appearance of the Thistledown in the present time. Its presence threatens to cause the Death to occur on the current timeline as well.

An expedition is sent down the seemingly infinite seventh chamber (The &quot;Way&quot;, as it is known) where it encounters the descendants of humanity. The high technology of this civilization, known as the &quot;Hexamon&quot;, has control over genetic engineering, human augmentation, and matter itself. The Hexamon includes several alien species who have come to live with humanity&#x27;s descendants. The Hexamon itself is at war with an alien race known as the &quot;Jarts&quot; from further down the corridor still.

In 2007, CGSociety organised a &quot;CG Challenge&quot; based upon &quot;Eon&quot;

===&quot;Eternity&quot;===
Jarts, politics, and technology make up the second book in the series: &quot;Eternity&quot;.

The Jart religion is based on the preservation of all data, which encompasses all life forms, past and present, and sending that data to the Jarts&#x27; future masters, their descendants.

===&quot;Legacy&quot;===
In the third book (a prequel, set in the time before &quot;Eon&quot;), &quot;Legacy&quot;, soldier Olmy ap Sennon is sent to spy on a group of dissidents who have used the spacetime tunnel of &quot;the Way&quot; (introduced in &quot;Eon&quot;) to colonize the alien world of Lamarckia, a planet with an ecosystem that learns from its changed environment in a way that resembles Lamarckian evolution. Its plants and animals turn out to actually be parts of continent-sized organisms.

===&quot;The Way of All Ghosts&quot;===

In the short story, &quot;The Way of All Ghosts&quot;, soldier Olmy ap Sennon is sent to close a lesion that formed out of a wayward gate into perfection. This story was published in 1999 in &quot;Far Horizons&quot;.

==Fictional history of the Thistledown==
Within the universe of &quot;The Way&quot;, the Thistledown is an asteroid starship built by hollowing out Juno and fitting it with mass-driver (rail gun) engines and thermonuclear drives. Inside the asteroid, seven giant “Chambers” are built, of which two host cities for the inhabitants, while others host machinery and recreation areas. The asteroid is prepared 500 years in the future, as told in Bear&#x27;s novel, &quot;Eon&quot;, and is engaged on a multi-generational journey to Epsilon Eridani, around which a habitable planet is known to circle.

The journey is meant to take 60 years, as the ship can only maintain a velocity of 20% the speed of light. This limitation is removed after the technology of the Thistledown was improved to include inertial dampeners, allowing higher accelerations.

Inhabiting the Thistledown are the best and brightest of Earth, who are quite diverse both culturally and politically. The Thistledown&#x27;s society includes one transcendent genius, Konrad Korzenowski, whose preference for living in the Thistledown as compared with an outer universe, causes him to experiment with closed-geodesic space time in the Seventh Chamber, 20 years into the Thistledown&#x27;s voyage. The results of his experiments are shattering in the extreme: He creates a unique pocket universe: The Way.

==The Way==
===Origin===
The eponymous Way is an extension of the 7th Chamber, and was formed in the novels using the machinery of the 6th Chamber. This machinery is a selective inertial damper, developed by engineers within the Thistledown with twofold purpose - to permit the Thistledown to accelerate to the limit of its engines (up to 99% the speed of light) and to selectively dampen inertia within the vessel, e.g., water within waterways, high velocity train systems. The inertial dampening machinery within the 6th Chamber is anchored to the structure of the Thistledown, equally spaced around the chamber at the vertices of a regular heptagon. 

===Creation===
At the creation, and rejoining of the Way to the Thistledown, the character Konrad Korzenowski and his engineers designed and &#x27;built&#x27; the Way out of the in-folded geodesics of the inertial dampening field of the 6th Chamber machinery. This is described in the books by first considering the inertial dampening field: Within the Thistledown, the field envelops the asteroid, effectively isolating it from the Einsteinian Metrical Frame, permitting relative inertia to be ignored. The Thistledown was, at the time of activation, isolated from its continuum, but only selectively. Its matter and energy anchored it to its continuum and relative time, but its geometry and quantum entanglement had been strained by the inertial dampener, thus making it susceptible to superspace distortions, and therefore it could be affected by them negatively.

Korzenowski, having been influenced by the earlier work of Vazquez on Earth, and in developing her work within the Thistledown, planned a radical extension of the inertial field of the 6th Chamber - effectively extending the field away to an infinite extent within the 7th Chamber. In order to do this effectively, he and his engineers modified a set of semi-sentient field calibration tools to build the first Clavicles. Unlike the field calibration tools from which they were descended, the Clavicles possessed the ability not only to manipulate the field, but extend it as an extension of the will of the operator. Already radical enough, Korzenowski and his team went further. By extending the field of the 6th Chamber from within the 7th Chamber of the Thistledown, they could then directly access what Vasquez had calculated within her own work - alternate world lines as non-gravity bent geodesics of superspace.

Korzenowski thus &#x27;felt&#x27; superspace within the 7th Chamber, selecting the infinite selection of possible alternate pocket universes accessible by the Clavicle to form, as a sheer act of will, the Way from his designs and his vision. The resulting structure was constructed, not of matter, but of previously in-folded superspace vectors now infinitely extended. (in the manner of Schwarzschild folded geometry, or of an asymptotic curve.) The Way was thus opened.

The Way&#x27;s geometry also gave rise to the Flaw - as superspace geometry of the field boundary was extended infinitely, so the folded geodesics of the field unfold in the geometric centre of the Way to form a singularity. This singularity, the Flaw, rests within the Way&#x27;s plasma tube (which in turn is sustained by the Flaw). The Flaw &#x27;produces&#x27; gravity by actively repulsing matter away from itself in an acceleration at the square of the distance away from itself. In addition, any object encircling the Flaw, and then exerting pressure against it, experiences this pressure as a translation force along the Flaw&#x27;s length perpendicular to the direction of force. The motion thus induced is controllable by the angle at which an annular ring enclosure is pressed against the Flaw. The same spatial transform also can be used to turn tip turbines in order to generate electricity. The Flaw permits a violation of the First Law of Thermodynamics, therefore defining the Way as a perpetual motion machine of the First Order, making energy out of nothing.

===Early history===
The Way, as formed, was described by Bear as being in vacuum and did not consist of matter within its infinite length. Due to extremely slight ambiguity involved in its creation, the synchronicity between time within the Way, and within the Thistledown, was not exact. Thus, the Engineers spend two decades working to correct these faults using the Clavicles to manipulate the junction between Way and Thistledown. During this period, ambition led Korzenowksi to use the clavicle to open the first exploratory gate within the way, leading to the universe of the Jarts. Though the gate to Jart world was closed, the advanced Jarts nevertheless successfully managed to re-open, expand, occupy, and even master the workings of the Way. Korzenowski on returning had not taken into account the time dilation effects within the Way, and the Jarts had centuries within the way to access alternate universes, such as the one to the world of the Talsit. They established a trading empire, and were very hostile to the Way&#x27;s human creators who re-entered their territories having stabilised the connection to the Thistledown.

===The Jart Wars===
The progressive Geshels and conservative Naderites (two fictional groups in the novels) who made their travels into the Way quickly met the Jarts. Conflict ensued in order to drive the Jarts out of the Way - this partly succeeded within the first century of Human expansion into the Way. Both sides fought each other through the use of remote slaved munitions carrier vehicles, of broadly similar design (a consequence of their shared environment). Human vehicles were &#x27;crewed&#x27; by partial personalities held within memory systems. Jart machines had similar arrangements, though in at least one documented case, one of the war machines was crewed by a corporeal Jart duty expediter, subsequently captured.

Ultimately, the Jarts were driven back beyond 2 ex 9 ( 2x10^9 km, or 2 billion kilometres), a position they remained at until Journey Year 1174.

At the conclusion of the Jart Wars at about Journey Year 850, the Geshels and Naderites moved into the Way. The conflict had however resulted in casualties on both sides, and one of the most significant was that of the Engineer, Korzenowski, assassinated by Orthodox Naderites in the Thistledown. His personality was not completely lost, but no complete backups of the Engineer existed until the events of Journey Year 1175.

===Early Human exploration===
The opening of gates and use of field technology permitted the Geshels to cover the Way with soil and living plants, as well as fill it with air, for nearly a lightyear down from the Thistledown. This magnificent area remained as wilderness for much of the life of the Way. Soil, air and water were brought from worlds accessed from within the Way. Quickly, the gate openers discovered that the epoch and origin of the Thistledown within Earth&#x27;s solar system defined where the gates opened to - almost without exception (and these exceptions included as a consequence of the infinities addressed through superspace geometries as defined by Patricia Vasquez) were alternative versions of Earth within other Universes. Thus commerce was possible with these universes. Covering the surface of the way and filling the way with air was rendered simple by opening gates in proximity to a planet not occupied by intelligence or excessive quantities of animals, and then sucking the air and soil from these worlds to cover the Way&#x27;s bare surface.

Gates are capped with cupolas formed from Space-time itself. As distortions in space-time geometry, their nature can be calculated by 21st century instruments laid on their &#x27;surfaces&#x27;. The constant Pi, in particular, is most strongly affected.

===Axis City, and Eviction of the Naderites===
With the opening (and re-opening of previously Jart controlled) gates, the human migrants gained access to remarkable technologies and abilities, and made possible habitation within the Way, and on the Flaw itself, in the newly created Axis Thoreau and Axis Euclid at 1.5 ex 7 (15 million km). They developed trading client-patron relations with the Frants of Timbl, and client-client relations with the Talsit. With development of memory technologies, City Memory was created, and humans not only became immortal, but also gained the ability to be reborn. Government changed, with the formation of the Hexamon and the governing Nexus.

Orthodox Naderites remained within the Thistledown for a century after the end of Jart Wars, but concerns over the safety of the Thistledown and the danger of interference with the Sixth Chamber machinery caused the Geshels to have the Naderites forcibly removed from Thistledown to prevent disaster. Violence erupted during the forced migration, and for acclimation of Naderites, forced occupation of Thistledown City (the Geshel enclave) for most Naderites took place for one year.

By Journey Year 950, the Thistledown was empty, and history proceeded gently until the cataclysmic events of Journey Year 1175.

===Geometric Rhythms===
The mathematical construction of the Way as written creates a rhythm, or order in which gate loci are located, a consequence of the propagation of World Lines along folded Geodesics. For every kilometer of the Way, the time period experienced outside the asteroid increases or decreases by a year. For every meter of the Way there is a minimum intersection with the world-lines of 100 universes. However, there are significant segments of the Way wherein there are a near-infinity of Universes containing alternate Earths.

The reason for the Geometry Stacks, as they are called, is described by the author as being a direct consequence of the origin of the Way within the Thistledown, and its development through extension of the inertial dampening field of the Sixth Chamber. Essentially, the Way is anchored to the space-time of the Thistledown—Juno, within the Solar System of Earth. If it were possible to construct a universe like the Way without quantum entanglement, the Geometry Stacks would most likely not exist, or if in existence, would not be tied to a quantum entanglement with a particular continuum. Since the Way and Thistledown are entangled, the existence of the Geometry Stacks is to be expected within mathematical theory first developed by Patricia Vasquez in 1989 with regard to folded spatial transforms expressed as a function of the superspace curvature of the Way.

There is a sharp consequence to the entanglement of the Way - Alternate Universes accessed by Gates, and to worlds such as that of the Frants (Timbl), Talsit and Jarts, &quot;must&quot; by definition share a certain amount of entanglement, even in a most fractional percentage. It is therefore fair to say that these worlds are in fact alternate universes and versions of Earth, though divergence and near-complete lack of similarity in fact make them very different indeed.

The most noteworthy aspect of the Geometry Stacks is their infinite profusion of alternate Earths, in far greater quantity in comparison with the commerce gates with partners, clients—and enemies. In the case of the world of the Talsit, more than one Gate at more than one location is possible, as the probability of the Talsit world is very well defined indeed. Therefore, it can be demonstrated with mathematical precision that Human beings impose a remarkable set of quantum stresses upon their home continuum, resulting in a near-infinity of timelines for their world—all equally real. Thus, the many-worlds quantum model is proved to be both real and accessible within the novels, a fantastic achievement.

Gate openers, by Journey Year 1174, prefer not to work within the Geometry Stacks, as these universes are considered not worth the effort of determination, given the extreme difficulty of tuning a gate in the very tight confines of Stacks, where Universes are often separated by sub-quantum distances.

The Way, inevitably, will intersect with itself, and with the cores of Stars. Remarkable events are derived from this fact. In addition, the Way encompasses all events within itself within its length.

<doc id="301621" wikidata="Q140712" url="?curid=301621" title="Lake Tai">
<text>Taihu (), also known as Lake Tai or Lake Taihu, is a lake in the Yangtze Delta and one of the largest freshwater lakes in China. The lake is in Jiangsu province and a significant part of its southern shore forms its border with Zhejiang. With an area of and an average depth of , it is the third-largest freshwater lake entirely in China, after Poyang and Dongting. The lake contains about 90 islands, ranging in size from a few square meters to several square kilometers.

Lake Tai is linked to the Grand Canal and is the origin of a number of rivers, including Suzhou Creek. In recent years, Lake Tai has been plagued by pollution as the surrounding region experienced rapid industrial development.

==Formation==
Scientific studies suggest that Lake Tai&#x27;s circular structure is the result of a meteor impact, which resulted in shatter cones, shock-metamorphosed quartz, microtektites, and shock-metamorphic unloading fractures. The prospective impact crater has been dated to be greater than 70 million years old and possibly from the late Devonian Period. However, new research suggests that present evidence shows no impact crater structure or shock-mineral at Lake Tai. Fossils indicate that Lake Tai was dry land until the ingression of the East China Sea during the Holocene epoch. The growing deltas of the Yangtze and Qiantang rivers eventually sealed off Lake Tai from the sea, and the influx of fresh water from rivers and rains turned it into a freshwater lake.

==Scenic locations==

There are limestone formations at the foot of the adjacent Dongting Mountain (). These &quot;scholar&#x27;s rocks&quot; or &quot;Taihu stones&quot; are often prized as a decorating material for traditional Chinese gardens, as exemplified by those preserved in nearby Suzhou.

Three of the lake&#x27;s islands are preserved as a national geological park under the name Sanshan. They are famed as a former haunt of local bandits. Mei Yuan is also located in Lake Tai, along with Yuantouzhu. Yuantouzhu received its name (&quot;Turtle Head Isle&quot;) from the shape of its outline.

===Ferris wheel===
The &quot;Star of Lake Tai&quot; is a giant, ferris wheel on the shore of the lake. Completed in 2008, it takes 18 minutes to complete one revolution. Passengers can enjoy the scenery of Lake Tai and the city center. At night, lighting effects are switched on around the wheel. 

===Landmarks===
* Sheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort is situated on the southern shore of the lake.

==Business and industry==
The lake is known for its productive fishing industry and is often covered by fleets of small private fishing boats. Since the late 1970s, harvesting food products such as fish and crabs has been invaluable to people living along the lake and has contributed significantly to the economy of the surrounding area.

The lake is home to an extensive ceramic industry, including the Yixing pottery factory, which produces Yixing clay teapots.

==Pollution==
Pollution of the lake has been ongoing for decades despite efforts to reduce pollution that were not sustained and thus proved ineffective. In the 1980s and 1990s, the number of industries in the lake region tripled, and the population also increased significantly. One billion tons of wastewater, 450,000 tons of garbage, and 880,000 tons of animal waste were dumped into the shallow lake in 1993 alone. The central government intervened and initiated a campaign to clean up the lake, setting a deadline to comply with pollution standards. When the deadline was not met, 128 factories were closed on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1999. Compliance improved somewhat afterwards, but the pollution problem remained severe.

In May 2007, the lake was overtaken by a major algae bloom and by major pollution with cyanobacteria. The Chinese government called the lake a major natural disaster despite the anthropogenic origin of this environmental catastrophe. With the average price of bottled water rising to six times the normal rate, the government banned all regional water providers from implementing price hikes. (The lake provides water to 30 million residents, including about one million in Wuxi.) By October 2007, it was reported that the Chinese government had shut down or given notice to over 1,300 factories around the lake. Nonetheless, Wu Lihong, one of the leading environmentalists who had been publicizing pollution of the lake, was sentenced to three years in prison for alleged extortion of one of the polluters, but, undeterred, alleged in 2010 that not a single factory was closed.

Jiangsu province planned to clean the lake; chaired by then prime minister Wen Jiabao, the State Council set a target to complete the task by 2012. However, in 2010 &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that pollution had broken out again and that Wu Lihong, released from prison that April, was claiming that the government was trying to suppress news of the outbreak while switching to other supplies in place of lake water.

<doc id="301626" wikidata="Q660882" url="?curid=301626" title="Hijra (South Asia)">
<text>In the Indian subcontinent, hijra are transgender, intersex, or eunuch people who live in communities that follow a kinship system known as the guru-chela system. They are also known as aravani and aruvani, and in Pakistan, khawaja sira.

In Western terms, most hijras are feminine-identifying people assigned male at birth. Hijras are officially recognised as a third gender throughout countries in the Indian subcontinent, being considered neither completely male nor female. Hijras&#x27; identity originates in ancient Hinduism and evolved during the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526) and Mughal Empire (1526–1707).

Many hijras today live in well-defined and organised all-hijra communities, led by a guru. These communities have consisted over generations of those who are in abject poverty or who have been rejected by or fled their family of origin. Many of them are sex workers.

The word &quot;hijra&quot; is a Hindustani word. It has traditionally been translated into English as &quot;eunuch&quot; or &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;, where &quot;the irregularity of the male genitalia is central to the definition&quot;. However, in general hijras have been born male, with only a few having been born with intersex variations. Some hijras undergo an initiation rite into the hijra community called nirvaan, which involves the removal of the penis, scrotum and testicles.

Since the late 20th century, some hijra activists and non-government organizations have lobbied for official recognition of the hijra as a kind of &quot;third sex&quot; or &quot;third gender&quot;, as neither man nor woman. Hijras have successfully gained this recognition in Bangladesh and are eligible for priority in education and certain kinds of low paid jobs. In India, the Supreme Court in April 2014 recognised hijras, transgender people, eunuchs, and intersex people as a &quot;third gender&quot; in law. Nepal, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh have all legally accepted the existence of a third gender, with India, Pakistan and Nepal including an option for them on passports and certain official documents.

==Terminology==
The Hindi word &quot;hijra&quot; may alternately be romanized as &quot;hijira&quot;, &quot;hijda&quot;, &quot;hijada&quot;, &quot;hijara&quot;, &quot;hijrah&quot;. This term is generally considered derogatory in Urdu and the term &quot;khwaja Sara&quot; is used instead. Khwaja Sara is sometimes seen as a more respectable term and has been reclaimed by the community given its precolonial origins and more accepted status within Pakistani society. Another such term is &quot;khasuaa&quot; (खसुआ) or &quot;khusaraa&quot; (खुसरा).

A number of terms across the culturally and linguistically diverse Indian subcontinent represent similar sex or gender categories. While these are rough synonyms, they may be better understood as separate identities due to regional cultural differences. In Odia, a hijra is referred to as &quot;hinjida&quot; or &quot;hinjda&quot;, in Tamil as &quot;ali&quot;, &quot;aravanni&quot;, &quot;aravani&quot; or &quot;aruvani&quot; (often considered derogatory, and have been supplanted by in-community terms rejecting the concept of hijra for a broader trans identity, such as &quot;thirunangai&quot; (; &quot;respected woman&quot;), &quot;thirunambi&quot; (; &quot;respected man&quot;) and &quot;thirunar&quot; (; &quot;respected person&quot;) for trans woman, man and person respectively), in Punjabi as &quot;khusra&quot; or &quot;jankha&quot;, in Kannada as &quot;mangalamukhi&quot; (), in Sindhi as &quot;khadro&quot; (), and in Gujarati as &quot;pavaiyaa&quot; (). In Bengali, hijra is called &quot;hijra&quot; (), &quot;hijla&quot;, &quot;hijre&quot;, &quot;hizra&quot;, or &quot;hizre&quot;. In Konkani, they are known as &quot;hizddem&quot; or &quot;hizdô&quot;.

In North India, the goddess Bahuchara Mata is worshipped by pavaiyaa. In South India, the goddess Renuka is believed to have the power to change one&#x27;s sex. Male devotees in female clothing are known as &quot;jogappa&quot;. They perform similar roles to hijra, such as dancing and singing at birth ceremonies and weddings.

The word &quot;kothi&quot; (or &quot;koti&quot;) is common across India, similar to the kathoey of Thailand, although kothis are often distinguished from hijras. Kothis are regarded as feminine men or boys who take a feminine role in sex with men, but do not live in the kind of intentional communities that hijras usually live in. Additionally, not all kothis have undergone initiation rites or the body modification steps to become a hijra. Local equivalents include &quot;durani&quot; (Kolkata), &quot;menaka&quot; (Cochin), &quot;meti&quot; (Nepal), and &quot;zenana&quot; (Pakistan).

Hijra used to be translated in English as &quot;eunuch&quot; or &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;, although LGBT historians or human rights activists have sought to include them as being transgender. In a series of meetings convened between October 2013 and January 2014 by the transgender experts committee of India&#x27;s Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, hijra and other trans activists asked that the term &quot;eunuch&quot; be discontinued from usage in government documents, as it is not a term with which the communities identify.

==Gender and sexuality==

A common misconception of many in Indian society is that all &quot;hijra&quot; are intersex, asexual and impotent. This is not fully accurate as many hijra are sexually active, in relationships, or partake in sex work. In India, some Hijras do not define themselves by specific sexual orientation, but rather by renouncing sexuality altogether. However, these notions can come in conflict with the practical, which is that hijras are often employed as prostitutes. Furthermore, in India a feminine male who takes a &quot;receptive&quot; role in sex with a man will often identify as a &quot;kothi&quot; (or the local equivalent term). While kothis are usually distinguished from hijras as a separate gender identity, they often dress as women and act in a feminine manner in public spaces, even using feminine language to refer to themselves and each other. The usual partners of hijras and kothis are men who consider themselves heterosexual as they are the ones who penetrate. These male partners are often married, and any relationships or sex with &quot;kothis&quot; or hijras are usually kept secret from the community at large. Some hijras may form relationships with men and even marry, although their marriage is not usually recognised by law or religion. Hijras and kothis often have a name for these masculine sexual or romantic partners; for example, &quot;panthi&quot; in Bangladesh, &quot;giriya&quot; in Delhi or &quot;sridhar&quot; in Cochin. A 2015 study found that self identified &quot;panthi&quot; participants reported their sexual orientation as bisexual but otherwise aligned with male-typical in other study measures. Identification as &quot;hijra&quot;, &quot;kothi&quot; and &quot;panthi&quot; can be distinguished from Western categories, as they go beyond sexual attraction (such as gay, lesbian or bisexual in the West) to also include gender roles/presentation and preference in sexual position.

A qualitative, interview-based study found that those who fall under the umbrella of being hijra tend to identify with certain &#x27;schools of thought&#x27; including Khusrapan and Zananapan. These terms refer to categories of hijra functioning. Those who follow Khusrapan identify with being a Hermaphrodite, denouncing sex work while believing that the ancient practices of bestowing prayers and blessings are to be depended on for sustenance. In contrast, the Zananapan school of thought has followers who may be born biologically male but identify with being a woman through their appearance and lifestyle. They often turn to begging or sex work as a consequence of social exclusion.

==History==
The ancient Indian erotic book Kama Sutra mentions the performance of fellatio by feminine people of a third sex (&quot;tritiya prakriti&quot;). This passage has been variously interpreted as referring to men who desired other men, so-called eunuchs (&quot;those disguised as males, and those that are disguised as females&quot;), male and female trans people (&quot;the male takes on the appearance of a female and the female takes on the appearance of the male&quot;), or two kinds of biological males, one dressed as a woman, the other as a man. Furthermore, in the Puranas three kinds of &quot;devas&quot; or divine beings of music and dance were identified. These included &quot;apsaras&quot;, &quot;gandharvas&quot;, and &quot;kinnars&quot;, with the former two referring to female and male while the latter refers to &#x27;neuters&#x27;. Additionally, the early writings of the Manu Smriti explained the biological origin of the sexes, identifying a third sex that could result if there was an equal prevalence of male and female &#x27;seed&#x27;.

=== Islamic era ===
Hijra identity and culture is documented to have evolved during the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526) and Mughal Empire (1526–1707), where hijras held positions as servants for elite households, manual laborers, military commanders, political advisors, and guardians of the harem.

Franciscan travelers in the 1650s noted the presence of &quot;men and boys who dress like women&quot; roaming the streets of Thatta, in modern Pakistan. The presence of these individuals was taken to be a sign of the city&#x27;s depravity.

=== British colonialism and the anti-Hijra campaign (1858–1947) ===

Beginning in the 1850s, colonial authorities deployed various strategies to end hijra practices, which they saw as &quot;a breach of public decency&quot; and incapable of &quot;moral transformation,&quot; as part of their influence on colonial-era sexuality in India. Although hijras were already criminalised by Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, in 1861, authorities of the North-Western Provinces (NWP) sought to enact a &#x27;special law&#x27; against hijras. By 1870, no high-ranking British officials argued against the implementation of special legislation to address the &#x27;hijra problem&#x27;, thus solidifying an anti-hijra campaign all across the Indian subcontinent.

Anti-hijra laws were enacted, including a law outlawing castration, a marginal practice of the hijra community, although it was rarely enforced. The hijra were included in the Criminal Tribes Act (1871), subject to registration, monitoring and stigmatisation. Because of economic costs, hijras and other so-called &quot;criminal tribes&quot; were unable to be collectively sequestered from colonial society. British Lieutenant-Governor Edmund Drummond (1814–1895) framed the anti-hijra campaign as a necessary project. Hijras were monitored with the hope of ending hijra practices. Since the passage of the Criminal Tribes Act (1871), hijras could not possess children. This law also prevented the initiation—castration—as the administrators argued that hijra children did not or could not consent to it.

=== Post-colonial era (1947–present) ===
Hijra communities remain throughout modern states of Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh, although they continue to face social marginalisation and police abuse. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, hijras became the subject of more attention, being the focus of numerous documentaries, news features, ethnographies, monographs and dissertations. Gayatri Reddy writes that in the 21st century, hijras have also been &#x27;mainstreamed&#x27; into popular films: &quot;given this history of near invisibility, the recent attention focused on hijras has been unsettling for both hijras and non-hijras.&quot;

==Social status and economic circumstances==

Most hijras live at the margins of society with very low status; the very word &quot;hijra&quot; is sometimes used in a derogatory manner. The Indian lawyer and author Rajesh Talwar has written a book, titled &quot;The Third Sex and Human Rights&quot;, highlighting the human rights abuses suffered by the community. Few employment opportunities are available to hijras. Many get their income from performing at ceremonies (toli), begging (dheengna), or prostitution (&#x27;raarha&#x27;)—an occupation of eunuchs also recorded in premodern times. Violence against hijras, especially those who are prostitutes, is often brutal, and occurs in public spaces, police stations, prisons, and their homes. As with transgender people in most of the world, they face extreme discrimination in health, housing, education, employment, immigration, law, and any bureaucracy that is unable to place them into male or female gender categories.

===Housing===
The aforementioned all-hijra communities are where many hijra seek refuge and move in. These are made up of a hierarchical structure with large groups of hijras from different areas forming lineages or &quot;gharanas&quot;. A &quot;naayak&quot; is the head and primary decision maker for a gharana, determining policies for the community. Falling under naayaks are &quot;gurus&quot; (lit. &quot;teachers&quot;). Gurus are above community members and regulate daily life in the housing space (known as a &quot;dera&quot;). The followers of a &quot;guru&quot; are called &quot;chelas&quot;. Traditionally, teachers and their disciples use these terms in many domains such as religious learning; however, they bear specific meaning in hijra communities as being about cultural learning—hijra chelas are taught about hijra customs by their guru. These communities reflect similarities to Western notions of found family.

In these communities, the hijras usually refer to each other in feminine terms. Thus, they refer to their relations as sisters with those who fall around their age range or aunt with those older than them, and so on.

In October 2013, Pakistani Christians and Muslims (Shia and Sunni) put pressure on the landlords of Imamia Colony to evict any transgender residents. I. A. Rehman, the director of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, said, &quot;Generally in Pakistan, Khwaja Sira are not under threat. But they are in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province because of a &#x27;new Islam&#x27; under way.&quot;

===Healthcare===
The social status of hijra in society plays a part in their difficulty accessing healthcare services as physicians will turn hijra clients away, saying their presence will disturb other clients. Hijra have to hide their identities or can not disclose illnesses such as STIs. Most medical practitioners are also not well educated and informed enough on hijra or sexuality, further contributing to this issue. Social exclusion of the &quot;hijra&quot; also has some severe consequences for their health.

&quot;Hijra&quot; in Dhaka, Bangladesh were found to have the highest syphilis rates out of all at-risk groups in the city. In a study of Bangladeshi hijras, participants reported not being allowed to seek healthcare at the private chambers of doctors, and experiencing abuse if they go to government hospitals.

In 2008, HIV prevalence was 27.6% amongst hijra sex workers in Larkana, Pakistan. The general prevalence of HIV among the adult Pakistani population is estimated at 0.1%.

The aforementioned social inequalities and medical negligence also make hijra sex workers a more vulnerable population to HIV. Sex work increases the worker&#x27;s vulnerability to violence, and protection is not usually used in coerced sex, increasing risk of direct exposure to HIV. 40% of the sample in a Pakistan study on HIV reported experiencing forced sex or abuse. Additionally, of this sample, 58% of participants had STI&#x27;s, the most common being syphilis and gonorrhoea.

An Indian study consisting of 68 transgender participants reported that respondents expressed having intense feelings of low self-worth, shame, depression and suicidal thoughts, internalizing the negative views the society around them holds. Many hijra experience a lack of a support system, facing rejection from family members or difficulties in terms of maintaining steady relationships with romantic partners. This rejection from society contributes to struggles with mental health as well as trans sex workers feeling obligated to accept the violence and stigmas they are subject to.

===Criminalization of sexuality===
After India&#x27;s Supreme Court re-criminalized homosexual sex on 11 December 2013, there was a sharp increase in physical, psychological and sexual violence against the transgender community by the Indian Police Service, which often does not investigate reports of sexual assault against them. On 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court overturned India&#x27;s Section 377, which criminalized anal and oral sex.

===Education and employment===
In an ethnographic study on the &quot;hijra&quot; experience in Bangladesh, many &quot;hijra&quot; recounted childhood experiences of facing abuse and isolation from their peers for presenting as feminine males. Additionally, many &quot;hijra&quot; reported facing abuse and humiliation from their teachers as well, making school an unfriendly and uncomfortable environment for them. These experiences ultimately resulted in their reluctance to attend school or continue education. This lack of education ends up playing a role in unemployment rates of Hijra. Hijra in Bangladesh also experience sexual harassment and abuse at work, being removed from their jobs when outed as hijra or denied from jobs in general. They face accusations of disturbing the workplace environment.

Being turned away from traditional careers, many hijra have become involved in sex work. However, this has its own problems as Hijras face harassment, forced unprotected sex and assault from clients but many are not able to report it due to fear of harassment from the police as well.

In 2002, nearly 5,000 people attended the All India Eunuch Conference held in Varanasi; the conference&#x27;s platform demanded that universities and government open more job opportunities to this population. On 15 April 2014, in &quot;National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India&quot;, the Supreme Court of India ruled that transgender people should be treated as a third category of gender or as a socially and economically &quot;backward&quot; class entitled to proportional access and representation in education and jobs.

Beginning in 2006, hijras were engaged to accompany Patna city revenue officials to collect unpaid taxes, receiving a 4-percent commission.

==Language==

The hijra community developed a secret language known as Hijra Farsi. The language has a sentence structure loosely based on Hindi and a unique vocabulary of at least a thousand words. Some of the kinship terms and names for rituals used by the Hindi-speaking Hijra community are different in use from those used by people outside the Hijra community. For example, &quot;dādī&quot;, the Standard Hindi for &quot;paternal grandmother&quot;, is used in the Hijra community to address one&#x27;s guru&#x27;s guru. Beyond the Urdu-Hindi speaking areas of subcontinent the vocabulary is still used by the hijra community within their own native languages.

==In politics of South Asia==

The governments of both India (1994) and Pakistan (2009) have recognised hijras as a &quot;third sex&quot;, thus granting them the basic civil rights of every citizen. In India, hijras now have the option to identify as a eunuch (&quot;E&quot;) on passports and on certain government documents. They are not, however, fully accommodated; in order to vote, for example, citizens must identify as either male or female. There is also further discrimination from the government. In the 2009 general election, India&#x27;s election committee denied three hijras candidature unless they identified themselves as either male or female. In 2013, transgender people in Pakistan were given their first opportunity to stand for election. Sanam Fakir, a 32-year-old hijra, ran as an independent candidate for Sukkur, Pakistan&#x27;s general election in May.

In April 2014, Justice K. S. Radhakrishnan declared transgender to be the third gender in Indian law in &quot;National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India&quot;. The ruling said:

Justice Radhakrishnan said that transgender people should be treated consistently with other minorities under the law, enabling them to access jobs, healthcare and education. He framed the issue as one of human rights, saying that, &quot;These TGs, even though insignificant in numbers, are still human beings and therefore they have every right to enjoy their human rights&quot;, concluding by declaring that:

A bill supported by all political parties was tabled in Indian parliament to ensure transgender people get benefits akin reserved communities like SC/STs and is taking steps to see that they get enrollment in schools and jobs in government besides protection from sexual harassment.

In the 1990s, about 10,000 people belonged to a national organisation called Treetiya Panthi Sanghatana (TPS). As of 2003, the president was Kajal Nayak. A younger Kajal Nayak, who was 27 years old in 2019, is the president of Jajpur&#x27;s Transgender Association.

==In religion==
Many practise a form of syncretism that draws on multiple religions; seeing themselves to be neither men nor women, hijras practice rituals for both men and women.

They are usually devotees of the mother goddess Bahuchara Mata, Shiva, or both.

===Bahuchara Mata===
Bahuchara Mata is a Hindu goddess with two unrelated stories both associated with transgender behavior. One story is that she appeared in the avatar of a princess who castrated her husband because he would run in the woods and act like a woman rather than have sex with her. Another story is that a man tried to rape her, so she cursed him with impotence. When the man begged her forgiveness to have the curse removed, she relented only after he agreed to run in the woods and act like a woman. The primary temple to this goddess is located in Gujarat and it is a place of pilgrimage for hijras, who see Bahuchara Mata as a patroness.

===Ardhanarishvara===

One of the forms of Shiva is called Ardhanarishvara, a composite representation with one half of the form featuring Parvati. Ardhanarishvara has special significance as a patron of hijras, who identify with the gender ambiguity. According to legend, the sage Bhringi wished to venerate only Shiva, and ignored Parvati, while worshipping and circumambulating him. Agitated, Parvati cursed Bhringi to lose all his flesh and blood, reducing him to a skeleton. In this form Bhringi could not stand erect, so the compassionate ones who witnessed the scene blessed the sage with a third leg for support. As her attempt to humiliate the sage had failed, Parvati punished herself with austerities that pleased Shiva and led him to grant her the boon of uniting with him, thereby compelling Bhringi to worship the divine couple in the form of Ardhanarishvara, a combined form of the deities, believed to integrate the masculine and the feminine. 

===In the &quot;Ramayana&quot;===

In some versions of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, when Rama leaves Ayodhya for his 14-year exile, a crowd of his subjects follow him into the forest because of their devotion to him. Soon Rama notices this, and gathers them to tell them not to mourn, and that all the &quot;men and women&quot; of his kingdom should return to their places in Ayodhya. Rama then leaves for 14 years. When he returns to Ayodhya, he finds that the hijras, being neither men nor women, have not moved from the place where he gave his speech. Impressed with their devotion, Rama grants hijras the boon to confer blessings on people during auspicious inaugural occasions like childbirth and weddings. Specifically, hijras will perform and bestow their blessings when a son is born. This boon is the origin of &quot;badhai&quot; in which hijras sing, dance and give blessings.

===In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;===

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; includes an episode in which Arjuna, a hero of the epic, is sent into exile. There he assumes an identity of a eunuch-transvestite and performs rituals during weddings and childbirths that are now performed by hijras.

In another episode, before the Kurukshetra War, Aravan offers his lifeblood to goddess Kali to ensure victory for the Pandavas, and Kali agrees. On the night before the battle, Aravan expresses a desire to get married before he dies. No woman was willing to marry a man doomed to die in a few hours, so Lord Krishna (as Mohini) marries him. In South India, hijras claim Aravan as their progenitor and call themselves &quot;aravanis&quot;.

Each year in Tamil Nadu, during April and May, hijras celebrate an eighteen-day religious festival at a temple located in the village Koovagam in the Ulundurpet taluk in Villupuram district. The temple is devoted to the deity Koothandavar, who is identified with Aravan. During the festival, the hijras reenact the wedding of Lord Krishna and Lord Aravan, followed by Aravan&#x27;s subsequent sacrifice. They then mourn Aravan&#x27;s death through ritualistic dances and by breaking their bangles. An annual beauty pageant is also held, as well as various health and HIV/AIDS focused seminars. Hijras from all over the country travel to this festival. BBC Three documentary &quot;India&#x27;s Ladyboys&quot; as well as the National Geographic Channel television series &quot;Taboo&quot; depict personal experiences of hijras attending this festival.

===In Islam===

There is evidence that Indian hijras identifying as Muslim also incorporate aspects of Hinduism. Still, despite this syncretism, Gayatri Reddy notes that hijra do not practise Islam differently from other Muslims and argues that their syncretism does not make them any less Muslim. Reddy also documents an example of how this syncretism manifests: in Hyderabad, India, a group of Muslim converts were circumcised, something seen as the quintessential marker of male Muslim identity.

==In films and literature==

===India===

&quot;Hijras&quot; have been portrayed on screen in Indian cinema since its inception, historically as comic relief. A notable turning point occurred in 1974 when real &quot;hijras&quot; appeared during a song-and-dance sequence in &quot;Kunwaara Baap&quot; (&quot;The Unmarried Father&quot;). The Hindi movie &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; (1977) features &quot;hijras&quot; who accompany one of the heroes, Akbar (Rishi Kapoor), in a song entitled &quot;Tayyab Ali Pyar Ka Dushman&quot; (&quot;Tayyab Ali, the Enemy of Love&quot;).

* In &quot;Soorma Bhopali&quot; (1988), Jagdeep encounters a troupe of &quot;hijras&quot; on his arrival in Bombay. The leader of this pack is also played by Jagdeep himself.
* One of the main characters in Khushwant Singh&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot; (1990), Bhagmati, is a &quot;hijra&quot;. She makes a living as a semi-prostitute and is wanted in the diplomatic circles of the city.
* One of the first sympathetic &quot;hijra&quot; portrayals was in Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Bombay&quot; (1995). 1997&#x27;s &quot;Tamanna&quot; starred male actor Paresh Rawal in a central role as &quot;Tiku&quot;, a &quot;hijra&quot; who raises a young orphan.

* In Anil Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Nayak&quot; (2001), Johnny Lever, who plays the role of the hero&#x27;s assistant, gets beaten up by hijras, when he is caught calling them &quot;hijra&quot; (he is in habit of calling almost everyone who bothers him by this pejorative and no one cares much, except this once ironically, as the addressees are literally what he is calling them.)
* In the 2004 film &#x27;Bride and Prejudice&#x27;, directed by Gurinder Chadha, a group of hijras make an appearance during the &#x27;A Marriage Has Come to Town&#x27; number, in which they dance and sing the following lyrics: &quot;Who can tell you more about Yin &amp; Yang?/Sharing one spirit between woman and man/Marriage is the path taken by he and she/May your new life be kissed by harmony.&quot;
* Deepa Mehta&#x27;s controversial film &quot;Water&quot; (2005) features the &quot;hijra&quot; character &quot;Gulabi&quot; (played by Raghubir Yadav), who has taken to introducing the downtrodden, outcast widows of Varanasi to prostitution.
* Vijay TV&#x27;s &quot;Ippadikku Rose&quot; (2008), a Tamil show conducted by postgraduate educated transgender woman Rose, was a very successful program that discussed various issues faced by youth in Tamil Nadu, where she also gave her own experiences.
* In addition to numerous other themes, the 2008 movie &quot;Welcome to Sajjanpur&quot; by Shyam Benegal explores the role of &quot;hijras&quot; in Indian society.

===Malayalam===
In the Malayalam movie &quot;Ardhanaari&quot;, released on 23 November 2012, director Santhosh Sowparnika depicts the life of a transgender person. Manoj K Jayan, Thilakan, Sukumari and Maniyanpilla Raju perform leading roles.

Njan Marykutty is another Malayalam film about the troubles and challenges of a trans woman in Kerala.

===Tamil===
&quot;Vaadamalli&quot; by novelist Su. Samuthiram is the first Tamil novel about the Aravaani community in Tamil Nadu, published in 1994.

Transgender activist A. Revathi became the first hijra to write about transgender issues and gender politics in Tamil. Her works have been translated into more than eight languages and act as primary resources on gender studies in Asia. Her book is part of a research project for more than 100 universities. She is the author of &quot;Unarvum Uruvamum&quot; (Feeling and Form), the first of its kind in English from a member of the hijra community. She acted and directed stage plays on gender and sexuality issues in Tamil and Kannada. &quot;The Truth about Me: A Hijra Life Story&quot; is part of the syllabus for final year students of The American College in Madurai.

&quot;Naan Saravanan Alla&quot; (2007) and Vidya&#x27;s &quot;I Am Vidya&quot; (2008) were the first autobiographies of trans women.

===Pakistan===
The 1992 film &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot; by Jamil Dehlavi is based upon the culture-clash between a western Jewish couple seeking fertility at a Karachi shrine known to be blessed by a Sufi fakir called &#x27;Gulab Shah&#x27; and the group of Pakistani eunuchs who guard it.

&quot;Murad&quot; (, but the film&#x27;s English title was &quot;Eunuch&#x27;s Motherhood&quot;), was an award-winning biographical telefilm drama made by Evergreen Media Europe for Pakistan&#x27;s television channel Indus TV that aired in 2003. It featured some of the country&#x27;s top male television actors—Sohail Asghar, Nabeel, Qazi Wajid, and Kamran Jilani playing the roles of hijras. It was directed by Kamran Qureshi, written by Zafar Mairaj and produced by Iram Qureshi. It won both Best TeleFilm and Best Director awards at 2003 Indus Telefilm Festival. The story revolves around Saima, a transgender woman, who adopts a child named Murad. For the first time, influential male actors showed their support for hijra rights during interviews, pointing out that in Pakistani English at that time eunuch was the term to describe a transgender person, and &quot;khwaja sara&quot; had not yet replaced what is now considered a derogatory term due to decades of heckling and name calling.

In 2004, Kamran Qureshi directed &quot;Moorat&quot; (, released in English under the title &quot;Eunuch&#x27;s Wedding&quot;). It a 33-episode series produced by Humayun Saeed and Abdullah Kadwani with more than a dozen cast members. It was nominated for Best Drama Serial, Abid Ali for Best Actor, and Maria Wasti for Best Actress at the Lux Style Awards 2005. The show was credited with making people understand the pain and abuse that hijra constantly endure when people make fun of the way they look or dress. The story involves a young lady who is engaged to be married. It turns out her husband is transgender. The story unfolds the trans community and their deprived and isolated world. It portrays eloquently how they, too, are not far away from human emotions and feelings and their world is not much different from the heterosexual community. Even though they are in plain sight, they are taboo subjects and are not taken seriously. This makes them suffer endlessly in silence wrapped in slurs. The 33-episode series therefore touches on transgender abuse, abuse against women, poverty, the immorality of arranged marriages and child abuse.

&quot;Bol&quot; (Urdu: بول meaning &quot;Speak&quot;), is a 2011 Urdu-language Pakistani social drama film. It concerns a patriarch, Hakim, who is a misogynist, a domestic abuser, a bigot and a zealot who forces religion on his family. They face financial difficulties due to Hakim wanting a son. He rejects his transgender daughter, Saifi, as he wanted an heir and she identifies as a girl. Saifi is deeply loved by the rest of her family. As she grows up, men want to take advantage of her and she does not understand at first. However, her oldest sister intervenes and teaches Saifi about what kind of touching is inappropriate. As Saifi grows older, she is not allowed to leave the house. She finds her sister&#x27;s dresses compelling and tries them on, revealing her gender identity. A neighbour, played by famous South Asian singer Atif Aslam, who is in love with one of the sisters, gets Saifi a job at a place where they paint trucks, with the blessing of Saifi&#x27;s sisters and mother. Saifi dresses like a boy; however, other boys sense her lack of self-esteem and eventually gang-rape her. She is saved when another transgender person, played by Almas Bobby (a transgender actor), finds her and takes her home. Hakim overhears Saifi telling her mother and Zainab what happened. When everybody is asleep, Hakim locks the room and suffocates Saifi for the &quot;shame&quot; he would have to bear if the story got out. It received several positive reviews from critics and went on to win the Best Hindi film award in IRDS Film awards 2011 by Institute for Research and Documentation in Social Sciences (IRDS).
